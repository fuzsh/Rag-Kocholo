Prior to the advent of the sophisticated weapons of World War II, however, this connection was not commonly perceived. Although the importance of technology was well known, politicians tended to regard physics as an esoteric subject that had little relation to the important affairs in life. Physicists viewed politics in a similar light. Until recently historians have reflected these views, writing political history that made only cursory mention of science and producing history of science stripped of its social and political context. This gap has been particularly conspicuous regarding the Third Reich. Historians of science have been intensely concerned with scientific developments in twentieth century Germany, but they have largely tended to avoid addressing the political environment of research during the Third Reich. Historians of Nazi Germany have been concerned with other professional groups, such as the members of the civil service, the clergy, and the army, but have seldom taken note of the members of the scientific community. This study is an effort to bridge the gap and expand our knowledge and awareness in both fields of history. The theme of this book is how prominent scientists, particularly physicists, responded to the political environment of the Third Reich. Most of these men were leaders of their professional community; a few were renegades. I have chosen to focus on the physicists in the universities and state-supported research institutions, largely because they formed the core of that gifted group of German scientists whose atomic research eventually helped reveal the political significance of \"pure\" science. In addition, as the leaders of organized German science and as civil servants, the academic physicists occupied positions of responsibility and authority affecting the entire physics community. They were unable to evade political pressures. These pressures came principally from two sources, the state and the party. It is fully documented that the policies of the state and party offices were often at odds with one another, and that competing political and ideological factions within the party further confused\n\nPREFACE\n\nmatters. The image of the monolith projected by the Nazis has dissolved; the picture is now seen more clearly as a montage of rivalries between mutually antagonistic bureaucratic structures. Amid the welter of competing influences and powers, the physics community was forced to deal primarily with two separate phenomena. The first was the government's attempt to align German academia with National Socialism, the most dramatic aspect of which was the policy of dismissing Jews from the civil service. The second was an unsuccessful attempt by a small band of politically active scientists to inject racial considerations into the content and conduct of physics as a discipline. Considering these developments, the questions which arise in the course of this study are: What was the impact of the dismissal policy upon the German physics community? Why did the effort to produce an \"Aryan physics\" eventually fail? and What was the extent to which the maintenance of professional values constituted opposition to National Socialism? In an effort to answer these questions, I have relied primarily on unpublished documents, tape-recorded interviews, and correspondence with participants. A number of persons have generously made available private papers in their possession. In this connection, I owe thanks to Mrs. Richard Courant, Mrs. Wolfgang Finkelnburg, Mrs. Hermann Lisco and Mrs. Arthur von Hippel (the daughters of James Franck), Professor Walther Gerlach, Professor Samuel Goudsmit, Professor Werner Heisenberg, and Professor Theodore H. von Laue. The staffs of various historical research institutions, such as the Institut fur Zeitgeschichte and Deutsches Museum in Munich, the Bundesarchiv in Koblenz, the Berlin Document Center, and the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford have been very helpful. In addition, I wish to express my gratitude for the encouragement and aid of Professor Charles Weiner, formerly of the Center for History of Physics of the American Institute of Physics in New York; Dr. Judith Goodstein of the California Institute of Technology Archives; Professor Armin Hermann of the Lehrstuhl fiir die Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften und Technik in Stuttgart; and Dr. Hermann Weisert of the Heidelberg Universitatsarchiv. The abbreviated titles of these and other institutions as used in the notes are presented in the bibliography. Materials from one research center need to be explained in more detail. The Archive for History of Quantum Physics was originally established at the Library of the University of California at Berkeley\n\nPREFACE\n\nXI\n\nas part of the Sources for History of Quantum Physics (SHQP) project. (For a discussion of the scope of this project, see Thomas Kuhn et al., Sources for History of Quantum Physics, An Inventory and Report [Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1967]). The eighty-five microfilm reels and thousands of pages of transcribed interviews of the SHQP holdings form the core of the Archive, which also includes the Niels Bohr Scientific Correspondence (BSC) and other collections of private papers. The location of a letter in the Archive will be designated by the author and recipient, date, abbreviation SHQP or BSC, and two numbers in parentheses. The first number refers to the reel and the second to the section of the reel under which the letter is cataloged, for example, Werner Heisenberg to Niels Bohr, 14 June 1938, BSC (20,2). I am particularly indebted to Mrs. Leslie Clark and Professor John Heilbron for their aid in the use of Archive materials. Since this study is an effort to bridge the gap between political history and history of science, it is hoped that political historians will take note of the richness of the Archive. Its thousands of documents provide insight into the lives of many prominent and perceptive men and women who by no means limit their discussions strictly to technical matters. A number of individuals made available useful information through interviews and correspondence. Their time has been deeply appreciated. Professor P. P. Ewald, Mrs. Wolfgang Finkelnburg, Professors Paul Forman, Walther Gerlach, Werner Heisenberg, Friedrich Hund, Theodore H. von Laue, Mrs. Hermann Lisco, Professor Lothar Nordheim, Mrs. Constance Reid, and Professor Otto Scherzer have been kind enough to read and comment upon portions of an earlier version of the manuscript. Professors Forman and Hund are especially remembered for the help and heartening interest they provided. In addition, I wish to acknowledge the support and helpful criticism of the members of the faculty of the University of California at Santa Barbara, particularly Professor Lawrence Badash and Professor Joachim Remak. From 1967, when he first suggested to me the topic of scientists in Nazi Germany, to the present, the counsel and friendship of Professor Badash has been a constant source of encouragement. To both Professors Badash and Remak I owe much of my desire to understand men and women of the past in the context of their own values. We need not accept their versions of truth,\n\nXll\n\nPREFACE\n\nbut we must grasp their standards and perceptions if we are to gain the insight which allows us to disagree with them on a basis other than polemic. There is no adequate way to express the debt I owe to the many friends, relatives, and associates who have patiently tolerated my preoccupation with this topic over the years. Put simply, without their support this book could not have been written. I owe particular thanks to Mr. Frank Smith, whose encouragement made possible the completion of the final version of the manuscript. More than to anyone else, for reasons too numerous to list, I owe a debt of gratitude to my wife, Marila. Financial assistance was provided during the research and writing of earlier versions of this study by a National Defense Education Act Title IV Fellowship, a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, and the Academic Senate of the University of California, Santa Barbara. The indispensable aid of the Inter-library Loan Department of the UCSB library is also deeply appreciated. All translations are my own unless otherwise indicated. Cape Cod August 1976\n\n1. The Background In the early years of the Third Reich, Max Planck, the dean of German physicists and president of the prestigious Kaiser Wilhelm Society, a government-supported research foundation, was involved in an incident that symbolized the problems facing scientists under Hitler. P. P. Ewald, himself a prominent physicist, recounts the story: . . . I think it was on the occasion of the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Metals in Stuttgart, and Planck as president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft came to the opening. And he had to give the talk, and this must have been in 1934, and we were all staring at Planck, waiting to see what he would do at the opening, because at that time it was prescribed officially that you had to open such addresses with \"Heil Hitler.\" Well, Planck stood on the rostrum and lifted his hand half high, and let it sink again. He did it a second time. Then finally the hand came up, and he said, \"Heil Hitler.\" . . . Looking back, it was the only thing you could do if you didn't want to jeopardize the whole Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft.1 In retrospect it seems a small incident. Yet it epitomizes the hundreds of decisions required of physicists in the Third Reich, especially those in positions of authority or responsibility, in their efforts to keep their discipline from being politically consumed. The fundamental issue was the extent to which compromise with the regime was necessary in order to retain the greatest possible degree of professional autonomy. Like the vast majority of the professoriate, German physicists desired strongly to remain aloof from political concerns. And also like most of their colleagues, they were not truly able to do so. THE STRUCTURE AND ATTITUDES OF GERMAN ACADEMIA Since their origin during the high and late Middle Ages, German universities—like their counterparts in other lands—have traditionally been centers of training for the middle-class professions of law, medicine, and the ministry. With the development of the modern state in the German cultural area, however, particularly in Prussia in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the institutions of higher\n\n2\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\nlearning also assumed responsibility for the education of the professional civil service. The administrative bureaucracy was originally composed of aristocrats by birth who were in effect the king's personal aides. Beginning with the end of the eighteenth century, however, the civil service was dominated by an educated aristocracy of merit whose allegiance was to the state rather than to the monarchy. The new aristocracy, and generally members of the older nobility as well, conformed to an outlook epitomized by the concept of Bildung (education).2 Bildung meant much more than advanced instruction and schooling. It also entailed the notion of character and personality formation within a cultural environment which stressed duty, adherence to principle, and a lofty concern for the \"inner\" or \"spiritual\" (geistig) values of life. These values found their highest expression in the concept of Kultur (culture). In the eighteenth century, the term had meant the cultivation of mind and spirit, but by the nineteenth century, it had come to connote all of man's humanistic achievements in society. It was contrasted with Zivilisation (civilization), which was identified with a Western, decadent, utilitarian concern for the material conditions of life and technological advances.3 The connotations of Bildung led rather easily to an air of moral superiority among the educated (gebildete) elite, even toward the titled nobility.4 Members of this elite, which the noted scholar Fritz Ringer has called the German \"mandarins,\" comprised government officials, doctors, lawyers, ministers, secondary school teachers, university professors, and any others who had received university training.5 The government funded the universities and held the ultimate administrative authority over them, but each school had the right to manage its purely academic affairs. Professors ranked as higher civil servants and derived especially great prestige from their functions as the collective repository of the virtues of education and as the transmitters of these values to the future administrators of the state. It became a fundamental tenet of mandarin ideology, in fact, that the state itself existed to preserve and protect the culture held in trust by the aristocracy of education. During the reform movement which swept through Germany in the wake of the Napoleonic conquests, the philosophical faculty replaced medicine, law, and theology as the heart of the university.6 The humanistic disciplines had to face a growing challenge from the\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\n3\n\nphysical sciences, however, which gained in significance and influence throughout the nineteenth century as a result of technological progress in Germany. Much of the older professoriate regarded the empirical disciplines as manifestations of Zivilisation rather than Kultur and resisted their acceptance in the universities. Nevertheless, by the end of the century, the physical sciences had become an established and dynamic element of German academic life. They brought with them an emphasis on creative research (exemplified by the creation of the Ph.D. research degree) and the importance of the research institute (each organized originally around a laboratory). Research and teaching thus became closely allied in German higher education.7 In addition, government and industrial institutes began to proliferate in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in response to the growing need for research. The establishment of chemical laboratories led the way in this development. In 1887 the state-funded Imperial Institute of Physics and Technology (Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, or PTR) was founded in Berlin as a type of national bureau of standards. By the Weimar period, the PTR was the largest state-supported physical research laboratory in Germany.8 The Kaiser Wilhelm Society (Kaiser Wilhelm-Gesellschaft, or KWG) was established in 1911 and by the 19208 administered an ever-growing network of research institutes.9 Part of the KWG funding came from the government and part from private industry. Industrial laboratories for physics were also founded in this period and provided close links between physics and industry. The purists among the academicians viewed such developments with a mixture of contempt and apprehension. They drew a sharp distinction between the all-encompassing term Wissenschaft (learning or scholarship) and the much narrower Naturwissenschaft (science).10 Science was unmistakably regarded as an activity less worthy than pure learning. Ringer has shown that the \"orthodox\" position among humanistic scholars about 1900 was based on the fear that their privileges and prestige were threatened by the advent of the industrialized mass age. They were particularly alarmed at the prospect of the \"leveling\" of society represented by the goals of international socialism. They were opposed to the divisiveness of party politics and energetically defended the \"national cause.\" Many academicians also felt there\n\n4\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\nwas a link between the increasing prominence of the Jews in German society and the ills of interest group politics during the Weimar period.11 The great majority of scholars viewed the Weimar government with icy reserve: they were willing to serve the German state, but not the Social Democrats. They regarded parliamentary politics as sordid and factional, but they did not realize that their own stance, which was allegedly \"above politics/' was just as divisive as that of the parties they abhorred.12 The National Socialist German Workers Party of Adolf Hitler was too much a mass movement to attract them. But Nazi rhetoric that rejected the role of a mere political party was appealing. Hitler declared that his movement, too, was above politics. National Socialism promised a national uplifting instead of an international leveling of society. Ringer omits the natural scientists in his study of academic political attitudes, but among physicists, the political consensus was also strongly nationalist. Paul Forman has demonstrated that in physics, as in the academic community at large, this outlook was not considered political at all.13 Forman has suggested that their deep-seated conviction that science and politics were a priori incompatible prevented the physicists from perceiving the political nature of their own behavior.14 Although a wide range of nationalist behavior was regarded by scientists as nonpolitical, open support for the Weimar republic was not permissible. Thus the travels of Albert Einstein abroad in the early postwar years, during which the physicist served as an instrument of Weimar foreign policy, exceeded the bounds of acceptable nonpolitical activity.15 Einstein's avowed pacifism, internationalism, and support of Zionism contributed to his status as an outsider in most German scientific circles during the 19208. On the other hand, open opposition to Weimar was also regarded as a transgression of the professional code. The two most prominent physicists whose right-wing behavior was frowned upon by their colleagues were the Nobel laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark. Their overt support for National Socialism was unusual among academicians and truly exceptional among physicists. Their vocal adherence to volkisch (national-racial) concepts—not only in politics, but in their views on the nature and practice of physics itself— marked them as renegades among their fellow scientists during both the Weimar and Nazi periods. The strident anti-Semitism displayed by Lenard and Stark was unconventional in German academia, but a milder version was wide-\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\n5\n\nspread. This variety was expressed mainly in professorial appointments. In 1909-10, for example, 19 percent of the instructors at German universities were of Jewish origin, while Jews accounted for only 7 percent of the full professors. Anti-Semitism was weaker in some fields than others, however, and medicine and the natural sciences had an appreciably greater representation of Jews than other disciplines.16 Up to 1933, the extent of Jewish participation in these fields continued to increase, so that the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists had a highly significant impact upon academic science. In addition to their belief that nationalist considerations transcended politics and to their practice of quiet anti-Semitism in professional appointments, the vast majority of Weimar academicians also subscribed to the rejection of a vaguely conceived \"materialism.\" The academicians used this term as an ambiguous catchword to represent the source of all the ills of German society. Materialism meant too much commercialism, concern for money, industry, and technology. It connoted a general moral and social decadence and lack of respect for intellectual and spiritual values. Materialism fed the vulgar tastes of the masses and was responsible for their lack of national sentiments (evidenced by their votes for the Social Democratic and Communist parties).17 It stood for the evils of Zivilisation enthroned above the virtues of Kultur. The rejection of modern industrial society was not limited to the universities, of course. Assaults upon modernity and its attendant evils (urbanism, materialism, liberalism, socialism, parliamentarianism, rationalism, etc.) were launched by large segments of the German intelligentsia, who were marked by what Fritz Stern has termed \"cultural despair.\" Their hostile reaction to the modern world was coupled with a romantic longing for disappearing traditional values. The usual condemnation of science was represented in the beliefs of one of the foremost of Stern's cultural pessimists, to whom science signified: positivism, rationalism, empiricism, mechanistic materialism, technology, skepticism, dogmatism, and specialization, in fact everything but the disinterested and devoted quest for knowledge. He loathed science both for what it was and what it did.18 Physical scientists and mathematicians thus found themselves in an exceedingly hostile intellectual environment in Germany. In particular, they were held accountable in academic circles for the con-\n\nO\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\ncept of mechanistic determinism linked by many professors to an abhorrent materialism. Forman has suggested that several Weimar physicists and mathematicians were sufficiently affected by this criticism to respond to it in their own work. They quickly approved the rejection of causality involved in the new conceptions of the quantum theory generated in the mid-19205, thus liberating themselves from the onus of determinism. Modern physics was, Forman has asserted, ''primarily an effort by German physicists to adapt the content of their science to the values of their intellectual environment.\" 19 THE WEIMAR CENTERS OF MODERN PHYSICS Within Germany three intellectual centers figured particularly prominently in the generation of the new theories of modern physics between 1900 and 1930. The small university town of Gottingen was the seat of a long-standing, broad mathematical-physical tradition which was of particular importance in statistical mechanics. Berlin was the organizational center of German physics as well as the site of a university with a staff of excellent physicists. And Munich was the training ground for many of the brightest young scientists who contributed to the new ideas in physics. The manner in which National Socialism affected each of these creative centers reveals basic elements of its impact upon the physics community as a whole. Gottingen was unusual among German universities in having a relatively high degree of interdisciplinary contact between physics and mathematics. Foremost among its mathematicians was David Hilbert. He had encouraged the Gottingen mathematical-physical tradition which stretched back into the mid-nineteenth century, but he was ill during much of the Weimar period. Although he could not perform his earlier towering role, his spirit of interdisciplinary contact continued to be felt throughout the 1920S.20 His younger colleague Richard Courant was very active in collaboration with the physicists, and his 1924 book Methoden der mathematischen Physik (Methods of mathematical physics) became an influential textbook. Largely through Courant's efforts, Gottingen received funds from the Rockefeller Foundation for new and expanded physics and mathematics institutes on the Bunsenstrasse.21 In addition to Hilbert and Courant, there was an impressive array of mathematical talent in Weimar Gottingen. Edmund Landau in number theory, Emmy Noether in algebra, and Hermann Weyl in relativity theory and the foundations of mathematics—all were fig-\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\n7\n\nures of renown. Emmy Noethers work toward an axiomatic treatment of algebra led Weyl to recall her as the greatest woman mathematician in history.22 Gottingen's physicists were able to rival its mathematicians in talent. Max Born in theoretical physics was in close contact with Copenhagen, Munich, and Berlin, and he proved to be a key figure in the development of modern physics. Among the young physicists who worked with him during the Weimar period were Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Eugene Wigner, and Maria GoeppertMayer, all later Nobel laureates, as was Born himself. Gottingen also possessed two distinguished professors of experimental physics. Robert Pohl gave the large general lecture courses and directed the First Physical Institute, while James Franck supervised the small laboratory classes and the Second Physical Institute. Pohl was very much concerned with the quality of basic physics instruction (his lectures were famous) and with research in optics.23 For his work on excitation potentials before the war, Franck had shared the 1925 Nobel prize. Franck's keen intuitive insight into fundamental problems of modern physics complemented Born's tendency toward formalism.24 The high degree of communication and intellectual excitement in Gottingen during the twenties has made it a symbol of \"the beautiful years\" prior to the advent of National Socialism.25 Even though it was far from the republican hustle of Berlin and the conservative bustle of Munich, however, Gottingen could not escape the political upheaval of the thirties. In fact, since many of its physicists and mathematicians were Jewish, Gottingen was severely affected in 1933 by the Nazi policy of dismissing \"non-Aryans\" from civil service positions. An impressive collection of scientific talent had also gathered in Berlin, the city regarded by many physicists as the stronghold of German physics.26 As professor of theoretical physics at Berlin University, Max Planck had founded quantum theory, which provided the basis for much of modern physics. There also Max von Laue, a pupil of Planck famed for his work in x-ray crystallography, held an extraordinary (ausserordentlicher) professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was also connected with the university, although he worked to a great extent alone. In 1924, these famous men were joined by Walther Nernst, who had discovered the third law of thermodynamics. When Planck retired in 1927, one of the key fig-\n\n8\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\nures in quantum physics, Erwin Schrodinger, was appointed as his successor. The center of the scientific life of the university was the weekly colloquium where these men—all Nobel laureates—were joined by researchers from industrial laboratories and the Imperial Institute for Physics and Technology.27 Berlin was also distinguished by the work conducted at the Institute of Technology (Technische Hochschule, or TH), especially in the late twenties when the Nobel laureate Gustav Hertz was the professor of experimental physics and Richard Becker held the chair for theoretical work.28 The level of physics in the capital city was further enhanced by the research in associated fields such as physical chemistry and radiochemistry. Particularly noteworthy in this regard were the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry headed by the Nobel prizewinner Fritz Haber and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry guided by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner. For his discovery of nuclear fission at the end of 1938, Hahn, too, received Nobel recognition. At least as important as Berlin's scientific reputation was its role as the center of organized German science. The Berlin physicists largely dominated the policies of the German Physical Society (Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft), which had expanded to a national organization shortly after World War I. Along with other Berlin figures such as Haber, they played key roles in the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, the Prussian Academy of Sciences (Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften) and the fund-dispensing Emergency Association of German Science (Notgemeinschaft der deutschen Wissenschaft). The impact of National Socialism upon physics in Berlin was not limited to the toll of the dismissal policy, although that was serious enough. The Nazi seizure and exercise of power also had consequences for Berlin's moral and organizational leadership of German physics. Because Berlin was the cultural and intellectual nerve center of Weimar Germany as well as its political capital, those Germans who rejected Berlin's political leadership also tended to reject its cultural guidance.29 This phenomenon appeared in all areas of Weimar intellectual life, including physics. Lenard and Stark, for example, displayed a consistent antipathy toward the Berlin leadership in science beginning with World War I. Stark's antagonism led to his attempt to reorganize German science under new leadership during the Nazi period.\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\n9\n\nMunich was a seedbed of counterrevolution and anti-Semitism in the Weimar years. The key representative of modern physics in the Bavarian capital was Arnold Sommerfeld, professor of theoretical physics at the university since 1906. Unlike Wilhelm Wien, his colleague in experimental physics, who was nearly as opposed to Berlin's leadership and modern physics as Lenard and Stark, Sommerfeld worked closely with his northern counterparts. His work on quantum theory was certainly important, but perhaps his most significant contribution to the new physics was his training of more than a generation of Germany's best theoretical physicists, including no less than four Nobel prize winners.30 Sommerfeld's word in academic appointments carried a great deal of weight. In 1928, nearly one-third of all full professors of theoretical physics in the German-speaking world were Sommerfeld pupils.31 Although Sommerfeld had a number of Jewish students, the heavily Catholic university did not appoint many Jews to academic positions.32 Thus the dismissal policy had little effect there. The impact of National Socialism upon Munich physics was felt much more strongly through politicized academic appointments. The political criteria were basically Nazi party membership and adherence to the attempt by Lenard and Stark to inject racial ideology into physics. Although these men labeled their views \"deutsche Physik\" (German physics) in a claim to speak for the true national spirit, they remained a small enough minority to justify the use of one of the more applicable synonyms for their movement, \"Aryan physics.\" THE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS COME TO POWER Although the proponents of Aryan physics claimed to have Hitler's backing, the Fiihrer never took a direct hand in the affairs of the physics community. In the years preceding the Nazi seizure of power, however, he did formulate basic views on education and the civil service to guide the Nazi movement. The Fiihrer explained in Mein Kampf that as necessary as chemistry, physics, mathematics, and such subjects may be in a \"materialisticized\" (vermaterialisierte) era of technology, it was dangerous to devote more and more schooling to these disciplines. What Germany needed was education (Bildung), based not on the materialistic egoism fostered by the sciences, but on individual sacrifice to the community.33 History and some other fields could aid in accomplishing this task, but they were not enough. Of utmost priority in education, Hitler declared, was the production\n\n1O\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\nof sound bodies. Second came character development. Least important was scholarly training, for, he asserted: a person less scholarly educated [gebildet], but with a good firm character full of decisiveness and will power is worth more to a people as a whole than a physically degenerated, weak-willed, cowardly pacifistic individual.34 Obviously, Hitler had no love for intellectuals. The historian Joachim Fest has even remarked: ''Fundamentally National Socialism represented a politically organized contempt for the mind.\" 35 Hitler's attitude toward the professional civil service was equally contemptuous. In a private talk with the editor of a nationalist newspaper in 1931, Hitler was asked where he would acquire the trained minds to run the administrative machinery of the state once he had seized power. Where would he get the necessary brains? He would be the brains, Hitler emphatically replied. Anyway, he demanded, do you think perhaps that, in the event of a successful revolution along the lines of my party, we would not inherit the brains in droves? Do you believe that the German middle class (sarcastically), this flower of the intelligentsia, would refuse to serve us and place their minds at our disposal? The German middle class would take its stand on the famed ground of the accomplished fact; we will do what we like with the middle class.36 And the Jews? Richard Breiting noted in a second conversation that there were good and capable people among them—men who had been awarded iron crosses during the war, men with great minds like Einstein. Hitler's answer was this: Everything they have created has been stolen from us. Everything that they know will be used against us. They should just go and foment their unrest among other peoples. We do not need them.37 The editor went away marveling that the Fiihrer considered even Einstein an alien who would have to go.38 The deepening economic depression and its attendant unemployment and despair fed the growth of Hitler's movement. Hitler was officially appointed chancellor on January 30, 1933, and the National Socialists thereupon quickly consolidated their power.39 One very important factor in regard to the civil service, including\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\n11\n\nthe German professoriate, was the apparent legality of the Nazi ascent to power. The technical propriety undermined opposition to the regime and provided a basis for the hope that Hitler would learn to behave less radically once in a position of responsibility. The cloak of legality provided Hitler with a tremendous psychological advantage over the law-abiding middle class.40 One of the basic National Socialist goals was formally to legalize anti-Semitism. The doctrine of the \"racial enemy\" was, of course, one of the vital components of the Nazi movement—its role in Nazi ideology has been aptly compared to that of the \"class enemy\" in communist thought.41 As early as 1920, in its twenty-five-point program, the party had indicated that only racial comrades (Volksgenosseri) could be citizens, and that Jews were excluded from this category. Furthermore, the program stated that only citizens should hold public office at any level.42 During the mid-ig2os the Nazis had displayed their consistency and earnestness on this point by introducing Reichstag legislation to remove Jews from the civil service.43 The first clear indications to most Germans of the continuity of Nazi anti-Semitic policies came in 1933 at the end of the second month of power for Hitler. Hundreds of public officials had already lost their posts because they were anti-Nazi. On March 31, however, Jewish judges in Prussia were dismissed from office specifically because they were Jewish.44 The following day a government-sponsored National Boycott took place. Although officially described as \"relatively peaceful,\" Jewish stores were placarded while brownshirts blocked the doorways, windows were smashed, Jews were beaten up on the street and kept from entering their offices, public libraries, and so on. The police stood by or were simply not to be seen, but the Nazi police \"reinforcements\" patrolled everywhere. The whole operation was in the hands of the wildly anti-Semitic Nazi Julius Streicher and was overseen by the Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels.45 A contemporary and widely publicized indication of Nazi goals involved Albert Einstein. Although he was one of the world's bestknown and most respected scientists, in Germany his outspoken pacifism, internationalism, and Zionism also made him one of the most hated. He was in America when Hitler came to power, and responded to attacks upon him in the Nazi press by declaring his refusal to return to a Nazi-governed Germany. Moreover, he held that the world ought to be made aware of the dangers of National So-\n\n12\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\ncialism.46 When he arrived on the Continent in late March, he avoided Germany and settled in a sea resort near Ostende, Belgium, to await developments. The Nazis reacted to his declarations and actions by seizing his property and subsequently placing a price on his head.47 The day his ship docked, March 28, 1933, Einstein wrote a letter of resignation to the Prussian Academy of Sciences, Germany's most exclusive and prestigious learned society.48 He apparently wished honorably to sever all connection with the German government and to spare his friends in the Academy from having to deal with pressures to dismiss him. But the pressures were already mounting. The Nazi-appointed Prussian minister of education, Bernhard Rust, to whom the Academy was formally responsible, demanded on March 29 that the Academy consider disciplining Einstein for his \"agitation\" against the new German state.49 When Einstein's resignation was received and accepted the next day, the issue appeared to be dead. But on the evening of March 31, just hours before the National Boycott began, the minister expressed an \"urgent wish\" for the Academy to make a public declaration on Einstein.50 Max Planck, Einstein's friend and supporter, was in Sicily on vacation. Another standing secretary, the jurist Ernst Heymann, acceded to Rust's demands and drafted a press release declaring that the Academy was opposed to Einstein's \"atrocity-mongering\" (Greuelhetze) abroad and had \"no reason to regret Einstein's withdrawal.\" 51 The statement appeared on April i. Einstein's name also figured that day in a propaganda speech by Joseph Goebbels: We had allowed international Jewry to be shown a goodwill it did not at all deserve. And what was the Jews' thanks? At home they repented, while out in the world they kindled a lie and atrocity campaign which exceeds even that of the world war. The Jews in Germany can thank the refugees like Einstein for the fact that they themselves are today—completely legitimately and legally—being called to account.52 The scientist's outspoken opposition to National Socialism made his name a synonym for traitor in Germany as long as the Third Reich existed. Despite the events of April i, the Law for the Restoration of the Career Civil Service of April 7, 1933, was unexpected—even some party members were unprepared for it.53 It was designed by the min-\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\n13\n\nistry of interior (at that time run by the Nazi former civil servant Wilhelm Frick) to change the fundamental composition of the state bureaucracy without destroying its effectiveness in administering the affairs of the state.54 The provisions were simple, but devastating: certain civil servants were to be relieved of their duties in order to restore a \"national\" career civil service and simplify the administration. Affected were (i) those without proper qualifications who had taken office since November 9, 1918 (i.e., political appointees); (2) those whose previous political activities did not guarantee that they would at all times unreservedly serve the new state; (3) those of \"non-Aryan\" descent. To simplify the administration, officials could be retired even when they were still capable of service. Also, any official transferred to a new position, even one of inferior rank and pay, had either to accept his new assignment or ask for retirement. The wording of the law left a few loopholes. It was to be temporary, with the provisions to be in effect only until September 30, 1933. In addition, there were exemptions for the non-Aryans as a concession to President Paul von Hindenburg, who insisted that war veterans be treated specially.55 A non-Aryan official could stay in office if (i) he was in office before August i, 1914; (2) he had fought at the front in the war; (3) his father or son had been killed in the war. On April 11, the key question of who was non-Aryan was answered by the first supplement to the law. An official was in the non-Aryan category if he had a Jewish parent or grandparent, and these individuals were assumed to have been Jewish if they practiced the Jewish religion.56 Numerous supplements to the Civil Service Law further explained its application. On May 6, the third supplement explicitly emphasized that all instructors at institutions of higher learning were included as civil servants, even those not on the government payroll, such as Privatdozenten. The provision relating to \"politically unreliable\" persons was expanded. Anyone who had conducted himself in a communist manner was to be dismissed, whether or not he was in any way connected with the Communist party or its organs. In replacing retired or dismissed civil servants, first consideration was to be given to those who had undergone earlier suffering on the basis of their \"nationalist conduct.\" 57 The law was supplemented several times more, and the process of reconstructing the bureaucracy was not completed until 1937-58 A lingering problem related to persons who were part-Jewish.\n\n14\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\nA conflict arose between the party, which wanted to treat them as Jewish, and the state (i.e., civil service), which wanted to treat them as German. The Nuremberg Laws of September 15, 1935, and the supplement of November 14, 1935, were to some extent victories for the bureaucrats.59 A person of mixed descent was considered Jewish if at least three grandparents were Jewish or if two grandparents were Jewish and he or she was a practicing Jew or married to one. These laws affected all Jews in Germany, including university instructors. Quarter-Jewish persons were thus no longer subject to dismissal. The Nuremberg Laws made no provision, however, for exemption based on war service.60 The implementation of the 1933 Civil Service Law and its supplements had immediate and far-reaching consequences for the entire academic community.61 Physics proved to be one of the most heavily affected disciplines, suffering a loss of at least 25 percent of its 1932-33 personnel, including some of the finest scientists in Germany. Gottingen, the scene of the Weimar \"beautiful years/' makes an especially revealing case study of the impact of the dismissal policy on the academic physics community.\n\n2. Gottingen—1933 Since scientists seldom engaged in political activity, it was primarily the non-Aryan clause of the Civil Service Law that had the greatest effect on the physicists and mathematicians. The impact of the new law was particularly severe in Gottingen because the directors of three of the four institutes for physics and mathematics were Jewish —James Franck, Max Born, and Richard Courant. The different courses of action these men chose to follow and the common fate they suffered provide insight into the implementation of the dismissal policy throughout Germany. The responses of their colleagues and pupils also reflected widespread reactions. The result was an exodus of scientific talent unparalleled in recent history, for men like Franck, Born, and Courant were among the best in their fields in Germany, and at that time German science was among the best in the world. PUBLIC PROTEST: JAMES FRANCK Since German university classes met from November through February and May through July, the Civil Service Law of April 7 was announced during the middle of spring break in Gottingen. Most of the students and many of the faculty were away on vacation. The director of the Second Physical Institute, however, was still in the city and thus able immediately to consider the implications of the ordinance. James Franck was as frequently praised for his kindness, integrity, and deep sense of principle as for his talents as a scientist. At the beginning of the war, he had dropped his research and engaged in front-line combat as a volunteer. This action was strictly out of a sense of duty, for the military manner of thinking was entirely foreign to him—the story goes that he was once put in charge of a column of men and gave the order \"Stillgestanden—bitte\" (Come to attention—please).1 But if command formalities were alien to his nature, personal courage was not. Both iron crosses were among his decorations, and he received a commission as an officer even though he was Jewish. His sense of principle became more and more outraged as events of the spring of 1933 unfolded. The front-page story in the nationalist15\n\nl6\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\noriented Gottinger Tageblatt cheered that now unqualified political appointees would be eliminated,2 but the nature of the National Boycott day left no doubt that the anti-Semitic provisions were a major aspect of the Civil Service Law. Franck was undoubtedly well informed of the measures enforced by the Nazis in Berlin on April i, since many of his close friends and his daughter Elizabeth lived in that city. In addition, the newspapers on April i had carried the story of Einstein's resignation from the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Academy's precipitous reply.3 In conversations with his closest friends and co-workers, Franck became more and more determined that something must be done. Under the exemption clauses, he would be spared. But would not accepting exemption be tantamount to sanctioning the government's activities? As director of the institute, he would certainly have to discharge some of his own staff, as well as watch the dismissal of colleagues in other institutes. His resolve was strengthened by actions of the Nazi-dominated student leadership. The students were one of the most vocal forces of National Socialist policy at the universities. On April 13, the German Students Association announced its campaign \"Against the Un-German Spirit,\" which would climax in public book burnings on May 10. Among the pronouncements in the twelve-point declaration were: the Jew could only think Jewish, and when he wrote German he was lying; students should view Jews as aliens, and Jewish works should appear in Hebrew, or at least be designated as translations if they were printed in German; students and professors should be selected \"according to their guarantee of thinking in the German spirit.\" 4 The student law promulgated the same day by the Prussian minister of education restored student self-government, which had been taken away under the Weimar ministry, and restricted membership in student organizations to Aryans only. Quotas for non-Aryans in the German schools soon followed.5 Also on the thirteenth, the first dismissals under the Civil Service Law were announced at half a dozen universities.6 Evenings at Franck's home were consumed in intensive discussion. Many of his friends and colleagues used well-intentioned arguments to try to dissuade him from taking hasty action.7 With his characteristic insight, however, Franck saw that a fundamental issue of principle was at stake. Over Easter weekend, he decided to resign his position in protest. It was a lonely and courageous step. His family today remembers clearly that the final decision was made \"for himself and by himself and nobody else had any part in making it.\" 8\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\n17\n\nOn the eve of his protest, behind the closed doors of his study, a small group helped Franck formulate the text of his letter of resignation. His family recalls among the close friends and assistants present that evening: Hertha Sponer, the chief assistant in Franck's institute; Arthur von Hippel, an assistant who was the husband of Franck's daughter Dagmar; and possibly Heinrich Kuhn, an assistant who would be affected by the non-Aryan provisions of the Civil Service Law.9 The group worked out two documents. One was to the Naziappointed Prussian minister of education, and read simply: Mr. Minister: 17 April With these lines I ask you, Mr. Minister, to release me from my duties as full professor at the University of Gottingen and Director of the Second Physical Institute of this university. This decision is an inner necessity for me because of the attitude of the government toward German Jewry.10 The other was a statement to the rector. Before the evening was out, Franck phoned the Gottinger Zeitung, the second of the city's newspapers, and gave it a portion of this letter. Such public protest appears quite reasonable in retrospect, but at the time it was regarded as highly unusual and was hoped to have a very great impact. \"The whole affair was carefully timed,\" his family recalls, \"so that the receipt of the letters coincided with the publication in the newspapers.\" \" The following day, the newspaper carried these lines from Franck's letter to the rector: I have asked my superior authorities to release me from my office. I will attempt to continue my scientific work in Germany. We Germans of Jewish descent are being treated as aliens and enemies of the Fatherland. It is demanded that our children grow up in the awareness that they will never be allowed to prove themselves as Germans. Whoever was in the war is supposed to receive permission to serve the state further. I refuse to make use of this privilege, even though I also understand the position of those today who consider it their duty to hold out at their posts.12 The newspaper stressed that Franck had no intention of seeking a position abroad as long as he had the opportunity to continue experimental research in Germany. The article pointed out the honors\n\nl8\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\nFranck had won, his war record, the esteem he had brought Gottingen and the economic benefits the city had enjoyed because of his reputation (increased numbers of students and Rockefeller money to expand the buildings of the institute). The writer of the article concluded: Professor Franck's decision is to be evaluated essentially, even exclusively, on moral grounds. We hope and wish that this step, by which Franck has shattered his life's work and meaning, has the effect of retaining for our scientific activity other researchers who, according to the lawful ordinances, will be forced to step down. Otherwise losses could be incurred which could be made good again only after a long time, or even never at all.13 Unfortunately, the warning went unheeded. The sentiment of the Gottinger Zeitung was echoed on the same day in the evening edition of the liberal Vossische Zeitung in Berlin. An article in that paper also expressed hope that Franck's action might lead to a consideration of the implications of recent events for the future. The foreign press quickly picked up the story.14 The Berliner Tageblatt, however, took the view that Franck would have done better to have remained at his post at the institute if he wished to protest Nazi policies.15 Others in Gottingen even suggested to Franck that things were really not so bad. Rudolf Hilsch, Robert Pohl's chief assistant, recalls that when Franck came to say good-bye to everyone, Hilsch admonished the professor with a piece of folk wisdom: \"Es wird nichts so heiss gegessen, wie es gekocht wird\" (nothing is eaten as hot as it is cooked). He was mistaken, Hilsch soon realized.16 Franck had at this time no thought of emigration. In this stand he was encouraged by the Berlin physics leaders Max Planck and Max von Laue.17 When Heinrich Rubens had died in 1922, Franck had been offered the Berlin chair for physics, but he had declined in order to stay in Gottingen. Walther Nernst had been appointed instead. By 1931, plans were already afoot to try to appoint Franck again since Nernst was almost to retire. Fritz Haber indicated to Franck that he might also take over the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics when he succeeded Nernst at the university. Eventually he might direct Haber's own institute after Haber retired in igsG.18 By late 1932, Franck was the leading candidate for the Berlin professorship. In January 1933, he was contacted by the Ministry of\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\nIQ\n\nEducation and asked to come to Berlin for preliminary negotiations,19 but the process was interrupted by the political upheaval. Even so, the possibility that Franck would be able to continue his scientific work in Germany in some capacity outside the civil service was still quite real—or so at least it must have seemed to him. Immediately following the publication of Franck's letter, however, rumors began to circulate in Gottingen. It was reported that Franck and those who had participated in discussions with him had conspired to hinder the national revolution. Using the argument that the foreign press had been able to turn his protest into antiGerman propaganda, forty-two instructors at the university issued a condemnation of Franck's action. The medical faculty and the agricultural institute were especially heavily represented in this group, while only one signatory was in mathematics or physics.20 The charge was that Franck's public resignation had impeded both the domestic and foreign policy of the new government. \"We are unanimously agreed,\" stated the signatories, \"that the form of the above declaration of resignation is equivalent to an act of sabotage, and we hope that the government will therefore accelerate the realization of the necessary cleansing measures/' 21 Two days later, the Gottingen press curtly announced that on April 25 six university professors had been placed on leave by the Prussian Ministry of Education: Professors Honig (criminal law), Bondy (social psychology), Bernstein (statistics), Born, Courant, and Noether. The subtitle of the article was ominous: \"More will follow.\" 22 PASSIVE PROTEST: MAX BORN Unlike Franck, Born did not wish to remain in Germany. \"We decided after my 'placement on leave/ \" he wrote later, \"to leave Germany immediately.\" 23 At the beginning of May, he and his wife left with their son for the mountains of northern Italy, where they had planned to rent a place for the summer vacation. The reasons for Born's quick departure can be traced to his personality, health, and the events of the Weimar period. The Einstein-Born correspondence reveals Born as a man sensitive to the currents of his times even as he tried to isolate himself from them. In his political views and attitude toward human relationships, he indicates, he was in agreement with his friend Einstein.24 But his aversion to publicity and public debate was even stronger than Ein-\n\n20\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\nstein's. His personality, which one of his assistants remembers as \"noble and reserved,\" was largely responsible.25 Born himself explained that he still believed in the \"quiet temple of learning.\" 26 In the early Weimar days, Born was willing to support Einstein openly against the anti-Semitic opponents of relativity theory, especially at the Nauheim convention of German scientists and doctors in ig2o.27 But it was against his nature to do so. And when a possibility arose in 1922 to bring his old roommate and friend Theodor von Karman to Gottingen, he did not push the candidacy. It had not been easy to get Franck appointed the previous year. Now Born took one look at the number of Jews who were already professors in the faculty of mathematics and natural science (Courant, Edmund Landau, Felix Bernstein, Franck, and himself) and another look at the opposition (primarily the people in the agricultural institute), and decided that he could not face the fight necessary to add another Jew to the staff.28 In addition, Born's health was frail. He always seemed to suffer seriously from head colds and asthma in the fall.29 The famous picture of the participants in the Solvay conference in Brussels (October 1927) reveals him, alone among many men several years his senior, wearing a heavy overcoat and muffler. During the exacting 1925-27 period, he had exhausted himself, and the resultant nervous breakdown interrupted his work for about a year in ig28-29.30 He spent some time in a sanatorium on the shore of Lake Constance. At first, he was confined to bed, but once he was up and around, he found that the other patients—all representatives of \"the good middle class\"—talked about almost nothing except Hitler and their hopes concerning him, with spicy anti-Semitic asides. \"That,\" Born has written, \"drove me back into my room.\" 31 He dreaded his year as dean of the faculty in 1931-32. Even before his term began, he was planning on the need for recuperation afterward. His hope was to go to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena for the winter of 1932-33, even though he admitted that the situation in physics had changed in the last five years and he could no longer offer the Americans anything \"really new.\" 32 The trip never materialized. The year lived up to his darkest expectations. The worst problem was that the government, hard-pressed by the depression, tried to save funds by dismissing a percentage of the assistants. Born led a successful movement to have the natural science faculty voluntarily\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\n21\n\ndesignate about 10 percent of each professor's income to provide livelihood for the young people. Most of the faculty agreed readily, but a minority, consisting primarily of the agricultural personnel, objected with a prolonged hatefulness the likes of which, Born wrote, he had never before seen.33 Undoubtedly they did not relish donating part of their pay to what they apparently considered a Jewish clique in the mathematics and physics institutes. With his strong feelings about anti-Semitism, Born had no love for the Nazis. In 1932, the theoretician Friedrich Hund and Born were riding on a train northbound out of Gottingen. The train stopped briefly in one of the smaller towns of Brunswick, an area which supported the Nazis rather early. The swastika flags were already in place on the flagpoles at the station. Hund remembers that Born nodded toward them and declared that when those flags flew over all of Germany, he would leave.34 With this general disposition and the toll of the year of his deanship on Bern's emotional and physical health, it is clear that he would hardly be up to an open fight to hold his post. After he had recovered somewhat from the asthma attacks brought on by the tension and ferment of the weeks preceding his departure, Born informed the curator of the university that he fully shared Franck's position and wanted no special treatment. What Franck had said in his resignation was also valid for Born himself as a German Jew, even if, as the curator had seemed to imply in a letter to Born, he were to be reinstated.35 In a letter to Einstein a week later, Born indicated that he now found himself feeling his Jewishness quite strongly, a feeling he had not been particularly aware of before. Oppression and injustice had aroused rage and resistance in him.36 Although Born had briefly considered remaining at his post, once he made up his mind to resign, his decision was final. He never attempted to return to Nazi Germany and fight to stay on at Gottingen. Instead he turned his back upon a homeland that no longer desired his services. He wrote to Einstein that Franck was staying in Gottingen in the impossible attempt to find something in Germany. As for himself: \"I wouldn't have the nerves for it, also see no sense in it.\" 37 Born began to cast about for a position abroad so that he could continue his scientific work. By July, when the English physicist F. A. Lindemann (later Lord Cherwell, Churchill's scientific adviser) came to Italy to try to win him for Oxford, Born had already\n\n22\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\naccepted a post at Cambridge.38 He was prominent enough to be tendered offers at a number of schools even in the middle of the depression. For emigrants lacking his reputation, the future looked bleak. Surveying the situation, Einstein wrote to Born: \"My heart aches when I think of the young ones.\" 39 QUIET PROTEST: RICHARD COURANT Franck had resigned publicly, and Born had emigrated silently. But the result was in both cases essentially the same: each man to some extent played into Nazi hands and removed himself from the scene. Courant, however, was determined not to give up his post without a stiff fight. He was supported by many of his friends, pupils, and associates. His publisher, Ferdinand Springer, was especially quick to approve Courant's intention to hold out.40 Two days after his name appeared in the paper, on April 28, 1933, Courant wrote a letter to his former assistant Hellmuth Kneser. It is a deeply revealing document, for it is apparent that Courant was still stunned as he tried to fathom what had happened and why. In regard to Franck's resignation, he explained: Franck had, before I returned from vacation, come more and more firmly to the conclusion that he should voluntarily resign. Neugebauer [Courant's chief assistant] and I, and also other friends, restrained him again and again, and forced him to postpone doing it. One day, I believe on Easter Sunday, Franck's decision was made, against our initial wishes. We, that is, Born and I, considered for a short while whether we were morally bound to follow Franck. We decided instead, however, to attempt to stay and to support our establishments here with all of our powers. A completely perverted version of this affair was spread by rumors and garbled nonsense, namely that Franck's resignation was the result of a joint sabotage resolution, and that we had pushed Franck forward solely for tactical reasons. This grotesque version induced a relatively small group of Gottingen colleagues to come out with a public declaration against Franck's resignation and with a call for a quick cleansing of the university. Our forced leave came the day after the publication of this declaration. I could imagine that the state of affairs I have described precipitated the steps taken by the ministry.41\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\n23\n\nMembers of Courant's institute remember that the possibility of a mass resignation was raised. Otto Neugebauer recalls that mass action was considered during the discussions in Franck's home by Franck, Born, Courant, and Weyl. (Weyl was not Jewish, but his wife was.) Such a dramatic move would have evoked memories of the famous \"Gottingen Seven,\" a group of professors who had defended academic prerogatives against the state in the nineteenth century.42 Herbert Busemann, who was not directly involved in the discussions, recollects that one reason a mass resignation did not materialize was that the principals could not agree upon a specific event as a focus for their protest.43 This lack of decision was one of the crucial results of the Nazi tactic of legality, which cast opposition in the role of unlawfulness and moral wrong, making unity among persons such as the Gottingen professors almost impossible. And disunity in the face of Nazi determination was disastrous. Despite Courant's impression, it seems doubtful that Franck's resignation was directly responsible for the dismissal of Born and Courant. At the most, the resignation probably triggered actions that had already been planned. Kurt Daluege (Nazi-appointed Prussian minister of police) had on March 12 already received the list of professors of Jewish ancestry which very likely formed the basis for the dismissal announcement of April 25 in Gottingen. Born, Courant, and Noether were included, but not Franck, whom the Nazis had apparently intended to leave at his post.44 Courant's April 28 letter to Kneser stated that he had as yet received no official written information on his status. But as an active participant in the war, he wrote, as a severely wounded front-line infantry officer, he had no reason to expect that he would be affected by the Civil Service Law. Perhaps political charges were being leveled against him, since he had briefly been a Social Democratic party city councilman in Gottingen right after the war. But his views were not really Marxist at all, and he had shortly thereafter left the party. Perhaps the charges were related to the fact that at the very end of the war he had been elected to a soldiers' council (which was modeled after those of the Russian Revolution) by his small detachment. But he had simply led his men in their assigned task of disbanding in orderly fashion. In the past months, he continued, such matters had been dredged up to create totally perverted rumors about his past. In addition, the science faculty—especially the mathematical institute—was dis-\n\n24\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\nliked \"purely instinctively\" by many groups in Gottingen. There was also jealousy that he had so conspicuously expanded the mathematical and physical institutes with foreign money. Counteracting these attitudes and tales was difficult. \"There has arisen an atmosphere of rumors,\" he declared, \"assertions which never quite reach us clearly, and which have culminated in the slogan 'Stronghold of Marxism/ \" 4 5 What did he intend to do? He felt he must not let himself succumb to bitterness, that he must attempt to stay as long as possible and try to continue his scientific work. He still hoped that he would be given the chance to respond to the charges against him, whatever they might be.46 The tempo of events accelerated swiftly, and on the very next day, April 29, Courant wrote Kneser again. The German Students Association had not only kept Landau, Hilbert's Jewish assistant Paul Bernays, and others from lecturing, it had extended its campaign to include Neugebauer, charging that he was a communist. It threatened boycott action, and Courant feared Neugebauer might relinquish the acting directorship of the institute even if the threat were withdrawn. Weyl did not seem inclined to take over, leaving only the professor of applied mathematics Gustav Herglotz. Personality conflicts and friction were also mounting within the institute itself. And the rumors continued to multiply. Now it was charged that Courant had trooped around with a red flag during the revolution, or that he had disarmed homeward-bound regiments at the end of the war, or that he had been a member of the Independent Socialist party. The entire work of the past decades—and more—seemed to be disintegrating. Courant observed sorrowfully, \"I am very much afraid—quite aside from my own person—that something irreversible is happening.\" 47 On May 2, Courant sent a letter to Abraham Flexner of the Institute for Advanced Study about his fears for the Gottingen institute. Neugebauer had already received his walking papers—though from the dean and not from the ministry. Perhaps, Courant inquired, it might be possible to arrange positions in America for himself and his chief assistant? In the meantime, both would try to continue their scientific work.48 What else could one do? Even when the official written notification arrived on May 5, it did not state formal reasons for Courant's release from office. It simply declared that he was placed on leave as\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\n25\n\nof May 2 under the law of April 7, that this leave was to be observed in every university-related activity, and that, until further notice, his pay would be continued.49 In talking with the head of the science section of the Prussian Ministry of Education, the mathematician Theodor Vahlen, Kneser was dismayed to find Vahlen under the impression that Courant was, of all things, a Zionist.50 Here was still another rumor. A number of Courant's former pupils attempted to help combat the hydra by writing letters to the ministry on their own, stressing that he gave no preference in his institute to Jews (another charge), that he was extremely patriotic, that he had brought financial advantages to Germany during difficult times, and so forth.51 Others, particularly Neugebauer and Kurt Friedrichs, who was at the Brunswick Institute of Technology, decided to submit a petition on Courant's behalf. The text stressed the financial benefits that Courant had brought to Gottingen and Germany, his esteem as a scholar, his outstanding success as a teacher, and his correctness in refusing to lower himself by publicly challenging the rumors in Gottingen: \"true to the old law of the Prussian civil service, that a Prussian official is to defend himself against the accusations and rumors of outsiders not by words, but strictly by means of the propriety of his actions.\" 52 Among the signers were Planck, von Laue, and Schrodinger from Berlin; Sommerfeld from Munich; Heisenberg and Hund from Leipzig; former assistants and associates Emil Artin, Erich Bessel-Hagen, Franz Rellich, Helmut Hasse. There were twenty-eight names in all. The petition was turned in by midJune. Significantly, the man who was asked to present the document to the curator was not a pure scientist or mathematician, but the Gottingen aerodynamics expert Ludwig Prandtl.53 Prandtl's Institute for Applied Mechanics with its famous wind tunnel was quite different from the mathematical and physical institutes on Bunsen Street. There were people in the latter institutes who deprecated the former, even though everyone was aware of the import of Prandtl's pioneering work in aerodynamics and fluid flow. Courant, for example, tells a story about Landau, who had an abiding contempt for anything even remotely applied. Prandtl once wrote a paper on grease and oil and their lubricating function in certain engineering problems. Landau was always careful to avoid such messy items, and whenever someone said something that reminded him of applied work, he would declare, \"Ah, Schmierol!\" (grease!) 54\n\n26\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\nNow, however, and for the duration of the Third Reich, the theoreticians had dire need of support from men engaged in such practical pursuits. Even before he handed in the Courant petition, Prandtl had talked formally with the curator about the dismissal of Gottingen scientists.55 He had also come into conflict with National Socialists in his institute. In a political report written on him in 1934, it was claimed that not only did he mistreat one of his co-workers specifically because of the man's Nazi and anti-Semitic views, but he deliberately promoted a Jew to assistant in April 1933, even though an equally qualified National Socialist was available.56 But the highest Nazi leaders recognized the importance of aviation, and Prandtl was a noted authority in the field. His position in Gottingen was a strong one. The Gottinger Tageblatt had run a major article in June 1933 that commented how fortunate it was that Prandtl had not accepted a call to Munich in igss.57 Eventually, the writer of the 1934 report was forced to back down even though his charges against Prandtl were undisputed.58 Even Prandtl's efforts were in vain. It was also of no avail when Prandtl, Friedrichs, and Kneser sent a request directly to Berlin that they be heard on Courant's behalf.59 Although his former assistants continued throughout the summer to try to get someone to listen to their refutation of the rumors, Courant was tiring of the struggle. He had at first declined offers from abroad, explaining to the curator that he did not want to do anything which could be construed as a political demonstration on the part of a dismissed German professor.60 Everything was to be done quietly through channels, even the petition. Freidrichs recollects that, When the petition was submitted, all of those concerned with it—and Courant himself—expected that Courant would stay if he were reinstated. In the meantime he had come to realize that this reinstatement was pointless, since as a Jew he would have to leave Germany anyway.61 Courant once explained his change of heart poignantly: \"I saw now that there was nothing sensible left to do but emigrate. My youngest son did not seem able to understand why he should not be in the Hitler Youth, too.\" 62 In late August 1933, Courant accepted a post in Cambridge. In order to avoid the Reich emigration tax, which had been originally\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\n27\n\ndesigned in 1931 to stem the flow of marks out of Germany during the depression, he threaded his way through mazes of paperwork in order to be regarded as working abroad \"in the German interest'' while \"on leave.\" 63 In this way, he hoped to retain some portion of his money and possessions. The situation was complicated by the fact that on October 20 Courant was finally notified that he was not affected by the Civil Service Law. His leave was therefore lifted.64 By this time, he was already packing for England, and ironically had to request hurriedly a voluntary leave in order to embark during the first week of November.65 Born's placement on leave was also lifted in October, at the same time he was granted leave to Cambridge.66 It seems clear that the government policy was to place everyone potentially affected by the Civil Service Law on leave, and then sort out the exemptions later. But by that time, many of these persons had already left, like Born, or were planning to leave, like Courant. This exodus appears to have been the Nazi goal from the beginning. Thus Courant's judgment was correct, yet holding out at one's post was infinitely more difficult than he anticipated. The silent, inscrutable workings of the bureaucracy became an unbeatable foe. In the end, a public resignation was perhaps the most effective course of action after all. The widespread acceptance of the legality of the Nazi revolution made protest within government service self-defeating. One was faced with the contradictory position of protesting the illegality of the law, a concept which might make sense in Anglo-Saxon countries but did not in Germany. The key to the whole dismissal policy was the civil service itself, particularly men like the Gottingen curator. In reading correspondence between him and Franck, Born, and Courant, one gets the very clear impression that emotionally he was on their side and wished them well. However, he maintained his professional reserve and carried out the revolution for the Nazis. \"Do you believe that the German middle class . . . would refuse to serve us and place their minds at our disposal?\" Hitler had asked when interviewed in 1931. He was right. THE INSTITUTES The loss of Franck, Born, and Courant was a disaster for Gottingen. But heavy as this toll was, it did not end there. Many more members of the institutes were relieved of their duties, while others left of their own volition. Because the role of the director was crucial, the\n\n28\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\nheadless institutes could produce very little work even though some of the personnel remained. And the entire dismissal process generated an oppressive sense of hopelessness. Born's assistant Lothar Nordheim remembers that it was clear that those dismissed would have to leave Germany, and that their main concern was simply how to do so: \"Intermixed with this was despair about the end of freedom and the termination of the intellectual and artistic flowering in Germany during the iggos.\" 67 The \"beautiful years\" had come to an end. Robert Pohl, whose institute did not employ any Jews and was thus unaffected by the dismissal policy, tried to administer what was left of the Gottingen physics program. Franck never returned to his institute after resigning, and his assistants—Sponer, von Hippel, Kuhn, Kroebel, and Giinther Cario—took care of the students and the laboratory work.68 One of the few bright spots during this time was the seminar which Franck held in his home. Nordheim recalls that the purpose of the sessions was largely \"to solace ourselves with our ideas on physics and discuss our progress in finding jobs outside Germany.\" 69 Kroebel has written that these meetings led to closer ties among the participants, because \"each individual had at that time much to give which was imponderable, but humanly significant.\" 70 This result was characteristic of the influence of Franck's personality. The first of Franck's staff to leave was Eugene Rabinowitch, his personal assistant. As a newly naturalized Russian Jew, Rabinowitch quickly lost both his stipend from the Emergency Association of German Science and his citizenship. Shortly after Franck's resignation, he left for Copenhagen, where he had been invited by Bohr to work for a year.71 He then moved to England, and in 1938 came to America. During the war he worked on the Manhattan Project, and later he emerged as one of the guiding forces of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a journal concerned with the relationships between science and politics and science and society. Kuhn was also forced to leave Gottingen. He accepted an offer from Lindemann to go to Oxford, and Pohl granted his request for release from his duties as assistant in late July.72 During the war, he contributed to the atomic bomb project in Great Britain. Von Hippel was not affected by the Civil Service Law, but as Franck's son-in-law he chose to abandon Gottingen as well. He embarked in mid-October for Istanbul, where nearly one hundred German tech-\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\n2Q\n\nnicians, physicians, economists, and other specialists found positions with Ataturk's newly founded university.73 He returned to northern Europe to work at Copenhagen at the beginning of 1935, and ultimately settled in 1936 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Sponer was also unaffected by the law, but her professional ties were to the Franck circle, which was now disintegrating. In addition, as a female university instructor, she clearly did not represent the Nazi image of womanhood, and her academic future in Germany appeared dismal. In 1934 she accepted a position at Oslo, and in 1936 she went to Duke University. Only Giinther Cario and Werner Kroebel remained in Gottingen's Second Physical Institute. Born's institute suffered even more than Franck's, for its staff was totally dispersed by the new law. It was charged against Born that his institute was communist infected.74 This charge was untrue. However, the Russian physicist Georg Rumer had worked in the institute for a time, and both Walter Heitler and Nordheim, the two assistants, had recently visited the Soviet Union. Nordheim had in fact been there from autumn 1932 until January 1933. For him, it was a traumatic experience to arrive fresh from one dictatorship and find himself facing the onset of another one.75 Nordheim's experiences during the dismissal process were probably very typical for junior faculty members. On April 28, 1933, two days after Born and Courant found their names in the newspaper, Nordheim received a polite notice from the dean of the faculty (not from the curator or the Ministry of Education) \"recommending\" that he not exercise his right to teach until his case had been decided by the ministry.76 During the summer, in addition to attending the seminar with Franck, he had been able to continue his research. He and the other theorists had no need of laboratory facilities.77 On September 11, a curt form letter from the ministry notified him that his right to teach had been revoked. On the twentieth came word from the curator's office that his position as assistant would terminate on October 31. By early October he had left Gottingen to take up a research associateship in Paris, where Rockefeller funds supported his work with Leon Brillouin.78 Eventually, like Sponer, he went to Duke University, and today lives in California. Edward Teller held a position in Arnold Eucken's institute for physical chemistry in Gottingen, and had been working with Born on the latter's book on optics.79 Although Eucken did not dismiss\n\n30\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\nhim, he recommended that Teller leave the country soon. After a year in Copenhagen on a Rockefeller fellowship, he went to work with F. G. Donnan at the University College in London for another year. He still remembers with particular gratitude the consideration with which refugees were treated in Britain.80 In 1935 he moved to America, where both he and Nordheim were actively engaged in the Manhattan Project. Heitler, Born's chief assistant, also left the country in the fall of 1933. There was a standing arrangement for one of Born's postdoctoral pupils to spend a year at the laboratory of Lennard-Jones in Bristol. Martin Stobbe was in Bristol during the 1932-33 year, and, since he was not Jewish, he and Heitler exchanged places for the coming year.81 Later Heitler moved to Dublin's new Advanced Institute with Erwin Schrodinger, and finally settled in Zurich. During the summer semester, since Heitler and Nordheim, as nonAryans, were not allowed to lecture, Pohl asked the young astronomer Otto Heckmann to hold the theoretical classes. With Born's agreement, Heckmann accepted the task.82 Upon his return from Bristol, Stobbe delivered the winter semester lectures. His conscience could not be reconciled with the demands of the government, however. He resigned, destroying his academic career in Germany, and left for America. Hermann Weyl, to whom Stobbe came in Princeton, attempted in vain to help the young man find a position. Weyl concluded: Under trying circumstances he showed an unusual firmness of character and courage without adopting in the least a provocative attitude, and won the esteem and admiration of all men in Gottingen who had preserved their independence of mind.83 There were very few positions available, and Stobbe had not yet had time to make a name for himself. He shifted to England in 1936 for a year and then found a temporary position in Oslo. With all the uncertainty and relocations, he never managed to finish his book on aspects of quantum mechanics. He apparently died during World War II.84 Three of the members of the mathematical institute had just returned from studies in Italy, and they had no desire to remain in a German environment so similar to Mussolini's Fascism. All three were Jewish and although anti-Semitism was not part of Italian Fascism then, they had gotten a taste of what life under National\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\n31\n\nSocialism would be like.85 Two of these men, Hans Lewy and Herbert Busemann, went on a trip to Italy after Hitler came to power. There Busemann advised Lewy, who was an assistant to Courant, to leave Germany because Lewy would be unable to keep quiet. During the early part of the spring semester break Lewy left Gottingen, stopping first in Paris, where he lived on what little he had been able to save. It was there that he received notice that he had been suspended from his teaching duties. He managed to obtain a position at Brown University for the fall and arrived in Rhode Island practically penniless.86 Later he moved on to the University of California at Berkeley. Werner Fenchel, the third member of the trio, had spent some time in Copenhagen prior to 1933, and he was now able to secure a position in Denmark. From there he helped his friend Busemann to emigrate as well. Since Busemann's family was wealthy, Courant had prevailed upon him to work within the institute without salary. Busemann thus had no position at stake during the dismissal crisis. Although Weyl, who thought that something might still be salvaged, tried to prevail upon him to stay, Busemann left for Copenhagen in early May.87 Although Fenchel remained in Denmark, Busemann later followed the path of so many others to America. Paul Bernays, Hilbert's personal assistant for more than a decade, was released because he was non-Aryan, but Hilbert kept him on for a time at his own expense.88 In 1934, Bernays found a position in Zurich. Also dismissed as non-Aryan was Paul Hertz, a titular extraordinary professor in theoretical physics who received a small salary through a bookkeeping device called the \"mathematicalphysical seminar,\" which never met but provided a few assistantships. With his wife and four children, Hertz went back to his hometown of Hamburg and continued his work on statistical mechanics. Before emigrating to America in 1938 (he died there in 1940), he managed to give a few short lecture courses in Geneva and Prague through the aid of an American committee set up to help dismissed academicians.89 As noted earlier, Neugebauer, who was not Jewish, was attacked as a communist. Since he refused to give evidence of his loyalty to the new government, he lasted only one day as director of the institute.90 Undoubtedly the help of Niels Bohr's brother Harald, a mathematician, enabled him to reach Copenhagen, where he spent the next four years, eventually emigrating to America. Neugebauer had no communist affiliation, but another assistant,\n\n32\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\nRudolf Liineburg, was associated with Leonhard Nelson's leftist philosophical circle. Through the aid of a friend, he left Germany to work with the American Optical Company.91 Of the personnel suspended from the three institutes under discussion, only Neugebauer, Liineburg, and Liineburg's friend and fellow assistant Heinrich Heesch were so-called Aryans. It is not clear what charges were leveled against Heesch, who was dismissed by Erhard Tornier, the Nazi functionary who temporarily directed the institute after everyone had left in the fall of 1Q33.92 A 1934 report referred unfavorably to his friendship with Liineburg and Prandtl's dismissed assistants Willy Prager and Kurt-Heinrich Hohenemser. Research funds with which he hoped to work were denied him, since the ministry declared his continuation in academia unacceptable in advance.93 He did not return to university life until after the war was over. Emmy Noether was both Jewish and a convinced pacifist who had sided with the Social Democrats in the early days of the Weimar republic.94 She quickly lost her right to teach and her small salary. Weyl later indicated something of her gentle and upright character during this period when he wrote: \"her courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spirit, were, in the midst of all the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace.\" After Neugebauer had rejected the directorship of the institute, Weyl had assumed it for a short time. \"I suppose/' he continued, there could hardly have been in any other case such a pile of enthusiastic testimonials filed with the Ministerium as was sent in on her behalf. At that time we really fought; there was still hope left that the worst could be warded off. It was in vain.95 Even after she left Gottingen for Bryn Mawr, Noether displayed no trace of bitterness or malice. She even went back to Gottingen to work independently for a time in the summer of 1934. (She died in 1935-)96 Weyl himself, whose wife was Jewish, eventually chose to depart from Gottingen. At the end of the summer semester, he went to Switzerland for a rest. While there he decided to accept an offer to join Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study. His resignation in Gottingen was effective as of the end of the year.97 There was hardly anyone left in Gottingen to teach the winter semester classes. Landau, who had been a civil servant since before\n\nGOTTINGEN\n\n1933\n\n33\n\nthe deadline of August i, 1914, had not been dismissed. In contrast to nearly all those around him, he was at first very optimistic about the future of the Jews under the Nazis.98 He had long held the Zionist view that Germans and Jews were better off as two recognizably separate races.\" Although his classes had been disrupted at the opening of the summer semester, he began to lecture in the fall. There was an uproar among the National Socialist students, however, and the demonstrations and boycott they incited forced Landau, too, to resign.100 He returned to Berlin, where he died in 1938. The mathematical institute seemed empty. Only Gustav Herglotz and Courant's assistant Franz Rellich were left to carry on the Gottingen tradition. During his long illness in the 19205, Hilbert had received a blood transfusion from Courant, so the joke went that there was only one Aryan mathematician in all of Gottingen, and in his veins flowed Jewish blood. By the end of 1933, the joke was no longer amusing. As shown in table i, the institutes which had contributed so much to physics and mathematics during the Weimar period had thus been largely destroyed by the end of the first year of Nazi power. Although the First Physical Institute was unscathed, the Second had lost its director and half its staff. There was nothing left of Born's theoretical physics institute. Three of the four professors of mathematics and almost all the younger faculty had left Gottingen. Other institutes connected with physics and mathematics in Gottingen had also suffered losses, such as Edward Teller's exit from Eucken's physical chemistry institute and Willy Prager's and Kurt-Heinrich Hohenemser's departure from Prandtl's aerodynamics institute. Felix Bernstein, for example, was forced out of his institute for statistics, and the world-renowned mineralogist Viktor M. Goldschmidt was also driven to emigrate. Although the destruction took several months to complete, the major portion of the Gottingen structure of tradition and achievement had been demolished during just a few weeks in April and May. All else was aftermath: the velocity of the events of the early spring was vastly different from the pace of the frustrating summer months. Although their motives and actions were diverse, all paths taken by the Gottingen professors—whether public, passive, or quiet protest—led to the same result: emigration. The younger Jewish scholars had no option but to cast about for a position and follow the professors into exile. There is a well-known story that Hilbert once found himself\n\nTABLE i The Impact of the Dismissals\n\nOO\n\n^\n\nMathematical Institute Administrative Director: Richard Courant (-f) Directors: David Hilbert Edmund Landau (+) Gustav Herglotz Hermann Weyl Chief Assistant: Otto Neugebauer Regular Assistant: Hans Lewy (+) Temporary Assistants: Franz Rellich Werner Weber Heinrich Heesch Rudolf Liineburg Mathematical-Physical Seminar Temporary Assistants: Paul Bernays (+) Paul Hertz (+) Wilhelm Cauer Werner Fenchel (+) [Herbert Busemann (+)] [Contract to teach algebra: Emmy Noether (+)]\n\nMathematical Institute Administrative Director: xx Directors: David Hilbert\n\nFirst Physical Institute Director: Robert W.

Hans Schemm and Bernhard Rust were the two most important figures in these positions. An examination of their views on the dismissal policy and the question of objective scholarship is particularly useful, because Schemm espoused a strongly ideological line, while Rust usually took professional considerations into account. Hans Schemm was an energetic former elementary school teacher who in 1929 had founded the National Socialist Teachers' League (Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund). In late 1932 he had become district party boss of his native region in northeastern Bavaria. He continued to head the Teachers' League, and meanwhile exercised his flair for extremist rhetoric as editor of the National Socialist\n\n52\n\nTHE GOVERNMENT AND THE PHYSICS PROFESSORIATE\n\nteachers' newspaper (Nationalsozialistische Lehrerzeitung). In March 1 933» he was one of the Nazis who assumed a post in the Bavarian government as it fell into National Socialist hands, becoming Bavarian state minister for instruction and culture. Schemm's position on practically every issue was radically ideological. His stand on the role of. Jews in German education and the categorical tone of his speeches are both revealed in this excerpt: It is ridiculous to believe that racial foreigners could be allowed to teach German children. Racial foreigners lack instinctive racial sureness in the selection of sustenance . . . only German persons can be teachers among the German people.2 His views on objective scholarship were no less extreme. He wanted to eliminate all attempts judiciously to weigh various sides of a question in the classroom, for he believed that the Nazi precepts of race, Volk, community, and the dictates of the party were the sole criteria for scholarly work. He stated the essence of his position on this issue in a speech before a meeting of Munich professors, during which he reportedly declared: From now on, the question for you is not to determine whether something is true, but to determine whether it is in the spirit of the National Socialist revolution.3 Such views were typical among the ideological purists within the Nazi party. The more moderate Bernhard Rust had also been a teacher. He had joined in right-wing, volkisch activities in the early 19208, and his steadfast loyalty to Hitler as the chosen leader of the volkisch movement had provided valuable support from northern Germany when Hitler had needed it.4 Since March 1925, Rust had been party boss of South Hannover-Brunswick, an area which had produced strong pro-Nazi returns in pre-igsg elections. His reward came just days after Hitler's ascent to power. On February 4, he was appointed Prussian minister of education. Rust gave his views on objective scholarship and the dismissal policy during a speech at the university in Berlin on May 6, 1933.5 Although he declared that all intellectual endeavor was to take place within a nationalist framework, he also made the ambiguous remark that \"without intellectual freedom and intellectual competition, we will not open the pathway to Germany's rise, but seal it\n\nTHE GOVERNMENT AND THE PHYSICS PROFESSORIATE\n\n53\n\noff.\" 6 Those who feared strict Nazi control of scholarly endeavor could perceive a ray of hope in this assertion. On the other hand, Nazis like Schemm, who felt that free competition had been stifled by Nazi opponents during the Weimar period, were able to interpret Rust's declaration as an indictment of Jewish influence in academia. This type of equivocal comment was very characteristic of Rust. Other statements in this speech made it clear that Rust desired to stress the role of teaching rather than research. Like Schemm and other Nazis, by \"teaching\" Rust meant leadership in the lecture hall and laboratory on behalf of the new German Reich. Rust, however, held that both teaching and research were vital university tasks. He explained that the number of scholarly publications was not to be the only standard by which an institution would be measured,7 but he left the clear implication that it would remain one of the criteria. In his emphasis on teaching, Rust's greatest concern was the gap between the outlook of the professors and that of the National Socialist students: My dear professors, in these years when this un-German state and its un-German leadership obstructed the path of the German students, you, in your professorial isolation and devotion to your great research work, did not take note of the fact that the young sought in you the leaders of the German nation. The young were marching, but gentlemen, you were not at their head.8 The need to close this gap was one justification the Nazis made for the elimination of Jewish and anti-Nazi professors. In expressing his affirmation of the dismissal policy, Rust took specific issue with Haber's letter of resignation: I wish in no way to blame the gentlemen of non-Aryan descent for trying instinctively to attract Privatdozenten and assistants who are more closely related to them by blood. But I cannot allow it. And if a well-known professor of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute wrote me yesterday that he could not agree in any way to allow conditions to be set on the composition of the research unit which he founded, then I must say: I am not qualified to refuse to carry out the law of the German people as expressed by the Reich government. We must have a new Aryan generation at the universities, or else we will lose the future.9\n\n54\n\nTHE GOVERNMENT AND THE PHYSICS PROFESSORIATE\n\nThe volkisch views expressed in this passage permeated all of Rust's thought. It was clear that he agreed with the dismissal policy as one tactic in the reconstitution of the universities and institutes. Yet his response to Haber showed that he was disinclined to assume responsibility for that policy. It was very typical for Rust to say that he was \"not qualified to refuse\" to carry out the prescribed measures, rather than aggressively to defend or claim credit for them. This characteristic lack of forcefulness was largely responsible for the fact that he remained one of the least powerful highly placed Nazis throughout the Third Reich. Another result was that the Ministry of Education became a bewildering battleground of rival Nazi factions. Rust's equivocation was further illustrated in his next comment: Personally, I deeply feel the tragedy of persons who inwardly want to consider themselves part of the German Volk community and work within it. Nothing is more bitter to me than when I have to set my name to the dismissal of men who as individuals have often given me absolutely no occasion to do so. But the principle must be carried out for the sake of the future.1"
