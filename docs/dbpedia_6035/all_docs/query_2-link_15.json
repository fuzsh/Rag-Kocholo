In the meantime, Lenard, support-\n\ned by Stark, laid the groundwork for the Aryan physics movement, whose followers later\n\nlooked up to Lenard as their revered leader, precisely as Weyland had\n\npredicted.[66]\n\nVI\n\nAccompanied by Born, Einstein left Bad Nauheim with a sense of relief that his ordeal was\n\nfinally\n\nover.[67]\n\nBoth realized nevertheless that a deep rift had opened within the German\n\nphysics community. Reporting to Felix Klein, Born remarked that “after the Nauheim dis-\n\ncussions one cannot gloss over the fact that there exists a southern German particularism in\n\nphysics, whose spokesmen are Wien and\n\nStark.”[68]\n\nBorn and several other physicists had\n\nwithdrawn from Stark’s new Professional Association of German University Docents of\n\nPhysics (Fachgemeinschaft Deutscher Hochschullehrer der Physik) because of the adver-\n\nsarial stance Stark had taken toward the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.\n\nAlthough badly outnumbered, German anti-relativists continued to promote their cause.\n\nLenard rehashed his debate with Einstein in Lenard 1921a. He not only defended his cri-\n\ntique of general relativity, but also attacked the German press for misleading its readers with\n\nregard to British claims that their scientists had confirmed Einstein’s theory. “The German\n\npress,” he asserted, “should have avoided the impression, which can only be described as\n\npuzzling to the expert, that our science was dependent on the judgement of the English. For\n\nthe fact that those who observed the solar eclipse were Englishmen has nothing to do with\n\njudging the\n\nresults.”[69]\n\nLenard brought out his old ether theory (Lenard 1910), which he tried to salvage by in-\n\ntroducing the notion of a “primal ether” (“Uräther”) in Lenard 1921b. He also tried to\n\nundermine the empirical support for general relativity in Lenard 1921c by republishing ex-\n\ncerpts from the long-forgotten Soldner 1801, which predicted the bending of light in the\n\n[64]Gehrcke later described Weyland as one of the many “dubious types” to emerge from the revo-\n\nlutionary, postwar big city (Ernst Gehrcke to Philipp Lenard, 3 February 1921, quoted in Schönbeck\n\n2000, p. 26).\n\n[65]Gehrcke 1924a, pp. 74–77.\n\n[66]Beyerchen 1977, pp. 91–102, 111–167.\n\n[67]Einstein to Max Born, 26 October 1920, GyB, Nachlass Born, no. 188. p. 18.\n\n[68]Max Born to Felix Klein, 21 November 1920, GyGöU, Nachlass Klein, quoted in Beyerchen\n\n1977, pp. 109–110.\n\n[69]„Eine deutsche Presse hätte . . . den für den Kundigen nur als verwunderlich zu bezeichnenden\n\nAnschein vermeiden müssen, als wäre man in der Wissenschaft bei uns auf das Urteil Englands ange-\n\nwiesen.
