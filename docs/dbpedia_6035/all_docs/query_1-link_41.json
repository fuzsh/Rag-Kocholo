        "text": "2. The route to the discovery- Research on cathode rays in the 19th century\n\nThe history and the claims about the discovery of X-rays are a history of research on gas discharges in the 19th century. Gas discharge tubes were a popular attraction in vaudeville shows and fairgrounds in the last decades of the 19th century because of their mysterious luminous phenomena. For the pleasure of viewing the luminous phenomena, special gas discharge tubes were built that contained various fluorescent crystals arranged in flower bouquets.\n\nIn the second half of the nineteenth century, gas discharge became increasingly a subject of science. A new field of research emerged, which was steadily expanded by numerous innovative technical developments and skills. These technical innovations included, from the 1850s onwards, powerful high-voltage supplies, such as spark inductors, and especially the further development of the art of glass blowing. Here, the glassmakers from Thuringia in particular led the way. The town of Gehlberg became a center for the production of thermometers and technical glass articles for measuring instruments as late as the 19th century. The Gundelach company was also the first to build special X-ray tubes after the discovery became known.\n\nThe development of modern mercury air-pumps made it possible to create the high gas dilution ratio in the tubes required for the experiments and the scientific analysis of the glow phenomena. However, low-pressure gas discharges are based on quite complex physical processes that cannot be easily explained. Therefore, gas discharges remained a rather exotic topic until the last decades of the 19th century. Nevertheless, before Röntgen started working on cathode rays, many scientists had already done research in that field. They all aimed to fathom the physical nature of the observable phenomena of luminosity. Until Röntgen's research in 1895 and two years later, however, the nature of cathode rays remained unclear. This motivated Röntgen to conduct his own research."
