Executive summary: Investigations of cathode rays

German physicist Philipp Lenard studied under Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Hermann von Helmholtz, and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1905 for his investigations of cathode rays (electron beams). His work showed that electrons could be induced to radiate beyond the evacuated tube where they were produced, and that this radiation could travel short distances and penetrate sheets of metallic foil. From this he extrapolated a new but incorrect model of the atom, which was debated briefly until the acceptance of Ernest Rutherford's view of atomic design.

He is almost as well-known for his study of the photoelectric effect, a phenomenon which occurs when light strikes metallic surfaces. He also studied the size and shape of raindrops, describing what is sometimes called the Lenard effect, the separation of electric charges as water drops break up. His other work concerned phosphorescence, luminescence, and electrical conductivity of flames.

Lenard broke with the mainstream of science in the 1920s, disputing Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, and wrote the four-volume physics text Deutsche Physik (German Physics), which almost completely ignored "Jewish science" (i.e., Einstein). He was a strong believer in eugenics and an enthusiastic supporter of the Nazi Party as it took power in Germany, and in return the Third Reich honored him by expanding his University of Heidelberg laboratory into the Philipp Lenard Institute. He complained that he had been denied his proper credit for Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen's discovery of x-rays, and accused Einstein of misleading people with "pseudoscience" that had little experimental support.
