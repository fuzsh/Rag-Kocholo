        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nAhmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the British and Russian Empires until it won independence from notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in increased democracy ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 communist countercoup. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan communist regime, touching off a long and destructive war. Internationally supported anti-communist mujahidin rebels forced the USSR to withdraw in 1989. A series of subsequent civil wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, a US and Allied military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Usama BIN LADIN.\n\nA UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new constitution, a presidential election in 2004, and National Assembly elections in 2005. In 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan, and he was reelected in 2009. Ashraf Ghani AHMADZAI succeeded him as president in 2014 following a disputed election. The Taliban conducted an insurgency for two decades against the Afghan Government and forces from the United States and other countries. In February 2020, the US and the Taliban signed an agreement that led to the withdrawal of international forces in exchange for commitments on counterterrorism and other assurances. The Taliban took over Afghanistan on 15 August 2021.\n\nThe Taliban established an all-male interim leadership structure dominated by Pashtun clerics under the leadership of Haivatrullah AKHUNDZADA. The Taliban issued numerous edicts that constrained women's mobility, ability to study and work, and access to education beyond primary school. To date, no country has recognized the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSouthern Asia, north and west of Pakistan, east of Iran\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n33 00 N, 65 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAsia\n\nArea\n\ntotal : 652,230 sq km\n\nland: 652,230 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncomparison ranking : total 43\n\nArea - comparative\n\nalmost six times the size of Virginia; slightly smaller than Texas\n\nArea comparison map :\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 5,987 km\n\nborder countries (6): China 91 km; Iran 921 km; Pakistan 2,670 km; Tajikistan 1,357 km; Turkmenistan 804 km; Uzbekistan 144 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km (landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\narid to semiarid; cold winters and hot summers\n\nTerrain\n\nmostly rugged mountains; plains in north and southwest\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Noshak 7,492 m\n\nlowest point: Amu Darya 258 m\n\nmean elevation: 1,884 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nnatural gas, petroleum, coal, copper, chromite, talc, barites, sulfur, lead, zinc, iron ore, salt, precious and semiprecious stones, arable land\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 58.1% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 11.8% (2018)\n\npermanent crops: 0.3% (2018)\n\npermanent pasture: 46% (2018)\n\nforest: 1.8% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 40.1% (2018)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n24,930 sq km (2020)\n\nMajor lakes (area sq km)\n\nsalt water lake(s): Ab-e Istadah-ye Muqur (endorheic basin) - 520 sq km\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\nAmu Darya (shared with Tajikistan [s], Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan [m]) - 2,620 km; Helmand river source (shared with Iran) - 1,130 km\n\nnote â [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nIndian Ocean drainage: Indus (1,081,718 sq km)\n\nInternal (endorheic basin) drainage: Amu Darya (534,739 sq km); Tarim Basin (1,152,448 sq km)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulations tend to cluster in the foothills and periphery of the rugged Hindu Kush range; smaller groups are found in many of the country's interior valleys; in general, the east is more densely settled, while the south is sparsely populated\n\nNatural hazards\n\ndamaging earthquakes occur in Hindu Kush mountains; flooding; droughts\n\nGeography - note\n\nlandlocked; the Hindu Kush mountains that run northeast to southwest divide the northern provinces from the rest of the country; the highest peaks are in the northern Vakhan (Wakhan Corridor)\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\ntotal: 40,121,552\n\nmale: 20,301,066\n\nfemale: 19,820,486 (2024 est.)\n\ncomparison rankings : female 37; male 37; total 36\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Afghan(s)\n\nadjective: Afghan\n\nEthnic groups\n\ncurrent, reliable statistical data on ethnicity in Afghanistan are not available; Afghanistan's 2004 Constitution cited Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek, Turkman, Baluch, Pashaie, Nuristani, Aymaq, Arab, Qirghiz, Qizilbash, Gujur, and Brahwui ethnicities; Afghanistan has dozens of other small ethnic groups\n\nLanguages\n\nAfghan Persian or Dari (official, lingua franca) 77%, Pashto (official) 48%, Uzbeki 11%, English 6%, Turkmani 3%, Urdu 3%, Pashaie 1%, Nuristani 1%, Arabic 1%, Balochi 1%, other <1% (2020 est.)\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nÚ©ØªØ§Ø¨ Ø­ÙØ§ÛÙ Ø¬ÙØ§ÙØ Ù Ø±Ø¬Ø¹Û Ø¶Ø±ÙØ±Û Ø¨Ø±Ø§Û Ø§Ø·ÙØ§Ø¹Ø§Øª Ø§ÙÙÛÛÂ (Dari)\n\nØ¯ Ø¯ÙÛØ§ Ø¯ Ø­ÙØ§Ø¦ÛÙÙ Ú©ØªØ§Ø¨Ø Ø¨ÙÛØ§Ø¯Û Ù Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ø§ØªÙ ÙÙ¾Ø§Ø±Ù Ø¶Ø±ÙØ±Û Ø³Ø±ÚÛÙÙ- (Pashto)\n\nThe World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.\n\nnote 1: percentages sum to more than 100% because many people are multilingual\n\nnote 2: Uzbeki, Turkmani, Pashaie, Nuristani, Balochi, and Pamiri are the third official languages in areas where the majority speaks them\n\nDari audio sample :\n\nPashto audio sample :\n\nReligions\n\nMuslim 99.7% (Sunni 84.7 - 89.7%, Shia 10 - 15%), other <0.3% (2009 est.)\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 39.6% (male 8,062,407/female 7,818,897)\n\n15-64 years: 57.5% (male 11,702,734/female 11,372,249)\n\n65 years and over: 2.9% (2024 est.)
