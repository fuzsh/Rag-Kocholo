        "text": "I sat down for coffee last week with Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan’s finance minister from 2002 to 2004. He’s about to throw his hat into the ring of Afghan politics and challenge his former boss, Hamid Karzai, in the presidential election scheduled for August 18th. Ghani is a slight, balding man with a gentle voice and a keen mind; his background is in social sciences (he has a PhD in anthropology from Columbia) and the World Bank. He’s the technocratic alternative to the politics of warlordism and corruption, and he’s deeply fluent in the language of international development: words like “stakeholder” and “governance sector” come easily to his tongue. Ghani’s account of what’s gone wrong in Afghanistan is relatively simple, and it overlaps on several counts with the views of the Obama Administration: the Taliban was in retreat until the Bush Administration took its eye off of Afghanistan and invaded Iraq. Since then, Karzai has been held to Iraq’s low standard of security and competence, by which he’s been wrongly judged to have done relatively well. Ghani resigned as finance minister at the end of 2004 because he saw that Karzai was unwilling to take on power brokers that were the sources of corruption and government failure. Since then, the Taliban has made a spectacular comeback, largely due to these failures, and only a change of government will reverse the deterioration.\n\n“When people suddenly come to office from exile, without any previous history, sycophancy becomes a very high component, because they’re dependent on relationships,” Ghani said when I asked what had gone wrong with Karzai. “No one has a constituency, and the person at the top is bombarded with praise—‘You’re the greatest thing since sliced cheese’—and human beings being human beings, if they hear they’re great, and only a few people are saying no, who are they going to believe? Shakespeare is the best guide to Afghanistan.”\n\nIt’s hard to know how much of a constituency Ghani himself would have, outside the ranks of the educated civil service and business circles. And it’s hard to picture him campaigning in villages around Kandahar or Mazar-i-Sharif—the image of Dukakis riding in a tank comes to mind. But Ghani has a claim on rural Afghanistan: His proudest achievement as finance minister was the National Solidarity Program, which has channeled over half a billion dollars in World Bank money to 23,000 Afghan villages in block grants of $20,000 to $60,000 for agricultural aid. He’s a withering critic of American aid and the bloated contracting policies of the Agency for International Development. He also thinks the American military should move away from what he calls the “Special Forces doctrine” of offensive operations against the enemy, and instead concentrate on counterinsurgency, which puts the civilian population at the center of strategy (since counterinsurgency also includes combat operations, Ghani might be more averse to the use of force than Obama or General David Petraeus). He believes that most of the Taliban could be won back with a job and a responsive government. “I will approach them with compassion and try to bring them back home. Someone who has a problem with the government—do you counsel them, or try to shoot them?” As for the hard-core Taliban who will go on fighting, “We have to negotiate from a position of strength, not weakness, so they see the direction of governance going against them.”\n\nCan good government, an improved economy, and more effective aid policies do what eight years of fighting and half-hearted nation-building have not? Ghani’s views are a repudiation not just of the Karzai presidency but of the whole course of modern Afghanistan, in the decades since he was a professor at Kabul University in the mid-nineteen-seventies. International experts who write books with titles like “Fixing Failed States” seldom rise to the top of the world’s most brutal countries; they usually lack the ruthlessness to win and rule. But there’s a precedent that should give Ghani some hope: Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a former finance minister and international civil servant, is the elected President of Liberia, which just a few years ago was one of the most violent and desperate places on earth.\n\n(Photograph: AP PHOTO/KEYSTONE, Martial Trezzini)"
