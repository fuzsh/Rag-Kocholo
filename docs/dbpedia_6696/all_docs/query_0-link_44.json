        "text": "Afghanistan's new president has used his first day in office to call on the Taliban to rejoin peace talks, as the militant insurgency gains strength.\n\nDuring the ceremony to swear in Ashraf Ghani, a bomb exploded in the capital Kabul, killing seven people.\n\nThe bomber targeted a security checkpoint near Kabul's airport, minutes before Dr Ghani was sworn in.\n\nThe bloodshed is a sign of the country's growing Taliban insurgency.\n\nIn recent weeks, militants have killed 100 people in Ghazni province, including an Australian Afghan dual citizen.\n\nIn his inauguration speech, Dr Ghani called on the Taliban to join peace talks, saying the country was tired of war.\n\nDr Ghani is expected to sign a deal today to allow a small number of foreign troops to remain in the country beyond the end of this year to help train local forces battling Taliban insurgents.\n\nLoading...\n\nDr Ghani succeeded Hamid Karzai, who had led Afghanistan from 2002.\n\nMr Karzai's relationship with the West had soured in recent years, particularly as the number of civilian casualties by US airstrikes grew.\n\nHe refused to sign an agreement to allow foreign troops to stay in the country beyond the end of this year, despite the deal having widespread support among the population.\n\nThe Afghan National Army has grown from zero to more than a quarter of a million troops over the past decade and many observers say it still requires training and support from foreign forces.\n\nThe transition of power was the first in more than a decade and followed months of uncertainty over allegations of vote-rigging during the presidential elections.\n\nDr Ghani will head a government of national unity with Abdullah Abdullah, the runner-up in the disputed election.\n\nDr Abdullah will serve as chief executive officer of the government - a role similar to that of prime minister.\n\nThe United States has welcomed the agreement to share power, calling it a positive step.\n\nThe power-sharing deal was cobbled together only months after the election deadlock, which saw both candidates claim victory.\n\n\"We expect both to fulfil the promises they made to the people,\" Kabul man Mohammad Sharif said.\n\n\"We, the people of Afghanistan, are monitoring their performance to see whether they can serve the people or not.\"\n\nHow the new government works\n\nThe president will have clear seniority in the \"national unity government\" according to the deal signed by Dr Ghani and Dr Abdullah one week ago.\n\nThe document said that the government would be \"a genuine political partnership between the president and the CEO under the authority of the president\".\n\nBut the deal also said that Dr Abdullah, as CEO, would fulfil \"the functions of an executive prime minister\", including chairing weekly meetings of the council of ministers.\n\nThe CEO role may evolve into the formal title of prime minister in two years' time when a loya jirga (grand assembly) discusses constitutional change.\n\nA major cause of contention between the two camps was over the power to appoint officials.\n\nThe agreement said that the president and CEO would have \"parity\" in awarding key senior security and economic jobs, with other officials nominated through a new \"merit-based mechanism\".\n\n\"Creation of the CEO post involves a substantial delegation of presidential authority,\" concluded the independent Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit (AREU).\n\nChallenges for the new government\n\nThe new government inherits massive problems, including fighting an emboldened Taliban which in recent months has launched aggressive attacks as foreign troops withdraw.\n\nDr Ghani must also reset relations with the US, which have soured in recent years under Mr Karzai.\n\nOne of Dr Ghani's first acts as president is expected to be signing a bilateral security agreement to allow a small contingent of US forces to remain in Afghanistan after this year to train and assist the new Afghan army and police.\n\nThe new government will also immediately face a fiscal crisis.\n\nAlready heavily dependent on foreign aid, Kabul has asked the US and other donors for more than $600 million to pay its bills until the end of the year.\n\nA finance ministry official acknowledged that the government was so broke that it has been forced to delay paying civil servants' salaries for October because the treasury did not have the money.\n\nThere are also hopes that Dr Ghani, a longtime World Bank official and former finance minister, will put his knowledge of international institutions and development to work in combating Afghanistan's tradition of corrupt and inefficient government."
