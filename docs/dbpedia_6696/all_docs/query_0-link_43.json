        "text": "Explosions have broken out across Kabul after the Afghan president left the country and the Taliban demanded an unconditional surrender.\n\nAshraf Ghani confirmed he left Afghanistan for Tajikistan in a Facebook post on Sunday night.\n\nHe said he was faced with a \"hard choice\" between the \"armed Taliban\" or \"leaving the dear country that I dedicated my life to protecting the past 20 years\".\n\n\"The Taliban have made it to remove me, they are here to attack all Kabul and the people of Kabul. In order to prevent a flood of bloodshed, I thought it was best to get out,\" he wrote.\n\nHis post confirmed Taliban officials' claims they have taken control of the presidential palace, alongside 11 districts of the capital.\n\nLive updates on Afghanistan as Taliban enters Kabul\n\nReuters also reported late on Sunday that several explosions were heard across Kabul, despite the Taliban claiming they want a \"peaceful\" transition of power.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson chaired a COBRA meeting on the Afghan crisis this evening after requesting to recall parliament from its summer break on Wednesday.\n\nHe said the UK and its international partners should work to ensure \"Afghanistan does not become a breeding ground for terror\" once again.\n\nMr Johnson said that the \"situation remains difficult\" and the world is facing a \"change of regime in Kabul\", but UK officials are working to get as many British nationals out of the country as it can \"in the next few days\".\n\nOfficials in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have said they will help shelter British diplomats at their airports as they leave Afghanistan after all commercial flights were suspended from Kabul over security concerns.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said he has spoken with his Afghan counterpart and \"shared my deep concerns\" about the future of the country.\n\nThe Foreign Office confirmed that Mr Raab is flying back to the UK from his holiday \"given the situation\".\n\nBritish troops from the 16 Air Assault Brigade landed in Kabul on Sunday, while British Airways ordered its pilots to stay away from Afghan airspace over security concerns.\n\nOther airlines are likely to follow suit, as flight paths over Afghanistan connect countries to India and the Far East.\n\nMeanwhile, according to a Taliban spokesman, the militant group is in talks with the Afghan government for a \"peaceful surrender\" of Kabul, with the country's interior minister being quoted as saying the government will hand over control of the city without a fight.\n\nAn Afghan delegation is reported to be travelling to Qatar today to meet Taliban representatives.\n\nTaliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the Al-Jazeera English news channel that the group wanted an unconditional surrender.\n\nThe government is believed to be seeking an interim administration, but two Taliban officials have told Reuters there will be \"no transitional government\".\n\nA Taliban leader based in Doha has reportedly told fighters to refrain from violence in the capital, but sporadic gunfire has been heard and Sky News correspondent Stuart Ramsay, who is on the ground, has heard of \"skirmishes\" across the city.\n\n\"No one's life, property and dignity will be harmed and the lives of the citizens of Kabul will not be at risk,\" the Taliban said.\n\nAnother official insisted: \"We don't want a single, innocent Afghan civilian to be injured or killed as we take charge. But we have not declared a ceasefire.\"\n\nThe Taliban leader in Doha said fighters should allow safe passage to anyone who wants to leave the city and is requesting women head to protected areas.\n\nTraffic jams were pictured on Sunday as people rushed to flee Kabul, while at the airport, the US embassy issued a security alert after gunfire was heard there.\n\nDiplomats and other US officials are currently sheltering there as they wait to be airlifted to safety.\n\nSunday's developments come after the Islamist group seized the city of Jalalabad, a capture that means it has now secured the roads that connect the country to Pakistan.\n\nThe Taliban has made rapid gains over the past week, with Western countries urgently deploying troops to assist with the evacuation of diplomatic staff.\n\nUS President Joe Biden announced he was sending 5,000 more troops to Kabul to help remove personnel - and the evacuation of the American embassy has now begun.\n\nUS diplomats have been urgently destroying sensitive documents and helicopters have been seen landing on the US embassy.\n\nThe Biden administration has warned Taliban officials any actions that put American personnel at risk \"will be met with a swift and strong US military response\".\n\nA US official told Reuters on Sunday that the US military was unlikely to change its strategy in Kabul unless the Taliban impact the evacuation of its embassy there.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN it is \"simply not in our interest\" to remain in Afghanistan and the situation in Kabul is \"manifestly not Saigon\", a reference to US evacuation of the South Vietnamese city at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.\n\nMr Biden has defended his decision to withdraw US troops from the country in the coming weeks, and said the task of fighting back against Taliban insurgents must fall to Afghan forces.\n\nHe warned that an indefinite American military presence in Afghanistan is not an option, and has vowed not to pass on the war to a fifth US president.\n\n\"One more year, or five more years, of US military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country. And an endless American presence in the middle of another country's civil conflict was not acceptable to me,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nThe president's handling of the crisis has attracted criticism from some American politicians, with his predecessor Donald Trump claiming that Mr Biden \"gets it wrong every time on foreign policy\".\n\nIn a strongly worded statement, Mr Trump said: \"After I took out ISIS, I established a credible deterrent. That deterrent is now gone. The Taliban no longer has fear or respect for America, or America's power.\n\n\"What a disgrace it will be when the Taliban raises their flag over America's embassy in Kabul. This is complete failure through weakness, incompetence, and total strategic incoherence.\"\n\nThe UK is also currently evacuating British nationals and local translators - and this weekend, 600 troops are being sent to assist with this effort.\n\nThe Home Office said it is working to \"protect British nationals and help former UK staff and other eligible people travel to the UK\".\n\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said the UK had \"reduced\" its diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, \"but our ambassador remains in Kabul and UK government staff continue to work to provide assistance to British nationals and to our Afghan staff\".\n\nThey added: \"We are doing all we can to enable remaining British nationals, who want to leave Afghanistan, to do so.\"\n\nAccording to The Sunday Telegraph, Britain's ambassador to Afghanistan Sir Laurie Bristow is going to be flown out of the country by tonight."
