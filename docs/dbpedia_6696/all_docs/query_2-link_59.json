        "text": "What Went Wrong: The 2021 collapse of Afghan National Security Forces\n\nTimor Sharan •\n\nOn 15 August 2021, the Afghan government and large parts of the state, primarily the army and police, came tumbling down like a house of cards, leaving serious questions about the sudden melting away of Afghanistan’s security forces. Many factors contributed to the collapse of the security forces, including widespread corruption, lack of a combat […]\n\n15 Dec 2022\n\nWar and Peace Read more\n\nConditions-based Interim Government: President Ghani presents a preview of his peace plan\n\nThomas Ruttig •\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani has raised the curtain on his peace plan and agreed to the formation of an interim government in Afghanistan. Ghani summarised his plan in a speech at the 9th Ministerial Conference of the Heart of Asia/Istanbul Process – a gathering of regional and other states on security and cooperation in Central Asia […]\n\n1 Apr 2021\n\nWar and Peace Read more\n\n“Another Bonn-style conference”: A new plan to ‘fix’ the war and enable US troops to leave\n\nThomas Ruttig •\n\nThe United States envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad has floated the possibility of a ‘new Bonn’ conference that could cancel or sideline the intra-Afghan peace talks in Doha. ‘Bonn 2’ appears to have been discussed in some allied capitals and various Afghan leaders, although it is unclear how much buy-in the proposal has from them. […]\n\n7 Mar 2021\n\nWar and Peace Read more\n\nAfghanistan’s New ­– But Still Incomplete Cabinet: No end yet to acting ministers\n\nAli Yawar Adili • Rohullah Sorush •\n\nThe Lower House of Afghanistan’s parliament, the Wolesi Jirga, has confirmed 20 out of 25 cabinet nominees proposed by the government and rejected the remaining five. The confirmation of the cabinet nominees comes more than a year after the presidential election, almost nine months after President Ashraf Ghani’s inauguration and almost seven months since the […]\n\n6 Dec 2020\n\nPolitical Landscape Read more\n\nThe Intra-Afghan Peace Talks: Warring parties negotiate, victims of war are excluded\n\nEhsan Qaane •\n\nA clear divide has emerged in the Afghan government on the role of war victims in the peace process. In a surprising move, President Ashraf Ghani recently suggested that Afghanistan should follow the Spanish model – better known as the ‘pact of forgetting’. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Peace and members of the Afghan negotiating team […]\n\n16 Oct 2020\n\nRights and Freedoms Read more\n\nAfghanistan’s 2019 Elections (31): A review of the disputed presidential election and its aftermath\n\nAli Yawar Adili •\n\nOn the first anniversary of Afghanistan’s fourth – and much disputed – presidential election of the post-Taleban order, we look back at the events surrounding the election and its aftermath to provide a concluding overview. AAN’s Ali Yawar Adili reviews what happened before, during and after the election, looks at the votes that swung the […]\n\n28 Sep 2020\n\nPolitical Landscape Read more\n\nDoors Opened for Direct Talks with the Taleban: The results of the Loya Jirga on prisoners and peace\n\nThomas Ruttig • Ali Yawar Adili • Obaid Ali •\n\nThe three-day Consultative Peace Loya Jirga held in Kabul from 17-19 Asad 1399 (7-9 August 2020) has opened the way for the Afghan government to release a final 400 Taleban prisoners from government jails, thereby removing the last obstacle blocking direct peace talks with the Taleban. The jirga delegates did not question the stark choice the government […]\n\n12 Aug 2020\n\nWar and Peace Read more\n\nTo Release, Or Not To Release? Legal questions around Ghani’s consultative loya jirga on Taleban prisoners\n\nEhsan Qaane •\n\nThe Consultative Loya Jirga, called by President Ashraf Ghani to decide the fate of 400 Taleban prisoners, and whether they should be released to enable intra-Afghan peace talks, has begun. Ghani has argued that, according to the constitution and the penal code, it was not in his power to release these prisoners and therefore he […]\n\n7 Aug 2020\n\nWar and Peace Read more\n\nStill Preoccupied by ‘Who Gets What’: 100 days of the new government, but no full cabinet\n\nAli Yawar Adili •\n\nMore than two and half months since Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah signed their political agreement, and almost five months since the inauguration of Ashraf Ghani as president, Afghanistan still has no new cabinet. The list of cabinet nominees remains incomplete and parliament, which has to vote to confirm or reject nominees, has given up […]\n\n5 Aug 2020\n\nPolitical Landscape Read more\n\nBetween Professionalism and Accommodation: The slow progress on the new cabinet\n\nAli Yawar Adili • Thomas Ruttig •\n\nMore than three months after the inauguration of President Ashraf Ghani, a cabinet has not yet been formed. The appointments were delayed and disrupted by the dispute about the election outcome and the ensuing standoff, which had beset the country for more than two months. However, almost a month after the impasse was resolved, Ghani […]\n\n13 Jun 2020\n\nPolitical Landscape Read more\n\nEnd of the Post-Election Impasse? Ghani and Abdullah’s new power-sharing formula\n\nAli Yawar Adili •\n\nThe electoral and political standoff which had beset the country for months has been ended by a new power-sharing agreement signed on 17 May 2020 by President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Dr Abdullah Abdullah. Both had claimed the presidency and held rival inaugurations in March. AAN’s researcher Ali Yawar Adili (with input from Thomas […]\n\n20 May 2020\n\nPolitical Landscape Read more\n\nFrom Parallel Governments to a New Form of Power-Sharing? Afghanistan’s ongoing post-election crisis\n\nAli Yawar Adili •\n\nBoth parties claiming to be Afghanistan’s president are sending out signals that they are moving toward a new power-sharing formula. It is not clear, however, whether these signals indicate that the post-election political standoff is nearing its end. Possibly, they are just designed to reassure Afghans and the country’s international backers, the most important of […]\n\n7 May 2020\n\nPolitical Landscape Read more"
