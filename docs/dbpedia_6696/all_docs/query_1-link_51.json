        "text": "The President today participated in a video conference with President Ashraf Ghani of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The President congratulated President Ghani, who was joined by Chief Executive Officer Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, on the National Unity Government’s recent progress in naming candidates for Attorney General, Minister of Interior, and new leadership of the High Peace Council. The President praised President Ghani’s ongoing commitment to reform, noting several recent achievements including record government revenues and efforts to combat institutional corruption. He commended Afghan security forces for their bravery and sacrifices, and the leaders discussed ways to bolster security cooperation and strengthen the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.\n\nThe President noted President Ghani’s leadership in working with Afghanistan’s neighbors to deepen regional cooperation and advance the reconciliation process with the Taliban, and he underscored U.S. support for a peace process that reduces violence and ensures lasting stability in Afghanistan and the region. Both leaders expressed their intentions to use the upcoming NATO Summit in Warsaw and EU-hosted Ministerial in Brussels as forums to reaffirm international support for Afghanistan’s peace and stability. Finally, they recommitted to regular consultations this year as the United States continues to support the Afghan government’s efforts to strengthen governance and provide security for its people."
