        "text": "Ghani described how Taliban fighters surrounded the city on August 15. He said they agreed not to enter the city but went back on that within two hours.\n\nGhani said his security chief warned him that if he stood to fight, then his troops could not resist, and they would all be killed.\n\nThe Washington Post reported in August that Ghani fled the country quickly, without notifying his aides and allies, as he feared Taliban militants had gained entry to the presidential palace and planned to execute him.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"He did not give me more than two minutes,\" the former president told the BBC. \"My instructions had been to prepare for departure for [the city of] Khost. He told me that Khost had fallen and so had Jalalabad.\"\n\nGhani said that he was not aware he was flying into exile until his plane took off. \"I did not know where we will go,\" he told the BBC. \"Only when we took off, it became clear that we were leaving [Afghanistan]. So this really was sudden.\"\n\nThe former president is now living in exile in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nGhani was criticized for his decision to flee Afghanistan. His former vice president, Amrullah Saleh, told BBC News in late August that the decision was \"disgraceful.\"\n\nIt was alleged that Ghani abandoned the country with a suitcase filled with cash, Insider's Tom Porter reported. He denied this claim. \"I want to categorically state, I did not take any money out of the country,\" Ghani told the BBC. \"My style of life is known to everyone. What would I do with the money?\"\n\nGhani also said he was willing to take partial blame for the events that led to the fall of Kabul. He said one mistake was trusting in \"our international partnership,\" an apparent reference to the US and its allies, who withdrew their troops before the Taliban takeover.\n\nBut he added that he'd been made a \"scapegoat,\" and that his \"life work has been destroyed.\""
