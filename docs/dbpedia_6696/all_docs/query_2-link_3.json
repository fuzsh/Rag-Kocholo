        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nWell, last August, the Taliban swept into Kabul, Afghan national security forces fell apart, and the Afghan government dissolved.\n\nThe man who sat atop that government was President Ashraf Ghani, who fled Kabul in a helicopter. The former president is now in the United Arab Emirates. And he spoke with Nick Schifrin yesterday.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nIt has been one year since the Taliban took over Afghanistan amid the Afghan government collapse and the chaotic U.S. withdrawal.\n\nTo get some perspective on what happened and why, we turn to Ashraf Ghani, the former president of Afghanistan.\n\nMr. President, thank you very much. Welcome back to the \"NewsHour.\"\n\nLet's start with your departure from Kabul.\n\nLast May, on this program, you said: \"I will not abandon my people. I will not abandon my forces. I'm willing to die for my country.\"\n\nBut, three months later, on August 15, you left Kabul. And you recently said you left because you didn't want to give the Taliban — quote — \"the pleasure of humiliating an Afghan president.\"\n\nWas avoiding humiliation worth abandoning the country?\n\nAshraf Ghani, Former President of Afghanistan: I firmly committed to defending my people, our own forces in the public to the last minute I could.\n\nI left as the last person in the chain of command because our forces could no longer sustain. I had no one to fight with me. It was not a situation where sacrificing myself would have saved the republic.\n\nOn the contrary, it would have created another trauma. And we have had enough of trauma in our history.\n\nAshraf Ghani:\n\nI'm not the one who you uses adjectives.\n\nWhat I want to point out, one, the assumptions regarding Taliban were highly flawed. They were based on wishful thinking. Two, its preparation and its implementation will go down in the history as one of the worst agreements ever concluded, because it violated all.\n\nAnd then they were false assurance systems. We were assured that a cease-fire would take place and political negotiations regarding the future government will be an indispensable part of the agreement, which they were not.\n\nAshraf Ghani:\n\nAbsolutely. Absolutely.\n\nWhere did corruption start from? It started with a — with buying of the warlords by the Bush administration. The scale of corruption in Afghanistan is a confluence between your new barons, which represent Beltway contractors, and military industrial contractors, and Afghan new and old warlords.\n\nMy agenda was to deal with this corruption and to contain it. This corruption was a cancer. But, simultaneously, you need to see our sacrifices. We were losing between 200 and 400 soldiers and officers a day.\n\nA time comes when even steel has a snapping point. And that's the point it came, because the cities and the provinces where a lot of fighting took place could not receive sustained support.\n\nAshraf Ghani:\n\nThe U.S. propped up the Taliban. The Trump administration — without the Trump administration's role, the Taliban would not be here today.\n\nSo there is moral responsibility. I would propose a conditionality-based approach, where it goes to the people. The Taliban are not in need. Trafficking and other things, and now the very large arsenal that is becoming part of the international arms trafficking is available to them.\n\nThe suffering of the people has to take priority. And that has to be the goal."
