        "text": "GWEN IFILL:\n\nPresident Obama announced today the U.S. would scale back the pace of its promised troop pullout from Afghanistan, allowing forces to stay in place this year, and revisiting those numbers again next year.\n\nThat was at the top of the wish list Afghanistan's new leadership brought to town this week.\n\nGWEN IFILL:\n\nThe U.S. and international combat mission in Afghanistan formally ended late last year, and the U.S. military has been steadily reducing its footprint, aiming to have only a skeleton force in place by the end of next year.\n\nThe Taliban responded by stepping up attacks and seizing territory from often-ineffective Afghan forces. And the downsized U.S. presence led to a sharp reduction in air support for the Afghans. Another key mission, training Afghan forces — they now number 330,000, but the size of the force has fallen as casualties have risen. Desertions are also on the rise.\n\nYesterday, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced the U.S. would help out here as well, committing billions of dollars in additional support.\n\nGWEN IFILL:\n\nThe announcements and warm words highlight a distinct thaw in U.S.-Afghan relations since the days of Ghani's predecessor, Hamid Karzai.\n\nU.S. dealings with him had become poisonous, and he ultimately refused to sign a security agreement to formalize the American presence in Afghanistan. But once Ghani took office, the deal was signed immediately. In another sign of renewed goodwill, Ghani took pains during this visit to honor the sacrifice of more than 2,200 Americans killed fighting in Afghanistan since 2001, joining Vice President Biden today to lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe new leader is being accompanied by former rival Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan's new CEO. That post was created after last year's presidential election was marred by allegations of fraud.\n\nGWEN IFILL:\n\nThe two men created a so-called national unity government, although key positions remain unfilled. Ghani faces many other challenges, a recent, disturbing example, the stoning and burning death of a young woman in Central Kabul by a mob of men. She'd been falsely accused of desecrating the Koran.\n\nGhani's U.S. visit continues tomorrow, when he speaks to a joint meeting of Congress, before heading to New York and the United Nations Thursday.\n\nShortly after the White House news conference ended today, I spoke with President Ghani.\n\nMr. President, thank you for joining us.\n\nYou have just come from a pretty successful meeting at the White House — you're at Blair House right across the street right now — in which you asked the president the freeze troop withdrawals, at least for this year — he agreed to do that — and to rethink it for 2016.\n\nWhat about that open-ended part about next year? Did you hope that perhaps they would give you a more definitive idea of how many troops would be on the ground this time next year?\n\nPRESIDENT ASHRAF GHANI:\n\nThe military operations by Pakistan have brought about a displacement effect, where a significant number of foreign terror groups that are a threat to practically every one of our neighbors near and far have been pushed towards our territory, while their leadership and their networks remain in Pakistan or elsewhere.\n\nA new ecology of terror is forming because the weakening or collapse of the states in the Middle East is bringing new opportunities to strengthen these networks. We have to deal with this threat, not just by our Afghan action, but through coordinated regional action.\n\nAnd the beginning of awareness is taking place, but it's important to understand that violence is changing its forms. It's rapidly acquiring a new set of capabilities. And unless we grasp them, we understand them and then preempt them from forming and acting, we will be in a defensive position.\n\nPRESIDENT ASHRAF GHANI:\n\nDa'esh has four phases, organize, orient, decide, and act.\n\nBut because its recruitment is media-based, and not just through old personal networks, one has to be both vigilant and cautious in terms of the extent of their presence. We have made sure that it doesn't go beyond the stage of deciding to acting. So we have seen some evidence, but it could also be copycatting or in relation.\n\nAnd we need to share information and analysis in a coherent way, so that then one is not surprised the way their emergence in Iraq and Syria surprised both governments and analysts alike.\n\nGWEN IFILL:\n\nOf course, when you say Da'esh, you're referring to what we call ISIS or ISIL.\n\nI'm also curious about the Taliban negotiations, however. How do you get them back to the table, when they won't agree to the basics that you have asked, that they renounce al-Qaida, that they accept the Afghan constitution, that they renounce violence? How — is it Pakistan? Is that the key to getting them back to the table?\n\nPRESIDENT ASHRAF GHANI:\n\nIt's two things.\n\nOne is, of course, Pakistan, because Pakistan is facing an internal threat. It is going — it's gone through heavy fighting last year. It's going to have a fighting season of its own, unfortunately, this year. So, in light of that and in light of the decision of the Pakistani army, in the Pakistani government and parliament, to confront the phenomena of terror through direct use of force in response to the heinous crime that took place against the children in Peshawar, we're going to see new forms of activity that now will hopefully bring about a policy that will not differentiate between good terrorists and bad terrorists.\n\nThis could be a significant driver for separating the Taliban from these other groups. The second is that Da'esh, or what you call ISIL, is also a threat to the Taliban and to the related groups, because a characteristic of Da'esh is to swallow its competition, the way it did with the Syrian Free Army.\n\nSo, the room for maneuver within these two factors limits their options. The other is that, now that the combat role of the international forces has ended, Afghans are clearly coming in support of our security institutions. For instance, 4,000 of our religious scholars, about six weeks ago, clearly endorsed the Afghan security forces.\n\nThe other significant event is that of Muslim response. The conference in Mecca has condemned terrorism and identified a common platform for action. These are pressures that should hopefully get the Taliban to the negotiating table.\n\nPRESIDENT ASHRAF GHANI:\n\nCorruption is clearly the cancer that eats through our societies.\n\nWe have taken decisive action from the second day, where we tackled the notorious case of Kabul Bank. We have focused on all key drivers of corruption, whether it's contracting, sale of office, smuggling, land grabbing, or the most difficult, which is narcotics.\n\nSo, we are systematically focusing on underlying causes, and not just symptoms. Our society, after 36 years of conflict, is deeply traumatized. We suffer from the post-conflict distress syndrome as a society. So, the tragic lynching, totally unacceptable, either according to Islamic law or our civil laws, that took place is a manifestation of this.\n\nAnd we need to very clearly come, not just to have the police fight terror, but do their fundamental duty, which is enforcement of rights and upholding of rule of law.\n\nPRESIDENT ASHRAF GHANI:\n\nIt has changed fundamentally because we believe in a revitalized partnership.\n\nWe're not engaging in a blame game. We are engaged in common understanding, in common action. And part of this, of course, is also that the combat role of the United States has ended, as was agreed between our two governments, and the train, advise, assist mission that U.S. forces are currently engaged in does not involve combat roles.\n\nWe have common interests, are facing common threats, and need to engage an enduring partnership. And that is our key goal. And I hope that this trip has consolidated this revitalized this vital relationship for us."
