        "text": "Ashraf Ghani is a former technocrat who spent much of his career outside Afghanistan, before returning to help the country rebuild after years of war.\n\nHe came into office in 2014 seen as incorruptible and hands-on - too much so, some would say - but is also noted for his short temper.\n\nHowever, five years later, with memories of the fraud allegations which mired the 2014 vote still fresh in Afghans' minds, his reputation stands a little more tarnished.\n\nMr Ghani's time in office has been marked by an uneasy alliance with his chief executive and main rival for the top job, Abdullah Abdullah.\n\nA member of the country's majority Pashtun community, Mr Ghani took office as most foreign troops were leaving in 2014.\n\nBut since then the Taliban have extended their presence, eroding Kabul's writ across the country - undermining Mr Ghani's authority.\n\nHe was shut out of peace talks between the US and the Taliban, before they were called off earlier this month. The militants regard his government as US puppets.\n\nMr Ghani has introduced some anti-corruption policies but little progress appears to have been made. Earlier in September, the US said it would withdraw about $100m (Â£80m) earmarked for an energy project, citing unacceptably high levels of corruption in the Afghan government.\n\nHe was also a vocal critic of the way international aid money was being wasted in Afghanistan, and, in particular, money from the US, which he saw as operating in a \"parallel state\" which hired the best Afghans to service foreign offices in the capital Kabul, rather than building effective Afghan institutions.\n\nIn a BBC interview in 2007, he said: \"When we build a school by Afghans, the maximum cost is about $50,000. But when it is built by our international partners the cost can be as high as $250,000.\"\n\nThe difference was caused by the fact that contractors, many of them foreign, took percentages. He said: \"It's totally legal, but is it not corrupt?\"\n\nHowever, he had little political support in Afghanistan at the time. In 2009, he ran an ineffective campaign to be president and came a poor fourth in a race that was again won by President Karzai.\n\nBut with Mr Karzai barred by the constitution from standing for a third time, Mr Ghani mounted a second, far better campaign in 2014. He built a solid base of support after raising his profile in province after province as the head of the team managing the transition of military control from the US-led coalition to Afghan forces."
