        "text": "Vice President Mike Pence spoke with President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan by phone today. The discussion was a continuation of the dialogue that the Vice President had with Ghani and Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah in Kabul last month. The Vice President highlighted Kabul's continued engagement and critical progress on necessary reforms, political inclusion, and preparations for forthcoming elections. Vice President Pence and President Ghani discussed the political leadership in the Balkh province. The Vice President emphasized his support for the Afghan government to engage with Balkh Governor Atta and conduct a peacefully negotiated transition of leadership. The Vice President also discussed the security situation in Afghanistan and the impact of President Trump's South Asia strategy. The Vice President and Ghani both commended the bravery and sacrifices that U.S., Coalition, and Afghan soldiers have made in fighting the insurgency and international terrorists, such as ISIS and al-Qaida. Vice President Pence and President Ghani reaffirmed the enduring bonds and close alliance between the United States and Afghanistan."
