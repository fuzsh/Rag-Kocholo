        "text": "After weeks of political paralysis, Afghanistan’s new president has fulfilled what many thought should have been his first duty: he has formed a government.\n\nA long dispute over last year’s election was only resolved after the winner, Ashraf Ghani, agreed to share power with his rival Abdullah Abdullah in a government of national unity.\n\nIt took Ghani and his chief executive more than three months to complete their first collaborative task. The announcement on Monday of 25 new ministers in a low-key ceremony in Kabul brought some relief to Afghans who worried that the government would not be able to function.\n\nAs the country’s economic crisis deepens and a rekindled insurgency gains ground, the need for political leadership grows by the day. That is a job that Ghani still has to prove he is up to. Known as a steamrolling reformer, he also has a reputation as a fastidious micro-manager.\n\nHaroon Mir, a Kabul-based political analyst, said that to avoid the gridlock that had so far hampered the government, Ghani now needed to let go of the reins. “There is still a long process ahead. We will see if [Ghani] will have confidence in his ministers or if he will intervene,” Mir said.\n\nPublic pressure had been mounting in recent weeks as the president missed one self-imposed deadline after another. With the spring approaching, insurgents are gearing up for their annual fighting season, and a recent surge in violence coupled with political uncertainty has stirred anxiety among many Afghans.\n\nGhani and Abdullah are said to have haggled in particular over appointments to the main security organisations – the defence and interior ministries and the National Directorate of Security, the intelligence agency.\n\nGhani took charge of the defence ministry, to which he appointed Sher Mohammad Karimi, current chief of staff to the Afghan army. Abdullah picked Nur ul-Haq Ulumi, a former governor of Kandahar, to run the interior ministry.\n\nAs a general under the Soviet-backed regime that fell in 1992, Ulumi represents a time few Afghans wish to go back to, but his appointment is also a sign of a diversified cabinet.\n\nThe government, which still has to be approved by parliament, is dominated by new faces, including a handful of inexperienced politicians in their 30s and representatives of different ethnic backgrounds and regions.\n\nThree cabinet posts went to women – the ministries of higher education, information and culture, and women’s affairs – fewer than the four previously promised by Ghani.\n\nNazifullah Salarzai, the president’s spokesperson, said finding the right cabinet balance had been the main cause of the delay. “It’s a national unity government so the cabinet should also be one that reflects national unity,” he said.\n\nSince the election, Afghanistan’s new leaders have worked hard to demonstrate good governance. As one of his first tasks, Ghani took a swipe at corruption by reopening a fraud inquiry involving the country’s largest bank.\n\nAbdullah was the first top Afghan official to chair a United Nations event to drum up humanitarian support. And the vice-president, Abdul Rashid Dostum, a notorious former warlord, posted photos on social media of more than 100 Taliban fighters he had allegedly convinced to lay down their arms.\n\nYet little work was done in unison. The bad atmosphere of the elections seems to have bled into the two leaders’ personal relationship, leaving them in a perpetual power struggle. Many Afghans who had hoped for change feel disregarded.\n\n“People in Afghanistan have very bitter memories of the previous government because it didn’t pay any attention to the grievances of the public,” said Najib Sharifi, a civil society activist who runs the youth empowerment programme Afghan Voices. “If people get the impression that this government is the same, the government will lose its legitimacy, which will be very costly and very, very difficult to restore.”"
