        "text": "Chak De India meets Rambo accompanied by five girl scouts. Carry Aspirin in case of a headache.\n\nPeraanmai (No MPAA Rating)\n\nDirector: S.P. Jhananathan\n\nCast: ‘Jayam’ Ravi, Roland Kickinger and five other girls.\n\nGenre: Drama in the first half, action in the second half.\n\nRating: *\n\nS.P. Jhananathan has a liking for Russian arts. His first film, Iyarkai was based on the Russian poem, White Nights while Peraanmai is based on the 1973 Russian film, The Dawns Here Are Quiet.\n\nWhen Roland Kickinger calls out ‘kukku kukku’, it becomes the most laughable scene in the film. But, the reason why he does it can be clearly defined as the art of deception. He is deceiving a NCC girl scout to buy his calls and meet her fate in his hands. Peraanmai has a lot of these scenes.\n\nSitting in the first row of a cinema hall is a unique experience. You get to hear almost all the cheers and catcalls. Probably the best cheer was when Roland Kickinger walked topless, exposing his monster abs and Schwarzenegger-like physique. Perhaps, this is the reason why he was chosen as Schwarzenegger’s body double in Terminator: Salvation. He surely is the key factor why I watched the film and yet became another victim.\n\nPeraanmai stars ‘Jayam Ravi’ in probably his first action role out of his brother’s directorial hat. This hat being donned by S.P. Jhananathan is certainly the best for Ravi. Being the current generation’s method actor, Ravi has done his best in learning the tribal slang. Well, he does appear in a ‘komanam’ for a comparably longer screen time. Several dialogues have been muted as they harshly criticize the tribally grown Dhuruvan who works as a Forest Ranger. Five NCC girl scouts are selected for intense training in the shallow forests. One of them stumbles upon a group of foreign mercenaries who are planning to stop an Indian satellite launch. Foiling the plans of the mercenaries is the group of five courageous girls led by an enthusiastic ‘aiming to be the next action hero’ Ravi.\n\nThese five girls ‘HATE’ the tribal Ravi and decide to bump him off the records. But, Ravi’s controlled behavior is certainly stunning. It gets irritating that the Censor Board have muted the dialogues which may explain half of their anger towards the tribal folks.\n\nWhen your expectations begin to dampen, director S.P. Jhananathan brings on the anticipated ‘Ravi vs. Kickinger’ fight. The most amazing thing is that people carry huge guns and keep firing in open air. In the end, they run out of bullets and hence, kill each other by means of hand combat. Peraanmai is the xerox of a perfect action thriller which could have made a significance but a badly written screenplay pulls down the speed.\n\nCinematography is certainly the eye of attraction while editing proves to be the biggest muck up of the day. Specifically, when the homing scout is caught in a mud lake which eventually swallows her, a man next to me shouted – Is the editor sleeping? Vidyasagar’s BGM is a well composed one. However, the songs could have been avoided in the film as it certainly brings the film to cruising speed. Once again, Vadivelu proves to be the only potential in the film.\n\nPeraanmai is a commercialized action flick. I suggest you to sleep during the first half and watch the second because all the action you wanted is in the second half. But, don’t call it original and path breaking.\n\nExperience Hell Before Death\n\nAADHAVAN\n\nDirector: K.S. Ravikumar\n\nCast: Suriya, Nayantara, Saroja Devi, Bharath Murali, Vadivelu, Sayaji Shinde, Anand Babu and Rahul Dev\n\nGenre: Jason Bourne turns into Mr. & Mrs. Smith and later as Varanam Aayiram and finally into Main Hoon Na. In short, it’s an action/romance/family/spoof drama.\n\nRating: Tough to rate even though the presence of stars in the film is abundant.\n\nAADHAVAN IS A LANDMARK FILM. It is the 100th film I’ve seen in Inox. Also, it is the eighth film where I’ve sat patiently till the end when I wished to have walked out halfway through. I exited the cinema hall when Ayan was halfway through as it had too much of fantasy because I couldn’t think of an Indian Suriya kicking the butts of several African gangsters. K.S. Ravikumar returns to what he does the best after changing tracks in his last film, Dasavatharam. Harris Jayaraj finally delivers an album with only one chartbuster – Guess what?\n\nAn actor is one who dons different roles in different films. But, Suriya doesn’t oblige to the rules. His action stint from Ayan is copied and so is his ‘daddy’ sentiment from Varanam Aayiram. Hence, you don’t get to see the character, Aadhavan at any point.\n\nIn the film, Suriya plays a hitman. He is also the son of Sayaji Shinde who occurs in probably his worst ever appearance. He is the brother to Anand Babu who returns to Tamil cinema in a badly knit characterization. How can a man attract a woman like Nayantara by performing different yoga aasanas? Well, Suriya as Aadhavan attracts Nayantara in this way. He also attracts the kids with his crazy Power Rangers gimmicks. Filmmakers have been copying District B-13’s famous stunt scene where the protagonist jumps through the glass pane on top of the door and slides through it. Mahesh Babu did it in Pokiri. Jayam Ravi did it in Dhaam Dhoom. Suriya had already done it in Ayan. He does it again in Aadhavan.\n\nHad I walked out of the cinema hall, I wouldn’t have discovered that a seven-bullet carrying revolver can shoot as many twenty bullets without reloading. What I discovered in the first assassination was that James Bond filmmakers were wrong. In Moonraker, Roger Moore wasn’t able to shoot Drake’s hitmen as he was underwater. Here, Suriya shoots a foreigner from underwater with a silenced 9mm. I also learnt that Bazooka bombs were not instant hits, they were equipped with a timer of two minutes. That’s a good technique as it provides Suriya, ample time to regain consciousness and swing up to the bomb to save his family.\n\nThe girl in the 90 second GRT wedding & celebration advertisement stole my heart while the girl in the 160 minute long movie stole my happiness and well-being. I still prefer Marilyn Monroe’s infamous dance from Bus Stop. Why can’t we try something new?\n\nWhen Vadivelu says ‘bore adichu pochu’, he was hinting. We get bored on seeing Suriya’s failed attempts to assassinate the judge. Returning to the screen is Saroja Devi who should have chosen a better movie and not Aadhavan. It is the current trend to speak dialogues at the speed of a lightning and not emphasize on vowels like ‘thamizh’. Over the course of the film, Vadivelu keeps hinting that she is wearing too much makeup. Still, she appears over-glorified and doesn’t change her makeup artist. The MGR stint redone in the film is certainly avoidable. We’re talking of Aadhavan, the merciless killer and not Aadhavan, some bloke who loves MGR films. Our man from KANDHASWAMY, Mexican Pichumani returns as the Paal Paniyaaram loving paternal uncle to Nayantara. Well, I was praying that he would say “Kolkatta-la Pichumaniya theriyaadha aalae illa.”\n\nWhen I heard about Suriya’s ten year avatar, I was expecting Apoorva Sagodaragal, not Forrest Gump. Well, I was in laughter whenever I saw that ‘enlightened’ face and darkened body. Why are we so preachy?\n\nHarris Jayaraj shouldn’t have chosen Aadhavan. His beautiful music has been ruined by bland costumes and pale landscapes. Vaarayo is beautifully sung but badly visualized. But, he delivers with Hasile Fisile. When the song rolls on, the 299-seater Inox Screen 1 jumped in joy.\n\nIf India had a Golden Raspberry Award, Aadhavan would surely be in contest. But, will it beat Kandhaswamy and Villu? We’ll have to wait and see.\n\nA film which can be clearly spotted for its faulty screenplay is Aadhavan. Saroja Devi’s comeback has nothing to offer. Vadivelu’s jokes may be the only form of entertainment. Hasile Fisile is available on Youtube. If you’re going to watch it, please book a funeral with the following words on your tombstone – Braved Everything and Watched Aadhavan.\n\nWoman! God Bless Her!\n\nHappy Go Lucky (R)\n\nDirector: Mike Leigh\n\nCast: Sally Hawkins, Eddie Marsan, Samuel Roukin\n\nGenre: Comedy-Drama\n\nRating: ***\n\nMany a time, men are angry. Everyone needs to get angry. It’s a routine of a daily life. These men work in quiet workplaces such as a library or a bad business store on the corner of the street. Some men have a bad past which makes them get angry on everything wrong doing. Some men don’t enjoy happiness. Count me in too. We possess the anger quotient which keeps us alive to turn red every once a while. People say that a change in our lives may bring us happiness. That’s what Happy Go Lucky is all about.\n\nHappy Go Lucky is a British film which follows the life of Poppy who lives in South London with her friends. Poppy is your energetic, fun-loving thirty-year old single woman who is a school teacher during the day and a clubber at night. Throughout the film, men are shown to be silent, disgraceful and misunderstood. These men include Poppy’s moronic driving instructor, the bookstore clerk, a student in her class and a pauper on the road. It is how Poppy deals with these people using her comic dialogues and wide smile that forms her character. Poppy is positive and desires to spread the smile but she meets a lot of people who cannot even fake a smile.\n\nPoppy’s aide is her best friend Zoe and her younger sister Suzy. Her contacts are however spread over and she finds help anywhere and everywhere. Mike Leigh’s direction is a key figure to the linear narrative of Happy Go Lucky. The old-fashioned titles are too nostalgic for us to forget while the creative ink used in the credits is more of a German Expressionism fanged one. The music is however a little irritating.\n\nHumor is of course the best sideline in this film. The date scene is one of the best in wordy humor. The film talks a lot of positive and negative outlets and the people who want a positive world with no strangers. The cinematography is equally good to the lighting of the film. Choosing some good looking locations, the director has done a fair job with the script. Although the movie starts as a family comedy type, it ends as a rather serious and silly woman flick.\n\nHappy Go Lucky is perhaps the best movie which explains the anger of men. Poppy’s encounter with the bookstore clerk shows the man to be shy or depressed while the driving instructor is protective and discreet. Some of the qualities of anger are best explained in the final outburst between Poppy and Scott. The dialogues of the film play a warrior role as it fights every second to keep the conversation alive. The screenplay certainly deserves a pat.\n\nSally Hawkins as Poppy Cross does the biggest job carrying the burden in her humorous nature.\n\nHappy Go Lucky is a heartwarming comedy drama which explores the heart of Poppy and tells us what she did to a few disturbed men. The film may be long remembered for its joyous tale and livening narration. Of course the British accent can be remembered.\n\nBoy next door meets new girl at work and they fall in love (or do they?)\n\n(500) Days of Summer (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Michael Webb\n\nCast: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Zooey Deschanel\n\nGenre: Romantic Comedy\n\nRating: ***\n\nIt is strange that filmmakers try to attack relationships from every obvious direction. Some like Woody Allen make up new directions to produce love on screen. Here is debutant Michael Webb trying a hand at producing romance on screen. And yes! He does a splendid job. He is accompanied by screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. But, what these men try to convey to the audience is beautifully portrayed by a charismatic Joseph Gordon-Levitt and a beautiful Zooey Deschanel.\n\nOne of the best romcoms I’ve ever seen. It is kept alive every minute either by the wacky insane jokes or the romantic dialogues or the brilliant soundtracks. Being an independent film, it has better scope of knocking off in the worldwide market as a funny and charming romcom. The title cards are a good addition to the film.\n\nThe story opens with a narration which introduces Tom Hansen and Summer Finn, who work in a greeting card company. Days later, their bonding gets stronger but there are no labels marked yet. Are they friends? Are they dating? Or are they in love? These questions pester Tom who decides to ask her about it. The sense of romanticism can be easily extracted from the film for it brings a bridge between men and women.\n\nReturning as yet another wild at heart chick is Zooey Deschanel, who fulfills all the requirements to make a beautiful actress. After playing a disappointing role in G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra, Joseph Gordon-Levitt hits back with a neatly knit role.\n\nPerhaps, a toast to love and relationships, (500) Days of Summer will probably remain as the best film which talks about a boy’s reformation after breaking up. Watch it for the enchanting visuals, witty jokes and remarkable performances by the cast. Oscar nominations anyone?\n\nVirtual Reality Invades Silver Screen\n\nSurrogates (PG-13)\n\nDirector: Jonathan Mostow\n\nCast: Bruce Willis, Radha Mitchell and Rosamund Pike\n\nRating: **\n\nI agree. I love virtual reality. Whether its Virtual Pets or simulations like flying a F22 or driving a car in New York City or a virtual character as in Grand Theft Auto game series, I’m totally hooked up to virtual reality. This film gave me a whole new depth of virtual reality. But, it doesn’t live up as a well made one.\n\nThe best scene in Jonathan Mostow’s graphic novel adaptation is the climax where FBI Agent Tom Greer (Willis) shuts down the surrogates, hence, resulting in an abrupt ending to the state of mind causing the surrogates on the road to collapse and die. Surrogates driving cars and trucks smash against each other and a huge traffic jam is caused in reminiscent to I Am Legend.\n\nThe story goes like… In 2017, mankind depends on surrogacy to do their jobs and chores. But, a mysterious killer is found within the world of surrogacy and the weapon he possesses may destroy the human race. FBI agents, Tom Greer and Jenny Peters unravel the mystery with much complacent attitudes. The rest is assumed to be the crux of the graphic novel which never made business as a bestseller.\n\nIn Neil Blomkamp’s District 9, we have an alien world and a human world. The alien world has a sign which says ‘No Humans Allowed’. In Mostow’s Surrogates, there’s a human world and then the surrogate world. The human world has a sign which says ‘No Robots Allowed’. Surrogates boasts as an intelligent sci-fi thriller but it fails to bring it onscreen.\n\nThe cast is led by a tired Bruce Willis, a half-enigmatic Radha Mitchell and a radiant Rosamund Pike. The film’s technical crew deserves to be applauded. Oliver Wood’s cinematography however is a carbon copy of the Bourne series. The shaky camerawork during the chase sequences certainly annoy the viewer. The Makeup and Hair department have also worked well to give Willis a younger look. Sadly, his surrogate dies soon and you see an old, bald and bearded Willis throughout the rest of the movie.\n\nSurrogates may amuse you but it certainly will not give you the satisfaction you yearned for. It can be avoided for some other popcorn flick.\n\nJust A Bunch Of Gunners Quoting Clint Eastwood And Speaking Idiosyncratic English\n\nQuick Gun Murugan – Misadventures Of An Indian Cowboy (No MPAA Rating)\n\nDirector: Shashanka Ghosh\n\nCast: Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Nasser, Rambha, Anu Menon\n\nGenre: Spaghetti Western spoof\n\nRating: *\n\nClint Eastwood gained stardom for his roles of ‘A Man With No Name’ in Sergio Leone’s spaghetti western trilogy and as Harry in Dirty Harry. Decades later, Shashanka Ghosh directed a TV spot featuring an Indian cowboy named Quick Gun Murugan. Years later, Shah Rukh Khan and M.S. Dhoni used QGM’s phrase “Mind It!” in their film and advertisement. Months later, the sambhar cowboy appears on silver screen. Directed by Shashanka Ghosh, it can’t get even bigger and better. But, this is what we think before watching it. After watching it, you begin to sense the physical calamities that will follow.\n\nQuick Gun Murugan is 70% Tamil, 25% English and the rest 4% Telugu and Hindi. The remaining 1% is the laughter (sometimes groans) of the audience. As the film begins, we follow Murugan through an unnamed desert-like place, meeting Rice Plate Reddy and then getting shot by him. Soon, he goes to heaven where he keeps on muttering “I want to go back” and Chitragupta grants him the permission to go back and promote vegetarianism. But, Murugan lands in Mumbai, 25 years later in 2007. Still hunting for Rice Plate Reddy, the chase ensues and humor keeps ticking by the minute.\n\nNow, a few scenes are sure to tickle your bones. To start off, the scenes happening in the headquarters of heaven is a hilarious one. Then, Murugan’s so-called love song with his ladylove, Locket Lover is another funny moment. The third will be Rice Plate Reddy’s humorous imitation of Amitabh Bachchan. The film contains gruesome violence. It is a rare thing that every villain is killed in a headshot and a mass of blood pours out of their head.\n\nDr. Rajendra Prasad as Quick Gun Murugan is quite the role. His accent, body language and comic timing are certainly one of a kind. As Rice Plate Reddy, veteran actor Nasser proves that he can do anything ranging from a comic villain to a serious terrorist. As Mango Dolly, Rambha feels that she has achieved a comeback, but is this any good? As Locket Lover, TV comedian Anu Menon surely makes a mark. As Rowdy MBA, dance choreographer Raju Sundaram tries his best to evoke laughter but is long forgotten like the way I almost forgot to add him in this review.\n\nThe production design is an amazing thing to watch out. The film is heavily accompanied by visual effects. The music converts old Tamil classics into new age wasted remixes. The film begins to bore you halfway through and you wish to have stayed fascinated about the TV spot and not watched a film which will erase all your fascinations.\n\nThe movie runs with a couple of subplots which evoke humor at the wildest sense. That’s all you can find in Quick Gun Murugan. Watch it if you’re desperate, otherwise it can be a sure miss. It’s your money, so better MIND IT!\n\nA Romantic Comedy On The Rocks\n\nA Good Year\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\nCast: Russell Crowe, Marion Cotillard and Albert Finney\n\nRating: **\n\nWhat do we really require to live a good life? It’s certainly a good job, a good apartment, a good car, a good mistress, a good fortune and a good year. Directed by Ridley Scott, pay no heed. Just pick it up and watch it. It’s quite a rollicking adventure from Long Live England to Viva La France. A Good Year is also produced by Scott and is based on the book by Peter Mayle. The film is visually arresting and irresistible. It has an amazing cast. It includes Russell Crowe, Albert Finney, Marion Cotillard, Abbie Cornish and Freddie Highmore. The film has quite a simple storyline but what it evokes in you is laughter and enjoyment. Bearing in mind that A Good Year is a romantic comedy, it won’t make you turn bitter watching the same lovesick people squabble among each other. The film is based on women and wine.\n\nMax Skinner is a British trader who gets news of his uncle’s death. His uncle who happens to be his only surviving (now dead) relative hasn’t written any will and thus his property in France will be inherited by Max. Max’s first intention is to sell the estate and the vineyard which his uncle has left behind. But, trouble lands when Uncle Henry’s illegitimate daughter Christie Richards arrives to the estate. Fearing that the illegitimate daughter may have a claim, Max tries his best to ward off Christie. Soon, he learns that Christie has no intention of staying in France and decides to go back to California. Halfway through the film, we’re introduced to Fanny Chenal who seems to know a lot about Max. The mystery lies in the flashback. Does Max go back to the estate or does he stay rich in London. That forms the crux of A Good Year which I would call an artistic rom-com by Ridley Scott. The film is pepped up with humor which will certainly tickle your bones.\n\nNow, we all have seen films with French Romance or to put in plain words, Romance in the French country with a French woman. Two Days In Paris is an awesome example of French Romance. But, the problem is that Two Days In Paris is more of a mature one while A Good Year is a fancy one. It is something which will keep you smiling throughout. Ever since Last Tango In Paris, screenwriters have always wanted their scripts to contain more French and less horrific English whenever it comes to writing a scene where the location is France. You see that here too. That’s where Scott’s gone soft. Marc Klein’s unabashed script is faulty at times. But, Scott and his crew do their best to keep up the film’s pace.\n\nAs Max Skinner, Russell Crowe proves a mighty jig. His fast-forward life and the way he speaks British English and juggles between some less profound curse words is something we would’ve seen in his previous films. As the young Max Skinner, Freddie Highmore does a good job just like his older counterpart. As Uncle Henry, Albert Finney lives a short role which he sweetens to the tip. As Henry’s illegitimate daughter Christie, Abbie Cornish makes a mark. But, the best performance with less screen time is Marion Cotillard’s Fanny Chenal.\n\nA Good Year is a sweet tale. Bear in mind it’s a tale and don’t expect your livid reality to be screened. It is simply about two manly desires – Women & Wine.\n\nThe Rooster’s Fairy Tale\n\nKandhaswamy\n\nDirector: Susi Ganeshan\n\nCast: ‘Superhero’ Chiyaan Vikram, Shriya Saran\n\nGenre: Superhero (supposedly)\n\nRating: ZERO out of ten million stars shining bright in the sky\n\nWhen Alice In Chains sang “Yeah! Here comes the rooster!” way back in 1993, little did they know that Susi Ganeshan would make their dreams come true. Yeah! Here comes the rooster! KANDHASWAMY!\n\n“Mexico-la Pichumaniya theriyaadha aalae illa” which means “There’s no one in Mexico who doesn’t know me, Pichumani” is the best dialogue written by Susi Ganeshan. The dialogue and the speaker make no connection. The guy (Alex) who looks like a beggar, dresses in those fine silk suits. But, that’s what Susi Ganeshan is telling us. A person who credits himself five times in the opening credits – Beginning with ‘A Film By Susi Ganeshan’ and then ‘Story By Susi Ganeshan’, ‘Screenplay By Susi Ganeshan’, ‘Dialogues By Susi Ganeshan’ and finally ends with ‘A Susi Ganeshan Film’. Think of the levels of brainwash performed by this man.\n\nVillu was a film which made history. History as the worst film ever made with a BIG budget. Its predecessor was Kuruvi which still holds the record for the Best Long Jump (from a rooftop to the train running on the bridge erected on River Cooum. The distance between the two would probably be half a kilometer) but Kuruvi lost the award for the best fight scene to Villu where, Vijay is buried in a Texas Funeral and he digs himself out and fights the baddies to death. Both the films were nominated for Best Villain but lost to Ajith Kumar’s Aegan where Suman became the most funniest and pathetic villain. Villu was nominated for the best heart-stopping dialogue “Avan yaaru theriyuma! Avan appa yaaru theriyuma!” Which means “Do you know who he is! Do you know who his father is!” And do note that there’s no question mark, there’s an exclamation mark!\n\nWell, all this effort has gone waste. Kandhaswamy definitely has the longest jump, and it’s performed by Shriya Saran, who jumps from the traffic signal (and mind it, there’s no run up or anything, she just jumps like Spiderman) to the back seat of a bike which probably would’ve crossed the city limits by the time she finishes flying in the air, people finish staring with their dropped jaws and the multiple editing cuts. Kandhaswamy also wins the Best Fight Scene. But, the Academy has decided to share it between two. Both scenes are from the same film. The first one is where thugs come running at the speed of Schumacher’s Ferrari and our man leaves way for the high-speed thugs to go past and hit the tree behind (and trust me, there’s always a tree behind). The second is the jaw dropping fight scene in a field in Mexico. This fight being arranged by Mexico Pichumani features a blindfolded and handcuffed Kandhaswamy who is about to get killed by seven gunmen standing around him with one gun in each hand. So, it’s a total of seven guns. But, an SUV comes through sending the seven men bouncing away and when it comes near our man, he lies flat on his back and the car goes over him. Yet, like The Matrix (Nope, Keanu Reeves is no match to our man) he gets up in a second. He then “hears” the footsteps of his attackers and much like the other fight scene, he avoids all the moves making the seven gunmen tired and panting. Wait a second, did I say seven GUNmen? Yes I did. The seven guns went missing after their bounce and Scotland Yard must be hired to find the missing guns. Our man still blindfolded and handcuffed does the neat trick of hitting everyone. Best Villain Award also goes to Kandhaswamy for our man, Mexico Pichumani. The Heart Stopping Dialogue Award goes to Kandhaswamy and it is spoken by Vikram when he asks Mumaith Khan, how much the antagonist had paid her for a private dance and she replies ‘thirty lakhs’ (three million for all you western people). To this Vikram says “That could’ve helped 200 families stay out of starvation for a month”. Kandhaswamy also wins the award for longest running comedy film. It has a running time of 200 minutes and it’s not Vadivelu who makes you laugh.\n\nKandhaswamy and Sivaji are interrelated. In Sivaji, Rajnikanth is a normal lad who steals money from the rich and cunning while in Kandhaswamy, Vikram is a CBI officer who raids first and then steals from the rich and cunning. Kandhaswamy shows that Global Recession is also affecting actors. Vikram does the rooster’s wakeup call when he dons the mettle of Kandhaswamy which is seriously funny. Perhaps, he is no superhero at all. He is helped by eleven men and he can’t fly on his own. So, I take it back. Kandhaswamy isn’t a superhero movie.\n\nSusi Ganeshan is really clever. He knew that the film would make us sleep. Hence, he brought in the rooster attire superhero to wake us up like a morning call. Moreover, he has Devisri Prasad aiding the wake up alarm with his sore and blatant vocals. The choreography seems to have been copied from kids. Maybe, Susi Ganeshan was true to his word and tried to attract the kids in at least one scene.\n\nIf there’s a movie you can use as an example for ‘how not to mess around and waste 40 crores (or 400 million) rupees’, it’s Kandhaswamy.\n\nDon’t waste your money like how I did. Save your precious money. You can help a family not die of starvation for a day at least.\n\nWho Will Watch Watchmen?\n\nWatchmen\n\nDirector: Zack Snyder\n\nCast: Malin Akerman, Jackie Earl Haley, Billy Crudup, Carla Gugino and Patrick Wilson\n\nRating: *\n\nWatchmen has the famous quote – Who Watches Watchmen. Well, who will watch Watchmen? What a waste of time! Two long hours and forty two impatient minutes! I could’ve taken a comfortable nap rather than watch an uncomfortable movie. Watchmen was a successful comic book which saw maturity and violence. The film adaptation however is a gruesome one. Severe gore and unwanted action gimmicks performed by the masked avengers does make Zack Snyder’s film a dislikeable one. Supported by a heavy B-list ensemble, DC’s vigilante comic book series is made into a pathetic film.\n\nUSSR and USA never engaged in nuclear combat during the Cold War. The Cold War was just spying on each other’s country and knowing who was technologically fit and who was economically superior. We all know the result of that. But, Watchmen’s alternative universe provides complete fascination. JFK is assassinated by the Comedian. Richard Nixon looks better in Frost/Nixon rather than in Watchmen. When did he have a nose like the bald eagle?\n\nI have read the whole comic book series which I found half amusing. It is the perception of Americans trying to bring a future where there is no hope. All the movies – I Am Legend, Children of Men and Terminator Salvation share a common thought. The world will be destroyed by some catastrophe and there will a future of hopelessness and chaos.\n\nVisual Effects have been thrown into Watchmen but there is not a single good visual frame. Quantum of Solace had 900 graphically created visuals and they all looked amazing. Watchmen has more than a thousand visuals which look quite normal. Zack Snyder’s previous film 300 was much better when compared to this.\n\nTalking about the cast – Malin Akerman’s Silk Spectre II may not have any proper characteristic but her Laurie Jupiter portrayal is a better one. Patrick Wilson is better as Daniel Dreiberg rather than Nite Owl. Rorschach is a good portrayal by Jackie Earl Haley. As Dr. Manhattan is a graphical representation, Billy Crudup’s sensational style and looks have been cut short to a flashback of four minutes. Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s Eddie Blake is probably the best of the characters for he has more screen space. Carla Gugino’s Sally Jupiter is another lively portrayal.\n\nWatchmen’s background score and soundtracks are probably a good one. The montage during the opening credits is an amazing one. But, Snyder could have done a better job. The slowly narrated script may also be a problem.\n\nWatchmen is certainly made for the fans of the comic book. Others back off! This isn’t a film you will enjoy. This is quite a blunder and can be avoided.\n\nReturn Of The Future And T800s\n\nTerminator Salvation\n\nDirector: McG\n\nCast: Christian Bale, Sam Worthington.\n\nRating: *\n\nFurious action from the first frame to the last. You can’t find a second to let your eyes rest. That’s McG’s Terminator Salvation. The film is amazingly believable. It makes sense to the first film. We really are happy to see Dark Knight fight without a mask. Undergoing a rapid changeover, the film is not your usual time travel and hunt for the Connors. It is set in the future and depicts the war between Skynet and humanity. The film offers you a leg up on how the first film was formed. That’s an amazing thing to notice. Secondly, all events of the first film happen with a reason.\n\nIf there was Shoot ‘Em Up which had Clive Owen shooting men here and there, we have Terminator Salvation where Christian Bale shoots the machines here and there. Accompanied by heavy animation, the film seems to be yet another big task for Industry Lights & Magic.\n\nThe film is full of action as I said and it moves in an amazing speed. But, McG does give way to those regular speed bumps. Terminator Salvation also has a fresh cast. Christian Bale is John Connor, Bryce Dallas Howard plays Kate Connor and Anton Yelchin plays a teenage Kyle Reese. Thus, McG’s new cocktail seems to be full of energy.\n\nHelen Bonham Carter’s cameo in the beginning is a better laid one. Bryce Dallas Howard replaces Claire Danes in this film as Kate Connor. Ms. Howard must know that Claire Danes’ Kate Connor was blonde and not redhead. Moon Bloodgood’s tomboyish Blair Williams is yet another waste in Terminator Salvation.\n\nThe story opens with a death row inmate, Marcus Wright offering his body to a medical research following his execution by lethal injection. The film moves onto to 2018 where John Connor is leading the resistance in a raid against Skynet. At the same time, Marcus Wright returns to life and finds the world to be new. He then joins Kyle Reese as they head to the Resistance HQ. Marcus’ allies change one by one as he reaches John Connor. Twists and turns lead to new paths and cause more jeopardy.\n\nSam Worthington’s metallic acting and Christian Bale’s stainless steel looks make them think that they’re soldiers of the Salvation Army but definitely cannot be accepted as an actor. Bale’s grunts are a little irritating though.\n\nTerminator Salvation has an amazing screenplay. The plot points are remarkable ones. The BGM by Danny Elfman is another boon to the film. The dark beats are certainly the best of his scores following his soothing tunes in Milk. McG has pulled off a remarkable performance and has noted the depth of each Terminator film.\n\nTerminator Salvation is certainly THE movie for the fans. It’s got Bale, Worthington and others. It’s got McG leading them all. It’s got a hell load of graphics to keep your eyes moving. It is worth a watch."
