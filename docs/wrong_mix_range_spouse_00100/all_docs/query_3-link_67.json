        "text": "Hilarie Burton had a mini One Tree Hill reunion over the weekend, and there’s a photo to prove it.\n\nToday, the 37-year-old actress shocked fans when she announced that she tied the knot with her longtime partner, Jeffrey Dean Morgan. They exchanged vows in an “intimate ceremony” that was officiated by the actor’s former co-stars, Jensen Ackles (Supernatural) and Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead).\n\nWhile many believed the couple had already exchanged vows back in 2014, Morgan proved us wrong when he shared a wedding photo on Instagram. The candid pic features the newlyweds posing with their two children—Augustus (9) and George (1)—along with Burton’s former One Tree Hill co-star, Sophia Bush.\n\nMorgan captioned the post, “Ok. A few words… It was an intimate ceremony…performed by @jensenackles and @bigbaldhead with our kids at our sides…and the party of the century afterwards…thank you to all our friends and family. It was, without a doubt…the best day of our lives. Ever ever. Just never knew that it could be so damn perfect. It was. And more.”\n\nBurton also celebrated the news on her personal Instagram account. She shared a photo of the newlyweds kissing just moments after they said, “I do.”\n\n“Jeff and I just want to put it out there that WE GOT MARRIED! For real,” she wrote. “We’ve lived as husband and wife for a decade. We’ve built a family, and a farm and found our community.”\n\nCongratulations to the newlyweds…again."
