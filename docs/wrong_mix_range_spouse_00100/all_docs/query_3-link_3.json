        "text": "Credit: Shutterstock\n\nHilarie Burton and Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s Relationship Timeline: From Hollywood Stars to Farm Owners\n\nHilarie Burton and Jeffrey Dean Morgan have enthralled fans with their sweet relationship, which quickly evolved after they met in May 2009. Burton hit it off with the Walking Dead actor instantly, thanks in part to her former One Tree Hill costar Danneel Ackles’ interference. Morgan, for his part, had his Supernatural costar Jensen Ackles to thank for introducing the pair that spring. The couple didn’t tie the knot until October 2019, but throughout their first 10 years together, they grew in their love, and welcomed two children: Gus and George, in 2010 and 2018, respectively. Two years later, the pair reflected on their introduction to one another and how they’ve evolved as a couple since their blind date. “The smokin hot @jeffreydeanmorgan showed up and it was game over,” Burton recalled via Instagram in May 2021. “Here’s to being crazy kids, living all over the country, giving birth to two doppelgängers, getting gray hair and still being totally inappropriate ... together.” Scroll down to relive Burton and Morgan’s relationship highs and lows:\n\nCredit: Courtesy Mischief Farm/Instagram\n\n2018\n\nThe twosome bought Mischief Farm in upstate New York after living in the area for years. The 100-acre space is home to cattle, miniature donkeys, dogs, chickens, ducks and alpacas. “On our very first date, we asked one another, ‘What do you want for the future?’ We both answered, ‘To live and raise a family on a farm,’” Burton Morgan and Morgan wrote on their farm’s official website. “The joy we have found in this lifestyle of hard work and chores and mountains of manure is something we wish for everyone. If you’re visiting us here at the virtual farm, our hope is that you too will declare what you want for your own future and take the risks necessary to see it happen.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy Hilarie Burton/Instagram\n\nMay 2019\n\n“To my one and only ... @hilarieburton there are no words to express to you, both my love ... and incredible luck in fooling you into diggin me,” the Watchmen actor wrote via Instagram on the couple’s milestone anniversary. “10 years ago we met and that was that. So ... not only happy anniversary, but more importantly? Happy Mother’s Day. Not a day goes by that we other three don’t know just how lucky we are. All the love. Always. Forever. PS: You sure are the pretty one.”\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/Shutterstock\n\nOctober 2019\n\n“This past weekend was the best of my entire life. Jeff and I just want to put it out there that WE GOT MARRIED! For real,” the Surprised by Love actress wrote via Instagram, revealing that the couple were legally married. “We’ve lived as husband and wife for a decade. We’ve built a family, and a farm and found our community.” She described the wedding as “private and magical and everything I dreamed.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy Hilarie Burton/Instagram\n\nDecember 2019\n\n“Ten years ago, I was pregnant, unemployed, unsure about where I was gonna live or give birth and despite the bravado I may have projected, I was scared,” Burton Morgan wrote via Instagram while reflecting on the past decade with Morgan. “My whole life I’d thought I would follow the same path as everyone I’d grown up around. Have a steady job. Get married. Buy a house. Have kids. But the path didn’t unfold that way at all.”\n\nShe explained that 2019 was “incredibly good to our family” and that the wedding she thought she wanted at age 26 was “made so much sweeter by waiting.” The actress gave her husband a shout-out, adding, “My love for @jeffreydeanmorgan has evolved into something so much deeper and golden. Our children participated and were at our sides for all of it. It was the celebration of an entire decade. As I see all the year in review posts today, my entire year - my entire decade really - can be summed up in that one day.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy Hilarie Burton/Instagram\n\nApril 2020\n\nThe actors teamed up to host AMC’s Friday Night In With the Morgans amid the coronavirus pandemic. “My husband pitched the show without even telling me. I think he saw me trying to maintain a healthy household for two little kids while also watching the news at night and becoming completely overwhelmed,” Burton Morgan told Architectural Digest in May 2020. “We want this half hour to be a lighthearted but sensitive space where people can go after a long week. It’s also nice for us because it’s the one hour out of the week that we get to be together. It feels nice to keep our AMC crew working, and it’s also good because we’ve been profiling the efforts that people across the country are making, including small business owners, farmers, and doctors. This idea of supporting as many people as possible was an important element to me.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy Hilarie Burton/Instagram\n\nMay 2020\n\nThe Summer Villa star paid tribute to her husband ahead of the release of her book, The Rural Diaries, explaining how his support shaped her, their family and her writing. “But the biggest thank you of all goes to my forever Valentine, @jeffreydeanmorgan! This farm has seen us through so many ups and downs,” she shared via Instagram. “Births and losses. Being your teammate makes all the unexpected turns manageable. You have given me a life worth writing about, and I love you. Plain and simple. I love you.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Jeffrey Dean Morgan/Instagram\n\nAugust 2021\n\nMorgan revealed that he and his wife took their children to Massachusetts for a family vacation at the beach and gave Burton a special shout-out.\n\n\"We escaped for a few days to Cape Cod, a tiny 400sq ft cottage on the sand. Magical. It’s our last night here, and don’t want it to end because it was just… perfect,\" the Walking Dead alum explained via Instagram. \"@hilarieburton thank you. For everything. Always. To my punks… y’all kill me in the greatest of ways.\"\n\nThe actress commented, \"I adore you, Jeffrey. Let’s keep exploring together forever.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Hilarie Burton/Instagram\n\nAugust 2021\n\nAs the final season of The Walking Dead started airing, Burton Morgan commented on her husband's Instagram to let him know just how proud she is — and how sexy he is in character.\n\n\"Proud of you. Proud of your hard work and grateful for all the lifelong friendships this job has brought to our family,\" the author commented. \"And proud of how absof--kinglutely HOT Negan is. 💖\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Hilarie Burton/Instagram\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nBurton Morgan shared a “husband appreciation post” via Instagram to thank Morgan for all his support as she wrapped her true crime series It Couldn’t Happen Here.\n\n“In the last few years, I’ve changed up jobs quite a bit. Producing. Writing. Podcasting. Every once in a while an acting job sparks my interest. And on top of that I’m creating chaos around the property, renovating rooms and adding to the garden and making a general mess,” she wrote in the lengthy caption.. “My husband @jeffreydeanmorgan has supported every bit of it.”\n\nShe continued, “He has supported me so thoroughly in this new chapter - from conception of the series, to filming, to releasing it out into the world. So I want to say thank you to the person who picks up the slack so I can disappear into work, and makes me feel capable of trying new things. You’re a catch. 💖”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Hilarie Burton/Instagram\n\nApril 2022\n\nThe duo announced via social media that they had teamed up to create Mischief Farms Libations, an alcohol brand that features whiskey and gin.\n\n“My husband and I, we like classics — I'm wearing the same leather coat that I bought 12 years ago,” Burton Morgan told Bustle at the time, commenting on the premise of the brand. “We want things that are evergreen in our business, so coming with two liquors that we feel really proud of, that’s fun for us.”\n\nShe said of the name, which is also the moniker of their family farm, “Mischief is the fountain of youth. We have a sense of boldness when we're young that gets beat out of us with taxes and all the grown-up s--t we have to do. We like to maintain a sense of curiosity about what we work on, so with these liquor flavors too, we're like, ‘We don't want to just do typical stuff that everybody else is doing.’”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Hilarie Burton/Instagram\n\nApril 2022\n\nThe couple launched their alcohol brand, MF Libations, on Morgan’s 56th birthday. Burton Morgan shared a video of the inception of the company via social media before gushing over her husband on his special day.\n\n“Jeffrey, you believed in mischief from day one. From the town square in Santa Fe to trick or treating in the Garden District of New Orleans, to the beaches of Miami, and the cobblestone streets of Spain …. you have made life a massive adventure,” she wrote. “And home is wherever we are all together. But the farm, and the sanctuary you’ve built there … that’s the thing I’m proudest of. So happy to be bottling that feeling with you and sharing it. Happiest Birthday babe.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy Jeffrey Dean Morgan/Twitter\n\nJune 2022\n\nAfter Burton Morgan opened up having an abortion following a miscarriage, Morgan defended his wife's decision via social media. \"I got OPINIONS. You don’t like em? Piss off. Go follow someone else,\" he tweeted alongside a photo of himself wearing a pro-Roe T-shirt. \"I’m in a block n delete kinda mood today. Before you clap back with some bulls–t … read my wife’s last instagram post … and tell me I have no skin in the game.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Jeffrey Dean Morgan/Instagram\n\nDecember 2022\n\nThe proud parents supported their son’s first play, a local production of A Christmas Carol.\n\n“Like… I can’t even write this without getting choked up. It was Gus first time performing in anything like this… and with a large audience… I was WAY more nervous than Gus was! He killed it,” Morgan wrote in a lengthy tribute via Instagram.\n\nBurton commented on the post saying: “Big ol tears streaming down your face. The sweetest. Love my boys. Xoxox.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Hilarie Burton/Instagram\n\nMay 2024\n\nThe couple celebrated the 15th anniversary of their 1st date alongside Gus and George.\n\n“Fifteen years, @jeffreydeanmorgan asked me to come out Memorial Day weekend and visit him in New Mexico so he could take me on a date before I left the States to live in the apartment I’d rented in Paris,” Burton wrote via Instagram alongside a family photo. “It’s been a very long date 💖.”\n\nJeffrey, for his part, commented on the post: “You forgot awesome. Long and real awesome. Xxx.”"
