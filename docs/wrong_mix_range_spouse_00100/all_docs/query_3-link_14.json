        "text": "Following a decade of conveying themselves as a married couple, actors Jeffery Dean Morgan and Hilarie Burton of Pleasant Valley have tied the knot.\n\nThe couple, who live together with their two children on a Pleasant Valley farm, were married on Saturday, according to a post on Burton's Instagram account.\n\n\"It was private and magical and everything I dreamed,\" Burton wrote. \"So yeah. I'm Mrs. Morgan.\"\n\nThe announcement came as a shock to many. The Journal is among the media outlets that have previously asked Burton and Morgan directly about their relationship status and have been told they were married.\n\nBurton in her post explained though they hadn't taken vows, \"from the moment I met (Morgan), he was my husband.\n\n“We’ve lived as husband and wife for a decade,” Burton wrote. “We’ve built a family, and a farm and found our community. For years, publications have reported that we got married in 2014 or 2015 and that I’ve been married and divorced before. All untrue. But we knew our truth. So it felt silly to try and correct anything.”\n\nAccording to Morgan's Instagram account, the ceremony was \"intimate;\" included their children; and Norman Reedus and Jensen Ackles, his co-stars from \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Supernatural,\" respectively, helped officiate. The ceremony was followed by \"the party of the century,\" he wrote.\n\n\"It was, without a doubt...the best day of our lives. Ever ever,\" Morgan wrote on Instagram.\n\nMorgan and Burton — she is known for television's “One Tree Hill\" — own a 100-acre farm in Pleasant Valley. The couple, along with actor and Dutchess County resident Paul Rudd, are partners in Samuel's Sweet Shop in Rhinebeck.\n\nAnd Burton has taken a lead role in coordinating renovations at Astor Services for Children & Families in Rhinebeck. Burton, Morgan and Rudd have raised money for the Astor renovations with their \"Ghost Stories\" events at Bard College in Annandale and UPAC in Kingston.\n\nThe wedding came on the same day Morgan appeared at New York Comic Con, promoting \"The Walking Dead.\"\n\nJohn W.
