Burton said that Morgan "pursued her."

"When he came along, he was so sure of himself," Burton told People in 2020. "I was not a girl anyone pursued. I've always been alpha. And Jeffrey was like, 'You're going to be my girlfriend.'"

She added: "It was so nice to be pursued. He's a cute dude! And I liked that he knew exactly who he was. His confidence was intoxicating."

In her 2020 memoir, Burton would go on to say that she and Morgan "weren't made for dating."

"He was the man I was gonna get old and boring with," the actress wrote. "Instead of late nights out at clubs or wining and dining, at night we'd settle in and watch an episode of 'Lonesome Dove.'"

For years, it was incorrectly reported that the couple got married in 2014.

Publications referred to the actors as husband and wife, citing 2014 as the year they wed, but it was untrue.

"For years, publications have reported that we got married in 2014 or 2015 and that I've been married and divorced before," Burton said in a 2019 Instagram post, referring to rumors she was married to "OTH" assistant director Ian Prange from 2004 to 2009.

"All untrue," Burton said. "But WE knew our truth. So it felt silly to try and correct anything."

2015: Burton appeared on a few episodes of CBS' "Extant," which Morgan starred on.

She guest-starred as Anna Schaefer on season two of the series. Her "OTH" costar Tyler Hilton also had a recurring role on the show.

February 16, 2018: Burton and Morgan welcomed their second child, daughter George Virginia Morgan.

Burton revealed the news in an Instagram post shared in early March of that year and spoke candidly about their conception challenges.

"It took a long time for Jeffrey and I to have this baby," the actress said. "The first time I got pregnant, it took a year and a half. I surprised him on Christmas with baby Seahawk booties. We cried. We celebrated. We picked out names. And we lost that baby."

Burton said that "more losses followed" in the years it took for her to have another baby.

Because of her past experiences, she said they were "cautious" when she became pregnant with their daughter.

"I didn't want to celebrate for fear of jinxing it," she said. "I didn't want a baby shower. I checked her heartbeat every day, up until the day she was born. And now that she is here, I just stare at her in wonder all day. I see her in her daddy's arms and I don't take any of it for granted."

Morgan also delivered both of their children.

"We didn't use doctors, we used a midwife, so I delivered both of my kids," he told People in 2018. "The first time I didn't know, I was shocked that I was part of itâ€¦ [The second] time I was a little bit more prepared and got in and got her out immediately."

He continued: "You've created and molded the family I figured I could only dream of... I figured wrong. I love you. I love you for everything. But how I love you for this family you've given us."

"We've lived as husband and wife for a decade," she said. "We've built a family and a farm, and found our community."

The actress continued: "From the moment I met @jeffreydeanmorgan, he was my husband. Rather than make vows right out of the gate, we lived them. For over 10 years. The good times and the bad."

In her book, Burton said that they picked New York City's Bowery Hotel as their event location because they were "drawn to the history and mischief of the neighborhood."

The couple was joined at the wedding by their children, select friends and family, and some of their former costars.

"OTH" stars Sophia Bush, Bethany Joy Lenz, and Danneel Ackles were in attendance along with "Supernatural" actors Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, and Norman Reedus. Jensen and Reedus performed the ceremony.

Guests were also given packets of marigold flower seeds straight from the couple's garden.

Burton went on to say that her life didn't turn out the way she originally thought, but "2019 was incredibly good to our family."

"The wedding I thought I wanted when I was 26 was made so much sweeter by waiting," she continued. "My love for @jeffreydeanmorgan has evolved into something so much deeper and golden. Our children participated and were at our sides for all of it. It was the celebration of an entire decade."

"I met him when I was 26, and he saw me for who I wanted to be," she said. "And then he kicked down every obstacle to get us here."
