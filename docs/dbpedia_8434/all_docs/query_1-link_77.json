        "text": "Abstract\n\nPIP: A sample of 2100 women from administrative districts in Malawi was constructed in 1926 to obtain information on fertility, mortality, and the distribution of native populations. This paper uses the 1926 data to estimate fertility, infant mortality, and child mortality and to validate results. The Censuses prior to 1970 were ignored as demographic indicators. The 1926 data were found to be consistent internally; the fertility level and the pattern of fertility has remained constant over a long period. Results correspond to figures generated by the Central Statistical Office from the 1977 Census. The average annual rate of growth (intrinsic growth rates) for the period 1901-45 was 2.24% compared with the female life table method rates of 2.11%. Stable age distribution for males and females was constructed from life tables and the intrinsic growth rates, i.e., 37.78% of females were 12.7 years when interpolated linearly, which was the same figure as the reported age distribution. The 1926 Census reported 179,559 males and 177,110 females 7 years; when 60% of the stable age distribution of children 0-4 years is added to 60% of those 5-9 years, the estimated numbers are 176,510 males and 180,606 females. The Census numbers are 1.73% greater for males and 1.94% lower for females, which is considered to be close enough. The stable estimate of males in 1926 is 57,986 more than the enumerated population, which could be accounted for by migration figures from the Census of 1926, the Rhodesian Census of Malawians at that time: 50-66,000, and other research reports. Stable birth rates were estimated as 57.4/1000 population for males and 53.2/1000 population for females, and weighted per share in the total population as a birth rate of 55.2/1000 population for both sexes. Estimates from the 1977 Census compare favorably at 55.3/1000/year. Infant mortality was estimated as 239/1000, or 38% died at 5 years and 45% at 10 years. Life expectancy was 30.4 years for males and 33.5 years for females. The 1977 Census estimates were 190/1000 births for 1967-77 with 32% dying at 5 years and 37% at 10 years. The total fertility rate for 1926 is estimated at 7 or more children/woman which had been constant until after independence in 1964. Mortality was also constant at 240/1000 live births. Explanations are given of the data and their evaluation and analytical procedures."
