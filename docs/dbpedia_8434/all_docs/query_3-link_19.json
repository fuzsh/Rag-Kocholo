        "meta_description": "According to World Bank figures, in 2023 more than 70 per cent of Malawi’s population was living in extreme poverty. Since then, the collapse of the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather events and rapidly rising prices for food and petrol as a consequence of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine have made the situation even worse.",

        "text": "There are far-reaching deficiencies in education and healthcare in Malawi. The quality of teaching at schools is poor, and almost 15 per cent of girls and boys do not complete primary school. A third of the adult population lacks even basic reading and writing skills.\n\nAlthough Malawi’s infant, child and maternal mortality rates have been reduced significantly in recent years, they remain high compared with those of other countries. In 2021, just under eight per cent of adults between the ages of 15 and 49 years were HIV positive, down from 15 per cent in 2000.\n\nMalaria, tuberculosis and respiratory diseases are widespread. In addition, since early 2022 Malawi has been suffering under the worst cholera epidemic the country has ever recorded. Due to the extensive spread of the disease and the rising number of deaths, the government declared a public health emergency in December 2022 which lasted until August 2023.\n\nA huge strain for Malawi’s development is the rapidly expanding population, which in 2022 2.6 per cent). More than 40 per cent of the people living in Malawi are under the age of 15. The United Nations has calculated that, by 2050, the country’s population will be almost double its current 20 million. Without a radical change in the economic and social conditions in Malawi, there is a danger that such huge population growth may prove disastrous for goals like achieving a peaceful society and food security.\n\nThe consequences for the environment are also cause for concern. Since the growing population needs more and more firewood, large areas of Malawi have been deforested. More than half of the country’s land area is already affected by erosion and soil degradation."
