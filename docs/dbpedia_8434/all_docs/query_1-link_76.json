Digital 2022 report on Malawi in the “full report” section below, but let’s start by taking a look at the essential headlines for digital adoption and use in Malawi this year.\n\nMalawi’s population in 2022\n\nMalawi’s total population was 19.91 million in January 2022.\n\nData show that Malawi’s population increased by 525 thousand (+2.7 percent) between 2021 and 2022.\n\n50.7 percent of Malawi’s population is female, while 49.3 percent of the population is male.\n\nAt the start of 2022, 18.0 percent of Malawi’s population lived in urban centres, while 82.0 percent lived in rural areas.\n\nNote: gender data are currently only available for “female” and “male”.\n\nMalawi’s population by age\n\nThe median age of the population in Malawi is 18.5.\n\nFor additional context, here’s a look at how the population in Malawi breaks down by age group:\n\n15.1 percent of Malawi’s population is between the ages of 0 and 4.\n\n21.8 percent of Malawi’s population is between the ages of 5 and 12.\n\n12.3 percent of Malawi’s population is between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\n14.0 percent of Malawi’s population is between the ages of 18 and 24.\n\n15.0 percent of Malawi’s population is between the ages of 25 and 34.\n\n9.7 percent of Malawi’s population is between the ages of 35 and 44.\n\n6.0 percent of Malawi’s population is between the ages of 45 and 54.\n\n3.4 percent of Malawi’s population is between the ages of 55 and 64.\n\n2.7 percent of Malawi’s population is aged 65 and above.\n\nNote: percentages may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.\n\nInternet use in Malawi in 2022\n\nThere were 4.03 million internet users in Malawi in January 2022.\n\nMalawi’s internet penetration rate stood at 20.2 percent of the total population at the start of 2022.\n\nKepios analysis indicates that internet users in Malawi increased by 596 thousand (+17.4 percent) between 2021 and 2022.\n\nFor perspective, these user figures reveal that 15.88 million people in Malawi did not use the internet at the start of 2022, meaning that 79.8 percent of the population remained offline at the beginning of the year.\n\nHowever, issues relating to COVID-19 continue to impact research into internet adoption, so actual internet user figures may be higher than these published numbers suggest (see here for further details).\n\nFor the latest insights into internet adoption and use around the world, follow our regular Global Statshot reports.\n\nGo global: see how Malawi’s current “state of digital” compares with connectivity in other countries by reading our flagship Digital 2022 Global Overview Report, which includes hundreds of slides of global digital data, and our in-depth analysis of what these numbers might mean for you.\n\nInternet connection speeds in Malawi in 2022\n\nData published by Ookla indicate that internet users in Malawi could have expected the following internet connection speeds at the start of 2022:\n\nMedian fixed internet connection speed: 5.65 Mbps.\n\nOokla’s data shows that fixed internet connection speeds in Malawi decreased by 0.44 Mbps (-7.2 percent) in the twelve months to the start of 2022.\n\nSocial media statistics for Malawi in 2022\n\nThere were 820.4 thousand social media users in Malawi in January 2022.\n\nThe number of social media users in Malawi at the start of 2022 was equivalent to 4.1 percent of the total

Meta’s advertising resources indicates that Facebook had 752.0 thousand users in Malawi in early 2022.\n\nHowever, Meta made important changes to the way its advertising resources report audience reach data at the end of 2021 – including making significant revisions to its base audience data for Facebook – so the figures shown here are not directly comparable with figures published in our previous reports.\n\nTo learn more about these changes, please see this article, as well as our comprehensive notes on data.\n\nThe company’s revised audience figures mean that Facebook’s ad reach in Malawi was equivalent to 3.8 percent of the total population at the start of 2022.\n\nHowever, Facebook restricts the use of its platform to people aged 13 and above, so it’s also worth highlighting that 6.0 percent of the “eligible” audience in Malawi uses Facebook in 2022.\n\nFor additional context, Facebook’s ad reach in Malawi was equivalent to 18.7 percent of the local internet user base (regardless of age) in January 2022.\n\nAt the start of 2022, 34.9 percent of Facebook’s ad audience in Malawi was female, while 65.1 percent was male.\n\nNote: Meta’s advertising resources only publish audience gender data for “female” and “male” users.\n\nLooking for more Facebook stats?
