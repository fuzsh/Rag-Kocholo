        "text": "The average age in sub-Saharan Africa is just 18 – the youngest of any region in the world. In 2009, Africa’s population reached one billion; it will double to two billion by 2050. This edition of the BBC Africa Debate will explore this phenomenon and its implications.\n\nThe debate will address whether the population explosion could be used to propel economic growth for Africa – or if it could backfire.\n\nMalawi is typical of sub-Saharan Africa, with 46 per cent of its population under the age of 15. Some economists see this youthful population as a major opportunity.\n\nJean-Marie Severino, a former Vice President of the World Bank, has written a book about 'Africa’s Moment', arguing that point. But others point out the risks of such rapid population growth – and the potential pitfalls of having too many young people with not enough to do. Already Africa is a region of rapid economic development, with six of the world’s fastest growing economies located on the continent. But this growth has been largely jobless – and those aged 16-24 make up 60 per cent of the unemployed in Africa.\n\nJoin Nkem Ifejika and Nomsa Maseko for this edition of BBC Africa Debate along with an expert panel, special invited guests and audience of young people. They will ask if Africa’s young population presents an opportunity and if Africa can harness the power of its youth to drive, not undermine, development and stability.\n\nPublicity contact: SW"
