        "text": "English is by far the most spoken language in the world (Lingua, 2022). There are around 86 countries with English as the official language or second language. It is spoken by nearly 2 billion people across the globe, and the figure is rapidly increasing (David, 2004).\n\nTo add more to your surprise, the majority of these speakers are non-native speakers and use English as their second language. If you ask why? It’s because they belong to certain countries where English is the official language, but not necessarily a native language. We’ve also created a list of countries with English as an official language for better insight.\n\nList of the countries with English as the official language\n\nWe’ve created a comprehensive list of all the countries across the globe using English as their official language. Note; these countries recognize English as their official language by law. The government bodies i.e., judiciary, legislature, and administration use the English language for internal and external communication in these countries. However, some countries on this list may have more than one official language.\n\nThere are certain countries like the USA, UK, and Australia that haven’t declared their official languages. Yet the most spoken language in these countries is English, and these countries also have the highest number of native English speakers. The governments also use English for official communication in these specific countries.\n\nThere are two terms used to differentiate such countries from the rest. The terms are de facto and de jure. The ‘de facto’ English language status refers to countries that use English as the primary language without official declaration. The ‘de jure’ English language status refers to the countries with English as the official language duly declared in the law.\n\nMap of countries where English is an official language\n\nList of all countries where English is the official Language\n\nFor ease of access, the countries on this list are also divided into regional categories. You can easily look for countries in the European, Asian, South American, and Oceania regions.\n\nList of European countries with English as the official language\n\nEurope is a multilingual region, it’s true the origins of the English language trace back to this part, yet a variety of languages are being spoken there. As far as English is concerned, around 370 million people out of the 450 million total population can speak English in this region. It’s the reason many countries in Europe recognize English as their official language. These include;\n\nBelgium\n\nCyprus\n\nIreland\n\nMalta\n\nDenmark\n\nLuxembourg\n\nGibraltar\n\nIsle of Man\n\nMenorca\n\nPoland\n\nAustria\n\nFinland\n\nList of African countries with English as the official language\n\nThe African region has always been inclined to the west due to reasons such as destitution and lack of resources. Their reliance on the first world made them choose English as their official language for ease of communication. Despite having a rich cultural heritage, many African countries have given de jure status to the English language utterly because of Western dominance. The countries are namely;\n\nGhana\n\nNigeria\n\nThe Gambia\n\nLiberia\n\nSierra Leone\n\nSaint Helena\n\nZambia\n\nSudan\n\nNamibia\n\nSwaziland\n\nTanzania\n\nBotswana\n\nCameroon\n\nMauritius\n\nKenya\n\nMalawi\n\nLesotho\n\nSeychelles\n\nEritrea\n\nRwanda\n\nSomaliland\n\nSouth Africa\n\nZimbabwe\n\nList of Asian countries with English as an official language\n\nMost of the countries in Asia recognize English as their official language mainly because of British occupation. The Britishers used English as the official language in this region for decades. Hence, the change of official language was never feasible for later governments. There are some countries in this region using English as the official language solely because of its acceptability around the world. Here’s the list of Asian countries with English as an official language;\n\nIndia\n\nPakistan\n\nSingapore\n\nPhilippines\n\nMalaysia\n\nMaldives\n\nMyanmar\n\nSri Lanka\n\nBangladesh\n\nBhutan\n\nCambodia\n\nList of countries in South America with English as the official language\n\nThe entire region of South America has only one country using English as the official language. It is Guyana located in the northern part of the South American region. The country was under British rule till 1966. Hence, it recognizes English as the official language.\n\nThe countries in the South American region have been subject to North American and British dominance, but always valued their cultural heritage and language recognition. It’s the reason that this part of the world has never given supreme status to any foreign language.\n\nList of countries in Oceania with English as the official language\n\nThe Oceania region majorly comprises island-like countries. Most of these countries have been under foreign occupation for decades. The Britishers and the French have predominantly ruled over these countries. It’s the reason these countries have adopted English as their official language.\n\nAustralia is the largest country in the Oceania region with the most English speakers, but the country has no official language. Although English has de facto status in the country, it’s not officially declared in law. The reason is Australia welcomes people from different cultures and doesn’t tie anyone to a single language.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nFiji\n\nGuam\n\nMarshall Islands\n\nMicronesia\n\nNauru\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n\nPalau\n\nPitcairn\n\nTuvalu\n\nWhy English is important?\n\nEnglish is often referred to as an international language.
