Martinete, or hammer, is a tool used to strike redhot metal. It is also a variety of la toná flamenco derived from Gypsy ballads and is considered the oldest flamenco. Martinetes and carceleras are varieties of tonás that differ in the themes of their lyrics and are characterized by the absence of guitar accompaniment. The martinete has great dramatic force. The interpretation of the dance is relatively new. Antonio Ruiz Soler first incorporated this palo into his repertoire in the late 1950s.
