        "text": "Spanish poet Fernando Quiíƒ ±ones once likened listening to flamenco without the guitar to eating soup with your fingers. Nevertheless, the instrument is a relative newcomer to the ancient traditions of music and dance that are synonymous with Spain's southernmost province of Andalusia. Only in the late 19th century did artists there start using it to accompany the human voice.\n\n\"They quickly became eternal partners in the evolution of a unique musical form,\" says Paco Peíƒ ±a, one of flamenco's foremost guitarists, on the line from London, where he's lived for more than 30 years. \"In time, the artistic ambitions of the masters took the instrument much further, and it's become a complex and continuously developing expression of flamenco.\"\n\nPeíƒ ±a, who grew up in Cíƒ ³rdoba, is largely self-taught as a guitarist. He started playing at the age of six, learning the basics from his brother and refining his technique by closely observing the maestros-in particular, Seville's late Niíƒ ±o Ricardo. \"All the artists of my generation were enthralled by him,\" says the 62-year-old Peíƒ ±a. \"He was always seeking the right balance between voice and guitar and to bring out emotion and depth. Later I discovered the playing of Ramíƒ ³n Montoya and of Sabicas, who was such an elegant and accomplished musician. It was a great inspiration and challenge for me to follow them.\"\n\nFor several years, Peíƒ ±a performed as a member of various troupes, but the glittery, tourist-brochure image of flamenco they projected was not to his taste. In 1970 he launched a solo career with a highly acclaimed recital in London and soon afterward founded his own company. \"I've tried to stay true to traditional flamenco and its ingredients, both the light and the dark,\" says Peíƒ ±a, an intense and technically brilliant performer. \"At the same time, it's clear the tradition can't stay still, it always needs to be moving, responding to new influences from outside. So in my shows I try to respect both flamenco's past and present.\"\n\nWhen the Paco Peíƒ ±a Flamenco Dance Company comes to the Vogue Theatre this Sunday (February 27), the maestro will be accompanied by guitarists Paco Arriaga and Rafael Montilla, singers Maríƒ ­a Del Mar Ferníƒ ¡ndez and Miguel Ortega, and dancers Charo Espino and Angel Muíƒ ±oz. \"It will be an intimate and comprehensive presentation of flamenco in its various aspects. In the first part the focus is on the guitar, and there will be some dance solos. After that there's a complete show, bringing together all the performers in a way that avoids artificial theatricality or flamboyance.\"\n\nFor his solo pieces, Peíƒ ±a promises to cover a wide range of different palos, or styles of flamenco, though his choice is left open. \"There will likely be soleares, caíƒ ±as, martinete, tangos, and maybe fandangos, but I have the freedom to improvise. I prepare all day, gathering my thoughts and emotions to have the energy to project when the time comes. Hopefully I can inspire myself further by being successful in expressing what I want. It's very demanding, but in the end, if all goes well, I don't feel drained-on the contrary, I'm energized.\""
