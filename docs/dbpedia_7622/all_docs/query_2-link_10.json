        "text": "Cante Jondo and Flamenco in Andalusia and Hispano-America\n\nWALTER STARKIE\n\nTengo un dolor no sé donde,\n\nNacido no sé de qué;\n\nSanaré yo no sé cuando,\n\nSi me cura no sé quién.\n\n—ANDALUSIAN FOLK POEM\n\nIN Travels through Spain in the Years 1775-1776 by Henry Sine-bourne, published in Dublin in 1779, there is an interesting reference to a Gypsy dance called Manguindoy, which he saw performed by Gypsies near Cádiz. “Among the gypsies there is a dance called the Manguindoy which is so indecent that it has been forbidden under severe penalties. This dance and likewise the Fandango have been introduced from Havannah and are apparently of negro origin.” The word Manguindoy comes from the Caló words manguindó and manguindoñé, which are used for Gypsy beggars of both sexes. Thus Manguindoy is a begging dance, which the Gitana dances for the stranger in order to extract some parné or money from him. I have seen the Gitanas in the caves of Guadix or Benalua de Guadix dance a similar lascivious begging dance which is exactly as described by the celebrated eighteenth-century traveler. This dance was in what the Gypsies call Zorongo style and was danced by the girl with exaggerated zarandeo or undulation which they compare to the cernedor or grain-sifter.1 I had seen the same kind of dancing among the dancing girls of Tetuan, Tunis, and Kairwan. It is, however, essentially Gypsy, for in Rumania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia among nomadic tribes I had seen the wild Tanyana danced by an old hag for the chief of the tribe as a ritual of the full moon. I have described it in my book on Hungary and Rumania, Raggle-Taggle. In the Tanyana the dancer imparts so intense a vibratory movement to her hips that she passes into a kind of trance and is possessed by the duende or demon of the dance. The Tanyana, in spite of its feelings and contortions, is part of a solemn ritual of the moon, and the Gypsies watching it sing the song of the moon, a tribal invocation to the God of Nature, celebrating the incestuous union of the Moon-witch Goddess and her brother the Sun:\n\nThe Men: Lado! Lado! Mroi Ganga!\n\n(Leda! Leda! Be my refuge!)\n\nThe Women: Pala! Pala! Mroi Pola!\n\n(Sun! Sun! Be my pride!)2\n\nThe Gypsy, like the Jew and the Arab, was absorbed by Andalusia, and there is no place in the world where the Romanichal found closer racial affinity than in the Tartessian land which possesses the oldest civilization of the Mediterranean; as a proof we find there the finest Gypsy type physically and morally in the world. The Gypsy, moreover, has brought customs of his own to Andalusia, such as fortunetelling from the lines of the hands, which existed in Persia, but was lost among the Arabs until reintroduced by the Gitanos. The Devil of the Gypsies, Beng, is derived from Bheka (frog) in Sanskrit, but probably the Romanichals were originally serpent worshipers, for there is no doubt that they treat the reptile with great respect and try to ward off its evil influence. The Andalusians have adopted this taboo so universally that if a stranger does happen to mention the word snake in an Andalusian house the company immediately exorcize its evil influence by calling out, in chorus, “Lagarto!” (“Lizard!”).\n\nThe Gypsy has accentuated the underlying melancholy of the Andalusian, for whereas the Arab does not think of death, and the Jew shuns using the word for it, the Gypsy revels in talk about funerals, and always brings the subject of death into his singing. In his coplas the old mother is waiting for news of the son who has been killed in the bull ring, or the jealous husband has knifed his young wife. The Gypsy singer is obsessed by the death theme, and it is strange to find the name alegrías (joys) given to a certain class of songs improvised in Flamenco style, which are full of the deepest sadness. The Gypsy, as the Spaniards would say, tiene la alegría de estar triste (rejoices in being sad). The Hungarians, who likewise are so susceptible to Gypsy improvisation when it is done by a Cigany primás, who plays to their face, say: Sirva vigad a Magyár (the Magyar revels in being sad).\n\nOrigin of Cante Jondo\n\nCante Jondo or “Deep Song,” as its name suggests, is a song of deep sadness. It has been very well defined by the Spanish writer and Academician Federico García Sánchez as “the drama of humanity in chains.” The words are the equivalent in Andalusian dialect to Canto hondo, song from the depths of humanity, song of the gaol and the brothel; that is to say, the song of the Gypsy pariahs who live on the fringe of human civilized society. The term was applied to the tribal singing of the Indian Gypsies who brought from the East a new musical style which was embodied in ancient Andalusian folksong.\n\nFalla maintained that the Gypsy tribes who settled in Granada were those who introduced the new element into primitive Andalusian music called Cante Jondo. But he adds emphatically that Cante Jondo “was not created by any single one of the races which contributed to its development: it was a musical style growing out of an Andalusian foundation, which fused with Byzantine liturgical, Arab, and Gypsy elements.”3\n\nThe term Cante Jondo was given to a group of Andalusian folksongs whose prototype, according to Falla, is the Siguiriya Gitana, from which other forms, such as the Polo, Martinete, Debla, Caña, and Soleares, are derived. Some experts like the Andalusian poet Carlos de Luna call the Caña or the Debla the grandmother of the Cante Jondo. The styles of song included in Cante Jondo must be distinguished from the more modern groups of lighter style called by the name Flamenco, which include malagueñas, granadinas, and rondeñas—special styles traditionally associated with Malaga, Granada, and Ronda, where there existed celebrated creators of Gypsified song.\n\nCante Jondo has analogies with types of melodies found in the East. The position of smaller intervals in the scale is not invariable, and their production depends upon the raising or lowering of the voice due to the expression given to the word sung. This leads to the alteration of four out of seven notes of the scale. Thus only three notes are fixed. There is also portamento of the voice, that is to say, a style of singing which produces infinite graduations of pitch between two notes. Another Gypsy element in Cante Jondo is the repetition of the same note to the point of obsession, accompanied by an appoggiatura from above and below. This, according to Falla, is characteristic of certain forms of enchantment.\n\nThe Gypsy Zambra\n\nWe should always remember that music for the Gypsy was forever part of a ritual. His Zambra is always a solemn performance, where there is gravity and melancholy as well as fierce gaiety and joie de vivre.\n\nThe word Zambra is the same as the Arabic Sâmira, which was used by the Moors for revelry by night or a party at which people told stories. It is used today, especially in the caves of the Sacro Monte at Granada, for a collective Gypsy dance. The Arabs were a carrying race and carried the music of Persia and Byzantium to Andalusia, and the celebrated singer and poet of Bagdad, Ziryab, nicknamed “the Blackbird of Song,” became as famous in Cordoba at the court of the Emir Abderrahmann II as he had been at the court of Harun al-Rashid. Cordoba and Seville became the two great centers of literature and music under the triumphant Moors, and there was a saying that when a writer died he bequeathed his books to Cordoba, and when a musician died he donated his music instruments to Seville.\n\nAccording to Rafael Mit Jana there were two kinds of music among the Moors in Spain, cultivated music called Alah and popular, lighter music called Qrihah. The compositions in Alah style were so complicated and full of arabesques that only virtuosos could sing them. Those of Qrihah style were scorned by the artists and “highbrows” and were fit for drunken revelers and frivolous women.\n\nThe music of Moorish Spain after the final expulsion of the Moors from Granada in 1492 was preserved by the exiled race in North Africa in Tetuan, Xauen, and today those ancient songs celebrating the beauties of the Alhambra in the days of Muza and Boabdil are still called nuba ghernata—music of Granada. The word nuba means a suite of short songs and instrumental pieces that resembles in structure the European suites of Corelli, Bach, and other composers. The Moslem suite possesses significant parallels to the classic suite: its daira or prelude, its instrumental overture, its melodies in slow tempo followed by faster rhythmic tunes and by its rapid finale are equivalent to the Prelude, Allemande, Saraband, Minuet, and Giga in Bach.4\n\nThe Moslem and the European suites keep the same keys and develop in the same way, alternating slow and rapid pieces, but their difference lies in the fact that the classic suite is purely instrumental, whereas the Moslem suite consists of singing and dancing. In the past, however, in the Western countries vocal music was combined with dancing and wandering minstrels who used to perform with dancers and singers. With the Moslems, however, there always existed a rigid conservative tradition which dominated their music as well as their lives ever since the far off days when the minstrels sang in the Alhambra or the Albaicín at Granada. The Moslems associate music with magic, and in their gatherings each individual associates the words and melody of each song with the hours of the day and the season of the year. A Moorish concert lasts many hours, from midday until the following morning. During that time many Moorish nubas are performed before an audience of ecstatic aficionados. So strong is the symbolic and magic significance of this music called nuba ghernata that there are certain sects who are devoted to these musical songs, in spite of the prejudices of the orthodox Moslems who disapprove of them.\n\nGypsy Music Styles\n\nThe variety of styles of song in Cante Jondo and Flamenco music is bewildering: to find a parallel, we have to turn to Indian music, in which the Hindus associate music with every season of the year.\n\nMusic was divided into Rāgs which were special melodies, and the word rāg according to Fox-Strangeways meant “color or emotion,” and it was customary to illustrate it by a Rāgmāla or picture of the subject of the music.5\n\nFlamenco\n\nNow that we have considered the words Cante Jondo, let us explain the word Flamenco, which expresses an essential element of Andalusia. Some used to say that the word meant “Flemish” and was applied originally to the band of Flemish courtiers who accompanied the Emperor Charles V when he came to Spain. The word was used in a scornful sense of the nomad bands of Gypsies, who had come from Germany, and the people called these Oriental wanderers Germans and Flemings. Rodriguez Marín says that the word was applied to the Gypsies because by their physical appearance (slender legs and prominent buttocks) and bright-colored garments they resembled the flamingo. A third interpretation derives the word from a compound Arabic word, fallah-mengu, which signifies “peasant in flight,” and the word was applied to the Gypsies, because the people believed that they were descended from the expelled Moors. A recent interpretation by the Arabist Patrocinio Barriuso derives Flamenco from two Arabic words, fellah and mangu. Fellah means “husbandman” and mangu means “to sing.” Flamenco thus would mean the singing of the country people, that is to say folksong.6\n\nFlamenco then came to be used of the music played and sung by those who imitate Gypsy manners, and the word began to cause a furor in Spain in the days of 1876 when the first production of the opera Carmen with Bizet's tawny, sensuous music made Gypsified fashion the rage. Any piece of music vaguely resembling Cante Jondo or possessing a touch of Gypsy about it was called Flamenco, and the word today is applied to anything that is bright or vivacious.7\n\nWhen considering the Gypsy element in Andalusian music we must remember that the Gypsy does not create—he perpetuates. The Gypsy arrived in South Spain as a foreign wanderer and he absorbed the music of the Andalusian and sang, played, or danced it, adding his own peculiarities and idiosyncrasies. The difference between the singing of the Gypsy and the genuine Andalusian is that the Gypsy does not let the note prolong itself, but interrupts and amputates it. The Andalusians describing this peculiarity say, “Los Gitanos muerden el cante” (“The Gypsies bite the song”). The words as sung by the Gitano trip over one another and accentuate the fierce individualism of the Romanichal.\n\nThe Jewish Influence\n\nThe influence of the Jews must be added to that of the Arabs, for there is an exact parallel between the two philosophers who symbolize the two Oriental cultures—Averroës the Moor and Maimonides the Jew.\n\nThe Sephardic Jews considered as “Deep Song” those melodies which they could sing in their synagogue without fear of the Inquisition. According to Medina Azara the songs were sung on Jewish feast days, and the word for feast day in Hebrew is Jom Tob (good day), and this popular pronunciation became Jondo.8 Thus what today is called Cante Jondo was in Jewish language “Festival Song,” and the people who sang it were believed to be the cantors or singers in the synagogue.\n\nSome Spanish musicologists, such as my friend García Matos, deny the influence of the Sephardic or Spanish Jews on the music of Cante Jondo and Flamenco, but I myself have had many opportunities of hearing the Jews sing their traditional Spanish songs in such places as Rhodes, Salonica, and Constantinople, and I was struck by the similarity these songs have to Flamenco music.\n\nIn a comparison of the Gypsy singing of South Spain with Moslem and Jewish singing in the East of Europe, it is important to note the strange ritualistic cry ay-ay repeated again and again against the frenzied accompaniment on the guitar. It produces on me the effect of a keener's wail. When I was in Yugoslavia among Gypsies I heard some of those from the Moslem region near Mostar and Sarajevo sing primitive songs accompanied by the one-stringed gusla wherein the singer cried out oy-oy repeatedly before beginning the song. Then he concluded the song with the same cry of oy-oy.9\n\nGypsy Dancing\n\nMany of the Gypsy singers in South Spain are also dancers, for singing leads to dancing in the juerga or spree. Just as in the case of the Hungarian, the Rumanian, or the Russian Gypsy performer, in Spain the members of the Cuadro Flamenco sing one song after another full of melancholy. The Martinetes and the Siguiriyas are full of descriptions of gaols, crimes passionels, and vendettas. After singing such songs, the dancer parodies the melancholy of the singer.\n\nThe characteristic Baile Gitano which one may see in the caves at Granada, the home of the Gypsy dance, is a tragicomedy. At one moment it is comic and at another tragic; at times it is classical in its grace, and at another it is grotesque. It is more intense and wilder than the ordinary Andalusian dance. One may see the Gypsy dancers in all their “abandon” at the “wakes” and baptismal and marriage feasts which the Romanichals hold in the caves. The dancing of the Spanish Gypsies always reminds me of the Gypsy dancing I have seen in the East of Europe.\n\nIn this alternation of the tragic and the comic, as in the Oriental dances, great importance is given to graceful movements of hands and arms. The whole performance develops according to a ritual—a combination of playing, singing, and dancing in which the audience take part. The cries of ole from the audience animate the performer to produce rapid undulations of his body and stimulate him to give himself entirely up to the spirit of the rhythmic orgy. Watch the Gypsy girl: she in her turn is possessed by the demon—the duende, who, as the Gypsies say, has entered her body through the soles of her feet. She is like one in a trance, and her golden skin has faded a shade paler. The rhythm of hand-clapping (palmas sordas) and of finger-cracking (pitos) has hypnotized her into magic movement: her nostrils are dilated. She is a writhing column of fire, a marble Aphrodite suddenly springing to life. The audience shouts ole and Faraona, for to them she is Pharaoh's daughter.\n\nThe Gypsy Guitar\n\nMeanwhile the Gypsy guitar player has his ear cocked, ready to catch the slightest “nuance” of the singer, and with his eyes half closed in his masklike face he is a sculptural figure. His sonanta (as the Gypsy calls the guitar) seems to shadow the voice of the cantaor, underlying with its mellow chords the harsh Gypsy tone, and embellishing the pauses with rapid interjections played punteado. He produces melody and harmony on his instrument: at one moment he makes it sound like an organ in a distant church, at another he caresses the instrument lazily and languidly suggests the Zambra in the garden of a Moorish harem; then with rhythmic tapping he leads into a harsher tribal music, following in the wake of the fairy trail laid by the Gypsy singer who is now “biting the song,” as the Calés say in Triana, in a male voice full of rugged fierceness (una voz machuna de temple brusco). And while the singer forces the notes higher and higher toward the climax, his partner, with his guitar, produces a metallic tone similar to that of the singer, and when the latter's voice falters or his inspiration begins to flag, the guitarist broadens out into a bewildering series of falsetas or variations; for his function is like that of the czimblaon player in Hungary who, according to Liszt, supplies the rhythm, indicates the acceleration or slackening of time. So close is the relationship between the singer of Andalusian music and the guitarist that the guitar has been called the “conscience of Andalusia.” It is the guitarist who creates the atmosphere for the singer and the background which enables him to find scope for inspiration. He can produce both melody and harmony from his instrument and, even if he is a poor Gypsy guitarist in a tavern, he has his own rhapsodic style which he plays according to tradition.10\n\nThe Zambras in the Caves\n\nThe Gypsy Zambra in the caves at Granada has an ancient history, for it goes back to the days at the end of the fifteenth century when Ferdinand and Isabel captured the Alhambra. During the Eucharistic procession that was held on Corpus Christi after 1492, it was customary for the Moorish population of the city to dance their Zambras in the streets in honor of the feast. Then Gypsy dances, and dances from other provinces of Spain, were performed after the religious procession. These dances became very elaborate in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\nIn the eighteenth century Charles III, after prohibiting in 1765 the Autos Sacramentales, or religious allegorical plays that were performed on Corpus Christi, also vetoed the dances in the processions on that day. Nevertheless it was the same King Charles III who in 1763 had introduced a new law whereby the Gypsies became “New Castilians” and settled down in the cities and town, adopting the habits of sedentary people. And as they were famed throughout Andalusia for their skill in dancing, they contributed to the creation in the eighteenth century of what is known in the world as Spanish musical style. It was in the second half of the eighteenth century when the popular spirit with its racial traditions, which Spaniards sum up in the significant word casticismo (genuine or true to caste), became consecrated in the short musical play-type known as the tonadilla.\n\nThe tonadillas (miniature operettas that took twenty minutes to perform) with their street cries, folksongs, and tavern Gypsy dances, were the musical counterpart of the sparkling one-act sainetes of Ramón de la Cruz which portrayed the Madrid of Goya.\n\nThe Gypsies now began to dance in the taverns of the cities and in the courtyards of palaces the Fandango, Manguindoy, and other old Spanish dances which had been imported into Cádiz from Havana and Cartagena de las Indias. In those later years of the eighteenth century, too, the bullfight was emerging into its present position as the national spectacle of the country with its hosts of aficionados drawn from the humble as well as from the wealthier classes. In 1796 there appeared The Art of Bullfighting by the celebrated matador Pepe Hillo, who, according to the poets, used his sword as pen and dipped it in the bull's blood rather than in ink to write his treatise. Pedro Romero, Pepe Hillo, Costillares, and their followers became, like the ten rulers of Plato's Atlantis, the creators of a caste devoted to the cult of the sacred bulls.\n\nAnd this caste system with its innumerable ramifications, which is summed up by the significant word castizo, included the Gypsies, who brought to the art of bullfighting qualities analogous to those they displayed in singing, guitar playing, and dancing. With their lithe elegance, their swiftness, their intuitive knowledge of animals, and their courageous skill in an emergency, they soon became past masters in this national art, as well as in all the arts that are included in the word Flamenco, which has puzzled scholars and folklorists for the past hundred and fifty years.\n\nIt is significant that the Gypsies have preserved customs and art forms which the Andalusians themselves had forgotten. Many of the ancient dances did not disappear but were preserved under other names, and the Gypsy was instrumental in maintaining the castizo or genuine tradition.\n\nTake as an example the Bolero, which was not an old dance, for it only goes back to the middle of the eighteenth century, the period of the tonadilla. The Bolero, however, is a variant of the ancient Seguidillas, and its invention was attributed by some authorities to a man of noble stock from La Mancha, the home of Seguidillas, Sebastian Cerezo, and by others to a Sevillian coachman, Antón Boliche. What the inventor did was to adapt to the rhythm of the Bolero many of the attractive elements from the old Fandango, Bolo, and Tirana. It was even said that in the Bolero could be found traces of the Chacona of Lope de Vega's day.\n\nOur main authority on all folklore and dances in those formative years of the early nineteenth century is Serafín Estébanez Calderón (El Solitario), whose Escenas Andaluzas is a mine of information. Much of the information acquired by Prosper Mérimée for his works on Spain was derived from Estébanez Calderón, who was a patient and long-suffering guide, philosopher, and friend of the author of Carmen.\n\nEl Solitario tells us that even the Zarabanda, against which the church had so fiercely fulminated in the seventeenth century, was still sung and danced by Gypsies in South Spain under the name Ole and Tirana. The Canto Andaluz, he says, begins with the prolonged Jípios and Ayes, which rise and fall in unending sequence, but the singer “goes deep down.” which is an exact translation of the term Cante Jondo. As the singer, he says, utters his ay, he moves his head and turns up his eyes, as if he were following mentally not the measures of the music but the undulating line of his cry. This undulating movement contrasts with the Aragonese, who in his Jota takes up a fixed attitude in front of his woman partner, for in the Jota we hear the clash of arms, and we see, as the poet Salvador de Rueda said, “the plumes and panoplies of war.” Estébanez Calderón stresses the dignity of the Andalusian Gypsy dances, which show off the performer and seem to say to us, “I am strong, I am agile and I have charm.”\n\nThe Influence of America on Andalusian Music\n\nEstébanez Calderón is most insistent that originally there was no sensuality or suggestiveness in the Baile Flamenco, and the genuine Gypsy performed the dances as though they were part of an ancient religious rite. But the Andalusian dance changed in America, and the national tendencies were exaggerated in the exciting milieu of Cartagena de las Indias or in Cuba, when the Spaniards came into contact with the exotic dances of the colored peoples. Then when the Spanish dancers returned to Andalusia, their dancing reflected the American influence by a double exaggeration, stressing on the one hand the languid passiveness of the individual dancer in an exciting milieu, and, on the other, intensifying what was originally only a slight tendency to eroticism in the Andalusian dance.\n\nWhen we read Estébanez Calderón's warnings against the American corruption which crept into Flamenco dancers in 1838, can we wonder if today, over a hundred years later, it is difficult for an aficionado to discover a Gitana who will perform for him the genuine Baile Jondo (Deep Dance) that corresponds in dancing to Cante Jondo (Deep Song)?\n\nThe Deep Dance springs from that primitive but exclusive refinement which we find in ancient races like the Andalusians and the Indian Romany. It is individual and it corresponds to the subconscious desire of the Gitana to create for herself a new world of sensations. It shows the passionate violence of desert dwellers, the desolate mysticism of the Jew, the sensuousness of the Arab, and finally the pantheistic religion of the Gypsy.\n\nThe Gitana who has been in contact with the American populations for generations loses her ascetic qualities and becomes languid and self-indulgent, and in order to cast her spell over audiences that respond more easily to the direct primitiveness of the Negro dancing, she is forced to exaggerate and even deform the dances that were her patrimony as Faraona, Pharaoh's daughter.\n\nIn Spain the singer of Cante Jondo and the dancer perform for an ecstatic audience of aficionados, people who understand the real thing. These are bitter critics and refuse to accept what is not pure and genuine in style. They disapprove of performances given to large audiences in great cities and they prefer to retire to some tavern on the banks of the Guadalquivir with its wooden partitions where they may share a bottle of Manzanilla with the artists.\n\nAfter a long interval of expectancy, which sometimes may last for hours, the singer, the guitarists, and the dancer discover the duende that will enable them to give free rein to their inspiration and express the rare essence that still survives in the pure art form called Cante Jondo.\n\nAs Manuel Maschado, the king of aficionados, said of Andalusia:\n\nCádiz salada claridad; Granada\n\nagua oculta que llora;\n\nRomana y mora, Córdoba callada:\n\nMálaga cantaora;\n\nAlmería dorada:\n\nPlateado Jaén: Huelva,\n\nLa orilla de las tres carabelas."
