        "text": "Indialucía – a solid study of the musical structures of these two great musical worlds. It is a rigorous and beautiful work, that makes us travel, which transports us and trills us.\n\nMonica Rubio, B!ritmos, March 2008\n\nMiguel Czachowski a Polish flamenco guitarist is a brilliant musician with a fascinating and artful ability to fuse and find the perfect balance of rhythm and mood between the world of classical Indian music and contemporary flamenco.\n\nTimes of Oman, February 2008\n\nVery outstanding among so many fusions albums of the present times. This project, exacting, perfectly balanced and fascinating as it is, represents a resounding achievement. Nine tracks, brimming with rhythm and charm, the amazing work full of flamenco compases, which adds a splendid Indian raga to shape a whole spells, rhythmic mind-as it should be so alive the memory of origin Eastern forms of flamenco. All participating musicians reach excellent levels, although it is obliged to stress at percussionist Pierluca Pineroli (real torpedo of cajon), the flute of Domingo Patricio and the singer’s incredible voice of Indian Prasad Khaparde. Excellent group and excellent album.\n\nAntonio Valentin, Alma100, November 2006\n\nThe combination of perfect flamenco guitar flourishes and precise tabla beats produces a sound that is abundant with festive celebration and an example of human accomplishment. Every recorded note and beat on this album is a portal to some source bigger than ourselves. The idea of cultures meshing without losing their identity, while still acknowledging their distinctive faiths, is perhaps the only glimpse of an answer to today’s hostile problems around the world.\n\nThis is a must for all poets, artists, musicians and dreamers. Listen to this record, close your eyes, and dance to the possibility of a new future filled with unconditional love, harmony and fun.\n\nMichael R. Mollura, LaYoga, May 2007\n\nThe musical concept of India and Flamenco shared musical ancestry is a significant breakthrough in World Music.\n\nMark Thomas, World Beat Radio, May 2007\n\nAn impressive fusion of flamenco guitar with traditional Indian instruments. An amalgam of vocal and percussive sounds that cause a happy outcome, while ecstasy ritual, as if a religious ceremony or a big Gypsy fiesta. The album is full of melodies that manage to enchant the listener like a snake following the spell of his owner. It is a great disc.\n\nCuerdas y Cajas, 30 April 2007\n\nIndialucia stakes their cross-cultural claim from the first notes of their self-titled album, with the percussive stains of flamenco guitar joined by Indian percussion vocals. (…)Indialucia brings to this cultural conversation a fluid virtuosity and energy to spare, and I’ll be returning to this album again and again.\n\nScott Allan Stevens, Spin the Globe, April 2007\n\nThis album will open the minds of lovers of both flamenco and Indian music with its fascinating and artful ability to fuse both sounds.\n\nSpectre Music, March 2007\n\nIndialucia is a masterful fusion of Indian and Flamenco styles. Zesty rhythms and intricate melodies dance around one another to create a totally unique sound that is embodied in the energy and skill of these brilliant musicians.\n\nRasa Music, February 2007\n\nA fusion of forces brought about a unique musical evening in Aquarium. The concert “Indialucia” attracted many spectators. The last ones did not manage to get any seats.\n\n“Indialucia” was a real discovery. We cannot deny the fact that the temperament of the Spanish music combined with an irregular Indian time gave astonishing effects.\n\nWhat captivated me the most during this Friday night in Aquarium, apart from the music itself, was the atmosphere of the concert. Full relaxation and spontaneity. The invited musicians proved that a serious and revealing musical project which “Indialucia” undoubtedly is, does not have to be played and offered in an envelope of buffoon seriousness. It is just as well to have fun playing this music, as we experienced it during the concert, and the music is not deprived of its beauty and ingenuity.\n\nBespress, July 2006\n\nAn international ensemble “tamed” by Miguel does wonders on the album. Whoever likes McLaughlin and his orchestra or Al Di Meola will feel at home in this world.\n\nSuperbly balancing between the Eastern spirituality, breath, relax, and the Western passionate playing, Michał offers a flamenco of the 21st century. This album will surely be noticed in the world and it will be difficult for next authors laying the routes of the new art not to refer to it. I admire Michał that although he lives in Poland now, far from any cultural centre, he was able to join into an intercultural dialogue, and in such a meaningful way.\n\nWojciech Ossowski, Polish Radio, Program 3, June 2005\n\nMiguel Czachowski, an acclaimed guitarist, lover of Indian music and flamenco made his vision come true of merging these distant cultures during his music trips to India and Spain. This recording registered in the “Indialucia” album evokes the finest memories of the cult “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”, and perhaps even something more than of the memorable Shakti jam songs.\n\nPolish Radio pr I, June 2006\n\nIt has been written much about the Indian roots of the gypsy and flamenco culture. Not very often this fascinating history has been counted, explained and demonstrated of a so convincing and beautiful form as in ́Indialucía ́.\n\nGalileo Music, June 2006\n\nA fusion combining the roots of flamenco with the Indian music. An album which could not be more beautiful, Indialucia. This masterly cooperation, together with rhythm, melody and singing, gave birth to a ritual music, charged with the flamenco energy, as well as that of a Spanish fiesta. As if those two styles have never existed separately. (…) Indialucia is an exceptionally superb album. This fusion, full of energy and soothing at the same time, probably could not be better.\n\nVoice of Culture, June 2006\n\nA lot has been written about Indian roots in the Gypsy music and flamenco. Never before has this fascinating story been told, explained and presented in such a convincing and beautiful way as on Indialucia.\n\nGalileo Music, June 2006\n\nToday, flamenco continues to thrive and evolve, with young stars such as Estrella Morente and Diego el Cigala and veterans such as Enrique Morente and Paco de Lucia winning international accolades, while experimental fusion outfits such as Ojos de Brujo and Indialucia push the music’s limits.\n\nTom Pryor – National Geographic, May 2006\n\nWhilst listening to this album, it is very clear it compliments the diverse cultures of flamenco and Indian music, by its use of genuine ethnical instruments. It is a perfect balance of rhythm and mood. The music lifts you, it is a mixture of emotions – ranging from serious and deep to joyful and intense. Czachowski made an intense footprint not only in world of guitar but also in world ethnical music. His album inspires the listener, reveals the unknown, a new world of mysterious, exotic music.\n\nTop Guitar, May 2006\n\nRelease of such an album is an unusual event not only on the Polish folk music scene, but it also constitutes an interesting contribution to the genre which could be named “the world’s music”. A combination of Indian music with the flamenco sound is a Blakean marriage of hell and heaven. Calm, sometimes almost majestic sounds of the East unite with the temperament and fire of hot Spain. And yet these are not the only inspirations present on the album. A composition which renders the spirit of the project “Indialucia” in a perfect way is the title suite which provides listeners with a possibility to encounter such different and yet harmonizing sounds. Miguel Czachowski is well acquainted with his musical domains. It is puzzling that such a project was prepared in Poland. The fact that this album was realized in such a precise way, in cooperation with musicians from Spain, India and Poland, is even more astonishing. I think that this album can become a good showcase of the Polish folk scene abroad. The whole world plays in a multicultural fashion nowadays, and this project has a chance to come into existence in broader awareness.\n\nGadki z Chatki, May 2006\n\nFrom the first notes heard it was clearly apparent that this piece of work is unique. Fusion of flamenco, Indian music assisted with the beauty of jazz, initially whilst it may sound confusing, the structure and definition of this style become clear and concise over the time. “Indialucia” is a well thought-out album, taking the listener on a truly musical, historical and mystical trip. Special recognition goes to Miguel Czachowski for his pioneering idea, his thought over fusion of styles, and finally for engaging genuine ethnical musicians.\n\nGaz-Eta, April 2006\n\nThe performance of the Indialucia project constitutes a wonderful spectacle from the cycle of “Community of Roots”. Selecting two types of music coming from the edges of the Indo-Europe, Miguel Czachowski and the musicians belonging to the ensemble reminded us of a simple fact from the field of ethnology that flamenco is a music of Andalusian Gypsies, and this nation came to Europe from India; therefore comments indicating sacrilege upon one or the other type of music which were starting points for the artists only prove the ignorance of people who make them. Miguel Czachowski’s guitar and Avaneendra Sheolikar’s sitar were interlacing in such a fluent way that they formed a coherent unity. I don’t think I am able to express the way our guest from India played the sitar. Melodies from almost meditative to nearly mad ones, but always climatic charges and solos. A truly magical performance.\n\nMatt Seroka – Heavy Motyl, April 2006\n\n“Indialucia” is a truly unusual album. A fusion of flamenco with Indian inspirations is a unique clash. It is not confined solely to the level of a gadget, an empty gesture. It is a coherent, closed concept, where the intellect keeps up with the spirit, and the technical skills do not deprive the artists of their imagination and humility. Thanks to that we get a masterpiece of unique beauty, which constitutes a search for threads connecting flamenco and the music of India. In exploring the Hindu tradition and rewriting it into “his own” sounds, Czachowski is equal in terms of ingenuity and quality to the members of the legendary Kronos Quartet.\n\nGadki z Chatki, March 2006\n\n(…) It has been a long time since I last encountered such an exhaustive and yet accessible discussion of a cultural background and a factual analysis of particular pieces. Big applause for the author and spiritus movens of the whole venture – Michał Czachowski. And the music itself? It is just an explosive mixture. Most of all because of the richness of exotic rhythms that European musicians have never even dreamed of, focusing upon the perfection of harmony. The rhythm is not only a causative factor and a structure upon which the pieces are based. Sometimes it is the only component of the composition, as in the inspiring “Taliquete” for a voice and percussion instruments. The stylistic scatter is immense: we have easy compositions, pleasant in reception, such as “Mohabbat Ka Khazana”, breathtaking vocal sections and trance rhythms, as well as an elaborate raga, requiring concentration from listeners. The skills of the instrumentalists evoke the greatest admiration, particularly when we realize that what we deal with here to a large degree is an improvised music. The only stylistic element that might be doubtful is adding a string quartet in “Nagpur”. Apart from that – a revelation.\n\nBartosz Lubioń – HiFi i Muzyka, February\n\nAnd another successful mixture of different cultures. “Indialucia” is extremely succeeded combination of Andalusian and Indian Music. No miracle, the author comes from Poland, and finally it is in a half way. Miguel Czachowski was born in 1974 into a family of Polish flamenco lovers and dedicated himself into the 90-ties fully and completely to the flamenco guitar. Even he studied some time the sitar in India. The result is the CD was recorded in India and Spain between 1999 and 2004. Ragas and bulerias alternate, flamenco palos with Indian singing and sitar, all supported by tabla. Beautifully arranged CD with a fascinating fusion.\n\nAnda, February 2006\n\nThe album “Indialucia” flows upon the wave of fascination, a bit strengthened with Bollywood, and an always strong interest in the Latin American music. This Hindu – Spanish ethno is somewhat heading towards pop, but thanks to the Hindu and Spanish musicians invited to participate in the recording, as well as to very skilled Czachowski, we do not have a feeling of communing with some kind of a musical ersatz. It is great to listen, if you wish you could even dance to it. I strongly recommend it!\n\nMirosław Pęczak, Polityka, February 2006\n\nGuitarist Miguel Czachowski and Avaneedra Sheolikar on sitar, both of them proven soloists, were the driving forces behind the project. The complex metrics and the pending notes of Indian music melt really nicely with the vivacious quick tempered Flamenco, and in between there is even room for an enthusiastically swinging piano. The tempo and moods along the way are ranging from passionate rhythm to lyrical dreams. A musical east-west-meeting far from the classical strictness (and the shyness) of Ravi Shankar’s and Yehudi Menuhin’s early experiments and just as far from today’s shallow pop Bollywood film music. Indialucia is a lot of fun on the highest level.\n\nGlobal Mojo, January 2006\n\nThe album Indialucia was a totally astonishing surprise for me. Whereas the flamenco productions in Spain move around in the same point with no exit, transforming this art according to predictable formulae, the ingenuity of this project was like a blast of sound freshness for my ears which were permeated with already exhausted ideas of project realized so far.\n\nNorberto Torres Cortes – El Olivo, January 2006\n\nCzachowski managed to combine the Andalucian and Indian music in an extremely accurate manner, everything is intertwined here in a very natural way.\n\nJohn Hoyer Nielsen – Radio Danske, 22 January 2006\n\nThis fascinating project explores the not-so-distant relationship between North Indian classical music and Spain’s flamenco tradition. Flamenco, of course, has long been associated with Spain’s sizeable gitano, or gypsy, population, and all European gypsies (or roma, as they prefer to be called) share a common North Indian origin. And although the roma left the subcontinent sometime in the 9th century, their insularity allowed them to maintain many cultural traits and traditions intact. One of the most famous roma traditions has been their music making, and flamenco’s classic compas, or 12 beat cycles, can trace their origins all the way back to India. Of course the music diverged over the centuries, but the common roots remained, ready to be unearthed and grafted together in a project like IndiaLucia. Recorded between 1999 and 2004, in both India and Spain, the album brings together master musicians from both traditions, including guitarist Miguel Czachowski, sitarist Avaneendra Sheolikar, tabla player Sandesh Popatkar and cajón player Pierluca Pineroli. The result is a masterful blend of kinetic percussion, stately raag-like drone punctuated by fiery flamenco fretwork and soaring vocal improvisations.\n\nGlobal Rhythm, December 2005\n\n“…Spanish, familiar rhythms harmonize with the Indian music and the accompaniment of traditional Indian instruments, as if those two worlds have never been separated and have not had five centuries of separation behind them.”\n\nJolanta Pierończyk – Tyski Magazyn Kulturalny, December 2005\n\nThe culmination of a five year collaboration and exploration of common ground and possible common roots between Flamenco and Indian music, this recording represents easily the most successful fusion of the two musical cultures to date. The main instruments are Flamenco guitar and sitar, tabla and cajon. Both the rhythmically driving and the slower more mournful pieces sound “native” to both musical cultures, and underscore the tremendous affinities that exist between the two.\n\nFlamenco Connection, November 2005\n\nConfronting the Spanish flamenco with Indian ragas under the Polish wire. Stunt performer? Only seemingly. The flamenco was created by Andalusian Gypsies, strangers from India. In spite of all differences it is easy to hear what they have in common: freedom in shaping the musical form, expression of emotions, strong spiritual element. And since Polish mentality great understands such an approach for the art, Miguel Czachowski, our best flamenco guitarist and at the same time the expert of the Indian music, with the big tact played the part of the moderator and the leader. The fact that Spaniards, Poles and Indians sound together as if they have always played together, is his merit mainly.\n\nOzon – October 2005\n\nThe Indialucia album is the work and the idea daring enough in it`s making. Czachowski is flamenco guitar master (…). From this fascination for the traditional Indian music and from connecting it with world of flamenco rose an unusually impetuous and stunning record not only in the musical but also cultural and purely cognitive sense. Additionally album goes with the booklet with very interesting historical intro.\n\nLampa – October 2005\n\nPolish albums, with which it is possible to boast worldwide are a rare occurrences. Indialucia is one of them. It is bringing the sophisticated portion of intercrossing music linking the flamenco and the Indian music. The idea for this is only seemingly risky. After all gypsies which in the cultural melting pot of ancient Spain contributed to the flamenco were descendants of people arrived to Europe from north- western India. This historical fact was an inspiration for the quite modern plan of the guitarist of Miguel Czachowski. Bound for years with the flamenco music Czachowski is recognized as the best Polish guitarist of this stylistics and during the stay in India he learnt also how to play sitar.\n\nIn 1999 – 2004 between India and Spain, with the participation of local musicians he recorded the album Indialucia. A basic line-up of the group is a quintet, where Indian vocals, tabla and sitar meet with Spanish percussion instruments and the flamenco guitar. In the booklet added to the record we can find commentaries on each track describing the encounter of cultures present in them. About the shape of the whole work decides fact, that both in the flamenco as well as the Indian music, a rhythm is an most essential and base element. Power of this record is stemming from the way how Czachowski led its band.\n\nHe managed to pass all shoals which can spoil the projects being a multicultural fusion. Music from Indialucia is equally far form the stiff conceptualism, as well as from the plastic flirtatiousness. The average of the age of the team is taking out about 30., musicians have the certain back of traditional techniques but also the easiness of taking advantage of them in new contexts. Here a freshness and an energy of the meeting, a joy of playing and interchanges of the inspiration are heard. From here the music is light and at the same time he is wasting nothing from his roots aspects.\n\nFrom jazz stylization, where guitar and tabla are playing the rhythm of the rumba through qawwali songs and raga, until the oldest forms flamenco – zambra and martinete – Czachowski`s group is playing with the charm and the verve. Colorful, clean and volatile spaces of acoustic sounds are balancing hypnotic nerve of rhythms. All this constitutes a music which even for listeners indifferent to ethnic tastes Indialucia will sound rousingly.\n\nArte – October 2005\n\nThe guitarist not only has a big ability of expressing himself in this style, but also outstanding knowledge about flamenco and about the details of the Indian music. Stalking the history of wandering gypsies which formerly set off from India and after reaching Spain became co-creators of flamenco culture, Czachowski looks (talking in certain simplification) for links between this style and the Indian raga.\n\nFor seeking the common roots the guitarist invited Indian performers (percussion, sitar, tabla, singing) and people from Spain and Poland playing on most diverse instruments. On the record we find compositions (“Raag’n’Ole”, “Kyabathe”), which impressively integrate both elements. There are also such pieces when one of forms clearly is dominating (“Herencia Hindu”, “Gujari Todi”). The most interesting piece of the album is “Indialucia” – in the introduction to it Czachowski sketched the entire “orientalism” of flamenco style.\n\nAfterwards some Indian instruments were added and it was as if we were blown towards the India. Such feelings of transcontinental flying are many on this record, what makes is indisputable virtue. It is uncanny that the Pole just during a few recording sessions managed to combine two, in our times separate styles, coming from the same root. One should wish the album the popularity, because its contents should be equally fascinating for not very orthodox north Indians and Andalusian Spaniards.\n\nAudio, September 2005\n\nFor meeting the flamenco and the Indian music we needed the Pole – Michał Czachowski. This excellent Polish performer of the flamenco guitar made this record on two continents and called it “Indialucia”. What the Indian ragas share from the flamenco? Tradition of Spanish gypsies which ages ago arrived from the Indian subcontinent. The completely new quality is born bringing associations with the first revolutionary musical meeting of European and Asian artists from years 60. Beautiful album.\n\nElle, September 2005\n\n(…) Indialucia is surely a special creation, unusual meeting with the Music of World.\n\nRadio Multikulti – Berlin August 2005\n\nIndialucia, the album released by CM Records, blends flamenco and Indian music at the highest level. It shows beautifully the combination of the musical attributes and the elements from both cultures. (…) The great artists have been exploring the root of the relation between flamenco and Indian music.\n\nSeongmyun Cho – Melon, August 2005\n\nAfter the first ten minutes of listening there was no doubts that it was one of best records of the “fusion music” which I had in my hands and there are several hundred pieces at my discotheque. (…) When almost thirty years ago I was a first – how I think – person who introduced the Polish reader the mystery of Indian music, I could not even dream of the fact that in Poland will appear a musician who will demonstrate such deep theoretical and practical knowledge. (…) In Czachowski’s music we have got the true fusion of the two, of equally treated idiom, the same as between the jazz and the Indian music made the Shakti group. It feel clearly that Czachowski not only has a deep knowledge of what he is playing but also he loves to do it and it is highly energizing and comforting music. I know that I will often go back to this album."
