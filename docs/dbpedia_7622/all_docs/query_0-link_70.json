        "text": "Trípticos is a numbered series of programs comprising short to medium-length choreographies lacking an apparent thread. Dancers support each other with voice, light, bodies, presence, and small instruments.\n\nTríptico #2 includes the choreographies “METER LOS PIES,” “NONDEDÉU,” and “SILENCIOS” … a kind of experimental and synesthetic trinity about footwork, singing, flamenco dance, dance, and silence.\n\n“METER LOS PIES”: Dancers who present themselves as rhythm machines, sequencers of polyrhythms to transmit and transmute the legacy of those historical dancers who were patriarchs, apostles and prophets of zapateado and their disciples, prodigious zapateadoras and brave women, undisputed queens of flamenco dance.\n\nFollowing the ancient concept of dance to the guitar, we will transcribe to zapateado historical flamenco scores, music and touches that will intertwine to create a random and surprising polyrhythm that in turn will be the structure, the accent, the texture and the order.\n\nA rhythmic support provided by the zapateado itself, but that we will also look for in the experiences, testimonies and concepts of our ancestors and ourselves and that we will find along a journey that will lead us to break the straight line that produces the metronome to perform the exact measurement of the pulse. A journey that incites us to look for textures and sounds with bare feet so that others dance on a tectonic fault feeling the vibration of an earthquake, to sing the zapateado with the onomatopoeic language that only dancers understand or to place ourselves vertical and static in a bullring, where the ferocity of the charging bull and the courage of the man who faces him intertwine in a two-step of life and death, a superposition of rhythmic metrics that represents the struggle of modern man and machine, of improvisation and premeditation and that will make us dance and stomp inspired by the sound of the machines of a printing press, the noise of the railroad, of electric motors of different intensity, of a printer, of metronomes or the machinery of the ICU of a hospital.\n\nTo arrive at the fall or the tropezón [typical step of the zapateado], to zapateado kneeling like a penitent or looking at the sky. Soft zapateado, energetic zapateado; like a wild person, like in the Nijinskyan ritual of spring, like an American tap dancer, a jarocho, or a possessed person… like a flamenco.\n\nWhat does flamenco singing evoke in the human body? Is dance the bodily expression prompted by the singer’s effort while singing?\n\nThese two questions are the starting point for the investigation of “NONDEDÉU”, a contemporary flamenco dance piece that sometimes serves as a dialogue between flamenco dance and regular dance, flamenco singing, the bodily expression of singers, a danced response or replica to the statements and testimonies of an ancestral singer… It is Alberto Sellés, a dancer/singer/choreographer with whom we explore this path that diverges in the flamenco contexts of Alberto himself and his great-great-granduncle Aurelio Sellés Nondedéu [1887-1974], a legendary master of flamenco singing.\n\nFrom the singer, we draw inspiration and documentary from some unpublished recordings over which Alberto Sellés dances and sings, thus converging with his ancestor in an encounter, dialogue, and celebration of the union of tradition and avant-garde, of the orthodox and the experimental, of singing and dancing, of dance and non-dance, of bodily expression and expression of the soul, extraversion and intimacy, yes and no, temperament, vibration, past, and present.\n\n“SILENCIOS” takes as one of its starting points a text from the book A year from monday by John Cage. It will be the first time, since we began our creative work and artistic journey as a tandem in 2003, that we find ourselves face to face on a stage, on a street, or in a unique space, without company, without dancers, or musicians; just the two of us facing each other, in our essence, building a conversation from the rawness of silence, complementing each other from our different dance, conceptual, and vital languages ​​that over time have become one and that allows us to naturally place ourselves in each other’s shoes; Estévez in the sharp silence of Paños’s nervous system understanding the short circuits of a body that works to exhaustion if necessary, in search of beauty, definition, and the perfection of infinite, harmonious, sensitive, and stylized movement… Paños in the deep silence of Estévez, that of the paths of the mass of his blood that slows down dense like honey, loaded with ancestors from unimaginable origins and with an intuition and affinity with past times, that by age he has not experienced, but that are the basis of his dance language.\n\nBoth from stillness and from dance, from sound and silence, from the past and the present… from ourselves.\n\n-Rafael Estévez and Valeriano Paños\n\nIn 2001, Rafael Estévez and Valeriano Paños decided to form an artistic duo after discovering that they shared many common points regarding artistic concepts and visions of dance. In the middle of that year, they began an arduous research effort that led them to define the profile that characterizes their duo: a fusion of tradition and avant-garde. From the start of this artistic and creative journey, they explored movement by experimenting with contemporary forms and the unique aspects of Spanish dances and flamenco, thereby creating a distinctive language and concept of dance and choreography.\n\nTogether, they choreographed CÓRDOBA for Lola Greco (2004) and VIEJOS AIRES DE LA VIEJA ESPAÑA, which premiered on European Music Day (2007) in collaboration with the Madrid Municipal Symphonic Band, directed by Enrique García Asensio. Estévez and Paños have choreographed and danced for the Dance Galas at the Teatro Real in Madrid (2004), Spanish Dance Gala at the Tokyo Forum Hall EXPO AICHI (2005), and Dance Gala EXPO Zaragoza (2008), dancing alongside Lola Greco, Mayte Bajo, Gala Vivancos, Kira Gimeno, and María Vivó, and sharing the stage with artists such as Tamara Rojo, José Martínez, Mats Ek, Ana Laguna, Ángel Corella, and Nacho Duato, among others.\n\nThey choreographed and performed several pieces in the show GOYESCA at the Suma Flamenca Festival (2008), dancing with the singing of Carmen Linares and sharing the cast with artists like Miguel Poveda, Israel Galván, Rocío Molina, and Terremoto. They were invited by Carlos Saura to participate in the film FLAMENCO, FLAMENCO (2009), performing “Guajiras” with the singer Arcángel and the dancer Patricia Guerrero.\n\nThey collaborated with experimental musician Artomático, sharing stages with artists like BandaÈria, Jorge Pardo, and José Manuel León, among others (2008-2011). They created DANZA 220v in collaboration with choreographer Antonio Ruz and musician Artomático, with a special collaboration from singer Sandra Carrasco (2010), and the show EL SALÓN DE BAILE for the Joven Compañía NOSOLODANZA (2012). They were invited to collaborate as dancers and choreographers in the show OJO by Antonio Ruz in 2011 and artistically directed RECICLARTE by Ana Morales, also choreographing some pieces in 2013. They artistically directed and choreographed ESPIRAL by David Coria (2014), and collaborated as choreographers in LA CASA DE BERNARDA ALBA by 300 Pistolas Compañía de Teatro de Álvaro Morte and À L’ESPAGNOLE by Compañía Antonio Ruz and Accademia del Piacere (2015).\n\nBetween 2016 and 2022, they participated as guest teachers at the University of New Mexico and the National Institute of Flamenco in Albuquerque, New Mexico, teaching Spanish Dance and Flamenco. They created the choreographies ÇIERTAS DANÇAS (2016), HIERRO(2021), and SUITE No19 (2022) for Yjastros: The American Flamenco Repertory Company.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, they assumed the artistic direction and choreography of the Ballet Flamenco de Andalucía. They created the EL DOLOR for Olga Pericet’s UN CUERPO INFINITO (2019), and participated in the seminar convened by the Flamencology Chair of the University of Seville on Antonio “El Bailarín” titled “Antonio Ruiz Soler: His Legacy”, being part of the round table Antonio’s Dance: Spanish Style, Choreographies, and Great Works. Present and Future, and in 2021, they were invited to the Congress on the centenary of Antonio “El Bailarín” participating in the round table “Antonio, Choreographer” with masters Manolo Marín and José Antonio.\n\nThey received the National Dance Prize (2019) in the creation category, awarded by the Ministry of Culture and Sports of the Government of Spain. They created EP2020 [Choreographic Caprice for Two Dancing Men and Two Video Cameras], which premiered at the online edition of the Flamenco Festival in Albuquerque, New Mexico – USA. In 2021, they created and artistically directed FLAMENCO: ESPACIO CREATIVO for Alfonso Losa. In 2022, they directed and created some choreographies for the show INSACIABLE by Lucía Álvarez “La Piñona”.\n\nESTÉVEZ / PAÑOS AND COMPANY\n\nThe trajectory of Estévez / Paños and Company began in 2003 with the pieces MARTINETE andTRES POR MEDIO, which they performed as guest artists at the 2003 Choreographic Contest of Flamenco and Spanish Dance in Madrid.\n\nIn 2005, the company premiered its first show, TIEMPO (Suite of Spanish Dance). A year later, at the Madrid dance cycle Distrito Danza, they premiered MUÑECAS (Walking Version) and …A PIANO with pianist Edith Peña. In 2007, they revisited MUÑECAS to adapt it to a theatrical format, debuting at the Festival de Jerez to great acclaim. That same year, the Málaga Flamenco Biennial awarded the project FLAMENCO XXI: ÓPERA, CAFÉ Y PURO, a show that received the critics’ Revelation Prize for performance at the Festival de Jerez. In 2008, within the Flamenco Thursdays cycle in Sevilla, they premiered SONATA, with music by Padre Antonio Soler.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2014, Estévez and Paños were part of the show FLAMENCO HOY by Carlos Saura, as principal choreographers and dancers. For this occasion, they included dancers from Estévez / Paños and Company as the cast of this show.\n\nIn 2011, they created PREFLAMENCOS, a show featuring music by Artomático, Rosana Romero as the principal dancer, dancer Jesús Perona, and composer Luis Prado, who arranged “Playera o Caña” (1866) by Manuel Fernández Grajal.
