        "text": "Birding Andalucía\n\nStretching roughly 500 km east-west and 200-300 km north-south Andalucía defines southern Spain. It is divided into eight provinces – running west to east these are Huelva, Sevilla and Cadiz, Málaga and Cordoba, Granada and Jaén and Almería. Andalucía is one the most attractive and ecologically diverse areas around the Mediterranean. It includes extensive saline lagoons and wide rivers, extensive marshes, a coastline bordered by some of Europe’s largest sand dune complexes, rugged cliffs, evergreen forests (inc. endemic pinsapo firs), the world’s largest cork-oak forest, desert-like “badlands”, fertile plains, wild olive trees and mountains in excess of 3,600m which support an isolated alpine flora. This diversity of habitats helps to explain why Andalucía enjoys one of Europe’s richest avifaunas. All of the Iberian specialities can be found in the region: Bald and Glossy Ibis, Flamingos, Spoonbills, White-headed Duck, Marbled Teal, Red-knobbed Coot, both bustards, Black-bellied and Pin-tailed Sandgrouse, Spanish Imperial Eagle, Black-winged Kite, Azure-winged Magpie and Trumpeter Finch and many others… Sadly, the iconic Andalucian Hemipode (Small Button Quail) is now almost certainly extinct in Iberia (although it survives, barely, just across the straits). The mass migration of raptors across the straits in spring (mainly March-May) and autumn (mainly August-November) is one of Europe’s greatest avian spectacles. The movement of small birds across the straits is often overlooked but it too can be impressive.\n\nYou can enjoy a dream birdwatching holiday in Andalucía but remember that summers can be very hot, so it’s best to avoid the midday heat by relaxing with a cool drink and reserve birding for the early mornings or late afternoon and evenings. Fortunately, in winter and early spring (February onwards here!), the weather is often far more congenial with pleasant balmy days enlivened by many birds.\n\nIn the following section we set out a selection of some of the top spots and regions."
