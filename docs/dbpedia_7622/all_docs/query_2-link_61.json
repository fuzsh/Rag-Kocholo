        "text": "Falla referred to this idea in an interview:\n\nHow stimulating to think of the future! For music is just starting out on her way. Harmony is on the threshold. For instance, the folk-songs of my native Andalusia derive from a much subtler scale that can be found in an octave of twelve notes. All I can do in my day is to give an illusion of these quarter-tones by superimposing chords of one key on another. But the day is fast coming when our present notation will have to be abandoned for one able to come with our demands.\n\nDevelopment of Cante Jondo in the Early 20th Century\n\nCante jondo became very popular around the world, inspiring many French and Russian composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel. Interestingly, the style was not appreciated in Spain by the general audience. They preferred the cuplé, a bawdy theater song style, which was popular during that time. Falla worried about the possibility of losing flamenquismo and the purity of the rudimentary singing of Andalusia. This fear was one of the reasons why, after the suggestion of his friend Miguel Cerón, he decided to create the competition for cante jondo. His goal was to promote this art and to ensure that it would not disappear.\n\n1922 Competition\n\nFalla wrote a letter in 1922 asking the government of Granada for institutional support for the cante jondo competition. This letter was signed by some of the most prominent cultural personalities of Spain, including the composer Joaquín Turina and the Nobel Prize laureate Juan Ramón Jiménez. Falla wanted to invite the composers Stravinsky and Ravel to attend to listen to the competition, but he did not get the funding.\n\nFederico García Lorca was one of Falla’s closest friends in Granada and was a major promoter of the competition. On many occasions Lorca praised the sound of the Spanish guitar, the cante jondo, and the Andalusian musical style in his poetry. Falla explained his research on the origin of cante jondo with Lorca, as well as Pedrell’s works and the musical theories by Louis Lucas that Falla associated with this art. Lorca reflected on all these conversations in a conference presentation he gave before the competition. The presentation was a great success and was published in seven parts by El Noticiero Granadin.\n\nLorca made a distinction between cante jondo and cante flamenco:\n\nIt is given the name of cante jondo to a group of Andalusian songs, which their genuine and perfect type is the siguiriya gitana, from which many other songs still are conserved by people, as polos, martinetes, carceleras and soleares. The coplas called malagueñas, granadinas, rondeñas and peteneras, etc., cannot be considered more than a consequence of the previous cited, so their architecture and rhythm are different from the others. These ones are flamencas. […] The main differences between cante jondo with flamenco, are that the origin of the first one we have to look it for in the early musical systems of India, in other words, in the first appearance of singing, while the second one, that is a consequence of the first one, it takes the definitive form in the 18th century."
