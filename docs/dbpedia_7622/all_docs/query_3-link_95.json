        "text": "In cheerful flamenco style, this dance piece is fast-paced, with such energetic guitar music, that even the dancers have a smile on their faces.\n\n— Alegria\n\nA type of Flamenco music. Most of these songs come from traditional rhythmic flamenco music, which later evolved into purely melodic performances.\n\n— Song of Freedom\n\nSome believe it originated in Galicia and developed from traditional Christmas carols.\n\n— Farruca\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, popular songs were mixed with flamenco, giving birth to the style known today as Malaguena.\n\n— Malaguena\n\nIt is one of the oldest forms of flamenco singing, and consists of the singer singing without any accompaniment.\n\n— Tonas\n\nFlamenco is the art of fusing dance, song and guitar. Flamenco is a free and liberating dance, often performed in dozens of styles. Join me in this dance and learn more about the art of Flamenco!\n\n— Voice of Flamenco\n\nCante grande, another main stylistic family of Flamenco, is darker in its sentiment, with themes such as loss, anguish, despair and death.\n\n— Cante Grande\n\nCante intermedio is one of the main stylistic families of Flamenco.\n\n— Cante Intermedio\n\nCante chico is another one of the main stylistic families of Flamenco, played in a relaxed and light-hearted style. Its themes often include happiness and love.\n\n— Cante Chico\n\nThe deep singing style is usually considered to be of Andalusian origin.\n\n— Jondo\n\nThis is a form of Flamenco singing, often in a deep and solemn style.\n\n— Seguiriya\n\nInterestingly, this form of singing does not require guitar accompaniment, only simple percussion sound. The birth of the style may be associated with workers who sang with hammers and anvils as accompaniment.\n\n— Martinete\n\nThe source of this Flamenco rhythm usually comes from clapping, rattles, or wooden box drums.\n\n— Compas\n\nOriginating from southern Andalusia, it is one of the most classic flamenco styles. The strong rhythm and sad lyrics convey the pain and passion of the singers, while the dancers are often solemn and grave.\n\n— Solea\n\nIn the 16th century, the art from Cuba was brought to Spain, where it was fused with Flamenco, giving birth to performance forms like the Guajira.\n\n— Guajira"
