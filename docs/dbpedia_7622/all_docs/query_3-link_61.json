        "text": "The flamenco singer Enrique Morente, now in his early 60's, is a symbol for the widening of the genre. He has helped mount theater projects based on literary works, adapted old and new poetry to traditional song forms, collaborated with a rock band -- he has admitted to wishing he had become a rock singer long ago -- and once presented a flamenco Mass.\n\nBut he is astonishingly good at the ancient, serious voice-and-guitar cante jondo (deep song) style and on Saturday night brought his version of it to a concert with the guitarist Tomatito, part of the weekend flamenco festival at Carnegie Hall. Mr. Morente and Tomatito haven't performed together for nearly 10 years, and their three duets -- the heart of the concert -- were exceptional displays of mutual response.\n\nSmall and stocky, Mr. Morente leaned forward in a chair behind a microphone and sang in long breaths that ran through several precise notes before coming down to the tonic again. When he reached the end of a marathon phrase, he would lower his head; he noiselessly clapped out the accents within the 12-count rhythms of each song, one a slow soleá, one a livelier alegría, one a fascinatingly static siguiriya tightened by the repetition of a single chord.\n\nBut Mr. Morente made it personal. He also bent notes into long, precipitous arcs, covering intervals as wide as a sixth; he seemed to abstract himself from the rhythm, stubbornly repeating a word or phrase as if struggling to understand their implications; he sang from the chest and produced foggy tones, giving a warp and mystery to his pitch. This gave Tomatito, the accompanist and subordinate, more possible directions, as he rocketed off small improvisations between phrases. In some places, there was the feeling that either of them could go anywhere."
