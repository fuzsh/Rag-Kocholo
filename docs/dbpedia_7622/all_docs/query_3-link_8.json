        "text": "The El Martinete bird logo was inspired by one of the most significant features of the Villa. Pablo Picasso, who created ‘The Dancer’ drawing which is copied in the Villa’s swimming pool. It is his artistic legacy.\n\nPicasso was a bird lover and often featured them in his art. He named his fourth child, a daughter, Paloma, the Spanish word for dove.\n\nPicasso’s first Dove of Peace, was a naturalistic ink wash of a white dove. It was chosen as the emblem for the First International Peace Conference in Paris in 1949. His later dove images were simpler line drawings and became symbols of the peace movement during the Cold War.\n\nThese iconic later versions of Picasso’s ‘Dove of Peace’ inspired the El Martinete logo."
