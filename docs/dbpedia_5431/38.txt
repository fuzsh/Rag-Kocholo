In 1948, LVN Pictures decided to cast Jaime de la Rosa as Velez's leading man in her next picture. After a dispute regarding the decision, at about 1:00 am on June 27, 1948, Anzures barged into the home of Velez in Quezon City and stabbed her and a housemaid to death in front of Velez's daughter Vivian and another housemaid. After the incident, Anzures fled to Santa Cruz, Laguna, where he surrendered a few days later.[1]

At his trial, Anzures pled insanity, claiming to have been under a "fantastic spell" when he committed the crime, but eventually pled guilty on July 19, 1949. He was sentenced to two sentences of life imprisonment and was ordered to pay P5,000 each to the relatives of his victims, but was later pardoned by President Elpidio Quirino. He died from tuberculosis shortly after his release; his exact motives for the killings were never determined.[1]

In the 1995 film The Lilian Velez Story, Filipino actor Cesar Montano played the role of Narding Anzures, who murdered actress singer Lilian Velez, which was played by the Sharon Cuneta. It was directed by Carlo J. Caparas and co-produced by Golden Lion Films and Viva Entertainment.
