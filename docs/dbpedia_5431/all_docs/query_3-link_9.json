        "text": "Career\n\nHer 1948 murder by fellow actor Bernardo \"Narding\" Anzures scandalized post-war Philippines. Her film career began upon the resumption of Filipino film production after the end of the war. Her leading man in these films was Narding Anzures, a former child actor.\n\nAfter the success of Sa Kabukiran, Licensed Vocational Nursing Pictures decided to cast Jaime de la Rosa as Velez\"s leading man in her next film.\n\nThe decision caused distress on the part of Anzures, who had seemingly become obsessed with the married Velez. On the night of June 26, 1948, Anzures paid an unexpected visit to the Quezon City home of Velez.\n\nUpon his arrival, he stabbed Velez to death and a housemaid who had come to her mistress\"s assistance. The crime was committed within view of Velez\"s toddler daughter Vivian, who was unharmed during the incident.\n\nAnzures was promptly arrested, tried and convicted for the murders.\n\nThe crime and the subsequent trial was a cause célèbre in Manila. Anzures later died in jail from tuberculosis. His exact motives for the murder were never fully determined.\n\nIn 1995, the murder of Lilian Velez was the subject of a high-profile film directed by Carlo J. Caparas.\n\nStarring Sharon Cuneta as Velez and Cesar Montano as Anzures, the film was one in a string of \"true-crime\" films churned out by Caparas in the early 1990s.Her beautiful daughter Vivian Climaco-Ocampo."
