        "text": "Saul Funeral Homes has been in service to the families of New Jersey for over 100 years. At this point, we have become a community institution that hundreds of families look to in their times of need. We believe that any business's success is due to dedication and professionalism. You will find each member of our staff to be kind, compassionate, and available to work out all the details of any end-of-life arrangement. We work hard to preserve the traditions and customs of each family. We want you to know that each service is customizable to the deceased. Our funeral home is a peaceful and soothing environment where you can gather with your family and friends to celebrate a life well-lived.\n\nSaul Funeral Homes offers options for traditional funeral services like a viewing or visitation before the funeral and a graveside ceremony at the burial site. You can also expect to see military honors and veteran services represented for each loved one who qualifies. Cremation services are a large part of our offerings, with direct cremation being the most affordable. If you select cremation with a memorial ceremony, you can schedule the memorial to take place at your family’s convenience instead of rushing to fit a burial timeline. Life celebrations are a unique way to throw a party in your loved one’s honor, with a more casual and light atmosphere. All ceremonies are fully-customizable to your preferences.\n\nAnother way that you can prepare for an upcoming death is through pre-planning funeral services. Sit down with a member of our team to discuss caskets, urns, permanent memorialization, speakers, catering, and more. Our goal is to make your life easier so that you can focus on spending time with friends and family. Pre-planning services will make that happen.\n\nSaul Funeral Homes reside side by side with members of the Hamilton, Robbinsville, Columbus, Lawrence, Bordentown, Allentown, Cranbury, South Brunswick, Plainsboro, West Windsor, Monroe, East Windsor, Princeton, and Jamesburg communities. We are neighbors and friends, ready to help."
