        "text": "Bernardo “Narding” Anzures (1928–1949) was a Filipino film actor and convicted murderer.\n\nQuick Facts Born, Died ...\n\nClose\n\nThe son of actors Miguel Anzures and Rosa Aguirre, Anzures had starred in pre–World War II films as a child actor under Sampaguita Pictures & LVN Pictures. After the war, he was paired with Lilian Velez in three films produced by Filippine Films & Philippine Pictures Inc., such as Binibiro Lamang Kita, Ang Estudyante, and Sa Kabukiran which was directed by Velez's husband, Jose Climaco.\n\nMore information Year, Title ...\n\nYearTitleNotes 1947Sa KabukiranPhilippine Pictures Inc., also being composed by his former on-screen partner's father, Manuel Velez; and also his last film appearance with Lilian Velez as his on-screen partner 1947Ang EstudyantePhilippine Pictures Inc., his second film appearance with Lilian Velez 1946Death MarchPhilippine Pictures Inc. 1941Binibiro Lamang KitaFilippine Films, first being paired with Lilian Velez as his first on-screen partner 1941BinatilloLVN Pictures, final appearance with his father, Miguel Anzures 1940BahaghariFilippine Films, last appearance with his mother, Rosa Aguirre 1940GunitaFilippine Films 1940Inang PulotFilippine Films 1939Ang MagsasampaguitaSampaguita Pictures 1938Ang Batang TulisanFilippine Films 1937Ilaw ng LangitFilippine Films 1937Taong DemonyoFilippine Films\n\nClose\n\nIn 1948, LVN Pictures decided to cast Jaime de la Rosa as Velez's leading man in her next picture. After a dispute regarding the decision, at about 1:00 am on June 27, 1948, Anzures barged into the home of Velez in Quezon City and stabbed her and a housemaid to death in front of Velez's daughter Vivian and another housemaid. After the incident, Anzures fled to Santa Cruz, Laguna, where he surrendered a few days later.[1]\n\nAt his trial, Anzures pled insanity, claiming to have been under a \"fantastic spell\" when he committed the crime, but eventually pled guilty on July 19, 1949. He was sentenced to two sentences of life imprisonment and was ordered to pay P5,000 each to the relatives of his victims, but was later pardoned by President Elpidio Quirino. He died from tuberculosis shortly after his release; his exact motives for the killings were never determined.[1]\n\nIn the 1995 film The Lilian Velez Story, Filipino actor Cesar Montano played the role of Narding Anzures, who murdered actress singer Lilian Velez, which was played by the Sharon Cuneta. It was directed by Carlo J. Caparas and co-produced by Golden Lion Films and Viva Entertainment."
