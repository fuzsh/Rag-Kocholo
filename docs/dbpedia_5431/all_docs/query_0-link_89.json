        "text": "Narding Anzures was a Filipino film actor and convicted murderer.\n\nThe son of actors Miguel Anzures and Rosa Aguirre, Anzures had starred in pre–World War II films as a child actor. After the war, he was paired with Lilian Velez in three LVN films, Binibiro Lamang Kita, Ang Estudyante, and Sa Kabukiran.\n\nIn 1948, LVN had decided to cast Jaime de la Rosa as Velez's leading man in her next picture. The decision upset Anzures. On the night of June 26, Anzures barged into the home of Velez and stabbed her and a housemaid to death.\n\nAnzures was promptly arrested, tried and convicted for the murders. He died in prison from tuberculosis.\n\nReferences\n\nGarcia, Jessie B. (2004). A Movie Album Quizbook. Iloilo City, Philippines: Erehwon Books & Magazine. pp. 81–83. ISBN 971-93297-0-X."
