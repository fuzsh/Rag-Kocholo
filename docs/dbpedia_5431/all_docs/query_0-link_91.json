Considering that Hollywood was ahead of the Philippines in filmmaking by exactly two decades and a half, the Oscar invite was a feat indeed.\n\nAnd those weren’t the only “firsts,” she had notched. After her fifth win at the FAMAS in 1984 as Best Actress for “Don’t Cry for Me, Mama” (1983), she became its first inductee into the Hall of Fame. Her four other FAMAS wins as Best Actress came from “Igorota,” “Kundiman ng Lahi”(1959); “Emily” (1960) and “Angustia” (1963).\n\nThe Metro Manila Film Festival also listed her as its first Best Actress winner for “Araw-Araw, Gabi-Gabi” in 1975.\n\nSo, just how Charito came to be one of the finest actresses of all time?\n\nOur search for answers led us to the heart of Poblacion in Sta. Rosa, Laguna, where Yolly, the last of the Solis’ lives. Yolly Tiongco is the wife of Emil Tiongco of the fabulous Tiongco Brothers. Charito’s only brother was the late Tristan and the eldest was Carmen, who died two years ago.\n\nYolly says that her sister was discovered for the movies by their uncle, film director Felicing Constantino who introduced Charito, then a 19-year-old U.E. (University of the East) student to LVN Pictures’ matriarch Doña Narcisa de Leon.\n\n“Nagse-search sila noon ng new face para sa role ng ‘Niña Bonita,’ wala silang makita. Eh ayaw na ayaw naman ni Charito noon at ayaw din naman ng mama ko. Pero siguro may nakita si Doña Sisang sa kanya na extra special, kasi pagkakita sa kanya, sabi agad: Ito gusto ko!”\n\nYolly describes Charito’s first shooting day as a “nightmare.” “Inabot ng 16 takes. Una, yung katigasan ng ulo n’ya. The scene required her to dive into the swimming pool. Ewan ko ba kung bakit, dahil marunong naman siyang lumangoy. Pero ayaw n’ya. Kasi daw baka mauntog ang ulo n’ya sa pool.\n\n“The shoot was packed-up. Nagsumbong sila kay Doña Sisang, who, surprisingly sided with Charito. She said: ‘Bakit n’yo pipilitin ang bata? Eh, pa’no kung madisgrasya ‘yan?”\n\nThe producer, however, cautioned her on the realities of showbiz. According to Yolly, Doña Sisang said: Hija, hindi kita mapapangakuan na sa susunod mong movie ay ikaw ang starring role.’ But the feisty Charito was unperturbed. “Ay, hindi na ho. Ito na lang ho, ayoko na ho,” she allegedly replied.\n\nIn 1955, the Filipino moviegoers came to know Rosario Violeta Hernandez Solis a.k.a. Charito Solis in “Niña Bonita,” an adaptation of Frank Capra’s “It Happened One Night.” She shared the top billing with Jaime de la Rosa.\n\nAt the same time, the industry insiders knew that a willful artist just came to tinsel-town.\n\nDuring her prime, Charito’s histrionics on and off the set were legends. She was even compared to Italy’s Anna Magnani, an Oscar laureate for her lusty portrayal of a Sicilian widow in “The Rose Tattoo” (1955).\n\nTheir semblance was also more than just physical because like Anna, Charito also grew up stricken by poverty.\n\n“Our father died and our mother was sick of diabetes,” reveals Yolly.\n\nTheir dad, Maximo Solis was a newspaper reporter, while their mother, Milagros was a pharmacist in their aunt’s drugstore.\n\n“To survive, we were adopted by our relatives,” she furthers.\n\n“Early in life, we were separated from each other. Four or three years old lang kami noon. We were reunited only after nine years, when our eldest, Carmen had already a job. Siya bale ang tumayong nanay at tatay namin. Si Charito, naranasan n’ya ang magtinda ng sampaguita.”\n\nThe early challenges must have taught Charito to be strong.\n\nYolly agrees. “Kaya naging palaban si Charito. Parang tomboy yan eh. Tapos, lagi n’yang inaaway yung mga lalaki kasi ligawin s’ya. ‘Pag nakakita siya ng sulat sa libro, aawayin na n’ya yung naglagay no’n. Saka, ang mga laro n’ya, yung aakyat sa puno.”\n\nCharito commanded decorum on the movie set because she was the epitome of professionalism. And during dramatic shoots, unnecessary noise wasn’t allowed because Charito, the actress was expected to deliver no less than a bravura performance.\n\nThere were also talks that if she deemed wise, she’d come to the location with her acting trophies, just to remind her co-stars, big and small, that they’re dealing with a competent actress and their whims won’t be tolerated.\n\nYolly smiles. “Naku, naranasan ‘yan ni Vilma (Santos). Hindi lang siya, pati nga si Nora (Aunor) eh.” “Pero trait talaga ng Solis yun. My mother was very strict.
