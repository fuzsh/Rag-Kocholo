"THE STORY OF SIN is a Polish period drama that was based on a novel by STEFAN ZEROMSKI. It is perhaps the prominence of theme of the central youn woman's confrontation with sexuality that is what attracted the great filmmaker WALERIAN BOROWCZYK to adapt it for the big screen.

What he took on was a challenging task, simply because the film is overflowing with drama to an excessive extent. The character of Ewa feels like Madame Bovary, Moll Flanders and all other tragic heroines of classic literature rolled into one. None of them, in fact, had to endure during the course of a lifetime what she endures throughout hers, in a succession of events that is born out of her obsessive infatuation with a married gentleman against her parent's wishes, and is heavily marked by the men she encounters along her journey after she leaves her household who all seem keen about exploiting her in every possible way.

In THE STORY OF SIN, one can still sense a kind of excitement and physicality that is highlighted by the film's most creative sequences. But nothing exceeds expectations, and in fact in the end, perhaps the director was overcome by the need to keep the film progressing at a solid pace to make up for the wealth of narrative events that take place within it, and to prevent the film from being a monolithic anthology. There is an exciting scent of sexuality that marks the film, but very often it offers little against the slips into overtly melodramatic grounds."
