        "text": "Though there was no dedicated spot or even name for it yet, the art of cinema was represented at Lincoln Center from the beginning. Lincoln Center’s president William Schuman, recognizing the growing importance of film festivals around the world and the ever expanding presence of international cinema in the U.S., instituted a film department in 1963, which brought to the city that year the first New York Film Festival. Titles were selected by Richard Roud, who had been the programmer at the British Film Institute, and Amos Vogel, known to New York cinephiles for his Cinema 16, a film society founded in 1947 and known for its challenging fare. The very first opening-night selection was Luis Buñuel’s surreal classic The Exterminating Angel, which screened at Philharmonic Hall, a vast space that would be used for the festival for many years to come. Writes Phillip Lopate:\n\n“The New York Film Festival had a profound effect on American film culture, helping to shape the discussion by setting high standards and calling attention to daring, demanding works of cinematic art year after year.”\n\nWith no actual brick-and-mortar location, the film department was something of a peripatetic entity, organizing events, screenings, lectures, symposia, and educational programs, in addition to the annual NYFF, with its annual costs covered by the Lincoln Center Fund. By 1967, as LCPA assessed its finances, Schuman began planning for the department to become something larger that could stand alone, and he brought in well-known businessman Martin E. Segal to help organize it. Thus, on May 9, 1969, the Film Society of Lincoln Center was born, with Segal as President and Richard Roud continuing as the Program Director of the New York Film Festival. Says eventual Executive Director Joanne Koch: “The stated aim of this new organization was to contribute to the recognition of the importance of film as a leading artistic from and a vital medium for aesthetic and social expression.”\n\nThe New York Film Festival is still a cornerstone event of the American film scene, currently under the guidance of NYFF Director Kent Jones, this year celebrating its 57th anniversary. Yet this is just one part of what the Film Society has achieved. Over the coming years and decades, FSLC would institute a variety of touchstone events, series, programs, and festivals that would come to define the organization.\n\nBob & Carol & Ted & Alice (Paul Mazursky) (Opening Night)\n\nOh!
