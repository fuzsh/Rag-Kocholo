        "text": "Walerian Borowczyk, an internationally known Surrealist filmmaker described variously by critics as a genius, a pornographer and a genius who also happened to be a pornographer, died Feb. 3 in Paris, where he had resided since the late 1950s. He was 82.\n\nThe cause was heart trouble, friends of Borowczyk told Agence France- Presse. His wife, Ligia Branice,who starred in several of his films, is his only known survivor.\n\nIf Franz Kafka and the filmmaker Luis BunÌƒuel were cross-pollinated, the result would be Borowczyk. Originally trained as a painter and graphic artist, he made dozens of films, both animated and live-action, in the decades after World War II. His work attracted a cult following over the years and has been cited as an influence on contemporary filmmakers like Terry Gilliam.\n\nBorowczyk, known as Boro, was born in Kwilcz, near Poznan, in 1923.Working first in his native Poland and later in France, Borowczyk (pronounced bo- ROV-chick) was drawn incessantly to the competing lures of sex and death. His live-action films were known for their candid, often explicit, depictions of sexual congress."
