        "text": "Cinema Paradiso\n\nA CELEBRATION OF YOUTH, FRIENDSHIP, AND THE EVERLASTING MAGIC OF THE MOVIES\n\nA winner of awards across the world including Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, five BAFTA Awards including Best Actor, Original Screenplay and Score, the Grand Prize of the Jury at the Cannes Film Festival and many more.\n\nGiuseppe Tornatore's loving homage to the cinema tells the story of Salvatore, a successful film director, returning home for the funeral of Alfredo, his old friend who was the projectionist at the local cinema throughout his childhood. Soon memories of his first love affair with the beautiful Elena and all the high and lows that shaped his life come flooding back, as Salvatore reconnects with the community he left 30 years earlier.\n\nPresented in both the original award-winning cut and the expanded Director's Cut incorporating more of Salvatore's backstory, newly restored from original negative materials.\n\nSPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS\n\n· Restored from the original camera negative and presented in two versions - the 124 minute Cannes Festival theatrical version and the 174 minute Director's Cut\n\n· Uncompressed original stereo 2.0 Audio and 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio options\n\n· Optional English subtitles\n\n· Audio commentary with director Giuseppe Tornatore and Italian cinema expert critic Millicent Marcus\n\n· A Dream of Sicily - A 52-minute documentary profile of Giuseppe Tornatore featuring interviews with director and extracts from his early home movies as well as interviews with director Francesco Rosi and painter Peppino Ducato, set to music by the legendary Ennio Morricone\n\n· A Bear and a Mouse in Paradise - A 27-minute documentary on the genesis of Cinema Paradiso, the characters of Toto and Alfredo, featuring interviews with the actors who play them, Philippe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio as well as Tornatore\n\n· The Kissing Sequence - Giuseppe Tornatore discusses the origins of the kissing scenes with full clips identifying each scene\n\n· Original Director's Cut Theatrical Trailer and 25th Anniversary Re-Release Trailer\n\nFIRST PRESSING ONLY: Collector's booklet by Pasquale Iannone illustrated with archive stills, behind-the-scenes images and posters\n\nThe Creeping Garden\n\nA REAL-LIFE SCIENCE-FICTION MOVIE EXPLORING A WORLD CREEPING RIGHT BENEATH OUR FEET, WHERE TIME AND SPACE ARE MAGNIFIED AND INTELLIGENCE REDEFINED.\n\nThe Creeping Garden is an award-winning feature-length creative documentary exploring the extraordinary world of the plasmodial slime mould as revealed through the eyes of the fringe scientists, mycologists and artists who work with them.\n\nLong overlooked by biologists, in recent years this curious organism has become the focus of much research in such areas as biological-inspired design, emergence theory, unconventional computing and robot engineering, much of which borders on the world of science fiction. The film transports us from the laboratory into its natural habitat, depicting these otherworldly lifeforms using startling time-lapse macro-cinematography to reveal hidden facets of the world around us.\n\nCo-directed by the artist film-maker Tim Grabham (KanZeOn) and author and film critic Jasper Sharp, with an original soundtrack composed by celebrated musician and producer Jim O'Rourke (Sonic Youth, Grizzly Man), The Creeping Garden is a unique exploration into a hitherto untapped subject matter, immersing the viewer within the worlds of the observers and the observed.\n\nDIRECTOR-APPROVED SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS\n\nHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentations\n\nOriginal 2.0 audio (uncompressed on the Blu-ray)\n\nOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\n\nAudio commentary by directors Tim Grabham and Jasper Sharp\n\nBiocomputer Music , a short film by Grabham on the first biocomputer music system, allowing a two-way musical dialogue between man and slime mould\n\nReturn to the Fungarium , a featurette revealing further treasures of the fungarium at Kew Gardens\n\nFeeding Habits of Physarum , a featurette on the feeding preferences and dislikes of slime moulds\n\nThree cinema iloobia short films: Milk (2009), Rotten (2012) and Paramusical Ensemble (2015)\n\nAngela Mele's animated slime moulds\n\nGallery\n\nUS theatrical trailer\n\nReversible sleeve featuring two pieces of original artwork\n\nTHE CREEPING GARDEN SOUNDTRACK [Limited Edition Exclusive]\n\nBonus CD containing the rearranged soundtrack to The Creeping Garden by legendary producer and musician Jim O'Rourke\n\nPLUS... FIRST PRESSING ONLY: Illustrated collector's booklet containing writing on the film by Jasper Sharp\n\nProperty is No Longer A Theft\n\nHaving tackled the corrupting nature of power with Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion and taken an angry, impassioned look at labour relations with The Working Class Goes to Heaven, Italian master Elio Petri next turned his attentions to capitalism for the darkly comic Property is No Longer a Theft.\n\nA young bank clerk (Flavio Bucci, the blind pianist in Dario Argento's Suspiria), denied a loan by his employer, decides to exact his revenge the local butcher (Ugo Tognazzi, La Grande bouffe) who is not only a nasty, violent, greedy piece of work but also one of the bank's star customers. Quitting his job, the clerk devotes all of his time tormenting the butcher, stealing his possessions one-by-one, including his mistress (Daria Nicolodi, Deep Red).\n\nTold in an off-kilter fashion by Petri, abetted by the woozy sound design and another outstanding score by Ennio Morricone, Property is No Longer a Theft presents a caustic, blackly comic look at a corrupt society.\n\nSPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS:\n\n4K restoration from the original film negative\n\nHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentations\n\nNew subtitle translation\n\nBrand-new interview with actor Flavio Bucci\n\nBrand-new interview with producer Claudio Mancini\n\nBrand-new interview with make-up artist Pierantonio Mecacci\n\nReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Nathanael Marsh\n\nFIRST PRESSING ONLY: Illustrated collector's booklet containing new writing on the film by Camilla Zamboni"
