Starting off his career as a designer for film posters with a background in the Fine Arts (more specifically painting), Borowczyk gained recognition with the short animated film “Dom” he collaborated on with fellow poster designer Jan Lenica. With the awarded prize money, he started a new life and career in Paris, where he directed a string of short films using different types of animation techniques. His first live-action feature, “Goto, Island of Love”, adapted with ease to the prevailing trends in the modernist cinema of the 1960s. In “Blanche”, he delivered a sample of things to come: a story set in a past era, framed with a historian’s eye for period detail and an artistic sensitivity to the beauty of the image. The veiled eroticism of “Blanche” was later made explicit in films that were decisively sexual and subversive (\"Contes immoraux\", \"Behind Convent Walls\", \"La Bête”)."
