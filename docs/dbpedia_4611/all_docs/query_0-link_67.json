The film transports us from the laboratory into its natural habitat, depicting these otherworldly lifeforms using startling time-lapse macro-cinematography to reveal hidden facets of the world around us.\n\nCo-directed by the artist film-maker Tim Grabham (KanZeOn) and author and film critic Jasper Sharp, with an original soundtrack composed by celebrated musician and producer Jim O’Rourke (Sonic Youth, Grizzly Man), The Creeping Garden is a unique exploration into a hitherto untapped subject matter, immersing the viewer within the worlds of the observers and the observed.\n\nDIRECTOR-APPROVED SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS\n\nHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentations\n\nOriginal 2.0 audio (uncompressed on the Blu-ray)\n\nOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\n\nAudio commentary by directors Tim Grabham and Jasper Sharp\n\nBiocomputer Music, a short film by Grabham on the first biocomputer music system, allowing a two-way musical dialogue between man and slime mould\n\nReturn to the Fungarium, a featurette revealing further treasures of the fungarium at Kew Gardens\n\nFeeding Habits of Physarum, a featurette on the feeding preferences and dislikes of slime moulds\n\nThree cinema iloobia short films: Milk (2009), Rotten (2012) and Paramusical Ensemble (2015)\n\nAngela Mele’s animated slime moulds\n\nGallery\n\nUS theatrical trailer\n\nReversible sleeve featuring two pieces of original artwork\n\nTHE CREEPING GARDEN SOUNDTRACK [Limited Edition Exclusive]\n\nBonus CD containing the rearranged soundtrack to The Creeping Garden by legendary producer and musician Jim O’Rourke\n\nPLUS… FIRST PRESSING ONLY: Illustrated collector’s booklet containing writing on the film by Jasper Sharp\n\nRRP: $29.95\n\nRegion: 0\n\nRating: Exempt\n\nDuration: 84 mins\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSubtitles: English SDH\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1\n\nAudio: Stereo 2.0\n\nColour\n\nDiscs: 2\n\nUS Cat No: AA004\n\nUS Barcode: 760137977186\n\nDirected by: Tim Grabham & Jasper Sharp\n\nStarring: Heather Barnett, Eduardo Reck Miranda\n\nStory of Sin\n\nThe life of a beautiful, young and pious woman is thrown into chaos when her parents takes in a dashingly handsome lodger.

He was the world.\n\nA string of masterpieces behind him – including Ossessione, Senso, The Leopard and Death in Venice – the great Italian director Luchino Visconti turned his attentions to the life and death of King Ludwig II of Bavaria in 1972, resulting in an epic of 19th century decadence.\n\nDominated by Helmut Berger (The Damned, The Bloodstained Butterfly) in the title role, Ludwig nevertheless manages to find room for an impressive cast list: Romy Schneider (reprising her Elisabeth of Austria characterisation from the Sissi trilogy), Silvana Mangano (Bitter Rice), Gert Fröbe (Goldfinger), John Moulder-Brown (Deep End) and Trevor Howard (Brief Encounter) as RichardWagner.\n\nAs opulent as any of Visconti’s epics – Piero Tosi’s costume design was nominated for an Academy Award – Ludwig is presented here in its complete form in accordance with the director’s wishes and features the English-language soundtrack for the first ever on home video.\n\nSPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS:\n\n4K restoration from the original film negative\n\nHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentations\n\nTwo viewing options: the full-length theatrical cut or as five individual parts\n\nOriginal Italian soundtrack with optional English subtitles\n\nOriginal English soundtrack available on home video for the first time ever with optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\n\nBrand-new interview with actor Helmut Berger\n\nLuchino Visconti, an hour-long documentary portrait of the director by Carlo Lizzani (Wake Up and Kill, Requiescant) containing interviews with Burt Lancaster, Vittorio Gassman, Francesco Rosi, Claudia Cardinale and others\n\nSpeaking with Suso Cecchi d’Amico, an interview with the screenwriter\n\nSilvana Mangano: The Scent Of A Primrose, a half-hour portrait of the actress\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nFIRST PRESSING ONLY: Illustrated collector’s booklet containing new writing by Peter Cowie\n\nRRP: $49.95\n\nRegion: 1+2\n\nRating: 12\n\nDuration: 257 mins\n\nLanguage: Italian / English\n\nSubtitles: English / English SDH\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1\n\nAudio: Mono 1.0\n\nColour\n\nDiscs: 4\n\nUS Cat No: AA002\n\nUS Barcode: 760137977384\n\nDirected by: Luchino Visconti\n\nStarring: Helmut Berger, Romy Schneider, Silvana Mangano\n\nProperty is No Longer a Theft\n\nHaving tackled the corrupting nature of power with Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion and taken an angry, impassioned look at labour relations with The Working Class Goes to Heaven, Italian master Elio Petri next turned his attentions to capitalism for the darkly comic Property is No Longer a Theft.\n\nA young bank clerk (Flavio Bucci, the blind pianist in Dario Argento’s Suspiria), denied a loan by his employer, decides to exact his revenge on the local butcher (Ugo Tognazzi, La Grande bouffe) who is not only a nasty, violent, greedy piece of work but also one of the bank’s star customers. Quitting his job, the clerk devotes all of his time tormenting the butcher, stealing his possessions one-by-one, including his mistress (Daria Nicolodi, Deep Red).\n\nTold in an off-kilter fashion by Petri, abetted by the woozy sound design and another outstanding score by Ennio Morricone, Property is No Longer a Theft presents a caustic, blackly comic look at a corrupt society.\n\nSPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS:\n\n4K restoration from the original film negative\n\nHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentations\n\nNew subtitle translation\n\nBrand-new interview with actor Flavio Bucci\n\nBrand-new interview with producer Claudio Mancini\n\nBrand-new interview with make-up artist Pierantonio Mecacci\n\nReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Nathanael Marsh\n\nFIRST PRESSING ONLY: Illustrated collector’s booklet containing new writing on the film by Camilla Zamboni\n\nRRP: $39.95\n\nRegion: A+B / 1+2\n\nRating: TBC\n\nDuration: 126 mins\n\nLanguage: Italian\n\nSubtitles: English\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85:1\n\nAudio: 1.0 Mono\n\nColour\n\nDiscs: 2\n\nUS Cat No: AA003\n\nUS Barcode: 760137977483\n\nDirected by: Elio Petri\n\nStarring: Ugo Tognazzi, Flavio Bucci, Daria Nicolodi\n\n# # #"
