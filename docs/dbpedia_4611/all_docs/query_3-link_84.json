        "text": "Walerian Borowczyk was a Polish film director who worked in France. He was born in Kwilcz-Poland on October 21, 1923 and later died in Paris on February 3rd, 2006. His career was mainly executed in France and was widely recognized for his great talents. He was able to direct over 40 films and he was awarded a national prize for creating posters for the theater. Before he created live action films, he used to make surreal animations which brings him to create one of his most known pieces called the “Renaissance”.\n\nThis piece called Renaissance was all done in reverse stop motion. I really liked how he linked the story with the actual method for recording it as well. I didn’t expect the ending to be what I saw, but then I understood what he had done and I thought it was exemplary. This animations is about a room that is completely destroyed, but little by little, as time goes backwards, it starts to rebuild itself and everything in it. From the feathers on the owl to the broken necklace on the doll, everything is put back together only to be destroyed by a grenade at the end again. I think he is trying to say that even though we may try to build everything back up again, there will always be something that takes us back to a time where we must fall and get back up – only to repeat the process again and again."
