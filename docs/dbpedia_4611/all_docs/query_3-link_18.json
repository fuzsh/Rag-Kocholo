        "text": "9 - 23 March 2018: Walerian Borowczyk: Obscure Pleasures\n\nMaster craftsman, Dadaist prankster, and unrepentant sensualist, Walerian Borowczyk spent half a century working at the juncture of fine art and cinema. Born in Poland during the 1920s, Borowczyk trained as a painter and sculptor before establishing himself first as a poster artist and later an animation filmmaker. Having relocated to France during the late 1950s, Borowczyk produced a succession of startling, often comic short films that were as innovative as they were provocative. When Borowczyk made the transition to feature films, he joined the ranks of the titans of world cinema.\n\nNot only was Borowczyk a trailblazer for fine artists working in film but he also brought a keen, painterly eye to framing and editing objects, animals, and bodies. Expertly marrying film to both classical and electronic music, Borowczyk’s approach to cinema harked back to the silent days (Méliès, Keaton, Eisenstein) and even pre-cinema (Muybridge, chrono-photography, and zoetropes). From the outset, Borowczyk favored both fantasy and eroticism, tendencies in his work that became more pronounced with the relaxation of censorship. A sense of earthy humour masks a distinctly moral sensibility, eager to satirize the corruption of institutions, whether they be feudal, clerical, or bureaucratic.\n\nPresented in collaboration with Friends of Walerian Borowczyk this programme focuses on the Polish artist’s early features alongside two shorts programmes, one of which is dedicated to his rarely screened art documentaries. These screenings are accompanied by an exhibition of Borowczyk’s graphic art, and a talk by Daniel Bird, co-producer of Arrow Academy’s Camera Obscura: The Walerian Borowczyk Collection, co-founder of Friends of Walerian Borowczyk and author of Boro: Walerian Borowczyk, copies of which will be on sale throughout.\n\nProgramme 1: Story of Sin\n\nBased on the novel by Stefan Żeromski, Story of Sin is Borowczyk’s singular Polish feature film. Casting a critical eye on the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church, Story of Sin counts as Borowczyk’s most passionate film, a delirious melodrama that reaches an ecstatic pitch. read more\n\nThe Phonograph, Walerian Borowczyk, 1969, 6 min, Colour, Digital\n\nStory of Sin, Walerian Borowczyk, 1975, 124 min, Colour, Digital\n\nProgramme 2: Walerian Borowczyk: Shorts\n\nWalerian Borowczyk’s first decade as a filmmaker produced a dazzling array of shorts, pioneering both narrative strategies (Renaissance’s reverse-explosion) and stylistic elements (cutout and hand-painted animation), influencing artists as wide-ranging as collaborators Chris Marker and admirer Terry Gilliam. read more\n\nThe Astronauts, Walerian Borowczyk & Chris Marker, 1959, 12 min, B/W, Digital\n\nThe Concert, Walerian Borowczyk, 1962, 6 min, Colour, Digital\n\nGrandma’s Encyclopedia, Walerian Borowczyk, 1963, 7 min, B/W, Digital\n\nRenaissance, Walerian Borowczyk, 1963, 9 min, B/W, Digital\n\nHoly Smoke!, Walerian Borowczyk, 1963, 10 min, Colour, Digital\n\nJoachim’s Dictionary, Walerian Borowczyk, 1965, 9 min, Colour, Digtal\n\nScherzo Infernal, Walerian Borowczyk, 1984, 5 min, Colour, Digital\n\nProgramme 3: Theatre of Mr and Mrs Kabal\n\nSet in a barren wasteland thinly populated by exotic flora and fauna, Borowczyk’s only animated feature (rendered in sparse, coarse, and, for the most part, monochrome graphics) serves as a stiff antidote to Disney’s saccharine whimsy. read more\n\nGavotte, Walerian Borowczyk, 1967, 12 min, Colour, Digital\n\nTheatre of Mr and Mrs Kabal, Walerian Borowczyk, 1967, 80 min, Colour, Digital\n\nProgramme 4: Goto, Island of Love\n\nA petty thief works his way up the absurd hierarchy of Goto, an archipelago cut off from civilization by a tumultuous earthquake.
