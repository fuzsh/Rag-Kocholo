        "text": "Painter, poster artist, sculptor and filmmaker, Walerian Borowczyk is a major filmmaker and visual artist of the second half of the 20th century. In each of his films, he plays with the mixture and limits of his various practices, producing a hybrid cinematographic work of great richness, both aesthetic and historical. His filmography is still little known today, yet it has a considerable place in the history of the French avant-garde.\n\nTo mark the centenary of the filmmaker’s birth, the CJC is screening a selection of his short films to celebrate the diversity of practices and techniques in his filmography, with a particular focus on his animation work. Mixing the filmmaker’s masterpieces with films rarely shown in cinemas - notably from his Polish period - the programme reflects both the artistic legacy he celebrates in his films and the one he leaves behind.\n\nThe screening pays tribute to a cinema made of bodies, real bodies, papers or drawings that dismember, reconstruct and embrace each other, in films made from newspapers, scraps of paper, photographs and found footage, which themselves distort and transform. And at the centre of these images, objects become protagonists, coming to life before our very eyes, lulled by the filmmaker’s own satirical and absurd humour."
