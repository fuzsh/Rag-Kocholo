        "text": "This article defends the relevance of Slavoj Žižek in the field of film studies through a close reading of his book, The Fright of Real Tears: Krzysztof Kieslowski Between Theory and Post-Theory (2001). In this book, Žižek responds to critiques of film theory, particularly those of David Bordwell and Noël Carroll in their anthology, Post-Theory: Reconstructing Film Studies (1996). In doing so, Žižek adds significantly to film theory by addressing errors found in early psychoanalytic film theory, and amending them in a way that focuses more specifically on questions about ideology and subjectivity. The first part of this article demonstrates the way in which a psychoanalytic interpretation of cinema can add to a theory of ideology and subjectivity; while the second part focuses on Žižek’s interpretation of Kieslowski’s films, which serve as a means for defending Theory [capital T] against post-Theory. For Žižek, this split in film studies indicates the existence of class struggle in intellectual discourse at the level of ideology.\n\nIn this paper, I use two films—Les Statues MeurrentAussi (Statues also Die, 1953) directed by Resnais and Marker and Sans Soleil (Sunless, 1983) as representatives of Left Bank cinema to show how they construct experiences of time and memory using various modernist strategies. Key to this is the use of a mental journey genre in modernist cinema and the construction of a facial dispositif which leads to a perceptual experiencing of inner states. Les Statues MeurrentAussi is a key film in the history of French cinema as it highlights Alain Resnais’ and Chris Marker’s early commitment towards a politically avant-garde filmmaking style. The film was banned for many decades because it was highly critical of France’s colonial interests. The film is also a proof to the less emphasised collaboration between two pioneering directors and especially in their use of the essay film genre. Sans Soleil on the other hand is considered as a philosophical masterpiece because of its meditations on time and memory. In taking these two films, I hope not only to demonstrate cinema’s capability to generate affective spatio-temporal states but also to highlight a piece of film history which is often misappropriated under the tag of the French New Wave.\n\nAs the credits start to roll at the end of Cold War (2018), the first shot bears the simple dedication 'for my parents' and the next one reads 'story, direction, image Paweł Pawlikowski.' Both are authorial inscriptions through which Pawlikowski announces himself to be the creative source from which, in line with auteur theory, the meanings and significance of the film ultimately derive. The credit 'story, direction, image' is unusual in that Pawlikowski clearly emphasizes the degree of creative control over all aspects of the film: not just the direction and the story (he co-wrote the script) but also the image, which we customarily attribute to the cinematographer. We also know, from the film's publicity and marketing which emphasized this fact, that Cold War is loosely inspired by the director's own parents' tumultuous relationship (McDonald and Sanders, 2017). In The Woman in the Fifth/La Femme du Vème (2011), based on the novel by Douglas Kennedy, Pawlikowski had appropriated authorship by writing the script himself ('screenplay by Pawel Pawlikowski') and by portraying an infirm writer-the artist-a figure through whom, Lucy Fischer (2013) argues, filmmakers frequently raise questions about the paradoxes of authorship. 1 It is through these dual channels-the creative figure who stands outside the text and the one who stands within it as corporeal presence-that Pawlikowski inscribes authorship in his oeuvre. He thereby asserts that his films' distinctive qualities and their importance, as auteur theory would have it, 'may be attributed to a single creative source who is responsible for bringing together its disparate elements into a coherent thematic and stylistic vision' (Watson, 2012: 143). Authorial inscriptions are not coincidental in Paweł Pawlikowski's oeuvre, and interview statements such as-'the thing that can salvage documentary (…) is Form. More important still is the personal vision of the director' (Macdonald, 1996: 391)-show that Pawlikowski is deeply indebted to the conceptual framework of authorship that permeates European cinema. In particular, the model of authorship that Pawlikowski follows, which foregrounds the author and where film is an artform with a higher purpose, is influenced both by the French New Wave, in its insistence on form, and by the Eastern European tradition, where the author is engaged in questions of historical and national identity. One goal of this Chapter is to introduce Paweł Pawlikowski's oeuvre and its thematic and stylistic characteristics, including selfreflexive authorial inscriptions, that link him to the tradition of European art cinema. Much has been written about Pawlikowski's individual fiction films, such as Last Resort (2001) or Ida (2013),\n\nNico Baumbach’s book examines an ongoing and variegated conversation in cinema studies with roots in Jean-Louis Comolli and Jean Narboni’s 1969 editorial statement in Cahiers du cinéma, ‘Cinéma/Idéologie/Critique.’ Not only does Comolli and Narboni’s article inform the book’s title but also its theoretical trajectory. The duo once posed the maxim that ‘every film is political,’ insofar as ‘the political’ is an outgrowth of the ideology/ideological apparatuses which (pre)determine it. The next decade, the seventies, saw the rise of psychoanalytic film theories, spearheaded by Christian Metz, Laura Mulvey, and ‘Screen Theory’s’ emphasis on the Lacanian symbolic. Theory was granted an emancipatory prowess, allotting what Louis Althusser deemed the ‘knowledge effect,’ as theory held the unique position to cognize vis-a-vis the symbolic structure upon which cinema’s ideological immediacy was stilted, with the cinematic-imaginary galvanized vide the participatory and voyeuristic pleasures of viewership. Soon after came David Bordwell and Noël Carroll’s attempts to unshackle cinema studies from the tethers of ‘Grand Theories.’ This position fomented during the next two decades and is most explicitly elaborated in the 1996 anthology, Post- Theory: Reconstructing Film Studies. Consequently, ‘post-theory’ cinema scholars co-opted the piecemeal modalities familiar to analytic philosophy, wielding empirically based histories, narrative analyses and cognitivist proclivities, and postulating a means of philosophizing the moving image without the assignment of a priori political stakes. The depoliticized post-theory position has certainly been challenged in the following decades, with the robust return of psychoanalytic and Marxist renderings of film theory – one only needs to consult Slavoj Žižek or Joan Copjec’s expansive literature – and a groundswell of Deleuzean film philosophies and theorists. Nonetheless, even politically guided responses such as D.N. Rodowick’s do not regard cinema, in and of itself, as inherently political but, instead, affirm that politics is a commitment that corresponds to one’s methods and conclusions. Similarly, both Žižek and his adversary, Bordwell, relegate cinema to the side of the imaginary, using theory to explicate objects (i.e., films) while placing knowledge on the side of theory. Baumbach’s program is a response to these tendencies, as his book proposes that we cannot separate pleasures and affects, ideas about what cinema is and the politics of cinema any more than we can effectively unify them.\n\nThis anthology assembles some of the earliest Czech texts on film published in the period between 1908 and 1939, i.e., between the rise of art cinema and the outbreak of World War II, writings that were instrumental in shaping the various ways film was seen and understood in this formative period. The authors include scientist Jan Evangelista Purkinje, whose studies of the perception of movement from 1819 and 1820 laid the foundation for the rise of the cinematic apparatus, and writers and critics Václav Tille and Karel Čapek, who, years before their counterparts abroad, analyzed cinematic language as it was emerging, reflecting on its genealogy, genres, and future development. How was it possible that, in a country without a well-developed film industry, these cultural and literary critics, linguists, theater directors, architects, and filmmakers articulated ideas and concepts that predated later theoretical developments? This collection suggests that Czech writers benefited from their location at the crossroads of Eastern and Western Europe, where Austrian, Slavic, German, French, and American cultures intermingled. The anthology is organized both thematically and chronologically to reflect the rise of film as a new medium, a cultural institution, and an art form—in other words, to document the discursive construction of film in its variety and multiplicity. The writings express a number of concerns that relate to major trends and forces of modernity in the twentieth century: film is seen as a means to educate and enlighten, as an example of the dynamic relation between time and space, as a new formal model for other arts, as a tool for ideological struggle, and as a unique signifying system. While some of the authors are known to scholars in various fields—Purkinje to historians of science, Karel Teige to students of the European avant-garde, Jan Mukařovský and Roman Jakobson to literary scholars and linguists, and Alexander Hackenschmied (a.k.a. Hammid) to film historians—only a few of their texts on film have been translated into English, and this anthology marks the first time they have been systematically and critically assembled. In this sense, the anthology continues the efforts of recent publications and exhibitions to showcase Central Europe as the site of key moments in art and cultural history. At the same time, it also situates art movements and theories within the complex framework of modernity, whose major forces ranged from technology and mass media to national politics. Instead of focusing on the history of film theory in a narrow academic sense, the anthology presents the reader with a great diversity of genres and styles of writing that address the formation and development of this emblematic component of modernity. In the first half of the twentieth century, film was seen as a medium that overturned the existing hierarchy of cultural values and radically transformed individual subjective experience. The texts herein do not document these transformations from an external, impartial point of view; on the contrary, they are an integral part of these changes—their manifestation and their agents.\n\nPhilosophy has repeatedly denied cinema in order to grant it artistic status. Adorno, for example, defined an ' uncinematic ' element in the negation of movement in modern cinema, ' which constitutes its artistic character '. Similarly, Lyotard defended an ' acinema ', which rather than selecting and excluding movements through editing, accepts what is ' fortuitous, dirty, confused, unclear, poorly framed, overexposed '. In his Handbook of Inaesthetics, Badiou embraces a similar idea, by describing cinema as an ' impure circulation ' that incorporates the other arts. Resonating with Bazin and his defence of ' impure cinema ', that is, of cinema's interbreeding with other arts, Badiou seems to agree with him also in identifying the uncinematic as the location of the Real. This article will investigate the particular impurities of cinema that drive it beyond the specificities of the medium and into the realm of the other arts and the reality of life itself. Privileged examples will be drawn from various moments in film history and geography, starting with the analysis of two films by Jafar Panahi: This Is Not a Film (In film nist, 2011), whose anti-cinema stance in announced in its own title; and The Mirror (Aineh, 1997), another relentless exercise in self-negation. It goes on to examine Kenji Mizoguchi's deconstruction of cinematic acting in his exploration of the geidomono genre (films about theatre actors) in The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums (Zangigku monogatari, 1939), and culminates in the conjuring of the physical experience of death through the systematic demolition of film genres in The Act of Killing (Joshua Oppenheimer et al., 2012)."
