        "text": "Most orders for in-stock items take less than 24 hours to ship (may take longer if you place an order over the weekend). Pre-orders are shipped as soon as the product arrives. International pre-orders may not come in before the street date. This is especially true with Australian pre-orders.\n\nAll items that come with a slipcover will say so in the product page.\n\nPre-orders will not say WITH SLIPCOVER until the product comes in.\n\nSlipcovers are not guaranteed to be in mint condition.\n\nIf you can order it, it's either in stock or a pre-order. If an item is out of stock you will not be able to add it to your cart. It's rare but our inventory may not be correct. So in some cases an item may have to be shipped separately."
