        "text": "Monthly Archives: June 2021\n\nMovie review: An Unquiet Grave (2021)\n\nPosted by in Movie review\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nchristine nyland, jacob a ware, shudder australia, terence key\n\nIf I could cast a single element of praise towards Terence Key’s directorial feature debut An Unquiet Grave, it would be for the bold attempt to have two actors carry the entire 1hr and 12 min running time. The problem is that despite what is admittedly fairly short for a feature, it still stretches the premise too thinly to warrant your complete attention.\n\nThe premise itself feels like something drawn out of Pet Sematary, where a man Jamie (Jacob A. Ware) hatches a plan to bring his wife back from the dead with the help of her twin sister Ava (Christine Nyland, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Key). Using some dark magic macguffin which relies on a ritualistic act taking place at the site of the death, Jamie drives Ava to the location in order to carry out said deed. What he fails to mention is that a blood sacrifice is in order.\n\nFrom here on in the movie drags its light plot to a bitter end using a few tricks of the trade in scares and thrills until the restless grave can find peace once more for its occupant. Both Nyland and Ware do incredibly well to lift the film using every ounce of acting prowess and for this the film can be thankful for their on screen presence but there’s not much else on show here.\n\nThe Diagnosis:\n\nIt was always a tough task to add depth to a shallow conceptual grave but there is enough substance here to keep you engaged… just.\n\nBoth actors chew on as much of the dialogue to keep up the momentum and there are also some choice decisions from director Keys to make his mark for hopefully more budget to expand on his and Nyland’s writing and directing future.\n\nSaul Muerte\n\nRetrospective: The Pit and the Pendulum (1991)\n\nPosted by in retrospective\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, jeffrey combs, Lance Henriksen, pit and the pendulum, stuart gordon\n\nFor those in the know, there’s a special place in the heart of the Surgeons team for the work of Stuart Gordon. If you haven’t already, please check out our podcast episodes on Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon, and Dolls.\n\nLinks are found at the end of this article.\n\nAt the time that we recorded these episodes, I remarked that we had neglected to include his take on the Edgar Allan Poe novella, The Pit and the Pendulum.\n\nNow celebrating 30 years since its release, it seems as good a time as any to retrospectively look back at this film which starred Lance Henriksen.\n\nUpon review, this clearly isn’t Gordon’s finest hour behind the camera, but that’s not to say that there’s not fun to be had in viewing the movie, and most of that is in part due to Henriksen’s performance, quietly subdued take of the evils that humans resort to in the name of lust and infatuation.\n\nHenriksen plays the Grand Inquisitor, Torquemada, during the torturous time of 15th Century Spain. His tirade has no bounds until he meets Maria (Rona De Ricci) and is immediately enamoured by her beauty. Torquemada struggles with the conflict that arises between his infatuation towards Maria and his devotion to the Church and decides to repress his sinful ways and subject his cruel desires outwardly, charging Maria with witchcraft and a trial by torture.\n\nWhilst imprisoned by a confessed Witch, Esmerelda (Frances Bay – Arachnophobia, Critters 3, In the Mouth of Madness). Here, Maria’s upturned world suddenly spawns new life and the possibility of something beyond our imaginations, but when her husband’s failed attempt to rescue sends him to the new torture device, the pit and the pendulum, is it all too late for resurrection to save him from certain doom.\n\nThe Pit and the Pendulum suffers from adding little substance to the subject at hand and while it isn’t a terrible film, it does fail to spark the imagination from a director known to stimulate the visual senses. It does boast the great Jeffrey Combs aka Herbert West in Re-Animator amongst the cast, but there’s not enough primordial fat for either Combs nor Henriksen to chew upon to make the film stand out. Instead it simmers rather than scorches the fiery subject matter.\n\nIt could have been so much more, but quite possibly the adaptation was a step to far for Gordon to handle or make his own, reduced to the shadows of Roger Corman and Vincent Price’s classic take from the sixties.\n\nSaul Muerte\n\nMovie review: Saint Maud (2020)\n\nPosted by in Movie review\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\na24 films, British Film Institute, Jennifer Ehle, Morfydd Clark, Rose Glass, Saint Maud\n\nIt’s a crying shame that Saint Maud has only just now been released to a wider audience through home entertainment here in Australia. Having been released in the UK back in 2019, and then picked up by A24 films, a company known for its ‘highbrow horror’ releases, such as The Lighthouse, Midsommar, and The Hole In The Ground. It easily sits in good company with these movies with themes of faith, madness, and salvation at its helm.\n\nThe narrative focuses on the burden that we carry through our lives when dealt with a traumatic episode. In this instance, we follow a nurse, Katie (Morfydd Clark – Crawl) who fails to save the life of a patient despite attempting CPR. So affected by this ordeal, Katie takes leave of her role in public health to invent a whole new identity in private care, and adopts the personna, Maud.\n\nThe story itself soon picks up with Maud assigned with the care of Amanda Kohl (Jennifer Ehle) a former dancer and choreographer who has succumbed to lymphoma. Believing that Amanda has been enveloped in sin, Maud then takes it upon herself to heal her through her faith and connection with God. So devoted is Maud to her beliefs that she begins to experience physical reactions that she believes is a testament to her unfounded devotion to the Lord. The beauty of the film is that it doesn’t question the faith itself but the extreme actions that manifest in an unstable mind when reduced to the base forms that life can subject us to. When we have nothing to fall upon other than our beliefs, then what can materialise out of faith can be an ill-fated journey through a twisted form of salvation. In Maud’s case, her salvation comes through not only cleansing her own soul, but by saving the soul of the atheist and sin-ridden Amanda, pushing these thoughts to its conclusion through pain, struggles, and ultimately redemption.\n\nCharged with bringing this tale to fruition is writer, director Rose Glass, who’s debut feature is a mature and psychological venture into the heart of humankind, constantly questioning our role in the world and what drives us, or steers us towards our fate.\n\nThe Diagnosis:\n\nBoth Clark and Ehle produce powerhouse performances that twist and turn through a beautiful mix of power and vulnerability. They are beyond exceptional in their perceptions of both Katie/Maud and Amanda respectively and help solidify and ground the fantastical in reality, so that by the film’s resolution, the horror that unfolds with a deep and unsettling feeling that resonates long after the closing credits.\n\nGlass proves that she is a talent to watch in the future who is able to tackle some dark, psychological subjects with the confidence of a veteran in her field.\n\nSaint Maud is quite possibly one of my favourite movies in recent years.\n\nSaul Muerte\n\nRetrospective: Slither (2006)\n\nPosted by in retrospective\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nElizabeth Banks, james gunn, michael rooker, Nathan Fillion, slither, umbrella entertainment\n\n15 years ago, before he would helm the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, Director James Gunn would mark his directorial debut with Slither, a black comedy, sci-fi horror movie centred around a small town in South Carolina that comes under siege from an alien parasite.\n\nIt’s a visual spectacle peppered with some humorous dialogue, highlighting the slow paced energy of the townsfolk suddenly thrust into a frenzied assault on their humble town and investing their bodies.\n\nUpon its release, Slither was considered a flop, as it never fell short of the budget used to make the film by a few million.\n\nI remember being a little bewildered by this at the time of its release as I thoroughly enjoyed its energy and direction, coupled with its strong influences from both Carpenter and Cronenberg, directors with whom I greatly admire their work.\n\nIt also boasted cracking performances from Nathan Fillion (who had already made a name for himself in Firefly) as Police Chief Bill Pardy, Elizabeth Banks (Brightburn) as Starla Grant, our female heroine, and Michael Rooker as her overbearing and protective husband Grant, who also becomes the first infected by the parasite.\n\nThe effects on show are its main selling point who create the tentacled, worm-like creatures with an element of Lovecraftian, body morphia. The humour too is light and zestful, which suits Fillion’s on-screen persona and a testament to Gunn’s writing ability.\n\nThis June, Umbrella Entertainment have released a blu-ray edition of the film as part of their Beyond Genres series with some cracking extras including:\n\nAudio Commentary with James Gunn and Nathan Fillion\n\nThe Slick Minds and Slimy Days of Slither: Making of featurette – 10 Mins\n\nWho Is Bill Pardy? – 5 Mins\n\nSlither Visual Effects Progressions – 5 Mins\n\nBringing Slithers Creatures to Life: FX Featurette – 19 Mins\n\nSlithery Set Tour With Nathan Fillion – 5 Mins\n\nThe Gorehound Grill: Brewin’ The Blood – 3 Mins\n\nThe King of Cult: Lloyd Kaufman’s Video Diary – 9 Mins\n\nDeleted Scenes – 11 Mins\n\nExtended Scenes – 8 Mins\n\nGag Reel – 8 Mins\n\nAll of which resurrect the fun element that was notably present behind the scenes and projected in all facets of what we see on-screen with the final product. This further cemented for me that Slither is a gem of a movie and the reason why it has garnered a cult following as a result.\n\nIf you haven’t caught this film, or was deterred by the low box office attendance at the time of its initial release, then I highly recommend that you check it out.\n\nSaul Muerte\n\nThe Conjuring Universe: How does it fair under the sequels scrutiny?\n\nPosted by in Uncategorized\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nAt the time of writing The Conjuring Universe has firmly established itself in the horror genre scene and James Wan et al have created a world of scares and delights across eight feature films. Arguably one of those features, The Curse of La Llorana has been demoted from the universe by its director Michael Chaves.\n\nI feel like I’d like to argue this point as it clearly is connected with Annabelle, mainly due to the presence of Father Perez, but if we are to take this as gospel, then we can put it to one side for the purpose of this article which is to look at trilogies when adopting the Surgeons theory of what makes a good sequel as outlined by Antony Yee in his article, Movie review: A Quiet Place Part II.\n\nTo recap, here is the criteria that we believe marks a decent sequel:\n\nIdentify the ideas, themes & executional elements that make the first film great. Or at least good. Or at least worthy of being sequelised.\n\nPay homage and do not violate/ignore said ideas and themes and elements.\n\nIntroduce new/expanded themes, ideas and elements that will NATURALLY ALIGN to your first ideas, themes & elements. (Ie: Don’t use your second movie to discredit & contradict your first).\n\nTo underline point 3 – DO NOT rehash the first film and just give people “more of the same”.\n\nDO NOT-NOT rehash the first film by giving more of the same…. BUT “BIGGER”.\n\nBe a good enough stand-alone film by itself.\n\nThe reason I am drawn to this in the realms of The Conjuring Universe, there is in effect two sets of trilogies at play, if we were to also put The Nun to one side.It’s yet to be seen if The Nun will establish a trilogy in its own right. There’s the Ed and Lorraine Warren Conjuring trilogy and the Annabelle trilogy, which is slightly more complex to scrutinise as it contains a prequel in the mix.\n\nSo let’s start by looking at the initial Conjuring trilogy which focuses on the paranormal investigations of Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) starting with…\n\nThe Conjuring 2\n\nDoes it identify the ideas, themes and executional elements from The Conjuring?\n\nHere it definitely does, Not only it incorporates the central characters Ed and Warren but similarly places them in another paranormal investigation centred on a family under duress from a spiritual entity that threatens them physically and mentally.\n\nDoes it pay homage to the original in the process?\n\nOnce again, yes, and centralises on the core elements that were set up in the first feature, establishing the key themes and ideas, and not demolishing them in any way. This is in large part due to James Wan taking the helm as director and in doing so, firmly establishes the look and feel of the movies through clever trickery of shadows and light to build up the tension.\n\nIntroducing new ideas.\n\nThe biggest component that comes into this movie is the expansion of the spiritual encounters with not just one paranormal entity but three. It’s main antagonist appears to be Bill Wilkins, but is also supported by The Crooked Man, and most notably Valak. A fearful entity that was so striking that launched a spin-off film of its own.\n\nIn addition, Ed and Lorraine’s roles are provided some more depth and centres on their relationship to one another which I felt was a nice touch and gave both Farmiga and Wilson more to play with respectively.\n\nIs it a re-hash?\n\nThis is a tricky one because in many ways it is a bit same-same. Same investigators, Similar poverty stricken family under distress. The shift in location to the UK does disguise this element and because of the question around the genuine haunts that were aimed at the Enfield Haunting, it adds an extra component, but effectively, it doesn’t stray too much from the original notes.\n\nMore of the same but bigger?\n\nWhich is why unfortunately it falls short and three spirits instead of one element makes it exactly that. A bigger premise from the first.\n\nDoes it stand alone as a film?\n\n100% yes. You don’t need to have watched the first film and the elements that are played with are strong enough to establish its own identity. For this, it is a worthy follow up and rightfully exists within the universe.\n\nSCORE: 4/6 It’s a decent effort and a strong film but without the added depth to the Warrens and the introduction of Valak, the film treads a very similar path to its predecessor.\n\nThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It\n\nDoes it identify the ideas, themes and executional elements from The Conjuring?\n\nThis film starts to feel like a different beast, which makes sense when the change of director comes into effect with Michael Chaves taking the helm. While the core ideas and elements are in place especially with the exorcism introduction, its style and execution is different.\n\nDoes it pay homage to the original in the process?\n\nThese ideas are not ignored but play a more secondary role due to the change in approach to the storytelling.\n\nIntroducing new ideas.\n\nThe expansion of the story comes through the further development of the Warren’s relationship, but central to this is Lorraine’s gift of sight into the other world and her connection with another gifted person.\n\nThe main change centres more as an investigation on said exorcism and how powers outside of the mainframe such as the judicial period weighs in on and impacts the perspective of the universe.\n\nIs it a re-hash?\n\nDefinitely not. If anything, I applaud the approach of trying something different with the story direction, even if it does miss a few beats away from the original look and feel in doing so.\n\nMore of the same but bigger?\n\nConjuring 3 feels bold in taking the franchise in a different direction as it steps away from the formula that was set up by the first two movies. It’s both its benefit and detriment.\n\nDoes it stand alone as a film?\n\nIt does stand alone to a degree. Especially as the story holds up through style and substance. What it does well is use the investigation and turns in on itself, questioning the paranormal inquiry process, which feels refreshing and plays with the black and white, the yin and yang of paranormal experiences.\n\nSCORE: 4/6\n\nThis instalment does well to make an identity of its own and for trying something different but in the process takes a lot away from what drew us to the original and what made that movie so good to begin with.\n\nWith the introduction of Annabelle as a spin-off franchise, it generated enough success at the box office for the producers to look at its own trilogy of movies, despite it not being anywhere near as good as The Conjuring. So how does the Annabelle trilogy square up under scrutiny.\n\nAnnabelle: Creation\n\nDoes it identify the ideas, themes and executional elements from Annabelle?\n\nThis is more of a strange one as Annabelle: Creation did one of two things. Firstly, it chose to go to the genesis of Annabelle’s fruition allowing a way to create rules of its own and improve upon the original film. Secondly, It focused on the core elements of what makes a possessed doll so scary, and reinvents the concept.\n\nDoes it pay homage to the original in the process?\n\nIf anything, this film pays homage to the initial component that Annabelle was introduced from The Conjuring film. This feels more in keeping with the Conjuring universe than its predecessor.\n\nIntroducing new ideas.\n\nThe new ideas are discussed above in point 1, and expands on the possession route. It also strands our would-be victims in the middle of nowhere rather than a suburban environment like in the original. This helps to amplify the feeling of helplessness.\n\nMuch like The Conjuring 2, it also adds a few other elements in the mix; a scarecrow, and parents hellbent on doing anything to bring their daughter back to them.\n\nIs it a re-hash?\n\nNo. It feels more like a reinvention and more of a revamp than a rehash.\n\nMore of the same but bigger?\n\nThis is a very different movie and is all the more better for it. David Sandberg does a great job of breathing new life into this franchise, and what’s more does the impossible by making a movie that is better than its predecessor.\n\nDoes it stand alone as a film?\n\n100%. This film adds some great moments that help it stand alone as a movie, injected with humour and new ways to scare the audience.\n\nSCORE: 4/6 Annabelle: Creation marks a bold entry into the universe and reinvents the Annabelle franchise. It was a bold approach but executed really well to become a better movie as a result. Off the top of my head, only Ouija: Origin of Evil has been able to do something similar.\n\nAnnabelle Comes Home\n\nDoes it identify the ideas, themes and executional elements from Annabelle?\n\nAnother interesting element comes into play here as this movie also tries for a different approach, making it about the haunted house / possession mixed with a teen horror component rather than the more adult based horror.\n\nIt also uses both Annabelle and The Conjuring elements together and for that feels like the most balanced movie in the universe.\n\nDoes it pay homage to the original in the process?\n\nTaking the notion that Annabelle: Creation is the main rule setter when it comes to Annabelle, this film definitely does pay homage to that film rather than the original film. But like I have stated. This film blends nicely into the Conjuring universe so pulls a lot from all the movies that have taken place before it.\n\nIntroducing new ideas.\n\nThe teen horror element marks this as a very different film in tone, whilst still in keeping with the Conjuring universe. It nicely plays with the idea of how Annabelle can harbour her power and force this onto weak or vulnerable people. It’s a simple premise but effective in this case.\n\nIs it a re-hash?\n\nYes. But like Creation actually works to its advantage and provides the notion of each film having its own style and identity.\n\nMore of the same but bigger?\n\nWith the change in direction and style comes a film that is part of the universe but provides some of its own rules along the way.\n\nDoes it stand alone as a film?\n\nThis film does stand alone, but also relies on flashbacks of the first film to cement it in the universe. This does prevent it from standing on its own entirely but the vision and narrative is strong enough to allow the film to have an identity of its own.\n\nSCORE: 3/6 Seems a little unfair to mark it down but if we’re playing by the rules of how it relates to the original Annabelle film then it suffers.\n\nIt is a far superior film from the first film though and as part of the Conjuring universe more than holds its own.\n\nSaul Muerte\n\nHow Annabelle and the Conjuring universe is connected to the Manson family murders\n\nMovie review: The Superdeep\n\nPosted by in Movie review\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nshudder australia, superdeep\n\nDon’t be deterred by this Russian flick and it’s admittedly slow start to build up its central protagonist, Russian epidemiologist Anya Federova (Milena Radulovic) from smart but failed scientist out to prove herself into full on action guru.\n\nInspired by the real location of the Kola Superdeep Borehole, (one of Russia’s experiments to bore to the Earth’s core, which at its deepest reaches 12, 262 meters down), Anya gets the opportunity to redeem herself when a supposed viral outbreak has occurred in a Secret underground research facility.\n\nSet in 1984 Russia, The Superdeep evokes the stark and oppressive nature that woke out of The Cold War era.\n\nAs soon as Anya arrives with a squad of soldiers to find out what has happened at the facility and is charged with retrieved with finding some samples of the unknown disease which appears to be infecting all who work at the facility.\n\nThey are greeted by Dr. Grigoriev, the head researcher at the facility but it soon becomes apparent that he has an ulterior motive and refuses to allow them access to to the lowest level of the facility, trapping them on one of the other levels.\n\nIt then becomes a race against time to prevent the spread of the infection from reaching the surface and potentially wiping out all of humanity in the process.\n\nThe Diagnosis:\n\nThere are some nice little elements at play here, especially with the virus that is threatening the characters. It’s essentially a fungal type of entity that infests it’s hosts and shows signs of high functioning intelligence.\n\nThe idea behind this is a worthy one and keeps the audience entertained along with some decent effects to ground the film and support the believability of the film\n\nWhere it does fall down however is in some of the dialogue and action points that slip into predictability all too often.\n\nIt is still entertaining however and Radulovic’s performance and portrayal of Anya is strong enough to keep you invested til the end.\n\n-Saul Muerte\n\nMovie review: Occupation: Rainfall\n\nPosted by in Movie review\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\ndan ewing, daniel gillies, jet tranter, lawrence makoare, luke sparke, Monster Pictures, occupation, occupation:rainfall, Sci-Fi Movies, temeura morrison, umbrella entertainment\n\nSpanning the last five years Director Luke Sparke has hit the ground running, producing, writing, and directing three feature length movies and showcasing that Australia can release high budget, slick looking films.\n\nWhilst you can’t fault Sparke for pushing the visuals and action sequences to the limit, producing some fantastic, fast-paced, frenetic moments with an effective punch, he has come under fire for weak characters and convoluted plotlines that dampen the spectacle.\n\nHis latest venture, (an extension of his pet post-apocalyptic project Occupation series, and first sequel) Occupation: Rainfall, is unfortunately no different.\n\nThe story picks up following the band of Australian survivors after the alien invasion of Earth and throws the audience in the thick of a war, where the allies’ numbers are dwindling.\n\nDan Ewing returns once more as hard headed Matt Simmons, who effectively brings the braun to the piece whilst struggling to collaborate with alien accomplice Gary (Lawrence Makoare) and find a common ground to work on so that they can rise above their obvious differences to defend the alliance. In many ways Sparke is drawing from the buddy cop movies that many action films have drawn from as their central character journey. Some of the shared moments work really well in this instance and are engaging, but too often they are quashed by the need to drive more action into your face rather than pause for breath and build on character. This does however highlight an absence of originality when it comes to story development.\n\nThrough the cloud of combat and explosions there are moments where the supporting cast prove their worth and lift the script above its potential, hiding the notable flaws. Chief among them is Temeura Morrision returning as Peter Bartlett, Daniel Gillies as Wing Commander Hayes who tries to do everything according to the book in order to ensure human survival, and Jet Tranter taking over the role of Amelia Chambers from Stephanie Chambers to provide the heart of the film.\n\nThe Diagnosis:\n\nYes, Director Luke Sparke more than proves his worth of high-budget, slick looking action movies in a system that falls outside of Hollywood here in Australia.\n\nIt’s just a shame that three movies into his credits, Sparke hasn’t managed to get a grasp on his writing. I can see why he is hanging onto his vision through the Occupation series, and he certainly is a visual director, but too often the action sequences smother the characters and plot, which feel secondary as a result.\n\nIf more time were spent on developing some engaging and believable characters along with solidifying the narrative, Sparke would be a force to reckon with in the film industry.\n\nAs it stands though there is some work to be done to finesse what is obviously a creative mind, to harness this vision and strengthen what promises to be a further instalment in this franchise.\n\nSaul Muerte\n\nRetrospective: Docteur Jekyll et les femmes\n\nPosted by in retrospective\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nMarina Pierro, Patrick Magee, Robert Louis Stevenson, The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Udo Kier, Walerian Borowczyk\n\nAnyone familiar with the works of Polish film director Walerian Borowczyk will no doubt identify his craft with his overtly pornographic imagery. Docteur Jekyll et les femmes, is no different to this association and one would be forgiven for misinterpreting this movie for its blatant sexual depiction and depravity of the female form that is on display throughout the narrative. Yet, this is also part of its genius and the reason that it won over many critics and why Borowczyk walked away with the coveted Best Feature Film Director award at the 1981 Sitges Film Festival.\n\nBased on Robert Louis Stevenson’s novella, The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Borowczyk brings the subject material down to its core animalistic roots, namely sex and violence, and how the ‘Mr Hyde’ that remains buried in our inner human traits, can be brought to the surface and inflicted on all those around you, if you are drawn to do so.\n\nThis is Dr Jekyll’s (Udo Kier) secret and one he wishes to harbour from his socialite guests, but like any drug, it is hard to contain, and when the drive becomes greater than the human will, then it will break to the surface and ultimately be the ruin of everyone.\n\nIf anything, the film is a social commentary on the oppression that we inflict on ourselves in order to ‘fit in’ to what is accepted and any such inhibitions should be kept hush hush, only to be carried out behind closed doors. One of Jeckyll’s guests, General Carew (Patrick Magee) has his own sexual fantasies towards his daughter and this becomes the subject of ridicule from Mr Hyde.\n\nThroughout the film, Jekyll is betrothed to Miss Fanny Osborne (Marina Pierro) and appears to be reserved about this engagement. The irony however is that the sexually curious Osborne uncovers his dark secret and rather than being repulsed, is drawn into his carnal sin, immersing herself into the pool of eroticism and accompanies him on this dark and devious journey on the brink of human existence.\n\nIf you are unaware of Borowczyk’s films, then don’t be deterred by what the initial images on display but rather bide your time, as the result is a spotlight on our venereal and lustful acts and how gothic literature can be the perfect subject to bring the taboo to the fore.\n\nSaul Muerte\n\nRetrospective: Lake of Dracula (1971)\n\nPosted by in retrospective\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nJaoanese horror, lake of dracula, Midori Fujita, Mori Kishida, Toho Studios\n\nLake of Dracula epitomises the substance which resides at the kernel of J-Horror with its evocative imagery and atmospheric style. On face value, the film has very little to offer in plot, but poses some interesting characters and has a psychologically eerie feeling throughout.\n\nIn many ways, there are similarities to its namesake in that a vampire arrives on the scene and quickly makes a bride in the supported female character.\n\nWhere it does stray in the storyline is through its central figure, Akiko (Midori Fujita), who was scarred from a chance encounter with the vampire (Mori Kishida) 18 years prior. In the same confrontation, Akiko discovers a dead woman and is unable to shake that image from her mind.\n\nSo when a white coffin turns up from overseas and the body count begins to rise, along with mysterious bite holes in Akiko’s sister, Natsuko’s neck, the nightmares are about to begin again.\n\nIt is down to Akiko and her doctor boyfriend, Takashi Saki (Osahide Takahashi) to confront the evil and put a stop to any further torment that has arisen in their seaside community.\n\nLake of Dracula buries itself in vampirism folklore and rests on this subject to paint and weave its visuals. There is a decent backstory to the vampire that is revealed towards the end of the movie and the inevitable climax, which admittedly is a little low in its delivery, but there is enough here to whet the appetite of the average horror enthusiast, especially for those interested in the historical vault of Japanese horror.\n\nAs part of three vampire films produced by Toho Studios in the 70s, I’m intrigued to watch their other features The Vampire Doll and Evil of Dracula. Another couple for the horror movie bucket list.\n\nSaul Muerte"
