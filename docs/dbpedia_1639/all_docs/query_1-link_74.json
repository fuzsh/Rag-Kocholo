        "text": "The information in English on this page is purely given to provide guidance and assistance to international students as regards the procedures to apply for the scholarships/accommodation offered by DiSCo. In case of doubt or any kind of legal dispute, the legally binding document to which students must refer to is the Italian version of the Call for Applications as published here.\n\nGeneral information\n\nWho can participate?\n\nParticipation is open to students enrolled for any the following courses:\n\na) Ministerial decree no. 509/1999 (post-1999/ “new” system):\n\nThree-year degree;\n\nSecond-cycle specialization degree;\n\nSingle-cycle specialization degree;\n\nPost-graduate school, except for medical students who are the beneficiaries of scholarships, internship contracts or other benefits and remuneration;\n\nb) Ministerial decree no. 270/2004 (post-2004/ “latest” system):\n\nFirst-cycle Bachelor’s Degree;\n\nSecond-cycle Master’s degree;\n\nSingle-cycle Master’s degree;\n\nc) PhD programmes, except for students benefitting from scholarships or any other grants from the University or other Institutions.\n\nAmount of the scholarship\n\nThe maximum amounts of the scholarship are as follows:\n\nEuro 1.981,75 for in-town students;\n\nEuro 2.898,51 for commuter students;\n\nEuro 5.257,74 for out-of-town students.\n\nIncome thresholds\n\nThe income and assets thresholds for the a. y. 2021/2022 are the following:\n\nISEE (Indicator of the Equivalent Economic Situation): € 23.626,32\n\nISPE (Indicator of the Equivalent Assets Situation): € 51.361,58\n\nISEEUP (ISEE Universitario Parificato): € 23.626,32\n\nISPEUP (ISPE Universitario Parificato): € 51.361,58\n\nThe scholarship amount is proportionally reduced, up to being halved, if the ISEE/ISEEUP is higher than two thirds and up to reaching the threshold itself.\n\nShould one of these thresholds be exceeded, the student shall be excluded from all the benefits of this call for applications.\n\nI haven't completed enrollment at the University; can I participate?\n\nParticipation is also open to those awaiting the results of their admission tests or awaiting the qualification required for enrollment.\n\nAny change of course of studies/faculty/university compared to what is stated on the application form shall be notified to the office of reference by opening a ticket on the student’s account.\n\nThe deadline for enrollment is set by the call at February 18, 2022.\n\nI am attending a joint study programme. May I participate?\n\nThe students enrolled in joint study programmes may apply for this call for applications.\n\nThey shall be declared eligible/beneficiary only after their regular enrolment in a Lazio-based university within the 18th February 2022, and the payment of the regional tax have been verified.\n\nWhich scholarships are compatible with the scholarships provided by DiSCo?\n\nGrants provided for the integration of study or research activities abroad, internship grants by the Universities (what is commonly called “150-hour-grant”) as well as other benefits that can be accumulated by law are considered compatible.\n\nFor the purposes of this call, international mobility grants and 150-hour grants must not be declared when the application is filed.\n\nStudents who are awarded another scholarship or grant for housing services, i.e. who are granted free or discounted access to a university residence/campus (e.g. Calls for applications for Dormitories), are classified as “calculated commuters”.\n\nWhich scholarships are incompatible with the scholarships provided by DiSCo?\n\nThe scholarships granted by DiSCo are incompatible with scholarships and/or other benefits aimed at supporting the Right to Education, awarded by other public and private bodies/entities, including those provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Universities (e.g.: Wanted the Best, Don’t Miss Your Chance etc.).\n\nShould a student win another scholarship/benefit, he/she may maintain the benefits provided by DiSCo by opening a ticket and producing the waiver presented to the other institution that granted the incompatible benefit, as well as the documentation certifying the repayment of any amounts already used.\n\nI read the FAQs, but could not find an answer to my problem. How do I contact the offices?\n\nAny communication with the offices shall take place primarily by opening a ticket on the student’s account.\n\nProblems concerning the access to the student’s account can be flagged by sending an email to urp@laziodisco.it.\n\nOpening a ticket is the only way to obtain information on personal situations, in fact, the office for public relations (URP) has no access to the students’ individual positions.\n\nThe only method DiSCo uses to notify the payment issuance dates is the section “Payments/outcomes history” (Storico esiti/pagamenti), in the student’s account.\n\nRequesting the benefits\n\nHow do I file my application?\n\nThe application for the Call for Applications – Right to Education 2021/2022 can exclusively be filed by filling in the online form in the student’s account by July 28, 2021, at 12:00 p.m. CEST.\n\nAccess to the application form follows different procedures, depending on the student type (See the FAQ “How to access the application form”).\n\nThe students who wish to apply for DiSCo’s benefits must fill in the form in all its sections, stating that all the data presented are true under art.76 of the Presidential Decree 445/2000.

Am I also required to log in with SPID?\n\nYes.\n\nI am an international student who was already identified in previous years and has a PIN number. Do I have to register?\n\nRegistration is not required for students in possession of the DiSCo Pin issued in previous years after the release form was sent by registered mail or for students who have already been identified by video call during the academic year 2020/2021.\n\nFilling in and submitting the application\n\nHow do I fill in the form?\n\nLogin to your account according to your student type, and then click on the “Add Request +” button.\n\nThe form is divided into several sections: they must be filled in in sequence.\n\nIt is not possible to move to the next section unless all the required data have been filled in and transmitted first.\n\nThe system indicates in red if the fields are incomplete or contain incorrect data.\n\nI finished filling in all the sections, but I cannot send the application. What can I do?\n\nTry closing the browser, clearing the cache or logging in with a different browser.\n\nIf the problem persists, open a ticket on your account.\n\nIf you do not have access to your account, please notify urp@laziodisco.it.\n\nReports must be received at least three working days before the deadline of the call and must have as subject “Problem accessing my account”.\n\nWhen is the deadline to send my application?\n\nThe deadline for submitting the application is July 28, 2021, at noon (12:00 p.m. CEST). Applications sent after this date will not be accepted.\n\nCan I access the second phase if I have not submitted my application by July 28 at 12:00?\n\nOnly those who have submitted their application by July 28, 2021, at 12:00 p.m. CEST are admitted to the second phase.\n\nWhat is the second phase for?\n\nFrom August 4, 2021 to August 11, 2021, at 12:00 p.m. CEST, it is possible to amend or integrate data already submitted.\n\nPlease note that the deadline for making corrections to the following is 12:00 p.m. CEST on August 11:\n\nYear of course attended,\n\ncredits/exams,\n\nwillingness to pay for accommodation in the municipality where the student studies,\n\nfamily composition and number of family members not living in Italy.\n\nThe correction of any errors or the integration of data must therefore take place, under penalty of exclusion, by August 11, 2021, at 12:00 p.m. CEST.\n\nAny requests for correcting applications relating to the above categories will be rejected if submitted after this date.\n\nDOV – Declaration of value\n\nWhat is the declaration of value (DOV)?\n\nThe “Declaration of value” (DOV) is a document certifying the value of a qualification obtained in an educational system other than the Italian one.\n\nIt is drawn up in Italian and issued by the Italian Diplomatic Representations abroad (Embassies/Consulates) “competent by area”, i.e. those closest to the city in which the institution that issued the foreign qualification is located.\n\nIt generally contains information on\n\nlegal status and type of issuing institution;\n\naccess requirements for the programme resulting in the qualification;\n\nlegal duration of the study programme and/or overall commitment required of the student in terms of credits or hours;\n\nvalue of the qualification in the system/country where it was issued, i.e. for academic and/or professional purposes.\n\nThe declaration of value generally includes at least the following information:\n\nsurname, first name, date and place of birth of the holder\n\ninstitution under whose authority the last qualification was issued\n\ndate of issue of the last qualification obtained\n\neducational institution at which the courses were completed or attended\n\nfield, specialization\n\nduration of the course of study\n\ngrading system\n\nI don’t manage to have the declaration of value issued before the deadline of the call. What should I do?\n\nIn absence of the declaration of value, you can for now simply upload a self-declaration containing the details of the foreign qualification (e.g. legal status and type of issuing institution, legal duration of the study programme and/or credits/hours required to complete the programme, value of the qualification in the issuing country for academic/professional purposes, etc.).\n\nAs long as you attach such a self-declaration you have then time to provide the actual declaration of value – as released by the Italian embassy/consulate – by latest February 18, 2022, via the ticket system.\n\nI don’t have a declaration of value. Can I use the certificate of comparability issued by CIMEA instead?\n\nYes. You may provide a certificate issued by ENIC-NARIC centres (such as CIMEA) that contain all the information usually listed in the declaration of value and required for the evaluation of the qualification.\n\nStudent classification\n\nWhat is a “calculated commuter”?\n\nThe status of “Calculated commuter” is ascribed to students who, despite meeting the requirements for “out-of-town” students, do not produce by November 30, 2021, a 10-month or longer rental contract for an accommodation in the Municipality in which the university course is held.\n\nStudents who, while having signed a rental agreement of a minimum of 10 months, receive economic contributions/subsidies from public or private bodies to cover the accommodation costs for the same academic year are also considered “Calculated commuters”.\n\nWhat is an out-of-town student?\n\n“Out-of-town students” are students who reside in Regions other than Lazio, or in the municipalities listed in Annex C hereunder, or who live over 50 kilometres from the municipality in which the university course is taught, who sign a rental contract, against payment, for a minimum of ten months between October 1, 2020, and September 31, 2021.\n\nIn the event of the persistence of the emergency measures adopted following the Covid-19 pandemic, for students using distance learning, the Administration reserves the right to redefine their status by classifying them in the “in-town-students” category.\n\nI am eligible to be considered an out-of-town student and I am the recipient of a grant to cover the costs I will incur for rent. Will this affect my classification?\n\nStudents who have been awarded a housing service subsidy or who have free or reduced-rate access to a university residence/campus (e.g. Calls for Applications for Residential Accommodation) will automatically be granted the status of “Calculated commuters”.\n\nWhat is an independent student?\n\nFor an Italian or international student to be considered independent, all the following requirements must apply:\n\nindependent residence from the family of origin for at least two years prior to the application date in an accommodation not owned by any family members;\n\nan income of at least € 6500 per year in the two years prior to the application. Such an income must derive either from a regular employment contract or similarly have been declared for tax purposes.\n\nShould these requirements not apply, the student must integrate his/her income with that of his/her family of origin via the CAF (Tax Advisory Centre) or the INPS portal, by no later than December 31, 2021, under penalty of exclusion from the benefits.\n\nHow to fill in the section “Enrollment” (Iscrizione)\n\nI am still waiting for the admission test results, and I am not yet sure which faculty I should enroll in. How do I fill in the form?\n\nChoose the course you are most likely to enroll in. You can communicate changes of course, faculty and university by opening a ticket on your account.\n\nI applied as a freshman for a second-cycle degree but unfortunately I was unable to graduate. Have I lost my scholarship?\n\nNo, you can communicate your enrollment in the first year beyond the legal duration of the programme by opening a ticket on your account.\n\nI cannot find my course of study. What can I do?\n\nA discrepancy between the course name indicated and that of the course actually attended does not affect the award of the scholarship.\n\nIf you cannot find your course, please select the “Other” option, giving priority to the course type (three-year, single-cycle, or master’s degree, etc.).\n\nWhich year should I enter in the field 'course year'?\n\nThe call for applications refers to the academic year 2021/2022: therefore, the course year to be inserted is the one you will attend in the academic year 2021/2022.\n\nFor the purpose of meeting the merit-based requirement, can I count credits from internship hours that I have not yet taken the examination for?\n\nYes. Please note that if you declare internship credits, you must attach the relevant documentation, even if provisional, by August 11th at 12.\n\nThe University credits deriving from internship activities will be valid to attain the merit-based requirement only if you pass the final exam by October 31st 2021, unless this is impossible for reasons attributable to the University.\n\nIn this case, the practical internship examination must be taken and passed by the first available exam session.\n\nWhere should I put the University credits derived from qualifying examinations (idoneità)?\n\nThe University credits derived from the qualifying examinations (idoneità) should exclusively be placed in the “Total sum of credits” field.\n\nI cannot recall how many bonus points I have; how can I know?\n\nIf your credits are insufficient, and you need a bonus, apply for it when filling out the application form. If you still have some, the system will automatically award you the necessary bonus points.\n\nChange of programme/transfer and withdrawal from the studies\n\nThis year I changed course/faculty/university, can I participate again?\n\nUnless a formal waiver of studies has been submitted, the merit-based requirement is determined by taking into account the years of enrollment for the degree course prior to the transfer.\n\nIn case of changing the degree programme or transfer to another university, the course year must be consistent with the year of first enrollment and is calculated including the years of enrollment in the degree programme prior to the change/transfer.\n\nIn order to re-enroll as a first-year student, it is necessary to formally withdraw from the studies and return any amount relating to scholarships/services already used, even if provided by other regions.\n\nI have withdrawn from my studies. Can I enroll to a first year?\n\nYes, provided that:\n\nthe university has not recognized any credits or exams obtained in the previous academic courses;\n\nany money received as a scholarship in the years before the withdrawal have been returned (even if provided by other bodies).\n\nPlease note that in order to participate again in the call for applications for the right to education as a first-year student, you must have repaid, in a single instalment and prior to participation in the competitions, any amounts received during the period in question or relating to the cost of any services used.\n\nStudents who have received benefits from a different body for the right to education must produce evidence, by means of appropriate documentation (bank transfer receipt), that any amount received in the withdrawal period has been returned.\n\nI have a three-year degree and I would like to enrol in a single-cycle degree course. Can I participate?\n\nYes.
