        "text": "Karaoke is a wonderful way to bring together people with a shared love of music, whether they can sing well or not. If you want to have the best home karaoke experience, we recommend Tonor’s K20 Wireless Karaoke Machine because it’ll make you look and sound good, no matter what tune you choose.\n\nThe Tonor K20 Wireless Karaoke Machine covers all the bases (basses?) for a successful home karaoke celebration, including a tablet holder, adapter cables, and plenty of other thoughtful accessories. It also has the best-sounding wireless microphones of all the karaoke machines we tested, with a wireless range of around 100 feet in case your performance just can’t be contained. With a built-in LED light show and a disco ball on top, the Tonor can transform any room into a concert hall, inspiring even the shyest singers to take a crack at their favorite tune. Like all of the karaoke machines we recommend, the Tonor doesn’t come with its own library of songs, so you’ll need a Wi-Fi connection and a screen to access YouTube (or some other service) for your music and lyrics. But the Tonor stands out because it offers all the audio connections you’re likely to need, including Bluetooth and an auxiliary-audio input jack (with an included cable). You can even play music from a USB flash drive or microSD card. However, the speaker sounds better at louder volumes, which could be overkill for some users (or their neighbors). As an added bonus, the Tonor has a built-in audio-recording feature, so you can capture your performance to share with friends, or listen to yourself later and work on perfecting your pitch.\n\nThe Moukey MTs10-2 Karaoke Machine has a better-sounding speaker than our top pick, especially at lower volumes. The basic controls are slightly easier to use, as well, even if some of its bonus features can be confusing. The wireless microphones sound and feel a little cheaper, too—although the machine does come with a convenient pair of mic holders built into the side. Like the Tonor, the Moukey can stream songs over Bluetooth or via an aux-in port, USB drive, or microSD card, and it displays a dynamic LED light show to fuel your onstage fantasies. It doesn’t have a disco ball, however, which is more of a downer than we expected, and the speaker itself, which the company says is meant to resemble an owl, actually looks more like a glowering audience member. That might give you the inspiration you need to really rock your next song, though.\n\nIf you don’t care as much about audio quality and just want to have some fun, the Singsation Star Burst SPKA25 is a great choice. It’s small enough to carry around in one hand—which you might need to do, because it has two wired microphones with cables that are only about 6 feet long. Like the Tonor K20, though, it has a disco ball on top, along with a variety of LED patterns that you can display on the speaker itself. The Singsation also comes with a variety of pitch-shifting options (think Alvin and the Chipmunks), plus some fun sound effects that let you inject air horns and applause and other embellishments into your karaoke performances. That said, the mics and the speaker sound fine but not great, and this is the only all-in-one karaoke machine we tested that doesn’t have a rechargeable battery built in (it needs eight AA batteries to free it from the DC wall adapter). But if you’re looking for a simple speaker with a light show that lets you amplify your voice to sing along, the Singsation is an affordable source of entertainment."
