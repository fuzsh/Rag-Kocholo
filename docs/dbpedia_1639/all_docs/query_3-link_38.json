        "text": "What part of New York are you from?\n\nIâm from Brooklyn, originally.\n\nHow did you get into records?\n\nFrom going out dancing. At a very young age, I met someone in high school and they took me to the Village, to the first club I ever went to, which was called the Firehouse. Immediately, I really dug the music.\n\nHow old were you when you went there?\n\n15.\n\nWhat year was that?\n\nDo we have to discuss that? [laughs] It was 1970, and about a year later, my brotherâs girlfriend... I was dancing around with her, and she said. âIf you really like dancing youâve got to come to the Loft.â She took me [there] and that was it. I was hooked on the whole experience.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you went in there?\n\nIt was real crowded. Well, the first time I went there, it wasnât packed like other times. First of all, Iâm not talking about Prince Street, Iâm talking about Broadway [David Mancusoâs home, and the partyâs original venue]. The Loft was only 2,000 square feet, with 500 square feet of DJ boothâ¦ It was tiny.\n\nFirst of all, the Klipschorn speakers, [Mancuso] put them in a way that they covered the whole area and exaggerated the sound. His room was perfect to do this with. He used to be on the dancefloor, and the lights would go out, there would be these little lamps in the corner and the tweeters would come on and the lamps would go out. It was freaky-deaky. I donât know whether I was on acidâ¦\n\nHow did you go from being a dancer to playing records?\n\nI wanted to play records more than anything else in the world. I mean, I was possessed by it. Iâd go home. I had a little hi-fi and a stereo, and I would mix records back and forth between these two separate units. All I could think of was recordsâ¦ I remember I heard âRainâ by Dorothy Morrison, I could not get it out of my head until I could get it in my hand. Not many record stores had it. I just searched and searched and searched until I found it.\n\nI met this girl in high school [called Robin Long]. I knew I was gay from a very young age â I was going out with men â then I met her and started going out together. So anywayâ¦ She convinced this club owner to let me play records. [The place] was called the Round Table, 51st and 3rd Avenue.\n\nSo, you started collecting records when you were in high school?\n\nYeah, I used to drag my girlfriend around the city looking for them, but there was really only one record store that was carrying these records.\n\nDownstairs?\n\nNo!\n\nColony?\n\nColony.\n\nWhat kind of stuff were you playing at Round Table?\n\nI guess stuff like âLittle Bit of Loveâ by Brenda & the Tabulations, War âCity Country City,â âGirl You Need A Change Of Mindâ [by Eddie Kendricks].\n\nWhat music did you play, what crowd did you have, what was the atmosphere like?\n\nUnlike a lot of clubs, the Gallery was a place to dance. Although people met there and went home with each other and stuff like that, thatâs not why people came there. People came there to dance. They usually came with friends, and if you met someone there it was a bonus, but it was about the dancefloor and the music.\n\nAnd you modeled it very much on the Loft?\n\nYes, but, you know whatâ¦ Davidâs place was his house, and you canât ever recreate that in a club. Ours was like a club version of Davidâsâ¦ a more commercial kind of version. That feeling, that atmosphere was there. The caring about people and stuff like that. The only thing was that we didnât live there, so itâs a little different. I always feel like I took what David did onto a more commercial level, and I had more of an influence commercially than David had. David [was more] underground. I mean, when I played a record, it was played everywhere. When David played a record, someone heard about it, and then if they played it, it wasâ\n\nIt was much more subversive.\n\nIt was more underground and it remained that way, although he had a tremendous influence on a lot of people, including myself.\n\nWhere was the Gallery?\n\nOriginally on 22nd Street. Then, 18 months later, we got closed down for improper fire exits. So did, like, seven other clubs, because right after the Gallery opened, then 10th Floor opened, and all these other kind of loft clubs. Everyone had the idea at the same time, I think we just did it before people.\n\nSo, it was in a loft?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat was the layout?\n\nIt was bigger than Davidâs. Davidâs was 2,000 square feet, we were 3,600. And what we did was â I actually have a lot of slides â it had pillars down the center, and there were three huge Altec âVoice of the Theatreâ speakers, in what used to be windows, but which werenât windows any more, because it was built against the building next door. They fit perfectly, and we got all this reflected sound from them, but then I wanted to build a wall around the dancefloor, which I did. Then I put a speaker in each corner â I bought another one of them. Then I bought bass horns, and then I bought tweeter arrays. David was the first person to have those bullets. I was the second person.\n\nAnd you were working with Alex Rosner?\n\nRight.\n\nHeâs like Mr. Experiment, isnât he?\n\nAlex? To me Alex was the greatest soundman. Dick Long was a great soundman but I still think Alex was better, and Iâll tell you why. Dick took it and made a certain club sound that still exists today. I donât like that sound. Itâs not what musicians hear when they record the record. Itâs not true sound. Itâs over-enhanced. Especially the low end. Iâm not talking about, âDonât give them low end,â but the way theyâre doing it, the way those speakers are built, they are built against the laws of physics for sound.\n\nKlipschorn â when they build a speaker, they follow the laws of physicsâ¦ Dickâs bass horns did not. He wanted to build his own, and he took their design, but he had to change it a little bit because it would be infringement of copyright. What he came up with doesnât follow the physical path of the soundâ¦ Itâs skewed in some wayâ¦ Alex built soundsystems that were based on true sound, on what you hear in a recording studio, on how a record is meant to sound. To this day, I think Alex was the best sound man.\n\nWhat did the Gallery look like?\n\nThe original Gallery had low ceilings, but when we moved, the ceilings were almost three stories high. We had a balcony overlooking the dancefloor, so we built the lighting on a big structure that hung from the ceiling, so if you looked at the lighting it looked as if it was going up into the ceiling. Steve Rubell [from Studio 54] used to come and stare at the lighting all night longâ¦ I swear thatâs how he got the idea for Studio.\n\nHow long did it run for?\n\nUntil 1977.\n\nAnd you were there the whole time?\n\nYeah, I partially owned it. The beginning of â78, our lease renewal came up and [my brother] said, âYou know, you are totally strung out on drugsâ â which I was â âyouâre killing yourself, and I canât watch this. Are you gonna clean up, or are we going to close the club?â I was an arrogant little drug addict, I just said: âClose it! I donât give a shit.â And he did. Then I went over to [a club called] Buttermilk Bottom for a year, and I went to Europe, and when I came back I had lost my followingâ¦ Then again, I was still on drugs and still all fucked up. Things that were going on in my life... My inner was reflected in my outer being. Iâm drawing a bigger crowd 20 years later than I drew back then!\n\nWhat were the great nights at gallery?\n\nI think great is an understatement for nights at the Gallery. I think extraordinaryâ¦ People got really out of control. I mean, there are points when the music was taking people so far out and getting so peaked that, collectively, people [would chant] âTURN THIS MOTHERFUCKER OUT.â That started at the Galleryâ¦ Can you imagine 700 people doing that? There were like 400 other people in the club, but 700 people on the dancefloor doing that and dancing together, blowing whistles, and screamingâ¦ Then [Iâd] turn the bass horns up and the lights would flash and go out, and everyone would scream so loud you couldnât hear the music for a second â and it was a fantastic soundsystem. [People] would be dancing so hard that if you went downstairs you would see the wood floor moving.\n\nWhat was the record you would be playing to do that?\n\nWell âLove Is The Message,â which was really my theme song. I discovered that. It was long associated with Larry [Levan], but itâs my record. Larry wasnât even playing records when I started playing itâ¦ David and Michael [Cap[ello] had been the first ones with âTSOP,â and then I turned the record over and fell in love with âLove Is The Message.â\n\nWhat were the other great Gallery Songs?\n\nI remember the songs I played the [opening night of the second Gallery]: âWhat Can I Do for You?â by Labelle was really, really bigâ¦ Dirty Old Manâ by the Three Degreesâ¦ Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes âThe Love I Lost,â âBrotherâs Gonna Work It Outâ by Willie Hutch.\n\nSo, you were into the Philly sound?\n\nI loved the Philly sound, but then everyone did. They made great records. Early Trammps: âLove Epidemic,â âZing Went the Strings of My Heart.â You were talking about what I was playing at Round Table â that was what I was playingâ¦ Then, after that, at the old Gallery, O.C. Smithâs âLa La Peace Song,â [Ultra High Frequency] âWeâre On The Right Trackâ, Doobie Brothers âListen To The Music,â âLong Train Running,â âHow Can I Forgetâ by the Realisticsâ¦ These were Round Table records: âRainâ By Dorothy Morrison and âI Got Itâ by Gloria Spencer, [Little Sister] âYouâre The One.â\n\nWhat equipment did you have?\n\nOh, I had the best. I had a Bozak mixer, I had [Thorens] TD125 turntables, which still to this day I prefer. They donât give feedback.\n\nDo they have pitch control?\n\nYeah. Very slight â maybe 2 or 3% in each direction, which is all you need. You donât need to bend a record 8%. Who the fuck are you to bend the record 8%? I see DJs doing this and I think, âYouâre an asshole. This is not how the person who recorded this record meant it to be, andâ¦ I mean, you just donât.â\n\nWhen I learned to play records, you werenât to fuck with a record beyond a certain point. If you want to enhance the sound, I did a lot of that, but I brought out the breaks, which is something that people wanted. The breaks were meant to be brought out. I donât knowâ¦ This [does some rapid EQing moves]â¦ this is bullshit. It does nothing for me, except hurt my ears sometimes, because it gets too loud.\n\nWhat would you do with a record?\n\nWell, this whole third turntable thingâ¦ I had a dream one night, I had a dream that I was playing âGirl You Need a Change of Mind,â and then I brought in âLove Is The Message.â I used to have this plane sound effect that I would play on âLove Is The Messageâ â this jet plane that was blaring. I had a dream that I was playing the jet plane while I was mixing the record, like it was all happening together. So, I brought in my turntable from my house, and I hooked it up. That was the kind of thing no one else was doing. I had vision, I had creativity. Thereâs creativity about the music, and then thereâs creativity in the big picture. You know, noticing the lighting, noticing the decorations, noticing the way the sound sounds, then taking the music beyond what it is, and making it something better.\n\nDid you use two copies of the same record to do your own mixes?\n\nWell, actually, that idea, Richie Kaczor was playing at [a club called] Hollywood, and he did this thing one night with âGirl You Need A Change Of Mind.â He offset two copies, and it was going, âGirl you need a changeâ¦ girl you need a changeâ [singing, as if in rounds]. It was in perfect time and perfect sync, but it was wild. It was just fabulous, just incredible. But one of the things I would always do was, if there was a break on a record, I would extend it back and forth, play the break back and forth over and over. Or if the beginning was hot, I would play the beginning over and over, and then bring in the song.\n\nBecause the records were much shorter then.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhen did people start doing that?\n\nI think it was happening for a whileâ¦ David didnât do it at The Loft, but Michael Cappello did it a lot. He was the alternate at the Sanctuary [before moving on to the Limelight]. Francis [Grasso] was the main person.\n\nFrancis used to do things like that. He was probably the first.\n\nHe was probably the first. I donât know what happened with Francisâs career.\n\nSo, the Galleryâ¦ Was the crowd drawn from people you knew?\n\nDo you know Stephen Burrows?\n\nNo.\n\nOK. Stephen Burrows had won a Coty that year [1973]â¦ He was a fashion designerâ¦ Willi Smith â very famous fashion designerâ¦ Calvin Kleinâ¦ I mean, these were people who came when they werenât really big. At one point Mick Jagger and David Bowie were there one nightâ¦ Patti Labelle.\n\nBut it wasnât a club that was about celebrityâ¦\n\nRight. They were looking for a really hot spot to dance, and people said, âGo to the Gallery.â\n\nIt was focused on the dancing. It wasnât a pick-up place.\n\nHave you been to Body & Soul?\n\nYeahâ¦\n\nVery similar to that â the emphasis was on the dance. Body & Soul times 100, then youâd have the Gallery. I mean at the fiercest point at Body & Soul â with the screaming and yelling â on the dancefloor, times that by 100, and you could equal the Gallery.\n\nA lot of people got their start at Gallery. Frankie Knuckles and Larry Levan were working there. How did you meet them?\n\nThey just came there, and Robin came to me and said, âThis guy Frankie wants to work for us.â I said, âThere are 600 people here, and we donât have anyone working for us â maybe itâs a good idea.â Then Frankie came to me one week and said, âI know this kid â heâs a little crazy but heâs very talented. Could I bring him over?â I said, âSure,â and that was Larry.\n\nFrankie went off, and we are still good friends today, but I was very close with Larry. We lived together, we were lovers for a whileâ¦ He did the decorations and he worked the lights for a while, and we would go on [the turntables on] the off nights and play some records. I would tell him what David Rodriguez taught me: Donât cut off the lyrics on a song; try to make the tempo match.\n\nBack then, and I still think so to this day, I think the selection is more important than the mix. I donât know where all these people think every record has to match. I think that is the most retarded thing Iâve heard of. I would just end a record, put on some special effect and start a new record. Thatâs the only way youâre gonna create a night that moves. Otherwise youâre gonna justâ¦ âPlateau DJs,â thatâs what I call them. [In a monotone:] âAll the records just match exactly and theyâre all the fucking same.â Who cares about that?\n\nDanny Krivit said that your style was very much about the vocals. It was very much a vocal narrative that you wove.\n\nWell, one night I played [recently], my last songs were âI Want to Thank You,â âMighty Loveâ [by the Spinners] and [The Trammps] âLove Epidemic.â\n\nSo, itâs the meaning of the lyrics.\n\nItâs talking to the people through the lyrics, yeah. When I was playing âMighty Love,â people were on the dancefloor, looking into each otherâs eyes and singing the words. It was incredible. It was a real momentâ¦ Sometimes Iâm really aware of the intent, and sometimes Iâm in an altered state and just picking things out that are moving meâ¦ For a while, I was like, âI love this shit, I love it,â and now Iâm more conscious of it [as something thatâs coming through, rather than me than me consciously doing it]. When I step out of the way and let it come through me, itâs the most powerful experience. Unbelievable.\n\nWhat do you think it is?\n\nLove. Which is the same as saying âGodâ or âspirit.â And Iâm not talking about religion, because religion has totally fucked up this concept. I think just like the 100th monkey storyâ¦\n\nThe love in the roomâ¦\n\nRight! There is a force that connects us. And if I connect with that force, which I think is love, if I connect with that force and Iâm playing from that center, weâre all gonna get it, weâre all gonna get off on it.\n\nThatâs very much what David [Mancuso] said. Heâs very much against the ego, and the best nights were when he didnât know where his hand was picking the records. It was the joy in the room. Do you think that was a feeling that was articulated?\n\nWell, what is ego? Ego is the opposite of love. If God is a reality, say thereâs a force, that we could call God â letâs call it love for now, or spirit. Letâs not even use the word âGod.â Letâs use the word âspiritâ for now, and thatâs love. Ego is the exact opposite of that, because ego connects you with everything that love isnât. Which is like the body, the physical senses. You want to go beyond that.\n\nOne of the biggest compliments I ever had was from a friend who sprained his ankle on the dancefloor, and he came to me afterwards and he said, âI just hurt my ankle, itâs killing me, I was dancing so hard I forgot I was in a body.â So the music was moving him to the point where he was connecting with the spirit, and forgot he was in a body â thatâs what music can do.\n\nI was just listening to that song [âFreeâ by Ultra Nate]â¦ I mean, that just sends me out there, it connects with something, and certainly the public proved that, because that is one of the best-selling records, without any radio play, that happened in that last two years.\n\nWere these feelings articulated at the time, or was it just something that was in the air?\n\nNo. It wasnât articulated. I donât think we understood what we were tapping into. See, thatâs the circle of things. I mean, thatâs part of me coming back: I did all this work on myself, spiritually. And I really understand â not understand â I really know that thereâs something beyond just me at work, and that itâs more a point of service.\n\nI think David was always aware of itâ¦\n\nA lot of people have spoken about this. A lot of DJs have felt that itâs about more than just them and the music and the people â that itâs more of a holistic thingâ¦ I think drugs enhance it.\n\nItâs enhanced by drugs, but you donât need them. And at this point in time, in the evolutionary scope of things, Iâm telling you that that experience can be stronger in the right environment, with the right music, than with drugs. The drugs are gonna muffle that experience, not enhance it.\n\nBut, at the time of the Gallery, there must have been a lot of drugs around.\n\nNaaaaaaah! [laughs]\n\nWhat were people doing back then? Acid?\n\n[Nods].\n\nWhy do you think Larry Levanâs myth grew so potent?\n\nDo you want me to say the politically correct thing?\n\nNo I want you to say the truth. He was very much your protÃ©gÃ©, wasnât he?\n\nThatâs itâ¦ You said it. I didnât.\n\nAfter it all imploded.\n\nRight. And Studio wasnât like that, it was bright, it was white, in the beginning. In the first year. The lighting wasâ¦ You could have been outside in the sun. It was bright light in there. It wasnât dark, it wasnât dingy. And the guns went off, and youâd collect confetti â youâd be able to put your hand on the floor and pick up an inch worth of confetti and glitter, and everybody had glitter all over their hair, and itâd be sticking to peopleâs skin. It was really incredible, but he changed and the club changed.\n\nAll these things on Studio 54 recently, and not one of them has talked about the DJs. Never mentioned Richie Kaczor. I only played there for the three or four months, but I was strung out on heroin and I was only playing during the week. Richie took it over at weekends, and Richie was a fabulous DJ. âI Will Surviveâ? He discovered that record. He made a hit out of it. He was incredible. I would go to Hollywood every single night while he was there, and this was while the Gallery was open, and Iâd hear a lot of things there. One of the reasons Studio happened was because he was so incredible and they never even mention him. If I played somewhere after Gallery closed, I would get 700 people there. I had a following. And itâs the same today with Junior [Vasquez] and Danny Tenaglia. People follow them because they like their style of music. But, you know what, now theyâre getting a lot more credit than we got back then. We were paid shit. We were exploited and kicked to the curb.\n\nYou had fun there, right?\n\nI had a ball, but I only played the first four or five months.\n\nYou played the second night and from there you had a regular gig?\n\nI played the second night, and then I played Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday. Then they had me there for special parties, like Bianca [Jagger]âs party, and stuff like that. I was using a lot of drugs, but also my style of playing was not straightforward. Richie played very straightforward. Everything matched, and although he built nights, a record never ended [before] another started. It was very, very seamless, because thatâs what they wanted.\n\nThe emphasis wasnât on the music. They didnât want it to impose.\n\nThatâs right. They took the emphasis off the music, and thatâs, I think, where it went wrong. Also, in 1980 people were screaming, âDisco sucks, kill disco,â and everything. That was the end of Studioâ¦ That was the third year.\n\nStudio 54 epitomized everything [those people] didnât like about disco.\n\nIt just made everything so commercial.\n\nWas there a sense that the party was over, with the âDisco Sucksâ thing and Saturday Night Fever coming out? Everyone hates Studio, because they canât get inâ¦\n\nThe party was overâ¦ I mean, in the beginning there was no word âdisco.â If you were going to Davidâs you were going to the party, if you were going to Tamburlaine or Limelight you weâre going to the club. You were going out dancing, you werenât going to a disco. I hate that word, to this day.\n\nI think coining that phrase, Billboard starting the charts and Studio opening brought what was an underground, kind of incredible party into the mainstream, made it big business, and basically ruined it. Itâs like anything you commercialize. Itâs like, how far can you take it? One of the great things that Francois [Kevorkian] decided was an interview blackout for Body & Soul recently. I think his idea is that the club is more popular than he wants it right now.\n\nHeâs scared of it getting out of hand. So, what did people do in 1980/1981? Did they just stop going out, because they felt it wasnât happening any more?\n\nA lot of people did. I donât even think there were as many clubs then as there are now. There was like one club to go for the white crowd, one club to go for the black crowd.\n\nIt was very segregated?\n\nOh, it was. Much more segregated than it is now.\n\nAnd gay and straight, as well?\n\nNo, there was never a big straight club scene. Never. Even now. People go to straight clubs to pick up. Itâs not about dancing.\n\nAnd I guess the sad thing was that the party was over and then people started dying.\n\nThe reality of HIV. Thatâs right. People didnât have time to go out dancing. People were very concerned with taking care of their friends.\n\nWas it something that suddenly came into view?\n\nAll within about two years. It was like, âOh, my God.â\n\n[Break to look at photographs]\n\nThis is David Rodriguezâ¦\n\nHe played at a place called Ginza?\n\nAnd then at the Limelight. He also played at a couple of other clubs.\n\nHow did he play?\n\nHonestly, his music didnât move me to craziness, but he is the person who influenced me most. He was the person who came into my booth and said, âDonât cut off the words, blend it here, blah, blah, blah.â He really stayed with me a lot, and he was just a wonderful friend. He really helped me launch my career.\n\nHe liked discovering records, but not breaking them, because he would discover so many of them he would never concentrate on any one thing. He probably discovered more records than anyone else. He was out there looking for new records all the time, and would turn other people onto them, but of the five that he discovered that week, two would be really good.\n\nHe would turn us on to the same five, and Michael [Cappello] and I would look at each other, and weâd both pick the same two, play them over and over, and really get the crowd going. [At Davidâs] night, he would play all five, so he sort of he never really left an impression on you â but really he took more risks in playing new music than anyone else back then. He really did. He was a real innovator.\n\n[Looking at more photographs]\n\nHereâs Michael [Gomes], looking up to the boothâ¦\n\nDid he DJ?\n\nNo. He was a promotions man. He first wrote this magazine called Mixmaster for a while which was very popular with the underground crowd. He donated his Mixmaster newssheets to the [New York Public Library for the Performing Arts], and they donât even know where they fucking are! You know, if he donated them today, they wouldâve had a party to celebrate it. But then, disco was a dirty word.\n\nIs David Rodriguez still alive?\n\nNo. He died. He was one of the first people who died of AIDSâ¦\n\n[Picking out another photograph]\n\nThereâs Larryâ¦ This is when they were flying me back and forth. I would finish playing at the Gallery at 8 AM, and then Iâd jump on a seaplane and run out to Fire Island and play there. This was on the ferry to Fire Island. It was really magical.\n\nDid that lead to more remixing and production?\n\nWell, they picked up our option on Sire. I was sick from drugs, so I went to California to recover. Meanwhile theyâre waiting for the next record, and I was like, âWhat record?â I was not feeling well: âLeave me alone.â Then, a couple of years passed and I got clean, and thatâs when I started doing one record after another. Thatâs when I did [Sofonda C.] âPick It Upâ and all those other records. Felixâs [Siano and Arthur Russell] âTiger Stripes,â that was another record of mine â one of my bombs â on Sleeping Bag, when they first started.\n\nBut, Iâll tell you who is one of the most loving, sweet people â Frankie.\n\nFrankie Knuckles?\n\nYeah. Iâm not talking about talent or anything like that. If we as people put out a good energy and see a good energy come back to us, Frankie is a perfect example of that. He just puts out a really good energy. I would like to be more like him. Not as far as mixing or anything like that, but just how loving and relaxed he is about the whole thing, and grateful to be where heâs at.\n\nWas he inspired to DJ by the Gallery? What was he doing for you?\n\nHe was working on balloons. He never really played, like Larry used to bug me to. Larry never played when the club was open. He only played when the club was closed, but one thing he did do was he used my connections to build his record collection. Then when he got the opportunity to play at the Continental Baths, he had a record collection.\n\nWas Frankie learning the tricks of the trade at the same time?\n\nYeah, and then he moved to Chicago.\n\nBut he was DJing for a while at the Continental Baths too, wasnât he?\n\nYes, but I never really went there to see him. I heard Larry there.\n\nWhat was that place like?\n\nIt was very upscale. It was like, âWeâre so chi-chi in our towels, cruising each other and slapping each otherâs dicks.â It was like a kind of orgy.\n\nKind of Roman.\n\nYes. You had to go down the corridor and then back. And then people came out in their towels, and everyone would dance.\n\nSo, the music was important. It wasnât just a side thing?\n\nNo, not on Friday and Saturday night. It was the focus. A lot of people came there just to dance. Women were allowed in the club at weekends, but they werenât allowed in the other areas.\n\nBut my best memories are of [building] the first Gallery. Weâd go in there and weâd paint, it would be like creating the whole place â laying down the tiles for the floor, we put the dancefloor in ourselves. It was our place, we made it all work. It was a really special.\n\nThis is an edited version of two interviews conducted in late 1998 and early 1999. Â© DJhistory.com"
