We've played 'Your Song' at a few lunchtime acoustic sets that we occasionally do when we're on tour, and we've recorded a version of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road for an album produced by David Kosten. We also attempted / murdered 'Paperback Writer' at our first few gigs (four part harmony included).\" - thebeatsurrender.co.uk - Source\n\n'We're all big fans of Rufus Wrainwright and his songs are great fun to play in soundchecks. We play a lot of Elton John in soundchecks. Things like \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\". We're always playing things that we were into when we started off. Radiohead stuff. My piano has a tremolo switch on and it's the piano they used on \"Planet Telex\", so we pretend we're Radiohead for a couple of minutes. We like to play Smiths songs. Probably just so Tom can strut up and down the stage pretending to be Morrissey.' - warchildmusic.com - Source\n\n'we used to do a terrible version of a fatboy slim tune whose name escapes me.' [Praise You] - Source\n\nPerformances of Keane songs by other artists\n\nTravis - After Mark And Lard Go (based on Somewhere Only We Know)\n\nNatasha Bedingfield - Somewhere Only We Know (performed on Jo Whiley's Radio 1 show on 4th February 2005).\n\nLaura Michelle Kelly - Somewhere Only We Know\n\nVittorio Grigolo - Bedshaped - lyrics are in Italian.\n\nLifehouse - Somewhere Only We Know\n\nPickin' on Keane: A Bluegrass Tribute - a surprisingly good cover of Hopes and Fears\n\nKeane fans from the messageboard have also recorded a cover version of the debut album - \"Soaps and Beers\". You can download it from http://covers.keane.at - please make a donation to charity!\n\nLily Allen - Everybody's Changing (originally on Dermot O'Leary's 30th September 2006 Radio 2 show, later recorded and released).\n\nOther songs\n\nThe following songs are Keane demos that are floating around the internet. They're different to anything released (featured elsewhere on this site)\n\nAllemande (full band)\n\nEmily\n\nMaps\n\nMore Matey\n\nNew One\n\nSomewhere Only We Know\n\nThe Happy Soldier\n\nTo The End Of The Earth (guitar version)\n\n\"I'm inclined to think that if people are looking for those tracks then they are probably already interested in the band anyway,\" says Tom.\n\n\"They most likely see those recordings as an interesting extra to get hold of - I don't see it causing any damage. If it was the album we have coming out leaked early then I'd probably feel differently,\" he adds. Source\n\nThe following are unreleased songs (between 1996 and 2006), of which no recordings have been released into the general public.
