        "text": "Money makes the world go around. Sometimes it also makes the turntables spin. It may be the root of all evil, but moneyâ€™s a hell of a muse â€“ as this list of the best songs about money proves.\n\nLike the power of love and the pain of a broken heart, cash â€“ too much of it or too little â€“ has inspired some of the best pop songs of all time, from classic-rock standards to 99 percent of â€™90s hip-hop. With dollar signs in our eyes, weâ€™ve rounded up 23 of the best songs about money. Time to make it rain.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\nðŸŽ‰ The best party songs ever madeðŸŽ¤ The best karaoke songs\n\nðŸŽ§ The best podcasts right now ðŸŽµ The best new songs of the last year\n\nWritten by Nick Levine, Andy Kryza, Grace Goslin, James Manning and Ella Doyle.\n\n1. â€˜Mo Money Mo Problemsâ€™ by the Notorious B.I.G.\n\nBiggie Smalls spent his career marveling at the wealth wrought by his hustle â€“ the man had a Super Nintendo and a Sega Genesis â€“ but in this mega-hit from his last album, the rapper was a bit more reflective about the spoils of his success. Not that youâ€™d know it: With a driving Diana Ross sample courtesy of Puffy, the song is the perfect rain-making anthem, and if you can hear Biggieâ€™s final verse without shouting â€˜B-I-G-P-O-P-P-Aâ€™ along with the late legend, you might want to get your ears checked.\n\n2. â€˜Canâ€™t Buy Me Loveâ€™ by The Beatles\n\nThe Beatlesâ€™ songs about money output mostly focused on the negative side of money (see also, â€˜Taxmanâ€™) but it was during the Fab Fourâ€™s boy-band heyday that they penned the ultimate anti-wealth song, lamenting the one thing that a wad of cash and sudden success couldnâ€™t purchase: affection. The song still rips, even if thereâ€™s a note of melancholy lingering in the backbeat.\n\nAdvertising\n\n3. â€˜C.R.E.A.M.â€™ by Wu-Tang Clan\n\nCash. Rules. Everything. Around. Me. Five words that anchor this highlight from the Clan's 1993 album 'Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'. It's not just an all-time rap classic, but â€“ thanks to this track, 'cream' has become an enduring slang term for money. Just try to overlook the fact it was later sampled by Iggy Azalea.\n\n4. â€˜Everything Countsâ€™ by Depeche Mode\n\nPossibly the catchiest critique of capitalism ever recorded, â€˜Everything Countsâ€™ is an unmistakeable product of the early â€™80s, with its squelchy synth bassline, lyrics about Thatcherite greed and duplicity, and music video set in West Berlin. Whatever your politics, the track till slaps â€“ and it takes a special kind of lyrical genius to rhyme â€˜careerâ€™, â€˜Koreaâ€™ and â€˜insincereâ€™.\n\nJames Manning\n\nContent Director, EMEA\n\nAdvertising\n\n5. â€˜Millionareâ€™ by Kelis\n\nSomeone killed the vibes at your house party? Fear not. Playing this Kelis X AndrÃ© 3000 noughties banger is a surefire way to get the night going again. Sampling Doug E. Freshâ€™s â€˜La Di Da Diâ€™, AndrÃ© 3000 might be desperate for us to know that he woke up early this morning, but the verse thatâ€™ll have everyone screaming the lyrics word for word is â€˜where there is cheese there are ratsâ€™. You know the rest, but basically, someoneâ€™s out to get his riches. Itâ€™s kind of offensive, but itâ€™s got a cracking beat. And the music video is iconic.\n\n6. â€˜Moneyâ€™ by Pink Floyd\n\nRoger Watersâ€™ million-dollar baseline on this Dark Side megahit might do the driving, but itâ€™s the rhythmic ka-chinging of cash registers that really sells Floydâ€™s rollicking takedown of capitalistic urges. Floyd would spend a lot of its career side-eyeing wealth (while getting very, very rich), but never this iconically.\n\nAdvertising\n\n7. â€˜Money Changes Everythingâ€™ by Cyndi Lauper\n\nOriginally recorded by cult new wave band The Brains, â€˜Money Changes Everythingâ€™ became a hit in 1984 when Cyndi Lauper covered it for her smash debut album â€˜Sheâ€™s So Unusualâ€™. Her version of this song about money may begin with a breezy harmonica riff, but the lyrics still sting as Lauper tells the story of a woman whoâ€™s sworn her partner â€˜everlasting loveâ€™... but decides to ditch him for a richer guy.\n\n8. â€˜Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?â€™ by Bing Crosby\n\nWritten for the 1932 musical â€˜Americanaâ€™, this supremely poignant song became a soundtrack to the Great Depression. The socially conscious lyrics are sung from the viewpoint of a beggar whoâ€™s effectively been spat out by the system. â€˜Once I built a railroad, now itâ€™s done,â€™ he sighs. â€˜Brother, can you spare a dime?â€™ Bing Crosbyâ€™s version is the classic, but George Michael's 1999 cover version is pretty damn fine, too.\n\nAdvertising\n\n9. â€˜For the Love of Moneyâ€™ by The Oâ€™Jays\n\nâ€˜Money money money money... money!â€™ This funk classic co-written by legendary Philly sound songwriters Gamble and Huff has an iconic intro. But the song that unfolds over the next seven minutes is often surprisingly dark. â€˜For the love of money, people will rob their own brother,â€™ the Oâ€™Jays warn us mournfully. And theyâ€™d probably do much worse to get their hands on this trackâ€™s frankly incredible bassline.\n\n10. â€˜Bills Bills Billsâ€™ by Destinyâ€™s Child\n\nDestinyâ€™s Childâ€™s first US chart-topper is an unapologetic â€˜screw youâ€™ to shady males who donâ€™t pay their way. A more cash-centric cousin to TLCâ€™s â€˜No Scrubsâ€™, which was co-written by the same R&B hitmaking team, itâ€™s a deathless banger that makes you want to flick your hair as you take your paycheck with you."
