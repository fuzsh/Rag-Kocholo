        "text": "2000-2003 Disco\n\nAt the start of the decade of the 2000s, a substantial number of new disco (\"neo-disco\") songs were released, and a few of them became big hits.

The list that follows includes some original disco songs created and released during the early 2000s (where the lyrics and melodies are original), plus selected remakes, plus songs that sample other disco songs and have a disco flavor all their own (these are listed with reference to the elements that have been copied).
