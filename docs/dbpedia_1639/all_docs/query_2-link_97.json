        "text": "I recently started hearing a ticking noise coming from engine area, from previous experience on my 98 it sounded like it might have been my catalyctic converter so I took in to my local ind mechanic, after inspection they told me it was a loose rocker arm that was making the noise andit was not a major concern right now, in the mean time I'm driving around with that very noticeable ticking noise. I do have an extended warranty that covers me until 96,000 miles,( I am @ 92,000 currently), and would like to have repaired before the expiration, my mechanic told me that it needed to be a failure before the warranty would cover but I would rather not wait until that happens. My question is how long before this couldcause majorproblems with my engine &amp; how easy of a fix is it stop the ticking?\n\nRE: rocker arm ticking 03 disco\n\nWho knows how long it can go like that? Def not me. You have to take a lot apart to get the valve covers off: ps pump, intake manifold, etc... so it does take some labor. I would take the rocker arms apart when I was in there and clean out the oil passages real good, I know most of mine were clogged up makingthem a little noisy. Did they check your oil pressure too, you have an 03which are known to have bad oil pumps on some of them.\n\nRE: rocker arm ticking 03 disco\n\nMy mechanic explained to me that the rocker arms are aluminum but use a steel disc where they contact the push rods. That disc can get loose and cause a ticking sound such as you described. It's been a while so I don't remember all the technicalities involved but it my not be a loose rocker arm at all, but simply that disc on the arm. I had a ticking sound coming from my driver side of the engine and founf out it was caused by 1 or more of the 3 cracks in the exhaust manifold.\n\nRE: rocker arm ticking 03 disco (NEED ADVICE)\n\nPlease help with some advice on this, I decided to take to the LR dealership to have them diagnose the problem to see if it was the same as my ind mechanic, they diagnosed a rocker shaft &amp; cam shaft problem and a leaking headgasket. I took it in on 1/8, they called the next day and said the warranty co wanted to send an inspector to verify, insp came the following Mon and diagnosed a leaking head gasket and bad #4 &amp; #7 lifters so that is what they authorized for repair. The dealer said it would be Thur or Fri before they would finish. Called today and thedealersaid they had everything put back together and it is still making the ticking noise! dealer says for sure it is the whole camshaft that needs to be replaced that is why the noise is still there but said the warranty only authorized the before mentioned work! I called the warranty coto try and see whattheir reasoningwas and they told me their inspectorwas sure the cam shaft was OK and would not replace the camshaft unless the dealer pulls apart the engine again &amp; they send another inspector to verify, if that inspector still disagrees with LR then I will have to pay the 8 hourlabor charge to pull apart the engine (probably about $1k), this whole time Ive had a rental car that costs $45 a day and the warranty only covered 6 days @ $25 a day which the 6th day was yesterday! So I think my choices are: 1-have them pull the engine apartagain, wait for the inspector to come and see if he agrees about the camshaft? 2-pick up my disco with the same ticking noise? 3-pay out of pocket for the dealerto replace the camshaft? 4-take back to ind mechanic and have them replace? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
