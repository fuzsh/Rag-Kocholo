        "meta_description": "posted this as a response on a dumb PT thread but I realized I'd given it enough thought that I should probably share it here:\r\n\r\nPhish are so much more interesting songwriters and composers than the Biscuits, who make Anastasio/Marshall look like Lennon-McCartney. That being said, tDB are not about songwriting and frankly I'm sure they understand that it is not their strong suit. A Phish show goes through so many different musical colors, while Bisco paints a pretty monotone painting to my ears as far as rhythms and tonalities go.\r\n\r\ntDB do not jam more than Phish, as some of their fans suggest. Regardless of how long they play a song for, most of what they do is simply vamping on a very repetitive figure with very little structural improvisation or on the fly changing of the groove. Now, you could say that Phish has a lot of stock jams they fall back on these days, but at least they use them to keep the music changing and flowing and sometimes they actually pull some true magic out of the ether. Maybe a lot of what both bands do is actually relatively pre-determined and all of you are actually looking to listen to Swedish 70s psychedelic music or free jazz but you're too boxed in to even begin to find that stuff (but I digress). So Phish doesn't jam as much as they used to and tDB feels like they play the same drum beat for an hour sometimes...\r\n\r\nand guess what, that's OK! the Biscuits are not the same as Phish and frankly they don't have to be. I used to be an uber-hater, but I've slowly come around. I appreciate their energy and I enjoy the mix of electronic music and delayed-out rock shredding. Sure, I wish they wouldn't open their mouths, and yeah I think the vibe they put off can be pretty whack, but I have come to realize that they actually play some pretty groovy shit. Still, I have yet to go to one of their shows and I'm kind of afraid to honestly. Every time I watch a video it seems like it's all dudes. Is this really the case? this should be a sexy co-ed dance party, but something tells me it's significantly lamer than that. \r\n\r\nUltimately, what I've realized this whole scene is actually about is heart and positivity. These days Phish just exudes that from every pore. All you stopwatch timers and couch tour haters are on the wrong trip cause you are completely missing what is so special about this band (Ph) and what you honestly won't be able to find anymore once they are gone. To have such a joyous experience with so many others on a massive scale is truly one of the greatest blessings in life. Here's hoping all of you can enjoy what there is to enjoy out there and cease creating divides amongst what should really be one tribe. \r\n\r\n\"Music is the healing force of the universe,\" Albert Ayler said that. bleep bloop",
