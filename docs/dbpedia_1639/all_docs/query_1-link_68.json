        "text": "Frequently asked questions\n\nCan I insert a SATA drive into the PS5 console?\n\nNo. M.2 SATA SSDs aren’t supported.\n\nShould I remove the M.2 SSD if I send my PS5 console for repair?\n\nYes. Please remove the M.2 SSD before sending it for repair.\n\nCan I format part of the M.2 SSD for use on the PS5 console?\n\nNo, you must format the entire M.2 SSD.\n\nIs it okay to install a heatsink on an M.2 SSD with a built-in heatsink?\n\nNo. If your M.2 SSD has a built-in heatsink, we recommend against adding any additional heatsinks. Doing so may reduce the effectiveness of the built-in heatsinks.\n\nHow is an M.2 SSD different from USB extended storage on PS5 consoles?\n\nPS5 games are playable on M.2 SSD storage.\n\nPS5 games can be downloaded directly to M.2 SSD storage.\n\nPS5 games can be updated on M.2 SSD storage.\n\nIs it possible to store a part of game data on console storage and the remaining data on M.2 SSD storage?\n\nNo. All game data for a specific game must be stored in the same place.\n\nWhat should I do if I experience gameplay issues when I play games stored on M.2 SSD Storage?\n\nPress the PS button on your controller to go to the control center, and then select Downloads/Uploads. Pause any ongoing downloads.\n\nIf you are trying to play a game on disc, please wait for the full installation to finish.\n\nIf you are still having issues, please move the game from M.2 SSD storage to console storage.\n\nWill installing an M.2 SSD affect my warranty?\n\nIn general, your manufacturer warranty coverage should not be affected provided you install an M.2 drive that meets the required specifications and you follow the installation instructions properly. Failure to do so could result in damage to your console which will not be covered under warranty. We therefore strongly encourage you to carefully review drive specifications prior to purchase and contact the vendor or manufacturer if you need further information. When installing the M.2 drive, you should closely reference the M.2 SSD installation instructions to help avoid any issues. Please read our complete warranty terms for details of what is and isn’t covered and your remedies."
