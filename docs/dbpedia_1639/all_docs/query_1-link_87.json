        "text": "As usual, Real Gone's August lineup is made up of an eclectic bunch of titles. You will find everything here from rock to jazz to heavy metal, spanning the 1960s to the 2000s. All these titles hit store shelves tomorrow, August 9.\n\nFirst up a is a continuation of Real Gone's series of Grateful Dead Dick's Picks vinyl sets with Dick's Picks Volume 12 --Providence Civic Center 6/26/74 & Boston Garden 6/28/74. These concerts occur just before and after the release of their studio album From the Mars Hotel which came out on June 27 of that year. It is also a couple of months before the band took a break from touring. This volume in the Dick's Picks series is a little different than some of the rest in that it takes tracks from each of the shows to present as a composite, rather than showcasing a complete concert. Highlights include the rendition of \"China Cat Sunflower\" and \"Weather Report Suite: Prelude/Pt. 1/Pt. 2-Let It Grow\" leading into the 27-minute \"Jam.\" It has been mastered by Jeffrey Norman at Mockingbird Mastering from the original tapes with the lacquers cut by Clint Holley and Dave Polster at Well Made Music. The box is a 6-LP set inside two-piece hardshell box with an insert featuring photos of the tape box. It comes on 180g black vinyl and is limited to 3,000 copies.\n\nNext up are a pair of vinyl jazz reissues from saxophone greats. Charlie Nothing was the pseudonym of Charles Martin Simon. When his artist wife passed away in 1965, Charlie attempted to paint using her art supplies. In his words, he \"was reduced to nothing\" and so was born his alter ego or \"psyche fragmentation.\" He became best known for creating \"dingulators,\" or working guitars made of American car parts. But in 1967, he released the album The Psychedelic Saxophone of Charlie Nothing/In Eternity with Brother Frederic on the Takoma label. This free jazz album consists of two improvised saxophone pieces accompanied only by gong, table, and ukulele. Real Gone is presenting this cult classic album on all-analog black vinyl, which has been remastered from the original tapes. It is also available as a clear with black swirl vinyl, limited to around 100 copies and available only from Real Gone's website.\n\nAs a sideman, saxophonist Azar Lawrence has worked with artists such as Elvin Jones, Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard, McCoy Tyner, and Woody Shaw, among others. But he has also had a lengthy solo career, spanning 50 years and a dozen albums. Lawrence recorded his first solo album for Prestige in 1974. In 1976, he released his third album, People Moving. The set of funky tunes was produced by Skip Scarborough who would go on to produce recordings for Bobbie Humphrey, Con Funk Shun, Phyllis Hyman, Blue Magic, and more. Personnel on the album include Lee Ritenour, Patrice Rushen, Harvey Mason, and Mtume. The title track was just sampled last month by Common and Pete Rock on their Auditorium Vol. 1 album. Real's Gone's vinyl reissue comes on black vinyl. They are also releasing a hand-numbered \"Purple Rain\" variant, available only from their website and limited to around 100 copies.\n\nReal Gone then moves a nearly 15 years into the future for Firehouse's self-titled debut album from 1990. The group - vocalist/keyboardist C. J. Snare, guitarist Bill Leverty, drummer Michael Foster and bassist Perry Richardson - formed in Virginia in the mid-1980s and signed to Epic in 1989. There glam/heavy metal band's first album proved a success. It went double-platinum and spawned three charting singles: \"All She Wrote\" (No. 58), \"Don't Treat Me Bad\" (No. 19) and the group's signature song, the power ballad \"Love of A Lifetime\" which went to No. 5. They would win the American Music Award for Best New Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Band. Real Gone's new edition marks the album's North American vinyl debut. It is pressed on \"Smoke and Fire\" vinyl and includes an inner sleeve with lyrics.\n\nGoing into the 2000s brings us to two vinyl reissues from Canadian heavy metal band 3 Inches of Blood. Celebrating its 20th anniversary, 2004's Advance and Vanquish features the unique double lead vocal style of the group with Cam Pipes on \"clean\" vocals and Jamie Hooper on \"screaming\" vocals. The cover is drawn by famed Heavy Metal illustrator Edward Repka. 2007's Fire Up the Blades brought in a new instrumental lineup and was produced by Slipknot's Jordy Jordison and moved into fantastical lyric writing. For this new reissue, Real Gone has expanded the album to 2 LPs which features a side of non-LP songs released around the time of the album. Advance and Vanquish comes on orange and black vinyl and includes an inner sleeve with lyrics. Fire Up the Blades comes on \"crimson fire\" vinyl, housed in a gatefold jacket with lyrics and is limited to 1,250 copies.\n\nRounding out Real Gone's August slate is a repressing of the vinyl version of Jefferson Airplane's Woodstock: Sunday, August 17, 1969. Real Gone first released this first back in 2019. They are bringing it back now in iridescent \"cloud breaking\" blue vinyl, limited to 1,000 copies.\n\nIf you would like to give any of these titles a try, we've got the full tracklistings and ordering links below.
