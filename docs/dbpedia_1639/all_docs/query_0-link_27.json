Pholo has performed across the globe and has been working with BABii on SCREAMER and her upcoming album DD 2000. Pholo is now concentrating on his own music and art with his team Spider Circle that will be coming this winter. Let catch up with him & find out what he’s been up to…\n\nAfter moving back to my home town in Derbyshire I have been trying to lock in with my own records and ideas as much as possible. I am much closer to family here so a lot of my work recently has been filled with I guess nostalgia and feelings I’ve had when I was younger growing up around here. I think I have love/hate relationship with this place but you can’t change your roots so I’m making the most of it with what I love to do. I also love playing darts now which I seem to be alright at. I have also been making lots of records with BABii & Iglooghost over the past year and early this year which is something I don’t think I would ever have been able to say at all. It’s been really inspiring working with these two on DD2000 coming out in October. Other than making music under Pholo, I’m now also involved in another project under an alias called DJ Dolly with some more kind of Techno & House sound. The name comes from my last name being Dalton and my Dads nickname has always been Dolly or Ken so I thought I’d make most of the more cooler nick name being Dolly.\n\nI did this mix just in my flat in my home town, Heanor. The closest place like Pirate studios to me is in Nottingham which isn’t far at all but I have no neighbours at the moment. Well, I think I don’t, so I have taken advantage and recorded this mix loud on my own. The people on the market outside my house loved it also so shout out to Memo and Jamie Bestwick.\n\nWhen I get asked to do a guest mix, most of the time I translate it into being asked to create an album or some what of a movie for them. I like taking songs of my own and changing them into a more club sounding record or even a classical version of itself. From start to end I like to have the listener maybe excited or even confused, but over all in a state that they could only get from this one mix I have put together. I also like remixing music that they may have forgotten about and question where they heard the vocal from or something.\n\nUp Next…\n\nI’m hopefully going to finish an album.. hopefully. I have a couple EPs finished I want to drop this year including my record Ecko but my dream is to have an album that I could release once I am happy with a solid selection of music and videos that represent my idea of Pholo & Spider Circle. Winter this year I am planning a tour in the US with locations and dates coming soon. I also want to join a basketball team and maybe move back to London to be around some friends that inspire me.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Pholo – Ecko (1922)\n\n2. Pholo – This&That\n\n3. Pholo – ID\n\n4.

Having grown up in Ghana and Nigeria hearing reggae, drum & bass and dubstep, to her London days of championing underground electronic music, her new alias brings infectious energy, bass-and-percs-heavy sensibilities with some exciting deviations. Her early 2024 EP ’34U’ has cemented her as a forward thinking producer across low-end electronic territories. Let’s catch up with her & find out what she’s been up to…\n\nFestival season is in full swing right now, so in-between that and making tunes am trying to sleep; see the fam; clear my embarrassing inboxes + to-do list; and do little things every day to stay happy and healthy.\n\nThis year I was lucky enough to play on the truly iconic IICON stage at Glastonbury Festival (cute side note BICEP’s live set was a couple hours after me) so decided to bring a slice of it here – “One Hour Of IICON” – for those asking for a recording <3\n\nBecause I was opening the stage for the night – including soundtracking the sun setting – I didn’t want to go in too hard. So this mix is cherry picking tunes from a slow building bass n drums odyssey, as always prioritising new music from underground producers (but also showed respect to the originators with a couple classics).\n\nHeaded to Pirate Studios for their CDJ-3000s as I set a stupid number of loops + cue points on some of the tracks in here to play around with their arrangements (sorry producer friends!) so I could cram in as much as possible. It’s pretty quick mixing; cutting down 2.5 hours was a MISSION!! So fingers crossed this edition still captures some of the magic of that day.\n\nUp Next…\n\nI’ll soon be releasing a track of mine “Up – Run That” (played it in this mix) as a single raising funds for some Sudanese/South Sudanese causes, followed by freeing up 34U.2, the 2nd EP off this year’s production’s mix Made By Mia Koden Vol.2. Beyond that, I’ve finally started collaborating with some artists which I’m v v v excited about. Thanks for having me :) see you August 2nd xx\n\nTracklist:\n\nElla Fitzgerald ft.

His influences range from northern soul, disco, house to Bollywood making melodic, anthemic productions that are influenced by the culture around him and sounds from around the world. Let’s catch up on what Anish has been up to lately…\n\nI finally graduated university (6 years) and played Glastonbury for the first time on the same weekend. I’m shattered but I’m ecstatic that I can move into the next phase of my life now, I was getting really frustrated at having to postpone studio sessions and other cool music opportunities because of my finals. That’s all done now.\n\nI’ve got a few days off at home (Newcastle) before I fly out to the US for a string of shows. Having just moved out of university everything’s a mess and it’s weird having all of my belongings in one room. Obviously the decks were the first to get set up haha.\n\nI actually wanted to do something that reflects this transitional phase in my life, which involves letting go of a lot of things and even relationships. When my laptop got wiped last year I lost a lot of my project files, leaving me to scavenge mp3s of demos I had been working on from old emails and USBs. It’s always funny looking back at old music and resonating with the idea there, but being horrified by the execution. Anyway, I found a few ‘lost demos’ from 2020 – 2021 that I still really like and wanted to cement them into reality in this mix, even though I can’t work on them or release them officially. It’s cool seeing how my influences and inspirations have evolved since then. I initially tried to do a full mix made up of only my old demos but it was too jarring. In a way, this is my way of letting go of that music as I move into something new.\n\nUp next…\n\nShows, shows, shows – making up for lost time basically. US tour, Lost Village, plenty of UK stuff. Hopefully a headline show this year in London.\n\nTracklist:\n\nLibrarian – Man, It’s After You\n\n2. Anish Kumar – lost_demo_10.08.20.mp3\n\n3. K-Lone – Cinco\n\n4. altrice – ‘ever do you want\n\n5.

Anish Kumar – lost_demo_15.03.21.mp3\n\nPUMP IT\n\nFMB MIXTAPE 241 | NAAFI\n\nFMB MIXTAPE 241 | NAAFI (iTUNES)\n\nFMB MIXTAPE 241 | NAAFI (320 DOWNLOAD)\n\nOn this episode of the Feel My Bicep mixtape series we welcome Naafi, whose combination of hybrid live/improv/DJ sets sits perfectly at the forefront of experimental electronic music. They are a lover of trance, acid house, rave and garage or “sparkly music” which would be played on family car journeys such as Britney spears! Let’s catch up on what they’ve been up to recently and this mix…\n\nI’ve just finished a year long residency collaborating with/composing for the Scottish Chamber Orchestra for their Soundbox programme where I was experimenting with bringing together electronic and classical sounds and ways of making. We just had our final shows for the Un:Titled series where I performed live vocals and synth with a 9-piece ensemble.\n\nThe mix was recorded at home with my laptop on Ableton using a midimix controller that I set up with FX, filters etc.\n\nThe mix is a set I played at a night called Loose Joints in Glasgow alongside Dilly Joints and OR:LA, I had a lot of fun playing that night and I wanted the mix to be something that was improvised and created in the moment responding to everyone in the room. Unfortunately I didn’t record it live so this is a shortened recreation of that set.\n\nUp Next…\n\nI have a couple of shows/festivals coming up; one in London for Eat Your Own Ears on 17th July at The Shacklewell Arms, also playing at Kelburn Garden Party in July and working with visual artist Jordan McRae on an audio visual performance for Sonica Festival in September – other than that I’m taking some time to make and explore new sounds.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDrip – Moktar\n\n2. Taito – Polysick\n\n3. Other Side of the Shell – Oceanic\n\n4. Y Generáció – Unknown Artist\n\n5. Her Moon – Tibi Dabo\n\n6. Heart of Glass – Mucho Sueño\n\n7. Bockie – LeftLeft\n\n8.
