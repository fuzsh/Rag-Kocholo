        "text": "\"When they first started out I listened to their music with Blur. And of the two I prefer Pulp,\" says an older Pulp fan Josephine in new documentary film Pulp: A Film About Life, Death & Supermarkets.\n\n\"More melodic and better words actually. It makes you think, what they say. And I like music that makes you think.\"\n\nJosephine isn't wrong. Jarvis Cocker might have been a reluctant lyricist at the start, but his words about sex, Sheffield, class, sex, jealousy, sex, growing up and sex are an integral part of what makes Pulp so very special.\n\nBelow, Digital Spy rounds up 20 of the very best Pulp lyrics and invites you to share your favourites in the comments box below.\n\nNB Please do not read the lyrics whilst listening to the recordings.\n\n1. 'Love Love'\n\n\"I recall a special friend, I invited her home for tea,\n\nAnd while my mother cooked the meal, she was under the table with me.\"\n\n2. 'Don't You Know'\n\n\"I don't need your excuses,\n\nHow you tired of trying to stay on top.\n\nSo just lie back and enjoy it,\n\nand save your tears for\n\nwhen the kissing stops.\n\nOh, you know it's got to stop.\"\n\n3. 'My Legendary Girlfriend'\n\n\"So I woke her, and we went walking through the sleeping town, down deserted streets, frozen gardens grey in the moonlight, fences, down to the canal, creeping slowly past cooling towers, deserted factories, looking for an adventure. I wander the streets calling your name, jumping walls, hoping to see a light in your window. Let me in, let me come in, let me in tonight. I see you shivering in the garden, silver gooseflesh in the moonlight. She's balancing, there are so many others with unbroken eyes as well, no cellulite afternoons, she is balancing, balancing on the edge of ugliness tonight, she is balancing. Good god.\"\n\n4. 'Sheffield: Sex City'\n\n\"The sun rose from behind the gasometers at 6:30am, crept through the gap in your curtains and caressed your bare feet poking from beneath the floral sheets. I watched him flaking bits of varnish from your nails trying to work his way up under the sheets. Jesus, even the sun's on heat today, the whole city getting stiff in the building heat.\"\n\n5. 'Babies'\n\n\"We were on the bed when you came home,\n\nI heard you stop outside the door.\n\nI know you won't believe it's true,\n\nI only went with her 'cos she looks like you.\"\n\n6. 'Razzmatazz'\n\n\"Oh well, I saw you at the doctors\n\nWaiting for a test.\n\nYou're trying to look like some kind of heiress,\n\nBut your face is such a mess.\"\n\n7. 'Do You Remember The First Time?'\n\n\"You say you've got to go home,\n\n'Cos he's sitting on his own again this evening,\n\nAnd I know you're gonna let him bore your pants off again.\n\nOh now it's half past eight, you'll be late.\"\n\n8. 'Mis-Shapes'\n\n\"Check your lucky numbers,\n\nThat much money could drag you under, oh\n\nWhat's the point in being rich\n\nif you can't think what to do with it\n\n'Cos you're so bleeding thick?\"\n\n9. 'Common People'\n\n\"I took her to a supermarket,\n\nI don't know why, but I had to start it somewhere.\n\nSo it started there.\n\nI said, 'Pretend you've got no money'.\n\nShe just laughed and said 'Oh you're so funny'.\n\nI said 'Yeah? (heh)\n\nWell, I can't see anyone else smiling in here'.\"\n\n10. 'Sorted For E's & Wizz'\n\n\"And you want to call your mother and say:\n\n'Mother, I can never come home again\n\n'Cos I seem to have left an important part of my brain somewhere,\n\nSomewhere in a field in Hampshire'.\"\n\n11. 'F.E.E.L.I.N.G. C.A.L.L.E.D. L.O.V.E'\n\n''And as I stand and cross the room,\n\nI feel as if my whole life has been leading to this one moment,\n\nAnd as I touch your shoulder tonight this room has become the centre of the entire universe.\"\n\n12. 'Something Changed'\n\n\"Where would I be now if we'd never met?\n\nWould I be singing this song to someone else instead?\n\nI don't know,\n\nbut like you said:\n\nSomething changed.\"\n\n13. 'Disco 2000'\n\n\"You were the first girl at school to get breasts,\n\nAnd Martyn said that you were the best.\n\nOh, the boys all loved you but I was a mess,\n\nI had to watch them try and get you undressed.\"\n\n14. 'The Fear'\n\n\"This is our Music From A Bachelors Den,\n\nThe sound of loneliness turned up to ten,\n\nA horror soundtrack from a stagnant water-bed,\n\nAnd it sounds just like this.\"\n\n15. 'Dishes'\n\n\"I am not Jesus, though I have the same initials,\n\nI am the man who stays home and does the dishes.\"\n\n16. 'Party Hard'\n\n\"I was having a whale of a time\n\nUntil your uncle, your uncle Psychosis arrived.\n\nWhy do we have to half kill ourselves\n\nJust to prove we're alive?\"\n\n17. 'Help The Aged'\n\n\"Help the aged,\n\nOne time they were just like you,\n\nDrinking, smoking cigs and sniffing glue.\"\n\n18. 'This Is Hardcore'\n\n\"You are hardcore,\n\nYou make me hard.\n\nYou name the drama\n\nAnd I'll play the part.\n\nIt seems I saw you in some teenage wet dream.\n\nI like your get up if you know what I mean.\"\n\n19. 'Wickerman'\n\n\"Yeah, the river flows on beneath pudgy 15-year-olds addicted to coffee whitener, courting couples naked on Northern Upholstery and pensioners gathering dust like bowls of plastic tulips. And it finally comes above ground again at Forge Dam: the place where we first met.\"\n\n20. 'Sunrise'\n\n\"I used to hate the sun\n\nBecause it shone on everything I'd done.\n\nMade me feel\n\nThat all that I had done\n\nWas overfill the ashtray of my life.\""
