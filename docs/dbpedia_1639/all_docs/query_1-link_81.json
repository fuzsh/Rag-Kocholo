        "text": "Good Thursday morning, Uni Watchers. I hope everyone had a good Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the New York Football Giants released their 2024 Uniform Schedule, and I was genuinely surprised at the number of comments pertaining to the Giants road uniform. In that piece, it was noted that the Giants, in order to accommodate their new “Legacy Red” uniform, will be ditching their designated “Color Rush” uniform, which is basically a throwback to their 1980s/1990s road uniforms.\n\nExcept for the white socks (and a couple other very minor tweaks), that’s pretty much what they wore on the road during their Super Bowl XXI and XXV winning seasons. Nostalgia aside, I think most of us can agree that’s a pretty good looking uniform. And I think many of us would argue it’s a superior uniform, from the neck down, than their current road uniform.\n\nThe current roadie features a white jersey and pants, and the jersey has red Northwestern stripes on the sleeve caps, along with block red numbers; the pants also have the Northwestern stripe. Socks are red. So, the team has a blue helmet with a thin red stripe, but not a single blue element from the neck down. How, you may ask, does a team whose nickname is “Big Blue” not have any blue anywhere on their uniform except for the helmet? And why does the road uniform look so different from the home?\n\nAside from the helmet, these are basically two completely different uniforms. The home jersey is solid blue with white block numbers. Pants are white with a blue/gray/red/gray/blue striping pattern, and socks are blue. As mentioned above, the road jersey and pants both have a Northwestern striping pattern and nary a speck of blue.\n\nBut it wasn’t always this way.\n\nIn order to properly assess the current road uniform, we need to go back in time many many decades. From their birth in 1925 through 1936, the Giants were predominantly a red team; it wasn’t until 1937 when they introduced their first solid blue jersey, and that was paired with both gray and tan pants. In fact, the 1937 uniform with the blue jersey looked very much like what the Giants wore as recently as 2018! For games when the opposition wore blue (or similar dark shades), the team wore a red jersey. Aside from minor changes to the helmet, the Giants continued to wear their blue/gray uniforms — except against similarly attired teams, when they would wear their red jerseys — from 1937 through 1952. With the advent of games being broadcast in black and white TV, teams began adding white alternate jerseys (mandated in 1956) in order to provide contrast for the TV audience. The Giants first added a white jersey in 1953. They would add Northwestern stripes to the white jersey in 1954. While the red jersey remained until 1956, it was rendered superfluous by the white jersey, and in 1957, the Giants would adopt a familiar look, adding the red/gray/blue/gray/red striping pattern to the gray pants.\n\nThey would keep this look into the 1960s, with the first small change taking place in 1961. They added the classic “ny” to their helmets, and changed the striping pattern on the pants. They kept that basic look until 1965. Finally, in 1966, the Giants made major changes (for them) to the uniform, ditching the gray pants for white, and adding a blue/red/blue stripe to the white jersey and pants. Save for the helmet logo reading “ny” these uniforms were very similar to the 1980s/1990s uniforms. I happen to think 1966-1974 was their finest look; one which they have come close to, but have never quite replicated, since then. I mean, c’mon, how great is this:\n\nThings went off the rails a bit after that, as the team underwent a major overhaul, briefly introducing the “Disco” NY logo, and blue pants, and redesigning the jerseys and pants. The following season, with their move to the Meadowlands, the team introduced the “GIANTS” helmet, and by 1979, finally ditched the blue pants. In 1980, the team would debut the uniform in which (in a few years) they would win their first two Super Bowls, and to which they had been throwing back the past several seasons. They would wear that look, with very few changes, until 1999.\n\nBeginning with the 2000 season, the team redesigned to “throw back” to their uniform set from the early 1960s for the home uniform. However, their road jersey didn’t quite match up with the more red-heavy look and Northwestern striping from the past. The new road jersey had red numbers outlined in blue, and a blue collar, and no stripes on the sleeves. It wasn’t until 2005 that the team tweaked the road uniform to return the Northwestern stripes and changed up the striping pattern for the road pants. In 2009, the team would ditch the home gray pants and wore gray pants with the red/gray/blue/gray/red striping pattern for both home and road.\n\nThe next season, they wore both the old (blue/red/blue) and new (red/gray/blue/gray/red) pants with the home jerseys. Finally in 2012, they returned to one set of gray pants for both home and road. But they weren’t finished yet. The very next year, the team began wearing white pants with the red/gray/blue/gray/red striping pattern for some home games. They’d continue to wear both colors of pants with the blue jerseys over the next several seasons, wearing white pants for home games, and gray pants for road games (with both the white and blue jerseys).\n\nFor all these years, the white road jersey remained unchanged. In 2017, the team debuted their “Color Rush” uniform (the one which was just eliminated for this year); again the regular road (white) jersey remained unchanged. Finally, in 2021, the team introduced white pants to be worn with the white jerseys. Those pants were like nothing they’d ever worn before: they had a red Northwestern stripe. They’ve kept this as their road uniform since then.\n\n__________So…that’s how we got to where we are. As you can see, there is historical precedent for the “all-red” white jersey going back to the 1950s. But there were many, many years in between when the team’s white jersey had a lot more blue — sometimes there was no red. As traditional as the Giants have been (save for a couple years out in the wilderness in the later 1970s), they’ve actually been fairly inconsistent with their road uniforms. They’ve gone from having no blue, to almost all blue, to a mix of red and blue, and back to having no blue. Their pants have vacillated between white and gray (with various combinations of blue and red striping), and now they’re back to white pants with no blue at all. As a Giants fan since the early 1970s, this has been more frustrating than you might imagine. About the only constant — save for their 1980-1999 uniforms — has been a solid blue home jersey with no red. You may disagree, but I think that is their best look. But what’s their best road look? It can’t be what they’re wearing now.\n\nPersonally, I’d love for them to go back to the Fran Tarkenton look, which is their current helmet, a solid blue home jersey, and white pants with a blue/red/blue striping pattern (which matches their helmets). And the road look, with the blue/red/blue jersey stripe (matching the helmets and pants) with solid blue numbers, was as good as it ever was. And that look wasn’t that far off from their 1980s/1990s/Color Rush uniform. The key differences there were the blue numbers outlined in red and “GIANTS” on the helmets.\n\nOver the years I’ve seen a few concepts for changes to the Giants road uniforms. Let’s take a look at a few of the more realistic ones.\n\nMost of these involve adding blue back to the white jersey. Here’s one that does so by taking the current road jersey and making the numbers blue, and tweaking the Northwestern stripe.\n\nOthers simply change the current red numbers/stripes to blue (ignore the white helmet):\n\nStill others are variations on the 1980s/1990s/CR look:\n\nHere’s one that creates a new helmet striping pattern and adds a blue pants option, using a modified Northwestern striping pattern on the sleeves:\n\nOthers blend the 1980s/1990s/CR jersey with the current helmet and pants:\n\nAnd then there are some that want to take the (lack of) Color Rush to the extreme:\n\nWhile none of these concepts feels just right (to me, anyway), they’re almost all better than what the Giants currently wear. I think we can all agree the road uniform (especially the jersey) needs some blue on it, whether that’s simply something like the early 2000s where the collar was blue and the red numbers were outlined in blue, or the Fran Tarkenton era, when there was some red, but mostly blue. I know some of you liked the gray pants and would just like the “old” road uniform (current jersey but with gray pants) to return.\n\nWhere do you fall? Would you like to see the Giants redesign their road uniform (again) to include more blue? Or do you like it as it is? And if you’d like a change, what kind of tweaks would you like? What about adding blue pants? There was a five year period when the team wore blue pants with their white jerseys — would that be something to explore?\n\nLove to hear your thoughts. The floor is yours…"
