        "text": "TREVISO (Lega A) - Benetton Treviso have bolstered their lineup with the signing of John Lucas III, the 25-year-old son of former NBA star John Lucas.\n\nLucas III, a point guard who played collegiately for Eddie Sutton at Oklahoma State, spent the 2005-06 campaign with Snaidero Udine.\n\nTo make room for the new player, Benetton have released ex-Spain international Rodrigo De La Fuente.\n\nBenetton coach Mahmuti Oktay said: “I watched him (Lucas) play at Udine but once he arrives here, we will see what his condition is and how he will be able to adapt to European basketball.\n\n“He’s a player with talent but talent is only one part of the system.”\n\nLucas III had signed a three-year deal with the Houston Rockets in the summer of 2006 and averaged 3.3 points per contest, but he was unable to make this season’s roster.\n\nHis father, John Harding Lucas II, played college basketball at the University off Maryland and represented the United States at the FIBA World Championship in 1974, helping them capture the bronze medal.\n\nHe would go on the number one pick in the 1976 NBA draft and was a star point guard with Houston.\n\nBenetton have struggled all season in Lega A and are fourth from bottom, with seven wins and 11 defeats.\n\nThey did manage to claim a 93-71 triumph at Solsonica Rieti on Sunday, with Great Britain international Pops Mensah-Bonsu pouring in 15 points and grabbing nine rebounds.\n\nMontepaschi Siena are running away with the regular season title in Italy.\n\nThey are undefeated with 18 victories after Sunday’s resounding 82-58 home win over Snaidero Udine.\n\nThe teams closest to them are Premiata Montegranaro and Lottomatica Roma, teams with 12-6 records.\n\nAngelico Biella, Air Avellino, Scavolini Pesaro (all 11-7), Pierrel Capo d’Orlando (10-7) and Fortitudo Bologna (8-10) round out the top eight.\n\nHowever, it’s a very tight race to the Coppa Italia, which the top eight sides will play in by midseason.\n\nArmani Jeans Milano, Virtus Bologna, Cantu, Rieti and Teramo also each have eight wins, and Snaidero and Benetton – the defending Coppa Italia champions – have seven wins apiece.\n\nFIBA"
