        "text": "Earlier this week, I took a look at the top Missouri basketball players from my 10 seasons on the beat at the Tribune, but that got me to thinking about all of the great individuals I’ve watched the Tigers play against during my tenure at the paper. The eight of those seasons spent in the Big 12 Conference were particularly rich for observing some of college basketball’s biggest stars of the past decade.\n\nI had to leave off some pretty good individuals in compiling the following list of the 10 best players to suit up for one of Missouri’s conference rivals over the past 10 years — based not necessarily on how they performed in a particular game against MU but over the course of a season in which they played the Tigers.\n\nHere is just a taste of the players who didn’t make my top 10: Baylor’s Ekpe Udoh; Colorado’s Alec Burks; Iowa State’s Wesley Johnson and Craig Brackins; Kansas standouts Julian Wright, Brandon Rush, Mario Chalmers, Sherron Collins, Cole Aldrich, Marcus and Markieff Morris and Tyshawn Taylor: Oklahoma State’s Joey Graham, John Lucas III, James Anderson and Le’Bryan Nash; Texas’ LaMarcus Aldridge, P.J. Tucker, Daniel Gibson, Damion James, Jordan Hamilton and J’Covan Brown; and, more recently, Alabama’s Trevor Releford, Georgia’s Kentavious Caldwell-Pope; Kentucky’s Julius Randle and James Young; LSU’s Johnny O’Bryant III, Mississippi’s Marshall Henderson and Tennessee’s Jarnell Stokes and Jordan McRae.\n\nBut I hope people understand why after looking at my choices for the top 10:\n\n1. Kevin Durant, Texas (2006-07): I remember asking former Missouri assistant coach Matt Zimmerman about Durant days before the Tigers traveled to Austin, Texas, to play his Longhorns in January 2007. He made a guarantee about Durant that day: “He’ll never see the inside of this building.” There was no doubt at the midpoint of his freshman season Durant was headed to the NBA and superstardom. He scored 34 points and grabbed 13 rebounds against the Tigers, and that was actually his low offensive output in his first two Big 12 Conference games. Durant, who averaged 25.8 points and 11.1 rebounds, became the first freshman to win the Wooden Award as the nation’s top player.\n\n2. Michael Beasley, Kansas State (2007-08): Beasley, who grew up in the same Washington, D.C., area as Durant, actually topped his productivity by averaging 26.2 points and 12.4 rebounds for the Wildcats while leading them to the NCAA Tournament. His 40 points and 17 rebounds in a 100-63 rout of Missouri in Manhattan, Kan., might have been the top individual performance I’ve witnessed in the past 10 years. He is worthy of the top spot on this list but wasn’t quite as big a phenom as Durant, who had a never-before-seen combination of size and skill.\n\n3. Blake Griffin, Oklahoma (2007-09):Griffin was — and is — an athletic freak who was slowed a bit by injuries in a productive season but developed into the nation’s best player as a sophomore in 2008-09. I’ve never watched a more dominant rebounder that Griffin, who averaged 22.7 points and 14.4 rebounds that season and pulled down 21 boards to go with 16 points in a loss to the DeMarre Carroll-led Tigers in Columbia.\n\n4. D.J. Augustin, Texas (2006-08): I consider Augustin the best guard I’ve had a chance to watch in the past 10 years. He was overshadowed by Durant as a freshman when he averaged 14.4 points and 6.7 assists, and Beasley kept him from winning the Big 12 Player of the Year award as a sophomore, when he averaged 19.2 points and 5.8 assists and led the Longhorns to the Big 12 regular-season title and the Elite Eight. He actually struggled a bit in two career games against Missouri, averaging 15 points and seven assists but shooting 9 for 25 from the field.\n\n5. Thomas Robinson, Kansas (2009-12): Were it not for Anthony Davis’ presence at Kentucky, Robinson would have joined Durant and Griffin on the list of Wooden Award winners from the Big 12 Conference in the past 10 years. He had to wait his turn to find greatness, playing fewer than 10 minutes per game as a freshman and only 14.6 as a sophomore behind the Morris twins, but he turned into a brighter star than both of them had been during his junior season when averaged 17.7 points and 11.9 rebounds. He averaged 26.5 points and 12.5 rebounds in that 2011-12 season against Missouri as the two teams treated fans to a pair of unforgettable Border War battles before the rivalry went on hiatus.\n\n6. Wayne Simien, Kansas (2001-05): I’d actually forgotten just how good Simien — like the five names above him, a first-team All-American— was because I only covered his final season and it happened almost a decade ago. But I was reminded while double-checking myself to make up this list. He averaged 20.3 points and 11.3 rebounds as the centerpiece of the team that began the Jayhawks’ decade-long streak of winning at least a share of the Big 12 regular-season title. Simien averaged 19.5 points and 8.5 rebounds as Kansas swept the Tigers. (Quick aside: I think it’s telling about Bill Self’s approach that Kansas only has two players I included on this list while being undoubtedly the most consistently dominant opponent Missouri has had over the past 10 seasons. The Jayhawks’ strength is often in their balance. Others might have included Sherron Collins, a two-time All-American, but I was never as enamored as most with his game, thinking he lacked efficiency.)\n\n7. Acie Law IV, Texas A&M (2003-07): Former Missouri assistant Melvin Watkins gets the credit for recruiting Law to College Station, Texas, but he turned into a star under Billy Gillispie and, while doing so, was the driving force bringing the Aggies to national relevance. He had 20 points and three assists during his only game against Missouri in a senior season better remembered for his 23-point performance — including a game-winning shot — against Kansas at Allen Fieldhouse. The Aggies should have probably won the Big 12 title that season — they finished second, a game behind the Jayhawks — and Law averaged 18.1 points and five assists.\n\n8. Jacob Pullen, Kansas State (2007-2011): Pullen arrived in Manhattan, Kan., as part of the same recruiting class as Beasley, and he was a role player during his lone season teaming with him and Bill Walker. Few could have envisioned that Pullen would lead the Wildcats to greater heights after those two more heralded teammates left. In his junior season of 2009-10, he teamed with Denis Clemente in the backcourt and led KansasState to the Elite Eight while averaging 19.1 points. He was more of a solo act his senior season, averaging 20.2 points for a team that lost to Wisconsin in the Round of 32 despite Pullen scoring 38 points. He had 24 points in 24 minutes in his final game against the Tigers.\n\n9. Scottie Wilbekin, Florida (2010-14): Wilbekin has been the Southeastern Conference’s best player during the Tigers’ first two seasons in the league, a tenacious defender who ably piloted Florida to back-to-back regular-season titles. He had a good case to take SEC Player of the Year honors from Caldwell-Pope in 2013 and was an obvious choice to be the league’s player in the just completed season, when he averaged 13.1 points, 3.6 assists and 1.6 steals while leading the Gators to an 18-0 regular-season finish and No. 1 national ranking. Wilbekin averaged 17 points in a pair of victories against Missouri as a senior.\n\n10. Royce White, Iowa State (2011-12): I’m some would argue against White’s inclusion on this list, and I acknowledge there are other MU opponents in the past 10 years who put up better numbers for better teams than the Cyclones were in his only season of action. But I was always drawn to White’s unique talent. He might be the most versatile player I’ve ever covered in college basketball and averaged 13.4 points, 9.3 rebounds and five assists while leading IowaState back to relevance before turning professional. He averaged 18 points, six rebounds and 7.5 assists in two games against Missouri in 2011-12.\n\nMissouri also has gone up against a pretty impressive list of players outside its league over the last 10 years, including Gonzaga’s Adam Morrison and Ronny Turiaf; Davidson’s Stephen Curry; Purdue’s Carl Landry and Robbie Hummel; Arkansas’ Ronnie Brewer; Michigan State’s Drew Nietzel; Maryland’s Grievis Vasquez; Mississippi State and eventual Notre Dame standout Ben Hansbrough; Xavier’s Tu Holloway; Southern California’s Taj Gibson and DeMar DeRozan; Marquette’s Jerel McNeal and Wesley Matthews (and a young Jimmy Butler); Connecticut’s Hasheem Thabeet; Vanderbilt’s John Jenkins, Jeffrey Taylor and Festus Ezeli; Louisville’s Peyton Siva and Gorgui Dieng, not to mention 2013 Final Four Most Outstanding Player Luke Hancock; Bucknell’s Mike Muscala; UCLA’s Shabazz Muhammad, Kyle Anderson, Jordan Adams and Zach Lavine and a pair of Illinois players from the Braggin’ Rights Series in Dee Brown and Luther Head.\n\nThe Tigers caught Morrison, Curry, Hummel, Hansbrough and even Vasquez at least a year before they’d reached their All-American peaks, but they saw the best from each member of this top five list of nonconference foes from the past 10 years:\n\n1. Da’Sean Butler, West Virginia (2006-10):Butler hasn’t had the post-college career of many others already mentioned and to come, but I don’t remember a player playing at a higher level when the Tigers faced them than the Mountaineers guard, who averaged 17.2 points and 6.2 rebounds that season and was one of 10 finalists for the Wooden Award. He hit game-winning shots against Cincinnati and Georgetown and averaged 19.7 points while leading West Virginia to the Big East Tournament title and in a second-round NCAA Tournament matchup with Missouri poured in 28 points while pulling down eight rebounds. He would go on to lead the Mountaineers to the Final Four — through John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins-led Kentucky — only to have his college career ended by a torn anterior cruciate ligament in a loss to eventual national champion Duke in the national semifinal.\n\n2. Tyreke Evans, Memphis (2008-09): It’s sometimes easy to overlook Evans, the John Calipari-coached point guard who came between No. 1 pick Derrick Rose of Memphis and No. 1 pick Wall of Kentucky. Evans wound up being drafted fourth overall by the Sacramento Kings after averaging 17.1 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.9 assists in his only college season in 2008-09, and he saved his best individual performance for his last, pouring in a career-high 33 points in the track meet that was the all-Tigers Sweet 16 battle, won by Missouri 102-91 in Glendale, Ariz. Even a defender as decorated as J.T. Tiller, the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, was helpless to keep him from getting into the paint.\n\n3. Kemba Walker, Connecticut (2008-2011):Walker theoretically was like Curry, Hummel and Hansbrough — years away from realizing his potential — when the Tigers faced him as a freshman, after getting by Evans, in the 2009 Elite Eight. But the reality is that they might have gotten an early glimpse of the greatness of a player who wound up leading the Huskies to the 2011 national championship and winning the NCAA Tournament’s Most Outstanding Player award. Walker might have only averaged 8.9 points as a freshman, but in that regional final against the Tigers, he scored a game-high 23 points on 7-for-9 shooting with five rebounds and five assists, overshadowing then-more heralded teammates Thabeet and A.J. Price, in an 82-75 victory.\n\n4. Deron Williams, Illinois (2003-05): Williams was the best of a three-headed backcourt with Brown and Head and steered the Fighting Illini to the brink of the national championship in 2005 in St. Louis. Both Brown and Head averaged more points, but Williams was the one at the controls and averaged a team-high 6.8 assists in what was his sophomore season before going on to be chosen third overall in the 2005 NBA draft. I saw Williams score 19 points with five assists in a Braggin’ Rights victory over Missouri, but I also remember his play to get Illinois to the Final Four with back-to-back 20-point games. Williams also had 17 points and seven assists in the NCAA final against North Carolina, which I also covered."
