        "text": "john-lucas-2-1-15.jpg\n\nJohn Lucas III, soon to join the Detroit Pistons, most recently played for the Utah Jazz.\n\n(AP File Photo)\n\nAUBURN HILLS -- The Detroit Pistons expect to sign John Lucas III to a 10-day contract Monday after the point guard's season with a team in China concluded, sources confirmed to MLive today.\n\nESPN.com was first to report that the Pistons plan to sign Lucas.\n\nLucas, 31, fits the profile of what the Pistons sought in a third point guard: An NBA veteran for whom they don't have to give up any assets, including draft picks of any sort, and who doesn't require them to take on added salary.\n\nLucas has played with four NBA teams, most recently the Utah Jazz last season.\n\nHe was released by the Washington Wizards in October and signed with Fujian Quanzhou Bank.\n\nLucas has played 216 NBA games (eight starts), with averages of 4.8 points, 1.4 assists and 12.2 minutes. He is a 34.7-percent 3-point shooter and offers some bench scoring punch at point guard.\n\nThe Pistons have sought another point guard to back up D.J. Augustin since starter Brandon Jennings' season ended with a Jan. 24 torn left Achilles tendon.\n\nAugustin and rookie Spencer Dinwiddie have been the only point guards on the roster since Jennings' injury.\n\nThe Pistons explored trades, including one in which they would have sent Jonas Jerebko to Miami for Norris Cole, but balked when the Heat also wanted them to take on Danny Granger's player option for the 2015-16 season.\n\nStan Van Gundy, Pistons president of basketball operations and head coach, hinted Friday that the team might have a player on a 10-day contract here Monday, with part of that timing predicated on possibly improving the position before the Feb. 19 trade deadline.\n\nThe Pistons could sign Lucas to consecutive 10-day contracts and cover themselves through the trade deadline without committing to a guaranteed deal for the rest of the season.\n\nIf a trade materializes, the Pistons could release Lucas. If not, he would have almost three weeks in the system before the Pistons would have to decide whether to retain him for the rest of the year or try someone else."
