        "text": "Ulric Maligi At A Glance\n\nLauded as one of the nation's top assistant coaches by ESPN, The Athletic and Silver Waves Media\n\nOne of just 7 associate head coaches under the age of 40 at the major college level (AAC, ACC, Big 12, BIG EAST, Big Ten, Pac-12 and SEC), including the youngest such coach in the Big 12\n\nHas 16 years of coaching experience and deep ties to the state of Texas\n\nHas coached and/or recruited 21 NBA players in his coaching career, including Danuel House, Jr. (Philadelphia 76ers/Houston), Keyontae Johnson (Oklahoma City Thunder/K-State), Mac McClung (Orlando Magic/Texas Tech), Shake Milton (Minnesota Timberwolves/SMU), Markquis Nowell (Toronto Raptors/K-State) and Robert Williams III (Portland Trail Blazers/Texas A&M).\n\nFeatures (click on headline for link)\n\nA Longstanding Relationship Brought Maligi to K-State (K-State Sports Extra, April 4, 2022)\n\nPronounced YUR-ick MAL-uh-ghee\n\nConsidered one of the nation’s top assistant coaches, Ulric Maligi begins his second season as associate head coach at Kansas State in 2023-24 under reigning National Coach of the Year Jerome Tang.\n\nMaligi is one of just seven associate head coaches under the age of 40 at the major college level (AAC, ACC, Big 12, BIG EAST, Big Ten, Pac-12 and SEC), including the youngest such coach in the Big 12.\n\nMaligi was part of a coaching staff that helped reenergize a K-State program in 2022-23, guiding the Wildcats to their third-highest win total (26) and a thrilling run to the Elite Eight despite being picked last in the Big 12 preseason poll after three consecutive losing seasons. The 26 wins are the third-most in school history, trailing the school-record 29 in 2009-10 and the 27 in 2012-13, and just the eighth 25-win campaign.\n\nMaligi assisted in the development of a pair of All-Americans in Bob Cousy Award winner Markquis Nowell and Julius Erving Award finalist Keyontae Johnson, who were the only teammates nationally to earn All-America honors in 2022-23. They became the first duo in school history to each earn All-American recognition from The Associated Press when they were selected to the Third Team. Both were named to the All-Big 12 First Team, while Johnson was the league's Newcomer of the Year.\n\nFollowing the season, Johnson became the first Wildcat since 2017 to be selected in the NBA Draft, as he was taken in the second round with the 50th pick by the Oklahoma City Thunder. In addition, Nowell signed a 2-way contract with the Toronto Raptors on draft night.\n\nWith Maligi helping to run the defensive scheme, the Wildcats ranked 24th nationally in opponent 3-point field goal percentage (30.8) and 27th in adjusted defensive efficiency (95.0) according to KenPom in 2022-23. The team nearly broke the school single season record for steals with 289, just 5 shy of the record set in 2017-18. Nowell, who ranked second nationally in steals, broke three individual school records for steals, including single season total (92) and per game average (2.56 spg.) as well as career average (2.40).\n\nIn addition to their on-court success, Maligi and the staff helped the team set marks for academic success, as the cumulative team GPA (2.993) as well as the Fall 2022 (2.998) and Spring 2023 (2.903) semester GPAs were the highest in program history.\n\nAn assistant coach with 16 years of experience and deep ties to the state of Texas, Maligi came to K-State in April 2022 after spending three seasons on staff at Texas Tech (2019-21) and Texas (2021-22). In addition to his time with the Red Raiders and Longhorns, he has also been an assistant coach at UT-Arlington (2006-07), Stephen F. Austin (2007-10), Houston (2010-12), SMU (2012-15) and Texas A&M (2016-19).\n\nAll told, Maligi has been a part of coaching staffs that have won more than 300 games – averaging nearly 20 wins per season in his coaching career – and advanced to the postseason on eight occasions, including six NCAA Tournaments (2009, 2015, 2018, 2021, 2022, 2023). He has also helped teams register eight 20-win seasons, including at least one at five of his eight stops, and collect five conference titles.\n\nMaligi has been lauded for his accomplishments on the court, as he was recognized by both ESPN and The Athletic on their “40 under 40” lists for the top individuals in college basketball. He was listed 14th on The Athletic’s “40 under 40” list by Seth Davis which acknowledged the rising stars under the age of 40 in November 2021, while a group of ESPN writers selected him 13th on their list of top coaches under the age of 40 in May 2020.\n\nMaligi was selected to participate in the 2021 Top Connect symposium, which helps connect assistant coaches with athletic administrators from around the country. He has also been involved in the NCAA and BCA Achieving Coaching (ACE) Program, which seeks to prepare minority coaches for success as future head coaches.\n\nMaligi’s list of honors grew again in May 2023 when he was included on a list of the “Most Impactful High Major Assistant Coaches in Division I Basketball” by Silver Waves Media for the second consecutive year.\n\nKnown for his abilities to recruit high-level players, Maligi has coached and/or recruited 21 NBA players in his coaching career, including Danuel House, Jr. (Philadelphia 76ers/Houston), Keyonate Johnson (Oklahoma City Thunder/K-State), Mac McClung (Orlando Magic/Texas Tech), Shake Milton (Minnesota Timberwolves/SMU), Markquis Nowell (Toronto Raptors/K-State) and Robert Williams III (Portland Trail Blazers/Texas A&M).\n\nMaligi has been instrumental in helping sign top-rated recruiting classes at nearly every coaching stop, including a consensus top-30 class at K-State for 2023-24, which includes a heralded 3-man freshman class of Dai Dai Ames Jr., R.J. Jones and Macaleab Rich. In addition, he helped attract one of the top transfer classes nationally with Tylor Perry, Arthur Kaluma and Ques Glover.\n\nMaligi was also part of the staff that delivered Top 10 classes at Texas Tech (No. 7 nationally by Rivals and No. 9 by 247Sports) in 2021 and Texas (No. 7 nationally by Rivals and No. 10 by 247Sports) in 2022, along with Top 20 classes at both SMU (No. 14 in 2014) and Houston (No. 20 in 2012). While at Texas, he played a huge role in the recruitment of McDonald's All-American Dillon Mitchell, who was second-highest rated player in school history behind Kevin Durant.\n\nIn all, Maligi has also helped sign 22 prospects ranked among the top 100 recruits in the country.\n\nPRIOR TO K-STATE\n\nMaligi was apart of 58 wins and two NCAA Tournament appearances in three seasons as an assistant coach for Beard at both Texas Tech (2019-21) and Texas (2021-22).\n\nIn his lone season in Austin, Maligi helped the Longhorns post a 22-12 record, including a fourth-place finish with a 10-8 mark in the Big 12, and earn a No. 6 seed in the 2022 NCAA Tournament, where they collected their first NCAA Tournament win since 2014 with an 81-73 first-round victory over Virginia Tech. Five players earned All-Big 12 honors, including Second Team and All-Newcomer distinction by Timmy Allen and Third Team honors by Marcus Carr.\n\nTexas Tech won 18 games in each of Maligi’s two seasons as an assistant coach and most likely would have earned two NCAA Tournament appearances if not for the 2020 tournament being canceled due to COVID-19.\n\nThe 2020-21 Red Raiders posted an 18-11 record and advanced to the NCAA Tournament Second Round before a narrow 68-66 loss to Elite Eight-bound Arkansas. The team was ranked in the AP Top 25 throughout the entire season for the first time in school history, reaching as high as No. 7 in February. Four players earned All-Big 12 accolades, including Second Team selection Mac McClung and Third Team pick Terrence Shannon, Jr.\n\nDuring the abbreviated 2019-20 season, Texas Tech finished with an 18-13 record, including a tie for third in the Big 12 with a 9-9 mark. The Red Raiders had a pair of top-15 wins, including a victory over No. 1 Louisville, 70-57, at the Jimmy V Classic at Madison Square Garden. Three players earned All-Big 12 recognition, including Second Team and All-Freshman selection Jahmi’us Ramsey. Following the season, Ramsey was drafted No. 43 overall in the 2020 NBA Draft by the Sacramento Kings.\n\nMaligi worked three seasons (2016-19) at Texas A&M for head coach Billy Kennedy, helping the Aggies win 52 games and advance to the 2018 Sweet 16. During their magical run to the Sweet 16, the team defeated Providence and North Carolina before falling to Michigan to cap the 2017-18 season with 22 wins. He helped mentor a pair of All-SEC selections during that time, including Second Team pick Robert Williams III in 2017 and First Team pick Tyler Davis in 2018. Williams was selected as the No. 27 overall pick by the Boston Celtics in the 2018 NBA Draft.\n\nMaligi spent three seasons (2012-15) as an assistant coach at SMU under Hall of Fame head coach Larry Brown. After a 15-17 record in year one, he was part of staff that guided the Mustangs to consecutive 27-win seasons and included trips to the NIT Finals in 2014 and the NCAA Tournament in 2015.\n\nMaligi helped SMU post the third-best turnaround in Division I in his second season with a plus-12-win total, as the Mustangs tallied a 27-10 record and advanced to the 2014 NIT Championship game. The school then took another step in 2014-15, winning the American Athletic Conference regular-season and tournament titles and advancing to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1992-93.\n\nDuring his stint at SMU, Maligi helped coach five American All-Conference selections, including 2015 AAC Player of the Year and two-time First Team pick Nic Moore, 2015 AAC Sixth Man of the Year and two-time Second Team pick Markus Kennedy and 2015 AAC Most Improved Player Yanick Moreira. In addition, three Mustang players who signed during Maligi’s time were later selected in the NBA Draft, including Sterling Brown (No. 46 by the Milwaukee Bucks in 2017), Semi Ojeleye (No. 37 by the Boston Celtics in 2017) and Shake Milton (No. 54 by the Dallas Mavericks in 2018).\n\nIn between his stints at SMU and Texas A&M, Maligi worked as the national scouting director for John Lucas Enterprises in Houston for one year (2015-16). In his role, he helped identify, evaluate and skill train talented players from across the country. He also served as the camp director for all of Lucas’ fifth through 12th grade camps and mentored student-athletes who participated in the drug rehabilitation program.\n\nMaligi spent two seasons (2010-12) at Houston under head coach James Dickey. His recruiting prowess was on full display while at Houston, as he played a role in building the school’s top 20 recruiting class that included a pair of ESPN top-100 signees in Danrad “Chicken” Knowles and 2012-13 Conference USA Freshman of the Year Danuel House. He also recruited TaShawn Thomas, an ESPN top-100 recruit, who earned C-USA All-Freshman Team honors in 2011-12 and was a First Team selection in 2012-13.\n\nMaligi had a highly productive three-year stint (2007-10) at Stephen F. Austin, where he helped the Lumberjacks post a 73-23 (.760) record, including a 37-11 (.771) mark in league play, to go along with a pair of Southland Conference regular-season championships (2008, 2009) and one tournament title (2009). The team advanced to the postseason twice, including the first-ever trips to the NIT (2008) and the NCAA Tournament (2009) in the school’s Division I era.\n\nMaligi coached several All-SLC performers, including the 2008 and 2009 SLC Players of the Year in Josh Alexander and Matt Kingsley, respectively, as well as 2011 All-SLC First-Team selection Jereal Scott and 2019 All-SLC Second Team honoree Eddie Williams. Alexander and Kingsley were also tabbed honorable mention All-Americans.\n\nMaligi began his coaching career as an assistant under head coach Scott Cross at UT Arlington in 2006-07. He accepted the job at 21 years old making him the youngest Division I assistant coach in the country at that time. While at UTA, he helped to recruit Boston College transfer and 2009-10 SLC Player of the Year and All-America honorable mention Marquez Haynes. Haynes had his jersey retired at UTA in January 2022.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2006, Maligi served as a coach of the Dallas Mustangs AAU program. During his stint, the program saw more than 50 of its players sign National Letters of Intent with NCAA Division I teams, including high school All-Americans Byron Eaton (Oklahoma State) and Anthony Randolph (LSU). In addition, he coached Donald Sloan (Texas A&M) and Wesley Johnson (Syracuse), who played 10 seasons in the NBA, as well as notable athletes Austin Jackson (9-year MLB player) and Michael Crabtree (11-year NFL player).\n\nMaligi spent three seasons (2002-05) as the head manager at Howard under head coach Frankie Allen. He assisted the Bison coaching staff in film exchange, on-campus recruiting, assisting in academic monitoring, coordinating pregame and postgame meals and selecting and supervising all student managers.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nMaligi graduated cum laude from Howard University with a bachelor’s degree in exercise physiology in 2006.\n\nA native of Arlington, Texas, Maligi and his wife, Dr. Courtney Maligi, have a son, Justin. The couple welcomed a daughter - Maleah Jaii Maligi - on December 7, 2023.\n\nCoaching Experience\n\nAssistant Coach, UT-Arlington, 2006-07\n\nAssistant Coach, Stephen F.
