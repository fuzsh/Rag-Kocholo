        "text": "Yao hired former Oklahoma State point guard John Lucas III, who played with him in Houston, and former Rockets teammate Garrett Siler to help rebuild the Sharks. Yao played for the Sharks from 1997-2002 before leaving for the NBA.\n\n\"I have meetings almost every day about the start of the season,” Yao was recently quoted. \"I speak to the coach over there and the general manager. It’s difficult. When I’m a player, to play on the court is tough. But to be the (owner) of a team is another story.\n\n\"You know how to play basketball. But building a team is another story. I can’t say I know it. You have to trust other people to build a team.”\n\nYao is undergoing a year-long, tedious rehabilitation process. He underwent surgery last summer after suffering a hairline fracture in his left foot in a May 8 playoff game against the Lakers.\n\nThe injury raised concerns, especially in China, whether the 7-foot-6, six-time All-Star’s career was in jeopardy. Having moved to a smaller, removable boot and doing some light walking — 15 minutes on a treadmill — Yao is confident he will play next season.\n\n\"My weight is up and down but my (mood) is not,” Yao said. \"I try not to just focus on rehab every day. I try to do a little more — more reading, more listening to music. I try to learn more in the time I have, strengthen my mind.”"
