        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nVery quick, and provides an instant spark when in the game. An efficient ball-handler and an active and talented distributor who can also score well from the mid-range 3-point arc. Does a nice job breaking down his man, drawing defenders, and dishing off to teammates. Highly undersized (in both height and bulk) and would benefit by finding a way to take higher-percentage shots. Defensively challenged: can be posted up and isn't a big steals guy. Mostly a non-factor on the boards."
