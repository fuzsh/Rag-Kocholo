        "text": "There are a lot of things Jai Lucas isn't.\n\nHe's not his brother's keeper or even his brother's namesake. His mother absolutely refused his dad's wishes to give him the first name Jonathan out of respect for his older brother and former Oklahoma State star John Lucas III. Debbie Lucas also didn't like the spelling of Jay, so she went with a more unique spelling.\n\nHe made recruiting visits to OSU, Florida, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Maryland but didn't follow his brother to Stillwater because he \"wanted to carve my own way.\"\n\nHe's not the next Mike Miller at Florida. That's because he left the Gators after one season out of hurt feelings over being switched from shooting guard to point guard despite a strong rookie season that landed him on the All-SEC Freshman Team.\n\nHe isn't very tall but can reach 5-10 with his sneakers on. He blames that on his 5-foot-3-inch mother, claiming his 5-9 sister Tarvia robbed all the good height genes to become a strong hoopster at Lower Merion, Pa., a decent cradle of basketball prowess.\n\nHe's not the next A.J. Abrams either. He's maybe an inch shorter than one of the most prolific scorers and three-point shooters in Texas and Big 12 history, but he can sure fill a basket like the departed star.\n\nAsked if he's the second coming of Abrams, Lucas said, \"I wouldn't want to say that.\"\n\nHis shot isn't nearly as pretty as Abrams' automatic offerings. But he has a deadeye aim and a quick release fashioned by his father, John Lucas, who played for 15 NBA seasons and coached at three franchises thereafter.\n\n\"That was a knack my dad drilled into me to get the ball off with less than two seconds,\" Lucas said. \"Longer arms will get to you faster.\"\n\nSo the dad aimed a shooting machine at him for hours upon end when Jai wasn't yet a teenager and his 6-3 father came at him with a broom to press the point upon him.\n\nYes, there are many things the diminutive shooter is not, but Rick Barnes and his team are more than a little excited about what the little guy with the great stroke is.\n\nLucas may well be the best third-string point guard in America. That is not damning with faint praise because he has a shooter's disposition without the ego that usually accompanies such and he can bring to the court an extra dimension, especially on nights like Tuesday when starter Dogus Balbay isn't reminding anyone of Cousy or Stockton.\n\nLucas can shoot as he did Tuesday in draining a team-high five three-pointers in just seven tries in Texas' 95-63 win. He sank both his trey attempts against Michigan State the previous game. He can handle the ball. He knows his place on a club so deep and versatile that it's the Swiss Army knife of college basketball teams.\n\n\"He should shoot it every time he comes off a screen,\" Barnes said. \"You've got to guard him.\"\n\nGardner-Webb tried without success as the smaller Bulldogs ran under screens to give Lucas just the room he needed to get off his shot. He played 15 minutes and remains \"far away\" from reaching optimum conditioning.\n\nThis marked only his third game at Texas since sitting out the required spring semester of 2009 and the first nine games of this season after transferring from Florida.\n\nThere he sank 43.5 percent of his threes and made three treys in five different games. A single exhibition with the Gators cost him an entire year of eligibility, leaving him with half of this season and another next year unless he appeals for more.\n\nHe probably will never be an NBA player at his height. His brother has settled for an overseas career, having left leagues in Spain and Italy to play for the Shanghai Sharks in China where his first game included an audience of Yao Ming and Jackie Chan. They talk frequently.\n\nTexas will be happy with what it has now: an explosive scorer who could be a defensive liability if he allows trapping big players to get to him before he can get off a pass or a shot. He knows he has to be smart to stay on the court because he's not an ankle-breaking point guard like T.J. Ford or D.J. Augustin who will get to the basket or dazzle an opponent with passes.\n\nHis three-point accuracy makes him a valuable weapon, especially coming off the bench to relieve Balbay and second-string point guard J'Covan Brown. Both wingman Jordan Hamilton and Brown can probably shoot better than Lucas, but the three of them engage in some spirited contests after practice.\n\n\"I'd say it's a three-way tie,\" Lucas said.\n\nHe converted only 71 percent of his free throws at Florida but made 92 percent of them in the final two minutes of games. If that continues, he could find himself on the floor late in games because Balbay makes a free throw every other month with a 44 percent clip that would make a head coach cringe.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I'm a pure scorer, but I'm the type who can hurt you if you lay off me,\" Lucas said. \"I'm not trying to define myself as anything. I just want to be a steady, reliable piece.\"\n\nAnd Texas will gladly settle for that.\n\nkbohls@statesman.com; 445-3772"
