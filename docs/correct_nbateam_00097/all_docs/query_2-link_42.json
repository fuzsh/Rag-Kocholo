        "text": "We first spoke with 2024 forward Bryson McGlothin back in December 2022, at the Capitol City Classic in Salem, OR. At 6’7”, McGlothin stood out with his touch from deep and near the hoop, his rebounding ability, and his length on defense. Our staff was able to see him once more in January at his high school, John Paul II, in Plano, TX in a 75-66 win over Parish Episcopal. With John Paul II having a roster prominent with 2024 and 2025 prospects, they were still able to reach the state final before losing to Prestonwood Christian.\n\nStarting his AAU season with Texas Impact 4:13, McGlothin played his first two sessions in the Under Armour Association before joining John Lucas III’s team, JL3. Able to establish a role with both programs, McGlothin has since received offers from Holy Cross, George Mason, and most recently San Francisco. Interest is still accumulating and with JL3 having qualified for the Peach Jam, McGlothin has more opportunity to show college coaches what he brings to the table.\n\nIn this interview with Pro Insight’s Michael Visenberg, we talked about his growth over the past several months, his junior season at JPII, the latest with his recruitment, his goals moving forward, and much more.\n\nFor the next installment of the Pro Insight Q&A series, we present 2024 prospect Bryson McGlothin, from Plano, Texas:\n\nPro Insight: What do you feel you have improved the most since the last time we had a chance to talk?\n\nBryson McGlothin: I think I've improved in a lot of areas but since the last time we talked, I also feel like my role has changed. At school I need to do quite a lot for my team. For my AAU team it’s a little bit different — I still get to show my versatility but I’m running the rim some time or may get out on the wing. You know, the ball is not in my hands as much. I think I’ve improved my shooting ability, mid-range, and threes. I think I've improved my finishing, being able to get to the rim and even getting some dunks. I have also grown defensively.\n\nPI: How have you gone about improving in these areas?\n\nBM: Working out, training, trying to get into the weight room. I have gained about eight pounds since the last time we talked.\n\nPI: What has your training schedule been like during the spring?\n\nBM: Yeah so, I try to get in the weight room at least three or four times a week. Making sure I have 500 made shots every day. With my individual workouts, incorporating defensive drills with ball handling, and focused on improving my vertical with plyometrics.\n\nPI: Who are some of the people that you train with? Do you have a particular trainer or do you train with your team?\n\nBM: Yeah, so sometimes I work out with my team. I don't have a trainer right now at the moment — I was working out with Randy Duck but he’s had some time off because he had shoulder injuries and was getting surgery. I've been working out with my pops, I have some teammates I like to work out with. I have also been doing weights with John Paul II’s strength coach Jermaine Love, he played linebacker at Arkansas.\n\nPI: How was the rest of your season with John Paul II since we last saw you in January? Talk about the highs and lows, what you learned, etc.\n\nBM: Yeah, so since we last talked, we went back home, and we had our district schedule. We did well in district, we finished second. So, they gave us an automatic bid to get into the playoffs. We had some good district wins, we lost to Prestonwood Christian, and those two games were some lows. I think we were confident, knowing that we had played them twice and we had a blueprint of how to beat them, knowing we were going to see them again in the playoffs. Come playoff time we had two good quarterfinal and semifinal games against Central Catholic and Saint Thomas respectively. After those solid wins, we met Prestonwood Christian in the championship and we came up a little short. But it was really a good run and it was fun. We also showed a little bit of what we can do, and I think we got better between that time we were up there in Oregon for the Capitol City Classic. When we got back it changed because we were playing more for each other, and we all really wanted to win. That was a big part of the reason we made a good run at the end of the season.\n\nPI: Talk a little bit about how the Under Armour Association season went for you?\n\nBM: The team started the first UAA session in Phoenix, AZ, I think at first people were kind of sleeping on us because they didn't know what we had. We came in and shocked some people, we went 5-0 and were tied for first after that first weekend. You know we looked really good, and I think one of the biggest things about our culture is we wanted to win. Everybody values winning over whatever we have going on personally. I think when winning is the team goal you know, we were all humble enough to you know make the sacrifices that it takes. That is the culture we wanted to bring. At the second session in South Carolina, the team went 2-2, so our record after two sessions was 7-2, which had us at second or third in the UAA.\n\nPI: What are some things you learned from your time with Texas Impact 4:13?\n\nBM: I learned a lot from my teammates on and off the court. Off the court we're all really close and you know we like to be around each other, like genuine friends. So, I've learned about them in that way. On the court, they taught me how to play the game the right way, you know, sharing the ball, spacing. I had a lot of teammates here that leave it all out there, and that energy has really rubbed off on me.\n\nPI: What were some of the toughest matchups you faced in UAA and what made them so tough?\n\nBM: So, a lot of the games have been battles but I will use the two games that we lost. We lost to Team Thrill, which was tough because they have Derik Queen, and it was a tough match-up size-wise to try to stop and contain him. We lost to West Coast Elite narrowly and with them the game slowed down and we like to play at a really fast pace. They kind of slowed us down a little bit and we weren’t able to knock down shots. Team Thrill and West Coast Elite were both tough matchups.\n\nPI: And what do you feel your role was for Texas Impact 4:13 and how does it differ from your role with John Paul II?\n\nBM: My role on the team was pretty much to be a do everything guy. Knock down shots, when need be, guard positions 1 through 4, sometimes even the 5. Attack the rim and space the floor out, so pretty much my job is to do a little bit of everything. In school, the ball goes through me even more, I have to score a little bit more, rebound even more. I'm the biggest kid on my school team, so my role steps up a little bit more. During AAU, I'm playing with a lot of other good players, and it brings more balance, sacrifice.\n\nPI: What are some of the things that you feel you really bring to the game if your shot is not falling?\n\nBM: If my shot is not falling, you are always going to get defense out of me and energy. I feel like I know how to create for my teammates, and I can still get to the rim when my shot is not falling, so I take pride in that.\n\nPI: How was your first EYBL session with JL3?\n\nBM: So, my first session went well and I thought it was a pretty good first weekend. Started it off and we beat Pro Skills, I had a pretty good game — I had 11 and 5, I believe. The transition has been really smooth with them and they already have a good culture. It was easy for me to just fit right in. There was some struggle like just dealing with the faster game, physicality, and then like the NBA rules. For instance, the further back three-point line, 24 second shot clock, defensive three-second rule, just stuff like that. It was a little bit of an adjustment, some bumps, but other than that a strong first weekend.\n\nPI: What prompted the move to JL3?\n\nBM: There were some off-the-court things we were not really comfortable with and this felt like a better opportunity to be recruited and seen in EYBL.\n\nPI: What has been the big difference between UAA and EYBL?\n\nBM: I think the games are a bit faster but also the teams are bigger. The game is more physical, and the referees let you get away with a little bit more. You have to come tougher and that has really been the biggest thing.\n\nPI: Have you been able to work out with people from your team, so far? And how have you fit in with your new teammates?\n\nBM: Yeah, so before this first weekend we had one practice where we had five out of nine players. Then we had a walkthrough where we had eight out of nine guys, so it has been around two hours of practice with them before the first session. Teammates are spread out location wise, so it's hard to get workouts in like that. I do like playing with them and it has been smooth just because I feel like they all play the right way. So, not only are they skilled, but they make the extra pass and I like to make those same passes to them. It has been a smooth transition.\n\nPI: In terms of the rest of the EYBL play, what are your goals and how do you feel you fit on this new team?\n\nBM: Yeah, so for the rest of the sessions I want to keep improving and just getting better. Looking at this first session as information. Use it as a guideline to become a better rebounder, be more efficient and handle the ball better. Those are the three things right now in my sights to become better at. As far as my role on the team, my job is to come in and be a threat on the wing. Defending at a high level, rebounding, knocking down open shots, getting to the rack, that was what my role is as a 3.\n\nPI: And what's the latest with your recruitment — can you talk a bit about your new offers and who you are hearing from?\n\nBM: Recently I have had two new offers from Holy Cross and George Mason. Some other schools I am hearing from include Abilene Christian, Virginia, South Dakota, Colorado, Air Force, and Virginia Tech. (Note: McGlothin has since picked up an offer from San Francisco)\n\nPI: You took a visit during the high school season, right? How did that go?\n\nBM: I took an unofficial visit to Sam Houston State, and it went well. They treated me well, hospitality, I got to see the team play and meet all of them. It was a good environment and I enjoyed it.\n\nPI: Any visits planned in the next little while?\n\nBM: I'm going to be taking my official visit to Rice, coming up soon.\n\nPI: Are there any more schools you would like to hear from?\n\nBM: I would like to maybe hear from North Carolina State — and Washington State is supposed to reach out, I would like to hear from them. Also, maybe some more California schools.\n\nPI: Is staying close to home a factor for you and what are some of the biggest factors going into your decision?\n\nBM: I'm not opposed to leaving home. Some factors that go into it: I want to be in a place where academics are prioritized just like athletics, just so I can be pursuing a good degree while I'm also playing; I want to go where I am wanted, where I can be developed, and you know just be somewhere that I can make an impact.\n\nPI: Is there anything you are leaning toward in terms of a major?\n\nBM: I have been thinking about sports management. Who knows how long I will be playing, but I would like to stay in basketball after I am done playing.\n\nPI: Who have you been relying upon most throughout your recruitment?\n\nBM: My parents and my coaches. Both of my parents went to college at Southern Mississippi, and so I ask them for advice. Plus I get advice and can go to my coaches.\n\nPI: What kind of system do you feel best fits your playing style?\n\nBM: I feel like one of my best traits is that I can fit within a lot of systems. But I think maybe a system where they are like four or five-out, drawing the defense out of the paint and spreading the floor. Where a lot of people are out on the perimeter and maybe they have one inside or interchanging with another player — a system that is spaced out and allows people to work and move.\n\nPI: Having watched you multiple times, we would agree — that would be an ideal system for you to play in. What type of coaching do you feel gets the best out of you as a player?\n\nBM: I can be coached hard. My school coach and my AAU coach are quite different. My school coach is more laid back at times, but he can be loud and intense. My AAU coach is a more in-your-face type of coach. I've had both types of coaching and I can handle both.\n\nPI: How have coaches recruiting you talked about how you’ll fit in at the college level?\n\nBM: I think the majority of coaches see me as a 3 and maybe a stretch-4. Be a do-everything guy like my role now, be on the ball, provide versatility.\n\nBM: My motivation just comes from, I kind of make it myself. From the inside, on how much I enjoy the game. I think my love for basketball has just motivated me to keep going and keep working at it.\n\nPI: And what are some of your goals for your senior season of high school?\n\nBM: My senior season I want all of my numbers to improve in terms of points, rebounds and assists. I also really want to seal the deal and win the state championship next year. We came up short last year and were runner-up, so I need that ring next year!\n\nPI: Can you talk about your approach in order to achieve that goal?\n\nBM: I think it starts with what we do right now. If we start preparing now, I think that gives us the best shot. Making sure we are working on our bodies because I feel like there were times throughout the year where we were getting pushed around. The stronger we get, hopefully we can meet the teams that are pushing people around. Making sure guys are in the gym because I know when I do, I create that example and it makes other guys want to get into the gym. So I am really trying to set an example and make a winning culture.\n\nPI: Where do you feel you've grown most as a team leader and where do you feel you can improve?\n\nBM: As a team leader I have come to realize that I need to have a different approach for different teammates in terms of types of leadership. For example, I may have a teammate that's more receptive to encouragement, like telling them “let’s go!” and turning them up. In some cases, you have some who you might need to be more aggressive with in getting their energy up. I think just knowing that not everyone is the same and zoning in on those differences to be most receptive to what drives individual teammates and gets them going. I can improve in terms of when things get hard, I can get a little quiet, but I am working on staying vocal and staying focused on what I am supposed to do.\n\nPI: Lastly, what are four words that you would use to best describe yourself?"
