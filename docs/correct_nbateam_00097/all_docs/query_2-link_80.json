        "text": "To get down to the NBA roster maximum of 15 players, the Minnesota Timberwolves waived Rasual Butler and Toure Murry. This means that former Oklahoma State Cowboy John Lucas III has made the cut and will start this season off as a member of the Timberwolves.\n\nLucas III has been in and out of the NBA since his career started in Houston in 2005. He spent some time last year in the NBA D-League and the Puerto Rican League, but has found his way back onto an NBA roster. Lucas III has averaged 4.8 points and 1.5 assists in 12.3 minutes per game in his NBA Career.\n\nThis is great news for JLIII. Best of luck to him this season!"
