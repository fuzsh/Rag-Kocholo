        "text": "STARKVILLE, Miss. | When Lawrence Roberts thinks about the bizarre and tragic events that led him to transfer from Baylor to Mississippi State, it all still seems so surreal.\n\nOne of his former Baylor teammates was charged with murdering another, then came the discovery of NCAA violations and allegations the coach tried to cover up the improprieties by besmirching the reputation of the dead player.\n\n\"Basically, it was overwhelming. It was shocking,\" Roberts said. \"To this day, sometimes I'll look at some of the things on the news that they have about it, and I still can't believe everything that happened.\n\n\"It definitely seemed like it was one of those bad movies.\"\n\nRoberts found a new basketball home at Mississippi State, filling the team's pressing need for a big man, and is leading the No. 19 Bulldogs (15-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) to their best start ever.\n\nRoberts was the best of several Baylor players who decided to transfer after last year's scandal, which was sparked by the shooting death of Patrick Dennehy.\n\nNot long after Dennehy's badly decomposed body was found in July, teammate Carlton Dotson was charged with his death (he has pleaded innocent).\n\nBaylor coach Dave Bliss resigned in August after acknowledging he broke NCAA rules by making payments to Dennehy and another player. An assistant coach secretly recorded audio tapes of Bliss telling him to portray Dennehy as a drug dealer.\n\nThe NCAA waived a rule that would have required Roberts and the other Bears to sit out a year after transferring from one Division I school to another.\n\nThe choice for Roberts came down to Arizona and Mississippi State. After a visit to Starkville in August, Roberts canceled his trip to Tucson and signed with the Bulldogs.\n\nThe 6-foot-9, 235-pound power forward was like manna from heaven for coach Rick Stansbury, who lost his best post player and top recruit to the NBA draft.\n\n\"The biggest thing to me was the fit,\" Roberts said. \"It was one of those things where I could step right in and they wouldn't miss a beat.\"\n\nMario Austin led Mississippi State in scoring and rebounding two straight seasons before deciding to skip his senior year. McDonald's All-American Travis Outlaw, another 6-9 forward, also bailed out on the Bulldogs for the draft.\n\n\"We needed somebody who could play on the inside,\" Stansbury said. \"So we knew it was going to be a great fit from our team's standpoint because what our team needed he gave to us.\"\n\nRoberts might even be an upgrade over the burly Austin.\n\n\"Lawrence doesn't have that same presence, but he's more versatile,\" the coach said. \"You can get him the basketball a little easier and he can go get a basketball with his great athleticism and quickness.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for Roberts to wow his new teammates.\n\nBulldogs forward Branden Vincent got his first look at Roberts during a pickup game.\n\n\"I knew he was going to be good because one time he got free and dunked the ball and it was like, you just don't see a 6-9 athlete like that everyday. He got so high, I said, 'Man, this guy's got to be a player,\"' Vincent recalled.\n\nHeading into this weekend, Roberts was leading the Bulldogs in scoring (16.5) and rebounding (10.8). His dominant 21-point, 14-rebound performance in a decisive win at Florida on Wednesday was his 11th double-double.\n\nWhile basketball clearly drove Robert's decision, Mississippi State and the small town of Starkville was also the right place for a guy hoping to keep a low profile.\n\nMississippi State shielded Roberts from the media until just before the start of the season, which might not have been as easy at a place like Arizona.\n\n\"Anytime you can go somewhere and its a calmer atmosphere -- you can kind of escape the situation you were just in -- that's always a positive thing,\" the Houston native said.\n\nRoberts still keeps in touch with his former Baylor teammates, including John Lucas III, who transferred to Oklahoma State, and Kenny Taylor, who moved on to Texas.\n\nRoberts' mother, Cynthia, has been keeping a close eye on her son. She has been to every Mississippi State home game, usually making a 91/2-hour drive from Houston.\n\nCynthia Roberts watched Lawrence get 44 points and 25 rebounds in back-to-back games against Arkansas and Kentucky, but it wasn't the numbers that provided her a sense of relief.\n\n\"He had the fire. He had the intensity,\" she said. \"That's when I knew he had arrived.\n\n\"I don't have to worry about him anymore.\""
