        "text": "Florida guard Jai Lucas , the son of former NBA player and coach John Lucas and brother of former Oklahoma State player John Lucas III, has decided to transfer.\n\nThe point guard and his mother met with Gators coach Billy Donovan on Wednesday.\n\nLucas is a sophomore and from Bellaire, Texas, and averaged 8.5 points last season and led the Gators in 3-point shooting. He started all 36 games last season and the team's first exhibition game Monday night.\n\nFreshmen Erving Walker and Ray Shipman are competing with Lucas for playing time and highly regarded recruit Kenny Boynton has committed to Florida next season and it looked like Lucas' minutes might fall.\n\nLucas was recruited in high school by both Oklahoma State University and Oklahoma.\n\nOREGON STATE: Now that his brother-in-law is headed for the White House, Craig Robinson turns his focus to his own campaign as coach of an Oregon State team in serious need of change.\n\nRobinson was in Chicago on Tuesday night to celebrate Barack Obama 's victory, appearing onstage at the victory rally at Grant Park. Michelle Obama 's big brother was back in Corvallis on Wednesday for practice with the Beavers.\n\n\"It doesn't get much better than that,\" he said of the trip. \"Although I would imagine that winning a Pac-10 championship would feel pretty good right about now.\"\n\nRobinson is embarking on his first season as head coach of Oregon State. The Beavers went 6-25 last season, including 0-18 in the Pac-10.\n\nHe came to Oregon State from Brown, where he had been coach for two years and went 30-28. The Bears went 19-10 last season."
