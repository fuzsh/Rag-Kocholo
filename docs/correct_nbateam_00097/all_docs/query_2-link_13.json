        "text": "STILLWATER His head bowed, John Lucas III's body language was as revealing as his words.\n\nThe subject was Baylor's tumultuous summer. Lucas was at his parents' home in Houston when he heard teammate Patrick Dennehy was missing. One month later Dennehy's body was found July 25 with two gunshot wounds to the head. Baylor teammate Carlton Dotson has been charged with murder and is awaiting trial.\n\nAfter the news broke, Lucas stayed in Houston. He has never returned to Waco.\n\n\"We really didn't have any problems on the team that I knew of,\" Lucas said. \"(Dotson) got along with everybody. When I heard who the suspect was, I was like, 'Nah, I don't believe that. That's just rumors.' When he turned himself in, I was shocked.\n\n\"Every time I think about it, it's like a movie,\" he said. \"It's hard to talk about. It hasn't hit me as much as those who were on campus. But I don't want to ever go through something like that again. I've been trying to stay busy and move on with my life.\"\n\nLucas left the Baylor program and moved to Stillwater. This season he will play for Oklahoma State\n\nOSU coaches and teammates said Lucas hasn't talked about Dennehy and Dotson. Senior forward Ivan McFarlin, also from the Houston area, played AAU basketball one summer with Lucas. McFarlin lobbied Lucas to transfer to OSU.\n\n\"I think it's sort of like what happened to us with the plane crash,\" McFarlin said. \"It was something we had to deal with and was always on our hearts. But we had to move on. He doesn't bring it up. He's trying to move on and establish himself with a new team.\"\n\nWhen the NCAA announced Baylor players could transfer without sitting out one season, Lucas' first choice was OSU. He knew McFarlin. Lucas loved the Gallagher-Iba Arena atmosphere. He adored coach Eddie Sutton.\n\nBut Lucas had to wait for a Big 12 ruling. Once league officials announced Baylor players could transfer and play immediately without losing a year's eligibility, Lucas enrolled at OSU.\n\nLucas has been on campus only six weeks but already has developed a bond with his new teammates.\n\n\"I have nothing against Baylor,\" Lucas said. \"I loved my two years there. But it's time for me move on and play my heart out for coach Sutton and OSU. I loved coach Sutton the last two years, and I didn't even play for him. He really enjoys coaching and cares about his players.\n\n\"I'm a Cowboy. I bleed orange. Some people say, 'How can you change that quickly?' This is my school now. This is home. I love it here.\"\n\nWhat happened at Baylor convinced Lucas to change his approach to relationships. At Baylor, he often returned home to Houston. Since he arrived at OSU, he's spent much of his free time with Tony Allen and other teammates.\n\n\"It's more like a family atmosphere here,\" Lucas said. \"That played a big part in my decision. Going through something like I did this summer, not getting to know somebody like you want to, you look at life differently. I want to get to know everybody on this team like they're my brother.\"\n\nMissing Piece OSU needed a point guard during the off-season. The Cowboys got one in Lucas, who averaged 4.3 assists in his two seasons at Baylor.\n\n\"When I first saw him, I really didn't think he'd be able to do anything because he was so small,\" said Joey Graham, a newcomer expected to play a major role. \"But he's proved (in pick-up games) he can play. I think he's the missing piece to this puzzle.\"\n\nAt 5-foot-10, Lucas is OSU's smallest player, but that shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\"People may think his size is a weakness, but he can really shoot and is a good point guard,\" said former Baylor teammate Kenny Taylor, who transferred to Texas. \"He has the heart of a champion. Most point guards look to distribute. He can do both which makes him hard to defend.\"\n\nAt Baylor, coaches asked Lucas to be a scorer. At OSU, Lucas' first responsibility will be to run the offense.\n\nLike his father, John Lucas Jr., an NBA point guard for 14 seasons, Lucas III has tremendous knowledge of the game.\n\n\"The way he sees the floor is awesome,\" said center Frans Steyn. \"The first day he came everyone wondered if it would take time for him to fit in. But right away he opened the floor and gave guys wide open shots. Sometimes I'm so wide open I don't know what to do with it.\"\n\nLucas can score, too. He led the state of Texas in scoring (30.2 points) his senior year at Houston Bellaire High School and averaged 11.0 assists. Lucas averaged 13.2 points both seasons at Baylor.\n\n\"He's a terrific shooter,\" associate head coach Sean Sutton said. \"We thought he was a good shooter, but he's even better than we thought. It's unbelievable how hard he worked this summer with his father. He's a better player in our eyes right now than what we expected.\"\n\nSurrounded by talented players, Lucas predicts his assist and scoring averages will increase. His ideal point guard is a scorer like Stephon Marbury, an assist specialist like Jason Kidd or T.J. Ford and a defensive stopper like Gary Payton.\n\n\"I want to be the point guard you can never figure out,\" Lucas said. \"That's how my dad raised me. You try to cut me off this way, I've got a move to go that way. Coach Sutton is a defensive fanatic. Everybody always had me more offensive-minded. But I can play defense. I can lock you down.\"\n\nNBA dream One night when Lucas was in the sixth grade, his mother, Debbie, was tucking him in bed. Lucas was dreaming. The next morning she informed her son he was talking in his sleep about playing in an NBA game.\n\n\"That's all I've ever wanted since I was 2 years old,\" Lucas said. \"It's my dream.\"\n\nHis father was the first player selected in the 1976 draft. Lucas Jr. averaged 10.7 points and 7.0 assists in 928 NBA games.\n\nLucas Jr., a former NBA coach with San Antonio, Philadelphia and Cleveland, knows what it takes. Can his son, labeled too small by some recruiters to play in college, make it to the show?\n\n\"Yes,\" Lucas Jr. said. \"He needs to get stronger. He tells me OSU has the greatest weight room he's ever seen, so he'll have no problems getting stronger. His defense needs to improve, but coach Sutton and his staff can help him there. This year and next year are his important years, helping OSU get where they want and to help himself.\"\n\nFitting in with the Cowboys, regardless of how many games they win, could be just what Lucas needs.\n\nHe feels comfortable in his new home.\n\n\"When I came here last year I was like, 'I wish Baylor was like this,' \" Lucas said. \"You can just feel the excitement of the crowd. I loved playing here even when I was on the away team. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to this.\n\n\"I wish the season started tomorrow.\"\n\nArchive ID: 1543832"
