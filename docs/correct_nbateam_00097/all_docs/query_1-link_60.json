        "text": "Happy June. Hope you all are staying hydrated and relaxed as the offseason kicks into high gear.\n\nThe draft is less than three weeks away. Free agency is inching closer. You have questions. Hopefully, I have some answers. Let’s dive in.\n\nHow likely is it that Ime (Udoka) brings back Mahmoud Abdelfattah and John Lucas II to fill out the rest of his coaching staff? How many coaches in total do you think he will have? Any potential big names left? — Johann D.\n\nSince assuming his new position, Rockets head coach Ime Udoka has made no secret of his plans to fill out his new staff with several familiar faces from his “coaching tree” of sorts.\n\n“We have some commitments,” he told reporters over the weekend. “And then obviously with some of the guys I brought to Boston, with them finishing up now, I can move along in the process and hopefully bring some of them here as well.”\n\nSimilar to his setup in Boston, I think Udoka will have six main assistant coaches on his staff, not counting the video coordinators and lower-level staffers. Former Brooklyn Nets assistant Royal Ivey was the first to join. While nothing has been officially signed yet, Udoka is confident in bringing in assistants Ben Sullivan, Garrett Jackson and Mike Moser over from Boston, multiple team sources told The Athletic. (The sources were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly). The jury is still out on Celtics assistant Aaron Miles, but is being strongly pursued and is expected to consider joining Udoka as well. In addition, Udoka is pursuing a non-Celtics name to fill out his bench, those sources said.\n\nAs it pertains to the futures of Abdelfattah and Lucas, because the Rockets have opted to keep things vague on the subject, we must attempt to read the tea leaves. These are educated guesses and I’m choosing my words very carefully.\n\nWe’ll start with Lucas. Given his position of influence on the team over the last few years and his track record in player development, there’s probably no one that has a better pulse on the roster. It’s been two months since the regular season ended and Lucas is still quite involved with the team’s day-to-day activities, with Udoka mentioning the former lead assistant has been coordinating Houston’s pre-draft workouts. That means something.\n\nI’ve often said Lucas is grandfathered into the organization, and I still believe that. He commands a great deal of respect from players and front-office executives alike and does a good job of maximizing his role. Even if Udoka goes a different direction with his official coaching staff, I could see Lucas remaining with the organization in some capacity, perhaps in a role akin to a front-office liaison.\n\nAs for Abdelfattah: As I reported earlier, he spent time with the team during the draft combine last month in Chicago, but he also had numerous conversations with other teams and has legitimate interest elsewhere. Given his relationship with Houston’s young players and his coaching ability — his offensive acumen was often praised while he worked under former coach Stephen Silas — Abdelfattah would be a nice name and a familiar face to bridge the past and the future. But if Udoka is successful in bringing in his primary targets, Abdelfattah’s future might be on another team’s sidelines.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhat the Sam Cassell hire signals about Joe Mazzulla’s Celtics coaching staff\n\nKelly, when you play with the trade machine, do you put on a lab robe and wear a wig to act like a mad scientist? — Jose J.\n\nI could have explained the premise a bit more because a lot of nuance got lost in translation, but I’ll admit I got a little crazy with those proposals! My bad. I’ll take that one on the chin.\n\nWould the Rockets package No. 20 and Kenyon Martin Jr. or Jae’Sean Tate to move up to like 10th? And if so, for what player? — Dorian G.\n\nI’m not sure if something like that would appeal to Dallas, especially for a top-10 pick. The Mavericks are in this weird spot where they’re too talented to not push their chips in and compete, but they’re also not good enough as currently constructed to go far in the playoffs and are somewhat limited with their flexibility. Western Conference purgatory. As talented as players like Kenyon Martin Jr. and Jae’Sean Tate are, the Mavericks could probably get a better win-now veteran by moving the 10th pick in the draft.\n\nI do, though, like the concept of packaging No. 20 with a player caught in Houston’s wing logjam to possibly upgrade elsewhere. This is something the Rockets are considering as well as the draft edges closer.\n\nBrook Lopez is a free agent Houston likes. But let’s say, for example, the Bucks are hell-bent on retaining his services and are more inclined to give him long-term security than a team like the Rockets. That would mean Houston would need to pivot toward other options. If, for example, the front office already has strong signals James Harden would return — and given what Udoka mentioned about seeking different types of big men — does offering Martin and No. 20 make sense for Atlanta’s Clint Capela? Maybe Indiana’s Myles Turner? That’s the kind of structure I would think about if it ever came down to actually moving the pick.\n\nAre there any realistic pathways for the Rockets to trade up to No. 3 if Scoot Henderson is still there? — Matt H.\n\nHenderson’s workout in front of the Blazers brass over the weekend made quite the impression on social media, particularly with a Rockets fanbase that is enamored with the young, gifted point guard. It’s a safe bet to assume the Spurs are drafting Victor Wembanyama. After that, it’s wide open. There seems to be a difference of opinion regarding what the Charlotte Hornets should opt for Henderson or take Alabama’s Brandon Miller at No. 2. With Portland then up at No. 3, where does that leave Houston?\n\nBased on all of the pre-draft conversations, I’d be shocked if Miller was on the board when the Rockets are on the clock (I have him going second overall.) But if Henderson is there at three, I assume the Blazers will take him, unless there was a surefire trade to get Damian Lillard some much-needed help. The “Mikal Bridges for No.3 and Anfernee Simons” chatter refuses to go away no matter how much the Nets might shoot it down. But if those are the types of deal structures that interest Portland, I’m not sure if Houston has enough to compete with that.\n\nNow, if the Blazers were willing to start over and move on from Lillard, the Rockets have enough assets to start a conversation — No. 4 and maybe a future first. But that only happens if Houston deems Henderson that much better than a lower-ranked prospect like Amen Thompson to warrant giving up premium assets. I’m not sure if they consider the talent gap that wide enough.\n\nWould Harden really be a help or a hindrance? If they do sign Harden (or believe they will), then assuming they keep the No. 4 pick, who should they use it on? — Glen N.\n\nI’m not one of those folks calling the league leader in assists a hindrance. Anyone who has watched this team labor to create sustainable offense over the past two seasons knows the importance of structure and organization, two things Harden certainly brings to the floor. Players like Jalen Green and Jabari Smith Jr. need a lead ball handler and quality playmaker for their development. Even if it’s not Harden, bringing in a veteran point guard will do this team a world of good.\n\nIf they keep the fourth pick, I would go best player available regardless of fit and take either Amen Thompson or Cam Whitmore. Whitmore might be my favorite player in this class but I’d lean towards Amen because of the combination of size, playmaking, athleticism and defense. We actually might not be talking about this kid enough, man. He’s a freak of nature.\n\nFor those among the fanbase who are not in love with the idea of trading away the fourth pick plus one of Jalen/Jabari/Al-P (not to mention future firsts) for someone of the Jaylen Brown ilk, what is a realistic combination of pick at No. 4 plus free agency that would position us to be competitive this year and push for a play-in spot? I can’t help but wonder if some of the ancillary young guys could be packaged to help bring in some experience and shooting. —Josh L.\n\nIt all comes back to free agency. The Rockets plan to bring in three to four veterans this summer to surround their young core and continue to improve. By young core, I’m referring to the quartet of Green, Smith, Tari Eason and Alperen Şengün.\n\nI think Harden, Lopez and Dillon Brooks would push the Rockets into that conversation. I’d rather have Cam Johnson over Brooks, but Brooklyn has an inherent advantage in retaining him because of his restricted free agency status.\n\nA pure hypothetical here — what combo of draft capital and players would it take to get Jaylen Brown in a Rockets uniform? — James C.\n\nI’ve learned my lesson with these. Let’s figure this out. After reading this question, I immediately posed it to my esteemed colleague Jared Weiss, who covers the Celtics.\n\n“Boston’s championship window is now and it’s no longer opening,” Weiss said. “They have a brief moment to strike before they have to start rebuilding and trading for prospects doesn’t make sense right now unless Brad Stevens was lying about believing in this core. So unless it’s a three-way deal to bring in a prime superstar and move Houston’s top assets like Green and the fourth pick elsewhere, I don’t see Boston being interested.”\n\nSo there you have it. The Celtics probably don’t want Green and picks. The Rockets probably don’t want to mortgage a huge chunk of assets like Smith and Eason as well. You’re better off just waiting for next summer, when Brown will hit free agency if he doesn’t sign an extension in the next 12 months.\n\n(Top photo: Mike Ehrmann / Getty Images)"
