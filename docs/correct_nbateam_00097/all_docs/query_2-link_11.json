        "text": "May 9, 2001\n\nWACO, Texas - Baylor University has signed John Lucas III, son of former NBA player and coach John Lucas, to a national letter of intent head men's basketball coach Dave Bliss announced Wednesday.\n\nThe younger Lucas, a senior at Bellaire High School in Houston, averaged 30.3 points and 11 assists per game this season and led the city and state of Texas in scoring average.\n\n\"We're glad to have John Lucas as part of our recruiting class,\" Bliss said, \"he brings a wealth of basketball ability and experience to our program.\"\n\nLucas, a 5-11, 165-pound point guard, was a three-year starter and scored more than 3,000 career points at Bellaire under head coach Dave Hudek. He was named first team all-state, all-regional and all-District 17-5A in 2001 as a senior.\n\n\"(Departed senior) DeMarcus Minor was a big part of what we accomplished last season,\" Bliss said, \"and John will compete for the playing time at that same point guard position.\"\n\nAs a junior in 1999-2000, Lucas averaged 18.3 points and led Bellaire to the District 17-5A championship. He was named to the All-District 17-5A first team as a junior. Lucas averaged 21 points as a sophomore in 1998-99.\n\nLucas is listed as the No. 20 recruit in the state by Mike Kunstadt's Texas Hoops. He attended the NBA All-American High School Players Camp as a junior and senior.\n\nAn accomplished tennis player, Lucas was the District 17-5A singles champion and is a former nationally ranked USTA Junior National player. Lucas is also a Texas Scholar, and is active in the Bellaire Student Association and Business Professionals of America.\n\nThe elder Lucas, John Jr., is a former No. 1 NBA draft pick who played 13 seasons in the NBA and ranks 10th in league history in career assists. A current assistant with the Denver Nuggets, he was previously head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers and San Antonio Spurs."
