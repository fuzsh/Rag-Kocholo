Additionally, Jared Dudley, who was basically a player-coach on the bench, will be joining Kidd in Dallas as an assistant.\n\nOne replacement on the staff is David Fizdale, while Mike Penberthy was also promoted to the front of the bench for the first time. While the front of the bench is now full again for the Lakers, they still have one more opening on the staff overall which it appears they have now filled.\n\nAccording to Dave McMenamin of ESPN, the Lakers are hiring former NBA point guard John Lucas III to their staff:\n\nThe Lakers hired John Lucas III to their coaching staff, sources told ESPN.

Miles Simon also assisted with player development and while he is still with the organization, most of his time will be spent as the head coach of the G League affiliate South Bay Lakers.\n\nLucas’ playing career spanned from 2005-2017 after originally going undrafted out of Oklahoma State. In the NBA, he played a total of 242 games with six different teams.\n\nLucas’ coaching career\n\nAfter retiring from playing in 2017, Lucas joined the Minnesota Timberwolves coaching staff with a focus on player development. He remained there as an assistant through 2019, also coaching their Summer League team in 2018.\n\nNow with the Lakers, Lucas has a great opportunity to build on his coaching career with one of the top organizations in the league that will be in the mix to win a championship in 2021-22.\n\nHave you subscribed to our YouTube channel?
