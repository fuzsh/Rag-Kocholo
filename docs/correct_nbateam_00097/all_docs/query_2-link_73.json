        "text": "After a summer the likes of which few of us will ever know - full of betrayal, lies and murder - it took only a few kind words born of the right place to convince John Lucas III where to continue his basketball career.\n\nIn the few short months since the 2002-03 basketball season ended, Lucas had learned that his teammate Patrick Dennehy had been killed, that another teammate, Carlton Dotson, had turned himself in for the murder, and his coach, Dave Bliss, wanted to portray Dennehy as a drug dealer to divert blame.\n\nLucas tried to keep himself busy, stayed at his Houston home and never returned to campus. He found it difficult to talk about the events, and even harder to believe it all. When he visited Oklahoma State, searching for a new basketball home, one thing Lucas knew was that he never wanted to experience anything like Baylor again.\n\nThat's when Lucas met Eddie Sutton.\n\n\"When I went on my visit, he said if I ever needed any place to lean on, he had his shoulder out because he'd been through something like I'd been through,\" Lucas said Friday during preparations for the Final Four in San Antonio, Texas. \"That's what really made me decide to come here. Because he was going to help me no matter what.\"\n\nBy the time Lucas arrived, Sutton had become an expert on healing.\n\nAn alcoholic with a past spotted with NCAA violations and poor graduation rates that at times overshadowed his 755 wins and three Final Four appearances, Sutton knew all too well about tragedies shaping lives.\n\nJust three years ago, the veteran Cowboys coach endured one of the worst tragedies in college sports when a plane carrying two OSU players and eight staff members crashed shortly after taking off during a snow storm east of Denver.\n\nAll aboard were killed, and Sutton says he still thinks daily about freshman Nathan Fleming, junior Daniel Lawson, and all the others lost.\n\n\"The tragedy certainly did affect my life,\" Sutton said. \"It continues to be there. I don't believe there's such a thing as closure. If there is, it's when you die. That crash was such a tragedy for all of us.\"\n\nAnd if there was any place in America that could understand Lucas' frustrations, it was Oklahoma State.\n\nRather than finding teammates preying on each other and coaches viciously willing to paint a negative portrayal, the son of the former Maryland star found a family bound by a loss still fresh in many of their minds, and a coach he felt cared.\n\nFrom a kid who was benched for his last five games of a 14-14 season at Baylor, Lucas quickly fused with his new surroundings, rose to become co-Big XII Player of the Year with teammate Tony Allen, then hit the game-winning 3-pointer last weekend against St. Joseph's to send the Cowboys to the Final Four.\n\nThe season has become a reconciliation, allowing the pain of two pasts to ease. When Oklahoma State beat Texas to win the Big XII title, seniors Ivan McFarlin and Terrence Crawford ó both members of the tragic 2001 team who missed the fateful trip due to ineligibility and injury respectively ó walked up to Sutton.\n\n\"Man, those guys have got to be smiling down,\" they said.\n\nAnd Sutton? Not a day goes by when the former Kentucky and Arkansas coach doesn't walk into Gallagher-Iba Arena or walks by the academic center and sees apparitions of those who died.\n\nSince that snowy day, Sutton began habitually hugging his players and says he calls his three sons each day to say he loves them. He urges his players to call their parents twice per week and do the same.\n\n\"You can be gone tomorrow,\" he said, his gravelly 68-year-old voice cracking. \"And I don't want to leave earth without knowing that my family realizes the great love I have for my wife and children.\"\n\nAt Oklahoma State, the only thing that could overshadow this Final Four appearance is the fresh understanding of tragedy.\n\nBut in each other, the Cowboys have found a sanctuary.\n\nBrian Hendrickson is the Star-News sports editor.
