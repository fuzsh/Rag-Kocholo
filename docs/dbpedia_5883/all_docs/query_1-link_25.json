        "text": "Biodiversity Reporting and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing I’m over the moon to share that as per #Apple’s recent announcement Oxford Nanopore technology is compatible with Apple devices containing M3 silicon chips, which will enable complex analysis required for DNA/RNA sequencing for all biomes, even in remote locations. This opens a whole world of immediate opportunities and makes #nanopore sequencing more accessible to wider population, as this technology is not restricted to human genome sequencing only but, has multiple applications in critical #biodiversitymonitoring. #nanopore is already engaged in good work collaborating on this front with global research organisations. Please see https://lnkd.in/e92fiNhF New Lab In Sri Lanka To Detect Endangered Sharks In Fish Markets (forbes.com) There is no sector that doesn’t benefit directly/indirectly from #naturalresources. And given that the Earth may cross 1.5degrees C this decade, therefore there is a real need to protect our Terra Firma’s biodiversity….I would strongly urge all sustainability professionals in #finance and other industries to start integrating #accounting4nature in their corporate strategies. Please see this really informative video by #TFND that shares common insights on why taking #actionnow on #biodiversity is utterly critical for maintaining #BAU and for #riskmanagement. https://lnkd.in/eWi59rPy If you want to manage your #businessrisks, Lead by example on #sustainability Adopt #impactmanagement Build #natureresilience and accurately report on #BiodiversityKPIs...I strongly suggest that you embrace the guidance provided by #TFND (Task Force for Nature Based Disclosures) and take advantage of exploring #nanopore sequencing technology to accurately report on #biodiversityindicators\n\nThis is Nobel prize level improvement over previous linear models, similar to when attention is all you need was released in 2017. What an amazing invention will do for DNA sequencing is almost umimanginable. Cross creation of fully loaded synthetic chromosomes past 99%. Synthesis of long molecule chains without needing to do quadratic explosion on algorithm length. -Synthesis of compounds using pre-loaded containers in your house on a synthesis machine from premade packets sent to your house (the AI can accurately predict the flavour of the synthesized substance to eat it wthout creating it. -backtracking and storing fresh data on stings in sequence without losing functionaliy. Full Nobel Prize recognition for this discovery.\n\nSo, Mamba is better than transformers for DNA sequencing. This is a significant advancement for agents in the system when recognizing DNA sequencing. Good job! The Mamba Agent code is finally released: Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/dusVymM8 Uses real values as default. Loads the SSM parameters directly from High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to fast SRAM/SOTMRAM (future) where discretization and recurrence are performed, then writes the final results back to HBM. Recomputation is used to reduce memory requirements. Implements a linear long sequencing parallel long scan with efficient memory use. Parameterizes the SSM parameters based on the input. Solves the efficient convolution problem with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model consecutively with a scan instead of convolution. 3x faster on A100 GPUs. Combines SSM with the MLP block of transformers into a single block (Mamba block). Uses selection with Simplified State Space layers for sequencing modeling. The S6 model outperforms GPT++ using SwiGLU, MLP, and RMSN norm with perfect generalization to 1 million sequences. Obviously, you can see where we are going with this...\n\nI am delighted to announce the publication of our research paper titled \"𝐒𝐤𝐢𝐧 𝐋𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐅𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐗𝐆𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐞𝐫,\" in the esteemed 𝙄𝙀𝙀𝙀 𝙎𝙩𝙪𝙙𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙨' 𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙛𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙤𝙣 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙘𝙖𝙡, 𝙀𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣𝙞𝙘𝙨, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙪𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙎𝙘𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 (𝙎𝘾𝙀𝙀𝘾𝙎) 2024.

In the receptron model (a generalization of the perceptron) the weighting of the input stimuli is not just responding separately to each stimulus. Network’s weights are functions of a convolution of the spatial location of the input topology. A receptron has the capability to generate a complete set of Boolean functions (including those non-linearly separable) of n variables for classification tasks, without having been explicitly programmed for that. Practical realizations of the receptron include devices made of a nanostructured metallic film interconnecting a generic pattern of electrical contacts. https://lnkd.in/dv72nWGN #neuromorphic #computing #nanotechnology #boolean #classification #unconventionalcomputing #receptron #neuralnetwork #nanoparticle"
