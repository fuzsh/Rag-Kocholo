        "text": "Index\n\nTo\n\nNinth Report of the Botany Committee\n\nTrans. Devon. Assoc., vol. 49, (1917), pp. 99-108.\n\nby\n\nW.P. Hiern. (Ed.)\n\nPrepared by Michael Steer\n\nThe Committee’s Ninth Report was presented at the Association’s Barnstaple meeting, 25th July, 1917. Botany refers to the scientific study of the physiology, structure, genetics, ecology, distribution, classification, and economic importance of plants. The Association’s Botany Section was founded in 1908 to promote the study and enjoyment of Devon's wild plants, including bryophytes (mosses), lichens and fungi. Their Report can be found in a copy of a rare and much sought-after journal that can be downloaded from the Internet Archive. Google has sponsored the digitisation of books from several libraries. These books, on which copyright has expired, are available for free educational and research use, both as individual books and as full collections to aid researchers.\n\nCommittee Members.\n\nMiss Rose E. Carr-Smith,\n\nThe Hon. Mrs. Mabel Colborne,\n\nMiss Chichester\n\nMr G.T. Harris\n\nMr. W. P. Hiern, (Secretary)\n\nMiss C.E. Larter\n\nMr. C. H. Laycock,\n\nMr. H. G. Peacock,\n\nMiss C. L.
