Wanderer in Love (alternate take)\n\n”Modern Balkan Jazz with folklore roots“\r\n-Mannheimer Morgen-\r\n\r\nMusic from Bulgaria is only rarely acknowledged as contribution to the development of jazz. A lack of knowledge and the absence of opportunities for listening to Bulgarian music foster this valuation. Whoever wanted to hear jazz from the Balkan sphere of influence played with virtuositiy at least had to travel to Vienna. \r\n\r\nAlexander and Konstantin Wladigeroff founded a quintet with which they now can fill this knowledge gap, and this year’s „Inselsommer“ Festival at the beach of Ludwigshafen’s Parkinsel offers them a chance to perform and prove this.\r\n\r\nIn this small, almost family setting a sound spectacle takes place on the Rhein banks; imported Balkan folk dances create lightheartedness, still leaving space for an almost meditative concert atmosphere. In a stirring way, trumpet player Alexander Wladigeroff and his brother Konstantin on the piano combine their pleasure of playing and virtuosity. However, when the saxophonist Andrey Prozorov weaves his technically sophisticated, but still always melodic tone lines into the original compositions, the Wladigeroff band’s sound becomes so dense and intense that even the pitching of passing cargo boats fades into the background. Sure enough, without this rhythmic bed provided by bassist Philipp Moosbrugger, drummer Duchan Novakov, and the Turkish darbuka player Turgay Ucar, the charismatic front men could hardly perform with such confidence.\r\n\r\nUnlike the other musician’s stylistic band, Dimitar Kararmitev is set with the folkloric pieces with his wooden kaval. That sonic sketches of rural ­village fairs are created is due to the characteristic flute sound and stereotype notions rather than to Karamitev’s way of playing. On the one hand, the musicians acoustically document their cultural heritage, on the other hand – with the folk dances based mostly on asymmetrical metres – they embed their other, modern compositions in a kind of recognizablility. Even stubborn purists will excuse a folk dance or more to anybody who performs complex jazz numbers, partly played at a breathtaking pace, with such souvereignity. Within the musical spectrum in this country, the Wladigeroff brothers band is a significant exception. Virtuous, unconventional, and with a pleasure of playing that is not only worth listening to.",
