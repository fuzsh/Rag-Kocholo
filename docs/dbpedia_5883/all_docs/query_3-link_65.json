With the launch of the somewhat translucent inCoris TZI zirconia, Sirona has made possible the computer-assisted design and computer- assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) of monolithic bridges using Cerec dental software. In this article, the possibilities and limitations of inCoris TZI, as well as inCoris TZI C (a recently introduced further development from Sirona), will be demonstrated, based on two clinical cases.\n\nThe Drop Tower Bremen -An Overview\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvon Kampen, Peter; KÃ¶nemann, Thorben; Rath, Hans J.\n\nThe Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) was founded in 1985 as an institute of the University of Bremen, which focuses on research on gravitational and space-related phenomena. In 1988, the construction of ZARM`s drop tower began. Since its inau-guration in September 1990, the eye-catching Drop Tower Bremen with a height of 146m and its characteristic glass roof has become twice a landmark on the campus of the University of Bremen and the emblem of the technology park Bremen. As such an outstanding symbol of space science in Bremen the drop tower provides an european unique facility for experiments under conditions of high-quality weightlessness with residual gravitational accelerations in the microgravity regime. The period of maximum 4.74s of each freely falling experiment at the Drop Tower Bremen is only limited by the height of the drop tower vacuum tube, which was fully manufactured of steal and enclosed by an outer concrete shell. Thus, the pure free fall height of each microgravity drop experiment is approximately 110m. By using the later in-stalled catapult system established in 2004 ZARM`s short-term microgravity laboratory is able to nearly double the time of free fall. This world-wide inimitable capsule catapult system meets scientists` demand of extending the period of weightlessness. During the catapult operation the experiment capsule performs a vertical parabolic flight within the drop tower vacuum tube. In this way the time of microgravity can be extended to slightly over 9s. Either in the drop or in the catapult operation routine the repetition rates of microgravity experiments at ZARM`s drop tower facility are the same, generally up to 3 times per day. In comparison to orbital platforms the ground-based laboratory Drop Tower Bremen represents an economic alternative with a permanent access to weightlessness on earth. Moreover, the exceptional high quality of weightlessness in order of 1e-6 g (in the frequency range below 100\n\n[Health for refugees - the Bremen model].\n\nPubMed\n\nMohammadzadeh, Zahra; Jung, Felicitas; Lelgemann, Monika\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe Bremen model recognizes that refugee health care has to go beyond merely checking for the prevalence of contagious diseases. Elementary health care offered in the reception centre and transitory facilities is based on voluntary acceptance by the refugees. At the same time, legal requirements for the medical reception of refugees are observed. In addition, doctors performing the initial medical examination are enabled to cover acute care on the spot. During the preliminary phase of immigration refugees are allowed to see a doctor in their facility repeatedly. After aÂ certain time, they are provided with aÂ health card permitting limited access to regular care outside of their facility. The current rise of refugee numbers affects the situation of Bremen health care for adult as well as juvenile refugees. In spite of the increase, health care standards are maintained by means of the health card. From 2011 to 2014, \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" averaged 29.6â% in the health check data. Diseases of the respiratory system (18.1â%) and \"symptoms, signs and abnormal findings not elsewhere classified\" (16.9â%) ranked second and third, respectively. Diseases of the digestive system (6.1â%) of the musculoskeletal system (6â%) and of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (3.6â%) followed. Infectious diseases such as HIV infections, hepatitis or tuberculosis were seldom.\n\nThe Drop Tower Bremen -Experiment Operation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKÃ¶nemann, Thorben; von Kampen, Peter; Rath, Hans J.\n\nThe idea behind the drop tower facility of the Center of Applied Space Technology and Micro-gravity (ZARM) in Bremen is to provide an inimitable technical opportunity of a daily access to short-term weightlessness on earth. In this way ZARM`s european unique ground-based microgravity laboratory displays an excellent economic alternative for research in space-related conditions at low costs comparable to orbital platforms. Many national and international ex-perimentalists motivated by these prospects decide to benefit from the high-quality and easy accessible microgravity environment only provided by the Drop Tower Bremen. Corresponding experiments in reduced gravity could open new perspectives of investigation methods and give scientists an impressive potential for a future technology and multidisciplinary applications on different research fields like Fundamental Physics, Astrophysics, Fluid Dynamics, Combus-tion, Material Science, Chemistry and Biology. Generally, realizing microgravity experiments at ZARM`s drop tower facility meet new requirements of the experimental hardware and may lead to some technical constraints in the setups. In any case the ZARM Drop Tower Operation and Service Company (ZARM FAB mbH) maintaining the drop tower facility is prepared to as-sist experimentalists by offering own air-conditioned laboratories, clean rooms, workshops and consulting engineers, as well as scientific personal. Furthermore, ZARM`s on-site apartment can be used for accommodations during the experiment campaigns. In terms of approaching drop tower experimenting, consulting of experimentalists is mandatory to successfully accomplish the pursued drop or catapult capsule experiment. For this purpose there will be a lot of expertise and help given by ZARM FAB mbH in strong cooperation to-gether with the experimentalists. However, in comparison to standard laboratory setups the drop or catapult capsule setup seems to be completely different at first view.

Comprehensive epidemiological research on health and health development of this large, heterogeneous and increasingly important population group in Germany is still deficient. There is a lack of results on mortality and morbidity, particularly concerning chronic diseases and disease processes. The aim of this paper is to combine and to compare already applied methods with new methodological approaches for determining the vital status and the mortality of immigrants from Turkey and the former Soviet Union. For this purpose we used data from the state of Bremen (666 709 residents, last update 2010). We examined 2 methodological aspects: (i) possibilities for identifying immigrant background in the data of residents' registration office with different methods (onomastic, toponomastic, etc.) and (ii) opportunities for record linkage of the obtained data with the Bremen mortality index. Immigrants from Turkey and the former Soviet Union were successfully identified in databases of the residents' registration office by a combination of different methods. The combination of different methodological approaches proved to be considerably better than using one method only. Through the application of a name-based algorithm we found that Turkish immigrants comprise 6.9% of the total population living in Bremen. By combining the variables \"citizenship\" and \"country of birth\" the total population proportion of immigrants from the former Soviet Union was found to be 5%. We also identified the deceased immigrant population in Bremen. The information obtained from residents' registration office could be successfully linked by death register number with the data of the Bremen mortality index. This information can be used in further detailed mortality analyses. The results of this analysis show the existing opportunities to consider the heterogeneity of the German population in mortality research, especially by means of\n\n[The Bremen periodic health exam - feasibility of a new concept].\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmiemann, Guido; Biesewig-Siebenmorgen, JÃ¼rgen; Gebhardt, Klaus; Egidi, GÃ¼nther\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAll members of the Statutory Health Insurance are entitled to receive preventive health examinations. The current concept, however, does not take individual risk factors into account systematically. To improve this, the \"Bremen Health Examination\" was developed. The central component is a screening questionnaire to be completed by the patient, which is stratified by age, i.e., 35 to 69 years and â¥Â 70 years. The feasibility and acceptance of this concept have been assessed. In a prospective observational study, a selected sample of general practitioners (GPs) was asked to implement the questionnaires during all preventive health examinations within a four-week period. The GPs subsequently answered content-related questions as well as Likert-scaled questions on the relevance of the issues addressed, and the feasibility of the new concept. 17 out of 20 GPs approached for the study included a total of 171 patients. On average, the patients in the two groups were 52 and 75 years of age, respectively, and answered 4.4 prompting questions positively. Age and gender had no significant effect on the frequency of \"positively\" answered questions. Implementing the questionnaire extended the duration of the health examination, however, GPs overall rated the time required for discussing newly assessed problems as adequate (four-level Likert scale, 1=yes; 4=no; Ã 1.59; SD 0.77). The implementation of the Bremen Health Examination appears to be feasible from the GP perspective. Copyright Â© 2014.

The graduate school is part of MARUM - Center for Marine Environmental Sciences which is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the frame of the Excellence Initiative by the German federal and state governments to promote top-level research at German universities. GLOMAR hosts approx. 75 PhD students from different research institutions in Bremen and Bremerhaven. 50% of them are German, 50% have an international background. All students are a member of one of the four GLOMAR research areas: (A) Ocean & Climate, (B) Ocean & Seafloor, (C) Ocean & Life and (D) Ocean & Society. Their academic background ranges from the classical natural sciences to law, social and political sciences. The research areas are supervised by research associates who share their experience and offer advice for their younger colleagues. GLOMAR students work in an interdisciplinary and international context. They spend several months at a foreign research institution and are encouraged to actively participate in international conferences and publish their research results in international scientific journals. The services GLOMAR offers for its PhD students include team supervision by a thesis committee, a comprehensive course programme, research seminars and retreats, a family support programme, a mentoring programme for women in science, an ombudsperson and a funding system for conference trips, research residencies and publication costs. The graduate school offers different formats for interdisciplinary exchange within the PhD student community.

Results from the Bremen STEMI Registry.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmucker, J; Wienbergen, H; Seide, S; Fiehn, E; Fach, A; WÃ¼rmann-Busch, B; Gohlke, H; GÃ¼nther, K; Ahrens, W; Hambrecht, R\n\n2014-09-01\n\nLaws banning tobacco smoking from public areas have been passed in several countries, including the region of Bremen, Germany at the end of 2007. The present study analyses the incidence of hospital admissions due to ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) before and after such a smoking ban was implemented, focusing on differences between smokers and non-smokers. In this respect, data of the Bremen STEMI Registry (BSR) give a complete epidemiological overview of a region in northwest Germany with approximately 800,000 inhabitants since all STEMIs are admitted to one central heart centre. Between January 2006 and December 2010, data from the BSR was analysed focusing on date of admission, age, gender, and prior nicotine consumption. A total of 3545 patients with STEMI were admitted in the Bremen Heart Centre during this time period. Comparing 2006-2007 vs. 2008-2010, hence before and after the smoking ban, a 16% decrease of the number of STEMIs was observed: from a mean of 65 STEMI/month in 2006-2007 to 55/month in 2008-2010 (pâ<â0.01). The group of smokers showed a constant number of STEMIs: 25/month in 2006-2007 to 26/month in 2008-2010 (+4%, pâ=â0.8). However, in non-smokers, a significant reduction of STEMIs over time was found: 39/month in 2006-2007 to 29/month in 2008-2010 (-26%, pâ<â0.01). The decline of STEMIs in non-smokers was consistently observed in all age groups and both sexes. Adjusting for potentially confounding factors like hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus did not explain the observed decline. In the BSR, a significant decline of hospital admissions due to STEMIs in non-smokers was observed after the smoking ban in public areas came into force. No reduction of STEMI-related admissions was found in smokers. These results may be explained by the protection of non-smokers from passive smoking and the absence of such an effect in smokers by the dominant effect of active smoking.

The two-stage oscillator-amplifier-system provides an excellent beam profile (TEM{sub 00}) at narrowband operation (ÎÎ» < 1 pm) and is tunable from 1018 nm to 1052 nm. The laser repetition rate of up to 4 kHz at pulse durations of 10 ns enables the tracking of processes on a millisecond time scale. Depending on the specific issue it is possible to convert the output radiation up to the fourth harmonic aroundmoreÂ Â» 257 nm. The very compact laser system is integrated in a slightly modified drop capsule and withstands decelerations of up to 50 g (>11 ms). At first the concept of the two-stage disk laser is briefly explained, followed by a detailed description of the disk laser adaption to the drop tower requirements with special focus on the intended use under Î¼g conditions. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the capsule laser as a tool for Î¼g combustion diagnostics, we finally present an investigation of the precursor-reactions before the droplet ignition using 2D imaging of the Laser Induced Fluorescence of formaldehyde.Â«Â less\n\nComparative analysis of premature mortality among urban immigrants in Bremen, Germany: a retrospective register-based linkage study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMakarova, Nataliya; Brand, Tilman; BrÃ¼nings-Kuppe, Claudia; Pohlabeln, Hermann; Luttmann, Sabine\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives The main objective of this study was to explore differences in mortality patterns among two large immigrant groups in Germany: one from Turkey and the other from the former Soviet Union (FSU). To this end, we investigated indicators of premature mortality. Design This study was conducted as a retrospective population-based study based on mortality register linkage. Using mortality data for the period 2004â2010, we calculated age-standardised death rates (SDR) and standardised mortality ratios (SMR) for premature deaths (Bremen, Germany: immigrants from Turkey, those from the FSU and the general population. Results The SDRs for premature deaths of the two immigrant groups were lower compared to those of the general population. The SMRs remained under 1. Using the indicator of YPLL, we observed higher age-standardised YPLL rates among immigrant populations, particularly among males from the FSU compared to females and population groups 4238/100â 000, 95% CI (4119 to 4358). Regarding main causes of premature death, we found larger contributions of infant mortality and diseases of the respiratory system among Turkish immigrants, and of injuries and poisonings, and mental and behavioural disorders among immigrants from the FSU. Conclusions While the overall trends favour the immigrant populations, the indicator of YPLL and cause-specific results indicate areas where the healthcare systems responsiveness may need to be improved, including preventive services. Further work with broader databases providing a similar level of differentiation is necessary to substantiate these findings.

Currently, few mitochondrial (mt) DNA studies are available on archaeological sheep. In particular, no data on archaeological European sheep are available. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe the first portion of mtDNA sequence of a Copper Age European sheep. DNA was extracted from hair shafts which were part of the clothes of the so-called Tyrolean Iceman or Ãtzi (5,350 - 5,100 years before present). Mitochondrial DNA (a total of 2,429 base pairs, encompassing a portion of the control region, tRNAPhe, a portion of the 12S rRNA gene, and the whole cytochrome B gene) was sequenced using a mixed sequencing procedure based on PCR amplification and 454 sequencing of pooled amplification products. We have compared the sequence with the corresponding sequence of 334 extant lineages. Conclusions/Significance A phylogenetic network based on a new cladistic notation for the mitochondrial diversity of domestic sheep shows that the Ãtzi's sheep falls within haplogroup B, thus demonstrating that sheep belonging to this haplogroup were already present in the Alps more than 5,000 years ago. On the other hand, the lineage of the Ãtzi's sheep is defined by two transitions (16147, and 16440) which, assembled together, define a motif that has not yet been identified in modern sheep populations.

However, the events immediately prior to the Iceman's death have remained unclear and even the recently discovered arrowhead in his back does not explain conclusively the cause of death satisfactorily. From the pollen and macrofossil content of his gut, we reconstruct his travels just before his demise. Sequential sampling of the food residues in the digestive tract of the 5200 year old glacier mummy has made possible the analyses of a series of meals and, from the pollen content, the deduction of the environments in which the last meals were eaten. During his last 33 or so hours, Ãtzi crossed different habitats in the Ãtztal mountains over considerable distances from high up near the timber line (at about 2500 m), to low down in the zone of warmth-loving trees (about 1200 m or less), and finally very high in the zone of perennial ice (above 3000 m). These final journeys lend new weight to the \"disaster\" theory of Ãtzi's death, which suggests that, returning from the high alpine pastures to his native village, he came into a severe conflict with his kin such that he had to flee from the community back to the high ground familiar to him, where he died.\n\nLong-term tilt and acceleration data from the Logatchev Hydrothermal Vent Field, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, measured by the Bremen Ocean Bottom Tiltmeter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFabian, Marcus; Villinger, Heinrich\n\n2008-07-01\n\nLong-term seafloor deformations in the Logatchev Hydrothermal Vent Field (LHF) at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are largely unexplored and unknown, even though the LHF has been the focus of international research for many years. As seafloor tilt and vertical acceleration provide key information about seafloor deformations, the Bremen Ocean Bottom Tiltmeter (OBT) was deployed in May 2005 at position 14Â°45'11.7â³N, 44Â°58'47.0â³W, 3035 m water depth in the LHF. The OBT recorded 384 days and was recovered in January 2007. Strong tilt steps and strong gradual tilt changes over less than a minute to days in the range of some 10 mrad and aligned mostly with the topography possibly indicate nearby mass movements like avalanches of bulk material due to local uplift or subsidence or may show tectonic activity. A vertically aligned high-resolution microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer of type Servo K-Beam in the sensor package seems to be helpful to distinguish between tilt signals caused by a true rotation and fake tilt related to a transient translational motion of the OBT in a horizontal direction. Hodographs show elliptic motion patterns with about 1 mrad total tilt amplitude and distinct orientations of tilt toward hydrothermal vents. It is up to speculation whether the latter signals are related to hydrothermal fluid circulation. The amplitude spectra of these tilt signals and acceleration show discrete lines mostly between 0.1 and 50 mHz. The spectra show the periodic character of those signals and also proof that tides or bottom currents, which are known to show lower signal frequencies, or tremor, which generally has higher frequencies, are most likely not the reason. Compared with studies onshore and offshore, the LHF is most likely an area of strong and highly variable seafloor deformations.\n\nPreliminary magnetotelluric results across Dalma Volcanics, Eastern India: Inferences on metallogeny\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMaurya, Ved P.; Shalivahan; Bhattacharya, B. B.; Adhikari, P. K.; Das, L. K.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe regional magnetotelluric (MT) survey across Dalma Volcanics (DVs) in North Singhbhum Mobile Belt (NSMB) was carried out to obtain the conductivity model and to understand the metallogeny. The structure in general is 2-D and the average strike is N60Â°W. 2-D inversions using TE + TM and TE + TM + Tzy were carried out. Both inversions derived models with similar features but with modified shape. The TE + TM + Tzy inversion brings up two conducting zones enveloping three anomalous conducting bodies. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis of the samples collected from 8 to 10 m pit from different stratigraphic units of Dalma volcano-sedimentary belt indicates the presence of gold, silver, uranium and copper. The study area is a felsic dominated rifted margin and shows high conductivity contrast along with high gravity, magnetic and significant radiometric anomaly. Thus, the conducting zones indicate the presence of volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) or volcano hosted gold deposit (Au-VMS) in NSMB.\n\nU.S. EPA, Pesticide Product Label, NALCON 7647 PAPERMILL SLIMICIDE, 08/28/1990\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\n2011-04-14\n\n... \"' CI .... -ori ... ,.1 .....

It has been and still is tested with different methods and accuracies. In this paper an overview of tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle done in the past, developed in the present and planned for the future is given. The best result up to now is derived from the data of torsion balance experiments by Schlamminger et al. (2008). An intuitive test of the WEP consists of the comparison of the accelerations of two free falling test masses of different composition. This has been carried through by Kuroda & Mio (1989, 1990) with the up to date most precise result for this setup. There is still more potential in this method, especially with a longer free fall time and sensors with a higher resolution. Providing a free fall time of 4.74 s (9.3 s using the catapult) the drop tower of the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) at the University of Bremen is a perfect facility for further improvements. In 2001 a free fall experiment with high sensitive SQUID (Superconductive QUantum Interference Device) sensors tested the WEP with an accuracy of 10-7 (Nietzsche, 2001). For optimal conditions one could reach an accuracy of 10-13 with this setup (Vodel et al., 2001). A description of this experiment and its results is given in the next part of this paper. For the free fall of macroscopic test masses it is important to start with precisely defined starting conditions concerning the positions and velocities of the test masses. An Electrostatic Positioning System (EPS) has been developed to this purpose. It is described in the last part of this paper.\n\nAcademic and non-academic career options for marine scientists. - Support measures for early career scientists offered at MARUM - Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen, Germany\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHebbeln, Dierk; Klose, Christina\n\n2015-04-01\n\nEarly career scientists at MARUM cover a wide range of research topics and disciplines including geosciences, biology, chemistry, social sciences and law. Just as colourful as the disciplinary background of the people, are their ideas for their personal careers. With our services and programmes, we aim to address some important career planning needs of PhD students and early career Postdocs, both, for careers in science and for careers outside academia. For PhD students aiming to stay in science, MARUM provides funding opportunities for a research stay abroad for a duration of up to 6 months. A range of courses is offered to prepare for the first Postdoc position. These include trainings in applying for research funding, proposal writing and interview skills. Following MARUM lectures which are held once a month, early career scientists are offered the opportunity to talk to senior scientists from all over the world in an informal Meet&Greet. Mentoring and coaching programmes for women in science are offered in cooperation with the office for equal opportunities at the University of Bremen. These programmes offer an additional opportunity to train interpersonal skills and to develop personal career strategies including a focus on special challenges that especially women might (have to) face in the scientific community. Early career scientists aiming for a non-academic career find support on different levels. MARUM provides funding opportunities for placements in industry, administration, consulting or similar. We offer trainings in e.g. job hunting strategies or interview skills. For a deeper insight into jobs outside the academic world, we regularly invite professionals for informal fireside chats and career days. These events are organised in cooperation with other graduate programmes in the region to broaden the focus of both, the lecturers and the participants. A fundamental component of our career programmes is the active involvement of alumni of MARUM and our\n\nThe Impacts of Social Media on Citizen Security Behavior in Mexico\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-03-01\n\nconsumo -de-medios- digitales -2010. 72 Guillermo Perezbolde V, âTwitter en MÃ©xico 2011, slide 9 of 16,â Mente Digital Presentation, June 9, 2011, http...recent times.68 67 Millward Brown, âEstudio de Consumo de Medios Digitales en MÃ©xico 2010,â IAB...MÃ©xico, http://www.slideshare.net/iabmexico/estudio-de- consumo -de-medios- digitales -2010. 68 Ibid. 28 Figure 2.3.

Since more than five years graduate and postgraduate education in the field of Earth System and Environmental Science has been established in Bremen and Bremerhaven, north-western Germany. Using the network and collaboration of experts and specialists on observational and paleoclimate data as well as on statistical data analysis and climate modelling from two Universities and the Helmholtz research institute on Polar and Marine Research, master and PhD students are trained to understand, decipher and cope with the challenges of recent climate change on an highly interdisciplinary and inter-institutional level. The existing research infrastructure at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven (AWI), University of Bremen, and Jacobs University Bremen offers a unique research environment to study past, present and future changes of the climate system, with special focus on high latitudinal processes. It covers all kind of disciplines, climate science, geosciences and biosciences, and provides a consistent framework for education and qualification of a new generation of expertly trained, internationally competitive master and PhD students. On postgraduate level, the Postgraduate Programme Environmental Physics (PEP) at the University of Bremen (www.pep.uni-bremen.de) educates the participants on the complex relationship between atmosphere, hydrosphere (ocean), cryosphere (ice region) and solid earth (land). Here, the learning of experimental methods in environmental physics at the most advanced level, numerical data analysis using supercomputers, and data interpretation via sophisticated methods prepare students for a scientific career. Within cooperation with the Ocean University of China (OUC) students are participating one year in the PEP programme during their master studies since 2006, to get finally a double degree of both universities.

The foundation of the international ``Vereinigte Astronomische Gesellschaft'', which took place in 1800 in Bremen, prompted us to investigate the development of astronomy in German-speaking regions, and its international relations during the 19th century. We investigate the activities of famous astronomers like W. Olbers, J.E. Bode, F.X. von Zach, J.H. Schroeter, H.C. Schumacher and K. Schwarzschild, as well as those of their less famous professional colleagues like J.G. Schrader and L. de Ball. The geographical spectrum extends from Bremen and Lilienthal over Kiel, Gotha and Dresden to Copenhagen, Vienna and Chile. Among the topics are: telescope construction, including telescopes made by Herschel, the rediscovery of the minor planet Ceres 1801/02, the Berlin ``Astronomisches Jahrbuch'', the foundation of the ``Astronomische Nachrichten'', the evolution from the ``Vereinigte Astronomische Gesellschaft'' to the present-day ``Astronomische Gesellschaft'', the research at the Kuffner Observatory in Vienna, the professionalization in astronomy, and the attempts of many countries to establish a southern observatory in Chile. A listing of astronomical monuments in Lilienthal and Bremen concludes the book. All papers are written in German with English abstracts.\n\nConstruction of three lanthanide metal-organic frameworks: Synthesis, structure, magnetic properties and highly selective sensing of metal ions\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZhang, Xiu-Mei, E-mail: zhangxiumeilb@126.com; Li, Peng; Gao, Wei\n\nThree lanthanide metal-organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs), [Ln(TZI)(H{sub 2}O){sub 4}]Â·3H{sub 2}O (Ln=Gd (1) and Tb (2) and Dy (3), H{sub 3}TZI=5-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)isophthalic acid), have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions.

Due to the complexity and size of the data, automated feature extraction and classification steps are required to fully process the data. Since mass spectra exhibit certain structural similarities to image data, deep learning may offer a promising strategy for classification of IMS data as it has been successfully applied to image classification. Methodologically, we propose an adapted architecture based on deep convolutional networks to handle the characteristics of mass spectrometry data, as well as a strategy to interpret the learned model in the spectral domain based on a sensitivity analysis. The proposed methods are evaluated on two algorithmically challenging tumor classification tasks and compared to a baseline approach. Competitiveness of the proposed methods is shown on both tasks by studying the performance via cross-validation. Moreover, the learned models are analyzed by the proposed sensitivity analysis revealing biologically plausible effects as well as confounding factors of the considered tasks. Thus, this study may serve as a starting point for further development of deep learning approaches in IMS classification tasks. https://gitlab.informatik.uni-bremen.de/digipath/Deep_Learning_for_Tumor_Classification_in_IMS. jbehrmann@uni-bremen.de or christianetmann@uni-bremen.de.

Eine groÃe Rolle spielen dabei unternehmensweit nutzbare Informationen, die eine 360-Grad-Sicht auf den Kunden ermÃ¶glichen. Nur in dieser Kombination werden sich nachhaltig Wettbewerbsvorteile generieren lassen.

The team is made up of DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, OHB-System and ZARM, the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity at the University of Bremen. It is the aim of BEOS to represent a competent industrial interface to potential ISS users from the space and non-space industries. In this effort BEOS is supporting and supplementing the activities of the space agencies, especially in the field of industrial and/or commercial ISS utilization. With this approach BEOS is creating new business opportunities not only for its team members but also for its customers from industry. Besides the fostering of industrial research in space, nontechnical fields of space utilization like entertainment, advertisement, education and space travel represent further key sectors for the marketing efforts of BEOS. .\n\nThe Effect of Political Decentralization on School Leadership in German Vocational Schools\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGessler, Michael; Ashmawy, Iman K.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn this explorative qualitative study the effect of political decentralization on vocational school leadership is investigated.

The purpose of this inÂ vitro study was to evaluate the marginal fit of 5 different monolithic zirconia restorations milled with different CAD-CAM systems. Thirty monolithic zirconia crowns were fabricated on a custom-designed stainless steel die and were divided into 5 groups according to the type of monolithic zirconia crown and the CAD-CAM system used: group TZ, milled with an MCXL milling machine; group CZ, translucent zirconia milled with a motion milling machine; group ZZ, zirconia milled with a dental milling unit; group PZ, translucent zirconia milled with a zirconia milling unit; and group BZ, solid zirconia milled using an S1 VHF milling machine. The marginal fit was measured with a binocular microscope at an original magnification ofÂ Ã100. The results were tabulated and statistically analyzed with 1-way ANOVA and post hoc surface range test, and pairwise multiple comparisons were made using Bonferroni correction (Î±=.05). The type of CAD-CAM used affected the marginal fit of the monolithic restoration. The mean (Â±SD) highest marginal discrepancy was recorded in group TZI at 39.3 Â±2.3 Î¼m, while the least mean marginal discrepancy was recorded in group IZ (22.8 Â±8.9 Î¼m). The Bonferroni post hoc test showed that group TZI was significantly different from all other groups tested (P<.05). Within the limitation of this inÂ vitro study, all tested CAD-CAM systems produced monolithic zirconia restorations with clinically acceptable marginal discrepancies; however, the CAD-CAM system with the 5-axis milling unit produced the best marginal fit.

In 1988, the construction of the \"Drop Tower\" began. Since then, the eye-catching tower with a height of 146 m and its characteristic glass roof has become the emblem of the technology centre in Bremen. The Drop Tower Bremen provides a facility for experiments under conditions of weightlessness. Items are considered weightless, when they are in \"free fall\", i.e. moving without propulsion within the gravity field of the earth. The height of the tower limits the simple \"free fall\" experiment period to max. 4.74 s. With the inauguration of the catapult system in December 2004, the ZARM is entering a new dimension. This world novelty will meet scientists' demands of extending the experiment period up to 9.5 s. Since turning the first sod on May 3rd, 1988, the later installation of the catapult system has been taken into account by building the necessary chamber under the tower. The catapult system is located in a chamber 10 m below the base of the tower. This chamber is almost completely occupied by 12 huge pressure tanks. These tanks are placed around the elongation of the vacuum chamber of the drop tube. In its centre there is the pneumatic piston that accelerates the drop capsule by the pressure difference between the vacuum inside the drop tube and the pressure inside the tanks. The acceleration level is adjusted by means of a servo hydraulic breaking system controlling the piston velocity. After only a quarter of a second the drop capsule achieves its lift-off speed of 175 km/h. With this exact speed, the capsule will rise up to the top of the tower and afterwards fall down again into the deceleration unit which has been moved under the drop tube in the meantime. The scientific advantages of the doubled experiment time are obvious: during almost 10 s of high\n\n77 FR 14368 - Change in Bank Control Notices; Acquisitions of Shares of a Bank or Bank Holding Company\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-03-09\n\n... thereby indirectly acquire voting shares of Peoples Community Bank, both in Bremen, Georgia.

The preschool medical examination in Bremen was therefore extended by behavioral screenings. Based on their screening results from the SEU (health examination for school entry) 2011 in Bremen, 67 preschoolers were tested for behavioral disorders. Subsequently, children with behavioral or emotional symptoms (N = 56) were compared to symptomfree controls (N = 52) for their cognitive, motoric, linguistic, and social-emotional development. Psychosocial health was obtained through external assessment by the parents and kindergarten teachers. Results of the WPPSI-III, M-ABC-2, and ET 6-6 were included in the analysis. 32 children met the criteria for behavioral disorders. Children with behavioral or emotional symptoms showed significant lower scores on tests measuring cognitive, motoric, linguistic and emotional development compared to controls. Results suggest that there is necessity to screen all preschoolers for behavioral disorders before entering school. Because children with clinical or subclinical behavioral disorders showed major developmental deficits compared to children without behavioral symptoms, it is essential to conduct a multiple assessment on children with suspected behavioral disorders to ensure early developmental support and adequate interventional programs.\n\nElectromagnetic and light scattering by nonspherical particles XV: Celebrating 150 years of Maxwell's electromagnetics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMacke, Andreas; Mishchenko, Michael I.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe 15th Electromagnetic and Light Scattering Conference (ELS-XV) was held in Leipzig, Germany from 21 to 26 of June 2015 (Fig. 1).

Hans J. Rath in 1985 is part of the Department of Production Engineering at the University of Bremen, Germany. ZARM is mainly concentrated on fundamental investigations of gravitational and space-related phenomenas under conditions of weightlessness as well as questions and developments related to technologies for space. At ZARM about 100 scientists, engineers, and administrative staff as well as many students from different departments are employed. Today, ZARM is still one of the largest and most important research center for space sciences and technologies in Europe. With a height of 146 m the Bremen Drop Tower is the predominant facility of ZARM and also the only drop tower of its class in Europe. ZARM's ground-based laboratory offers the opportunity for daily short-term experiments under conditions of high-quality weightlessness at a level of 10-6 g (microgravity), which is one of the best achievable for ground-based flight opportunities. Scientists may choose up to three times a day between a single drop experiment with 4.74 s in simple free fall and an experiment in ZARM's worldwide unique catapult system with 9.3 s in weightlessness. Since the start of operation of the facility in 1990, over 7500 drops or catapult launches of more than 160 different experiment types from various scientific fields like fundamental physics, combustion, fluid dynamics, planetary formation / astrophysics, biology and materials sciences have been accomplished so far. In addition, more and more technology tests have been conducted under microgravity conditions at the Bremen Drop Tower in order to effectively prepare appropriate space missions in advance. In this paper we report on the progress on concepts for next-generation drop tower systems based on the GraviTower idea utilizing a guided electro-magnetic linear drive.

Therefore, capillary transport processes have to be understood for a wide variety of space applications, ranging from propellant management in tanks of space transportation systems to eating and drinking devices for astronauts. There are two types of liquid transportation in microgravity using capillary forces. First, the driven liquid flow in open channels where the capillary forces at free surfaces ensure a gas and vapor free flow. Here it is important to know the limiting flow rate through such an open channel before the free surface collapses and gas is sucked into the channel. A number of different experiments at the drop tower Bremen, on sounding rockets and at the ISS have been conducted to analyse this phenomenon within different geometries. As result a geometry dependent theory for calculating the maximum flow rate has been found. On the other hand liquid positioning and transportation requires the capillary pressure of curved surfaces to achieve a liquid flow to a desired area. Especially for space applications the weight of structure has to be taken into account for development. For example liquid positioning in tanks can be achieved via a complicated set of structure filling the whole tank resulting in heavy devices not reasonable in space applications. Astrium developed in cooperation with ZARM a propellant management device much smaller than the tank volume and ensuring a gas and vapour free supply of propellant to the propulsion system. In the drop tower Bremen a model of this device was tested concerning different microgravity scenarios. To further decrease weight and ensure functionality within different scenarios structure elements are designed as perforated geometries. Capillary transport between perforated plates has been analyzed concerning the influence of geometrical pattern of perforations. The conducted experiments at the drop tower Bremen show the\n\nInternational Conference on Hyperbolic Problems (2nd).

K.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nGreenstone belts are well known for gold occurrences at different regions of the world. The Dhanjori basin in the eastern Singhbhum region shows major characteristics of a rifted greenstone belt. Initially, we conducted 14 audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) measurements for a profile of Ë 20 km in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 10 Hz over this rather complex geologic environment covering Dhanjori Volcanics (DhV) and Kolhan Group (KG). Subsequently, gravity and magnetic surveys were also conducted over this AMT profile. The purpose of the survey was to identify and map conductive features and to relate them to metallogeny of the area along with the mapping of the basement of Dhanjori basin. The strike analysis showed N30Â°W strike for DhV for all the frequencies and for sites over KG domain in the frequency range of 100-10 Hz, but for KG domain, the obtained strike in 1 kHz to 100 Hz is N45Â°E. As the combination of transverse electric (TE), transverse magnetic (TM) and tipper (Tzy) can recover the electrical signature in complex geological environment, we discuss the conductivity model obtained from TE+TM+Tzy only. The inversion was carried for the regional profile with 14 sites and for 7 sites over KG domain. Conductivity model shows two well resolved conductors, one each in KG and Quartz Pebble Conglomerate Dhanjori (QPCD) domains respectively showing common linked concordant features between these regional and KG profiles. The conductors are interpreted as sulfide mineralization linked with QPCD group of rocks which may host gold. These conductors are also horizontally disposed due to the intrusive younger Mayurbhanj Granite. These intrusives correlate well with the gravity modeling as well. The thickness of the Dhanjori basin at the central is about 3.0 km, similar to that from gravity modeling. The conductivity model also indicates the presence of shallow conductors, but could not be resolved due to lack of high frequency data. However, the results from the close\n\nA Novel Wearable Forehead EOG Measurement System for Human Computer Interfaces\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHeo, Jeong; Yoon, Heenam; Park, Kwang Suk\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients whose voluntary muscles are paralyzed commonly communicate with the outside world using eye movement.

Electrodynamic tether is a long conductor wire that is attached to the satellite, which can act as a generator or motor, from its motion through the earth's magnetic field. And it has the potential to make space travel significantly cheaper. The lack of electrodynamic tether's widespread in common applications can be attributed to the variable Lorentz forces occuring on the tethers, which will cause them to oscillate and may go out of control, de-orbit the satellite and fall to Earth. A tuned mass damper system, for short refered as tilger, is suggested as damper of oscillations of tethers. A system composed of a tuned mass damper and a simple pendulum simulating the tether was therefore constructed. 350 sets of experimental trials were done on the system, while it was installed inside a drop tower capsule resting on the ground, in order to pick four optimum setup experiments that will undergo a series of microgravity experiments at the Bremen Drop Tower in Bremen, Germany. The GJU Bachelor Research students found that the oscillations of the simple pendulum will not be affected by the tilger during the free fall experiment, except if a feedback mechanism is installed between the simple pendulum and the tilger. In this case, the tilger will dampen the simple pendulum oscillations during free fall.\n\nDo tanning salons adhere to new legal regulations? Results of a simulated client trial in Germany.\n\nPubMed\n\nMÃ¶llers, Tobias; Pischke, Claudia R; Zeeb, Hajo\n\n2016-03-01\n\nIn August 2009 and January 2012, two regulations were passed in Germany to limit UV exposure in the general population. These regulations state that no minors are allowed to use tanning devices. Personnel of tanning salons is mandated to offer counseling regarding individual skin type, to create a dosage plan with the customer and to provide a list describing harmful effects of UV radiation. Furthermore, a poster of warning criteria has to be visible and readable at all times inside the tanning salon. It is unclear whether these regulations are followed by employees of tanning salons in Germany, and we are not aware of any studies examining the implementation of the regulations at individual salons. We performed a simulated client study visiting 20 tanning salons in the city-state of Bremen in the year 2014, using a short checklist of criteria derived from the legal requirements, to evaluate whether legal requirements were followed or not. We found that only 20 % of the tanning salons communicated adverse health effects of UV radiation in visible posters and other materials and that only 60 % of the salons offered the required determination of the skin type to customers. In addition, only 60 % of the salons offered to complete the required dosage plan with their customers. To conclude, our results suggest that the new regulations are insufficiently implemented in Bremen. Additional control mechanisms appear necessary to ensure that consumers are protected from possible carcinogenic effects of excessive UV radiation.\n\nRadiative transfer modeling through terrestrial atmosphere and ocean accounting for inelastic processes: Software package SCIATRAN\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRozanov, V. V.; Dinter, T.; Rozanov, A. V.; Wolanin, A.; Bracher, A.; Burrows, J. P.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nSCIATRAN is a comprehensive software package which is designed to model radiative transfer processes in the terrestrial atmosphere and ocean in the spectral range from the ultraviolet to the thermal infrared (0.18-40 Î¼m). It accounts for multiple scattering processes, polarization, thermal emission and ocean-atmosphere coupling. The main goal of this paper is to present a recently developed version of SCIATRAN which takes into account accurately inelastic radiative processes in both the atmosphere and the ocean. In the scalar version of the coupled ocean-atmosphere radiative transfer solver presented by Rozanov et al. [61] we have implemented the simulation of the rotational Raman scattering, vibrational Raman scattering, chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter fluorescence. In this paper we discuss and explain the numerical methods used in SCIATRAN to solve the scalar radiative transfer equation including trans-spectral processes, and demonstrate how some selected radiative transfer problems are solved using the SCIATRAN package. In addition we present selected comparisons of SCIATRAN simulations with those published benchmark results, independent radiative transfer models, and various measurements from satellite, ground-based, and ship-borne instruments. The extended SCIATRAN software package along with a detailed User's Guide is made available for scientists and students, who are undertaking their own research typically at universities, via the web page of the Institute of Environmental Physics (IUP), University of Bremen: http://www.iup.physik.uni-bremen.de.\n\nAutomated paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data acquisition with an in-line horizontal \"2G\" system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMullender, Tom A. T.; Frederichs, Thomas; Hilgenfeldt, Christian; de Groot, Lennart V.; Fabian, Karl; Dekkers, Mark J.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nToday's paleomagnetic and magnetic proxy studies involve processing of large sample collections while simultaneously demanding high quality data and high reproducibility. Here we describe a fully automated interface based on a commercial horizontal pass-through \"2G\" DC-SQUID magnetometer. This system is operational at the universities of Bremen (Germany) and Utrecht (Netherlands) since 1998 and 2006, respectively, while a system is currently being built at NGU Trondheim (Norway). The magnetometers are equipped with \"in-line\" alternating field (AF) demagnetization, a direct-current bias field coil along the coaxial AF demagnetization coil for the acquisition of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) and a long pulse-field coil for the acquisition of isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM). Samples are contained in dedicated low magnetization perspex holders that are manipulated by a pneumatic pick-and-place-unit. Upon desire samples can be measured in several positions considerably enhancing data quality in particular for magnetically weak samples. In the Bremen system, the peak of the IRM pulse fields is actively measured which reduces the discrepancy between the set field and the field that is actually applied. Techniques for quantifying and removing gyroremanent overprints and for measuring the viscosity of IRM further extend the range of applications of the system. Typically c. 300 paleomagnetic samples can be AF demagnetized per week (15 levels) in the three-position protocol. The versatility of the system is illustrated by several examples of paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data processing.\n\nCompositional variations and differential diagenesis in Miocene turbidites from the western coast of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFelder, Sonja; Westphal, Hildegard; Munnecke, Axel; Mateu Vicens, Guillem\n\n2010-05-01\n\nCompositional variations and differential diagenesis in Miocene turbidites from the western coast of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain) Sonja Felder (1), Hildegard Westphal (1), Axel Munnecke (2), Guillem Mateu Vicens (1,3) (1) MARUM and Department of Geosciences, UniversitÃ¤t Bremen, Leobener StraÃe, 28359 Bremen, Germany (2) GeoZentrum Nordbayern, UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg, Loewenichstr. 28, 91054 Erlangen, Germany (3) Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, UniversitÃ di Roma \"La Sapienza\", Ple Aldo 7 Moro, 5. I-00185 Roma, Italy Cyclic alternations of limestone and marl beds crop out along the western coast of the Island of Mallorca. This Miocene succession is traditionally interpreted to represent more weathering-resistant turbidites interlayered by softer hemipelagic background sediment. However, the cementation patterns that dominate the appearance of the outcrop do not always consistently follow sedimentary layering; locally the cemented beds are systematically oblique to the sedimentary layers. Compositional studies demonstrate that differences in non-carbonate fraction, carbonate concentration and fossil content (e.g. foraminiferal assemblages) trace sedimentary bedding, regardless the diagenetic style. Limestone versus marl lithology, in contrast, is defined by the diagenetic style, tight cementation by calcite cements in the limestones versus low porosity and compaction in the marls. The reason for this striking pattern of diagenetic bedding cross-cutting sedimentary layers is assumed to be related to tectonic fracturing, opening pathways for diagenetic fluids. This example cautions the straight-forward interpretation of limestone-marl alternations as direct witnesses of environmental or climatic variations.\n\nRepresentation of the Auroral and Polar Ionosphere in the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBilitza, Dieter; Reinisch, Bodo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis issue of Advances in Space Research presents a selection of papers that document the progress in developing and improving the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), a widely used standard for the parameters that describe the Earths ionosphere.

Challenges for science and the federal government].\n\nPubMed\n\nStamm-Kuhlmann, T\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe peak of the first great cholera pandemic in 1831 fomented the controversy among contagionists and non-contagionists. In the following year the public debate centered around the correct interpretation of the recent experiences with cholera. The central government of the bureaucratic-absolutist monarchy in Prussia adhered to a firmly contagionist interpretation of the disease and reacted accordingly. Local authorities in KÃ¶nigsberg and Berlin and the bourgeoisie in the merchant city of Danzig, however, stressed the destructive consequences of the cordon system. They considered the results of an interruption in trade and industry to be worse than the damage inflicted by the epidemic. The summer of 1831 demonstrated that cholera could not be stopped by the cordons, but the King's medical advisors nevertheless remained contagionists. Non-contagionists put forward several hypotheses to explain the origin and the spreading of cholera, mainly \"miasma\" theory and the Hippocratic paradigm of \"epidemic constitution\". The correlation between poverty and disease, however, was widely noticed. Physicians in the city of Bremen pointed to the necessity of sanitary precautions to be taken in cholera-free periods. On the other hand, many \"honest\" citizens believed that individuals with a \"dissolute\" conduct of life were more at risk to contract cholera than others. Instead of costly sanitary policies, the well-to-do classes preferred to identify the defense against cholera with the segregation of unwelcome elements of society. The article is based on hitherto unpublished sources from the former Prussian State Archives at Merseburg, GDR, and the State Archive of the Hanseatic City of Bremen.\n\nFomitopsis betulina (formerly Piptoporus betulinus): the Iceman's polypore fungus with modern biotechnological potential.\n\nPubMed\n\nPleszczyÅska, MaÅgorzata; Lemieszek, Marta K; Siwulski, Marek; Wiater, Adrian; Rzeski, Wojciech; Szczodrak, Janusz\n\n2017-05-01\n\nHigher Basidiomycota have been used in natural medicine throughout the world for centuries. One of such fungi is Fomitopsis betulina (formerly Piptoporus betulinus), which causes brown rot of birch wood. Annual white to brownish fruiting bodies of the species can be found on trees in the northern hemisphere but F. betulina can also be cultured as a mycelium and fruiting body. The fungus has a long tradition of being applied in folk medicine as an antimicrobial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory agent. Probably due to the curative properties, pieces of its fruiting body were carried by Ãtzi the Iceman. Modern research confirms the health-promoting benefits of F. betulina. Pharmacological studies have provided evidence supporting the antibacterial, anti-parasitic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective, and immunomodulating activities of F. betulina preparations. Biologically active compounds such as triterpenoids have been isolated. The mushroom is also a reservoir of valuable enzymes and other substances such as cell wall (1â3)-Î±-D-glucan which can be used for induction of microbial enzymes degrading cariogenic dental biofilm. In conclusion, F. betulina can be considered as a promising source for the development of new products for healthcare and other biotechnological uses.\n\nShear bond strength of indirect composite material to monolithic zirconia.\n\nPubMed\n\nSari, Fatih; Secilmis, Asli; Simsek, Irfan; Ozsevik, Semih\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of surface treatments on bond strength of indirect composite material (Tescera Indirect Composite System) to monolithic zirconia (inCoris TZI). Partially stabilized monolithic zirconia blocks were cut into with 2.0 mm thickness. Sintered zirconia specimens were divided into different surface treatment groups: no treatment (control), sandblasting, glaze layer & hydrofluoric acid application, and sandblasting + glaze layer & hydrofluoric acid application. The indirect composite material was applied to the surface of the monolithic zirconia specimens. Shear bond strength value of each specimen was evaluated after thermocycling. The fractured surface of each specimen was examined with a stereomicroscope and a scanning electron microscope to assess the failure types. The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey LSD tests (Î±=.05). Bond strength was significantly lower in untreated specimens than in sandblasted specimens (P<.05). No difference between the glaze layer and hydrofluoric acid application treated groups were observed. However, bond strength for these groups were significantly higher as compared with the other two groups (P<.05). Combined use of glaze layer & hydrofluoric acid application and silanization are reliable for strong and durable bonding between indirect composite material and monolithic zirconia.\n\nThermosolutal Marangoni convection short-time regimes - Proposals for drop tower experiments and real time computer simulation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPolezhaev, V. I.; Ermakov, M. K.\n\n1992-12-01\n\nResults are presented of a parametrical study of flow patterns, heat transfer, and time scales of thermosolutal Marangoni convection in a cavity with temperature and solutal gradients along the free surface and adiabatic bottom for the case of zero gravity. Nusselt number, concentration difference across the cavity, and flow/temperature fields for the different regimes are presented; they show the possibility to use Drop Tower 'Bremen' for measuring the developed secondary flow and heat/mass transfer due to thermosolutal Marangoni convection as well as the possibility to analyze and plan the drop tower for such experiments using the COMGA PC-based system.\n\nThe Greenhouse Gas Climate Change Initiative (GHG-CCI): comparative validation of GHG-CCI SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and TANSO-FTS/GOSAT CO2 and CH4 retrieval algorithm products with measurements from the TCCON\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDils, B.; Buchwitz, M.; Reuter, M.; Schneising, O.; Boesch, H.; Parker, R.; Guerlet, S.; Aben, I.; Blumenstock, T.; Burrows, J.
