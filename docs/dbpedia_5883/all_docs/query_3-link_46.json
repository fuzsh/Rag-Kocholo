As a tactical data networking specialist, she is sent away from everyone she knows and attached to a Regimental Combat Team where women are not allowed to repair communications. Her experiences over the next few months shed light on the unique and difficult positions women are placed in when supporting combat roles, while offering a raw look at the painful choices women must sometimes make.\n\nCannon finds herself in a combat zone, ostracized from family, friends, and even her fellow Marines as the men are told to avoid her. The connections she makes are born from trauma and desperation and the choices she makes will echo throughout many lives.\n\n\"Corporal Cannon: A Female Marine in Afghanistan\" is not the story of a heroine; it is the hard-hitting account of just one of the flawed individuals who make up the United States' fighting forces. Mistakes in the battlefield can have dire consequences, personally and professionally. Reflecting on her time in service, Cannon deftly weaves a story of past and present, and the healing that can come with admitting our mistakes and moving past them.\n\nCritique: A simply riveting and impressively candid military memoir from cover to cover, \"Corporal Cannon: A Female Marine in Afghanistan\" will be of special value to readers with an interest in the subject of women in the American military, America's involvement in the Afghanistan War. While especially recommended for community and academic library American Military Biography/Memoir collections, it should be noted for personal reading lists that \"Corporal Cannon: A Female Marine in Afghanistan\" is also available from Casemate Publishers in a digital book format (Kindle, $20.95).\n\nEditorial Note: Savannah Cannon spent five years in the United States Marine Corps, leaving in 2012. She spent years ignoring what she endured in Afghanistan before deciding to write her story as a way to process the events. She currently works as a network engineer on unmanned aircraft for the United States Navy.\n\nShopomania\n\nPaul Berton\n\nDouglas & McIntyre\n\nhttps://douglas-mcintyre.com\n\n9781771623346 $28.95\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Shopomania-Obsession-Possession-Paul-Berton/dp/1771623349\n\nSynopsis: Sassy and satirical, Shopomania is an economic, environmental and social study. This light-hearted, dark-souled dictionary of coined words, or \"shoponyms,\" takes readers on a roller-coaster ride of avaricious antics and outrageous profligacy.\n\nShopping in one form or another has existed for millennia but, aside from a few slumps, each generation has outdone the previous one. In the past fifty years, shopping - and its associated carbon footprint - has grown exponentially.\n\nBerton argues that if we invented today's consumer culture, then we can invent something to replace it. We can do a better job of making the cycle of stuff truly circular rather than linear. We can be more environmentally, socially and politically conscious of what we buy and how it comes to us - and where it will go after we are finished with it. A species that has made shopping ubiquitous can figure all these things out with little more than co-operation and creativity, and by asking if it is really necessary to \"own it now\" as we have been told - endlessly - since childhood. Must we possess a thing to enjoy it? Do we really need all that stuff?\n\nCritique: Shopomania examines the modern first world's obsession with shopping and consumerism. Although author and award-winning journalist Paul Berton has engaged in extensive research, cited in a substantial section of notes, Shopomania is expressly for lay readers of all backgrounds; indeed, any shopper may see themselves described in the anecdotes and unique examination of today's shopping-centric society. Shopomania does not follow a typical chapter structure, but rather describes the many different aspects of retail consumption in its own unique vocabulary of newly created words derived from the verb \"shop\". Each definition is itself a brief \"chapter\". For example, one chapter is devoted to the word \"unshop\", which Berton uses to describe either returning a purchase or selling it at a profit; another is devoted to \"deshop\", which Berton uses to describe selling or discarding a purchase at a loss; \"convershopping\", which Berton uses to describe socializing about purchases; and much more. Amid all these definitions are countless insights into human impulses; stories of both celebrities and commoners shopping; and serious philosophical ponderings. At its heart, Shopomania poses questions worth every reader's time - why are our lives so shopping-centric? Are there ways to tame endless shopping- incitements in our lives? Do we really need to buy so much stuff? Shopomania is highly recommended, and since it encourages the reader to carefully reconsider their own consumption habits, it's one shop purchase that effectively pays for itself!\n\nUntangle\n\nAngela McKinney\n\nDartFrogBooks\n\nhttps://dartfrogbooks.com\n\n9781956019414, $3.99 ebook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9CHNYS8\n\nUntangle: How to Create Big Possibilities Through Small Changes introduces self-help readers to process of working through confusion, entanglements, and feeling stuck to come out the other side of a conundrum stronger than before. While many self-help guides seem to have addressed this approach, Angela McKinney adopts a different perspective through not just exercises and admonitions, but a discussion of links between seemingly-small stressful situations and their connections and contributions to bigger patterns of habits that trap.\n\nClarity comes not from a singular path, but from a blend of lessons and examples from others and the analysis and direction McKinney provides to illustrate how individuals can untangle themselves from self-destructive or limiting patterns. McKinney acknowledges that this process may initially seem convoluted or challenging.\n\nNotes based on the Untangle Workshops that McKinney conducts, provided by those who successfully employed specific strategies to improve their lives and modify their reactions to life, make important connections between tapping creative potential and understanding self-limiting messages and approaches that have held that possibility at bay. Without such creative solutions, untangling unconscious reenactment patterns can be challenging. Reality checks cover such disparate entanglements as overwork, aggressive energy, and self-limiting internal messages, offering methods to overcoming these in the form of play and creative problem-solving engagements, and venturing into new, unfamiliar territory on many different levels.\n\nMcKinney's proven strategy allows participants and readers to move ahead into their best lives. All that's required is a willingness to absorb the messages, experiences, and guidelines in Untangle, which ideally will be readily available in both general-interest and self-help libraries.\n\nThe Christmas Shelf\n\nHow Christmas Became Christmas\n\nNathaniel Parry\n\nMcFarland & Company\n\nPO Box 611, Jefferson NC 28640\n\nhttps://mcfarlandbooks.com\n\n9781476688282, $39.95, PB, 260pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/How-Christmas-Became-Christian-Origins/dp/1476688281\n\nSynopsis: In some respects, the contrasts of Christmas are what make it the most delightful time of the year. It is a time of generosity, kindness and peace on earth, with broad permission to indulge in food, drink and gifts. On the other hand, Christmas has become a battleground for raging culture wars, marred by debates about how it should be celebrated and acknowledged as a uniquely Christian holiday.\n\nWith the publication of \"How Christmas Became Christmas: The Pagan and Christian Origins of the Beloved Holiday\", Nathaniel Parry argues that much of the animosity is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the holiday's core character. By tracing Christmas's origins as a pagan celebration of the winter solstice and its development in Europe's Christianization, this detailed and documented history explains that the true \"reason for the season\" has as much to do with the earth's movement around the sun as with the birth of Christ.\n\nIndividual chapters deftly chronicle how Christmas's magic and misrule link to the nativity, and why the carnival side of the holiday appears so separated from traditional Christian beliefs.\n\nCritique: A simply fascinating and expertly presented historical study, \"How Christmas Became Christmas: The Pagan and Christian Origins of the Beloved Holiday\" features black/white historical images and is informatively enhanced for the reader with the inclusion of a four page Bibliography, twenty-two pages of Chapter Notes; and a five page Index. \"How Christmas Became Christmas: The Pagan and Christian Origins of the Beloved Holiday\" will prove a welcome and enduringly valued addition to personal, community, college, and university library Christmas Holiday collections and supplemental curriculum reading lists.\n\nEditorial Note: Nathaniel Parry is an American researcher and writer living in Denmark. He is the editor of several books and his work has appeared in outlets such as Consortium News, In These Times, Common Dreams, Global Research, and Truthout. Since 2008, he has worked at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe, where he is currently head of communications.\n\nSanta Claus Worldwide\n\nTom A. Jerman\n\nMcFarland & Company\n\nPO Box 611, Jefferson NC 28640\n\nhttps://mcfarlandbooks.com\n\n9781476680934, $29.95, PB, 248pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Santa-Claus-Worldwide-Nicholas-Gift-bringers/dp/1476680930\n\nSynopsis: With the publication of \"Santa Claus Worldwide: A History of St. Nicholas and Other Holiday Gift-Bringers\", author and Christmas historian Tom A. Jerman presents a comprehensive history of the world's midwinter gift-givers, showcasing the extreme diversity in their depictions as well as the many traits and functions these characters share.\n\n\"Santa Claus Worldwide\" tracks the evolution of these figures from the tribal priests who presided over winter solstice celebrations thousands of years before the birth of Christ, to Christian notables like St. Martin and St. Nicholas, to a variety of secular figures who emerged throughout Europe following the Protestant Reformation.\n\nFinally, \"Santa Claus Worldwide\" explains how the popularity of a poem about a \"miniature sleigh\" and \"eight tiny reindeer\" helped consolidate the diverse European gift-givers into an enduring tradition in which American children awake early on Christmas morning to see what Santa brought.\n\nAlthough the names, appearance, attire and gift-giving practices of the world's winter solstice gift-givers differ greatly, they are all recognizable as Santa, the personification of the Christmas and Midwinter festivals. Despite efforts to eliminate him by groups as diverse as the Puritans of seventeenth century New England, the Communist Party of the twentieth century Soviet Union and the government of Nazi Germany, Santa has survived and prospered, becoming one of the best known and most beloved figures in the world.\n\nCritique: Enhanced for the reader with the inclusion of b/w illustrations, an informative three page Epilogue (the Santas of Christmas Future), twenty-two pages of Notes, a six page Bibliography, and a three page Index, \"Santa Claus Worldwide: A History of St. Nicholas and Other Holiday Gift-Bringers\" is a fascinating, informative, and exceptional history that is exceptionally comprehensive and highly recommended for personal, professional, community, college, and university library Folklore/Mythology collections in general, and Christmas Traditions/History reading lists in particular. It should be noted that \"Santa Claus Worldwide\" is also readily available in a digital book format (Kindle, $13.49).\n\nEditorial Note: After collecting Santa Claus figurines for thirty-five years while practicing law in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., Tom A. Jerman retired at the end of 2015 and moved to Asheville, N.C., where he began writing a book on the history of Santa Claus.

The television industry has long had a collaborative model for writing shows. With the explosion of scripted shows, and the competition among the networks and streaming channels, a \"fluidity has developed to the way shows are created.\" The writers room follows no single formula; it is an open-ended process with a range of set-ups. Room sizes vary from two to thirty, depending on the budget and number of episodes, each room with its own rules. \"Mini-rooms\" exist for limited series and smaller shows, mostly those haven't gotten the thumbs-up. (Wikipedia)\n\nWriters' rooms can be a heaven or hell, depending on a few things. The best rooms foster inclusive and productive creative flow. The worst create a toxic stew of bad feelings and doubt. Both kinds and everything in between require basic knowledge of how the room works. These fundamentals are best learned before you go in.

It is the foundation of cuisines across the world, a grain that sustains half the world's people, and the start of a delicious meal at home.\n\nWith the publication of \"Rice Is Life: Recipes and Stories Celebrating the World's Most Essential Grain\", the visionaries and founders of Lotus Foods, Caryl Levine and Ken Lee, share 65 recipes that showcase the grain in easy-to-cook meals from around the world.

The result is more than just a rehashing of familiar-sounding issues, but offers many new insights into the process of solid research and scholarship itself, shedding light on why so many inconsistencies are reported (and come to be seen) as true.\n\nDecoding climate and energy problems thus faces the added burden of tackling the methods of investigation, analysis, reporting, and conclusions that lead to falsehoods that further muddy the waters of climate change issues.\n\nWhile Climate and Energy Decoded lives up to its promise of providing more enlightening contrasts between different options, its added value lies in its meticulous pinpointing of how research, study, and reporting methods fail, and how readers can conduct better research more thoroughly grounded in a vetted approach to critical thinking.\n\nLibraries strong in climate issues and research papers will find Climate and Energy Decoded an excellent acquisition. Ideally, it will be chosen for classroom and reading group discussions about not just climate change, but the methods used to represent its science.\n\nGreenhouse Planet\n\nLewis H.

CO2 levels directly affect plant growth, in turn affecting any kind of life that depends on plants -- in other words, everything and everyone.\n\nWith the publication of \"Greenhouse Planet: How Rising CO2 Changes Plants and Life as We Know It\", Professor Lewis H. Ziska reveals the stakes of increased CO2 for plants, people, and ecosystems -- from crop yields to seasonal allergies and from wildfires to biodiversity.\n\nA veteran plant biologist Professor Ziska describes the importance of plants for food, medicine, and culture and explores the complex ways higher CO2 concentrations alter the systems on which humanity relies. He explains the science of how increased CO2 affects various plant species and addresses the politicization and disinformation surrounding these facts.\n\nProfessor Ziska also confronts the claim that \"CO2 is plant food\", a longtime conservative talking point. While not exactly false, it is deeply misleading. CO2 doesn't just make \"good\" plants grow; it makes all plants grow. It makes poison ivy more poisonous, kudzu more prolific, cheatgrass more flammable. CO2 stimulates some species more than others: weeds fare particularly well and become harder to control. Many crops grow more abundantly but also become less nutritious. And the further effects of climate change will be formidable.\n\nCritique: Impressively well written, organized and presented for readers with an interest in the effects of Climate Change on horticulture and botony, and detailing essential environmental and horticultural science with wit and clarity, \"Greenhouse Planet: How Rising CO2 Changes Plants and Life as We Know It\" must be considered as an indispensable book for all readers interested in the ripple effects of increasing CO2. While unreservedly recommended for personal, professional, community, and academic library Climatology collections, it should be noted for students, academia, governmental and industrial policy makers, as well as non-specialist general readers with an interest in the subject that \"Greenhouse Planet: How Rising CO2 Changes Plants and Life as We Know It\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $11.99).\n\nEditorial Note: Lewis H.

The Great Lakes define the region, and thousands of smaller lakes offer peace, joy, and recreation to millions. And yet, in large part because of the numbers of people who enjoy the local waterways, the lakes of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota face numerous challenges. Invasive species, pollution, defective septic systems, inadequate shoreland zoning laws, and climate change are present and increasingly existential threats. We are, quite possibly, loving our lakes to death.\n\nWith the publication of \"Ripple Effects: How We're Loving Our Lakes to Death\", and in his engaging and conversational style, Ted Rulseh details each of these challenges and proposes achievable solutions. He draws on personal experience, interviews, academic research, and government reports to describe the state of the lakes, the stresses they are under, and avenues to successful lakeside living for a sustainable future.\n\n\"Ripple Effects\" will be a go-to source for all who love lakes and who advocate for their protection; its driving question is summed up by one of Rulseh's interviewees: \"We love this lake. What can we do to keep it healthy?\"\n\nCritique: Informatively enhanced for the reader with the inclusion of an Epilogue (Toward a Land and Water Ethic), sixteen pages of Notes, a six page List of Interviews, and a fourteen page Index, \"Ripple Effects: How We're Loving Our Lakes to Death\" is a clarion call and much needed warning of how we are environmentally damaging our lakes and rivers throughout the Great Lakes states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota.

Eighteen species of amphibian and thirty-six species of reptile occupy landscapes across the state. They live in aquatic habitats that range from small streams to large lakes, and from open prairies to mature forests on land.\n\nThese species are vital members of the biological communities in which they occur, acting as important predators, prey, and competitors, while also providing a wide variety of additional ecological functions. However, many amphibians and reptiles have experienced drastic population declines and even local extinctions in Wisconsin due to habitat loss and degradation, overharvesting, the introduction of invasive species, pollution, and other factors.\n\n\"Amphibians and Reptiles of Wisconsin\" is comprehensive volume, by an expert team of editors and contributors, consolidates the current state of scientific knowledge, aims to expand public knowledge and appreciation of Wisconsin's natural legacy, and brings out the herpetologist in all of us.\n\nThis long-awaited, state-of-the-field synthesis also includes hundreds of color photographs and illustrations, state-level and North American range maps, dichotomous keys, and research and conservation anecdotes that will entertain and inform even the most dedicated nature lover. Amphibians and Reptiles of Wisconsin is set to become a lasting resource and armchair companion for anyone in the Midwest interested in the state's natural history and amphibian and reptile fauna.\n\nCritique: With its special appeal to students, academicians, biologists, and non-specialist general readers with an interest in amphibians and reptiles, \"Amphibians and Reptiles of Wisconsin\", collaboratively compiled and co-edited by certified wildlife biologists Joshua M.

AI-driven advancements in medical error rates, diagnostic accuracy, or disease outbreak detection could potentially save thousands of lives. But health AI also carries the potential for exacerbating deep systemic biases if left unchecked.\n\nWith the publication of \"The Doctor and the Algorithm: Promise, Peril, and the Future of Health AI\", Professor S. Scott Graham has combined insights drawn from science and technology studies, critical algorithm studies, and public interest informatics to better understand the promise and peril of health AI.\n\n\"The Doctor and the Algorithm\" draws on case studies in automated diagnostics, algorithmic pain measurement, AI-driven drug discovery, and death prediction to investigate how health AI is made, promoted, and justified. It also explores the enthusiastic promises of health AI marketing communication and medical futurism while also analyzing the inequitable outcomes new AI technology often creates for already marginalized communities. Finally, \"The Doctor and the Algorithm\" closes with specific recommendations for regulatory frameworks that might support more ethical and equitable approaches to health AI in the future.\n\nInterweaving textual analysis and original informatics, \"The Doctor and the Algorithm\" offers a sobering analysis of the promise of medical AI against the real and unintended consequences that deep medicine can bring for patients, providers, and public health alike.\n\nCritique: A seminal and groundbreaking study that is timely, well written, impressively informative, exceptionally thought provoking, and enhanced for the reader with the inclusion of an eight page Technical Appendix, twenty four pages of Notes, a sixteen page listing of References, and a six page Index, \"The Doctor and the Algorithm: Promise, Peril, and the Future of Health AI\" is unreservedly recommended for personal, professional, community, medical school, college, and university library Health/Medicine and AI collections and supplemental curriculum studies lists.

As far back as we can trace human history, there have been entrepreneurs.\n\nAlmost five millennia ago, copper tool manufacturers set up a factory in what today is southwest Spain, profiting for hundreds of years from trade around the Mediterranean. Papyri document the diverse investments of an ancient Egyptian businessperson, from grain-yielding land to flax for linen cloth.\n\nWhat do these figures have in common with renowned modern entrepreneurs, and how do their similarities help us achieve a deeper understanding of entrepreneurship as well as the potential for a healthier, wealthier, and more equitable and sustainable future?\n\nWith the publication of \"The Entrepreneurs: The Relentless Quest for Value\", Professor Derek Lidow delves into the deep history of innovation to deliver essential new insights into how entrepreneurs create value and bring about change.

With the publication of \"The Prepared Leader: Emerge from Any Crisis More Resilient Than Before\", two history-making experts in crisis leadership (James, dean of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Wooten, president of Simmons University) forcefully argue that the time to prepare is always.\n\nIn no other time in recent history have leaders in every industry and on every continent grappled with so many changes that have independently and simultaneously undermined their ability to lead. \"The Prepared Leader\" encapsulates more than two decades of the co-authors' research to convey how it has positioned them to navigate through the distinct challenges of today and tomorrow. Their insights have implications for every leader in every industry and every worker at every level.\n\nIn their fast-reading and actionable study, James and Wooten provide tools and frameworks for addressing and learning from crises, and they provide insight into what you need to know to become a Prepared Leader, including:\n\nThe five phases of crisis management and the skills you need for each phase. They examine how the National Basketball Association and its commissioner, Adam Silver, responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMaking the right decisions under pressure and how to avoid common mistakes. They reveal how Burger King CEO Jose Cil began planning for the aftermath of a crisis right in the middle of one.\n\nBuilding a crisis leadership team and how to lead one that you've inherited. They detail how Wonya Lucas, CEO and President of the Crown Media Family Networks, aligned and mobilized an executive team during a time of crisis.\n\nIn \"The Prepared Leader, both James and Wooten argue that in addition to people, profit, and the planet, prepared leadership should be the fourth \"P\" in a company's bottom line. They bring decades of world-renowned research on crisis leadership, diversity and inclusion, management strategy, and positive leadership to the table to help leaders better prepare themselves to lead through crises - and for whatever lies around the corner.\n\nCritique: The only certainty in a capitalist economy is that there are no enduring certainties. There are inevitable cycles of boom and bust, of Bull & Bear markets, of technology driven changes to social, cultural, and political forces that will have impact (for good or ill) on market driven businesses and corporate affairs. \"The Prepared Leader: Emerge from Any Crisis More Resilient Than Before\" is an ideal instruction guide and manual for corporate leaders at all levels to prepare to deal successfully with the unanticipated but inevitable fluctuations of the market place. While highly recommended for personal, professional, community, and academic library Business Leadership & Management collections, it should be noted for the personal reading lists of MBA studies, academia, corporate executives, business managers, entrepreneurs, and non-specialist general readers that \"The Prepared Leader: Emerge from Any Crisis More Resilient Than Before\" is also available in a paperback edition (9781613631638, $18.99), and in a digital book format (Kindle, $9.50).\n\nEditorial Note #1: Erika H.

Danger looms on the horizon, threatening to spill across all of Europe's borders.\n\nIda and Louise vow to help, but how can two ordinary working-class women with limited means make a difference?\n\nTogether with their beloved opera community, the sisters devise a plan to personally escort Jewish refugees from Germany to England.
