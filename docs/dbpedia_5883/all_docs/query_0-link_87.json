        "text": "Canned tuna (Thunnus spp.) is among of seafood-based products which is popular among Malaysia consumer. Deterioration in canned products is due to enzymatic reactions, chemical changes and spoilage through the microbial activity. Microbes can metabolize these amino acids producing ammonia, biogenic amines such as putrescine, histamine and cadaverine, organic acids, ketones and sulphur compounds. Several species of bacteria which are able to convert histidine to histamine can cause food poisoning if consumed in large amount. Improper storage conditions of canned products are among of the factor that influence the growth of bacteria associated with the production of histamine. Hence, this study was aimed to identify the presence of histamine-producing bacteria in canned tuna for 1 week storage at room temperature, and 2 to 3 weeks storage in refrigeration and to determine the characteristic of isolated bacteria based on morphology and biochemical properties. The canned tuna sample stored for 1 week at room temperature demonstrates the highest number of bacterial colonies. Throughout this study, a total of 89 bacterial isolates were identified from selective media of Niven's agar. Most of the isolates were identified as Gram negative bacteria with coccobacilli morphology. The bacteria that capable to produce amino acid decarboxylases are Enterobacter, Clostridium, Hafnia, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Photobacterium, Proteus, Pseudomonas and Vibrio spp. It is recommended that rapid chilling of raw materials and good hygienic practices may reduce the risk of contamination by histamine producing bacteria. INTRODUCTION Canned fish products are nowadays becoming the most popular product among of the consumer needs because it is an economical alternative in the lifestyle. Canned tuna (Thunnus spp.) is frequently and largely produced and most popular among Malaysia consumer. The contemporary global of canned tuna processing industry was developed in the mid1950s, in combination with the development of industrial-scale tropical tuna fisheries (Miyake et al., 2010). At first, the productions of canned tuna are mainly by the US mainland, EU and Japan, who collectively accounted for more than two thirds of total global production until the mid-1980s. This was followed by Philippines and Thailand in the early 1980s and later. The global canned tuna production exceeds 1.7 million metric tonnes annually (Miyake et al., 2010). Basically, canned fish processing involves heat treatment of fish followed by the packaging of treated fish in tightly sealed containers made from tin plates, aluminium, cans or glass. This canned product is fully sterilized to prevent from contamination by pathogenic organisms and stored them in a virtually airtight package. Less information is available for long-term quality changes in canned tuna products. Unofficial information from the canning industry indicated that high histamine levels might be part of problem regarding such long stored products (Iwan, 2006). Histamine poisoning is known as scombrotoxism or scrombroid poisoning since the symptoms occurs as same result of ingesting spoiled fish of scombridae or scombresocidae. Scombroid fish such as tuna, mahi mahi, bluefish, bonito, skipjack, saury, mackerel, and others (CESFP, 1991; FDA, 2001b; Desphande, 2002). The accumulation of histamine in food requires the presence of microorganisms either gram\n\nNowadays, tuna related food products are usually faced to the problem of histamine contamination. Histamine causes foodborn illness and allergy due to the activities of Morganella morganii and Enterobacter aerogenes. This study tried to simulate the worse case of damaged tuna on effects of temperature and time of incubation on the formation of histamine in bonito tuna flesh. Tuna flesh samples were collected by cutting from bonito tuna and used in experiment. The result showed that microbiological contents of frozen and thawed tuna were below 1.9 x 103 CFU/g. Incubation of tuna flesh at 4°C for 6 h could control histamine content to 27 ppm, in which lower than USFDA regulation (50 ppm). In addition, histamine content in tuna flesh incubated at 25°C for 24 h was found to be 415.5 ppm, which was lower than the hazard level of USFDA regulation at 500 ppm. Inoculation of E. aerogenes in tuna flesh accelerated the formation of histamine to over hazard level within 18 h. Therefore, the in...\n\nEvaluation of histamine levels at various stages of manufacturing fish meal made from European pilchard Sardina pilchardus by-products was conducted on two batches which are distinguished by the quality of raw materials expressed through total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) content. The goal was also to assess the impact of the reuse of the concentrated stickwater, the liquid from the pressing process of fish meal. The results revealed that the level of raw material deterioration influenced the level of histamine in the finished product. When the freshness of the raw material is acceptable (TVBN content: 30 mg/100 g), histamine contents recorded in the finished product remain clearly below the limit value of 500 ppm. In this case, incorporation of concentrated stickwater into press cake before drying did not affect the concentration of histamine accumulated in the finished product. When the raw material was spoiled (TVBN content: 120 mg/100 g), the recorded histamine content was twi...\n\nMilkfish has not been implicated in histamine poisoning in the past but it was detected in smoked deboned milkfish collected from a local smoke fish producer. Histamine could have likely formed prior to smoke processing, where the fresh deboned milkfish could have been exposed to temperature abuse. The study evaluated the histamine accumulation and microbiological quality of deboned milkfish exposed to ambient conditions. Results revealed that initial histamine content (1.26±0.50 mg histamine 100 g-1 fish flesh) increased to 8.25±1.87 mg 100 g-1 on the 6th h, level beyond the allowable maximum limit (5 mg 100 g-1) to be considered safe. Potentially hazardous levels were present (58.8±10.67 to 111.9±11.73 mg 100 g-1) on the 8th-12th h. Total viable count (TVC) and histamine-forming bacteria (HFB) generally increased through time, as influenced by temperature. Initial total viable count (3.94 log cfu/g) significantly increased to 5.53 (log cfu) on the 4th h, the maximum acceptable microbiological limit in food, while the initial HFB count of 1.80±0.68 (log cfu) increased to 5.70±0.11 (log cfu) on the 12th h. The study showed that histamine developed in deboned milkfish beyond the safe levels when exposed to ambient temperature for more than four (4) h and may pose health risks to consumers."
