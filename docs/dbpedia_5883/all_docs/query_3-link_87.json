        "text": "Globigerinoides ruber morphotypes in the Gulf of Mexico: a test of null hypothesis\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nThirumalai, Kaustubh; Richey, Julie N.; Quinn, Terrence M.; Poore, Richard Z.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPlanktic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (G. ruber), due to its abundance and ubiquity in the tropical/subtropical mixed layer, has been the workhorse of paleoceanographic studies investigating past sea-surface conditions on a range of timescales. Recent geochemical work on the two principal white G. ruber (W) morphotypes, sensu stricto (ss) and sensu lato (sl), has hypothesized differences in seasonal preferences or calcification depths, implying that reconstructions using a non-selective mixture of morphotypes could potentially be biased. Here, we test these hypotheses by performing stable isotope and abundance measurements on the two morphotypes in sediment trap, core-top, and downcore samples from the northern Gulf of Mexico. As a test of null hypothesis, we perform the same analyses on couplets of G. ruber (W) specimens with attributes intermediate to the holotypic ss and sl morphologies. We find no systematic or significant offsets in coeval ss-sl Î´18O, and Î´13C. These offsets are no larger than those in the intermediate pairs. Coupling our results with foraminiferal statistical model INFAUNAL, we find that contrary to previous work elsewhere, there is no evidence for discrepancies in ss-sl calcifying depth habitat or seasonality in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nMg/Ca ratios of two Globigerinoides ruber (white) morphotypes: Implications for reconstructing past tropical/subtropical surface water conditions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSteinke, Stephan; Chiu, Han-Yi; Yu, Pai-Sen; Shen, Chuan-Chou; LÃ¶Wemark, Ludvig; Mii, Horng-Sheng; Chen, Min-Te\n\n2005-11-01\n\nTests of the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white; d'Orbigny) have become a standard tool for reconstructing past oceanic environments. Paleoceanographers often utilize the Mg/Ca ratios of the foraminiferal tests for reconstructing low-latitude ocean glacial-interglacial changes in sea surface temperatures (SST). We report herein a comparison of Mg/Ca measurements on sample pairs (n = 20) of two G. ruber (white) morphotypes (G. ruber sensu stricto (s.s.) and G. ruber sensu lato (s.l.)) from surface and downcore samples of the western Pacific and Indian Oceans. G. ruber s.s. refers to specimens with spherical chambers sitting symmetrically over previous sutures with a wide, high arched aperture, whereas G. ruber s.l. refers to a more compact test with a diminutive final chamber and small aperture. The G. ruber s.s. specimens generally show significantly higher Mg/Ca ratios compared to G. ruber s.l. Our results from the Mg/Ca ratio analysis suggest that G. ruber s.l. specimens precipitated their shells in slightly colder surface waters than G. ruber s.s. specimens. This conclusion is supported by the differences in Î´18O and Î´13C values between the two morphotypes. Although it is still unclear if these two morphotypes represent phenotypic variants or sibling species, our findings seem to support the hypothesis of depth and/or seasonal allopatry within a single morphospecies.\n\nA Bayesian, multivariate calibration for Globigerinoides ruberMg/Ca\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKhider, D.; Huerta, G.; Jackson, C.\n\nThe use of Mg/Ca in marine carbonates as a paleothermometer has been challenged by observations that implicate salinity as a contributing influence on Mg incorporation into biotic calcite and that dissolution at the sea-floor alters the original Mg/Ca. Yet, these factors have not yet been incorporated into a single calibration model. In this paper, we introduce a new Bayesian calibration for Globigerinoides ruber Mg/Ca based on 186 globally distributed core top samples, which explicitly takes into account the effect of temperature, salinity, and dissolution on this proxy. Our reported temperature, salinity, and dissolution (here expressed as deep-water ÎCO 2- 3)moreÂ Â» sensitivities are (Â±2Ï) 8.7Â±0.9%/Â°C, 3.9Â±1.2%/psu, and 3.3Â±1.3%/Î¼mol.kg -1 below a critical threshold of 21 Î¼mol/kg in good agreement with previous culturing and core-top studies. We then perform a sensitivity experiment on a published record from the western tropical Pacific to investigate the bias introduced by these secondary influences on the interpretation of past temperature variability. This experiment highlights the potential for misinterpretations of past oceanographic changes when the secondary influences of salinity and dissolution are not accounted for. Finally, multiproxy approaches could potentially help deconvolve the contributing influences but this awaits better characterization of the spatio-temporal relationship between salinity and Î´ 18O sw over millennial and orbital timescales.Â«Â less\n\nFossil and Genetic Evidence for the Polyphyletic Nature of the Planktonic Foraminifera \"Globigerinoides\", and Description of the New Genus Trilobatus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSpezzaferri, Silvia; Kucera, Michal; Pearson, Paul Nicholas; Wade, Bridget Susan; Rappo, Sacha; Poole, Christopher Robert; Morard, RaphaÃ«l; Stalder, Claudio\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPlanktonic foraminifera are one of the most abundant and diverse protists in the oceans. Their utility as paleo proxies requires rigorous taxonomy and comparison with living and genetically related counterparts. We merge genetic and fossil evidence of âGlobigerinoidesâ, characterized by supplementary apertures on spiral side, in a new approach to trace their âtotal evidence phylogenyâ since their first appearance in the latest Paleogene. Combined fossil and molecular genetic data indicate that this genus, as traditionally understood, is polyphyletic. Both datasets indicate the existence of two distinct lineages that evolved independently. One group includes âGlobigerinoidesâ trilobus and its descendants, the extant âGlobigerinoidesâ sacculifer, Orbulina universa and Sphaeroidinella dehiscens. The second group includes the Globigerinoides ruber clade with the extant G. conglobatus and G. elongatus and ancestors. In molecular phylogenies, the trilobus group is not the sister taxon of the ruber group. The ruber group clusters consistently together with the modern Globoturborotalita rubescens as a sister taxon. The re-analysis of the fossil record indicates that the first âGlobigerinoidesâ in the late Oligocene are ancestral to the trilobus group, whereas the ruber group first appeared at the base of the Miocene with representatives distinct from the trilobus group. Therefore, polyphyly of the genus \"Globigerinoides\" as currently defined can only be avoided either by broadening the genus concept to include G. rubescens and a large number of fossil species without supplementary apertures, or if the trilobus group is assigned to a separate genus. Since the former is not feasible due to the lack of a clear diagnosis for such a broad genus, we erect a new genus Trilobatus for the trilobus group (type species Globigerina triloba Reuss) and amend Globoturborotalita and Globigerinoides to clarify morphology and wall textures of these genera. In the new\n\nEcological controls on the shell geochemistry of pink and white Globigerinoides ruber in the northern Gulf of Mexico: implications for paleoceanographic reconstruction\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nRichey, Julie N.; Poore, Richard Z.; Flower, Benjamin P.; Hollander, David J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe evaluate the relationship between foraminiferal test size and shell geochemistry (Î´13C, Î´18O, and Mg/Ca) for two of the most commonly used planktonic foraminifers for paleoceanographic reconstruction in the subtropical Atlantic Ocean: the pink and white varieties of Globigerinoides ruber. Geochemical analyses were performed on foraminifera from modern core-top samples of high-accumulation rate basins in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Mg/Ca analysis indicates a positive relationship with test size, increasing by 1.1 mmol/mol (~ 2.5 Â°C) from the smallest (150â212 Î¼m) to largest (> 500 Î¼m) size fractions of G. ruber (pink), but with no significant relationship in G. ruber (white). In comparison, oxygen isotope data indicate a negative relationship with test size, decreasing by 0.6â° across the size range of both pink and white G. ruber. The observed increase in Mg/Ca and decrease in Î´18O are consistent with an increase in calcification temperature of 0.7 Â°C per 100 Î¼m increase in test size, suggesting differences in the seasonal and/or depth distribution among size fractions. Overall, these results stress the necessity for using a consistent size fraction in downcore paleoceanographic studies. In addition, we compare downcore records of Î´18O and Mg/Ca from pink and white G. ruber in a decadal-resolution 1000-year sedimentary record from the Pigmy Basin. Based on this comparison we conclude that pink G. ruber is calcifying in warmer waters than co-occurring white G. ruber, suggesting differences in the relative seasonal distribution and depth habitat of the two varieties.\n\nMg/Ca-temperature calibration and flux variability of Globigerinoides ruber based on a bi-weekly resolved sediment trap\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMonteagudo, M. M.; Weldeab, S.; Lea, D. W.; Karl, D. M.; Rosenthal, Y.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nPlanktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca is one of the most widely-applied proxies for sea surface temperature reconstructions. Current calibrations yield a temperature sensitivity of 9.0 Â± 1.0% Mg/Ca per Â°C (1-2). According to culture studies (3-4), salinity may also influence Mg/Ca ratios by 3.3 Â± 1.7% per salinity unit (4), though this effect has not been verified by a field-based study. Paired Mg/Ca-Î´18O and faunal fluxes of Globigerinoides ruber (sensu lato) were measured from sediment trap samples at the Hawaii Ocean Time Series. Within the habitat depth range of G. ruber (0-50 m), seasonal temperature and salinity vary by 4 Â°C and 0.7 practical salinity units, respectively. Multivariate regression reveals that salinity influence is not significant at this site, allowing us to isolate and quantify the temperature influence on Mg/Ca using spatially and temporally highly-resolved temperature measurements. Our study shows an exponential Mg/Ca-temperature relationship of: Mg/Ca [mmol/mol] = (0.97 Â± 0.39) exp ((0.063 Â± 0.016)*T[Â°C]) (RMSE=0.32). The results of our faunal and geochemical analyses highlight two key findings. First, foraminiferal assemblage data reveals that the mean annual flux of G. ruber (13 shells/m2/day) is strongly skewed by flux during the summer (up to 63 shells/m2/day) with potential implications for reconstructing annual SST. Second, our results indicate a temperature sensitivity of 6.3 Â± 1.6% Mg/Ca per Â°C, suggesting that the temperature influence on Mg/Ca may be lower than the canonical 9 Â± 1 % Mg/Ca per Â°C value and is sensitive to the choice of habitat depth. 1.

In addition, although TEX86 temperatures might reflect sea surface temperatures based on core-top (Holocene) values, this relationship might not hold further back in time. Here, we investigate the TEX86 temperature proxy by comparing TEX86 temperatures to Mg/Ca temperatures of multiple species of planktonic foraminifera for two sites in the eastern tropical Pacific (on the Cocos and Carnegie Ridges) across the Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum. Core-top and Holocene TEX86H temperatures at both study regions agree well, within error, with the Mg/Ca temperatures of Globigerinoides ruber, a surface dwelling planktonic foraminifera. However, during the Last Glacial Maximum, TEX86H temperatures are more representative of upper thermocline temperatures, and are offset from G. ruber Mg/Ca temperatures by 5.8 Â°C and 2.9 Â°C on the Cocos Ridge and Carnegie Ridge, respectively. This offset between proxies cannot be reconciled by using different TEX86 temperature calibrations, and instead, we suggest that the offset is due to a deeper export depth of GDGTs at the LGM. We also compare the degree of glacial cooling at both sites based on both temperature proxies, and find that TEX86H temperatures greatly overestimate glacial cooling, especially on the Cocos Ridge. This study has important implications for applying the TEX86 paleothermometer in the eastern tropical Pacific.\n\nThe Effects of Temperature and Salinity on Mg Incorporation in Planktonic Foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber (white): Results from a Global Sediment Trap Mg/Ca Database\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGray, W. R.; Weldeab, S.; Lea, D. W.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nMg/Ca in Globigerinoides ruber is arguably the most important proxy for sea surface temperature (SST) in tropical and sub tropical regions, and as such guides our understanding of past climatic change in these regions. However, the sensitivity of Mg/Ca to salinity is debated; while analysis of foraminifera grown in cultures generally indicates a sensitivity of 3 - 6% per salinity unit, core-top studies have suggested a much higher sensitivity of between 15 - 27% per salinity unit, bringing the utility of Mg/Ca as a SST proxy into dispute. Sediment traps circumvent the issues of dissolution and post-depositional calcite precipitation that hamper core-top calibration studies, whilst allowing the analysis of foraminifera that have calcified under natural conditions within a well constrained period of time. We collated previously published sediment trap/plankton tow G. ruber (white) Mg/Ca data, and generated new Mg/Ca data from a sediment trap located in the highly-saline tropical North Atlantic, close to West Africa. Calcification temperature and salinity were calculated for the time interval represented by each trap/tow sample using World Ocean Atlas 2013 data. The resulting dataset comprises >240 Mg/Ca measurements (in the size fraction 150 - 350 Âµm), that span a temperature range of 18 - 28 Â°C and 33.6 - 36.7 PSU. Multiple regression of the dataset reveals a temperature sensitivity of 7 Â± 0.4% per Â°C (p < 2.2*10-16) and a salinity sensitivity of 4 Â± 1% per salinity unit (p = 2*10-5). Application of this calibration has significant implications for both the magnitude and timing of glacial-interglacial temperature changes when variations in salinity are accounted for.\n\nMorphological recognition of Globigerinoides ruber morphotypes and their susceptibility to diagenetic alteration in the eastern Mediterranean Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKontakiotis, G.; Antonarakou, A.; Mortyn, P. G.; Drinia, H.; Anastasakis, G.; Zarkogiannis, S.; MÃ¶bius, J.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nPlanktonic foraminiferal geochemistry presents a valuable archive for paleoceanographic reconstructions. However in high salinity and carbonate super-saturated settings, precipitation of inorganic calcite onto foraminiferal tests can potentially alter the primary geochemical signal, biasing Mg/Ca ratios and ensuing paleoceanographic reconstructions. Here we utilize test biometrics (specifically related to the compression and elongation of the last chambers) to identify four distinct morphotypes (labelled A-D) of the paleoceanographically important planktonic foraminifer species Globigerinoides ruber, and further evaluate their susceptibility to diagenetic alteration from a suite of surface sediments in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The three distinguished morphotypes (A-C) correspond to previously recognized morphotypes (\"Normal\", \"Platys\", \"Elongate\" respectively) in the Mediterranean Sea, while the remaining (D or \"Twin\") was designated for the first time. We also compare Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observations performed on four distinguished morphotypes, indicative of potential diagenetic alteration influence. We identified 3 different overgrowth stages (OGA1-OGA3), as a function of geography in the study area. The early diagenesis degrees (involving all the morphotypes) are only geographically distinct along the eastern Mediterranean (increasing to the south), since the morphology does not play a role in the likelihood of diagenetic alteration. Particularly, in the north Aegean Sea, SEM analyses reveal the absence or limited presence of an overgrowth imprint in all recognized morphotypes, while in the central-south Aegean and Levantine Seas they show higher amplitudes of diagenetic overprint supporting the general trend to advanced diagenetic alteration. The semi-enclosed oligotrophic nature and high salinity of this setting, in combination with the different degree of carbonate precipitation and calcite super-saturation between the sub-basins, could\n\nSeasonal flux and assemblage composition of planktic foraminifers from a sediment-trap study in the northern Gulf of Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nPoore, Richard Z.; Spear, Jessica W.; Tedesco, Kathy A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSediment-trap samples from the northern Gulf of Mexico reveal that Globorotalia truncatulinoides, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Pulleniatina spp. (includes P. obliquiloculata and P. finalis), and the Globorotalia menardii group (includes Gt. menardii, Gt. tumida, and Gt. ungulata) generally occur in cold months. Globigerinoides ruber (white and pink varieties) and Globigennoides sacculifer occur throughout the year. The seasonal occurrence of individual taxa of planktic foraminifers in the Gulf of Mexico have important differences with the seasonal occurrence of the same taxa observed in a 6-year sediment-trap dataset from the western Sargasso Sea. Thus information on the ecologic preferences of individual taxa determined in one region cannot necessarily be applied directly to another area. In the northern Gulf of Mexico 90% of the total flux of Globorotalia truncatulinoides tests to sediments occurs in January and February. Mg/Ca and d18Î measurements indicate that nonencrusted forms of Gt. truncatulinoides calcify in the upper-surface-mixed zone. Thus, analyses of nonencrusted Gt. truncatulinoides in sediments of the northern Gulf of Mexico have potential for monitoring past conditions in the winter-surface-mixed layer. The relatively low overall abundance of Globigerinoides ruber (white) in sediment-trap samples is anomalous because Gs. ruber (white) is one of the most abundant foraminifers in>150 Âµm census data from northern Gulf of Mexico Holocene sediment core samples. Globigerinoides ruber (pink) is a relatively persistent and common component of the sediment-trap samples. Thus Gs. ruber (pink) has potential as a proxy for mean annual sea-surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico\n\nSeasonal flux and assemblage composition of planktic foraminifera from the northern Gulf of Mexico, 2008-11\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nReynolds, Caitlin E.; Poore, Richard Z.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey anchored a sediment trap in the northern Gulf of Mexico to collect seasonal time-series data on the flux and assemblage composition of live planktic foraminifers.

Globorotalia truncatulinoides showed a clear preference for the winter, consistent with data from 2008 to 2010. Globigerinoides ruber (white) flux data for 2011 (average 30 tests m-2 day-1) were consistent with data from 2010 (average 29 m-2 day-1) and showed a steady threefold increase since 2009 (average 11 tests m-2 day-1) and a tenfold increase from the 2008 flux (3 tests m-2 day-1).\n\nSeasonal flux and assemblage composition of planktic foraminifera from the northern Gulf of Mexico, 2008-2012\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nReynolds, Caitlin E.; Richey, Julie N.; Poore, Richard Z.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey anchored a sediment trap in the northern Gulf of Mexico beginning in 2008 to collect seasonal time-series data on the flux and assemblage composition of live planktic foraminifers.

These planktonic Foraminifera host species consistently harbored either dinoflagellates or a newly described minute coccoid algal type. There appeared to be a specific host-symbiont relationship in these species regardless of year, season or geographic locality. The larger ovoid dinoflagellates (Pyrrhophycophyta) occur in the spinose species Globigerinoides ruber, Globigerinoides sacculifer, G. conglobatus and Orbulina universa. The smaller alga, from 1.5 to 3.5 um in diameter, occurs inmoreÂ Â» one spinose species Globigerinella aequilateralis and also in the non-spinose species Globigerinita glutinata, Globoquadrina dutertrei, Globorotalia menardii, Globorotalia cristata, Globorotalia inflata, Candeina nitida, in various juvenile specimens and at all seasons except the winter months in Pulleniatina obliquiloculata and Globorotalial hirsuta. Controlled laboratory studies indicated a significant C incorporation into the host cytoplasm and inorganic calcium carbonate test of Globigerinoides ruber. During incubation for up to two hours, the /sup 14/C uptake into the cytoplasm and test in the light was significantly greater than uptake in the dark by living specimens or by dead foraminifers. There appears to be light-enhanced uptake of /sup 14/C into the test with dinoflagellate photosynthesis contributing to host calcification. In culture, symbiotic algae were observed to survive for the duration of the lifespan of their hosts.Â«Â less\n\nSeasonal flux and assemblage composition of planktic foraminifera from the northern Gulf of Mexico, 2008â14\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nReynolds, Caitlin E.; Richey, Julie N.\n\n2016-07-28\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey anchored a sediment trap in the northern Gulf of Mexico in January 2008 to collect seasonal time-series data on the flux and assemblage composition of live planktic foraminifers.

Ten taxa constituted ~95 percent of both the 2013 and 2014 assemblages: Globigerinoides ruber (pink and white varieties), Globigerinoides sacculifer, Globigerina calida, Globigerinella aequilateralis, Globorotalia menardii group [The Gt. menardii group includes Gt. menardii, Gt. tumida, and Gt. ungulata], Orbulina universa, Globorotalia truncatulinoides, Pulleniatina spp., and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei.

J.; Roth, S.\n\n2001-12-01\n\nWe analyzed five different planktic foraminifera species in the high resolution core MD 992201 off the Great Bahama Bank (79Â° 16.34 W; 25Â° 53.49 N) in 290 m water depth. This 38.05 m long core comprises a 7,000 year long Holocene record. The selected species were Orbulina universa, Globigerinoides ruber, Globigerinoides sacculifer, Globorotalia menardii and Globigerinella aequilateralis, which live in the upper 200 m of the water column. The Mg/Ca ratios of these different foraminifers show species-specific values, which represent a distinct habitat depth. With this species-specific Mg/Ca ratios we can reconstruct a temperature profile through the water column. The lowest Mg/Ca are shown by G. menardii (2.5 - 4 mmol/mol), followed by G. sacculifer (4.2 - 5.6 mmol/mol), G. ruber (5.1 - 7.2 mmol/mol) and G. aequilateralis (5.5 - 8.7 mmol/mol). Highest are shown by O. universa (6 - 14 mmol/mol). During the Little Ice Age, the Mg/Ca ratios of all species except for the deeper dwelling G. menardii, became more variable and showed lower ratios. The shallow dwelling species like G. ruber and G. sacculifer display an increase in the Mg/Ca ratios during the Medieval Warm Period. Our data show that transferring Mg/Ca ratios into SST based calibration curves known from literature needs re-evaluation. Species-specific calibration seems to be necessary to achieve reliable results.\n\nSeasonality in the tropical Atlantic: an 800-year record of seasonally-representative Mg/Ca data from the Cariaco Basin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBlack, D. E.; Rahman, S.; Wurtzel, J.; Thunell, R.; Mauer, B.; Tappa, E. J.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nThe Cariaco Basin, Venezuela is well-positioned to record a detailed history of surface ocean changes along the southern margin of the Caribbean and the tropical Atlantic. Varved, high deposition rate sediments deposited under anoxic conditions and an abundance of well-preserved microfossils result in one of the few marine records capable of preserving evidence of interannual- to decadal-scale climate variability in the tropical Atlantic. Boreal winter/spring sea surface temperatures (SST) spanning the last eight centuries have previously been reconstructed using Mg/Ca measurements on the planktic foraminifer Globigerina bulloides. Here we present the complementary record using Globigerinoides ruber (pink), a summer/fall indicator. Globigerinoides ruber Mg/Ca values are generally greater than those of G. bulloides from the same sample, reflecting warmer calcification temperatures. Both speciesâ records display similar long-term trends, yet there are some distinctive differences. The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA) as distinctly separate climate events are more apparent in the G. ruber record than that of G. bulloides. Additionally, greater variability in the G. ruber data may indicate a stronger than expected bias from productivity during the local upwelling season. As G. bulloides and pink G. ruber are thought to be winter/spring and summer/fall SST indicators, respectively (albeit with the potential upwelling season bias), the intersample differences between the two records can potentially be interpreted as a record of seasonality. Our seasonality reconstruction shows a distinctive oscillation of 4 Â°C with a period of approximately 200 years. The proxy seasonality is slightly less than what has been instrumentally measured (5 to 6 Â°C) over the last 15 years, and does not appear related to or affected by the MWP or LIA events.\n\nLunar periodicity in the shell flux of some planktonic foraminifera in the Gulf of Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJonkers, L.; Reynolds, C. E.; Richey, J.; Hall, I. R.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nSynchronised reproduction offers clear benefits to planktonic foraminifera - an important group of marine calcifiers - as it increases the chances of successful gamete fusion. Such synchrony requires tuning to an internal or external clock. Evidence exists for lunar reproductive cycles in some species, but its recognition in shell flux time series has proven difficult, raising questions about reproductive strategies. Using spectral analysis of a 6 year time series (mostly at weekly resolution) from the northern Gulf of Mexico we show that the shell flux of Globorotalia menardii, Globigerinella siphonifera, Orbulina universa, Globigerinoides sacculifer and in Globigerinoides ruber (both pink and white varieties) is characterised by lunar periodicity. The fluxes of Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Globigerinella calida, Globorotalia crassaformis and Globigerinita glutinata do not show significant spectral power at the lunar frequency. If present, lunar periodicity is superimposed on longer term/seasonal changes in the shell fluxes, but accounts for a significant part of the variance in the fluxes. The amplitude of the lunar cycle increases roughly proportional with the magnitude of the flux, demonstrating that most of the population is indeed affected by lunar-phased synchronisation. Phasing of peak fluxes appears species-specific, with G. menardii, O. universa and G. sacculifer showing most peaks around the full moon and G. ruber one week later. Contrastingly, peaks G. siphonifera occur dominantly around new moon. Very limited literature exists on lunar phasing of foraminiferal export fluxes, but spatial differences in its presence may exist, corroborating the exogenous nature of lunar synchrony in planktonic foraminifera.\n\nDiatoms as Proxies for Abrupt Events in the Hudson River Estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSkorski, W.; Abbott, D. H.; Recasens, C.; Breger, D. L.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe Hudson River estuary has been subject to many abrupt events throughout its history including hurricanes, droughts and pluvials. Hurricanes in particular are rare, discrete events that if fingerprinted can be used to develop better age models for Hudson River sediments. Proxies use observed physical characteristics or biological assemblages (e.g. diatom and foraminiferal assemblages) as tools to reconstruct past conditions prior to the modern instrumental record. Using a sediment core taken from the Hudson River (CDO2-29A), in New York City, drought and pluvial layers were selected based on Cs-137 dating while hurricane layers were determined from occurrences of tropical to subtropical foraminifera. Contrary to previous studies (Weaver, 1970, Weiss et al, 1978), more than sixty different diatom species have been identified using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Cosmopolitan, hurricane and drought assemblages have begun to be identified after observing multiple layers (Table 1). Tropical foraminifera dominated by Globigerinoides ruber pink were also found in a hurricane layer that we infer was deposited during Hurricane Belle in 1976. More diatom abundance analyses and cataloged SEM pictures will provide further insight into these proxies.

Long-term (millennial-scale) trends and changes are related to the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions and movement of the average position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) related to orbital forcing. The ??18O of the surface-dwelling planktic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber show negative excursions between 14 and 10.2 ka (radiocarbon years) that reflect influx of meltwater into the western GOM during melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The relative abundance of the planktic foraminifer Globigerinoides sacculifer is related to transport of Caribbean water into the GOM. Maximum transport of Caribbean surface waters and moisture into the GOM associated with a northward migration of the average position of the ITCZ occurs between about 6.5 and 4.5 ka. In addition, abundance variations of G. sacculifer show century-scale variability throughout most of the Holocene. The GOM record is consistent with records from other areas, suggesting that century-scale variability is a pervasive feature of Holocene climate. The frequency of several cycles in the climate records is similar to cycles identified in proxy records of solar variability, indicating that at least some of the century-scale climate variability during the Holocene is due to external (solar) forcing.\n\nEvidence for a Southern Pattern of Deglacial Surface Warming in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSpero, H. J.; Schmidt, M. W.; Lea, D. W.; Lavagnino, L.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nThe timing of both Southern and Northern hemisphere warming patterns has been used to explain tropical Pacific warming at the end of the last glacial period. Despite the importance of resolving this deglacial tropical-polar connection, the controversy is still ongoing (Koutavas & Sachs, 2008; Lea et al., 2000, 2006). For instance, the initiation of eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) surface warming, derived from Mg/Ca analyses of the surface-dwelling foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber, shows a clear correlation with the Southern hemisphere. In contrast, alkenone-derived temperatures from the EEP indicate tropical warming occurred at least 3 kyr later than that implied from Mg/Ca data, thereby suggesting a Northern hemisphere link to initial SST rise. Here, we use a multispecies, multiproxy approach that is based on fundamental foraminifera biology to resolve this controversy. Laboratory experiments demonstrate the final shell size of symbiont-bearing foraminifera varies primarily as a function of the light level (=symbiont photosynthetic rate) that an individual grew under. Because light decreases exponentially in the water column, and the EEP is highly stratified with a shallow mixed layer and cold thermocline, we hypothesize that symbiotic foraminifera with a broad habitat range such as Globigerinoides sacculifer, should produce smaller shells in the more dimly lit cold thermocline than individuals growing in the more illuminated mixed layer. Moreover, these larger shells should contain a temperature signal that is similar to G. ruber, which is constrained to the shallow mixed layer. Mg/Ca and Î´18O analyses conducted on 350-400 Î¼m and >650 Î¼m sized G. sacculifer from EEP core TR163-19 (2N, 91W, 2348) demonstrate large specimens yield Mg/Ca and Î´18O that are similar to data published previously for mixed layer dwelling G. ruber. In contrast, small G. sacculifer record significantly higher Î´18O and lower Mg/Ca temperatures that are consistent with a shallow\n\nSalinity controls on Na incorporation in Red Sea planktonic foraminifera\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMezger, E. M.; de Nooijer, L. J.; Boer, W.; Brummer, G. J. A.; Reichart, G. J.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWhereas several well-established proxies are available for reconstructing past temperatures, salinity remains challenging to assess. Reconstructions based on the combination of (in)organic temperature proxies and foraminiferal stable oxygen isotopes result in relatively large uncertainties, which may be reduced by application of a direct salinity proxy. Cultured benthic and planktonic foraminifera showed that Na incorporation in foraminiferal shell calcite provides a potential independent proxy for salinity. Here we present the first field calibration of such a potential proxy. Living planktonic foraminiferal specimens from the Red Sea surface waters were collected and analyzed for their Na/Ca content using laser ablation quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Using the Red Sea as a natural laboratory, the calibration covers a broad range of salinities over a steep gradient within the same water mass. For both Globigerinoides ruber and Globigerinoides sacculifer calcite Na/Ca increases with salinity, albeit with a relatively large intraspecimen and interspecimen variability. The field-based calibration is similar for both species from a salinity of 36.8 up to 39.6, while values for G. sacculifer deviate from this trend in the northernmost transect. It is hypothesized that the foraminifera in the northernmost part of the Red Sea are (partly) expatriated and hence should be excluded from the Na/Ca-salinity calibration. Incorporation of Na in foraminiferal calcite therefore provides a potential proxy for salinity, although species-specific calibrations are still required and more research on the effect of temperature is needed.\n\nSalinity bias on the foraminifera Mg/Ca thermometry: Correction procedure and implications for past ocean hydrographic reconstructions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMathien-Blard, Elise; Bassinot, Franck\n\n2009-12-01\n\nMg/Ca in foraminiferal calcite has recently been extensively used to estimate past oceanic temperatures. Here we show, however, that the Mg/Ca temperature relationship of the planktonic species Globigerinoides ruber is significantly affected by seawater salinity, with a +1 psu change in salinity resulting in a +1.6Â°C bias in Mg/Ca temperature calculations. If not accounted for, such a bias could lead, for instance, to systematic overestimations of Mg/Ca temperatures during glacial periods, when global ocean salinity had significantly increased compared to today. We present here a correction procedure to derive unbiased sea surface temperatures (SST) and Î´18Osw from G. ruber TMg/Ca and Î´18Of measurements. This correction procedure was applied to a sedimentary record to reconstruct hydrographic changes since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Western Pacific Warm Pool. While uncorrected TMg/Ca data indicate a 3Â°C warming of the Western Pacific Warm Pool since the LGM, the salinity-corrected SST result in a stronger warming of 4Â°C.\n\nLunar periodicity in the shell flux of planktonic foraminifera in the Gulf of Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJonkers, L.; Reynolds, C.

R.\n\n2015-05-01\n\nSynchronised reproduction offers clear benefits to planktonic foraminifera - an important group of marine calcifiers - as it increases the chances of successful gamete fusion. Such synchrony requires tuning to an internal or external clock. Evidence exists for lunar reproductive cycles in some species, but its recognition in shell flux time series has proven difficult, raising questions about reproductive strategies. Using spectral analysis of a 4-year time series (mostly at weekly resolution) from the northern Gulf of Mexico, we show that the shell flux of Globorotalia menardii, Globigerinella siphonifera, Orbulina universa, Globigerinoides sacculifer, Globigerinoides ruber (both pink and white varieties), Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Globigerinella calida and Globigerinita glutinata is characterised by lunar periodicity. However, the lunar rhythm is not present in all size fractions of each species and tends to be more dominant in the flux of larger shells, consistent with reproduction being more prevalent in larger specimens. Lunar periodicity is superimposed on longer term/seasonal changes in the shell fluxes, but accounts for a significant part of the variance in the fluxes. The amplitude of the lunar cycle increases roughly proportional with the magnitude of the flux, demonstrating that most of the population is indeed affected by lunar-phased synchronisation. In most species peak fluxes occur predominantly around, or just after, full moon. Only G. siphonifera and G. calida show a contrasting pattern with peaks concentrated around new moon. Although the exact cause of the synchronisation remains elusive, our data considerably increase the number of species for which lunar synchronised reproduction is reported and suggest that such reproductive behaviour is common in many species of planktonic foraminifera.\n\nEnvironmental controls on barium incorporation into planktic foraminifer, Globorotalia truncatulinoides\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRichey, J. N.; Reynolds, C. E.; Fehrenbacher, J. S.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Ba/Ca of planktic foraminifera in marine sediment cores has been used primarily to track changes in riverine input over time, and thus may be a potentially powerful proxy for reconstructing past changes in the terrestrial hydrologic cycle. Using Ba/Ca as a proxy for riverine freshwater input requires the assumption that Ba/Ca in foraminiferal calcite reflects the Ba/Ca of seawater, and that the partition coefficient for barium between seawater and foraminiferal calcite is independent of the influence of temperature, salinity, pH, alkalinity and light availability. Although it has been shown that this partition coefficient is nearly identical for common species of spinose planktic foraminifera (e.g., Globigerinoides ruber, Orbulina universa, Globigerinoides sacculifer), some non-spinose species have been demonstrated to have Ba/Ca ratios that are much higher than that of co-occurring spinose specimens. We investigate environmental controls on Ba/Ca in the tests of Globorotalia truncatulinoides, a planktic species of foraminifera with a unique life history in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). G. truncatulinoides experiences 92% of its annual flux to the sediment trap during winter (JFM) in the GoM. The Mg/Ca and â18O of the ontogenetic calcite suggests that primary calcification occurs within the surface mixed layer (0-150 meters), and a thick secondary crust is added at depths below the thermocline. We use LA-ICP-MS to analyze the Ba/Ca of both encrusted and non-encrusted G. truncatulinoides from a sediment trap time series in the GoM and find that the Ba/Ca in ontogenetic calcite of non-encrusted specimens varies between 10 and 200 mmol/mol, while the Ba/Ca of the secondary crust varies between 0 and 3 mmol/mol. The Ba/Ca of the non-encrusted G. truncatulinoides specimens is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of co-occurring spinose planktic foraminifera (O. universa and G. ruber) in the GoM sediment trap, while the secondary crust has Ba/Ca similar to\n\nInfluence of Past Changes in Atmospheric CO2 on Boron/Calcium of Planktic Fossil Foraminifera\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDomeyko, R. A.; Allen, K. A.; deMenocal, P. B.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nCulture experiments have revealed that B/Ca of shells grown by the foraminiferal species Globigerinoides ruber increase with increasing seawater pH. Specifically, B/Ca responds to changes in the relative abundance of pH-sensitive dissolved carbon and boron species (Allen et al. 2011, 2012). Here, we present a high-resolution study on fossilized G. ruber from two sites in North Atlantic subtropical gyres (VM25-21 and ODP 1055B) through 20 ka BP to evaluate how B/Ca responds to past changes in atmospheric CO2. Forams were picked and crushed gently, then cleaned and dissolved using a variation of the Boyle and Keigwin (1985) and Barker et al. (2003) cleaning protocols prior to analysis. ODP 1055B (from Carolina Slope, West Atlantic) produced a high-resolution record with lower B/Ca values during the glacial period followed by a rapid shift to higher B/Ca values in the early deglaciation, with values remaining high through the Holocene. These results were not predicted by culture calibrations, but they are consistent with B/Ca records from the Caribbean (ODP 999, Foster et al. 2008), suggesting this pattern is characteristic of surface waters in the greater North Atlantic region.\n\nLunar periodicity in the shell flux of planktonic foraminifera in the Gulf of Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nJonkers, Lukas; Reynolds, Caitlin E.; Richey, Julie N.; Hall, Ian R.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSynchronised reproduction offers clear benefits to planktonic foraminifera â an important group of marine calcifiers â as it increases the chances of successful gamete fusion.

Hydrography, chlorophyll fluorescence, and nutrient content were recorded at high spatial and temporal resolution providing detailed information about the transition time between summer and fall. At the beginning of the cruise a shallow pycnocline was present and oligotrophic conditions prevailed. Over the course of the cruise, the mixed layer depth increased and surface water temperature decreased by 1.5Â°C. Both chlorophyll- a dispersed in the upper 50 m by vertical mixing and chlorophyll- a concentrations at the sea surface increased. The nitracline shoaled and nutrient enriched waters were entrained into the mixed layer. Planktic foraminifers and pteropods closely reflected the changes in the hydrography by increased growth rates and changes in species composition. Three main groups of planktic foraminiferal species were recognized: (1) a temperate and low-productivity group dominated by Neogloboquadrina incompta characterized the shallow mixed layer depths. (2) A temperate and high-productivity group dominated by Globigerina bulloides characterized the period with wind-induced dispersal of chlorophyll- a and entrainment of nutrient-enriched waters. (3) A warm water group containing Globigerinoides sacculifer, Orbulina universa, Globigerinoides ruber (white), and Globigerinella siphonifera was most common during the first days of sampling. Synchronous with the hydrographic change from summer to fall, planktic foraminiferal and pteropod growth was stimulated by redistribution of chlorophyll- a and entrainment of nutrient-enriched waters into the mixed layer. In addition, the seasonal change in the eastern North Atlantic resulted in a transition of the epipelagic faunal composition and an increased calcareous particle flux, which could be used to\n\nNucleus Ruber of Actinopterygians.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakayama, Tomoya; Miyajima, Satoshi; Nishino, Hirotaka; Narita, Junya; Abe, Hideki; Yamamoto, Naoyuki\n\n2016-01-01\n\nNucleus ruber is known as an important supraspinal center that controls forelimb movements in tetrapods, and the rubral homologue may serve similar functions in fishes (motor control of pectoral fin). However, two apparently different structures have been identified as 'nucleus ruber' in actinopterygians. One is nucleus ruber of Goldstein (1905) (NRg), and the other nucleus ruber of Nieuwenhuys and Pouwels (1983) (NRnp). It remains unclear whether one of these nuclei (or perhaps both) is homologous to tetrapod nucleus ruber. To resolve this issue from a phylogenetic point of view, we have investigated the distribution of tegmental neurons retrogradely labeled from the spinal cord in eight actinopterygian species. We also investigated the presence/absence of the two nuclei with Nissl- or Bodian-stained brain section series of an additional 28 actinopterygian species by comparing the morphological features of candidate rubral neurons with those of neurons revealed by the tracer studies. Based on these analyses, the NRg was identified in all actinopterygians investigated in the present study, while the NRnp appears to be absent in basal actinopterygians. The phylogenetic distribution pattern indicates that the NRg is the more likely homologue of nucleus ruber, and the NRnp may be a derived nucleus that emerged during the course of actinopterygian evolution.

Continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) provides localised spectral information of the analysed dataset and in particular useful to study multiscale, nonstationary processes occurring over finite spatial and temporal domains. In the present work, oxygen-isotope ratio from the plantonic foraminifera species (viz. Globigerina bul-loides and Globigerinoides ruber) acquired from the broad central plateau of the Maldives ridge situated in south-eastern Arabian sea have been used as climate proxy. CWT of the time series generated using both the biofacies indicate spectro-temporal varia-tion of the natural climatic cycles. The dominant period resembles to the period of Milankovitch glacial-interglacial cycle. Apart from that, various other cycles are present in the time series. The results are in good agreement with the astronomical theory of paleoclimates and can provide better visualisation of Indian summer monsoon in the context of climate change.\n\nLaurentide Ice Sheet meltwater and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation since the last glacial maximum: A view from the Gulf of Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFlower, B. P.; Williams, C.; Brown, E. A.; Hastings, D. W.; Hendricks, J.; Goddard, E. A.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe influence of ice sheet meltwater on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) since the last glacial maximum represents an important issue in abrupt climate change. Comparison of Greenland and Antarctic ice core records has revealed a complex interhemispheric linkage and led to different models of ocean circulation including the âbipolar seesaw.â Meltwater input from the Laurentide Ice Sheet has been invoked as a cause of proximal sea-surface temperature (SST) and salinity change in the North Atlantic, and of regional to global climate change via its influence on the AMOC. We present published and new Mg/Ca, Ba/Ca, and Î´18O data on the planktic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber from northern Gulf of Mexico sediment cores that provide detailed records of SST, Î´18O of seawater (Î´18Osw), and inferred salinity for the 20-8 ka interval. Age control for Orca Basin core MD02-2550 is based on >40 AMS 14C dates on Globigerinoides ruber and documents continuous sedimentation at rates >35 cm/kyr. Early meltwater input is inferred from Î´18Osw and Ba/Ca data prior to and during the Mystery Interval, consistent with a high sensitivity to solar insolation and greenhouse forcing. New bulk sediment Î´18O data show major spikes reaching -5.5â° ca. 14.6 and 12.6 ka. We speculate that these excursions represent fine carbonate sediment from Canadian Paleozoic marine carbonates, analogous to detrital carbonate in the North Atlantic which has a Î´18O value of -5â°. Partial support for our hypothesis comes from SEM photomicrographs of bulk sediment from this section, which show no coccoliths or foraminifera in contrast to other intervals. The biogenic carbonate flux seems to have been greatly reduced by fine sediment input. Inferred peak meltwater flow appears to have been associated with the Bolling warming and meltwater pulse 1a. Finally, meltwater reduction at the start of the Younger Dryas supports models for a diversion to North Atlantic outlets and AMOC\n\nSeasonal flux and assemblage composition of planktic foraminifera from the northern Gulf of Mexico, 2008-2010\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSpear, Jessica W.; Reynolds, Caitlin E.; Poore, Richard Z.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey anchored a sediment trap in the northern Gulf of Mexico to collect seasonal time-series data on the flux and assemblage composition of live planktic foraminifers. This report provides an update of the previous time-series data to include results from 2010. Ten species, or varieties, of planktic foraminifers constituted ~90 percent of the assemblage: Globigerinoides ruber (pink and white varieties), Gs. sacculifer, Globigerina calida, Globigerinella aequilateralis, Globorotalia menardii group, Gt. truncatulinoides, Pulleniatina spp., Orbulina universa, and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei. The mean daily flux was 219 tests per square meter per day (m-2 day-1), with maximum fluxes of >600 tests m-2 day-1 during late December and minimum fluxes of -2 day-1) showed a steady increase of about a factor of 3 since 2009 (average 11 tests m-2 day-1), and an almost 10-fold increase from the 2008 flux (average 3 tests m-2 day-1). The progressive increase in flux resulted in a relatively large increase in percent abundance of total assemblage from 2008 (1.5 percent) to 2010 (12.4 percent). In addition, though Gs. ruber (white) percent abundance increased from 4.9 percent in 2009 to over 12 percent in 2010, it continued to occur in lower abundance than the 20-30 percent indicated by dead-assemblage records from nearby sediments.\n\nVariability of Indonesian Throughflow and Borneo Runoff During the Last 14 kyr\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHendrizan, Marfasran; Kuhnt, Wolfgang; Holbourn, Ann\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe present a high-resolution ( 20 to 100 years temporal resolution) reconstruction of hydrological changes in the Makassar Strait over the last 14 kyr from Core SO217-18517 retrieved off the Mahakam Delta (1Â°32.198'S, 117Â°33.756'E; 698 m water depth) during the SO217 Makassar-Java Cruise. Sea surface temperatures, based on Mg/Ca of Globigerinoides ruber and alkenone UK'37, and seawater Î´18O reconstructions, based on G. ruber Î´18O and Mg/Ca, in combination with sortable silt grain size measurements and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanner derived elemental data provide evidence for increased precipitation during the BÃ¸lling-AllerÃ¸d (BA) and early Holocene and for warmer and more saline surface waters and a decrease in the intensity of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) during the Younger Dryas (YD). XRF derived Log (Zr/Rb) records, sortable silt data and increased sedimentation rates indicate decreased winnowing, interpreted as a slowdown of the ITF thermocline flow during the YD. We attribute this decline in ITF intensity to slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during the YD. We suggest that changes in Makassar Strait surface hydrology during this interval of Northern Hemisphere cooling and Southern Hemisphere warming were related to a southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone.\n\nThe record of deglaciation in the Sulu Sea: Evidence for the Younger Dryas Event in the tropical western Pacific\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLinsley, Braddock K.; Thunell, Robert C.\n\n1990-12-01\n\nA high-resolution, accelerator mass spectroscopy 14C dated sediment record from the Sulu Sea clearly indicates that the Younger Dryas event affected the western equatorial Pacific. Planktonic foraminiferal Î´18O and abundance data both record significant changes during Younger Dryas time. In particular, a 0.4â° increase in the Î´18O value of Globigerinoides ruber and the reappearance of the cool water planktonic foraminifera, Neogloboquadrina pachyderma, occur during the Younger Dryas at this location. These isotopic and faunal changes are a response to either surface water temperature or salinity changes, or some combination of the two. Changes in surface salinities could have been accomplished through either local or global processes. Intensification of the monsoon climate system and increased precipitation at approximately 11 ka is one mechanism that may have resulted in local changes in salinity. A meltwater pulse derived from the Tibetan Plateau is another mechanism which may have caused local changes in salinity. The presence of the Younger Dryas in the tropical western Pacific clearly indicates that this climatic event is not restricted to the North Atlantic or high latitudes, but rather is global in extent.\n\nViscosity dictates metabolic activity of Vibrio ruber\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBoriÄ, Maja; DanevÄiÄ, TjaÅ¡a; Stopar, David\n\n2012-01-01\n\nLittle is known about metabolic activity of bacteria, when viscosity of their environment changes. In this work, bacterial metabolic activity in media with viscosity ranging from 0.8 to 29.4 mPas was studied. Viscosities up to 2.4 mPas did not affect metabolic activity of Vibrio ruber. On the other hand, at 29.4 mPas respiration rate and total dehydrogenase activity increased 8 and 4-fold, respectively. The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) increased up to 13-fold at higher viscosities. However, intensified metabolic activity did not result in faster growth rate. Increased viscosity delayed the onset as well as the duration of biosynthesis of prodigiosin. As an adaptation to viscous environment V. ruber increased metabolic flux through the pentose phosphate pathway and reduced synthesis of a secondary metabolite. In addition, V. ruber was able to modify the viscosity of its environment.

Here, we combine Mg/Ca-paleothermometry and stable oxygen isotope measurements on the planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber (white variety) from Florida Straits sediment core KNR166-2 JPC 51 (24Â° 24.70' N, 83Â° 13.14' W, 198 m deep) to reconstruct a high-resolution (Ë25 yr/sample) early to mid Holocene record of sea surface temperature and Î´18OSW (a proxy for SSS) variability. After removing the influence of global Î´18OSW change due to continental ice volume variability, we find that early Holocene SSS enrichments are associated with increased evaporation/precipitation ratios in the Florida Straits during periods of reduced solar forcing, increased ice rafted debris in the North Atlantic and the development of more permanent El NiÃ±o-like conditions in the eastern equatorial Pacific. When considered with previous high-resolution reconstructions of Holocene tropical atmospheric circulation changes, our results provide evidence that variations in solar forcing over the early Holocene had a significant impact on the global tropical hydrologic cycle.\n\nOrbital-scale denitrification changes in the Eastern Arabian Sea during the last 800 kyrs.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Ji-Eun; Khim, Boo-Keun; Ikehara, Minoru; Lee, Jongmin\n\n2018-05-04\n\nDenitrification in the Arabian Sea is closely related to the monsoon-induced upwelling and subsequent phytoplankton production in the surface water. The Î´ 15 N values of bulk sediments collected at Site U1456 of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 355 reveal the orbital-scale denitrification history in response to the Indian Monsoon. Age reconstruction based on the correlation of planktonic foraminifera (Globigerinoides ruber) Î´ 18 O values with the LR04 stack together with the shipboard biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data assigns the study interval to be 1.2âMa. Comparison of Î´ 15 N values during the last 800 kyrs between Site U1456 (Eastern Arabian Sea) and Site 722B (Western Arabian Sea) showed that Î´ 15 N values were high during interglacial periods, indicating intensified denitrification, while the opposite was observed during glacial periods. Taking 6â° as the empirical threshold of denitrification, the Eastern Arabian Sea has experienced a persistent oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) to maintain strong denitrification whereas the Western Arabian Sea has undergone OMZ breakdown during some glacial periods. The results of this study also suggests that five principal oceanographic conditions were changed in response to the Indian Monsoon following the interglacial and glacial cycles, which controls the degree of denitrification in the Arabian Sea.\n\nPlanktonic foraminiferal rare earth elements as a potential new aeolian dust proxy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChou, C.; Liu, Y.; Lo, L.; Wei, K.; Shen, C.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nCharacteristics of rare earth elements (REEs) have widely been used as important tracers in many fields of earth sciences, including lithosphere research, environmental change, ocean circulation and other natural carbonate materials. Foraminiferal test REE signatures have been suggested to reflect ambient seawater conditions and serve as valuable proxies in the fields of paleoceanography and paleoclimate. Here we present a 60-kyr planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber (white, 250-300 Î¼m) REE record of a sediment core MD05-2925 (9Â°20.61'S, 151Â°27.61'E, water depth 1660 m) from the Solomon Sea. The REE diagram shows two dominant sources of local seawater and nearby terrestrial input. The variability of foraminiferal REE/Ca time series is different from Mg/Ca-inferred sea surface temperature and Î´18O records during the past 60-kyr. This inconsistency suggests that planktonic foraminiferal REE content cannot result only from changes in ice volume and temperature. Synchroneity between high planktonic foraminiferal REE content and Antarctic ice core dust amount record implies the same dust sources, probably from Australia or mainland China. Our results suggest that foraminiferal REE can potentially be as a new dust proxy and record dry/humid conditions at the source area.\n\nCoupled sea surface temperature-seawater Î´18O reconstructions in the Arabian Sea at the millennial scale for the last 35 ka\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnand, Pallavi; Kroon, Dick; Singh, Arun Deo; Ganeshram, Raja S.; Ganssen, Gerald; Elderfield, Henry\n\n2008-12-01\n\nTwo sediment cores from the western (905; 10.46Â°9'N, 51.56Â°4'E, water depth 1586 m) and eastern (SK17; 15Â°15'N, 72Â°58'E, water depth 840 m) Arabian Sea were used to study past sea surface temperatures (SST) and seawater Î´18O (Î´18Ow) variations for the past 35 ka. We used coupled Mg/Ca-Î´18O calcite variability in two planktonic foraminiferal species: Globigerinoides ruber, which thrives throughout the year, and Globigerina bulloides, which occurs mainly when surface waters contain high nutrients during upwelling or convective mixing. SSTs in both areas based on Mg/Ca in G. ruber were Ë3 to 4Â°C lower during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; Ë21 ka) than today and the Holocene period. The SST records based on G. bulloides also indicate general cooling, down to 18Â°C in both areas. SSTs in the western Arabian Sea based on G. bulloides were always lower than those based on G. ruber, indicating the presence of strong seasonal temperature contrast during the Holocene and LGM. We interpret the consistent presence of this seasonal temperature contrast to reflect a combination of seasonal summer upwelling (SW monsoon) and winter convective mixing (NE monsoon) in the western Arabian Sea. In the eastern Arabian Sea, G. bulloides-based SSTs were slightly lower (about 1Â°C) than G. ruber-based SSTs during the Holocene, indicating the almost absence of a seasonal temperature gradient, similar to today. However, a large seasonal temperature contrast occurred during the LGM which favors the assumption that strong NE monsoon winds forced winter upwelling or convective mixing offshore Goa. SST and Î´18Ow reconstructions reveal evidence of millennial-scale cycles, particularly in the eastern Arabian Sea. Here, the stadial periods (Northern Hemisphere cold periods such as Younger Dryas and Heinrich events) are marked by increasing SSTs and salty sea surface conditions relative to those during the interstadial periods. Indeed, the Î´18Ow record shows evidence of low\n\nUnraveling Vital Effects: Photosynthesis of Symbiotic Algae in Foraminifera Hosts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFish, C.; Phelps, S. R.; Goes, J. I.; Hoenisch, B.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nB/Ca and boron isotope proxies recorded in the calcium carbonate shells of planktic foraminifera are sensitive to seawater acidity. We seek to understand how the biology of the organism affects the geochemical signals, as planktic foraminifera shells differ in their chemical composition from inorganic calcite and also between foraminifer species. These differences are most likely related to physiological processes like respiration, calcification, and photosynthesis in symbiont-bearing foraminifera. The modifications of geochemical signals by these biological parameters are termed vital effects. Our study is based on the hypothesis that the B/Ca and Î´11B offsets observed in planktic foraminifer shells are primarily due to the photosynthetic activity of their symbionts, which may elevate the microenvironmental pH to different degrees in different foraminifer species. Using fast repetition rate fluorometry, chlorophyll Î± analyses and symbiont counts, we investigated the symbiont-photosynthetic activity associated with three foraminifera species - Globigerinoides ruber, G. sacculifer, and Orbulina universa. Boron proxy systematics in these species suggest that photosynthetic activity should be greater in G. ruber compared to G. sacculifer and O. universa, but this is not confirmed by our study. While symbiont photosynthesis undoubtedly explains microenvironmental pH-elevation and boron proxy systematics in symbiont-bearing compared to symbiont-barren foraminifer species, additional processes must be responsible for the boron geochemical offsets between symbiont-bearing species. Respiration of the symbiont-host association and the calcification process are most likely candidates that require further analysis. Our study highlights the potential danger of misinterpreting geochemical signals in biological organisms when the biology of the organism in question is not entirely understood.\n\nLow planktic foraminiferal diversity and abundance observed in a spring 2013 west-east Mediterranean Sea plankton tow transect\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMallo, Miguel; Ziveri, Patrizia; Mortyn, P. Graham; Schiebel, Ralf; Grelaud, Michael\n\n2017-05-01\n\nPlanktic foraminifera were collected with 150 Âµm BONGO nets from the upper 200 m water depth at 20 stations across the Mediterranean Sea between 2 May and 2 June 2013. The main aim is to characterize the species distribution and test the covariance between foraminiferal area density (ÏA) and seawater carbonate chemistry in a biogeochemical gradient including ultraoligotrophic conditions. Average foraminifera abundances are 1.42 Â± 1.43 ind. 10 m-3 (ranging from 0.11 to 5.20 ind. 10 m-3), including 12 morphospecies. Large differences in species assemblages and total abundances are observed between the different Mediterranean sub-basins, with an overall dominance of spinose, symbiont-bearing species indicating oligotrophic conditions. The highest values in absolute abundance are found in the Strait of Gibraltar and the Alboran Sea. The western basin is dominated by Globorotalia inflata and Globigerina bulloides at slightly lower standing stocks than in the eastern basin. In contrast, the planktic foraminiferal assemblage in the warmer, saltier, and more nutrient-limited eastern basin is dominated by Globigerinoides ruber (white). These new results, when combined with previous findings, suggest that temperature-induced surface water stratification and food availability are the main factors controlling foraminiferal distribution. In the oligotrophic and highly alkaline and supersaturated with respect to calcite and aragonite Mediterranean surface water, standing stocks and ÏA of G. ruber (white) and G. bulloides are affected by both food availability and seawater carbonate chemistry. Rapid warming increased surface ocean stratification impacting food availability and changes in trophic conditions could be the causes of reduced foraminiferal abundance, diversity, and species-specific changes in planktic foraminiferal calcification.\n\nPaleoclimatic changes occurred during the last two centuries in the Gulf of Gaeta (central-eastern Tyrrhenian Sea): a contribution of NEXTDATA project\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLirer, Fabrizio; Vallefuoco, Mattia; Albertazzi, Sonia; Anzalone, Erlisiana; Bellucci, Luca; Bonomo, Sergio; Capotondi, Lucilla; Cascella, Antonio; Di Rita, Federico; Ferraro, Luciana; Florindo, Fabio; Giuliani, Silvia; Domenica Insinga, Donatella; Lurcock, Pont; Magri, Donatella; Margaritelli, Giulia; Marsella, Ennio; Petrosino, Paola; Sprovieri, Mario; Sorgato, Stefania\n\n2014-05-01\n\nA high-resolution integrated study, which includes tephrochronology (tefra layer associated to 1906 AD Vesuvius event) and radionuclide dating method (210Pb and 137Cs), has been performed in a super-expanded marine record (sedimentation rate of 0.47 cm/yr) from the continental shelf of the Gulf of Gaeta (central eastern Tyrrhenian Sea). Planktonic foraminifera, calcareous nannofossils, pollens and oxygen stable isotope data performed on Globigerinoides ruber, revealed environmental changes occurred during the last two centuries. In detail we recognise four paleoclimatic changes. From ca. 1800 to ca. 1865 AD, d18O G. ruber signal combined with evidences of abundance increase of planktonic foraminifera Globoratialia inflata and G. truncatulinoides and of calcareous nannofossils Emiliana huxley document cold-temperate phase. Between ca. 1865 and ca. 1882 AD, d18O G. ruber record document a short warm interval associated with a turnover from carnivorous to herbivorous-opportunistic planktonic foraminiferal species and an increase in abundance of calcareous nannofossil Florisphaera profunda. At ca. 1935 AD, d18O G. ruber data indicate a gradually warming, concomitant an evident turnover from carnivorous to herbivorous-opportunistic planktonic foraminiferal species, and associated to the increase of calcareous nannofossil F. profunda. From ca. 1950 AD to the present day the warm phase documents a further strong increase in G. ruber alba, G. quadrilobatus and F. profunda abundances. The pollen analysis carried out on the same core revealed a two-step increase in arboreal vegetation, this is mostly related to a rise of Olea, Quercus evergreen and riparian trees (Alnus and Salix) from ca. 1882 AD, and increase in conifers (Pinus and Cupressaceae) from ca. 1980 AD. The short lived warm interval documented by d18O between ca. 1865 and ca. 1882 AD may triggered the increase in Olea and the coeval general decrease in deciduous trees. Among herbs, Cyperaceae, along with ferns\n\nMg/Ca in foraminifera from plankton tows: Evaluation of proxy controls and comparison with core tops\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMartÃ­nez-BotÃ­, M. A.; Mortyn, P. G.; Schmidt, D. N.; Vance, D.; Field, D. B.\n\n2011-07-01\n\nCalibrations and validations of the Mg/Ca paleothermometer in planktic foraminifera have traditionally been performed by means of core tops, sediment trap samples and culture experiments. In this study, Mg/Ca ratios have been measured in 8 species of planktic foraminifera (non-globorotaliids Globigerina bulloides, Neogloboquadrina incompta, Orbulina universa, Globigerinoides ruber (white) and G. sacculifer, and globorotaliids Globorotalia inflata, G. hirsuta and G. truncatulinoides), collected live from the North Atlantic, the Southeast Atlantic, the Northeast Pacific and the Norwegian Sea. Mg/Ca ratios for N. incompta, O. universa, G. ruber, G. sacculifer and G. truncatulinoides are similar to available North Atlantic core-top studies and consistent with previous calibration equations. In contrast, some G. bulloides, G. inflata and G. hirsuta Mg/Ca ratios are higher than predicted based on Î´ 18O values, and exhibit considerable scatter. This elevation may be in part related to the impact of potential isotopic disequilibrium effects on Î´ 18O-derived temperatures, which the Mg/Ca ratios are compared to. Another factor that may affect Mg/Ca ratios in some plankton samples is the lack of low-Mg test components (e.g., final chambers or gametogenic calcite), because of the incompleteness of the life cycle at the time of collection. N. incompta Mg/Ca ratios are correlated with salinity, with Mg/Ca changing about 16% per salinity unit, suggesting that salinity may have an important influence on Mg/Ca of some species even in non-extreme salinity environments. This is the first extensive multispecific plankton tow Mg/Ca data set from different oceanographic regions, which has been used to test the Mg/Ca temperature proxy in the context of published calibration data, highlighting the complex physiological/ecological controls on the acquisition of the proxy signal.\n\nSize-dependent response of foraminiferal calcification to seawater carbonate chemistry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHenehan, Michael J.; Evans, David; Shankle, Madison; Burke, Janet E.; Foster, Gavin L.; Anagnostou, Eleni; Chalk, Thomas B.; Stewart, Joseph A.; Alt, Claudia H. S.; Durrant, Joseph; Hull, Pincelli M.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe response of the marine carbon cycle to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations will be determined, in part, by the relative response of calcifying and non-calcifying organisms to global change. Planktonic foraminifera are responsible for a quarter or more of global carbonate production, therefore understanding the sensitivity of calcification in these organisms to environmental change is critical. Despite this, there remains little consensus as to whether, or to what extent, chemical and physical factors affect foraminiferal calcification. To address this, we directly test the effect of multiple controls on calcification in culture experiments and core-top measurements of Globigerinoides ruber. We find that two factors, body size and the carbonate system, strongly influence calcification intensity in life, but that exposure to corrosive bottom waters can overprint this signal post mortem. Using a simple model for the addition of calcite through ontogeny, we show that variable body size between and within datasets could complicate studies that examine environmental controls on foraminiferal shell weight. In addition, we suggest that size could ultimately play a role in determining whether calcification will increase or decrease with acidification. Our models highlight that knowledge of the specific morphological and physiological mechanisms driving ontogenetic change in calcification in different species will be critical in predicting the response of foraminiferal calcification to future change in atmospheric pCO2.\n\nUnderstanding the Effects of Dissolution on the Mg/Ca Paleothermometer in Planktic Foraminifera: Evidence From a Novel Individual Foraminifera Method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRongstad, Brigitta L.; Marchitto, Thomas M.; Herguera, Juan Carlos\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIt is well documented that partial dissolution of planktic foraminiferal tests results in a reduction of Mg/Ca ratios, and hence of inferred calcification temperatures; however, traditional analysis techniques have made it difficult to identify the exact mechanism through which Mg is lost. Three hypotheses have been proposed as models for Mg loss for a given extent of dissolution: (1) a percent loss of Mg in individuals, (2) a molar loss of Mg in individuals, and (3) a loss of the highest-Mg (warmest) individuals from a population. It is vital to better constrain these models as they have very different implications for Mg/Ca paleotemperature dissolution corrections. Here we use a novel individual foraminifera Mg/Ca method to examine the effects of dissolution on the Mg/Ca paleothermometer in three species of planktic foraminifera, Globigerinoides ruber, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, and Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, from a depth transect of core tops on the Ontong Java Plateau in the western equatorial Pacific. With the exception of the most heavily dissolved population of P. obliquiloculata, our data best support a percent Mg loss model as indicated by the preservation of inferred temperature distribution shapes among the sampled populations and the close fit of the simulated percent Mg loss model to the observed data. Coupled with estimates for foraminiferal dissolution, identification of the percent Mg loss model will allow for more accurate dissolution corrections in Mg/Ca paleothermometry work.\n\n1400 yr multiproxy record of climate variability from the northern Gulf of Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nRichey, J.N.; Poore, R.Z.; Flower, B.P.; Quinn, T.M.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nA continuous decadal-scale resolution record of climate variability over the past 1400 yr in the northern Gulf of Mexico was constructed from a box core recovered in the Pigmy Basin, northern Gulf of Mexico. Proxies include paired analyses of Mg/Ca and Î´18O in the white variety of the planktic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber and relative abundance variations of G. sacculifer in the foraminifer assemblages. Two multi-decadal intervals of sustained high Mg/Ca indicate that Gulf of Mexico sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were as warm or warmer than near-modern conditions between 1000 and 1400 yr B.P. Foraminiferal Mg/Ca during the coolest interval of the Little Ice Age (ca. 250 yr B.P.) indicate that SST was 2â2.5 Â°C below modern SST. Four minima in the Mg/Ca record between 900 and 250 yr B.P. correspond with the Maunder, SpÃ¶rer, Wolf, and Oort sunspot minima, suggesting a link between changes in solar insolation and SST variability in the Gulf of Mexico. An abrupt shift recorded in both Î´18Ocalcite and relative abundance of G. sacculifer occurred ca. 600 yr B.P. The shift in the Pigmy Basin record corresponds with a shift in the sea-salt-sodium (ssNa) record from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core, linking changes in high-latitude atmospheric circulation with the subtropical Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHolocene aridification of India\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nPonton, C.; Giosan, L.; Eglinton, T.I.; Fuller, D.Q.; Johnson, J.E.; Kumar, P.; Collett, T.S.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSpanning a latitudinal range typical for deserts, the Indian peninsula is fertile instead and sustains over a billion people through monsoonal rains. Despite the strong link between climate and society, our knowledge of the long-term monsoon variability is incomplete over the Indian subcontinent. Here we reconstruct the Holocene paleoclimate in the core monsoon zone (CMZ) of the Indian peninsula using a sediment core recovered offshore from the mouth of Godavari River. Carbon isotopes of sedimentary leaf waxes provide an integrated and regionally extensive record of the flora in the CMZ and document a gradual increase in aridity-adapted vegetation from ???4,000 until 1,700 years ago followed by the persistence of aridity-adapted plants after that. The oxygen isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber detects unprecedented high salinity events in the Bay of Bengal over the last 3,000 years, and especially after 1,700 years ago, which suggest that the CMZ aridification intensified in the late Holocene through a series of sub-millennial dry episodes. Cultural changes occurred across the Indian subcontinent as the climate became more arid after ???4,000 years. Sedentary agriculture took hold in the drying central and south India, while the urban Harappan civilization collapsed in the already arid Indus basin. The establishment of a more variable hydroclimate over the last ca. 1,700 years may have led to the rapid proliferation of water-conservation technology in south India.

Differences in Î´18O between mixed-layer species G. ruber and G. bulloides and thermocline-dweller G. menardii track seasonal changes in upwelling. The records suggest an increase in upwelling during the peak positive phase of El NiÃ±o, and an overall reduction in stratification over the six-year period. For all three species, Mg/Ca ratios are higher than what has been reported in previous studies, and show poor correlations to calcification temperature. We suggest that low pH (7.6-8.0) and [3 2-CO] values (â¼70-120 Î¼mol/kg) in the mixed layer contribute to an overall trend of higher Mg/Ca ratios in this region. Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry analyses of G. bulloides with high Mg/Ca ratios (>9 mmol/mol) reveal the presence of a secondary coating of inorganic calcite that has Mg/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios up to an order of magnitude higher than these elemental ratios in the primary calcite, along with elevated Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios. Some of the samples with abnormally high Mg/Ca are found during periods of high primary productivity, suggesting the alteration may be related to changes in carbonate saturation resulting from remineralization of organic matter in oxygen-poor waters in the water column. Although similar shell layering has been observed on fossil foraminifera, this is the first time such alteration has been studied in shells collected from the water column. Our results suggest a role for seawater carbonate chemistry in influencing foraminiferal calcite trace element:calcium ratios prior to deposition on the seafloor, particularly in high-productivity, low\n\n[Proposed neotype Streptomyces ruber (Krainsky, 1914) Waksman et Henrici, 1948].\n\nPubMed\n\nKuznetsov, V D; Filippova, S N; Poltorak, V A\n\n1987-01-01\n\nCulture 78 was proposed as a neotype of Streptomyces ruber. It was isolated from the soils of the Baikal region and was closest, in its taxonomic properties, to the original description of the species [13] whose representative had been lost. Cultures from different microbial collections designated as S. ruber were shown to be unlike the original description. The neotype had the following taxononic properties: the cell wall of type I; spiral sporophores with extended spirals having 2-3 coils; oval spores with a smooth envelope; greyish pink aerial and dark-red substrate mycelia; a red pigment not passing into the medium; slow gelatin liquefaction and milk peptonization; weak starch hydrolysis; assimilation of glucose, xylose, rammose, fructose, and inositol; weak growth on arabinose, raffinose and mannitol, but not on sucrose; no formation of melanoid pigments; synthesis of riboflavin and prodigiosin pigments; inhibition of Gram-positive bacterial and acid-resistant mycobacterial growth; no inhibition of yeast and fungal growth. The culture was sensitive to streptomycin, neomycin, gentamycin, monomycin, tetracycline,erythromycin, oleandomycin, lincomycin, ristomycin, levomycetin, polymyxin and fusidin, but resistant in penicillin. The population was composed of six variants [3]: main, faded, asporogenic red, asporogenic yellow, asporogenic white and nocardia-like. The latter two were not capable of riboflavin and prodigiosin formation. The asporogenic yellow variant was a monosynthetic organism: it formed riboflavin, but could not synthesize prodigiosin. The neotype of S. ruber 78 is deposited withthe national Collection of Microorganisms (the reference number is VKM A-611).\n\nCentral Equatorial Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures During the Last Glacial Maximum\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMonteagudo, M. M.; Lynch-Stieglitz, J.; Schmidt, M. W.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe state of the tropical Pacific ocean-atmosphere system during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 19,000-23,000 years BP) remains an area of uncertainty. Spatial patterns of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) offer insight into atmospheric circulation (i.e. Walker Circulation), however, few records exist for the Central Tropical Pacific (CTP). The few existing glacial CTP SST reconstructions indicate 1-2 Â°C of warming based on foraminiferal transfer functions (CLIMAP Project Members, 1976). In contrast, evidence from geochemical proxies (Mg/Ca, UK'37, TEX86) show 1-3.5 Â°C cooling in the eastern and western tropical Pacific (e.g. MARGO Project Members, 2009). In this study we present the first Mg/Ca estimates of glacial CTP SST from a meridional sediment core transect along the Line Islands Ridge (0-7Â°N, 156-162 Â°W). We use a time slice approach to establish the magnitude of glacial-interglacial SST change between the LGM (19,000-23,0000 years BP) and the Holocene (0-10,000 years BP) using Mg/Ca in the surface-dwelling foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber. Our results indicate cooling at all latitudes, ranging between 1.2-2.7 Â°C (Holocene-LGM SST). Northern cores (6.83-2.77 Â°N) exhibit a smaller glacial-interglacial SST difference than equatorial site 20BB at 1.27 Â°N. The data generated thus far suggest the glacial meridional SST gradient may have been steeper, possibly as a result of increased zonal winds, equatorial upwelling, or westward expansion of the Eastern Pacific Cold Tongue.\n\nThirteen thousand years of southeastern Mediterranean climate variability inferred from an integrative planktic foraminiferal-based approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMojtahid, Meryem; Manceau, Rose; Schiebel, Ralf; Hennekam, Rick; de Lange, Gert J.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nOver the past 13 ka, the hydrology for the southeastern Mediterranean was mainly regulated by Nile River runoff, which in turn was controlled by climate forcing. Being affected by orbital forcing, and the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), planktic foraminiferal data (assemblages, stable isotopes, and size properties) indicate three major periods. (1) From 13.0 to 11.5 ka, the upper water column was well-mixed, cold, and productive. (2) From 11.5 to 6.4 ka, hydrology and foraminifers were affected by intensified monsoonal circulation. The enhanced size of Globigerinoides ruber is interpreted as a response to environmental stress caused by low-saline waters. (3) After 6.4 ka, the southward retreat of the ITCZ caused a decrease in freshwater discharge and hence a return to ecological equilibrium. A drop in foraminifer diversity from 2.9 to 1.1 ka was related to more arid conditions, and limited supply of nutrients from the Nile River. We suggest a link to a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) marking the Roman Humid Period in the western Mediterranean, and in anti-phase with the southeastern Mediterranean aridity. Because Nile River runoff exerted major control on surface hydrology, a connection to Indian and Pacific climate systems partially controlling precipitation over the Nile catchment area is hypothesized. From 1.1 to 0.54 ka, high foraminifer diversity indicates humid conditions synchronous to the Medieval Climate Anomaly under a positive NAO state. Over the past 0.54 ka encompassing the Little Ice Age, another arid period is indicated by a drop in foraminifer diversity.\n\nPlanktonic foraminiferal abnormalities in coastal and open marine eastern Mediterranean environments: A natural stress monitoring approach in recent and early Holocene marine systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAntonarakou, A.; Kontakiotis, G.; Zarkogiannis, S.; Mortyn, P. G.; Drinia, H.; Koskeridou, E.; Anastasakis, G.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nMarine environmental status can be assessed through the study of bio-indicator species. Here, we monitor natural environmental stress by the occurrence of morphologically abnormal planktonic foraminiferal specimens from a suite of surface sediments in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We also compare Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) abnormality observations from sapropel S1-derived sediments in the Aegean, Libyan and Levantine basins, since they provide a direct record of a natural stress experiment that took place over past time scales. At initial sapropel deposition levels, we observe increased growth asymmetry in Globigerinoides ruber twinned and twisted individuals, possibly associated with eutrophication and anoxia. In modern material, a range of malformations and aberrant morphologies from slight deformity with smaller or overdeveloped chambers to more severe deformity with abnormally protruding or misplaced chambers, distorted spirals, and double tests is also observed, as a result of the hypersaline, oligotrophic and oxygen-depleted nature of the Mediterranean Sea water column. Overall, we highlight the current use of the relative abundance of abnormal tests as a bio-indicator for monitoring natural stress, especially the occurrence of twin specimens as indicative of high-salinity stress conditions, and further illustrate the necessity to map both their spatial and temporal distribution for accurate paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Such an approach presents the advantage to rapidly provide information over wide spatial and temporal scales, extending our ability to monitor a wide variety of environments (from coastal to the open-sea). However, further investigations should extend this approach to test the robustness of our findings in a number of similar oceanic settings.\n\nCentennial-scale winter climate variability over the last two millennia in the northern Gulf of Mexico based on paired Î´18O and Mg/Ca in Globorotalia truncatulinoides\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFortiz, V.; Thirumalai, K.; Richey, J.

M.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nWe present a replicated record of paired foraminiferal Î´18O and Mg/Ca variations in multi-cores collected from the Garrison Basin (26Âº43'N, 93Âº55'W) in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Using Î´18O (sea surface temperature, SST; sea surface salinity, SSS proxy) and Mg/Ca (SST proxy) variations in non-encrusted planktic foraminifer Globorotalia truncatulinoides we produce time series spanning the last two millennia that is characterized by centennial-scale climate variability. We interpret geochemical variations in G. truncatulinoides to reflect winter climate variability because data from a sediment trap, located ~350 km east of the core site, reveal that annual flux of G. truncatulinoides is heavily weighted towards winter (peak production in January-February; Spear et al., 2011). Similar centennial-scale variability is also observed in the foraminiferal geochemistry of Globigerinoides ruber in the same multi-cores, which likely reflect mean annual climate variations. Our replicated results and comparisons to other SST reconstructions from the region lend confidence that the northern GOM surface ocean underwent large, centennial-scale variability, most likely dominated by changes in winter climate. This variability occurred in a time period where climate forcing is small and background conditions are similar to pre-industrial times.

LP is the main representative and namesake of the group of lichenoid diseases, which are characterized by small papules often accompanied by severe itching. With 65% of cases, LP is primarily aÂ disease of the mucous membranes. In 20% of the cases, the disease is found on the skin and mucous membranes; skin involvement alone is seen in only about 10% of cases. Cutaneous LP has aÂ very favorable 1âyear prognosis of almost 80% healing as opposed to the mucosa and the adnexal organs. Histologically, keratinocytes with vacuolar degeneration, leaving behind apoptotic Kamino bodies and the characteristic band-shaped lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermatoepithelial junction, are common to lichenoid diseases. The horny layer is firm and compact and the stratum granulosum is thickened as aÂ correlate of the Wickham stripes. The molecular pathogenesis, still partially hypothetical, assumes trigger factors leading to the presentation of intrinsic or foreign antigens. The triggered inflammation becomes independent in the sense of aÂ classical cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Other autoimmune diseases are often associated with LP. Classical anti-inflammatory-immunosuppressive therapeutic concepts dominate with systemic retinoids ranking first in the highest evidence class for cutaneous LP with limitations in treatment of both mucosal and adnexal LP. More recently, interesting and new complementary phototherapeutics have been identified.\n\nMolecular characterization of three 3-ketosteroid-Î(1)-dehydrogenase isoenzymes of Rhodococcus ruber strain Chol-4.\n\nPubMed\n\nFernÃ¡ndez de las Heras, Laura; van der Geize, Robert; Drzyzga, Oliver; Perera, JuliÃ¡n; MarÃ­a Navarro Llorens, Juana\n\n2012-11-01\n\nRhodococcus ruber strain Chol-4 isolated from a sewage sludge sample is able to grow on minimal medium supplemented with steroids, showing a broad catabolic capacity. This paper reports the characterization of three different 3-ketosteroid-Î(1)-dehydrogenases (KstDs) in the genome of R. ruber strain Chol-4. The genome of this strain does not contain any homologues of a 3-keto-5Î±-steroid-Î(4)-dehydrogenase (Kst4d or TesI) that appears in the genomes of Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1 or Comamonas testosteroni. Growth experiments with kstD2 mutants, either a kstD2 single mutant, kstD2 double mutants in combination with kstD1 or kstD3, or the triple kstD1,2,3 mutant, proved that KstD2 is involved in the transformation of 4-androstene-3,17"
