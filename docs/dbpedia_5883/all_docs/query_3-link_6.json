There are at least 40 species described within the Cronartium genus, of which two are considered native to the EU (C. gentianeum and C. pini) and one has been introduced in the 19th century (C. ribicola) and is now widespread in the EU – these three species are thus not part of this pest categorisation. In addition, the non‐EU C. harknessii, C. kurilense and C. sahoanum were already dealt with in a previous pest categorisation. All the non‐EU Cronartium species are not known to be present in the EU and are regulated in Council Directive 2000/29/EC (Annex IAI) as harmful organisms whose introduction into the EU is banned. Cronartium spp. are biotrophic obligate plant pathogens. Many of the North American Cronartium species alternate between the aecial host Pinus spp. and telial hosts of various dicotyledonous plants. C. conigenum, C. orientale, C. quercuum and C. strobilinum have different Quercus spp. as their telial hosts. C. orientale and C. quercuum also infect Castanea spp. and Castanopsis spp. The pathogens could enter the EU via host plants for planting and cut flowers and branches. Non‐EU Cronartium spp. could establish in the EU, as climatic conditions are favourable to many of them and Pinus and Quercus spp. are common. The pathogens would be able to spread following establishment by movement of host plants, as well as natural spread. Should non‐EU Cronartium spp. be introduced in the EU, impacts can be expected on pine, oak and chestnut woodlands, plantations, ornamental trees and nurseries. The Cronartium species present in North America cause important tree diseases. Symptoms on Pinus spp. differ between Cronartium spp., but include galls, cankers, dieback of branches and stems, deformity, tree and cone death. The main knowledge gap concerns the limited available information on (sub)tropical Cronartium spp. The criteria assessed by the Panel for consideration of Cronartium spp. (non‐EU) as potential quarantine pests are met, while, for regulated non‐quarantine pests, the criterion on the pest presence in the EU is not met.\n\nKeywords: European Union, forest pathology, pest risk, plant health, plant pest, quarantine, tree health\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1. Background and Terms of Reference as provided by the requestor\n\n1.1.1. Background\n\nCouncil Directive 2000/29/EC1 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community establishes the present European Union plant health regime. The Directive lays down the phytosanitary provisions and the control checks to be carried out at the place of origin on plants and plant products destined for the Union or to be moved within the Union. In the Directive's 2000/29/EC annexes, the list of harmful organisms (pests) whose introduction into or spread within the Union is prohibited, is detailed together with specific requirements for import or internal movement.\n\nFollowing the evaluation of the plant health regime, the new basic plant health law, Regulation (EU) 2016/20312 on protective measures against pests of plants, was adopted on 26 October 2016 and will apply from 14 December 2019 onwards, repealing Directive 2000/29/EC. In line with the principles of the above mentioned legislation and the follow‐up work of the secondary legislation for the listing of EU regulated pests, EFSA is requested to provide pest categorizations of the harmful organisms included in the annexes of Directive 2000/29/EC, in the cases where recent pest risk assessment/pest categorisation is not available.\n\n1.1.2. Terms of reference\n\nEFSA is requested, pursuant to Article 22(5.b) and Article 29(1) of Regulation (EC) No 178/20023, to provide scientific opinion in the field of plant health.\n\nEFSA is requested to prepare and deliver a pest categorisation (step 1 analysis) for each of the regulated pests included in the appendices of the annex to this mandate. The methodology and template of pest categorisation have already been developed in past mandates for the organisms listed in Annex II Part A Section II of Directive 2000/29/EC. The same methodology and outcome is expected for this work as well.\n\nThe list of the harmful organisms included in the annex to this mandate comprises 133 harmful organisms or groups. A pest categorisation is expected for these 133 pests or groups and the delivery of the work would be stepwise at regular intervals through the year as detailed below. First priority covers the harmful organisms included in Appendix 1, comprising pests from Annex II Part A Section I and Annex II Part B of Directive 2000/29/EC. The delivery of all pest categorisations for the pests included in Appendix 1 is June 2018. The second priority is the pests included in Appendix 2, comprising the group of Cicadellidae (non‐EU) known to be vector of Pierce's disease (caused by Xylella fastidiosa), the group of Tephritidae (non‐EU), the group of potato viruses and virus‐like organisms, the group of viruses and virus‐like organisms of Cydonia Mill., Fragaria L., Malus Mill., Prunus L., Pyrus L., Ribes L., Rubus L. and Vitis L. and the group of Margarodes (non‐EU species). The delivery of all pest categorisations for the pests included in Appendix 2 is end 2019. The pests included in Appendix 3 cover pests of Annex I part A section I and all pests categorisations should be delivered by end 2020.\n\nFor the above mentioned groups, each covering a large number of pests, the pest categorisation will be performed for the group and not the individual harmful organisms listed under “such as” notation in the Annexes of the Directive 2000/29/EC. The criteria to be taken particularly under consideration for these cases, is the analysis of host pest combination, investigation of pathways, the damages occurring and the relevant impact.\n\nFinally, as indicated in the text above, all references to ‘non‐European’ should be avoided and replaced by ‘non‐EU’ and refer to all territories with exception of the Union territories as defined in Article 1 point 3 of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031.\n\n1.1.2.1.

Interpretation of the Terms of Reference\n\nCronartium spp. (non‐EU) is one of a number of pests listed in the Appendices to the Terms of Reference (ToR) to be subject to pest categorisation to determine whether it fulfils the criteria of a quarantine pest or those of a regulated non‐quarantine pest (RNQP) for the area of the EU.\n\nThe term ‘non‐EU’ species is interpreted to refer to those Cronartium spp. native outside of the EU, and, if introduced in the EU, with restricted distribution and under official control.\n\nThere are two Cronartium species that are native to the EU: Cronartium pini (synonym: Cronartium flaccidum) (Kummer and Klenke, 2015; CABI, 2018) and Cronartium gentianeum (Klebahn, 1939; Widder, 1941) – these species are thus not part of this pest categorisation.\n\nCronartium ribicola, the fungus causing white pine blister rust (Geils et al., 2010), is considered to have its centre of origin most likely in central Eurasia (East of the Ural mountains) (Hummer, 2000), but given that C. ribicola was reported in Europe already in the mid‐1800s and that it is now widespread in the EU (EPPO, 2018), this species is not included in this pest categorisation.\n\nIn addition, the non‐EU C. harknessii, C. kurilense and C. sahoanum are not considered in this pest categorisation, as they were already dealt with in a previous one (EFSA PLH Panel, 2018a).\n\n2. Data and methodologies\n\n2.1. Data\n\n2.1.1. Literature search\n\nA literature search on Cronartium spp. was conducted at the beginning of the categorisation in the ISI Web of Science bibliographic database, using the scientific name of the pest as search term. Relevant papers were reviewed and further references and information were obtained from experts, as well as from citations within the references and grey literature.\n\n2.1.2. Database search\n\nPest information, on host(s) and distribution, was retrieved from the European and Mediterranean Plan Protection Organization (EPPO) Global Database (EPPO, 2018) and relevant publications.\n\nData about the import of commodity types that could potentially provide a pathway for the pest to enter the EU and about the area of hosts grown in the EU were obtained from EUROSTAT (Statistical Office of the European Communities).\n\nThe Europhyt database was consulted for pest‐specific notifications on interceptions and outbreaks. Europhyt is a web‐based network run by the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) of the European Commission, and is a subproject of PHYSAN (Phyto‐Sanitary Controls) specifically concerned with plant health information. The Europhyt database manages notifications of interceptions of plants or plant products that do not comply with EU legislation, as well as notifications of plant pests detected in the territory of the Member States (MS) and the phytosanitary measures taken to eradicate or avoid their spread.\n\n2.2. Methodologies\n\nThe Panel performed the pest categorisation for Cronartium spp. (non‐EU), following guiding principles and steps presented in the EFSA guidance presented in the EFSA guidance on quantitative pest risk assessment (EFSA PLH Panel, 2018b) and as defined in the International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No 11 (FAO, 2013) and No 21 (FAO, 2004).\n\nIn accordance with the guidance quantitative pest risk assessment (EFSA PLH Panel, 2018b), this work was started following an evaluation of the EU plant health regime. Therefore, to facilitate the decision‐making process, in the conclusions of the pest categorisation, the Panel addresses explicitly each criterion for a Union quarantine pest and for a Union RNQP in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 on protective measures against pests of plants, and includes additional information required in accordance with the specific terms of reference received by the European Commission. In addition, for each conclusion, the Panel provides a short description of its associated uncertainty.\n\nTable presents the Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 pest categorisation criteria on which the Panel bases its conclusions. All relevant criteria have to be met for the pest to potentially qualify either as a quarantine pest or as a RNQP. If one of the criteria is not met, the pest will not qualify. A pest that does not qualify as a quarantine pest may still qualify as a RNQP that needs to be addressed in the opinion. For the pests regulated in the protected zones only, the scope of the categorisation is the territory of the protected zone; thus, the criteria refer to the protected zone instead of the EU territory.\n\nTable 1\n\nCriterion of pest categorisationCriterion in Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 regarding Union quarantine pestCriterion in Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 regarding protected zone quarantine pest (articles 32–35)Criterion in Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 regarding Union regulated non‐quarantine pest Identity of the pest (Section 3.1 ) Is the identity of the pest established, or has it been shown to produce consistent symptoms and to be transmissible?Is the identity of the pest established, or has it been shown to produce consistent symptoms and to be transmissible?Is the identity of the pest established, or has it been shown to produce consistent symptoms and to be transmissible? Absence/presence of the pest in the EU territory (Section 3.2 )\n\nIs the pest present in the EU territory?\n\nIf present, is the pest widely distributed within the EU? Describe the pest distribution briefly!\n\nIs the pest present in the EU territory? If not, it cannot be a protected zone quarantine organismIs the pest present in the EU territory? If not, it cannot be a RNQP. (A RNQP must be present in the risk assessment area) Regulatory status (Section 3.3 ) If the pest is present in the EU but not widely distributed in the risk assessment area, it should be under official control or expected to be under official control in the near future.\n\nThe protected zone system aligns with the pest free area system under the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC)\n\nThe pest satisfies the IPPC definition of a quarantine pest that is not present in the risk assessment area (i.e. protected zone)\n\nIs the pest regulated as a quarantine pest? If currently regulated as a quarantine pest, are there grounds to consider its status could be revoked? Pest potential for entry, establishment and spread in the EU territory (Section 3.4 ) Is the pest able to enter into, become established in, and spread within, the EU territory? If yes, briefly list the pathways!\n\nIs the pest able to enter into, become established in, and spread within, the protected zone areas?\n\nIs entry by natural spread from EU areas where the pest is present possible?\n\nIs spread mainly via specific plants for planting, rather than via natural spread or via movement of plant products or other objects?\n\nClearly state if plants for planting is the main pathway!\n\nPotential for consequences in the EU territory (Section 3.5 ) Would the pests’ introduction have an economic or environmental impact on the EU territory?Would the pests’ introduction have an economic or environmental impact on the protected zone areas?Does the presence of the pest on plants for planting have an economic impact, as regards the intended use of those plants for planting? Available measures (Section 3.6 ) Are there measures available to prevent the entry into, establishment within or spread of the pest within the EU such that the risk becomes mitigated?\n\nAre there measures available to prevent the entry into, establishment within or spread of the pest within the protected zone areas such that the risk becomes mitigated?\n\nIs it possible to eradicate the pest in a restricted area within 24 months (or a period longer than 24 months where the biology of the organism so justifies) after the presence of the pest was confirmed in the protected zone?\n\nAre there measures available to prevent pest presence on plants for planting such that the risk becomes mitigated? Conclusion of pest categorisation (Section 4 ) A statement as to whether (1) all criteria assessed by EFSA above for consideration as a potential quarantine pest were met and (2) if not, which one(s) were not metA statement as to whether (1) all criteria assessed by EFSA above for consideration as potential protected zone quarantine pest were met, and (2) if not, which one(s) were not metA statement as to whether (1) all criteria assessed by EFSA above for consideration as a potential RNQP were met, and (2) if not, which one(s) were not met\n\nIt should be noted that the Panel's conclusions are formulated respecting its remit and particularly with regard to the principle of separation between risk assessment and risk management (EFSA founding regulation (EU) No 178/2002); therefore, instead of determining whether the pest is likely to have an unacceptable impact, the Panel will present a summary of the observed pest impacts. Economic impacts are expressed in terms of yield and quality losses and not in monetary terms, whereas addressing social impacts is outside the remit of the Panel, in agreement with the EFSA guidance on quantitative pest risk assessment (EFSA PLH Panel, 2018b).\n\nThe Panel will not indicate in its conclusions of the pest categorisation whether to continue the risk assessment process, but following the agreed two‐step approach, will continue only if requested by the risk managers. However, during the categorisation process, experts may identify key elements and knowledge gaps that could contribute significant uncertainty to a future assessment of risk. It would be useful to identify and highlight such gaps so that potential future requests can specifically target the major elements of uncertainty, perhaps suggesting specific scenarios to examine.\n\n3. Pest categorisation\n\n3.1. Identity and biology of the pest\n\n3.1.1. Identity and taxonomy\n\nIs the identity of the pest established, or has it been shown to produce consistent symptoms and to be transmissible?\n\nYes, Cronartium is a valid genus containing several species of known plant pathogens.\n\nCronartium is a genus of fungi of the family Cronartiaceae. There are at least 40 species listed within the genus (Table ; http://www.indexfungorum.org), but this is likely to change because of ongoing taxonomic revisions. Many more species within the genus have been described earlier, but they have either been reclassified as belonging to other genera or been merged together with currently described species.\n\nTable 2\n\nSpecies nameDistributionEPPO GDPresent in the EU Cronartium andinum EcuadorNo– Cronartium antidesmae‐dioicae South Africa, Ivory Coast, Uganda, China, Indonesia, Japan, New Guinea, Philippines, VietnamNo– Cronartium appalachianum Southern Appalachians (USA)No– Cronartium arizonicum South‐western USA, South Dakota, Mexico, GuatemalaNo– Cronartium balsaminae Austria (Magnus, 1905), Germany (Klebahn, 1890)NoYes?

Other species are genetically similar to species within the Cronartium genus, but since they are autoecious and endocyclic they had been classified as belonging to the genus Endocronartium. In accordance with the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (McNeill et al., 2012), Endocronartium species have been moved to the genus Cronartium, e.g. Endocronartium harknessii (renamed as Cronartium harknessii), Endocronartium sahoanum var. hokkaidoense (renamed as Cronartium kurilense), E. sahoanum var. sahoanum (renamed as Cronartium sahoanum) and Endocronartium yamabense (renamed as Cronartium yamabense) (Aime et al., 2018). Some asexual morphs recognised in the genus Peridermium have also been recently suggested to belong to the genus Cronartium, e.g. Cronartium bethelii (Aime et al., 2018). Although these proposals have been taken on board by Index Fungorum, given the separate request to conduct a pest categorisation on Endocronartium spp. (non‐EU), the Panel opted for dealing with these former Endocronartium spp. (non‐EU) in a separate pest categorisation (EFSA PLH Panel, 2018a) (see Section 1.2).\n\nThe ongoing reclassification of Cronartium species implies that the number of species included in the genus may be revised in the future. Cronartium is nevertheless a valid genus containing numerous well‐known plant pathogens.\n\nThree Cronartium spp. are reported as present in Europe, Cronartium gentianeum, Cronartium pini and Cronartium ribicola (see Section 1.2). The species C. pini has many synonyms consisting of earlier described separate species, e.g. C. flaccidum and C. asclepiadeum (http://www.indexfungorum.org). Another six species are suggested to be conspecific with C. flaccidum (Farr and Rossman, 2018), which in turn is considered conspecific with C. pini (http://www.indexfungorum.org), i.e. a species with a Eurasian distribution.\n\nThe species status of another three of the included species is unclear and they have been suggested to be synonymous of other Cronartium spp. (Cronartium filamentosum, Cronartium opheliae and Cronartium pedicularis).\n\nThere is very limited information for most of the species reported from tropical or subtropical countries.\n\n3.1.2. Biology of the pest\n\nMany of the North American Cronartium species in the genus alternate between the aecial host Pinus spp. and telial hosts of different dicotyledonous plants in the Fagaceae, Grossulariaceae, Myricaceae, Santalaceae and Scrophulariaceae families (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005).\n\nThe biology of North American, heteroecious Cronartium spp. is broadly similar (EPPO, 1997a). Spermagonia and aecia are produced in the spring and early summer, one to several years after infection of the aecial hosts, i.e. Pinus spp. (EPPO, 1997a). Aeciospores are windborne and may be carried over long distances to infect the leaves of the telial hosts (EPPO, 1997a).\n\nAbout 2 weeks after infection of the telial hosts, uredinia develop on the surface on the underside of the leaves and on stems of some herbaceous hosts (EPPO, 1997a; Sinclair and Lyon, 2005). Uredinia are continuously produced throughout the summer and urediniospores produced therein reinfect the telial hosts (EPPO, 1997a). Urediniospores are windborne and may be carried over long distances.\n\nTelia are produced in late summer and the teliospores germinate in place to produce basidiospores (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005). Basidiospores are sensitive to drying and solar radiation and mostly released during night time (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005). Dispersal is usually limited to an area within 1.5 km of the telial host (EPPO, 1997a; see Zambino (2010) for a review of dispersal distances for C. ribicola).\n\nThe windborne basidiospores infect the first‐year needles or young cones of the aecial hosts during summer and autumn (EPPO, 1997a; Sinclair and Lyon, 2005). The duration between infection of the aecial hosts and the formation of spermagonia ranges from several weeks to more than two years depending on the Cronartium species (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005). Cross‐fertilisation of the spermagonia occurs through hyphal anastomoses or by insects (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005). Spermagonia on the conifer hosts are mainly produced on branches and stems in association with cankers or swellings (or on cones). After several weeks (up to one year), aecia are produced where spermagonia previously appeared producing yellow to orange (rarely white) aeciospores (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005). The aeciospores have thick walls, tolerate dry air and can disperse over long distances (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005).\n\nThe rust may overwinter in bark and galls of Pinus spp. (EPPO, 1997a). Most of the Cronartium spp. are perennial in pine tissue after infection and grow into the outer rings of sapwood (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005). Limb rusts can also grow into the deeper layers of the sapwood (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005).\n\nFor both C. coleosporioides and C. comandrae, most infections (on Pinus contorta) were found to occur within 2 m from the ground (Van der Kamp, 1994).\n\nThe species are often grouped according to the symptoms they cause. Gall rusts are stem rusts causing gall formation, but usually no cankers, blister rusts are stem rusts that cause cankers and limb rusts are rusts causing infections leading to dieback of branches but no cankers (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005).\n\nSome Cronartium species are autoecious, as they do not need alternate hosts to complete their life cycle.\n\nThere is very limited information on the biology of most of the species reported from tropical or subtropical countries.\n\n3.1.3. Intraspecific diversity\n\nFor most of the non‐EU Cronartium species, there is little information on their intraspecific diversity. Within C. quercuum, several host specific formae speciales have been described (Burdsall and Snow, 1977; EPPO, 1997f; Nakamura et al., 1998). In the US, four genetically distinct regional groups of C. quercuum were distinguished in the south Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains (Kubisiak et al., 2004). In China, the genetic diversity of C. quercuum was found to be higher in genotypes from P. sylvestris var. mongolica than on other pine hosts (Cheng et al., 1998).\n\n3.1.4. Detection and identification of the pest\n\nAre detection and identification methods available for the pest?\n\nYes, detection and identification methods are available for several (but not all) non‐EU Cronartium species.\n\nMorphological features of the sporulating structures can be used to differentiate between most of the different Cronartium species. However, some species are very similar and inoculation of the telial host may be needed to differentiate species, e.g. C. coleosporioides and C. comptoniae (EPPO, 1997a,c).\n\nMorphological descriptions in Data Sheets on Quarantine Pests are available for C. coleosporioides, C. comandrae, C. comptoniae, C. himalayense, C. kamtschaticum, C. fusiforme (no longer accepted as a valid name, i.e. regarded as synonym of C. quercuum) and C. quercuum (EPPO, 1997a, b, c, d, e–f).\n\nIsozyme and protein pattern analysis of aeciospores can differentiate between C. appalachianum, C. comandrae, C. harknessii, C. ribicola, and several formae speciales of C. quercuum (Powers et al., 1989).\n\n3.2. Pest distribution\n\n3.2.1. Pest distribution outside the EU\n\nCronartium species are reported from many different countries across the globe (Table ). The Cronartium spp. with a documented association with hosts of the genus Pinus spp. appear to be mostly limited to the northern hemisphere.\n\nDetailed maps are only available for some of the species, e.g. C. coleosporioides, C. comandrae, C. comptonidae, C. fusiforme (see comment in Section 3.1.4), C. himalayense, C. kamtschaticum, and C. quercuum (EPPO, 2018). A distribution map for non‐EU Cronartium spp. based on Table is presented in Figure .\n\n3.2.2. Pest distribution in the EU\n\nIs the pest present in the EU territory? If present, is the pest widely distributed within the EU?\n\nNo, the non‐EU Cronartium spp. are not reported to be present in the EU.\n\nThere are only few reports of absence of non‐EU Cronartium species from EU MS that have been confirmed by surveys. C. coleosporioides, C. comandrae, C. comptoniae, C. himalayense, C. kamtschatichum and C. quercuum are reported as absent in the Netherlands (confirmed by survey) (EPPO, 2018). These species are also listed as absent in the UK Plant Health Risk Register (https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/phiw/riskRegister/).\n\n3.3. Regulatory status\n\n3.3.1. Council Directive 2000/29/EC\n\nCronartium spp. (non‐EU) are listed in Council Directive 2000/29/EC as Cronartium spp. (non‐European) (see Section 1.1.2). Details are presented in Tables and .\n\nTable 3\n\nAnnex I, Part A Harmful organisms whose introduction into, and spread within, all member states shall be banned Section I Harmful organisms not known to occur in any part of the Community and relevant for the entire Community (c) Fungi Species 3.

C. orientale and C. quercuum also infect Castanea spp. and Castanopsis spp. (EPPO, 2018).\n\nSeveral herbaceous plants are also telial hosts (Table ). Many new alternate hosts of C. ribicola (which is not part of this pest categorisation, see Section 1.2) have been recently reported (e.g. Kaitera et al., 2017, 2018), suggesting that there could be several unknown alternate hosts of non‐EU Cronartium spp. too. Uncertainty in the host range of non‐EU Cronartium spp. is added by the observation of interspecific hybridisation between C. ribicola and C. comandrae in Canada (Joly et al., 2006). Hybridisation between different Cronartium spp. could lead to pathogens with unexpected host ranges (Olson and Stenlid, 2002; Ghelardini et al., 2016; Stukenbrock, 2016).\n\nSome of the Cronartium spp., especially those reported from more tropical or subtropical regions, have only been reported on angiosperm plant species (Table ).\n\nIn Council Directive 2000/29/EC, Cronartium spp. (non‐EU) are not regulated on a particular host or commodity; their introduction into the EU is banned (Annex IAI).\n\n3.4.2. Entry\n\nIs the pest able to enter into the EU territory? If yes, identify and list the pathways!\n\nYes, Cronartium spp. could enter the EU via host plants for planting and cut flowers and branches.\n\nHost commodities on which the pathogens could enter the EU are (EPPO, 1997a, b, c, d e–f, 2018):\n\nPlants for planting of Pinus, Quercus, Castanea, Castanopsis spp. and other hosts.\n\nCut flowers and branches of Pinus, Quercus, Castanea, Castanopsis spp. and other hosts, when leaves are present.\n\nNon‐squared wood of Pinus spp.\n\nNon‐squared wood is listed as a pathway of entry of various non‐EU Cronartium spp. in EPPO (2018). However, since these fungi are biotrophs and require live host tissue, they would presumably not survive long in wood after harvest. Nevertheless, some Cronartium spp. are reported to be able to overwinter in bark of Pinus spp. (EPPO, 1997a). Moreover, even though these are biotrophic fungi, their aecia may be able to survive for some time in wood.\n\nThat the pathogens may be transported with plants for planting has been observed for C. comandrae on nursery trees within the USA (EPPO, 1997b). Cronartium spp. are reported to have long incubation periods and latent infections may thus go undetected (EPPO, 1997f).\n\nThe pathways plants for planting and cut branches of Pinus spp. are regulated with a ban on importing plants of Pinus spp., other than fruit and seeds, from non‐European countries (see Section 3.3.2).\n\nOn the telial woody hosts Quercus spp., Castanea spp. and Castanopsis spp., only the leaves are infected (EPPO, 1997f). There is an import ban from non‐European countries of plants of Castanea and Quercus (but not Castanopsis), other than fruit and seeds (see Section 3.3.2).\n\nThere is no reported risk associated with movement of seeds or pollen (EPPO, 1997a). It is unclear whether cone infecting species could be associated with seeds and thus be a pathway of entry. There is also uncertainty about whether cut flowers could be a pathway of entry.\n\nAs of September 2018, there was one record of interception of Cronartium spp. in the Europhyt database. In year 2000, the UK reported the interception of a Cronartium species (non‐EU) on Mahonia spp.\n\n3.4.3. Establishment\n\nIs the pest able to become established in the EU territory?\n\nYes, non‐EU Cronartium species could establish in the EU, as hosts are present and favourable climatic conditions are common.\n\n3.4.3.1. EU distribution of main host plants\n\nCronartium spp. can infect a wide range of Pinus spp. (Section 3.4.1). All the European species (P. cembra, P. halepensis, P. mugo, P. nigra, P. pinaster, P. pinea and P. sylvestris) and other commonly planted non‐native species (e.g. P. contorta and P. ponderosa) are reported to be hosts of at least one of the Cronartium species.\n\nPinus species are widely distributed across the EU (EFSA PLH Panel, 2018a) (Figure ) and aecial hosts are therefore available. For the heteroecious species the potential establishment depends on the presence of not just the aecial, but also of the telial hosts (see Table ).\n\nDifferent Quercus spp. and Castanea sativa are found distributed across much of Europe. There is however an uncertainty regarding the susceptibility of the European Quercus and Castanea spp. Telial hosts of C. quercuum in North America and Asia are mainly native to their respective continent (EPPO, 1997f).\n\nThe known telial hosts of C. comandrae (Comandra livida, C. umbellata, C. richardsiana and Geocaulon lividum) are not present in Europe (EPPO, 1997b). Only one related species, Comandra elegans, is present but uncommon and limited to the Balkan peninsula (EPPO, 1997b).\n\nOf the known telial hosts of C. comptoniae, Myrica gale is widespread on poor soils in north western Europe (EPPO, 1997c).\n\nSeveral of the known telial host genera of C. coleosporioides are present in Europe, i.e. Melampyrum, Pedicularis and Rhinanthus (EPPO, 1997a). But none of the host species infected in North America is reported to occur in Europe (EPPO, 1997a).\n\nKnown telial host genera of C. kamtschaticum present in Europe are Pedicularis, which occurs widely in the Palaearctic region, and Ribes (EPPO, 1997e).\n\nC. himalayense and C. opheliae have telial hosts within the genus Swertia. The genus is represented by S. perennis in Europe, which occurs mainly in the mountains of central Europe (EPPO, 1997d).\n\nDifferent Castilleja species are telial hosts of some of the Cronartium spp. According to the Plants of the World Online database, this genus is only found in Arctic/Asian Russia and the Americas (http://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:325881-2).\n\nFor some Cronartium species reported on angiosperm hosts (Table ), the lack of hosts in the EU could be a factor limiting establishment.\n\n3.4.3.2. Climatic conditions affecting establishment\n\nSeveral non‐EU Cronartium spp. with Pinus and Quercus spp. as reported hosts (Table ) occur in areas with climatic conditions similar to those found in large parts of the EU (see Section 3.2.1). Climate is thus not expected to be a limiting factor for the establishment of such non‐EU Cronartium species.\n\nFor the non‐EU Cronartium spp. occurring in (sub)tropical areas, climate may be a limiting factor for establishment, unless those Cronartium spp. occur in their native range in mountainous areas with a more temperate climate.\n\n3.4.4. Spread\n\nIs the pest able to spread within the EU territory following establishment? How?\n\nYes, by natural dispersal and movement of infected host plants for planting and cut flowers and branches.\n\nRNQPs: Is spread mainly via specific plants for planting, rather than via natural spread or via movement of plant products or other objects?\n\nNo, plants for planting are not the main pathway of spread, as wind‐blown spores can travel over long distances.\n\nCronartium spp. have windborne aeciospores that can travel long distances (Chang and Blenis, 1989; EPPO, 1997a). The aeciospores tolerate dry air (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005). Urediniospores from the telial hosts may also be able to spread over long distances.\n\nThere is research available on the spread of C. ribicola (which is not part of this pest categorisation, see Section 1.2) (e.g. Hatala et al., 2011; Leung and Kot, 2015; Evans, 2016), but also e.g. on the factors affecting the spread of C. comptoniae in Minnesota, US (Smeltzer and French, 1981) and on the connectivity of the landscape in southern Mississippi with regard to C. quercuum (this connectivity has been shown to have increased over time; Perkins and Matlack, 2002). Late spring frosts and dry weather were found to limit the dispersal of aeciospores of C. quercuum in Wisconsin, US (Nighswander and Patton, 1965).\n\nThese pathogens may also be transported across large distances on plants for planting (EPPO, 1997f). By analogy with entry (see Section 3.4.2), cut flowers and branches could be a means of spread of these pathogens.\n\n3.5. Impacts\n\nWould the pests’ introduction have an economic or environmental impact on the EU territory?\n\nYes, the pest introduction could have an impact on pine, oak and chestnut forests, plantations, ornamental trees and nurseries.\n\nRNQPs: Does the presence of the pest on plants for planting have an economic impact, as regards the intended use of those plants for planting? 4\n\nYes, the pest introduction could have an impact on the intended use of plants for planting.\n\nThe North American Cronartium spp. cause very important tree diseases (EPPO, 1997a, b, c, d e–f; Vogler and Bruns, 1998). Symptoms on Pinus spp. differ between Cronartium spp., but include galls, cankers, dieback of branches and stems, deformity, tree and cone death (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005) (Figure ). The impact of the rusts may depend on the abundance of the telial hosts, as shown for C. comptoniae (Gross et al., 1983).\n\nSymptoms on the telial hosts include yellow leafs spots, yellow to necrotic leaf blotches and premature defoliation (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005).\n\nThere is limited information on the impact of various non‐EU Cronartium spp. However, in general, should non‐EU Cronartium species be introduced to the EU, impacts can be expected in pine, oak and chestnut forests, plantations, ornamental trees and nurseries. For example, it has been assessed that the introduction of C. comptoniae into Britain might have very serious consequences on P. contorta plantations (Pawsey, 1974).\n\n3.6. Availability and limits of mitigation measures\n\nAre there measures available to prevent the entry into, establishment within or spread of the pest within the EU such that the risk becomes mitigated?\n\nYes, see Sections 3.3 and 3.6.1.\n\nRNQPs: Are there measures available to prevent pest presence on plants for planting such that the risk becomes mitigated?\n\nNo, given that symptoms become visible only many years after infection and given the long‐distance spore dispersal potential, preventing pest presence on plants for planting is difficult.\n\n3.6.1. Identification of additional measures\n\nPhytosanitary measures are currently applied to some of the host species of non‐EU Cronartium spp. (see Section 3.3.2). Given that symptoms do not become visible for many years after infection, EPPO (1997a, b, c, d e–f) concluded that the only practical way to avoid introduction of non‐EU Cronartium spp. is to ban the import of host plants (especially Pinus and Quercus spp.) from countries where these pathogens are present.\n\n3.6.1.1. Additional control measures\n\nPotential additional control measures are listed in Table .\n\nTable 6\n\nInformation sheet title (with hyperlink to information sheet if available)Control measure summaryRisk component (entry/establishment/spread/impact) http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1175887 Plant nurseries should be located far away from infected forests stands (EPPO, 1997a)Entry/SpreadUse of resistant and tolerant plant species/varietiesThe use of resistant cultivars can reduce impacts, as shown for C. quercuum in forest nurseries (EPPO, 1997f)Impact http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1181436 Because girdling cankers develop slowly and infrequently in the Rocky Mountains, potential losses from C. comandrae were found to be reduced by timely removal of damaged P. contorta trees (Geils and Jacobi, 1990)Impact http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1181717l Plant nurseries should be located far away from telial hostsImpact\n\n3.6.1.2. Biological or technical factors limiting the feasibility of measures to prevent the entry, establishment and spread of the pest\n\nLatent infections may go undetected (EPPO, 1997a).\n\nGiven the long‐distance dispersal potential of the aeciospores and urediniospores, it would be very difficult to contain them (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005; Kobziar et al., 2018).\n\n3.6.1.3. Biological or technical factors limiting the ability to prevent the presence of the pest on plants for planting\n\nWind‐borne aeciospores and urediniospores can be carried over long distances (EPPO, 1997a; Sinclair and Lyon, 2005).\n\n3.7. Uncertainty\n\nThe taxonomic resolution at the species level within the genus is uncertain.\n\nThe geographic distribution and host range (for both telial and aecial hosts) of many of the species in the genus is unclear, especially for the species reported from tropical and sub‐tropical areas.\n\nIt is unclear whether seeds and cut flowers could be a pathway of entry.\n\nThe susceptibility of European host species is uncertain, both with regard to the aecial hosts species in combination with the different Cronartium spp. and with regard to European species representing known telial host genera.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nCronartium species (non‐EU) meet the criteria assessed by EFSA for consideration as potential quarantine pests (Table ).\n\nTable 7\n\nCriterion of pest categorisationPanel's

Council Directive 2000/29/EC (Annex IAI) as harmful organisms whose introduction into, and spread within, all Member States shall be bannedNone Pest potential for entry, establishment and spread in the EU territory (Section 3.4 )\n\nEntry: the pest could enter the EU via host plants for planting and cut flowers and branches.\n\nEstablishment: for several species, hosts are common and climatic conditions are favourable in the risk assessment area\n\nSpread: the pest could spread following establishment by movement of host plants for planting and cut flowers and branches, as well as natural spread\n\nPlants for planting are not the main pathway of spread, given the potential contribution of cut branches and natural spreadIt is unclear whether seeds and cut flowers could be a pathway of entry Potential for consequences in the EU territory (Section 3.5 ) The introduction of Cronartium spp. (non‐EU) would have economic and environmental impacts in pine forests, plantations, ornamental trees and nurseriesThe introduction of the pest could have an impact on the intended use of plants for plantingThe susceptibility of European host species is often uncertain Available measures (Section 3.6 ) Import prohibition of host plants and selecting resistant trees as seed source are available measuresGiven the long‐distance dispersal potential of the aeciospores, production of plants for planting in pest free areas would be difficult to achieveNone Conclusion on pest categorisation (Section 4 ) The criteria assessed by the Panel for consideration of Cronartium spp. (non‐EU) as potential quarantine pests are metThe criterion on the pest presence in the EU is not met Aspects of assessment to focus on/scenarios to address in future if appropriate The main knowledge gap is the

In forestry, such a probability for a single taxon is called ‘relative’. The maps of RPP are produced by means of the constrained spatial multi‐scale frequency analysis (C‐SMFA) (de Rigo et al., 2014, 2017) of species presence data reported in geolocated plots by different forest inventories.\n\nA.1. Geolocated plot databases\n\nThe RPP models rely on five geodatabases that provide presence/absence data for tree species and genera: four European‐wide forest monitoring data sets and a harmonised collection of records from national forest inventories (de Rigo et al., 2014, 2016, 2017). The databases report observations made inside geolocalised sample plots positioned in a forested area, but do not provide information about the plot size or consistent quantitative information about the recorded species beyond presence/absence.\n\nThe harmonisation of these data sets was performed within the research project at the origin of the European Atlas of Forest Tree Species (de Rigo et al., 2016; San‐Miguel‐Ayanz, 2016; San‐Miguel‐Ayanz et al., 2016). Given the heterogeneity of strategies of field sampling design and establishment of sampling plots in the various national forest inventories (Chirici et al., 2011a,b), and also given legal constraints, the information from the original data sources was harmonised to refer to an INSPIRE compliant geospatial grid, with a spatial resolution of 1 km2 pixel size, using the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal‐Area as geospatial projection (EPSG: 3035, http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/etrs89-etrs-laea/).\n\nA.1.1. European National Forestry Inventories database\n\nThis data set was derived from National Forest Inventory data and provides information on the presence/absence of forest tree species in approximately 375,000 sample points with a spatial resolution of 1 km2/pixel, covering 21 European countries (de Rigo et al., 2014, 2016).\n\nA.1.2. Forest Focus/Monitoring data set\n\nThis project is a Community scheme for harmonised long‐term monitoring of air pollution effects in European forest ecosystems, normed by EC Regulation No. 2152/20035. Under this scheme, the monitoring is carried out by participating countries on the basis of a systematic network of observation points (Level I) and a network of observation plots for intensive and continuous monitoring (Level II). For managing the data, the JRC implemented a Forest Focus Monitoring Database System, from which the data used in this project were taken (Hiederer et al., 2007; Houston Durrant and Hiederer, 2009). The complete Forest Focus data set covers 30 European Countries with more than 8,600 sample points.\n\nA.1.3. BioSoil data set\n\nThis data set was produced by one of a number of demonstration studies performed in response to the ‘Forest Focus’ Regulation (EC) No 2152/2003 mentioned above. The aim of the BioSoil project was to provide harmonised soil and forest biodiversity data. It comprised two modules: a Soil Module (Hiederer et al., 2011) and a Biodiversity Module (Houston Durrant et al., 2011). The data set used in the C‐SMFA RPP model came from the Biodiversity module, in which plant species from both the tree layer and the ground vegetation layer were recorded for more than 3,300 sample points in 19 European Countries.\n\nA.1.4. European Information System on Forest Genetic Resources (EUFGIS)\n\nEUFGIS (http://portal.eufgis.org) is a smaller geodatabase providing information on tree species composition in over 3,200 forest plots in 34 European countries. The plots are part of a network of forest stands managed for the genetic conservation of one or more target tree species. Hence, the plots represent the natural environment to which the target tree species are adapted.\n\nA.1.5. Georeferenced Data on Genetic Diversity (GD2)\n\nGD2 (http://gd2.pierroton.inra.fr) provides information about 63 species of interest for genetic conservation. The database covers 6,254 forest plots located in stands of natural populations that are traditionally analysed in genetic surveys. While this database covers fewer species than the others, it covers 66 countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, making it the data set with the largest geographic extent.\n\nA.2. Modelling methodology\n\nFor modelling, the data were harmonised in order to have the same spatial resolution (1 km2) and filtered to a study area comprising 36 countries in the European continent. The density of field observations varies greatly throughout the study area and large areas are poorly covered by the plot databases. A low density of field plots is particularly problematic in heterogeneous landscapes, such as mountainous regions and areas with many different land use and cover types, where a plot in one location is not representative of many nearby locations (de Rigo et al., 2014). To account for the spatial variation in plot density, the model used here (C‐SMFA) considers multiple spatial scales when estimating RPP. Furthermore, statistical resampling is systematically applied to mitigate the cumulated data‐driven uncertainty.\n\nThe presence or absence of a given forest tree species then refers to an idealised standard field sample of negligible size compared with the 1 km2 pixel size of the harmonised grid. The modelling methodology considered these presence/absence measures as if they were random samples of a binary quantity (the punctual presence/absence, not the pixel one). This binary quantity is a random variable having its own probability distribution which is a function of the unknown average probability of finding the given tree species within a plot of negligible area belonging to the considered 1 km2 pixel (de Rigo et al., 2014). This unknown statistic is denoted hereinafter with the name of ‘probability of presence’.\n\nC‐SMFA performs spatial frequency analysis of the geolocated plot data to create preliminary RPP maps (de Rigo et al., 2014). For each 1 km2 grid cell, the model estimates kernel densities over a range of kernel sizes to estimate the probability that a given species is present in that cell. The entire array of multi‐scale spatial kernels is aggregated with adaptive weights based on the local pattern of data density. Thus, in areas where plot data are scarce or inconsistent, the method tends to put weight on larger kernels. Wherever denser local data are available, they are privileged ensuring a more detailed local RPP estimation. Therefore, a smooth multi‐scale aggregation of the entire arrays of kernels and data sets is applied instead of selecting a local ‘best performing’ one and discarding the remaining information. This array‐based processing, and the entire data harmonisation procedure, are made possible thanks to the semantic modularisation which defines the Semantic Array Programming modelling paradigm (de Rigo, 2012).\n\nThe probability to find a single species (e.g. a particular coniferous tree species) in a 1 km2 grid cell cannot be higher than the probability of presence of all the coniferous species combined. The same logical constraints applied to the case of single broadleaved species with respect to the probability of presence of all the broadleaved species combined. Thus, to improve the accuracy of the maps, the preliminary RPP values were constrained so as not to exceed the local forest‐type cover fraction with an iterative refinement (de Rigo et al., 2014). The forest‐type cover fraction was estimated from the classes of the Corine Land Cover (CLC) maps which contain a component of forest trees (Bossard et al., 2000; Büttner et al., 2012).\n\nThe resulting probability of presence is relative to the specific tree taxon, irrespective of the potential co‐occurrence of other tree taxa with the measured plots, and should not be confused with the absolute abundance or proportion of each taxon in the plots. RPP represents the probability of finding at least one individual of the taxon in a plot placed randomly within the grid cell, assuming that the plot has negligible area compared with the cell. As a consequence, the sum of the RPP associated with different taxa in the same area is not constrained to be 100%. For example, in a forest with two codominant tree species which are homogeneously mixed, the RPP of both may be 100% (see e.g. the Glossary in San‐Miguel‐Ayanz et al. (2016), http://forest.jrc.ec.europa.eu/media/atlas/Glossary.pdf).\n\nThe robustness of RPP maps depends strongly on sample plot density, as areas with few field observations are mapped with greater uncertainty. This uncertainty is shown qualitatively in maps of ‘RPP trustability’. RPP trustability is computed on the basis of the aggregated equivalent number of sample plots in each grid cell (equivalent local density of plot data). The trustability map scale is relative, ranging from 0 to 1, as it is based on the quantiles of the local plot density map obtained using all field observations for the species. Thus, trustability maps may vary among species based on the number of databases that report a particular species (de Rigo et al., 2014, 2016).\n\nThe RPP and relative trustability range from 0 to 1 and are mapped at a 1 km spatial resolution. To improve visualisation, these maps can be aggregated to coarser scales (i.e. 10 × 10 pixels or 25 × 25 pixels, respectively, summarising the information for aggregated spatial cells of 100 km2 and 625 km2) by averaging the values in larger grid cells.\n\nNotes\n\nSuggested citation: EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH) , Bragard C, Di Serio F, Gonthier P, Jacques M‐A, Jaques Miret JA, Justesen AF, MacLeod A, Magnusson CS, Milonas P, Navas‐Cortes JA, Parnell S, Potting R, Reignault PL, Thulke H‐H, Van der Werf W, Vicent A, Yuen J, Zappalà L, Boberg J, Jeger M, Pautasso M and Dehnen‐Schmutz K, 2018.
