        "text": "We’ve made it to 100! Episodes that is … on our The Learning Future Podcast. I’ll admit … it snuck up on us … we’ve been busy out there talking with passionate humans about learning in their schools and systems. See all the conversations and subscribe! https://lnkd.in/ghZc2s9 From the beginnings in 2020 talking about the ‘Emotion Revolution’ with Professor Marc Brackett through to one of my latest chats with Tom Vander Ark about how learning innovators can imagine and prepare for the potential implications of OpenAI's ChatGPT … we’ve dug into so many nooks and crannies of the future of learning. And so, as we share our 100th podcast today with the incredible Romana Shaikh (she/her) partnership with Salzburg Global Seminar, I’d love you to join us in celebrating this milestone. Thank you to everyone single guest who willingly shared their time, energy, and expertise across the globe to talk about reimagining learning and meeting the true promise of education. I’d love to know if you had a favourite, share thoughts below with me. I’m going to take some time over the coming weeks to also look back and share some of the chats that truly challenged my way of thinking – so get ready for a stroll down learning lane with me. I’m always on the lookout for new people to interview so let us know. And as a perpetual learning what the new concepts might be we can explore and communicate. As always, reach out to the team at hello@thelearningfuture.com at any time. Thanks to William Parry, Gareth Allely, Renee Kirkman, Anne Knock PhD, Kwaku Aning, Dominic Regester, Benjamin Freud, Ph.D., FRSA for all your support making this happen. Here's to the next hundred episodes and to a world of thriving learners. #education #team #thankyou #people #learning #share #future #schools #interview #podcast #learningfuture #education"
