        "meta_description": "Knowledge of pathogen biology and genetic diversity is a cornerstone of effective disease management, and accurate identification of the pathogen is a foundation of pathogen biology. Species names provide an ideal framework for storage and retrieval of relevant information, a system that is contingent on a clear understanding of species boundaries and consistent species identification. Verticillium, a genus of ascomycete fungi, contains important plant pathogens whose species boundaries have been ill defined. Using phylogenetic analyses, morphological investigations and comparisons to herbarium material and the literature, we established a taxonomic framework for Verticillium comprising ten species, five of which are new to science. We used a collection of 74 isolates representing much of the diversity of Verticillium, and phylogenetic analyses based on the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), partial sequences of the protein coding genes actin (ACT), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) and tryptophan synthase (TS). Combined analyses of the ACT, EF, GPD and TS datasets recognized two major groups within Verticillium, Clade Flavexudans and Clade Flavnonexudans, reflecting the respective production and absence of yellow hyphal pigments. Clade Flavexudans comprised V. albo-atrum and V. tricorpus as well as the new species V. zaregamsianum, V. isaacii and V. klebahnii, of which the latter two were morphologically indistinguishable from V. tricorpus but may differ in pathogenicity. Clade Flavnonexudans comprised V. nubilum, V. dahliae and V. longisporum, as well as the two new species V. alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae, which resembled the distantly related V. albo-atrum in morphology. Apart from the diploid hybrid V. longisporum, each of the ten species corresponded to a single clade in the phylogenetic tree comprising just one ex-type strain, thereby establishing a direct link to a name tied to a herbarium specimen. A morphology-based key is provided for identification to species or species groups.",

Aerial mycelium generally abundant, floccose to pruinose, hyphae smooth-walled, (1–) 1.5–4 µm wide. Conidiophores erect or slanted, generally determinate (Figure 4c), branched or unbranched (Figure 4d), formed disjointedly throughout the colonies, hyaline, base brown-pigmented at times, 80–480 µm in length, 3–6 µm wide, narrowing towards the apex to 2–2.5 µm, transversely septate, septa spaced more narrowly towards the apex. Conidiogenous cells are phialides, arranged in 1–4 (–6) whorls along conidiophores (Figures 4c, 4d), arising below transverse septum (Figure 4e). Whorls spaced 20–140 µm apart, closer towards the apex, consisting of (1–) 2–4 (–6) phialides (Figures 4c, 4d, 4e). Apical whorls consisting of one apical and one to several lateral phialides (Figures 4c, 4d, 4e). Phialides subulate, tapering from 1.5–3 µm at the base to 1–1.5 µm at the tip, terminal phialides 40–80 µm long, lateral phialides 20–50 µm long (Figure 4e). Conidia hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical with rounded apices to oval (Figure 4f), tapering at times, (3.0–) 6.0 µm±1.5 µm (–10.5)×(2.0–) 3.0 µm±0.5 µm (–6.0) (l/w = (1.1–) 2.0±0.4 (–3.0), n = 86), accumulating at the tip of the phialides (Figures 4c, 4d). After 4 wks, a small number of conidia (generally <1%) with central septum, constricted at the septum at times (Figure 4f). Budding conidia and conidia germinating by formation of a phialide observed (Figure 4f). Resting mycelium present, consisting of brown-pigmented hyphae, up to 7 µm wide, thick-walled, straight or curved, solitary or aggregated, up to 25 µm wide (Figures 4g, 4h). Microsclerotia present, composed of tightly interwoven, torulose brown-pigmented hyphae, rounded or variously shaped, up to 230 µm diam and consisting of rounded to elongate cells, up to 10 µm diam (Figures 4i, 4j, 4k). Yellow-pigmented hyphal cells present at times, up to 5 µm wide (Figure 4l).\n\nTypes.\n\nHolotype: Missing, not found at GOET, B, M; Lectotype (designated herein): Illustrations from protolog: Figures of Plate (‘Tafel’) 8 and Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 of Plate 9 in Reinke and Berthold [21], available online at http://books.google.com/books?id=iWgVAAAAYAAJ&dq=Die%20Kr%C3%A4uselkrankheit%20der%20Kartoffel&pg=PA107#v=onepage&q=Die%20Kr%C3%A4uselkrankheit%20der%20Kartoffel&f=false (accessed on October 5, 2011); Epitype (designated herein): Dried culture of Verticillium albo-atrum strain PD747 (Canada: Prince Edward Island; potato field soil) deposited at UC (UC 1953892), an ex-epitype culture at CBS (CBS 130340) and NRRL (NRRL 54797).\n\nSpecimens examined.\n\nThe description was based on Verticillium albo-atrum strains PD670 (USA: WI; Irish potato), PD693 (UK; Irish potato), PD746 (Canada: New Brunswick; potato field soil), PD747 (Canada: Prince Edward Island; potato field soil) and PD748 (Canada: Prince Edward Island; potato field soil)(Table S1).\n\nDistribution and host range.\n\nCurrently known from Canada, Germany, UK and USA (WI). Substrates include Irish potato and soil collected from Irish potato fields.\n\nCommentary.\n\nVerticillium albo-atrum was described by Reinke and Berthold in 1879 from diseased potato plants collected near Göttingen, Germany [21]. The protolog of V. albo-atrum contains detailed descriptions and drawings, but no reference is made to type material. We inquired at the herbaria of Göttingen (GOET), Berlin (B) and München (M), none of which has any V. albo-atrum type material or any other V. albo-atrum material deposited by Reinke and Berthold. According to Klebahn [33], original cultures of V. albo-atrum are no longer available. We did not find any V. albo-atrum cultures by Reinke and Berthold in any of the major culture collections (CBS, IMI, DSMZ, ATCC). Thus, in absence of any original fungal material, we designated the illustrations from the V. albo-atrum protolog in Plate 8 (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) and Plate 9 (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) in Reinke and Berthold [21] as the lectotype for V. albo-atrum. According to The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) [34] this is permissible when the holotype, all cited or uncited original specimens and all original cultures are missing (Art. 8.4, Art. 9.2, Art. 9.10, Art. 37.4). To serve as an interpretive type, we designated a V. albo-atrum epitype with an ex-epitype culture for molecular studies. Designation of an epitype is permissible according to ICBN when serving the precise application of a name (Article 9.7).\n\nThe original description of V. albo-atrum by Reinke and Berthold [21] was based on observations from decaying potato stems, and is congruent with our observations from the V. albo-atrum isolates examined in this study. The exception was the presence of yellow pigment associated with hyphal cells (Figure 4l) not seen by Reinke and Berthold [21]. However, Klebahn [35] reported that V. albo-atrum mycelium on Salep Agar medium was white with a yellow tinge (p. 64), whereas V. dahliae mycelium was described as white (p. 65).\n\nIn addition to resting mycelium, Verticillium albo-atrum also forms microsclerotia (Figures 4i, 4j, 4k). Microsclerotia are very ‘small, firm, frequently rounded masses of hyphae with or without the addition of host tissue or soil.’ [36]. The V. albo-atrum microsclerotia were described and illustrated in the protolog on pages 74 and 75, and in Figures 1 and 2 of Plate 9 [21], a translation from the German original is provided by Isaac [22]. The microsclerotia consist of aggregations of brown-pigmented, thick-walled hyphae, no lateral cell divisions are involved in their formation [21]. This is opposed to the microsclerotia of V. dahliae where an increase in width is achieved by the lateral divisions of hyphal cells as described by Klebahn [35] on pages 56 and 57, and illustrated in Klebahn's [35] Figure 8. Microsclerotia were only observed on WA-p and PLYA media, they were absent from strains cultured on PDA. Verticillium albo-atrum has frequently been confused with V. alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae that form resting mycelium but no microsclerotia.\n\nThe name ‘V. albo-atrum’ is correct with or without hyphen (Art. 23.1), the hyphenated form is more commonly encountered in the literature.\n\nVerticillium alfalfae Inderb., H.

The V. dahliae holotype specimen was also examined (Figures 3a, 6j).\n\nDistribution and host range.\n\nCurrently known from Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden, UK, Ukraine, and USA (CA, ID, IL, OR, TX, WA, WI) [27]. Substrates include Anaheim pepper, annual sunflower, apricot, ash, bell pepper, cabbage, celandine, chili pepper, common flax, eggplant, European smoketree, garden tomato, globe artichoke, horseradish, hybrid strawberry, Icelandic poppy, Irish potato, jalapeno, Japanese maple, lettuce, maple, olive, opium poppy, paprika, pepper, peppermint, pistachio nut, purple coneflower, rape, scentless false mayweed, spinach, stock, sweet almond, udo, upland cotton, and watermelon [27] that represent fourteen different plant families (Aceraceae, Amaranthaceae, Anacardiaceae, Araliaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, Linaceae, Malvaceae, Oleaceae, Papaveraceae, Rosaceae, Solanaceae).\n\nCommentary.\n\nVerticillium dahliae is the type of Verticillium and was described by Klebahn [35] from Dahlia sp. cv. Geiselher in Germany (Figure 3a). Verticillium dahliae is not the oldest species of the genus, but it has the largest impact as a pathogen, is common and genetically relatively homogenous, and has thus been conserved as the type of the genus [16], [34]. Since a viable ex-holotype culture is no longer available [33], and DNA extraction attempts from the holotype specimen failed, we designated a V. dahliae epitype with an ex-epitype culture that serves as an interpretive type for molecular studies.\n\nThe original description of V. dahliae by Klebahn [35] was based on material from Dahlia sp., and from cultures on Salep Agar medium which is a mixture of polysaccharides contained in orchid tubers [37]. The composition of Klebahn's medium is unknown, but as a reference, Noël [38] isolated fungal symbionts of orchids using a clear, weak decoction of salep containing 2% agar. We examined the V. dahliae holotype material which contains an approximately 50 cm long stalk of Dahlia sp. ‘Sorte Geiselher’ and several leaves (Figure 3a). The microsclerotia present on the stem (Figure 6j) were similar to the microsclerotia formed in culture (Figure 6i). No conidiophores were observed, these are difficult to detect on Dahlia sp. [35], but are illustrated as part of the protolog [35].\n\nThe description of V. dahliae based on V. dahliae strains PD322, PD327 and PD502 agreed with the original description by Klebahn [35] except that we failed to detect strands of erect, hyphal aggregates containing conidia and microsclerotia. Klebahn [35] reported the presence of a slightly wider cell (foot cell) at the base of conidiophores. Since foot cells were absent in culture and we did not inoculate live plants, we were unable to confirm the presence of foot cells in V. dahliae. The dimensions provided by Klebahn [35] for microsclerotia, conidiophores, conidiogenous cells and conidia were at the lower end of the range of dimensions that we observed. Our dimensions were similar to reports in the literature for conidia [22] and microsclerotia [22], [39], [40], [41]. Short brown-pigmented hyphae attached to microsclerotia were illustrated by Klebahn [35], the ones that we observed resemble immature microsclerotia as illustrated by Klebahn [35] and Isaac [22]. Verticillium dahliae resembles V. longisporum but has smaller conidia.\n\nVerticillium isaacii Inderb., R. M. Bostock, R. M. Davis & K. V. Subbarao, sp. nov. Figure 7\n\n7a.

We documented colony morphology (Figures 9a, 9b), conidia (Figure 9c) and microsclerotia (Figures 9d, 9e, 9f, 9g). We measured microsclerotia and conidia, and assessed the number of phialides per whorl. Microsclerotia were rounded to elongate, 37–240×25–52 µm (Figures 9d, 9e). Conidia were (5.5–) 8.5 µm±2.5 µm (–15.0)×(2.0–) 3.5 µm±1.0 µm (–6.5) (l/w = (1.6–) 2.5±0.7 (–4.5), n = 29). Whorls consisted of (1–) 2–5 (–6) phialides.\n\nTypes.\n\nHolotype: Specimen CBS H-19247 at CBS (Germany: Niedersachsen; horseradish) (Figures 3b, 9g), an ex-holotype culture at CBS (CBS 124.64) included in this study as V. longisporum strain PD687 and submitted to NRRL (NRRL 54793), Stark [42] (p. 509) submitted permanent slides of type material to the Herbarium des Staatsinstitutes für Allgemeine Botanik Hamburg, these slides are missing at HBG.\n\nSpecimens examined.\n\nVerticillium longisporum strains PD348 (USA: CA; cauliflower), PD356 (USA: IL; horseradish) and PD687 (Germany: Niedersachsen; horseradish) (Table S1), representing the three lineages of V. longisporum [27], and the holotype specimen CBS H-19247 (Germany: Niedersachsen; horseradish), a dried agar culture (Figures 3b, 9g), were examined in this study.\n\nDistribution and host range.\n\nCurrently known from France, Germany, Japan, Sweden and USA (CA, IL). Substrates include birdrape, cabbage, cauliflower, horseradish, radish, rape, sugar beet and wild radish [27].\n\nCommentary.\n\nVerticillium longisporum is a diploid hybrid that originated at least three different times from four different parental lineages in three different species, including V. dahliae, Species A1 and Species D1 (Figure 1) [27]. Verticillium dahliae is the only known parent of V. longisporum, Species A1 and Species D1 have never been collected [27]. The holotype of V. longisporum represented by ex-holotype strain PD687 belongs to V. longisporum lineage A1/D3 that is one of the three lineages of V. longisporum, and V. longisporum is thus polyphyletic [27]. There is general agreement that fungal species should be monophyletic. However, we decided that V. longisporum should remain a polyphyletic species, because it seems impractical to name each lineage of V. longisporum. We currently know of three lineages of V. longisporum that represent three independent hybridization events, but there might be many more. Little is known about fungal hybrids, but in plants, hybrids can evolve frequently over short periods in small areas [43].\n\nWe included the ex-holotype isolate V. longisporum strain PD687 in our studies, strain PD687 did not form any microsclerotia. But microsclerotia were present in the holotype that is a dried culture of strain PD687 (CBS 124.64) (Figure 3b). The microsclerotia in the holotype documented in Figure 9g were similar to the ones described by Stark [42] on page 500 for ‘Typ X’ as V. longisporum was referred to prior to its description. Thus, V. longisporum strain PD687 likely lost its ability to produce microsclerotia due to prolonged culturing.\n\nKarapapa et al. [24] compared V. longisporum to the morphologically similar V. dahliae, and found that V. longisporum microsclerotia and conidia were longer than the ones in V. dahliae, and that V. longisporum conidiophores had fewer phialides in each whorl than V. dahliae.\n\nWe evaluated those characters and found that for the isolates used in this study grown on PDA, microsclerotia and conidia size might be useful to distinguish V. longisporum from V. dahliae. In Verticillium longisporum strain PD356, the majority of microsclerotia were elongate (Figure 9d), but rounded microsclerotia were still present (Figure 9e), and in some sectors of the colony, rounded microsclerotia were in the majority (Figure 9e). In V. longisporum strain PD348, there were roughly as many elongate microsclerotia as there were rounded microsclerotia. Verticillium dahliae microsclerotia were mostly rounded, but in some areas elongate microsclerotia were prevalent. The short brown-pigmented hyphae that were frequently attached to microsclerotia (Figure 9f) are possibly immature microsclerotia as illustrated by Isaac [22]. Similar structures were seen in this study in V. dahliae (Figure 6k). The third strain of V. longisporum investigated here, the ex-holotype strain PD687 did not form any microsclerotia. Conidia of V. longisporum were on average 8.5×3.5 µm (Figure 9c) and conidia of V. dahliae 6.5×3.0 µm (Figure 6h). However, conidia lengths might also at times be misleading, as the size ranges overlap, standard errors were 2.5 and 1.5 µm, respectively. We found that both V. longisporum and V. dahliae had similar numbers of phialides in each whorl, 2–4 for V. dahliae, and 2–5 for V. longisporum, this is unlike that proposed by Karapapa et al. [24] who reported 4–5 in V. dahliae and mostly 3 in V. longisporum. In our hands, Verticillium longisporum strain PD348 very frequently had 5 phialides per whorl.\n\nThus, a combination of conidia length and microsclerotia morphology might in many cases yield correct species identifications, but the two characters will also be misleading at times.\n\nAnother differentiating character was given by Stark [42]. He found that V. longisporum culture filtrate fluoresced, whereas fluorescence was absent in V. dahliae. We did not investigate fluorescence in the two species.\n\nVerticillium nonalfalfae Inderb., H. W. Platt, R. M. Bostock, R. M. Davis & K. V. Subbarao, sp. nov. Figure 10\n\n10a.

Aerial mycelium generally abundant, floccose to pruinose, hyphae smooth-walled, 1.5–3 µm wide. Conidiophores erect or slanted (Figures 10c, 10d), generally determinate, branched or unbranched (Figure 10c, 10d), formed disjointedly throughout the colonies, hyaline, 30–710 µm in length, 4.5–6 µm wide, narrowing towards the apex to 2–3 µm, transversely septate, septa spaced more narrowly towards the apex. Conidiogenous cells are phialides (Figure 10e), arranged in (1–) 2–6 whorls along conidiophores (Figures 10d 10e). Whorls spaced 50–160 µm apart, closer towards the apex, consisting of (1–) 2–5 (–7) phialides (Figure 10e), arising below transverse septum. Apical whorls consisting of one apical and one to several lateral phialides (Figures 10d, 10e). Phialides subulate, tapering from 2–3 µm at the base to 1–1.5 µm at the tip, terminal phialides 40–60 µm long, lateral phialides 30–45 µm long (Figure 10e). Conidia hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical with rounded apices to oval (Figure 10f), allantoid at times, (4.0–) 6.0 µm±1.0 µm (–10.5)×(2.5–) 3.0 µm±0.5 µm (–3.5) (l/w = (1.3–) 2.0±0.2 (–2.7), n = 80), accumulating at the tip of the phialides (Figure 10d). Resting mycelium present (Figures 10g, 10h, 10i), consisting of brown-pigmented hyphae, up to 9 µm wide, thick-walled, straight or curved, solitary or aggregated (Figures 10g, 10h), torulose at times (Figure 10i).\n\nTypes.\n\nHolotype: Dried culture of V. nonalfalfae strain PD592 (Japan: Hokkaidou; Irish potato) deposited at UC (UC 1953898), an ex-holotype culture at CBS (CBS 130339) and NRRL (NRRL 54791).\n\nSpecimens examined.\n\nThe description was based on V. nonalfalfae strains PD592 (Japan: Hokkaidou; Irish potato), PD616 and PD626 (UK; common hop), PD744 (Cuba; potato field soil), PD745 (Canada: Manitoba; spinach), PD808, PD809 and PD811 (Slovenia; common hop) and PD810 (Slovenia: petunia) (Table S1).\n\nDistribution and host range.\n\nCurrently known from Canada, Cuba, Japan, Slovenia and UK. Substrates include common hop, Irish potato, petunia and spinach.\n\nCommentary.\n\nVerticillium nonalfalfae is morphologically indistinguishable from V. alfalfae, but the two species differ in pathogenicity. Verticillium nonalfalfae causes disease on a variety of different hosts, whereas V. alfalfae causes disease mainly on lucerne [44]. Other differences include vegetative compatibility groups [45], mating types (Figure 2), as well as the DNA characters listed in the species descriptions. Verticillium alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae were described as new species because no synonyms of the morphologically similar V. albo-atrum were available (www.indexfungorum.org, accessed on September 30, 2011).\n\nVerticillium nonalfalfae and V. alfalfae have long been recognized as two genetically distinct groups referred to as non-lucerne and lucerne pathotype, respectively [46], [47], [48].\n\nWithin Verticillium, V. nonalfalfae and V. alfalfae lack unique, diagnostic morphological characters and were frequently confused with the distantly related V. albo-atrum. The three fungi share an overall similar morphology, including the formation of resting mycelium (Figures 4g, 4h, 5f, 5g, 5h, 10g, 10h, 10i). Verticillium albo-atrum also forms microsclerotia (Figures 4i, 4j, 4k), one-septate, brown-pigmented conidia (Figure 4f), as well as phialides that originate directly from conidia (Figure 4f). However, microsclerotia were only observed on WA-p and on PLYA media, not on PDA medium, and one-septate, brown-pigmented conidia, and conidia germinating by phialide formation are relatively rare. Thus, based on our data, it is not possible to consistently differentiate V. nonalfalfae and V. alfalfae from V. albo-atrum using morphological characters. Verticillium albo-atrum may co-occur with V. nonalfalfae on some hosts, as Keyworth [49] isolated Verticillium strains forming resting mycelium, as well as Verticillium strains forming microsclerotia and resting mycelium simultaneously, from diseased potato plants in Connecticut.\n\nVerticillium nubilum Pethybr., Transactions of the British Mycological Society 6: 117 (1919) Figure 11\n\n11.

Substrates include mushroom compost, Irish potato and soil.\n\nCommentary.\n\nVerticillium nubilum was described by Pethybridge [50] from the surface of a potato tuber attacked by Phytophthora infestans. The protolog of V. nubilum contains descriptions of the V. nubilum morphology and a photograph of chlamydospores, but no reference is made to type material. We inquired at Kew (K), CABI Bioscience (IMI) and Dublin (DBN), none of which has any V. nubilum type material in its possession. Isaac [23] who studied V. nubilum in detail did not mention any herbarium material. We did not find any V. nubilum cultures by Pethybridge in any of the major culture collections (CBS, IMI, DSMZ, ATCC). Thus, in absence of any original fungal material, we designated the illustration from the V. nubilum protolog, Figure 5 on Plate 4 in Pethybridge [50], as the lectotype for V. nubilum.\n\nIsaac [23] studied V. nubilum in detail and submitted several strains to CBS, of which we selected a dried culture of strain PD742 (CBS 457.51) as epitype. Our observations of V. nubilum agreed with the accounts by Pethybridge [50] and Isaac [23]. Pethybridge [50] noted that V. nubilum conidia were larger than those of V. albo-atrum. We found that V. nubilum condia were on average 7.5×2.5 µm (Figure 11c), the largest in Verticillium, with the exception of V. longisporum conidia that were on average 8.5×3.5 µm (Figure 9c). Differing from both Pethybridge [50] and Isaac [23], small numbers of brown-pigmented hyphae not directly associated with chlamydospores were sometimes present (Figure 11i), but these were lighter colored than the resting mycelium in other species (eg Figures 4g, 4h).\n\nAll the V. nubilum isolates that we examined formed very few conidia and conidiophores, which prevented us from conclusively assessing conidiophore morphology and dimensions. However, the few conidiophores and phialides that we saw were similar to other Verticillium species, in both morphology and dimensions (Figures 11c, 11d). Verticillium nubilum can be differentiated from other Verticillium species by the near exclusive formation of chlamydospores as resting structure (Figures 11f, 11g, 11h), in combination with the relatively large conidia (Figure 11c), but can be confused with Gibellulopsis nigrescens that forms distinctly smaller chlamydospores [15], [23].\n\nVerticillium tricorpus I.

We provide illustrations of the culture morphology (Figures 12a, 12b), the conidia (Figure 12c), resting structures including resting mycelium, chlamydospores and microsclerotia (Figures 12d, 12e, 12f, 12g), and yellow-pigmented hyphae (Figure 12h).\n\nTypes.\n\nHolotype: Missing, not found at K, IMI, CBS, an ex-holotype culture (UK; garden tomato) available (IMI 51602, CBS 447.54), culture CBS 447.54 included in this study as V. tricorpus strain PD690 and submitted to NRRL (NRRL 54794); Lectotype (designated herein): Specimen K(M) 172015, originally IMI 51602 (England: Fareham, South Hampshire; wilted garden tomato), marked ‘isotype ?’ (Figures 3c, 12g).\n\nSpecimens examined.\n\nVerticillium tricorpus strains PD593 (Japan; Irish potato), PD594 (Japan: Chiba; garden tomato), PD685 (Japan; larkspur), PD690 (UK; garden tomato), and PD703 (Netherlands; carnation) (Table S1), as well as V. tricorpus lectotype specimen IMI 51602 (UK; garden tomato) were included in this study (Figures 3c, 12g).\n\nDistribution and host range.\n\nCurrently known from Japan, Netherlands and UK. Substrates include carnation, garden tomato, Irish potato and larkspur.\n\nCommentary.\n\nIsaac [23] (p. 194) deposited V. tricorpus type material at IMI, K and CBS. We were only able to locate specimen IMI 51602, a dried V. tricorpus culture on PDA medium labeled ‘isotype ?’ (Figure 3c). Specimen IMI 51602 is likely derived from ex-type strain IMI 51602 deposited at CBS by I. Isaac as strain CBS 447.54. Thus, since the holotype appeared to be missing, we designated specimen IMI 51602, a likely isotype, as the lectotype of V. tricorpus (Art. 9.2, Art. 9.9, Art. 9.10). Specimen IMI 51602 did not display typical V. tricorpus morphology. Whereas verticillate conidiophores and microsclerotia were present (Figure 12g) in agreement with the description provided by Isaac [23], yellow-pigmented hyphae, chlamydospores and resting mycelium were absent. However, according to the ICBN, lectotypes have to be chosen from among isotypes if they exist (Art. 9.10). Verticillium tricorpus specimen IMI 51602 is a likely isotype and was thus designated as lectotype. Upon initial culturing, Verticillium tricorpus colonies on agar medium are yellow to orange (Figures 12a, 12b) due to the presence of yellow-pigmented hyphae (Figure 12h). Resting mycelium, chlamydospores and microsclerotia are also formed simultaneously (Figures 12d, 12e, 12f, 12g). The yellow to orange coloration is typically less intense after prolonged culturing, or if obscured by resting structures. Verticillium tricorpus is morphologically indistinguishable from V. isaacii and V. klebahnii. All three species are characterized by the formation of resting mycelium (Figures 7f, 8e, 12d), chlamydospores (Figures 7g, 8f, 12e) and microsclerotia (Figures 7h, 8h, 12f, 12g), as well as yellow-pigmented hyphae (Figure 7i, 8h, 12h) that confer agar cultures yellow to orange coloration (Figure 7b, 8b, 12b).\n\nThere is evidence for differences in pathogenicity. Whereas V. isaacii strains PD343, PD610–PD613 were not pathogenic on lettuce or artichoke [41], V. klebahnii strain PD401 was pathogenic on lettuce [51]. Verticillium tricorpus is only pathogenic on tomato [23].\n\nVerticillium zaregamsianum Inderb., T. Usami, Takeshi Kanto, R. M. Bostock, R. M. Davis & K. V. Subbarao, sp. nov. Figure 13\n\n13a.

Conidiogenous cells are phialides (Figure 13d), arranged in (1–) 3–7 (–11) whorls along conidiophores (Figures 13c, 13d). Whorls spaced 25–100 µm apart, closer towards the apex, consisting of (1–) 2–5 (–6) phialides, arising below transverse septum. Apical whorls consisting of one apical and one to several lateral phialides (Figures 13c, 13d). Phialides subulate, tapering from 2–3 µm at the base to 1–1.5 µm at the tip, terminal phialides 25–60 µm long, lateral phialides 20–60 µm long (Figure 13d). Conidia hyaline, smooth-walled (Figure 13e), cylindrical with rounded apices to ellipsoidal, (4.0–) 5.5 µm±1.0 µm (–12.5)×(2.0–) 3.0 µm±0.5 µm (–6.5) (l/w = (1.4–) 2.0±0.3 (–2.8), n = 88), accumulating at the tip of the phialides (Figure 13c), one-septate, constricted at septum, and brown-pigmented at times with age (Figure 13e). Microsclerotia regularly or irregularly distributed throughout the colony, rounded to variously shaped, up to 90 µm diam and consisting of rounded cells, up to 14 µm diam (Figures 13f, 13g, 13h, 13i). Structures resembling chlamydospores, possibly microsclerotia initials, present at times, up to 10 µm wide (Figures 13f, 13g). Scattered brown-pigmented hyphae present at times, thick-walled, up to 5 µm wide (Figure 13j).

Substrates include lettuce and tenweeks stock.\n\nCommentary.\n\nVerticillium zaregamsianum differs from all other Verticillium species by the formation of microsclerotia (Figures 13h, 13i) simultaneously with yellow-pigmented hyphae (Figures 13k, 13l). Only a few potential chlamydospores, possibly immature microsclerotia (Figure 13f, 13g), and sparse resting mycelium (Figure 13j) were observed. Verticillium tricorpus, V. isaacii and V. klebahnii differ by the formation of abundant chlamydospores (Figures 7g, 8f, 12e) and resting mycelium (Figures 7f, 8f, 12d). Verticillium zaregamsianum was described as a new species because according to Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum, accessed on September 30, 2011), there were no synonyms available for V. tricorpus. None of the two synonyms of the morphologically similar V. dahliae listed in Index Fungorum (V. ovatum G.H. Berkeley & A.B. Jackson, V. tracheiphilum Curzi) matched the morphology of V. zaregamsianum in that no yellow-pigmented hyphae were mentioned [52], [53].\n\nThe five new Verticillium species\n\nFive species-level phylogenetic groups did not contain any ex-type strains, and were thus described as new species (Figure 1). These were V. alfalfae (Figure 5) and V. nonalfalfae (Figure 10) that are relatives of V. dahliae (Figure 6) and V. longisporum (Figure 9), as well as V. zaregamsianum (Figure 13), V. isaacii (Figure 7) and V. klebahnii (Figure 8), all related to V. tricorpus (Figure 12).\n\nThe sister species Verticillium alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae (Figure 1) were previously referred to as the respective lucerne and non-lucerne pathotypes of ‘V. albo-atrum’ [46], and have long been recognized as two genetically distinct groups [47], [48]. The two species are morphologically indistinguishable, but differ in pathogenicity. Verticillium nonalfalfae causes disease on a variety of hosts whereas V. alfalfae causes disease on lucerne [44]. Other differences include vegetative compatibility groups [45], mating types (Figure 2), as well as the DNA characters listed in the species descriptions. Molecular data have previously been included in species descriptions [55], [58], [59], [61], [62]. We did not detect any genetic variation within V. alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae (Figure 1). However, variation within V. nonalfalfae has been demonstrated using AFLP markers and a proteomics approach [63], [64], [65], [66].\n\nVerticillium alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae are related to V. dahliae and V. longisporum (Figure 1), but differ morphologically by the formation of resting mycelium. However, resting mycelium is also present in the distantly related V. albo-atrum with which V. alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae have frequently been confused [15].\n\nThe existence of two distantly related groups in Verticillium forming resting mycelium was established earlier. Verticillium alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae have been referred to as ‘V. albo-atrum’ group 1, and V. albo-atrum as ‘V. albo-atrum’ group 2 [67], [68]. Robb et al. [67] suggested that ‘V. albo-atrum’ group 2 was characterized by the formation of brown-pigmented hyphae aggregating in bundles, whereas brown-pigmented hyphae in ‘V. albo-atrum’ group 1 were solitary. However, we found bundles of brown-pigmented hyphae in both V. alfalfae (Figure 5g), V. nonalfalfae and V. albo-atrum (Figure 4h), and thus, this character is not suitable for species differentiation.\n\nIt was earlier suggested that ‘V. albo-atrum’ groups 1 and 2 may constitute different species [68], [69], but details have been unclear. Using comparisons to the V. albo-atrum type description and illustrations [21], it was apparent that V. albo-atrum corresponded morphologically to ‘V. albo-atrum’ group 2. Verticillium albo-atrum forms microsclerotia (Figures 4i, 4j, 4k) in addition to resting mycelium [69], [70], [71] (Figures 4g, 4h), as well as yellow-pigmented hyphae as observed by Klebahn [35] (Figures 4b, 4l). Recently, the name ‘V. albo-atrum’ has possibly been applied more frequently to ‘V. albo-atrum’ group 1 now comprising V. alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae, than to ‘V. albo-atrum’ group 2, now V. albo-atrum. Thus, in the absence of molecular data, detailed morphological descriptions or cultures, it is not possible to relate the previous literature on ‘V. albo-atrum’ with absolute certainty to the current species concepts of V. albo-atrum, V. alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae. Adding to the confusion, there might be additional groups with similar morphology, as in a study of ‘V. albo-atrum’ diversity isolates from pea formed a separate cluster [46], [68].\n\nThe remaining three new species proposed here, V. isaacii, V. klebahnii and V. zaregamsianum are related to V. tricorpus (Figure 1). Verticillium isaacii, V. klebahnii and V. tricorpus are morphologically indistinguishable, they are characterized by the formation of resting mycelium (Figures 7f, 8e, 12d), chlamydospores (Figures 7g, 8f, 12e) and microsclerotia (Figures 7h, 8h, 12f), as well as the presence of yellow-pigmented hyphae (Figure 7i, 8h, 12h), providing the colonies on agar medium with a yellow or orange coloration (Figure 7b, 8b, 12b). The three species are a monophyletic group (Figure 1), and they could have been considered as three different lineages within just one species, V. tricorpus. However, compared with other Verticillium species, V. tricorpus, including what are now V. isaacii and V. klebahnii, was known to be very diverse, both in terms of ITS sequence data [48] and vegetative compatibility groups [72]. There is evidence for differences in pathogenicity. Verticillium tricorpus was only pathogenic on tomato [23], V. klebahnii was pathogenic on lettuce [51], and V. isaacii was not pathogenic on either lettuce or artichoke [41]. Further research is needed to determine the host ranges of these species.\n\nVerticillium zaregamsianum, the third new species related to V. tricorpus (Figure 1), is morphologically distinct from all other Verticillium species, V. zaregamsianum forms predominantly microsclerotia (Figure 13i), as well as yellow-pigmented hyphae (Figures 13k, 13l). Verticillium zaregamsianum is a pathogen of lettuce in Japan [73].\n\nTable 2 provides an overview of the taxonomic changes made in this paper and relates the new taxonomic system to previously described species.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0028341.t002"
