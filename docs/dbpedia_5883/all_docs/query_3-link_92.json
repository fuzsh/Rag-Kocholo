        "text": "Introduction: Many cyanobacterial strains possess outside their outer membrane, additional surface structures, mainly of polysaccharidic nature, that are usually referred to as exopolysaccharides (EPS). Even though EPS are common in cyanobacteria, their biosynthetic pathways and the factors that regulate these processes are far from being fully understood. However, the mechanisms involved in the synthesis of EPS are relatively conserved throughout bacteria, involving three classes of proteins: (i) enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathways of nucleotide sugars (ii) glycosyltransferases, and (iii) those required for the oligosaccharide or polysaccharide extension and processing. The sugar activation/modification enzymes and the glycosyltransferases are strain dependent, whereas the proteins involved in the polymerization, chain length control and export are generally conserved among bacteria [1]. Methods: Genome sequences were retrieved from GenBank and computer-assisted sequence ..."
