        "text": "Abstract\n\nIncompatibility between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is considered as major factor in species formation, but mechanistic understanding is poor. In evening primroses, a model plant for organelle genetics and population biology, hybrid offspring regularly displays chloroplast-nuclear incompatibility. These incompatibilities affect photosynthesis, a trait under selection in changing environments. Here we show that light-dependent misregulation of the plastid psbB operon (encoding core subunits of photosystem II and the cytochrome b6f complex), can lead to hybrid incompatibility, thus ultimately driving speciation. This misregulation results in an impaired light acclimation response in incompatible plants. Moreover, as a result of their different chloroplast genotypes, the parental lines differ in their photosynthesis performance upon exposure to different light conditions. Significantly, the incompatible chloroplast genome is naturally found in xeric habitats with high light intensities, whereas the compatible one is limited to mesic habitats. Consequently, our data raise the possibility that the hybridization barrier evolved as a result of adaptation to specific climatic conditions.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIncompatibility between nuclear and organellar genomes represents a mechanism of reproductive isolation observed in a wide range of taxa1–8. However, with the exception of the commercially important trait cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), little is known about the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). Mechanistic studies are available from only a handful of cases1,3,9–12, contrasting the great biological importance of the phenomenon. Increasing evidence accumulates that CI arises early in the separation of two genetic lineages1,5,7,8,13,14, and thus, represents an initial barrier towards reproduction isolation. This suggests that CI acts as a major factor in species formation, making a mechanistic understanding of its molecular basis and in a population genetic context highly desirable.\n\nThe evening primrose (Oenothera) is a plant model uniquely suited to address the mechanisms of reproductive isolation through hybrid incompatibility. Crosses between Oenothera species usually produce viable offspring that, however, regularly displays incompatibility between the chloroplast and the nuclear genomes (plastome-genome incompatibility; PGI). These incompatibilities represent the only strong hybridization barrier between Oenothera species, which often co-occur in overlapping ecological niches, within hybridization zones8,15,16 (Fig. 1). Hybrid incompatibility of nuclear loci is essentially absent17,18, underscoring the importance of CI as the cause of incipient isolation of the hybrid. In addition, Oenothera is a prime example for hybrid speciation19,20, in that permanent translocation heterozygosis, a form of cross-inducible functional asexuality, can occur. Such genotypes display a meiotic ring and bread true upon self-fertilization. In crosses, this can lead to an immediate fixation of a hybrid21–23 (also see Methods and below).\n\nIn evening primroses, three genetic lineages (A, B, and C) exist and are separated by PGI8,15,21. The genetic lineages occur as basic nuclear genome types in a homozygous (as AA, BB, or CC) or stable heterozygous (as AB, AC, or BC) state, and can be combined with five basic chloroplast genome types (I–V). The presence of distinct nuclear and chloroplast genomes, and the sexual separation of the species by PGI has led to the development of a genetic species concept for Oenothera15,16,18,24. Specific combinations of nuclear and chloroplast genomes define the species16. Other genome combinations can occur in weak or inviable hybrids, thus sexually separating the species (Fig. 1b). Strikingly, these chloroplast-mediated speciation barriers rely on photosynthesis, a trait under selection in changing environmental conditions25,26. This makes Oenothera an appealing model to understand the genetic basis of speciation. The incompatibility loci separating the species are relevant for speciation by definition and may even be a result of adaptive evolution.\n\nFor example, hybridization between Oenothera elata (an AA-I species) and O. grandiflora (a BB-III species) produces the incompatible combination AB-I. This genetic incompatibility poses the hybridization barrier between AA and BB species that appears to prevent colonization of western North America by B genome species (Fig. 1c)8. It should be emphasized that hybridization is frequent in the genus. As a rule, it occurs if plastome-genome combinations permit. Importantly, all viable combinations can be confirmed in hybrids in nature16. Hence, PGI appears to act as a major mechanism preventing gene flow. In addition, ecological species separation is likely to occur. For example, existence of the green and compatible hybrid AA-II can be confirmed, but it does not establish stable populations in nature16 (Fig 1a,b).\n\nIt is assumed that climate changes and periods of glaciation during the Pleistocene have shaped the genetic and ecological characteristics of the basic lineages A, B and C21. This is well supported by the estimated divergence time of the chloroplast genomes27 and nuclear genome variation28,29. Following this view, the three lineages originated from Middle America and reached the North American continent in several waves. The lineages resemble the ancestral sexual and homozygous species AA-I, BB-III and CC-V, and crosses between them usually result in PGI8,15. However, during the Pleistocene, hybridization between the basic lineages must have happened that produced viable offspring16,20,21. Those were fixed in the structural heterozygous and functional asexual species (AB-II or BA-III, AC-IV, and BC-IV). Hence, especially plastome II and IV can be seen as relict genotypes of earlier stages of plastome evolution15,16. Finally, it should be mentioned that also recent plastome divergence appears to be a consequence of glaciation. Separation of plastome II and III in the two major subpopulations of O. biennis coincides with the expansion of the Wisconsin glacier, suggesting post-glaciation dispersal events30 (Fig 1a).\n\nThe aim of this work was to understand the mechanism of the AB-I incompatibly that genetically separates the A and B lineages (Fig. 1). Based on association mapping in the chloroplast genome, the dual promoter region in the intergenic spacer between the clpP operon and the psbB operon was proposed to be involved in the incompatibility AB-I. The clpP gene encodes the proteolytic subunit of the Clp protease, the psbB operon encodes core subunits of photosystem II (PSII) and the cytochrome b6f complex (Cytb6f)31. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the incompatibility have remained enigmatic.\n\nResults\n\nAB-I plants are unable to acclimate to higher light conditions\n\nAB-I plants display a yellow-green (lutescent) leaf chlorosis, caused by disturbed PSII activity31 (Fig. 2a,b). The photosynthetic defects occur specifically under increased light intensities (Fig. 2b). Whereas at 300 μE m-2s-1 (low light, LL), the compatible wild type AB-II and the incompatible hybrid AB-I are indistinguishable from each other, higher light intensities cause severe photodamage in AB-I. Consistent with our previous study, already at 450 μE m-2s-1 (high light, HL), a substantial portion of PSII was photodamaged. Interestingly, AB-I plants are also unable to perform an efficient light acclimation response when shifted to HL conditions (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Text): Whereas AB-II plants responded to the increased growth light intensity by strongly increasing their chlorophyll content (Supplementary Figure 1a) and the contents of all redox-active components of the electron transport chain (Fig. 2b), AB-I plants were incapable of performing this light acclimation response efficiently. This behavior, inhibited in AB-I plants, is a typical reaction when plants previously grown under light-limited conditions are transferred to higher light intensities32. Finally, this leads to a relative reduction of the components of the electron transport chain, namely PSI, PSII and Cytb6f, but not the ATP synthase (ATPase) and plastocyanin (PC), in AB-I plants compared to AB-II (Fig. 2b,c; Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Text). In summary, AB-I plants display a light-dependent phenotype of photosynthetic acclimation that cannot be assigned to a single component of the electron transport chain. In addition, the disturbance in acclimation response is independent of ATP synthase and PC function.\n\nThe better adaptation of wild-type AA-I plants to high light is conferred by the chloroplast genotype\n\nTo examine, if the genetic differences between plastome I and II have phenotypic effects under high light conditions also in a compatible background (i.e., could be subject to selection in the parental species), we compared the light-acclimation response of green wild-type AA-I (O. elata) plants with green wild-type AB-II (O. biennis). In addition, we investigated, whether potential differences are due to the chloroplast by including the green chloroplast substitution line of the two genotypes (AA-II; Fig. 1b). Since this experiment involved green material only, a harsher and more natural light shift from 300 μE m-2s-1 to 600 μE m-2s-1 (harsh high light, HHL) could be analyzed. The latter condition already induces severe damage in the incompatible AB-I genotype (Supplementary Text). In 300 μE m-2s-1, all photosynthetic parameters investigated (chlorophyll a/b ratio, chlorophyll content, FV/FM, linear electron transport capacity, and chloroplast ATP synthase activity) were very similar between the three genotypes (Table 1). However, after the shift to high light, pronounced differences started to occur. While most parameters were not, or only weakly, affected in AA-I plants, the AB-II genotype showed a drastic loss of electron transport capacity. This was accompanied by marked decreases in the chlorophyll a/b ratio, chlorophyll content per leaf area, and chloroplast ATP synthase activity. Strikingly, similar changes also occurred in AA-II plants, indicating that mainly the plastome, and not the nuclear genetic background, is causal for these differences in light acclimation. However, in comparison to typical light acclimation responses of angiosperms, which (due to degradation of the chlorophyll b binding antenna proteins) result in increased electron transport capacity, chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a/b ratio32, the response of AA-I plants to increased light intensity is limited. It, therefore, can be concluded that plastome I is better adapted to cope with high light conditions than plastome II, although at least under the conditions tested, the johansen Standard strain of O. elata, originally isolated in California16,33, does not behave like a typical high light plant.\n\nRNA editing is not involved in the AB-I incompatibility of Oenothera\n\nCausative chloroplast loci for the described phenotypes could be related to mRNA editing sites that often display great variability between even closely related species9,34. RNA editing in chloroplasts of seed plants involves C-to-U conversions at highly specific sites35. It is of particular interest, since the only previously described mechanism of PGI is based on an editing deficiency of the tobacco atpA transcript (encoding a core subunit of the plastid ATP synthase) when exposed to the nuclear genetic background of the deadly nightshade Atropa9. However, as evidenced by sequencing of the chloroplast transcriptomes of O. elata (AA-I), O. biennis (AB-II), and O. grandiflora (BB-III), mRNA editing does not play a causal role in the AB-I incompatibility. All compatible wild-type genome combinations of the three species share the same 45 mRNA editing sites (Supplementary Table 2 and updated GenBank records AJ271079.4, EU262889.2, and KX014625.1). This analysis also includes partially edited sites, whose biological relevance is doubtful (see Supplementary Table 2 and Materials and Methods for details). These results exclude the possibility that editing sites in the plastome and/or nucleus-encoded editing factors differ between the genotypes involved in the AB-I incompatibility, as this was reported for an experimentally produced cybrid of Atropa and tobacco9.\n\nAssociation mapping of plastid loci causing the AB-I incompatibility\n\nHaving ruled out the involvement of mRNA editing, we performed an association mapping in the chloroplast genome of Oenothera to pinpoint the causative loci for the AB-I incompatibility. In contrast to the green alga Chlamydomonas, chloroplast genomes of higher plants are not amenable to linkage mapping36,37. Hence, identification of functionally relevant loci is usually based on correlation of a polymorphism to a phenotype in a mapping panel (e.g. Refs.31,38,39). In the case of the AB-I incompatibility, this can be achieved by manual inspection of an alignment of fully sequenced chloroplast genomes and search for specific polymorphisms in plastome I vs. II, III and IV. Those polymorphisms are considered candidates for causing the AB-I incompatibility, because only plastome I confers the bleached lutescent phenotype in the AB nuclear genetic background, whereas plastomes II, III and IV are all green when combined with the same nucleus15,31. Our original analyses of the AB-I phenotype had included only four chloroplast genomes and yielded 16 candidate regions31. Taking advantage of the power of next-generation sequencing technologies, we now were able to base the association mapping on 46 full chloroplast genomes, whose genetic behavior had been determined by extensive crossing studies40–43 (Methods; Supplementary Table 1). The chosen strains represent the material used for generalization of the genetic species concept in Oenothera that is based on the basic A, B and C nuclear and I – V chloroplast genotypes16,21 (see Introduction). Altogether, the mapping panel included 18 chloroplast genomes representing plastome type I (Methods; Supplementary Table 1). Only four polymorphisms were absolutely linked with the AB-I phenotype, in that they were specific to plastome I and could potentially be involved in the AB-I incompatibility: (i) a 144 bp deletion in the clpP – psbB operon spacer region, (ii) a combined 5 bp deletion/21 bp insertion (indel) in the psbM – petN spacer (genes encoding a PSII and a Cytb6f subunit, respectively), (iii) a 194 bp deletion in the ndhG – ndhI spacer (two genes encoding subunits of NADH dehydrogenase complex), and (iv) a 21 bp insertion in the trnL-UAA – trnT-UGU spacer (Supplementary Datasets 1-3).\n\nDue to the lack of measurable sexual recombination frequencies in chloroplast genomes of seed plants37 (see above), genetic methods cannot be employed to further narrow down on the causative loci for the AB-I incompatibility in plastome I. We, therefore, evaluated the remaining candidate polymorphisms with respect to their potential to cause the incompatible phenotype. The deletion in the ndhG – ndhI spacer and the deletion in the trnL-UAA – trnT-UGU spacer cannot explain the observed light-dependent reduction of specific photosynthetic complexes in AB-I incompatible material (Fig. 2). The neighboring genes do not encode components of the electron transport chain, and, moreover, knockouts of NDH complex subunits lack any discernible phenotype44. Possible effects on the expression of trnL-UAA and/or trnT-UGU, two essential tRNAs, would be much more pleiotropic and not depend on the light intensity. Based on the functions of the genes affected, a contribution of the latter two polymorphisms to the AB-I phenotype is extremely unlikely. By contrast, the polymorphisms affecting the psbB operon and the psbM/petN spacer are serious candidates, in that they potentially affect both PSII and Cytb6f, which is in line with the physiological data (Fig. 1b).\n\nThe psbN-petN spacer region may make a minor contribution to the AB-I incompatibly\n\nTo examine the contribution of the combined 5 bp/21 bp indel in the psbM – petN spacer, transcript and protein analyses were performed in incompatible AB-I plants and compatible controls under LL and HL conditions (Fig. 3). The indel is located in the 3’-UTR of both genes (Fig. 3a) and, therefore, could potentially affect the stability of their transcripts.\n\nNorthern blot analyses revealed that both genes are affected by the indel. For psbM, reduction of the 0.35 kb monocistronic transcript was observed for AA-II and AB-I under LL, and for AB-II and AB-I under HL conditions. Although there is no obvious explanation for this light-dependent effect, it is independent of the AB-I incompatibility in that the levels of psbM mRNA cannot be linked to the AB-I phenotype (Fig. 3b and below). Moreover, as judged from knockout mutants in tobacco, even complete loss of the PsbM protein does not lead to a strong phenotype that would be comparable to our material45. By contrast, petN encodes an essential subunit of the Cytb6f46,47, and reduced petN transcript stability, therefore, could affect Cytb6f accumulation. Northern blot analysis of petN mRNA accumulation detected a mature transcript of 0.3 kb (Fig. 3a). Under LL conditions, petN transcript accumulation is unaltered in the incompatible hybrid, whereas under HL, the petN mRNA is significantly reduced in AB-I material (Fig. 3c). Western blot analyses showed that this leads to a reduction at the protein level to approximately 80% (Fig. 3d), an estimate that is well supported by our spectroscopic quantification of Cytb6f (Fig. 1b).\n\nTaken together, these data do not exclude the possibility that the psbM/petN region influences the incompatibility phenotype, but suggest a rather minor contribution. First, involvement of psbM is very unlikely, because down-regulation of its mature transcript is observed also in compatible AA-II plants under LL conditions (Fig. 3b). Second, a role of petN is unlikely as well, since reduction of about 20% of the Cytb6f content (Fig. 2b, Fig. 3d) does not affect accumulation of the photosystems46–49. Hence, another chloroplast locus must be causally responsible for the AB-I incompatibility.\n\nThe promotor region of the psbB operon is the major locus causing the AB-I incompatibly\n\nNext, we analyzed the transcript patterns of the clpP and psbB operons that flank the 144 bp deletion in the spacer region (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Northern blot analyses revealed that accumulation of both the clpP precursor transcript and the mature clpP mRNA did not differ in control plants and incompatible plants under HL conditions. All clpP transcripts accumulated to similar levels as in the compatible lines. Similarly, no difference in transcript accumulation of the remaining operon genes residing upstream of clpP (rpl20 and 5’-rps12) was observed (Supplementary Fig. 2b). In addition, analyses of ClpP protein accumulation and the integritiy of the plastid ribosomes revealed no difference between compatible and incompatible material50. Based on these findings, a contribution of the clpP operon to the incompatibility phenotype can be excluded. By contrast, transcript accumulation of all psbB operon genes (psbB, psbT, psbH, petB and petD) was found to be reduced in AB-I plants under HL, but not under LL conditions (Fig. 4b,f; Supplementary Fig. 2). Run-on transcription analyses revealed that this effect was due to impaired transcription rather than an effect of altered transcript stability. psbB operon transcription was specifically reduced under HL conditions in the incompatible hybrids (Fig. 4d). Consequently, in contrast to the green AA-I, AA-II and AB-II plants, the deletion in plastome I in the AB background affects regulation of the psbB operon promoter in a light-dependent manner (Fig. 4d). Importantly, the same promoter is used in all genetic backgrounds, as evidenced by mapping of the transcription start sites (Fig. 4c), which are also highly conserved between species (Fig. 4a). The deletion does not affect the TATA box of the psbB operon promoter, but resides 7 bp upstream of the −35 box. This may suggest that polymerase binding per se is not affected, and instead, binding of auxiliary proteins such as sigma factors is impaired by the deletion in the incompatible hybrids (see Discussion).\n\nInterestingly, pbf1 (photosystem biogenesis factor 1, previously designated psbN), a gene involved in PSI and PSII assembly, is down-regulated in AB-I incompatible plants under HL conditions (Fig. 4e). Since the gene is transcribed from the opposite strand by its own promoter that lacks any polymorphism in all Oenothera plastomes sequenced so far (Supplementary Datasets S1-S3), the reduction in pbf1 transcript accumulation must result from the sense-antisense interaction with the psbT mRNA, as previously described for Arabidopsis51,52. Alternatively, it might be the result of an unknown feedback regulation. In any case, the interaction results in a strong reduction of Pbf1 protein accumulation (Fig. 4f). Since pbf1 knockouts are extremely light-sensitive, and show severe defects in PSII and, to a lesser extent, also in PSI accumulation53,54, it appears likely that the effect on the pbf1 mRNA also contributes to the incompatibility phenotype.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur work reported here shows that light-dependent misregulation of a core photosynthesis operon leads to hybrid incompatibility, thus causing reproductive isolation and ultimately, speciation. Interestingly, the underlying genetic architecture was shaped during the last ice age by periods of glaciation (see Introduction). The mechanism we have uncovered is different from that of the two other PGIs studied so far. RNA editing of the atpA transcript was identified as causal for chloroplast-nuclear incompatibly in an Atropa/tobacco synthetic cybrid9 (see above). Variation in the coding regions of accD (the plastid-encoded subunit of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase, catalyzing the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis) was suggested as a genetic determinant of PGI in pea55. However, the Atropa/tobacco case represents a non-natural, artificial combination of the plastid and the nuclear genomes of two non-crossable species, and, unfortunately, the evidence for possible causative loci for the incompatibility in pea are currently not strong enough to judge their impact on natural populations56. Moreover, in both cases, the ecological relevance of the suggested PGI loci is unclear and cannot be deduced from the identified polymorphisms.\n\nBy contrast, our data indicate that the AB-I incompatibility might have evolved as a result of ecological selection. That cytoplasmic incompatibly can result from ecological selection is obvious from work in sunflower, were common garden experiments in xeric and mesic habitats demonstrated maintenance of cytoplasmic incompatibility by positive selection57. The underlying genes and physiology, however, have remained enigmatic. Our study demonstrates that photosynthesis-related genes encoded in the chloroplast genome can establish hybridization barriers. The incompatible phenotype is only visible under HL condition in that AB-I plants cannot perform the necessary acclimation response (see above). Strikingly, plastome I in the native AA nuclear genetic background of O. elata (a species adapted to the western United States and Mexico) copes better with high light conditions than the AB-II genotype of O. biennis, native to the North American woodlands16. This effect is plastome dependent, since the green AA-II chloroplast substitution line is phenotypically very similar to O. biennis. However, to what extent the identified incompatibility locus is involved in a light acclimation response of AA-I species in their natural habitats remains to be addressed in further investigations. At least within their natural range of distribution, species carrying plastome I colonized Central and the south west of North American (xeric habitats with high light irradiation), whereas species carrying plastomes II, III, IV or V are limited to the mesic sites of eastern North America (Fig. 1C)16,21. Hence, plastome I seems to be a required for colonization of habitats exposed to higher irradiation. This assumption is further supported by the fact that O. biennis (AB-II or BA-III), a species that spread after 1970 west of the Great Plains, is only rarely found in the southern parts of the USA and is still absent from Mexico16,21. Consequently, the loci underlying the AB-I incompatibility seem to prevent colonization of the south western parts of North America by the B genome by creating an asymmetric hybridization barrier between AA-I and AB-II, BA-III and BB-III species. At the same time, the compatible genome combination AA-I may have facilitated physiological adaptation of the corresponding species by nuclear-cytoplasmic co-evolution. It, therefore, seems reasonable to assume that, as a result of higher light intensities (and/or light quality differences) in xeric habitats, the deletion upstream of the psbB operon promoter co-evolved with nucleus-encoded proteins that interact with the (bacterial-type) plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP).\n\nStrong candidates for these interacting proteins are the PEP sigma factors, which were shown to regulate polymerase binding in response to both light quality and light quantity58,59. Moreover, regulation by sigma factors (e.g., through redox induced phosphorylation) influences the stoichiometry of the protein complexes of the photosynthetic electron transport chain60. Thus, the failure of AB-I plants to acclimate to high light intensities could be a direct consequence of disturbed transcriptional regulation by sigma factors. Co-evolution and coordinated rates of molecular evolution of PEP core subunits and sigma factors could be a common principle in plant evolution, as suggested by recent findings in Geraniaceae, a family where PGI is also widespread61.\n\nFinally, it should be emphasized that, although the psbB operon does not encode PSI-related genes, its transcriptional misregulation also explains the observed effect on PSI, due to the antisense interaction with the pbf1 mRNA or an unknown mechanism of feedback regulation (Fig. 4). Interestingly, while the psbB operon (including the pbf1 gene on the opposite strand) displays extremely high structural conservation from cyanobacteria to higher plants, light regulation of pbf1 transcript abundance was shown to be highly variable between species62.\n\nMethods\n\nPlant material\n\nThroughout this work, the terms “Oenothera” or “evening primrose” refer to subsection Oenothera (genus Oenothera section Oenothera, Onagraceae; 2n = 2x = 14)16. Plant material used here is derived from the Oenothera germplasm resource harbored at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology (Potsdam-Golm, Germany), which includes the living taxonomic reference collection of subsection Oenothera17. Part of this reference collection is the so-called Renner Assortment, a medium-sized collection of European lines thoroughly characterized by the genetic school of Otto Renner21,63. In addition, it includes the Cleland collection, a large set of North American strains of subsection Oenothera that was extensively studied by Ralph E. Cleland21. Present as well are North American accessions analyzed by Wilfried Stubbe and co-workers, which represent the species of this subsection recognized later than the 1960s64–71. The availability of this material allowed us to employ the original source of lines on which the genetic species concept of subsection Oenothera is based cf. ref.72 (see Main Text). The lines employed for association mapping of the plastidic AB-I locus were extensively analyzed by classical genetics for the compatibility relations of their nuclear and chloroplast genomes (Supplementary Table 3 for details).\n\nRNA editing analyses were performed with the wild type strains of Oenothera elata subsp. hookeri strain johansen Standard (AA-I), O. grandiflora strain Tuscaloosa (BB-III) and O. biennis strain suaveolens Grado (AB-II). See Supplementary Table 3 for a summary of all wild-type strains used in this work.\n\nFor all other genetic or physiological work presented here, the wild type strains johansen Standard (AA-I) and suaveleons Grado (AB-II) or chloroplast substitution lines between them (AA-II and AB-I) were used. Here, AA-I refers to the wild type situation, i.e. strain johansen Standard with its native nuclear and chloroplast genomes. AA-II refers to the nuclear genome of johansen Standard combined with the chloroplast genome of suaveolens Grado. AB-II designates nuclear and chloroplast genomes of the wild type strain suaveolens Grado, and AB-I the nuclear genome of suaveolens Grado equipped with the chloroplast genome of johansen Standard. Generation of AA-II and AB-I from the wild types AB-II and AA-I is detailed below (also see summary in Supplementary Table 4).\n\nAs tobacco wild type, the cultivar Petit Havana was used. The tobacco ΔpetN mutant was obtained from47.\n\nGeneration of chloroplast substitution lines\n\nIn Oenothera, the genetics of permanent translocation heterozygosity, combined with a biparental transmission of plastids offer an elegant opportunity to substitute chloroplasts between species in only two generations, while leaving the nuclear genome constitution unaltered40,41,73. The general principles, including a detailed discussion of crossing examples, are presented for example in Rauwolf et al. (2008)22. The interested reader is referred to this previous work. The chloroplast substitution between the strains suaveolens Grado and grandiflora Tuscaloosa [described in Fig. 6 of Rauwolf et al. (2008)22] resembles the chloroplast substitution between suaveolens Grado and johansen Standard used in this work.\n\nIn brief, due to reciprocal chromosomal translocations, many species of Oenothera form permanent multi-chromosomal meiotic rings. If all members of a given chromosome complement are involved in a single ring, they establish two regularly segregating sets of genetically linked chromosomes. This leads to formation of two superlinkage groups, each involving one complete parental haploid chromosome set (α and β). Suppression of homologous recombination avoids genetic reshuffling between the two haploid sets. Additional genetic properties, especially presence of gametophytic lethal factors that lead to sex-linked inheritance of a given haploid set, eliminate homozygous segregants (α·α or β·β). This results in permanent heterozygous progeny (α·β) that is identical to the parental plant. The phenomenon of structural heterozygosity is a form of functional “asexuality”. However, also “sexual” species exist in Oenothera, i.e., species that display bivalentpairing and regular meiotic segregation. In contrast to the structurally heterozygous species, they lack lethal factors and are homozygotous for their haploid sets (haplo·haplo vs. α·β from above)21,63.\n\nAs a consequence of this genetic behavior, entire haploid chromosome sets in evening primrose can behave as alleles of a single Mendelian locus. These so-called Renner complexes are designated with (Latin) names; e.g. Galbicans·Gflavens (α·β) for the structurally heterozygous strain suaveolens Grado or hjohansen Standard. hjohansen Standard (haplo·haplo) for the homozygous line johansen Standard. A cross between them (suaveolens Grado x johansen Stanard = Gablicans. Gflavens x hjohansen Standard. hjohansen Standard) yields in the F1 the offspring Galbicans. hjohansen Standard and Gflavens. hjohansen Standard.\n\nTo equip johansen Standard (AA-I) with the chloroplast of suaveolens Grado (AB-II), the F1 hybrid Galbicans.hjohansen Standard is used. It carries (due to biparental inheritance of chloroplasts in evening primroses) the chloroplasts of both johansen Standard (I-johSt) and suaveolens Grado (II-suavG). (The other hybrid Gflavens.hjohansen Standard is not of interest and therefore discarded.) Since Galbicans.hjohansen Standard I-johSt/II-suavG displays a full meiotic ring, this leads to suppression of homologous recombination as well as elimination of random chromosome assortment in meiosis (see above). Therefore, as a result of Mendelian segregation of the hjohansen Standard complex, the johansen Standard strain (hjohansen Standard.hjohansen Standard) can be bred back from Galbicans.hjohansen Standard upon selfing. (Galbicans.hjohansen Standard x s = Galbicans.Galbicans, Galbicans.hjohansen Standard and hjohansen Standard.hjohansen Standard; the sergeant Galbicans.Galbicans is not realized due to a male gametophytic lethal factor in Galbicans). When a Galbicans.hjohansen Standard plant homoplasmic for II-suavG is used for selfing, the johansen\n\nStandard plant in F2 now carries plastome II-suavG (AA-II). If AB-I plants are desired, the Galbicans.hjohansen Standard I-johSt/II-suavG hybrid in F1 is selected for I-johSt and backcrossed with suaveolens Grado (Gabicans.Gflavens II-suavG). BC1 then reassembles Galbicans.Gflavens I-johSt/II-suavG which, due to the maternal dominance of biparental transmission in evening primrose39,74,75, contains a major proportion of Galbicans.Gflavens I-johSt, i.e., AB-I plants.\n\nPlant cultivation, growth conditions, and tissue harvest\n\nFor crossing studies, plastome sequencing and analysis of RNA editing, Oenothera plants were cultivated in a glasshouse as previously described17. AA-I, AA-II, AB-I and AB-II plants for genetic and physiological analyses were cultivated in soil in growth chambers at a 16 h light/8 h darkness cycle and 24°C at low light intensities (~150 μE m-2s-1). After formation of the early rosette (cf. ref.17), plants were transferred to higher light intensities, i.e., 300 μE m-2s-1 (low light, LL), 450 μE m-2s-1 (high light, HL) or 600 μE m-2s-1 (harsh high light, HHL), and kept under the same growth regime. 600 μE m-2s-1 was used only for a single experiment, because it already resulted in severe photodamage of the incompatible combination AB-I (see Supplementary Text). To avoid pleiotropic effects, the yellowish material of the bleached leaf tip, a typical characteristic of the lutescent AB-I incompatible phenotype (Fig. 1a), was excluded from all experiments. The tobacco ΔpetN mutant and its corresponding wild type were cultivated as reported earlier47.\n\nThylakoid membrane isolation from Oenothera leaves\n\nFor spectroscopic measurements and bluenative PAGE, an improved thylakoid membrane isolation protocol was developed for Oenothera leaf tissue that contains high amounts of mucilage and starch. All steps were performed at 4°C. Solutions were pre-chilled, leaves shortly placed in ice-cold water and dried with a salad spinner. Approximately 10 g of mature leaf tissue dark adapted for 1 h was homogenized in a blender adding 200 ml of Isolation Buffer [330 mM sorbitol, 50 mM HEPES, 25 mM boric acid, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaF (optional), pH 7.6 with KOH, and 5 mM freshly added Na-ascorbate]. 100 ml aliquots of the homogenate were then filtered through a double layer of cheese cloth (Hartmann), followed by filtering through a single layer of Miracloth (Merck). After that, the following procedure was applied twice: After adjustment of the solution to 200 ml with Isolation Buffer, it was centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 g and the pellet subsequently resuspended in 40 ml of Isolation Buffer using a 30-cm3 Potter homogenizer (mill chamber tolerance: 0.15 to 0.25 mm; VWR). Subsequent to the second homogenization step, the solution was adjusted to 200 ml with Washing Buffer (50 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.6, 5 mM sorbitol, and optionally 10 mM NaF) followed by a filtering step through one layer of Miracloth. Subsequently, the thylakoid homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 g, the pellet resuspended with a 30-cm3 Potter homogenizer in 30 ml Washing Buffer and centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 g. Then, after resuspending the thylakoids in 5 ml of Washing Buffer, the homogenate was placed on a 85% Percoll cushion [Percoll stock solution: 3% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 1% (w/v) BSA, 1% (w/v) Ficoll 400, dissolved in Percoll; 85% Percoll: 85% PBF-Percoll stock solution, 330 mM sorbitol, 50 mM HEPES, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2; pH7.6 with KOH] in a 30 ml Corex tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 g. This step effectively removes starch from the isolation. Finally, thylakoids (that do not enter the Percoll cushion) are collected, washed in altogether 25 ml of Washing Buffer, centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 g and resuspended in the desired puffer and volume.\n\nSpectroscopic methods\n\nFor quantification of isolated thylakoids, chlorophyll amounts were determined in 80% (v/v) acetone76. The contents of PSII, PSI, Cytb6f and PC were determined in thylakoids as described previously77. PSI was quantified from P700 difference absorption signals at 830 to 870 nm in solubilized thylakoids using the Dual-PAM-100 instrument (Walz)49,78. Contents of PSII and Cytb6f were determined from difference absorption measurements of cytochrome b559 and Cytb6f, respectively. Measurement procedures and data deconvolution methods have been described previously in detail78,79. Maximum Fv/Fm values were measured in leaves adapted for one hour to darkness. Chlorophyll fluorescence was recorded with a pulse amplitude-modulated fluorimeter (Dual-PAM-100) on intact plants at room temperature. A F-6500 fluorometer (Jasco) was used to measure 77 K chlorophyll-a fluorescence emission spectra on freshly isolated thylakoid membranes equivalent to 10 μg chlorophyll ml-1. The sample was excited at 430 nm wavelength with a bandwidth of 10 nm, and the emission spectrum was recorded between 655 and 800 nm wavelengths in 0.5 nm intervals with a bandwidth of 1 nm. Dark-interval relaxation kinetics of the electrochromic shift, which is a measure for the proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane, were used to determine the thylakoid conductivity for protons (gH+), which is a proxy for ATP synthase activity. Electrochromic shift signals were measured and deconvoluted using a KLAS-100 spectrophotometer (Walz) as previously described80.\n\nAntibody source and anti-PetN serum production\n\nThe Pbf1 (PsbN) antibody used in this work was described in Torabi et al. (2014)54. The anti-AtpA antibody and the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate antibodies) were obtained from Agrisera. To prepare an antibody against the PetN protein, rabbits were injected with PEG2-FTFSLSLVVWGRSGL-PEG2-C-Amid (BioGenes GmbH), a highly hydrophobic peptide comprising about half of the PetN protein. The peptide was coated with PEG2 (8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid) to ensure better solubility. Active serum was obtained after four immunizations.\n\nProtein analyses\n\nBlue-native PAGE was performed as previously reported81,82. To avoid protein degradation, 10 mM of NaF was added to all solutions. Thylakoid membranes were solubilized with dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) at a final concentration of 1% and separated in 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Protein equivalents of 30 μg chlorophyll were loaded.\n\nFor western blot analyses, thylakoids were mixed with Sample Buffer [50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mM DTT, 4% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250] and denatured for 5 min at 95°C under continuous agitation. Then, samples were subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE (16% T separation gel and 4% T stacking gel) followed by gel blotting onto a PVDF membrane (0.2 μm) using the semi-dry PEQLAB transfer system (PEQLAB Biotechnologie GmbH). After incubation with the secondary antibody, immunochemical detection was performed with the help of the ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare) according to the supplier’s recommendations. In the relevant figures, 100% loading corresponds to 3 μg chlorophyll equivalent.\n\nIsolation of nucleic acids\n\nDNA and RNA isolations from evening primroses were performed employing protocols specially developed for their mucilage and phenolic compound rich tissue, as previously described in Massouh et al. (2016)83.\n\nAssociation mapping of the plastid AB-I locus\n\nFor association mapping in the chloroplast genome, 46 full plastome sequences of Oenothera were employed for which precise genetic information is available (Supplementary Table 1 and Plant Material section). To this end, we newly determined the sequences of 30 plastomes, now available from GenBank under the accession numbers KT881175.1, KX014625.1, MN807266.1, MN807267.1, and MN812468.1 to MN812493.1. The new chloroplast genomes were annotated and submitted by GeSeq v1.43 and GB2sequin v1.384, respectively. The remaining 16 plastomes were previously published (see Supplementary Table 1 for details). Chloroplast genome sequencing from Oenothera total DNA was done as reported earlier39,83, but using a higher version of the SeqMan NGen assembly software (v14.1.0; DNASTAR). Also, in contrast to earlier work, 250 bp Illumina paired-end reads (instead of 100 bp or 150 bp) were generated, with the exception of KX014625.1 (100 bp paired-end) and MN807266.1 and MN807267.1 (both 150 bp paired-end). Subsequently, for association mapping, the redundant inverted repeat A (IRA) was removed, sequences were aligned with ClustralW and the alignments manually curated in Mesquite v3.4085. Polymorphisms specific to plastome I (i.e., polymorphisms that were present in all 18 plastome I genotypes, but absent from all 28 plastome II, III and IV genotypes) were identified by visual inspection in SeqMan Pro v15.2.0 (DNASTAR) cf. ref.31. For original data, see Supplementary Dataset 1.\n\nRNA editing analyses\n\nTo determine the RNA editotype of the Oenothera chloroplast, RNA-seq samples of the 1kp project28,86 of johansen Standard (AA-I), suaveolens Grado (AB-II), and grandiflora Tuscaloosa (BB-III; NCBI SRA Accession Numbers ERS631151, ERS631122, and ERS631139; also see Plant Material section) were mapped against their respective chloroplast genomes (AJ271079.4, KX014625.1, and EU262889.2) from which the IRA had been removed. For this we employed the “reference-guided assembly – special workflows” pipeline of SeqMan NGen v15.2.0. SNPs were called in SeqMan Pro v15.2.0. To deal with the heterogeneity of the mRNA population, partial editing and sequencing errors, sites showing C-to-T (U) conversion of at least 30% were originally considered as mRNA editing sites. If editing could not be detected above this threshold at a given site in all three species, the sites were subjected to manual inspection of the original mapping data. In most cases, this procedure revealed mapping errors, however, in a few cases also partial editing below 30% in at least one of the strains was uncovered.\n\nGel blot detection of RNA\n\nNorthern blot analyses were performed as previously described83. Genespecific PCR products used as probes were obtained by employing the primers listed in Supplementary Table 5. Total Oenothera DNA was used as template in standard PCR reactions.\n\nChloroplast run-on analyses\n\nFor slot-blot preparation of DNA probes, PCR-amplified DNA probes (Supplementary Table 5) were immobilized to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham) through a slot-blot manifold. For this, 1.5 μg of DNA was denatured in 0.5 M NaOH and heated for 10 min at 95°C. Then, the volume of the denatured DNA probes was adjusted with water to 100 μl per spot. After heating, the probes were cooled on ice for 2 min to prevent DNA renaturation, and briefly centrifuged to collect the condensate. To each sample, 20 μl of cold 0.5 M NaOH and 0.5 μl of cold 10 x DNA-Loading Dye [50% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mM EDTA, 0.25% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 0.25% (w/v) xylene cyanol] were added. Subsequently, the samples were spotted to the ddH2O pre-hydrated nylon membrane and then 100 μl 0.5 M NaOH was applied to each spot. After drying the membrane at room temperature for 5 min, the DNA was cross-linked to the membrane with 0.12 J/cm2 using the UV crosslinker BLX-254 (BIO-LINK).\n\nTo analyze strand-specific gene expression of pbf1, single-stranded pbf1 RNA probes were generated using the Ambion® Maxiscript® T7 Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and immobilized through a slot-blot manifold to a Hybond-N nylon membrane. The pbf1 gene of johansen Standard was amplified with the primer pair psbNRO_F 5’-AGCATTGGGAGGCTCATTAC-3’ and psbNRO_R 5’-GGAAACAGCAACCCTAGTCG-3’ and cloned into to pCRTM2.1-TOPO® (Invitrogen). The vector was linearized with HindIII and in vitro transcription was performed according to the suppliers’ protocol. 1.5 μg of RNA was adjusted with nuclease-free water to a volume of 50 μl prior to incubation with 30 μl of 20 x SSC (0.3 M sodium citrate and 3.0 M sodium chloride) and 20 μl 37% formaldehyde at 60°C for 30 min. Samples were maintained on ice and spotted to the ddH2O and 10 x SSC pre-hydrated nylon membrane. Next, 100 μl 10x SSC was applied per slot. After drying the membrane at room temperature for 5 min the RNA was cross-linked with an UV crosslinker as described above.\n\nFor in vitro transcription and hybridization to slot-blot membranes, chloroplasts from Oenothera leaves harvested 8-10 weeks after germination were isolated and counted according to a previously published protocol, applying the same minor modifications as described in Sobanski et al. (2019)39. Then, a chloroplast suspension containing 4.9 x 107 chloroplasts was transferred to a fresh tube, centrifuged at 5,000 g for 1 min and the supernatant was removed. To start the in vitro transcription, 20 units of RNase Inhibitor (Promega GmbH), 50 μCi of [α-32P] UTP, and 94 μl Transcription Buffer (50 mM Tris—HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM CTP, GTP, and ATP, 0.01 mM UTP, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) were added, mixed and incubated for 10 min at 25°C. Next, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of Stop Buffer [5% (w/v) Na-lauroylsarcosine, 50 mM Tris—HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA] followed by a RNA isolation protocol, where 100 μl of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) was added to the reaction, vortexed, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 18,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Afterwards, the upper phase was collected and nucleic acids were predicated overnight at −20°C using 3 volumes of 100% (v/v) ethanol, 0.3 M sodium acetate and 1 μl GlycoBlue™ (Invitrogen). On the next day, the sample was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 1 h at 4°C. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed in 75% (v/v) ethanol and dissolved in 50 μl of RNase-free water. Next, the RNA was denatured at 75°C for 15 min and cooled for 2 min on ice. Before hybridizing the slot-blots with the isolated RNA, the membrane was pre-hybridized with 20 ml of Church Buffer [1 mM EDTA, 7% (w/v) SDS, 0.5 M NaHPO4 pH 7.2] in hybridization tubes at 65°C for 1 h. Hybridization was performed at 65°C overnight. Subsequently, the membrane was washed once with 1 x SSC and 0.2% (w/v) SDS for 10 min, and once with 0.5 x SSC and 0.2% (w/v) SDS for 10 min. After washing, the membrane was wrapped in a transparent foil and exposed to a storage phosphor screen for 5 days. The signals were detected using an Amersham Typhoon IP scanner.\n\n5’-RACE to map transcription start sites\n\nTAP transcript 5’-end mapping in Oenothera chloroplasts was performed as previously described87. In brief, primary transcripts of bacteria and cell organelles harbor triphosphates at their 5’ ends, while processed transcripts possess monophosphates at this position. The TAP enzyme (tobacco acid pyrophosphatase) removes the additional phosphates from the 5’-end of primary transcripts. After this treatment, both primary and processed transcripts can serve as substrate for RNA ligase. This allows to distinguish between primary and processed transcripts, when +TAP and -TAP treated samples are compared. In -TAP samples, ligation products originating form primary transcripts are absent. Hence, to map the transcription start sites of the psbB operon and to distinguish them from processing sites in close proximity, a 5’-RACE from +TAP (Epicenter) and -TAP RNA samples was performed. For this, RNA samples of both treatments were ligated to an RNA linker (5’-GUGAUCCAACCGACGCGACAAGCUAAUGCAAGANNN-3’). After cDNA synthesis with a psbB gene-specific primer (psbB_cDNA_jn 5’-GCTGGCTGTCCATATAATGCATACAGC-3’), two PCRs were performed: The first PCR employed the linker-specific primer RUMSH1 (5’-TGATCCAACCGACGCGAC-3’) and the psbB-specific primer psbB_cDNA_jn. The second PCR used the linker-specific nested primer RUMSH2 (5’ ACCGACGCGACAAGCTAATGC-3’) and the primer psbB_5prime_jn (5’-GGAAAGGGATTTTAGGCATACCAATCG-3’). PCR products (30 μl of PCR solution) were run on 1% agarose gels (w/v) and, prior to sequencing, cloned into pCR®2.1-TOPO® (Invitrogen).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll numerical results are reported as mean ±SD. Statistical significance of the difference between experimental groups was analyzed by unpaired t-test using GraphPad Prism software. Differences were considered statistically significant for P < 0.05 or P < 0.01. Northern/western blots and run-on analyses were repeated at least twice.

It appeared that the photosynthetic apparatus of Oenothera AB-I plants suffers from light-dependent damage. When plants were grown under three different light intensities (300, 450 and 600 μE m-2 s-1), no damage to the photosynthetic apparatus of AB-I occurred at 300 μE m-2 s-1 (see below). At 600 μE m-2 s-1, however, destruction of the photosynthetic apparatus was already so massive that it precluded a detailed photosynthetic characterization. We, therefore, characterized compatible AB-II and incompatible AB-I plants grown at 300 and 450 μE m-2 s-1, designated as low light (LL) and high light (HL), respectively, where pronounced differences were observed. Under LL, function and composition of the photosynthetic apparatus were indistinguishable between AB-II and AB-I. As judged from photosynthetic complex quantification by difference absorbance measurements normalized to a leaf area basis, the contents of photosystem II (PSII), cytochrome b6f complex (Cytb6f), the mobile redox carrier plastocyanin (PC) and photosystem I (PSI) were indistinguishable between the genotypes (Fig. 2b). Also, the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII in the dark-adapted state (FV/FM) was identical (0.79), clearly showing that no photoinhibition of PSII occurred under these conditions. The same was true for the total chlorophyll content per leaf area (Supplementary Fig. 1a). By contrast, the increase in light intensity to 450 μE m-2 s-1 resulted in drastic changes in photosynthetic complex accumulation, FV/FM and chlorophyll content in the two genotypes. AB-II plants responded to the increased growth light intensity by strongly increasing their chlorophyll content and the contents of all redox-active components of the electron transport chain, ranging from a more than two-fold increase of PSII content to a 50% increase in PSI content (Fig. 2b). These increases represent the typical light acclimation response that occurs when plants previously grown under light-limited conditions are transferred to a higher light intensities1. AB-I plants were incapable of performing this light acclimation response efficiently. Their PSII content increased only by 40%, and the strong decrease in FV/FM suggested that a substantial number of PSII centers were photodamaged. Also, contents of Cytb6f complex and PC increased to a much lesser degree than in AB-II, and PSI content remained essentially unaltered (Fig. 2b). In line with these observations, the chlorophyll content per leaf area increased only by 25% in AB-I (Supplementary Fig. 1a).\n\nTo assess possible consequences of these different light acclimation responses of AB-II and AB-I on the relative antenna cross sections of the two photosystems, chlorophyll-a fluorescence emission spectra at 77K were recorded (Supplementary Fig. 1b). For better comparability, the spectra were normalized to the PSII emission maximum at 687 nm wavelength. At 300 μE m-2 s-1, AB-II had a higher PSI emission signal than AB-I, in line with its slightly higher ratio of PSI to PSII. With increasing light intensity, the photosystem I/light harvesting complex I (PSI-LHCI) emission signal, peaking at 733 nm wavelength, decreased in both AB-II and AB-I, well in line with the more pronounced increase in PSII content in both genotypes. No indications for the presence of free, uncoupled light-harvesting complex I (LHCI) or light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) were observed. These would be expected to result in additional emission signals at 680 nm wavelength (indicative of free LHCII), or between 705 and 730 nm wavelength (indicative of the presence of uncoupled LHCI)2–4. Therefore, the decreased FV/FM ratio of AB-I at 450 μE m-2 s-1 (Fig. 2b) cannot be explained by the presence of uncoupled antenna, but has to be attributed to photoinhibition of the PSII reaction centers themselves.\n\nFinally, chloroplast ATP synthase (ATPase) activity and accumulation were assessed (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). Dark-interval relaxation kinetics of the electrochromic shift, a measure for the proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane, were used to determine the thylakoid conductivity for protons (gH+). The latter, in turn, is a proxy for ATPase activity5,6. Interestingly, as judged from western blot analyses of the AtpA protein, a core subunit of the ATP synthase complex, a slight reduction of ATP synthase content might be present in AB-I plants, at least under low light conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1d). This, however, did not lead to significant differences in ATP synthase activity between the genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Moreover, we did not observe significant differences between the growth light intensities. In this context, it should be mentioned that, in contrast to the complex quantifications expressed on a leaf area basis, gH+ is a measure for ATP synthase activity per thylakoid membrane and not per leaf area. Hence, since chlorophyll content increased with light intensity, it is likely that also total ATP synthase activity per leaf area was higher in plants grown at 450 μE m-2 s-1 compared to plants grown at 300 μE m-2 s-1. Nonetheless, this effect is independent of the compatible/incompatible situation of AB-II/AB-I plants.\n\nIn summary, AB-I plants display a light-dependent photosynthesis phenotype that cannot be attributed to a single component of the electron transport chain. However, the phenotype is independent of ATP synthase and PC function.\n\nNorthern blot analyses of psbB operon transcripts\n\nTranscript analysis of the psbB operon showed a clear decrease in mRNA accumulation in AB-I plants under HL conditions, whereas no differences were detected for AB-I plants in LL (Supplementary Fig. 2a,c). Upon hybridization with a psbB probe, four major psbB-containing transcript species were detected. The pentacistronic psbB-psbT-psbH-petB-petD transcript (5.6 kb with the introns of petB and petD, and 3.9 kb without these introns), the tricistronic psbB-psbT-psbH transcript (2.6 kb) and the dicistronic mature psbB-psbT transcript (1.8 kb). For details on the maturation of the psbB operon, see Westhoff and Herrman (1988)7. Surprisingly, a processing defect was detected in AB-I plants under HL conditions in that the AB-I plants lack the 3.9 kb transcript with the petB and petD introns spliced out (Supplementary Fig. 2c, boxed in red). The same transcript species were detected when blots were hybridized to a psbT probe. Hybridization to a psbH probe revealed a down-regulation of all psbH transcripts. Similarly to hybridization with the psbB probe, virtual absence of the 3.9 kb transcripts was observed. For both petB and petD, a decrease of polycistronic and monocistronic transcripts was observed. Both petB and petD mRNAs appear to accumulate to higher levels in AB-I at LL. Again, absence of the 3.9 kb transcript speceis was confirmed.\n\nIn summary, the data show that expression of the entire psbB operon is affected by the deletion. In the absence of any polymorphism between plastome I and II in the whole operon (Supplementary Dataset 1-3), the observed processing defect is likely to be a secondary consequence of the deletion. The precise molecular mechanism underlying this effect is currently unknown.\n\nSupplementary Figures and Tables\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nWe thank Werner Dietrich and Wilfried Stubbe, who compiled the comprehensive Oenothera collection that allowed us to use the original material of the Renner school and Ralph E.
