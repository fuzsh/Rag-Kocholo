        "text": "introduction\n\nDo something wonderful, people may imitate it.\n\n—ALBERT SCHWEITZER\n\nWhere does creativity come from? Neurologists, artists, and many others have offered plenty of answers to that question, but I think we are born with the seeds of creativity within us. It’s up to us to discover, develop, and defend our gifts and prove that we deserve them. As a very young man, coming of age during the social and economic upheavals that rocked post-World War II Germany, I had to make some difficult but necessary choices about how I would defend and develop my own creative gift—choices that began with a painful family rift and led to a rich and satisfying career as a designer, entrepreneur, innovator, global business strategist, and educator. Making those choices, I stepped over the fine line that sometimes separates creativity from comfort to found my own firm, frog design, which stands today as one of the world’s innovation leaders. This book explores the adventure that followed, as I learned to navigate and then chart new waters in collaborative business design. I’ve written this book as a guide to that process, with the goal of encouraging business leaders and designers to join forces in building creative strategies for a more profitable and sustainable future.\n\nAs the most successful companies and brands know, design isn’t just about making something look good. Design enables a company to invent and project innovative concepts that enhance human interactions and experiences. And, when we design a new and better object or a more inspiring human experience, the design itself becomes a branding symbol. People recognize visual symbols as cultural expression, and we embrace those symbols that reflect our deeper values, such as a delight in simple, elegant usability. In essence, design humanizes technology and helps businesses appeal to the human spirit. And it is the cultural context of design that roots business in history and connects it to a more profound future.\n\nI have been successful in life because I understood very early on that business needs creativity like humans need oxygen, and I was able to convince my clients that they needed to breathe in order to flourish. It hasn’t been easy. In the beginning I knew that, as both a consumer and a designer, I wanted technical products that were designed to connect with people on an emotional level, an idea I would later sum up as emotional design. Those kinds of products weren’t being manufactured in my native homeland, Germany, nor in many other places back in the 1960s when I started my company. Forty years later, frog design has had an impact on manufacturing and service industry offerings around the world, and the design-driven strategies of global brands such as Sony, Apple, Microsoft, SAP, Motorola, HP, and GE carry the frog DNA.\n\nI am fortunate to have spent my professional life creating successful design-driven strategies with these dynamic corporations. Having learned firsthand how truly great business leaders partner with designers, I have developed a step-by-step innovation process that leverages the power of that partnership. That process is at the heart of the collaborative model of innovation-driven business design that I’ve outlined in this book. Each chapter details a critical phase of the successful innovation-driven business strategy, illustrated with ideas, strategies, and stories aimed at informing designers and business leaders, alike.\n\nFirst, we’ll examine the role of design in the rapidly developing creative economy and how savvy business leaders cultivate a culture of innovation within their organizations. With the buy-in from management in place, we’ll tackle the real challenges and rewards of forming winning business design strategies before making plans for their tactical implementation. Next, we’ll walk through a step-by-step overview of the innovation process, from targeting goals to successfully shepherding innovations to market, and then take an in-depth look at the tools of innovation and the sometimes counterintuitive process of following a highly technical path to arrive at an intensely human experience. We’ll explore the growing and urgent demand for business strategies based on environmental sustainability, and the role of those strategies in the future of a thriving, lasting global economy. From developing early stage solutions for green consumer products and experiences to adopting global collaborative design processes, the examples of frog’s successful design-driven innovations discussed in this book offer critical insights into the process of crafting business models that can establish a foothold in the new, green economy. Finally, we’ll take a long look at the future of manufacturing and how businesses can transform the cheap, cheaper, toxic model of production outsourcing into one of mutually beneficial economic and industrial collaboration. Together, these chapters form a working guide to the process of infusing any business with the creative energy of design-driven innovation.\n\nThroughout this book, I’ve woven bits and pieces of my personal and professional history. I’ve included these stories, in part, to offer an insider’s look at the creative life. More importantly, however, I wanted to give readers a rare opportunity to sit around the planning desk with some of the world-class business leaders I’ve worked with during my career—some of the brightest business minds of our age, including Dieter Motte, Akio Morita, and Norio Ohga of Sony, Henri Racamier of Louis Vuitton, Hasso Plattner of SAP, and yes, Steve Jobs of Apple.\n\nToday, the business world is going through a period of profound and massive change that goes far deeper than falling stock markets and drops in consumer spending. The markets of efficiency—based on a ruthless quest for lower costs, no matter the social, environmental, or economic damage—are giving way to a new, creative economy. Customization and niche markets are eroding the demand for mass-produced commodities, and businesses are looking for ways to connect with their customers on an emotional level. Environmental sustainability, once ignored by many businesses, has become the new mantra for any enterprise looking for a secure foothold in 21st century markets. Around the world, business leaders are turning to designers to help create a strategy that will define their brand, by appealing to consumers’ emotions, providing rewarding consumer experiences, and building an environmentally responsible approach to doing business.\n\nIn the end, the business-design partnership advances our industrial culture by providing sustainable innovation, cultural identity, and economic consistency. But to accomplish that goal, design must cross the line that separates commercial-functional benchmarks from cultural relevance and spirituality. This book examines that fine line as it courses through our material culture, distinguishing great from good, creative strategies from imitative acts, and excellence from also-ran mediocrity.\n\nIn my experience, true success comes for the designer and the business executive when the two can bridge the artificial lines that too often have separated their worlds. This book also talks about building that bridge—about how creative minds and business minds collaborate, and how both sides of the business-design partnership can prosper within that process. I won’t say that this collaboration is a silver bullet for every problem facing a company, but I do believe it is the best way to develop a better business today and to build a sustainable future for that business. I’ve written this book to promote and inspire a new business reality. The stories and ideas in these pages offer proof that the cultural, humanistic, and economic power of creative design is better for the bottom line, better for business, and better for our planet as a whole.\n\n1\n\ndesign-driven strategy staking a claim in the creative economy\n\nTo be is to do.\n\n—IMMANUEL KANT\n\nIt’s a big leap for a creative consulting company to grow from its roots in a tiny garage in Germany’s Black Forest to a position of influence with esteemed global franchises, but I see the story of that transition as just one example of the incredible power of the business/design alliance. Today, there’s much talk about the new power of this alliance, but the power of design-driven business strategy isn’t a new idea at all. It’s the idea that spurred me to start my own design firm in 1969, and it’s what drove Steve Jobs to hire my firm to join him in building such a strategy for his own company. What’s new is the rapidly growing recognition of this power and the need for cultivating it. A first step toward achieving that goal is a firm understanding of the vital role of design in shaping an innovation-driven business model.\n\nWhen I founded my design firm, my goals were simple, yet powerful: to redefine design as a strategic profession, and to continually promote its relevance to industry and business. I wanted to create technical products that consumers could love for their beauty and their usefulness. And I wanted all designers, including myself, to be masters of our own destiny, not just hired hands brought in to put a shining new face on the same, tired old ideas. I was determined to bring my ideas to the world—and I felt as though every moment of my life had been spent in preparation for that opportunity.\n\nBecause I grew up in war-torn Germany, a country still coming to grips with the atrocities of the Third Reich, my aesthetic and my ideologies could not help but be informed by the changing world around me. I was born on June 5, 1944, in Beuren, a tiny village buried deep in Germany’s Black Forest. The only adult men under the age of sixty in my village were French soldiers who had occupied the area—all of our fathers and older brothers had died in the war or were being held in POW camps. Too young to really understand the concept of war, we children always tried to listen to adults when they spoke in hushed tones about the bombings and Stalingrad, but none of it made much sense to us. No one spoke of the Nazi terror or the Third Reich—not even my extended family, which, as I learned many years later, had lost seven of its own members to the concentration camps.\n\nWhen our men eventually did come home from the camps—my father, Johannes Heinrich Esslinger, among them—they were strangers to us. These silent, brooding men spoke little about the war or their experiences in it, but their bursts of rage and violence could be triggered by the merest childhood prank and often ended in beatings for us children. Sometimes, we guiltily found ourselves envying friends who had lost their fathers and were treated that much better by their grieving mothers. Years later, a group of American officers came to my school and showed us students a documentary film about the war, some of the footage shot by the Nazis themselves and some taken by the Allies as they liberated the concentration camps. As I grasped the reality of what had unfolded in my country during the war, I was enveloped in shame, sadness, and fury, and a new understanding of the bitter forces that had shaped my father and his fellow soldiers. Never again, Fascism! I thought to myself. Better to be a rebellious outcast than a blindly obedient servant.\n\nYet even in these dark, uncertain early years, my youth was influenced by beauty as well as war. As Germany began to rebuild its industrial infrastructure after the war, my parents started a small business in textiles and, on my tenth birthday, we moved to the small town of Altensteig. There my parents bought a live-in commercial space downtown, where they opened a clothing store. That move brought aesthetics into my life on a daily basis. I was surrounded by nice clothes, the latest fashion magazines, and visiting fashion shows, not to mention an ever-changing parade of attractive and exotic fashion models.\n\nBy the time I entered high school, my creative drive had emerged. Whenever I saw a car—still an oddity in my small village—I drew it, and eventually filled countless notebooks with sketches of cars, motorcycles, and ships, all of my own design. My mother, seeing the drawings as a waste of time and a warning sign of future social decline, burned my sketchbooks, declaring All artists end up in the gutter, as I watched the bright pages of my notebooks curl up and turn to ash in the family hearth. After high school, I joined the German army and then entered school to train as an engineer, but even my commanders and professors understood that my creative energies and interests were driving me toward a different future than their training could provide. Eventually, I was forced to choose between my parents’ goals for my life and my own. I chose to pursue a life in design.\n\nI entered the College of Design in Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany (today one of the world’s top-ten design schools), and there, on a summer night in 1968, my life changed. I had gathered that evening with my fellow students to compete in a design contest sponsored by the Kienzle Clock Company. My entry was a proposal for a radio watch capable of displaying the radio signal from the atomic clock in Braunschweig, and I had great hopes of winning the first-place prize money. But the jurors—including Kienzle’s chief designer—viciously criticized all of the student designs as being unrealistic and refused to grant the first-place prize to any of us. One of the jurors even picked up some of the models, shook them in the air, then threw the pieces on the ground. (Today, of course, radio watches are an industry standard. My unrealistic concept became a product for the German watchmaker Junghans; the watch is still considered to be the most accurate commercially available clock in the world.)\n\nThis short-sighted, quick rejection offered me a much greater incentive to succeed as a designer than any trophy or prize money would have done. On the drive home that night, I swore that I would change the world of design by transforming its stuffy, hierarchical limits into something more dynamic, where anything is possible. I determined that the only way to liberate myself from the unimaginative and outmoded design model imposed by the Kienzle Clock Companies of the world was to start my own business. It was the most optimistic and radical step I could ever take.\n\n° the business of design\n\nAnd so, in 1969, while still a student, I started esslinger design—the firm that would become frog. The first goal I set for myself was to achieve economic success. I refused to accept the role of the starving artist. Besides, I was certain that the design process was too important to be ignored by companies looking to gain a strong competitive advantage, and I knew there were business leaders out there who would value the profession as much as I did. The rest of the plan was simple but ambitious, and I wrote it down in six steps:\n\n1. Look for hungry clients who want to go to the top;\n\n2. Be business-minded and do great work for my clients, not for myself;\n\n3. Get famous—not as an egotistic artist, but as a visionary;\n\n4. Use that fame as working capital to build the company;\n\n5. Build the best global design company ever; and\n\n6. Always look for the best people—as employees, partners, and clients.\n\nAfter two years, Andreas Haug and Georg Spreng joined me as my first partners. One day we were sitting around our coffee table, and Andreas asked, What are our plans for the future? To have an esslinger-designed product in each of the major shopping centers on earth, I shot back. Everybody laughed, but seven years later my seemingly grandiose plan had become a reality.\n\nMy first step toward that goal came soon. I had always been interested in electronics—as an amateur jazz and rock musician I had built my own amplifiers from mail-order components. I also was very fond of a small consumer electronics brand called Wega, a company that had been founded in the 1920s. When my first diploma semester came up in 1968, my project of choice was to design a portable radio with speakers that folded in for compact storage, but provided true stereo sound when opened out. While working on this design, I heard rumors that Wega’s owner and CEO, Dieter Motte, was looking for a new signature designer. So I called him and asked for an interview. He was an extremely nice man, and a total design fanatic, with the strategic goal of positioning Wega as a design brand with an appeal that extended beyond the elitists. He liked my work and admired my engineering background, and so he offered me an internship. But that wasn’t what I was shooting for.\n\nShortly after our meeting, I read that the German federal government had announced the first Bundespreis Gute Form (Federal Design Award), to be awarded in 1969. With an updated version of my diploma project, I won the student award, a huge coup for any young designer. The ceremony was held in Berlin as part of the German Industrial Fair, and I was presented my award by Germany’s Secretary of Finance and Trade Karl Schiller. As it happened, Dieter Motte also was in the audience, and after the ceremony he came to me and simply said . . . sorry that I underestimated you, but we have to work together! These words launched a great relationship, and my professional career.\n\nWorking out of the garage of a rented house, I came up with the concept for our first big initiative—Wega’s System 3000, which combined a television set with high-end stereo components. Taking advantage of innovations in plastics manufacturing, our design pioneered the use of plastic-bodied stereo components with foam-encased electronic elements. The results were far more aesthetically pleasing, functional, modern, and pounds lighter than the traditional wood and plywood-encased stereos that dominated the market at that time. I designed the System 3000 like a sculpture, so that it looked great from every angle (its surface texture of graduated, embossed dots served as the inspiration for this book’s cover design).\n\nWe introduced our prototype at the Consumer Electronics Show in Berlin in 1971. After the show, the System 3000 took off and I was flooded with new work from Wega and from other clients, both large and small. In 1973, Dieter Motte’s family began looking for a buyer, and so I accepted an offer from Sony in November of that year. Then, in January of 1974, Sony bought the"
