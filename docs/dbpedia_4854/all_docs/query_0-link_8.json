I cannot recommend their services highly enough.\n\nWe have had the opportunity to repeatedly cooperate with the law firm TAUBEL LEGAL over many years. Whether in the field of commercial or labour law, we have been completely satisfied each and every time with the level of service provided. Promptness, reliability, and flexibility in finding the best solution are always a standard part of the service.\n\nWe have been using the services of the law firm TAUBEL LEGAL for almost a year and we greatly appreciate their flexibility and pro-active approach. Their emphasis on detail and a business-like way of thinking are very important to us.\n\nWe have been working with the law firm TAUBEL LEGAL since 2011. For the entire length of our collaboration they have provided valuable support in legal issues. During this time we have had the opportunity to cooperate in various fields (labour law, mergers and acquisitions, tenders, administration of claims etc.). We have always been very satisfied with the quality of services provided. We appreciate in particular their flexible approach, discretion, expertise and reliability. I can warmly recommend the services of the law firm TAUBEL LEGAL.\n\nThe law firm TAUBEL LEGAL has provided our company with complex legal consultancy since its establishment.

We are utterly satisfied with our collaboration. The services provided are prompt, professional and each time very precise. The attorneys really understand their job. I would warmly recommend the services of the law firm TAUBEL LEGAL to anyone interested in quality legal representation.\n\nOur company has been using the services of the law firm TAUBEL LEGAL for a long time.

It is a modern law firm with a dynamic team, which always tries to think a few steps ahead with an overlap into situations that donâ€™t even occur to you as a client. The current business environment is so fast and complicated that we could not get by without quality legal support. Their expert advice as well as their professional and complex approach allows us to focus on the prosperity of our company.\n\nThe members of the TAUBEL LEGAL team have an outstanding knowledge of law and a highly professional approach.

Working with TAUBEL LEGAL is not only beneficial to us in business and legal terms, but also pleasant.

The team comes up with proposals and ideas for solutions to business situations that give us a new perspective on the given issue and broaden our options in order to make progress in legal issues. Thanks to their approach we consider them to be more a part of our team rather than simply an external supplier.\n\nAs a public benefit organisation, we have specialised legal obligations to fulfil and have to rely on the advice and support of our legal advisers to ensure we comply. TAUBEL LEGAL has been extremely helpful - not only do they understand the legislation thoroughly; their excellent English means that they can explain it clearly to us non-fluent Czech speakers. To be able to explain often highly technical, obscure legal procedures in oneâ€™s second language, so that a non-legal expert can understand them, is indeed a great skill. And just as importantly, their unfailing meeting of deadlines is something that we, as probably one of TAUBEL LEGAL smaller clients, greatly appreciate.\n\nI have cooperated with the law firm TAUBEL LEGAL on several transactions and I particularly value their professional approach and commitment to work. Aside from JUDr. TÃ¤ubelâ€™s legal and negotiation skills, I also value his ability from a commercial standpoint.\n\nWe have been cooperating with the law firm TAUBEL LEGAL for eight years. During this relatively long period they have dealt with a number of projects and cases for us (for instance in the fields of M&A, real estate, contractual and contentious matters), always with a maximum professionalism and helpfulness.\n\nWe consulted TAUBEL LEGAL on questions regarding GDPR. I particularly value how quickly they grasped all the specifics of our business as an HR agency and we received recommendations which were decidedly tailor-made for us. Thanks to their pro-client approach we had everything we needed in as short a time as possible.\n\nJUDr. Jan TÃ¤ubel, LL.M. is an attorney and the founding partner of TAUBEL LEGAL.
