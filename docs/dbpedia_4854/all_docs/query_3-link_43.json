        "text": "The Juliska Stadium was opened in Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic, in 1960. Having undergone extensive alterations in 1975, the stadium now holds around 18,800 spectators with seating for 8,150, some sections of which are covered. The sports facility has a 105 x 68 metre real grass playing field surrounded by a tartan track, which makes it suitable for football as well as track and field athletics.\n\nThe ageing running track was fully refurbished by Polytan between July and September 2018. The original synthetic surface, Polytan PUR, was nearly 20 years old. Rekortan PUR, a water-impermeable, multi-layer poured in-situ system also made by Polytan, was chosen as the new retopping system. This high-speed sports surface offers very fast acceleration combined with optimum shock absorption properties, making it the ideal base for personal bests, new records and international elite sport. The tartan track was certified for this purpose by the IAAF after being refurbished. The Capri blue outside section does not need to meet the requirements of runners, so it was fitted with the hard-wearing PolyPlay SE all-round surface from Polytan.\n\nNot only does the refurbished tartan track in Juliska Stadium have a surface which is ideally suited to running shoes with spikes thanks to its new inter-spersed granules, it has also been laid in some gleaming new colours. As well as the conventional brick red circular track, the two D-shaped inside sections were installed in a glowing rosé colour and the outer circumference in a bright Capri blue at the client’s request. Rosé and Capri blue are among the 24 standard colours of Polytan.\n\nJuliska Stadium was the first stadium in the Czech Republic to have Polytan SmarTracks installed. Incidentally, it wasn’t just the running track that benefited from the sophisticated technology in Prague – so did the pole vault area, which now offers optimal training conditions as a result."
