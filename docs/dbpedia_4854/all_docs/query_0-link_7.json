I keep hearing people on TV say how amazing the economy is, but I see a much more mixed bag.\\n\\nAnd the bull market could indeed continue for a year or more. But we are almost certainly in the very late innings of this credit cycle. And the overall economy looks ill.\\n\\nHere’s a chart showing U.S. corporate debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). The higher the percentage is, the more debt companies have. As you can see, this ratio peaked at the end of the last Fed-blown bubbles in 2001 and 2009, which both resulted in major stock market pullbacks (and rare chances to buy stocks cheaply). <image> (Chart - Nonfinancial Corporate Debt as a Percentage of GDP Exceeds Prior Peak) We’re about due for a pullback. In fact, we’re late in the game.\\n\\nDebt is leverage. It adds risk. It pads the results for a while… then interest rates rise or the economy sputters. And then the interest payments really start to bite.\\n\\nMeanwhile, 61% of Americans couldn’t pay for an unexpected $1,000 expense. That’s according to a Bankrate poll cited by CNN.\\n\\nAs everyone knows, most medical issues likely cost well more than $1,000. So do a lot of other common, but unexpected, expenses.\\n\\nThis is why the Federal Reserve feels like it can’t raise interest rates. It would crash the economy in short order.\\n\\nSo where do we go from here? I think stocks could continue to go up for a while – primarily due to stock buybacks, which are also at all-time highs.\\n\\nA buyback is when a company buys back its own shares in the open market and “retires” them, reducing the number of shares floating around. U.S. companies have already announced $1 trillion in buybacks for 2019. <image> (Chart - Record Buybacks) Like any other tool, buybacks can be used responsibly or irresponsibly. One could argue that companies are being a little too aggressive with their buybacks at this point in the cycle, but companies gobbling up their own shares could certainly keep the market going for a while.\\n\\nUncertainty in bond markets isn’t hurting stocks either. Many people prefer stocks over bonds due to expected inflation or uncertainty about the underlying currency of the bond.\\n\\nBut stocks aren’t cheap here. Especially because we’re this late in the cycle.\\n\\nI don’t claim to know exactly when we’ll peak, but I do know that in bear markets you often get a chance to buy former momentum stocks for 60% off.\\n\\nSo I’ll continue to avoid domestic stocks for the most part (aside from cannabis and tech). I’ll keep investing in disruptive U.S. startups, of course. The U.S. corporate landscape needs a reboot, and startups are going to be the ones to do it (as always).\\n\\nOutside of that, I’m buying emerging market stocks. Lately I’ve been looking into India and Malaysia. There’s a whole fascinating world of global stocks out there. And I think having exposure to it is more important than ever.\" } ]\n\nobelics_100k_multi\n\nobelics_4999\n\n[ { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"f13a9af20350e4d47c2881f5f28846332f9974e86dd1713ab478b3305293f107.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"33f44d545eef83ff47f5f684fa597f3358953357d71ed81faa352d5a32d67b2b.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"73f79695a8a479535445139df9d8e237dcb9e56fbd6950f94a61d447951d015f.jpg\" } ]\n\n[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": null }, { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The Royal Enfield boasts the longest continuous production run of any current motorcycle manufacturer, stretching back to 1901 and manufactured exclusively in India since 1967.

Payne. Set in the Australian outback and filled with gorgeous widescreen vistas, it’s a quiet coming of age story and one that is subversively sensual.\\n\\nDeparting immediately from the source novel which begins with a plane crash, Nicolas Roeg’s film, from an Edward Bond screenplay, begins with a father who commits suicide and leaves his children, sixteen-year-old Mary (Jenny Agutter, Call the Midwife, Logan’s Run) and her younger six-year-old brother Peter (Roeg’s son Luc Roeg) stranded in the oppressive heat of the Australian outback. Mary decides to leave the scene with her brother and start walking through the bush to find a town, but things don’t go too well for the siblings. They are soon facing starvation, exhaustion, and dehydration. They are only saved when they happen to cross paths with an Aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil, The Leftovers, Cargo) who is on ‘walkabout’ – a traditional ceremony where a boy must leave his village when he comes of age and go out into the wilderness and live off of the land. He teaches Mary and her brother how to survive as Mary, Peter, and the Boy begin to develop a rapport.\\n\\nThere’s an underlying sexual tension that remains unspoken between Mary and the Aboriginal boy, whose name we never really learn since he continues to speak in his dialect, and communication between the three is strained but becomes easier as the film goes on. That is until the growing sexual awakening in the two teenagers – as is often the case at that age – gets in the way and complicates cultural misunderstandings even further, leading to tragic consequences. <image> (Jenny Agutter in Walkabout (1971)) Was Roeg making a statement with Walkabout? In 1971 when he was making this film Australia was basically an apartheid state and would remain as such right up to around 1980. The idea of a white English girl and a black Aboriginal boy having an unspoken sexual attraction to each other and swimming together naked must have been shocking both in Australia and in the United States where the film also screened and where Jim Crow, redlining, and other racial issues were (and are) still a considerable social issue. Roeg’s film manages to engage these subjects without ever having to overtly mention anything that’s going on. As writing professors will often say, it is better to show than to say, and Roeg shows with an unmatched potency and sensuality.\\n\\nRoeg also shows the splendor of the Australian outback. Whether it’s the danger of a scorpion about to bite or the brilliant orange sun setting on the dry horizon, we are given a beautiful look at the sun-soaked land down under. His camera transports us to the desert with lots of wide lens deep focus shots, long lens close-ups, a virtual film class on how to shoot nature. The result is nature as a metaphor for the underlying sensuality and sexual awakening of the two older kids and the wide-eyed wonderment of young Peter.\\n\\nWalkabout is a film that is full of surprises and watchable on many different levels. Young Jenny Agutter and David Gulpilil have incredible chemistry together on the screen while the young Luc Roeg is am charming young lad. This one is a film that should be on the radar of all cinephiles.\\n\\nThe film was shot on a medium speed 35mm Eastman 100T 5254 film stock and arrives in a new 4K restoration on Blu-ray in a 1.85:1 AVC 1080p encodement from Second Sight Films. The last Blu-ray release in the US was from Criterion Collection in 2010 as far as I know, so this UK release is a very welcome addition and it looks absolutely stunning. The imagery, colors, and textures of the Australian outback absolutely ‘pop’ in this transfer. The grain structure is fine through most of the film, though due to the film speed and lighting we do see some frames where the grain coarsens, but never tilts over into noise. In short, this is a fantastic, filmic transfer rich in color and detail, free from noise and edge enhancement. I would also add that, if ever a classic film was in need of a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release, this is one.\\n\\nThe original mono audio mix for Walkabout is included in LPCM 1.0. It is a strong presentation of what is an inherently limited format. Dynamics are narrow, but the sound effects and dialogue are clear and there is little hiss or clipping.\\n\\nThis release is packed with superb bonus content. The limited-edition comes with lots of collectibles including the original source novel with exclusive cover artwork, and a softcover book with a facsimile of the original First Draft Script, and more. On-disc there are lots of new interviews with the cast, and an excellent audio commentary that features Luc Roeg, who starred in the film, and David Thompson.\\n\\nA fantastic restoration from Second Sight of this 1971 classic, packed with bonus features and collectibles. If you’ve never seen this film, then what are you waiting for? Pick up this UK release ASAP.

One is a sector of workers whose health and well-being rely on a workplace-specific set of sexual safety measures -- ones that work. Next, at the heart of Prop 60's campaign, is a sex-negative HIV organization run by \\\"the most hated man in the [AIDS] business.\\\" And finally, a proposition that formalizes the online harassment of sex workers -- allowing online trolls to be digital vigilantes, granting them the power to punish sex workers by fining and outing them.\\n\\nIn a statement from the Free Speech Coalition, Chief Executive Diane Duke said, \\\"If the proposed initiative were to pass, adult performers would immediately be targeted by stalkers and profiteers, who would use the initiatives' sue-a-performer provision to harass and extort adult performers.\\\" She added:, \\\"This is an unconscionable initiative that would take a legal and safe industry and push its performers into the shadows.\\\" <image> (cyber sex depicted by woman removing underwear in front of computer) California law already requires adult film productions to follow its blood-borne-pathogen standards. In addition, in accordance with the adult industry's program for sexual wellness, actors are required to provide clean HIV and STD test results every 14 days (at their own expense; average test cost is around $200). Actors without verified test results are not allowed to work.\\n\\nAdult performers have united against Prop 60, but AHF and Weinstein aren't interested in what they have to say. On several occasions, porn-industry groups have attempted to publicly speak with or debate Weinstein about condoms on the set and Prop 60, only to be avoided at every turn.\\n\\nSan Francisco Board of Supervisors member Scott Weiner said in a Medium op-ed, \\\"This ballot measure, of course, isn't about public health, since it won't have any public-health benefit. Rather, it's about a moralistic, ideological crusade that will do great damage to this California industry and to the health of its employees. It needs to be defeated.\\\"\\n\\nAs we pointed out in October, Prop 60 is set to be a litigation minefield. The way the initiative is written, any representation of actual sex is subject to the law, even if you don't see penetration. This means that not only are \\\"adult films\\\" themselves subject to lawsuits and fines, but includes any representation of that scene -- banner ads, still images, clips, even if they're just on blogs that write about it.\\n\\nThe list of organizations opposing Prop 60 is astonishing. Both the California Democratic and Republican parties formally oppose it, as does the California Libertarian Party. AIDS Project Los Angeles and the San Francisco AIDS Foundation hate it. The San Francisco Medical Society and the International Entertainment Adult Union both oppose it and fought in court to have their names removed as supporters when AHF wrongly listed them as formally endorsing the measure.\\n\\n\\\"The most hated man in the AIDS business\\\" <image> (Porn Film Condoms) None of the organizations opposing Prop 60 believe its mission is one of public health, which only adds to growing speculation about AHF's increasingly bizarre role on the global HIV-prevention stage. The New York Times last November called Weinstein \\\"the most hated man in the AIDS business.\\\"\\n\\nAnd make no mistake, AIDS is a big business. Nowhere is that more evident than in Weinstein and AHF's other war against PrEP (a method for preventing HIV) and the success of its key component, a new drug called Truvada.\\n\\nFrom the minute Truvada became available two years ago, AHF was the prevention drug's most vocal and misleading critic. Along with numerous ad campaigns claiming that Truvada didn't work, Weinstein derisively called it \\\"a party drug\\\" that people take to enjoy reckless sex. In contrast, the National Institutes of Health states Truvada is up to 99 percent effective in preventing HIV when taken daily.\\n\\nIf so, then he's one with a stunning amount of resources for promulgating that denial. The Los Angeles-based AHF is the world's largest AIDS nongovernmental organization (NGO), with more than 630,000 patients spanning 36 countries and a $1.3 billion budget.

Its carefully crafted eloquence and finesse continues to attract audiences. Mark Kilmurry’s current production is vibrant and funny with an appropriate underlying sadness throughout.\\n\\nHusband Victor Quinn is a masterful raconteur whose colourful past had its roots in the communist party, at one time greatly popular with intellectuals and philosophers. His transformation over the years brings him into the corporate world as a highly successful founder of an IT company. Despite this success and wealth, Victor has not lost his penchant for the less fortunate and vulnerable.\\n\\nSean Taylor gives a magnificent performance as Victor, charismatic and complex, brimming with the relentless ability to win an argument, which can lead Victor to play dangerous games. END_OF_DOCUMENT_TOKEN_TO_BE_REPLACED <image> (RICHARD III) With nods to both the legendary Olivier and the McKellan versions, this is an extraordinarily beautifully spoken version of Shakespeare’s play, but I am afraid it just falls short of the mark. You can certainly see what this production is attempting to achieve, however it still leaves us feeling a little emotionally uninvolved.\\n\\nThis is a pared back abridged version with cuts, and many of the cast playing several different characters as required throughout the play, which can be a little confusing.\\n\\nThis production, directed by and starring Mark Kilmurry, is framed as a dangerous act of theatre, in which six players gather in a dark, sparsely furnished bunker to perform Shakespeare’s Richard III. There is a sense of suspense, of wartime desolation, of destruction.\\n\\nBarely acknowledging each other upon flurried arrival, the cast set straight to work ,at first rehearsing short, key snippets of scenes, the sword fight in particular. Costumes, props and a set of benches, a table and dead TV sets have already been assembled. Kilmurry straps on a hump, picks up his gloves, assumes the now stereotypical gait and a clandestine performance begins, rather quietly and at a nervous pace.\\n\\nWhat then develops is a sturdy presentation of an abridged text, occasionally interrupted by the menacing sounds of barking dogs, loud bangs on the door (which is monitored via CCTV) and patrolling helicopters overhead, all adding intensity and suspense, in what is a highly stylised production.\\n\\nThe cast speak in a broad range of accents, that dip and change as characters and alliances change.\\n\\nThe abridgements work well, as do some deft touches of theatrical shorthand – taking glasses on and off to demonstrate a quick-change between multiple characters played by a single actor.\\n\\nSome key set piece moments do not really catch fire and we feel little for Clarence (Matt Edgerton) as he hurtles towards his death. Also the build up of circumstances towards Bosworth Field is rushed through and barely indicated.\\n\\nAs King Richard III, while beautifully spoken and with a very expressive face, Mark Kilmurry portrays him as shallow, calculating and manipulative rather than darkly villainous, and it is hard to care for him. The King’s wooing of Lady Anne is played straight and with plenty of feeling. This is in contrast with some of the set piece/famous monologues which did leave me unmoved.\\n\\nDanielle Carter of the exquisite alabaster skin was tremendous as Queen Elizabeth and Prince Edward. I liked the effect for the Princes in the Tower of having them in brightly striped, very posh school blazers and boaters, but it also in some ways made them look like a vaudeville act.\\n\\nPatrick Dickson as Buckingham gives a strong, splendid performance. Matt Edgerton is terrific in his many roles as assorted characters. Amy Mathews was most impressive.\\n\\nAt the finale, Kilmurry pauses for a tense, dangerous moment. He looks at the crown. He then drags on his coat. The ominous helicopter sounds increase in volume and appear to be coming much closer. He grabs a piece of chalk, defiantly writes the date, hurriedly scribbles ”Richard III” and vanishes out the door. They were there and this performance happened. We, the audience, were with them.\\n\\nRunning time – roughly 2 and a half hours including one interval.\\n\\n”RICHARD III” runs at the Ensemble until July 19 and then transfers to play at the Parramatta Riverside theatre between July 22 and 26 .\\n\\nAnna Crawford’s production of Alan Ayckbourn’s laconic comedy ‘My Wonderful Day’ is a well crafted and performed night at the theatre,\\n\\n‘My Wonderful Day’ features two black actors in leading roles. The scenario sees a nine year old black girl Winnie Barnstairs (Belinda Jombwe) take a day off school and accompany her heavily pregnant mum Laverne (Shareena Clanton) to work. Laverne is cleaning the house of a cantankerous television personality, Kevin Tate (Mark Owen-Taylor), Laverrne tells Winnie that she must be quiet and do her homework, which is to write her essay/journal that she entitles ‘My Wonderful Day’.\\n\\nLife in the Tate household is far from serene! Tate is a difficult man whose life is made more difficult by his BAFTA award winning wife Paula (Danielle Carter) having left him. His ditzy secretary Tiffany comes to his aid and things are more than a little chaotic.\\n\\nA sweet natured young girl, Winnie is also bright and astute, and as the day unfolds, with director Anna Crawford, (an Ensemble theatre director’s fellow), flashing the changing times on the back wall, Winnie witnesses the adults’ comical, and at times, irrational behaviour first hand. Winnie will never look at adults in quite the same way!\\n\\n‘My Wonderful Day’ runs straight through for ninety minutes without interval. Typical of Ayckbourn’s plays, as ‘dramatic’ as the action is, the playwright’s trademark one liners are interspersed through the play with lines such as ‘I married an angel/ I divorced a monster’, and the young Winnie with her ever present pen and exercise book is jokingly portrayed as a young Emily Bronte.\\n\\nThe roles are neatly played. Mark Owen-Taylor is well cast as the highly strung, comical Kevin Tate. As Paula, Danielle Carter makes a major impression in a scene where she discovers infidelity. Shareena Clanton gives a warm performance as the good natured, hard working Laverne and has a funny, chaotic scene where her waters break in the living room. Young actress Belinda Jombwe plays something of a leading role as Winnie who is trying to discreetly fathom what’s happening. Belinda’s timing is first class. Matilda Ridgeway gives a typically assured performance as the ‘accomodating’ secretary. Brian Meegan plays Kevin’s gregarious mate who tries everything to protect him.\" } ]\n\nobelics_100k_multi\n\nobelics_4999\n\n[ { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"45c103e414eb442fe13ddc58eacaf200c6a51a4833602a3059262c4abbe8f147.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"ab9db896e633c0c409a8192fd6b43944e61c2773f27a39ca7564a977d6d47d94.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"a7668c1bee5fa0371e37a55841114875d09cfa1dfc9ea0b1d754e222f971d3f1.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"d624421142602ff5f3c6e76b299c6cba631b67bc7931b1edd39b961f8239def8.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"95c0ed22042b4206fb700b47dcf375551ce9a1d7d0ba51d557effa4b6ec509c2.jpg\" } ]\n\n[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": null }, { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Czechs top toy exporters in Europe, thanks to LEGO\\n\\nThe Czech Republic is Europe’s top toy distributor, exporting more than 50 billion crowns now annually, according to a new study by UniCredit bank. LEGO, Playmobil and similar plastic toy sets account for two-thirds of that, though the country is also churning out various miniature sets and dolls. Along with neighbouring Slovakia, the Czech Republic has been the fastest-growing toy exporter in the EU since 2004. I asked UniCredit bank senior economist Patrik Rožumberský how and when this country became the top exporter. <image> (Patrik Rožumberský, photo: archive of Patrik Rožumberský) Patrik Rožumberský, photo: archive of Patrik Rožumberský “The Czech Republic took over this lead position in the European market in terms of exports of toys from Germany in 2012, mainly because of a shift of production of Lego toys from Western countries, mainly from the home country of Lego Denmark.”\\n\\nEven without Lego, the Czechs would still be the second-biggest toy exporters in the EU. Do you have a rough breakdown of what percentage are Czech-made products and which are assembled here?\\n\\n“I don’t have the detailed figures, but in the structure of exports, I can say that especially construction sets, or toy blocks from plastics, and miniature models play the biggest role in total toy exports from the Czech Republic.”\\n\\nAnd those sets, those plastic kits that you mention, most of those parts are typically made somewhere else but then assembled, packaged, and distributed from the Czech Republic?\\n\\n“I think that most of these plastic toys come from Lego toys manufactured in the Czech Republic, and the lesser part are from toys which have their origin in this country.”\\n\\nThe UniCredit study says that only four EU countries export more toys than they import, and three of them are in central Europe – the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary – and the fourth is Malta. To your knowledge, does this stem from the relatively cheap labour costs here, from the relocation of companies such as Lego to this area, or is there an especially strong manufacturing or toy-making tradition? <image> (Photo: Alan Chia, CC BY-SA 2.0) Photo: Alan Chia, CC BY-SA 2.0 “I think it’s a combination of both – it’s about a tradition of toy manufacturing in central and eastern Europe and the resulting move of production from the Westerns countries.”\\n\\n“Maybe the most interesting thing to note is that the annual volume of exports per person [in the Czech Republic] amounted to almost 200 euros, so it’s in the second position after Malta, and quite a very good position.”\\n\\nSo, quite a significant part of the economy here – and do you see it growing, or has it reached a saturation point?\\n\\n“I think the market for toys seems to be quite saturated. We’ve seen the exports start to drop from the 2005 level, to be on the decline for the last one or two years.”\\n\\nAll EU countries are currently exporting more toys than in 2005, with the smallest increase, less than 5 percent, reported by Italy. On average, exports of toys have increased by 150 percent in EU countries since then. <image> (Photo: ČTK/Luboš Pavlíček) <image> (Photo: Martina Schneibergová) One of the many successful exhibitions marking the 100th anniversary of Czechoslovakia is Mini Wonders, which explores the evolution… <image> (Photo: Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague) A major exhibition of dolls’ houses from the Victoria &Albert Museum of Childhood in London is now on display in Prague.

Children in the Holocaust and its Aftermath: Historical and Psychological Studies of the Kestenberg Archive <image> The testimonies of individuals who survived the Holocaust as children pose distinct emotional and intellectual challenges for researchers: as now-adult interviewees recall profound childhood experiences of suffering and persecution, they also invoke their own historical awareness and memories of their postwar lives, requiring readers to follow simultaneous, disparate narratives. This interdisciplinary volume brings together historians, psychologists, and other scholars to explore child survivors accounts.

Beautiful Souls: The Courage and Conscience of Ordinary People in Extraordinary Times <image> \\\"A fascinating study in the better angels of our nature.\\\"George Packer, The New Yorker\\n\\nHistory has produced many specimens of the banality of evil, but what about its flip side, what impels ordinary people to defy the sway of authority and convention? Through these dramatic stories of unlikely resisters, Eyal Press' Beautiful Souls shows that the boldest acts of dissent are often carried out not only by radicals seeking to overthrow the system but also by true believers who cling with unusual fierceness to their convictions. Drawing on groundbreaking research by moral psychologists and neuroscientists, this deeply reported work of narrative journalism examines the choices and dilemmas we all face when our principles collide with the loyalties we harbor and the duties we are expected to fulfill. <image> Sophie Scholl, an ambitious student with hopes for a bright future, was found guilty of treason and executed during Adolf Hitler's reign in Germany.

Additional digital material provides readers with insight into the tumultuous time of Nazi Germany during World War II and the courage that compelled Scholl, her brother, and their friends to resist the regime.\\n\\n8. How Could You Do That?!: The Abdication of Character, Courage, and Conscience <image> How Could You Do That?! illustrates Dr. Laura Schlessinger's philosophy of personal responsibility through her usually provocative but always stimulating moral dialogues with callers about everyday ethical dilemmas.\\n\\nIn her lively pull-no-punches style, Dr. Laura takes on the moral dilemmas of our time: from the mindless pursuit of pleasure and immediate gratification to taking the easy way out when those actions produce ugly or uncomfortable life-altering consequences. She demonstrates in no uncertain terms that personal values are never someone else's reponsibility but your own, and why choosing not to honor them actually compounds unhappiness. Finally she explains that by disciplining self-indulgence and rising above temptation we can discover the infinite pleasures, the true happiness, of the moral high ground.\\n\\nDr. Laura delivers not only a compelling argument for an ethical approach to life but also an invaluable inspiration to rebuilding character, conscience, and courage. Here is a work that can make a genuine difference in the quality of your own life and the lives of those we love. <image> Henry David Thoreau was known for living simply, but his views and convictions were anything but.

The outbreak of what is now called Covid-19 represents more than just a passing moment of stress for the CPC. The world should be prepared for what could come next.\\n\\nNormally, a single epidemic, even if mishandled, would not break the Chinese regime. Over the past four decades, the CPC has weathered numerous crises, from the 1989 Tiananmen tragedy and the 2002-03 SARS epidemic to the 2008 global financial crisis.\\n\\nSome of the regime’s critics have long predicted its imminent demise, only to be proven wrong.\\n\\nBefore President Xi Jinping, the Chinese style of governance was adaptive and decentralised, or what I call “directed improvisation.” In addition, civil society, including muckraking journalism, expanded rapidly.\\n\\nThis time is different. Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has tightened political control at home and projected superpower ambitions abroad. These policies have unnerved Chinese private investors, alarmed Western powers, and sharpened tensions with the United States, all of which have contributed to a broader economic slowdown.\\n\\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has added an additional source of stress and unpredictability to the regime’s mounting challenges.\\n\\nAs the epidemic persists, China will struggle to reopen for business, bringing even stiffer economic headwinds as small- and medium-size enterprises fail, workers lose jobs, and inflation picks up. While the Chinese leadership is highly adept at solving one crisis at a time, it has rarely had to confront so many near-existential crises at once.\\n\\nIn a recent commentary, Kevin Rudd, a former Australian prime minister who is now president of The Asia Society, argued that “the crisis, once resolved, will not change how China is governed in the future.” But that prognosis is too optimistic. Indeed, cracks are already appearing in Xi’s supreme leadership.\\n\\nFor example, at the peak of the public outrage over the government’s initial cover-up of the outbreak, Xi disappeared from public view.\\n\\nAfter his meeting with the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Jan 28, he didn’t resurface until his state meeting with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on Feb 5.\\n\\nFor a leader who normally dominates China’s news cycle every day, Xi’s absence amid a national panic was conspicuous, and led some Chinese observers to speculate that his grip on power may be in peril.\\n\\nIf that seems unthinkable, it is worth remembering that the past years have produced events that few anticipated. Who predicted, for example, that an American real-estate mogul would face off with a Chinese princeling in an earth-shaking superpower rivalry, or that China might replace the United States as a champion for capitalist globalisation?\\n\\nThe current moment of precariousness could well give way to more profound political change.\\n\\nThree possibilities stand out. The most extreme, worst-case scenario is regime collapse. China-bashers who read that sentence should not gloat, because the sudden dissolution of an authoritarian regime does not necessarily lead to democratisation; in many cases, it leads to civil war, as we saw in Iraq after the United States forcibly removed Saddam Hussein and as we see today in post-Qaddafi Libya. A violent power struggle within China would be catastrophic for the entire world.\\n\\nFortunately, this scenario is unlikely. Although China is under unprecedented stress, its economy has not come to a standstill.\\n\\nAnd while tens of thousands of Chinese are infected with the virus and many more are furious at the government, the vast majority of the population is nowhere near desperation.\\n\\nThe second scenario is a change in leadership at the highest level. Xi cannot avoid blame for the backlash against his restrictive domestic policies and assertive actions abroad, which had already begun to undercut support for him even before the Covid-19 epidemic. With the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was rebuked by state authorities for warning others about the virus, the failings of Xi’s top-down approach have been laid bare.\\n\\nNews of Li’s passing unleashed a firestorm of online criticism of the government, and Xi’s failure to appear on the frontlines of the fight has further diminished his credibility as a populist leader.\\n\\nIn principle, Xi’s abolition of constitutional term limits allows him to stay on as president for life. But whether he actually will remain in office after his current term ends in 2022 is now an open question.\\n\\nOwing to the concentration of power in the Chinese system, the paramount leader has an outsize impact on all spheres of society, as well as foreign policy. If a new leader were to take over in 2022 – or even before then – the most likely outcome would be a reset of all of Xi’s policy priorities, forcing the rest of the world to revisit its thinking about China and its global role.\\n\\nIn the third scenario, Xi clings to his post, but it is hollowed out and power shifts over to various other competing factions. Such an arrangement would not be without precedent.\\n\\nAfter the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong’s fanatical campaign in 1958-62 to “catch up with Britain in ten years,” killed 30 million peasants, Mao was forced into retirement but remained paramount leader in name. (Later, he would stage a comeback, ushering in another decade-long disaster: the Cultural Revolution).\\n\\nIt is already clear that Chinese politics and governance will not be the same after the Covid-19 outbreak. The myth that Xi and his supporters have sustained about the virtues of centralised control has been demolished.\\n\\nLi’s parting words – “A healthy society should not have only one voice” – will remain etched in the minds of hundreds of millions of Chinese, who have seen for themselves that censorship can endanger their lives. <image> <image> <image>\" } ]\n\nobelics_100k_multi\n\nobelics_4999\n\n[ { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"ab982217f41814c8501fda67d8e01c48584ac4f38ccddd586af1565ce8abaa15.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"7e12fd698ed6c43e23e842349ae15e591454b3d9600136fa02b0217a8a2c722b.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"eaae827f923362205a5b3ae3bbf89f507312a2d1c7f6fc0c368e451026b2e03b.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"fbb89417a532d19856fc26118ecf292d0eba79c8ae408035ee4fa988c1d53c13.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"383dda6bd43dbc0b4bd3755dce5a5095c95ec7eb3b2ba09d305fde20112f43da.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"3e953dbe1d8dd9c6cd69e3ae957e38b0592d2174499396b71bf726e5d5e836f0.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"4755936f6422767f16842f6ac3217a35a6de09aaa26c83a43bd4f30ac96ceb9e.jpg\" } ]\n\n[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": null }, { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Thanks to a weird quirk in airline pricing from the UK, I’m headed back to London for free. The plan, as much as there is one, is to stay for about a week, then head to Europe. Probably southern France, but who knows. I’ll figure out when I get there.\\n\\nThis is the same general direction I went on my last trip, but unlike that adventure, I have zero plan after London. Just a direction.\\n\\nI have spent the majority of this year on the road, and while I’m by no means an expert (check out CyclingDutchGirl for that), I see from Facebook and Twitter comments that a lot of people have questions about things I take for granted.\\n\\nSo here are some travel tips from an inveterate traveler.\\n\\nAirfare prices, generally, don’t change much the closer you get to departure\\n\\nThe price change myth is shockingly pervasive. As long as you’re flexible on exact flights (and airlines), the price of a ticket 3 months out isn’t radically different from 3 days. I booked my flight to Australia 3 months out from departure, and it was $1,600. That same flight, the morning of the flight was $1,650. Nearly all my flights this year I booked no more than a day or two in advance. <image> (Leadenhall Place) Every hostel I stayed at had at least one, usually more than one, person over 50. Very few hostels have age caps (and screw them). Hostels are a brilliant way to meet new people, are usually clean, comfortable, and most importantly, cheap.\\n\\nHostelworld.com works like any hotel website, showing you what’s available in the area, and most importantly, many, many reviews. Usually any place lower than an 80% is a hole, but check the actual reviews. Sometimes people will rate a hostel badly because their roommate snored, or some other stupid reason.\\n\\nI did 3 months in Australia and SE Asia with 36 pounds of luggage, and 12 of that was camera and computer gear I needed for work. Pack for 90% of what you will likely encounter, and buy the rest if you need it when you get there. If you can’t easily lift your luggage, you have packed too much.\\n\\nAnd don’t give me that “well you’re a boy” crap. Don’t sell your gender short. No one is going to give a shit if you wear the same shirt more than once, least of all boys. <image> (London) I’m always surprised how few people sign up for these. They’re free, and they add up. Even flying once or twice a year is enough for a free ticket after two years. Sometimes the miles expire, sure, but that’s not a reason not to sign up, is it?\\n\\nI’ve never had a hotel deny me a late checkout, and most have no issue with early check-in. Sometimes there are legitimate issues (cleaning, it’s booked), but hotels are usually very flexible.\\n\\nHostels, I’ve found, are a lot less accommodating. Most want you out by a certain time, and won’t let you check in early. Not sure why that is, but it’s pretty universal. Still, can’t hurt to ask. <image> (Stonehenge) Got a few hours before your flight, but after you check out (or the opposite?), I’ve never found a hotel or hostel that won’t keep your luggage for a few hours.\\n\\nGet a USB battery pack\\n\\nFor under $50 you can get a great USB battery pack that will recharge all your devices if you’re away from an outlet for a long time.\\n\\nAlong the same lines, you probably don’t need a power converter. Just outlet adapters. The only things you would need a converter for is an old laptop, or a hairdryer. Neither of which you should bring with you (hotels have the latter, and you should be able to find one in any hostel – or buy one when you get there).\\n\\nPhotograph or scan your credit cards (both sides), driver’s license, and passport, then email these to yourself. It won’t get you through customs, but might save you some hassle if something/everything gets stolen.\\n\\nLock your phone, use two-factor authentication\\n\\nUse a screen lock on your phone. Not one of the swipe/design ones (you can see the smudges).\\n\\nEnable, if you can, two-step authentication on your email. If you plan on using public computers, this will make checking your email annoying, but should prevent someone from stealing your login. <image> (Giant's Causeway) Unlock your phone (if you can) and buy a local SIM\\n\\nMy #2 overall travel tip (the next one is #1). If you can unlock your phone, you can get a local SIM and get really, really cheap data rates. For comparison, Sprint international data roaming is $19 a megabyte (one picture upload). The lowest I got was in Austria, which was $0.01 per megabyte. You read that right. Local SIM’s rule.\\n\\nNo matter how shitty your day is going, no matter how jetlagged you are, smile like an idiot and everything is a LOT easier. <image> (Long Room Trinity College) <image> (Akihabara) <image>\" } ]\n\nobelics_100k_multi\n\nobelics_4999\n\n[ { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"5da6621835775c5e13ae845a3be4ee6768d5211f74ce7b75cf2fb37b832b85ce.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"440d35980d3ab936727ba9be82d4312a5502d46badfc90e555e2989a55e5e1ef.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"63aca380c81eb5d575be835cd1c990cc384cfec175db0797cbe0ab03ac45dab9.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"0b990bf59a0d81370e38ceb47eb154e37f8126e3aa84d859b2d198c1aa4001f6.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"98f9892e51ac5a0e618af4f39d74179405f1dedddf8692006ef86746f267beb7.jpg\" } ]\n\n[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": null }, { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"<image> The sci-fi geek suing James Cameron for stealing the \\\"Avatar\\\" idea might have a case -- but most likely ... he's wasting his time.\\nAnd, Khloe Kardashian's hubby Lamar Odom on the outs with the Lakers after the Chris Paul trade fails.

Rather than lament in a decrease in his rushing attempts, he took the challenge head on.\\n\\nAnd now with the Grizzlies on the doorstep of a second 5A state title in three years, he is realizing that the change has made him a more rounded football player as he’s been able to shine in both the running back and wide receiver position this year.\\n\\nThe Grizzlies (8-0) are hoping that versatility can lead them to the state title today.

With Rocky Mountain having a couple of corners banged up during the game, the Grizzlies threw him into that position, despite Erickson not having practiced corner back at all this season.\\n\\nWhile he has seen some time at nickel, playing a hybrid linebacker-safety role, Erickson said that was the first time that he had ever been on man-to-man coverage in a game situation.\\n\\n“I think I like safety more, but learning corner right off the bat and not knowing a ton about it was fun,” said Erickson. “I was just going out there, trusting my instincts and doing what I can do.”\\n\\nDespite the fun he had on defense, it’s still been offense where he’s made the biggest impact for Rocky Mountain, particularly in the playoffs. In the Grizzlies’ semifinal and quarterfinal wins, he had a combined eight catches for 357 yards and five touchdowns. Four of his five touchdown receptions in that span have gone for more than 65 yards.\\n\\n“Knowing there’s a lot more pressure has allowed me to focus more,” Erickson said about his postseason success. “It’s been a driving factor.”\\n\\nHis versatility has also caught the eye of college recruiters, as he currently holds offers from all three service academies — Army, Navy and Air Force — as well as Idaho, San Diego and the College of Idaho. Erickson said he’s been waiting for the season to end before narrowing down the list. That season’s end will come after the game today, regardless of a Rocky Mountain win or loss.\\n\\nUntil then, his focus is on making sure that result a win, and getting a second state championship to go with the one he won as a sophomore in 2018.\\n\\n“He’s just a perfect example of what we’re looking for,” said Culig. “He came in as a freshman and was a good player as a freshman, but he committed himself to the weight room, committed himself to the program. He was always looking to get better and kept improving and improving. He’s really good for the younger kids, he pays attention and is supper approachable. He’s everything you want as a player.”\" } ]\n\nobelics_100k_multi\n\nobelics_4999\n\n[ { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"1899adf14e3bdb35ec69fb487ba6db08e324ba9fd84b359e18273d7d9305dd98.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"270c51f8e65a8c80a30c1b205b99c02c77c1a925bd684b5c11cc0ad95238a65a.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"b30d4381e82c8546471e1593887e9dc7809c0c3b7c773a9c3a3f6df6ccf953a8.jpg\" } ]\n\n[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": null }, { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The US space agency Nasa should prioritise a mission to Uranus, an influential panel of scientists says. <image> (Planet Uranus, captured through the Hubble Space Telescope.) The \\\"ice giant\\\" is the seventh planet in our Solar System, orbiting the Sun 19 times further out than the Earth.\\n\\nIt's only ever been visited once before, in a brief flyby by the Voyager-2 probe in 1986.\\n\\nResearchers think an in-depth study of Uranus can help them better understand the many similarly sized objects now being discovered around other stars.\\n\\nThe recommendation is made in a document published by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS).\\n\\nKnown as a \\\"decadal survey\\\", it is the summation of what the American research community thinks are the big planetary science questions right now and the space missions required to answer them.\\n\\nThe last planetary decadal survey, published in 2011, had as its two top priorities a rock-collection mission to Mars, which became the Perseverance rover, now on the surface of the Red Planet; and a mission to Jupiter and its moon Europa, which is currently being prepared for launch in 2024. This is called the Europa Clipper spacecraft.\\n\\nSpecialists who study the outer planets in our Solar System have been campaigning for a return visit to either Uranus or Neptune ever since their late-80s Voyager-2 encounters. And the science case has only strengthened over the intervening years, proponents argue.\\n\\nLook at the size-range of planets now being discovered around other stars and they seem to dominate in a range that's about three and four times the width of the Earth. That's Uranus and Neptune.\\n\\n\\\"And that actually poses a problem for planet formation theories,\\\" explained professor Leigh Fletcher, who contributed to the report.\\n\\n\\\"A mission to Uranus could help us answer that,\\\" the Leicester University scientist said. <image> (Artwork showing the Cassini mission to Saturn) Artwork: European scientists will hope they can join the mission, just as they did with the Cassini mission to Saturn. Photo: NASA\\n\\nThere are favourable launch opportunities in 2031 and 2032 that would allow a spacecraft to use a gravity slingshot around Jupiter to shorten the cruise time to Uranus to \\\"just\\\" 13 years.\\n\\nThe spacecraft would go into orbit around the planet, which would preclude any observations at the more-distant Neptune. The eighth and outermost planet will have to wait its turn.\\n\\nUranus is an oddity compared with the other planets in the Solar System in that its axis of rotation is almost parallel with the plane of its orbit around the Sun. It's as if it has been knocked on to its side, which may well be the explanation - scientists speculate that it suffered a massive impact with another body early in its history.\\n\\nUranus has rings and plenty of moons. Indeed, the moons are quite a draw because a good many of them are likely to be \\\"ocean worlds\\\".\\n\\n\\\"This is the idea that you've got an icy crust, and then you've got some kind of liquid briny ocean down at depth that may or may not be in contact with whatever silicate rocky material is down at the bottom,\\\" said Fletcher.\\n\\n\\\"Well, all of the big five classical satellites of Uranus are thought of as being ocean world candidates. These moons could have cryo-volcanic (ice volcano) activity taking place on them.\\\"\\n\\nDr Robin Canup from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, was the co-chair on the Academies' steering committee.\\n\\nShe said an ice giant was a worthy target for a Nasa flagship and of all the potential candidates assessed in what would be the most expensive class of endeavour, the Uranus mission was the most mature technically.\\n\\n\\\"It was the only one to receive a low-medium rating for its risk,\\\" she explained.\\n\\n\\\"So because of that, we are extremely excited to recommend that the highest priority new flagship should be a Uranus orbiter and probe. This will be a fantastic multi-year mission with the probe dropping into the planet at the beginning of the mission, followed by an extended orbital tour investigating the satellites, their interiors, the magnetosphere, the rings, and the atmosphere.\\n\\n\\\"It is technically ready to start now. We recommend that it be initiated in financial 2024.\\\" <image> (This photo released by NASA, shows the Perseverance rover being lowered by the Sky Crane to the surface of Mars on February 18, 2021. - NASA said February 18, 2021 that the Perseverance rover has touched down on the surface of Mars ) The successful completion of the Perseverance rover's mission comes before all else, the researchers said. Photo: AFP / NASA\\n\\nEuropean-based planetary researchers, like Fletcher, will be hoping the European Space Agency (ESA) can contribute to such a mission.\\n\\nNasa and ESA are frequent partners, such as on the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn (2004-2017), but their priorities and funding cycles do not always coincide.\\n\\nAnd for Nasa, the speed at which it's able to implement the recommendation will depend on its other financial commitments.\\n\\nThe decadal survey panel said completing the Perseverance rover's objectives and the follow-up missions designed to bring its rock samples back to Earth came before everything else in importance.\" } ]\n\nobelics_100k_multi\n\nobelics_4999\n\n[ { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"822960457e06d35046da6971506096ea6bab3609994f6d58ed6fb8a4f0292ba5.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"7d6020acd9e0673bcc6d39dfbb2dee2da1fdfbe3de1ed11703d6087cc2895fe6.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"5073f922e6bd1f39dad881bab4d84d70028d2c890cb12c720bda4821ee5608ae.jpg\" }, { \"bytes\": null, \"path\": \"bd62b76eafcb8de70f34b75ab09641a795591a3531af037f2e733609a27d2558.jpg\" } ]\n\n[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": null }, { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"<image> Dr. Nichols currently serves as a medical adviser to the Sjögren’s Syndrome Foundation, has served extensively on the executive board and for the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society and on each of the steering committees (DEWS, DEWS II, Contact Lens Discomfort, and MGD workshops), and is a founding member of the Ocular Surface Society of Optometry.

People with the true faith in the Kingdom of God will influence the world in these last days – Matthew 24:14 “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.”\\nThe Kingdom people do not only preach from the pulpit on Sundays, but they are preaching through their godly conduct at their work places, in the professions, relationships and lives. They will become great testimonies for people to come and embrace the Kingdom of God. God will position His Kingdom people in the most significant and prestigious positions in the work place, so that they may become greater influencers.\\n\\nTHE MOUNTAIN OF FAMILY\\n\\nFamily is the foundation of a culture. His first command to human being was to be fruitful – to have children – God wants His family on earth to set the standard for a Godly culture. A Kingdom Family will be blessed and honoured on earth when they are molding a culture of love, faith and hope. The only sign of a true disciple of Christ is when they love one another (John 13:35.) Their lifestyle will become the platform for the Kingdom of God to be established – A responsible father, a loving mother and teachable children. <image> (d) <image> (1707-2019-0420095756248977840828) THE MOUNTAIN OF EDUCATION\\n\\nEducation is for the future – a future generation that will embrace the knowledge of God, not humanism. The mandate of this mountain is preparing the new generation to become a great leader that will have godly principles. An example of this is through the training for the new generation in using modern technology for the benefits of the world and the Kingdom.\\n\\nTHE MOUNTAIN OF GOVERNMENT\\n\\nThis mountain will hold a great government that will take care of its people. They will lead by example and honest politicians will be found. Why? Because the Kingdom people realise that this mountain needs them to arise and reposition themselves to take the battle. Before Jesus is coming back on earth for the second time, He will find His children will post themselves amongst the governmental leaders of the nations. No more lies behind the politician’s mask – Prov.29:12 <image> (c) <image> (a) THE MOUNTAIN OF MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY\\n\\nMedia and technology is the fastest tool to spread the news out. Don’t be shocked by the power of this media and technology. You can observe now that nations have been toppled down through Twitter and Facebook. This technology will accelerate the spreading of the Gospel out all over the world. Kingdom people will possess this area and create something new that will glorify the Lord.\\n\\nTHE MOUNTAIN OF CELEBRATION\\n\\nUsually the devil is using this mountain to influence the new generation by means of violence, immorality, promiscuous sex and drugs through Hollywood. But in the last days, the Kingdom people will give a huge influence in terms of Family values and Godly values through their films and Godly. lifestyle of the actors and actresses. They will become such a positive role model for the new generations. There will be a great TV shows and movies that will bring the family back to their original purposes, giving example of strong characters – not giving in to temptations. <image> (b) <image> (f) THE MOUNTAIN OF BUSINESS\\n\\nSurely this mountain will create a culture of Giving within Kingdom people. They will be successful, honoured and wealthy as a result of their commitment to God. Integrity, loyalty, generosity and humility will be their business trade mark and character. The business kingdom of this world will become the Kingdom of God. Kingdom people will send many missionaries to all the nations of the world, building churches for the glory of God, loving one another while helping the helpless to stand on their feet.
