        "text": "Martin Vaculik hopes to win his third consecutive Orlen FIM Speedway GP of Czech Republic in Prague on Saturday.\n\nAlthough he is from across the border, the Slovakian native considers the Czech race to be his home event, and he has won in both the last two events.\n\nCurrently seventh in the standings of the World Championship, he hopes to add to his 27 points in pursuit of current leader Bartosz Zmarzlik on 50.\n\nVaculik used to watch Speedway at the track as a child and speaking to FIMSpeedway.com, he revealed his pride to be racing there once more.\n\n“It just shows that dreams come true,” he said. “This is what is nice about sport. When kids are small and they have their own sporting idols, they support them, watch them and they start dreaming big things. Sometimes these big things happen. It’s amazing.\n\n“This Grand Prix has been so great for me and having two wins here already is such a beautiful feeling. I’m very grateful and thankful for this.\n\n“But those wins are history and now we have something new in front of us. I am just taking it like it is. It’s a new challenge in front of me and I will just enjoy the Prague meeting like always and try my best.”\n\nWith plenty of shared history between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Vaculik is keen to welcome fans from both countries at the weekend.\n\nHe added: “So many people from Slovakia will be there and also the Czech fans always support me. It’s always nice to race in Prague. I have so many good memories here. It’s just a place with good energy for me.”\n\nA middling start to the season sees him hopeful to repeat his success.\n\n“I’m in a similar position to where I was last year,” he acknowledged. “Unfortunately, in the last couple of seasons, my first part of the season has not been the best or not what I would have wished.\n\n“But I really hope this tournament will be good again for me. I hope so. I am keeping my fingers crossed for that.”"
