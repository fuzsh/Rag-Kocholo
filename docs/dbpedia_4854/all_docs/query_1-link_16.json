Andorra 21 in Andorra La Vela (ENC 2B)\n\nBriefly\n\nAustralia were too good for a Barbarians side sadly unable to keep up with the Southern Hemisphere side.\n\nIn front of a good crowd Moldova dominated in the forwards to win in Prague. They are now well placed to challenge Belgium for the title.\n\nThe winner of ENC 1B, and thus promotion to ENC 1A, looks like being between Poland, Moldova and Belgium. Belgium has more games in hand and looks the favoured side to win with the spring matches to come.\n\nENC 1B\n\nP W D L PF PA DIFF BT BL PT POLAND 8 5 1 2 193 150 43 1 1 24 MOLDOVA 7 5 1 1 145 114 31 2 0 24 BELGIUM 6 5 0 1 178 88 90 2 1 23 CZECH R. 9 4 0 5 143 198 -54 1 2 19 GERMANY 7 2 0 5 140 158 -18 0 3 11 NETH. 7 0 0 7 91 183 -92 0 1 1\n\nSwitzerland kept their title hopes alive with a narrow one point win over Andorra. ‘Swiss owned the first half but had to kick a very late penalty to win after Andorra came back to take the lead.’ http://www.fira-aer-rugby.com/forum2007/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3956\n\nSwitzerland are way out in front.

But I also spare a thought for an even more emotional game against New Zealand in 1964 and Wilson Whineray’s equally famous try.\n\nApparently the game will be played for the Killik Cup. Silly me. I have always associated Barbarian matches as friendly affairs. So with a bit of research I came up with this bit of information.\n\n‘Sophie Morris, Director of Marketing at Killik & Co, commented: “Killik & Co has been Associate Match Sponsor of Barbarian games held at Twickenham since they played New Zealand in December 2009. It is a relationship that we are very pleased with and are delighted to extend our association with the prestigious club through title sponsorship of this game.” ‘\n\nhttp://www.sponsorship-awards.co.uk/news/killik-co-sponsorsship-barbarian-v-australia-line-twickenham\n\nFormer New Zealand coach, and guider of that team to the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Graham Henry has the honour of coaching the Barbarians side. This fittingly means he will lock horns with his Kiwi rival and now head coach of Australia Robbie Deans\n\nThe Barbarian selection throws up some interesting characters. Mortlock, Matfield, Shaw, Stringer, Marconnet and White could well be bidding farewell to the international rugby scene whilst Tomkins has apparently been ‘borrowed’ from the rugby league code for this match.\n\nThe Australians have a sprinkling of players on the fringe of test rugby and possibly resting players ahead of the big clash against Wales next weekend.\n\nPrediction: Hmmm. Australia to be more cohesive and win by 7 points.\n\nTeams\n\nBarbarians\n\n15 Isaia Toeava, 14 Samuel Tomkins, 13 Robert Fruean, 12 Stirling Mortlock, 11 Bryan Habana, 10 Daniel Cipriani, 9 Peter Stringer, 8 Adam Thomson,\n\n7 Mauro Bergamasco, 6 Jerome Kaino, 5 Victor Matfield, Capt. 4 Simon Shaw, 3 Sylvain Marconnet, 2 Keven Mealamu, 1 Eusebio Guinazu.\n\nReplacements\n\n16 Adriaan Strauss, 17 Salvatore Perugini, 18 Jason White, 19 Marco Bortolami, 20 Nemia Kenatale, 21 Richard Kahui, 22 Seru Rabeni.\n\nCoach: Graham Henry\n\nAustralia\n\n15 Adam Ashley-Cooper, 14 Lachlan Turner, 13 Robert Horne, 12 Berrick Barnes, 11 Digby Ioane, 10 James O'Connor, 9 William Genia, 8 Benjamin McCalman, 7 David Pocock,Capt. 6 Scott Higginbotham, 5 Nathan Sharpe,\n\n4 Robert Simmons, 3 Salesi Ma'afu, 2 Tatafu Polota Nau, 1 James Slipper.\n\nReplacements\n\n16 Stephen Moore, 17 Benjamin Alexander, 18 James Horwill, 19 Dave Dennis, 20 Matthew Hodgson, 21 Nicholas Phipps, 22 Benjamin Tapuai.\n\nCoach: Robbie Deans\n\n26.11.2011\n\nMoldova v Czech Republic in Prague (ENC 1B)\n\nVenue: Stadion Josefa Kohouta, Říčany\n\nReferee: Barguanas (Romania)\n\nP W D L PF PA DIFF BT BL PT POLAND 8 5 1 2 193 150 43 1 1 24 BELGIUM 6 5 0 1 178 88 90 2 1 23 MOLDOVA 6 4 1 1 132 108 24 2 0 20 CZECH R. 8 4 0 4 137 185 -47 1 1 18 GERMANY 7 2 0 5 140 158 -18 0 3 11 NETH. 7 0 0 7 91 183 -92 0 1 1\n\nPreview\n\nThis is the last Division 1B match until February.\n\n‘On the occasion of 85 years of the Czech Rugby (1926-2011), the famous squad lead by captain Eduard Krützner which on May 1968 in Prague lost to France with all their stars of that time only 6:19 (3:3 in the second half!) will be awarded.’ http://www.fira-aer-rugby.com/forum2007/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3955&p=44474#p44474 So this is indeed a special occasion for Czech Republic with a famous match to remember and a famous captain honoured.\n\nThe French Team on the day!\n\n15 FB\n\nPierre Villepreux\n\n14 W\n\nJean-Marie Bonal\n\n13 C\n\nJean-Pierre Lux\n\n12 C\n\nJo Maso\n\n11 W\n\nAndre Campaes\n\n10 FH\n\nClaude Lacaze\n\n9 SH\n\nMarcel Puget\n\n1 P\n\nMichel Lasserre\n\n2 H\n\nMichel Yachvili\n\n3 P\n\nJean-Claude Noble\n\n4 L\n\nAlain Plantefol\n\n5 L\n\nElie Cester\n\n6 F\n\nJean Salut\n\n7 F\n\nChristian Carrere (c)\n\n8 N8\n\nMichel Greffe\n\nImage thanks to www.scrum.com\n\nSo back to today’s game.\n\nThe Czech Republic has had a very chequered 2011 year at this level of test rugby. They reached a serious low with the heavy defeat to Belgium earlier in the month but recovered to win well against Netherlands last weekend.\n\nMoldova has a much better record. They remain undefeated since March and drew with the rising Polish team two weeks ago. Compared with the Poles they have lost only the one match and although further down the points table, have two matches in hand.\n\nMoldova has a better recent record against the Czech Republic but both games were home games. They lost their 2008 test v Czech Republic in Prague.\n\nPrevious Encounters\n\n19.03.2011 Moldova 24-16 in Chisinau (ENC 1B)\n\n14.11.2009 Moldova 45-30 in Chisinau (WCQ Europe R4; ENC 2A)\n\n27.11.2008 Czech Republic 11-9 in Prague (WCQ Europe R4; ENC 2A)\n\nCzech Republic Last Five\n\n19.11.2011 v Netherlands W 22-10 in Prague (ENC 1B)\n\n05.11.2011 v Belgium L 0-55 in Brussels (ENC 1B)\n\n15.10.2011 v Poland L 13-20 in NowySacz (ENC 1B)\n\n19.03.2011 v Moldova L 16-24 in Chisinau (ENC 1B)\n\n12.03.2011 v Germany W 29-23 in Heidelberg (ENC 1B)\n\nMoldova Last Five\n\n12.11.2011 v Poland D 17-17 in Chisinau (ENC 1B)\n\n30.04.2011 v Netherlands W 22-15 in Chisinau (ENC 1B)\n\n02.04.2011 v Germany W 28-15 in Chisinau (ENC 2B)\n\n19.03.2011 v Czech Republic W 24-16 in Chisinau (ENC 1B)\n\n12.02.2011 v Belgium L 5-20 in Brussels (ENC 1B)\n\nGWC Rugby Rankings\n\nEurope Table-Moldova 13th, Czech Republic 16th\n\nIRB Ranking Points\n\nMoldova 53.75, Czech Republic 52.65\n\nPrediction: Moldova by 4 points.\n\nTeams\n\nCzech Republic\n\n1.Šuster Roman (C)\n\n2.Kutil Ondřej\n\n3.Indrák Pavel\n\n4.Wognitsch Martin\n\n5.Holovský Tomáš\n\n6.Leroch Patrik\n\n7.Nešpor Karel\n\n8.Černý Jiří\n\n9.Pailodze Vakhtang\n\n10.Jirman Milan\n\n11.Schlanger Michal\n\n12.Okleštěk Petr\n\n13.Jursík Václav\n\n14.Jirman Michal\n\n15.Rohlík Jan\n\n16.Průša Michal\n\n17.Macháček Lukáš\n\n18.Hocke Pavel\n\n19.Backa Radim\n\n20.
