        "text": "England during the 19th century could be considered in many aspects as the center of the world. It was still an imperialistic power, it was the place where the industrial revolution started, social and ideological debates were an everyday issue, arts and literature flourished, new scientific theories and technological ideas expressed. In this typical capitalistic environment the study of nature was not only an enterprise supported by the state but also a practice followed by rich entrepreneurs, who had the necessary funds to establish their private “research centers”. Earth sciences like geology and paleontology and the study of the heavens were among the most popular ones. In this paper a special case is studied, the story of a telescope built by Thomas Cooke to be used by the English tycoon Robert Stirling Newall in 1869. Though we are going to approach “Newall’s telescope” as it is now known from a specific point of view, that it was a failure we must admit that it was a technological masterpiece at that time. The basic reason that the telescope, though a technological miracle, may be considered a failure is the fact that it was used scarcely during the first twenty five years of its existence. It is not accidental that the first paper based on observations done by this telescope published only in 1892. After a careful examination of the existing bibliography on the telescope not even one reference has been found regarding a possible inadequacy of its construction. On the contrary both the original optical and the mechanical parts were of so good a quality that even today are still working original parts of the instrument. We claim what was a failure was the management of the telescope by Newall himself. For example he did not hire permanently an expert to use the instrument at the time he was engaged with his duties as an industrialist. Furthermore, the site where the instrument was located was problematic from the very beginning. There was a lot of air pollution due to the adjacent factories but also a lot of humidity due to the river that flowed a little further and dramatically reduced the quality of the observations. Finally the instrument flourished when it was moved to Cambridge. There, Newall Jr. published 20 papers in 18 years, a fact that proves that what was a failure was not the instrument itself but its use by Newall. In the 1950’s the telescope was transported to Athens, Greece where it was used by Greek astronomers for planetary and variable-star research until it was surpassed by newer instruments. Again, the famous telescope met a new “career” as a window to the universe for pupils, students and families."
