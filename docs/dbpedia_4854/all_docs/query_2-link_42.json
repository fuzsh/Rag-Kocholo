        "text": "Our History:\n\nNew Prague Soccer Club, is a member of MYSA (Minnesota Youth Soccer Association) and SMSL (Southern Minnesota Soccer League), and was developed for the purpose of promoting the game of soccer and sportsmanship for all youth in New Prague, MN and the surrounding communities. In 2010 our club was formed with fewer than 100 players with a goal to introduce soccer to New Prague and the surrounding communities. By 2016, NPSC experienced significant growth and now competes in a variety of facilities (indoor and outdoor) year round with over 530 player registrations and teams competing at the competitive MYSA first division & premier levels, along with the SMSL's black and blue leagues.\n\nOur Mission:\n\nThe New Prague Soccer Club is a non-profit organization whose mission is to foster the physical, mental and emotional growth and development of our youth through the sport of soccer at all levels of age and competition. We will have fun playing the game of soccer, and will instill a lifelong passion for the sport in our players.\n\nOur Vision:\n\nNew Prague Soccer Club’s vision statement is designed to inspire a clear direction for the club to move in. Our vision is considered to be both desirable and feasible.
