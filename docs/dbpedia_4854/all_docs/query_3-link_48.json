        "text": "Prague is still the Number One Touring destination in Eastern Europe. Served by flights from across the UK, the city is easy to get to, affordable to stay in, and beer is still relatively cheap.\n\nThe historic and picturesque city is often described as a beer lovers paradise. Over 28 breweries and Brewpub throughout Prague, not to mention the endless amount of bars and restaurants that also serve up local brews and delicacies.\n\nRugby in Prague is as strong as it gets in Eastern Europe with a handful of clubs that can compete with the best from the West and plenty more than are excellent hosts for the more social sides.\n\nThe city is a must as part of an Eastern European Voyage!"
