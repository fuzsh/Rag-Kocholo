        "text": "Used Gallon Milk Jug As Gas Can\n\nI drive a 2000 Chevy S-10 pickup with a 4.3L V6. This truck once went almost 100 mi with the low fuel light on on a lonely stretch of highway in Utah. The truck is rated to drive about 380 miles on a tank of gas but I am pretty sure I could get 420 under the right conditions. Anyways, the light comes on with 1/4 of a tank remains. I believe this holds 18.3 gallons.\n\nAnyways, I had some REALLY bad gas this one time. The truck was running real rough, had stinky exhaust, and had no power whatsoever. So, I decided to run out as much of this junk gas as possible before filling up. One factor I didn't account for was that the truck was likely burning a lot more of this low quality gas to go the same distance. So, I had gone about 40 miles with the light on and the truck died... just past the entrance ramp for an exit where a gas station was located. We were going on a long trip and had lots of gallon milk jugs filled with water along with a few of the typical skinny plastic water bottles that hold 16 oz. or so.\n\nAnyways, we emptied out one of the water jugs and were shaking out all the residual water out as we walked back up the entrance ramp to the gas station. I made note of a sign on the gas pump stating it was illegal to use unauthorized containers for gas. I knew that both milk jugs and gas cans are made of HDPE plastic so I didn't have to worry about the gas eating the plastic. I figured the main difference was the thickness of the plastic and I was just using this for a short while anyways. So, I inserted a credit card and hoped the attendant inside wouldn't notice the person who just walked up off the street and started filling a milk jug with gasoline.\n\nWe then walked back to the car and decided that the mouth of the milk jug wouldn't fit into the gas fill tube. So, I chugged one of those skinny 16 oz. bottles of water and cut the bottom out with a pocket knife, creating a funnel for the gasoline. My friend was taking pictures of me right as the highway patrolman pulled up behind us to make sure everything was ok. I don't know if he was called or if he just found us on a routine patrol. See www.umr.edu/~cwatkin/running_out_of_gas for some pictures. Notice the semi roaring by just a few feet away off to the left side of the second picture.\n\nThe highway patrolman escorted us down to the next exit where where we had the choice of an adult bookstore and a run down gas station that didn't appear to be open. Luckily the place was open and I filled the tank to the brim. After that, I went inside to use the restroom. My friend had been in there while I was getting gas and he said, \"DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING INSIDE THAT RESTROOM!\" Well, he wasn't kidding. I didn't even bother to close the door behind me once I was inside as the place was just covered in an old urine film. The sink was filled with disgusting water and there was a sign warning not to drink the water, like I needed to be told. The best sign (included in the pictures) stated that the restroom was free for your use and you could get cleaning supplies inside if you felt the need to complain. Anyways, the bathroom pictures just don't do the place justice. I have seen some nasty gas station restrooms but this one topped them all.\n\nAnyways, this was quite the experience and will be one I never forget. I now carry a 2 gallon gas can when on those long trips along with my gallon milk jugs!\n\nStory replies"
