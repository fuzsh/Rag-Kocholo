        "text": "For this blog I thought it would be a good idea to compile all of the various editions of My Favourite Pubs in London, so you have a definitive guide to the capital’s boozers. So here is the complete list, which I will continue to update when I create the next volume.\n\nThe Crosse Keys (9 Gracechurch Street, EC3V 0DR)\n\nLocated in the heart of the City, the Crosse Keys is set in an old bank building (think Gringotts from Harry Potter, but with a bar in the middle). The pub has high ceilings with lots of marble columns. Oh and if that doesn’t sound good enough, it’s a Wetherspoons, giving you some of the cheapest pints in The City.\n\nThe Blind Beggar (337 Whitechapel Road, E1 1BU)\n\nThis pub has quite a bit of history. However, it is best remembered as the pub in which William Booth made his first sermon in 1865 which led to the creation of the Salvation Army and it was where Ronnie Kray shot George Cornell in 1966. Because of this, the walls are adorned with Kray memorabilia. Nowadays the pub is popular with students and has a decent beer garden. Would recommend a curry at nearby Tayyabs before heading here for some drinks afterwards.\n\nAnchor Tap (20A Horselydown Lane, SE1 2LN)\n\nHeading south of the river (but only just) for my next pub. Anchor Tap is a Samuel Smith Pub (They also own The Chandos at the back of Trafalgar Square along with a few others) which means all the beer is made by their brewery in Yorkshire. It’s small and intimate with a real fire. As with all Samuel Smith pubs, there’s no music which can seem strange when you first step in. However, it gives it a traditional feel. I frequent here often as it’s close to my workplace, even if as a tall gentleman, I do have to duck down often!\n\nOak & Pastor (86 Junction Road, N19 5QZ)\n\nA list like this wouldn’t be complete without my local! Again an intimate pub which serves a good range of beers and has a great food menu, making it perfect for a first date or for catching up with friends or family. They also show the football on there meaning the atmosphere changes on Arsenal match days. The upstairs room is used for events such as live comedy (I’ve also used it to host a pub quiz for the local Labour Party in the past).\n\nThe Swimmer at the Grafton Arms (13 Eburne Road, N7 6AR)\n\nTucked away on a side street just off Holloway Road, The Swimmer is a cracker. It’s intimate and has a real fire and a real jukebox (which is free, bonus!). Additionally, they have a great choice of beers, many of which are from Europe and the walls are covered in swimming memorabilia. The last time I was in there, I discovered they had a Belgian beer called Zot on tap, which is one of my favourites. I was especially impressed given that I hadn’t seen Zot on tap anywhere before, and that included anywhere I’d been to in Belgium!\n\nThe Faltering Fullback (19 Perth Road, N4 3HB)\n\nThis pub is pretty special, so much so there are 3 parts to it. Firstly, it’s a rugby-themed pub, making it a destination when the Six Nations is on. Secondly, the food menu comes in the form of a Thai kitchen which sits in the middle of the pub and thirdly (to beat the smoking ban) there’s an incredible beer garden which has so many levels it could be the Ewok village from Star Wars. All three of these combine to make this one special pub. Given the fact it’s survived on a small street off the Stroud Green Road, it’s a testament to its unique character and if you’re ever around Finsbury Park, I highly recommend you visit.\n\nThe Porterhouse (21-22 Maiden Lane, WC2E 7NA)\n\nThis pub is so epic, it covers 3 floors and you can very easily get lost! Owned by an Irish brewery, their tap beers are all their own and delicious. However, the choice of beers from around the world on offer is also special. If you’ve had a random beer in a foreign land, chances are you can get it in The Porterhouse. In fact, the beer menu is much bigger than the food they offer. But it doesn’t stop there, the walls are covered in beer bottles of all ages and from every part of the globe. The downstairs bar and dancefloor have cover bands on the weekend which play every rock classic under the sun and make a great way to spend your Saturday night. Moving upstairs, at the front of the pub there is a cocktail bar and at the back, there is a more quiet and intimate whiskey bar. No matter the occasion, be it a first date, having a big night out with your friends or catching up with family, this pub has it all, making it my favourite in London.\n\nThe Bread & Roses (68 Clapham Manor Street, SW4 6DZ)\n\nOwned by the Workers Beer Company, The Bread & Roses is a cracking pub “for the many”. It has a small theatre upstairs and has a good conservatory and beer garden. The food here is also pretty good. But the fact it is owned by a trade union means this pub is popular with Labourites from far and wide. The pub also has a stage at Glastonbury Festival.\n\nEuston Tap (190 Euston Road, Kings Cross, NW1 2EF)\n\nLocated in an old Victorian lodge building in front of Euston station, The Euston Tap is a great shout if you fancy a quick pint before catching your train. There are actually a number of these pubs across the country owned by the Tap Brewery (I can recommend the York Tap and the Sheffield Tap as well). While it might not be the most cosy pub in the city, it makes up for it in its range of nearly 30 craft beers on tap and unique character. If I’m correct, it was also ahead of the curve in having no beer pumps but having taps on the wall instead. I also like how it is the last remnants of the original station, with the Portland stones inscribed with the names of the towns and cities you can travel to from the station.\n\nDean Swift (10 Gainsford Street, SE1 2NE)\n\nKeeping it crafty, Dean Swift is similar in its range of craft ales. This pub isn’t too far from my office and it has been known as a place for Friday drinks on occasion. It’s a good neighbourhood pub, tucked away just a stone’s throw from Tower Bridge and if you’re wondering who on earth Dean Swift is, he’s the author of Gulliver’s Travels. A great little pub.\n\nThe Coronet (338-346 Holloway Road, N7 6NJ)\n\nOne of the bigger pubs in London is The Coronet, the photo really doesn’t do it justice. Set in an old cinema, it’s a massive space and is still complete with the balcony (probably best it’s not accessible!). The walls are also adorned with images of cinema history. This pub is also popular with Arsenal fans on matchdays, so bear that in mind if you’re not a football fan.\n\nSpaniard’s Inn (Spaniards Road, Hampstead, NW3 7JJ)\n\nFirst founded in 1585, the Spaniard’s is a great place to end a day on nearby Hampstead Heath, especially in its sizeable beer garden on a sunny day. This pub is understandably steeped in history with it getting mentioned in The Pickwick Paper by Charles Dickens and in Bram Stoker’s Dracula. It was also frequented by artists and poets including Lord Byron and John Keats who supposedly used the gardens to write. I’m also a fan of the oak decor in here, a proper pub.\n\nThe Owl & Hitchhiker (formerly The Edward Lear, formerly The Quays) (471 Holloway Road, N7 6LE)\n\nThis one is local to me in Archway and has had three different names in the three years I’ve lived there. Despite its changes, it’s a cracking pub which serves a good selection of craft beers and now has a very unique decor (for example, there’s a tree in the middle of the pub…). There is also a balcony and a separate upstairs bar if you want a more intimate atmosphere. This pub has good memories for me as it was where I spent the night of the 2017 General Election, celebrating Labour Gains with the Islington Labour Party.\n\nThe Grapes (76 Narrow Street, Poplar, E14 8BP)\n\nNext up is The Grapes, which has a cracking story behind it. A pub has been on this site since 1583 and it is one of those classic pubs with narrow passages and low ceilings which was once popular with dock workers. It also has a balcony overlooking the River Thames where you have a good view of Canary Wharf and you can see an Anthony Gormley statue at low tide. However, when the pub went up for sale a few years ago, one of its regulars decided to buy it. It just happened to be the actor Sir Ian McKellan, who is seen in the pub from time to time. There is little to tell he owns it though, except for Gandalf’s staff, which sits behind the bar.\n\nThe Boogaloo (312 Archway Rd, Highgate, N6 5AT)\n\nMusic is king at The Boogaloo. With live performances, club nights, a jukebox, a music pub quiz and even its own radio station, this pub has a special place in London’s music scene. Owned by the manager of The Pogues (who have been seen to frequent here), past performers include The Libertines and Florence & The Machine, so if you want to check out who could be the next big thing, The Boogaloo is the place for you. There’s also a decent selection of beers to help you sing your heart out.\n\nTufnell Park Tavern (162 Tufnell Park Road, N7 0EE)\n\nHeading down the Northern Line, the TPT is a great community pub halfway down Tufnell Park Road. I regularly go here after my Labour Party meetings and it’s where I host a Pub Quiz fundraiser for my local party every few months. It is a relatively open space, especially since the removal of the cafe. Yet this pub is surprisingly intimate with its low lighting. There is also a great choice of craft beers which make it a cracking place for a quiet drink with friends.\n\nThe Churchill Arms (119 Kensington Church Street, Kensington, W8 7LN)\n\nThis outstandingly decorated pub in Kensington dates from 1750 and was once frequented by Winston Churchill’s grandparents, leading to the pub being named in his honour after World War Two. The interior is also covered in wartime and Churchill memorabilia making it a great tourist stop. It was the first pub in London to have a Thai restaurant. They have also won awards at the Chelsea Flower Show. It’s a Fuller’s pub so expect London Pride and Frontier on the taps when you go for a drink, but the novelty of this boozer makes it worth visiting. Apparently, it costs £25,000 a year to maintain those hanging baskets, which swap with Christmas trees for the festive period.\n\nThe Red Lion (48 Parliament Street, Westminster, SW1A 2NH)\n\nAnother Fuller’s pub with a Churchill connection (he used to drink here), the Red Lion is at the heart of Westminster and is popular with civil servants, politicos and tourists alike. I still go here whenever I’m back in Westminster and is a great place to spot the political movers and shakers and share the latest gossip. The upstairs also serves as a restaurant for the tourists to get a bit of traditional British cuisine. The only downside is that the popularity of the pub for after-work drinkers makes it a bit crowded after 5pm so be prepared to stand outside!\n\nThe Bohemia (762-764 High Road, N12 9QH)\n\nA vast space in North Finchley, The Bohemia was taken over by the London Brewing Company in 2014. I like this pub mainly because they brew all their beers onsite and have the best selection of other craft beers in this particular list. There is also a good selection of food, bar games like table football and an event space downstairs. The front of the pub also features more intimate seating.\n\nTemple Brew House (46 Essex Street, WC2R 3JF)\n\nTucked away underground near the historic pubs and the law courts, Temple Brew House is a cracking micro-pub which won ShortList Magazine’s (RIP) Best New Pub in 2015. Its underground setting makes it look more like a wine bar but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better craft beer pub so central. With a huge selection of keg beers on tap and more in bottles and screens showing live sport, this is a great place to start your weekend with an after-work drink.\n\nPepper Saint Ontiod (21 Pepper Street, Isle of Dogs, E14 9RP)\n\nSmack bang in the middle of the Isle of Dogs, this pub’s name is actually an acronym. Ontiod stands for “On The Isle Of Dogs” The Pepper St stands for Pepper Street where the pub is located. The downstairs bar is a very welcoming space, a bit like being in someone’s living room. It also has a great view over Millwall dock from its upstairs balcony, along with a pool table and a great selection of beers, this is my favourite pub on the Isle.\n\nThe Hope (48 West Street, Carshalton SM5 2PR)\n\nA winner of numerous CAMRA awards, which are proudly displayed on one of the walls, this pub can be found a five-minute walk from Carshalton train station. The pub was threatened with closure in 2010 but the community came together to purchase it and it is now run as a community pub. Like visiting a country local, The Hope has an excellent choice of locally brewed beers as well as a refurbished rear with a large conservatory filled with musical instruments and board games. I’ve been here a couple of times, usually when watching a football match at the nearby Carshalton Athletic FC.\n\nThe Dundee Arms (339 Cambridge Heath Road, E2 9LH)\n\nHeading east to Bethnal Green, I first visited the Dundee Arms in 2017 when it was taken over for a few days by my favourite band, the Foo Fighters. The Foo Fighters Arms lasted only a few days but the Dundee opened in 2015 and is a cracking pub opposite the V&A’s Museum of Childhood. Again this pub ticks the box of having a great choice of beers and even has a hair salon upstairs.\n\nThe Gregorian (96 Jamaica Road, Bermondsey, SE16 4SQ)\n\nAnother solid pub, this one is not too far from my office and is a couple of minutes walk from Bermondsey tube station. Rebuilt after WW2 in a mock Tudor style, the pub is popular with locals and has a beer garden out the front which is one of the best spots to watch the London Marathon from.\n\nOld Fountain (3 Baldwin Street, Old Street EC1V 9NU)\n\nAny pub that serves my favourite Belgian beer (Brugse Zot) is a favourite of mine. Believed to have been established in the 1750s and owned by the same family since the 1960s, Old Fountain can be found a stone’s throw from Old Street station and Shoreditch and has other great beers on tap. Upstairs there is a roof terrace which is lovely on a nice day.\n\nThe Old Salt Quay (163 Rotherhithe Street, Rotherhithe, SE16 5QU)\n\nWe start this volume on the banks of the River Thames in Rotherhithe at The Old Salt Quay. A rather large, warehouse-style pub, the views of the river are perfect for a summer’s day where you can enjoy the view of the capital and watch the boats go by from its large balcony. There is also a decent food menu if you fancy making an afternoon of your visit.\n\nFour Quarters (187 Rye Lane, Peckham, SE15 4TP)\n\nPeckham has become one of the coolest areas of London in recent years. One of the signs of this is the Four Quarters. Part bar, part video game arcade, it’s a great way to spend the evening reliving the nostalgia of your childhood by playing classic arcade games or Mario Kart on the N64. The upstairs also has old consoles with other retro games. Expect some good local craft beers to be on tap too.\n\nHorniman at Hays (Hay’s Galleria, SE1 2HD)\n\nAnother riverside pub, the Horniman has perfect views of the city skyscrapers which are on the other side of the river. A good spot for an after-work drink (I should know, I work around two minutes from the pub!) the Horniman has a great choice of beers on tap and a good food menu, as well as a rather grand marble interior. I’ve been here numerous times for parties, drinks and catching up with friends, which gives this pub its place on my list.\n\nDe Hems (11 Macclesfield Street, W1D 5BW)\n\nRegular readers will know by now that I love Belgian beer. While De Hems is a Dutch pub, it has the same excellent choice of continental beers, including all of my favourites. The pub is found in a weird location as it’s in the middle of Chinatown, just south of Shaftesbury Avenue, and is opposite one of my favourite restaurants, Rasa Sayang. So if you want a great evening out, I’d suggest drinks here with some excellent Malaysian food at Rasa Sayang.\n\nShaftesbury Tavern (534 Hornsey Road, Finsbury Park, N19 3QN)\n\nFrom Shaftesbury Avenue to the Shaftesbury Tavern. This pub has a great choice of local north London beers on tap and has a great room at the back which works well as a quiz venue, which has usually been my reason for visiting. I don’t live too far away so I can usually walk home from a night out here. They also often have a DJ on to liven up your night.\n\nAmersham Arms (388 New Cross Road, New Cross, SE14 6TY)\n\nWhile I used to live in Amersham, this pub is nowhere near its Buckinghamshire namesake. Located in New Cross in southeast London, the Amersham Arms has some fame as a grassroots music venue. The room in the back is where you can possibly catch the next big thing in music. There is then a DJ playing music in the early hours. A great place to go on a Friday night.\n\nThe Dickens Inn (Marble Quay, St Katharine’s Way, E1W 1UH)\n\nSimilar to the Churchill Arms, the exterior of the Dickens Inn is covered in flowers. Situated in St. Katherine’s Dock next to Tower Bridge, it has a great restaurant on the top floor, a pizzeria offering a more chilled vibe on the first floor and a cracking pub on the ground floor. A fantastic place to spend a warm summer’s evening, this pub was a former warehouse like the Old Salt Quay, and it had to be moved 70 metres to its present location. It is also one of the most famous pubs in London. According to their website, Katie Melua and Joan Rivers have visited previously (who knew!).\n\nThe King’s Arms (65 Newcomen Street, SE1 1YT)\n\nA cosy pub, found between London Bridge and Borough tube stations, it has a decent range of pub food and beers. I like this pub as its cosy atmosphere is great on an autumn or winter evening. Also a good meeting point if you’re going for an after-work drink around there, which I’ve done on several occasions.\n\nLeyton Star (116 High Road Leyton, Leyton, E15 2BX)\n\nI’ve been criticised for not having more pubs in the East End in this blog, so I was delighted to head to the Leyton Star, a short walk from Leyton tube station. It’s got a lovely big terrace outside which is good in the summer. There is also a great selection of beers and food (bit of a recurring theme isn’t it?) and it is also a great place to watch the football either on the big screens or to grab a pre-match pint before walking to watch Leyton Orient, whose ground is a short walk away.\n\nThe Lexington (96-98 Pentonville Road, Islington, N1 9JB)\n\nThis one is a cracker. The Lexington is a great pub located on Pentonville Road. Upstairs has live music and DJs playing great music, which is a great place to dance the night away. I’m personally a fan of White Heat which is an indie music night on a Friday, about the closest I can to Blast Off which used to be my favourite night out in Wolverhampton. Downstairs is a great bar with a lovely range of North London beers to work through. A great night out, I just hope it’s still there once the pandemic is over!\n\nThe Great Northern Railway Tavern (67 High Street, Hornsey, N8 7QB)\n\nHeading north to Hornsey, the GNRT is a spacious pub which offers a superb selection of craft beers which is very good considering it’s owned by one of the big breweries. It was built in 1897 and is Grade 2 Listed. It’s also a stones throw from Hornsey train station making it convenient for me as I can get a bus back to Archway directly.\n\nThe Palm Tree (127 Grove Road, Bethnal Green, E3 5BH)\n\nWe head back to the east with something special. The Palm Tree is Grade 2 Listed and was built in 1935. It is the sole survivor from the street during the Blitz. The interior hasn’t changed a bit, with the cash register being at least twice my age and photos of random long forgotten celebrities adorning the walls. There is also a limited selection of beers (just two if I remember right) which makes this place an oasis of an East End boozer in a sea of gentrification. The lights are also red to stop photographs, none of that modern technology, please! It’s next to Regents Canal, making it a good spot for a summer drink. But what makes this pub so special is the live jazz band that performs on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. I think the combined age of them must be around 300 but I have never seen such a brilliant band. They were a real experience, all having had illustrious careers which makes them all the more remarkable. There was even a write-up in The Independent a couple of years ago if you’d like to find out more about these incredible people. A super treat and a must-do when you get the chance.\n\nThe Pineapple (51 Leverton St, NW5 2NX)\n\nLocated on a side street in Kentish Town, The Pineapple is a cracking place to grab a pint. Owned by the same landlady as the Lady Hamilton from Volume Six, it is a favourite pub of current Labour leader Keir Starmer and there used to be a pub cat called Spongebob, however, he sadly passed away in March 2020. I love this pub because of its local feel to it, being tucked away and it feels like the customers are in there every week. A much-loved boozer.\n\nThe Black Prince (6 Black Prince Rd, SE11 6HS)\n\nFamous for appearing in the movie Kingsman: The Secret Service, this boozer in Kennington is tucked away just a few minutes walk from the station. It has a good selection of beers and food plus it has a beer garden which is always a plus for an inner city pub. The Tamesis Dock (see below) is at the other end of the street.\n\nThe Queen’s (26 Broadway Parade, N8 9DE)\n\nFound in Crouch End, The Queen’s has a gorgeous art nouveau interior which speaks to its history as a former hotel from the 1890s. The stained glass and dividers make it so special as place for a drink. The food is also excellent and is a cosy place to come in the winter months.\n\nTamesis Dock (Albert Embankment, SE1 7TY)\n\nNot your usual pub, this is actually on an old champagne barge which used to go between Paris and the Netherlands but has been in London for the past twenty years. It’s a great spot to watch the river traffic go by on a sunny day and to party the night away if you go later in the evening, just make sure you don’t get seasick if the tide is in!\n\nThe Archway Tavern (1 Navigator Square, Archway, N19 3TD)\n\nRecently reopened after a few years of closure, The Archway Tavern is back in a big way. Offering a huge range of locally brewed beers from the Muswell Hill and Two Tribes breweries to name two, this pub also was featured on the cover of The Kink’s 1971 album Muswell Hillbilly (despite being down the road in Archway). The new Navigator Square in front of the pub, it makes for a cracking space to have a pint in the sun and has reinvigorated the area. I would also recommend going for pizza at Crudough next door, which was featured in volume two of my Favourite Restaurants in London blog.\n\nBoleyn Tavern (1 Barking Rd, E6 1PW)\n\nThis famous East End pub has also recently had a refurbishment. The old-style dividers have been put back, offering a more intimate feel to the pub. It was constructed around the same time as The Queen’s (see above) and there is some similarity in their architectural styles. The dining room at the back is also gorgeous, giving the interior that extra magic. No doubt it will still be popular with West Ham fans on match days as their old ground is literally a stone’s throw away. Gandhi also visited in 1931 during his stay in London. He is said to have discussed football and politics with the locals whilst drinking cream soda.\n\nThe King’s Arms (25 Roupell St, SE1 8TB)\n\nI love this pub because it’s like stepping back in time. Located on a street corner just a couple of minutes walk from Waterloo station, it’s actually on a street that hasn’t changed much from the 1800s. Its rows of terraced housing make you feel like it could easily be the Victorian days. But don’t let that put you off, the pub has a Thai kitchen and a great choice of beers, plus a large back room in case you’re struggling for space. If you’ve missed your train from Waterloo, this is absolutely the place to go!\n\nJP"
