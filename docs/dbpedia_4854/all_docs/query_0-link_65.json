Branch office at New York City. COPYRIGHT, 1921, BY RAND MCNALLY & 00, • https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis EXPLANATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS COUPONS MUST BE USED All business forwarded to attorneys must be accompanied by the coupon provided for that purpose, opposite beginning of the List, and the notification coupon must be properly filled out and forwarded to the Publishers at Chicago within thirty days after the forwarding of the claim to the Attorney. Additional books of coupons furnished upon request, free of charge. NATURE OF BOND TIME LIMIT OF BONDS The Publishers of this Directory have paid for and have in their possession a Surety Bond of The American Surety Company of New York on all Attorneys whose names appear in the following List (excepting those listed under the heading \"Foreign Attorneys\"), made to them as Trustee for the Forwarders of Business to Bonded Attorneys in the Rand McNally List of Attorneys. A copy of the bond appears immediately hereafter. Every effort has been made to make the bond simple in its phraseology and clear as to its meaning. Neither the Publishers nor The American Surety Company of New York wish to have any misunderstandings as to the nature of this bond. Each attorney whose name is published in this edition of the Directory (excepting those listed under heading \"Foreign Attorneys\") is bonded until his name shall be eliminated from any subsequent edition (and three months thereafter), and anyone making use of this List after a new edition is published will be doing so on his own responsibility and without any liability on the part of The American Surety Company of New York under the bond, unless the attorney's name appears in such subsequent edition. CHANGES The next edition of this List will be that of \"January, 1922\" and it will contain a AND revision of this list. Upon publication of a later edition of this List the forwarder must be REVISION guided by such changes as this later edition may show. The Publishers may disOF LIST continue the name of any attorney at any time upon notice to the subscribers. Every effort will be made to advise and protect forwarders. Each attorney in this List (excepting those listed under heading \"Foreign AttorAMOUNT neys \") is bonded by The American Surety Company of New York for the sum of OF two thousand dollars. Any one having business to forward to any attorney in excess BOND of the amount of the bond on said attorney. may upon application in writing have said attorney's bond increased without cost to the forwarder. THE SURETY The Publishers have caused this bond to be taken out with a Surety Company, because, on account of the nature of its business, it is in a better position than are the Publishers to protect subscribers in case of embezzlement of moneys collected by Attorneys. The American Surety Company of New York (Capita! and Surplus over $6,000.000) has been chosen because of its exceptional strength and its promptness in meeting just claims. Rand McNally & Company is a corporation under the laws of the State of Illinois This Company is your THE (capital fully paid $1,000,000), whose head office is in Chicago. TRUSTEE representative and will always act in your interests. COMPLAINTS In case of complaints about service, we will endeavor to adjust the difficulties, but when we write to a lawyer about a complaint, he must remember that we have not taken the side of the complainant, but, having heard only one side of the case, ar~ asking for his. 1720 IN CASE OF LOSS In case of loss, subscribers must forward a statement of their loss, showing items, dates, etc., direct to the Chicago branch of The American Surety Company of New York, Continental and Commercial National Bank Building, Chicago, notifying the Publishers at Chicago at the same time that they have done so and sending copy of the statement to the Surety at 100 Broadway, New York City. PAYMENT Payment for losses under these bonds will be made by the Surety to the Trustee. FOR The Trustee will immediately forward to the Subscriber the full amount of such payment. LOSSES FEES In no case does The American Surety Company of New York or the Publishers endeavor to enter into any contract with forwarders to regulate fees, to make any special arrangements with attorneys, or to guarantee against errors in judgment, etc., on the part of attorneys. We have endeavored to give you a high-class list of attorneys, who we have reason to believe will be fair in their charges and above the ordinary ability in caring for any legal business that may be sent to them. When money is once collected by an attorney and it is not properly accounted for, this bond is intended to reimburse the forwarder for moneys lost, according to the terms thereof. We suggest to our lawyers the rates recommended by The Commercial Law League of America as fair and equitable under ordinary conditions. They are as follows: 15 per cent on the first $300; 8 per cent on the excess of $300 to $1,000; 4 per cent on the excess of $1,000: minimurn fee of $5.00; on items of $10.00 or less, 50 per cent: minimum fee for suit, $7.50 in addition to the percentage fee. When asking for a credit report, subscribers should always enclose at least fifty cents CREDIT REPORTS with such request. Our attorneys do not make free credit reports. BANK TOWNS ONLY An effort has been made to give a good lawyer at every important County Seat because as a general rule the best lawyers reside at County Seats and are in the best position to handle all business throughout the county. This List covers all towns with banks. Towns having no banks are carried in the \"Accessible\" list in a separate part of the Bankers Directory. Lawyers are urged to acknowledge claims promptly and to advise forwarders occaof what is being done with claim or what the chances ;:lr~ for collect:on, because sionally TO OUR LAWYERS the forwarder is far away and being human, likes to keep in t ..,uch with his affairs. Remember he is your client and a reputation among your clients for good, thoughtful service builds up a business. Neglect of correspondence affects vour professional standin~. If you do not reply to letters promptly, your client guesses at the reason, and his guess may not be pleasant. Remember that your business is not the only business that the lawyer has. Be con- siderate. He cannot spend all his time writing to you. Don't forget that some collections TO require time and patience and tact on the part of the lawyer. Be explicit in your instrucFORWARDERS tions and remember that the \"laborer is worthy of his hire.\" OUR AIM USE THIS LIST The Rand-McNally Bankers Directory and Bankers Register with List of Attorneys has the largest paid subscription list of any similar publication. I ts subscribers represent more capital than those of all other lists combined. We hope to be able to bring our lawyers, our banks, and our commercial houses together and to build up a big community of interest to the mutual benefit of all. To this end, we earnestly hope all our subscribers will use these bonded lawyers whenever it is possible. Business begets business, and lawyers should co-operate with each other. The number of bonded lawyers will be increased in each edition. SUGGESSuggestions which will cause an increase in the value of this List to subscribers will be TIONS welcomed by the publishers.
