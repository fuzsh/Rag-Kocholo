        "text": "APR I L 28, 2024 B o s t o n S u n d a y G l o b e C25 Obituaries By Harrison Smith WASHINGTON POST She was a discus thrower from Czechoslovakia. He was a hammer thrower from the United States. Together, Olga Fikotová and Harold “Hal” Connolly were a storybook couple, taking some of the chill out of the Cold War when they fell in love and each won a gold medal at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne. When they married in Prague months later, overcoming Communist red tape and criticism from government officials who deemed her a traitor, some 30,000 well-wishers and curiosity seekers filled historic Old Town Square, straining to catch a glimpse of the couple before they left for the United States. “Love Triumphs Over Ideology,” Life magazine declared in a headline. “Fate,” Ms. Connolly later told the Financial Times, “used Harold and I to illustrate that we can all choose whether to quarrel or be happy together.” The marriage didn’t last — Ms. Connolly and her husband separated after 16 years, finalizing their divorce in 1974 — but she built a new life for herself in the United States, embracing activist causes as a feminist and environmentalist even as she continued setting discus records. She competed in four more Olympics, all as an American, and was elected flag bearer by her fellow athletes for the 1972 Opening Ceremonies in Munich, becoming the rare Olympian to win gold for one country and carry the flag for another. “The Olympic experience in every respect opened the world for me,” said Ms. Connolly, who died April 12 at 91. “It made me what I am.” Her gold medal-winning victory in the Olympics was all the more remarkable given that she was still a relative novice in her sport — she had thrown the discus for less than two years before arriving in Melbourne at age 24 — and had an uneasy relationship with Czechoslovak authorities, even before she fell in love with someone from across the Iron Curtain. Growing up, she recalled, she had been kicked out of school because she was from a “reactionary family.” In Melbourne, she was reportedly the only member of her country’s team who had declined membership in the Communist Party, risking retribution because of her Protestant religious beliefs. An only child, Olga Fikotová was born in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia and now the Czech Republic, on Nov. 13, 1932. Her father served in the securit y d e tail f or Tomáš Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia; according to the family, he was persecuted during the Nazi occupation and was sent to prison for two years after Communists came to power in 1948. During that time, Ms. Connolly and her mother moved to a small town outside Prague, where her mother worked in the coal mines. Ms. Connolly, who stood 5- foot-11, had by then established herself as a gifted athlete. She competed in international basketball and handball tournaments while spending part of each summer performing compulsory physical labor. Ms. Connolly set out to become an orthopedic surgeon and was s tudying medi c in e a t Charles University in Prague in 1954 when she began throwing the discus with encouragement from coach Otakar Jandera, a former Olympic hurdler. He introduced her to the fundamentals of the sport while playing “The Blue Danube” on a loop over the loudspeakers, teaching her how to spin in time to the waltz. The next year, she had her breakthrough at an international track meet in Poland. She finished 28th out of 28 throwers but was approached during a workout the next day by Nina Ponomareva, a champion discus thrower who had earned the Soviet Union its first Olympic gold medal. Taking pity on Ms. Connolly, she offered tips on her technique and instructed the young Czech athlete to bulk up. “She told me that if I followed her advice, she would see me the next year in Melbourne,” Ms. Connolly recalled. Ponomareva was right: The next year, Ms. Connolly won the gold medal after setting what was then a women’s Olympic record, with a throw of nearly 176 feet 2 inches. Ponomareva, the reigning Olympic champion, came in third. “She was mad as hell,” Ms. Connolly said. Ms. Connolly had planned to return to Prague to complete her medical degree after the Games. But soon after her arrival in Melbourne, she met Harold, the first American to win gold in the hammer throw since Fred Tootell in 1924. The athletes almost literally bumped into one another, Ms. Connolly recalled, striking up a conversation after she accidentally collided with another American while bounding out of the equipment trailer. Speaking broken English and German, they developed a relationship over the objections of Czechoslovak delegation leaders. Harold promised to come to Prague to marry her after the Games ended and arrived in the capital in early 1957 while visiting Europe as a goodwill ambassador for the State Department. Although Ms. Connolly said she had hoped to continue competing for Czechoslovakia after moving to the United States — her husband sold one of his hammers to finance their trip across the Atlantic — the country’s Olympic committee sent her a letter effectively disowning her. She gained US citizenship and helped her parents move to Southern California, where she and her husband settled in 1959 and were welcomed as celebrities. Discus champion Olga Fikotová Connolly, was in Olympics romance By Michael S. Rosenwald NEW YORK TIMES Michael C. Jensen, an economist and Harvard Business School professor whose evangelizing for stock options, golden parachutes, and leveraged buyouts helped reshape modern capitalism and empower Wall Street’s greed-is-good era, died on April 2 at his home in Sarasota, Florida. He was 84. The death was confirmed by his daughter Natalie JensenNoll. She did not specify a cause. Even before he embarked on a peculiar late-career intellectual partnership with Werner Erhard, the controversial self-help guru who created est, Mr. Jensen’s colleagues considered him among the most freethinking and divisive economists of his generation. “Mike was a kind of born proselytizer,” Eugene F. Fama, a University of Chicago professor and Nobel laureate in economics who collaborated with Mr. Jensen, said in an interview. “He was very sure o f himsel f in terms of his ideas being correct and, you know, pathbreaking.” They were also incendiary. In his book “The Golden Passport: Harvard Business School, the Limits of Capitalism, and the Moral Failure of the MBA Elite” (2017), journalist Duff McDonald called Mr. Jensen an “instrument of intellectual violence” who “created a Frankenstein that no one knows how to kill.” Mr. Jensen began his academic career in the late 1960s, when a seismic shift in economic theory was underway. For decades, students studying management — especially at Harvard Business School — were taught that executives (and their companies) should have a social conscience. Then, in 1970, economist and free-market theorist Milton Friedman published his groundbreaking essay “A Friedman Doctrine — The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits,” in The New York Times Magazine. A business that “takes seriously its responsibilities for providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution,” Fr i edman wrot e , i s “preaching pure and unadulterated socialism.” Mr. Jensen, a free-market adherent himself, endorsed Friedman’s essay. But he detected a hole in the argument, which he explored in a seminal paper, “Theory of Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure,” written in 1976 with William H. Meckling while they were both professors at the University of Rochester. The paper explored the misalignment of interests between managers and the companies’ owners, the stockholders, which they said made it impossible for firms to exist solely for increasing profits. To align the interests of both parties, Mr. Jensen encouraged the use of stock options and equity as primary forms of compensation. He endorsed taking on debt to buy other companies because loan payments and reduced free cash flow would force executives to better manage costs. And he blessed golden parachutes — the large payments executives receive if they are forced to leave after a merger or the outright sale of a company. “Think about the problem in the following way: Top-level managers and the board of directors act as stockholders’ agents in deals involving hundreds of millions of dollars,” he wrote in Harvard Business Review. “If the alternative providing the highest value to stockholders is sale to another company and the retirement of the current management team, stockholders do not want the managers to block a bid in fear of losing their own jobs.” Executives walk away with their pockets comfortably lined with cash, the theory goes, but so do investors. “He was clearly some kind of genius,” said Nicholas Lemann, the former dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University, who interviewed Mr. Jensen for his book “Transaction Man: The Rise of the Deal and the Decline of the American Dream” (2019). “I think he’s much more important in shaping the America we live in now than most people recognize.” That shaping largely transpired a t Har vard Business School, which Mr. Jensen joined in 1985, at the height of President Ronald Reagan’s pro-business economic policies. Two years later, in Oliver Stone’s movie “Wall Street,” Michael Douglas portrayed a fictional corporate raider, Gordon Gekko, who declared: “Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works.” Later in life, after Wall Street had been besieged by corporate stock option scandals and politicians derided excessive compensation packages, Mr. Jensen acknowledged that his ideas had spiraled out of control. He told The New Yorker in 2002 that basing compensation so heavily on options incentivized executives to lie about financial results. Stock options had become “managerial heroin,” he said; what the business world lacked was integrity. Around 2012, with Erhard, he founded the Erhard-Jensen Ontological/Phenomenological Initiative. They offered weeklong seminars on leadership, which they taught in far-flung places, typically near beaches. The cost: $3,000 per person. Lemann attended one in Bermuda. “I was involved in reorganizing the financial industry,” Mr. Jensen said onstage, according to Lemann’s book. But by then, he said, the world of finance was “staggeringly bad,” adding “I’m sickened by it.” Michael C.

Age 98, of Bedford, died on February 29, 2024, followingabrief illness. Born in 1925, Paddy was the daughter of the late William Henry Vanderbilt, III, former governor of Rhode Island and Emily O’Neill Davies. She was raised in New York City and Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Paddy served as a vibrant career volunteer with a deep interest in onthe-ground science. She developed a keen aptitude for math and science. After attending Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia, she enrolled as one of only seven women in a freshman class of 728 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she earnedadegree in chemistry in the class of 1945. It was there she met her future husband, Jeptha Homer Wade of Cleveland, Ohio. A lifelong land conservationist and naturalist, she and her husband, Jeptha, were instrumental in protecting two important forest properties in Georgia – containing significant old-growth stands where research is conducted on the ecology and preservation of the longleaf pine/ wiregrass ecosystem. In 1983, Paddy, along with the directors of seven Boston museums, co-founded the Museum Institute for Teaching Science to help inspire and engage elementary school teachers in inquiry-based science learning at a critical time when interest in technology and science was on the wane. In 2019, the organization changed its name to the Wade Institute for Science Education to reflect its ongoing mission and honor Paddy’s leadership. Paddy remained actively involved with her alma mater, MIT. She served for about 30 years on the Corporation, the board of trustees of MIT. Paddy was also the second woman to serve as president of MIT’s Alumni Association. While on the Corporation, Paddy served on a variety of committees, including its Executive and Development Committees as well as its Joint Advisory Committee with MIT students. She was the Corporation’s representative to the MIT Community Service Fund and served for many years as its co-chair. She was inducted into the Massachusetts Hall of Fame for Science Educators for professional contributions to science education. Paddy was a loyal supporter of Manomet, an international organization that uses science-driven solutions to improve ecosystem health and human well-being, for more than four decades. She served as Chair of the Board from 1993 to 2010, during which time she reinforced her unwavering focus on science. She was an active member of the Board until her recent death. Paddy was a strong supporter of Mass Audubon throughout her life, beginning in 1949. It was there she developed her passion for birding alongside William Drury, a renowned ornithologist. She served on its board of directors for 23 years. She worked diligently to advance their mission in education, conservation, research and advocacy. For her efforts, she was presented the Allan Morgan Award for Lifetime Achievement. Paddy also had strong ties to Zoo New England, where she managed the Children’s Zoo concession stand and nurtured a baby gorilla. She was a trustee of the Eaglebrook School in Deerfield, MA. Paddy was an active Bedford resident since moving there in 1952. She engaged in town politics, serving on various local committees. Her church, St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Bedford, was very important to her, especially their outreach programs for community service. The project in Haiti was particularly meaningful to Paddy. She was predeceased by her husband of sixty years and sister Anne Hartwell. She is survived by her children, William Garretson Wade and his wife, Donna of Unity, ME, Emily Wade Hughey of Brookline, MA, Randall Hand Wade and his wife, Agnes of Amherst, MA and Rebecca Wade Comstock and her husband, Richard of Chappaqua, NY; her sister, Elsie Aidinoff of New York, NY; and brother, William Henry Vanderbilt of Ketchum, Idaho and his wife, Ann; ten grandchildren and two greatgrandchildren.

(The violin sold in 2013 for 1.1 million pounds, or about $1.3 million.) The reasons for seeking out items from the Titanic vary widely, but for Probst it is the stories about the victims and survivors that motivate him to keep collecting and to keep an eye on auctions. “There’s a few people out Collector Tony Probst (top left) and Titanic items that were up for auction: a pocketbook (top), a set of cuff links (above), and the violin case of bandleader Wallace Hartley (left). By Derrick Bryson Taylor NEW YORK TIMES Tony Probst’s passion for the Titanic is unwavering. Since the mid-1990s, he has amassed hundreds of artifacts from the ship’s maiden voyage in 1912 , including a lifebo at plaque, china, sheet music, and an array of personal documents. “I believe I’m the only person on planet Earth who has every piece of paper for one individual to get on board Titanic,” Probst, 64, said proudly this week. His collection is sometimes on display at the audio and visual store he runs with his sons in the Bay Area of California, but it has also toured prominent spaces, including the National Geographic Museum in Washington; the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, Calif.; and the Titanic museums in Branson, Mo., and Pigeon Forge, Tenn. Probst’s enthusiasm for the Titanic — which puts him somewhere between a collector and historian, he said — makes him part of a small but zealous community seeking out memorabilia from the ship, which sank after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean, killing 1,500 people. Henry Aldridge & Son Ltd, an auction house in southwest England, was to host an auction on Saturday of Titanic and other shipping and transport memorabilia. Among the more than 250 items for sale is a black-andthere with very, very deep pockets and, you know, nowadays they get all the prime pieces,” Probst said. “I’m not in that category. I’m really more into preserving stories.” Probst, who said he was recuperating from a couple of big purchases, does not have anything on his wish list at the moment but planned to study the auction catalog anyway. “I really want to go after things that I want,” he said, or items that he could lease to museums. “I call it my retirement account, in a way, because I get the principal and that goes up in value,” he added. “But in the meantime, I get to lease it out and make a little money.” Henry Aldridge & Son has been holding Titanic-themed sales biannually since the late 1990s, according to Andrew Aldridge, the managing director of the auction house. Aldridge said bidders often had their own niches and individual motivations. “Some just collect Titanic memorabilia, per se,” he said. “But others go a little bit deeper and they work into specifics. Specific passengers, specific classes. People that come from specific areas. We’ll have people that just collect things from Scandinavian passengers.” The Titanic-collecting community is fairly small, particularly at the higher end of purchases, said David Scott-Beddard, chair of the British Titanic Society. Competition for hot-ticket items can sometimes be fierce. “To a certain extent, it’s how much do I wan t i t and how much am I prepared to spend on it — without the wife finding out,” he said. There was not much concern over items disappearing from the public view after being purchased, Scott-Beddard added. He said the community was very fortunate that a majority of collectors, even those shopping at the six- and seven-figure levels, were generous enough to allow their pieces to be displayed for the general public. “Titanic is probably, next to Noah’s Ark, history’s most famous ship,” said Charles Haas, president of the Titanic International Society. Some enthusiasts are driven by the search for increasingly rare artifacts carried off the ship by passengers, others by psychological connections that collectors sometimes make , viewing the disaster through the eyes of victims and survivors. Haas said he was unsure whether a day would come when deman d for Titanic items waned. “The Titanic story has already lasted 112 years,” he said. “And while there are people out there who say, ‘The ship sank, get over it,’ it has so much builtin drama to it that the younger generations are still quite fascinated by it.” Titanic treasures captivate collectors, but they need deep pockets INGRID PROBST VIA NEW YORK TIMES HENRY ALDRIDGE & SON PHOTOS VIA NEW YORK TIMES\n\nAddress YOURREALESTATEGUIDETOBUYING,SELLING,LIVING BOSTON SUNDAY GLOBE APRIL 28, 2024 | BOSTON.COM/REALESTATE H ONLINE RENTING: WHEREARE PRICES FALLING?

Around 1 or 2 a.m. on Feb. 18, Miles, 29, was walking home from a friend’s house when she spotted the officers peering into the Dunkin’, which sits across from the State House. As she entered her lobby, Miles was hit with a foul smell. When she awoke the next morning, the stench was exponentially worse. “This overwhelming smell of corpse began to take over our whole building,” said Miles, a marketing coordinator for a women’s health startup, who had to leave the fifth-floor unit for a few days. The smell was worst in the lobby, mere steps from the Dunkin’ next door, which is closed on weekends. Miles was worried that something or someone had died in the vicinity. “We have quite a few older people in the building,” Miles said. “Thankfully, they were all accounted for.” Dunkin’ did not respond to requests for comment, there is no police report on the incident, and it’s unclear what caused the smell and where it originated. The management company was called in to add deodorizers and investigate the smell emanating from the basement the residential building shares with Dunkin’. While the stench eventually subsided, residents were never told what caused the olfactory assault that crept up to the penthouse, above Miles’s home. Sure, being able to grab a medium regular downstairs may be convenient, but living in the vicinity of Dunkin’ can cause more problems than what fits into a box of Munchkins. And remarkable benefits.

Ellement GLOBE STAFF Y ou can walk down the street to Berlin Farms to buy your produce. So how do you like them apples? We ask that without Will Hunting’s sarcasm. You won’t need the sustenance to work on this stately 124-year-old Colonial in Berlin. It is move-in ready after undergoing an extensive renovation by its current owners, a general contractor and his artistic wife. Located in the Central Massachusetts town of Berlin — (pronounced “Burr-lin,” with the emphasis on the first syllable, per Town Hall) — the home’s nondescript exterior is a gentle counterpoint to the bright and warm color choices of its interior. The home, which sits on 1.84 acres, is positioned well back from Central Street. The driveway ends near a door that opens into the basement mudroom. A farmer’s porch runs across the left side of the home, and a traditional front entry holds court on the right. Behind that front door is a long foyer (22 feet), a hint that the room sizes will be substantial. A door on the right next to the stairs opens into a 220-square foot living room with deep-blue walls, three doublehung windows, and a ceiling fan. The flooring throughout much of the home is a refinished wideplanked pine, much of it original to the home. (The kitchen flooring matches the original.) Back out in the foyer and behind the stairs sits a 196-square-foot bedroom painted a bright orange-yellow. It has two double-hung windows, a wide closet, and the laundry setup, which is built into an alcove. The bedroom/laundry space is next to a half bath with a wide soapstone sink ideal for combating clothing stains. Two closets are ready to hide all the things a homeowner collects, from extra quilts to unwanted gifts from well-meaning aunts to holiday décor. An entryway off the foyer reveals an open floor plan that combines the family room, dining area, and kitchen in 586 square feet. The family room has a pair of windows that look out to the hilly front lawn and two that offer a view of the screen porch. The door to the farmer’s porch and a soffit visually separate the family room and dining area. Eat in the firelight from the dining room’s gas fireplace. Light also comes from a double-hung window, recessed lighting, and a wrought-iron chandelier. A French door opens to a stairwell down to the mudroom. The kitchen sits under a vaulted ceiling, but the showstopper is the rustic island with its green cabinetry, corbels, seating for two, and wide-plank pine top. An alcove in the island hides the trash can — unless you have a Labrador retriever. The kitchen also has high-end stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, and white raised-panel cabinets with black pulls. There are four windows: a pair over the sink, one looking out to the side yard and driveway, and one that offers a view of the screen porch (180 square feet), accessed via a slider. Upstairs, the home’s remaining three bedrooms and the main full bath radiate off a long hallway. The primary suite offers a carpeted bedroom of 207 square feet with crown molding, a ceiling fan, four windows, and a walk-in closet that opens to a 180-square-foot attic storage space. The en-suite bath has ceramic tile flooring, a white double vanity with a long Carrara marble counter, recessed lighting, and a tub/shower combination that has a curtain. The largest of the two secondary bedrooms on this floor clocks it at 196 square feet and offers blue walls, a ceiling fan, three windows, carpeting, and a double-door closet. Its smaller counterpart (143 square feet) features walls painted a burnt orange, two windows, carpet, and a double-door closet. They share a full bath that has a mahoganytoned single vanity topped with Carrara marble, wide-plank pine flooring, and a tub-shower combination. The basement level includes storage areas and a poured-concrete floor. Tammy Arbour of Lamacchia Realty in Hudson is the listing agent. As of press time, an offer had been accepted on the property.

That’s who gets hurt the most.” South End resident Nancy Farrington has lived in her condo in a luxury, full-service building since 2021, when she was able to secure a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 2.5 percent. Farrington eventually plans to move back to her hometown of Charleston, S.C., but she has little faith that her condo will sell swiftly when it goes on the market this summer. “These days, who is going to take on an 8 percent mortgage?” Farrington said. “I was fully in the camp of three rate cuts this year, but I’m not counting on any rate decreases and the Fed doing anything. That makes me very pessimistic, but then again, I’m a Catholic and a Red Sox fan, so I’m always pessimistic.” Life changes take a back seat A survey out last month from John Burns Research & Consulting polled prospective home buyers on what was holding them back from purchasing a home. Waiting for mortgage rates to decline was the top factor, eclipsing “waiting for a life stage change” as the No. 1 reason for the first time since the consulting firm began polling buyers in March 2023. “Historically, the number one reason that households move is life change,” said Alex Thomas, a senior research analyst at John Burns. “I’ve heard people call it the four D’s: death, divorce, diamonds, and diapers. That’s generally why people move. It’s not always primarily financially motivated.” Even mortgage rates hovering around the 7 percent mark are well below the north-of-18 percent figures seen in the 1980s, but buyers then were facing significantly lower home prices than today. Home prices broke records in March, according to the latest data from The Warren Group. Mortgage “rate lock” has several trickle-down effects, according to the FHFA: ‘Mortgage rate lock’ has prospective home buyers stuck ‘You’re going to pay more for the house . . . for the mortgage’ By Cameron Sperance GLOBE CORRESPONDENT The disparity between low mortgage rates that homeowners have on their current home and the significantly higher one they could get on a new property is turning US homeownership into a type of escape room from which millions can’t get out. Mortgage rates in mid-April jumped above 7 percent for the first time since November, a reminder of how they stubbornly remain elevated. Buyers were able to get 30-year fixed-rate mortgages below 3 percent as recently as 2021 — meaning rates have more than doubled in less than three years, according to Freddie Mac data. Ninety-six percent of buyers in the United States have a fixed-rate mortgage — and 63 percent of that group has a mortgage rate under 4 percent, according to a March report by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. That means a large buyer bloc simply can’t afford to move because, by trading their existing mortgage for a new one at today’s higher rates, homeowners would end up spending roughly $500 more per month under current financing terms. Ninety-two percent of Boston homeowners are experiencing mortgage “rate lock”; they are reluctant to give up their existing home and lower mortgage rate for a new property at today’s higher costs, according to Zillow data. “It’s pretty hard to trade up today. You’re going to pay more for the house, and you’re going to pay much more for the mortgage,” said Elaine Bannigan, a broker with Douglas Elliman. “That’s a pretty hard pill to swallow for that R Buyers can’t upsize or downsize R A lack of listings can drive up home prices, as people looking to buy and sell in Massachusetts have witnessed. Beyond the 30-year fixed But there are potential solutions and strategies for those willing to break from the mind-set that a 30-year fixedrate mortgage is the only way to buy a home. Today’s shoppers fall into three buckets, according to Bannigan: firsttime, trade-up, and luxury buyers. Luxury buyers often can pay in cash. Tradeup buyers can afford to stay put because their purchase is often discretionary. First-time buyers are changing their strategy. “They desperately want to buy, but they have had to readjust their expectations because they can afford less today than they would have at lower rates,” Bannigan said. “There’s such little inventory at their price points that these buyers have concluded that this is not their last house. Therefore, to make a plunge into the market, they recognize interest rates can’t stay this high forever.” Mortgage rates may be volatile, but home prices are steadily rising. It’s better to get in today, even at a less-thandesirable mortgage rate, rather than wait on the sidelines for prices to creep even higher, the thinking goes. These buyers are looking at different financing options, including adjustablerate mortgages that can be refinanced at — it is hoped — a lower rate when things settle. Relief won’t come overnight, but there are some signs of wiggle room to mortgage rate lock. “Everybody was waiting for this moment for the rates to come down, which really never happened,” said Susan Bevilacqua, a Wellesley-based realtor with Douglas Elliman who has seen buyer activity pick up in recent months. “My sense is that people are just tired of waiting, and they’re doing what they need to do to make it work.” Baby boomers who aren’t necessarily luxury home buyers — especially those in more affordable housing markets — also can be less vulnerable to rate lock because they’ve already built equity in their homes and paid off their mortgages. About 11 percent of baby boomer homeowners in the Boston metropolitan area are unaffected by rate lock, while nearly 38 of those in Pittsburgh are immune to it, according to Zillow. “At the start of this year, we saw a big increase in new listings in our data,” said Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist at Zillow. “Our research shows that the increase in new listings was mostly pronounced in the kind of retirement community where you have a lot of baby boomers who are mortgage debt free.” An increase in buying and selling in high-priced Wellesley and retirement communities around the United States might not be music to the ears of pricesensitive or younger buyers. But there is also an expectation that more affordable homes will eventually start to come back to the market as the broader buyer pool coalesces around a new normal. That likely won’t be a sub-3 percent mortgage rate. Rates might not come crashing down, but hopefully they won’t surge as quickly as they have in the past of couple years, either. “If we see less volatility, that’s going to be a good thing for the housing market,” Divounguy said.

Deeply woven into the fabric of New England, the chain’s presence can have a profound effect on the real estate that surrounds it. In their 2015 book, “Zillow Talk: The New Rules of Real Estate,” Stan Humphries, then the platform’s chief economist, and Spencer Rascoff, then CEO, wrote that homes near Dunkin’s and Starbucks have appreciated 80 percent since 1997. “Between 1997 and 2012, homes now located near Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts followed similar historical trajectories, substantially outpacing the overall home value appreciation,” they wrote. This was similarly noted in a 2018 Harvard Business School study examining housing price data and Yelp reviews, which determined that the entry of Starbucks and other cafes into a neighborhood is indicative of housing price growth. Katherine Kranenburg, a luxury marketing specialist and content creator, calls this the “Starbucks Effect” and said it’s a “total bonus” for real estate. “It builds a sense of community. You find out about things at a coffee shop,” Kranenburg said. “Some of the top people that I’ve gone to conferences with, if they’re traveling and they want to uDUNKIN' Continued from Page H1 know an area, they will go and sit at the coffee shop.” Samantha Stumpo lives next to a Dunkin’ and across the street from a Starbucks on West Broadway in South Boston, and hits one of the two daily. (“I eat a doughnut every day, but nobody believes me,” she said.) As a realtor, she believes having a restaurant establishment close by is better than open retail, which can make people feel “uncomfortable.” As a Bostonian, having both places nearby makes her “feel at home.” Of course, the benefits of living in the proximity of Dunkin’ aren’t New England-specific. Sarene Leeds, professional writer and host of the podcast “Emotional Abuse is Real,” lives in White Plains, N.Y., across from a Dunkin’ inside a Citgo station. Her 7-year-old daughter, Diana, loves the occasional visit to Dunkin’ for a chocolate-frosted donut with rainbow sprinkles. When the family visited Boston, they made sure to snap Diana’s photo in front of the Dunkin’ on Washington Street in Downtown Crossing. “She was like, ‘I really want to go there,’” Leeds said, “so we took a picture of her there and got her a donut. It was really special.” Despite the convenience, there are downsides to living so close to Dunkin’. Derek Camara, 36, is occasionally awoken between 3:30 and 4:30 a.m. by a dump truck attempting to fit down the alley to empty the garbage at the Dunkin’ behind his Dorchester home. Because a chain-link gate was installed at the alley’s entrance, drivers have a difficult time maneuvering their way into the space. “It’s literally a scene from ‘Austin Powers,’” said Camara, referencing the fictitious British spy’s attempt to perform a three-point turn. “I want to lose my mind.” Residents who live near Dunkin’ drive-through locations also must deal with traffic. Jillian McGrath, 29, found herself trapped in her parking space on Christmas Day because the drive-through line for a Dunkin’ stretched down the length of her Fall River street. “You would think people were home, but no, everybody’s out trying to get their coffee,” said McGrath, who works at a different Dunkin’, but hopes to attend medical school. “I was able to pull out after like 10 minutes.” In addition to the stench that overtook her building, or the time a pipe burst “and it looked like a swimming pool in our basement,” Miles said her “biggest gripe” is with the Dunkin’ customers “who have relieved themselves on their doorstep.” Because her home is so close to the Freedom Trail, tourists mistakenly assume that the Dunkin’ has a public bathroom. As a result, events like the Boston Marathon or Patriots and Red Sox parades result in discoveries of human waste on the doorstep. “It’s just sort of expected at those times that we find Dunkin’ cups full of urine or feces,” said Miles, who noted that it’s tourists and sports revelers she spots relieving themselves on her stoop. “We see quite a bit of vomit, too.” While there are pros and cons of living next to a Dunkin’, everyone we spoke to noted one thing: It’s extremely convenient. Kyle Hemingway, 36, a creative strategist, previously lived diagonally across from the Dunkin’ inside the New Store on the Block on Dorchester Avenue. Every morning, he’d glance out the window and witness the distinct New England beauty of a bunch of people with cigarettes in one hand and Dunkin’ cups in the other, watching the Keno numbers roll in through the window. If the line was so long it was streaming out the door, he’d skip his morning order. “That’s how I would gauge whether or not I was getting my coffee,” said Hemingway.
