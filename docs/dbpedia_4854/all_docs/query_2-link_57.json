We're looking forward to going back and playing them again.\n\n\"I thought they were the toughest team in the group and we've got to try to go back there and win for a second time.\"\n\nPhilippe Clement declared Rangers as underdogs for the first time since he became manager. Benfica sit joint-top of the Portuguese Primeira Liga table with rivals Sporting Lisbon, having played a game more.\n\nClement, who has dragged Rangers from seven points behind Celtic to two points clear of the Hoops at the top of the Scottish Premiership ahead of the visit of third-placed Hearts on Saturday, surveyed a difficult but winnable European tie.\n\n\"It is a really exciting challenge because it is a very good team,\" said the Belgian boss.\n\n\"I think it will be the first game since I have been here that we have been underdogs in a game. That is the reality. I don't see us as underdogs against Celtic. I see us as two teams at a similar level competing and so that is different to Benfica.\"\n\nAston Villa will meet Dutch giants Ajax in the last 16 of the Europa Conference League.\n\nThe Europa League final will take place in Dublin on May 22, with the Conference League final taking place in Athens a week later.\n\nLiverpool reached the knockout phase of Europe's second-tier competition by topping Group E.\n\nSparta are the reigning Czech champions and qualified for the knockout round play-off by finishing second in Group C.
