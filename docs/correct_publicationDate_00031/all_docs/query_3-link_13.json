        "text": "Share via:\n\nJohn Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris (1903 – 1969) nwas an English science fiction writer best known for his works published under the pen name John Wyndham, although he also used other combinations of his names, such as John Beynon and Lucas Parkes. Some of his works were set in post-apocalyptic landscapes. His best known works include The Day of the Triffids (1951), filmed in 1962 and The Midwich Cuckoos (1957), filmed in 1960 as Village of the Damned and again in 1990 under the same title.\n\nJohn Wyndham’s reputation rests mainly on the first four of the novels published in his lifetime under that name.The Day of the Triffids remains his best-known work, but some readers consider that The Chrysalids was really his best. This is set in the far future of a post-nuclear dystopia where women’s fertility is compromised and they are severely oppressed if they give birth to “mutants”. David Mitchell, author of Cloud Atlas, wrote of it: “One of the most thoughtful post-apocalypse novels ever written. Wyndham was a true English visionary, a William Blake with a science doctorate.”\n\nThe ideas in The Chrysalids are echoed in The Handmaid’s Tale, whose author, Margaret Atwood, has acknowledged Wyndham’s work as an influence. She wrote an introduction to a new edition of Chocky in which she states that the intelligent alien babies in The Midwich Cuckoos entered her dreams.\n\nJohn Wyndham – First Editions Identification Guide\n\nNote: This list only includes works published prior to 1977.\n\nJohn Wyndham – First Printing Dust Jacket Identification Points\n\nGallery of First state Dust Jackets of Wyndham’s works. Only includes the first appearance in book form. Either the UK or US edition and does not include later printings.\n\nReference:"
