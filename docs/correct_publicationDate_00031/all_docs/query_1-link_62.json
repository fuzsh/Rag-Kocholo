        "text": "In 2044, a major nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the West wipes out most of the population. Inhabitants of the Southern Hemisphere—virtually the only survivors of humanity—call it the “Great Northern War”. Only after hundreds of years, with radioactivity going down, do expeditions from the south start carefully exploring and preparing to re-colonise the ravaged northern hemisphere.\n\nBrazil is left as the main world power, which then claims that “Space is a province of Brazil”. However, Australia eventually emerges as a serious rival. Consequently, English and Portuguese become contenders for the position of the major worldwide (eventually, Solar System-wide) language.\n\nEventually, space explorers break away from the tutelage of both earthbound powers and establish themselves as a major third power, called simply “Space”."
