        "text": "“Ticker Troon emerged from his final interview filled with an emulsion of astonishment, elation, respect, and conviction that he needed refreshment.”\n\nI was reading the other day about NASA’s Artemis Project, which intends to get people (the next man, and the first woman) onto the surface of the moon by 2025. It feels strange, sometimes, that the idea of travelling through space feels like something from our future, when no one’s been up to the moon for fifty years. Space travel is, for us right now, part of history. Time to turn to fiction instead.\n\nThe Troon family all have an innate desire to explore space. Ever since the first planes, one member of the family has been at the forefront of improvements, determined to push further outward. For every giant leap of mankind, a Troon is along for the ride. The Outward Urge charts five moments in time when humans are setting out for a new challenge, be it heading to the space station, the moon, Mars, Venus or beyond.\n\nIn one, we see Ticker Troon head to the first space station to orbit the Earth. In another, we find Geoffrey Trunho, trapped on Mars after a mission went very wrong. Along the way we learn of the fate of Earth, the political machinations that lead to a new space race, and how the Troon family are always in the vanguard.\n\nReleased ten years before the first actual moon landing, Wyndham doesn’t seem to realise how close he was to the first momentous occasion. He, however, doesn’t have people on the moon for a much longer time. The stories take place at gaps of fifty years, starting in 1994 with the launch of the space station, and putting men on the moon in 2044. He does, however, also give a whole alternate future/history for humanity. In his timeline, the northern hemisphere descended into war and was rendered a wasteland of nuclear fallout, allowing Brazil to become the world’s biggest superpower, threatened by the rising Australia. This is a really interesting take on how the Cold War could’ve gone, as to begin with the space race is still between Russia and the US, with Britain holding much more power than it really ever has in reality. The British might’ve explored the seas way back when, but we never really got a grip on space.\n\nOccasionally dry, but generally entertaining, I find myself once again in a position where I want to love Wyndham’s work, but they can’t all be The Midwich Cuckoos. He’s either brilliant, or just fine, and this is one of the latter. The alternate history stuff is great, and probably better than the hard science, and it’s always hilarious to read science fiction written around this time, as no one ever predicts the Internet, but everyone still smokes openly and relies on physical paper for messages. For people who love good, hard science fiction, however, it’s an absolute stellar story.\n\nHumans will always long to explore, and there are few I’d want captaining the ship more than a Troon."
