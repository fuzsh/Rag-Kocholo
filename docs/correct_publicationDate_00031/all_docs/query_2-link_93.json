It's been about 20 years since we last had a pint in the Elfsong Tavern or crawled through the sewers beneath the city streets and, as you might have spotted during the PC Gaming Show, many of these locations are back, and many news ones are waiting to be discovered for the first time - giving you a chance to explore the menacing roads of the Outer City, the opulent estates of the Upper City, and the dark alleys and pubs of the Lower City.\n\nOriginally posted by S.ug:\n\narticle with credits to OP - https://www.putachi.net/baldurs-gate-3-cut-out-content-shown-in-data-mining/\n\nEDIT: Larian always does this with their games and always restores the cut content almost exact 1 year later. Do with that information what you will but if you look at their last 3 games you'll see Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition, Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition, and Divine Divinity Director's Cut.\n\nEDIT 2: Whoever stole this post and copied it to Reddit, thank you lol I feel so cool right now.\n\nEDIT 3: Cut Withers Dialogue for those interested\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNhKgpYKJj4\n\nEDIT 4: Apparently there's a discord using copypaste comments to try and either get people banned from BG3 forums or doxx people for not supporting the game. That's wild and hella ridiculous, but remember not to get dragged into troll fights with strange accounts or click on any unfamiliar links!\n\nEDIT 5: Someone posted a full copy of this to Reddit and this time actually credited me instead of just copypasting and claiming it as their own. https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/15z3jlb/a_list_of_all_cut_content_spoilers_nonplagiarized/\n\nEDIT 6: Purely for those interested there are change.org petitions involved now.\n\nThe first is called Justice for Karlach and is a petition to solve her missing content and ending state: https://www.change.org/p/justice-for-karlach?original_footer_petition_id=36698215&algorithm=promoted&source_location=petition_footer&grid_position=1&pt=AVBldGl0aW9uAFmLNwIAAAAAZOb2pAuMjH0yMGMwMzhlZg%3D%3D\n\nThe second is a petition to bring back some of the missing content and actually uses this exact list as the basis for the petition: https://www.change.org/p/restore-baldur-s-gate-3-bring-back-cut-content-and-fix-act-3?signed=true\n\nThere is, of course, no pressure to sign either but since they were made using content I compiled here I wanted to return the favor and link to them for those interested.\n\n1) The Upper City - The most obvious one. Swen himself talked about the \"Affluent Upper City\" just 2 weeks before launch and described as it being fully explorable and yet it's very noticeably absent from the final game.\n\n2) Shar Worship - In EA the player was able to select Shar as a diety which game with it's own unique dialogue trees, especially when interacting with Shadowheart as a fellow Shar worshiper. Despite the fact that voice lines were datamined indicating this had functions well into Act 2, it was cut when the game launched.\n\n3) Karlach's Ending - Datamined content shows that not only did Karlach have a full ending where her infernal engine was fixed and that she survived, but that most of it was fully voiced and complete. However it required triggers from the Upper City portion of Baldur's Gate and when that was cut, so was Karlach's Act 3 storyline. What we have behind have been confirmed to be Karlach's \"fail state\" endings which were meant to only play if the player neglected her quest chain.\n\n4) Minthara's Story - Minthara was meant to have a much deeper story, including a pregnancy. These were likely cut due to Minthara being a late stage addition to our roster but dialogue lines remain in the games files that show that not only did Minthara have a lot more content for herself but your other companions had a lot more to say about it.\n\n5) Halsin's Story - Another late addition to the roster, Halsin was originally intended to have a great deal more endgame content involving the Druid circle, but this appears to have been cut more early on than some of the other items thus far.\n\n6) Raphael the Merchant - Originally Raphael was meant to be a fully viable option to remove your tadpole, in fact the \"Soul Coin\" items that you collect in game where originally meant to be a powerful alternative currency accepted only by Raphael in exchange for possibly retrieving your soul as well as a long list of incredibly powerful artifacts from the House of Hope that would be sold by Raphael himself.\n\n7) Avernus - An entire area of the game. Avernus was meant to be fully explorable and of similar size to the Underdark Area of Act 1. It would be a source not only for Soul Coins but other rare materials, highly difficult fights, and special content for Karlach.\n\n8) Tav the Dark Urge - A lot of people were both surprised and excited to see the addition of The Dark Urge origin as the Bhaalspawn/Evil option that was missing from EA. As it turns out, Tav was originally the Dark Urge and they were all one origin. Tav was meant to be Bhaalspawn and separating the two seems to be what caused the narrative divide between the Dead Three storyline and the Mindflayer plot.\n\n9) Omeluum's Ring - In the EA version of the game this ring would block your Tadpole entirely. It could not grow, it could not grow stronger, and you could not use Illithid powers. In the launch version this ring prevents you from being charmed despite Omeluum still stating that it blocked the influence of the Elder Brain/Absolute.\n\n10) Bhaal and Orin versus the Creche - An entire Act 2 battle was cut in which Bhaal's forces, led by Orin, attacked the Githyanki creche which led to a fight where you either sided with one or the other or had a massive 3-way fight on your hands.\n\n11) Orin and the Dragon - Orin was meant to corrupt a Githyank red dragon, leading to a boss fight against a Slayer-formesque Dragon.\n\n12) The Hag Coven in Act 2 and 3 - You may notice that accepting Auntie Ethels help in the first Act can lead to a negative effect when fighting Hags. You may also notice that despite Auntie Ethel having letters from other Hags in her basement, she is the only one you encounter. Originally there was meant to be a full three act story involving the Hag coven including the mysterious \"M\" who seems to have been their leader.\n\n13) Epilogues - Full epilogue cutscenes have been datamined that varied greatly depending on your choices. These were the \"17K ending variations\" that Larian told us about, yet they are completely absent in the final game leading only to a fade to black scene at the end of the game.\n\nOriginally posted by Муромец:\n\n\"Patch 2 is around the corner. It features major performance improvements, many new tweaks & changes, and begins our journey incorporating feedback into Origin Character epilogues, among other major things. Details coming soon.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1696534057251921949\n\n14) Cazador's Story - Originally Cazador was meant to play a huge role in the Upper City of Baldur's Gate, including being a huge political power. Datamined content also shows that originally he was meant to be a potential ally in the final push against the Absolute.\n\n15) Banite Cultists - The game features both Bhaal and Myrkul cultists rather heavily but Bane is reduced to Gortash alone. Despite the fact that they had full and finished assets for both armor, weapons, and some events the Banites were cut from the final game.\n\n16) Act 1 Minsc - Minsc was meant to be recruited at the end of Act 1 but was cut and pushed back into the later game.\n\n17) Dialogue and Events - Even from Act 1 itself, thousands of lines of dialogue and companion events were cut from the final game. Some of them were even fully voiced and ready to be implemented in game but also referenced other content that ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\n18) Bhaal, Myrkul and Bane as Deities - Cleric's were meant to be fully able to select the Dead Three from the list of Deities. There were even special dialogues in game for player's who played as a Paladin and then multiclassed at least 1 level of Cleric on top and selected one of the Dead Three.\n\n19) Daisy - It's not a secret that Daisy was cut from the game after the last EA release and replaced with \"The Guardian.\" Originally Daisy was representative of the tadpole in your head, not the Emperor, and would attempt to seduce your character into staying in the meadow by the river with her forever. A happy life with an imaginary dream lover while your body underwent ceramorphosis and was lost to you forever. Daisy was such an important part of the plot that both of the games theme songs \"Down by The River\" and \"The Power\" are based entirely upon Daisy. Datamined content also shows there was originally an ending where players would embrace a romance with Daisy and give themselves over to the parasite, forever leaving their individual consciousness \"down by the river\" with Daisy.\n\n20) Companions and the Illithid Worm - Originally companions were meant to accept or refuse Illithid gifts independently of the player choices. You could of course influence them through dialogue to decide who did and did not take the offered gifts, but ultimately it would be based on individual characters choices. This can still be seen in game as a bug when companions will awake after a long rest and claim to have received a gift from their Guardian and yet will have gained no actual power.\n\n21) Romancing Jaheira - Apparently you were originally meant to have limited options to romance and sleep with Jaheira but these were cut last minute. It's unclear why.\n\n22) Tadpole's and Consequences - There were originally meant to be severe consequences from using the Illithid powers too heavily and investing too much into the Tadpole powers. This seems obvious in game and yet ultimately in the release version goes nowhere as the ending is reduced to about 4 choices made in the last leg of the game. You can use all tadpoles or none and receive the same ending.\n\n23) Act 3 Companion Dialogue - If you've noticed that companions have much less to say at the end of their journey it's because thousands of lines of dialogue were cut from companions in the final Act and all for various reasons. This also seems to be the source of most of the companion bugs that only appear in the final act as they're still trying to trigger events that simply no longer exist.\n\n24) Multiple Cutscenes - There are multiple cutscenes that were present for Act 1 that are missing from the final game.\n\n25) The Nautolid - A large portion of the Nautolid tutorial zone was cut in the final release, including cutscenes, dialogue, areas, and an optional fight with 2 injured Imps. This was likely cut for the sake of brevity more than anything.\n\n26) Mol and Raphael - Isn't it odd how Mol will just escape from Raphael on her own and say it was \"easy?\" Well it turns out that's because they cut whatever the final leg of that quest was meant to be, instead they allow Mol to escape on her own which more or less skips to the end and around the cut content.\n\n27) The Raven Queen - There was an entire second part of the storyline that was cut early on.\n\n28) The Voice of Bane - It's possible to have a brief conversation with Bane, but it remains incomplete as the dialogue is unvoiced for some reason.\n\n29) The Wither's Epilogue - WIther's was meant to narrate an epilogue for the players, to what extent is unsure but instead WIther's is left with a single event in the entire game when post-credit's he can be seen revealing himself as Jergal and mocking a mural of the Dead Three.\n\n30) Crafting - An early access build contained a crafting bench and it seems originally we were meant to have full access to crafting/enchanting gear of our own through certain systems. While these were cut, the items for them were not. This is why items like ingots, gemstones, woods, and other material items appear in game with no use other than vendor trash.\n\nOriginally posted by MASTERCHIEF:\n\nop attach this link and share it with anyone asking about uppercity.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/3649651368763455642?l=english\n\ncredit :- McReesington\n\nbtw i went through the entire article and found some interesting stuff.\n\n\"Enter Lord Enver Gortash, commander of a clockwork army of Steel Watchers. Raised by a devil, a leader among loners, Enver Gortash freed himself of his bonds to envision wonders and become a master of both men and mechanisms.\" - this statement gives me more lore than the game.\n\n\"There are factions within the city vying for control, all disagreeing on what to make of outside threats, and new faces within the city walls. Opportunity in times of struggle is rife. What you make of it, and what it makes of you, will be determined by your choices up to the city walls, and beyond their shadow.\" -huh where?\n\n\"many of these locations are back, and many news ones are waiting to be discovered for the first time - giving you a chance to explore the menacing roads of the Outer City, the opulent estates of the Upper City, and the dark alleys and pubs of the Lower City.\" - well the upper city quote\n\n\"The districts of Baldur's Gate are now three seamless open worlds.\" - one is RIVINGTON and the bridge, the other is lower city, what is the third i wonder. well we can consider the sewers and bhaal area - but its not a district and it is seamlessly connected to lower city (no loading screen) and we don't get a message stating that we are leaving the area like when we leave Rivington.\n\nOriginally posted by MASTERCHIEF:\n\nOriginally posted by Lance_Lionroar:\n\nSo I'm coming into this thread pretty late, haven't read any previous arguments in the comments, but it seems people all over the community crying about cut content as \"confirmed\" use this thread as their source. I have one question for the OP. What's your source? \"Datamining\" isn't really a clear answer. If there are voice lines from Karlach or other characters, why aren't they posted on YouTube, like the Withers one? This seems like a whole lot of \"trust me bro\" that everyone just ran with.\n\nAnd people are consistently misquoting Sven claiming upper city is explorable when he never stated anything specifically like that.\n\nhere are some proofs our community found. about cut content.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fm7roldu4sn5b1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D828%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D5f776c8a2d6e7a761169ade4cb03b47061e2be5f\n\ncredit :- Dr. Sinclair\n\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/baldurs-gate-3-dev-diary-city-reveal-pcgs-2023/\n\ncredit :- ᛊᚨᛁᛚᛟᚱ ᛗᛟᛟᚾ\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/3649651368763455642?l=english\n\ncredit :- McReesington\n\nthe Reddit post that blows everything out of the water:-\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/15umpxk/to_those_disappointed_in_the_endings/\n\ndatamine link :- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1toM2E_7-cpiCvpvXQMjKt_Brh2ChhL2o\n\nCredit :- Vel\n\nand OP also linked a video of Withers voice lines :-\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNhKgpYKJj4\n\nOriginally posted by Creomortis:\n\nNot sure if this has been posted but: https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/163eail/act_3_upper_city_spoilers_maybe_cut_content/\n\n(More Below in First Post)\n\n[Reserved since Dataminer's keep finding more and more content that was removed]\n\n31) Helia - The Halfling Werewolf that I sadly forgot was cut from the game.\n\n32) Belts - There is an item slot in game for belts, not a single belt is present in the game as an item.\n\n33) Exhaustion - A 6 Tier debuff for player exhaustion was found in the game after players noted a Bluejay with the debuff/status effect exhausted. This was meant to be a system in place force players to rest more often but was removed despite being left over in an Act 2 portion of the game. This also explains the constant comments from the PC like \"I'm exhausted, I need a good long rest.\"\n\nMore here: https://www.dexerto.com/baldurs-gate/baldurs-gate-3-players-stumble-upon-removed-feature-leaving-community-divided-2259641/\n\n34) Dragonborn Guardian - Larians last race to be added is the only race who is not available ad a Guardian due to time constraints.\n\n35) Lone Wolf Mode - According to a Larian Q/A:\n\nIs there a Lone Wolf mode planned?\n\nThis is actually a question already being asked by a number of our playtesters who are currently playing the game. A Lone Wolf mode is planned, but won’t be in the game at the beginning of Early Access. One of the many great discussions that come from people playing, and talking with us.\n\nIt seems this was planned early on, but never implemented for one reason or another.\n\nFrench press article about it : https://www.millenium.org/news/406099.html\n\n(in french sorry)"
