        "text": "This image could have imperfections as itâ€™s either historical or reportage.\n\nJohn Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris (1903-1969) was a writer of science fiction who wrote under a number of different variants of his name. He wrote as John Beynon Harris, John Beynon, Lucas Parkes and John Wyndham. Before the war he had written under his pen names short stories for serialisation in American magazines but it was after the war than he changed his writing style and his pen name to John Wyndham. The Day of the Triffids was published in 1951 and became an immediate success. Further novels and short stories followed during his lifetime with some published posthumously."
