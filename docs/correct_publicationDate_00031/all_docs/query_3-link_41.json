        "text": "John Wyndham has been known for writing about world catastrophes in which, however, some at least of the people involved remain decent as they try to survive and then even make some sort of shared life with others. Wyndham aimed for a sense of menace but not gross horror. The Day of the Triffids, The Midwich Cuckoos, When the Kraken Wakes... some Chrons people will have read these, and maybe some Chrons people will know of books by other authors that are truly kindred works.\n\nWould it be possible, at first at least, that responses could be limited to comments from people who have actually read at least one of Wyndham's novels? Responses that make a good-faith effort to identify books that truly are close kin to the ones just mentioned will be especially appreciated. One reason I'm asking the question posed in this thread's title is that I wonder if there are any such books, especially ones that were aimed at grownups rather than teenagers, though books aimed at adolescents could be appropriate. I know that Ballard wrote several novels that are alleged to have been influenced by Wyndham, but my sense is that this author typically wants to go for the nasty in a way that Wyndham declined to do, so please don't list Ballard (or John Christopher) without careful consideration....\n\nWe'll see...\n\nI only recently read When The Kraken Wakes and I love Triffids but I have not read The Midwich Cuckoos so thanks for the heads up on that one.\n\nI wouldnt say any of these are kindred works but my main recommendation would be Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang by Kate Wilhelm (1976) which as well as sharing some themes is probably the closest in writing styles (imo and they certainly still have their differences).\n\nEarth Abides - George R Stewart (1949) jumps straight into the post-apocalyptic but may not be a million miles away in writing styles (its been awhile since I read it) and agree with the suggestion of War of the Worlds.\n\nRoadside Picnic by Arkay and Boris Strugatsky (1972) maybe? Alien contact into a somewhat post-apocalyptic world.\n\nIts funny you vetoed Ballard as my first thought was the stories above and then The Drowned World by J.G. Ballard (1962) and was going to say shares a lot in themes but is very different in writing style. Its a book that in the end I liked but didn't love, your millage may vary.\n\nI’ve read all the Wyndham you mention in your first post, Extollager, and he did have a certain tone and theme that are not seen elsewhere very often. I would agree that some Simak comes close (They Walked Like Men, perhaps). Also Greybeard, by Aldiss seemed a little Wyndhamesque. Then there’s Ballard. Books like The Drowned World share some features. John Christopher?\n\nEdit: Ha! I wrote my reply without reading the other responses (lazy of me) and it transpires I’ve restated a lot of earlier suggestions. At least now you know they are popular suggestions."
