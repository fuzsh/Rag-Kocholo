        "text": "In Lectures in Neuroscience, Rafael Yuste, a professor of biological sciences and director of the NeuroTechnology Center, provides an accessible introduction to the brain. Beginning with basic elements of neuroscience, he guides readers through increasingly sophisticated topics, developing a unified framework for how the brain functions. Yuste describes how the brain is organized and how it develops, how neurons operate and form neural circuits, and how these circuits function as neural networks to generate behavior and mental states.\n\n“Practitioners of science spend their lives conjuring questions and searching for answers. Despite the pursuit of truth, Lisa M. P. Munoz has found that the sciences are riddled with systemic biases in plain sight. Throughout her career, first as an engineer and later as a science communicator, she has experienced this firsthand and listened to numerous similar experiences from colleagues.”\n\nExclusive book excerpt: The Universal Timekeepers\n\nThey are 99.9999999999995% empty space. Almost perfectly nothing.\n\nAnd yet they make up everything you see, touch, smell, taste, and feel. They feed and clothe you. Their motion makes you warm (and cold). They generate your hopes and dreams and memories. They exist in splendid isolation and in highly complex assemblages. They tell time. And they can reveal secrets of the past that are otherwise unknowable.\n\nThey are atoms.\n\nBig Brains: How Your Brain Benefits From Music, With Larry Sherman\n\nMusic plays an important role in all of our lives. But listening to music or playing an instrument is more than just a creative outlet or hobby — it’s also scientifically good for us. Research shows that music can stimulate new connections in our brains; keeping our cognitive abilities sharp and our memories alive.\n\nIn a new book entitled Every Brain Needs Music: The Neuroscience of Making and Listening to Music, Prof. Larry Sherman explores why we all need music for our mental wellbeing — and how it can even help us later in life.\n\nWhy do we have sex? Why do we fall in love? What attracts us to one another? And how do we compare to other species in the animal kingdom? Researchers have been trying to answer these questions for years, and Simon LeVay’s book Attraction, Love, Sex: The Inside Story sets out to share some these discoveries in an engaging and easy-to-understand way.\n\nSuicide is a difficult topic to discuss, both for suicidal individuals and for people who have been otherwise affected by suicide. Medical professionals often struggle to properly address the topic with patients. In The Suicidal Person, clinical psychiatrist and psychotherapist Konrad Michel provides insight into suicide, centering the stories of suicidal people and emphasizing the importance of connecting with suicidal patients as individuals. In this interview with Anna Patchefsky, Michel talks through new ways of conceptualizing suicide, effective treatments, and his own grief as a person affected by suicide.\n\nIn The Altruistic Urge: Why We’re Driven to Help Others, Stephanie D. Preston, professor of psychology and director of the Ecological Neuroscience Lab at the University of Michigan, explores how and why we developed a surprisingly powerful drive to help the vulnerable. She opens up about her interdisciplinary research that combines neuroscience, animal behavior, cognitive science, and human psychology and offers insight into her altruistic response model in this conversation with publicist, Robyn Massey.\n\nAction First, Doom Later: What Octopuses Can Teach Us About Climate Resilience\n\n“Do you remember the 2016 viral photo of an octopus swimming next to parked cars in a flooded Miami parking garage? A particularly high tide had likely pushed the unsuspecting creature through a drain pipe and into alien territory. For Rob Verchick, climate law scholar, it was a clear sign of climate change—and a preview of how humans might need to adapt.”\n\nDarwin’s Loves: The Glories and Limits Of Facts\n\n“In one of those true stories that become legendary, Darwin predicted the existence of a moth like this one—sporting a twelve-inch tongue. Darwin based his 1862 prediction on the Madagascan star orchid’s twelve-inch nectary—a dangling, hollow tube with nectar pooled at its base. Darwin’s sense of coevolution told him that some moth must have evolved a matching proboscis to procure that nectar.”\n\nThe Mysterious Sex Lives of Dinosaurs\n\n“Dinosaurs must have had sex to reproduce but how they did it – with their neck frills, armored plates and tails tipped with spikes – isn’t exactly clear.\n\nNo fossil has revealed two dinosaurs caught in the act – the only known vertebrates to be unequivocally preserved mating are a pair of 47 million-year-old turtles that were attached by their genitals as they got buried alive.\n\nIt’s also not possible to easily determine whether a dinosaur is male or female from fossilized bones.\n\nFossils that preserve elements of dinosaur behavior are very rare. However, with close analysis and insights from what we know about living animals, particularly birds, paleontologists are beginning to piece together the sex lives of dinosaurs.”\n\nWhy Neandertals Were Not Intellectually Inferior to Cro-Magnon\n\n“The idea of a world inhabited by several human species feels more like science fiction than science fact because there is only one human species—Homo sapiens—alive. Yet for the bulk of our evolutionary history, multiple human species did coexist, with the current single-species situation being very much the exception and not the rule. The best-known example of the coexistence of two human species is that of the Neandertals (Homo neanderthalensis) with the Cro-Magnons (Homo sapiens) in Europe around 40,000 years ago. The interaction between these two species is one of the central themes of my book, Cro-Magnon: The Story of the Last Ice Age People of Europe.”"
