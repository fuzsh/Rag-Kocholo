        "text": "One of the only guarantees in human existence is that if you have a pulse, you will get older. But this process is far from straightforward. As our faces and bodies change, it becomes easier to find fault in our physical appearance, especially in a society that upholds youth. We’re so quick to locate and hyper-fixate on each perceived imperfection that we forget all that our bodies give us the ability to do, which is what writer and essayist Gayle Brandeis examines in Drawing Breath: Essays on Writing, the Body, and Loss.\n\nBrandeis asks, why punish our bodies for doing what they are meant to do when we could honor them instead? Ruminating on her own experience of feeling insecure about her aging body and wanting to hide, Brandeis learns to reject the urge to scrutinize every aspect of her appearance and instead finds joy and freedom while she still can. After becoming ill and dealing with the long-lasting effects of Covid, she feels this more urgently than ever before.\n\nShondaland caught up with the author to discuss how she found her way to writing, what it means to locate your truth, how to feel at home in your body, and more.\n\nKATIE TAMOLA: Could you tell me a bit about your work and how you arrived at writing about the body?\n\nGAYLE BRANDEIS: I’ve really been fascinated with the connection between writing and the body for many, many years. It sort of came into focus for me in college, where I was in a program where I was able to create my own degree. And I’ve been a writer since I was 4 and a dancer since even before then. And so, I decided to put together a degree in poetry and movement as arts of expression, meditation, and healing. And as I was exploring these two arts that I was so passionate about [and] continue to be so passionate about, [although] I don’t dance as much as I would like these days, I realized that the intersection between them was the body. That writing of course issues from the body.\n\nWhen I wrote, I tried to capture that as authentically as I can, in a way that I was hoping could feel kind of as grounded and muscular as dance. And then I wanted to dance in a way that could feel as eloquent as language. And so, that was really where the deep exploration or writing in the body began for me. Although I look back and see as a kid, I was writing about all sorts of things that were body-focused and that were intrigued by illness, mental or physical illness. So, it was like me before that, but I think that’s when I fully became aware that this is juicy, and this is something I want to dig into. So then, just exploring that ever since, and I feel like I still have so much to explore. Breath really becomes such a powerful nexus between the two arts, just between the body and the world. Because we take the world in when we breathe in, and then when we breathe out, we give ourselves to the world. And that feels very much like the interchange of writing in the world where we take the world in, sort of filter all these experiences, and then we write, and so it becomes this reciprocal relationship between self and world or world and body, world and voice.\n\nAnd so, I was especially interested in that connection between writing and breath. And when I was getting my MFA, I wrote the title essay, “Drawing Breath.” This was over 20 years ago. It’s clearly been a long-standing interest of mine. That one just jumped out as feeling like such a perfect metaphor for writing in general because it is very much about this in-and-out exchange between body and world and writing. It felt like, okay, this can be the core of this collection, and all of the other essays resonated with that in some way because they’re all looking both inward and outward. The way breath goes in and out, and [I] started to think about different types of breathing and how essays could kind of coalesce into these different sections that could be represented by a different type of breath.\n\nI hope [my book] will give people the courage to tell their own stories and just feel like they’ve been given a little dose of freedom.\n\nKT: In “Thunder, Thighs,” you write, “I used to have a happy relationship with my legs,” which I felt really encapsulates the war so many women wage on their bodies.\n\nGB: I see it all the time, including within myself, even though I feel like I should be beyond that since I’ve been exploring this so much. And I’m aware on an intellectual level, like where this comes from. It’s just a patriarchal, capitalistic world that we live in that wants us to feel bad about ourselves so we can buy things or buy services that will make us look more like [the] unrealistic model that’s been forced down our throats or on our eyes. And it does create this awful battle within us. It’s devastating because our bodies are so wise — our bodies, it’s how we live in the world. And when we pour hatred into our bodies, it just creates such a tricky existence because our bodies are our homes, and if we are sending hatred toward our homes, then how can we feel fully at home in the world?\n\nAnd it’s something that I try to be aware of if I do it to myself, because I do. I’m wearing a turtleneck right now because my neck has aged a lot. It’s getting loose, and it makes me uncomfortable even though I know it shouldn’t because it’s just a natural part of getting older. And so, when I find myself cringing, if I see like, oh, it’s poking over my turtleneck, then I try to send it love. I try to thank my neck for all it does for me — it carries my voice; it lets me swallow delicious things.\n\nSo, I noticed [when I’m] being hard on my body like that, I try to reframe it, but it still creeps in, and it’s sort of a constant dialogue I have with just trying to accept myself as I am. And remember that I don’t need to fit an image I’ve been fed by people who just want to make money.\n\nKT: You write about your experience with the pandemic and how it impacted your relationship with your body. What made you want to explore that so openly in your book?\n\nGB: It’s something that’s affecting so many of us. It’s such a widespread [thing] we’re all grappling with, and it felt important to me to write about it because I wanted to start to understand it for myself, and writing is how I understand things.\n\nI got sick really early in the pandemic before tests were even widely available in my area. There were some tests that you had to jump through a bunch of hoops to get to them, and I didn’t click the right boxes. I hadn’t been out of the country and stuff like that. So, I couldn’t even get a test, but it was pretty clear that’s what I had, and [with] lingering effects for a while, some of which I’m still dealing with today. And [it] really changed my way of being in the world because I wasn’t sure I was going to survive it, and it made me confront my mortality directly. I wanted to make peace with that. And my walks in the woods by my house helped me with that and seeing the natural cycle of things, and how plants just go through that cycle of blooming and then fading away, and they release the seeds for future generations. I felt like it taught me to embrace my own mortality in a way that was really, really comforting. I wanted to capture the way that whole experience impacted my body, but also my inner world sort of re-shifted my priorities and helped me have a more expansive view on what it means to get older or get sicker.\n\nKT: Your writing is praised for its honesty and its ability to push back against this idea that women should be a certain way: “Polite is overrated. Polite keeps us from our truth.”\n\nHow are you able to write so effectively about your own truth? And how would you urge other people to do the same?\n\nGB: Writing for me has been the easiest way for me to express myself, I think, as someone who was always shy and also was always scared of upsetting people because I grew up very much a people pleaser. It’s something I’ve had to push against and in writing honestly like this, and I still have that feeling [of] people aren’t going to like me. I have to let go of that.\n\nI think, for me, the thing that helps is to write as if no one’s ever going to read what I write, and once I’m done, I can decide whether or not I want to revise it and make it available to a wider audience. I write those for stress just knowing that it’s for myself, that no one ever has to see it. That’s really freeing for me. And that’s why I encourage people to just get their thoughts down and just imagine that no one is ever going to see it. That is just to get out of our own way and try to quiet those voices that will say you shouldn’t write about that, or you shouldn’t voice that opinion.\n\nI think that we owe it to ourselves to know what we’re really thinking and feeling and to be able to give voice to that. Even if we don’t necessarily share it, if we’re not ready to share it with someone, giving ourselves that permission is so important. And Audre Lorde is a writer who has helped to give me a lot of courage in terms of being honest on the page; she said, “Your silence will not protect you.” And that phrase [goes] through my head a lot in writing. I think that just writing our truth gets things out of our system and can help us feel more whole. I certainly feel that way. I felt like once I started writing honestly about my life, I started feeling like [my] inside and my outside can be congruent.\n\nKT: What is something you’d like readers to take away from Drawing Breath?\n\nGB: I think what I would most like for people to take from it is a renewed sense of being alive. Of appreciating that our breath will end someday and wanting to make the most of our life while we still have it. And [being as] fully present in the world as we still can. Also, if it gives people permission to write about their own lives, that would be so lovely. I hope [my book] will give people the courage to tell their own stories and just feel like they’ve been given a little dose of freedom."
