        "text": "John Wyndham was born John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris, in Birmingham on 10 July 1903, and died 11 March 1969. He had a variety of jobs before finding success in the 1920s writing short stories for American magazines. He wrote under the name of J Beynon Harris and Lucas Parkes, before settling on John Wyndham after the war, for his science fiction novels. You can find out more from Liverpool University Archives, where his papers are held.\n\nJohn Wyndham’s early, pre-war writing included detective novels, as well as short stories. It was after the war that he turned to science fiction. What gives his books their enduring universal quality, is their psychological focus on the characters’ human struggle for survival when catastrophic events disturb a comfortable English setting. This gives them a popularity way beyond the reader’s interest in the science they portray.\n\nStephen King described Wyndham as “Perhaps the best writer of science fiction England has ever produced”"
