        "text": "The 'outward urge' was a factor in the Troon inheritance. Successive generations of Troons, looking up at the stars, heard the siren voices that called them out into Space. And, as the frontiers of Space receded, there was usually one Troon, if not more, out there, helping to push them back.\n\nIn an age in which what goes up need not necessarily come down, the likely adventures of the Conquistadors of Space are every bit as exciting as any world menaced by triffids. This coming-of-age classic from the author of The Midwich Cuckoos shows Wyndham's mastery across genres.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJohn Wyndham (1903-69)\n\nJohn Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris was the son of a barrister, who started writing short stories in 1925. During the war he was in the civil service and then the army. In 1946 he went back to writing stories for publication in the USA and decided to try a modified form of science fiction, which he called 'logical fantasy'. As John Wyndham, he is best-known as the author of The Day of the Triffids, but he wrote many other successful novels including The Kraken Wakes, The Chrysalids and The Midwich Cuckoos (filmed as Village of the Damned).\n\nBook Information\n\nISBN 9781473230729\n\nAuthor John Wyndham\n\nFormat Paperback\n\nPage Count 176\n\nImprint Gateway\n\nPublisher Orion Publishing Co\n\nWeight(grams) 160g\n\nDimensions(mm) 196mm * 130mm * 18mm"
