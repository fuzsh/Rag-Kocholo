        "text": "Description\n\nFirst Edition, Publishers' Original Binding, With Dustwrapper\n\nThis work is stated as being co-authored by John Wyndham and Lucas Parkes. Parkes was an earlier pen-name used by Wyndham and therefore this novel is written by he alone. Due to this works genre of being hard science fiction, which was slightly different from his normal works, the publishers decided to have two authors on the byline. This novel is a future history set from 1994 to 2194. Each chapter is set at 50 year intervals and explores the solar system, with space stations in the Earth's orbit. John Wyndham is one of the most prolific British science fiction authors who penned his novels during the Golden Era of science fiction. Born John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris, he wrote under the names John Wyndham, John Benyon and Lucas Parkes. Following schooling, Wyndham explored many careers but found writing suited him best. Between 1925 and 1931 he sold short stories and serial fiction to American Science Fiction magazines. He took a break in writing during the Second World War, but soon returned, to much success. He is probably best known for 'The Day of the Triffids'.\n\nDelivery & payment\n\nWe send all of our books via courier which is a fully tracked and insured service.
