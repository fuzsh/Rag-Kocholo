        "text": "Hello there As the thread title sums up pretty succinctly, I'm a Wyndham fan and I've been in the mood for some similar fiction recently by other authors. Does anyone have any recommendations? I particularly enjoyed The Day of the Triffids, The Chrysalids and Web. I've just bought Plan For Chaos, the last of his posthumous publications - looking forward to that!\n\nI really like his prose style, and how his literature captures the age it was written, while remaining timeless and classic. I also think of it as bridging the transition to modern sci-fi. His earlier short stories are about lunar civilizations and nuts and bolts robot aliens, whereas I consider Chrysalids and Web to be post-nuclear, much more modern fiction. But that's just me!\n\nAnyway, any recommendations you may have I'd be most grateful to hear.\n\nThanks so much for your time,\n\nTony\n\nIf you've not got round to The Kraken Wakes, in my humble opinion thats the best of wyndhams books. In fact it is so timeles that if someone merely swaps EBC to BBC then it would actually be pretty much totally up to date.\n\nI presume the appeal is something set in reasonably contempary times but a kind of creeping monster or phenomena thats having planet wide repurcussions?\n\nIf so\n\nthe Chronoliths by Robert Wilson is quite similar\n\nYes, I liked the guy when I met him, back in the sixties. There again, we were on the same side of an argument (extremely heated debate?) and that gives a certain feeling of trust in his judgement, even when affected by alcohol – well both of us. All of us, really; the antithesis was also indulging.\n\nRobots and moon cities? I don'r recognise the particular shorts, though my bookshelves are Wyndham ligt after the move – only 'The seeds of time' and 'Jizzle'.\n\nThere were lots of catastrophe novels around back then, many of which were atrocious, others quite tolerable – I have good memories of Charles Eric Maine's \"Tide went out\", but it has been a dreadfully long time since I read it. Atomic fallout featured heavily in ways to almost exterminate mankind (those were the days of Aldermaston marches), and the Chrysalids were far from the only mutations, but alternative techniques were always welcome, preferably involving 'things mankind was not meant to know', the Frankenstein complex\n\nOf his, I would suggest avoiding \"The outward urge\", where he collaborated with himself (Lucas Parkes was part of his name, and a pen name) and, not of his Simon Clark's \"The night of the triffids\". On the other hand, do read 'The trouble with lichen' – it's not the best written, but … oh, you were intending to read all of his, anyway?\n\nI really like his books too. He was a very good and innovative author, and broke free from the alien-invasion style of War of the Worlds and the 50s B-movies. Day of the Triffids basically covers most of the zombie genre decades before George Romero got going.\n\nAnyhow, have you read The Midwich Cuckoos? I think that's one of his best. For some reason, I remember Nevil Shute's On the Beach as having a slightly Wyndhamesque feel, perhaps because it's about ordinary people facing the apocalypse (albeit in Australia). To be honest, it's hard to think of much SF that is so modern, innovative and strongly British without being twee.\n\nHi thanks so much for your ideas! Just checking them out now! Death Of Grass, oooh. And the Genocides looks cool\n\nI apologize for not being clearer though - I've read all Wyndham's novels and most of his compilations.\n\nSo any ideas about fiction with a similar 'feel' from other writers would be brilliant\n\nI haven't actually read War Of the Worlds, but am very familiar with both Orson Welles's radio adaptation and Jeff Wayne's musical, as well as the films, so it feels like ground already, partially, covered And I'm in the mood for new horizons!\n\nThanks so much for your help so far and to come!\n\nT\n\nI'm also a big fan of Wyndham and I agree with the mentions of \"The Furies\" and \"On the Beach\".\n\nI may have judged this wrong, but I think you'd like Christopher Priest. I'd highly recommend \"The Affirmation\", \"The Glamour\" and \"The Prestige\". They are non really pure SF - there's a highly psychological element to each novel.\n\n\"The Inverted World\" is great too, but doesn't have that \"Englishness\" about it."
