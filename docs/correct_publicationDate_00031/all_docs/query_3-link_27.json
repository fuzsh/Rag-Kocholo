        "text": "by Stephen R. Case\n\nStephen R. Case lays out the ideas that inspired the universe in his story “Sisters of the Flare,” now available in our [July/August issue, on sale now!]\n\nA few years ago I began drafting a story about a religious order, ships that were huge cathedrals in space, and a super-luminal Lattice that allowed them to travel from one end of the galaxy to the other. It was a sort of mirror image to the grimdark future of fictions like the Warhammer 40,000 universe. I wanted a galactic empire of humanity, which I called the Instrumentatum, that was bright, ordered, and at peace. In my universe, the empress (who may or may not be a god but is worshipped as one) rules from Holy Hearth, and her sisters of mercy travel the stars as emissaries, traders, and sometimes enforcers of her will. Like the galactic empire of Asimov’s Foundation, it’s an anthropo-exclusive cosmos: though humanity has spread across millions of worlds, it has encountered no other intelligent life recognized as such.\n\nThe key to this empire, and to the empress’s control over it, is the super-luminal system of travel: the Lattice, a network of conduits carved beneath space (so legends say) by the empress herself at the dawn of the Instrumentatum, before Earth became Hearth. Those who travel the Lattice don’t understand the technology behind it, but pilots on each cathedral-ship know how to steer their vast vessels down these corridors of light. The Lattice stitches together all the worlds of the galaxy. For a hundred generations the sisterhood has traveled up and down the Lattice, recruiting novices from the worlds they call upon.\n\nEach of the empress’s cathedral-ship is a vast honeycomb of sacristies, libraries, chapels, workstations, and mosaiced landing bays built around a core that houses a cluster of miniature, tethered stars powering each ship. Gravity on these huge vessels is partially artificial, referred to by the sisters as “guiding hands,” providing inertial stability and in the bowels of each ship tightly binding the coiled star-heart fusion cores. Hundreds of different specialties of sisters go about their work under the direction of each ship’s Mother Superior, from the venerated pilots to the gardeners (genetically modified to walk the hulls tending the delicate sensor-gardens) to the eremites living in the caverns of the interior tending the fires of the fusion cores to sisters who pass their lives in study, contemplation, or prayer.\n\nTwo gifts make the sisterhood’s work in this universe possible. The first is the Lattice, which it seems is theirs alone to traverse. The second is the chemical known as the Calm, which sisters begin to take when they have been fully inducted into the order. The Calm deadens emotions and passion, thus (the sisters claim) opening the path to true prayer and contemplation. It also extends life so that a sister becomes effectively immortal, an eternal passenger on a cathedral-ship’s centuries-long travels. On worlds across the galaxy, children imagine a cathedral-ship coasting into their system from a Lattice terminal and offering to a handful of their planet’s best and brightest the gift of dispassion and immortality.\n\nIt was a bright, ordered cosmos, but my stories focus on characters trying to make sense of their universe after this ordered structure has been shattered. At some point, shortly before my stories begin, the Instrumentatum makes contact with a new kind of life at the fringes of the galaxy. Not an alien race, not an invasion, but rather an infection: a catalytic process that attacks planets themselves as a virus attacks cells, reducing entire worlds to dust-like spores. The galaxy, the sisterhood has realized, is diseased.\n\nIt was a bright, ordered cosmos, but my stories focus on characters trying to make sense of their universe after this ordered structure has been shattered.\n\nIn response, the empress orders the Long Retreat, calling all cathedral-ships back to Hearth. If the spreading infection, which may naturally take millions of years to spread from system to system, reaches the Lattice, it could allow the infection to quickly jump from inhabited world to inhabited world, like a cancer metastasizing. To slow its spread, the empress waits as long as possible and then does the unthinkable and erases the Lattice from space.\n\nFor the sisters on the Hearth-bound cathedral-ships, this is as unimaginable as losing the sky itself. Ships en route fall from the Lattice back into normal space, possibly trillions of miles from any star or habitable planet. Where there had been an Instrumentatum linking the galaxy, now there are only planets isolated by light-years and cathedral-ships marooned in space with no means of super-luminal travel.\n\nMy stories—the first, “Daughters of the Lattice,” appearing in Asimov’s a year ago and the second, “Sisters of the Flare,” in this issues—are set on the cathedral-ship Decalogue, which finds itself marooned when the Lattice disappears. The characters on board find themselves asking difficult questions in this new reality: What’s the point of living forever if you may not reach a habitable planet for a hundred thousand years? And even if you do, is immortality on a single world anything but a prison sentence? What do the virtues of prayer and obedience mean when your god has abandoned you? How do you create a new life when your vocation no longer has any meaning? If it was possible, would you bring children into such a radically transformed world?\n\n“Daughters of the Lattice” picked up the story once the Decalogue had found and settled a marginally habitable planet, following a set of characters who realize there might be a way to re-open the Lattice, though at the potential cost of whatever tentative safety they have found. The story in this issue, “Sisters of the Flare,” steps backward in time to tell the story of life on the Decalogue in the immediate wake of the Lattice’s collapse. A rebellious sister and an ancient nun who tends the fusion cores deep within the ship form an unlikely friendship, which may be key to finding a new home for the Decalogue. It’s also a story about stories—the ones we tell and how they shape the worlds we inhabit.\n\nI’m drawn to space opera—huge galactic vistas and god-level technologies—told with (I hope) literary sensibility and a sense of wonder. I’ve enjoyed developing the universe in these stories, and I hope you enjoy inhabiting it for a time through the characters I’ve created. I’d love to hear your thoughts on “Sisters of the Flare.” Find me at www.stephenrcase.com or reach out on X @StephenRCase.\n\nStephen Case is an author, professor, and historian of science.

In the following Q&A, discover more about Ken’s influences, his background, and why writing for his own enjoyment has been so important for his success\n\nAsimov’s Editor: What is the story behind this piece?\n\nKen Schneyer: This story arose out of my dissatisfaction with various tropes I have seen (including some I have written) related to a common situation that arises in fiction, particularly adventure, military, and spy stories. I started making a list of those tropes and realized that I didn’t believe in any of them. It isn’t that I didn’t believe the characters would do such things, it’s that I didn’t believe they would ultimately react to them in the way they were portrayed to react.\n\nAE: How did this story germinate? Was there a spark of inspiration, or did it come to you slowly?\n\nKS: I wrote the entire first draft between May 31 and June 2 of 2023 at the Highlights Foundation Retreat Center in Boyds Mills, PA. That’s very fast for me; in ordinary times it can take me months or years to produce a draft. But once I decided that I wanted to interrogate these tropes, I realized I wanted my protagonist to actually know of the tropes herself. So she needed to be a big reader, which led to the notion that she’d be reading aloud to the child who is also central to this story. That the story is being published less than year after I finished the first draft is astonishing to me.\n\nAE: How did the title for this piece come to you?\n\nKS: My preliminary title was a line appearing near the end of the story, but I decided that it was too on-the-nose and telegraphed too much. Mentioning “futures” makes the reader speculate about how the futures of the two characters would differ, and why.\n\nAE: What is your history with Asimov’s?\n\nKS: This story is my first sale to Asimov’s but my 34th submission to it since 2008. It makes me proud of my own persistence and patience, and also grateful for the praise and encouragement I received from editor Sheila Williams in many of her kind rejection notes over the years.\n\nAE: Who or what are your greatest influences and inspirations?\n\nKS: In no particular order: Ursula Le Guin, John Varley, Marge Piercy, Greg Egan, Margaret Atwood, John Irving, Kage Baker, Robertson Davies, Alexander Jablokov, Robert Heinlein, Mary Renault, Sarah Pinsker, Amal El-Mohtar, Vandana Singh, David Gerrold, N. K. Jemisin, Alfred Bester, Robert Sheckley, Eugie Foster, Anton Chekhov, Dorothy Sayers, Kim Stanley Robinson, Robert Crais, Nancy Kress, Ted Chiang, Ken Liu, Adam-Troy Castro, Joan Slonczewski.\n\nAE: How much or little do current events impact your writing?\n\nKS: Since I’m such an introvert, almost all of my ideas come from within, and current events are, if anything, a distraction from what I’m trying to accomplish. In this particular story, I have to emphasize that current events had absolutely no influence. Although I knew, back in June of 2023, about the horrible events in the Artzakh (Nagorno-Karabakh), they were not in my mind when I was writing, and of course the October attacks in Israel hadn’t happened yet. There is ongoing oppression everywhere, but that’s an historical fact of life going back centuries, and it’s “current” only in the sense that things have not changed, or have not changed enough.\n\nThe more you write, the better you get. So, if the first story has trouble finding a home, write the second one and submit it. If the second one fails, write the third one. Write drafts you don’t like and can’t use. Write fragments that never turn into stories. Just keep writing.\n\nAE: How do you deal with writers’ block?\n\nKS: First I promise myself that I’m writing only for my own pleasure, without concern for the finished product or what anyone thinks of it. If I can do that, typically I can write just to play. (As I have received more attention, this necessary step has become harder; but without it, I freeze.) If I’m lacking a topic, I have an ongoing journal of “story ideas” (now over 47,000 words long) that I can refer to for prompts. Failing that, Larissa Lai taught me a brainstorming exercise that can typically get me started on a stream-of-consciousness narrative which sometimes yields surprising results.\n\nAE: How did you break into writing?\n\nKS: I was fortunate in making my first professional sale in 2008 (to the “Futures” feature of Nature Physics) only three months after my first submission. (No, I take that back; it wasn’t really my first submission. When I was fifteen, I submitted two stories (“Red Giant” and “Holy War” 😊) separately to Analog, F&SF, and Galaxy. They were both rejected at all three magazines, and they were my only pro submissions for over 30 years.) That 2008 sale, although it garnered almost no attention, was enough positive reinforcement to inspire me to keep writing and submitting through the many rejections that followed.\n\nAE: What inspired you to start writing?\n\nKS: I think I first fancied myself a writer when I was seven. (I wrote a 500-word story that was a rip-off of The Time Tunnel.) This ambition, in one form or another, lasted through high school and college (see the aforementioned teenage story submissions), and I even started a novelette on the train during my commute to my first “grown-up” job. But then I more-or-less forgot about being a writer for a quarter-century, expressing myself creatively through scholarly articles, faculty roasts, and weird exam questions. I got back into it through writing angst-ridden fan fiction in 2006-2007, which gave me the confidence to attempt an original story in the Fall of 2007. I attended the Clarion Writers Workshop in 2009. Clarion either convinces you that you don’t want to be a writer, or convinces you that you do.\n\nAE: Do you have any advice for up-and-coming writers?\n\nKS: Rejection is the nature of the beast. My overall acceptance ratio, which I think is a good one, is one acceptance for every eight submissions. I try not to wait more than 24 hours between a rejection and sending the story out again. If you’re going to be devastated (or, worse, feel the need to revise the story) every time you get a rejection, you will be miserable. If you made the work as good as you could before you submitted it, just keep submitting it.\n\nBe conscious about the narrative voice; there is no such thing as a “transparent” or “neutral” narrator, and the right voice can make everything else in the story better.\n\nThe more you write, the better you get. So, if the first story has trouble finding a home, write the second one and submit it. If the second one fails, write the third one. Write drafts you don’t like and can’t use. Write fragments that never turn into stories. Just keep writing.\n\nAE: How can our readers follow you and your writing? (IE: Social media handles, website URL…)\n\nKS: I have a web site at kenschneyer.com, which contains my complete bibliography and clips to various videos and audio files. I’m on Facebook, Twitter/X, and Bluesky as Ken Schneyer.\n\nKen Schneyer is a humanities professor, a lawyer, an IT project manager, an actor, an amateur astronomer and genealogist, and a political junkie who lives in Rhode Island. His stories appear in Uncanny, Lightspeed, Analog, Strange Horizons, Beneath Ceaseless Skies, Nature Physics, Escape Pod, Podcastle, Pseudopod, and elsewhere. They’ve been honored with Nebula and Sturgeon nominations, translated into five languages, and found their way into a few Year’s Best anthologies. In 2020 Fairwood Press released his second collection, Anthems Outside Time and Other Strange Voices.\n\nAuthor Genevieve Valentine discusses her writing process, her interest in the psychology of artists, and the thoughts surrounding performance art that inspired her story “Future Perfect,” now available in our [July/August issue, on sale now!]\n\nAsimov’s Editor: What is the story behind this piece?\n\nGenevieve Valentine: “Future Perfect” comes from my complicated feelings about performance art—the definition of it, who decides what qualifies as art, where “real art” is experienced, and the limitations to art’s power, especially against the power of the state. Despite the space in the museum dedicated to “Adaptive Memory”—in which artist Cora repeatedly cooks and serves a dinner she claims her grandmother once made—the space around her is claustrophobic; she’s surrounded by physical reminders of art that came before it, and we’re surrounded by the curator’s memories of other art exhibits, and how they did, or didn’t, reach their intended audience. (Whoever the actual intended audience might be—another complicated feeling.)\n\nAV: How did this story germinate? Was there a spark of inspiration, or did it come to you slowly?\n\nGV: This story arrived fully formed; I know what I was thinking about in terms of a story about performance art, and looking back, I can point to a lot of the individual elements that I had come across at very different times, all of which informed what the story ended up being—research I had done on hideous ’50s foods, experiences with anonymous comment sections—but the story itself happened quickly.\n\nAE: Is this story part of a larger universe, or is it stand-alone?\n\nGV: Technically this is a stand-alone story; however, at some point I must admit that there’s a Genevieve Valentine Five Minutes From Now Cinematic Universe where a lot of my science fiction seems to take place—my novels Persona and Icon as well as several of my short stories, like “The Nearest Thing” and “Small Medicine”—and this story is certainly located there. (This universe used to be a little farther in the future than that, but the future is barreling towards us increasingly fast.)\n\nAE: How did the title for this piece come to you?\n\nGV: Generally with titles, I either agonize for weeks about it, or I know what it is before I even begin. “Future Perfect” is the title of a piece of performance art that plays continuously in the museum—a short video clip from another performance-art piece hosted there years before, in which two sisters (one of whom is now dead) reminisce about something that happened long ago in high school, while one of them brushes the other’s hair. It hangs heavy over the museum; Cora’s “Adaptive Memory” exhibit is sometimes drowned out by it. Future perfect is the verb tense used when describing something that may or may not have begun yet, and will be completed sometime in the future. Grammatically, that’s a fascinating tension between uncertainty and predestination, and it’s why “Future Perfect” was always the title of that art piece, and of this story.\n\n“Future Perfect” comes from my complicated feelings about performance art— the definition of it, who decides what qualifies as art, where “real art” is experienced, and the limitations to art’s power, especially against the power of the state.\n\nAE: How much or little do current events impact your writing?\n\nGV: If I could look directly into the camera here, I would. Let’s just say that for those who’ve read “Future Perfect,” I think this question will handily answer itself.\n\nAE: Are there any themes that you find yourself returning to throughout your writing? If yes, what and why?\n\nGV: There are very few genre trappings I’m wedded to; I write in several of them. However, if we mean themes in terms of obsessions, I’ve given up trying to avoid my ongoing fascination with performance, artifice, branding, ritual, the perception of art, the psychology of artists, the maintenance of the state, and narrators who know far more information than they’re able to meaningfully act on. I’m sure so long as I never examine why I’m drawn to all those things, I’ll be fine.\n\nAE: What is your process?\n\nGV: Generally my process is to think about something for a while until it feels ready to commit to paper, write a draft in a fugue state, be consumed with self-loathing for an unspecified and variable length of time, and then return to the draft to begin the actual crafting.\n\nAE: What other careers have you had, and how have they affected your writing?\n\nGV: I’ve had many, and they’ve all affected my writing; not every job has been good, but all the effects on my writing have been. “Future Perfect” draws in particular on my time in event management, which involves being in a lot of places at liminal hours, during which they take on a very specific quality that isn’t present when they’re open for business. The night watch shift always knows.\n\nAE: What are you reading right now?\n\nGV: Recent and current books include Katy Simpson Smith’s The Weeds, A Woman of Pleasure by Kiyoko Murata (translated by Juliet Winters Carpenter), Kate Strasdin’s The Dress Diary: Secrets from a Victorian Woman’s Wardrobe, and Wake: The Hidden History of Women-Led Slave Revolts, written by Rebecca Hall and illustrated by Hugo Martínez.\n\nAE: How can our readers follow you and your writing?\n\nGV: I’ve largely retreated from social media, though I occasionally emerge to shout into the wastelands of Twitter at @glvalentine and the fog of Bluesky at @glvalentine. The most reliable place to check for new work is actually genevievevalentine.com, which is fairly regularly updated, and doesn’t require you to sign up for anything at all!\n\nGenevieve Valentine is the author of Mechanique: A Tale of the Circus Tresaulti, The Girls at the Kingfisher Club, Persona, and Icon; she is the recipient of the Crawford Award, and has been shortlisted for the Nebula, Locus, Shirley Jackson, and World Fantasy. Her comics work includes Catwoman and Ghost in the Shell. Her short work has appeared in over a dozen Best of the Year anthologies, including Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy. Her most recent book is the graphic novel Two Graves, alongside artists Ming Doyle and Annie Wu.\n\nRobert Morrell Jr. discusses how his family history and journeys around South Carolina helped inspire his latest story,”A Family Matter.” Read it in our [July/August issue, on sale now!]\n\nAsimov’s Editor: What is the story behind this piece?\n\nRobert Morrell Jr.: Last year I went to the Isle of Palms near Charleston. Along the way, I stopped to visit various relatives across South Carolina. A cousin had recently moved into the Francis Marion National Forest, her house actually bordering on federally protected swamp land. She showed me where her son had shot a charging feral hog (and told me about the neighbor who grills all such kills in the area). Then she took me on an ATV ride to a pitcher plant field, passing by an abandoned trailer that looked like it had fallen from the sky.\n\nAE: Wow, so you had the setting. What sparked the story?\n\nRMJ: Well, after visiting the old places, and reminiscing with relatives, I felt the urge to lean into family history. I wrote the first paragraph thinking of my father, who always regretted getting out of fighter pilot school just as the Korean War ended. What if? That led to genetic identification of remains, which got me to my own DNA report, with its surprises, and the swamp explanation of state multi-racial statistics. I added a little something extra, and we were off! My cousin, hearing what I was up to, pointed to Hell Hole and its beauty pageant. Then she sent me a link to a local TV story about a hunter that got lost there for a night. The story wrote itself after that. It was all I could do to hang on.\n\nAE: Do you particularly relate to any of the characters in this story?\n\nRMJ: All the characters of this story are people I have known, which may surprise those who believe the country has been homogenized by mass media. In my experience, the deeper you go into rural areas, the more the old stereotypes come alive, for better or worse. You could meet all the characters in “A Family Matter” just by driving north on 41 from Charleston. You would have to go down some dirt roads to find them, though.\n\nAE: What made you think of Asimov’s for this story?\n\nRMJ: I’ve enjoyed Asimov’s for many years, and one thing I believe it does well are stories where new technologies affect us in ways we did not expect. At its core, “A Family Matter” is about genetic testing. Across the world, people are getting DNA ancestry reports and learning about their past in ways the old-style DAR genealogists never could (or would!). But how do we process the surprises without some kind of reference? What does it mean when you find family history you never knew about? How do you think about connections to cultures that were forgotten or hidden? Sometimes, we need Science Fiction to go a step further, giving us perspective on the nearer new thing.\n\nAE: Who or what are your greatest influences and inspirations?\n\nRMJ: I listen to a lot of podcasts, mostly history and science. Science Fiction related, I really enjoy “Hugos There” (nominated for a Hugo this year), and got to guest host for its December 2023 episode. Another podcast that has given me a whole fresh spin on Science Fiction is “Hugo Girl!”, (which “won” a Hugo last year). It is a fun and forgiving look at Science Fiction through a feminist lens. There are scenes in “A Family Matter” where I imagined the Hugo Girls reading over my shoulder, and I think the story is better for it.\n\nYou could meet all the characters in “A Family Matter” just by driving north on 41 from Charleston. You would have to go down some dirt roads to find them, though.\n\nAE: Are there any themes that you find yourself returning to throughout your writing? If yes, what and why?\n\nRMJ: Yes. I usually write one remove from “earth-shaking events” and involve characters not normally considered heroes. They are not the hyper-competent astronaut making first contact, or the genius scientist making an important discovery. They are everyday people finding their daily lives being altered in big or little ways by a larger story. Their actions may have significant effects on the world, but their focus is on the personal: family, friends, and home. I think this comes from my hospital career, which was behind the scenes from the doctors and nurses (first in microbiology, then in oncology research computing). I don’t begrudge the hero their story, but think there are things to see away from the spotlight.\n\nAE: What is your process?\n\nRMJ: Having been a chess player and computer programmer, you would think I plan everything out, but I do the opposite. I start without knowing, and sometime intentionally write myself into corners. Then I wake up at four in the morning and the solution is there, fully formed. It’s a magical experience, and I enjoy it so much that it’s a letdown when I finally understand the whole story. After that it is all just typing.\n\nAE: What other projects are you currently working on?\n\nRMJ: I am six chapters into my fourth novel, a space opera. The one I most recently finished, a first contact novel, has the same humor and tone as “A Family Matter”, and is under consideration at Angry Robot. (I view the first two as practice novels and are safely hidden away.) My current habit is to write a chapter, then do a short piece. I used to skydive, and am helping an old BASE jumper (BASE# 37!) edit his autobiography. There is a prequel story to the space opera novel in the works which involves BASE jumping and some stories about my late brother, who was also an early BASE jumper. (I myself only jumped out of airplanes; the way God intended.)\n\nAE: What Science Fiction prediction would you like to see come true?\n\nRMJ: First contact, without a doubt. I am worried it is going to happen right after I die. If so, I will demand a refund.\n\nAE: What are you reading right now?\n\nRMJ: Dangerously Funny by David Bianculli, about the Smothers Brothers: history is just true Science Fiction. Red Team Blues by Cory Doctorow: I could not resist the idea of a forensic accountant.\n\nAE: What in the story did you leave out?\n\nRMJ: I am so glad you asked that! It has been bothering me since I finished the story. Most people, when they think of swamps, picture massive ancient trees. Sadly, Hell Hole and the entire Francis Marion National Forest are not like that anymore. In 1989 Hurricane Hugo levelled the Forest. Today all the trees are uniformly thirty-five years old, mostly pines. Tall, but not behemoths. Any house built since then is on stilts. Lyle would have sprained his ankle jumping out that window. How Great Granny’s house survived and never got to code, I left unsaid.\n\nAE: How can our readers follow you and your writing?\n\nRMJ: @Wallet55 on Bluesky, Mastodon and “Twitter” in descending order of frequency. Warning: there are a lot of cat photos. Squeaky, the cat in “A Family Matter” is there, but don’t tell him I changed his gender. He is sensitive about that since we took him to the vet.\n\nBob Morrell is a South Carolina native living in the frozen wastes of North Carolina. He is husband to a retired librarian and servant to four formerly feral felines. “A Family Matter” is his first science fiction publication in decades, after a distracting career in medical research computing.\n\nJohn Richard Trtek returns to the pages of Asimov’s with another story featuring his protagonist M. Picot. In this enlightening interview, learn more about what inspired Trtek’s new story, “The Sixteenth Circumstance” in our [July/August issue, on sale now!], and find out how the author uses an improvisational writing process to his advantage.\n\nAsimov’s Editor: What is the story behind this piece?\n\nJohn Richard Trtek: “La Terrienne” was the first story to feature M. Picot, and the intention was always to continue his story arc, with the character evolving as time went on. “The Sixteenth Circumtance” is the second installment in this saga.\n\nAE: How did this story germinate? Was there a spark of inspiration, or did it come to you slowly?\n\nJRT: As suggested by the previous answer, the story itself was always going to be written at some point. Its actual creation was by accretion of various elements, some of them not initially related. In the previous Picot story, for example, I had made mention of the Phastines and the Phastine Emptiness without explaining either, other than suggesting that the former was a quasi-religious group and the latter an intragalactic void of some sort. Meanwhile, I already had in hand the notion of beings who were trying to give every piece of matter life by eating them, and when I began this story I attached the Phastine name to them, realizing that the Emptiness fit right in with that move. In similar fashion, I appropriated other ideas, names and plot elements I had sitting around in order to flesh out the setting and plot as I wrote the tale.\n\nAE: Is this story part of a larger universe, or is it stand-alone?\n\nJRT: Well, it’s meant to be both. My hope is that there is sufficient background, character development and plot to allow the story to stand by itself, while leaving room open for further exploration of both Picot and the Farther Reach.\n\nAE: How did the title for this piece come to you?\n\nJRT: The title popped into my head as my wife and I were driving home from having lunch out. Initially, it featured a different ordinal number; I don’t remember which one. Eventually, I settled on “sixteenth” because it sounded the best. It was only later that it was attached to the story—another example of composing by accretion.\n\nI make it up, revise it, and then make up more as I go along, having a rough idea of where I’m going but not necessarily sure of what path I will be taking.\n\nAE: How much or little do current events impact your writing?\n\nJRT: Specific current events themselves play virtually no role in my writing, though occasionally the human emotions and reactions that arise as a result of them may influence the directions I take in certain pieces. I am one of those who believes fiction in whatever form—novels, short stories, plays, film and television—is a very poor vehicle for the promotion of specific public policies or personal philosophies. Particular human traits may be illuminated quite well by political events, and that itself may inspire a story, but the politics and fiction in general just don’t mix well, in my view.\n\nAE: What is your process?\n\nJRT: I don’t have a fixed process as such, but, looking back, I realize that most of the fiction I write springs from one particular element—a title, a scene, a character—and my subsequent efforts to create an entire story around that element is largely improvisational. I make it up, revise it, and then make up more as I go along, having a rough idea of where I’m going but not necessarily sure of what path I will be taking.\n\nAE: What inspired you to start writing?\n\nJRT: I don’t know; I suppose the desire may be intrinsic to my character. I am one of those who made up entire countries, continents and histories as a child. Early on in grade school, I wrote and illustrated a short story about a character visiting the Moon and, growing up during the Silver Age of super-heroes, I thought for a time of becoming a comic book writer and artist, though later, as an adult, I never seriously considered writing as a career. I did dabble now and then, but it was only after retiring from teaching that I had enough time to make a stab at serious composition.\n\nAE: What other projects are you currently working on?\n\nJRT: I’m writing a holiday play to offer to a local theater group, plus an alternate history novella set in the 19th century, as well as a third M. Picot tale and a short story about that hoariest of cliches: alien invasion.\n\nAE: If you could choose one SFnal universe to live in, what universe would it be, and why?\n\nJRT: Perhaps any non-dystopian future in which interstellar travel is a working option. When one begins to think on a truly long-term scale, matters seem a bit hopeless what with the Sun eventually expanding into red giant phase and taking the terrestrial planets with it. Humanity’s going to be in need of a ride, and it would be nice knowing that it’s on its way.\n\nAE:What are you reading right now?\n\nJRT: I am doing my usual mix of non-fiction, short fiction and a novel. In that order, my current reading list is Bernal Diaz’s The Conquest of Mexico, The Collected Stories of Stefan Zweig, and The Getaway by Jim Thompson.\n\nAE: Do you have any advice for up-and-coming writers?\n\nJRT: Be patient, but don’t use patience as an excuse for nonaction.\n\nJohn Richard Trtek is an Oregon native and grew up as an only child on land that had originally been his grandparents’ farm, and so he had wide spaces that could be filled with imagination. Originally intending to become an astrophysicist, Trtek decided in graduate school that he had neither the talent nor the temperament for it, and so he became a high school physics teacher instead. Upon retirement, Trtek volunteered for ten years at a classical radio station. He’s had an interest in writing since grade school, though as an adult Trtek never intended to make his living from it. However, with a little more free time available than before, Trtek is able to make a modest try at it. Trtek and his wife live in the Ladd’s Addition neighborhood of Portland.\n\nby Chris Campbell\n\nChris Campbell discusses cosmic horror while pointing to a few examples of how Black authors are pushing the genre forward. Grab a copy of our [May/June issue, on sale now] to read Campbell’s novelette In the Palace of Science\n\nMy novelette In the Palace of Science, published in the (May/June 2024) issue of Asimov’s magazine, joins a rapidly growing body of literature by Black writers ostensibly working within the subgenre of cosmic horror. I use the term ostensibly because while these works sit comfortably within the framework of the Afrofuturist movement, their relationship with cosmic horror is considerably more complex. Afro-futurism is a movement that centers on the significance of black people, our history, and our stories. Cosmic horror, at its core, is about the absolute insignificance of humanity and the indifference of the universe to us. As defined, these modes of storytelling, while not incompatible, are clearly in conflict.\n\nThere is, of course, another conflict that is readily apparent to those with more than a passing familiarity with the history of cosmic horror: the virulent racism of H.P. Lovecraft, the father of the subgenre. Wrestling with Lovecraft’s more troublesome beliefs is a matter of perennial debate within speculative fiction circles. This debate has spawned numerous essays that do a fine job explaining why so many fans and writers are unwilling to sweep Lovecraft’s work along with his problematic legacy into the dustbin of history. There are also numerous essays and scholarly papers that explore aspects of Lovecraft’s racism, as it appears in his works, in terms of its cultural impact and in the context of the ever-expanding role that BIPOC writers are playing in modern cosmic horror. For the most part, the ongoing discussion about the deconstruction of racism within cosmic horror has been about who is doing it and why it is essential. This essay is not about that, at least not directly. For the few thousand words I have here, I want to explore some examples of how it is being done.\n\nFor this discussion of Afro-cosmicism, I’ll explore some of the tools employed by Victor LaValle in his Shirley Jackson award-winning novella The Ballad of Black Tom, Zin Rocklin in their Shirley Jackson award-winning novella Flowers For the Sea, and my story In the Palace of Science.\n\nLaValle wrote The Ballad of Black Tom as a direct response to one of HP Lovecraft’s more openly racist stories, The Horror at Red Hook. Lavelle also dedicates the piece “for H.P. Lovecraft, with all my conflicted feelings.” Within the text of The Ballad of Black Tom LaValle puts his finger on the crux of the conflict Afro-cosmicism has with cosmic horror. A deep and indescribable dread at the notion of an indifferent universe is a luxury only afforded to a person who has not experienced the malice of structural racism.\n\nThe prose in The Ballad of Black Tom notably sets it apart from Lovecraft’s work. Lovecraft takes considerable inspiration from gothic writers, specifically Poe. While the quality of Lovecraft’s prose is somewhat contentious, there is no doubt that his style is closely identified with how cosmic horror should feel, evoking an almost otherworldly dream space for the narratives to take place in. In Black Tom, LaValle eschews any indulgence in favor of prose that brings a story set in the Jazz Age into an urgent and present now.\n\nThis restraint allows a nuanced approach to characterizing the narrative’s protagonist, Tom, by enabling the reader to notice how Tom employs diction as a method of agency and subterfuge—code-switching at critical moments to adapt to different circumstances and challenges he faces throughout the narrative.\n\nThis use of unadorned prose also bridges the Harlem Renaissance with the modern Black Lives Matter era in a manner that offers a damning commentary on America’s progress towards racial conciliation over the previous century.\n\nTom’s journey highlights this with how it mirrors the Harlem Renaissance—beginning fueled by the optimism of the roaring twenties and ending with a sense of disenfranchisement that uproots him from his hostile native soil. This is a progression similar to the many prominent figures during the Harlem Renaissance who eventually found a greater sense of belonging as ex-pats living in Paris.\n\nAnother notable feature of the way the piece engages with the Harlem Renaissance is how it integrates the great migration and the ensuing cultural disconnect between formerly enslaved people and their descendants into the narrative, including how some of the intergenerational divide was bridged, allowing much of the African American oral tradition to survive when it was at the brink of being lost forever. During the Harlem Renaissance, the cultural anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston and the folklorist Thomas Washington Talley were part of a movement to catalog the folklore of the last generation of freed people before it was too late, as they were already well into their advancing years. This persistence of cultural memory after the great migration in a tenuous link in an almost broken chain is replicated in Tom’s relationship with his father, who undertook the great migration. When we meet Tom, he has very little interest in music, a defining feature of his parents. To him, the guitar is little more than another bit of useful camouflage. However, after Tom experiences an awakening, he forms a deep connection with his father through the sharing of music, culminating with the transmission of powerful ancestral conjure music to Tom from his father.\n\nAfro-futurism is a movement that centers on the significance of black people, our history, and our stories. Cosmic horror, at its core, is about the absolute insignificance of humanity and the indifference of the universe to us. As defined, these modes of storytelling, while not incompatible, are clearly in conflict.\n\nThe Ballad of Black Tom is a deeply layered work, so a full accounting of its themes and symbols is beyond the scope of a short essay. However, I want to draw attention to two layers we can use to explore the work’s relationship with cosmic horror.\n\nThe first is the representation of unrestrained violence the racial caste system encourages and enables. The turning point of the story takes place in the aftermath of a senseless shooting where the victim represents every black person ever shot while holding something harmless. The malevolence of the act is emphasized by the casual way the gun is emptied into the man, only to be reloaded and emptied again. This use of unrestrained violence is returned to in the climax when an entire block of buildings is razed through the use of militarized weaponry. Invoking not only outrages like the Tulsa Massacre, which occurred only a few years prior to the date the book is set in but also more recent atrocities like the MOVE bombing. The two significant acts of violence, along with many of the smaller indignities Tom experiences at the hands of the police, are the real source of horror in the story, not the eldritch abomination that lay just beyond the threshold. Or, as Tananarive Due puts it, “Black History is Black Horror.”\n\nThe other layers of symbols that I want to draw attention to are the ones surrounding Tom. He is a trickster who travels freely, often using his clothing/garments as a key to allow safe passage. He is connected with music, and in his first iteration, he is at his most powerful when he learns ancestral conjure magic from his father. These identifying markers associate him with the traditional African American folk hero High John the Conqueror. Zora Neale Hurston is generally recognized as the first person to write about High John the Conqueror, pulling him out of the oral tradition and into print.\n\nHigh John himself is a complicated figure with numerous interpretations. However, in the United States, he embraces cunning over violence, spiritual transcendence as revolutionary, and remains unconquered and unbroken even when chained. Regardless of his cunning and ability to adapt to shifting circumstances, Tom does not remain unbroken, and when he breaks, he turns to the other form of power his father left in his hands. In this transformation, we see Tom begin to resemble the Orisha. High John is identified with Eshu, a trickster who shares many of High John’s features but whose nature also vacillates between a benign trickster guide and a baneful, bloody-handed force of devastation.\n\nThe use of Tom’s experience to give the reader a personal story that echoes the historical context and links us not only with African American oral tradition but reaches back to its deeper African roots throughout the narrative is a masterclass in the principles of Afro-futurism. Doing all of this within a story that uses Lovecraft’s mythos and worldbuilding with an eye to his complicated legacy allows this accomplishment and the story’s themes to shine all the brighter.\n\nZin Rocklyn’s Flowers for the Sea is a work that was inspired directly by The Ballad of Black Tom. Set in an unknowable time and place in some other world during the aftermath of an endless flood. The Intradiluvian backdrop for the story also makes it a spiritual successor to Black Tom, wrestling with and embracing the previous work’s eventual outcome. Like LaValle, Rocklyn uses the story’s dedication to orient us as readers, “To Courtney, for teaching me that my anger is a gift.” This message was bound to resonate with and comfort many Black people during the post-Obama era and the rising tide of white nationalism that came with it. When facing betrayal, anger can be a gift because, unlike sadness, it pushes outward against the world rather than inward against the heart.\n\nIn Flowers, Rocklyn turns this core of anger into a tool for building a work of art that captures the imagination and recontextualizes unimaginable, untamable anger as something that can sustain just as easily as it can destroy\n\nWhen I asked Rocklyn how they interact with the problematic legacy of cosmic horror, the answer was simple: “I’ll read something and know I can do it better.”\n\nThis well-earned confidence is fully displayed in the piece’s lyrical and haunting prose. Prose that, like Lovecraft’s, emphasizes the alien and dreamlike state the novella uses to great effect as we shift between past, present, and oracular visions of the future. Flower’s prose also brings it right up against, if not directly into, the tradition of epic poetry. Like Byron, Rocklyn weaves together anger, violence, eroticism, and liberation. “I kinda want to scare my readers and then make them horney.” Rocklyn is comfortable wearing the mantle of a modern-day Black Byronist, linking their work to a literary tradition in African American poetry inspired by Byron during the eighteen hundreds.\n\nThematically, Flower’s is a piece in deep conversation with intersectionality, aiming its rage at the patriarchy and systemic racism, two systems of oppression that feed off and support each other. Using the mythic space the story occupies, Rocklyn takes the reader through an inversion of the primeval history of the Book of Genesis, forging a new cosmology where Iraxi, in the role of Eve, step by step unwinds the fall and returns to paradise, removing herself from the clutches of the patriarchy and the tools it used to oppressor her like shame.\n\nRight alongside their use of the flood as a means of contending with the patriarchy, Rocklyn also uses this setting to weave in themes of the middle passage and race-based oppression. Iraxi is forced to remain below deck for extended periods, valued only as a body, not a person, and is a victim of genocide. Like LeValle, Rocklyn also uses their commentary on history to show the persistence of violence within America’s racial caste system, with symbols that directly evoke the recent uptick of church burning with the resurgence of the white power movement.\n\nThis exploration of intersectionality extends to the characters within the narrative who represent the many faces of oppression. A physically dominating misogynist, a passive bystander, and an insidious female misogynoir who assures Iraxi she is an ally when, in fact, she is anything but.\n\nRocklyn’s method of blending biblical patriarchy, the colonial trade in human bondage with the many-tentacled creatures that lurk beneath the waves to deliver a piece that revels in celebrating the very thing that traditional cosmic horror fears is an astounding accomplishment.\n\nI won’t be unpacking In the Palace of Science like I did these two other works of Afro-Cosmicism; with new work, it’s best to step back and hold that place of discovery for the readers. However, I will share the two men whose lives most inspired the piece.\n\nThe first is ​​Lewis Latimer, the often-overlooked designer of the improved carbon filaments for light bulbs. His work on the light bulb’s design produced a dramatic increase in luminosity along with a sizable extension of lifetime hours. These practical and functional improvements were absolutely necessary for their mass market adoption.\n\nThe second is Thomas Washington Talley, the first Black chemistry professor to teach at a major American university and the collector of two formative volumes of African American oral folktales. I used Talley’s work, specifically the forwards to his volume The Negro Traditions, in the development of the narrator’s voice as a scientist and scholar with a keen sense of race and class consciousness informing his oral performance.\n\nBoth Latimer and Talley are men with noteworthy accomplishments who nonetheless faded into insignificance because they lived within a dominant culture that made no room for their excellence to be celebrated. The mythologizing of Edison erased Latimer’s contributions, while Talley’s achievements as a folklorist disappeared into the shadow of Chandler Harris.\n\nThe power of Afro-cosmicism comes from an understanding that beneath the apparent conflict between Afro-futurism and cosmic horror, there is a deeper truth. Lovecraft’s fears, as explored in cosmic horror, often boiled down to the possibility that someone like him would become a victim of something akin to the horrors and degradations that the global majority faced as a result of Western imperialism. That Lovecraft could be rendered as insignificant as Latimer and Talley were to the history books by forces far beyond his control. In this, the writers of Afro-Cosmicism have found a deep well of resonance to draw from that uses the symbols and concepts from both of the traditions they are working in to enhance rather than diminish when deployed within the same narrative.\n\nWhile the sub-genre of Afro-Cosmisicm is not exactly new, tracing its roots to the work of the mother of Afro-futurism, Octavia Butler, it has assuredly picked up steam in recent years. With writers like N.K. Jemisin, Victor LaValle, Donyae Coles, P. Djéli Clark, and Zin Rocklyn leading the charge, it is quickly becoming one of the most exciting spaces within the speculative fiction landscape.\n\nChris Campbell <@chriscampbell.bsky.social> is a speculative fiction writer whose words have appeared in FIYAH, Nightlight, and khōréō. His first story for Asimov’s is an homage to Lewis Latimer, the often overlooked designer of the improved carbon filaments that made light bulbs both practical and functional, and Thomas Washington Talley, the first Black chemistry professor to teach at a major American university and the collector of two formative volumes of African American oral folktales.\n\nElena Pavlova has realized her dream of getting a story published in Asimov’s with her latest work, “Renting to Killers,” available in [May/June issue, on sale now!] Get to know the Bulgarian author in this insightful Q&A that discusses writers block, the hopefulness of modern SF, and more.\n\nAsimov’s Editor: Is this story part of a larger universe, or is it stand-alone?\n\nElena Pavlova: The story is part of a Hellverse, containing 2 game-books, 1 novel and a few short stories, most of them published in Bulgarian in different anthologies during the years. All of these describe a post-apocalyptic world where the reality had been turned inside-out and parallel timelines collided but people still have hope and fight to keep civilization on the mend.\n\nAE: Do you particularly relate to any of the characters in this story?\n\nEP: In a way, I’m Davis: completely out of place in the city and between people, but well versed for my other habitat, and willing to write about it. At the time this story was written, I too was “between lives” and in a limbo of sorts.\n\nAE: How did the title for this piece come to you?\n\nEP: The Bulgarian title can be translated as “The Killer Lives Downstairs” but the English variant of the story is revamped and has lots of changes (the perks of self-translating—you can change and rewrite, and make a new story out of it.) This revamped story needed a new and better title, and here it is.\n\nAE: What is your history with Asimov’s?\n\nEP: Having a story published in Asimov’s Magazine is a childhood dream of mine and so I’ve sent a couple of pieces its way, hoping they will be worthy of publishing. Now my dream has come true!\n\nAE: Who or what are your greatest influences and inspirations?\n\nEP: I try to read a lot—at least 100 books yearly or more—and to constantly learn new tricks; still I’d say my greatest influences and inspirations come from the SF of the 80s and 90s, with its gorgeous, grand flights of imagination; and today’s SF&F teaches us (me, at least) to imagine not only with the head but also with the heart.\n\nAE: How much or little do current events impact your writing?\n\nEP: A lot, in fact. One cannot just go and write without taking into account the Real Life(™) all around us. So bits and pieces of reality make their way into my stories, and vice versa. There is a novelette I had written for a Bulgarian SF contest, and it had almost half of the world wiped out in a pandemic; then Covid-19 happened and I pulled the novelette out for, well, it was an RL(™) pandemic going on. I’m still thinking of how to better revamp this story, 4 years later.\n\nThat’s the true writer’s block for me: a peaceful, luring moment of emptiness. The best advice on that is to sit and write through that emptiness. Just write, with time 1000 monkeys will recreate Shakespeare’s masterpieces and if they can do it, so can I.\n\nAE: What is your process?\n\nEP: For me, it’s about the story, the journey—I’m curious to see where the idea will take me and I don’t plan beforehand. Which is funny, because Life had placed me as a writer for a computer game (Scars of Honor MMORPG) and that’s all about planning and meticulous worldbuilding and storybuilding.\n\nSometimes ideas are coming, crying so loud in my head that I have to put away everything else and just write that story; this was for example the case with “Renting to Killers.”\n\nAE: How do you deal with writers’ block?\n\nEP: I’ve come to realize that, if a story is stuck, then probably I’ve messed something up, so I go back and do revisions to try and find out the point I left the tracks of the story. It usually helps. But this is more a case of writing oneself in a corner.\n\nThen, sometimes, it’s the mind that is stuck—there are simply no stories to tell. Not ideas. That’s the true writer’s block for me: a peaceful, luring moment of emptiness. The best advice on that is to sit and write through that emptiness. Just write, with time 1000 monkeys will recreate Shakespeare’s masterpieces and if they can do it, so can I 🙂\n\nAE: What SFnal prediction would you like to see come true?\n\nEP: The hopeful futures, most of all: that we can still save Earth; save ourselves and redeem a worthy, comfortable way of living for everybody—and go colonizing other worlds.\n\nI’ll all for the Galaxy-wide Cosmic Empires. Glory to the heroes, peace to all worlds!\n\nAE: What are you reading right now?\n\nEP: Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky. Nona the Ninth by Tamsin Muir follows on the TBR list but I’ll most probably be reading my way through the Hugo nominations in the next months. The Hugo vote requires responsible decisions.\n\nAE: What other careers have you had, and how have they affected your writing?\n\nEP: I’m an all round cynological judge (cynology is a science about dogs) and I have always loved and was owned by dogs. For more than 10 years I’ve been a secretary for a Cynology federation and dogs (and sometimes cats) often sneak into my stories.\n\nAE: How can our readers follow you and your writing? (IE: Social media handles, website URL…)\n\nEP: https://www.facebook.com/pisatelskoe.kafe — but it is kept mostly in Bulgarian. Nice pics of dogs though 🙂\n\nAnd here I am on BlueSky: @hellena.bsky.social — less dogs and kept mostly in English.\n\nElena Pavlova lives in Montana, Bulgaria. Her short stories have appeared in various Bulgarian anthologies and magazines, winning awards from national competitions. In 2021, her novel Christmas Carolers vs Hallus Beasts won the ESFS Best Work for Children award. Also in 2021 she was awarded the SLF’s Diverse Worlds grant. Most recently a story of hers, translated by her and D.Sivilova, made it to the shortlist of BSFA awards in 2024.\n\nHer short stories “Love in the Time of Con Crud”, “Two Moons” and “A Pilgrimage to Memories Tattooed”appeared in Future Science Fiction Digest #3 in 2019 and Compelling Science Fiction #15 in 2020 and in Samovar issue 26 in 2023, respectively.\n\nby Ray Nayler\n\nRay Nayler discusses a childhood event that helped shape the rest of his life, and inspired his latest story, “Charon’s Final Passenger,” from our [March/April issue, on sale now!]\n\nI was kidnapped when I was three years old.\n\nIt was not by a stranger (an exceedingly rare form of kidnapping, to which we devote a lot of cultural handwringing and television shows). Instead, it was the most common kind of child abduction: I was kidnapped by my father.\n\nMy mother had left my father twice—once in Quebec, and again in California, after he came begging for her to take her back. He was able to convince her for a while: he had a way of convincing people—a charm that was a combination of his accent, his artistic pretensions, his frenetic energy, and his fragile good looks.\n\nHe was also, unnoticed by the people around him, displaying the first signs of the severe schizophrenia which, in late 2022, claimed his life. But this was not 2022: it was 1979. He was young (my god, they were so young, neither one of them yet 25). Any odd mannerisms he had could be attributed to his rural origins in Quebec’s north, where he was the youngest son in a family of fourteen, or his overwhelmingly large ego: he was an Artist, capital A, and expected everyone around him to treat him like one.\n\nMy mother left him the second time when, coming home from work, she found the apartment empty. She finally tracked us down at The Starry Plough, the local bar, where he was passing me around from one person to another while he drank away our money.\n\nShe’d had enough. She kicked him out. As expected, he quickly took up with another woman, the daughter of the man who owned the gas station where he sometimes worked. The separation was amiable enough, and they worked out a custody arrangement while the divorce went through.\n\nBut after one of my visitations with him, my mother called his girlfriend to tell her she was headed over to pick me up. Was my father there?\n\n“Didn’t you know?” the woman said. “We broke up. I kicked him out. He’s been gone for over a week.”\n\nMy mother understood immediately what had happened. My father had done what he had threatened to do once during an argument. It was a statement she had thought was an empty threat, made in the heat of the moment. Now, too late, she understood it had been a real threat, and one he had followed through on. He had taken me away. And that meant back to Quebec—over 3,000 miles distant, and across an international border.\n\nMy mother told me, “I was paralyzed. I could hear my own blood in my ears. It was the most terrifying thing that ever happened to me in my life.”\n\nHe had left with me the day he picked me up. He took me to Tilden Park, near our home, where we rode the miniature railway. Then, carrying only a backpack, he hitchhiked with me in tow all the way to Vancouver. He fed me out of vending machines and at gas station cafés. In Vancouver he took a train to Montreal, and then a bus north to the village where he was born, on the shore of Lac St. Jean.\n\nHistory—our real history—is just one of many possible paths, as contingent on the seemingly incidental and the decisions of a moment as the fatal route of Franz Ferdianand’s motorcade, or the bomb that might have killed Hitler but did not, or so many other moments in which the world is changed—or not changed—and the consequence becomes our reality.\n\nBy the time my mother got to Canada, he was moving from place to place, leaving me in the care of various relatives. She went to a lawyer to see what could be done to get me back. The lawyer was blunt—there wasn’t much. There was no finalized divorce. Quebec was unlikely to take US court decisions about custody or anything else very seriously. To them, I would be a French-speaking kid living with my legal father, and my English-speaking mother would be the one trying to take me away. In the middle of Quebec’s cultural awakening and separatist movement, her chances of getting me back were not good. I might spend years in protective custody while the courts came to a decision.\n\nSo my mother made a decision. She would kidnap me back.\n\nContacting one of my father’s brothers, she convinced him to help her. When my father left me briefly in his brother’s care, he drove me to my mother.\n\n“Were you scared?” My mother asked me when she saw me.\n\n“Nah,” I said. “I knew you would come.”\n\nShe took me on a bus to Montreal, and then to the airport.\n\nAs we crossed through customs, it almost fell apart. My mother had accidentally packed my passport and documents into our checked luggage. The French-Canadian authorities were suspicious. “How do we know he is your son? How do we know you aren’t kidnapping him?” One of them said, probably half-joking, but hitting the mark.\n\nAnd then a minor miracle appeared. The US security noticed that I was wearing a set of pearl-handled toy revolvers in a belt and holsters. My prize possession, they had accompanied me throughout this entire odyssey. They insisted that I would not be able to board the plane with them, and they would need to confiscate them. I began, apparently for the first time during all of this, to cry.\n\nThis enraged the French-Canadians, who got into a furious argument with the US authorities over their idiotic rule, and their bullying of a little boy. By the time they had extracted a promise that the toy guns would be mailed to me, everyone had forgotten about my lack of documents. We boarded the plane for San Francisco.\n\nA few weeks later the toy guns arrived, as promised.\n\nBut I am haunted by a ghost. What would have happened if my mother had not managed to get me back? What if she had not made the bold decision to kidnap me? What if she had not gotten away with it? What if I had languished instead in protective custody, passed around foster homes in a broken system? What if the French-Canadian courts had not decided in her favor in the end? After all, it was the worst possible time to try to convince authorities in Quebec of the rights an English-speaking mother from California should have over a French-Canadian child she intended to take away from his “heritage.”\n\nThe ghost haunting me is this alternate self—the one who, instead of growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area in California, grew up in northern Quebec, entangled with a father in mental distress and a large, complex family struggling with all the intricate problems of rural poverty.\n\nThat person would have been nothing at all like the person I am today: so much of what I now am relies on my mother’s decision. Her decision is a crossroads, and the other way leads to a life very different from the one I am now leading. And, I would argue, to a person who is fundamentally different from the person I am now. I call that person a ghost because I sometimes almost see him—this person who might have been, but was not.\n\nThis is the root of my fascination with alternate histories—the worlds that might have been if a different path was opened up by a decision, or by luck, or by happenstance. History—our real history—is just one of many possible paths, as contingent on the seemingly incidental and the decisions of a moment as the fatal route of Franz Ferdianand’s motorcade, or the bomb that might have killed Hitler but did not, or so many other moments in which the world is changed—or not changed—and the consequence becomes our reality.\n\n“Charon’s Final Passenger,” in this issue of Asimov’s, is an exploration of this. A sequel to “The Disintegration Loops” and “A Rocket for Dimitrios,” the story takes place in the same timeline as my stories “Father” and “Berb by Berb,” all of which were published in Asimov’s (and all of which are available at raynayler.net). “Charon’s Final Passenger” continues to trace a path from an alternate 1938 in which a flying saucer crashes in the New Mexico desert, and the United States uses reverse-engineered technology to defeat not only the Nazis and the imperialist Japan, but also the Soviet Union and the communist forces in China, becoming a unilateral global superpower with no real checks against its will. What happens to a country no-one can resist? What happens to the world, with such a country in it?\n\nFar from being frivolous, I think alternate histories help us, just like science fiction stories set in the future, to better examine our own society and its possibilities. Like those stories, alternate histories predicate a world based upon an alteration. In so doing, they are able to explore the consequences of “what if” in an engaging way—but they also allow us to turn the lens on the world we are reading from and to explore the question of “why this?”\n\nWhat my own alternate history teaches me is humility. I am aware of how much luck and happenstance has been involved in allowing me to be where I am today. When I think of the series of seemingly random events that brought me to where I am, that allowed me the life I have, I know I cannot take much credit for what I have been given.\n\nBut not all of those events were random: some were the result of determination and personal will. I feel a great sense of gratitude to this extraordinary woman, my mother in 1979. Twenty-four years old, alone, extraordinarily brave—she saved me. I owe her the shape of this life, and it’s a debt I cannot ever fully pay.\n\nWhen you think about it, all of us are living out our personal alternate histories, inhabiting one of the million branches of “what if?” I think it is also good for us to take a look at some of the turning points in our lives and think, “why this?”\n\nAnd, where deserved, give thanks.\n\nRay Nayler is the author of the critically acclaimed, Locus-Award-winning novel The Mountain in the Sea, published in the U.S. by MCDxFSG and in the UK by Weidenfeld & Nicolson.
