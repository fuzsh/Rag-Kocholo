From the back cover:

The author of Day of the Triffids, writing ten years before the first moon-landing, excitingly plots the stages in the exploration of the Solar System.

The 'outward urge' was a factor in the Troon inheritance. It rocketed successive generations of the Troon family into space. The episodes related in John Wyndham's novel show Troons involved in the building of the Space-Station, the occupation of the Moon, the first landing on Mars, and the trouble about Venus and the asteroids.
