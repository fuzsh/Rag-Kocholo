I like how he returned and filled in a bland entry of what he had done.\n\nBland. Not what it sounds like; it meant so much to so many.\n\nCan just see Jerry waving his fist saying: Damn Englander!\n\nI just re-read the log and I wonder if any of the 61 photos can be found?\n\nI can also see Spielberg doing a bio-pic and using some of the original photos in the closing sequence.\n\nMaybe I should try and buy up the movie rights and see if I can make a little bank.\n\nThis has Hollywood written all over it."
