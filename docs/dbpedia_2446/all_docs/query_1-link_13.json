The hope is that other researchers like you will join the study to help make it a valuable reference point for other genealogists who are researching or have an interest in the Gatward name.\n\nAs a One Name Study, this project is not limited to persons who are related biologically. Individual studies can be used to branch out the research into specific methods and areas of interest, such as geographically (England Gatward's), by time period (18th Century Gatward's), or by topic (Gatward DNA, Gatward Occupations, Gatward Statistics). These studies may also include a number of family branches which have no immediate link with each other. Some researchers may even be motivated to go beyond the profile identification and research stage to compile fully sourced, single-family histories of some of the families they discover through this name study project.\n\nAlso see the related surnames and surname variants.\n\nHow to Join\n\nTo join the Gatward Name Study, first start out by browsing our current research pages to see if there is a specific study ongoing that fits your interests. If so, feel free to add your name to the Membership list below, post an introduction comment on the specific team page, and then dive right in!\n\nIf a research page does not yet exist for your particular area of interest, please contact the Name Study Coordinator: Terry Gatward for assistance.\n\nOnce you are ready to go, you can also show your project affiliation with the ONS Member Sticker:\n\n{{Member|ONS|name=Gatward}}\n\nResearch Pages\n\nHere are some of the current research pages included in the study. I'll be working on them, and could use your help!\n\nGatward - there are now Gatwards worldwide - most in England but also USA, Canada, Australia, NZ, Spain, India, Thailand etc I have researched the Gatwards and have 3 main Family Trees that I can link most Gatwards back to. There are some loose ends and the big goal is to try to connect these trees. I started off with 5 trees so there has been progress! I am ready and willing to try to connect any Gatward's onto one of these trees. The spelling of the name in early records was sometimes Le Gatward or Gateward or in Essex Gateway and in Cambridgeshire there are a lot more variations. John Gateward went to USA in 1666 and started the Gateward of USA Family. There are now more Gateward's than Gatward's.\n\nGattward - two small family offshoots from the Gatward family. One was located in the Worcester area of England and the other in London. The Worcester family has spread to South America. I am confident about connecting Gattwards to their tree.\n\nGatwood - people with this name are often from the Gatward or Gateward families. Even today Gatwood is a common misspelling of Gatward. There are many families that have generations of using the Gatwood name. Care always needs to be taken in the USA and Canada as a Gatwood may be from the English (Gatward) or USA (Gateward) trees.\n\nNotable Gatwards - I like to research and write Family History Papers on any Notable Gatward that I find - John Gatward Highwayman, Ken Gatward and his daring WW2 flight over Paris, Joseph Gatward who became Joseph Lopez and fought in the American Civil War, William Gatward who emigrated to the Australian Goldfields but ended up starting a family in Fiji. Let me know if you have found a notable Gatward\n\nCommon Gatward trades - there are three I have found - the Jewelwers from Hitchin, the Wheelwrights of Cambridgeshire and the Butchers of Essex\n\nThe Gatward Coat of Arms - there is still some research to be completed to understand the family behind the Gatward COA\n\nLinking the Gatward and Gateward families is a long-held ambition as the origins of John Gateward in England are speculative and not proven anywhere.\n\nIf you have a Gatward, Gattward or Gatwood and are not sure how they link into one of the Family Trees let me know as I enjoy taking on such a challenge.\n\nMembership\n\nRelated Surnames and Surname Variants\n\nGattward\n\nGatwood"
