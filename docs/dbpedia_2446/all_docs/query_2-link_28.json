        "text": "Making families: organizational boundary work in US egg and sperm donation.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnson, Katherine M\n\n2013-12-01\n\nEgg and sperm donation can create distinct issues for designating family boundaries. These issues come to the forefront as relations between donors, recipients, and donor-conceived children have been shifting from anonymous to more open arrangements in the US and other western countries. In this study, I address US organizational practices and family boundary construction. Fertility clinics, egg donation agencies, and sperm banks are central providers of US gamete donation services. Given the disruptive potential of gamete donation, how do they manage relationships between parties? Through a content analysis of materials from twenty fertility clinics, twenty egg donation agencies, and thirty-one sperm banks, I address three major strategies of organizational boundary work: 1) creating identity categories, 2) managing information, and 3) managing interaction. I ultimately argue that even as many organizations offer opportunities for connections between parties, they exercise social control over donation arrangements through bounded relationships.

Using institutional theory, this study demonstrates how participants frame a health care decision, such as egg donation, utilizing familial ideals. Results revealed that women expressed the importance of ownership over their genetic material and that familial ideals encourage an ideal way to create a family, which egg donation only fits as a last resort. Results show that familial ideals reach past the institution of family into broader decision making, such as that of health care. Further, results show that as more families are constructed through assisted reproductive technologies, attempts should be made to gradually alter the familial ideal to encompass novel medical technologies such as egg donation.\n\nPayment for egg donation and surrogacy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSteinbock, Bonnie\n\n2004-09-01\n\nThis article examines the ethics of egg donation. It begins by looking at objections to noncommercial gamete donation, and then takes up criticism of commercial egg donation. After discussing arguments based on concern for offspring, inequality, commodification, exploitation of donors, and threats to the family, I conclude that some payment to donors is ethically acceptable. Donors should not be paid for their eggs, but rather they should be compensated for the burdens of egg retrieval. Making the distinction between compensation for burdens and payment for a product has the advantages of limiting payment, not distinguishing between donors on the basis of their traits, and ensuring that donors are paid regardless of the number or quality of eggs retrieved.\n\nBecoming a mother by non-anonymous egg donation: secrecy and the relationship between egg recipient, egg donor and egg donation child.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Berkel, D; Candido, A; Pijffers, W H\n\n2007-06-01\n\nThe object of the study was to investigate secrecy in non-anonymous egg donation, to explore some characteristics of this kind of egg donation arrangement and the relationship of the recipient with her non-genetic child. Forty-four egg recipients and 62 IVF patients with a child conceived through egg donation and/or IVF were recruited. A semi-structured questionnaire was sent to all the participants. Chi-square and T-tests were used to examine the differences between the groups. There were no significant differences on the following aspects. The same high proportion of egg donation mothers (77%) and IVF mothers (87%) had the intention of telling their child about the conception but most women thought disclosure at a later time preferable. Two thirds of the recipients and IVF mothers said the way of conception had no influence on the relationship with their child. The two groups differed however in their argumentation about secrecy and named different feelings. Egg donation mothers expressed more denial and showed more defensive reactions, anxieties and uncertainty. It is suggested that recognition of a certain difference between a natural conception and egg donation could be helpful in early disclosure and could help to diminish anxieties in egg donation mothers.\n\nGood eggs? Evaluating consent forms for egg donation.\n\nPubMed\n\nCattapan, Alana Rose\n\n2016-07-01\n\nBeyond gaps in the provision of information, the informed consent process for egg donation is complicated by conflicts of interest, payment and a lack of longitudinal data about physiological and psychological risks. Recent scholarship has suggested that egg donation programmes could improve the informed consent process by revising consent documents. At a minimum, these documents should include information about eight key criteria: the nature and objectives of treatment; the benefits, risks and inconveniences of egg donation; the privacy of donors and their anonymity (where applicable); disclosure that participation is voluntary (withdrawal); the availability of counselling; financial considerations; the possibility of an unsuccessful cycle and potential uses of the eggs retrieved. This study evaluates the incorporation of these minimum criteria in consent forms for egg donation, obtained through requests to Canadian fertility clinics. Even when clinics were considered to have met criteria simply by mentioning them, among the eight consent forms assessed, none met the minimum standards. Only half of clinics addressed privacy/anonymity concerns, financial issues and the possibility of a future cycle. Improving the quality of consent documentation to meet the minimum standards established by this study may not be an onerous task. For some, this will include re-evaluating how they include one or two elements of disclosure, and for others, this will require a substantial overhaul. Using the criteria provided by this study as the minimum standard for consent could ensure that donors have the basic information they need to make informed decisions.

The article addresses whether mt donors would be a child's genetic parents following clinical use in that child's conception should mt donation be legalised for such use in Australia. It then considers how genetic and gestational relatedness are relevant in the discourse around legal parentage following egg donation and surrogacy and argues that the current approach is in need of reform so that intending parents of all children are deemed to be the resulting child's legal parents at birth.\n\nSecrecy, disclosure and everything in-between: decisions of parents of children conceived by donor insemination, egg donation and surrogacy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nReadings, Jennifer; Blake, Lucy; Casey, Polly; Jadva, Vasanti; Golombok, Susan\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis study examined families where children lack a genetic and/or gestational link with their parents. A total of 101 families (36 donor insemination families, 32 egg donation families and 33 surrogacy families) were interviewed when the child was aged 7 years. Despite a shift in professional attitudes towards openness, about half of the children conceived by egg donation and nearly three-quarters of those conceived by donor insemination remained unaware that the person they know as their mother or father is not, in fact, their genetic parent. By contrast, almost all the surrogacy parents had told their child how they were born. A majority of parents who planned never to tell their child about their conception had told at least one other person. However, qualitative data indicated that to categorize families as âsecretâ or âopenâ is inadequate. In fact many parents engage in âlayersâ of disclosure about their childâs conception, both with their child and with family and friends.

We found that these websites use marketing techniques that obscure the realities of egg donation, presenting egg donation as a mutually beneficial and fulfilling experience. Sites emphasize egg donors' emotional fulfillment (71.4%) and address recipients' anxieties by stressing the ability to find the perfect \"fit\" or \"match\" (56.5%), suiting recipients'\"preferences\"/\"desires\" (19.6%), and even designing/customizing a child (15.2%). Agencies attempt to create a sense of connection between the recipients and donors by reporting donors' personal characteristics - e.g., interests/hobbies (63%), traits (34.8%), mood/temperament (20%), and self-reported childhood behavior/memories (15%). Sites present donors as caring/generous (54.3%) and smart/successful/beautiful. These data, the first to examine several key aspects of egg donation agency websites, reveal critical aspects of how these companies communicate to prospective donors and recipients, raising several ethical concerns. Websites frame information in ways that may bias consumers, making emotional appeals that may distract from appropriate risk/benefit assessments and obscure the ethical challenges of egg donation. These data highlight needs for improved practices, adherence to guidelines, and consideration of enhanced guidelines or policy.

Nevertheless, reproductive disappointments resulting from gender inequalities cause many Spanish women to postpone motherhood and experience age-related fertility problems. For them, creating a family often becomes possible only through the reproductive labor of other women. Our analysis of transnational adoption, egg donation, and surrogacy in Spain shows how anonymity and altruism play out in these three strategies, with implications for the valuation of women's reproductive work and relationships among reproductive providers, intermediaries, recipients, and the resulting children.\n\nA longitudinal study of families formed through reproductive donation: Parent-adolescent relationships and adolescent adjustment at age 14.\n\nPubMed\n\nGolombok, Susan; Ilioi, Elena; Blake, Lucy; Roman, Gabriela; Jadva, Vasanti\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe aim of the 6th phase of this longitudinal study was to establish whether children born through assisted reproduction involving reproductive donation were at risk for psychological problems following the transition to adolescence at age 14 and, if so, to examine the nature of these problems and the mechanisms involved. Eighty-seven families formed through reproductive donation, including 32 donor insemination families, 27 egg donation families, and 28 surrogacy families, were compared with 54 natural conception families. Standardized interviews, questionnaires, and observational assessments of the quality of parent-adolescent relationships and adolescent adjustment were administered to mothers, adolescents, and teachers. The mothers in surrogacy families showed less negative parenting and reported greater acceptance of their adolescent children and fewer problems in family relationships as a whole compared with gamete donation mothers. In addition, less positive relationships were found between mothers and adolescents in egg donation families than in donor insemination families as rated by both mothers and adolescents. There were no differences between family types for the adolescents themselves in terms of adjustment problems, psychological well-being, and self-esteem. Longitudinal analyses showed no differences between family types in negative parenting from age 7 to age 14, and a weaker association between negative parenting and adjustment difficulties for gamete donation than natural conception and surrogacy families. The findings suggest that the absence of a genetic link between mothers and their children is associated with less positive mother-adolescent relationships whereas the absence of a gestational link does not have an adverse effect.

PMID:28758779\n\nIntra-Family Gamete Donation: A Solution to Concerns Regarding Gamete Donation in China?\n\nPubMed\n\nLiao, Juhong; Devolder, Katrien\n\n2016-09-01\n\nGamete donation from third parties is controversial in China as it severs blood ties, which are considered of utmost importance in Confucian tradition. In recent years, infertile couples are increasingly demonstrating a preference for the use of gametes donated by family members to conceive children-known as \"intra-family gamete donation.\" The main advantage of intra-family gamete donation is that it maintains blood ties between children and both parents. To date there is no practice of intra-family gamete donation in China. In this paper, we investigate intra-family adoption in China in order to illustrate that intra-family gamete donation is consistent with Confucian tradition regarding the importance of maintaining blood ties within the family. There are several specific ethical issues raised by intra-family gamete donation. It may, for example, result in consanguinity and the semblance of incest, lead to confused family relationships, and raise concerns about possible coercion of familial donors. Confucian tradition provides a new approach to understand and deal with these ethical issues in a way that Western tradition does not. As a result, we suggest intra-family gamete donation could be an acceptable solution to the problem of infertility in China. However, further discussion and open debates on the ethical issues raised by intra-family gamete donation are needed in China.\n\nThe perspectives of adolescents conceived using surrogacy, egg or sperm donation.\n\nPubMed\n\nZadeh, S; Ilioi, E C; Jadva, V; Golombok, S\n\n2018-04-12\n\nWhat are the perspectives of adolescents conceived using surrogacy, egg or sperm donation regarding their conception and the third party involved? The majority of adolescents described feeling indifferent about their conception, and yet simultaneously reported an interest in the third party involved, or were in contact with them. There is an assumption that children conceived through reproductive donation will feel negatively about their origins in adolescence. However, little is known about the views of adolescents who have been conceived through different types of reproductive donation. Forty-four adolescents, all of whom had been told about their conception in childhood, participated in a semi-structured interview as part of the sixth phase of a longitudinal, multi-method, multi-informant study of assisted reproduction families in the UK. All adolescents were aged 14 years, had been conceived using surrogacy (n = 22), egg donation (n = 13) or sperm donation (n = 9) to heterosexual couples, and varied in terms of their information about, and contact with, the third party involved in their conception. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in participants' homes. Interviews were analysed qualitatively to determine adolescents' perceptions of their conception, and their thoughts and feelings about the surrogate or donor involved. Adolescents were found to feel positive (n = 7), indifferent (n = 32) or ambivalent (n = 5) about their conception. Amongst adolescents not in contact with the surrogate or donor, most were interested (n = 16) in the surrogate or donor, and others were ambivalent (n = 4), or not interested (n = 6) in them. Adolescents in contact with the surrogate or donor expressed positive (n = 14), ambivalent (n = 1) or negative (n = 1) feelings about them. Of 56 adolescents invited to take part in the study, 47 consented to take part, giving a response rate of 84%. It was not possible to obtain information from adolescents who do not know about\n\nImpact of egg donation deliveries from domestic and overseas sources on maternal care: a questionnaire survey of Japanese perinatal physicians.\n\nPubMed\n\nHibino, Yuri; Shimazono, Yosuke\n\n2014-07-01\n\nRecent demographic changes, such as marriage at later ages and delayed childbearing, have contributed to the increased demand for ovum donation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the frequency and impact of egg donation deliveries on maternal care using a questionnaire survey of Japanese perinatal care providers. A quantitative survey was conducted from October to November 2012 using self-administered anonymous questionnaires. We asked 2,693 obstetrics clinics/hospitals throughout Japan to complete the survey: 679 questionnaires were returned (response rate, 25.2 %). Of the respondents, 15.8 % answered that they had handled egg donation deliveries in the past. With regards to the country in which patients received egg donation services, the most frequent was the United States, including Hawaii. Asian countries, such as Thailand, Korea, and Singapore, were also reported; only two cases in Japan were reported. \"Advanced age/menopause\" was the most frequent reason for egg donation, and the mean age at egg donation delivery, because of advanced age/menopause, was 48.3 years. Our findings will increase public awareness of the legal issues related to assisted reproductive technology and cross-border reproductive care, as well as care of the mother and child in pregnancies resulting from reproductive technologies such as egg donation overseas. People should be aware of the issues involved in egg donation abroad and the resulting deliveries, and should implement specific care for women bearing children at later ages.\n\nEgg Production and Donation: A New Frontier in the Global Landscape of Cross-Border Reproductive Care: Ethical Concerns.\n\nPubMed\n\nNeri, Margherita; Turillazzi, Emanuela; Pascale, Natasha; Riezzo, Irene; Pomara, Cristoforo\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCross-border reproductive care (CBRC) is a multifaceted phenomenon. It may involve both the movement of patients to undertake assisted reproductive treatment through technologies otherwise denied and the movement of assisted reproduction professionals, egg and sperm donors and surrogates, as well as the importing and exporting of gametes. The reasons for CBRC vary between countries. In this global landscape, the search for donor oocytes is one of the main reasons for patients seeking cross-border reproductive care. The egg market has led to ethical and political concerns about the means of procuring donor oocytes, the possibility of exploiting economically underprivileged women mainly in poor countries, and the issue of the responsibility and accountability of medical doctors and fertility clinics. Ethical concerns relating to international egg donation are discussed with special focus on the issues of compensation/ reimbursement, the health and welfare of women donating eggs, informed consent to donation, the possible conflict of interest for physicians involved in egg donation programmes, and equity in the distribution of economic resources from CBRC. Finally, the need for global solutions to this global issue is underlined.\n\n[Life lessons of eight families donating organs of deceased family members].\n\nPubMed\n\nAvilÃ©s R, Lissette; Rivera M, M Soledad; Catoni S, MarÃ­a Isabel\n\n2014-06-01\n\nMost organ donors are already death. Therefore family members become an essential link in the final decision for organ donation. To get acquainted about the life lessons of people who accepted donating an organ of a deceased family member. Qualitative research, in depth interviews to eight families that accepted donating an organ of a deceased family member. The interviews were analyzed using the method proposed by Streubert et al and modified by Rivera. The life lessons are described in six comprehensive categories. The painful experience changed towards the feeling that the loved one remains alive. This sensation generated a sense of pride in family members and sensitized them towards the painful experience of other people. Therefore, a desire to help and improve as humans beings was awakened. A compassionate approach towards families donating organs with improve organ donation and humanize the process.\n\nReasons for family refusal of ocular tissue donation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHermann, K C; Pagnussato, F; Franke, C A; de Oliveira, M L B\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCorneal donations do not fill the transplant demand. The waiting list had 5512 individuals in Brazil and 143 in Rio Grande do Sul in December 2012. The aim of this study was to identify the reasons for family refusal of ocular tissues donation. This retrospective study analyzed interview records for ocular tissue procurement performed in a general, public university hospital located in Southern Brazil between January 2008 and December 2012. It identified the reasons of family refusal for ocular tissue donation. A total of 1010 interviews for ocular tissues procurement were performed. From these, 513 (50.79%) refused donation with the following reasons: 60 (11.69%) family members were unaware of the desire of the potential donor, 153 (29.82%) of potential donors spoke against donation in life, 113 (22.02%) family members were undecided about the donation, 156 (30.40%) family members were against donation, 3 (0.58%) family members were unhappy with the service, 11 (2.14%) family members were afraid of body release delay, 6 (1.16%) families expressed religious convictions against donation, and 11 (2.14%) family members wanted to keep the body intact. There are many reasons for ocular tissues donation refusal, and the knowledge provides better strategies for family interviews. In this study, most of the reasons, around 90%, can be related to lack of information or communication about the subject. Greater awareness of the population about the subject can be a good way to increase ocular tissue procurement indexes. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nFamily Over Rules? An Ethical Analysis of Allowing Families to Overrule Donation Intentions.\n\nPubMed\n\nShaw, David; Georgieva, Denie; Haase, Bernadette; Gardiner, Dale; Lewis, Penney; Jansen, Nichon; Wind, Tineke; Samuel, Undine; McDonald, Maryon; Ploeg, Rutger\n\n2017-03-01\n\nMillions of people want to donate their organs after they die for transplantation, and many of them have registered their wish to do so or told their family and friends about their decision. For most of them, however, this wish is unlikely to be fulfilled, as only a small number of deaths (1% in the United Kingdom) occur in circumstances where the opportunity to donate organs is possible. Even for those who do die in the \"right\" way and have recorded their wishes or live in a jurisdiction with a \"presumed consent\" system, donation often does not go ahead because of another issue: their families refuse to allow donation to proceed. In some jurisdictions, the rate of \"family overrule\" is over 10%. In this article, we provide a systematic ethical analysis of the family overrule of donation of solid organs by deceased patients, and examine arguments both in favor of and against allowing relatives to \"veto\" the potential donor's intentions. First, we provide a brief review of the different consent systems in various European countries, and the ramifications for family overrule. Next, we describe and discuss the arguments in favor of permitting donation intentions to be overruled, and then the arguments against doing so. The \"pro\" arguments are: overrule minimises family distress and staff stress; families need to cooperate for donation to take place; families might have evidence regarding refusal; and failure to permit overrules could weaken trust in the donation system. The \"con\" arguments are: overrule violates the patient's wishes; the family is too distressed and will regret the decision; overruling harms other patients; and regulations prohibit overrule. We conclude with a general discussion and recommendations for dealing with families who wish to overrule donation. Overall, overrule should only rarely be permitted.\n\nEgg freezing and egg banking: empowerment and alienation in assistedÂ reproduction.\n\nPubMed\n\nRobertson, John A\n\n2014-06-01\n\nWith the development of rapid freezing of human oocytes, many programs have reported IVF success rates comparable to those achieved with fresh eggs and thawed frozen embryos. Egg freezing is now gaining professional and regulatory acceptance as a safe and effective technique for women who wish to avoid discarding excess embryos, who face fertility-threatening medical treatments, or who want to preserve their eggs for use when they are better situated to have a family. This article focuses on the uses of and justification for egg freezing, the path to professional acceptance, the variability in success rates, and the controversy over freezing eggs for social rather than medical reasons. It also addresses the emergence of egg banking as a separate sector in the infertility industry, the regulatory issues that it poses, and its effect on egg donation. Key here is the legal control of stored eggs by banking women and their options when they wish to dispose of those eggs. The analysis is framed around empowerment and alienation. Egg freezing is generally empowering for women, but the donation or sale of unused eggs to infertile women, egg bankers, and researchers also raises issues of alienation.\n\nEgg freezing and egg banking: empowerment and alienation in assistedÂ reproduction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRobertson, John A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWith the development of rapid freezing of human oocytes, many programs have reported IVF success rates comparable to those achieved with fresh eggs and thawed frozen embryos.

PMID:27774158\n\nReverse traffic: intersecting inequalities in human egg donation.\n\nPubMed\n\nNahman, Michal\n\n2011-11-01\n\nThe paper examines a case of cross-border reproductive care that happens in reverse by looking at Israeli--Romanian transnational ova traffic. The state of Israel claims to have the most IVF clinics per capita in the world, some of the highest success rates in the use of assisted reproductive technology, very liberal regulation of these technologies and the most heavily subsidized IVF in the world. This support and the government's demographic policies are designed to encourage the growth of the Jewish population in its demographic race against Palestinians. Yet transnational egg donation is very costly and reimbursement to patients a slow and involved process. Hence, while transnational ova donation is increasing in Israel, only a few can afford to participate in this border crossing. Further, new laws are meant to forbid cross-religious donation in Israel, hardening the borders of the Jewish State. Romanian ova donors are part of the global majority, exploited by markets' incursions into new niches in bodies. The history of Romanian oppression of women's reproduction makes today's women willing to undergo invasive treatment for very little compensation, even when there is the possibility of injury. This paper documents reverse traffic reproduction, which maintains, rather than addresses, inequalities. Copyright Â© 2011 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

An international training institute with programs based on proven results was engaged to create and implement a customized training program to influence change in FDC practice and culture. The goal was to increase donation rates by developing and implementing a customized, self-sustaining training program to enhance FDC practices of health professionals. Other goals included providing training and communications skills to lead FDC, supporting families in making decisions, and influencing health professionals to adopt FDC practices. To gain support and determine program suitability, two 1-day pilot training sessions were provided to 45 Australian donation leaders in 2011. Training was further customized with an emphasis on creating changes to achieve and sustain desired results. A comprehensive national training plan was implemented over 18 months. Twenty-six 2-day FDC training workshops were held in 8 cities (646 participants). Program evaluations and debriefings showed distinct shifts in perspectives and an enthusiasm to implement new processes. In 2012 to 2013, an instructor program was developed to transition training facilitation. The training institute remains involved in development and training to build and sustain skill and expertise. There was a 58% increase in organ donors in Australia from 2009 to 2013 (data reflect 2013 Australian end-of-year organ donation information). This represents a 36% increase in organ donors (2009-2011); the remaining 22% increase was achieved in the 2 years since the FDC training was implemented in Australia (2011-2013). Improved skills training in the conduct of FDCs seem to have contributed to improved donation outcomes in national identification, request, and consent rates.

To examine the association of attitudes and knowledge about organ donation and transplantation with willingness to donate and willingness to engage in family discussion about organ donation among Asian American adolescents. A cross-sectional study. The Big Island of Hawaii. Self-identified Asian American adolescents (Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Korean), ages 16 to 17 years old, and each adolescent's parent or guardian. Asian American adolescents provided demographic information and completed the Modified Organ Donation Attitude Survey, the Organ Donation and Transplantation Knowledge Survey, and the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale. A parent or guardian also provided demographic information. Linear regression analyses were used to examine the associations with willingness to donate and to engage in family discussion about organ discussion. Willingness to donate was associated with positive knowledge related to general aspects about organ donation and cultural limitations in receiving an organ transplant, a high level of acculturation, and a low level of negative attitudes (R2 = 0.402, F = 18.86, P = .005). Asian American adolescents with approving or positive attitudes were likely to engage in family discussion about organ donation (R2 = 0.195, F = 27.93, P = .005). To reinforce and maintain high levels of knowledge and positive attitudes, organ donation education is most likely needed in high schools.\n\nOutcomes of organ donation in brain-dead patient's families: Ethical perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmadian, Shamsi; Rahimi, Abolfazl; Khaleghi, Ebrahim\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe families of brain-dead patients have a significant role in the process of decision making for organ donation. Organ donation is a traumatic experience. The ethical responsibility of healthcare systems respecting organ donation is far beyond the phase of decision making for donation. The principles of donation-related ethics require healthcare providers and organ procurement organizations to respect donor families and protect them against any probable harm. Given the difficult and traumatic nature of donation-related experience, understanding the outcomes of donation appears crucial. The aim of this study was to explore the outcomes of organ donation for the families of brain-dead patients. This was a qualitative descriptive study to which a purposeful sample of 19 donor family members were recruited. Data were collected through holding in-depth semi-structured interviews with the participants. Data analysis was performed by following the qualitative content analysis approach developed by Elo and KyngÃ¤s. The main category of the data was \"Decision to organ donation: a challenge from conflict to transcendence.\" This main category consisted of 10 subcategories and 3 general categories. The general categories were \"challenging outcomes,\" \"reassuring outcomes,\" and \"transcending outcomes.\" Ethical considerations: The study was approved by the regional ethical review board. The ethical principles of informed consent, confidentiality, and non-identification were used. Donor families experience different challenges which range from conflict and doubtfulness to confidence, satisfaction, and transcendence. Healthcare providers and organ procurers should not discontinue care and support provision to donor families after obtaining their consent to donate because the post-decision phase is also associated with different complexities and difficulties with which donor families may not be able to cope effectively. In order to help donor families achieve positive outcomes from\n\nReproductive agency and projects: Germans searching for egg donation in Spain and the Czech Republic.\n\nPubMed\n\nBergmann, Sven\n\n2011-11-01\n\nGerman patients in search of IVF with egg donation (which is prohibited by German law) are increasingly deciding to travel to clinics in other countries (mostly to the Czech Republic and Spain) that are able to provide them with the eggs of other women. Through three case studies of German couples who crossed international borders for IVF with egg donation, this article provides insight into these transnational practices aiming to circumvent restrictions in reproduction, whatever they may be. The material for this article is based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews conducted in Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic, as well as research undertaken on IVF internet bulletin boards. The concepts of 'reproductive agency' and 'reproductive projects' are used to analyse the ways in which people search for information about treatments and clinics in other countries, how they embed the practice into their daily lives and how they deal with and position themselves regarding the need for reproductive travel.

This paper aims at exploring the average Malaysian households ' preferred channels of campaigns and the preferred campaigners in a family setting, targeting at the dialysis family members. We analyzed the responses of 350 respondents regarding organ donation campaigns. The respondents are 2 family members of 175 dialysis patients from 3 different institutions. The information on respondents' willingness to donate and preferred method and channel of organ donation campaign were collected through questionnaire. Malaysian families have a good tendency to welcome campaigns in both the public and private (their homes) spheres. We also found that campaigns facilitated by the electronic media (Television and Radio) and executed by experienced doctors are expected to optimize the outcomes of organ donation, in general. Chi-square tests show that there are no significant differences in welcoming campaigns among ethnics. However, ethnics preferences over the campaign methods and campaigners are significantly different (P <0.05). Ethnic differences imply that necessary modifications on the campaign channels and campaigners should also be taken under consideration.

The 3 best-demonstrated request practices, private setting, \"decoupling,\" and collaboration in the request between the organ procurement organization and hospital staff, were incorporated into the program. Improvement in the consent and donation rate was evident in the second calendar year of the program; the consent rate was 72% and the donation rate was 50%. During the second year, there was also a positive correlation between \"decoupling,\" appropriate requestor, and the consent rate. Implementation of a hospital-based team and a standard protocol facilitated the clarification of roles and responsibilities toward clearer and more consistent family communication and support. Data suggest that staff experience is a major contributor to a positive donation outcome.\n\nOrgan Donation Campaigns: Perspective of Dialysis Patient's Family Members\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTUMIN, Makmor; RAJA ARIFFIN, Raja Noriza; MOHD SATAR, NurulHuda; NG, Kok-Peng; LIM, Soo-Kun; CHONG, Chin-Sieng\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAbstract Background Solving the dilemma of the organ shortage in Malaysia requires educating Malaysians about organ donation and transplantation.

Retrospective study of our local organ procurement organization (OPO) database of potential organ donors. Modifiable variables involved in the family approach of potential organ donors were collected and included race and sex of OPO representative, individual initiating approach discussion with family (RN or MD vs. OPO), length of donation discussion, use of a translator, and time of day of approach. Of 1137 potential organ donors, 661 (58%) consented and 476 (42%) declined. Consent rates were higher with matched race of donor and OPO representative (66% vs. 52%, p < 0.001), family approach by female OPO representative (67% vs. 56%, p = 0.002), if approach was initiated by OPO representative (69% vs. 49%, p < 0.001), and if consent rate was dependent on time of day the approach occurred: 6:00 am to noon (56%), noon to 6:00 pm (67%), 6:00 pm to midnight (68%), and midnight to 6:00 am (45%), p = 0.04. Family approach that led to consent lasted longer than those declining (67 vs. 43 minutes, p < 0.001). Independent predictors of consent to donation included female OPO representative (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; p = 0.006), approach discussion initiated by OPO representative (OR, 1.9; p = 0.001), and longer approach discussions (OR, 1.02; p < 0.001). The independent predictor of declined donation was the use of a translator (OR, 0.39; p = 0.01). Variables such as race and sex of OPO representative and time of day should be considered before approaching a family for organ donation. Avoiding translators during the approach process may improve donation rates. Education for health care providers should reinforce the importance of allowing OPO representatives to initiate the family approach for organ donation. Epidemiologic study, level IV.

This study examined the impact of surrogacy on mother-child relationships and children's psychological adjustment. Assessments of maternal positivity, maternal negativity, mother-child interaction, and child adjustment were administered to 32 surrogacy, 32 egg donation, and 54 natural conception families with a 7-year-old child. No differences were found for maternal negativity, maternal positivity, or child adjustment, although the surrogacy and egg donation families showed less positive mother-child interaction than the natural conception families. The findings suggest that both surrogacy and egg donation families function well in the early school years.\n\nSatisfaction with the organ donation process of brain dead donors' families in Korea.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, H S; Yoo, Y S; Cho, O H\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the satisfaction of the families of brain dead donors with regard to donation processes as well as their emotions after the donation. A cross-sectional survey study was performed that included 45 families of brain-dead donors in 1 hospital-based organ procurement organization (HOPO) in Korea between February 2007 and AprilÂ 2011. Donor willingness and desire in life was the most frequent reason organs were donated (34.5%), followed by the advice of family members or friends (31.0%). Satisfaction with the organ donation processes was 4.04 of 6 points. In each category, the satisfaction with the decision of donation was the highest (4.96 points) and the satisfaction with the procedure of donation was the lowest (3.07 points); of each question, the satisfaction of \"information and help on funeral arrangements was enough\" and \"the process of preparing the relevant documents was cumbersome\" was the lowest. \"Missing\" the dead person and \"pride\" were the most common emotions experienced after organ donation (69.0% and 62.1%, respectively), followed by \"grief,\" \"family coherence,\" and \"guilt.\" Religious practices were observed to be most helpful for psychological stress relief after donation, followed by spending time with family and friends. Moreover, 24.1% responded that they had not yet overcome their suffering. Because donors' own willingness is the most common reason that families choose donation, it is necessary to remind the public of the importance of organ donation through education and public relations using mass communication approaches. Additionally, because the families felt grief and guilt as well as missing their loved ones and pride regarding their dead loved ones after organ donation, continuous and systematic supports are needed to promote their psychological stability.

PMID:21895360\n\nOocyte cryopreservation for donor egg banking.\n\nPubMed\n\nCobo, Ana; RemohÃ­, JosÃ©; Chang, Ching-Chien; Nagy, Zsolt Peter\n\n2011-09-01\n\nOocyte donation is an efficient alternative to using own oocytes in IVF treatment for different indications. Unfortunately, 'traditional' (fresh) egg donations are challenged with inefficiency, difficulties of synchronization, very long waiting periods and lack of quarantine measures. Given the recent improvements in the efficiency of oocyte cryopreservation, it is reasonable to examine if egg donation through oocyte cryopreservation has merits. The objective of the current manuscript is to review existing literature on this topic and to report on the most recent outcomes from two established donor cryobank centres. Reports on egg donation using slow freezing are scarce and though results are encouraging, outcomes are not yet comparable to a fresh egg donation treatment. Vitrification on the other hand appears to provide high survival rates (90%) of donor oocytes and comparable fertilization, embryo development, implantation and pregnancy rates to traditional (fresh) egg donation. Besides the excellent outcomes, the ease of use for both donors and recipients, higher efficiency, lower cost and avoiding the problem of synchronization are all features associated with the benefit of a donor egg cryobank and makes it likely that this approach becomes the future standard of care. Oocyte donation is one of the last resorts in IVF treatment for couples challenged with infertility problems. However, traditional (fresh) egg donation, as it is performed today, is not very efficient, as typically all eggs from one donor are given to only one recipient, it is arduous as it requires an excellent synchronization between the donor and recipient and there are months or years of waiting time. Because of the development of an efficient oocyte cryopreservation technique, it is now possible to cryo-store donor (as well as non-donor) eggs, maintaining their viability and allowing their use whenever there is demand. Therefore, creating a donor oocyte cryobank would carry many advantages\n\nFactors influencing bereaved families' decisions about organ donation: an integrative literature review.\n\nPubMed\n\nWalker, Wendy; Broderick, Andrew; Sque, Magi\n\n2013-11-01\n\nThis article reports on the process and outcomes of a systematic integrative literature review, designed to enhance understanding of the factors influencing bereaved families' decisions to agree or decline the donation of their deceased relative's organs for transplantation. Research originating from eight Western countries (N = 20 studies) provided an international perspective to the review. Thematic analysis and synthesis of textual data culminated in the development of three global themes (past, present, and future) that captured the temporal dimensions of family decision making. The review findings provide valuable insight into ways of increasing the rate of consent to organ donation through the development family-centered care interventions that reflect the needs of the bereaved. Further research to explore the pathway of donation after circulatory death and the experiences of bereaved families who decline organ donation is essential to providing a more complete understanding of the factors affecting donation decisions.\n\nNew York State's landmark policies on oversight and compensation for egg donation to stem cell research.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoxland, Beth E\n\n2012-05-01\n\nIn 2009, New York became the first US state to implement a policy permitting researchers to use public funds to reimburse women who donate oocytes directly and solely to stem cell research, not only for the woman's out-of-pocket expenses, but also for the time, burden and discomfort associated with the donation process. The debate about the propriety of such compensation was recently renewed with the publication of a stem cell study in which women were provided with compensation for donating their eggs. This article explores the scientific and ethical rationales that led to New York's decision to allow donor compensation. The multifaceted deliberation process and comprehensive policies may serve as a model for other states and countries considering the issue of oocyte donor compensation.\n\nBereaved donor families' experiences of organ and tissue donation, and perceived influences on their decision making.\n\nPubMed\n\nSque, Magi; Walker, Wendy; Long-Sutehall, Tracy; Morgan, Myfanwy; Randhawa, Gurch; Rodney, Amanda\n\n2018-06-01\n\nTo elicit bereaved families' experiences of organ and tissue donation. A specific objective was to determine families' perceptions of how their experiences influenced donation decision-making. Retrospective, qualitative interviews were undertaken with 43 participants of 31 donor families to generate rich, informative data. Participant recruitment was via 10 National Health Service Trusts, representative of five regional organ donation services in the UK. Twelve families agreed to DBD, 18 agreed to DCD, 1 unknown. Participants' responses were contextualised using a temporal framework of 'The Past', which represented families' prior knowledge, experience, attitudes, beliefs, and intentions toward organ donation; 'The Present', which incorporated the moment in time when families experienced the potential for donation; and 'The Future', which corresponded to expectations and outcomes arising from the donation decision. Temporally interwoven experiences appeared to influence families' decisions to donate the organs of their deceased relative for transplantation. The influence of temporality on donation-decision making is worthy of consideration in the planning of future education, policy, practice, and research for improved rates of family consent to donation.

This study aims to analyze the family interview process with a focus on principlist bioethics. This exploratory, descriptive study uses a qualitative approach. The speeches were collected using the following prompt: \"Talk about the family interview for the donation of organs and tissues for transplantation, from the preparation for the interview to the decision of the family to donate or not.\" For the treatment of qualitative data, we chose the method of content analysis and categorical thematic analysis. The study involved 18 nurses who worked in three municipal organ procurement organizations in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and who conducted family interviews for organ donation. Ethical considerations: The data were collected after approval of the study by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Nursing of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. The results were classified into four categories and three subcategories. The categories are the principles adopted by principlist bioethics. The principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice permeate the family interview and reveal their importance in the organs and tissues donation process for transplantation. The analysis of family interviews for the donation of organs and tissues for transplantation with a focus on principlist bioethics indicates that the process involves many ethical considerations. The elucidation of these aspects contributes to the discussion, training, and improvement of professionals, whether nurses or not, who work in organ procurement organizations and can improve the curriculum of existing training programs for transplant coordinators who pursue ethics in donation and transplantation as their foundation.\n\nFamily veto in organ donation in Canada: framing within English-language newspaper articles.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnthony, Samantha J; Toews, Maeghan; Caulfield, Timothy; Wright, Linda\n\n2017-10-17\n\nBecause organ transplantation relies on public support for donation, an analysis of public discourse around organ donation is essential. We investigated the portrayal of family veto - when a family overrides the deceased person's prior legally executed wishes to donate - in Canadian news media. Using the Canadian Newsstream database, we identified articles published in English-language newspapers addressing family veto between 2000 and 2016. Guided by the theoretical perspectives of framing of media effects, we conducted a systematic content analysis of the articles to examine how the Canadian media framed family veto. An initial in-depth analysis of the data set in which themes and patterns were captured and recorded identified coding categories, including primary framing of family veto, prevalence, reasons, ethical or legal concerns and overall tone of the article. Two coders analyzed the data set to ensure intercoder reliability. A total of 133 relevant articles were identified. Family veto was framed predominantly as something that should not be allowed (81 articles [60.9%]) and as a reality that is little understood outside the transplantation community (45 [33.8%]). One-quarter of the articles (32 [24.1%]) highlighted ethical principles of autonomy and justice associated with family veto. Family veto was represented as a stumbling block in the present organ donation system, with most publications (107 [80.4%]) calling for change. There were differing interpretations of organ donation legislation, with 82 articles (61.6%) erroneously stating or suggesting that existing legislation permits family veto. Family veto in organ donation was portrayed predominantly negatively. Many publications reflected a misunderstanding of the law concerning this issue. Although the framing of family veto highlighted important ethical and legal concerns as well as practice and policy considerations, research is needed to enhance the understanding of family veto in organ donation\n\nOvum donation: examining the new Israeli law.\n\nPubMed\n\nGruenbaum, Benjamin F; Pinchover, Zachary S; Lunenfeld, Eitan; Jotkowitz, Alan\n\n2011-11-01\n\nOvum donation affords countless couples that under natural circumstances would not be able to produce offspring the ability to carry out natural pregnancies. With advancements in biotechnology including egg collection and in vitro fertilization (IVF), physicians can now successfully implant fertilized embryos. Due to Israel's tremendous involvement in IVF for its own citizens, the national laws that govern egg donation are of great importance. On September 5th 2010, the Israeli Parliament (Knesset) passed a law that allows young women between the ages of 21 and 35 to donate their eggs for paid financial compensation. The new law allows infertile women between the ages of 18 and 54 to request egg donation and IVF, which will partially be covered under state insurance plans. This article provides a description of the new Israeli law regulating ovum donation and the practical, moral and ethical debate surrounding the new system. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Therefore, family discussion is an important communication process to study in the effort to get more people to become organ donors. This investigation concerns the willingness to communicate about organ donation and its relationship to other variables and processes related to family discussion of organ donation. Previous research on willingness to communicate examined the antecedent variables of knowledge, attitude toward organ donation, and altruism. This research found that being willing to communicate about organ donation with one's family is related to prior thought and intent to sign an organ donor card, to perceiving organ donation messages as credible, and to feeling relatively low anxiety after reading organ donation messages. One week after being presented with the messages, willingness to communicate was found to be positively associated with worrying about the lack of donors, engaging in family discussion about organ donation, and having an organ donor card witnessed. It was negatively related to feeling personally uneasy about organ donation during the past week.\n\nChildren Born Through Reproductive Donation: A Longitudinal Study of Psychological Adjustment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGolombok, Susan; Blake, Lucy; Casey, Polly; Roman, Gabriela; Jadva, Vasanti\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Parenting and childrenâs adjustment were examined in 30 surrogacy families, 31 egg donation families, 35 donor insemination families, and 53 natural conception families. Methods Parenting was assessed at age 3 by a standardized interview designed to assess quality of parenting and by questionnaire measures of anxiety, depression and marital quality. Childrenâs adjustment was assessed at ages 3, 7 and 10 using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results Although children born through reproductive donation obtained SDQ scores within the normal range, surrogacy children showed higher levels of adjustment difficulties at age 7 than children conceived by gamete donation. Mothers who had kept their childâs origins secret showed elevated levels of distress. However, maternal distress had a more negative impact on children who were aware of their origins. Conclusions The absence of a gestational connection to the mother may be more problematic for children than the absence of a genetic link.

Forty-nine family members of potential donors from four Melbourne hospitals were interviewed to assess their experiences of communication, processes and the outcomes of donation. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Families expressed a range of perspectives on themes of communication, hospital processes and care, the processes of consent and donation and reflected on decisions and outcomes. They expressed satisfaction overall with communication when receiving bad news, discussing death and donation. Honest and frank communication and being kept up-to-date and prepared for potential outcomes were important aspects for families, especially those of post circulatory death donors. Participants reported high levels of trust in healthcare professionals and satisfaction with the level of care received. Many donor families indicated the process was lengthy and stressful, but not significantly enough to adversely affect their satisfaction with the outcome. Both the decision itself and knowing others' lives had been saved provided them with consolation. No consenting families, and only some non-consenting families, regretted their decisions. Many expressed they would benefit from a follow-up opportunity to ask questions and clarify possible misunderstandings. Overall, while experiences varied, Australian families valued frank communication, trusted health professionals, were satisfied with the care their family member received and with donation processes, despite some apparent difficulties. Family satisfaction, infrequently assessed, is an important outcome and these findings may assist education for Australian organ donation professionals.\n\n[Can one authorize oocyte donation in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg?].\n\nPubMed\n\nArendt, J\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn the case of early ovary extinction, the only way to have a child is either adoption or egg/embryo reception by donation. To day, egg donation is prohibited in Luxembourg by ministerial decision in 2003. Germ cell donation is part of artificial reproductive therapy. Oocyte donation, in particular, needs to be done by IVF treatment, which makes it more complicated then sperm donation What makes it more difficult is the fact that there are no oocyte bank yet. Today, prohibition encourages procreative tourism what only wealthy people can afford. Although donation programs are well established many questions arise about egg donation such as refunds, divulging information, women's age limit, health insurance participation.\n\nOrgan donation agency: A discourse analysis of correspondence between donor and organ recipient families.\n\nPubMed\n\nGalasiÅski, Dariusz; Sque, Magi\n\n2016-11-01\n\nStudies about the psychosocial issues concerning organ donation and transplantation tend to focus on the experiences of donor or recipient families. Little is known about the part played by correspondence exchanged between these two groups; in particular how they perceive the agency of organ donation. This is the first analysis to address the representation of the act of donation from the viewpoint of both donor and recipient families through interrogation of archived correspondence data, using linguistic techniques. The data was drawn from a collection of letters, from four USA organ procurement organisations, exchanged between donor and transplant recipient families. Donor families consistently linguistically ascribed agency and accountability for donation to the person who died, the donor. For the recipient families, on the other hand, the 'giver' was mainly implied, ambiguous or ascribed to the donor family.

If no card is found on a potential donor, families have to be approached about donation. The aim of this paper is to model the role that some family communication factors play in the family decision to consent or not to organ donation by a brain dead relative. Information was gathered in face-to-face interviews, using a questionnaire and recording open answers and comments. Eight heads of intensive care units (ICU) of Swiss hospitals and one representative from Swisstransplant were interviewed. Questions asked respondents to estimate the prevalence and effect of communication factors in families facing a decision to consent to donation. Answers were averaged for modelling purposes. Modelling also relies on a previous representative population survey for cross-validation. The family of the deceased person is almost always approached about donation. Physicians perceive that prior thinking and favourable predisposition to donation are correlated and that the relativesâ predisposition is the most important factor for the consent to donation, up to the point that a negative predisposition may override an acknowledged wish of the deceased to donate. Donor cards may trigger family communication and ease the physiciansâ approach to family about donation. Campaigns should encourage donate-willing people to talk to their families about it, make people think about organ donation and try to change unfavourable predispositions. Acknowledgement the authors wish to thank the interviewees whose collaboration has provided them an overview of todayâs situation in Switzerland.

Thirty-three videotaped interactions between standardized patients and 17 procurement coordinators involving 2 different scenarios depicting deceased donation were evaluated. Video recordings were rated by independent coders. Coders completed the Impact Message Inventory-Form C, the Participatory Style of Physician Scale, and the Siminoff Communication and Content and Affect Program-Global Observer Ratings scale. African American procurement coordinators, particularly African American women, were rated as more controlling and work-oriented than white procurement coordinators. Male procurement coordinators were more affiliative with the white family than the African American family, whereas female procurement coordinators were slightly less affiliative with the white family. African American procurement coordinators expressed more positive affect when interacting with the African American family than the white family, whereas the opposite was true for white procurement coordinators. Research is needed to cross-validate these exploratory findings and further examine cultural mistrust between procurement coordinators and families of ethnic minorities, especially given the negative attitudes of many\n\nFactors influencing the reimbursement rate of egg donation within a competitive free-market system.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeng, Boon Chin\n\n2007-07-01\n\nThe current situation of oocyte donation in the USA serves as a useful paradigm for a laissez-faire free-market model of egg donor reimbursement, based on supply and demand. There is a rapidly emerging consensus of what would be considered desirable attributes in an egg donor, which would in turn determine her market value in financial reimbursement. First and foremost is the race and ethnicity of the donor. As expected, the shortage of egg donors from some ethnic groups such as East Asians and Jews has resulted in higher reimbursement rates for donors of such ethnicity. Second is the educational attainment of the donor, in particular high scholastic aptitude test scores and degrees from prestigious universities. Third is the employment status and career of the prospective donor. Last, but not least, are the personal esthetics of the egg donor, her physical appearance, from complexion to stature. These can be summarized as the Four Es: ethnicity, education, employment and esthetics, which are somewhat analogous to the Four Cs of diamond price valuation (colour, clarity, carat and cut). Although such an analogy may appear rather superficial, the free-market systems that have evolved in response to a growing demand for these two completely unrelated items are uncannily similar.\n\nSurrogacy families headed by gay men: relationships with surrogates and egg donors, fathers' decisions over disclosure and children's views on their surrogacy origins.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarone, Nicola; Baiocco, Roberto; Manzi, Demetria; Antoniucci, Chiara; Caricato, Victoria; Pagliarulo, Eugenio; Lingiardi, Vittorio\n\n2018-02-01\n\nHow do gay father families experience surrogacy in terms of their relationships with surrogates and egg donors, fathers' disclosure decisions and children's views on their surrogacy origins? More families had a relationship with the surrogate than the egg donor, and almost all had started to disclose to their children, the majority of whom expressed limited interest in their surrogacy conception. Gay fathers tend to report greater contact with the surrogate than the egg donor and to disclose only the use of a surrogate (omitting discussion of the egg donor and the respective fathers' genetic relatedness). Children's views on their surrogacy conception to gay fathers are not known. Thirty-one children and 80 fathers were interviewed as part of a larger in-depth investigation of 40 Italian gay father surrogacy families. Multiple strategies were used to recruit participants. Children were aged 6-12 years and had been born to gay fathers through gestational surrogacy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in participants' homes with each family member, separately. Fathers' interviews were presented from the perspective of the father who identified as being most involved with the child on a day-to-day basis. Qualitative content analysis was performed and quotations illustrating the findings were reported. Where appropriate, comparisons were conducted using Ï2 or Fisher's exact tests. A total of 31 children in 24 families were interviewed. Most families reported a harmonious relationship with the surrogate (n = 20, 57.1%) and a distant relationship with the donor (n = 10, 66.7%) (Ï2(1) = 23.33, P < 0.001). Before the child was aged 4 years, almost all families (n = 34, 85%) had started to disclose their use of a surrogate, with 16 families (n = 16, 40%) also disclosing their use of a donated egg, and only 4 (10%) disclosing which father's sperm had been used. Of the 31 children interviewed, most (n = 17, 54.8%) showed a clear understanding of their conception\n\nFamily perception of the process of organ donation. Qualitative psychosocial analysis of the subjective interpretation of donor and nondonor families.\n\nPubMed\n\nLÃ³pez MartÃ­nez, Jorge S; MartÃ­n LÃ³pez, MarÃ­a JesÃºs; Scandroglio, Barbara; MartÃ­nez GarcÃ­a, JosÃ© Manuel\n\n2008-05-01\n\nFamily perception of organ donation has been explored by numerous authors using statements by the people who decided whether or not to donate the organs of a relative in a situation of brain death. Within this tradition, in this work, we analyze the discourse of six families who granted permission for organ donation and three who refused. We describe the process-based interpretation of this experience and identify psychosocial variables and processes that further our understanding of the decision finally adopted. We have identified two heuristics that guide family decision when organ donation is requested: the explicit or inferred will of the deceased and family attitudes to organ donation and transplant. It is postulated that the interaction of these two factors explains a large amount of the decisions made. We also hypothesize that a marked discrepancy between these two factors increases the importance of other aspects, especially the role of the transplant coordinator and of other healthcare personnel. These results support, at a social level, the implementation of transplant promotion programs; and at a healthcare level, the combined use of techniques of crisis intervention and attitude change.\n\nWhen do next-of-kin opt-in? Anticipated regret, affective attitudes and donating deceased family member's organs.\n\nPubMed\n\nShepherd, Lee; O'Carroll, Ronan E\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThis research assessed whether affective factors promote and prevent family members from donating their loved one's organs. Participants (N = 191) imagined that a family member had died and that they had to decide whether or not to donate their organs and body parts for transplantation purposes. The least organs and body parts were donated when the deceased opposed donation. Moreover, participants who were not registered organ donors donated fewer organs than registered donors. This effect was mediated by anticipated regret, disgust and the perceived benefits of donation. Organ donation campaigns should target such factors to increase donor rates.

Such perspectives are particularly valuable because IVF patients form a major recruitment group for oocyte donation for research, and because patients and donors have direct experience of the medical procedures involved. Similar studies of oocyte donation have been carried out elsewhere in the world, but to date very little social science research has been published that reports on donation for research, as distinct from donation for reproduction. Our respondents expressed a distinct unwillingness to donate viable oocytes for stem cell research. In our analysis we consider a number of factors that explain this unwillingness. These include the labour of oocyte production, the inscrutability of oocytes (the lack of a test to identify degrees of fertility) and the extent to which the oocytes' fertility sets the parameters for all downstream reproductive possibilities. We draw on the science studies literature on affordances to make sense of the social intractability of oocytes, and compare them with the respondents' much greater willingness to donate frozen embryos for human embryonic stem cells research.

It is well recognised that the methods of communication and communication skills of health professionals are key influences on decisions made by families regarding organ donation. This multicentre study is being performed in nine intensive care units with follow-up conducted by the Organ and Tissue Donation Service in New South Wales (NSW) Australia. The control condition is pre-intervention usual practice for at least six months before each site implements the intervention. The COMFORT intervention consists of six elements: family conversations regarding offers for organ donation to be led by a \"designated requester\"; family offers for donation are deferred to the designated requester; the offer of donation is separated from the end-of-life discussion that death is inevitable; it takes place within a structured family donation conversation using a \"balanced\" approach. Designated requesters may be intensivists, critical care nurses or social workers prepared by attending the three-day national \"Family Donation Conversation\" workshops, and the half-day NSW Simulation Program. The design is pre-post intervention to compare rates of family consent for organ donation six months before and under the intervention. Each ICU crosses from using the control to intervention condition after the site initiation visit. The primary endpoint is the consent rate for deceased organ donation calculated from 140 eligible next of kin families. Secondary endpoints are health professionals' adherence rates to core elements of the intervention; identification of predictors of family donation decision; and the proportion of families who regret their final donation decision at 90Â days. The pragmatic design of this study may identify 'what works' in usual clinical settings when requesting organ donation in critical care areas, both in terms of\n\nFrom fresh heterologous oocyte donation to autologous oocyte banking.\n\nPubMed\n\nStoop, D\n\n2012-01-01\n\nToday, oocyte donation has become well established, giving rise to thousands of children born worldwide annually. The introduction of oocyte cryopreservation through vitrification allows the introduction of egg banking, improving the efficiency and comfort of oocyte donation. Moreover, the vitrification technique can now enable autologous donation of oocytes to prevent future infertility. We evaluated fresh heterologous oocyte donation in terms of obstetrical and perinatal outcome as well as of the reproductive outcome of past donors. We then evaluated the efficiency of a closed vitrification device and its clinical applications within ART. Thirdly, we evaluated the opinion of women with regard to preventive egg freezing and the efficiency of a human oocyte in relation to age. Oocyte donation is associated with an increased risk of first trimester bleeding and pregnancy induced hypertension. Donating oocytes does not seem to increase the likelihood for a later need of fertility treatment. The chance of an oocyte to result in live birth (utilization rate) in women <37 years old remains constant with a mean of 4.47%. A significant proportion of young women would consider safeguarding their reproductive potential through egg freezing or are at least open to the idea. The introduction of efficient oocyte cryopreservation has revolutionized oocyte donation through the establishment of eggbank donation. The technique also enables women to perform autologous donation after preventive oocyte storage in order to circumvent their biological clock.\n\nInfluencing relatives to respect donor autonomy: Should we nudge families to consent to organ donation?\n\nPubMed\n\nSharif, Adnan; Moorlock, Greg\n\n2018-03-01\n\nRefusing consent to organ donation remains unacceptably high, and improving consent rates from family or next-of-kin is an important step to procuring more organs for solid organ transplantation in countries where this approval is sought. We have thus far failed to translate fully our limited understanding of why families refuse permission into successful strategies targeting consent in the setting of deceased organ donation, primarily because our interventions fail to target underlying cognitive obstacles. Novel interventions to overcome these hurdles, incorporating an understanding of cognitive psychology and behavioral change therapy, may be beneficial. One potential intervention is to use the concept of nudge theory, where decision-making is influenced by encouraging positive reinforcement and indirect suggestion. Purposefully nudging families to given consent for organ donation by understanding, and then overcoming, their inherent cognitive biases is novel but also controversial. This article explores the roles of relatives in decisions about organ donation, how nudge theory translates to organ donation and discusses the arguments for and against its application.

OPCs (NÂ =Â 102), recruited from a national sample of 16 organ procurement organizations, participated in a structured interview designed to uncover the communication strategies used in obtaining familial consent for donation. Analysis of interviews indicates OPCs' messages cover 4 domain areas. Specifically, OPCs report use of messages intended to (a) provide education, (b) discuss the benefits to donation, (c) learn about potential donor families, and (d) persuade families to engage in donation. Within the 4 domain areas, OPCs report use of 15 specific messages (e.g., \"positively framing the donor,\" \"social proof,\" \"discuss the benefit of donation to grieving\") in requesting consent. The present study provides a detailed examination of strategies and offers recommendations for using message strategies to explore the effectiveness of the consent process from the perspective of OPCs in approaching donor families.\n\nLife and Death Decisions: Using School-Based Health Education to Facilitate Family Discussion about Organ and Tissue Donation\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWaldrop, Deborah P.; Tamburlin, Judith A.; Thompson, Sanna J.; Simon, Mark\n\n2004-01-01\n\nPublic education that encourages family discussions about organ and tissue donation can enhance understanding, facilitate a donor's wishes and increase the numbers of donations.

Continuous growth in the number of patients with kidney failure has not been matched by an increase in the availability of kidneys for transplantation. This leads to long waiting lists, higher treatment costs and negative health outcomes. Discussion Misunderstandings, public uncertainty and issues of trust in the medical system, that limit willingness to be registered as a potential donor, could be addressed by community dissemination of information and new family practice initiatives that respond to individuals' personal beliefs and concerns regarding organ donation and transplantation. Summary Tackling both personal and public inertia on organ donation is important for any community oriented kidney donation campaign.

Representative survey. German general population: face-to-face interviews at home with 2,110 persons, aged 18-50 years. Patients were not included. No interventions took place. Approval and disapproval of treatment methods of reproductive medicine and preimplantation genetic diagnosis were assessed by questionnaires regarding medical, age, reasons, or general. Overall, the diverse treatment methods of reproductive medicine found comparable rates of approval and disapproval. Legalization of egg donation was approved by a slight majority (50.8%), particularly for medical reasons (35.9%). Surrogate mothering found lower overall rates of approval (43.7%), 28.5% supported an admission for medical reasons. Reproductive cloning was rejected by the vast majority (82.9%). Attitudes to reproductive medicine were affected by age and the individual reproductive experiences. New techniques in reproductive medicine and their development provide hope and health promises for affected couples but also entail long-term risks and ethical issues. Balancing the individual's right to a reproductive autonomy and choice and ethical standards will constitute a future challenge for society. Results demonstrate considerable uncertainty and information deficits in the community.\n\nExploring Motivations, Awareness of Side Effects, and Attitudes among Potential Egg Donors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGezinski, Lindsay B.; Karandikar, Sharvari; Carter, James; White, Melinda\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis research study surveyed prospective egg donors at orientation to (a) understand womenâs motivations to donate eggs, (b) assess awareness and knowledge of egg donation prior to entry into the egg donation program, and (c) explore attitudes toward egg donation. Ninety-two women completed the questionnaire at one fertility clinic located in the Midwest between August 2011 and August 2012. Descriptive and inferential statistics as well as textual analysis were used to analyze the data. Three themes emerged regarding participant motivations: (1) altruistic, (2) financial, and (3) desire to pass on genetic material. The majority of participants were unconcerned with potential physical and psychological side effects; however, differences emerged based on motherhood status and educational level. Although potential donors felt recipients should receive some information about the donor, they tended to value privacy regarding information giving to resultant offspring. This research study has implications for social work practice, policy, and future research. It is crucial that women receive adequate procedural and side effect information prior to engaging in egg donation.

At present, there is a global shortage of corneal transplant tissues, and failure to obtain consent from families of potential donors is a major limiting factor in tissue procurement. All family members of potential donors after cardiac death approached by the local eye bank staff members from January 2008 to December 2014 in Hong Kong were included. Reasons for consent or refusal and sociodemographic details of the deceased and the family members approached were reviewed. Trends in consent rates from 2008 to 2014 were examined. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine determinants of donation among cases from 2013 to 2014. A total of 1740 cases were identified. The overall consent rate was 36.8%, and the consent rate did not change significantly over the 7-year study period (P = 0.24). The most common reason for consent by family members was \"the wish to help others\" (86.0%), and the most common reason for refusal was \"traditional Chinese culture to keep the body intact after death\" (42.7%). From the multivariable analysis in the subset of cases from 2013 to 2014 (n = 628), family members were more likely to consent when the deceased was female (adjusted odds ratio 1.45, P = 0.03), with a do-not-resuscitate order (adjusted odds ratio 2.27, P < 0.001). The consent rate for eye donation did not change significantly from 2008 to 2014. Our findings suggest that health education and promotion campaigns need to address cultural barriers to organ donation.\n\nOrgan and tissue donation: are minorities willing to donate?\n\nPubMed\n\nDaniels, D E; Smith, K; Parks-Thomas, T; Gibbs, D; Robinson, J\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe Task Force on Organ Transplantation (DHHS,1986) addressed the issue of increasing organ donation. The Report of the Task Force recommended that \"educational efforts aimed at increasing organ donation among minority populations be developed and implemented, so that the donor population will more closely reflect the ethnicity of potential transplant recipients, in order to gain the advantage of improved donor and recipient immunologic matching (DHHS,1986). Donor rates for minorities has increased as follows: 16% in 1988 to 23% in 1995 among cadaveric donors and 24% in 1988 to 28% in 1995 among living donors. The improvement in donor rates among minorities may positively affect the transplantation success rate experienced by organ recipients of the same race. Strategies must be implemented that will increase the effectiveness and frequency of communication between minority patients and the medical community. An increase in the effectiveness of communication between potential minority donor families and the health care community will contribute to the process of Consciousness Raising as discussed by Prochasksa. The result of increased awareness of the organ donation and transplantation process may have a favorable impact on organ donation. The media has, through public service announcements, paid advertising and entertainment programming, attempted to promote discussion of organ donation in the community and within families. Johnson et al. discussed Mexican-American and Anglo-American Attitudes Toward Organ Donation. The primary impediment contributing to the disparity of consent rates between Mexican-American and Anglo-American population occurs with regard to the donation of organs of relatives. Johnson stated that this impediment to organ donation can be effectively addressed by promoting family discussion. Communication within families will inform surviving next of kin of the desire of the deceased to be an organ donor and hence improve the likelihood of the\n\nDeceased Organ Donation Registration and Familial Consent among Chinese and South Asians in Ontario, Canada\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Alvin Ho-ting; McArthur, Eric; Maclean, Janet; Isenor, Cynthia; Prakash, Versha; Kim, S. Joseph; Knoll, Greg; Shah, Baiju; Garg, Amit X.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective For various reasons, people of Chinese (China, Hong Kong or Taiwan) and South Asian (Indian subcontinent) ancestry (the two largest ethnic minority groups in Ontario, Canada) may be less likely to register for deceased organ donation than the general public, and their families may be less likely to consent for deceased organ donation at the time of death. Methods We conducted two population-based studies: (1) a cross-sectional study of deceased organ donor registration as of May 2013, and (2) a cohort study of the steps in proceeding with deceased organ donation for patients who died in hospital from October 2008 to December 2012. Results A total of 49 938 of 559 714 Chinese individuals (8.9%) and 47 774 of 374 291 South Asians (12.8%) were registered for deceased organ donation, proportions lower than the general public (2 676 260 of 10 548 249 (25.4%). Among the 168 703 Ontarians who died in a hospital, the families of 33 of 81 Chinese (40.1%; 95% CI: 30.7%-51.6%) and 39 of 72 South Asian individuals (54.2%; 95% CI: 42.7-65.2%) consented for deceased organ donation, proportions lower than the general public (68.3%; 95% CI: 66.4%-70.0%).
