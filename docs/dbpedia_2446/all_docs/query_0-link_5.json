        "text": "In 1942 Acting Flight Lieutenant A K Gatward with Sergeant G F Fern flew a Bristol Beaufighter over the streets of Paris at the level of third floor windows. They floated a Tricolour down on to the Arc de Triomphe in an audacious morale boosting exercise.\n\nAlfred Kitchener Gatward (known as Ken) was born in Hornsey in1914 and lived at 27 Meadway Southgate. He enlisted as air crew in 1937 and was commissioned in 1940.\n\nDuring WW2 he was awarded the DSO, DFC and bar.\n\nThe citation for bar to the DFC in 1944 states he “has led the squadron with great skill and gallantry in many sorties. In July this year he participated in an operation which resulted in the destruction of an enemy convoy”\n\nIn August Wing Commander Gatward led the squadron in an attack in the Gironde area. During this operation his aircraft was repeatedly hit by anti-aircraft fire and sustained serious damage.\n\nIn the same edition of the Enfield Gazette that reports Acting Wing Commander Gatward’s Bar to the DFC there is another article about his brothers:\n\nLieutenant Douglas Gatward killed in Italy\n\nCorporal Frederick Gatward, Royal Marines, missing presumed dead.\n\nAfter the war a replica Tricolour was presented to Wing Commander Gatward. The ceremony took place in Broomfield Park. The Flag is now in Christ Church, Waterfall Road."
