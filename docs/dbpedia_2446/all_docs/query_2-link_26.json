        "text": "In memory of my mother, Irene May, born in Aughton in 1926, who died on 23 April 2022.\n\nFour girls, representing three generations of my family, all educated at Aughton Parochial School, Holt Green, near Ormskirk. My grandmother, Emily (born 1895):\n\nMy mother, Irene May (born 1926):\n\nMy sister, Jacqueline (born 1949):\n\nAnd myself, Kathryn (born 1955):\n\nThe bus fare was tuppence from Whalley Drive in Town Green down to Aughton Parochial School in Holt Green. Naturally, I only remember dramatic events from those journeys such as when I dropped my two big pennies into a jam jar full of tadpoles just before the conductor asked for my fare. Or when I took a bunch of dahlias for decoration of a church window at Harvest and earwigs crawled out of them, dropping onto the floor of the bus to the accompaniment of much squealing.\n\nWhen I started school in 1960, my sister Jacqueline was in her last year and a pupil in the ‘top class’, taught by the Headmistress, Miss Howard. At the same time, I was in the Infants class where my teacher was Mrs Midlane, who I remember exuding patience and kindness. Our other teachers were Miss Davenhill, Mr Bamber and Miss Marsh. I do not remember any of them ever being absent. There was a comforting sense of permanence and predictability.\n\nI thought nothing of the fact that my mother, grandmother and all her four sisters and two brothers had also attended that same village school. But in recent years I have thought back to the high classroom windows, outside lavatories, ancient dark wooden desks in pairs, learning by rote and strict regimes and realised that across three generations we shared many of the same experiences.\n\nThe first school at Holt Green was opened in 1836 and the second school building was opened in July 1881. The photo below dates from 1912 when the cross was erected. It shows the two buildings as they were when my mother was a pupil in the 1930s. The chimney on the right was for the classroom fire where Miss Perry made hot chocolate for her pupils. The school would have looked like this in my grandmother’s time but the Green was then a grassy space where the children played rounders.\n\nThe photo below was taken on 28 June 2017 and shows the inscription on the oldest part of the school:\n\nThe postcard below, postmarked 1909, shows Brookfield Lane looking towards Holt Green. The back of the school can be seen on the right.\n\nThe picture below was taken in front of the school in 1908. My grandmother’s brother, Bob Sawyer (born 1903), is the third boy from the left on the back row. Miss Prior stands on the right and Miss Perry on the left.\n\nMiss Gertrude Marguerite Perry was Headmistress of the Junior Department of Aughton Parochial School from 1904. My mother remembers her living with her sister in a now-demolished house called Beechen Green in Sandy Lane. Miss Perry taught my grandmother how to sew and this became the foundation of her work as a dressmaker. My grandmother later made dresses for her former teacher and would take my mother with her when she went round to Miss Perry’s house for ‘fittings’. Mum remembers that Miss Perry had a parrot which flew freely around the room and probably led to my mother’s fear of birds indoors.\n\nWhen Miss Perry retired at the end of 1935, Miss Elizabeth Ellen Ashton took her place. Aughton Parish Magazine of November 1938 records: ‘As our readers are probably aware, our excellent headmistress, Miss Ashton, was married on October 8th to the Rev Hugh Williams, some time curate of this parish. We wish the Rev Hugh and Mrs Williams a long and happy married life. Mrs Williams is much beloved by the children of Holt Green School, and it is some consolation to know that she is keeping on her present post till Christmas. The managers will consider themselves fortunate if they can get a successor equal to Mrs Williams.’\n\nThe centenary of the school in 1936 was celebrated with a concert at the Aughton Institute on 11 December. The Aughton Parish Magazine of January 1937 lists the performers, including those in the Junior department who performed the operetta ‘The Wishing Cap’. It must have been a memorable occasion and my mother remember Miss Ashton teaching the dances. Imagine my mother’s disappointment when she took ill on the day of the concert. Joyce Brighouse took her place in a gipsy dance with Margaret Banks. Many of the performers are pictured in this school photo. My mother is in the middle row, the second girl from the right. She remembers most of the names: William Prescott, Kenneth Ashcroft, Stephen Hall, Frank Mordaunt, Denis Harrocks, Stan Mawdsley, Robert Crompton, Mona Hesketh, Mary Brighouse, Gladys Mordaunt, Joyce Brighouse, Lily Lunt, Mary Ashton, Joan Pennington, Margaret Banks, Audrey Massam, Irene Webb, Joyce Rigby, Philip Banks, Mary Woodward, Enid Crompton, Eileen Preece, Margery Lunham, Eileen Houghton, Joan Pickett, Joyce Lunham, Grace Dobson, Harold Huyton, Allan Hunter, Harold Cooper.\n\nMiss Rebecca Elizabeth Prior, born in 1886, was Headmistress of the Aughton Parochial Infants School from 1907. She lived in a house called High Lea in Town Green Lane. My mother remembers Miss Prior teaching her how to knit on large wooden needles when she was about six years old.\n\nAn infants’ classroom was added in 1954. The Rector, Revd Canon Gerald Jones, in the Aughton Parish Magazine of August 1954 describes the opening of the extension: ‘After years of planning and hoping our new School Extension was opened by the Bishop of Warrington on 2nd July, in the presence of a large assembly of representative people, including the Archdeacon of Warrington, Canon Redwood, Chief Supt Floyd, Mr William Rigby, Mr A W Glenn, Mr A E Newall, Mr W J Norman JP (architect), Miss Howard. Managers present were Mr T B Medcalf, the architect; Miss M Holmes, Councillor G H McElroy, Mr J Lake and Mr D A Thomas (correspondent). The Ormskirk Advertiser gave an excellent account of the proceedings. An interesting item on the agenda was the unveiling by Mrs G E Jones of the beautiful mural painting by the late Mr W J Medcalf, which Mr T B Medcalf and his family had presented to the school. The School Choir sang some very appropriate songs and the whole audience joined in the hymns which followed the prayers. The old school had been beautifully arranged with tea tables and many flowers. All our guests were invited to tea. The new Extension has already been greatly admired. The kitchen and cloakrooms are not yet finished, but the completed building should be a very useful and adequate addition to our Schools. News has just come in that the forecourt is to be attended to. This will add to the amenities of the whole frontage.’\n\nIt was a different story for the other pupils who had to endure outside lavatories and an open-air urinal for the boys. There were some wash basins in a separate small cloakroom area but I cannot recall them being used very much. If we were thirsty we would cup our hands under the tap to get a drink. In the early 1960s there was building work carried out in the summer holidays and we went back in September to find new cloakrooms and indoor lavatories. It was a novelty to have a water fountain too. The picture below shows how the school looked at that time.\n\nThe class photo below shows my sister, Jacqueline, in the middle row, third from the right. The teacher is Mr Edward Bamber. Also in the photo are: Janet Scaife, Stephanie Graves, Susan Cave, Judith Ashcroft, Michael Edge, Mary King, Patty Rothwell and Bobby Caunce.\n\nEvery morning the whole school had an assembly when we would sing at least one hymn. On Wednesdays, the Rector from St Michael’s Church (in my time, Revd Canon Gerald Jones, then Revd Canon Leslie Eyres) would lead the assembly. During Lent, we would walk down to the church for our assembly. I loved singing hymns and still do. In Miss Howard’s class we listened to a BBC Radio for Schools programme called Singing Together. This was a favourite time for me and we learnt many songs such as Ould John Braddlum, The Ash Grove, Green Grow the Rushes O and The Vicar of Bray.\n\nThe picture above shows Miss Betty Davenhill with 33 pupils in the summer of 1963; I am on the top row, the second girl in from the right. I know from my school report that there were only 17 pupils in Miss Davenhill’s class and I suspect pupils from the next youngest class are also in this photo. Their names are: Top row (left to right) – Gillian Shuker, Ruth Ashcroft, Sally Jarrett, Robert Rimmer, Annette Birchall, Mary Lowe, Kathryn Bampton, Alison Tate. Second row (left to right) – Suzanne Calderbank, Naomi Dallop, Paul Thomas, Barry Thomas, Susan Gatward, Philip Daniels, Philip Moorcroft, Vivienne Smith. Third row (left to right) – Geoffrey Cook, Lynne Campbell, Diane Clegg, Willy Bond, Linda Halsall, Stephen Prescott, Janet Custard, Elaine Hughes, Elaine Bevan, Martin Burt. Bottom row (left to right) – Lynn Bond, Jean Hughes, June Oldfield, Keith Bickerstaffe, Eleanor Seiffert, Janet Furlong, Pauline Rimmer.\n\nAt playtime, we could buy biscuits from our teacher to have with our school milk. They cost ½d or 1d. I usually enjoyed my third of a pint of milk but in the summer the bottles had been sitting in the sunshine before we arrived at school and the milk had turned sour. On cold winter mornings, the top of the milk would have frozen and pushed up the silver foil top which was quite exciting and did not stop us from trying to push our straws into the little bottles.\n\nThe infants played on the paved area at the front of the school. All the other children played at the back, where there was a playground covered with cinders. This was crunchy and made a terrible mess of our grazed knees when we fell over. There was also a Second World War air raid shelter, completely bricked up, in the playground. Jacqueline remembers playing with yo-yos, marbles, skipping ropes and hoola-hoops. I remember a game using toddler’s walking reins – one girl would put this on and pretend to be a horse, while another girl held the reins and followed on behind the trotting or cantering ‘horse’. At the end of each playtime, we would line up in order of height at the front of the school in silence before we filed back into the building.\n\nOne afternoon a week, the girls in Miss Howard’s class did sewing or knitting while the boys learnt geometry. I remember knitting an egg cosy while half listening to Miss Howard teaching the boys about angles at the other side of the room.\n\nWe usually had at least one student teacher from Edge Hill Training College in Ormskirk during the year. Jacqueline remembers a Mr Khoo from Japan. I remember that they often used new teaching methods, some of which involved us working things out for ourselves. It was a relief to have our usual teacher at the front of the classroom and reverting to learning by rote.\n\nAt the end of Friday afternoons in Miss Howard’s class, we read from books kept in their own little cupboard. They were all covered in brown paper so they did not look in any way appealing.\n\nThere were various monitors’ positions in the school. Two boys were appointed as ‘ink monitors’. They had to mix an ink powder with water. Very messy! Some of the girls in Miss Howard’s class made coffee for the teachers during morning playtime. I remember this involved heating milk on a gas stove and using ground coffee. We then carried the steaming hot coffee to the teachers.\n\nAt regular intervals we were visited by ‘Nitty Nora’, a School Nurse, who came to inspect our heads for any sign of head lice. She would also come with the School Medical Officer when we had immunisations.\n\nWe did not have a school uniform but we could wear a school blazer if we wished and, for those of us who had one, this was often worn at the week-ends too. The picture below shows Jacqueline one week-end, during a family walk, wearing her blazer with the school badge.\n\nDuring Jacqueline’s time at the school and most of my own, we had a summer sports day on the lawn of The Old Rectory which was owned by Mrs Chaytor. It was a beautiful lawn surrounded by trees and my memory is that the sun always shone. Some of the races were: three-legged, sack, egg and spoon, obstacle and relay. We wore coloured bands to show our team (red, yellow, green or blue). At the end of the afternoon, Mrs Chaytor always provided us with ice cream. The Old Rectory was demolished in 1970 and the site made way for Old Rectory Green.\n\nMiss Howard retired in the year I left the school and the picture below, taken from the Ormskirk Advertiser, shows her on her last Speech Day and prize giving in 1966. It shows Mr Eade, the Divisional Officer of Education, Miss Howard, myself, Deborah Dowdle and Jane Jones.\n\nThe photo below was taken by my mother on its last day as a school. It looks very similar to how it was when I left in 1966.\n\nThe old school buildings were turned into Silver Birch Lodge Nursing Home but after that closed the site was sold for housing development. You could now (in 2022) live in some of the old schoolrooms. The school itself – now called Aughton St Michael’s Church of England Primary School – moved to Delph Park Avenue.\n\nPostscript: My grandmother, Emily, lived all her life in Aughton and died there in 1958. My mother, Irene, moved from Aughton to Kendal, Cumbria in 2004 and died in 2022. My sister, Jacqueline, moved from Aughton to Cumbria in 1974. I moved from Aughton in 1980 and now live in a village in Northamptonshire.\n\n©Kathryn Baird, 2022"
