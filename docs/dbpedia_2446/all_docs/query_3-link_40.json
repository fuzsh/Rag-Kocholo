        "text": "Galley Beggar Advent Calendar: 2021’s Cultural Highlights\n\n1 December: Paul Ewen.\n\nMY 2021 HAS BEEN BOOK-ENDED BY TWO NON-FICTION BOOKS, one of which came out in 2006, and one which hasn’t been published yet. The first is Jay Griffiths’ incredible Wild (Hamish Hamilton), which I only just caught up on this year. It deals with humanity’s innate connection with wild nature, and how we as humans are suppressing our own wildness. It has become one of those very special books in my life. During the year I really enjoyed Laura Jean McKay’s novel, The Animals In That Country (Scribe), which deservedly picked up the Arthur C Clarke award. Dan Rhodes inspired me to start writing comedy fiction many years ago, and this year he poked fun at the literary world with his latest novel, Sour Grapes (Lightning Books). My film recommendation is the short documentary, Man on a Plane by Fergal McEntee, which is about the Paralympian, James Brown, who was arrested, and is currently imprisoned, for climbing on top of a British Airways plane in October 2019, in order to raise awareness of the environmental and ecological emergency. Please watch and share widely. Musically, I really got into Divide & Dissolve’s Gas Lit, and my new favourite south-London band is Dry Cleaning (check out their brilliant music videos). Then recently I was very fortunate to receive an advance copy of Rebel, Rebel: An Emergency Dialogue by Susana Medina and Roc Sandford, which is a wonderful, chatty look back over the brief life of Extinction Rebellion and why it’s here. Very highly recommended – excerpt here. This year I was proud to be involved with the Writers Rebel Paint the Land art piece on the Thames, featuring the words of Ben Okri brought to life on real grass by artists Ackroyd & Harvey. I was also very proud to hear that my father, John Ewen, was joint winner of the Radio New Zealand Short Story competition, aged 85. For anyone who thinks their moment has passed, think again. 2022 could be your year.\n\n2 December: Susan Tomaselli.\n\nMYSELF AND JUNE HAVE (MOSTLY) SPENT THE PANDEMIC TOGETHER. But having exhausted all episodes of Couples Come Dine With Me (and then the regular Come Dine With Me) – nostalgic for dinner parties, sitting round a table sharing food and drink with friends, the more wine the better – I used a chink in the second (third?) lockdown to get out of the house and get into my favourite Dublin gallery, the Hugh Lane (home to a recreation of Francis Bacon’s very messy studio), to look at an exhibition of Joseph Beuys in Ireland. I'm not really a fan of state sponsored graffiti (too sanitised, obviously) but I was really struck by Pass Freely, a giant mural by Asbestos a stone's throw from the gallery, on the sidewall of a derelict site on O’Connell Street (once the widest city street in Europe). The site is opposite The Gresham Hotel (as featured in James Joyce’s The Dead) and is not developed as plans for a new department store fell through, and so the lot looks like a chipped tooth. Pass Freely takes its name from Beuys (‘pass freely from one level of existence to another...’) and is a figure made up of burnt matches, each match a person who died of Covid. It’s a powerful testament to what we’re living through and matches will be added to it until the pandemic ends. And talking of living, Deborah Levy’s Real Estate (the third part of her ‘living autobiography’) is dazzling. Levy can do more in one sentence than most of us can do in an entire paragraph. Funny, brilliant, and wise. I’ve also been following the output of Nathan O’Donnell, my fellow writer-in-residence at Maynooth (a residency spent in the comfort of our respective houses), and Nathan has formed a new publishing enterprise with Marysia Wieckiewicz-Carroll, Numbered Editions, their first title being Figure|Ground. It’s described as a ‘set of visual and textual reflections on mapping and place’, and is another safe way of travelling beyond my four walls.\n\n3 December: Isabel Waidner.\n\nEVERYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT ME will know that Linda Stupart and Carl Gent’s 2019 artists’ play All Us Girls Have Been Dead For So Long lists among my top pieces of performance art of all time. Incredible news is, the play script will be published before the end of the year by art publisher Arcadia Missa! Name another piece of writing that combines Ecco the Dolphin computer game aesthetics with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, or queer sexiness with Margaret Cavendish’s 17th century proto science fiction The Blazing World—I will not wait as there isn’t one!! Secondly, one of the few live performances I managed to see this year was Mojisola Adebayo’s Family Tree, a play-in-progress about the historical figure Henrietta Lacks, an African-American woman whose cancer cells were harvested without her consent and used as the source of the first ‘immortalised’ human cell line. The play raises critical questions about the ethics of science including the exploitation of black people at the heart of it and is a must-see when the full production will come to London next year. My third pick is Orion J. Facey’s sci-fi novel The Virosexuals, published by PSS, the A* publishing venture that brought us Sin Wai Kin’s iconic Dream Babez zines. If the novel’s hugely imaginative narrative about a futuristic subculture where people are sexually attracted to transmitting and receiving STIs isn’t enough, the cover art by Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley is worth the price of £20 easily! Next up, D Mortimer’s Last Night A Beef Jerk Saved My Life published by Pilot Press. In this debut collection, the essayist and poet navigates trans crip narratives with a sensitivity and panache that makes this the exact item to gift your girlfriend for xmas or Valentine's Day! Finally, I won’t let the year go without celebrating Cipher Press’s impact on the UK indie lit scene. Bringing us novels like Alison Rumfitt’s Tell Me I’m Worthless and Brontez Purnell’s 100 Boyfriends, this brand new queer publisher based in East London will be where it’s at for some time.\n\n4 December: Uschi Gatward.\n\nTHE CULTURAL HIGHLIGHT OF MY YEAR was going to see Matthew Bourne’s new ballet The Midnight Bell, based on the novels of Patrick Hamilton. My experience of it was sharpened by the fact that it was my first time in a theatre since Covid (a full house on a Thursday matinee), but the production was brilliant and hugely enjoyable. The run has just finished but I would be amazed if this show didn’t get funding to tour further, so look out for it at a venue near you in 2022/3.\n\nWhile I was in hospital earlier in the year a dear friend brought me The Journals of Denton Welch, and they were perfect illness reading. The writer was completely new to me (though I feel I know him very well now), but the journals are full of everything I like best, including itemized accounts of picnic food, Georgian china, dolls’ houses and their accoutrements, pricing-up of other people’s jewellery, and candid observations concerning encounters with celebrities (Edith Sitwell, Vita Sackville-West) and fans. I am definitely going to adopt Denton’s genius idea of serving Ryvita in the toast rack.\n\nSet in the same historical period but a world apart, Olivia Manning’s newly-reissued Balkan Trilogy and Levant Trilogy were other reading highlights of my year (in fact, of my reading life).\n\nA few weeks ago I visited King’s College Chapel in Cambridge for Evensong – a very magical thing to do at this time of year. Both a performance – world class yet intimate – and an act of communion, it’s a church service and therefore free and all are welcome. Thomas Tallis was on offer when I was there.\n\nFinally, I haven’t yet managed to see Mixing it Up at the Hayward but it looks terrific from the catalogue, which contains a lovely short essay on each artist by the likes of Jeremy Atherton Lin and Rosanna Mclaughlin. The Peter Doigs look stellar, and I love the works by Allison Katz and Lubaina Himid. Even the works I don’t love have a huge energy. The show’s on until 12 December.\n\n5 December: Jeet Thayil.\n\nI’VE BEEN ON A JAPANESE CRIME BINGE. These writers are far removed from the world of Scandi crime: there are no five-page descriptions of someone being tortured. Instead, you get stories constructed like puzzles – an old-fashioned way of writing a thriller, and a comfort for these dread times. I’m recommending Natsuo Kirino, Fumiko Enchi and Keigo Higashino. Their novels like a vintage maze, dead ends, red herrings, false trails, surprises. A highlight of the year, for me, was to look again at John Deakin’s London photographs (thanks to the Deakin Archive): gorgeous images of poets and painters and gangsters, a weird tenderness at work. Under the Influence: John Deakin and the Lure of Soho, A Maverick Eye: The Street Photography of John Deakin and John Deakin: Photographs make it absolutely clear (if clarity was at all needed) that he was – despite his instinct for self-sabotage – among the great artists of post-war Britain.\n\n6 December: Lucy Ellmann.\n\nWHEN CAUGHT FROZEN IN TIME AND PLACE BY A PANDEMIC, one’s best escape is through the arts. First, to Reinhard Behrens’s freezing north. An old tin submarine, manned by a solo pilot, fondly appears in every painting. The sub, which seems to be circumnavigating the globe, is especially intrepid when traversing arctic waters. Lockdown resulted in an increase in movie watching for us, some of it worthwhile. There just aren’t enough good movies in the world. We had a nice Charles Laughton phase, with Ruggles of Red Gap and Hobson’s Choice. And Joseph Losey’s beautiful Don Giovanni, filmed in a lagoon landscape near Venice, with Ruggero Raimondi as the womaniser, is perfetto! I was moved by a documentary about Martha Argerich called Bloody Daughter, and Louis Malle’s My Dinner with Andre – the latter was partly written by Wallace Shawn, whose Marxist monologue The Fever is furious and persuasive, as well as being very funny. Tamara Jenkins’s Private Life, with Paul Giamatti and Kathryn Hahn, provides the most convincing depiction of a marriage I ever saw on screen. Meanwhile, the delicious deluge of Fran Lebowitz we got in Martin Scorcese’s “Pretend It’s a City” improved my life no end. Nina Stibbe’s Love, Nina was also a great find. It’s not the Kentish Town literary crowd she studies, it’s her top-notch comic timing. I loved Gogol’s unique take on the absurd in The Nose. And Little Dorrit filled my autumn – Dickens at his most playful, an indefatigable volcano of humorous analogies. (The more melodramatic aspects of the plot are best ignored.) Christine Edzard’s film of Little Dorrit is splendid too, with Miriam Margolyes’s Flora the real star. Flora should have been the main character in the book (as usual, Dickens’s actual choice of heroine is a bit of a drip). Now I’m reading Devoted Ladies by Molly Keane: acrobatically clever, snide and ridiculous, it’s about a bunch of insouciant flibbertigibbets who say things like “when does the Pussy Willow kitten?” Keane is the most unsung genius around.\n\n7 December: Seán Hewitt.\n\nTHIS YEAR, I loved Torrey Peters’s Detransition, Baby – sharp, funny, compulsive; and Shon Faye’s The Transgender Issue, which I listened to on Audible. Speaking of which, I returned over and over again to Toni Morrison’s sumptuous narrations of her own audiobooks, and have recently listened to Tom Rasmussen’s Diary of a Drag Queen, which is extremely, riotously fun. I’ve just downloaded Ingrid Persaud’s Love After Love, narrated by the author, and it’s completely brilliant.\n\nGoing into the winter months, I’ve picked up a copy of Melmoth the Wanderer after speaking to many people about it following its 250th anniversary, celebrated recently at Marsh’s Library in Dublin, and I’m looking forward to the promised madness of the plotting. I also rediscovered my love for Kate O’Brien (particularly her staggeringly good novel The Ante-Room), and for the Swedish modernist poet Karin Boye. Andrew McMillan’s pandemonium was one of the best books of poetry to come out in a strong year for the form, as was Hannah Lowe’s The Kids. I loved G.C. Waldrep’s The Earliest Witnesses, released in January by Carcanet, and though I haven’t seen it mentioned often, it was a brilliant collection.\n\nLooking to the new year, I was so privileged to get advance copies of Anna Della Subin’s Accidental Gods (forthcoming from Granta in January); Okechukwu Nzelu’s Here Again Now (forthcoming from Dialogue in March); and Niamh Campbell’s We Were Young (Weidenfield & Nicolson, February 2022). Subin’s book is a mind-boggling, erudite work of nonfiction, meticulously researched, tracing the modern history of men turned into gods; Nzelu’s is a heartbreaking and formally-intelligent novel about love, grief, and recovery; and Campbell’s is one of the best novels about contemporary Dublin I’ve ever read.\n\n8 December: Rónán Hession.\n\nTHE MORE I TRY TO DEVELOP MY WRITING, the more I find myself having to develop my reading, so this year, instead of being my usual promiscuous self, I tried serial monogamy with particular writers. I spent a couple of months reading the translated novels of Croatian writer Daša Drndić – Belladonna and its follow-up EEG were standouts (both translated by Celia Hawkesworth; MacLehose Press). I had another where-have-you-been-all-my-life reading experience with Agota Kristof, and adored her trilogy: The Notebook (translated by Alan Sheridan; CB Editions), The Proof (translated by David Watson; CB Editions), The Third Lie (translated by Marc Romano). I squeezed some in-person art forms into the gaps between lockdowns. Malta-based Irish artist Miriam McConnon had a stunning exhibition Displaced Privilege at the Olivier Cornet Gallery in Dublin and I loved Conversations After Sex, the first solo play by Marc O’Halloran in a decade. The best movie I saw was About Endlessness by Roy Andersson. I had two operations this year and the soundtrack to my recovery was Crack-Up by Fleet Foxes.\n\n9 December: Elizabeth Chakrabarty.\n\nIn 2021 I followed COVID news via @devisridhar on Twitter; science rather than the government. Also online, through being published during lockdown, I discovered the journal Bad Form and podcast This Is My Voice, championing diverse literary voices. Reading poetry helped escape Zoom and lockdown — the humanism of Maggie Smith’s Keep Moving; Nikita Gill’s Where Hope Comes From — and reading novels published much earlier, set in other countries. Sayaka Murata’s Convenience Store Woman, translated by Ginney Tapley Takemori, made me laugh out loud along with the main character, trying to fit into the weirdness of work and family; Naoise Dolan’s review illuminated aspects of autism, how interacting with others requires a script. On the workplace, on academia from the outside, I’m still in awe of Sara Ahmed. I missed India; amazing to be in Pune while reading Avni Doshi’s novel Burnt Sugar, exploring the impact into adulthood of a mother-daughter relationship. In US fiction I loved how what’s seen as ordinary is shown as weird, in Carmen Maria Machado’s Her Body & Other Parties, and in Catherine Lacey’s Pew, how odd society’s gender binaries are, the more closely you look. Back in Britain, Sarah Hall’s pandemic-set novel Burntcoat was a reminder of her great dystopian novel The Carhullan Army, and how brilliant she is at depicting sex and intimacy. Thinking of human contact, like others who often feel excluded in contemporary culture and politics, I was drawn to demonstrations protesting climate change, and supporting the lives of humans treated as less than human; in the shadow of Covid, images of inequality on the news were even more overwhelming than usual. Some television felt long overdue: Steve McQueen’s Small Axe examined racism within UK structures and institutions, while Freddie Mercury: The Final Act recounted the homophobia of an era when HIV/AIDS took away many of my friends, and to be gay was to be hidden and stigmatised, so movingly reflected in the late George Michael’s heart-breaking interpretation of Mercury’s ‘Somebody to Love’. Exploding the cliché of the so-called safety of the heterosexual family, galleries and theatres reopened with the deeply disturbing paintings of Paola Rego (Tate Britain), Cush Jumbo as Hamlet (Young Vic), Wise Children’s Wuthering Heights, and a twenty-first century psychoanalytical Romeo & Juliet (Shakespeare’s Globe). At home, I often played Labi Siffre’s ’(Something Inside) So Strong’; still inspiring after all these years.\n\n10 December: Todd McEwen.\n\nIT’S GREAT WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER SOMETHING YOU’VE NEVER HEARD OF, especially when you feel you ought to have heard of it. This happened to me twice this year… I was watching a Bernard Tavernier documentary on French film which mentioned Louis Malle’s Lift to the Scaffold, of which I had never heard. Its score was improvised by Miles Davis, and this is the kind of thing that makes me run around the house hitting myself in the head with a hammer. An immediately intimate, ingratiating film that is gritty, and warm, laced with a surprising, affectionate humour straight out of Jacques Tati. The other hammer incident was prompted by a friend mentioning a book about Robert Louis Stevenson by Ian Bell, a late Scottish journalist of great perception and taste, and frankly who had the best politics around. THIS IS THE ONLY BOOK ABOUT STEVENSON. Robert Louis Stevenson: Dreams of Exile is succinct and deep, and cuts though all the bullshit surrounding this poor man like a hot knife through butter. When I think of all the incredibly bad books about R.L.S. that have been written, and that I have read, I want to to cry. The Edinburgh artist Paul Furneaux studied mokuhanga, the art of traditional wood block printing in Japan. This month he’s had a solo show at the Royal Scottish Academy. It’s his best work yet, much of which is made intense and luminous by an overlay of resin which makes these beautifully conceived, poetic, abstract panels glow.\n\nI discovered a cook I like. Francis Mallmann likes to burn things, and the way he burns things is much better than the way I burn things. I finally know how to cook a steak! And although the Metropolitan Opera, in its wisdom, has stopped streaming opera every day for free, which it generously did for much of lockdown, it is possible to subscribe online. The amazingly talented artist and designer William Kentridge’s production of Shostakovich’s The Nose has to be seen to be believed. No – even then you will not believe it. So it costs US$150 a year. As my cousin points out, that’s a hell of a lot cheaper than going to the opera.\n\n11 December: Will Eaves.\n\nYOU DON’T HAVE TO BE SCROOGE to feel the pinch of guilt at this time of year. Somewhere in the archival muddle of my room there is a fearful papery spectre groping blindly for recognition and revenge – the manifestation of all I have left unread, undone – and I can offer it only a few names in propitiation: Peter Blegvad for Imagine, Observe, Remember (Uniformbooks), a brilliant picture-essay about draughtsmanship and the problems of perception and memory; Charles Boyle for The Other Jack (CB Editions), his beautiful quasi-novel about reading as a kind of hankering after connection; the composer-pianist Thomas Adès for The Dante Project (a ballet), Alchymia (a clarinet quintet) and Märchentänze (a series of folk-derived and bird-influenced songs/dances for violin and piano); Niven Govinden for his Robbe-Grillet-tinged Diary of a Film (Dialogue Books); Helen Frankenthaler for Radical Beauty, an exhibition of woodcuts at the Dulwich Picture Gallery; Yoshida Kenko (b. 1283) for Essays in Idleness, about everything from medieval Japanese court etiquette (will the Emperor eat dried salmon?) to morbid anxiety (don’t knock it); Yola – the Bristolian reincarnation of Fontella Bass – for Stand By Myself; and Liza Tarbuck (BBC Radio 2), every Saturday, at 6pm, for everything else.\n\n12 December: June Caldwell.\n\nDRAMA: I May Destroy You [BBC link here], for the best TV script yet and the way it unashamedly bashes nuance around the head. Created by and starring Michaela Coel, it deals with the thorny issue of sexual consent from the point of view of an up-and-coming writer. Honestly, I felt sick to the gills, but was equally in awe. It covers just about every scenario you dare not imagine, and the ones strategically forgotten. It really does highlight how rubbish other dramas are at capturing real life issues. Superb. It’s made me want to write for screen.\n\nNOVEL: Small Things Like These; like a really savvy skydiver, Claire Keegan manages to land perfectly and safely every single time; it’s no wonder there’s such literary-ledgebag shenanigans built up around her. This story is so brilliantly carved, and from an unusual point of view of a man affected by the sordid history of Ireland’s Magdalen laundries. Characterisation is incredible. You’ll need to shut the day out, switch on the reading lamp, fully digest in just a few hours. Afterwards, you will feel sad, angry, appalled, upset, and grateful for being reminded all over again how disgusting Irish institutions behaved towards women and children. How very much ‘nothing’ we were in the eyes of both church and state, for too long a time. This is a tiny tale on behalf of tens of thousands of lives affected, women silenced, children obliterated. Thank you Claire.\n\nJEWELLERY: Autumn Aurelia, describing herself a ‘queer disabled maker of magical, whimsical jewellery for magical people’, these nuggets of gorgeousness, from giant fox necklaces to hanging croissant earrings, are fun, colourful, unusual, made in Belfast by a woman with a gorgeous heart who talks openly about mental health issues with empathy and love. Obsessed with her work!\n\nRANDOM ITEM OF HELL: Christmas Toilet Roll. Is there anything more appalling to remind us that capitalism has every situation and orifice covered? Erase those festive hangovers and in doing so, wipe that smile straight off Santa’s smug face.\n\n13 December: Sam Jordison and Eloise Millar.\n\nSAM JORDISON:\n\nMY TINY MIND WAS BLOWN by Mario Levrero's The Luminous Novel, wonderfully translated by Annie McDermott (And Other Stories). Who knew a book about not writing and not getting anything done could be such an achievement? And that wasn't the only superb novel from Uruguay I read this year. I was also simultaneously awed and disgusted (disgusted!) by The Rooftop by Fernanda Trías – translated again by Annie McDermot (Charco Press). Lana Del Rey put out not one but two superb albums, Chemtrails Over The Country Club and Blue Banisters. The documentary Summer Of Soul (streaming on Disney+; teaser here) may have a depressing backstory (it features footage from a 1969 concert that hasn't been seen before now because most of he performers were black), but it's also the most life-affirming thing you will watch all year. And just wait until you see Stevie Wonder play the holy hell out of a set of drums. The Ken Burns Hemingway documentary (BBC iplayer) was old-fashioned depressing, but also a fantastically researched and presented series, showing just how complicated Hemingway could be, for better and for worse. Finally, you might have heard of Charles Dickens? You might even have read some of his books? But have you read one recently? If you haven’t, I’m here to persuade you to give yourself the most wonderful treat and enjoy David Copperfield. It’s so good and it’s so full of kindness that it’s surprising that Nadine Dorries hasn’t tried to ban it.\n\nELOISE MILLAR:\n\nI WENT TO LONDON FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 18 MONTHS (18 months!) and was enchanted by Anicka Yi’s squid-like contraptions in the Tate Modern. At home, weekends have been enlivened by David Collard’s bighearted Carthorse Orchestra, a weekly online gathering of writers, artists, musicians and all sorts of people doing all sorts of things. (The current season has come to an end, but hopefully David will be hosting something similar in the future.) I love TV – and loved especially the BBC this year for giving us the second season of Ghosts. (There’s a Christmas special on the 23rd December. I can’t wait.)\n\nFor books: It’s hard to describe Jeet Thayil’s The Names of the Women (Jonathan Cape), because put simply – a feminist, fictional reimagining of the lives of fifteen women from the New Testament – it sounds as worthy as all hell. Far from it. This is a playful, inventive, beautiful novel. (The chapter on Salome gave me goosebumps.) Other standouts from what has been a really terrific year for reading = Buchi Emecheta’s The Joys of Motherhood (Heinemann), which I came across while researching Chinua Achebe for our Galley Beggar critical reading class. Billed as a female counterpart to Things Fall Apart and set in Nigeria, The Joys of Motherhood offers a portrait of marriage and daily maternal life that is simultaneously specific to a time, culture and place – but also, in its forensic detailing of poverty and hunger (the tortured calculations of budget; the counting of every grain of rice…), feels universal.\n\n… Elsewhere, Marie Jalowicz Simon’s Underground in Berlin (Profile) is the memoir of a young Jewish woman who lived in plain sight in Berlin from 1942 to 1945. Brutally unsentimental, miraculously optimistic, it contains – when, homeless and walking the streets one night, Marie happens across the front door of a high-ranking Nazi officer – one of the greatest Fuck-Yous in literature I’ve ever read.\n\n14 December: Jarred McGinnis.\n\nWE RECENTLY MOVED TO FRANCE and so I’ve been catching up on contemporary and not-so contemporary French fiction. I spent most of this year banging on about the wonders of Annie Ernaux’s clean, directness of Simple Passion and The Years. I particularly like that her species of ‘autofiction’ avoids the stifling solipsism that I’ve struggled with in the work of other practitioners of the form. Sadly, my French is still at the Lucky Luck level of comprehension so I read it in English.\n\nThis year has a bumper crop of people that I have worked with at some point as part of Spread the Word’s London Writers Award. It is such a pleasure to see their works from seeing them among the slush to seeing them on bookshelves or feted by awards. 2021 was another turkey but at least the world got to read Sara Jafari’s Mismatch, Natasha Brown’s Assembly and Liam Konemann’s The Appendix. He’s got a novel out next year too, which is a bit show-offy if you ask me. Tice Cin’s Keeping the House came out too. I’ve already got a quid on her book for next year’s Goldsmiths Prize.\n\nFilm-wise, it’s la Française again with the work of Céline Sciamma and her most recent film Petite Maman. I’m a sucker for film makers who can make our everyday lives as thrilling and as strange on a budget that Ridley Scott sets aside for armour polish. It’s a relatively short film about being a kid. That’s it and it’s the most beautiful film I’ve watched in a long time.\n\n15 December: David Collard.\n\nI HAVEN’T BEEN OUT MUCH SINCE MARCH 2020 and most of my cultural highlights this year came from nearly 300 marvellous writers and performers taking part in Carthorse Orchestra, the online gathering I organised during lockdown as a necessary distraction from the government’s clusterfuck handling of the pandemic.\n\nAmong the fifty or so books featured were Seed by Joanna Walsh, Sterling Karat Gold by Isobel Waidner (winner of this year’s Goldsmith’s Prize), Pupa by J O Morgan, Panenka by Rónán Hession, Three Graves by Sean Gregory and (from Norwich’s finest indie), Lucy Ellmann’s Things Are Against Us and James Clammer’s Insignificance. That leaves another 43 or so, all of them highlights and all recommended. One that I keep returning to is Simple Annals by Roy Watkins, an astonishingly vivid memoir of early infancy. Details of all books on my website.\n\nPhilip Glass’s opera Akhenaten directed by Phelim McDermott and beamed online from the New York Met was every bit as wonderful and absorbing as the live performance I saw at the ENO in London a hundred years ago. I listened a lot to the consoling Georgian harmonies of the gorgeous Trio Mandili and to Wet Leg’s magnificent debut single Chaise Longue: ‘Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?’\n\nI never watch much telly, but have become addicted to the Channel 4 comedy Stath Lets Flats, now in its third series. Created and co-written by Jamie Demetriou who stars as an inept Greek letting agent in North London, it’s hilarious and touching by turns, with a sweet innocence beneath the humiliating pratfalls and surreal malapropisms.\n\nAnd speaking (as Sam did) of Dickens: we had a regular family reading of Nicholas Nickleby after supper for several months, and I choked up and fell apart at the death of Smyke, to the heartless amusement of all.\n\n16 December: Isha Karki.\n\nI WANTED TO READ A SHORT STORY A DAY, so my year has been shaped by them. I spent time in Mariana Enriquez’s unsettling Dangers of Smoking in Bed, in the raw intimate moments of Brandon Taylor’s Filthy Animals, in the Filipino magic and folklore of Isabel Yap’s Never Have I Ever. Some stories stayed with me: R Z Baschir’s visceral and electric ‘The Chicken’; C. L. Clark’s ‘You Perfect Broken Thing’, its breathless sketch of degenerative bodies, medical capitalism, and community; Isabel J. Kim’s ‘Homecoming is Just Another Word for the Sublimation of the Self’, a stunning weave of alternate history, myth-making, and fractured immigrant identities; Fargo Tbakhi’s ‘Root Rot’, a punch to the throat kind of story, a voice and settler violence that is relentless, harrowing. Recently, I picked up Nana Nkweti’s Walking on Cowrie Shells: riotous and unapologetic, genre-spanning, a range that encourages playfulness in writing.\n\nI crave the immersion of epic fantasy, and this year I gulped down The Poppy War trilogy by R. F. Kuang, which draws on the second Sino-Japanese war, China’s imperialist history, and is unflinching, full of complex rage. Outside of fiction, I read Carmen Maria Machado’s In the Dream House twice, in awe of its use of forms and genres, its parsing of trauma in sharp haunting ways. Nimmi Gowrinathan’s Radicalizing Her: Why Women Choose Violence offered a beautifully written cross-border glimpse of female fighters. I am dipping into Katherine Angel’s Tomorrow Sex Will Be Good Again, a meditation on sex and selfhood, vulnerability and desire, as well as Lucia Osborne-Crowley’s exploration of shame and the body in My Body Keeps Your Secret, and I feel things shifting as I read.\n\nRomance K-dramas have been a true comfort, with their centring of tender relationships; recently, Crash Landing On You offered an abundance of warmth and humour. This summer, I had the opportunity to go to a Moniack Mhor retreat; being still and moving through the winding roads and forest trails nearby was replenishing. The standout event this year was FiyahCon, a model of inclusive community building, insightful and interrogative conversations which inspired and nourished. Alongside Matthew Salesses’ Craft In the Real World (excerpted here), FiyahCon fed my thoughts around expanding internalised ideas of craft and engaging in subversive reading and writing. I am glad to come across publishers like Hajar Press and Indigo Press who are doing exactly this expanding work.\n\n17 December: Sam Mills.\n\nBEAR BY MARIAN ENGEL WAS THE MOST ENJOYABLE BOOK I’VE READ THIS YEAR: a love affair between a female librarian and a bear that is surprising, sexy, gross, moving and manages to avoid ever being sentimental or indulging in anthropomorphism. I was excited to see Rachel Ingalls’ Mrs Caliban being republished by Faber, having treasured this book for some years. I’d recommend her short story collection Days Like Today, which also deserves a reissue. Dan Rhodes’ Sour Grapes (Lightning Books) was hilarious; James Clammer’s Insignificance (Galley Beggar) was a modernist gem; and the best story collection of 2021 was Ben Pester’s Am I in the Right Place? (Boiler House Press). I was fortunate enough to read the (unpublished) stories of Theodore Stravinsky, who explores spiritual ideas with the flare of Hesse, an author whom I predict will one day be a star. At the cinema, I was so moved by The Father that I felt sad and raw for a few days after watching – it captures not just the agony of dementia but the strains and pressures of being a carer, a subject close to my heart. The Servant (1963) is one of my favourite films, but until this summer I’d never seen it on the big screen before. A superb satire on the rich and poor that explores a master-servant relationship, it is in some respects a precursor to Parasite. I hardly ever listen to music, but for research for my next non-fiction book I am enjoying sifting through David Bowie’s works of genius – Hunky Dory, Low, Scary Monsters - and rewatching his films, of which Labyrinth remains a favourite.\n\n18 December: Anthony Trevelyan.\n\nHELEN McCLORY HAS BEEN DOING SUPERLATIVE WORK FOR A WHILE NOW (The Goldblum Variations is, for my money, a stone-cold masterpiece), and she did it again this year with Bitterhall (Polygon), a novel so strange and beautiful and miraculously and entirely itself as to defy categorisation. A discovery for me was Ben Hopkins and Cathedral (Europa Editions) – a book that gives me the continuous confounding sensation that it might be one of the best things I’ve ever read (but… that surely can’t be right, can it? Unless…). Matt Berry must be getting cheesed off with being described as ‘TV’s funny man’ because plainly that’s all nonsense and what he really is is a musical genius who in May released one of the best albums you’ll ever hear (The Blue Elephant, Acid Jazz), which, along with his Phantom Birds (2020), Kill the Wolf (2013) and Witchazel (2011), gives you four of the best albums you’ll ever hear. Not content with merely being brilliant on television, Sathnam Sanghera also published Empireland: How Imperialism Has Shaped Modern Britain (Penguin), a somehow immaculately sane book on a completely insane subject. And I doubt 2021 had a better treat for us pop-culture wonks than William Shakespeare’s Avengers: The Complete Works (Quirk Books), Ian Doescher’s reimagining of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the manner and metre of the bard, and a properly gorgeous hardback illustrated by Danny Schlitz. Oh, and I re-read Lawrence Durrell’s Justine. Absolutely crackers, isn’t it? But full to the brim with a kind of filthy joy which for some reason hit the spot with me this year. Still mad, though. Absolutely tapped.\n\n19 December: Vijay Khurana.\n\nI LISTENED TO A LOT OF JAZZ IN 2021, thank god. A brilliant new album that I think perfectly reflects the year’s unease is Uneasy by Vijay Iyer, Linda May Han Oh and Tyshawn Sorey. I was also lucky enough to see percussionist Tyshawn Sorey perform in Philadelphia, the first live music I had seen in you-know-exactly-how-long, and worthy of the wait. I loved Diane Williams’s latest collection of stories, How High? – That High. Kobo Abe’s novel The Woman in the Dunes, translated by E. Dale Saunders, is a wonderfully claustrophobic and disturbing book, as well as a meditation on sand as a nexus of matter, time and motion. I enjoyed Austerlitz by “Mr Sebaldian himself”, my third Sebald and probably the most addictive reading experience I had this year. Thanks in part to this essay by Ryan Ruby, I read and reread the poetry of Rosemarie Waldrop, who deals mainly in prose-poems. Her selected poems is called Gap Gardening, a technique in which, as Ryan puts it, “the jagged right margin of verse is relocated to the heart of the sentence itself”. Waldrop also published a new collection this year, The Nick of Time. For the last four months I’ve been living near a cinema that shows old films, truly a joy. A highlight was the early Wim Wenders road movie Alice in the Cities, which brings together Philip, a rudderless German journalist, and Alice, a nine-year-old girl who gets separated from her mother.\n\n20 December: James Clammer.\n\nEVERY YEAR I KEEP A DIARY OF THE BOOKS I’ve got through and now, looking back, I see that I've read only two published in this calendar year of 2021. (They were both excellent and I’ve picked them for a BOTY feature run by Lunate magazine). I haven’t been to any exhibitions, seen any films, watched any TV programmes and the only music I’ve listened to has been classical or The Beatles. What have I been doing?! Old books lead to older books: my best discovery this year has been the work of the Austrian psychoanalyst Otto Rank (also a touchstone for Anaїs Nin) via Ernest Becker’s incredible 1973 book Escape From Evil (Simon & Schuster). Freud I’ve always found too reductionist, Jung too diffuse; Otto Rank’s warm-heartedness and emphasis on creativity has been as exciting as it was unexpected.\n\nThe real highlight for me of this year was the England men’s football team very nearly winning the European Championship. So nearly! (I hate patriotism but I've been following them since childhood and probably won’t ever stop now.) They played some superb football. More than that – their insistence on taking the knee and speaking out against racism was the most inspiring moment of the last twelve months. The fact that they also made the Tories and other right-wing moaners look like a bunch of dimwits was a secondary, though no less pleasing, outcome.\n\n21 December: Lara Pawson.\n\nMY YEAR HAS BEEN TOPPED AND ALMOST TAILED WITH COLLAGE. At the start, I signed up to Morbid Anatomy's four-week art course, The Archaeology of the Self, taught by the sculptor, Eleanor Crook. I learned so much, I filled many pages of my new black notebook with fabulous quotations such as this, from Max Ernst: “The collage technique is the systematic exploitation of the accidentally or artificially provoked encounter of two or more foreign realities on a seemingly incongruous level – and the spark of poetry that leaps across the gap as these two realities are brought together.” I was delighted to discover, at Tate Britain's Paula Rego retrospective at the end of October, that she began her artistic life doing lots of collage. That I have spent so much of this year thinking about chance encounters, synchronicity and the freedom of experiment must be why I so happily disappeared into the world of David Keenan. Across the summer, I read four of his novels and came up panting, blinking and just about still smiling, on the final page of Monument Maker. In my increasingly desperate attempt to find tools to understand the contemporary world against the backdrop of colonialism, capitalism and catastrophic climate change, I reached, yet again, for the words of Achille Mbembe. Out of the Dark Night finally came out in English in May, having been available in French since 2010. I found further enlightenment and even hope in Nuzhat Bukhari's extraordinary debut poetry collection, Brilliant Corners, which I've kept by my side the whole year – as one with faith might cling to a prayer book. Other major highlights include: Diane Williams’ annual delight, NOON (confession: I have a piece of work in it); Forced Entertainment's brave online performance, How The Time Goes; every issue of the New York Review of Books; Karla Black’s understated but, for me, emotionally powerful exhibition, sculptures (2001-2021), at Edinburgh's Fruitmarket Gallery; and Abe Odedina's exhibition Cutting Edge at 20 Clerkenwell Green, London. Alongside all of this, as in previous years, I have fed myself on the almost formidable Ubuweb for deeper knowledge and ferocious amounts of inspiration. Two outstanding highlights this year were Francis Bacon and the Brutality of Fact and The Theatre of Tadeusz Kantor, both – oh my goodness, more synchronicity here – made in 1985.\n\n22 December: Toby Lichtig.\n\nIT’S BEEN AN EXCELLENT YEAR FOR FICTION, something partly reflected by this year’s Booker Prize. Damon Galgut’s The Promise was an entirely worthy winner: a brilliant, brutal and often sardonically funny episodic snapshot of South Africa over three decades and four funerals through the lens of one screwed up white family in Pretoria.\n\nAlso on the Booker shortlist, I enjoyed Richard Powers’s Bewilderment, which focuses on a father-son relationship in an America riven by authoritarian politics and ecological degradation. Some critics seemed to find it a tad schematic and wantonly packed with astrobiological research. I found it powerful, tender and hugely imaginative. Another shortlist companion, Patricia Lockwood’s debut No One Is Talking About This, was an extraordinary achievement: the novel about social media we’ve all been waiting for.\n\nIt was also good to see Kazuo Ishiguro’s Klara and the Sun make the longlist. Ishiguro took a big risk in allowing a robot to narrate his novel – and it paid off. In some way, a bright and slighty faulty automaton is the ultimate Ishiguro character. This was his best book in a quarter of a century – since the peerless The Unconsoled – and I’d wager that it will be one of the novels he’ll eventually be best remembered for.\n\nOn the subject of globally famous, ageing male novelists with anxieties about their best books being behind them, I thought Jonathan Franzen’s Crossroads was utterly brilliant: the first instalment in a mouthwatering trilogy about the Hildebrandt family, set over a few months in the early 1970s. The novel opens, festively enough, just before Christmas 1971, with the family’s patriarch, Russ, a Christian minister, planning to celebrate the life of Christ by embarking on an affair; his four teenage children are all having their own various crises; and his wife is trying to hold things together while exorcising ghosts of her own. Cue much angst and hilarity. There’s also quite a lot here about faith, faithlessness and the Christian church, which puts an interesting slant on the Franzen moral universe. This is his best book since The Corrections, over twenty years ago, and I cannot wait for parts two and three.\n\nPrize lists are inherently contingent and reductive. Personal favourites always get left off. But the way in which Gwendoline Riley’s My Phantoms seems to have been ignored by this year’s major prize juries seems perverse. Riley is one of this country’s most talented novelists, and My Phantoms sees Riley writing at very peak of her observational powers. It is an icy, hilarious, mercilessly precise evocation of a very difficult mother-daughter relationship (Riley’s perennial theme), with the odd disarming splinter of warmth.\n\nI was particularly excited by two debut novelists this year: Raven Leilani’s Luster is an acerbic and linguistically playful study of a young Black woman trying to make her way in a racist, sexist, capitalist America. Natasha Brown’s Assembly is an acerbic and linguistically poised study of a young Black woman trying to make her way in a racist, sexist, capitalist Britain. Tonally, the books are very different, as are their narrators. Both authors are huge talents.\n\nIn terms of rediscoveries, I hugely enjoyed Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz’s The Passenger, a novel that first appeared in 1939, subsequently got reversioned and then sunk without a trace. It was rescued by the German publisher Peter Graf a few years ago and has now been translated into English. Written in the immediate aftermath of Kristallnacht, it features a German Jewish businessman on the run. Having realised he’s safest in transit, he spends a terrified – and often absurdist – few days criss-crossing the country on the nation’s trains. It’s a marvellous novel. Boschwitz died at sea in 1942 aged twenty-seven and would likely have gone on to have a stellar literary career.\n\nI’ve read less non-fiction this year. I was, however, completely immersed by David Graeber and David Wengrow’s The Dawn of Everything. A new deep history that has already become a classic, it seeks to overturn the myths of noble savagery and the birth of formal hierarchies in agrarian societies by massively complicating the picture. The short take is that humans have for tens of thousands of years organised themselves in utterly multifarious and overlapping ways. The chief conclusion of this is that there is thus nothing inevitable about the way we organise ourselves today.\n\nElsewhere on the culture front, there was Lee Isaac Chung’s charming film Minari, featuring a Korean American family in 1980s Arkansas; and the sensory pleasures of going to the cinema to see Denis Villeneuve’s stunning remake of Dune. And, like everyone else, I’ve been completely sucked in by Season Three of Succession.\n\nI’ve hugely enjoyed a cautious return to gigs in 2021. Acid Arab at the Jazz Café got things started for me over the summer: a raucous blend of acid house, techno and influences from North African and the Levant.\n\nEnd of the Road Festival was a real highlight: three days of gorgeous weather and a stellar line up, much of which I missed due to having small children. But the ever bouncy Hot Chip and the ever spittle-flecked Sleaford Mods did exactly what they were meant to do. Suede, who finally appeared at Alexander Palace after a delay of eighteen months, treated us to a run through of their classic album Coming Up, followed by a second half of assorted greatest hits. Bret Anderson is ageing with a Bowie-esque grace – and a Jagger-esque verve.\n\nEmboldened by my recent booster shot, I recently went to see Jane Fitz and Carl H play an epic all-night set at Studio 9294 in Hackney Wick: six hours of absolutely banging and often very trippy techno to keep everyone dancing like it was 2019.\n\n23 DECEMBER: Catherine Taylor.\n\nI’VE SPENT MOST OF THIS YEAR DREAMING ABOUT and writing my 1970s’ and 80s-set memoir The Stirrings (to be published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in early 2023) but have still managed to find time to read an awful lot of books. From the long - Olga Tokarczuk's wholly immersive historical epic The Books of Jacob (Fitzcarraldo), superbly translated from Polish by Jennifer Croft, is a work of pure delight of both storytelling and scholarship, with a painful resonance that hits the mark in these deeply troubled, polarised times - to the short and bittersweet: Souvenir, Michael Bracewell's memoir/prose montage of late 70s and early 80s' London (White Rabbit Books) which reads like the written equivalent of one of my very favourite films of that era, Chris Petit's monochrome, downbeat road movieRadio On (1979). Thanks to BFI Player, I've watched it countless times this year, along with other important ‘research’. A couple of other books I must shout about, rescued from the archives: Faber’s (under Ella Griffths’ curatorship) reissue of Beryl Gilroy’s seminal and non-sentimental memoir Black Teacher, from 1976, and Norah Lange's exquisitely compressed, surrealNotes from Childhood (And Other Stories) rediscovered and translated from Spanish by Charlotte Whittle, set in Argentina at the turn of the 20th century. Via Mubi, it has given me huge pleasure to discover the films of the Hungarian feminist director Márta Mészarós, and catch up on some Agnes Varda which I’ve never seen - her hour-length Documenteur, about a woman negotiating life as a single mother in a new country, is intense and fresh, even though it was made forty years ago in 1981.\n\nIt was wonderful to get back to art this summer - Paula Rego's defiant, huge canvases at Tate Britain and Tracey Emin's intimate, bold work, beautifully paired with Edvard Munch, at the Royal Academy, were standouts. On a smaller scale size-wise, but hugely important to the bigger picture, was the British Library's exhibition ‘Unfinished Business, the Fight for Women’s Rights’ - intersectional and inclusive.\n\nDespite my mixed background I will always be a Sheffielder at heart - and South Yorkshire's Rebecca Lucy Taylor (aka Self Esteem) brought out what is for me the album of the year - Prioritise Pleasure. Her song ‘I Do This All The Time’ has been in my head constantly over the last few months. But over Christmas it's going to be the classics: Dickens’sThe Mystery of Edwin Drood, which I've never read, and the Cocteau Twins’ shimmering bauble of an album,Treasure, which I've listened to every December since it came out in 1984.\n\n24 December: Jessica Craig and Lori Feathers.\n\nJESSICA CRAIG:\n\nAFTER TWO YEARS OF LIVING REMOTELY, returning in Autumn 2022 to live cultural events felt euphoric and even miraculous. In my first trip to England since 2019 I celebrated in-person the launch of the trail-blazing debut novel In Every Mirror She’s Black by Lola Ákínmádé Åkerström (Head of Zeus), at the opening day of Afrori Books, the first black-owned bookshop in Sussex. Nor is there is any satisfying virtual replacement for gazing into the colour and brushstrokes of Rothko’s rarely-seen, paper-based paintings, 1968: Clearing Away at the Pace Gallery. Nor will I ever forget my only live music gig of the past two years, at a corner bar in New Haven, CT, and being blown away by the searing voice of Chris Pierce whose 2021 album American Silence addresses racism and injustice as soulfully as singer-songwriters I keep reaching for from the late 1960s and early 70s. I wondered if I’d ever again attend a Broadway show, but in one week in NYC two sent my spirits soaring: David Byrne’s American Utopia and Anaïs Mitchell’s Hadestown. Anaïs Mitchell is the entrancing, hopeful voice I most replayed this year – especially new songs ‘Phoenix’ and ‘Latter Days’, with Big Red Machine. Her new album will be one of the first I listen to in January 2022. Now back in isolation for the winter, I recommend exploring Alexander, the new non-fiction storytelling app for iphone or android, favorites are ‘Journey To a Man Called Chuma’ written by Tsitsi Dangarembga and read by Thuso Mbedu, and ‘Woman on A Motorcycle’ by Jeet Thayil and read by John Malkovich. The books I most enjoyed in 2021 transported me into new and nuanced ways of seeing places, people and histories: Patsy by Nicole Dennis-Benn, Lote by Shola von Reinhold, The Mermaid of Black Conch by Monique Roffey, The Secret Lives of Church Ladies by Deesha Philyaw, The Yellow House by Sarah M. Broom, A Most Remarkable Creature by Jonathan Meiburg, and The Dispossessed by John Washington.\n\nLORI FEATHERS:"
