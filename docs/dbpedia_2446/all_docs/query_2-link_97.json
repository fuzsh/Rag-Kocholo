        "text": "This paper claims that Maltese contemporary art lacks a subversive voice and that Valletta 2018 has led to the ultimate dissolution of this possibility. With a focus on the plastic and visual arts, this paper will attempt to illustrate how Maltese artworks lack the power to create subversion and political dissension. Although there are artists and individual works of art that attempt or have attempted to materialise the subversive, the general positioning of Maltese art places it in a lacuna that effectively negates the possibility of subversion and dissent. As stated by Rancière, “An artist can be committed, but what does it mean to say that his art is committed? Commitment is not a category of art.” (2004, p.56) Due to this, there is a general lack of political debate within the contemporary artistic discourse which succeeds in removing any sense of rupture from the dominant socio-political status quo. Contemporary Maltese art lacks a sense of meaning and reference to the world to such a degree that the same work of art can be repurposed to mean whatever state institutions want it to mean. The sculpture, ‘Flame that Never Dies’, designed by Valerio Schembri and inaugurated in 2017 was originally intended to represent a memorial flame for the late prime minister of Malta, Dominic Mintoff. In a sleight of hand the title of the work was changed and a new meaning given, therefore showing that this specific sculpture has no reference to the world and thus no real meaning. When meaning and reference are removed all possibilities of subversion are also removed. For art to be subversive and oppositional it requires a target, and the current liberal, capitalist and libertarian socio-political paradigm with its ability to accept everything has removed the possibility for art to be oppositional and to have a subversive dimension. The removal of censorship laws and constant waving of freedom of expression for all has removed the ability for art to be considered as radical or subversive, thus removing the power to force the institutions to respond to them in a confrontational manner that uncovers their true colours. Furthermore, the designation of Valletta as European City of Culture for 2018 has allowed for the final elimination of the power of art. Baudrillard argues that art as a powerful and moving activity has gone; since art is everywhere and art is everything, then art has become nothing. Through Valletta 2018, the State institutions have successfully coalesced even mundane activities under the definition of art; and by also utilising the contractual control provided by financing artistic works, most contemporary art has been reduced to being meaningless and powerless because ‘there is nothing to see.’ (Baudrillard, 2009, p.18) Contemporary Maltese Art has no teeth to bite with and has lost its power of discourse by allowing all meaning and reference to be taken away from it. If the art world still wants to be relevant and meaningful it has to reinvent itself by creating a meaningful metaphorical language that can be communicated and understood by the public.\n\nThe year 1591 saw the birth of two artists who have become household names in the field of Seicento studies: Giovanni Francesco Barbieri (d. 1666), nicknamed Guercino—the little squinter—born in the small town of Cento in northern Italy; and Jusepe de Ribera (d. 1652), nicknamed Lo Spagnoletto—the little Spaniard—born in the small town of Játiva near Valencia. Revered in their own time, the reputations of Guercino and Ribera fell dramatically in the eyes of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century critics, only to experience a complete reappraisal from the mid-twentieth century onwards: Guercino, largely through the distinguished scholarship of Sir Denis Mahon and Nicholas Turner; Ribera, by virtue of major exhibitions in Europe and North America. The work of these artists continues to prompt scholarly attention and debate. Though often the subject of individual monographic studies, Guercino and Ribera have rarely been examined together, a curious lacuna considering the many parallels in their works on paper. Taking as its focus the drawings of violent subjects that permeate the graphic production of these exact contemporaries, this essay will endeavour to reveal what a comparative study of Guercino and Ribera can teach us not only about their distinct bodies of work, but also about their diverse approaches towards drawing the body in pain."
