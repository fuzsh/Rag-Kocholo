        "text": "December 5, 2023\n\nDark Harvest by David J Gatward\n\nDark Harvest by David J Gatward is book 16 in the DCI Harry Grimm crime thrillers series and it is an excellent read. The book centres on a missing young married couple, who have also won the lottery.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I also enjoyed reading about Harry and his police team and how they work together with every new crime that confronts them.\n\nHighly recommended\n\nApril 7, 2024\n\nBook 16 in the Harry Grimm series is a treat a minute.\n\nI adore Grimm and his crew, have read the series in order and it is great following all the characters and how they and their lives develop.\n\nDavid J Gatward writes engaging and well-developed stories.\n\nThis book centres around a young couple who have won the lottery and become famous. They are going off the beaten track travelling when they disappear. The story takes you on quite a journey with Grimm and his team working against the clock to find them.\n\nReally great read, highly recommend the series.\n\nHappy Reading.\n\nMay 19, 2024\n\nDark Harvest is book 16 in the DCI Harry Grimm series by David J. Gatward. Constable Jadyn Osk called DCI Harry Grimm to an abandoned Campervan in an isolated area of the Yorkshire Dales. When DCI Harry Grimm realised the owners, two young newlyweds, were missing, it became a race to find them. Will this case cause DCI Harry Grimm to lose one of his teams? The readers of Dark Harvest will continue to follow DCI Harry Grimm to discover what happens.\n\nWhile reading this book, I remembered that I had to do my housework when I read the last page. I enjoyed how David J. Gatward takes me on a journey with his characters, which helps me engage with his stories, and Dark Harvest did not disappoint. I love David J. Gatward's portrayal of his characters and how they interact throughout this book. Dark Harvest is well-written and researched. I like David J. Gatward's description of the settings of Dark Harvest, which allowed me to imagine being part of the book's plot.\n\nDark Harvest readers will understand the role of a Media liaison officer in law enforcement and the pros and cons of social media in law enforcement investigations.\n\nI recommend this book.\n\nDecember 9, 2023\n\nAbout Grimm\n\nThis is just another great story from Gatward,,I have read hundreds of books ,I have at least ten favorite authors,, I added David J Gatward after reading book two ,I fell in love with Harry Grimm ,and all his crew of officers! Every book is written well, keeps you wanting o read more! I recommend you start with book one and you will be hooked too! Happy reading ,really good stories,each one of his books.\n\nDecember 12, 2023\n\nI listened to the audible version of this book.\n\nAnother brilliant episode in this outstanding series. Great characters and a well developed story which keeps the listener on the edge of their seat. Aubrey Parsons once again excels with his narration. Highly Recommended.\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\ni normally like this series, but I felt this plot and the overall writing were below par for Gatward. The detectives seemed to be brain dead, and the plot was (IMHO) too farfetched.\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\n\nLike the title suggests, this book was “ darker “ than the others in this fine series. It was not the best that this author has to offer. The story itself was a little far fetched and not that interesting to me. Hope for a better one to come .\n\nDecember 23, 2023\n\nSpoilers!!\n\nSpoilers - I really enjoy this series but this book was just OK. Good story but when someone in the town/area appears so many times during the story, you just know that they’re involved somehow. There were also other little clues that were easy to pick up on which pointed you in the direction of who was involved in the kidnapping of the married couple. Also, there was an issue with the camper van that the married couple was using and where they found it and how poorly it was set up. Once it became obvious that it was moved to that location, it should not have taken Grimm very long to figure out that someone was trying to steer them away from where it was previously. Anyway, this book was not even close to the best one in the series. Nevertheless, I will get the next one when it comes out. The story was enjoyable, but predictable.\n\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\nThis is an amazing series. Some books a bit better or worse than others but all worth the read!\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nIn terms of suspense, this is one of the better novels in the series and also probably the darkest entry thus far, albeit certainly not the most believable one. The plot itself is mostly intriguing, mainly because the usual Wensleydale adoration takes a backseat while the focus is firmly on the case of a young celebrity couple having gone missing.\n\nSadly, the ending is somewhat disappointing. While the solutions to some of the previous cases were often very much on the nose, leading to the reader being way ahead of Harry and his team, this time it's the other way around. The solution comes out of nowhere, is frankly quite silly and barely has anything to do with the rest of the plot, making the culprit and what's actually going on impossible to guess. So, the kidnappers/killers turn out to be a guy who appeared in passing maybe for a couple of paragraphs in the middle of the novel and his geriatric dad who had formed a two man Viking murder cult? Come on!\n\nGatward also repeats some of the little annoyances of previous novels. There's a lot of grumbling about journalists, although this time around, Harry at least tries to work together with one. And as much as I like the members of Harry's team: If I were the lead investigator in a missing persons case and my subordinates started a guessing game or flatout refused to give me a straight answer (\"You'll have to see for yourself...\") every time I was asking for an update on what might very well be vital information, I would move said subordinates to traffic duty or see them removed from the force post haste.\n\nThat being said, despite some grievances, this was still a somewhat entertaining thriller, although the fact that David J. Gatward has written 16 novels within less than four years is beginning to show, and not in a good way.\n\nDecember 2, 2023\n\nnot his best\n\nThis book gives the phrase “ jumping the shark “ new life. Please go back to believable plots. I love Harry but not torture and cult plot lines.\n\nDecember 1, 2023\n\nDark Harvest\n\nExcellent, well written story with sympathetic characters and a believable plot.\n\nThe constant heavy rain underscores the darkness of the search for a missing couple who had recently won the lottery for several million dollars. It is, however, more than merely a kidnapping, brutal as it is. The story ties in love of the countryside with the twisted machinations of those who go too far in their worship of pagan rituals., and a belief that past events, no matter how long ago, can be usefully applied to the present. Madness, of course, but very carefully concealed madness, which gives the ending of the story an unexpected twist.\n\nStrongly recommended for fans of well written detective fiction.\n\nJanuary 22, 2024\n\nAs always mr gatward never lets you down, been reading his books after reading jd kirks & alex smith all brill authors. Sorry back to this book as always takes you through every emotion its another fantastic read if you like crime books you most certainly wont be dissapointed, this book along with all his previous books are fantastic, books once you start reading cant put down. Grimm up North is his first book read it 1st and i promise you all you will be dying to read the next book and the rest. Brill characters great sense of humour DCI Grimm books are books you'll want to read & read again. Enjoy..\n\nJanuary 10, 2024\n\nThis was another great addition to the DCI Grimm series. The pacing was a little slower than others in the series but that was fine. The main characters, that I've come to love and welcome into my home/mind, are on form and work wonderfully together. In a series this extensive it feels as though we are on a journey through key transitions; several characters are transitioning out while others are now playing larger roles. While I am invested in many characters this does helps to keep the series fresh. I am looking forward to reading where David Gatward takes me next.\n\nDecember 9, 2023\n\nTour de Force\n\nA grim and dark winter's tale indeed. A missing young couple in proper Yorkshire rainy weather and the team racing around trying to make sense of any clues to where they might be and who might be responsible for their disappearance. Grimm himself is facing a crossroads in his relationship and things seem bleak indeed. As usual, a terrific installment in this series.\n\nJanuary 23, 2024\n\n3.5 David Gatward's DCI Harry Grimm books are among my very favorites. While I can't deny being completely involved in this one as well, there were a number of times that I felt as if I should be giving advice to the team as they appeared to overlook things that should have clued them in. The conclusion was a bit weird, as well.\n\nIt won't matter that one book in this long series didn't work as well for me because I love the characters and the setting.\n\nJuly 4, 2024\n\nReading the Grimm series is like kicking back with a cold Pimms Cup....delightful. Two social media darlings are missing in the Dales. Their camper is there, but something's not right especially the weather which is raining nearly the whole story...Harry and the team will have to work through lots of issues to solve this one....and of course there is the personal stories which keep developing...love the series.\n\nDecember 2, 2023\n\nanother great Yorkshire tale\n\nOnce again the characters and locations become real. The author’s skill at describing not only the locations and atmosphere but also the character’s thoughts without loosing pace is seamless. A great read, I hope it’s not too long to wait until the next book comes along.\n\nDecember 3, 2023\n\nbrilliant series\n\nRead from book one you will fall in love with the characters, the drama, suspense and great descriptions of the dales. Now I have a yearning to visit that part of England. To add to the places we have visited on our two memorable trips there. I-love England and Scotland. Wish I had bern born there.\n\nDecember 5, 2023\n\nSIMPLY SUPERB!\n\nAwe Dave you have smashed it yet again with your latest instalment of DCI Harry Grimm series. For me Dark Harvest is up there as one of my favourite. Fabulous story, lots of laugh out loud moments and a terrific conclusion. Keep 'em coming Dave, I just love to escape for a few hours and place myself in the Dales. Outstanding, thank you. BP Sheffield\n\nDecember 9, 2023\n\nThis series keeps on giving! Wonderful story in a beautiful setting and with deeper insights into some of the leading characters, not to mention dry and wry humour. If you haven't read any Harry Grimm books start with no. 1 and follow his arrival into the Dales and how he develops. You won't regret it.\n\nJulian Tremayne, Pocklington, East Yorkshire\n\nDecember 15, 2023\n\nTotally Will Keep You On Edge\n\nI have enjoyed every single Harry Grimm book written so far. The one where Jadyn is targeted by stupid racists almost had me in tears. But this one had me on the edge of my seat. There are puzzles and twists galore, and just when you think you know what’s happening, you’ll be wrong.\n\nDecember 29, 2023\n\nGood read\n\nDark Harvest is an interesting story with the usual well-developed characters readers of the DCI Harry Grimm series expect: thorough investigators, loyal, intelligent and hard working friends with a goid sense if humor. It also paints a lovely picture of Wensleydale. A truest enjoyable read with twists a turns of a goid plot\n\nDecember 29, 2023\n\nReading a DCI Harry Grimm book is like meeting with old friends. The team are so dear to my heart, by now, I actually miss them when a book finishes.\n\nThe plot is well developed, as usual, and again, there's a theme of contemporary interest in it.\n\nAs always, a very enjoyable read. And the wait doe the next instalment begins.\n\nJanuary 4, 2024\n\ndark harvest\n\nFinally caught up with this series. Now bereft, as only one book left before I have to wait awhile. Harry and his fabulous team have to find a young missing couple. The young couple are famous, so the search is hindered by fans and the media. A great read that will keep you reading into the early hours and loving every minute.\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\nDC Ryan doing what he does best!\n\nFantastic latest effort in this wonderful\n\ndescriptive, engaging, thrilling and Dale's set crime fiction. David Gateward has such a wonderful descriptive style that you can feel yourself seeing events unfold first hand. Can't wait for the next. Yorkshire rain is the best!\n\nMarch 31, 2024\n\nReally enjoyed this book but I have one nit picky complaint. It is possible I noticed this because I listened to the audio book, but there is way too much repetition of the phrase or variations on \"doesn't make sense\". There are times it's said over and over to the point it kind of grated on me. Otherwise, though. It was a cool, well constructed story.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers."
