Thelma was predeceased by her parents, George and Louisa Hooper; by her husband Dr. Peter Collett; her brother George Samuel Gordon Hooper; Aunt Nellie Davies; and niece Linda OConner. She will be missed by her stepson Dr. Ronald (Marlene) Collett of Winnipeg; nieces, Beverly Anne (Ken) Loney and Georgina Louisa Harvey both of Tottenham, ON; cousins, Marilyn (Bob) Drain of Winnipeg, Winnie Parson of Atlanta, GA; grandnieces and nephew, Kathy (Bootland) (Greg) Stewart, Gordon (Chris) OConnor, Cindy (Ed) Mills, Connie Lagerquist, Cheryl (Steve) Heffernon, Christie (John) McRoberts; as well as many great-grandnieces and nephews. Thelma was born in Winnipeg and lived there until 1981. She was employed with the Department of National Defence for 31 years until her retirement in 1972. She was able to travel widely and had a lively interest in many areas. She was an avid reader and while she did not have children, she was keenly interested in following the activities of her extended family. Thelma married Peter in 1981 and moved to Penticton at that time. As her many friends will attest, she continued to be fiercely independent throughout her life. She will be remembered as a gracious and creative lady who led a full life. Friends were invited to The Concorde, 3235 Skaha Lake Rd., Penticton, on Friday, November 15 at 2:00 p.m. to share their thoughts and memories of Thelmas life. Funeral arrangements entrusted to HANSONS ARBOR VALLEY FUNERAL & CREMATION CENTRE - 492-4202.\n\nAs published in Winnipeg Free Press on Nov 16, 2002"
