        "text": "The birth of a club\n\nThe early days of Hitchin Town are clouded in mystery, but recent research has uncovered the actual day that the club’s formation was announced.\n\nThe Hertfordshire Express of Saturday November 25 1865 included an announcement that had been issued the previous day (November 24 1865):\n\n“A meeting of gentlemen convened by private circular, was held in the National School Room on Friday evening for the purpose of establishing a foot-ball club. Hubert Delme Radcliffe esq. presided and about 25 gentlemen were present.\n\nThe establishment of such a club was unanimously agreed to, the subscription to be two shillings and sixpence per annum, members to be admitted by ballot.\n\nHubert Delme Radcliffe was chose as president and the Rev.John Pardoe Secretary, a committee of five gentlemen were also appointed, and rules agreed to.\n\nThe president announced that F.P. Delme Radcliffe would allow the club to play the games in part of the park they chose to select, and also that his name might be put down for an honorary subscription of one guinea. It was arranged that the club should commence playing at the close of the cricket season in each year and continue to its opening, and to meet for play on Saturday afternoons at half-past two o’clock, the opening game to be played that day.”\n\nThe above announcement made barely a ripple in the newspaper, but it represents the earliest mention of organised football in the town.\n\nIn all probability, the early “games” were played among the members, possibly on Butts Close.\n\nThere is evidence that the club played on Hitchin Cricket Ground in the early 1870s, wherever that may have been, and also Dog Kennel Farm in Charlton.\n\nFrancis Shillitoe was Hitchin’s first captain. He was a keen rower and there is evidence that he was a coroner and later lived in Pirton Road at Foxholes.\n\n1867-68: The Wanderers come to town\n\nCompetitive games were few and far between, but every game was a challenge and there was no more competitive fixture than a visit from the Wanderers, who won the very first FA Cup final and lifted the cup a further four times. Here is a match report for a game played on February 20 1868, from the Pall Mall Gazette (21 February 1868):\n\n“This match was played at Hitchin yesterday, and resulted in a victory for thee Wanderers, who scored two goals to nothing. The toss was won by the Hitchin captain, who chose the upper goal with the wind. The superiority of the Wanderers soon became apparent, as the ball was flying about on all sides of the Hitchin posts which, after about half an hour’s play, surrendered to a kick by C.W Alcock.\n\n“With the wind and hill, the Wanderers immediately commenced once more to pen their opponents, who shortly afterwards witnessed the second overthrow of their goal, a good side kick by H.Emmanuel achieving this second goal. For the Wanderers W.Rigden and L.Ogden were most conspicuous, and Shillitoe did good service for Hitchin.”\n\nHitchin’s line-up that day was: F.Shillitoe (captain), Rev. J.B. Parker, W.Hill, W.O. Atkinson, G.Lewin, E.Logsdon, T.Mainwaring, F.Lucas, G.A. Passingham, L.Thompson (only 10, not listed in positions – Wanderers had just nine men). Report taken from London Gazette.\n\nSome highlights from 1871:\n\nOn January 21 1871, Hitchin won 1-0 at St.Albans.\n\nOn February 4 1871, at Hitchin Cricket Ground, the club won 8-0 against Ware, who were formed just a month earlier. The Herts Express was impressed at “the pluck and good temper which they [Ware] took their licking.”\n\nHitchin’s goals were scored by Hill, Bailey, Austin (2), Darton (2), Baker and Mainwaring.\n\nOn February 11 1871, Hitchin won at home to St.Albans. Goalscorer: “Mr Toke”\n\nSome highlights from 1872:\n\nOn September 5 1872, Hitchin held its AGM. The club had the grand sum of £ 1 17s 6d in the bank. Rev. John Pardoe was elected captain of the club with William Tindall Lucas the secretary.\n\nSpecial thanks were passed to Mr A.Ransom for the use of his field [which begs the question – did the club play at Ransom’s Rec?].\n\nThe opening game of the season would be Mr Jackson’s XI v Mr Mainwaring’s XI. These gentlemen were both committee members.\n\n1901-02: The first league season\n\nThe forerunner of the Hitchin Town FC we know today, Hitchin FC, did not play league fixtures until 1901-02. Prior to that, the club played friendlies and county cup competitions.\n\nIn the close season of 1901, the Hitchin committee decided that friendly games were no longer appetising to the public and the club made an application to join the London League. That league did not like the idea of a team as far north as Hitchin becoming part of their league, but the club was more successful in gaining admission to the South Eastern League, which looked a fairly attractive proposition with games against the second elevens of West Ham, Tottenham Hotspur and Millwall. Also in that summer, the club changed its colours from red and white to all white. At that time, the club’s headquarters were based at the Temperance Hotel in Bancroft, but by the end of the season, The Sun had been reinstated as the home base. As well as competing in the South Eastern League, Hitchin were also members of a new Herts League.\n\nHitchin found it hard going in the South Eastern League and suffered a run of defeats in the early stages of the season. Millwall won 1-0 at Top Field and Luton Town Reserves beat Hitchin 10-1. Captain W.J.Y Taylor was badly injured at Luton and as the club’s best forward, this was a considerable blow. The two senior Hitchin sides – Blue Cross Brigade were the other – met at Top Field and the game ended up a 1-1 draw. The crowd for this Herts League game was very disappointing, which led some people to ask what the club had to do to attract good attendances.\n\nBy the end of October, T.W. Barnes, a right half who had played for Luton, returned to the club as an “unpaid professional”. In the previous season, Hitchin had been admonished for fielding a footballer who was registered as a professional in the amateur game. Barnes was a fine player and one that had a keen eye for goal. His first game back with the club was a disaster, however, with Queens Park Rangers winning 9-0.\n\nHitchin made progress in the Hinchinbrooke Cup, beating Arlesey 3-0, but in the South Eastern League, they struggled against superior opposition. It was not until just after Christmas that they recorded their first win, a 3-1 success against St.Albans Amateurs. In the next round of the Hinchinbrooke Cup, Biggleswade were beaten after a replay, earning Hitchin a semi-final tie with Irthlingborough. At the start of December, Clapton Orient, a team that included future England centre forward George Hilsdon, were beaten 1-0, but a week later, a trip to Essex was not appreciated by the Hitchin players. The team arrived at Grays United with three players suffering from nausea after a bad train journey from London to Thurrock. The Hitchin officials were none too happy, claiming that they had not enjoyed “the uninviting home of the Essex club”.\n\nThe Hinchinbrooke Cup run ended for Hitchin at the semi-final stage, with Irthlingborough taking a two-goal lead before Taylor netted a later consolation. Hitchin were not to be denied some glory in 1901-02, however. After beating Stevenage in the semi-final of the Herts Charity Cup, they were due to meet St.Albans in the final at Welwyn. Taylor and W.Anderson gave Hitchin a 2-0 lead early on, and Hailey and Cannon scored the other goals in a 4-2 win against St.Albans Amateurs. There was a hint of crowd trouble at Welwyn as some irate St.Albans fans invaded the pitch. Hitchin, though, were easily the better team and few could complain at their victory.\n\nOn March 28, Hitchin played two games on the same day, one in the South Eastern League against Clapton Orient and another at Stevenage in the Herts League. Hitchin lost at Orient, 1-3 and beat their neighbours 5-0. In an intensive finale to the season, Tottenham visited Top Field the next day, winning 5-1. The Spurs went on to win the South Eastern League. Hitchin’s last win of the season in that competition was an 11-0 trouncing of Chesham Generals, with Taylor and Gurney scoring four apiece. Hitchin ended the campaign in eighth position in the 11-team league.\n\nBack in the Herts League, Hitchin remained unbeaten and won the Northern Section. They had to meet Watford Melrose, champions of the Southern Section in a title play-off. The game ended 1-1. The season’s top scorer was Taylor with 27 goals, with Anderson netting 22. At the end of the season, George Smith, one of the successes of the campaign, moved to Biggleswade.\n\n1905-06: Victory at Stamford Bridge\n\nHitchin Town were the first away team to win at Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge ground.\n\nThis forgotten landmark has been swept away from history, but it is true- the first Hitchin club, who by 1905 were known as Hitchin Town, won 3-2 at Chelsea in the South Eastern League on October 14 1905. It was Chelsea’s second eleven, but it was nevertheless a strong Chelsea side, with former Tottenham FA Cup winner Davie Copeland in the line-up. Hitchin’s team was a little makeshift, however, making the result even more impressive. Hitchin took the lead through Barker after 20 minutes but Copeland equalised for Chelsea and Harris gave the home side the lead. Barker’s long-range shot made it 2-2, and the winner came from Cannon after a “scrimmage” – the Edwardian term for a goalmouth scramble. Hitchin’s team on that memorable day was: Woodger, Smith, Allen, Stimpson, Cox, Ebden, Cannon, Grimes, Barker, Williams and Furr. A week later, Hitchin beat Chelsea at home, by the same score.\n\nHitchin FC FA Cup record\n\nWe all know that Hitchin played in the very first season of the FA Cup, meeting Crystal Palace (no relation to the current Palace side) on November 18 1871. The game was played in Hitchin in pouring rain and ended 0-0. Both sides went through to the next round.\n\n1871-72 R1 Crystal Palace Home D 0-0; R2 Royal Engineers Home L 0-5\n\n1872-73 R1 Clapham R Away L 1-3\n\n1874-75 R1 Maidenhead Home L 0-1\n\n1875-76 R1 Clapham R Away Scratched\n\n1887-88 R1 Old Wykehamists Home L 2-5\n\n1888-89 R1 Casuals Away Scratched\n\n1898-99 PR Uxbridge Away W 2-0; R1 Aylesbury Utd Away L 1-5\n\n1899-00 R1 Watford Away L 1-7\n\n1900-01 Q2 Leighton Springs Away Scratched\n\n1903-04 Q1 Leighton Springs Home W 5-0; Q2 Luton Amateurs Home W3-1; Q3 Luton Town Away L1-2\n\n1904-05 Q3 Clapton Orient Home W 2-1; Q4 Lowestoft Town Away W 3-0; Q5 Watford Away L 0-3\n\n1905-06 Q1 Irthlingborough Home W 6-1; Q2 Kettering Away D 2-2; Rep Kettering Home L 1-4\n\n1906-07 Q1 Biggleswade Away D 0-0; Q2 Kettering Home W 5-0; Q3 Irthlingborough Home D 2-2; Rep Irthlingborough Away L 2-5\n\n1907-08 PR Peterborough City Home L 1-3\n\nThe Spartan League years\n\nHitchin’s first stint in the Spartan Lague lasted just two seasons, but was seen as a way of salvaging a club that had found semi-professionalism too much. The club turned amateur in 1908 but played just one game, a 6-0 defeat at Walthamstow Grange. If they had continued, they would have met Luton Clarence, Chelmsford, South Weald and St.Albans City.\n\nIn 1909-10, Hitchin managed to complete the season in Division B. They also fielded a team in the Northern Section of the Herts County League. But it was a tough campaign for the club, the first after a major reorganisation. Hitchin won only three of their 10 league games in the Spartan, including only one away, a 4-0 success at Newportonians. Hitchin finished fifth in the six-team division.\n\n1910-11 proved to be Hitchin’s last before folding. The season started well, with a 4-0 win at Knebworth in the County league, but the Spartan League was much more challenging, with some early defeats at the hands of 2nd Coldstream Guards (0-7), St.Albans (0-7) and Aylesbury (2-3). In fact, Hitchin won just once in the Spartan League, a 1-0 victory against Newportonians thanks to a wonder goal by Tom King. They lost all their away games, including a 0-13 reverse at Tufnell Park.\n\nBy the end of the season, Hitchin were in a sorry state and during the summer of 1911, the club’s parlous finances pushed the club into bankruptcy. It would take 17 years to bring senior football back to the town.\n\nThe reformation\n\nHitchin was once a town full of pubs, a lot of which have closed down or changed into other retail outlets. One of the pub names that has lived on in folklore is the Angel Vaults, which stood in Sun Street. This was one of Hitchin’s most historic hostelries, demolished in the 1950s after it was deemed unsafe. In Hitchin Town’s history, the Angel Vaults played an important role – it was at this pub, on May 2 1928, that a group of worthies met to discuss the reformation of a town club. Football in Hitchin had limped on in various guises since the old Hitchin club folded in 1915. The temperance club, Hitchin Blue Cross, playing in the Bedfordshire League, had kept the flag flying, and Hitchin Athletic\n\nThe local press contained a story one week after the meeting proclaiming that “Hitchin Town Football Club is to be revived”, as if a long buried corpse was to be exhumed. Harry Cannon was voted to the chair and he was quick to point out that “no-one would look to make a profit out of the new club”. Cannon had some competition for the chair – Mr Frederick Furr had been Chairman of the old club and prominent people like FR Shillitoe were keen to be heard. The latter was fiercely critical of the past administration, claiming that the main problem with the defunct club was that players had been paid. This was certainly true until the turn of the 20th century when the club dropped its professional status and became amateur once more.\n\nThis was a key factor in the meeting. Given that “professional” status had been the downfall of the first incarnation of Hitchin Town Football Club, was it wise to go down the same route?. The vote was narrow, however, with 30-24 in favour of the new club being a purely amateur concern.\n\nThe subject of a home ground was also a tender topic. It was generally felt that the Bedford Road Ground, which was being used by the Junior Imperial League – better than as “the Imps”, was not a good idea. One Mr Ransom was given the task of checking with the Blue Cross Brigade and the Grammar School Old Boys to see if a groundshare agreement could be reached. But the Blue Cross club was under threat in 1928 and eventually folded after Hitchin Grammar School took over their ground. After much discussion, the new club eventually struck a deal with the Imps, who sub-let the ground to the club for a fee of £ 30 per year.\n\nA series of meetings were held into early summer, and it was decided that the club should join the Beds & District League and possibly the Herts County League. But the Spartan League was also possible and in the weeks that followed, this became the preferred option. Initially, the club also settled upon all-white as its playing kit, but this soon changed to yellow shirts and blue shorts. The nickname, “Canaries” was also born. Harry Cannon’s position also changed and one L.S. Hart was named chairman of the club with Cannon taking up the President’s role. The Angel Vaults became the club’s official temporary headquarters. At the end of May, the ground situation had still to be clarified, but by August, tenders had been put out for the grandstand.\n\nOn June 19 1928, at London’s Great Eastern Hotel in Liverpool Street, Hitchin Town was elected to the Spartan League Second Division. The reputation of Hitchin football teams such as Blue Cross and the convincing argument raised by Hitchin officials meant they were just two votes away from being elected to the first division. News spread like wildfire around the town and surrounding villages. On August 17, more than 600 people turned up at the Bedford Road Ground to see the club’s first practice match. It was clear that there was a big appetite for the new club.\n\nPlayers came from all corners of North Hertfordshire and Mid-Bedfordshire. From Ickleford came goalkeeper Tom Olney; from Whitwell came his competitor for the gloves and cap, Jim Garner; Trussell, a hard full back, was from Pirton; a handful of players, such as Wilson Gatward, Eddie Bullard and Tom Ayres were previously with Blue Cross. Cecil Burges, who would be a key figure in the club’s first season, was an experienced player with St.Albans and the county. Bob Allen, who had run team affairs at Hitchin Blue Cross, was named as the Canaries first manager.\n\n1928-29: Game-by-game\n\nAugust 25: Hitchin Town (1) 5 Waltham Comrades (0)1\n\nCaptained by Wilson Gatward, of the famous Hitchin jewellers, Hitchin trounced Waltham Comrades at Top Field in front of 1,500 people. The eager Hitchin public had to wait until just before half-time for the club’s first goal. George Pateman played the ball through to William “Buff” Barker and the inside left ran on beat Waltham keeper Boswell who had come out to meet him. Waltham equalised just after the interval, but Barker restored Hitchin’s lead. The hero of the day, however, was Charlie Davis, who scored a hat-trick in the closing stages to give the Canaries the “happy start” they were looking for.\n\nSeptember 1: Finchley Reserves (1)1 Hitchin Town (1)2\n\nHitchin’s squad was described as a “very happy family” by the Finchley officials. The Canaries went to Finchley without Bob Grimes and Wilson Gatward, both of whom received injuries in the opening game of the season. But Davis and Stan Brown, elder brother of Reg and Claude Brown, scored the goals as Hitchin continued their 100% record.\n\nSeptember 8: Hitchin Town (1)4 Ware (1)2\n\n“Victory in spite of accidents,” said the headline as Hitchin won in sweltering heat at Top Field. It was a sorry debut for Tom Ayres, the former Blue Cross right half who injured his shoulder and never played for the club again. Charlie Davis scored to give Hitchin the lead, but by the interval it was 1-1. Davis went on to score another hat-trick with Stan Brown netting for the second game running. Ayres was not the only casualty, however, for Phil Crawley damaging his ankle and was stretchered off.\n\nSeptember 15: Polytechnic (0) 2 Hitchin Town (2)6\n\nThe Canaries made the trip to Chiswick to meet Polytechnic. Interestingly, the general public were not allowed to enter the ground, but a small band of Hitchin supporters made the trip to see their team win again. Hitchin conceded a penalty for the first time, but at the other end, Charlie Davis was on form again, scoring three goals with Harry Grimes netting twice and “Buff” Barker adding another. “Davis’ hat-trick habit,” said the headlines as the former Letchworth man made it 10 goals in four games.\n\nSeptember 22: Hitchin Town (1)5 Hoddesdon Town (0)0 – FA Amateur Cup Preliminary Round\n\nA crowd of 1,690 turned up to see the Canaries’ Amateur Cup debut. Hitchin were on the offensive from the start but it took a second half onslaught to see off Hoddesdon. Barker scored two and the other goals came from Davis, Stan Brown and Harry Grimes. Cecil Burges missed a penalty.\n\nSeptember 29: Hitchin Town (2)4 Lea Bridge Gas (0)1\n\nHitchin went top of the league, taking a two point lead over fierce rivals Metropolitan Police Reserves. A large crowd had turned up to see the Canaries, with George Trussell scoring the club’s first penalty to give them the lead. Davis scored two more and Stan Brown was also on the scoresheet.\n\nOctober 6: Hitchin Town (0)1 Enfield (0)3 – FA Amateur Cup first qualifying round\n\nEnfield were a high-flying Athenian League side when they came to Hitchin and were too strong and experienced for the fledgling Canaries. A large crowd of 1,500 attended the game and it was only a late penalty by Ben Saggers that provided the consolation for the home side.\n\nOctober 13: Metropolitan Police Res. (1)4 Hitchin Town (1)3\n\nHitchin’s first league debut came at Imber Court on a very poor pitch. Hitchin were level at the interval thanks to Albert Tasker’s first goal for the club. The strong police side went 3-1 ahead, but Tasker and Charlie Evans scored to restore parity. As soon as Hitchin had made their dramatic comeback, the police broke away and scored the winner.\n\nOctober 20: Ware (0)1 Hitchin Town (1)5\n\nHarry Wombwell, who joined the club from Walsworth just a few days earlier, scored four on his debut for the club. Wombwell impressed the local press: “he can shoot with either foot”. Evans gave Hitchin the lead and Wombwell netted four in the second half, his last goal a spectacular overhead kick. Ware were an aggressive side, and Jack Davey was carried off injured.\n\nNovember 3: Hitchin Town (4)8 Ministry of Health (0)1\n\nThe grandstand at Top Field was opened on the day that Wombwell and Evans scored a hat-trick apiece against the civil servants. For the first time, the players could change in the ground. Evans scored a second half hat-trick and Burgess and Barker netted the other goals as Hitchin returned to the top of the table.\n\nNovember 10: Hitchin Town (2)4 Stevenage Town (0)2 – Herts Charity Shield Round One\n\nHitchin’s first meeting with Stevenage ended in a bruising yet comfortable victory in the Charity Shield. Hitchin were 4-0 up by the time the visitors netted two late goals. Stevenage were hampered by an injury to goalkeeper Garner. Hitchin’s goals came from Tasker, Evans(2) and Davey.\n\nDecember 1: Poplar Rovers (1)1 Hitchin Town (2)4\n\nTwenty Hitchin supporters went down to East London to see the Canaries in action and they saw centre half and RAF airman J.C.F Thomson score twice from the penalty spot.\n\nDecember 11: Hitchin Town (0)4 Baldock Town (1)2 – Herts Charity Shield\n\nAlmost 2,000 people turned up at Top Field to see the Canaries come from behind to beat neighbours Baldock. Thomson again scored from the penalty spot – a disputed award – while Baldock’s goals came from Stan Millard and Jack Oyston, who would both join the Canaries.Tasker (2) and Barker scored Hitchin’s other goals.\n\nDecember 15: Welwyn Garden City (2)3 Hitchin Town (2)4\n\nA late rally gave Hitchin a narrow victory against Welwyn on a hard and treacherous pitch. Hitchin were level at half-time, with first half goals coming from Evans and Wombwell. Welwyn led 3-2 before Jack Davey netted twice in the last 10 minutes.\n\nDecember 22: Hitchin Town (5)7 Hoddesdon Town (0)1\n\nHoddesdon arrived at Hitchin with only six players and kicked off with a distinct disadvantage. Hitchin went a goal ahead after two minutes when Thomson netted from the penalty spot. Hoddesdon missing five eventually turned up but they were 2-0 down by this time. By the interval, Harry Wombwell had scored four times and Hitchin were 5-0 ahead. Davey and Evans added further goals in the second period.\n\nDecember 26: Hitchin Town (1)1 Metropolitan Police Reserves (0)1\n\nThe Boxing Day clash at Top Field attracted over 2,000 people. The Police side was the only one to take points off Hitchin at that point and they had a 100% record. Davey gave Hitchin the lead but after intense pressure, the Police levelled to earn a point. Both teams attended Brakes Theatre in the evening.\n\nJanuary 5: Hitchin Town (3)4 Welwyn Garden City (0)2\n\nA small crowd saw a difficult game for the Canaries on a hard and slippery pitch. Davey, Tasker and Thomson (penalty) all scored before half-time. Welwyn adopted a tough approach in the second half and dragged themselves back into the game, but the referee was given a hard time by the crowd, who continually barracked him – presumably because he refused to penalise the visitors’ rough play. Wombwell added a fourth for Hitchin.\n\nJanuary 12: Waltham Comrades (2)2 Hitchin Town (3)9\n\nA much changed Hitchin forward line trounced Waltham with Ted Bullard scoring four times (all in the second half). Sonny Furr scored twice, Barker, Burgess and Muncey got the other goals. Waltham Comrades actually opened the scoring in this game!\n\nJanuary 19: Letchworth Town (1)2 Hitchin Town (2)8 Herts Senior Cup\n\nIf Letchworth had not received an early blow when their key forward was injured, the scoreline might have been a lot closer, said the local press. But Hitchin were in fine form and Wombwell scored four times with Evans (2), Thomson and Tasker netting the others. Cecil Burgess scored an own goal.\n\nJanuary 26: Hoddesdon Town (2)3 Hitchin Town (3)5\n\nHitchin went top of the table once more, two points ahead of Met.Police Reserves after this victory. Hoddesdon took an early lead, but Hitchin levelled almost immediately through Barker. By the interval, Hitchin were 3-2 ahead after goals by Evans and Davey. Tasker and Davey added further goals in the second half.\n\nFebruary 2: Hitchin Town (4)7 Finchley Reserves (0)0\n\nHitchin skipper Burgess was missing from this trouncing of Finchley but his replacement Bill Stevens, had a steady debut. Finchley had a setback when their defender Brain was carried off and taken to hospital with a lung injury. It was one way traffic throughout, with Wombwell (2), Barker (2), Evans, Davey and Thomson scoring the goals.\n\nFebruary 9: Hitchin Town (5)8 Boreham Rovers (0)0 Herts Charity Shield\n\nDespite poor weather, this cup tie attracted over 1,000 people. Burgess was still unavailable and early on George Trussell was injured, but it didn’t seem to make a difference. Boreham were completely outplayed and were 5-0 down at the interval. Three more goals came after the break, so Hitchin won through to the Herts Charity Shield final with ease. The goals came from Wombwell (3), Davey (2), Evans, Tasker and Thomson.\n\nFebruary 23: Baldock Town (2) 3 Hitchin Town (1)4 Herts Senior Cup\n\nThe British Legion Band provided the entertainment while Hitchin and Baldock served up an exciting cup tie. Not for the first time in the season, Baldock made if hard for the Canaries, going 2-0 up early on and leading 3-2 later in the game. Hitchin’s goals came from Harold Handscombe (2) and Charlie Evans (2), the former scoring the winner.\n\nMarch 2: Northampton Polytechnic Institute (0)3 Hitchin Town (1)3\n\nHitchin received a shock from the struggling home side and could only draw in front of a crowd of just 10 people at Palmers Green, North London. Hitchin were 3-1 up, with goals from Barker, Wombwell and Thomson. But Northampton scored two late goals to earn a point.\n\nMarch 9: St.Albans City (2)6 Hitchin Town (2)2 Herts Senior Cup\n\nHitchin had no answer to the legendary St.Albans forward Billy Minter, who scored four goals in the second half of this semi-final. Hitchin led 2-1 in the first half, thanks to goals from Davey and Thomson. A crowd of 3,000, of which 10% came from Hitchin, watched the game.\n\nMarch 16: Hitchin Town (2)5 Northampton Polytechnic Institute (0)1\n\nHitchin gained revenge on bottom-placed Northampton for the 3-3 draw of two weeks earlier. The visitors had a major setback when two players were carried off with head injuries. Hitchin’s goals came from Evans (2), Barker, Saggers (penalty) and Ted Bullard.\n\nMarch 23: Hitchin Town (2)5 Walthamstow Avenue Reserves (1)1\n\nDespite trouncing Walthamstow, Hitchin remained a point behind Metropolitan Police Reserves. It could have been an even bigger victory but form the Londoners’ goalkeeper Cornford. Ted Bullard and Barker were both in fine form, and Bullard netted twice and Barker once. Albert Tasker also scored twice.\n\nMarch 30: Hitchin Town (1)5 Letchworth Town (2)3 Herts Charity Shield\n\nThe club’s first final since reformation saw the Canaries win the Charity Shield in front of more than 2,000 people. Letchworth went ahead but Albert Tasker equalised only for Ray Dunkley – who would eventually play for Hitchin – restored the visitors’ lead. Tasker again came to Hitchin’s rescue.\n\nEvans, Bullard and Barker gave Hitchin a 5-2 lead before Gray pulled one back for Letchworth. At the end, Hitchin’s skipper for the day, Ben Saggers, was presented with the shield, and said: “A great thing to win a county shield in our first year.”\n\nApril 6: Lea Bridge Gas (2)3 Hitchin Town (0)1\n\nA shock defeat for Hitchin, but it could have been worse in what was probably the worst performance of the season. It was only a late goal by Davey that provided any consolation for the Canaries.\n\nApril 10: Ministry of Health (1)1 Hitchin Town (2)3\n\nHitchin secured their promotion place with a comfortable win at Ministry of Health in Gunnersbury Park. On a narrow pitch, Hitchin struggled to get going, but West, Furr and Cheshire scored the goals. Bullard was “in the wars” with a blooded nose.\n\nApril 13: Walthamstow Avenue Reserves (3) 6 Hitchin Town (3)6\n\nAn amazing game, watched by 1,000 people. Hitchin went 3-0 down but by half-time, it was 3-3 and then the Canaries went 4-3 ahead. At the end, it was Hitchin that had to fight back for a draw, Burges scoring as the referee was looking at his watch. “A ding-dong struggle”, said the local press. Hitchin’s scorers were Barker (3), Burges (2) and Muncey.\n\nApril 17: Hitchin Town (0)5 Polytechnic (2) 2\n\nHitchin were stunned by a first half display from Polytechnic that saw the Canaries go in at the interval two goals down. But a second half comeback saw the gain two more points.Tasker and Thomson brought Hitchin level in the second half, but when Webster put Hitchin ahead, the cheer from the crowd could be heard in Highbury Road. Tasker and Thomson added two more to cap a marvellous second half.\n\nApril 20: Hitchin Town (3)5 Poplar Rovers (1)1\n\nHitchin ended their first season since reformation with a resounding win against Poplar. The Canaries were one point behind the Met.Police, so the Spartan League Division Two (East) title would be decided on the final day of the campaign. Hitchin needed the league leaders to lose at Walthamstow Avenue and had to beat a young Poplar side. Hitchin’s result was never in doubt. Hitchin’s goals in a 5-1 win came from Wombwell (2), Burges, Tasker and Barker. The scene shifted to Brand Street, where a large crowd had gathered to obtain the score from Walthamstow – it was being posted in the window of V.H. Garratt’s shop at 7pm. The Police won, and secured the title. Nevertheless, Hitchin had enjoyed a tremendous first season since reformation!\n\nPlayer-by-player\n\nStanley Faulkner\n\nSigned in the summer of 1928 from Meppershall. A steady goalkeeper who was ever-present in the league in 1928-29. Was a fixture between the posts until Cecil Cannon arrived at the club.\n\nBen Saggers\n\nA tough full back who joined the club from Stevenage Town in September 1928. Captained the Canaries on occasions, including the Herts Charity Shield Final, and was a useful penalty taker. Stayed two seasons with Hitchin before moving on. Could also play right wing.\n\nGeorge Trussell\n\nTrussell was a reliable player who made 184 first team appearances, scoring three goals, for the club. Arrived from Pirton Athletic as a 20 year-old, and was the first Hitchin player to make 100 appearances for the club as well as the first to score an own goal! A popular player, Trussell was said to have a strong kick and “an equally hard head”.\n\nTed Bullard\n\nFormer Hitchin Blue Cross player who made his debut in the club’s first game following reformation and despite a number of injuries, played a part in that debut season.\n\nGeorge Cheshire\n\nR.G. Cheshire was signed from Pirton Athletic and stayed with the club until 1929-30 season. He was mostly an inside right with Pirton, but at Hitchin played right half. He played 45 games for Hitchin, scoring 2 goals. He later became indelibly linked with Arlesey Town and was chairman for some time.\n\nCecil E. Burges\n\nKnown, for some reason, as “Budger”, Burges joined Hitchin from Cambridge Town, after playing his early football with Hitchin Blue Cross. He captained Hitchin British Schools and was a prolific goalscorer with Blue Cross. He then moved to St.Albans City for two seasons, winning the Herts Senior Cup with the Saints. Burges played left half on his return to his home town club, and went on to appear 40 times between 1928 and 1932. He also played cricket for Hitchin.\n\nGeorge Pateman\n\nPateman made his debut for Hitchin against Waltham Comrades in their opening game of 1928-29 and went on to make 124 appearances for the club, scoring four goals. Before joining the Canaries, Pateman played for Hitchin Union Jack, Hitchin Blue Cross and Walsworth. A versatile player, his favoured position was left half. He departed Hitchin in November 1933 for Stevenage.\n\nWilliam Barker\n\nBarker was signed from Baldock Town in the summer of 1928 and he had the honour of scoring Hitchin Town’s first goal following reformation. He also played briefly for the club in 1929-30, in total scoring 21 goals in 34 games.\n\nStan Brown\n\nStan Brown was one of five Brown brothers to have played for the club (Reg and Claude were two of his younger brothers). He also played for Hertford Town and St.Albans City.\n\nHarold Handscombe\n\nPirton-born centre forward who was part of an ecclesiastical family, many of whom played for Pirton Athletic.\n\nJ.C.F. Thomson\n\nCentre half of left half who played for RAF Henlow.\n\nT.J. West\n\nLeft winger who failed to establish himself in two seasons with the club.\n\nFrank Webster\n\nSigned for the club at the back end of 1928-29 from Baldock and went on to play a key role in the\n\nfollowing season at centre half.\n\nSonny Furr\n\nA member of the Furr family that was indelibly linked with the club for many years. Sonny, or A.S., was a tough tackling full back but was a club official right until the 1970s.\n\nP.A. Millard\n\nA right back from Langford, who played just one game for the club.\n\nAlbert Tasker\n\nTasker was known as “the happy warrior”. Born in Willian, he didn’t start playing football until after his schooldays. His first club was Baldock Athletic after which he joined Norton and then on to Letchworth. He joined Hitchin in October 1928, making his debut in the FA Amateur Cup against Enfield. Although an inside left by trade, Tasker could play in any of the frontline positions and had an excellent scoring record, netting 84 times in 135 first team games for the Canaries between 1928 and 1932-33.\n\nWilson Gatward\n\nA member of the well-known Hitchin jeweller family, Gatward came to Hitchin Town from Hitchin Blue Cross and was skipper for the club’s first game against Waltham Comrades. A composed left back, he was injured after two games and never played again for the club.\n\nPhil Crawley\n\nAlthough he played in the club’s first game of the 1928-29 season, Crawley struggled to maintain a first team place at Hitchin after arriving from Pirton Athletic, where he was club captain. But he was to prove to be a great clubman and played for the club until 1934-35.\n\nJack Davey\n\nA free-scoring right winger with Letchworth, Davey made an instant impact at Hitchin when he joined the club in September 1928. He stayed two seasons, making 42 appearances and scoring 25 goals.\n\nTom Ayres\n\nHad a short and disastrous career at Hitchin, playing less than half an hour against Ware on September 8 1928 before being carried off to hospital with a badly injured shoulder. He had joined the club in the summer from Hitchin Blue Cross.\n\nHarold Grimes\n\nGrimes was a well known player in local football and played for Arlesey before coming to Hitchin in July 1928. An outside right, he failed to maintain a first team spot and spent most of the season in the reserves. His Hitchin first team career totalled five games and three goals.\n\nBob Grimes\n\nSigned from Hitchin Athletic in the summer of 1928, Grimes, a left half back, played in Hitchin’s opening game against Waltham Comrades and no more.\n\nJoe Muncey\n\nRight winger Muncey spent three seasons as Hitchin, making his debut and scoring a goal at Waltham Comrades in January 1929.\n\nH.C. “Charlie” Evans\n\nAn experienced inside right, Evans joined Hitchin from Leagrave and scored 19 goals in 20 appearances for the club.\n\nCharlie Davis\n\nCentre forward signed from Letchworth in summer of 1928. Scored a hat-trick in Hitchin’s first game against Waltham Comrades and ended the season with 13 goals in seven games.\n\nVic Cherry\n\nLeft back who made just one appearance for the club.\n\nJack Croft\n\nInside left who joined the club from Biggleswade and made just two appearances for the Canaries.\n\nWilliam Berry\n\nPlayed in Hitchin’s first game at inside right, his only appearance for the club.\n\nCyril Foster\n\nA Hitchin man through and through, Cyril was still attending games at Hitchin in the early 1990s. He also played for Hitchin Blue Cross in the 1920s.\n\nW.Stevens\n\nLeft half back who played just one game for the club.\n\nAt last, Hitchin Town’s supporters could rejoice in the club’s first decent post-war team. Charlie Watkins had made some progress in 1952-53 and in the summer of 1953, he made some important new signings. Peter Hammond, who would become Hitchin’s first England international, joined from Arlesey Town, and Keith Abbiss, who would later become a professional with Brighton, was another new acquisition. Dave Sayers, a centre forward formerly with St.Albans and Bedford, also arrived at Top Field.\n\nNot only did Hitchin enjoy their finest Athenian League campaign, they also went close to winning the title. They also enjoyed good runs in the two FA competitions.\n\nHammond and Abbiss both made their debut on the opening day of the season at Finchley. Hitchin were narrowly beaten 2-1, but the press said, “nothing to worry about”, recognising that the Canaries had dominated large parts of the game.\n\nThe FA Cup provided the first thrills of a season that had plenty to keep Hitchin fans excited. Leytonstone, then a major force in the Isthmian League, were beaten on their own patch in the fourth qualifying round. “One of the great days in Hitchin’s footballing history, crowed the press as Hitchin beat an experienced side. Hitchin were faster on the ball with Sayers and Johnny Ward constantly menacing up front. Ken Lawrence scored the only goal.\n\nThe first round brought a home tie with Peterborough United, the leaders of the powerful Midland League. They were one of the strongest non-league teams in the country. In goal they had the former Newcastle United custodian Jack Fairbrother. In addition, they had in defence ex-Manchester United player John Anderson. Fairbrother made a string of saves to keep “Posh” in the game. “Hitchin were their equals throughout, in fact produced the better football. Steadiness in front of goal would have made a big difference to the score,” claimed the report. Peterborough won 3-1 but Hitchin had covered themselves in glory and had attracted a crowd of 6,232 to Top Field.\n\nWhen the FA Amateur Cup came around, Hitchin were named among the favourites. The run started with wins against Oxford City and Crittall Athletic and gathered momentum with a win against Erith. Barnet were then beaten after a replay, thanks to an exciting 3-1 win at Top Field in which Hammond, Abbiss and Brian Smith all won praise for their performances. The quarter-finals paired Hitchin with Crook Town, a formidable hurdle. Hitchin made the very trip North with a depleted team- Ray Kitchener was injured and early in the game, John Whitby broke a leg. Crook hammered Hitchin 10-1 and eventually won the cup.\n\nBack in the league, hopes were high that the club could lift its first Athenian League title. The Canaries approached Easter seven point behind leaders Southall, but they had five games in hand – it could be done with a strenuous effort. Even the Hitchin officials were starting to believe it could be done. “Not for many a long day has a season ended for us in such a whirl of excitement as this one is doing,” said the club programme.\n\nAfter a holiday programme that saw four out of six points gained, Hitchin were third, just four points behind Southall but three games in hand. Even so, Finchley were better placed to win the championship. With two games to go, the position had started to crystallise. Hitchin were top, but Finchley now had two games in hand. The London side win their next three games, against Southall, Hayes and Hendon, giving them the title. Hitchin were now second, three points behind Finchley – the pressure of so many games in such a short timeframe had worn out Watkins’ men. But Hitchin, as ever, were gracious in defeat and remained bullish about their own season. “Certainly we have confounded our critics and we congratulate the team on a really splendid record.”\n\nThe team was young enough to improve and had enough experienced to combat the best that the Athenian League had to offer – at least that was the popular belief as Hitchin’s finest season since 1935 came to an end.\n\nPeter Hammond\n\nPeter Hammond is a name that will always be synonymous with football in North Hertfordshire. In an age when amateur football was full of gentlemanly conduct, fair play and a tub and a half of brylcreem, Hammond stood for everything that was good about the game.\n\nIn a career that spanned 26 years, Hammond played for Arlesey Town, Hitchin Town, Enfield, Letchworth and Baldock Town. In 1949 he joined Arlesey Town as a winger. He moved to Hitchin in 1953 and made his debut on August 22 1953 against Finchley. His first goal came a few days later and he would eventually score 150 times for the club and was top scorer at Hitchin in 1955, 1956, 1958 and 1959. He netted five goals in one game, against Keynsham in the FA Amateur Cup. At various times, he was knocking on the door of the England amateur selectors.\n\nHe was eventually picked to play for England, becoming Hitchin’s first England amateur international. He made his only appearance on October 25 1958, playing for England against South Africa and Wycombe Wanderers’ Loakes Park. Hammond recalled his only game for his country some years later: “I matured rather late as a player and perhaps my one cap was recognition that I had a good career. I did not hear from them again.” Earlier in his career, Hammond signed amateur forms with Luton Town and also turned out for the “A” teams of Portsmouth, Arsenal, QPR and Tottenham. There were other representative honours – he played more than 30 times for Hertfordshire and countless times for the Athenian League and FA XIs. He was picked for Middlesex Wanderers.\n\nIn 1961, he had a year with Enfield but returned for a brief spell when the club moved from Athenian to Isthmian leagues. He finally departed in 1964. “I was sad to leave Hitchin. The team spirit was marvellous and we were all friends,” he recalled. For a while he played for Letchworth and then became player-manager at Baldock Town. He guided Baldock to three South Midlands League titles in six years. He finally retired from playing in 1973.\n\nKeith Abbiss\n\nKeith Abbiss was born on April 26 1932 in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. He was just 17 when he made his debut for the Canaries, a friendly against Clacton at Top Field in March 1950. The following season, in September, he made his first team bow proper, lining up on the left wing at home to Hayes. Although he made 25 appearances in 1950-51, national service got in the way for a couple of season and it was not until 1953-54 that he became a regular in the Canaries side. He caught the eye of professional clubs in that season, playing a prominent part in Hitchin’s FA Amateur Cup run to the quarter-final stage and a runners-up spot in the Athenian League. In the ill-fated game at Crook Town on February 20 1954, Keith played in the centre forward berth. He played in a number of positions, from right half to left wing, but it was as a half back that most people consider to be his most effective role. Halfway through 1954-55, Keith had a spell away from the club, but he returned in December 1955 to once more contribute to another FA Amateur Cup run. His two goals at Brigg Sports were enough to send Hitchin through to the third round where they played against Wycombe Wanderers, a game that attracted a record 7,878 people to Top Field. He played in that memorable game, but in a few weeks, he had fallen out with the club. Legend has it that Keith was asked to play in the outside right position and refused. News reports of the time suggested an impasse between club and player and this led to him being released at the end of the 1955-56 campaign after a Top Field career amounting to 100 games and 30 goals. He joined Letchworth in the close season of 1956. In October 1957, Keith Abbiss joined Brighton & Hove Albion and went on to play 19 Football League games, scoring three goals.\n\nRay Kitchener\n\nRay Kitchener was a member of the Hitchin team that finished runners-up in the Athenian League and reached the FA Amateur Cup quarter finals in 1953-54. “Fortunately for me, I didn’t play in the quarter final defeat at Crook (a 1-10 record score),” he says. “I was injured just prior to that game, so I was spared that.” Towards the end of that season, he was approached by then Chelsea manager Ted Drake, who told him he was being watched. “Ted wanted me to join Chelsea, but I was not sure. I was close to winning an England cap and I really wanted to achieve that,” recalls Ray. His hopes of a cap had been heightened by George Robb – then a fixture in the national side – moving to Tottenham. But it was not to be. Drake offered to take Ray on a club tour of North America, to see how he liked a taste of the professional game. “It was a marvellous experience and at the end of the six-week tour, I joined Chelsea.” The 1954-55 season saw Chelsea land the League Championship and their reserves also won their title. Ray picked up a Football Combination winners’ medal and played with men like Bobby Smith, later to win the coveted double with Tottenham. During his time at Chelsea, he played one Football League game, alongside such luminaries as Roy Bentley. He moved on to Norwich City in 1957 before winding down his career in the Eastern Counties League.\n\nThe 1960-61 season ranks among the finest in Hitchin Town’s history. Hitchin Town 1960-61Manager Laurie Scott had started to assemble a useful side over the previous two years and in the summer of 1960, he had secured the services of Terry Waldock, a move that many considered to be the “final piece of the jigsaw”. Other new faces included Peter Cox, also from Finchley and Dennis Randall from Vauxhall Motors. Waldock and Randall would form on the most potent attacks in the Canaries’ history.\n\nJust days before the season got underway, Don Birdsey, writing in the local press, said: “Hitchin should do better this time.” These were prophetic words, indeed.\n\nHitchin fired on all fronts in 1960-61. Although they failed to win any of their first four games – conceding six goals in two of those fixtures – as 1960 drew to a close, goals started to flow in the right direction. But it was the FA Cup that provided much of the excitement in the early months. Biggleswade (4-0), Vauxhall Motors (3-0), St.Albans (4-0) and Abingdon (2-0) were despatched to give Hitchin a first round tie at Crystal Palace. The London side were top of the Third Division South at the time, and expected a crowd of 20,000 for the tie. The Canaries lost 6-2, but were by no means disgraced, with Charlie Turner having an outstanding game keeping Palace at bay.\n\nAfter going out of the FA Cup, Hitchin turned their attention to the Athenian League. Leyton were beaten 10-0 (Randall scoring four), Finchley 9-3 (another Randall treble) and Enfield 3-2. Between December 10 and February 25, Hitchin won seven of their eight league games to emerge as genuine title contenders.\n\nFord United provided Hitchin’s first opposition in the FA Amateur Cup. Newspaper cartoon, Crystal Palace v Hitchin TownThe Canaries won 4-0. “To my knowledge, nobody has tipped Hitchin as possible cup winners. But this was the sort of performance which must make a lot of clubs sit up and take notice,” noted the match report.\n\nSouthall were beaten 3-2 in the next round, with the injured Randall heading what proved to be the winner. Randall was the hero again in round three, scoring two goals as the Canaries beat Ferryhill Athletic in front of more than 5,000 people. The quarter final sent Hitchin to Loughborough Colleges to play against a team of Physical Education instructors. The college side had a certain pedigree, having beaten Bishop Auckland and Corinthian Casuals on the way to the last eight. The pitch was surrounded by a bank of grass and a series of duckboards.\n\nThe game captured the imagination of the locals as well as a huge band of Hitchin supporters who travelled to the game. The Canaries’ performance is considered to be a high point for Laurie Scott’s talented side as a 5-1 scoreline suggests. The press was full of praise. “If Hitchin can keep this form up, nothing can stop them from winning the FA Amateur Cup.” But there was something in Hitchin’s way – Walthamstow Avenue.\n\nThere was a blow for Hitchin in the week preceding the semi-final at White City – a stadium that would host one 1966 World Cup tie. Terry Waldock was injured and ruled out of the tie. Scott shuffled his pack and brought in Jeff Cowan. The game was a tight affair, but it was settled by a controversial penalty, awarded after the ball had bounced onto Cowan’s arm. Jim Lewis, who played in Chelsea’s 1955 championship side, buried the kick past Turner.\n\nHitchin were crestfallen but returned to league action in a bid to win the title. They still had 10 games to play. Three wins after White City suggested they could win it, but three other clubs were in the hunt – Hendon, Wealdstone and Barnet. Hitchin’s last three games were all against the challengers.\n\nAfter a good Easter, the Canaries lost at home to Southall, a game which saw a crowd disturbance as one frustrated supporter invaded the pitch in frustration. The truth was, however, that this defeat proved very costly. Hitchin had run out of steam and won just once in their last five games, finished fifth, six points behind champions Hendon. But Hitchin officials were delighted with the 1960-61 season. “It will be a long time before we forget those great Amateur cup wins…with a little more luck, we would have won the title.” There was one prize, however- the Herts Charity Cup.\n\nDennis Randall\n\nDennis Randall joined the Canaries in 1960, taking over from Peter Hammond in the centre forward role. “I came into a very good side, with two excellent wingers in Roger Figg and Tony Horne and a goalscoring inside forward in Johnny Graves,” recalled Dennis.\n\nHe was renowned for his heading skills. “I must have scored 60% of my goals with my head, but in truth, the players I had around me made it easier for me.”\n\nDennis credits Laurie Scott for sharpening up his game. “I basically stepped up a grade when I came to Hitchin and Laurie worked very hard with me. I was always very tired after training!”\n\nHe had scored prolifically for Vauxhall Motors and the Athenian League was a better standard of football. He made his debut for Hitchin on August 20th 1960 at Southall and in his first season, he scored 52 goals in 42 games. The following season, he scored 51 goals in 44 games.\n\nHe won two England amateur caps in 1962, “a great honour”, and regrets that the Canaries didn’t win the FA Amateur Cup. “We should have done better against Walthamstow Avenue in the semi-final,” he remembered. “If we had been less shy and taken our chances, we would have gone all the way.”\n\nHe recalled many of the players from that fine team. “Bruce Spavins was a hell of a player and Charlie Turner was an excellent keeper. Johnny Graves made my game and Tony Horne was a brilliant crosser of the ball.”\n\nDennis left Hitchin in 1962, and turned semi-pro with Kettering in the Southern League. “I was getting married at the time and the move was good financially, but Laurie tried to keep me. But that Hitchin team was fantastic to play in and I enjoyed my two years with the club.”\n\nTerry Craddock\n\nTerry Craddock was one of coach Laurie Scott’s best signings for the Canaries and became one of the great characters on and off the pitch in a golden era for the club.\n\nHe had come to Hitchin’s attention as an inside forward, appearing against the Canaries in August 1957 for Letchworth Town. A much-coveted youngster, Craddock signed for Hitchin in 1959. Earlier in his career he played for the England Boys Club team and was on the books of Queens Park Rangers. He also won England schoolboy honours.\n\nCraddock made his Hitchin debut on August 22 1959 against Redhill at Top Field. He scored his first goal for the club on September 26 1959 against Carshalton in a 3-2 win for the Canaries. Initially an inside forward, on either side of the field, in his first season, Craddock was top scorer with 17 goals. But he developed into one of the best half backs in the amateur game, possessing great energy and a blisteringly hard shot.\n\nIn 1906-61, Hitchin narrowly lost in the FA Amateur Cup semi-final to Walthamstow Avenue and although many people felt the Canaries froze on the day, Craddock was totally unperturbed by the occasion. An ebullient figure, he was very much at the heart and soul of Laurie Scott’s team.\n\nTwo years later, Craddock was in the Hitchin side that missed out again at the penultimate stage of the competition, losing 4-0 to Sutton at Fulham’s Craven Cottage.\n\nCraddock made 271 competitive appearances for the Canaries, scoring 58 goals. He later played for Baldock Town.\n\nCharlie Turner at Loughborough in the FA Amateur Cup Quarter-Final. Turner’s opposite number on a memorable day was Bob Wilson, who went on to play for Arsenal and Scotland. Wilson was injured in the game, but played on with cracked ribs.\n\nAfter the highs of the 1970s, characterized by some exciting cup runs, the 1980s saw Hitchin Town fall into decline, climaxing in relegation in 1988.\n\nIt was no surprise when the Canaries dropped out of the Isthmian Premier in 1988, but what was disturbing for the club was the fall in attendances, the constant change in strategy and management and the apparent loss of faith from the town.\n\nIn 1979-80, the signs of decline were evident, encapsulated in a 10-0 debacle at Slough. Hitchin finished 12th in the league, but a drastic cut in wages at the club meant that the Canaries went into the summer of 1980 downcast.\n\n“We are three to four years behind the times,” said secretary and long-time club stalwart Cyril Buck as the club prepared for the new season. In the summer, there had been several changes to the management structure of the club. David Morgan became chairman and Gerald Lincoln was appointed financial director. “People have to realize that the club has to be run as a business,” said Lincoln, adding that he felt there was a lot of untapped potential at Top Field.\n\nDespite restricted finances, manager Ray Freeman had been ringing the changes in his squad. New arrivals included Bobby Folds – father of future Hitchin captain Liam Folds – from Bedford, Peter Adnams from Harlow Town, Steve Mahoney from Hertford Town (right) and the experienced Terry Mortimer.\n\nOn the debit side, Bill Baldry and Steve Hodge had left for Barton Rovers, George Cooper had returned to St.Albans City and former captain Ray Brimson had moved to Milton Keynes.\n\nDespite the gloom, the new-look Canaries began the season in tremendous form. Carshalton and Boreham Wood were both beaten by three goals and when Hitchin recorded their first ever win in the Isthmian League Cup – against Southall & Ealing – Top Field regulars could be forgiven for expecting a memorable season.\n\nIn the FA Cup, Hitchin explored foreign territory when they began their campaign in the first qualifying round for the first time in seven years. Rushden Town (the forerunners of Rushden & Diamonds, one of non-league’s first ‘super clubs’) were beaten 3-0, setting up a tie with Gorleston that the Canaries won by a single goal, scored by Paul Giggle.\n\nTo add firepower to the Hitchin attack, Freeman brought in a young forward named Micky Small (left) from Luton Town. The Hatters’ manager, David Pleat, was keen to test the ability of a raw and untried youngster in senior football and sent him out on loan to Hitchin until the end of 1980-81. It was a move that would prove fruitful for both player and club. Small scored on his debut against Harrow, earning the headline, “Small is a big hit”. He also linked up well with Giggle and Mahoney. Suddenly, Hitchin’s season had a different look about it.\n\nThe FA Cup run continued with a rousing game with Bedford Town at Top Field. Hitchin won 3-2, a scoreline that flattered the visitors after the Canaries took a three-goal lead, allowing the troubled Eagles two late consolations.\n\nThis meant Hitchin were one game away from reaching the first round proper again and were drawn at home. Their opponents were Sutton Coldfield Town, the West Midlands League champions. On a dismal day, the visitors netted a last minute goal to go through. Hitchin’s Terry Mortimer had earlier missed a penalty. “It was easy to understand why Hitchin’s dressing room was like a morgue after Saturday’s fourth qualifying round tie. They simply threw away the chance of a plum draw in round one and a chance to get back to the glory days of the mid-70s,” said the local press.\n\nThree days later, Hitchin bounced back with one of the most startling performances in their Isthmian League history, a result that “sent shock waves racing through non-league football,” as they visited the impregnable fortress that was Enfield’s home ground.\n\nEnfield were beaten 5-2. They were the reigning Isthmian champions, unbeaten at home and one target for another title. Hitchin were in 17th place and at a low ebb after tumbling out of the FA Cup.\n\nEnfield even took the lead before Small (2), Mortimer and Mahoney (2) scored the goals that beat the Middlesex side. “Brilliant Canaries,” said one headline, while Don Birdsey called it “our finest ever Isthmian result.”\n\nAnother impressive performance followed when Hitchin beat ambitious Billericay Town 3-0 in the FA Trophy. “We played like a dream,” said Freeman.\n\nOff the field, the four leading clubs in North Herts – Hitchin, Baldock, Letchworth and Stevenage – announced an innovative lottery scheme that would benefit the consortium. Unfortunately, the scheme was short-lived.\n\nThere were also problems with the returning winger Colin Barnes, who came back from a stint in Australia and began touting his services around local clubs, despite being under contract to Hitchin. The issue had to be decided at the Football Association, but Barnes, who was top scorer in 1979-80, would never play for Hitchin again. A couple of welcome league victories raised spirits before the FA Trophy tie with Dover, a game that was won 5-2, thanks to a hat-trick from Mahoney.\n\nA superb away display was lapped up by the media. “Hitchin have the scent of Wembley in their nostrils.” But cup success could not disguise the fact that Hitchin were struggling in the league. Two days before the end of 1980, Harlow won 1-0 at Top Field, sending the Canaries to the bottom of the table. This seemed to spur the team on, for results improved almost immediately.\n\nThere was a major new signing in the form of Andy Pearson, who joined from Luton Town. A winger with an eye for goal, Pearson was a contemporary of Gary Sisman and Micky Small and a host of other future Hitchin players.\n\nNeedless to say, more Trophy progress was made with a 2-1 victory over Tooting & Mitcham. It brought a return trip to Boston United, the scene of Hitchin’s 1973-74 FA Cup defeat. This time, Hitchin came away with a 1-0 win, claiming a place in the last 16. It was a brave performance by Freeman’s men, with Folds needing 17 stiches in a head wound and Kevin Hammond limping off injured. The winning goal, ironically given the events of 1973-74, was an own goal. Freeman was buoyant. “Our defence was magnificent….we simply don’t fear anyone in the next round.”\n\nThe draw brought the Canaries a tie with Bangor City of the Northern Premier League. Bangor feared Hitchin’s striking power, notably the way in which Small, Mahoney and Pearson played together. A run of seven league games without a win came to an end at Harrow, who were fourth in the table. All three strikers got on the scoresheet in a 4-0 win, sending Hitchin to Wales in fine spirit.\n\nLike Boston in the previous round, Bangor were old acquaintances, having experience two battles with the Welshmen in the 1976-77 FA Trophy. Hitchin won through that time, but they lost this meeting by a single goal. As in 1977, the road to Wembley ended in the last 16. “Bangor deserved to win, but they did not look as good as the Boston team the Canaries beat in the last round,” said one report.\n\nAn injury-hit Hitchin side lost to a 26th minute goal. Leaving them with the vital task of improving their league position. Two more names had since arrived from Luton in Les Harriott and John Woodward, with the former being the subject of a small fee.\n\nAt the end of March, it was announced there would be no relegation from the Premier Division due to Dagenham and Enfield, both defecting to the Alliance Premier Division (Conference to be). Perhaps it was just as well, for Luton Town, receiving rave reviews on their player, recalled Micky Small to Kenilworth Road. His last game was a 1-0 win against eventual champions Slough, a game in which Mahoney scored his 34th goal of the season, the highest total by a Canaries forward since 1969-70. The league programme ended with no wins in four games and a final placing of 13th.\n\nThere had been some high spots, some great games and some fine individual performances. Hitchin fans would forget the games with Enfield, Dover and Boston in a hurry.\n\nWhat next for Hitchin? That was the question being asked by the Top Field faithful as they looked back on two enjoyable seasons.\n\nAfter a promotion and consolidation in the Isthmian Premier, the Canaries would go on to claim national headlines the FA Cup. But the summer of 1994 was a little uneasy for the club. Steve Conroy, leading scorer in 1993-94, had defected to Stevenage, and the influential Rob Johnson – about to embark on a career in physiopherapy – left to join his home town club, Bedford.\n\nAndy Melvin brought in Ian Rutherford, an honest forward with an average goalscoring record, and the veteran midfielder Stefan Emmanuel. Both struggled to fill the boots of Conroy and Johnson. To make matters worse for Melvin, the experimental “kick-in”, replacing throw-ins, was being tested by the Isthmian League. Melvin was among the fiercest critics of the experiment and his mood seemed to affect the Hitchin team.\n\nHitchin were held on the opening day by Kingstonian at Top Field and a couple of days later, an accomplished performance at Purfleet, highlighted with some fine goals from Ian Scott and Shaun Marshall. But then, for a period lasting some months, the league programme seemed to bypass Hitchin. The team looked to lack fitness and passion and the crowd was getting restless. Furthermore, the team’s discipline was found wanting – Steve Miller, Paul Price and Gary Williams were all sent off in the first half dozen league games.\n\nThe FA Cup offered some respite, but there were some sticky moments in the first qualifying round tie at Newmarket, the bloodstock capital of Britain. The Eastern Counties League side led 1-0 but goals from Tony Caines and Mark McGonagle gave Hitchin a 2-1 win. The winning goal was scarcely a classic and may have been stopped by the Newmarket keeper if the rutted surface had not deceived him. “You lucky buggers,” he said as the final whistle was blown. McGonagle didn’t see the en d of the game having been sent off and it was almost his last contribution of the season as he seemed to drift out of contention.\n\nThe next round was dramatic. With barely a minute remaining against Tiptree United, Hitchin were 1-3 down at Top Field. The home fans were streaming out of the ground, assuming the cup run was over. “I was ready to throw the towel in, give someone else a chance to run the team,” said Andy Melvin. But then, the game – and possibly Hitchin’s season – changed. Gary Williams pulled one back in the 90th minute, but it was still seen as nothing more than consolation. Hitchin dashed forward again and Gavin Covington raced down the flank, crossing for Williams who bravely dived amongst a sea of torsos to equalise. Cometh the man, cometh the hour! 3-3.\n\nThe replay was not quite a formality, but it was certainly comfortable for Hitchin, running out 4-2 winners among the allotments and cottage gardens than fringed Tiptree’s ground.\n\nWhen the pre-drawn FA Cup draw was made in the summer, it looked as though Hitchin would meet Stevenage in the third qualifying round, but Cambridge City surprisingly won 2-0 at Broadhall Way. It set up another exciting tie with Williams coming to the rescue again, making the score 3-3 with just second remaining. The replay was even more compelling, with Marshall scoring two sublime goals and Paul Price, a former FA Cup winner, heading the winner to send Hitchin through to the fourth qualifying round by a 3-2 scoreline.\n\nHitchin’s FA Cup journey took them to Burton Albion with a place in the first round proper at stake. This was one of the great Hitchin away performances, against a team that was riding high in the Southern League Premier. Shaun Marshall tormented the Burton back-line and in the 32nd minute, scored the sort of goal that was becoming his trademark in 1994-95. Hitchin held on to win 1-0, thanks to a superb defensive display and Marshall’s virtuosity to secure a first round place for the first time since 1978. The draw for the first round paired Hitchin with Football League Division Three side Hereford United.\n\nLeague form continued to be erratic but by now, Hitchin had their minds of other things. The game at Hereford captured the imagination of the public and some people felt this may be the Canaries best ever chance of claiming a scalp. Hereford were, after all, scrambling around the foothills of the Football League.\n\nOn Saturday November12 1994, a damp morning, the Hitchin party left for Hereford. The team and officials stopped for lunch at Ross-on-Wye and were treated like minor celebrities. When the floodlights came into view, the buzz on the coach became a noticeable silence. If there were pre-match nerves, it did not show in the game, for Hitchin played with tremendous spirit at Edgar Street and two moments of brilliance by Marshall – in the 29th and 43rd minute – gave Melvin’s side a 2-0 lead. Hitchin’s fans, massed behind the goal, some 500 strong, could not believe their luck. But the second half saw shell-shocked Hereford come out fighting and by the 58th minute, they had made it 2-2. In fact, they may have won the tie had the woodwork not intervened. By the final whistle, the Canaries were hanging on. The replay would create history.\n\nSuddenly, everyone wanted to know Hitchin Town. There was strong demand for tickets and the TV cameras were at Top Field to record a memorable night. Hereford silenced the majority of the 3,098 crowd when they went a goal ahead with a soft header from Steve White. Jon Bone equalised in the 18th minute and the visitors received another blow when Richard Wilkins was sent off. Again, Hereford took the lead, though when Pick headed past Sylvester. After 53 minutes, it all-square again, Williams shooting home from Ian Scott’s perfectly placed through-ball. Micky Wilson gave Hitchin the lead after 62 minutes, a shot from the edge of the area. It was left to Marshall – who else? – to clinch a famous win, running through to shoot home as the crowd invaded the pitch and red flares were lighting up the sky and shrouding Top Field in smoke. As the people ran on, referee Graham Poll took the teams off but in the process, he had blown the whistle to end the game. So 4-2 to Hitchin, the club’s first FA Cup giant-killing.\n\nHitchin would find Wycombe Wanderers, managed by Martin O’Neill, a tougher nut to crack. In fact, the Canaries’ round two opponents punished their Isthmian League hosts by 5-0. Simon Garner, a veteran goal-poacher, scored a hat-trick in front of the BBC Match of the Day cameras. “We were terrified of this game,” said O’Neill. “This could have been a very tricky tie.” It wasn’t – but Hitchin had already had their moment in the sun.\n\nBack to the league, Hitchin strengthened their side in the second half of the season with the acquisition of Richard Wilmot, from Halifax, ex-Luton and Colchester centre half Tim Allpress, and former Northampton full back Ken Gillard. Hitchin lost twice in their last 12 games and after their cup exploits, had the confidence to climb the table. By the time the final game came, a win at Yeading would give them a top five finish. Ian Rutherford’s goal did just that.\n\nIt had been a marvellous season – never-to-be-forgotten cup ties, national recognition, the goalscoring exploits of Marshall (pictured left against Wycombe) – 43 goals in all competitions – and a team that could arguably go on to claim its place among the club’s finest. If only it was that simple…\n\nBBC TV Match of the Day was present at Top Field for the Wycombe game.\n\nHere’s Clive Tyldesley’s’ commentary fact sheet for the game:\n\nThe euphoria that accompanied the 1994-95 season, FA Cup giant-killers for the first time and fifth in the league, quickly evaporated when Andy Melvin lost both Richard Wilmot and Shaun Marshall to Stevenage Borough. It was a case of déjà vu for Melvin, for only 12 months earlier, Steve Conroy had also been snatched up by Borough manager Paul Fairclough after scoring more than 20 goals. Marshall wanted to step up a grade and pursue a dream of playing professional football. “I think Stevenage can get into the Football League,” said Marshall, who had, after all come from his home town club in the first place. The Wilmot move angered Melvin, however. The tall goalkeeper had agreed to stay with Hitchin, but changed his mind. “As far as I was concerned, Wilmot had renaged on the deal and I was livid,” recalls Melvin. “But he wanted to return to Stevenage and for him, it turned out to be a good move as he won a Conference medal.” But for Hitchin, it was another example of the club’s inability to hang on to good players.\n\nMelvin had funds at his disposal as a result of the cup run, so he had the chance to replace Marshall and Wilmot. A player long coveted by Melvin was Stevenage’s own Martin Gittings, a combative forward who scored goals with the same sort of prolifency as Marshall. But he was also 10 years older and carrying injuries. To many, it seemed an ill-timed move and hardly a “like-for-like” swap. Getting a big name goalkeeper was a problem for Melvin, but Gerald Sylvester, who had performed heroics in the FA Cup run, only to lose his place when Wilmot came to the club, was slotted back between the posts. Melvin thought he had pulled off a coup with the acquisition of Conroy, who had struggled since leaving Top Field and soon found himself ousted at Stevenage. With Gittings, Conroy and Williams, Melvin had three strikers of apparent quality. The new combination failed to materialise, however. Gittings pulled up in a pre-season friendly and was barely seen again all season, and Conroy returned heavier, slower and lacking the confidence of earlier years. Nevertheless, Melvin was as bullish as ever, claiming that his team could make a challenge at the top of the table.\n\nThere was to be a rude awakening on the opening day of the new season as Harrow Borough trounced Hitchin 5-1 at Top Field. To make matters worse, Steve Miller and Gavin Covington were both sent off. It was just the start of a poor run that earmarked Melvin’s side for relegation rather than promotion. Hitchin secured just two points from the first six games and were rooted to the bottom of the table. Aylesbury then won 3-0 at Top Field in a shambolic game in which Darren Thompson and Neil Ryan were both sent off. After the game, Melvin resigned, proclaiming that it was time for someone else to see if they could improve the club’s fortunes. Within 48 hours, though, Melvin was back in charge, although there was a collective statement that “changes would be made”.\n\nWithin a week, the club had signed Adam Parker from Stevenage Borough. A precocious player, Parker was released by Stevenage after he had been charged with fraud and seemingly on his way to prison. Paul Fairclough rated Parker one of the most talented players he had managed, but he had a reputation as a l’enfant terrible. It was just the sort of challenge that Melvin liked and his renowned man management skills came to the fore once more. Parker went to prison, but Melvin waited and promised that Hitchin fans would soon see an excellent player in their team. In the meantime, things had improved on the pitch just in time for the return of the FA Cup. Having received an exemption to the fourth qualifying round, Hitchin had to win just one game to get back among the Football League clubs. They did just that, coming from behind to win 2-1, thanks to goals from new signing Lee Burns and old favourite Gary Williams.\n\nThe first round draw gave the club an even bigger game than the previous season had delivered, Bristol Rovers at home. As before, nobody gave Hitchin a chance against Football League opposition, despite the fact that Rovers were not a particulary strong second division outfit. Hitchin had not won at home in the Isthmian League and were in 16th place. They had conceded 16 goals at home in seven league games at Top Field. Rovers were in 13th position in their league. But somebody thought an upset might just occur, judging by the media attention on the day. Within 90 seconds, Hitchin had taken the lead. Ian Scott’s free kick landed perfectly for Conroy and he leapt like he had not all season to head the ball into the net. The players ran behind the goal and joined the fans in celebration. The frame was captured perfectly by Times photographer Marcus Aspland and featured in almost every newspaper the next morning. “Who crossed, who crossed,” came the cry from the press box but veteran Fleet Street man Mike Langley had seen it all in his opera glasses, “The boy Scott”. Before Bristol Rovers could come to terms with conceding so early, Hitchin did it again, Lee Burns latching on to a through ball and curling his shot around the Rovers goalkeeper. The Football League Second Division side pulled a goal back before half-time, but the second half onslaught that many expected didn’t materialise, although Gerald Sylvester, the hero of Hereford, pulled of a string of good saves.\n\nThe victory was enjoyed, although it lacked some of the excitement of 12 months earlier, perhaps because Hitchin had been there before. But Melvin and Conroy were whisked off to London to appear on BBC TV’s Match of the Day to take part in an embarrassing interview with an ill-prepared Tony Gubba. Melvin’s response to most questions as to why he was involved was “Roy Izzard”, the man who introduced him to the club. While the FA Cup was put to one side, Hitchin grabbed four points from two games, drawing with eventual champions Hayes.\n\nThe second round draw had not been kind to the Canaries, an away trip to in-form Gillingham, again from the Second Division. A plucky first half display at Priestfield saw two long range efforts from Ken Gillard shake the nerves of the home side, but three second half goals, two of them from former Stevenage striker Leo Fortune-West, finished off the cup run. With a share of a 7,000-plus crowd, Hitchin had made some cash once more from the competition, which enabled them to bolster their squad. But there was to be no magical second half of the season.\n\nWhen Gary Williams left the club in March, many Hitchin fans were despondent. Williams, after all, had epitomised Melvin’s side of the 1992-1995 period and was hugely popular with the Top Field faithful. Melvin seemed to lose heart in the second half of the season and after a 1-1 draw with Kingstonian, announced that his coach Robin Wainwright had been sacked. In his place was to come a two-man coaching team in the form of Paul Price and Micky Hazard. Price was a familiar figure at the club, arguably the most celebrated player ever to put on a Hitchin shirt. Hazard, of Tottenham and Chelsea fame, came as part of the package and their arrival was seen as a progressive step. “It might get worse before it gets better,” said Melvin, and he was right. Between February and mid-March, Hitchin won just one game in 11 and endured a run of seven straight league defeats. There was still enough momentum to take the Canaries into the last four of the Isthmian League Cup, but Aldershot were too strong and won 3-0 on aggregate over two games. Hitchin won one of their last nine games of the season, sending alarm bells ringing into the summer. It was only the shortcomings of others that prevented them from suffering relegation as with two games to go, in which they lost both, they could still have gone down. Melvin handed over the reins to Price and Hazard in the summer, hoping that fresh ideas could provide the club with the lift it needed."
