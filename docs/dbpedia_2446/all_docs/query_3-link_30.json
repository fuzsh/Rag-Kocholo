        "text": "Trophy Hunt by C.J. Box\n\nMy rating: 2 of 5 stars\n\nSo, I finally got around to reading the fourth entry in C. J. Box's Joe Pickett series. I had found the first three books fairly enjoyable reading, but I have to say this one was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nThe events here take place several months after those described in the third book where the Pickett family suffered a great tragedy when their foster daughter was killed. In this book, Joe and his two daughters seem to have moved on, but the wife, Marybeth, still mourns the little girl.\n\nThe family continues to struggle financially, as they try to live on Joe's meager salary plus whatever Marybeth can earn in her part-time jobs. She has recently started an accounting business and it is around one of her clients, a realty business, that the main action in Trophy Hunt takes place.\n\nThe story opens on an idyllic scene as Joe has taken his two daughters fly fishing on a stream near their home in Saddlestring, Wyoming. It is a beautiful late-summer day and all is well until the family starts noticing dead trout floating in the water and then happens upon a couple who are fishing. The man is apparently catching and releasing fish but doing it in such a way that the animals are traumatized and are unable to recover. Joe attempts to show him what he is doing wrong, but the man is an arrogant idiot who is not inclined to listen. Soon after leaving the couple, Joe makes a horrifying discovery. There is a dead bull moose lying in the edge of the stream.\n\nFinding a dead moose in Wyoming is not an unprecedented event, but this dead moose is different. The animal has been mutilated, part of its face sliced away and sex organs and anus removed. These injuries were obviously not done by the teeth of an animal. They were done with a blade. Moreover, even though the moose has been dead for a while, no scavengers have fed on the body. Very strange, indeed.\n\nIn the area where the moose is found, Joe experiences a strange feeling in the atmosphere. It's something he has never really felt before - a kind of pressure - and he has difficulty describing it even to himself.\n\nJoe has no explanation for what happened to the moose, but he hopes that will be the end of it. Those hopes are dashed a few days later when a small herd of cattle is found dead and mutilated. The sheriff attributes the attacks and mutilations to a grizzly bear, but game warden Joe Pickett knows that the cuts on the cattle were made with a smooth blade, just like those on the moose. This was no grizzly bear.\n\nMore horror is to come. Soon, the bodies of two men are found within hours of each other. They were found in separate locations, separate counties even, but their wounds were similar to those found in the cattle and the moose.\n\nWhat can be happening in the sleepy town of Saddlestring? Is there a Wyoming Jack the Ripper on the loose, one who preys on animals as well as humans? Or is the town being visited by aliens from outer space, little green men who perform experiments on the Earthlings they find?\n\nA task force is formed to investigate. It includes state, federal, and local law enforcement officials and one game warden - Joe Pickett. The task force makes little headway until Joe's intuition and his good friend Nate begin to uncover the pattern to the crimes and a possible motive behind them.\n\nWhen the task force lists all of the possible avenues of investigation, one of the items that goes up on the board is that \"little green men\" theory. Its advocate is the sheriff's deputy.\n\nJoe mentions on different occasions in this story that he doesn't like all that \"woo-woo stuff,\" by which he means the paranormal or supernatural explanations. That being the case, I don't think he would like Trophy Hunt very much because there is a whole lot of that \"woo-woo stuff\" that is left hanging at the end of the tale.\n\nToo many things are left unexplained and it is at least implied that there may be something of the supernatural in the Wyoming forests and mountains. Maybe this is to be continued and explained in the next book, but I didn't like the fact that things were left in such a foggy state here. I don't like my mysteries to leave loose threads hanging all over the place.\n\nView all my reviews\n\nPoetry Sunday: Don't Hesitate by Mary Oliver\n\nHow about we share another Mary Oliver poem? After all, you can never have too many of those. In this one, the poet seems to acknowledge that it is often hard to simply live in and enjoy the moment, perhaps because we are afraid it can't last. She urges us to give in to that moment and fully experience the joy. Although \"much can never be redeemed, still, life has some possibility left.\" Don't Hesitate by Mary Oliver If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don’t hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be redeemed. Still, life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes something happens better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that’s often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don’t be afraid of its plenty. Joy is no\n\nOverboard by Sara Paretsky: A review\n\nThis is the twenty-first novel in the V.I. Warshawski series that Sara Paretsky first began publishing in 1982 with Indemnity Only . I've read them all. I've been a Warshawski fan since the beginning. So for forty years, Paretsky has been writing these books and I've been reading them. And one thing that I have enjoyed about them is that V.I. has aged through them, if not exactly forty years then at least enough to simulate reality. In this latest book, V.I. may be feeling the weight of those years a bit but her passion for justice is undiminished. As often in her cases, a teenager is involved. V.I., the hardboiled detective, has a certifiable soft spot for teenagers. This time it is a teenage girl who V.I.'s dog Mitch finds when they are on a walk around Lake Michigan. The girl is injured and unconscious and has only a faint pulse when V.I. checks her. She calls an ambulance and the girl is taken to the hospital after uttering only one word which seems to make no s\n\nThe Investigator by John Sandford: A review\n\nI have read a few of John Sandford's books in the Prey series featuring Lucas Davenport. This book is a literal offspring of that series. It's the first in a series featuring Davenport's adopted daughter Letty Davenport. Letty is in her mid-20s and a graduate of Stanford. She works for a U.S. senator named Christopher Colles in a desk job but she's bored with her assignments. Then the senator offers her a chance to go into the field as a liaison between his office and the Department of Homeland Security. In her first assignment in that position, she is sent to Texas along with DHS investigator John Kaiser to try to find out what is happening in regard to thefts of crude oil. The senator is not so concerned about the lost oil but wants to know where the money from its sale is going. Who is selling the oil and what they are doing with the profits? The suspicion is that a particularly nasty militia group led by a woman is involved. Letty and Kaiser head out to Texas, de"
