        "text": "LONDON\n\nDRUGS, sex, greed, grotesque behavior: it could only be opera, right? For all its chandeliers-and-Champagne style, opera has long enjoyed a voyeuristic interest in low life. Half its heroines are fallen women: Lulus, Violettas, Manons, briefly flourishing in sin and paying in the end. But opera’s love affair with sleaze takes on a new dimension on Thursday, when Anna Nicole Smith, the buxom Playboy centerfold, celebrity gerontophile and tabloid-culture princess (who died of an accidental drug overdose in 2007) takes to the lyric stage.\n\nIt happens at no less an establishment than the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in “Anna Nicole,” a new opera that bears an adult-content warning on the posters, by the English composer Mark-Anthony Turnage. And it’s not passing without notice. British newspapers have been titillating their readers with the prospect of a night of sung debauchery and moral outrage since the project was announced. And those include publications whose views on opera wouldn’t normally extend beyond denouncing it as something swanky and elitist.\n\n“It’s true,” Elaine Padmore, the director of opera at Covent Garden, said in a recent interview. “We’re getting coverage for ‘Anna Nicole’ in places we wouldn’t expect to take an interest in our productions, though if they think it’s going to be a girlie show, they’ll be disappointed. It may be a tacky subject, but it won’t be tackily staged.”\n\nBut it is a different precedent that has sent the British press into overdrive. For if the life and death of Anna Nicole Smith were not sensational enough as an idea for an opera, the libretto was written by Richard Thomas, the author of the infamously rude and risqué “Jerry Springer: The Opera,” which caused gleeful outrage on both sides of the Atlantic several years ago.\n\nMr. Thomas says that “Anna Nicole” won’t be so robustly scatological, although the Royal Opera warns on its Web site of “extreme language, drug abuse and sexual content.” The site nonetheless described the show as “a celebratory story of our times.” What exactly is it celebrating?\n\n“Er, that’s a mistake,” Ms. Padmore said. “It’s meant to say ‘a celebrity story of our times,’ which is nearer the mark.” The wording on the site has since been changed accordingly.\n\n“ ‘Anna Nicole’ is a parable,” Ms. Padmore continued, “a bad fairy tale about a character so larger than life she becomes surreal. It’s also very funny, although I don’t think it laughs at her. It’s not cruel.”\n\n“Of course,” she replied. “And people never tire of asking, but it’s the wrong question. The process of creating this opera didn’t start with her. It started with wanting an opera from Mark-Anthony Turnage. We talked over a long period about what the subject could be. Eventually he came up with Anna, and it seemed like the right fit for his approach to composition, which is steeped in jazz and the whole idiom of contemporary American music.”\n\nNot that Mr. Turnage is himself a jazzman, or in any way American. At 50 he is one of Britain’s most successful classical composers. His work is championed by the conductor Simon Rattle, and his track record in opera has established him among the few composers today who truly know how to turn music into theater: a matter of gut instinct as well as technique.\n\nThis though he once told me: “I’m not really a big opera lover. I find a lot of it pretty dull, especially the bel canto stuff.”\n\nAnd it is certainly true that bel canto stuff is not his natural world. Born in 1960 in Grays, Essex, one of the drabber satellites of the working-class East End of London, he made his name with music that projected upfront impact with a strident, streetwise edge: hard-hitting but seductive, in the way of desolate urban beauty, and politically aware.\n\nOn one hand it’s conservatory-schooled contemporary music; on the other it’s profoundly influenced by American vernacular, bathed in a smoldering synthesis of rock, soul, jazz and blues. His solo instrument of choice has long been the saxophone. He hero-worships Miles Davis, a devotion that culminated a decade ago in “Blood on the Floor” (he likes strong titles), a piece that combined the improvisational talents of American jazz players with the impeccable craftsmanship of the Ensemble Modern of Frankfurt.\n\nAside from spawning a thousand feature articles about crossing cultural barriers, it touched a raw nerve: it was written in memory of Mr. Turnage’s brother, who had died from a heroin overdose. And it’s not hard to trace a route across the years from “Blood” to “Anna,” which appears to be borne out by his remarks about his new piece.\n\nIn a recent interview he described “Anna” as music “with a nod to Broadway and a ballad Susan Boyle could sing, although there’s not much else in the score you could do with Broadway voices.”\n\n“It’s too complicated,” he added, “and there’s a full orchestra. It’s certainly more tonal than anything I’ve ever written. Act I ends in E flat. I guess you could say it’s a Puccini-size opera with jazz; and we’ve got some amazing players doing the jazz.” He cited his longtime acquaintances Peter Erskine, a drummer, and John Paul Jones, a guitarist from Led Zeppelin.\n\n“Well, I wanted something contemporary,” Mr. Turnage said, “something real, not mythic. Then, after getting nowhere, I met Richard Thomas, and we both, independently, came up with this idea. I wasn’t sure at first, but then I looked into her life and decided its strangeness gave it so much color there were possibilities. It’s a fantastic story.”\n\nThe only question was how much of the story to put in. And there was plenty to choose.\n\nFor those who may not remember, Ms. Smith was a poor girl from Texas who found fame by exposing her surgically enhanced breasts serially and showing there were no depths to which a determined social climber couldn’t profitably sink. At 26 she married an 89-year-old billionaire who obligingly died a year later; she became embroiled in tangled legal actions over the inheritance, then died herself at 39.\n\nIn between, she was a stripper, pinup, small-time actress and reality-TV star. And the highs or lows of her colorful existence included having a Caesarian delivery live on television; appearing in Pietà-style photos with her dead son (who died from a drug overdose in her maternity hospital room); having a whole posse of men claim paternity of her daughter (one of them a masseur married to Zsa Zsa Gabor, Frederic Prinz von Anhalt); and playing the part of an extraterrestrial kick-boxer in a film in which her mission was to save Earth.\n\nYou couldn’t make it up. Except that, in a modified way, making it up is what the authors of the opera had to do.\n\n“Thereafter we’ve stayed as anchored to the documented facts as we can. But of course there’s an element of fantasy, as there has to be in a piece like this. As soon as you put speech in rhyming couplets, there’s a ‘take.’ ”\n\nMs. Westbroek, who sings the title role, confirmed that her instructions were “not to impersonate Anna, which is as well, because I don’t look like her.”\n\n“She was actually very beautiful,” Ms. Westbroek added. “And of course there were those breasts.”\n\nFor the purposes of art, Ms. Westbroek will be wearing a cantilevered chest construction to portray the objects Smith called the source of everything she had, and it won’t make playing the part any easier. Ms. Westbroek, known for heavier roles by Puccini, Verdi and Wagner, is new to contemporary opera, and she admits to finding it a challenge.\n\n“There’s coloratura in the vocal writing, which isn’t my thing,” she said. “I’m onstage almost the whole time, which is exhausting. But I’ve come to love Anna as a character. She had no limits. She was borderless. I don’t see her as monster.”\n\nThe tension dogging “Anna Nicole” relates less to raising the dead than to reinventing the living, including some highly litigious figures. Representing actual people on the stage is a dangerous business. And despite Ms. Padmore’s insistence that “we’ve had people looking carefully into all that,” there seems a sense of barely suppressed panic at the Royal Opera, as if the administrators had only just awakened to the potential consequences of what they have taken on.\n\nMusic journalists, myself included, have been refused access to rehearsals, copies of the score and even a look at the libretto. Neither Mr. Jones, the director, nor Mr. Pappano, the conductor, would talk. And as I write, a photographer sent by The New York Times has been denied official access to anyone involved.\n\nThe stated reason for this battening down of hatches is that the Royal Opera doesn’t want the piece prejudged by speculative, sensationalist gossip before it has appeared. But given an information void, the British press has filled it handsomely with speculation. What, you have to wonder, did the opera’s press representatives expect?\n\nOr was it lawyers? Mr. Thomas said that to show a critic the libretto would count as publication. And recent developments in the Anna Nicole story in American courts suggests that a publication before opening night might be premature. It’s widely thought that significant parts of the text are falling prey to a red pen. “I seem to be attracted to litigious subjects,” Mr. Thomas said, “but I’ve tried to make this one as litigation proof as possible. The story’s public domain, the lawyers have been through everything, so it ought to be O.K. But it’s true that we haven’t made any contact with the people we’ve put in this piece, and we deliberately didn’t. It would have colored it. So far they haven’t made any contact with us either, so we don’t know what’s going to happen. But hopefully the answer is nothing.\n\n“So much of the fuss that’s being made about this piece is groundless. If you took the same story, same scenario, same psychodrama, but instead of calling it ‘Anna Nicole,’ it was ‘La Contesse de Nicole’ and took place in 19th-century Paris, there’d be no problems at all. It’s a perfect story for opera: farcically tragic, utterly excessive. And opera deals with excess well. I know the topicality brings something else. And I do actually take the business of putting these people’s lives onstage seriously. It gives me nightmares. But I console myself with the fact that if it were me, I’d just love someone to put me on that stage. And if I could be sung by Gerald Finley, I’d be very happy.”"
