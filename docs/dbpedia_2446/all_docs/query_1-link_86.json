Sadly, he recently passed away from complications of the disease. Any information concerning this unit...it's awards, commendations, etc. would be appreciated.

A real gut punch. Greg and I had been friends since our early days at the old Defense Intelligence College, when Col Felix Fabian (another great officer who passed far too young) decided to experiment and put us new (prior intel enlisted) lieutenants into major and lieutenant colonel faculty slots that were not being filled. He was a 1989 Distinguished PGIP graduate.\n\nAs a young seventeen year old enlisted man, his first assignment was to the former USAF 6950th Security Squadron at Chicksands. He always spoke fondly of his time in England and exploring Great Britain, especially seeing the Tattoo in Edinburg as a young man on an MWR trip. Later in life, he relished his Scottish heritage, in addition to his Finnish side.\n\nHis memorial service was held at the Veterans Memorial Museum, Chehalis, WA, where he had been volunteering for years and had recently taken up supporting veterans issues. If you are ever in the area, stop in. The people there do amazing things, and on a shoestring.\n\nhttps://www.veteransmuseum.org/\n\nHis initial obituary is in the local newspaper: https://www.chronline.com/stories/in-loving-memory-of-gregory-lassila-1958-2023,330056?\n\nA more complete notice can be found in the Seattle Times: https://obituaries.seattletimes.com/obituary/gregory-lassila-1089158155\n\nPlease pass this on to anyone who might have known Greg. And, if anyone want to swap tall tales about him, please let me know. A number of years ago, I had the great privilege to visit Chicksands and the training center a couple of times.\n\nMany thanks for your help.\n\nWarm Regards, Charles\n\ncharles@charlestmitchell.com\n\nDamien O'Dell (12/12/2023)\n\nI was a Friend of Chicksands and am a former volunteer Tour Guide here.

We were there from 83-86 and 92-94. Angela and our daughters had a wonderful time, replete with many warm memories. I worked on flight at the 6950th during my first assignment and part of my 2nd assignment. I was selected as a PME instructor during our 2nd assignment and reassigned to the 774th Air Base Group. I played various intramural sports that included playing football for the base during 83-86 and helping to coach the women's basketball team during our 2nd assignment. The head coach was SMSgt Tony Flarisee. We attended the gospel service during our 1st assignment and joined the fellowship of other believers at RAF Alconbury for their services during our 2nd assignment there. We really enjoyed the overall experience of being stationed at Chicksands both times. Miss a lot of the cultural things specific to England and most certainly miss the people we got to know both on and off base. Lastly, our taste buds miss the kebabs, markets, fish-n-chips, biscuits and other sweets. Chicksands was a special place. We are thankful for the opportunity to have been assigned there.

He was then just as mysteriously 're-enlisted' right back in the same squadron the very next day of November 25, 1958 as both of these entries indicate Chicksands, England Air Force base. Record entries following right after this show 6952nd RSM which is Kirknewton, Scotland Air Force base. This individual was shuffled between the two bases afterwards. Perhaps it's nothing and maybe just a quick 'geez-shucks' I changed my mind over night type thing and re-enlisted.. After many attempts to determine the classification of this COG (Convenience of Government) thru special FOIA requests with no luck, there was another redundant record which has some of the same dates and entries which was overlooked for some time. These records seem to be kept apparently from different sources back at that time as some are hand-written while others are typed. Whatever the case this shows the discharge for the same incident on November 24, 1958 having some reference numbers as follows; SDN 903-COG AFR 39-14. The AFR 39-14 portion seems to be a standard procedure followed for honorable discharge and is believed to be a general manual procedure reference of some sort. With some internet searches it was determined that SDN stands for Separation Discharge Number sometimes also referred to as SPN. Base on reading some people's inquiries on their own military records, the number itself seems to be quite an 'unknown' on many records like it's some type of hidden code number system within the military. 903 in particular for this case cannot be found anywhere although some other numbers are known and are commonly used on others. Can anyone out there with insight on records from Chicksands and that time period and with better sources determine what SDN-903 may represent? Please write me with any suggestions and thanks for the correspondence I've had from some of you.\n\nbrownpublicrecords@gmail.com\n\nMike Reynolds (11/12/16)\n\nWas stationed at Chicksands from 1968 - 1971.

I still have a friend in Bedford and we see each other every couple of years. I've only been back once....in the early 1990's but my friend has been here several times. Jim Lenz was my NCOIC and I remember going into town with Ernie Maldonado....to the old Peacock Hotel. I used to live on Castle Road.\n\nSkertiss@cox.net\n\nJohnny Brannon (4/11/15)\n\nI was at Chicksands from November 1976 untill December 1977.\n\ncoltmatic@gmail.com\n\nColin Milton (29/10/15)\n\nMy dad, Tom Milton, was stationed at Chicksands during WW2 and later posted to Hong Kong.

In between I had a remote tour at St Lawrence Island, Alaska. I married a woman from Bedford in 1968. It was the best base I was stationed at in 21 years of military service. Many in-laws still live in Bedford.\n\njguy45@hotmail.com\n\nCraig (10/10/15)\n\nNever worked at Chicksands. But as an 80's child I remember being taken on a bus with 9 other children at Christmas and the Americans used to take us Christmas Shopping. It was for poor family's at the time. I'm 37 now and still remember the times. I now as a fully grown adult would like to thank those Americans who read this who may of taken part. You made children of the times Christmas unforgettable without your help me and a few other kids wouldn't not had what we had and Christmas would of had no meaning. So from me and the other kids you help thanks! P.s. Now living in the old Fairfield Asylum building near the new Fairfield Park. It's not haunted I swear! Lol.
