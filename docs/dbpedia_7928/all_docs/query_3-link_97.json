        "text": "In 2005 the municipal council that oversees Pretoria (South Africa's administrative capital) voted to officially change the name of the city to Tshwane. This was met with sustained resistance from various interest groups within the city. This is emblematic of the extent to which place names are vested with historical, political, economic and symbolic value. In addition to protests lodged through official channels, such as the South African Geographical Names Council and parliament, dissent about the name change has largely taken the form of attempts to prevent the use of the new name in public spaces and fora (such as advertising, television, and road signs). This paper explores this material dissent with reference to the landscape of place name changes in South Africa and argues that the resistance has taken the form that it has because of a concerted attempt to prevent the 'performance' of the new name, since this would give the new name validity.\n\nThis study is a study of the Paul Kruger statue located in Church Square, Pretoria examining the extent to which it was used to mobilise the sentiment of being an “Afrikaner” in the twentieth century. A small number of interviews with members of the public was conducted to examine public responses to Paul Kruger statue in 2018 and a conclusion is drawn that the statue is a controversial heritage. Key words: Paul Kruger, memorialisation, Afrikaner nationalism, contestation.\n\nThe aim of this article is to explore the nature of contemporary Afrikaner identity philosophically through the topos of Loftus and the game, the spectacle, and the experience of rugby. I suggest that Loftus Versfeld stadium in Pretoria is a heterotopia for many Afrikaners. The concept of heterotopia, as suggested by Foucault, represents a place where the ideas of utopia and dystopia exist alongside each other. An analysis of Loftus as heterotopia offers a number of novel insights about the place (both physical and mental) that the stadium represents. Loftus acts as a mirror to the lifeworld of Afrikaners, termed here as so-called ’rugbymentality’: Loftus reveals that Afrikaners have moved economically beyond apartheid, but that their political voice has become almost insignificant. Loftus represents the expression of this economic advancement with simultaneous political regression. The result is an invented tradition and postcolonial nostalgia that reveal what it means to be an Afrikaner. Loftus and rugbymentality function as the attempt by Afrikaners either to insulate themselves (laertrek) from postapartheid South Africa, or to become part of the cultural mosaic of South Africa, which could both be expressed through achieving excellence in rugby.\n\nIn South African history, monuments have contributed to both the development and implementation of the apartheid social framework, yet monumental architecture has also continued to redefine the complex cultural narrative surrounding this contested history, offering a path to reconciliation and a new identity. As spaces embedded with specific sociopolitical meanings, monuments offer particular insight into the changing cultural landscape of South Africa. However, the stadium construction for the 2010 World Cup represents some of the first non-memorializing monumental architecture since the first elections almost twenty years ago. They are cultural monoliths of a traditionally egalitarian sport, built amid the tension and complexity of a racially charged society. The renovated Soccer City Stadium in Soweto and five new stadiums – Green Point Stadium in Cape Town, Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth, Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, and the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit – stand as architectural monuments to a “new” South African nation as it attempts to launch itself into the global arena. Innovatively progressive and technologically state-of-the-art, these stadiums were explicitly built to signal South Africa’s entrance as a global leader through design excellence and modern technological prowess. Yet these stadiums also contain stereotypical elements based on patterns of colonialism and exclusion, thus providing a somewhat indistinct narrative that reveals a nation conflicted with issues of inequality, globalization, and domestic conflict. However, this fragmentation ironically reflects the disunity and complex political framework, making this conceptually fractured collection a unique glimpse into South Africa’s living history."
