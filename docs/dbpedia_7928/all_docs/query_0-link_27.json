        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThe Gas Mask in Interwar Germany\n\nExploring the history of the gas mask in Germany from 1915 to the eve of World War II, Peter Thompson traces how chemical weapons and protective technologies such as the gas mask produced new relationships to danger, risk, management, and mastery in the modern age of mass destruction. Recounting the apocalyptic visions of chemical death that circulated in interwar Germany, he argues that while everyday encounters with the gas mask tended to exacerbate fears, the mask also came to symbolize debates about the development of military and chemical technologies in the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich. He underscores how the gas mask was tied into the creation of an exclusionary national community under the Nazis and the altered perception of environmental danger in the second half of the twentieth century. As this innovative new history shows, chemical warfare and protection technologies came to represent poignant visions of the German future.

In the days that followed this assault against Allied troops, the German state celebrated its supposedly successful use of poison gas and Haber was given a military rank with near total control of future chemical weapons development. Historically, Haber’s attack signiﬁed a massive escalation of chemical warfare, which had previously been either rudimentary or conceptual in nature.1 Furthermore, the German release of 168 tons of chlorine gas and the involvement of academic scientists in direct warfare efforts proved an unmistakable turning point in World War I’s larger historical narrative. According to the Allied nations, Haber and the Germans had broken with the previously accepted rules of warfare and now there would be no turning back. While the other belligerent nations began to bring the full weight of their national chemical industries into the war, the Germans maintained their head start, which was subsequently augmented by Haber’s deployment of new chemical weapons such as mustard gas and the German military’s adoption of new and improved gas tactics. However, this initial advantage did not quickly or decisively win the war for the Germans and their new weapons tended to bog down ground troops, thereby entering them into a new and uniquely dangerous form of modern warfare. By 1918, these changes fully expressed themselves through the constant gas shell barrages that created a highly toxic world for the average infantryman. The philosopher Peter Sloterdijk has described Fritz Haber’s use of poison gas in World War I as the birth of a new historical epoch, arguing 1\n\nPoison gas, the term most commonly used during World War I, is one of many chemical weapons. However, not all chemical weapons are gaseous. For instance, mustard gas is a liquid that can become airborne when ﬁred in an explosive shell. Furthermore, more expansive legal deﬁnitions of chemical weapons include all of the technologies involved in the dispensing of poisonous chemicals. This study primarily employs the actors’ term “poison gas” unless it is intentionally and explicitly referring to the more expansive category of chemical weapons.\n\n1\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nthat chemical warfare generated a new subjective relationship to the atmospheric environment. By weaponizing the very air that supported human life, poison gas introduced many Europeans to the central precepts of atmospheric terrorism. Sloterdijk writes: The attack on humans in gas warfare is about integrating the most fundamental strata of the biological conditions for life into the attack: the breather, by continuing his elementary habitus, i.e. the necessity to breathe, becomes at once a victim and an unwilling accomplice in his own annihilation.2\n\nFurthermore, the unique methods of this new weapon forced Europeans to begin considering both the chemical construction of their world and possible methods of protection. For Sloterdijk, such changes represent the birth of the modern mind, since “aesthetic modernity is a procedure of applying force not against people or things, but against unexplained cultural relations (e.g., the previously ignored atmospheric composition).”3 For the historian, the birth of a strictly delineated historical “modernity” is difﬁcult to place in 1915. Nevertheless, there is certainly a strong case for dating the beginnings of certain earth-shattering cultural and social changes to the earliest instances of chemical violence in World War I. For this reason, this historical study of German chemical weapons posits the conscious realization of these potential changes among its historical actors as a speciﬁcally German “chemical modernity,” denoting the distinctive importance of chemical weapons for formulating the contested visions of impending and unseen danger that proliferated in the postwar German world. In the wake of World War I, these contested visions would help to shape and deﬁne Germany’s social, cultural, and political worlds. Debates between antigas activists and the scientists and engineers who previously produced chemical weapons brought poison gas production under intense public scrutiny. It was precisely in this moment of heightened anxiety that a loosely afﬁliated group of scientists and engineers, describing themselves as “gas specialists,” took center stage to assure the German public that protection from poison gas was indeed possible.4 Pulling on their own narration of World War I chemical warfare, these men claimed that\n\n2 3 4\n\nPeter Sloterdijk, Terror from the Air, trans.

The term “gas specialist” is a translation of a variety of German terms that poison gas experts used to describe themselves in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. This included Spezialisten, Experten, Gelehrten, and Fachleute.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nGermans could survive in a world permeated by poison gas as long as they maintained the requisite technology, knowledge, and personal discipline. Through a reliance on distinctly modern technologies, the gas specialists envisioned their own version of a German “chemical modernity” in which the risks of chemical death could be controlled and possibly directed. The inherent dangers of poison gas made it a central concern for interwar scientists and military men who wished to create rational bureaucratic and technological structures that could harness the powers of new military technologies. However, the shifting nature of poison gas and its seeming immateriality ensured that many Germans in the 1920s and 1930s doubted the possibility of such national regulation, let alone protection. Nevertheless, the guidelines and training aimed at producing what interwar experts called “gas discipline” among German citizens ﬁt into high-modernity’s broader attempt to mitigate or control the new risks of modern life.5 In his well-known sociological studies of risk, Ulrich Beck has asserted that such modern projects of rational protection are only possible through a so-called risk calculus that grants political power to legal and governmental institutions in order to combat unforeseen and complex risks, such as global pollution, newly discovered diseases, urban crime, and industrialized warfare.6 In this newly insured world, humans are constantly exposed to, or expecting exposure to, such large-scale problems, all of which were created or exacerbated by the process of modernization itself. In fact, according to Beck, modern humans manufacture the very crises that they then build intricate social structures to counteract.7 For Beck, this is an ongoing social process that appears to be reaching a critical historical juncture. By the late twentieth century, the riskmitigating engineering projects of European society had become far too large and dangerous for individuals to sincerely undertake or understand. Thus, large-scale, high-risk projects of science and technology controlled by intricate bureaucratic structures have become increasingly necessary to protect humanity from widespread catastrophe.8 Simultaneously, the social credibility of these projects is often slowly eroded due to the unanticipated ancillary risks that are invariably part of human-built and\n\n5 6 7 8\n\nMatthias Beck and Beth Kewell, Risk: A Study of Its Origins, History and Politics (Hackensack, NJ: World Scientiﬁc Publishing, 2014), 35–37.

Since World War I, scientists and engineers under the supervision of Fritz Haber had produced gas protection technologies and guidelines in tandem with new battleﬁeld gases. Combined with a commitment to the martial discipline and training of the trenches, gas protection technologies and plans would serve as the gas specialists’ fundamental answer to interwar national poison gas protection. Although national gas protection required massive federal spending as well as constant vigilance and competence from each and every German citizen, the gas specialists’ solutions appeared simple and straightforward. Indeed, practically any call for national technological defense provided the German people with a tangible sense of protection while avoiding reliance on what then seemed impotent agreements of international law. At the same time, these prescriptions were not without partisan interest since gas protection technologies and air raid training would provide the gas specialists with signiﬁcant manufacturing contracts, substantial governmental power, and a new level of professional respect. The gas specialists’ stress on national protection also struck resonant chords with the concurrent desires for rearmament among various militant German nationalists. After their rise to political power in 1933, the Nazis institutionalized the gas specialists’ call to action through the creation of the centralized Reichsluftschutzbund (RLB), or Reich Air Protection League. Total national protection remained a technical impossibility under the Nazis, but the RLB’s effort to universally distribute gas masks after 1937 ostensibly served to provide a material site of individual comfort while simultaneously and collectively militarizing the average German civilian. While some gas specialists expressed concerns over these actions, most were willing to support the measures that made aero-chemical protection a daily concern. As such, the gas specialists easily translated their work to ﬁt under the Nazi regime and brieﬂy thrived in an expanding bureaucratic structure focused on mitigating the risks associated with national aero-chemical defense. 9 10\n\nIbid., 156. Jane Franklin, ed., The Politics of Risk Society (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1998), 25.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nHowever, the ritualized drills of the Reichsluftschutzbund were informed not just by the technical knowledge of the gas specialists but also by Nazi conceptions of national belonging and exclusion. Thus, the RLB’s activities attempted to realize the dream of a distinctly “Nazi chemical modernity,” in which the constant threat of chemical attack was not only overcome through the gas specialists’ technological augmentation and steely determination but also mastered and redirected toward those who had failed to protect themselves from the newly poisoned atmosphere. A wide array of theorists and historians have described the construction of the gas chambers of the Holocaust as the deﬁning moment in the Nazis’ search for a technologically assisted method of mass murder.11 More speciﬁcally, the designing of the gas chambers has often provided the ultimate case study for the potential problems of a blind commitment to the practical application of scientiﬁc knowledge and the search for technocratic efﬁciency. For many prominent post-Holocaust thinkers, such an unquestioned search for an efﬁcient means to an immoral end revealed the dark side of “high modernity.” For instance, in his 1954 book, The Technological Society, the philosopher Jacques Ellul argued that the twentieth century was dominated by what he called “technique,” or “the totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efﬁciency … in every ﬁeld of human activity.”12 According to Ellul, humanity’s reliance on rational thinking and applied science created social conditions that progressively conformed to the smooth and efﬁcient rhythms of the machine. Consequently, Ellul claimed that we had become slaves to the possibility of technological creation, suppressing human freedom and binding ourselves to an increasingly complex and authoritarian technological system. Regardless of the ultimate truth of Ellul’s larger claims, his original insights should encourage us to both historically and morally interrogate the perceived value of technological creation. Frequently, however, proponents of technocratic efﬁciency have skirted such questions by claiming that technological objects and systems can be neither inherently good nor evil.13 According to this view, the ethics of technology are decided not in the moment of creation but in the human use of a given object or system. The early twentieth-century German scientists and engineers who created and promoted poison gas and its various ancillary\n\n11 12 13\n\nKonrad Jarausch and Michael Geyer, Shattered Past: Reconstructing German Histories (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003), 99.

For instance, the interwar gas specialist Rudolf Hanslian wrote, “The High Goddess of Science has a double-edged sword. Depending on the impact of [scientists’] achievements in practice, they can serve the good of humanity or lead to their ruin.”14 In light of the continuing cultural power of such utilitarian claims, techno-skeptical theorists such as Langdon Winner have mounted a response. In his well-known 1977 work, Autonomous Technology, Winner wrote: Is technology a neutral tool to human ends? No longer can an afﬁrmative answer be given without severe qualiﬁcations. The most spectacular of our implements often frustrate our ends and intentions for them. Skepticism greets the promise that our transportation crisis will be solved by a bigger plane or a wider road, mental illness with a pill, poverty with a law, slums with a bulldozer, urban conﬂict with a gas.15\n\nFor Winner, the concept of “use” is often too narrowly deﬁned. Proponents of unrestrained scientiﬁc inquiry and application have traditionally bracketed the moment of technological use in space and time. To their minds, a human picks up a tool and then decides how it should be used. But as Winner argues, technologies are already interwoven into the cultural fabric of humanity before the moment of praxis. Following on the heels of certain Marxist insights, Winner claims that “human beings do make their world, but they are also made by it.”16 Thus, the mere existence of a given technology presents, if not demands, the very possibilities of its use.17 Here, Winner may at times overstate the power of both technological creation and use to shape social structures. In his response to Winner’s work, the sociologist Bernward Joerges reminds us to avoid retroﬁtting dramatic histories of technological creation and application for overly pious parables. To Joerges’ mind, the authorial intentions behind technological creation and use are often indeterminate and highly contingent. These moments of technological employment do not necessarily induce particular social relations, but they do tell us something important about the social relations of a given moment and place. Thus, technologies 14 15 16 17\n\nRudolf Hanslian, Vom Gaskrieg zum Atomkrieg: Die Entwicklung der wissenschaftlichen Waffen (Stuttgart: Verlag Chemiker Zeitung, 1951), 8.

While the technologies behind poison gas inspired various interwar German interpretations that could mix anything from awe and fear to an insistence on practical control, the continued production and use of these technologies required steadfast supporters such as Fritz Haber and the later gas specialists. In their role as technical experts, these men continually claimed that chemical weapons technologies created a more humane and civilized form of warfare that would inevitably lead to greater scientiﬁc progress. Thus, their story reveals the importance of a dogmatic commitment to a vision of scientiﬁc progress and technocratic efﬁciency for the subsequent propagation and uses of such deadly technologies. This ought not, however, suggest that Fritz Haber or the gas specialists should be held historically responsible for the gas chambers of the Holocaust. Rather, it holds Haber and the gas specialists responsible for the interwar proliferation of both chemical weapons technologies and normalized visions of a chemically dangerous world.19 It is this work that inaugurated the many German understandings of “chemical modernity,” including the Nazi vision in which the gas chambers of the Holocaust could be conceived and, to a certain extent, legitimated. For this reason, a simple causative connection between Fritz Haber’s chemical weapons program and the gas chambers of the Holocaust cannot, and should not, be made. Admittedly, one could tell this larger narrative about the gas specialists’ scientiﬁc and technological commitments solely through a detailed developmental history of militarized poison gas. However, gas was a uniquely ephemeral weapon for several reasons. First, it was difﬁcult to detect and describe when deployed. Second, it was never intentionally used on a European battleﬁeld after 1918, thus largely leaving poison gas to the realm of the interwar imagination. The gas mask, on the other hand, provided a material site for civilian interactions with an interrelated web of both offensive and defensive chemical weapons technologies. As such, a study of both poison gas and the gas mask more effectively encourages 18 19\n\nBernward Joerges, “Do Politics Have Artefacts?” Social Studies of Science 29, no. 3 (1999): 424. This also does not mean that Fritz Haber and the gas specialists were the only historical actors responsible for the propagation of chemical weapons technologies or normalized visions of a chemically dangerous world. Indeed, even our current understanding of a chemically precarious world is perpetually reiﬁed by seemingly mundane individual and collective relationships to chemical technologies.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nus to expand our deﬁnition of “the chemical” and to reevaluate technologies intended for protective use that populate daily life. By examining lived experience with the gas mask through German ego documents such as memoirs, diaries, and letters, this project shows that it was often the mask, rather than the gas itself, that introduced interwar Germans to the pervasive presence of technological possibility, mediation, and failure. As Germans grappled both practically and philosophically with poison gas and the gas mask, they contended with an insistent and newly unstable technological world. Since the gas mask was claimed as the ﬁrst line of defense against a weapon that could insidiously permeate the atmosphere at any moment, it further mediated a newly unstable relationship between Germans and their environment. With gassing as an imminent threat in the interwar mind, the simple act of breathing air could no longer be taken for granted. For this reason, the German story of chemical weapons technologies exposes the ways in which the conceptual categories of danger, risk, management, and mastery informed subjective relationships to the environment in the early twentieth century. Of course, the Germans were not the only ones to develop both chemical weapons and corresponding visions of a chemically impregnated world. In the wake of World War I, the English, French, and Americans also developed industrial-scale chemical weapons programs and similarly grappled with the implications of atmospheric warfare. However, none of these other nations were forced to reckon with their chemical poisons quite like Germany. In the early twentieth century, the German nation relied most heavily on ties to its unmatched chemical industry, while Germans themselves experienced a unique level of chemical fear derived from a sense of weakening geopolitical power after the loss of World War I. This produced a more pressing German interrogation of whether chemical weapons could be controlled and, if so, by whom. At the same time, it is also true that these concerns maintain importance for a longer history with near-global reach. For this reason, this study reappropriates the term “Chemical Modernity” in capitalized letters to refer to the longer epoch in which industrial chemicals and environmental pollutants have increasingly yet quietly come to impact, and even sometimes deﬁne, modern life. Since the onset of the Chemical Revolution (around 1770) and the subsequent industrial scaling of laboratory chemistry, work with and among invisible chemicals has changed the ways in which humans understand their environment.20 20\n\nSara B. Pritchard and Carl A. Zimring, Technology and the Environment in History (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2020), 107.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nIn the wake of either the material or theoretical recognition of potentially life-threatening and diffusive chemical compounds, contemporary humanity can no longer assume that the Earth’s atmosphere will always support life. When fully accepting this state of mental uncertainty, potential death can quietly lurk in every breath. The German author Jörg Friedrich makes this clear in his provocative historical treatment of the bombing campaigns of World War II. He writes: Now, through heat, radiation, and toxic gases, the very air was being transformed into something unlivable. The incendiary weapon and the subsequent atomic weapon of World War II introduced the notion of extracting a state of destruction from the workings of general laws of nature. Reality was no longer a place in which to dwell or even do battle. Living space became a death zone.21\n\nHere, Friedrich dates the dawn of “atmo-terrorism,” or the weaponization of the atmospheric conditions necessary for life, to World War II. This is a fairly common claim that is supported by both the sheer death and destruction caused by World War II aerial bombing and the cultural power of postwar atomic fear. Without denying the real human cost of the aerial bombing campaigns of the 1940s, this project both implicitly and explicitly argues that the imagined possibilities for total destruction that would later characterize atomic fear were already present in the 1920s and 1930s. While poison gas could not, in fact, destroy entire cities and nations during this period, contemporaries certainly fantasized about this prospect and began to reevaluate the meaning of individual, national, and atmospheric security. Thus, from “gas psychosis” to “atomic fear” (and now perhaps “environmental angst”), chemical dangers lurking anywhere from the microscopic to the astronomic have come to express a fundamental feature of what it means to be human in the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries. In the newly perilous world described by Friedrich and others, “Mother Earth” is now envisioned as the ground on which the battles of total war will be waged. In coordination with large-scale environmental changes, advances in weapons of mass destruction would seem to suggest that this partially realized form of warfare will soon become a true struggle for mere existence.22 We can perhaps see this unfolding in everything from the use of chemical weapons in recent Middle Eastern conﬂicts to the imagined future wars over clean air and water that the\n\n21 22\n\nJörg Friedrich, The Fire: The Bombing of Germany, 1940–1945, trans.

Thus, atmospheric total war and the questions surrounding human survival will undoubtedly have massive implications for the way in which we now narrate our current moment, our history, and even our future. Since it would seem that we still live under the imaginary power of imminent atmospheric total war, this project refers to the longue durée “Chemical Modernity” in order to make diachronic connections between the climactic German case study and our more contemporary concerns. Speciﬁcally, by reﬂecting on a historical study of German chemical weapons development, it asks us to consider both the historical roots and ultimate implications of large-scale technological ﬁxes for the magnifying problems of modern systemic risk.24 To ultimately reﬂect on such contemporary concerns, the study will follow a largely chronological history of poison gas and gas mask production as well as the developing cultural visions of chemical threat in early twentieth-century Germany. Chapter 1 will begin by historicizing the German development of poison gases during World War I. The chemist Fritz Haber will serve as the central ﬁgure in this story. His commitment to both applied science and the imperial German state informed his advocacy for the development and use of militarized poison gas. Employing ﬁles from German military archives and personal papers from various scientists and soldiers, this chapter narrates the way in which the German military’s decision to employ chlorine gas on the battleﬁelds at Ypres did not shorten World War I but rather generated an arms race in which all belligerent nations attempted to develop the most lethal gases. This military buildup demanded a massive yet efﬁcient apparatus for furthering both scientiﬁc research and industrial production. Haber’s skill in building the most expansive and efﬁcient national chemical weapons program thus serves as one of the earliest instantiations of what would later be called the military-industrial-academic complex and Haber’s government-funded project can be classiﬁed as an early prototype for the nationalized technoscientiﬁc projects of the mid-twentieth century. Chapter 2 provides a developmental history of the modern gas mask, ﬁrst produced in 1915 at Haber’s Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical\n\n23 24\n\nEmmanuel Kreike, Scorched Earth: Environmental Warfare as a Crime against Humanity and Nature (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2021), 400.

The German military’s manufacture of over 8 million gas masks was both an attempt to protect the average soldier from an increasingly toxic world and an integral factor in the continued realization of such a chemically saturated nightmare. If an airborne weapon of total annihilation was to be created after 1915, then it would now need to be strong enough to break the mask’s ﬁlter or seal. By intertwining the historical development of gas with that of the gas mask, the moments in which a speciﬁcally German “chemical modernity” were conceived and pursued begin to come into focus. Chapter 3 utilizes soldiers’ writings to indicate that, contrary to the developers’ view of the gas mask as a life-saving device, combatants were more frequently frightened of both the appearance of the gas mask on others and the physical feeling of the mask against their own skin. While German tacticians hoped to craft chemically resistant soldiers through gas mask training, these newly envisioned “chemical subjects” continued to ruminate on the many ways in which masks could malfunction. Sitting in the trenches, soldiers largely feared both the uncoordinated and creeping nature of gas and the smothering feeling of their afﬁxed gas mask. By examining the sensorial and metaphorical language in a wide array of soldier diaries, trench journals, and troop reports, this chapter seeks to construct the emotive experience of German World War I soldiers as they came to recognize their precarious role in a modern world now seemingly steeped in gas. Chapter 4 examines how German military doctors attempted to treat the injuries caused by poison gas. World War I medical professionals often downplayed reports of gassing by claiming that the affected men had predispositions to pulmonary illness or constitutional weakness. Furthermore, many physicians and psychologists saw what was then termed “gas-neurosis,” or psychological discomfort stemming from poison gas exposure, as an affront to their concept of German national health. Due to both this cultural commitment and a lack of knowledge regarding poison gas exposure, doctors tended to dismiss gas symptoms such as chronic coughing, dizziness, lung inﬂammation, insomnia, and hallucinations that could develop years after initial contact. Much like the scientists who had developed poison gas at Fritz Haber’s Institute, most German physicians continued to view the weapon as something that could be controlled and treated with the proper application of scientiﬁc and medical knowledge. Chapter 5 continues the narrative of German poison gas production into the 1920s. Still tied to Fritz Haber and his protégés, most of this work was either hidden under the guise of pesticide research or conducted in the Soviet Union through clandestine armament deals. Both\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nthis illegal poison gas production and national debates surrounding rearmament inspired a signiﬁcant interwar paciﬁst response. Focusing on the female scientist Gertrud Woker, this chapter evaluates the rhetorical methods paciﬁsts used to critique poison gas research and production. The antigas movement inspired several international disarmament and peace treaties throughout the 1920s, but the enforcement and popularization of these treaties proved difﬁcult as both fears over national security and visions of future aero-chemical war proliferated. Unfortunately for the paciﬁsts, a 1928 gas leak at a Hamburg chemical plant stoked these fears into powerful calls for greater national security, thus encouraging the swift political rise of the so-called gas specialists. Through their gas protection journals and their public demonstrations, this group of scientists and engineers succeeded in putting pressure on the Weimar government to increase its focus on civilian air and gas protection at the expense of international disarmament agreements. Chapter 6 then examines German intellectual understandings of chemical warfare technologies. Several of the most inﬂuential interwar intellectuals were veterans of World War I, having experienced gas attacks and used gas masks during their wartime service. Revealing the salience of poison gas in the interwar imagination, this chapter explores the numerous literary, artistic, and cinematic works that attempted to grapple with the individual soldier’s relationship to chemical weapons. Indeed, the continued contact with relentlessly changing and often dangerous technology such as poison gas and the gas mask exempliﬁed the mental uncertainty and political instability of early twentieth-century Germany. As part of a larger debate surrounding militarized technology, arguments over the controllability of poison gas and the viability of gas discipline most clearly played out in the writings of Ernst Jünger and the joint projects of Walter Benjamin and Dora Sophie Kellner. These three thinkers constructed highly theoretical visions of aero-chemical warfare technologies that neatly represented two of the major political commitments in the continuing debate over Germany’s potential rearmament and the use of poison gas. Chapter 7 examines the writings of gas specialists in their various gas protection journals. Through the publication of articles and books, this group of personally and professionally connected scientists and engineers continued to heighten the German public’s concern for gas preparedness, calling for both increased gas drills and civilian familiarization with gas protection technology. This then created a greater public desire for visible steps toward national protection, including civilian gas mask distribution. The Weimar government’s inability to provide such a large quantity of gas masks, coupled with feelings of national insecurity\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nstemming from episodes such as the 1928 Hamburg gas leak, contributed to the Nazis’ eventual consolidation of power. With the creation of the Reichsluftschutzbund, the Nazis intended to centralize national gas protection services and to dramatize the possibility of aero-chemical attack. As part of this theatrical staging, they attempted to provide gas masks for every German civilian. Practically speaking, this endeavor proved impossible, but the distribution of civilian gas masks was also a way to armor the German populace both visually and psychologically. Citizens who received gas masks were required to always keep them nearby, ready to pull them onto their faces at a moment’s notice. Thus, by forcing the individual to respond to a seemingly imminent chemical attack, the gas mask could ostensibly mobilize the collective power of a Third Reich comprised of “Nazi chemical subjects.” Chapter 8 returns to poison gas, relating the ways in which the Nazis’ efforts in national chemical protection were intimately tied to their search for new offensive chemical weapons. The chapter provides a reading of the Nazi relationship to poison gas and the party’s attempt to realize a speciﬁcally “Nazi chemical modernity” in which poison gas would serve as a litmus test to determine the masters and victims in a chemically precarious world. Without drawing direct lines of causation between the 1915 German deployment of militarized gas and its reapplication in the Final Solution, this chapter explores the rhetorical and conceptual threads that developed across the interwar technological proposals of the gas specialists, the rhetorical racism of Nazi geopolitics, and the attempted chemical genocide in the gas chambers of the Holocaust. Finally, the short conclusion makes broad connections between this German story and the continued contemporary concern for the chemical construction of the environment.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1\n\nThe Structures of Violence: Fritz Haber and the Institutionalization of Gas Warfare\n\nTraditionally, historians have cited the Second Battle of Ypres as the ﬁrst modern use of chemical weapons. According to the most common telling of the story, on April 22, 1915, outside the small Belgian town of Ypres, German troops released chlorine gas toward French colonial soldiers. Military reports claim that the French lines dissolved in panic as men ran choking from the eerie yellowish-green gas that crept toward them. Two days later, chlorine was again used against Canadian troops, who apparently stood their ground among the deadly swirling clouds. The British military claimed that the attacks killed 15,000 men and injured another 5,000, while London newspapers published illustrations of French soldiers in their bright blue uniforms falling to the ground and grasping at their throats.1 Numerous related op-eds decried the German use of chemical weapons as the ultimate breach in military conduct. In response, the Entente powers ordered the manufacture and distribution of thousands of cloth pads saturated with gas-neutralizing chemicals, hoping that this stopgap measure would help their boys withstand the perﬁdious German weapon. While this story certainly creates an evocative image, the realities of the Second Battle of Ypres do not conform to such a stark morality tale. The German chlorine gas was not nearly so effective as the Allied press claimed, and far fewer men were injured or killed.2 Certainly, the attack at Ypres had massive implications for the methods of chemical warfare in World War I, the technological development of the gas mask, and the propaganda war that proved exceedingly important during and after the war, but the strategic military value of the chlorine attack was dubious at best. Furthermore, contrary to the reports of many politicians, military commanders, and common soldiers, this was not, in fact, the ﬁrst use of chemical gases in World War I, and it was certainly not the ﬁrst European 1 2\n\nRudolf Hanslian, Der chemische Krieg (E. S. Mittler & Sohn: Berlin, 1937), 89. The Germans insisted that their medical services only treated 200 gas casualties on April 22 and that only twelve men died.\n\n14\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nProphecies of Poison\n\n15\n\nmeditation on chemical weapons. Rather, Ypres was a partly realized fragment in a long process of scientiﬁc, industrial, and military collaboration that developed through ﬁts and starts in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For precisely this reason, Ypres serves better as a study of the process by which the German military collaborated with and absorbed both research scientists and industrial ﬁrms into its own institutional structures. Certainly, scientists had helped in providing military technologies well before 1915, and national armies had required supplies and armaments from industrial factories throughout the nineteenth century. But Ypres provides us with a moment in which a formerly academic scientist was given a military rank in the hope that his scientiﬁc knowledge could win a war outright. In fact, German military divisions were created, and tactics were drafted to conform to the ideas of a man who had no previous training in military strategy. Through this position, this same scientist was able to strengthen his already intimate connections to the leading chemical ﬁrms in Germany, thus creating a formal German military bureaucracy that encompassed members of the scientiﬁc community and leaders in industrial chemical production. Other industrialized nations copied this same process to a certain extent, but it was the sheer scale, ﬂuidity, and swift development of the German institutional hierarchy that allowed the Germans to dominate in chemical warfare until 1917. Thus, Ypres and the subsequent development of the German chemical weapons program was an important initial step in the realization of what would be later termed the “military-industrial complex,” and the nationalized large-scale scientiﬁc projects that helped to deﬁne the political, military, and scientiﬁc worlds of the midtwentieth century.\n\nProphecies of Poison: International Law before the War In the nineteenth century, most European armies routinely used smoke to both conceal troop movements and to drive sappers out of their mines. Several militaries further considered the use of cyanide on bayonet blades or the deployment of sulfur fumes against city defenses.3 However, none of these preindustrial chemical warfare plans required laboratory or factoryproduced poisons. The development of industrial-scale chemical weapons 3\n\nGuy R.

This process began with scientists’ investigation of the molecular structures of various chemical compounds, toxic or otherwise. In the nineteenth century, industrial and academic projects in the ﬁelds of pharmaceutical drug research and dye manufacturing tended to cross-fertilize with one another, often leading to surprise discoveries of new compounds.4 While both British and French scientists made substantial contributions to the ﬁeld, German chemical concerns dominated international markets in the late nineteenth century through expansive and effective cooperation between industrial ﬁrms, academic institutions, and government agencies.5 German companies such as Bayer AG, BASF (Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik), and Hoechst AG grew from small dye works to massive chemical ﬁrms.6 This was due largely to a favorable national patent system, supportive universities, and an advantageous geographic position on the Rhine River, downstream of the large steel and coal sites of the Ruhr Valley.7 By 1913, German chemical production was valued at approximately 160 million dollars, out-producing its closest rival, the United States, by more than 60 million. Germany further exported about 28 percent of the world’s chemicals, outpacing its nearest rival, Great Britain, by 10 percent.8 The massive growth of the three largest companies and the German chemical industry more broadly also led to a stockpiling of chemical resources that could be isolated or synthesized. For instance, dye manufacturers such as Bayer, BASF, and Hoechst amassed large stores of chlorine as a byproduct of their dye production. The industrial scale of chemical stores encouraged greater consideration of their potential role in any future industrial use.

The conference, initiated by Czar Nicholas II of Russia, was aimed at both setting an international standard for the rules of warfare and creating an overarching international body for adjudicating disputes between member states. Twenty-six nations, including all major European powers and the United States, signed three main treaties and three additional declarations on July 29, 1899. Convention II with Respect to the Law and Customs of War on Land included a prohibition on the employment of “poison or poisoned arms.”10 The second declaration further prohibited the “Use of Projectiles the Object of Which Is the Diffusion of Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases.”11 Still more regulations prohibited “treacherously” killing or wounding enemies and employing “arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.”12 All present nations except the United States, which saw these statutes as attempts to weaken the military ingenuity of newly industrial powers, subsequently ratiﬁed the conventions.13 They entered into force on September 4, 1900. Four years later, US President Theodore Roosevelt proposed a Second Hague Conference that intended to expand upon preexisting agreements and to create similar settlements for naval warfare. Continued international unrest, especially related to the Russo-Japanese War and the First Moroccan Crisis, delayed the conference until 1907 while simultaneously reafﬁrming the importance of international legislation and mediation. The prohibition of the use of “poison or poisoned arms,” now moved to Convention IV, remained in the new treaty’s language. Attending states signed the new set of agreements and declarations on October 18, 1907, and enacted them on January 26, 1910. Simultaneously, the British pushed to create national limitations on armaments and to set up a court of arbitration for international disputes. But it was the Germans who now mustered enough support to defeat 9 10 11 12 13\n\nJohn J.

In many ways, these diplomatic discussions revealed the growing political struggle between Britain and the newly emerging industrial powers of Germany and the United States. But regardless of their omissions and limitations, the Hague Conventions appeared as a successful means by which international diplomacy could limit the scale and ferocity of future conﬂicts. In the case of poison gas, the wording of the declaration appeared unequivocal at the time. While Europeans had never actually experienced industrialized chemical warfare, they made it clear that they preferred to proactively censure and prevent any future considerations.\n\nLeviathan Wakes: Chemical Applications in the Early Stages of World War I At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the major belligerents quickly mobilized their national chemical manufacturers for military production. But early intentions were primarily restricted to uniform dye manufacturing and explosives production. Moreover, in the initial stages of ﬁghting, the aforementioned large German chemical ﬁrms had little desire for war. Industry leaders such as Carl Duisberg, the CEO of Bayer, knew that warrelated restrictions on exports would signiﬁcantly hurt their bottom line. It was precisely this strong economic desire to avoid war that left ﬁrms such as Bayer relatively unprepared in 1914.14 Nevertheless, the combined industrial force of the large German chemical ﬁrms was able to supply the German War Ministry with almost all its initially required materials. The same could not be said for the Allies who realized the unsatisfactory state of their own national chemical industries after losing access to German products.15 Both Britain and France scrambled to import dyes 14 15\n\nCarl Duisberg, Meine Lebenserinnerungen, edited by Jesco v. Puttkamer (Leipzig: Philipp Reclam, 1933), 98. The success of the German chemical industry in its collective war effort has been largely attributed to the standing cooperation between various ﬁrms before the war and the centralization of war production by the German government. Agfa, BASF, and Bayer had already formed a loose cooperative group in 1904 referred to as the “little IG.” In the same year, Hoechst, Casella, and Kalle formed a Frankfurt am Main regional alliance. In 1914, the Germans created the KRA, or War Material Department, which served to centralize and streamline the chemical industry’s war effort until the institution of the Hindenburg Program in the summer of 1916. This centralization was furthered in late 1915 and early 1916 when the IG group expanded to include more ﬁrms and to share knowledge and methods related to war production. Jeffrey Allan Johnson, “Technological Mobilization and Munitions Production: Comparative Perspectives on\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nLeviathan Wakes\n\n19\n\nfrom Switzerland while concurrently setting up government supply boards and kick-starting newly nationalized dyeworks.16 The supply of nitrogen, an essential component for explosives, was a different story for the Germans. Prior to the war, German ﬁrms imported about one-half of their required nitrogen from places such as Chile. The war’s trade embargos and the British naval blockade now cut German industry off from their foreign nitrogen sources. This left the nation with slightly less than 140,000 tons of nitrogen at the start of the war, essentially setting a limit on its ability to produce artillery shells and bullets.17 In September 1914, the academic chemists Emil Fischer and Fritz Haber made the German War Ministry painfully aware of this shortage and pointed to the BASF plant at Oppau and its newly implemented HaberBosch Process as a solution to German deﬁciencies.18 In 1909, Fritz Haber and his laboratory assistant Robert Le Rossignol had ﬁrst succeeded in producing ammonia from nitrogen in the air using high-pressure devices and various catalysts. In 1910, the chemist Carl Bosch scaled Haber’s process for industrial production at BASF.19 By 1913, the BASF plant had a production capacity of 36 tons of ammonia per day and a store of 7,200 tons of synthetic nitrogen. The company increasingly raised its production capacity over the course of the war and the growth in demand from the German military led to the construction of a second production site at Leuna in 1917. By the end of the war, the Haber-Bosch process accounted for almost 50 percent of Germany’s nitrogen production, certainly saving the Germans from early surrender.20 Furthermore, the success of the Haber-Bosch process set the tone for future scientiﬁc aid to the German state. Hailed as a major national contribution that could be easily converted to peacetime applications, Haber’s synthesis of nitrogen suggested to many in the scientiﬁc community that wartime research and production was indeed a major boon to the longer process of incremental scientiﬁc discovery and, by extension, the progress of humanity.\n\n16 17\n\n18 19 20\n\nGermany and Austria,” in Frontline and Factory: Comparative Perspectives on the Chemical Industry at War, 1914–1924 (Dordrecht: Springer, 2006), 3–10.

Nevertheless, the French did ﬁnd the ﬁrst direct battleﬁeld application for the products of industrial chemistry.21 Beginning in 1913, French scientists in André Kling’s Laboratoire Municipal ﬁrst produced what were then called cartouches suffocantes (an early form of tear gas projectiles). These cartouches suffocantes were intended to be used as a method of civilian riot control that could skirt the restrictions of the Hague Conventions.22 The French military claimed that this tear gas was not strictly poisonous, and its stated aim was paciﬁcation through irritation of the eyes, skin, and lungs, rather than outright destruction.23 Furthermore, the ethyl bromoacetate inserted into the projectiles was not a gas but rather a liquid that was aerosolized on impact.24 As early as August 1914, the French military ﬁlled riﬂe projectiles with this newly developed tear gas and ﬁred it at German lines. However, these ﬁrst projectiles reportedly created such a weak gas cloud that German soldiers rarely noticed it. Nonetheless, the French continued to intensify the effect of their tear gases and to develop their gas grenades through 1915.25 As tear gas developed, ofﬁcial German troop reports began to differ on its effectiveness. Reﬂecting on ﬁghting in the Vosges mountains in December 1914, the German infantryman Waldus Nestler wrote, “[The French] had thrown hand grenades or shot riﬂe grenades shortly before the attack, spreading a fog that brought tears to the eyes … When we heard this, we were penetrated with a terrible feeling. What a nasty weapon that was now being used! What a terrible form of warfare!”26 The suffering of soldiers like Nestler would certainly suggest that this tear gas was effective and the French military continued its research and production. By January 15, 1915, German Captain Hermann Geyer was reporting that the French used 12 tons of tear gas grenades in a particular engagement. By April of that same year, the French army provided its soldiers with the improved Bertrand No. 1 tear gas grenade, which was said to be more effective in trench warfare conditions.27 And by the end of the war, Captain Geyer was 21 22 23 24 25 26 27\n\nSophie Chauveau, “Mobilization and Industrial Policy: Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals in the French War Effort,” in Frontline and Factory, 21.

Unlike the French, however, most British military ofﬁcials initially returned to nineteenth-century visions of smoke screens and sulfur dioxide attacks. While these ideas were not immediately realized, the British did begin irregular testing of chloroacetone, benzyl chloride, and other tear gases.29 However, the British War Ofﬁce chose not to create dedicated chemical weapons laboratories until after the Germans had already unleashed their own chemical weapons. Indeed, the British appear to have been the most unwilling to develop and use chemical weapons, perhaps because they had the most invested in the international legislation that previously banned them. In fact, under the command of Lord Herbert Kitchener, the British military even hesitated to retaliate against the Germans in 1915, citing the already disregarded restrictions in the Hague Conventions.30 It was only after the completion of a scientiﬁc investigation and a government report on the German chlorine attack that the British began to form a gas warfare service. This so-called Special Brigade was placed under the leadership of Major Charles Howard Foulkes of the Royal Engineers. By the summer of 1915, both the British and the French had organized their gas warfare divisions and began readying their own offensive gas attacks.31 Like the Allies, the Germans also studied the effects of chemical agents before the outbreak of World War I. However, according to the German artillery specialist, Colonel Max Bauer, these tests demonstrated that chemical weapons had little military value.32 This initial futility impeded 28\n\n29 30 31\n\n32\n\nGerman Captain Hermann Geyer was an important staff ofﬁcer for Colonel Max Bauer. He drew up several of the attack plans for German gas pioneer troops and contributed to the tactics used in the Kaiser’s Offensive of spring 1918. After the war, he wrote several tracts on chemical warfare, was promoted to General, and served under the Nazis in World War II. Geyer-Denkschrift über den Gaskampf BA-MA N/221.

Throughout the war and into the\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n22\n\nThe Structures of Violence\n\npreliminary research, development, and employment.33 Furthermore, historian Eric Dorn Brose has pointed out that sociocultural conﬂicts, waged in the Prusso-German army from 1871 to 1914, also retarded the employment of new military technologies such as chemical weapons.34 With the development of modern technologies such as artillery guns, machine guns, and riﬂes, the future tactics of the German military became a site of contestation between representatives of different military branches. According to Dorn Brose, artillery and army engineering ofﬁcers largely favored an embrace of these new warfare technologies, which they saw as both the key to future battleﬁeld successes and an avenue to new personal prestige and institutional standing in the military. On the other hand, the cavalry, which had previously enjoyed the greatest honor and esteem in the Imperial German Army, feared its obsolescence in the face of technologies that could destroy a cavalry charge in mere minutes. Infantry ofﬁcers similarly distrusted many new battleﬁeld technologies, in part for their potential to shake up the preexisting military hierarchy but even more for their demonstrably violent effect on the common soldier’s body. As such, representatives from both the cavalry and the infantry used three major arguments to criticize and prevent the increased use of new technologies on the battleﬁeld. First, they claimed that many technologies (like early tear gas) often failed to work as desired; these tools could not be trusted to achieve a desired tactical outcome. Second, certain technologies were not part of the inherited rules of war, either because they were prohibited by international treaties such as the Hague Conventions or because they simply broke with military tradition. Third, they insisted that battles were won and lost through sheer willpower. According to many cavalry and infantry ofﬁcers, it was both the discipline and the élan of men that decided victory.35 Given the entrenched status and privilege of the German cavalry and infantry, these arguments apparently succeeded in holding off serious military engagement with many previously untapped areas of industry and science until the fall of 1914. This status quo ﬁnally changed in\n\n33 34 35\n\n1920s, Bauer served as a vital link between the German military, heavy industry, and nationalist political groups, allowing him to also play a central role in the creation and production of poison gas.

The loss at the Marne prevented the Germans from continuing their march toward Paris and induced them to dig into their positions on the Western Front, setting the stage for the years of trench warfare that would follow. Disgruntled factions of the ofﬁcer corps began searching for someone or something to blame for this unexpected military failure. High-ranking advocates of new military technologies such as Colonel Max Bauer attributed the setback to the army’s willful avoidance of technological change, stating that the days of cavalry charges were now over.36 The subsequent removal of General Helmuth von Moltke as chief of the general staff, the appointment of Lieutenant General Erich von Falkenhayn, and the reevaluation of German tactics in late 1914 now opened the door for a new breed of ofﬁcer who either promoted or quietly accepted the arrival of new military technologies on the battleﬁeld. Besides the German army’s broader acceptance of new military technologies, Erich von Falkenhayn decided to seriously revisit the possibility of employing chemical weapons for three distinct reasons. First, as the war on the Western Front became less mobile, the Germans sought any technological advantage that might break through the Allied lines. Reports from the front stated that traditional shells and explosives were not completely effective in destroying entrenched enemy positions. Second, facing a shortage of steel in 1915, the Germans were forced to manufacture their artillery shells using cast iron. Because cast iron was weaker than steel, German shell walls were so thick that they did not allow much space for interior explosives. German High Command hoped to ﬁnd an alternative shell ﬁlling that could expand outward from such a small container.37 Third, in early fall of 1914, the Haber-Bosch process was not yet fully integrated into industrial war production. The Germans were still facing a rapidly diminishing supply of nitrogen and, 36\n\n37\n\nMany of the technological progressives like Bauer were ofﬁcers in the artillery or army engineer corps. In contrast to the often-aristocratic cavalry and infantry ofﬁcers, these men were largely of middle-class origin. This difference is important for explaining the sociocultural changes occurring in the German military during this period. Middle-class men could hope to achieve greater military and societal standing by entering a branch of the army that required a level of practical scientiﬁc education and allowed for advancement through the application of specialized knowledge. This prerequisite education then helped to foster connections between these branches of the military, academia, and industrial ﬁrms.

Chemical aerosols and gases appeared as a possible replacement that could be abundantly produced by a preexisting German industry.38 As early as September 1914, Falkenhayn had already given Colonel Max Bauer orders to reinvestigate the applicability of chemical weapons on the Western Front. A month later, Bauer gathered a group of scientists and army ofﬁcials at the Wahn artillery range outside of Cologne to discuss the creation of a new chemical shell that could dislodge entrenched enemy positions.39 Proposed by the internationally renowned academic chemist, Walther Nernst, the ﬁrst experimental weapon produced a nonlethal nasal irritant that could be ﬁred in a standard shell casing.40 The German military ﬁrst deployed 3,000 of these so-called Ni-shells on October 27 at Neuve-Chapelle.41 However, they apparently had so little effect that French soldiers later reported that they never detected the chemical irritant. Indeed, according to a popular story, the gas was so weak that General Falkenhayn’s son won a case of champagne after betting that he could stand in a cloud of Ni-shell irritant for ﬁve minutes.42 The German army received 20,000 of these Ni-shells before the project was deemed a total failure.43 By November of 1914, Bauer’s chemical research committee had moved on to a suggestion from the chemist Hans Tappen.44 Tappen proposed ﬁlling artillery shells with the liquid irritant xylyl bromide to create an effect similar to that of the French tear gas grenades. Bauer was initially skeptical of shells ﬁlled with liquid, but Tappen eventually proved the feasibility of such a weapon by testing them on himself.45 These so-called “T-Shells” were ﬁrst evaluated at the Kummersdorf artillery range outside Berlin and then again at Wahn in January 1915.46\n\n38 39\n\n40 41 42 43 44\n\n45 46\n\nWerner Plumpe, Carl Duisberg 1861–1935: Anatomie eines Industriellen (Munich: C.

The chemical ﬁrms of Bayer, Hoechst, and the Kahlbaum factory in Berlin were contracted to produce the T-Shells and only a few weeks later, they were issued to Colonel-General August von Mackensen’s Ninth Army on the Eastern Front.47 Mackensen was ordered to produce a diversion with the gas shells, while Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg arranged for a major offensive against Russian troops. In preparation for the diversionary chemical attack, German soldiers were outﬁtted with cotton pads that could be tied in front of their mouths and noses. The pads were moistened with a chemical retardant that had to be reapplied regularly. On January 3, 1915, the Germans attacked Russian troops at Bolimow, between Lodz and Warsaw. The T-Shells were ﬁred into the Russian lines, but the cold weather suppressed the xylyl bromide and the shells had little to no effect.48 Returning to the drawing board, Tappen added bromoacetone (B-Stoff) to the shells to prevent their failure in cold weather.49 These new T/B-Shells were then sent to Duke Albrecht of Württemberg and his Fourth Army in Flanders. In the early spring of 1915, the new T/B-Shells also achieved little effect at Nieuport and in the region surrounding Ypres. This encouraged Bauer’s advisory committee to turn its attention toward yet another potential chemical weapon that had been in development since December 1914 under the direction of the chemist Fritz Haber.\n\nA Devoted Man of Science: The Early Life of Fritz Haber Fritz Haber was born in 1868 in Breslau, Prussia, to a wealthy Jewish family whose collective story reﬂected that of many upwardly mobile Jewish families in the German-speaking lands of the late nineteenth\n\n47\n\n48 49\n\nBy the autumn of 1915, the Bayer and Hoechst dyeworks were transitioning much of their industrial production to war purposes.

The extended Haber family ﬁrst made their money as wool merchants in Kempen, but by the time Fritz was born, they had obtained respected positions in politics, law, and other lines of mercantile business. Fritz’s father, Siegfried Haber, owned a successful ﬁrm that sold pharmaceuticals, dyes, resins, oils, fats, and paints.50 Siegfried reportedly had a loving relationship with his wife, Paula, who died giving birth to Fritz. According to biographies of Haber, Paula’s early death created a lasting rift in the relationship between Siegfried and Fritz and the young boy was quickly given over to the care of his aunts. As a child, Fritz also developed a close and affectionate relationship with his stepmother, who eventually became his primary caregiver. While the Haber family remained tightly tied to the broader Jewish community through family connections in Breslau, they were not noted as particularly religious or observant Jews. Consequently, young Fritz was sent to the Johanneum primary school and the St. Elizabeth Gymnasium, both of which were open to students of different religious backgrounds who desired a humanistic education in the German tradition. While Fritz was not noted as a particularly gifted student while attending either of these schools, he nevertheless passed his gymnasium exams at St. Elizabeth’s in 1886. Upon graduation, Fritz’s father preferred that his son remain in the family dye trade, but the notably gregarious boy saw university as a path to the wider world. With grudging assent from his father, Fritz attended Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin to study chemistry, a ﬁeld that could prove valuable to the family dye trade. In Berlin, Haber was initially disappointed with the work of his advisor, the chemist A. W. Hofmann.51 This encouraged him to ﬁrst transfer to Heidelberg University in order to work under Robert Bunsen for the duration of the 1887 summer semester. He then moved back to Berlin to attend the Technical College of Charlottenburg for the remainder of his degree.52 In the summer of 1889, Haber’s studies were put on hold so that he could serve a one-year term of Prussian military service in the Sixth Field Artillery Regiment back in Breslau.53 Haber was immediately attracted to the military lifestyle, and he continued throughout his life to\n\n50 51\n\n52 53\n\nSiegfried Haber’s company was one of Germany’s largest importers of natural indigo.

He was a cofounder of the German Chemical Society in 1867. Most known for his development of the Bunsen burner, Robert Bunsen (1811–1899) was a pioneer in photochemistry. Volunteer service was normally three years, but Haber only served one because his father was willing to pay for his horse and military equipment. This was a common practice for wealthier families in Prussia.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nA Devoted Man of Science\n\n27\n\naffect the clipped but informative speech, upright posture, and brisk marching gait that he picked up in service. In fact, he was so pleased by this new lifestyle that he competed for an ofﬁcer’s commission with the intention of ﬁnding a permanent career in the military. While Haber apparently did prove himself worthy enough to become a serious candidate for the commission, he was ultimately passed over. Greatly affected by this disappointment, he believed that his Jewish background had hurt his candidacy, as no Jew had ever been selected as a reserve ofﬁcer in a combat service. After this difﬁcult personal failure, Haber returned to the Technical College of Charlottenburg to begin studying organic chemistry under Carl Liebermann.54 In 1891, he ﬁnished his thesis on the derivatives of piperonal and received his doctorate from Friedrich Wilhelm University.55 With a degree in hand, Haber returned to Breslau to honor his agreement and work in his father’s chemical company. Once home, Fritz continuously fought with his father, eventually choosing to spend most of his time in practical apprenticeships at distant chemical factories. Feeling that his poor relationship with his father would always lead to conﬂict, Haber ﬁnally left the family business in 1892 and took an academic position as an unpaid assistant under the chemist Ludwig Knorr at the University of Jena. Over the next two years, Knorr assigned Haber to repetitive laboratory tasks that he quickly came to resent.56 While Haber’s scientiﬁc work in Jena was relatively uneventful, he did undergo one major personal change. In November of 1892, Haber converted to Protestantism. It remains unclear exactly why Haber chose to convert, but this move certainly helped him to secure a place in the academic world. Finding an Assistent position would have been made undoubtedly more difﬁcult by the obstacles put in place to bar Jews from the academy. Whatever the combination of motivations, most theories about the nature of Haber’s conversion argue for a practical cause rather than a real change of faith.57 In fact, Haber’s personal doctor and close\n\n54\n\n55 56\n\n57\n\nCarl Liebermann (1842–1914) was a student of Adolf von Baeyer, taking over his chair in organic chemistry at the University of Berlin once Baeyer left for the University of Strasbourg in 1870. The Technical College of Charlottenburg was not yet able to grant doctoral degrees so Haber received his from the Friedrich Wilhelm University. Ludwig Knorr noticed the young Haber’s resentment and thought little of his work. Haber, in turn, wanted to switch to physical chemistry and work with Wilhelm Ostwald. He was granted a meeting with Ostwald in 1893, but this did not lead to a place in his Leipzig laboratory. Morris Goran, The Story of Fritz Haber (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1967), 16. Only Haber’s second wife, Charlotte, claimed that Fritz converted based on religious convictions, even though Haber rarely attended church. Charlotte also believed that the conversion may have been Fritz’s way of symbolically breaking from his father.

Stern claimed that Haber sincerely desired to become more “authentically German” and to profess his loyalty to the Imperial Reich through his religious profession.58 Certainly, through his early education and his time in the military, Haber had become a staunch German patriot with a particularly strong desire to align himself with the imperial regime. As such, Haber’s godson, Fritz Stern, once described him as “German in every ﬁber of his being, in his restless, thorough striving, in his devotion to friends and students, in his very soul and spirit.”59 In the spring of 1894, the recently converted Haber was ﬁnally able to leave Jena after obtaining a paying Assistent position at the Technical University of Karlsruhe. Karlsruhe was not a major center of academic chemistry at the time, but it did have strong funding avenues through ties to the BASF chemical company in nearby Ludwigshafen. Once situated in Karlsruhe, Haber’s two main advisors, Carl Engler and Hans Bunte, gave Haber a great level of research freedom.60 This allowed him to move into the ﬁeld of electrochemistry, where he gained attention for his reportedly tireless work ethic. Haber slowly built a name for himself through research in both organic and electrochemistry in the late 1890s and early 1900s, and in 1906 he received a full professorship in physical chemistry. Upon taking up his university chair in Karlsruhe, Haber and his Assistent Gerhard Just began an exceptionally varied research agenda that brought signiﬁcant recognition and widespread approval to his laboratory. By 1908, Haber was concentrating on nitrogen ﬁxation and signing a collaborative contract with BASF. This work would ultimately garner Haber his ﬁrst taste of national renown and the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. On the eve of World War I, Haber thus stood in a fortuitous position between the academy and industry, between the worlds of “pure science” and technological application.\n\n58 59 60\n\nCharles, Master Mind: The Rise and Fall of Fritz Haber, the Nobel Laureate Who Launched the Age of Chemical Warfare (New York: HarperCollins, 2005), 28–29.

As early as 1905, the celebrated German chemists Emil Fischer, Walther Nernst, and Wilhelm Ostwald had sought to create a national chemical research institute that would be able to foster academic collaboration on large-scale research projects.61 They set up an association to solicit funds for the new “Imperial Chemical Institute,” and while they received donations from individual scientists and industry leaders, they failed to obtain backing from the Prussian Ministry of Finance. The nascent plan was then renewed in 1908 with the intention of including various other areas of natural science in a larger research organization that would be called the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft (The Kaiser Wilhelm Society or KWG). The Society, originally envisioned as the German version of Oxford University, would now operate independently of the German academy. However, it was still intended to foster signiﬁcant research connections between academics, especially at Humboldt University in Berlin. Fischer reallocated the funds originally collected for the standalone chemical institute to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society and requested that one-third of the annual budget go to physical chemistry. The Prussian Ministry, however, remained hesitant to proffer state funds, and it was unclear whether the KWG could strictly operate on private donations. As late as September 1910, the Prussian government was unsure if it would provide ﬁnancial support, even though Kaiser Wilhelm II was set to announce the opening of the scientiﬁc society in October of that year. At a September 17th organizational meeting, a wealthy Saxon banker named Leopold Koppel assisted with the KWG funding problem by agreeing to independently fund the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical and Electrochemistry (KWI), a subsidiary physical chemistry institute within the overarching Kaiser Wilhelm Society. Koppel had made his money through the ownership of several hotels, an independent banking ﬁrm, and a gas light company that he started in 1892 with the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. Located in Berlin, the gas light company\n\n61\n\nAt the time, Emil Fischer (1852–1919) was the Director of the Institute for Chemistry at the University of Berlin. Walther Nernst (1864–1941) was the director of the Institute for Physics at the University of Berlin and the major scientiﬁc rival of Fritz Haber in the ﬁeld of organic chemistry. Wilhelm Ostwald (1853–1932) was the director of the Institute for Physical Chemistry in Leipzig.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009314862.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n30\n\nThe Structures of Violence\n\nwas named the Deutsche Gasglühlicht-Aktiengesellschaft (Degea), later changed to the Auer Gasglühlicht Gesellschaft, or Auergesellschaft.62 The Auer company primarily worked with gas mantles, luminescence, rare earths, and radioactive materials. It was this work that brought Fritz Haber to the Auer ofﬁces in Berlin as a research consultant. From the moment of his arrival, Haber greatly impressed Leopold Koppel and the two men quickly became friends.63 They shared not only professional interests in the ﬁeld of physical chemistry but similar personal backgrounds. Koppel, born Jewish, converted to Christianity both to marry his wife and to garner future business advantages. Between 1908 and 1910, Koppel attempted to woo Haber to a permanent position at the Auer company. Haber repeatedly declined these offers, stating that he was pleased with the scientiﬁc freedom that he enjoyed in Karlsruhe. Koppel was not easily deterred, however, and he saw several business opportunities in providing the initial 1 million Reichsmark endowment for the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry.64 First, Koppel made sure that the KWI could apply for scientiﬁc patents, which could then be inexpensively licensed to his Auergesellschaft. Second, the KWI was another avenue for bringing Haber closer to the Auer factories in Berlin. By asking Haber for his employment demands in 1910, Koppel made it clear that he intended to install Haber as the head of the newly founded institute. Expecting that his requests would be too great and that he would remain at Karlsruhe, Haber stipulated that the KWI had to be made a ﬁrst-rate research institution. Thus, Haber required a sufﬁciently large budget, total control over hiring, a professorial position at the University of Berlin, membership in the Royal Prussian Academy, a tenured position as a state ofﬁcial, the transfer of his Karlsruhe research assistants, and an annual salary of 15,000 Reichsmark. To Haber’s surprise, Koppel agreed to these hefty demands and Haber was installed at the head of the KWI for Physical and Electrochemistry in the summer of 1910. Two months later, Kaiser Wilhelm II gave Haber the title of Geheimer Regierungsrat (privy councilor). Haber, now a leading chemist in German academia, busied himself with plans for building his institute in the Berlin suburb of Dahlem. With input from BASF, Haber created laboratories that were more modern than\n\n62 63 64\n\nDegea Aktiengesellschaft (Auergesellschaft) Berichte, Korrespondenz (EIA) Degussa IW 24.5./2–3.

In his role as KWI director, Haber would prove himself a great organizer of science and a uniquely personable diplomat. In 1917, he even helped to lure Albert Einstein to serve as the director of the KWI for Physics. Haber and Einstein ﬁrst met in 1911 at the annual meeting of German natural scientists in Karlsruhe. According to later reﬂections, Einstein was impressed by Haber’s “uncanny agility” and “fertility of ideas.”66 Haber, in return, enthusiastically supported Einstein’s theory of relativity, which helped to convince Einstein to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin in 1914. This mutual admiration turned into yet another strong and lasting friendship for Haber. For many German scientists, including Einstein and the chemist Richard Willstätter, Haber was perhaps best deﬁned by the loyalty and"
