Acceleration allows the measurement of a Lorentz-FitzGerald body contraction created. It is argued that in the back scattering of a probing laser beam from a relativistic flying electron cloud mirror generated by an ultra-intense laser pulse, a first measurement of a Lorentz-FitzGerald body contraction is feasible.\n\nGerald: a general environment for radiation analysis and design\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBoyle, Ch.; Oliveira, P.I.E. de; Oliveira, C.R.E. de; Adams, M.L.; Galan, J.M.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nFull text of publication follows: This paper describes the status of the GERALD interactive workbench for the analysis of radiation transport problems. GERALD basically guides the user through the various steps that are necessary to solve a radiation transport problem, and is aimed at education, research and industry. The advantages of such workbench are many: quality assurance of problem setup, interaction of the user with problem solution, preservation of theory and legacy research codes, and rapid proto-typing and testing of new methods. The environment is of general applicability catering for analytical, deterministic and stochastic analysis of the radiation problem and is not tied to one specific solution method or code. However, GERALD is being developed as a portable, modular, open source framework which renders itself quite naturally to the coupling of existing computational tools through specifically developed plug-ins. By offering a common route for setting up, solving and analyzing radiation transport problems GERALD offers the possibility of methods intercomparison and validation. Such flexible radiation transport environment will also facilitate the coupling of radiation physics methods to other physical phenomena and their application to other areas of application such as medical physics and the environment.

The approach of these different chains of thought also happened with the critical theorists of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt, as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse. Erich Fromm was member of the Institute, where he contributed decisively to the convergence of psychoanalysis and Marxism in the early years of this institution. Afterwards, he breaks his ties with the Institute and develops an original analysis of contemporary society, with the main theoretical framework being a singular way of reading the works of Marx and Freud.\n\nNews Focus: NSF Director Erich Bloch Discusses Foundation's Problems, Outlook.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChemical and Engineering News, 1987\n\n1987-01-01\n\nRelates the comments offered in an interview with Erich Bloch, the National Science Foundation (NSF) Director.

Hawkins, 1928-2003\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKrupp, Edwin C.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nPublic perceptions of human prehistory were transformed in the 1960s by astronomer Gerald Stanley Hawkins, who died suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart attack on 26 May 2003 at Hawkridge Farm, in Virginia, near Washington, D.C. His astronomical analysis of Stonehenge, first published in \"Nature\" on 26 October 1963, and subsequently developed and framed with historical and cultural context in a best-selling book, \"Stonehenge Decoded\" (1965, in collaboration with John B. White), was also showcased internationally at the time in a one-hour CBS television documentary special, \"The Mystery of Stonehenge\". The high-profile, unconventional, and cross-disciplinary character of Hawkins's celestial interpretation of Stonehenge alignments and his configuration of the monument as an eclipse predictor attracted archaeological skepticism that provided the controversy desired by the makers of the television program. Antagonism was contrived between Hawkins and archaeologist Richard J.C. Atkinson by the production team to introduce conflict that would enhance audience interest in the subject, and the televised dispute troubled both men for decades. By the early 1970s, however, Hawkins had inspired others to examine the astronomical potential of ancient and prehistoric monuments in many parts of the world. He ignited modern studies of archaeoastronomy. In fact, in a second book on the subject, \"Beyond Stonehenge\" (1973), Hawkins reported his expanding perspective with accounts of his fieldwork on New Kingdom temples in Egypt, on the giant geoglyphs near Nazca, Peru, and at other sites. He also brought the work of other investigators to the attention of his many readers. He established methods and protocols for alignment studies and invited others to use them. Following, in a sense, the footsteps Sir J. Norman Lockyer left among the antiquities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Hawkins reexamined the alignments of several Egyptian temples, documented significant\n\nErich Fromm e a arte de amar\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVinÃ­cius Bezerra\n\n2010-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Este artigo se ocupa das questÃµes amorosas a partir do pensamento de Erich Fromm.

Besides, he was interested in ethics. Even more - considering Fromm, human nature is strictly connected with ethics. He asks if there is foundation to establish some universal, absolute ethic? What is authority, and is there a connection between authority and ethics, and humanity and ethics? Is character of any relevance to ethics? Is human good or bad? What is the connection between human nature and social value? Fromm defines terms clearly, and this paper is brief introduction to those terms and to answers that Fromm gave to upper questions.\n\nEarly treatment of simphysis mandible fracture in children 12 years old using Erich arch bar (case report\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSyahril Samad\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Incidence rate of symphysis mandible fracture in children was about 15 â 20%. Boys are effected twice as frequently as girls. The pattern of craniomaxillofacial fractures seen in children varies with evolving skeletal anatomy and socioenvironmental factors. The treatment of pediatric maxillofacial fractures is due to physiological, developmental, and anatomical characteristic of children. Management of pediatric mandible fracture by anatomic reduction is combine with stabilization adequate to maintain it until bone union has occured. This case report is aimed to explain about the management of simphysis mandible fracture in pediatric using erich arch bar. A 12 years old boy has fracture in mandible due to accident with mechanisme the chin hit the touching motorcyle tank. Clinically, was a deformity at the anterior of mandible and malocclusion has occured. Patient also complaint aÂ pain with swelling and bleeding at the regio of fracture and lip. Suturing was doneÂ in wound area intra and extra oral, followed by application of arch bar in maxilla and mandible. Control at the third day was found a vague fracture line in panoramic radiograph. Management of emergency trauma in oral and maxillofacial surgery was based on principle of ATLS was done in this case. Following treatment was application of erich arch bar for mobility reducing the fracture of mandible symphisis. Management of mandibular symphisis fracture in 12 years old children with full eruption of teeth has been given a good healingÂ due to the teethÂ was act to develop retention and stabilize the erich arch bar. Management of pediatric simphysis mandible fracture for 12 years old children with full eruption of teeth using erich bar revealed a healed fracture.\n\nâYOUR P.C.W.â THE UNPUBLISHED LETTERS OF PAUL SCHEERBART TO ERICH MÃHSAM\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlexander N. Belarev\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The archive of a German writer and anarchist Erich MÃ¼hsam (1878â 1934 is a significant but âunexploredâ part of the manuscript collection of the A. M. Gorky Institute of World Literature of the Russian Academy of Sciences. I publish three letters of a German science fiction writer Paul Scheerbart (1863â 1915 to MÃ¼hsam and a postcard that Scheerbart sent to a German writer Hans Heinz Ewers. The letters to MÃ¼hsam record negotiations with publishing houses in Munich and Berlin about the publication of Scheerbartâs manuscripts (1909. In the postcard to Ewers, Sheerbart writes about the progress in his work on the perpetual motion machine that he tried to construct in 1908â1909. The letters are published in German with Russian translation and commentary. The introductory article gives an overview of Scheerbartâs life and career, the specificity of his works, their problematics and poetics and especially focuses on Scheerbartâs epistolary heritage. These letters are the token of friendship and professional collaboration of the two writers that is reflected in their mutual work on the unrealized project of publishing a satirical newspaper âVaterland.â The IWL archives contain the unpublished manuscripts of Scheerbart and MÃ¼hsam related to this project as well. The history and the structure of the MÃ¼hsam archive is another aspect covered in the introductory article. Both Erich and Zenzl MÃ¼hsam were victims of totalitarian regimes. Erich was killed by the Nazis and his spouse Zenzl spent many years in Soviet labor camps. The history of the MÃ¼hsam manuscripts became intertwined with Zenzlâs life. That is why the article devotes space to Zenzlâs biography and attempts to answer the following questions connected to the archive: how did the manuscripts get to the Soviet Union? Why is the archive uncomplete? Finally, I discuss the publication history of Scheerbart letters from the IWL collection.

Erich Fromm, dentre a maioria dos psicanalistas existentes, desde Freud, procurou desenvolver suas pesquisas e reflexÃµes a partir da âpsicanÃ¡lise humanistaâ, oferecendo, assim, recursos heurÃ­sticos fundamentais para se pensar a vida na sociedade. Nesse sentido, propomos analisar primeiramente o seu mÃ©todo de anÃ¡lise, a partir do qual acreditamos ser fundamental para compreender o procedimento teÃ³rico/metodolÃ³gico que utilizava para pensar os temas por ele abordados, e, nesse sentido, encontrar o caminho a ser percorrido na busca em seu pensamento da seguinte questÃ£o: como abordar a partir de seu ponto de vista, o ser humano da sociedade capitalista?

Contemplating the disorder in view of the philosophical ideas mentioned earlier, the author analyses such aspects of patients as: functioning on the verge of life and death, the paradoxical struggle to escape from freedom in search of independence, as well as various understandings and descriptions of anorexia in consideration of social constructivism. The author shares thoughts and poses hypotheses, trying to view anorexia in light of selected philosophical and psychological ideas, which in their general assumptions were not concerned with defining nor analysing anorexia nervosa. In view of Karl Jaspers' ideas, the author focuses on the so called 'limit-situations', in the ideas of Erich Fromm she takes notice in \"Escape from Freedom\" to new relations. Finally in the light of social constructivism the author focuses on the cultural context.\n\nEl concepto de salud mental en la obra de Erich Fromm\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nUbilla, Enrique\n\n2009-01-01\n\nLa obra de Erich Fromm se destaca por una visiÃ³n holÃ­stica del Hombre.

Among the anarchists, positions with markedly diverse forms of argument were espoused by such prominent advocates of individualist anarchism as John Henry Mackay and by others coming from the Bakuninist tradition, such as Senna Hoy and Erich MÃ¼hsam. Their writings evidence that prior to World War I and into the 1920s, German anarchists--especially when compared with the Social Democrats--intervened consistently on behalf of individual self-determination extending into the sexual sphere, even though an undercurrent of hostility toward homosexuals persisted within the leftist movement as a whole.\n\nAESTHETICS OF OPPOSITION: THE POLITICS OF METAMORPHOSIS IN GERALD VIZENORâS BEARHEART\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSeyed Mohammad Marandi\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The Chippewa novelist Gerald Vizenor puts across his interconnected politico-philosophical notions of âsurvivanceâ and âterminal creedsâ in his early novel,Â Bearheart. To do so, Vizenor implemented some of the aesthetic strategies of magical realism. He filled his novel with an excessive amount of bizarrely sexual and violent scenesâwhich turn out to be magicalâin order to âupsetâ the established standards of normality. Moreover, he used American Indian mythic folktales of transformation and metamorphosis, a magical realist technique, to re-shape the cultural and tribal identity inÂ Bearheartâs modernized context.\n\n. . . und . . . Fried . . . und . . .: The Poetry of Erich Fried and the Structure of Contemporaneity\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNora M. Alter\n\n1997-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This essay looks at the poetry of Erich Fried in the context of tensions within contemporary cultural studies. Fried's contemporaneity is linked to his status on the margins of various cultures, media, and ideologiesâthus making both his life and his works appear as exemplary paradigms for the postmodern condition, with its various theoretical celebrations of \"exile,\" \"border crossing,\" \"transgression,\" \"deterritorialization,\" and so forth. Yet, at the same time, seemingly in contrast with his labile identity is Fried's rigid Marxist political ideological core which surfaces in his political poetry. Focusing, in particular, on Fried's poems directed against the Vietnam War, this essay seeks to situate the tension beteen these two positions as a deep structure already in his work.\n\nErich Regener and the ionisation maximum of the atmosphere\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCarlson, P.; Watson, A. A.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nIn the 1930s the German physicist Erich Regener (1881-1955) did important work on the measurement of the rate of production of ionisation deep under water and in the atmosphere. Along with one of his students, Georg Pfotzer, he discovered the altitude at which the production of ionisation in the atmosphere reaches a maximum, often, but misleadingly, called the Pfotzer maximum. Regener was one of the first to estimate the energy density of cosmic rays, an estimate that was used by Baade and Zwicky to bolster their postulate that supernovae might be their source. Yet Regener's name is less recognised by present-day cosmic ray physicists than it should be, largely because in 1937 he was forced to take early retirement by the National Socialists as his wife had Jewish ancestors. In this paper we briefly review his work on cosmic rays and recommend an alternative naming of the ionisation maximum. The influence that Regener had on the field through his son, his son-in-law, his grandsons and his students, and through his links with Rutherford's group in Cambridge, is discussed in an appendix. Regener was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics by SchrÃ¶dinger in 1938. He died in 1955 at the age of 73.\n\nGerald J.

Gerry was interviewed by Ross Cagan, Senior Editor of Disease Models & Mechanisms.\n\nReflexÃµes sobre as implicaÃ§Ãµes do conceito de liberdade em Erich Fromm\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndrÃ© de Melo Santos\n\n2010-07-01\n\nFull Text Available\n\nErich Fromm foi um psicanalista que participou da formaÃ§Ã£o da Escola de Frankfurt com o projeto de unir o materialismo histÃ³rico de Marx Ã psicanÃ¡lise de Freud. Dentre os conceitos abordados por ele, o da liberdade Ã© um dos fundamentais, ao postular a diferenÃ§a entre a âliberdade deâ e a âliberdade paraâ, sendo a primeira a liberdade existente na sociedade capitalista, uma pseudo-liberdade, e a segunda seria a realizaÃ§Ã£o da liberdade no sentido positivo.

It details why this was a groundbreaking endeavor, as it countered the pervasive psychoanalytic denigration of spiritual traditions, practices, and experiences. The second section describes the effect of Fromm's Zen Buddhism and Psychoanalysis on the author of this paper, as he came to clinical psychology and psychoanalysis from involvement in Indian philosophy. The third section is a case study of a spiritually advanced Hindu woman seen in intensive short-term psychoanalytic therapy in Bombay, describing the interface of the spiritual with psychoanalytic therapy. The fourth section explains what eventually led to a sea change in psychoanalytic attitudes toward spiritual traditions and practices, with a small but significant group of psychoanalysts becoming involved in one or another spiritual practice, and working with patients also so involved.\n\nBenjamin Ortmeyer: Mythos und Pathos statt Logos und Ethos, Zu den Publikationen fÃ¼hrender Erziehungswissenschaftler in der NS-Zeit: Eduard Spranger, Herman Nohl, Erich Weniger und Peter Petersen, Weinheim / Basel: Beltz 2009 [Rezension\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nZimmer, Hasko\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRezension von: Benjamin Ortmeyer: Mythos und Pathos statt Logos und Ethos, Zu den Publikationen fÃ¼hrender Erziehungswissenschaftler in der NS-Zeit: Eduard Spranger, Herman Nohl, Erich Weniger und Peter Petersen, Weinheim / Basel: Beltz 2009, 606 S.\n\nReview: Gerald Beck (2013.

Na perspectiva daquilo que chamo de uma fenomenologia saidiana do exÃ­lio, o lÃ³cus enunciativo do exilado Ã©, para o pensador palestino, um estilo Ã©tico que implica numa posicionalidade diferencial indispensÃ¡vel para a compreensÃ£o crÃ­tica do mundo atual. Como veremos neste artigo, mesmo que os personagens conceituais do humanismo mundano de Said sejam, por excelÃªncia, filÃ³sofos, escritores e pensadores que experimentaram a condiÃ§Ã£o de exilados, âperspectivismo do exÃ­lioâ Ã© lido, contudo, como o valor heurÃ­stico de uma posicionalidade crÃ­tica sempre fora do lugar e disponÃ­vel atÃ© mesmo para aqueles que nÃ£o experimentaram diretamente a migraÃ§Ã£o e o desterro. Em outras palavras, este artigo procura comentar a releitura que o pensador palestino realiza, em Humanismo e crÃ­tica democrÃ¡tica, de Mimesis, de Erich Auerbach, propondo que o ponto de diÃ¡logo entre esses autores esteja na potÃªncia que migraÃ§Ã£o e exÃ­lio desempenharam em suas trajetÃ³rias crÃ­ticas.\n\nErich Fromm's productivity: creativity as exemplified by Joyce's blooming of Leopold and Molly.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHarrell, Valentina\n\n2005-01-01\n\nAccording to Erich Fromm, the productive character expresses what he called the life force in ways that are, by nature, artistic in quality. His valuing of the vital and the artistic, fueled by this life force in our potential to be human, serves as the cornerstone of his model of psychoanalysis. Gilbert Rose, author of Necessary Illusion: Art as \"Witness\", also has identified the parallel between analytic and artistic processes, building on the assumption that the therapeutic alliance and the aesthetic alliance are one and the same. In elaborating this assumption and extending the parallel between Rose and Fromm, I draw the conclusion that the qualities of relationships have an impact on one's ability to express oneself creatively, to live an artistic life--that is, to live productively. Psychoanalysis is, in practice, a process that is artistic, creative, and re-creative in nature. To the degree that authentic expression of emotionally charged implicit knowledge of the ineffable (the emotional life that resides deep in the bodymind) results in transformation and healing, the process is artistic in nature. This process is exemplified by examining the life and literary creations of James Joyce, especially Joyce's characters of Molly and Leopold Bloom in Ulysses.\n\nIslamist Suicide Terrorism and Erich Frommâs Social Psychology of Modern Times\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEmad El-Din Aysha\n\n2017-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Mainstream social science has struggled to explain the appeal of suicide terrorism to so many Muslim youths, relying as it does on standard socio-economic indicators and research meant to identify suicidal tendencies. The existential emphasis is missing. This commentary is inspired by the work of clinical psychologist Erich Fromm (1900-1980 and his investigation of the social psychology of modernity, as well as how this intermingles with existential fears related to mortality (death-related fears and the passage of time (the end of the world or apocalypse. Modernity, explained Fromm, makes one feel small, insignificant and isolated in the larger scheme of things. This demands a violent response, often involving self-sacrifice, to reassert the balance, which allows Islamists to take advantage of death-related anxieties and exaggerate the sense of confrontation with the world through apocalyptic prophecies. Current psychological research on death and studies of terrorism and religious extremism both confirm many of Frommâs findings and expand on them. In this commentary I argue that the religion of Islam, far from being a source of suicide terrorism, has historically restrained both suicidal tendencies and political violence directed at civilians, but it is the slow yet sure encroachment of modernity that has eroded these theological and communitarian defences. Other problems, such as household politics, gender roles, and theological teachings concerning death likewise feed this process, as documented by Arabic researchers in contexts other than political violence.\n\n\"The Freak of Nature\": On Erich Fromm's Vindication of Binomial Sexuality and the Potentials of the \"Homosexual Deviation\".\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBauer, J Edgar\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAs a Freudian revisionist and neo-Marxist, Erich Fromm (1900-1980) lessened the import of sexuality in the individual psyche but stressed the role played by the sex differential in the distribution of power throughout history and in the post-patriarchal form of matriarchy he envisioned. Seeking to reinforce the male/female divide and heteronormativity, Fromm outlined a \"New Science of Man\" that readily ignored not only the challenges posed to binary sexuality by post-Darwinian critical sexologies, but also the same-sex complexities evinced by key figures of his own cultural pantheon. Regardless of his declared pursuits, however, Fromm at times expressed insights suitable to undermine the cogency of his most cherished sexual convictions. As a tool for uncovering \"indubitable commonsensical axioms\" as sources of alienation, Fromm's conception of \"idology\" challenges his own sanction of sexual binarity and heterosexuality, thus facilitating an understanding of the individual's sexual difference as a unique modulation of male/female intermediariness.\n\nTwo moments in the recent history of biblical reading: the Bible as literature from Erich Auerbach and Robert Alter\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnderson de Oliveira Lima\n\n2015-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This article is dedicated to the understanding of what is read the Bible as literature. We present two moments in the recent history of Bible reading that seem crucial to the definition of this form of reading. The two moments were the publications of two important works that approached the biblical texts from a literary perspective, differing from traditional approaches, religious and exegetical, and influencing the next generations. The first of these two works was Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature by Erich Auerbach, originally published in 1946, the other was The Art of Biblical Narrative by Robert Alter, original 1981. We examine some of the main contributions of these two authors for the Bible studies and try to demonstrate that there is a thematic dependence between their works, then list the main assumptions of this way of reading the Bible today, and defend the hypothesis that religious mediation still dividing the Bible studies.\n\nAn existential criterion for normal and abnormal personality in the works of Erich Fromm.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKapustin S.A.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This is the first of four articles scheduled for publication in this journal on the position people with normal and abnormal personalities take in regard to so-called existential dichotomies. The main objective of this article is to propose a new, existential criterion for normal and abnormal personality implicitly present in the works of Erich Fromm. According to this criterion, normal and abnormal personalities are determined, first, by special features of the content of their position regarding existential dichotomies, and, second, by particular aspects of the formation of this position. Such dichotomies, entitatively existent in all human life, are inherent, two-alternative contradictions. The position of a normal personality in its content orients one toward a contradictious predetermination of life in the form of existential dichotomies and the necessity of searching for compromise in resolving these dichotomies. This position is created on a rational basis with the personâs active participation. The position of an abnormal personality in its content subjectively denies a contradictious predetermination of life in the form of existential dichotomies and orients one toward a consistent, noncompetitive, and, as a consequence, one-sided way of life that doesnât include self-determination. This position is imposed by other people on an irrational basis. Abnormal personality interpreted like this is one of the most important factors influencing the development of various kinds of psychological problems and mental disorders â primarily, neurosis. In the following three articles it will be shown that this criterion is also implicitly present in the theories of personality devised by Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Carl Jung, Carl Rogers, and Viktor Frankl.\n\nAnorexia nervosa in light of Karl Jaspers and Erich Frommâs ideas and social constructivism â hypotheses and thoughts [Anoreksja psychiczna z perspektywy koncepcji Karla Jaspersa, Ericha Fromma oraz nurtu konstrukcjonizmu spoÅecznego â hipotezy i refleksje\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nTalarczyk, MaÅgorzata\n\n2012-01-01\n\ne point of the article is to analyse and reflect on certain symptoms of anorexia nervosa in light of Karl Jaspers and Erich Frommâs ideas and social constructivism.

Jerry, as he was known to all, took on many diverse and important responsibilities throughout his life and dealt with them with quiet authority and grace. This was the hallmark of his life. The Board of Trustees of Associated Universities, Inc., which he served for many years, expressed this in its condolences, writing \"Jerry personified integrity, thoroughness and dedication. His sensitivity for the views of others, his sincerity, his personal commitment, his calm approach and his unfailing good humor were all greatly admired and respected.\" Jerry was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan on May 29, 1915 but grew up in Milan, a nearby country farm community, and in Ypsilanti where his father was Principal of Michigan State Normal College, which later became Eastern Michigan University (EMU). It was there that he first became interested in physics. It was there also that he met and courted Josephine Waffen, who later would become his wife for more than sixty-six years and fill their lives with three loving sons, Walter, James, and Thomas. Upon graduation from EMU, Jerry was awarded a scholarship that took him to the University of Michigan where he earned a Ph.D. in Physics, researching the decay modes of the radioisotopes of iodine. In the Fall of 1939, during the waning days of the Great Depression, he was offered an Instructorship in the Physics Department of Cornell University, a promising start for a fruitful academic career. He brought his bride Jo to Ithaca and joined the cyclotron group under Robert Bacher and Willy Higginbotham while devising a laboratory course in nuclear techniques for graduate students. Bacher and Higginbotham soon left Cornell to join a new wartime laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and many other colleagues were \"drafted\" for war work.

From 2003 to 2009, he was Senior Fellow for Science and Security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Homeland Security Program, where he worked on reducing biological weapons threats, improving national preparedness, and easing potential tensions between the scientific research and national security communities. Epstein came to CSIS from the Institute for Defense Analyses. From 1996 to 2001, he served in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. And from 1983 to 1989, and again from 1991 until its demise in 1995, Epstein worked at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, where he directed a study on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, alongside research on other global security topics. A recognized expert in biological risk reduction, Epstein was actually trained as a physicist, having received SB degrees in physics and electrical engineering from MIT, and a PhD in physics from the University of California at Berkeley. How, then, did he come to study the evolving threat from bioterrorism? \"What compelled me about bioterrorism was that it was a stellar example of a topic that would lead to a train wreck between the scientific community and the security community unless they figured out how to work together,\" he said. \"The distance between a laboratory and a very large consequence event is a lot shorter in biology than in any other field. I got into bioterrorism to help make sure that the security community doesn't get so scared of the science that it shuts it down, and that the science community isn't so oblivious of security concerns that it pays no attention to them.\" Epstein spoke on November 6, 2009, with contributing writer Madeline Drexler, author of Emerging Epidemics: The Menace of New Infections (Penguin, 2009), an updated version of an earlier volume.

Nurturing in order to stave off such suffering is the first act of the community toward the individual, primarily in infancy. Hence for Loewy, autonomy, the gradual growth of self-determination in individuals, is grounded in a broader moral commitment of the community, that of beneficence. This is the critical point in his argument, for it represents a wholesale critique of modern libertarianism. Libertarians, in contrast to Loewy's argument, seem to ground the nature of the community in the prima facie right of autonomy. For Loewy, the community not only has an obligation to refrain from harming individuals (nonmaleficence), but it also has an active duty to ameliorate and prevent, as far as possible, the suffering of its members. Thus, if there is a social contract, it is one of nurturing one another to overcome the vulnerability of suffering, not primarily one of protecting autonomy. This is most significant for clinical ethics as well. Once the primary obligation to ameliorate suffering is no longer necessary, when the individual loses or does not have the primary moral worth prompted by the capacity to suffer, then secondary and symbolic obligations emerge. Loewy is thereby able to suggest a \"calculus\" of moral worth, wherein our obligations to individuals in a permanent vegetative state or to anencephalics (almost always the individual will have lost the capacity to suffer through some cerebral event) must be weighed against other primary obligations. Although Loewy admits that grounding clinical ethics in the capacity to suffer might be \"thin,\" it nevertheless prompts serious discussion about the nature of the \"good\" in good clinical ethics decisions.\n\nGutscheine und Protektionismus / Gerald Braun\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nBraun, Gerald\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEuroopa Kohtu otsusest, mis kÃ¤sitleb kÃ¼simust, millistel tingimustel vÃµivad tÃ¶Ã¶andjad vÃ¤ljastada oma tÃ¶Ã¶tajatele maksusoodustusega talonge, mida saab kasutada majutuseks, meelelahutuseks ja/vÃµi toitlustuseks (Câ179/14).

While improving transistors, Bell scientists Gerald Pearson and Calvin Fuller invented the first silicon solar cell. That first effort was further improved for applications in remote humid locations by Darryl Chapin [1]. The first experiment with silicon yielded an efficiency of 2.3%. Improvements with regard to the dopants, the metallic contacts to the p- and n-side and the application of an antireflection coating led to efficiencies of 4%. In 1954, cells with 6% efficiency could be reliably manufactured.\n\nPresent at the creation: the founding and formative years of the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJacobson, Susan\n\n2003-04-01\n\nThe Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL) was founded in 1978 with the goal of strengthening academic health sciences libraries and increasing their participation nationally in efforts to improve medical education.

The translator explores the similarities between analytical work and the task of translation by means of the concepts of the dialectical third and the interactional field. The history and politics of the translation of analytic writing and their consequences for the lingua franca of analysis are discussed. Key themes within the correspondence are outlined, including Jung and Neumann's pre-war exploration of Judaism and the unconscious, the post-war difficulties around the publication of Neumann's Depth Psychology and a New Ethic set against the early years of the C.G.

Contribution to the development of female psychology].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchwabe, G\n\n1979-01-01\n\nThe large frieze of the \"Villa of the Mysteries\" at Pompeji is interpreted on the base of the psychology of C. G. Jung, especially of his student Erich Neumann. According to his psychological theories the frieze is depicting the development of the female principle to individuation, arranged with extraordinary artistic inspiration. Through the myth of Ariadne-Theseus-Dionysus the change of the woman, disappointed from the personal man and hero is shown. Through the experience of the transpersonal male principle in herself she is entering in a new level of conscience, the patriarchism, and so coming to the highest development, to the \"Selbst\".

If one defines the device as a whole destined to deteriorate and to surpass itself, the theory of these breaking points becomes clear through the observations about the historical times of Koselleck and RicÅur. The initiative (or Â«strength of the presentÂ» that allows a system to transform itself is identified, within literary criticism, in an articulate role of the author, conjunction and conflict point of an ontology of intentions and an ontology of events. Using these concepts we can read again one of the most important critical essays of the XXth century: Mimesis by Erich Auerbach.\n\nConjugation-promoted reaction of open-cage fullerene: a density functional theory study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGuo, Yong; Yan, Jingjing; Khashab, Niveen M\n\n2012-02-01\n\nDensity functional theory calculations are performed to study the addition mechanism of e-rich moieties such as triethyl phosphite to a carbonyl group on the rim of a fullerene orifice. Three possible reaction channels have been investigated. The obtained results show that the reaction of a carbonyl group on a fullerene orifice with triethyl phosphite most likely proceeds along the classical Abramov reaction; however, the classical product is not stable and is converted into the experimental product. An attack on a fullerene carbonyl carbon will trigger a rearrangement of the phosphate group to the carbonyl oxygen as the conversion transition state is stabilized by fullerene conjugation. This work provides a new insight on the reactivity of open-cage fullerenes, which may prove helpful in designing new switchable fullerene systems. Copyright Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The subtitle refers to the paper's overview of Fordham's published oeuvre and the particular place of the Journal of Analytical Psychology, for which he was the founding editor. Fordham's contribution to a Jungian-based model of development is discussed, with reference to his papers in the British Journal of Medical Psychology. The paper notes miscellaneous pieces from Fordham's commentaries, obituaries, papers and reviews which capture not only the development of Fordham as a thinker but also his character. There is discussion of his reviews of Melanie Klein's Envy and Gratitude and manuscripts by Erich Neumann. A reminiscence of Fordham as supervisor is recounted.

This movement was strongly influenced by philosophers from Louvain (Leuven. The struggles between German monists and Jesuit Erich Wasmann in the years 1905-1907 inspired Polish neo-scholastics to take a stand in philosophical discussions about the theory of evolution. The aim of this paper is to show how Polish neo-scholastics resolved problems of relations between 'fides' and 'ratio' with respect to the theory of evolution. In this paper there are presented some ideas of such philosophers as Franciszek Gabryl (1866-1914, Kazimierz Wais(1865-1934, Feliks Hortynski SJ (1869-1927 and Konstanty Michalski (1879-1947. Their ideas show how philosophical, historical and sociological background of the theory of evolution's reception in Poland looked like.\n\nSadomasochism or the Art of Loving: Fromm and Feminist Theory.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChancer, Lynn S\n\n2017-08-01\n\nAlthough the work of Erich Fromm is not usually associated with feminist theory, his ideas overall are more consonant with contemporary notions of gender than usually recognized. This paper identifies three aspects of Fromm's thought worth feminist revisiting. The first relates to Fromm's gender-less use of sadomasochism to describe relationships based on dominance and subordination; this framework can be applied to sexist dynamics, though not limited to this context. Second, Fromm's vision of love as presented in The Art of Loving can be seen as kindred with Simone de Beauvoir's critique of romantic love and its flaws. Third, and relatedly, Fromm's concerns about the need for recognition as well as autonomy are compatible with Jessica Benjamin's notion of mutual recognition as developed in her book The Bonds of Love. All told, Frommian and feminist thought appear to be more connected than antagonistic.\n\nFotometrÃ­a y polarimetrÃ­a de Lynga 1\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBrusasco, M.

GERALD intends to create a unifying software environment where the user can define, solve and analyse a nuclear radiation transport problem using available numerical tools seamlessly. This environment will serve many purposes: teaching, research, industrial needs. It will also help to preserve the existing analytical and numerical knowledge base. This could represent a significant step towards solving the legacy problem. This activity should contribute to attracting young engineers to nuclear science and engineering and contribute to competence and knowledge preservation and management. This proposal was made at the on Workshop on C ommon Tools and Interfaces for Deterministic Radiation Transport, for Monte Carlo and Hybrid Codes , held from 25-26 September 2003 in connection with the conference SNA-2003. A first success with the development of such tools was achieved with the BOT3P2.0 and 3.0 codes providing an easy procedure and mechanism for defining and displaying 3D geometries and materials both in the form of refineable meshes for deterministic codes or Monte Carlo geometries consistent with deterministic models. Advanced SUSD: Improved tools for Sensitivity/Uncertainty Analysis. The development of tools for the analysis and estimation of sensitivities and uncertainties in calculations, or their propagation through complex computational schemes, in the field of neutronics, thermal hydraulics and also thermo-mechanics is of increasing importance for research and engineering applications. These tools allow establishing better margins for engineering designs and for the safe operation of nuclear facilities. Such tools are not sufficiently developed, but their need is increasingly evident in many activities\n\nMusica e Weltanschauung. Opera musicale, filosofia, cultura\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRiccardo Martinelli\n\n2014-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Can music express the world-view (Weltanschauung of a certain composer, or of a certain historical era â and how? In 19th Century, the wide-ranging philosophical implications of this question raised an intriguing quarrel between the formalistsâ scepticism as to this point and their various opponents. Starting from the case study of the German psychologist and philosopher of music Georg AnschÃ¼tz (1886-1953, it is argued that allowing for a systematic link of music and the world-views easily turns into the far more demanding (and occasionally ambiguous claim that music is the best and perhaps the only way to express them properly. In turn, this attitude sits well with the tendency to think of music hearing as a disembodied process, hinting at the deep dimension of synesthesia rather than to that of music as a cultural phenomenon, in Erich Hornbostelâs sense.\n\nQuelques conceptions juives de lâindividu Some Jewish Conceptions of the Individual\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlessandro Guetta\n\n2011-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Is there a Jewish conception of the individual subject? The issue is quite problematic, for several reasons: 1 it is difficult to speak of Judaism in a monolithic manner, because Judaism is a multifaceted reality, varying according to different epochs and places, to the point that we should speak of âJudaismsâ, in the plural; 2 if the question of the individual subject is connected to the vision that the Western (meaning, European, essentially Christian culture has constructed, Judaism can hardly be defined as âOccidentalâ or âOrientalâ. After a short analysis of these two points, we present the conceptions of the individual subject as developed by two major Jewish thinkers of the twentieth century: Martin Buber (1878-1965 and Erich Fromm (1900-1980. Both based their visions on traditional Jewish sources (Bible, Talmud but attributed them a universal value.\n\nAHP 4: na53 mÊi53 Tibetan Songs, Engagement Chants, and Flute Music\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLIBU LAKHI (LI JIANFU æå»ºå¯, DAWA TENZIN à½à¾³à¼à½à¼à½à½¦à¾à½à¼à½ à½à½²à½à¼\n\n2010-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The present study is a straightforward, pragmatic attempt to document the particulars of na53 mi53 song and musical traditions comprising the local 'performance-scape'.

He points out that not all nations have the same interest or views toward nuclear energy; but also he says that if a choice must be made, nonproliferation objectives must take precedence over economic and energy benefits. It is pointed out that the management of nuclear energy can be only partial and temporary by technical measures, and that full management can result only if nations realistically face the task prepared to forego preconceived short-term advantages in favor of long-term gains. Coordination of the policies of all nations toward the common goal of nonproliferation is predicted to lead to success\n\nEstilos de Comportamento de Profissionais de CiÃªncia, Tecnologia e InovaÃ§Ã£o (C,T&I\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRoberto Coda\n\n2010-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Using the constructs of Motivational Orientation and Mobilization Style based on Erich FrommÂ´s thoughts on personality and considering studies related to people management in STI environments, this paper aims to identify behavioral work patterns of professionals operating in STI organizations as a way to provide insights for the hiring, development and staffing of knowledge workers. The empirical research uses the M.A.R.E.

Results show predominance of the Mobilization Styles named Specialist and Competitor as well as a reduction in the styles denominated Maintainer and Conqueror, as behavioral work patterns, suggesting the existence of different and specific behaviors and organizational culture for the professionals and organizations involved in the study.\n\nAn ethics of suffering: does it solve the problems we want to solve?: commentary.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEdwards, Barbara Springer\n\n1991-01-01\n\nErich H. Loewy proposes to elevate the moral obligation to prevent and relieve suffering to the level of a prima facie moral duty by delineating which beings are of primary moral worth and which are of secondary moral worth. Sentient beings have a capacity to suffer and are therefore of primary moral worth. Beings that are insentient cannot suffer; therefore such beings are only of secondary moral worth. Objects of secondary moral worth include patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) and brain-dead patients. This proposal, he says, would solve a number of problems in clinical bioethics. First, it would help to clarify our moral duties at the bedside. And secondly, by creating a hierarchy of moral values, it helps to differentiate which patients are owed our primary allegiance and resources. Despite his extensive and painstaking proof, I believe several questions remain about the use of the \"capacity of sentient beings to suffer\" as a basis for a universal grounding in ethics.\n\nBerliner Ensemble 1957 â Piccolo Teatro 1963.

The reviews were examined by the application of quantitative analysis based on the recurrence of determinate themes associated with images of science. In comparing the results of the analysis of each of the two press reviews, it appears that different images were conveyed by the same play performed in two different contexts for different audiences. Italy, in particular, showed a more frequent recurrence of the conflict between science and religion as a result of the ongoing cultural and spiritual authority of the Church, whereas in the German Democratic Republicâs communist regime, where Brecht is a troublesome but tolerated intellectual, the topics of the scientistâs freedom within the Establishment and intellectual courage were more frequent.\n\nBerliner Ensemble 1957 â Piccolo Teatro 1963.

The so-called Phenomenological Psychiatry used to play a very important role in German psychiatry during the 50 ies until the 70 ies and had strong influences on the first reformers of German psychiatry, such as Walter Ritter von Baeyer, Heinz HÃ¤fner, Caspar Kulenkampff, Karl Peter Kisker and Erich Wulff. Their reforms were not only founded by a social criticism put forth by theories such as marxism (Basaglia, Wulff) or structuralism (Foucault) but also by a concrete notion of what it is like to suffer from mental illness and what kind of needs are linked to such suffering. This very notion was given by the phenomenological approach. Finally the article tries to give reasons for today's reciprocal loss of connection of the phenomenological and the socio-psychiatric school.

For this purpose, I take as a starting point that the gospel belongs to the literary genre of ancient Greco-Roman Biography, which presents Jesus Christ as the protagonist. The other characters are developed in relationship with him. The same is true with the Apostle Peter. The article unfolds from narrative theory, in particular the categorization of characters. I categorize, based on Erich Auerbach and Robert Alter, the features of biblical characters, developing comparisons with theories of the character in the modern novel. The analysis of the main texts from the Gospel of Matthew that portray the character Peter leads to the conclusion that its main features are complexity and inversion. They produce an overview of the involution of the character in the narrative of the Gospel of Matthew.\n\nFotometrÃ­a y polarimetrÃ­a de Trumpler 21\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGiorgi, E.; Baume, G.; VÃ¡zquez, R.

This move was generally supported but Toronto newspapers and evangelists sought assurances that school boards could still dismiss homosexual teachers. They demanded children be shielded from gay teachers, who they accused of sexual predation. I historically link this to a reenergized fear of homosexuals which emerged during Toronto sex education debates in the 1970s. Later, influenced by Anita Bryant's Save the Children crusade, Toronto newspapers and evangelists argued gay teachers were the dangerous effect of gay rights. After the 1977 murder of Emanuel Jaques and the publication of Gerald Hannon's \"Men Loving Boys, Loving Men\" article, anti-gay sentiment in Toronto exploded, temporarily halting the progress of gay rights.\n\nThe Salt II Treaty\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCaldwell, D.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe first strategic arms limitation talks resulted in two agreements: the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the Interim Agreement to Limit Strategic Offensive Arms. Senator Henry M. (Scoop) Jackson (D-Wa.) was concerned about the numerical advantage granted to the USSR by the Latter agreement and proposed an amendment that would prohibit future negotiators from granting the Soviet Union similar terms. This paper discusses the second round of SALT negotiations which opened in November 1972 and continued under presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter. As the negotiators met, U.S. and Soviet scientists and engineers continued their work to develop new nuclear weapons and launchers.

The district is in east-central Idaho, about 20 miles west-southwest of Salmon. The area is one of deeply weathered nearly flat-topped upland surfaces cut by steep-walled valleys which are tributary to the canyon of Panther Creek. Most of the area has a relatively heavy vegetative cover, and outcrops are scarce except on the sides of the steeper valleys* Because of the importance of the surficial deposits and soils and the physiographic history of the region on the interpretation of the geochemical data, a separate chapter on this subject by Gerald H.

The venture would include production, R ampersand D, sales and marketing, plus both companies' PVC recycling activities. However, their vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) plants, and Hoechst's Kalle PVC film business, have been left out. Erich Schnitzler, head of Hoechst's PVC business unit, does not anticipate problems with the European Community's competition directorate. We are both among the middle-sized European PVC producers, and together we would have a 9%-10% market share. Our joint venture would not limit competition. Both partners are hoping for approval from Brussels in first-quarter 1993.

The project analyses textbooks for the teaching of Czech literature for secondary schools. It focuses in particular on the excerpts from the literary works and analyses their potential for the learners to acquire cultural and historical knowledge as well as personal skills. These excerpts are conceptualized here as Denkbilder, a term that has been used repeatedly in German literature studies recently to define short prose texts that stimulate imagination as well as reflection. Responding to the high number of literary works from world literature in the Czech textbooks analysed for the project, this article addresses the contrasting presentations of one classic of German literature, Erich Maria Remarqueâs 1929 novel All Quiet on the Western Front (Im Westen nichts Neues. It illustrates how a single literary work can be presented in different ways in literature textbooks, offering the learners different approaches for relating to the text and activating their cognitive and imaginative resources.\n\nWhere East meets West: in the house of individuation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStein, Murray\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe psychological process of individuation as experienced in Jungian work may lead to states of consciousness that resemble advanced spiritual developments across religious traditions and cultures. This is where Westerners may reach a common ground with the East. In the essentials and with respect to the final goal there is little difference among the many ways to the self, even if the cultural features in the landscape are disparate. In late stage Jungian analysis and individuation and in what Erich Neumann calls 'centroversion', the personal and the impersonal aspects of the personality accumulate around the ego-self axis to form a composite identity. In this complex structure the ego does not vanish but is joined to the impersonal archetypal levels of the psyche and identity thus becomes at once individual and archetypal. This is the third stage of conjunction as described by Jung in Mysterium Coniunctionis and it is identical to the type of consciousness depicted in the final scenes of Zen Buddhism's Ten Ox-Herding Pictures.

After, the poem was included in the book ContemplaÃ§Ã£o de Ouro Preto, published in 1954 by the Documentation Service of the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture. The edition under government auspice, and the fact that the book was illustrated with photographs by Humberto Moraes Franceschi and Erich Hess make us think about the advanced relations between Modernism and State for the patrimonyâs preservation. The poem inscribes itself, with other images, therefore, in the documentation proceedings and in the transformation of baroque torsion forces into forms. The essay tries to brush these texts against the grain and find, inside a work easily identifiable to autonomism, the specters that haunts it and, marking Godâs death (and consequently the death of the absolute principles, entangle the statal reading of this documental, tourist, and patrimonialist production inside Murilo Mendesâ poetic.\n\nBetween Marxism and psychoanalysis: antifascism and antihomosexuality in the Frankfurt School.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHalle, R\n\n1995-01-01\n\nIn their efforts to utilize individualist psychoanalysis as a tool for understanding mass behavior, the social theorists associated with the Frankfurt School increasingly came to rely on a static, essentializing construction of sexuality which ultimately led to an equation of fascism and homosexuality. Heretofore unexamined in studies of the Frankfurt School, this equation will here serve as the starting point for a fundamental critique of the concept of sexuality developed by this influential circle of Marxist thinkers. While directed at the concept of sexuality, such a critique more importantly opens up the underlying understanding of the social and psychological realms advanced by Critical Theory. Attending to the equation of homosexuality and fascism as the central point of concern, this essay will first trace the introduction of psychoanalysis into Critical Theory through Erich Fromm and then investigate the extent of Fromm's influence on the concept of sexuality propounded by his colleagues, especially Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno. Finally, it will take up a frequently overlooked essay by Herbert Marcuse which promoted a vision of sexuality radically different from that of his associates.\n\nFundamentos teÃ³rico-metodolÃ³gicos del âcuestionario sobre marcos de orientaciÃ³n Ã©tica de estudiantes de la UNEDâ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGilbert Ulloa Brenes\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available A partir de las tesis elaboradas por el psicÃ³logo social Erich Fromm (1977 respecto a los marcos de orientaciÃ³n y devociÃ³n que guÃ­an parte del comportamiento humano en sociedad, se construye un sistema teÃ³rico-metodolÃ³gico cuyo objeto de estudio, categorÃ­as, subcategorÃ­as y ejes temÃ¡ticos derivan en un instrumento denominado:âCuestionario sobre marcos de orientaciÃ³n Ã©tica de estudiantes de la UNEDâ, el cual se utiliza en el proyecto de investigaciÃ³n de la CÃ¡tedra de TeologÃ­a titulado: âÂ¿EnquÃ© creen los jÃ³venes?
