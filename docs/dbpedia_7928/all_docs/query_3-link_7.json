Regener, son of a Royal land surveyor, attended Gymnasia in Bromberg, Marienburg (West Prussia), Stargard (Pommern), and yet again in Bromberg, and concluded his school years by sitting for his Abitur (final exam) in 1900. He then studied chemistry and physics at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. Working under the supervision of Emil Warburg, he was awarded a Ph.D. in 1905 for a dissertation on the influence of ultraviolet radiation on the oxygen-ozone equilibrium. Regener was twice married, first to Victoria Mintschin and then to Gertrud Heiter. He had two children by his first wife.\n\nFrom 1906 to 1913, Regener worked as an assistant at the Military Technical Academy in Berlin-Charlottenburg.
