It is appropriate that such an auspicious event be recorded by rehearsing briefly the history of our journal to recognize the contributions of its founders and previoois editors. Renaissance and Reformation was founded in 1964 by Professors Natalie Davis and James McConica to function as a forum for both work in progress and completed scholarship in the interdisciplinary areas of the Renaissance and Reformation. Initially, it grew out of the regular meetings of the Toronto Renaissance and Reformation Colloquium at which scholars in our field met every other month to share discoveries, test hypotheses and report conclusions. Davis and McConica felt these important meetings should have a vehicle through which to communicate with members of the Colloquium not present and to other Renaissance and Reformation scholars unable to travel to Toronto. Renaissance and Reformation began as a mimeographed newsletter but developed in just six years to a saddle-stitched, if modest, thrice yearly publication. By then, a new editor. Prof J. Molinaro of the University of Toronto Department of Italian Studies, had assumed the position of editor, a post he held until 1976 when he was succeeded by Prof Van Fossen, my predecessor. In the early years, the journal tried to meet the needs of scholars not only in the Toronto area but all over Canada. Also, the increasingly national quality of our journal was signalled by the more frequent submission of French articles, beginning in the early 1970s. Thereafter, Renaissance and Refonnafion became truly bilingual, a fact which in time resulted in a francophone associate editor being added to the editorial board and the responsibility for book reviews being divided between an anglophone and a francophone. Moreover, Renaissance and Reformation began attracting submissions from scholars of international stature not only in Canada but also abroad. This growing stature was equally reflected in our increased subscription list. In part as a response to this success and to the growing pressure on our limited space, the decision was taken to print quarterly, a policy which we still follow. When I became editor in 1985, more women were added to our editorial board and there was a conscious policy adopted to broaden our appeal, seeking high quality submissions in such disciplines as History, Art History and Reformation Studies, areas where our representation was insufficient. Also, the journal initiated the publication of a special issue each year which would be the selected proceedings of major interdisciplinary conferences held in Canada on aspects of the Renaissance and Reformation. The results of this policy have been gratifying: 1986 saw the publication of The Language of Gesture in the Renaissance; 1987, Poetry and Religion, 1545-1600; 1988, Sexuality in the Renaissance; and now in 1989, Confraternities in the Renais- sance. It is our hope that Renaissance and Reformation will continue to develop over the next twenty-five years and continue to serve the community of Renaissance and Reformation scholars in Canada. Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to thank publicly all of those who have made our journal such a success, all past and present members of the editorial board, contributors, readers, reviewers and colleagues who have provided advice over the years. Kenneth R Bartlett Editor VI Préface JLa parution de ce numéro de Renaissance et Réforme marque le 25e anniversaire de la fondation du journal. Il me semble que résumer brièvement l'histoire de notre journal et reconnaître la contribution des fondateurs et précédents éditeurs est une façon appropriée de célébrer cet événement Renaissance et Réforme fut fondé en 1964 par les professeurs Natalie Davis et James McConica en tant que forum à la fois pour les travaux en cours, ainsi que pour présenter des communications dans les domaines pluridisciplinaires de la Renaissance et de la Réforme. A Torigine, le journal se développa à partir des rencontres régulières du Toronto Renaissance and Reformation Colloquium, qui réunissait tous les 2 mois les savants dans notre domaine, dans le but de partager leurs découvertes, examiner des hypothèses, et rapporter des conclusions. Davis et McConica eurent le sentiment que ces importantes réunions se devraient d'avoir un organe de communication pour les différents membres du Colloque ainsi que pour d'autres savants travaillant dans ce domaine et n'ayant pas la possibilité de venir à Toronto. Renaissance et Réforme n'était au début qu'une lettre d'information ronéotypée, mais après 6 ans seulement se développa en une publication, 3 fois l'an, qui bien que modeste, n'en était pas moins fermement en place. A cette époque un nouvel éditeur, le Prof J. Molinaro, du département des études italiennes à l'université de Toronto était en poste, ici jusqu'en 1976, où lui a succéda mon prédécesseur, le Prof. Van Fossen. Dans ses premières années, le journal tentit de s'adapter aux besoins des savants non seulement de Toronto, mais aussi de tout le Canada. Le caractère de plus en plus national de notre journal était indiqué par la soumission plus fréquente d'articles en français, au début des années 70. Peu après. Renaissance et Réforme devint réellement bilingue, ce qui eut pour résultat d'ajouter au conseil editorial, un co-éditeur francophone, et de partager la responsabilité de revue des livres entre un anglophone et un francophone. Bien plus. Renaissance et Réforme commença à attirer les articles de savants d'un niveau international, non seulement au Canada, mais également à l'étranger. Ce fait se reflétait aussi dans l'augmentation du nombre des abonnés. En partie en réponse à ce succès, et en partie à cause vu d'une pression continuelle, aboutissant à un manque d'espace, la décision fut prise de publier 4 fois par an, ce que nous faisons encore actuellement. lorsque je devins éditeur en 1985, plus de femmes furent introduites au conseil editorial, et il y eut une politique consciente pour élarger notre appel et chercher des articles de haute qualité dans des disciplines comme l'histoire, l'histoire de l'Art, et l'étude de la Réforme, domaines dans lesquels nous avions une représentation insuffisante. Le journal entreprit également la publication d'une édition spéciale chaque année, qui comprendrait une selection des actes des congrès pluridisciplinaires ayant lieu au Canada sur les différents aspects de la Renaissance et la Réforme. Les résultats de cette politique ont été gratifiants: en 1986 fut publié The Language of Gesture in the Renaissance, en 1987 Poésie et Religion 1545-1600, en 1988 La Sexualité à la Renaissance, et en 1989 Les Confraternités à la Renaissance. Nous espérons que Renaissance et Réforme continuera à se développer les 25 prochaines années et à servir la communauté des savants ayant un lien avec la Renaissance et la Réforme au Canada. Enfin, je voudrais profiter de cette occasion pour remercier publiquement tous ceux qui ont fait de notre journal un tel succès, tous les membres passés ou présents du conseil editorial, les collaborateurs, lecteurs, critiques et collègues qui ont prodigué leur aide au cours de années. Kenneth R Bartlett Editeur VIII Introduction WILLIAM R. BOWEN 1 he nine articles which appear in this special edition of Renaissance and Reformation/Renaissance et Réforme were originally presented at the interna- tional conference, \"Ritual and Recreation in Renaissance Confraternities,\" held at Victoria College in the University of Toronto, April 1989. The conference was organized by The Toronto Renaissance and Reformation Colloquium and was sponsored in part by the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies. Accordingly, it seems appropriate to mention that this publication is a product of the close relationship between the Colloquium, the CRRS and the journal, and that it celebrates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of all three institutions. The conference was inspired by a session devoted to Italian confraternity studies at the 22nd International Congress on Medieval Studies at Kalamazoo, Michigan, May 1987. At that time it was apparent that there was a real need for a forum in which specialists from different backgrounds could share information and insights on confraternities. Konrad Eisenbichler and I organized the Toronto conference, reportedly the first of its kind in North America, in order to satisfy the immediate need for the exchange of ideas by providing the setting for an international and interdisciplinary meeting. The papers which have been selected for this issue of Renaissance and Reformation/Renaissance et Réforme demonstrate the richness of this area of research and the broad appeal of its subject matter. From recent research it has become well-known that the laity commonly worked together, forming confraternities or comparable organizations which played a vital role in Renaissance society. The papers presented here demonstrate the geograph- ical breadth of the field: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish confraternities are considered. Moreover, they illustrate the variety in structure and activities of Renaissance confraternities. The reader is given concrete examples of their administrative structure, their techniques for maintaining order within the membership, and their often complex rela- tionship to civic and ecclesiastical authority. Further, the involvement of IX the confraternities with the arts is documented in studies of their dramatic, artistic and musical activities. The individual articles reveal fascinating insights into particular aspects of confraternities in the Renaissance. Yet the strength of this special issue lies in the combined effect of the articles for, together, they present a powerful image of the confraternity as an important mechanism for mutual support and the achievement of common goals within Renaissance society. University of Toronto The German Bruderschaften as Producers of Late Medieval Vernacular Religious Drama RALPH BLASTING Nearly two hundred manuscripts of German vernacular religious plays are known to exist. Their designation as Medieval has more to do with their style and intent than with their chronological distribution, since the texts are dated from roughly 1230 to as late as 1685. Bound to Catholic tradition, these plays maintained religious dramatic practices in societies which were otherwise being affected by the changes of the sixteenth century. Their production reached its peak between 1450 and 1550— the same period during which the lay religious confraternities became numerous and popular. The connection inspires ready answers to questions about the financing and organization of these civic productions, but definitive explanations are obscured by a lack of archival evidence and the incomplete detail of those records which have survived. Following a summary of what is known about the German confraternities (the Bruderschaften) in relation to religious drama, this paper offers a more detailed look at two locations: the south-west German town of Kunzelsau, where the Brotherhood of St. John the Baptist {St. Johannes Bruderschaft) contributed to Corpus Christi festivities between 1474 and 1521; and Vienna, where the Corpus Christi Brotherhood {Gotleichnamsbruderschaft) seems to have been the primary producer and organizer of plays and processions on its namesake feast day. The recent publication of two reference works in the field of German religious drama encourages investigation of the subject from broader perspectives than had previously been practical. Rolf Bergmann's Katalog der deutschsprachigen geistlichen Spiele und Marienklagen des Mittelalters (Munich: Beck, 1986) provides detailed descriptions of all the known Renaissance and Reformation / Renaissance et Réforme, XXV, 1 (1989) 1 2 / Renaissance and Reformation manuscripts, along with outlines and overviews of their content and structure. Bemd Neumann's Geistliches Schauspiel im Zeugnis der Zeit (2 vols. [Munich: Artemis, 1987]) includes over 3,700 items related to religious dramatic performance, transcribed from archival sources in over 200 locations throughout the German-speaking areas. Together, the two works present broad empirical evidence of vernacular religious theatrical activity in German society from the thirteenth through the seventeenth centuries. An investigation of the Bruderschaften as producers reveals a diversity of activities which makes generalizations — at least at this stage — difficult if not impossible. The lack of archival evidence may permanently prohibit a full picture of the accomplishments of the German confraternities. Even the evidence which does exist argues against a tidy explanation of their functions, since they seem to have fulfilled different purposes in different places. Where plays were performed, a confraternity may have been the sole producer, or have contributed to a production only cooperatively, or not have participated at all. Most locations supported several confraternities, and their relations to one another, to the craft guilds, to the Church, and to the municipal government are often unclear. It is rare that sufficient records from all of those sources have survived from a single location. It is nonetheless possible to present some preliminary findings which reveal the extent to which these organizations might have been involved in theatrical activity. The Kiinzelsau records of the Brotherhood of St. John indicate sporadic contributions between 1474 and 1521, which suggest a connection to, but not the primary support of, the Kiinzelsau Corpus Christi Play} The records of the Viennese Corpus Christi Brotherhood include detailed references to virtually every aspect of dramatic production during the years 1499 to 1534, suggesting that the confraternity was the primary producer of Corpus Christi presentations, especially between 1504 and 1512. My evaluation of the Vienna accounts is based on the published findings of Neumann and Hadamowsky, who have listed only the references to drama.2 Although the expenditures for plays were extensive, I cannot comment on what proportion of the confraternity's annual finances they represent. I have, however, had the opportunity to view the Kunzelsau accounts in their entirety, which has allowed some insight into the other concerns of the confraternity.^ But before we approach the records them- selves, it will be helpful to consider more precisely what the German Bruderschaften were, the types of plays they were likely to support, and why they would venture to produce drama at all. Renaissance et Réforme / 3 First, the term Bruderschaft requires clarification. It refers here to the religious confraternities, and should not be confused with the Zunfte or Gilden. A Zunft was a craft guild, while the term Gilde seems usually to refer to a merchant guild.'* The terms Bruderschaft and Zunft both occur fre- quently—and sometimes interchangeably— in the records of performance. The plays produced by the confraternities included those connected with the Easter season (the Passion, Resurrection, and related events), Corpus Christi plays, Christmas plays, plays in honour of particular saints, and various types of processions.^ But how did the performance of drama correspond to the purposes of the confraternities? In his study of the diocese of Wiirzburg, Robert Ebner identifies the confraternities as \"societies in which the religious goals stand in the foreground.\"^ A primary activity was the financing of special masses which were to be said for deceased members, either individually or collectively. It was extremely important for members to attend these memorial services, as well as to participate in all funeral and burial rites.^ A main advantage of the confraternities, however, was that their membership was not restricted to any single social group. Anyone who was deemed acceptable (i.e. morally upright), and who could afford an initiation fee and annual dues or contributions in kind, was eligible to join.^ The stark increase in the number and popularity of the confraternities has generally been attributed to the increase in lay piety which peaked during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.^ They seemed to offer the perfect opportunity to gain extra grace in the form of special masses and even indulgences; almost everyone belonged to at least one, and some joined several.^^ The confraternities were inherently religious, and the drama which they produced was celebratory in nature. The religious feast days were integral to the social life of the community; that the confraternities participated in and eventually produced processions and plays is therefore not difficult to understand. A confraternity's inclusion in civic performances asserted and enhanced its role and significance within the community. In fact, the sequence according to which various groups were organized in procession became a sign of their relative importance.^ ^ A major attraction of membership in a confraternity was the right to a place in these displays. Then, as now, people wanted to be included in, and to contribute to, communal activities. The Church, mainly through local bishops, supported the organizations by granting indulgences to those who participated, making membership even more attractive. Since members paid 4 / Renaissance and Reformation initiation fees, annual membership fees, and extra fees for special masses, increased membership naturally enhanced revenues. Money spent to produce plays may, in the long term, actually have generated a profit, although it is at present unclear how often this was true. A final note on the Church's support of the confraternities is that Church approval was not immediate. The hierarchy was at first sceptical, fearing that the popular organizations would fragment the parishioners, and that control by the central administration would weaken as local piety— and loyalty— grew. It may be that the public processions and plays helped to change the Church's attitude. Obviously, Corpus Christi and Passion plays were living illustrations of Catholic dogma. The drama was the mass medium of the Middle Ages, and religious drama was the epitome of the genre at least to the end of the fifteenth century. More effective than the drama's demonstrative capabilities, however, was the participatory nature of the performances. Participation encourages conformity in a very tangible way. It is one thing to hear a clergyman describe the suffering of Christ, or even to witness its representation on stage; it is quite another to take part in that representation, in the role of Christ himself, Pilate, a soldier or an apostle, or as a set-builder, costumer, or musician. Few would disagree that direct involvement in ceremonial drama more effectively reinforces faith than does passive observation. These general notes on why the confraternities produced drama do not bring us very much closer to an understanding of how the plays were produced, or of what forms they took. The financial accounts which have survived indicate that the confraternities kept very detailed records of their expenditures, making the accounts promising sources of information about late Medieval theatre. The fact that relatively few have survived is all the more lamentable in light of the significance of those which have. Surviving descriptions of Corpus Christi processions often list the religious confraternities as participating figurai groups, alongside the craft guilds and the clergy. In Bozen, the Brotherhood of St. Anne walked sixth in the procession, representing the family of its patron saint (\"das Geschlâcht Sant Anna\"), and was immediately followed by the Brotherhood of St Jacob, which represented the Annunciation to Mary. In Zerbst, the figurai group of the Brotherhood of the Afflicted {Bruderschaft der Elenden) included the fourteen Nothelfer, the Christ child in white, St. Wendelinus, and a shepherd. The Corpus Christi Brotherhood presented Saints Cather- ine, Margaretha, Barbara, Dorothea, and other virgins, \"as many as can Renaissance et Réforme / 5 be.\" Sometimes confraternities were founded for the express purpose of organizing plays. In Augsburg in 1484, the clergy of the Holy Cross (\"zy dem heyligen creutz\") requested permission to establish a Bruderschaft for the purpose of presenting a Corpus Christi procession, as they had already done for one or two years. Permission was granted by the clergy of the cathedral only after they were assured that the procession would not distract from the ceremonies in the cathedral itself ^^ In most cases, the records of the confraternities give much more detailed information about their expenses than do comparable Church or municipal accounts. A typical priory record from Bozen reads: \"Item expense to the carpenters in the brotherhood as assistance for Corpus Christi, 8 Bern h[eller].\"^^ We know that the parish helped the carpenter's guild (or the carpenters in the confraternity?) with a financial contribution relating to Corpus Christi, but this tells us nothing about what the money was used for. A closer look at some accounts from confraternities in Kiinzelsau and Vienna give us a better idea of the materials and procedures required in the production of the plays. The accounts from the small, southwest German town of Kiinzelsau seem to be typical of a German confraternity, as far as we can determine what was \"typical\" from the few accounts which have survived. The town had at least two, and perhaps three confraternities, and was the home of the Kiinzelsau Corpus Christi Play. Financial accounts survive from the con- fraternities of St. Wolfgang and St. John the Baptist, with one folio booklet indicating a confraternity of the Virgin Mary.^'* Possible references to performance appear to occur only in the accounts of St. John, and even then they indicate that these activities were only a small part of the confraternity's functions. Of the thiily-three folio booklets of accounts ranging from 1475 to 1558, records of performance occur in only six: 1475, 1476, 1507, 1509, 1511, and 1522. Neumann has reprinted sixteen items which he believes may relate to performances (nos. 1998-2005, 2008-2016), all of which had been previously published by Albert Schumann or Peter Liebenow.^^ Some of the entries are detailed enough to relate to sections of the Corpus Christi play text. The following items appear consecutively on fol. 2r of the account book dated 1475: Neumann no. [1998] 2 Bd we spent for paper for the procession. [1999] 3 Cd for linen which was used for the dragon. 6 / Renaissance and Reformation [2000] 5 6d for 3 skins to the tanner for the crowns. [2001] 15 Bd to the gentlemen as we had the procession.^ Payments for paper occur throughout the records published by Neumann, including a later entry for Kunzelsau which reads \"Item 1 Bd for paper for the play.\" Some records indicate that the paper was used either for copying out the entire play script, or for writing out individual parts for actors. The distinction between the terms \"procession\" and \"play\" was not definitive: the narrator of the Kunzelsau Corpus Christi Play is indicated in the text as both \"Rector Processionis\" and \"Rector Ludi,\" and the text itself is labelled \"Registrum processionis corporis Cristi.\" Items 1999 and 2000 are good examples of the detail often found in the accounts of the confraternities. \"Linen ... for the dragon\" is an unambig- uous reference to a theatrical creation. The item does not mention a dragon's clothes or costume, so it is safe to assume that the dragon was a stage property, not an actor dressed as a dragon {cf. no. 2012: \"for material . . . for devils' clothes\" [\"fur thuch ... fur theuffels cleider\"]). Although the accounts do not specify where or when the dragon appeared, the Kunzelsau text does include a dragon which accompanies St. George in the \"Procession of Saints.\"^^ In the same way, item no. 2000 gives details of an expense, but stops short of providing a definite connection with the play script. Paying the tanner for three skins for the crowns calls to mind the three magi. Although Liebenow has suggested that the crowns were lined with fur (interpreting \"fel\" as \"pelt\"),^^ it is more likely that the crowns themselves were fashioned out of leather. This is more in keeping with the work of a tanner, and would have resulted in lightweight and durable costume pieces which could have been easily gilded and decorated. The final item in this series refers to a procession, but does not indicate what the money was spent on. \"Dy herm\" suggests gendemen of higher social status, since fellow actors or confraternity members were usually referred to as Gesellen. In the KOnzelsau accounts, expenses incurred by members are usually formulated collectively (\"we spent\" [\"haben wir geben\"]; cf. nos. 1998, 2003-04) or impersonally (\"one spent\" [\"hat man geben\"]; cf nos. 1999, 2002). The \"herrn\" may have been the Chorherren (canons) of the parish church of St. John the Baptist, who almost certainly would have participated in the Corpus Christi celebration. Four other items of particular interest for their detail occur in the accounts from 1507, 1509, and 1511: Renaissance et Réforme / 7 Neumann no. [2008] 1 gulden 3 B to the painters of St. John's coat and to repair other things and [to the painters] of the lamb. [2009] 3 B 6 d for linen for the coat and for a wig to go with it [2012] 10-1/2 Bd for cloth to the tailors, also to the painters for devils' clothes and to improve other things on John the Baptist [Day]. [2014] 2 gulden 1 ort given to the painter for the clothes of the devil and pope, all added together. Payments to painters for decorating cloth or costumes are common in Medieval records of performance. Item 2008 indicates that John the Baptist and his attribute, the lamb, were given special attention, which is not unexpected in the accounts of the Brotherhood of St John. The next item reveals that the confraternity purchased material for John's coat and for a wig to go with it Items 2012 and 2014 also record payments for cloth and to the painters for decorating it In no. 2012 we see that the painters and tailors worked together on devils' costumes, while no. 2014 indicates that the painters decorated costumes for the devils and for the \"pope\" who speaks the epilogue of the play. All of the figures mentioned in these account items appear in the text of the Kiinzelsau Corpus Christi Play, and all would have been deserving of decorative costumes. It is clear from the Kiinzelsau accounts that the confraternity of St John did not support the Corpus Christi play by itself As detailed as the individual items might be, they do not nearly account for all of the costumes, properties, and other costs which would have been associated with the performance. Moreover, if we look at these items in the context of the other expenses of the confraternity, we see that they were a minute portion of the annual totals. The expenses in the 1475 account fill four columns, and contain some sixty-five separate items totalling roughly 43 gulden. The five line items listed by Neumann (nos. 1998-2002) comprise approximately 3.5 percent of the total expenses for the year. For the other accounts containing records of performance, the percentages are even lower: in 1476, only one item relates to performance; in 1507 there are two entries; in 1509, one; in 1511, two; and in 1522, one item. The other expenditures of the confraternity encompass a range of activities, most of them relating to special masses and maintenance of the church. Payments \"per presentz\" were probably made to the local clergy for their attendance at memorial masses for former members of the confraternity. Other items in the 1475 account book mention payments for 8 / Renaissance and Reformation candles (fol. Iv), maintenance of a vineyard (Iv), repairs to a church window (2r, 2v), and payments to the schoolmaster (or perhaps someone named \"Schulmaister\") for writing (3r). The accounts from St. Wolfgang are similar, and apparently contain no references to theatrical performance at all.^^ The KUnzelsau accounts, then, seem to give us a view of a more or less typical small-town confraternity. The main concern of the Brotherhood of St. John was the spiritual welfare of its members. It contributed to the maintenance of the church building and of church services, one of which was the Corpus Christi celebration. The records which relate to religious performance confirm that the confraternity was involved in these activities, but that they constituted only a minor aspect of the organization's finances. The lack of any parish or municipal records from the same period in Kunzelsau prevents a more complete picture of the production of the Corpus Christi play text. From Vienna, surviving accounts of the Corpus Christi Brotherhood {Gotleichnamsbruderschaft) reveal a much fuller involvement in religious drama. The accounts from the years 1499-1534 are fairly complete, and suggest that the confraternity had been responsible for virtually all aspects of performance on the Feast of Corpus Christi.^\"^ The Corpus Christi confraternity had existed in Vienna at least as early as 1445, but was reincorporated in conjunction with the craft guild of the joiners {Tischlerbruderschaft) in 1497. This would not have been completely unexpected, since by 1486 the woodcarver Wilhelm RoUinger (now known for his work on the choir stalls in St. Stephan's cathedral) was also the director of the annual Corpus Christi procession.^^ The confraternity's attachment to the craft guild, along with special financial patronage from the mayor's office, allowed the rapid expansion of production activity in the early sixteenth century. Unlike the KUnzclsau records, I have had access only to the material relating to dramatic performance, as published by Neumann and Hadamowsky. Although I am therefore unable to put them into perspective, the records relating to drama — especially from 1504 to 1513— reveal just how involved a confraternity could become in the production of civic/religious spectacles. The first item for a \"play on Corpus Christi day\" (\"spil an goczleichnamstag,\" [no. 2813]) occurs by itself in 1499. For each of the years 1499 to 1503, Neumann lists a single item, usually for food and drink for participants in the play, the cost of which increases steadily from 13 Bd to 2 lb 5 Û 17 d. For 1504, five items are listed. The confraternity was still Renaissance et Réforme / 9 paying for food and drink, but it also paid a tailor for a coat and for \"hâssugken\" (?), a dyer to colour them, an armourer to polish the armour worn in the play, and a seamstress for making various articles of clothing (nos. 2820-23). In 1505, the number of line items for the play had increased to nineteen, and the accountants for the confraternity began including a separate total for the play's expenses. In 1505 it was 36 lb 6 6 12 d (\"Summa ausgeben auff das spil facit 36 lb 6 Û 12 d\" [no. 2843]). Expenses included the usual ones for food and wine (nos. 2841-42), as well as payments to carpenters for four stages and six crosses, and wages to day-labourers for carrying material to the performance site, erecting the stage, and disman- tling it after the performance (nos. 2825-27, 2834). The confraternity also paid for necessary materials, such as various forms of wood, boards, and battens (\"holcz,\" \"ladn,\" \"lattn\"), and at least four different types of nails (\"verschlachnagl,\" \"schintlnagl,\" \"lattnagel,\" and \"helbertnagl\" [nos. 2829- 33, 2838]). One of the most intriguing payments for that year went to Hanns Tenndler \"for colouring Herod and for repairing him\" (\"von Herodes punt zu machen und zu pessem\" [no. 2840]). This may relate to the inventory of 1513, in which the materials belonging to Herod and Pilate include \"eleven coloured stakes, well ornamented in the Turkish style, with linen\" (\"Ainlef razisch piintt, wolgczicrt auf die turkisch art, mit leinbat\" [no. 3017]). The account for 1505 begins to indicate that the confraternity was responsible for most of the details of performance. The confraternity's control of such details continued in 1506 and 1507. In 1506, it bought food and drink, wood, nails, and paid the \"painters and joiners [of the] Mount of Olives, and what goes with the angel, and for making the crosses, and for painting [what was] new.\"^^ Expenses are also listed for fourteen shirts for soldiers (no. 2875), to the tinsmith for spears (no. 2883), and finally several items for writing expenses, including one \"for writing the register for the play, for paper for the general requirements of the play, 2 lb 2 13 12 d.\"^'^ In total, the account for 1506 includes forty items for the play, amounting to 61 lb 3 B 28 d (nos. 2854-94). The account for 1507 includes similar entries, although the thirty-five items add up to only 33 lb 15 d. Costs for food, lumber, nails, and labour remain more or less constant, and there was an additional expense \"to the writer, who wrote the verses to the play and other necessary things.\"^^ Expenses for costumes and properties were generally lower in 1507, although some money was spent to outfit Judas and the devils: 10 / Renaissance and Reformation For the clothes of the devils and Judas, to the tailor for making them and to the painter for painting the same as well as two faces [masks?] and several firearms red, 1 lb 3 B 6 d. The years 1504-1507 saw annual and substantial payments for virtually all aspects of the play, suggesting that the confraternity was the primary, if not the sole, producer of the spectacle. After 1507, the records seem to indicate a slightly different type of Corpus Christi celebration. In 1508 and 1509, no play expenses were recorded. The records from 1510 to 1512 include eleven to fifteen line items annually, amounting to expenses of eighteen to thirty pounds for the plays. But the expenses are now largely broken down into payments for four large \"groups\" or \"squads\" of performers (Rotten), each of which had one leader who was responsible for its organization and expenses. In 1510, the groups were established as: (1) God with his attendants, numbering fifty persons; (2) the \"Jewish school\" (Sinagoga and his followers), with sixty members; (3) men-at-arms on horseback (not numbered in 1510, but including fifty-seven men in 1511, fifty-six in 1512); and (4) eighty foot-soldiers.^^ The leaders of these groups were reimbursed for food and drink expenses for their groups, while the confraternity paid directly for costumes and prop- erties. The expenses for 1511 and 1512 follow the same pattern, and suggest that the \"play\" on Corpus Christi had become more of a figurai proces- sion.^^ Payments for wood, nails, carpenters, and the construction of the stage have disappeared, and there are no further payments for writing out the verses. Moreover, the formulation of four processional groups of forty to sixty members each would itself have strained the organizational capacity of a director; to attempt to stage a play at the same time would have placed excessive demands on both performers and spectators. The years 1513-1515 have yielded no records of performances in Vienna. From 1516 to 1534, the confraternity sponsored a procession every year (except 1529, when it was cancelled due to rain), each of which was organized in the same way. The processional groups appear in the accounts each year, although the numbers of participants varied, and occasionally certain groups were eliminated altogether. The most expensive (and pre- sumably the most elaborate) procession was held in 1519, when all four groups were included and the expenses totalled 37 lb 2 B 24 d (Neumann nos. 3105-24), still far less than the expenses for the play in 1506 (see above). The leanest year seems to have been 1528, when the procession included only one group, and cost 1 lb 4 0 12 d (Neumann nos. 3282-86). Renaissance et Réforme /Il Before we leave the Vienna records, we cannot afford to overlook one surviving document: the inventory of all materials held by the confraternity as drawn up by Wilhelm Rollinger and Matheus Heuberger in 1513. To list each item separately here is unnecessary, but a brief summary makes it clear that the confraternity possessed everything required to mount a performance. The list includes three crosses \"to be used ... on Corpus Christi\" (\"so man braucht ... an gotsleichnambstag\" [no. 3003]) and literally dozens of pieces of armour and weaponry (no. 3004). That which belonged to God with his attendants (in the procession) included a Mount of Olives, a pillar to which Christ was bound, a red cloak (for the \"ecce homo\"), a sponge on a pole, cloaks for Mary and John, and shirts for the two thieves. Mary Magdalene's wig is listed, with a specific note that \"Master Wilhelm [Rollinger] had promised that it would never be used for worldly enjoyment or honour, but only for the honour of God. Where one should wish rather to use it in another way, one should sooner bum it.\"^^ Other costumes and properties included those belonging to the twelve apostles, Simon of Cyrene, angels, Pilate, Herod, Annas, Caiaphas, Sinagoga, foot-soldiers, and men- at-arms. The armour was kept in four trunks. Finally, the inventory notes that \"a register with verses, in which is written the entire Passion\" was in the possession of Wilhelm Rollinger.^^ The text has never been accounted for. Why this inventory was written in the first of three years when no play or procession was sponsored by the confraternity is not clear. Perhaps the various properties and set pieces which had been used in 1504-1507 had remained in storage as the staged play became the figurai processions of 1510-1512. The inventory may represent the confraternity's assessment of its stock, to determine which pieces were useful, and which obsolete. Whatever the reason, the inventory is an impressive list of the trappings of a late Medieval religious play. The fact that all of the material belonged to the confraternity is further evidence that it was the sole producer of the Corpus Christi spectacle. Neumann's published records of performance allow a preliminary over- view of the connection of the German Bniderschaften to dramatic activity in the late Middle Ages. This brief investigation of the records from Kûnzelsau and Vienna has revealed the varying degrees to which a confraternity might have become involved in production, but a clear picture of the confraternities' connections to drama requires careful evaluation of all available archival sources. If the KUnzelsau Brotherhood of St. John 12 / Renaissance and Reformation only partially sponsored the Corpus Christi play, who supplied the rest of the funding? Did the Vienna confraternity produce the Corpus Christi play entirely on its own? If not, how were other confraternities, the municipal government, and St. Stephan's itself involved? Questions such as these can only be answered through localized studies; for now, generalizations remain elusive. University of Toronto Notes 1 Ms. 1479; ed. Peter K.

Confraternities and Lay Leadership in Sixteenth-Century Liège D. HENRY DIETERICH In examining the place of lay leadership in the late Medieval Church, one might well begin with that acute observer of the nineteenth-century English church and society, Anthony Trollope. In The Vicar ofBullhampton, he has the hard-headed Lord Saint George explain to his father, the Marquis, the genesis of religious dissent: We can't prevent it, because, in religion as in everything else, men like to manage themselves. This farmer or that tradesman becomes a dissenter because he can be somebody in the management of his chapel, and would be nobody in regard to the parish church. Our conventional picture of the Medieval church is one in which the laity and their organizations, including the confraternity, were almost as much at odds with the official structure as the gentry-dominated Establish- ment of the nineteenth century was with the lower-middlc-class Noncon- formist chapels. In regard to confraternities, this tendency is best represented by the statement by Gabriel Le Bras that has been adopted by many confraternity studies since. Le Bras's thesis, repeated and modified by subsequent historians, views the confraternity as a sort of substitute parish. Confraternities provided important support for the Church's activ- ities. Le Bras writes: But all the time the confraternity disturbed the Church by its natural independence and frequent disorders. It constitutes in the bosom of or above the legal parish a consensual parish, with its oratory, its clergy, its worship, its patrimony. Hence the competition of worship services, of funds, of influences. Hence conflicts with the pastor, with the parish council, always latent, which break out in epidemics.^ I Renaissance and Reformation / Renaissance et Réforme, XXV, 1 (1989) 15 16 / Renaissance and Reformation This thesis— that the confraternity formed a \"consensual parish\" in conflict with the legal one— does not seem initially unlikely. There are enough examples, from the eighth century onward, of suspicion of or opposition to confraternities by the hierarchy to demonstrate that conflict sometimes happened. Certainly there have been examples of conflicts between confraternities and their parishes up to the present time. Con- fraternities have also argued with religious houses that sponsored them, over such issues as the use of buildings and other facilities.^ Other observers have argued that the Medieval parish was weak and the confraternity strong. Building on Jacques Toussaert's evidence that paro- chial obligations enjoined by canon law were not well observed in Flanders at the end of the Middle Ages,\"* John Bossy asserts that the Medieval Church \"was not in actual fact a parochially-grounded institution.\"^ Confraternities, on the other hand, provided the real religious life of the people. In his more recent Christianity and the West, Bossy has developed his earlier observation that brotherhood constituted the principal mode of religious life during the Middle Ages. While he points out the parallels between parish and confraternity formation, he stresses their potential and actual conflict^ Modem examples exist to support the Le Bras thesis by analogy. In a study of the surviving village confraternities in France, Martine Segalen cites several cases of conflict between parish clergy and confraternities. For example, in Avignon, penitential confraternities whose origins go back to the Middle Ages have recently been in conflict with the local parishes in an effort to preserve their existence and traditions.'^ Here, as in several cases in Normandy, the application of the vernacular liturgy and other changes since the Second Vatican Council have threatened the traditional strength of confraternities in a fashion similar to that discussed by Bossy for the period following the Council of Trent.^ The mere existence and popularity of confraternities, however, is not enough to establish a nonparochial model for the Medieval Church. The number of funeral monuments in parish churches suggests that parishes, both urban and rural, continued to command loyalty from their members. Cleariy the relationship between the confraternity and the parish must be more complex than a simple opposition of one to the other. The parish was the unit of organization that locally embodied the inclusive and hierarchical principle of the institutional Church; the confraternity embodied the individual aspirations of the laity and the tradition of special brotherhood. Somehow these two elements had to work together. Renaissance et Réforme / 17 The present study looks at one parish, Saint-Martin-en-Ile in Liège, at the end of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the sixteenth, to examine the role of its largest— for most of the period, its only— functioning confraternity. We shall see that from its founding the confraternity was closely tied to the parish. The activities of the confraternity supported the parish structure, and the lay leadership of the parish was drawn largely from the confraternity. The example of Saint-Martin-en-Ile suggests that rather than being in opposition to the parish, the confraternity may well have been a way of integrating the model of brotherhood into the canonical structure. In Liège as elsewhere in late Medieval Europe, the confraternity was a regular parish institution, where the most religiously active among the laity could enjoy the special relation of brotherhood that was so central to their mentality and which is, after all, an essential ideal in the Christian tradition. In a recent important essay, \"The Christian Middle Ages as an Historio- graphical Problem,\" John Van Engen has hailed the appearance of studies of local religious life \"that was neither learned nor extraordinary nor a vehicle of protest.\"^ Of the parish in particular he writes: The study of parochial organization, liturgy, confraternities, pastoralia, and so on will in time bring historians much closer to understanding \"routine\" religious life in the Middle Ages than the study of unusual instances, for example, of an isolated Cathar village, a holy dog, or an eccentric miller.'^ This study of a parish and its confraternity is offered in the hope of coming to such an understanding. The parish of Saint-Martin, known as Saint-Martin-cn-Ilc to distinguish it from the collegiate church of Saint-Martin-cn-Mont, was one of the largest of the twenty-five parishes of Liege. The parish was founded in the late tenth century under bishop Eracle to serve the lay community surrounding the collegiate church of Saint-Paul, which was begun under Eracle and completed under his successor, Notger.^^ Etienne Hélin estimates the parish population in 1650 as between 2440 and 3080 persons.^^ If the population of the city as a whole was, as has been estimated, one-half its 1650 level at the end of the fifteenth century, the population of Saint-Martin-en-Ile would have been between 1200 and 1500. Economically, this population ranged in status from the canons of Saint-Paul to the miserable inhabitants of the swampy islands behind the parish church. A wide variety of trades could be found here. The population 18 / Renaissance and Reformation was far from homogeneous, and included samples of all occupations and classes, partly because it was so large, and partly because its location favoured the establishment of all sorts of commerce. The chapter of Saint-Paul, as founders, retained the titular rectorate with its tithes. To govern the parish, they appointed a permanent vicar or vestit. In addition to the vicar, the parish had a variety of clerics and lay people serving in various capacities. The composition and duties of the parish staff and other officers was typical of parishes in Liège and elsewhere at the time.^^ The parish clerk (marlier) was elected by the parishioners. At the end of the fifteenth century, the parish clerk was a married man, probably in minor orders. His duties involved serving at mass, singing the responses, and caring for the sacred vessels. The chief lay officials of the parish were the churchwardens (mambours) elected by the heads of households in the parish. They were responsible for the finances of the parish, and with the vicar they appointed the chaplains. Other officers of the parish, who received salaries, included the compteur who kept the books and collected payments due; the sexton (fossier) who was also elected by the parish; a mambour^^ or attorney who represented the parish in lawsuits; and a laundress {boweresse) who washed the altar linens. In property transactions the churchwardens were aided by a cour des tenants, a group of substantial men of the parish before whom all reliefs and transfers of property held from the parish were approved and wit- nessed.^^ In dealing with outside institutions, such as in an appearance before the échevins, the churchwardens, the compteur, and sometimes a professional attorney represented the parish. The finances of the parish were based on income from real property, in the form oïcens (denominated in money) and rentes (denominated in kind, usually grain). Some of this went directly to the pastor, the chaplains, or the parish clerk. The rest usually formed three funds of which the churchwardens had charge: the general fund or luminaire, the mass fund, and the poor fund. These funds were the responsibility of the churchwar- dens, who designated a compteur to collect and keep track of them. Between 1450 and 1538, Saint-Martin had eight vicars, five of whom served in person. If to have the official pastor in residence is fortunate, Saint-Martin was blessed throughout most of this period, at least 61 of 88 years. Unfortunately we know little of these vicars besides their names.^^ When the vicar did not reside, he was replaced by another priest, referred Renaissance et Réforme / 19 to as the \"lieutenant du vestit.\" Usually he was one of the parish chaplains who received fixed salaries from the mass fund in return for saying anniversary masses. The number of chaplains at Saint-Martin varied from none in the 1470s, to three or four (besides the \"lieutenant\") in the 1480s, to as many as nine in the 1520s and 1530sJ^ During the period between 1480 and 1540, the parish contained a number of confraternities. One of these appears to have been inactive, indeed moribund. Another was founded in the 1530s and included members of other parishes and of religious houses in the neighborhood. The Confra- ternity of Our Lady was the only one that was active during the years between the^sack of Liège by Charies the Bold, which devastated the city in 1468, and the last years of the Renaissance prince-bishop Erard dc la Marck. We are fortunate in possessing a fairly complete record of this confraternity's accounts, including membership lists, for this period.^^ The Confraternity of Our Lady and the Blessed Sacrament (to give its full name) was founded in the tradition of the Medieval devotional parish confraternity, shortly before the sack of Liège. It was originally two organizations, the Confraternity of Our Lady, founded in 1457, and the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament, founded in 1461, which were united in 1473. In the sixteenth century, the dedication to the Blessed Sacrament in its title gradually dropped out of use. The rule and activities of the Confraternity of Our Lady resembled those of many similar organizations throughout Europe. The members paid dues, equal at the end of the fifteenth century to almost two days' wages for a skilled workman. They were required to attend funerals of fellow members as well as regular masses sponsored by the confraternity throughout the year. Once a year the confraternity held a banquet in connection with the main mass of the year at the feast of the Assumption and the election of officers. The confraternity and the parish were linked by more than a shared building. The rule of the confraternity demonstrates the founders' loyalty to the parish, both by its language and by its specific provisions. As the confraternity developed, its activities benefitted the parish. Moreover, the official leadership, both clerical and lay, participated in the life and assisted the development of the confraternity. In particular, the most active lay leaders in the parish were members of the confraternity. For the confraternity, either as separate organizations or as one, we have five versions of the rule. The latest of these, a version published in 1792, 20 / Renaissance and Reformation represents the confraternity as \"renouvellée Tan 1736,\" and therefore will not concern the present discussion. ^^ The other four date from the period 1450-1540. The first three, dated 1457, 1461, and 1480, are very similar;^» the fourth, dated 1529, is significantly different.^^ Rather than review the rules in detail, I will review a few points that demonstrate the close ties of the confraternity with the parish. The prologue shared by the rules of 1457, 1461, and 1480 sets the tone of loyalty to the parish. The founders declare that they are founding the confraternity with the aid of divine grace out of desire to serve God, the blessed Virgin, and their patron St. Martin. The confraternity of Our Lady, in its original rule, is called the confraternity \"de Nostre Damme & de Sains Martin.\" The rule of the original Blessed Sacrament confraternity uses the same language, and adds to the name the phrase \"du sains Sacrement.\" Throughout the rule, St. Martin, the parish patron, is mentioned over and over again as \"our blessed patron.\" In Liège as elsewhere, the patron saint of the parish was the personal patron of the parishioner.^^ In wills, for example, testators regularly commend their souls to the protection, not of their name-saint, but of the patron of their parish. The Christian's standing before God depended on his relation to this saint, as his relation to the Church depended on his relation to the parish that bore his name. As with many confraternities, regular masses centering around its titular devotion constituted the principal devotional activities called for in the original rules. The Confraternity of Our Lady solemnized the feasts of the Blessed Virgin, principally the feast of her Assumption (15 August) with masses on the other Marian feasts.^^ These masses were to be celebrated at the main altar of the church \"in token of obedience\" (\"en représentant obedience\") to St. Martin, patron of the parish. The Blessed Sacrament confraternity also held its principal mass at the main altar. This celebration fell on the octave of Corpus Christi, because, the rule says, the feast itself is already occupied with the parish celebration. The confraternity also sponsored the celebration of a mass at the main altar of the church, every Thursday of the year, by the vicar or a priest of his choosing. The rule adds that the confreres can take part by carrying candles in the offertory at the parish mass on Corpus Christi, as well as in the procession. The 1461 rule provides for any excess money that might accumulate. It must not, the framers warn, be expended, through ill counsel, \"on gluttony or excess\" (\"par gourmandcrie ne oultrequidenche\"). Instead, Renaissance et Réforme / 21 the superfluous goods are to go to the parish, to be used according to the decision of the vicar and churchwardens. Thus the provision of liturgical celebrations in the original rules of the two confraternities placed them firmly in the parish system. St. Martin's place in the spirituality of the confraternities corresponds to the seals of the vicar and churchwardens, which they attached to the original charters as a sign of approval. All clearly understood the signs of loyalty offered and accepted. This loyalty had practical consequences. Not only does the 1461 rule provide for its extra income to go to the parish; the annual and weekly masses, like the special masses in the 1457 rule, take place at the main altar. This is more than symbolic. Each mass involved a payment to the celebrant and to the parish clerk who assisted. Since the main altar was under the control of the vicar, the rules give him the option of saying the masses — and receiving the income from them — himself. Later changes and modifications in the confraternal rule and pattern of activity continued the intention to cooperate closely with the parish. The earliest decision is the merging of the two original confraternities into one. The sack of Liège in 1468 caused great damage to the church of Saint-Mar- tin-en-Ile, and the confraternity chapels and possessions did not escape. As he and the churchwardens acted to help rebuild the parish, the vicar, Jehan Thomas, moved to strengthen the confraternities by uniting them. On Corpus Christi, 1473, by his \"consent and express wish\" they were united. To symbolize this union, four men — probably the masters of the two confraternities — marched behind one of the churchwardens in the offertory procession.2^ At some point \"before the wars,\" as the confraternity accounts put it, the confraternity began to provide oil for the lamp that burned day and night before the tabernacle containing the reserved Blessed Sacrament^^ For this purpose, the confraternity had acquired or received as a bequest a rente of four quarts of rapeseed oil. Since they both took and used the payment in kind, without converting it to cash, it does not often show up in the account. From 1504 to 1523, the accounts show that the confraternity bought oil for the sanctuary lamp in addition to the rente payment. Between 1514 and 1522, the parish paid one florin a year to the confraternity as a subvention of the lamp. Beginning in 1524, the confraternity accounts show purchases of garlands called \"chapeals\" to decorate the chapel on the feast of the Assumption. 22 / Renaissance and Reformation More permanent decoration of the confraternity's chapel also occupied its attention, especially in the early years. Several brothers in the confraternity, as well as outside workers, did major structural repairs on the chapel in 1468. In the 1480s, the confraternity decorated its chapel. Antoine le Pondeur, a confrere, painted and gilded the statue of the Virgin and the wall behind the altar; in 1480, seven confreres contributed to buy seven \"chapiteals\" of copper.^^ Beginning in 1532, the confraternity engaged the choir of Saint-Paul to sing the Salve Regina every Saturday and Sunday. To help pay them, the confraternity took up a collection, but also paid a considerable sum out of the common fund. That a collection was taken shows that these services were meant to be, and in fact were, attended, probably by other parishioners as well as by confraternity members. Thus the confraternity, through its devotional activities, provided benefits for the whole parish. The chapel with its gilded and painted decorations, garlanded with flowers for major feasts, the lamp burning day and night before the tabernacle, the singing of the Salve Regina at Saturday and Sunday Vespers: these were things all the parish could appreciate. The vicar and churchwardens appear to have understood the advantage to the parish of maintaining the confraternity. We have seen that the vicar took an active part in bringing about the union of the two original confraternities during the troubled time after the sack. Also during the late fifteenth century, some of the confraternity's property came from the parish, having been donated by the churchwardens to help the confraternity get back on its feet, especially to rebuild the chapel.^^ This property was returned eariy in the sixteenth century. That the churchwardens would make such a donation shows the close relation of the confraternity to the parish. Just as the confraternity's chapel was part of the parish church, so too their patrimonies could be freely shared. Although the versions of the rule dated after the union of the two original brotherhoods in 1473 drop the provision that superfluous goods should return to the parish, the confraternity's budget did in large part support the parish. The priests who celebrated the masses in the confraternity's schedule were mostly members of the parish staff Only from 1507 to perhaps 1512, when the Carmelite friars celebrated regular Monday masses, did the confraternity go outside the parish. The connection of the vicar and chaplains went beyond merely celebrat- ing the masses. Although the Confraternity of Our Lady was essentially a Renaissance et Réforme / 23 lay organization, there were always some clergymen in it To begin with, the priest currently in charge of the parish, whether the vicar appointed by the chapter of Saint-Paul or his \"lieutenant,\" was always a member. The other priests were either chaplains of the parish, like Johan Vaillant or Baldwin Charlier, or chaplains of Saint-Paul, like Ott Stratman or Johan Coreal, who also served in the parish. These were the priests who celebrated masses for the confraternity. It is not clear from the accounts whether or not priests were expected to pay dues. Some pay sometimes; almost all pay for their entry. The confraternity seems to have recognized a special role for the vicar. By rule, he said many of the confraternity's masses; the two vicars of the parish from 1492 to 1530, Cloes Jandelet and Cloes Jamart, approved the confraternity accounts each year. As with other members, the confraternity celebrated requiem masses for its priests. The parish clerk, like the priests, received a salary from the confraternity for his services. While his name does not often appear on the membership lists, he enjoyed many of the privileges of membership.^^ The parish clerk throughout most of this period was Godefrin Vaillant; his son, a priest, and later his widow, were also members. Antoine de Bealmont, a former parish clerk, was a member of the Confraternity of Our Lady throughout the 1480s. Not only did the Confraternity of Our Lady include many members of the clergy on the parish staff, it also included almost all the lay leaders of the parish almost all the time. By including most of the churchwardens, tenants, and others who shared their responsibilities, the confraternity most visibly demonstrates its role as a framework for active lay participation in the life of the church. Between 1480 and 1540 the parish of Saint-Martin-en-Ile had only six different churchwardens. Of these, five— Wilhem de Horion, Johan Grenier, Henri Pascal, Baldwin de Scagier, and Johannes Fabri— were all members of the confraternity. From 1488, all the churchwardens were confreres. When the documents give us the names of all seven tenants of the parish land court, we can see that that body was dominated by members of the Confraternity of Our Lady. In 1480, four of the tenants are also confreres; five in 1486; and six in 1497. At least six of the seven are members from then on. In 1525, all seven tenants (including the parish clerk) are members of the Confraternity of Our Lady.^^ In addition to the churchwardens and tenants, there were other laymen who assisted in some way in the government of the parish. On certain occasions during the year, most often when the compteur presented his 24 / Renaissance and Reformation accounts at the end of the year, when the chaplains who celebrated regular masses received their assignments, and after the celebration of the anniver- sary of the dedication of the church, the parish staff and certain parishioners gathered for dinner. Since the dinner was paid for by the parish, it shows up as a notation in the accounts. Typically, the notation mentions the presence of the vestit, the chaplains (sometimes by name), the churchwar- dens, and the tenants (again sometimes by name). There are often several other names attached, followed by \"and many parishioners.\" Those who are named we may call the parish \"core.\" Between 1480 and 1544, therefore, we can name 46 active parishioners, either churchwardens, tenants, or members of the core group. Of these, 35 were at some time members of the Confraternity of Our Lady.^^ In 20 cases, the parishioners were members of the confraternity for several years before they appear in the parish accounts. Six joined the confraternity at roughly the same time as, and nine several years after, they are associated with the government of the parish. Moreov-er of the eleven who are not actually members of the confraternity, four probably have a confraternity connec- tion, either as sons or husbands of women whose names appear in the confraternity rolls. If we look only at the 21 most active parishioners, those whose names appear several times over a space of years, the correspondence is even more striking. Eighteen are present or future confreres; one is the husband of a long-time member; only two have no confraternity connection. While almost all of the active parishioners were men, wc should note that in 1520, \"la femme Fanchon\" attended the dinner on the anniversary of the dedication. She is probably Katherine Woet de Trixhe, wife of Johan de Fanchon and widow of the late tenant and confrere Johannes Saverot, and a member of the confraternity in her own right.^^ While she is the only woman who appears in such a role in the parish, the notation of her presence on this occasion, as well as the connection of several other members of the core group through wives and mothers, reminds us that the parish was a network, not of individuals, but of families. The sample with which we are dealing here is obviously too small and too haphazard for meaningful statistical analysis. What it yields is rather an impression, a pictpre of life in one urban parish. Membership in the confraternity was not a requirement for playing a role in the parish; but active parishioners tended to join the confraternity. They were also leaders in both: of 23 men who served as master of the confraternity from 1502 to Renaissance et Réforme / 25 1540, the names of 16 also appear in the parish accounts. These 16 include 12 out of the 17 most active parishioners who were alive after 1502. We cannot identify the leadership of the confraternity and the parish with one another, but the correspondence is close. More helpful than statistics, perhaps, in clarifying our picture of parish life are the biographies of some of the men who served as churchwardens. There is enough information in the records to draw brief portraits of three churchwardens, covering the end of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the sixteenth: Wilhem dc Horion, his son-in-law Henri Pascal, and Baldwin de Scagicr, the progenitor of a family later important in the history of Liège. Wilhem de Horion, a notary and a member of the mercer's guild, is responsible for much of our knowledge of the early history of the confra- ternity and of the history of contemporary Liège. After the liberation of the city from the Burgundians in 1477, he took up the office of rentier of the guild, in which capacity he recorded the circumstances of the guild's reestablishment, the only record of its kind that survives.^^ In addition to this job, he was compteur of the Premonstratensian abbey of Beaurepart, of the Hôpital Saint-Jacques, and of the parish of Saint-Martin-en-Ile, a churchwarden of the parish and a member of its court of tenants, as well as a member and clerk of the court of tenants of the collégial church of Saint-Paul.33 It is no wonder that in describing how he accepted the job of compteur of the Confraternity of Our Lady, he wrote, \"and I accepted their request notwithstanding that I had enough to do.\"^^ Horion was the first permanent compteur for the confraternity, but his tenure beginning in 1480 was not the first time he had filled this role. In 1468, the Confraternity of Our Lady had put the accounts in his hands to oversee the repairs to their chapel.-'^ The case of Henri Pascal not only provides a portrait of a sixteenth-cen- tury lay leader, it also illustrates the network of marriage alliances that united the parish community. His entry into the confraternity very likely followed soon after his first marriage to Wilhem de Horion's daughter, Jehenne. Like Horion, he was a member of the mercers' guild; he joined his father-in-law on the court of tenants of the parish by 1497, and soon succeeded him as churchwarden. From this marriage he had three daugh- ters.^^ After his first wife died, he married Christine, widow of a confrere and fellow tenant of the parish, Lambert de Hermée the baker, who had just died, making Henry executor of his estate.^^ In addition to his office 26 / Renaissance and Reformation as churchwarden, Pascal was compteur of the Hôpital Saint-Jacques from 1498 to 1523, another office in which he succeeded his formidable father- in-law.^^ He served as master of the confraternity in 1515-17, 1520-22, and 1531-34, as many years as anyone else during this period. Baldwin de Scagier, a churchwarden for many years and a confrere from before 1502 to his death in 1535, seems to have been, with Henri Pascal, one of the pillars of the parish in the early years of the sixteenth century. Unlike Pascal, he had numerous children. Only one followed him in the confraternity, Baldwin, called dc Barbeal. Four entered religious life: Collard at the monastery of Saint-Jacques, Jchan at the Carmelites, Paulus as a brother in the hospice of Comillon, and Gerard as a chaplain in the collégial church of Saint-Paul. This last son was also a chaplain in the parish, but he died young. In a note in the accounts of Saint-Martin-en-Ile, of which he was compteur at the time, the bereaved father mentions a donation of vestments which had belonged to \"Messir Gerar nostre fis que Dieu pardon.\"^^ His eldest son, Heuskin, a vintner like his father, moved to the centre of town and became rentier of the coopers' guild; Baldwin, who stayed in the parish, practiced the same trade and served as guild governor.\"^ Both Baldwins, father and son, are referred to in records originating outside the parish as \"Baldwin de Halighen.\" Both served in the city government as one of the \"commissaires de la Cité\" who played a role in the election of burgomasters and in maintaining public order. A third Baldwin followed them at the end of the century; his son Jean de Halinghen served as burgomaster in 1623, and played a role in the revolt of the Grignoux that divided the city in this period.\"^^ One may ask if these were simply the wealthiest or most politically influential men in the parish. In the absence of census or tax records, it is hard to estimate exact or even relative wealth. The members of the Confraternity of Our Lady included working tradesmen as well as mer- chants, lawyers, and investors. Maître Giles de Fanchon, later an échevin of the city and thus one of the highest officials of both the city and the principality, had occasionally represented the parish in court, but he was never a member of the confraternity. His widow joined immediately after his death, in 1520. While we may count him as one of the active laymen of the parish, his role was entirely professional. After he became an échevin in 1513, he ceased to work for the parish, and another lawyer took his placc.^^ Other men whose names appear as tenants or members of the core group Renaissance et Réforme / 27 and on the confraternity rolls performed other services, from accounting to construction work- Most of the churchwardens, tenants, and others occupied the same social level as Wilhem de Horion and Baldwin de Scagier: merchants or profes- sionals, owners of property, and holding minor offices. Some may have been making a fortune, so that their descendants might achieve the highest offices, as Scagier's great-grandson did; but they had not yet risen out of the parish. Their ties remained there: Baldwin de Scagier distinguishes a number of his fellow parishioners in his accounts by calling them \"mon compere\" and \"ma commere.\" Those like Maître Giles de Fanchon, whose sphere of action was the city or the principality, did not bother with the parish. It was a local world for local leaders. Within the parish, the lay leaders, especially the churchwardens and tenants, had more than an occasional or ceremonial function. In both major decisions and the day-to-day functioning of the parish, they had an active and decisive role. Because the records of Saint-Martin-en-Ile contain rules for some of the operations of the parish church in the redundant Liégeois prose and firm notarial hand of the invaluable Wilhem de Horion, we know how they were supposed to function. The accounts show them in action. The first of the two rules spells out the procedure for election of churchwardens.\"*^ The second begins by providing for keeping the books and rendering accounts, but deals mainly with the appointment and payment of chaplains.\"*^ These are to be chosen by the vicar and church- wardens, the vicar voting first, followed by the senior, then the junior, churchwarden — \"and whatever two of them agree the third cannot and must not disagree with it later.\"^^ That is, the vicar might be outvoted by the churchwardens. Since when the vicar was an absentee, his replacement was one of the chaplains, this often amounted to allowing the parish represen- tatives to choose their own pastor. Evidence of the churchwardens in action also begins with Horion's records. The sack of Liège by Charles the Bold in 1468 greatly upset the life of the parish. The church itself was plundered, in spite of Charles's orders to spare all churches, the population was scattered, and the property on which the parish depended for its income was destroyed.\"^ The payments due became almost entirely uncollectible.'*^ The church building itself had been profaned by the troops, and had to be reconciled and reconsecrated by the auxiliary bishop before it could even be used.'*^ The accounts 28 / Renaissance and Reformation mention ornaments, vessels, vestments, and liturgical books which had to be recovered or replaced. Shortly after the feast of St. Martin, 1472, the vicar and churchwardens met over dinner and made an agreement concerning the effects of the \"devastation et rwin [sic] des guerres et arsin\" in the parish. The principal problem was that the damage to the church and its property had left little income in the mass fund; moreover, the vicar had suffered similar losses. Therefore, the churchwardens, Piron le Berwier and Wilhem de Horion, instead of hiring chaplains, transferred four masses a week, with their income of twenty muids of spelt a year, from the budget of the mass fund to the vicar until such time as the vicar no longer had need of them.\"^^ By 1474, conditions had improved somewhat. The churchwardens note in their register that the vicar had so many masses to say that he needs a chaplain. The mass fund, however, was still encumbered with bad debts, there were not enough linens, and there were \"aultres indigenches apparentes.\" They conclude with a statement directed to their pastor, Jehan Thomas: And we hope that you will behave as a good pastor ought to do, and take counsel and example from Master Tristan, former vicar of Saint- Nicolas, from the vicar of Saint-Jean-Baptiste, and from many other good rectors and pastors who put more into their church than they take out Horion and Berwier provide us here with a precious example of fifteenth- century laymen lecturing their pastor on his duties to use wisely the goods with which they and their predecessors have endowed the parish. Their successors, including Henri Paseal, Baldwin de Scagier, and their confreres like the lawyers Raes de Laminnes and Piron Hannoton, the brewer and commissaire Simon Damerier, and Collard and Jan de la Barbe d'Or, actively continued to help direct the affairs of the parish. The accounts bear witness to this activity. In recording purchases and transactions, the compteur often notes the presence— and for important ones the consent— of one of the churchwardens or tenants. Likewise when the parish consults its lawyers concerning lawsuits, it is the same officials who meet It is safe to say that the secular affairs of the parish as an institution are firmly in the hands of laymen. Nor did they make a distinction between secular and ecclesiastical affairs. Every parish was subject to visitation by the local archdeacon, in the case of urban parishes in Liege, the provost of the cathedral. When such a Renaissance et Réforme / 29 visitation impended in 1510, the lay leadership of Saint-Martin-en-Ile, for practical reasons, saw fit to avoid it: Item, paid in the year [15]10 by the counsel of Henri Paseal and [Piron] Hannoton to our vicar for the first payment to the provost of Liège because of the visitation and to avoid greater expense if he had come in person: 3 florins 6 aidants^^ In the matter of outside interference at least, layman and cleric were of one mind. Most of the activities mentioned in the accounts belong to the routine of parish business: buying supplies, paying for services, and so on. Few were remarkable in themselves, but in cumulative effect they demonstrate an active lay community minding its own affairs. It also took care of its own: the same leaders who managed the general fund and the mass fund also managed poor relief. While most notations of how this occurred are vague and laconic, there is evidence that the pillars of the parish acted as neighborhood leaders in this field as well: Item, Christmas night [1521] given to Jehan le Cock in his neighborhood, Piron de Sirar for the Trcit, Henri Paseal for the Rue du Pont d'Avroy, Gilet le Mounier and me [Baldwin dc Scagicr] for the Vinâve d'Ile, the parish clerk and the sexton, distributed by each named above to the neediest poor: 1 aime of wine. Of those named here, all are among the most active parishioners. De Sirar appears never to have been a member of the confraternity; Gilet's father (also Gilet) had been a member until his death and his mother still was one in 1521. Jehan le Cock, a well-to-do coppersmith, was, like Scagier and Paseal, a faithful confrere and twice confraternity master. Thus Saint-Martin-en-Ile had a group of active and committed lay leaders who were responsible for its affairs. Most of these leaders were also members of the principal confraternity of the parish, a confraternity which as a group, by its original rule and ongoing activities, served to strengthen the parish by ceremonial demonstrations of loyalty and by material support. Lawrence Duggan alludes to this kind of loyalty and support in his important article, \"The Unresponsiveness of the Late Medieval Church: A Reconsideration,\" when he writes, \"Far from withdrawing or being alienated from the established church, laymen in the late Middle Ages were in every way deeply involved in it.\"^^ He notes the increased attention paid to the local parish in the late Middle Ages, a period which in Liège must be extended through 30 / Renaissance and Reformation at least the first half of the sixteenth century.^\"^ The case of Saint-Martin- en-Ile shows just how deeply they were involved. Moreover, it clearly contradicts the view of Le Bras that everywhere the parish and the confraternity were at odds. Here the confraternity was the expression of lay involvement in the very structures of the establishment. To return to Trollope's observation, \"in religion as in everything else, men like to manage themselves\": in the late Medieval parish, the confraternity provided the means for self-management. If it formed, in Le Bras's term, a \"consensual parish,\" it did so not in opposition to, but rather for the sake of, the official parish. Confratemal brotherhood presented an ideal that could be reflected in the parish community where the clergy were not so much the rulers as the sons, brothers, neighbors, and colleagues of the laity.

Renaissance et Réforme / 31 14 The word mambour means \"guardian\"; while in parish usage it generally means \"church- warden,\" it could also be used in one of its more general senses to mean a retained attorney at law (in full mambour en justice). The accounts of the parish usually do not call this man a mambour directly, but refer to paying someone \"pour sa mambournie.\" 15 The use of tenants was not limited to the parishes; it was an integral part of the legal system. Any institution, for that matter any private individual who owned property, had to be able to \"hold court\" in order to receive reliefs of property, the payments made by a new tenant after inheritance or purchase (see Godefroid Kurth, La Cité de Liège au moyen d^e (Brussels: Dewit, 1909-10), 3: 382). Most private persons \"borrowed\" an already existing court, or acted before the court of the échevins, but the endowed ecclesiastical institutions of Liège had permanent courts of tenants who received a salary for their services. The courts resembled in form and in function the court of échevins; they not only recorded property transfers and reliefs, they originally could hear lawsuits relating to property held under them. This latter function, however, had largely passed to the échevins by the fifteenth century. 16 The list of pastors is given in Lahaye, \"La paroisse Saint-Martin-en-Ile,\" pp. 95-101.

She had previously settled Lambert's bakery on her son Loren, also a baker and a member of the Confraternity of Our Lady (AEL, Echevins de Liège, Oeuvres, reg. 113, (T. 140v-41). 38 AEL, Hôpital Saint-Jacques, ptf 7. 39 AEL, Saint-Martin-en-Ue, reg. 50, f 39. 40 On the elder Baldwin and his family, see Paul Ansiaux, \"Grégoire Sylvius, inquisiteur et évêque auxiliaire liégeois (1502-1578),\" Bulletin de la société d'art et d'histoire du diocèse de Liège 26 (1935): 1-20. Ansiaux's information concerning Baldwin de Scagier is accurate, except that he was not the father of Grégoire Sylvius.
