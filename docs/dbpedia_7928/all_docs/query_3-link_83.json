Originally, when I accepted the invitation to write a book about the development of physics during the twentieth century, I thought it would be a relatively easy matter. I soon became wiser. I should have known that it is simply not possible to write a balanced and reasonably comprehensive one-volume account of twentiethcentury physics. What follows is a substitute, a fairly brief and much condensed and selective account of what I believe have been the most significant developments in a century of physical thought and experiment that can well be called the most important century of physics. The book is structured in three largely chronological parts. The first part covers developments from the 1890s to about 1918, the end of World War I. The second part concentrates on developments between the two world wars, roughly 1918 1945, and the third part takes up developments in the remainder of the century. The chosen periodization should be uncontroversial, and so should the decision to start in the mid-1890s rather than in 1900. It is generally accepted that “modern physics” started with the great discoveries of the 1890s and not with Planck’s introduction of the quantum discontinuity in 1900. I have endeavored to write an account that goes all the way up to the present and so includes parts of very recent developments that normally would be considered to be “not yet historical.” There are problems with writing historically about recent developments, but these are practical problems and not rooted in contemporary science being beyond historical analysis. The book is of a type and size that preclude any ambitions of comprehensiveness, not to mention completeness. At any rate, a “complete” history of twentieth-century physics would probably be as pointless as it would be impossible to write from a practical point of view. Like most historical works, this one is selective and limited in scope and content. The selections can undoubtedly be criticized. The material I have included has been chosen for a variety of reasons, one of them being the availability of historical writings and analyses. The book’s goal is to give an account of the development of physics during a one-hundred-year period that is digestible, informative, and fairly representative. There are, unavoidably, many interesting topics and subdisciplines that I do not include, in part because of lack of space and in part because of lack of secondary sources. Among the topics that I originally contemplated to include, but in the end had to leave out, are optics, materials science, chemical physics, geophysics, medical physics, physics in third-world countries, and the post-1950 discussion concerning\n\nxii\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nthe interpretation of quantum mechanics. Yet I believe that what is included does not, in spite of the more or less arbitrary selection criteria, misrepresent to any serious extent the general trends in the development of modern physics. The problem of a balanced account is a difficult one, not only with regard to subdisciplines and dimensions, but also with regard to nations. Physics is and has always been international, but of course, some nations have contributed more to scientific progress than others. My account is essentially a history of physics in Europe and North America, with some mention also of contributions from Japan. This is simply a reflection of how the important contributions to physics have been distributed among nations and geographical regions. Whether one likes it or not, most of the world’s nations have played almost no role at all in the development of modern physics. One of the significant trends of the postwar period has been the dominance of American physicists in a science that was originally European. Because of this dominance, and because of the strong position that American scholars have in the history of science, the historical knowledge of modern American physics is much richer than it is in the case of Europe and other regions, including the former Soviet Union. It is quite possible that the relative predominance of writings about American physics has caused my account to focus too much on the American scene, but under the circumstances, there was little I could do about it. Taken together, the twenty-nine chapters cover a broad spectrum of physics, not only with respect to topics and disciplines, but also with respect to the dimensions of physics. We should always keep in mind that physics (or the physical sciences) is a rich and multifaceted area that has implications far beyond the purely scientific aspects related to fundamental physics. I have wanted to write a broad book, although not so broad that it loses its focus on what is distinctly the world of physics. The present work is not devoted solely to the scientific or intellectual aspects of physics, but neither does it concentrate on social and institutional history. It tries to integrate the various approaches or, at least, to include them in a reasonably balanced way. I have also paid more attention to applied or engineering physics than is usually done. To ignore the physics-technology interface, and concentrate on so-called fundamental physics alone, would surely give a distorted picture of how physics has developed in this century. Not only are many of the world’s physicists occupied with applied aspects of their science, and have been so during most of the century, but it is also largely through the technological applications that physics has become a major force of societal change. The intended audience of the book is not primarily physicists or specialists in the history of science. It is my hope that it will appeal to a much broader readership and that it may serve as a textbook in courses of an\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nxiii\n\ninterdisciplinary nature or in introductory courses in physics and history. With a few exceptions I have avoided equations, and although the book presupposes some knowledge of physics, it is written mainly on an elementary level. My decision to avoid the note apparatus that is often seen as a hallmark of so-called academic books is an attempt to make the book more easily accessible to readers not acquainted with the (sometimes rather artificial) note system of more scholarly works. In almost all cases of citations, I have included references in the text to sources where they can be readily found. Rather than referring to the original source, I have in most cases referred to a later, secondary source, quite often the place where I happened to pick up the quotation. In a book of this type, there is no point in numerous references to old papers in Annalen der Physik or Philosophical Magazine; the reader who might want to dig up the original source can do so via the source I have quoted. The entire book is, to a large extent, based on secondary sources, especially the many fine books and articles written by historians of the physical sciences. I have also drawn freely and extensively on some of my earlier works dealing with the history of modern physics, chemistry, technology, and cosmology. The source problem is quite different with regard to physics in the last third or quarter of the century. Whereas there is an abundance of secondary sources dealing with older developments in physics, written by either historians or participants, there are only few historical analyses of post-1960 physics (high-energy physics is an exception). Within this part of the chronology, I have had to base my account on useful material that happens to exist, on physicists’ more or less historically informed recollections, and on a not-very-systematic survey of what I could find in scientific articles and reviews. Physics Today has been a helpful source; references to this journal in Part Three are abbreviated PT. The bibliography and the appendix on “further reading” list a good deal of the literature that the reader may wish to consult in order to go more deeply into the subjects covered by this book. The working title of the book was originally Revolution through Tradition. With this title I wanted to refer to the dialectics between existing theories and revolutionary changes that has been characteristic of physics during the twentieth century. There have indeed been revolutions in the theoretical frameworks of physics, but these have not been wholesale rejections of the classical traditions; on the contrary, they have been solidly connected with essential parts of the physics of Newton, Maxwell, and Helmholtz. Relativity theory and quantum mechanics, undoubtedly the two major revolutions in twentieth-century physical thought, were carefully constructed to correspond with existing theories in the classical limits. The respect for traditions has likewise been a characteristic theme in all the major theoretical changes that occurred after the completion of quantum mechanics. To the extent that these may be termed revolutionary, they have\n\nxiv\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nbeen conservative revolutions. Changes have been much less important on the methodological level than on the cognitive level. There have been some changes, but not of a fundamental nature. Basically, the accepted methods of science of the 1990s are the same methods that were accepted in the 1890s. If we are looking for really radical changes during the last three-quarters of the century, we should not look toward the methods, the conceptual structure, or the cognitive content of physics, but rather toward the basic fabric of the world, the ontology of physics; or we should look toward the social, economic, and political dimensions. In terms of manpower, organization, money, instruments, and political (and military) value, physics experienced a marked shift in the years following 1945. The sociopolitical changes made physics in 1960 a very different science than it had been a century earlier, but they did not cause a corresponding shift in the methodological and cognitive standards. In any event, this is not the place to discuss these broader issues at any length. In the book that follows, I have described, rather than analyzed, important parts of the development of physics between 1895 and 1995. The reader who is interested to draw the big picture say, to evaluate the revolutionary changes and make comparisons over the course of a century should be better equipped with the material and information that are presented here. I would like to express my thanks to my colleague Ole Knudsen, who read the manuscript and suggested various improvements. Helge Kragh Aarhus, Denmark\n\nPAR T O N E FROM CONSOLIDATION TO REVOLUTION\n\nChapter 1 ` FIN-DE-SIECLE PHYSICS: A WORLD PICTURE IN FLUX\n\nT\n\nHE PHILOSOPHER and mathematician Alfred North Whitehead once referred to the last quarter of the nineteenth century as “an age of successful scientific orthodoxy, undisturbed by much thought beyond the conventions. . . . one of the dullest stages of thought since the time of the First Crusade” (Whitehead 1925, 148). It is still commonly believed that physics at the end of the century was a somewhat dull affair, building firmly and complacently on the deterministic and mechanical world view of Newton and his followers. Physicists, so we are told, were totally unprepared for the upheavals that took place in two stages: first, the unexpected discoveries of x-rays, the electron, and radioactivity; and then the real revolution, consisting of Planck’s discovery of the quantum of action in 1900 and Einstein’s relativity theory of 1905. According to this received view, not only did Newtonian mechanics reign supreme until it was shattered by the new theories, but the Victorian generation of physicists also naively believed that all things worth knowing were already known or would soon become known by following the route of existing physics. Albert Michelson, the great American experimentalist, said in 1894 that “it seems probable that most of the grand underlying principles have been firmly established and that further advances are to be sought chiefly in the rigorous application of these principles to all the phenomena which come under our notice” (Badash 1972, 52). How ironic, then, that Professor R¨ontgen’s new rays the first of several discoveries that defied explanation in terms of the known “grand underlying principles” were announced only a year later. And how much more important the new physics of the early twentieth century appears if compared with views such as Michelson’s. The received view is in part a myth, but like most myths, it has a foundation in fact. For example, Michelson was not the only physicist of the decade who expressed the feeling that physics was essentially complete and that what remained was either applied physics, more precise measurements, or relatively minor discoveries. When Max Planck entered the University of Munich in 1875, he was warned by a professor of physics that his chosen subject was more or less finished and that nothing new could be expected to be discovered. Yet, although such feelings certainly existed among physicists, it is questionable how widespread they were. Very few theoretical physicists of the 1890s seem to have accepted Michelson’s view, and after the amazing discoveries of R¨ontgen, Henri Becquerel, J. J. Thomson, and the\n\n4\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nCuries, even the most conservative experimentalist was forced to realize its fallacy. What about the claim that physics a hundred years ago rested on orthodoxy and a complacent acceptance of Newtonian mechanics? Was there a mechanical worldview, or any commonly accepted worldview at all? Whereas the question of completeness can be discussed, it is squarely a myth that physicists stuck obstinately to the mechanical worldview until they were taught a lesson by Einstein in 1905 (or by Planck in 1900). The most important nonmechanical trend was based on electromagnetic theory, but this was only one of the indications of a widespread willingness to challenge the mechanical worldview and seek new foundations, either opposed to it or radical modifications of it. According to the classical mechanical world picture the Laplacian version of Newtonianism (not to be confused with Newton’s own ideas) the world consisted of atoms, which were the sites of, and on which acted, various forces of long and short ranges. The gravitational force was the paradigmatic example of such forces acting at a distance over empty space. With the advent of field theory, the mechanism of force propagation changed, but Maxwell and most other field physicists continued to seek a mechanical foundation for their models. The most important conceptual shift was perhaps the rise to prominence indeed, necessity of a universal ether as the quasihypothetical, continuous, and all-pervading medium through which forces propagated with a finite speed. In 1902, in the final part of a textbook on optics, Michelson declared his belief that “the day seems not far distant when the converging lines from many apparently remote regions of thought will meet on . . . common ground.” He went on, “Then the nature of the atoms, and the forces called into play in their chemical union; the interactions between these atoms . . . as manifested in the phenomena of light and electricity; the structures of the molecules and molecular systems of which the atoms are the units; the explanation of cohesion, elasticity, and gravitation all these will be marshaled into a single compact and consistent body of scientific knowledge” (Michelson 1902, 163). And this was the same Michelson who, eight years earlier, had suggested that physics was near its end. Was it the discoveries of the electron and radioactivity that caused the changed attitude? Or perhaps Planck’s discovery of the radiation law based on the notion of energy quantization? Not at all; these recent discoveries were not mentioned in the book. Michelson’s enthusiasm was rooted in “one of the grandest generalizations of modern science . . . that all the phenomena of the physical universe are only different manifestations of the various modes of motion of one allpervading substance the ether.” Maxwell considered the possibility of explaining gravitation in terms of his electromagnetic theory, but abandoned the attempt after realizing that he would then have to ascribe an enormous intrinsic energy to the ether. Other\n\nF I N - D E - S I E` C L E P H Y S I C S\n\n5\n\nVictorian physicists were less easily discouraged and there were, in the last quarter of the century, many attempts to either explain or revise Newton’s divine law of gravitation. Some of these attempts were based on electrodynamics, others on hydrodynamic models. For example, in the 1870s, the Norwegian physicist Carl A. Bjerknes studied the motion of bodies in an infinite and incompressible fluid and was led to the conclusion that two pulsating spheres would give rise to forces between them varying inversely to the separation of their centers. He considered this a kind of hydrodynamic explanation of gravitation, or at least an interesting analogy. Bjerknes’s work was taken up by some British theorists and, in 1898, was revived by the German Arthur Korn at the University of Munich, who developed a hydrodynamic theory of gravitation. At that time, however, electrodynamics was in focus, and complicated hydrodynamic models in the style of Bjerknes and Korn failed to arouse much interest. Related to hydrodynamical thinking, but of more importance and grandeur (if, in the end, no more successful), were the attempts to construct the world solely out of structures in the ether. The most important of the nonelectromagnetic theories was the vortex atomic theory, originally suggested in 1867 by William Thomson (later, Lord Kelvin) and subsequently developed by a whole school of British mathematical physicists. According to this theory, the atoms were vortical modes of motion of a primitive, perfect fluid, usually identified with the ether. In his Adams Prize essay of 1882, young J. J. Thomson gave an elaborate account of the vortex theory and extended it to cover chemical problems, including affinity and dissociation. The theory was also applied to electromagnetism, gravitation, and optics and was an ambitious attempt to establish a unitary and continuous “theory of everything” based solely on the dynamics of the ether. As late as 1895, William Hicks gave an optimistic report on the state of art of the vortex atom at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS). Hicks’s view of the goal of theoretical physics is worth quoting at some length: While, on the one hand, the end of scientific investigation is the discovery of laws, on the other, science will have reached its highest goal when it shall have reduced ultimate laws to one or two, the necessity of which lies outside the sphere of our recognition. These ultimate laws in the domain of physical science at least will be the dynamical laws of the relations of matter to number, space, and time. The ultimate data will be number, matter, space, and time themselves. When these relations shall be known, all physical phenomena will be a branch of pure mathematics. (BAAS Report 1895, 595)\n\nAs we shall see, very similar views continued to play an important role throughout the twentieth century. Although many of Hicks’s contemporaries would have subscribed to his philosophy, by 1895, the vortex theory of\n\n6\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\natoms had been abandoned by most physicists. Decades of theoretical work had led to no real progress and the grand vortex program was degenerating into sterile mathematics. Much the same can be said of another hydrodynamic atomic theory, the “ether squirt” theory worked out by the mathematician Karl Pearson in the 1880s and 1890s. According to this theory, the ultimate atom was a point in the ether from which new ether continuously flowed in all directions of space. Like the vortex theorists, Pearson applied his theory to a variety of problems and believed it would be able to explain in principle gravitation, electromagnetism, and chemical phenomena. Although Pearson’s theory did not attract the same kind of interest as the vortex theory, it is worth mentioning because it included not only sources but also sinks of ether that is, a kind of negative matter. Gravitationally “negative” matter, which repels ordinary matter but attracts other negative matter, had already been discussed in the 1880s by Hicks within the framework of the vortex atomic theory, and the strange concept reappeared in Pearson’s theory, as well as in other discussions of fin-de-si`ecle physics. For example, the British physicist Arthur Schuster speculated lightheartedly that there might exist entire stellar systems of antimatter, indistinguishable from our own except that the two stellar systems would be repelled rather than attracted. Not only did he introduce the names “antimatter” and “antiatoms” in 1898, but he also suggested that colliding matter and antimatter would annihilate each other, thus anticipating an important concept of later quantum physics. In Pearson’s version of antimatter, ether poured in at a squirt and disappeared from our world at a sink. Where, in the first place, did the ether come from? According to Pearson, writing in 1892, it would not simply appear ex nihilo, but would possibly come from a fourth dimension, to which it would again return. Here we have another concept, usually seen as an invention of twentieth-century relativity theory, turning up unexpectedly in the physics of the old worldview. In fact, ideas of hyperspaces and their possible significance in physics were not new in the 1890s. In 1870, the British mathematician William Kingdon Clifford used Riemann’s notion of curved, nonEuclidean geometry to suggest that the motion of matter and ether was in reality the manifestation of a variation of the curvature of space. This general idea of a “geometrization of physics” was well known at the end of the nineteenth century and inspired several physicists, astronomers, and mathematicians, not to mention science fiction authors, such as H. G. Wells. For example, in 1888, the eminent American astronomer Simon Newcomb suggested a model of the ether based on hyperdimensional space, and in 1900, the German Karl Schwarzschild made much use of non-Euclidean geometry in his astronomical work. Although these and other works were often speculative and always hypothetical, at the end of the century there existed a small group of researchers who considered hyperspace models of the ether\n\nF I N - D E - S I E` C L E P H Y S I C S\n\n7\n\nor otherwise attempted to link four-dimensional space to problems of physical interest. Speculative or not, such attempts were considered legitimate within the spirit of physics characteristic of the 1890s. The hydrodynamic ether models differed from the Laplacian program in physics, but they nonetheless rested on mechanical ground and were not attempts to overthrow the Newtonian worldview. Hydrodynamics, after all, is the mechanical science of fluid bodies. Thermodynamics, the science of heat and other manifestations of energy, constituted a much more difficult problem for the classical worldview. This branch of physics was sometimes argued not only to be different from mechanics in principle, but also to have priority over mechanics as a more satisfactory foundation on which all of physics could be built. In the 1890s, together with electrodynamics, thermodynamics entered as a competitor to mechanics as far as foundational problems were concerned. In this decade, there was a continual discussion of the unity of physics, and it was not at all clear what discipline could best serve as the foundation of the unity that almost all physicists believed their science must have. Whereas the law of energy conservation was successfully explained in mechanical terms, the second law of thermodynamics did not succumb so easily to mechanical principles. For one thing, the laws of mechanics are reversible, or symmetric in time, whereas the second law of thermodynamics expresses an irreversible change in entropy. In his famous statisticalmechanical theory of entropy, developed first in 1872 and more fully in 1877, Ludwig Boltzmann believed he had reduced the second law to molecular-mechanical principles, but his interpretation was challenged and became the subject of much controversy. One of his critics, the German physicist Ernst Zermelo, argued in 1896 from Poincar´e’s so-called recurrence theorem that the second law could not be derived from mechanics and thus was incompatible with a unitary mechanical world picture. Boltzmann denied the validity of Zermelo’s argument and remained convinced that there was no deep disagreement between mechanics and thermodynamics. According to the physicist Georg Helm and the chemist Ludwig Ostwald, both Germans, energy was the most important of the unifying concepts of the physical sciences. A generalized thermodynamics was therefore held to replace mechanics as the foundation of physics. Helm and Ostwald came to this conclusion about 1890 and called their new program energetics. The new science of energetics was, in many ways, contrary to the mechanical world picture and was thought of as a revolt against what was called “scientific materialism.” This revolt included the position that mechanics was to be subsumed under the more general laws of energetics in the sense that the mechanical laws were held to be reducible to energy principles. Another aspect of energetics was its denial of atomism as other than a useful mental representation. Ostwald and some other physical chemists, including Pierre\n\n8\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nDuhem in France, argued that the belief in atoms and molecules was metaphysical and that all empirical phenomena could be explained without the atomic hypothesis. The energetics program was considered enough of a challenge to the traditional molecular-mechanical view that it was taken up as a discussion theme at the annual meeting of the German Association of Natural Scientists and Physicians in L¨ubeck in 1895. The meeting featured a famous discussion between Boltzmann, who attacked the energeticists, and Helm and Ostwald, who argued against the mechanical world picture. It is interesting to note that neither Boltzmann nor others present at the meeting simply defended the classical-mechanical worldview or fully subscribed to the views that Helm and Ostwald criticized. Boltzmann declared that the mechanical worldview was a dead issue and that the “view that no other explanation can exist except that of the motion of material points, the laws of which are determined by central forces, had generally been abandoned long before Mr. Ostwald’s remarks” (Jungnickel and McCormmach 1986, 222). All the same, Boltzmann saw no merit in the energetics program and preferred to work on a mechanical foundation, feeling that it alone was sufficiently developed to secure scientific progress. The energetics alternative received only modest support among physicists and chemists, but criticism of the atomic theory and emphasis on the fundamentality of the energy concept were repeated also by many scientists not directly associated with the energetics program. The leading French physicist, Pierre Curie perhaps better known as the husband of Marie Curie may be an example. In accordance with his positivistic view of science, Curie refrained from materialistic and atomistic hypotheses and favored a phenomenalism inspired by the laws of thermodynamics. He, and several other French physicists, held thermodynamics to be the ideal of physical theory. They argued that energy, not matter, was the essence of a reality that could be understood only as processes or actions. From the early 1880s onward, the Austrian physicist-philosopher Ernst Mach argued for a phenomenological understanding of physics, according to which physical theories and concepts were economical ways of organizing sense data. Mach admitted the usefulness of molecular mechanics, but considered it neither a fundamental theory nor one expressing physical reality. From a foundational point of view, he preferred the energy principles to the laws of mechanics. Again in agreement with Ostwald and his allies, Mach held that atoms were nothing but convenient fictions. Moreover, Mach criticized the very heart of mechanics, the idea of force as expressed by Newton’s second law. A somewhat similar foundational criticism of mechanics from a positivistic point of view was undertaken by Heinrich Hertz in his 1894 reformulation of mechanics, building only on the fundamental conceptions of space, time and mass. However, this kind of critical analysis of mechanics did not neces-\n\nF I N - D E - S I E` C L E P H Y S I C S\n\n9\n\nsarily involve a wish to abandon the mechanical world picture. In the case of Mach it did, but to Hertz, the new versions of mechanics merely affirmed this picture of the world. In fact, a major aim of Hertz’s force-free mechanics was to establish a mechanical theory of the electromagnetic ether. The mechanical worldview was no longer considered progressive in the 1890s, and even traditionalists had to admit that it was not universally successful. Apart from the troubled relationship between mechanics and the entropy law, there was an older problem related to the kinetic theory of gases. As early as 1860, Maxwell had observed that the measured ratios between the specific heats of diatomic gases at constant pressure (cp) and at constant volume (cv) did not agree with the equipartition theorem based on the mechanical theory. According to this theory, γ cp/cv 1 2/n, where n is the number of degrees of freedom of the molecule. The problem was that the predicted result for diatomic gases matched experiments (which gave γ 1.4) only if it was assumed that the molecule was rigid and had no internal parts; this assumption seemed inconsistent with the results of spectroscopy, which strongly indicated internal vibrations exchanging energy with the ether. The problem was recognized as an anomaly, but of course, it needed more than a single anomaly to shatter the mechanical world view. Yet the apparent failure of the equipartition theorem was considered serious enough to figure as one of the two clouds in a famous lecture, “Nineteenth Century Clouds Over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light,” that Lord Kelvin delivered before the Royal Institution in April 1900. The other threat was the failure to explain the motion of the earth through the ether, as exhibited by the ether drift experiment of Michelson and Edward Morley. (For this, see chapter 7.) The new physics that arose in the early years of the twentieth century was not a revolt against a petrified Newtonian worldview, something analogous to the revolt of Galileo against Aristotelianism. By 1905, the mechanical worldview had been under attack for more than a decade, and for this reason alone, there never was much of a clash between Einstein and Newton. Even more important than the opposition inspired by thermodynamics and energetics was the new and vigorous trend in electromagnetic theory that characterized the 1890s. We shall deal in more detail with this so-called electromagnetic worldview in chapter 8, and here we only emphasize its importance and key elements. The basic problem of physics in the late nineteenth century was perhaps the relationship between ether and matter: Was the ether the fundamental substratum out of which matter was constructed? Or, on the contrary, was matter a more fundamental ontological category of which the ether was just a special instance? The first view, where primacy was given to structures in the ether, became increasingly more common at the turn of the century, when mechanical ether models were replaced by electrodynamic models.\n\n10\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nIf electromagnetism was more fundamental than mechanics, it made sense to try to derive the mechanical laws from those of electromagnetism, and this was precisely what many theoretical physicists aimed at. Electromagnetism was considered a unifying principle of all science, not unlike the role assigned to energy in Ostwald’s energetics. The way in which Ostwald and his energeticist allies spoke of “matter as subordinate to energy” and “all events [being] ultimately nothing but a change in energy” was strikingly similar to the rhetoric of the electrodynamicists, only with “ether” or “electromagnetic field” substituted for “energy.” In both cases, materialism was discarded and matter declared an epiphenomenon. Joseph Larmor, the eminent British theorist, had no difficulty imagining a world based on a nonmaterial, transcendent ether. He admitted, as he wrote in 1900, that this might seem “as leaving reality behind us,” but defended his ether worldview by arguing that it described an inner reality not directly accessible to the senses (Larmor 1900, vi). This was an argument that Mach, Ostwald, and other phenomenalists would not have accepted. At the beginning of the new century, the monistic, electromagnetic worldview was accepted by a growing proportion of avant-garde physicists in Germany, England, France, and the United States. Physics consisted of the physics of matter and the physics of the electromagnetic ether, and the trend to avoid the unwanted dualism was to identify matter with ether, rather than the other way around. This is not to say that there were no dissenting voices or that the electromagnetic doctrine permeated the entire field of physics. There were physicists who years before Einstein rejected the ether as a metaphysical concept, and there were those who continued to search for mechanical models of the ether or even considered the ether as a special state of ordinary matter. Textbooks of this period usually rested on a mechanical basis and did not reflect the change in worldview discussed in frontier theoretical physics. This is how textbooks usually are: They are by nature conservative and cautious in their attitude toward modern ideas. The trend of theoretical physics around 1900 was more than a shift in fundamental ideas from mechanics to thermo- and electrodynamics, and it was more than the result of a number of spectacular discoveries. It was part of a change in worldview that had ramifications outside physics and was nourished by the particular Zeitgeist of the period, a spirit of time sometimes characterized as neoromantic. The historian Russell McCormmach has aptly summarized the situation as follows: “The whole cultural configuration at the turn of the century was implicated in the change from mechanical to electromagnetic thinking. The immaterial electromagnetic concepts were attractive in the same measure that the inert, material imagery of mechanics was displeasing” (McCormmach 1970, 495). One important element of this cultural configuration was a widespread antimaterialism. Taking different shapes in the different scientific nations, the antimateralistic doctrine\n\nF I N - D E - S I E` C L E P H Y S I C S\n\n11\n\namounted to the belief that “matter is dead.” If matter was not the ultimate reality, but merely some manifestation of an immaterial ether, it would not seem unreasonable to challenge other established doctrines derived from the physics of matter, including the permanence of chemical elements and the laws of conservation of matter and energy. Indeed, in some quarters, the very qualities of permanence and conservation were considered suspicious within a world view emphasizing transformation, evolution, and becoming. As an example, consider the French psychologist and amateur physicist Gustave LeBon, who, in 1896, reported the discovery of what he called “black light” a new kind of invisible radiation that he believed was distinct from, but possibly related to, x-rays and cathode rays. Although LeBon’s discovery claim did not fare well, his general ideas of matter, radiation, and ether were received favorably by the public and were, to some extent, representative of the period’s Zeitgeist in scientific circles. In his book The Evolution of Matter, a hit that went through twelve editions and sold 44,000 copies, LeBon concluded that all matter is unstable, constantly emitting radiation or “effluvia.” Material qualities were held to be epiphenomena exhibited by matter in the process of transforming into the imponderable ether from which it had once originated. According to LeBon, there was no dualism between energy and matter, which just represented different stages in an evolutionary process, the end result of which was the pure ethereal state. Among his many arguments for the continual degradation of matter into ether, LeBon considered radioactivity to be particularly convincing. He shared the view of many physicists that radioactivity is a property exhibited by all matter. Then, if all chemical elements emitted ether-like radiations, would they not slowly melt away and would this not prove the nonmateriality of matter? Or, as LeBon expressed it rather more dramatically, would the ether not represent “the final nirvana to which all things return after a more or less ephemeral existence” (LeBon 1905, 315)? LeBon and many of his contemporaries believed that this was indeed the case. LeBon’s quasiscientific speculations had considerable appeal among the many scientists who were dissatisfied with positivistic ideals and longed for an undogmatic, more youthful science that would better satisfy what they associated with the human spirit. His ideas struck a chord in a period that has been described as a “revolt against positivism” and even but less justifiably a “revolt from reason” (MacLeod 1982, 3). Among those who listened with sympathy to LeBon’s arguments was the great Henri Poincar´e. But LeBon was not a theoretical physicist and his views, although fashionable, were not particularly modern. If he was not taken too seriously by physicists outside France, it may have been because he failed to incorporate the electromagnetic ether into his speculations. Although it is reasonable to speak of a general spirit of physics about the turn of the century, the degree of consensus should not be exaggerated. There were considerable differences\n\n12\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\namong the views of leading individual physicists and there were also important national differences. In Germany and France, for instance, the reaction against the mechanical worldview was more often associated with positivistic virtues and thermodynamic ideals than was the case in England. British physicists typically had no sympathy for the positivistic, fact-oriented view of science championed by Pierre Curie, Duhem, Ostwald, Mach, and others. In 1896, in a critical comment on Ostwald’s energetics, the Irish physicist George FitzGerald distinguished between the metaphysically receptive British style and the inductive, unphilosophical German style. “A Briton wants emotion,” he wrote, “something to raise enthusiasm, something with a human interest” (Wynne 1979, 171). The battle cry for emotions, actions, and evolutionary processes “with a human interest” was repeated by French neoromanticists, who contrasted their style with that of the supposedly unimaginative Germans. At the same time, they objected to the British style of physics, which they found too mechanistic and lacking in esprit.\n\nChapter 2 THE WORLD OF PHYSICS\n\nPersonnel and Resources\n\nW\n\nHO WERE THE physicists around 1900? How many were there and how were they distributed among nations and institutions? What kind of physics did they work with? How were they funded? Let us first look at the number of physicists that is, people contributing to the advance of physics either directly, as researchers, or indirectly, as teachers. Not much is known about the social background of physicists at the turn of the century, but a study of German physics showed that the typical young German physicist came from the higher strata of society, the middle and upper classes. He and it was always a he was socially indistinguishable from the young humanist scholar. Chemists, on the other hand and organic chemists in particular more often came from the business community (table 2.1). The difference probably reflected the close connection between chemistry and German industry, a connection that had not yet grown strong with respect to physics. The meaning of the term “physicist” has, of course, changed over time, but by 1900, the meaning of the word did not differ significantly from its modern meaning; physics had by then reached a professional level that bore more resemblance to what it would be in 1990 than to what it was in 1810. The large majority of physicists i.e., contributors to the physics research literature were professionals in the sense that they earned their living as faculty members of physical institutes at either universities or polytechnical colleges (such as the Technische Hochschulen in Germany). Gifted amateurs, secondary school teachers, and wealthy individuals still played a role, but it was small and rapidly diminishing. A large number of engineers and technical experts were engaged in applied physics (industrial and medical, for example) and could reasonably be classified as physicists as well. However, we will limit ourselves to those occupying teaching positions explicitly devoted to physics, so-called academic physicists. As in science generally, physics was almost exclusively a European-American phenomenon, notwithstanding the rise of Japan and the work done in the English, German, Dutch, and other colonies (mostly by whites). From table 2.2 it appears, first of all, that physics in 1900 was a small world. The total number of academic physicists in the world was probably somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500. (In comparison, by 1900 membership\n\n14\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nTable 2.1 Social Background of German Doctoral Scientists\n\nField Physics Math and astronomy Organic chemistry Nonorganic chemistry Humanities\n\nYear\n\nNo. of doctorates\n\nMiddle and upper professional classes (%)\n\nBusiness community (%)\n\nAgriculture (%)\n\n1899 1913 1899 1913 1899 1913 1899 1913 1899 1913\n\n56 68 19 8 99 99 77 42 64 441\n\n52 53 53 50 25 33 29 40 50 50\n\n36 40 39 50 66 57 61 45 44 38\n\n9 7 16 0 8 10 10 14 6 4\n\nNote: Data for the year 1899 are means of 1896 1902.

Moreover, this small world was dominated by a few countries, of which Britain, France, Germany, and the United States were by far the most important; their total of some 600 physicists made up almost half the world population of physicists.

Notice that by 1900, the United States already had more physicists than any other nation, and that the density of physicists among the “big four” was the same (about 2.9 per million of population) and considerably less than in Switzerland and the Netherlands. Although the United States was quantitatively a leader in physics, it was far behind the three European powers when it came to productivity and original research. This was in part the result of a climate at the major American universities that was still foreign indeed, often hostile to the German ideals of research and scholarship as essential elements of the career of university teachers. In 1889, the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) stated that “Our aim should be: the mind of the student, not scientific discovery, not professional accomplishment” a view unlikely to lead to much scientific research (Kevles 1987, 34). Ten years later, on the threshold of the twentieth century, Henry Rowland gave an address before the newly formed American Physical Society. A staunch advocate of pure science, Rowland shared the German ideal of physics as culture and free research. “We form a small and unique body of men, a new variety of the human race,” Rowland told his audience. The new body was “an aristocracy, not of wealth, not of pedigree, but of intellect and of ideals, holding him in the highest respect who adds the most to our knowledge or who strives after it as the highest good.” Rowland knew very well that his view was not shared by many of his compatriots. He deplored that “much of the intellect of the country is still wasted in the pursuit of socalled practical science which ministers to our physical needs [whereas] but little thought and money is given to the grander portion of the subject which appeals to our intellect alone” (Rowland 1902, 668). At the time of Rowland’s address, things were rapidly changing and American physics on its way to become a major factor in world physics. In 1893 the first issue of Physical Review appeared, in 1899 the American Physical Society was founded, and two years later Congress authorized $250,000 to build the National Bureau of Standards. In that same year, Andrew Carnegie endowed the enormous sum of $10 million to found an institution to encourage basic research. The result, the Carnegie Institution, had a stimulating effect on research at American universities. The membership of the American Physical Society indicates the growth of the physics profession in the United States. From fewer than one hundred members in 1899, ten years later membership had increased to 495. By 1914 it had passed 700, and during the following decade the growth rate was even higher (see figure 2.1). By 1910, American physics was moving out of the shadow of Europe, even though the country was still weak in theoretical physics and most of the contributions appearing in Physical Review did not\n\n16\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nFigure 2.1.

Notwithstanding eminent physicists such as Robert Wood, Albert Michelson, Robert Millikan, and Gilbert Lewis, American physics was still relatively provincial and dependent on what happened in Europe. Ludwig Boltzmann visited the University of California, Berkeley, in 1905. He found the nature beautiful and the ladies stout, but was less impressed by the local standards in theoretical physics. As he wrote in the popular essay “A German Professor’s Trip to El Dorado,” first published in 1905: “Yes, America will achieve great things. I believe in these people, even after seeing them at work in a setting where they’re not at their best: integrating and differentiating at a theoretical physics seminar . . .” (Boltzmann 1992, 51). Physics has always been international and contacts between physicists of different nationalities, including meetings and collaborations, were frequent\n\nTHE WORLD OF PHYSICS\n\n17\n\nin the nineteenth century. Organized conferences of a larger scope were rare, however, and it was not until the summer of 1900 that the first International Congress of Physics convened in Paris. At the same time, and in the same city, two hundred mathematicians participated in the International Congress of Mathematics, the second of its kind. The physics conference was organized by the French Physical Society in connection with the World Exhibition in Paris that year. The three-volume proceedings of the congress included seventy scientific review papers written by physicists from fifteen countries. Not surprisingly, the majority of the papers (36) were French. They were followed by 10 German contributions and 6 from the British, whereas the fourth of the major scientific nations, the United States, contributed only 2 papers. Also represented were physicists from the Netherlands (4 papers), Russia (4), Italy (3), Austria-Hungary (3), Denmark (2), Norway (2), Sweden (2), Belgium (2), and Switzerland (2); nonwhites were represented by papers delivered by one Japanese and one Indian. Of course the strong French representation at the Paris congress should not be taken as a correspondingly strong position in world physics in fact, French physics, and especially theoretical physics, was declining at the time and was no longer competitive with physics in Germany and Britain. The subjects dealt with at the Paris congress covered a wide range, if not the entire spectrum of contemporary physics. Table 2.3 shows the subjects of the invited papers. There were lectures on metrology, elasticity, critical phenomena, mechanical and thermal properties of solids and liquids, spectroscopy, light pressure, Hertzian waves, magneto-optics, atmospheric electricity, solar physics, biophysics, and gravitation. Nor were the most recent discoveries forgotten: Henri Becquerel and the Curies lectured on radioactivity, Wilhelm Wien and Otto Lummer on blackbody radiation (theoretical and experimental, respectively), Paul Villard on cathode rays, and J. J. Thomson on the electron theory and atomic constitution. Villard’s discussion of cathode rays could hardly have satisfied Thomson, nor most of the other attending physicists. Three years after Thomson’s celebrated identification of cathode rays with Table 2.3 Distribution of Subjects of Invited Papers at the 1900 Paris Conference Subjects\n\nNumber\n\nPercent\n\nElectricity and magnetism Mechanical and molecular physics General questions; measure and units Optics and thermodynamics Cosmic physics Magneto optics, cathode rays, uranium rays Biological physics\n\n22 19 15 14 9 8 5\n\n24 20 16 15 10 9 6\n\n18\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nfree electrons, the French physicist argued that cathode rays did not consist of electrons, but of hydrogen ions. Compared with later standards, physics was a ridiculously inexpensive activity, but from the perspective of contemporary standards for science funding, things looked different. Adding to the expenditures for salaries and equipment were the many new laboratories that were created in the 1890s and the early years of the twentieth century (see table 2.4). Between 1890 and 1914, 22 new physics laboratories were built in Germany, 19 in the British Empire, 13 in the United States, and 12 in France. Although Germany erected the most institutions, British and American investments were substantially greater. While Germany invested a total of 10,300 marks per physicist per year, American investments were the equivalent of 14,000 marks, and British investments 15,500 marks. Of course these are average figures, and there were great variations from physicist to physicist and from institute to institute, with experimentalists being much more expensive to support than theorists. For example, whereas the institute of physics at Berlin University received 26,174 marks in 1909, Planck’s small institute for theoretical physics had to do with a budget of 700 marks. The rise in physics facilities was closely related to the marked change toward research as the prime function of higher education that had its roots in Germany and became fully accepted in most other countries only around 1900. At that time, the research student became a central figure in any physics institution of significance, and with the influx of research students came the need for more laboratory space. Data from Leipzig University are revealing: When the institute of physics was built in 1835, 12 percent of its Table 2.4 Physics Institutes and Faculty\n\nAustria Hungary Belgium United Kingdom British Empire, other France Germany Italy Japan Netherlands Scandinavia Switzerland United States\n\nNo. of institutes\n\nFaculty, 1900\n\nFaculty, 1910\n\n18 4 25 7 19 30 16 2 4 7 8 21\n\n48 9 87 10 54 103 43 6 10 18 17 100\n\n59 10 106 13 58 139 51 17 13 26 23 169\n\nNote: Based on data in Forman, Heilbron and Weart 1975.\n\nTHE WORLD OF PHYSICS\n\n19\n\narea was planned for laboratory use; in 1873 the institute was expanded by a factor of four, and laboratory space increased to 46 percent; another expansion, in 1904 and by a factor of three, resulted in 60 percent for laboratories and rooms for graduate students. Thus, during a period of seventy years, space for research had increased roughly sixty times. Research work as part of graduate studies went back to Justus Liebig’s chemical laboratory in Giessen in the 1830s and became institutionalized in physics at many German universities in the 1870s and 1880s. But it was not a self-evident policy, even at major German universities. The physics institute at the University of T¨ubingen was erected in the late 1880s, and at that time, “it was not expected that students in the institute would carry out independent scientific investigations,” as Friedrich Paschen reported in 1906, adding that “in this respect, the situation has been essentially altered in the last ten years” (Forman, Heilbron and Weart 1975, 103). Until about 1890, in the United States and many other countries it was not even expected that professors would carry out independent scientific investigations. The Jefferson Physical Laboratory at Harvard University was completed in 1884. Housing laboratories and a large lecture room, it was intended for both instruction and research. John Trowbridge, the laboratory’s director from 1888 to 1910, was well aware that it was high time to follow the German tradition in physics. In 1884 he warned against “the lecture or recitation system unsupported by laboratory work” still so common, and initiated laboratory-based courses for which the new laboratory was well suited. Twelve years later, he could look back on a period of change both in instruction and research: “To-day a certain amount of original work is expected of [the physics professor at Harvard]. During the past ten years more original research has been done in Harvard University than in the previous two hundred years” (Aronovitch 1989, 95 and 99).\n\nPhysics Journals What, then, came out of the investments in physics? Physicists, like other scientists, produce papers; the number of research papers is the most direct measure of scientific productivity. By 1900 physics journals existed in more or less the same format as today, but of course in fewer numbers and much less specialized. Although the largest and most substantial part of physical research was published in special physics journals, there were also many articles that appeared in journals or yearbooks covering other scientific disciplines as well. Examples are Comptes Rendus, published by the Academy of Sciences in Paris, the G¨ottingen Nachrichten, published by the G¨ottingen Society of Science, and the Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Many countries had local journals devoted to\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nphysics, usually written in the local language and often published by the local physical society, but research papers of international significance rarely appeared in journals of smaller countries. Such papers were typically included in the core physics journals of the large Western nations, which were Philosophical Magazine (England), Journal de Physique (France), Annalen der Physik (Germany), Nuovo Cimento (Italy), and Physical Review (the United States). Table 2.5 gives the number of physics papers in 1900 and shows that Germany was clearly ahead of the other nations, both in the production of papers and in productivity per physicist. Germany’s strong position in physics, quantitatively as well as qualitatively, was unquestionable. As to the quality, or what later historians of science have judged to be important contributions to physics, the authoritative Dictionary of Scientific Bibliography lists 197 physicists who were more than twenty years old in 1900. Of these, 52 were Germans and six Austrians. The nationalities of other top physicists included in the Dictionary were as follows: Britain with 35, France with 34, the United States with 27, Russia with 9, the Netherlands and Italy both with 7, and Sweden with 5. This is very much the same list as appeared in other evaluations. To a significant extent, high-quality physical research was concentrated in the four economic and political leaders of the world. These accounted for 75 percent of the historically important physicists of the period. If Austria-Hungary, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia are included in a Germanic bloc, the figures are 86 percent for the “big four” and 38 percent for the Germanic bloc. Data from the Nobel prize awards speak roughly the same language: Of the twenty prize winners between 1901 and 1914, sixteen were from the big four (but only one American), and so were 77 percent of the suggested candidates. The leading physics journal in the first decade of the twentieth century was probably Annalen der Physik, although in the English-speaking world it was rivaled by Philosophical Magazine. Annalen went back to 1799, when its title was Annalen der Physik und Chemie, but when Paul Drude took over Table 2.5 Physics Journals in 1900 Country\n\nCore physics journal\n\nPapers, 1900\n\nPercent\n\nProductivity\n\nBritain France Germany Italy USA All other\n\nPhilosophical Magazine Journal de Physique Annalen der Physik Nuovo Cimento Physical Review\n\n420 360 580 120 240 280\n\n19 18 29 6 12 14\n\n2.2 2.5 3.2 1.4 1.1\n\nNote: The last column gives the average number of papers per academic physicist.\n\nTHE WORLD OF PHYSICS\n\n21\n\nthe editorship in 1900 the “Chemie” was dropped there were already enough journals in chemistry and physical chemistry, and Annalen had long ago begun to concentrate on pure physics. After Drude’s death in 1906, Wilhelm Wien became editor, with Planck continuing as co-editor and being responsible for theoretical physics. As Annalen was a German journal, naturally the large majority of the contributors were Germans, but there were also many contributions from Austrian, Scandinavian, and Dutch physicists. Annalen was a prestigious journal for pure research and almost all of its articles were written by university physicists or physicists at major physical laboratories, such as the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (Imperial Institute of Physics and Technology) in Berlin. Prestigious as Annalen was, however, it was not particularly difficult to get articles published in it. The journal included a large number of dull and insignificant articles, often experimental doctoral dissertations only slightly abbreviated. In sharp contrast with later publication practice, in 1906 the rejection rate, according to Planck’s estimate, was only 5 to 10 percent of the submitted papers. The growth in physics was reflected in the gradual expansion of Annalen, which increased its annual number of issues from twelve in 1900 to sixteen in 1912. In addition to the journal, where completed research was published in papers that were often very long, an abstracting journal, the Beibl¨atter zu den Annalen der Physik, was published as a sequel. It is well known that the characteristic pattern of physics literature, and scientific literature in general, is exponential growth. However, there are reasons to believe that the much discussed “law” of exponential growth is valid only for post-1920 science. As far as physics is concerned, the number of papers reviewed in the leading abstract journals was roughly constant during the the period 1900 10. The Beibl¨atter of 1900 reviewed 2,468 articles on its 1,358 pages; ten years later, the journal included 2,984 articles in its 1,312 pages. The number of papers appearing in Fortschritte der Physik likewise fluctuated between 1,872 and 2,825 during this period. There was no sign of systematic increase, exponential or otherwise. During the first decade of the century, the Annalen became more oriented toward the kind of theoretical physics that Planck wanted to promote. It carried many articles on electron theory, relativity, quantum theory, thermodynamics, and theories of gravitation. For two decades, the journal was the flagship of the new trends in theoretical physics. These trends were also reflected in the biweekly Physikalische Zeitschrift, first published in 1899 and specializing in smaller articles. However, this journal did not have quite the quality of the Annalen and was often used by authors whose manuscripts had been declined by Planck and Wien. Yet another new German physics periodical was the Jahrbuch f¨ur Radioaktivit¨at und Elektronik, founded in 1904 and edited by Johannes Stark. As indicated by its title, the Jahrbuch specialized in the physics originating in the great discoveries of the 1890s,\n\n22\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nTable 2.6 Publications in Spectroscopy, 1890 1910\n\nGermany England France United States Italy Others Total\n\n1890\n\n1895\n\n1900\n\n1905\n\n1910\n\n81 52 32 31 5 17 218\n\n105 60 41 37 11 33 287\n\n167 62 42 44 11 39 365\n\n144 73 74 70 13 42 416\n\n171 69 53 67 11 41 412\n\nSource: Kayser 1938.\n\nespecially radioactivity, x-rays, and electron physics. (Elektronik or “Electronics” at this time meant the physics of the electron and did not yet have the later engineering meaning.) Stark’s Jahrbuch was almost purely devoted to experimental subjects and did not include electromagnetic theories of the electron or similar topics in its definition of “electronics.” If there was a field and technique of physics that characterized the entire discipline, perhaps spectroscopy would be a good candidate. Spectroscopy, both experimental and theoretical, was in many ways the leading field of physics, and it continued to occupy a very prominent position for two decades. Papers on spectroscopy, listed under the entries “spectra” and “Zeeman effect,” made up 3.2 percent of all papers abstracted in Science Abstracts in 1898. In 1908 the figure had risen to 6.2 percent. The German spectroscopist Heinrich Kayser boasted that he had a complete collection of papers in his area of research. In 1938 the 85-year-old physicist published a statistical study of the development of spectroscopy (table 2.6). Not only do the data present a picture of the development of spectroscopy, but they also give a crude indication of the distribution of physics among different nations in the period 1890 to 1910.\n\nA Japanese Look at European Physics Physics was practically nonexistent in Japan before 1870; even at the turn of the century, institutes for scientific research were few and badly equipped. Physics was taught at Tokyo University, established in 1877, but research was given a very low priority. “There was no provision in the university budget for research,” recalled a physicist about the conditions in the early years of the new century. “In the faculty of science of the University of Tokyo in those days, the operating budget was only about 5,000 yen [about $2,500] for physics and 4,000 yen for chemistry. This was hardly enough to\n\nTHE WORLD OF PHYSICS\n\n23\n\npay for the instruments, chemicals, books, journals, specimens, charcoal, gas and electricity needed to teach students, much less to carry on research” (Nakayama, Swain, and Yagi 1974, 166). Hantaro Nagaoka who will be discussed further in chapter 4 was one of the pioneers of Japanese physics. He graduated from the new Tokyo University in 1887 and from 1893 to 1896 he went to Europe on an extended study tour, continuing his studies at the universities of Munich, Berlin, and Vienna. In July 1910, by then a professor at the Tokyo Imperial University (as Tokyo University had been renamed) and Japan’s foremost physicist, he again set off to Europe for an extended study tour. He attended international congresses, visited several of the most eminent physics institutes, paid homage to the heroes of physics (dead or alive), and established contacts with important physicists. What Nagaoka saw on his study tour, and reported in his letters, was a fairly representative sample of what went on among firstrate European physicists and at that time physics was still, to a large extent, identical with European physics. An active researcher in both experimental and theoretical aspects of physics (and competent in French, German, and English), Nagaoka was well qualified to give a reliable report on the state of physics in Europe, and perhaps one that was more objective than reports given by the Europeans themselves. In a letter of November 1910 to the Italian physicist Augusto Righi, an experimentalist who worked in electricity and optics, Nagaoka mentioned that he went from Bologna (where he had stayed with Righi) to Rome, and from there to Geneva, Zurich, Munich, and Berlin. These were some of his impressions: There are many interesting magnetic works going on in Prof. Weiss’s laboratory in Zurich, where I have seen an electromagnet giving more than 80,000 Gauss. In Munich, Ebert is engaged in works connected with atmospheric electricity, and several interesting investigations are being undertaken in R¨ontgen’s laboratory and in [the] institute of theoretical physics under Sommerfeld. The Technische Hoch schule in Munich has also [an] institute of technical physics, where Joule Kelvin effect on the outflow of gases through porous plugs is investigated, and specific heat of steam under high pressure and temperature has already been examined in connection with the signification [sic] on the use of steam turbines. The only point of difference from the ordinary physical laboratory seems to lie in the use of ma chines of high power, and in the cooperation of mechanical engineers with the physicists. (Carazza and Kragh 1991, 39)\n\nIn the same letter, Nagaoka regretted the lack of interest that European physicists had shown his atomic theory of 1904 (see chapter 4) and intimated that the neglect was the result of J. J. Thomson’s dominant position as the authority in atomic theory. “The ponderous name of the eminent English physicist seemed to me sufficiently weighty to suppress the work of an Oriental physi-\n\n24\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\ncist,” he complained. Nagaoka was always acutely aware of being an Oriental in a field dominated by whites, and he fought hard to prove that Japanese science was not necessarily inferior to that of the West. In a letter of 1888 he wrote, “There is no reason why the whites shall be so supreme in everything, and . . . I hope we shall be able to beat those yattya hottya [pompous] people in the course of 10 or 20 years” (Koizumi 1975, 87). To the new generation of Japanese scientists, scientific rivalry could not be wholly separated from racial rivalry. The busy Japanese traveler also visited Ernest Rutherford in Manchester, Heike Kammerlingh Onnes in Leiden, Pieter Zeeman in Amsterdam, and ´ Edouard Sarasin in Geneva; and in Germany he added to Munich and Berlin the universities or polytechnics of Bonn, Strassburg, Aachen, Heidelberg, W¨urzburg, Karlsruhe, Leipzig, G¨ottingen, and Breslau. To Rutherford he reported details about the many institutions. He was impressed by Kammerlingh Onnes’s low-temperature laboratory and speculated whether radioactive decay would remain unaffected at the few degrees above absolute zero obtainable there. In Amsterdam, Nagaoka “saw Zeeman investigating the effect bearing his name,” and in Leyden he listened to Hendrik Lorentz “discussing [Felix] Ehrenhaft’s curious result on the charge of electrons,” namely the existence of sub-electrons; when visiting the physical institute in Berlin, “[Erich] Regener was repeating Ehrenhaft’s experiment and announced that the result was entirely wrong.” It is obvious from Nagaoka’s report that he considered Germany the leading nation in physics. He described Philipp Lenard’s radiological institute at Heidelberg University as “perhaps one of the most active in Germany” and added that “Professor Lenard and most of his pupils are working on the phosophorescence and photoelectric action.” Among the activities in G¨ottingen, he singled out Emil Wiechert’s seismological research and Woldemar Voigt’s laboratory, which “is justly celebrated for the numerous works, which are connected with the physics of crystals and the magneto- and electro-optics. There were more than 20 research students.” He described Lummer’s institute in Breslau, which specialized in optics, as “splendid.” But not all was praise: “The physical institute in Leipzig is perhaps the largest in Germany; but I find that the largest is not always the best. However poor the laboratory may be, it will flourish if it has earnest investigators and an able director. The size and the equipment of the laboratory seems to me to play a secondary part in the scientific investigations” (Badash 1967, 60). Nagaoka’s account was limited to classical physics. He did not mention quantum theory, and relativity theory only in passing “In Munich . . . there is also an institute for theoretical physics under Sommerfeld, who is working on the principle of relativity.” This was not because Nagaoka was a conservative who had not discovered the revolution that supposedly took place in physics during the first decade of the century. Classical physics was com-\n\nTHE WORLD OF PHYSICS\n\n25\n\npletely dominant at the time and in a healthy, progressive state; the new theories of quanta and relativity were cultivated only by a very small minority of the physics community and were scarcely visible in the general landscape of physics. If there was a revolution under way, few were aware of it. This impression is confirmed by an analysis of the distribution of physics specialities taken from leading abstract journals. Thus, the 2,984 articles included in the 1910 volume of the Beibl¨atter zu den Annalen der Physik (see table 2.7) show that almost half the publications were in optics (16 percent) and electricity and magnetism (31 percent). The category “cosmic physics” might lead one to think of astrophysics or physical cosmology in a modern sense, but that would be anachronistic. Astrophysics and cosmological subjects did appear in the category, but so did astronomical spectroscopy, geophysics, meteorology, atmospheric electricity, and geomagnetism. In the abstracting journal of the Berlin Physical Society, Fortschritte der Physik, “cosmic physics” was introduced in 1890, at the same time as the term “geophysics.” (“Astrophysics” was an older term, first appearing in 1873.) Cosmic physics was an interdisciplinary attempt to bring these and other phenomena into the domain of physics. It was a popular branch of physics around the turn of the century when Svante Arrhenius, the Swedish physical chemist, wrote his influential Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik (1903). Ten years later, however, cosmic physics had been relegated to the periphery of physics. The general composition of physics subjects given by the Beibl¨atter is confirmed by the American Science Abstracts, which listed 1,810 publications in physics for 1910. The differences are rooted mostly in different ways of classifying the subjects. For example, whereas the bulk of papers within the Beibl¨atter group called “constitution and structure of matter” dealt Table 2.7 Distribution of Subjects in the 1910 Volume of Beiblatter Subject Electricity and magnetism Optics Constitution and structure of matter Cosmic physics Heat Mechanics Radioactivity Measure and weight General Acoustics Historical and biographical\n\nNumber 913 488 351 321 293 264 182 60 59 27 26\n\nPercentage 31 16 12 11 10 9 6 2 2 1 1\n\n26\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nwith physical chemistry, Science Abstracts defined the area more narrowly and added a separate list on “chemical physics” (which was not the same as modern chemical physics, a post-1930 subdiscipline). Each of the main areas was divided into a number of subentries. The composition of the category “constitution and structure of matter” clearly shows that the content was not atomic and molecular physics, but rather what we would call theoretical chemistry. The subentries were given as follows: general; mass, density; atomic weight; molecular weight; [chemical] elements; compounds; reactions; affinity, equilibria; solutions; absorption, adsorption; colloids; solid solutions, alloys; crystals; and crystalline fluids. In none of the abstract journals did papers on atomic physics count much, and one would look in vain for entries on topics such as “atomic structure,” “quantum theory,” “relativity,” or associated names. Articles dealing with these topics did appear, of course, but they were hidden in other entries and were few in number. For example, papers on relativity were included mostly under the label “general” and those dealing with quanta appeared in the sections “heat” and “optics.” An examination of the titles in the two abstract journals leads to the estimate that in 1910, fewer than forty papers dealt with the theory of relativity and fewer than twenty with quantum theory. The “new physics” was still a marginal activity, but would not be so for long. The impression of the dominance of classical, experimental physics is further confirmed by a count of the papers in the Italian Nuovo Cimento. In 1900 1904 classical physics (defined as mechanics, optics, acoustics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism) and applied physics made up 33 percent and 22 percent of the publications, respectively; ten years later, the percentages were 32 and 17. Most of the publications were experimental, namely, 86 percent in 1900 1904 and 77 percent in 1910 14. Papers on relativity and quantum theory were very few, less than ten in the five-year period 1910 14.\n\nChapter 3 DISCHARGES IN GASES AND WHAT FOLLOWED\n\nO\n\nNE OF THE charms of physics is that it deals with nature, and nature is secretive. There are natural phenomena, or phenomena producible in the laboratory (which are nonetheless natural), that physicists at any given time do not know about. The discovery of new phenomena sometimes has important consequences for our worldview. The physicists of the 1890s, who believed that the foundation of physics was fixed once and for all, implicitly assumed that all the important phenomena of nature were already known. They were in for a surprise, as was dramatically shown by the series of discoveries between 1895 and 1900. From chapter 1, one may get the impression that most physicists in the 1890s were occupied with deep theoretical questions about the foundation of physics. However, this was far from the case. The large majority were experimentalists investigating, for example, methods of electrical measurements, thermal phenomena, spectroscopy, and electric discharges in gases. Although the first experiments with discharges in evacuated glass tubes were made as early as the late eighteenth century, it was only in the 1850s that the area attracted serious interest, primarily as a result of the pioneering work of the Swiss Auguste de la Rive and the German Julius Pl¨ucker. Johann Wilhelm Hittorf, a student of Pl¨ucker’s, investigated systematically the light appearing in the tubes and identified it with rays emitted from the cathode and moving rectilinearly through field-free space; that is, with cathode rays, a name first introduced by the Berlin physicist Eugen Goldstein in 1876. The subject had by then become an important part of physics; it received additional attention through the experiments performed by William Crookes in England. In 1879 Crookes hypothesized that cathode rays were corpuscular a stream of electrified molecules, or what he called a “fourth state of matter.” Young Heinrich Hertz was one of many who felt the new field presented an attractive challenge, primarily because it seemed to offer a quick way to recognition, but also because the discharge phenomena were enigmatic and simply fascinating to look at. “In the middle of it all,” he wrote about his early experiments in 1882, “stands the luminous belljar in which the gases perform the maddest antics under the influence of discharges and produce the strangest, most varied, and most colourful phenomena. My place now really looks very much like a witch’s kitchen” (Buchwald 1994, 132). The key apparatus in the witches’ kitchens of Hertz and other cathode ray researchers were a series of specially designed vacuum tubes provided with electrodes, a Ruhm-\n\n28\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nkorff induction coil to generate the necessary high voltage, and, not least, the all-important vacuum pumps. As seen in retrospect, the question of the nature of the cathode rays was the most important one in this area of research. However, it was not initially considered an issue of crucial importance. Many physicists were occupied with other aspects of discharge phenomena, such as the patches or tubes of colored light and their behavior under the action of magnetic fields. In the late 1890s, some physicists believed they had identified a new kind of cathode rays, sometimes referred to as “magnetic rays,” but the discovery claim was not generally accepted. Hertz’s failure in detecting a deflection of cathode rays when the rays crossed the electric field of a plate capacitor made him conclude that the rays were electrically neutral and not a primary effect of the discharge. According to this view, an electric current flowed inside the tube, but the observed cathode rays were different from the current that generated the rays as some kind of flow or wave in the ether. Hertz’s conclusion was contrary to the corpuscular hypothesis of Crookes and other British researchers, but was supported by most German physicists. It received strong experimental support by experiments made in 1894 by Hertz’s student Philipp Lenard, who placed a thin metal foil as a window in the tube and showed that the cathode rays were able to pass through the foil. If the rays were beams of atomic or molecular particles, this permeability could not be explained. The whole area was confusing, with experimental evidence disagreeing with either of the rival views and none that could clearly distinguish between them. For example, in the same year as Lenard provided the ether-pulse hypothesis with experimental support, J. J. Thomson in England argued that the velocity of the cathode rays was only about one-thousandth of that of light; if the rays were electromagnetic processes in the ether, the velocity would be expected to be very close to the velocity of light. Lenard’s experiments, and the undecided situation in cathode-ray research in general, caused many German physicists to take up the subject. One of them was Wilhelm Conrad R¨ontgen, a relatively undistinguished professor of physics at the University of W¨urzburg.\n\nA New Kind of Rays Inspired by Lenard’s findings, R¨ontgen started investigating the penetrability of cathode rays in the fall of 1895. Like other physicists experimenting with the rays, he used a screen with barium platino-cyanide to detect fluorescence caused by the cathode rays. The screen, which was supposed to play no role in the particular experiment, lay some distance away from the tube, which was covered with black cardboard and operated in a dark room. On November 8, 1895, R¨ontgen noticed to his surprise that the screen fluoresced, a\n\nDISCHARGES IN GASES\n\n29\n\nphenomenon that could not possibly have been caused by the cathode rays. Having confirmed that the phenomenon was real, he started a systematic investigation of what he soon began thinking of as a new kind of rays, different from both light and cathode rays. In R¨ontgen’s own words, from his original communication of January 1896, his observation was this: “If we pass the discharge from a large Ruhmkorff coil through a Hittorf [tube] or a sufficiently exhausted Lenard, Crookes, or similar apparatus and cover the tube with a somewhat closely-fitting mantle of thin black cardboard, we observe in a completely darkened room that a paper screen covered with barium-platino-cyanide lights up brilliantly and fluoresces equally well whether the treated side or the other be turned towards the discharge tube” (Segr´e 1980, 22). November 8 is the official birthday of x-rays, but of course it is much too simplistic to claim that R¨ontgen just happened to discover the rays on the evening of this date. He became aware of a surprising phenomenon, and transforming the original observation into a discovery required hard work and much thinking. It was only at the end of the year that R¨ontgen was certain that he had indeed discovered a new kind of rays and then announced his discovery. To call it the discovery of the year, or even the decade, would not be an exaggeration. Contrary to the practice of a later generation of physicists, R¨ontgen did not call a press conference. In fact, he worked alone and kept his discovery a secret until it appeared in print. R¨ontgen’s new rays caused an enormous stir, especially among physicists and medical doctors, but also in the public at large. Question number one in the physics community concerned the nature of the new rays, which seemed even harder to classify and understand than the cathode rays. In his preliminary investigations, R¨ontgen had found that the rays shared some of the properties of light in that they followed straight lines, affected photographic plates, and were uninfluenced by magnetic fields; on the other hand, they showed neither reflection nor refraction and thus seemed to be different from both light and the Hertzian electromagnetic waves. He suggested tentatively that the rays might be longitudinal vibrations of the ether, an idea that for a time received support from several physicists. However, neither this nor other ideas, including the suggestion that x-rays were an extreme kind of ultraviolet radiation, won general recognition. For more than a decade, physicists worked happily with x-rays without knowing what they were working with. This lack of understanding did not prevent a growing body of empirical knowledge about the new rays to be established, nor did it prevent the rays to be used as tools in experimental physics. For example, it was quickly realized that x-ray tubes were ideal for ionizing gases and in this capacity, the new tubes were used widely in experiments. The discussion of the nature of x-rays continued until evidence accumulated to the effect that they were a species of electromagnetic (transverse) waves, possibly with an extremely short wavelength. This belief was\n\n30\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nstrengthened when the British physicist Charles Barkla concluded from scattering experiments in 1905 that x-rays showed polarization. Yet the matter was far from settled, and other experiments seemed to speak against the wave hypothesis and in favor of a kind of corpuscular radiation, as argued by William Bragg in 1907. With the advantage of hindsight, we can say that the confusing experimental situation reflected the wave-particle duality only clarified with the advent of quantum mechanics. X-rays are both particles and waves, so it was no wonder that physicists in the early part of the century obtained ambiguous results. About 1910, it looked as if x-rays might be simply electromagnetic waves of very short wavelength. If so, diffraction of the rays would require a grid with a correspondingly short spacing, and in 1912 Max von Laue realized that such spacings were found in the interatomic distances between the ions of a crystal. The experiment was made by the Munich physicist Walter Friedrich and his student Paul Knipping in the spring of 1912. The collaboration between the theorist Laue and the experimentalists Friedrich and Knipping resulted in the first x-ray diffraction pattern ever. This provided, at the same time, decisive proof that x-rays are electromagnetic waves, with a wavelength of the order of magnitude 1013 m. Out of the experiments in Munich grew a whole new branch of x-ray research, the use of x-ray diffraction in crystallography. Pioneered by William H. Bragg and his son William L. Bragg, among others, the branch soon became of great importance in chemistry, geology, metallurgy, and even biology. For example, x-ray crystallography was a key element in the celebrated 1953 determination of the double-helix structure of the DNA molecule. Back in the late 1890s, R¨ontgen’s sensational discovery caused a minor revolution in physics and inspired a great many physicists to start investigating the new phenomenon. Rarely has a discovery been received so enthusiastically by scientists and nonscientists alike. According to a bibliography, in 1896 alone there appeared 1,044 publications on x-rays, including 49 books. Among the many physicists who joined the x-ray trend was Henri Becquerel, professor of physics at the Museum of Natural History in Paris.\n\nFrom Becquerel Rays to Radioactivity In January 1896, R¨ontgen’s discovery was discussed in the French Academy of Sciences, where Poincar´e suggested that the cause of the rays might not be electrical, but rather related to the fluorescing part of the glass tube. If so, there was reason to assume that all strongly fluorescing bodies emitted x-rays in addition to their luminating rays. Poincar´e’s remarks were taken up by Becquerel, an expert in fluorescence, and on February 24, he reported to the academy that a fluorescent double salt of uranium, uranium potassium\n\nDISCHARGES IN GASES\n\n31\n\nsulfate, emitted what he believed were x-rays. He had placed the salt on a photographic plate wrapped in black paper, exposed it to sunlight for several hours, and then observed a distinct blackening of the plate when it was developed. Had radioactivity now been discovered? Not quite, for Becquerel believed the penetrating rays were a result of fluorescence and that the exposure to the sun was therefore crucial. A week later, when he repeated the experiment, but the sun failed to shine, he realized that the uranium salt emitted the rays even in the absence of sunlight. He now understood that he had made a discovery, namely that the uranium salt emitted penetrating rays without electric action and without the action of sunlight. The new phenomenon was apparently distinct from both x-rays and fluorescence. In addition, he quickly discovered that the rays were also emitted from other uranium salts and even more strongly from the non-fluorescing metallic uranium. Hence the rays were originally often referred to as “uranium rays.” Becquerel’s discovery of radioactivity was fortunate, but not accidental. Contrary to R¨ontgen, the French physicist was guided by a hypothesis he wanted to test, namely that intensely fluorescent bodies emit x-rays. But most fluorescent materials are not radioactive, so why did he concentrate on uranium salts? His choice has traditionally been ascribed to luck, but it was hardly luck at all. Earlier, together with his father Edmond Becquerel (who was also a professor at the Museum of Natural History in Paris), he had studied the fluorescence spectra of uranium compounds and noticed that the spectral bands obeyed a remarkable regularity. It is likely that this regularity, peculiar to fluorescent uranium salts, inspired Becquerel to the idea that the visible light from the sun was transfomed into the much shorter wavelengths supposedly characteristic of x-rays. Such transformation is forbidden according to Stokes’ law, discovered by Gabriel Stokes in 1852. According to this law, fluorescent bodies can emit radiation only of a wavelength larger than that of the exciting radiation. Stokes’ law is correct it follows from the quantum theory of radiation but in the last part of the nineteenth century there were many reports of “anomalous fluorescence,” that is, exceptions to Stokes’ law. The law was not considered absolute and, according to a theory suggested by the German physicist Eugen Lommel, anomalous fluorescence should take place in substances that exhibited the kind of regular spectra that Becquerel had observed in uranium salts. If this was indeed Becquerel’s line of reasoning, it is not so strange that he chose uranium compounds for his research. His original observation of penetrating rays emanating from uranium salts exposed to sunlight may only have confirmed what he more or less anticipated. The subsequent events did not. The uranium rays did not cause nearly the same sensation as x-rays and for a year or two, Becquerel was one of a handful of scientists who actively studied the new phenomenon. After all, the effects of the uranium rays were weak and many physicists considered them as just a special kind of x-rays,\n\n32\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nalthough with an origin that defied explanation. From the perspective of Becquerel, who believed that the uranium rays were related to the peculiar spectra of uranium compounds, there was no reason to assume that the rays were also emitted by other compounds. It was only when Marie and Pierre Curie discovered substances much more active than uranium that radioactivity made headlines and became a phenomenon of great importance to the physicists. The radioactivity of thorium was announced in the spring of 1898, independently by Marie Curie and the German Gerhard Schmidt. Later the same year, Marie and Pierre Curie discovered in uranium ores two hitherto unknown elements that they proposed to name polonium and radium. The extraordinarily active radium made radioactivity known to the public at large and initiated a new and exciting phase in the study of Becquerel’s rays. Incidentally, the terms “radioactivity” and “radioactive substances” were first introduced by Marie Curie in the same year, 1898. During the next few years, an increasing number of physicists in Europe and North America took up the study of radioactivity, which soon became one of the fastest growing areas of physics. “I have to keep going, as there are always people on my track,” Rutherford wrote to his mother in 1902. “I have to publish my present work as rapidly as possible in order to keep in the race. The best sprinters in this road of investigation are Becquerel and the Curies in Paris, who have done a great deal of very important work on the subject of radioactive bodies during the last few years” (Pais 1986, 62). The early work in radioactivity was primarily experimental and explorative. Which substances were radioactive? How did they fit into the periodic system of the chemical elements? What were the rays given off by the radioactive bodies? Was the activity affected by physical or chemical changes? These were some of the questions that physicists addressed around the turn of the century and not only physicists, for radioactivity was as much a concern of the chemists. Whether physicists or chemists, their approach was phenomenological and explorative; that is, focusing on the collection and classification of data. It was a period of great confusion and many blind alleys. For example, during the first eight years or so of the century, it was generally believed that all elements were radioactive. After all, it was difficult to believe that the property was confined to a few heavy elements, and the crude methods of detection seemed to indicate that weak radioactivity was indeed found everywhere. Among the many topics within the study of radioactivity, the nature of the rays was one of the most important. By 1901, it had been established that the rays were complex, consisting of three species of different penetrability. Beta rays, easily deflected in a magnetic field, were quickly identified as swift electrons, whereas the neutral gamma rays were eventually (about 1912) found to be electromagnetic waves similar to x-rays. The nature of alpha\n\nDISCHARGES IN GASES\n\n33\n\nrays was something of a mystery. Early experiments indicated that they went undeflected through electric and magnetic fields and thus were neutral, a view that Rutherford, among others, held for a brief period. However, further experiments, mainly made by Rutherford at Montreal’s McGill University, showed that the particles were positively charged and with a mass comparable to that of the hydrogen atom. About 1905, evidence accumulated that alpha particles were doubly charged helium atoms, He2. The hypothesis was brilliantly confirmed in an experiment of 1908 that Rutherford, now in Manchester, made together with his assistant Thomas Royds. Rutherford and Royds proved spectroscopically that helium was produced from the alpha particles emanating from radon. Together with data from the magnetic deflection of alpha rays, this identification settled the matter. Even more important than the nature of the rays was the insight that radioactivity is not a permanent phenomenon, but decreases over time. A radioactive substance transforms into another substance in the sense that the atoms change transmute from one element to another. This was the basic content of the law of transformation suggested by Rutherford and the chemist Frederic Soddy in 1902. According to this law, not only do atoms transmute, but they also do so randomly, which is expressed by the transformation having a certain decay constant (λ) depending only on the nature of the radioactive element.
