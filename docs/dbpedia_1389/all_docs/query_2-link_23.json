        "text": "Update: August Bank Holiday\n\nAll orders placed after 2:30pm on Friday 23rd August will be prepared for shipment but will not enter the Royal Mail network until Tuesday 27th August. Therefore the earliest next likely delivery date of any goods will be Wednesday 28th August (with express shipping).\n\nPlease note: if we experience a high volume of orders we may not be able to dispatch your order on Tuesday 27th, therefore there may be a slight delay. Please rest assured we will dispatch your order as quickly as possible.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAt Loaded Dice we take pride in our shipping. You have made a purchase with us and we greatly appreciate it, we will do everything in our power to get your package to you as fast as possible and in the best condition.\n\nThere are unfortunately things beyond our control when it comes to shipping and this page aims to address some of the common issues we face, what to do if something goes wrong, and our promise to you.\n\nTo navigate this page easier we have created a table of contents so you can easily jump to the section you are interested in.\n\nFree Shipping Exclusions\n\nOrder Amendments / Cancellations\n\nShipping Rates\n\nWhy Hasn't my Order Shipped yet?\n\nOrder Not Arrived\n\nTracking Says Delivered but it's not\n\nDelivery Failure\n\nIncorrect Item Received or Item Missing\n\nRight to Cancel\n\nStock Outs\n\nDelivery Timeframes\n\nReturns Policy\n\nReturn Address\n\nChanged Your Mind\n\nDamaged or Faulty Item\n\n1. Free Shipping Exclusions\n\nPlease note, there are some free shipping exclusions such as spray paints or large and heavy items and the free shipping information bar at the top of the page may not reflect this. All products that are excluded from the free shipping will be indicated on their respective product pages or on the checkout page.\n\n2. Order Amendments / Cancellations\n\nWe have worked hard to provide an efficient dispatch and shipping service, we all like to receive our goodies as fast as possible and we are set up to provide an incredible service.\n\nIf you place an order with us by 2:30pm (weekdays) it will be picked, packed and shipped the same day. Because of this, any cancellations and amendments must be made as fast as possible. Please use the following methods if you need to change something:\n\nemail - customerservice@loadeddice.uk\n\ntelephone - 01446 788 676\n\nPlease be aware - you MUST receive confirmation of some kind (verbal or written) that we have received your request and your order has been amended. If you do not receive a response your order may be dispatched unamended and you will be responsible for any returns of unwanted items. This is particularly important during busy times.\n\nOrders that have been fulfilled and where a dispatch notification has been sent CANNOT be amended or cancelled under any circumstances. Please see below for your rights regarding your right to cancel.\n\nAll products are shipped via Royal Mail 48 Tracked as standard. Express service refers to Tracked 24 which usually means next working day, however this is not a guarantee. We apply a discretionary signed for service at no extra charge should the value of goods exceed a desired threshold set by us.\n\n3. Shipping Rates (Excluding RM Prohibited Items)\n\nWhere possible we always keep postage and packaging rates as low as possible. We only pass on costs that are applied to us.\n\nOur shipping rates are as follows:\n\nBasket Total\n\nShipping Cost\n\nService\n\n£0 - £79.99\n\n£4.99\n\nRoyal Mail 48\n\n£0 - £79.99\n\n£5.99\n\nRoyal Mail 24\n\n£80+\n\nFREE\n\nRoyal Mail 48\n\n£80 - £149.99\n\n£1.00\n\nRoyal Mail 24\n\n£150+\n\nFREE\n\nRoyal Mail 24\n\nPlease note that we try our best to offer the most competitive shipping rates. Shipping fees incurred by the customer are only covering the cost of the shipping as charged by our third-party delivery company, packaging materials and labour costs.\n\nFor Royal Mail prohibited items we will ship via a courier service and these prices are subject to change but will be displayed at checkout.\n\n4. Why hasn't my order shipped yet?\n\nIf it is after 2:30pm on a Friday, a weekend or bank holiday you must wait until the next working day before your item is shipped. Where possible we will aim to ship faster but we reserve the right to adhere to the policy.\n\nDuring peak times we will pick and pack on Saturdays in order to meet our fulfilment commitment to you. In light of this you may receive a shipment notification on a Saturday but the parcel will not leave us until the Monday. Please be aware of this as it does not mean you will receive your parcel a day earlier.\n\nIf you think your order has not been dispatched we ask that you wait 24 to 48hrs as there may be system delays that are out of our control.\n\nIf for whatever reason we cannot send your item in time we will contact you to discuss so please check your email (and spam folders).\n\n5. Order Not Arrived\n\nAt Loaded Dice, we always endeavour to get your products to you quickly and safely, from time to time some deliveries may be delayed beyond our control and we would ask customers to be patient at this time if their package is delayed. Full details of your rights are below.\n\nWe strictly adhere to the following process:\n\nPlease allow up to 7 days from when you receive your shipping notification to contact us as we cannot investigate prior to this. Once this amount of time has passed please email customerservice@loadeddice.uk. We do not investigate and may not respond to emails asking us to do so if 7 days have not passed\n\nIf 7 days has passed we can then investigate with Royal Mail as to where your shipment may be, this may take up to 5 days to complete and is completely out of our control.\n\nIf your item cannot be located then we must file a claim with Royal Mail and we may need further information from you.\n\nIf we ascertain that Royal Mail have likely lost your parcel then we will refund you.\n\nIf a resolution cannot be reached and your item is still missing we reserve the right to wait for up to 90 days after purchase before issuing a replacement or refund.\n\n6. Tracking says 'Delivered' but it's not\n\nThis does happen and more often than not it is either left with a neighbour or in a safe place. If you receive a delivery notification but have not received your package please do the following:\n\nCheck your tracking for any further information that may clarify where your package is, there may be a picture or map information that will help you locate it.\n\nCheck any outbuildings such as sheds, storage, porches, garages etc.\n\nCheck with neighbours\n\nIf you have done this and your package still can't be located please report to us at customerservice@loadeddice.uk and we will investigate further. If we ascertain that Royal Mail have likely lost your parcel then we will refund you, but we reserve the right to fully investigate for up to 90 days prior to doing so.\n\n7. Delivery Failure\n\nIf you fail to take delivery of the ordered goods and they are returned to us, we may contact you upon their arrival via email and/or refund of the cost of goods (minus shipping fees) will be processed within 7 days unless you have notified us before then to advise that the goods are still required. If the goods are still required, you will be charged an additional shipping fee for a second delivery which will be agreed with you prior to dispatch.\n\nSigned for Service - we reserve the right to apply a 'signed for' requirement on any parcel depending on the type of address. This usually applies to flats, office buildings or locations where we deem it is worth providing extra proof of delivery. We are not responsible for any failed deliveries where someone has not been able to sign for the parcel.\n\nIncorrect delivery address - the customer is entirely responsible for providing the correct delivery address as we ship exactly as it is written. We cannot physically check every address before sending out so please take care to fill it out correctly. If your order is shipped to an incorrect address and is 'delivered' then the customer is then responsible for retrieving the parcel from that address.\n\nAny packages returned to us due to an incorrect delivery address will be refunded (minus the postage cost). If a redelivery is required then payment will be required for the redelivery. We are also not responsible for any delays caused by having an incorrect delivery address.\n\n8. Incorrect Item Received or Item Missing\n\nIf you have received the wrong item or something is missing please let us know as soon as you open your parcel by contacting us at customerservice@loadeddice.uk and include photo evidence where possible. We will investigate and if we have made a mistake we will rectify it in a timely manner by sending a replacement or refunding.\n\nPlease note: It is your responsibility to check your delivery and inform us of any errors in a timely manner, we are not responsible for any special occasions that are time sensitive.\n\nIf something has been sent in error, depending on the cost and size of the item(s) involved we may arrange a courier collection and we will not be able to refund or replace until the incorrect item has been collected.\n\nPlease be aware, any fraudulent claims that can be proven could result in criminal prosecution. We have active measures such as CCTV that monitor all shipments being packed and we refer to this for evidence where necessary.\n\n9. Right to Cancel\n\nAs a consumer you have the right to cancel your order 14 days after your purchase. We advise that you contact us as quickly as possible to avoid disappointment.\n\nThe outcome of your cancellation depends on the timeframe that this is done within:\n\n1) Cancellation prior to dispatch - Full refund (including shipping cost) will be processed as soon as we confirm it has not been shipped from our warehouse (normally if you have not received a dispatch notification).\n\n2) Cancellation after dispatch but prior to delivery - Customer must refuse goods and refund will be given once it is received by Loaded Dice. Any shipping fees will not be refunded.\n\n3) Cancellation after goods received (within 14 days or sooner) - Customer is liable for the return shipping cost, refund will be given once the item is received by Loaded Dice and any shipping fees will not be refunded.\n\n10. Stock Outs\n\nUsually everything displayed on our site as \"In Stock\" is present in our warehouse and available for immediate dispatch. In the unlikely event that any ordered goods are not readily available to us, we reserve the right to cancel your order. You will receive an email notification of any order cancellation as a result of stock out confirming that any pre-authorisation has been released or payment refunded as relevant in line with our Payment Terms, to the extent that the out-of-stock item forms part of a larger order, all other goods ordered by the customer will be dispatched in the normal way.\n\n11. Delivery Timeframes\n\nIt is our objective to achieve on time delivery on all orders. We monitor our delivery partners and our experience is that delivery is successful within the chosen delivery time period in 99% of cases.\n\nWe can use a number of third-party courier service providers. Once dispatched, the on-time delivery of a package is the responsibility of the relevant courier company and Loaded Dice cannot be held responsible for a package not reaching its destination on time.\n\nIn order to avoid disappointment, we suggest that customers place orders well in advance of when they are required to allow for any unforeseen delays. We accept no responsibility for delays/loss of revenue to customer's projects/deadlines due to shipping delays.\n\n12. Returns Policy (Online Only)\n\nWe accept all returns that adhere to your consumer rights and our policy, no quibble.\n\n13. Return Address\n\nAll returns must be sent to:\n\nLoaded Dice, 28 Holton Rd, Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, CF63 4HD\n\nPlease make sure to include your order number in or on the package so we can match it to you. You can download an unpaid returns label here\n\n14.
