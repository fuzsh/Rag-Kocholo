We tried to go for the stage but more for the sprint. In this situation, Adam attacked and Visma had to try and maintain the gap. I saw that if I bridged to Adam then he could pull me a little bit and this was really perfect. I must say a big thank you to all the team today. They were amazing and this victory is for all my teammates.\n\n\"The plan was to come to the final and make the sprint hard, maybe take some seconds and a stage win. But in the end, like this it's much better.\n\n\"I'm super, super happy to get this. But let's keep on this momentum and good energy in the team. Good legs and we try to maintain this position.\n\n\"To win a Tour stage is something I was never thinking of when I was a kid. For example, seeing Mark Cavendish winning all these stages, I was thinking it's from another planet and it's not reachable. But if you chase your dreams you can catch them.\"\n\nCelebration for Pogačar as he crosses the line to win today.\n\nHis great rival Vingegaard comes home in second.\n\nThird place for Evenepoel today.\n\nTour de France: Tadej Pogačar solos to stage 14 victory on Pla d’Adet, consolidates his lead\n\nJonas Vingegaard second, Remco Evenepoel third up summit finish to Pla d'Adet"
