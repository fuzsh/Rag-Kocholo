        "text": "TERM: Four years\n\nCANDIDATES: Brenda Bradley, 59, Sebastian; Carole Jean Jordan, 80, Vero Beach\n\nKEY ISSUES: Experience, customer service, employee morale and administration.\n\nMore: Indian River County Primary Election 2024: Candidates reply to questionnaires\n\nTalk about a grudge match.\n\nThis race pits Bradley, Jordan's former chief of staff, against her ex-boss. It's Bradley's second opportunity to make the case Jordan hasn't been doing a good job.\n\nBradley joined the tax collector's office in 2002 under Charles Sembler, who didn't run in 2008. That year, the Indian River County Republican Executive Committee tapped Jordan to replace former state Rep. Stan Mayfield, who defeated her in the GOP primary, but died before taking office.\n\nBradley became chief of staff in 2011. By December 2016, Bradley was gone, signing a separation agreement that gave her six weeks of pay and other benefits. It included a non-disparagement clause, keeping both sides from speaking negatively or pressing claims against each other.\n\nIn 2020, Bradley convinced only 32.15% of voters she’d do a better job than Jordan. This year, she has been far more aggressive, unloading on Jordan in recorded town hall meetings (the incumbent hasn’t attended), then posts on Facebook. Bradley also posts on Facebook documents outlining her assertions that Jordan recklessly spends taxpayer money, treats employees poorly, isn’t open and has ethics issues.\n\nBradley cites her successful business and nonprofit career ― she is past president of the oldest Rotary Club in Vero Beach ― and says she will be far more fiscally prudent, nicer and fairer to office employees, and more professional than Jordan.\n\nBradley seems no-nonsense and, based on her record at Rotary, able to run an operation efficiently. But in races like this for administrative positions highly regulated by state rules, it’s the challenger’s job to convince voters they’ll do a measurably better job.\n\nBradley seems to have her heart in the right place. The question is whether she’s focused on the right roles and goals for the tax collector.\n\nJordan said she’s focused on customer service, financial accountability and staff development. When asked by our editorial board, Bradley omitted what probably is the most important issue to voters: What kind of service do we get when we need to pay taxes, register our vehicles or need other help?\n\nBradley graded clerks in the office an A-plus for customer service. But, she said they aren’t paid fairly compared to employees Jordan prefers, some of whom do not earn their high salaries. That, in part, creates a morale problem.\n\n“It is hard to say A-plus (customer service) and low morale; it doesn’t make any sense,” Bradley told us, citing turnover. “But I assure you … it is a very bad environment to be working in.”\n\nIt makes no sense people allegedly treated so badly leave quickly, but the office still offers great customer service — and does it with five fewer people and a smaller budget than the comparable office in Martin County, which has a slightly smaller population.\n\nNo workplace is free of morale issues; it’s a constant challenge for employers to meet budgets, keep employees trained and hire middle managers who treat the rank and file fairly so they are excited about coming to work.\n\nCan Jordan spend money more efficiently? Put 10 people in a room and they’ll dice her budget up 10 ways.\n\nIs Jordan, who chaired the Florida Republican Party 2003-2007 and still has connections in Tallahassee, perfect? Probably not. Are there things worth looking into at her office? Yes, just like every other operation. Bradley has done that and should continue to be a watchdog.\n\nIn our editorial board interview, she acted like she had a vendetta, a personal beef with Jordan. At one point, she made us wonder whether she wanted to be tax collector.\n\n“I don’t care if I win or lose. I have a great job. I am just strong enough to bring this stuff out to the public,\" Bradley said, challenging Jordan to end nepotism and other alleged unfair practices in the office. \"I’ll gladly back out if you show everything I’ve asked for and you come clean with what you’ve been doing.”\n\nJordan's team has provided outstanding customer service, including the convenience of making appointments, despite an ever-growing number of services offered and offices opened. In the absence of bad state audits or overly hefty budgets, it looks like Jordan is doing a solid job.\n\nShe deserves a fifth term.\n\nTCPalm’s candidate recommendations are decided collectively by its Editorial Board. Recommendations are based on nonpartisan criteria that prioritize the best candidates for our local community."
