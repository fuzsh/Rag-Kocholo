        "text": "Single-cylinder Ducati Hypermotard spotted testing Multiple spy shots have emerged of a test mule on Italian roads that appear very similar to a single-cylinder Ducati Hypermotard. This is likely to be one of Ducati’s more affordable models once it debuts, which could happen in 2024. Engine likely to displace 659cc Upside-down fork, linked monoshock Could be unveiled in 2024 Up until recently, Ducati’s line-up consisted entirely of L-twin motorcycles. But with the arrival of the V4 motor in the Panigale, Streetfighter and Multistrada models, buyers have shown that they are willing to accept other engine configurations in a Ducati. The Italian brand now seems to be on path to divert in the other direction, working on a new single-cylinder engine. Single-cylinder Ducati Hypermotard engine It has been spotted for the very first time in a Hypermotard test mule on Italian roads, but the signs for this engine have been around for a while. Last year, Ducati filed documents with the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for an upcoming liquid-cooled single-cylinder engine displacing 659cc and featuring 4-valve architecture. It’s very likely that this is the motor at the heart of this Hypermotard test mule. That would place this new single-cylinder Hypermotard squarely against the likes of the KTM SMC 690 SMC R. The KTM produces 75hp, and you can expect similar numbers from the Ducati as well. And while this is the only bike we know of so far to feature this engine, it’s possible that Ducati will remain true to form and use this motor as a basis for different models in the future. Single-cylinder Ducati Hypermotard underpinnings As for the test mule itself, we see styling that’s very reminiscent of the larger Hypermotard 950, with a sharp front beak, dirtbike-like bodywork and even a pair of large underseat exhaust cans. Holding everything together is a tubular steel frame, suspended on an upside-down fork and linked monoshock setup, with a double-sided swingarm at the rear. Like the Ducati Scrambler models, this bike features a single brake disc at both ends, hinting that it will sit at the lower end of the Ducati line-up. That said, it’s highly unlikely that this will be a ‘budget’ motorcycle. Ducati has long maintained that it will not make budget bikes, and the exclusion of one cylinder should not imply that this will be a cheap as chips machine. We see a neat golden finish on the fork tubes and the engine covers, as well as a hydraulic clutch. There also appears to be a quickshifter present, so overall, equipment levels should be typically Ducati, which is quite high. Single-cylinder Ducati Hypermotard: unveil, India launch As for an official unveil, the test mule seems to be fairly close to finished, but it is more likely that a debut will happen sometime in 2024. As for an India launch, this bike will probably have a very tall seat and cost Rs 8 lakh-10 lakh – if not more – if Ducati were to bring ...\n\nDucati Monster SP review: SPecial Enough? https://ift.tt/4j0Vepx SP. Two perfectly innocuous alphabets – until you slap them at the end of a motorcycle’s name badge. Suddenly you have two alphabets that signify a heap of extra capability and desirability. Ducati Monster SP what's new here? As is usually the case, the SP at the end of the Monster moniker means that we have a bike with significantly higher levels of kit. More precisely, it includes fully adjustable Öhlins suspension at both ends, exceptional Brembo Stylema brakes, a Termignoni slip-on exhaust, a steering damper and a lithium-ion battery. The bike also gets the flyscreen and rear seat cowl from the Monster + and it comes in an exclusive paint scheme. Ducati Monster SP engine, performance The rest is the same as you’ll get on the regular Monster, which is a tremendously fun little thing – more on those last two words towards the end of this review. The engine, chassis and electronic assists all continue as is, which means you get a big 937cc L-twin that produces 111hp and 98Nm. The power figure is lower than most rivals, but the 93Nm torque figure is higher than most. 937cc 'L-Twin' makes lesser power but more torque than most key rivals. This is a properly fast motorcycle and it loves raising its front wheel in the first two gears as it charges past the 200kph mark quicker than you’d expect. More significantly, the hard charging mid-range makes it a more instantly exciting machine than something like the Street Triple RS, which saves its real pull for higher in the rev range. Give it space to roar and this motor will give you plenty to grin about. Ducati Monster SP city manners That being said, this engine doesn’t sound or feel special until it crosses 5,000rpm. At city speeds, the sound is rather bland and uninspiring, even with that pretty Termignoni slip-on. That makes sense when you examine the carbon-clad exhaust from the rear and see how narrow the actual outlets are. I’d say this pipe sounds maybe ten percent better than stock, at best. Think of it as a road-legal piece of jewellery. Termis look gorgeous but sound close to stock. A heavy clutch, plenty of heat and juddery low-end performance also tarnish the Monster’s fun factor at slow city speeds. But these are things we have been complaining about for years, which makes sense given that this is now an eight-year-old engine (11 years if you count the 821 motor that this engine is based on). An all-new motor is long overdue, and hopefully we’ll see something that’s nicer to use at lower speeds and comes with the lower running costs that came with the new V4 Granturismo engine. Ducati Monster SP comfort, ride & handling At 186kg, the SP weighs two kilos less than the regular Monster thanks to its lightweight battery, and it feels very agile and compact. The Öhlins suspension is supple enough for the road, although I suspect that the base model’s non-adjustable suspension is a little bit softer. Never...\n\nDucati DesertX Rally revealed Ducati has supplemented its DesertX line up with the new Rally model. As the name suggests, this bike is all about increased off road capabilities and there are a few visual indicators that give this away. More advanced suspension than standard DesertX Greater ground clearance, new wheels with tubed tyres Bespoke colourway; tall, dirt-bike-esque front fender First, there's a dirt bike style tall fender that replaces the standard mudguard which will prevent mud from getting clogged between the wheel and mudguard. Then there’s the single piece bench seat which comes as standard and along with the new suspension, this has pushed the seat height even higher than the standard bike’s 875mm. The DesertX Rally now has a towering seat height of 910mm, although an optional low seat can bring that down to a still dizzying 885mm. Finally, there’s a new engine bashguard which is made out of forged carbon fibre - a first on a production motorcycle as far as we can tell. The engine remains the same 937cc L-twin that puts out 110hp and 92Nm and there are no changes to the gearing or sprocket sizes either. However, there are some big differences with the suspension. Still made by Showa, both the front fork and rear shock are different, more advanced units. Travel has increased by 20mm at both ends, now 250mm in the front and 240 at the rear and ground clearance is subsequently up from 250mm to 280mm. The suspension itself is now more sophisticated, with a closed cartridge 48mm fork up front and a new monoshock with a bigger 46mm piston. Both ends are fully adjustable and the compression damping adjustment at the rear is further split into high speed and low speed damping. The DesertX Rally also moves away from the side laced spoked rims with tubeless tyres on the standard bike. The centrally mounted spokes on the new Excel Takasago rims are less susceptible to rock damage, according to Ducati and are lighter as well. Despite the new rims, the Pirelli Scorpion Rally STR tyres are the same sizes as the standard DesertX, 90/90–21 at the front and 150/70–R18 at the rear. Further weight savings come from billet aluminium used for the wheel hubs and foot levers. However, the weight savings are likely to have been offset by the new equipment and fact that the DesertX Rally has tubed tyres. Ducati says kerb weight has gone up by 1kg over the standard DesertX which weighs in at 223kg. Beyond this, the DesertX Rally retains the same style and comprehensive electronics pack, but the bodywork is now coloured plastic, which Ducati says is better at hiding scratches and scuffs. The graphics are also done in a thicker PVC material, which again, is designed to be more durable against the rough life a bike like this is bound to lead. Prices have not yet been announced, but if Ducati were to bring it to India, expect it to retail somewhere around the Rs 20 lakh mark, given that the standard DesertX is already priced at Rs 17.91 ..."
