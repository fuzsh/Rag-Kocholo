        "text": "LAREDO, Tex. (KGNS) - The DEA Overdose Task Force, formed in 2023 due to a rise in overdose deaths, has been cracking down on drug sales in Laredo. The task force, made up of six agencies, has put in over 12,000 hours to combat the issue.\n\nRecent operations shed light on the collaborative efforts of law enforcement to target fentanyl dealers operating within the city. A recent operation witnessed a coordinated effort between Laredo Police and DEA agents, who descended upon four locations across town where alleged drug sales and storage were reported.\n\nOne such raid unfolded in the 6000 block of Cresote Loop off Highway 59. Multiple agencies swiftly moved in, executing a narcotics search warrant and taking one suspect into custody. Though the agencies arrested two individuals, Laredo Police only reported confiscating money from the scene.\n\nThe efforts continued the following week, targeting another suspect allegedly involved in fentanyl sales. Law enforcement raided a residence in the 3000 block of Socrates Lane in south Laredo, with KGNS cameras capturing SWAT officers in action.\n\nDuring the raid, officers discovered a baby still inside the house where drugs were being found. Investigators ensured the child’s safety while conducting their search, leading to the arrest of 31-year-old Raul Garcia.\n\nGarcia, found in possession of 6.1 grams of fentanyl, marijuana, heroin, and cash, faces charges of possession with intent to distribute fentanyl. He has been handed over to federal authorities pending further legal proceedings.\n\nLaredo Police Chief Miguel Rodriguez Jr. condemned drug dealers, saying they show no regard for human life. “Because you are selling and forgetting who you sold it to and not caring about that person and knowing that it had fentanyl and the possibility of the drug causing that death... that you just didn’t care about it that’s not going to be acceptable in this community,” he expressed.\n\nChief Rodriguez further emphasized the community’s determination to combat the fentanyl crisis, stating, “We have perfected the formula to go after these drug dealers providing the drug to our community.”\n\nThe agency has already indicted two people for selling fentanyl in Laredo. The Laredo Police Department reported 28 fatal overdose cases in May 2023. This year for the same month, the agency reported 19 overdoses with 9 fentanyl-related deaths. Chief Rodriguez expressed hope for a future with zero overdose deaths, “So far, we have been doing a lot better than last year, and that is the goal and the number one objective with the fentanyl problem is to one day be at zero.”\n\nChief Rodriguez says a person gets arrested, they get out on bond, a hearing is set and the person goes to court. Most of these individuals plead guilty. He further emphasized the community’s determination to combat the fentanyl crisis, stating, “The community gets tired of this, and the public knows they don’t want this type of community where people are walking around like zombies, and they don’t want it in their community.”\n\nChief Rodriguez says he understands the community’s frustration with the overwhelming number of drug cases in Laredo. “We are a border town, drugs continue to be a problem in our community so we continue addressing it. We continue to invest a lot in those units of Narcotics and Vice, and we will continue to do what we do best which is serve and protect,” he asserted.\n\nAccording to federal court documents, a trial date for Garcia has not been set yet. If found guilty, Garcia could spend up to 20 years in federal prison for selling fentanyl.\n\nFor more headlines. click here."
