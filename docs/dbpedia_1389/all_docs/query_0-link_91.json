        "text": "All of the money measures except for the Bainbridge Island pool were passing, and there were few surprises in the candidate races with all incumbents leading in voting returns in the Primary Election in Kitsap County Aug. 6.\n\nThe biggest surprise was two Republican candidates leading the way for county commissioner.\n\nA $10 million bond to widen Bainbridge’s Ray Williamson Pool at the Aquatic Center two lanes and deepen the entire swimming structure was treading water. Voting yes were 52% (2,435) while 48% (2,247) opposed it. As a bond measure, it requires a 60% majority.\n\nThe tax would have been about 6 cents per $1,000 valuation. Those in favor said it was needed to update an old pool, get it ready for the future and allow it to be used more. Those against said the updates would be paid for even without bond passage.\n\nThe other county measures are levies so only require 50% approval.\n\nAs for local candidates, for Kitsap County commissioner District 2, two Republicans lead the way with Sean Murphy getting 26% (2,915) of the vote on Election Night and Oran Root close behind at 22.4% (2,503) with Democrat Stacey Smith close behind at 22% (2,425).\n\nFor Kitsap Public Utility District, incumbent Heather Pauley gathered 49% (4,983) of the vote, and Richard Tift was at 25.6% (2,583), with John Poppe right behind him.\n\nFor state lawmakers representing the county or parts of it, incumbent Drew Hanson, D, had 68% of the vote (13,618) and Lance Byrd, R, 28% (5,712) for the Senate spot for Legislative District 23. For state representative Position 1 in that district incumbent Tarra Simmons, D, garnered 62% (12,436) of the vote, while Republican Kurt Robertson had 31% 6,224). For Position 2, Greg Nance, D, who was appointed last year, received 46% (9,288) of the vote while Jamie Miles, R, had 3o% (5,990).\n\nFor District 26, state rep. Position 1, Jesse L. Young, R, had 35% (9,010), while Adison Richards, D, had 49% (12,638). For Position 2, incumbent Michelle Caldier, R, came up with 36% of the vote (8,836)on Election Night, while Tiffany Mitchell, D, received 29% (7,565).\n\nIn District 35, state rep. Position 2, incumbent Travis Couture, R, picked up 54% of the vote (11,325), while James DeHart, D, was at 37% (10,930).\n\nIn statewide results, as expected, Attorney General Bob Ferguson and former U.S. Congressman Dave Reichert advanced for governor. Current 26th District Sen. Emily Randall was leading with 35th District Sen. Drew MacEwen and state lands commissioner Hilary Franz close behind in the race for U.S. representative.\n\nIn Poulsbo, an emergency medical services property tax was winning easily 74% to 26% (2,482 to 996). It allows a tax of 50 cents per $1,000 valuation. Those in favor said the levy just continues funding. There was no statement against.\n\nIn North Kitsap, an EMS levy also was winning easily 77% to 23% (2,268 to 670). It will allow 50 cents in tax per every $1,000 in property valuation. Those in favor said passage was vital to continue service, and it’s the same levy voters have passed for 40 years. There was no statement against.\n\nIn Bremerton, an emergency services levy also was passing 64% to 36% (2,393 to 1,343). It allows the city to tax property owners 50 cents per $1,000 valuation. Supporters say it is just the continuation of a tax. Foes say the levy cost actually has dropped to 37 cents per $1,000 due to increased valuation, so the levy would really be a 35% hike. And while the city has said it needs more personnel it does not commit to that in the levy. It also says new residential growth does not have to pay the tax, which is unfair. Those in favor counter that the city will fund new positions, along with a fourth response unit.\n\nIn Central Kitsap a levy to fund fire protection and emergency medical services also was passing 56% to 44% (5,196 to 4,138). It would allow taxation at $1.50 per $1,000 valuation. Those in favor said the levy is the same one approved previously and calls for service there have increased 39%. Renewal would cost the owner of a $500,000 home just $80 more a year. There was no argument against.\n\nVotes will continue to be counted over the next few weeks. About 36,325 votes were tallied, which is a 19% turnout, but about 30,000 more votes remain to be counted as mail-in ballots postmarked Aug. 6 continue to come in over the next several days.\n\nStatewide voter turnout so far is 21% with almost 403,000 ballots left to be counted. Over 1.023 million already have been counted.\n\nStatewide Primary results\n\nTop 2 advance to general election Nov. 5.\n\nFederal\n\nUS senator: Incumbent Maria Cantwell, D, 59% (578,866); Dr. Raul Garcia, R, 21% (212,709)\n\nUS representative District 6: Emily Randall, D, 34% (37,441); Drew MacEwen, R, 30% (33,309)\n\nState\n\nGovernor: Bob Ferguson, D, 47.6% (459,589); Dave Reichert, R, 29% (282,239)\n\nLt. governor: Incumbent Denny Heck, D, 48% (477,898); Dan Matthews, R, 19% (221,250)\n\nSecretary of state: Incumbent Steve Hobbs, D, 49% (485,043); Dale Whitaker, R, 35% (364,635)\n\nTreasurer: Incumbent Mike Pellicciotti, D, 60% (579,755); Sharon Hanek, R, 40% (408,169)\n\nAuditor: Incumbent Pat McCarthy, D, 61% (583,833); Mike Hawkins, R, 39% (402,566)\n\nAttorney General: Pete Serrano, R, 42% (416,617); Nick Brown, D, 36% (356,998);\n\nPublic Lands commissioner: Jaime Herrera Beutler, R, 23% 221,949); Sue Kuchl Pederson, D, 20% (198,610)\n\nState schools chief: Incumbent Chris Reykdal, 34% (364,250); David Olson, 33% (286,195)\n\nInsurance commissioner: Patty Kuderer, D, 45% (433,317); Phil Fortunato, R, 28% (270,839)\n\nSupreme Court justice Position 2: Sal Mungla, 42% (379,864); Dave Larson 37% (336,956)"
