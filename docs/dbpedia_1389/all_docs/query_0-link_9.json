        "meta_description": "US Army\nSGT\nWorld War 2\n\n\tRaul Garcia was born at home in San Diego on December 13, 1925. From age 16 to 18, Raul worked as a postal clerk. On his 18th birthday, he received his draft notice with instructions to report to the processing center at Camp Elliot, which is today the Torrey Pines golf course. Camp Elliot was an induction center, Army boot camp, and artillery weapons training center. \n\n\tDuring Raul’s initial medical processing, it was discovered that he had a punctured left eardrum, placing him in a 4F status or unfit for military service.  Raul was disappointed and petitioned his local processing center to re-examine him.  He was placed on a waitlist for an opening in the schedule.  An appointment for the Los Angeles Processing Center specialist clinic was found in a few weeks, and Raul took the bus up to LA.\n\n\tRaul reported to the Ear Nose and Throat clinic.  He was examined and told again his eardrum would rupture when the gunfire started.  The doctor asked if he wanted to sign a waiver, and he replied, “Yes, Sir.”  Ten days later, on April 16th, 1944, he reported to Camp Roberts for infantry training.  Raul’s eardrum is fine; it never ruptured during his enlistment. \n\n\tAfter initial training, he reported to Fort Ord in Monterey, CA. to the 8th Army 7th Infantry Division as a replacement troop for the Pacific.  He shipped to the Pacific on a liberty ship as a replacement troop.  Raul was still in transit when the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, bringing an end to the war.  Raul landed in Yokohama to serve with occupational forces.\n\n\tWith Raul’s previous postal work, he was assigned to the 704th postal unit, where the Fleet Post Office (FPO) mail was processed on the northern island of Hokkaido in Sapporo.  Raul was assigned to deliver and accompany mail to other basses riding the train around Japan.\n\n\tHe also tested for his military driver’s license, allowing him to be assigned as the company commander.  He drove the CO in his Jeep Willy to meetings at Division HQ and duties around the island and base.  Raul was responsible for the Jeep 24 hours a day.  He also loved having the Jeep for some after-hours rides around Japan.\n\n\tRaul received his discharge notice in November of 1946 and loaded a troop transport liberty ship to return to the US on the Victory ship SS Puerto Rico.  They returned to San Francisco, offloaded at Oakland Army Base and discharged at Camp Beale. \n\n\tRaul returned to the Post office and worked most of his 44 years at the Fleet Post office at the Broadway Pier complex, retiring in 1995. Raul was married and had three children.",

        "text": "Where can I donate?\n\nI have created a way to accept donations to grow the project, use the WWII Veterans Portrait Series Go Fund Me.\n\nWhere are you located?\n\nI live in the San Diego area but have traveled to many locations to interview and photograph Veterans.\n\nHow Long is an Appointment?\n\nAppointments usually last an hour. But please free up time for Mickey to set up lights and cameras, hold the interview, and take some still photographers for in the project.\n\nDo you accept reservations?\n\nYes is the simple answer to the question. Each appointment is set up as an individual session. Group sessions have been set up when I visited a senior living facility or many of the California Veterans Homes."
