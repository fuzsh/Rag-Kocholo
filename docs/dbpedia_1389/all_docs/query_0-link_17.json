        "text": "To add to the mystical sound explored in this EP, Raul’s own songwriting is a main factor. Perhaps the most consistent element in his music, Raul’s lyrics are personal and brief. They are just vague enough to place the listener in a story that you feel you’re a part of, especially for his narrative in the second person. In “Bite,” the first track off the EP, he sings about controlling the urge to say more when it’s time to move on, “Gonna bite my tongue and mind my own life,” this is someone who’s come to terms with the difficulties in two sided communication with ongoing relationships in his life as he says, “you can find your way.” Whereas in “Would You Believe” the speaker reminisces on the past, “Strange as it seems I have no regret/Gonna think about it until I’m dead.” The fourth song, “Oven,” stands out as the most exhilarating tune, spicing it with a trumpet and a passionate vocal lead.\n\nRaul’s first self-titled debut EP was released in 2017 with a grunge approach, recorded right after his college graduation. On the other hand, his second EP, “Grow” (2020) delivers a more mature set of songs that play off the influence of the 90s alternative scene of Rock en Español.\n\nTo talk more about the making of his latest EP we invited Raul to chat with us for our Dead Venues Series and share more about his recording process, and as an avid concert-goer we asked him about some of his wildest experiences.\n\nIván: Can you tell me what that process has been like for you to record your new EP over a year and a half?\n\nRaul: It’s been a really fun involved process. The only way I’ve been able to do it has been with the help of a lot of dear friends. Some of these are songs that I’ve been playing for a long time. One of the songs I played tonight, “Whisper” was written with my friend Josh Abramovitz back in 2016 when I was still at CSUN. There were a bunch of song ideas that I had been bouncing around for a while. I’ve even played different versions of the songs. Then the pandemic happened and I was looking to do some recordings. Because of the pandemic, my friend Tyler McCarthy–who’s amazing at anything music-related–happened to be in town. We got together and recorded these songs. I had written the songs as you heard me play them solo, but they were not as well arranged with other instruments. Tyler’s a very inspirational person to me who just has that ear for musical arrangement and anything to do with making a record. So he helped me develop the songs into the form that you just heard, and I thank him dearly for it. It was a really lovely process that I hope to do many more times.\n\nIván: What was the timeline from recording demos to the finished product?\n\nRaul: I started going to Tyler’s studio between July and August of 2020, and because I was working full-time in Burbank I was still commuting at the time. We would meet up two or three times per month up until February of 2021 when the mixing was done. After that, it was off to the races with everything else (like the artwork). The songs are also pressed onto vinyl so that was a whole interesting process… to figure out how to get the art photographed and edited. My girlfriend Brenda Lopez helped me with the layout for the files that needed to be sent to the pressing plant and my friend Josh Jalil helped me with some Photoshop editing of the photographs that Rafael Cardenas took of the paintings that Stephanie Godoy made for the EP art.\n\nIván: Do you collect vinyls? Was it something you grew up with?\n\nRaul: I collect too many records. Yeah, it’s a gift and a curse. Way too much money spent on records during the pandemic. Shoutout to Record Safari and Amoeba Hollywood! I didn’t [grow up collecting vinyls]. I didn’t even listen to The Beatles till I was in college. I had a friend in high school that gifted me an album on vinyl and that was way before I even had a record player. It wasn’t until I was in college that I’d go to shows and see bands sell their albums on vinyl. I would go to the record store next to The Echo, which was called Origami Vinyl. That store then became Permanent Records, which is now something else... I also had a friend who I was in a band with that had a ton of vinyl and he lent me a ton of records to listen to. Besides that, I would go to my cousin Elly because he had a lot of music like Iron Maiden and Metallica on his iTunes. I had an iPod nano and I would unlock the ability to steal–I mean borrow– the music and listen to it. So I just had an iPod full of music I thought was cool and I think my record collecting stemmed from there later on. The seed had been planted and when I was finally able to buy the records, it was game over.\n\nIván: Was most of your upbringing in the San Fernando Valley? I understand you were born in Mexico City, which is where I’m from, too!\n\nRaul: The very early part of my life was in Mexico City so between 1993–when I was born– through 1999 I was in Mexico City. We would occasionally visit some family here in Tarzana, California because they lived here before me and my family officially moved here, but to be honest the valley’s been home since I’ve been consciously aware of it.\n\nIván: Cool! You had most of your childhood years in D.F. during the 90s. Do you think that having been surrounded by two different environments impacted your music?\n\nRaul: Yeah, definitely. I think for art ideas, my grandma is always bringing cultural things from Mexico. Like, there’s this really nice light blue color and she’s always like “you should use this for your art!” I think it’s Aztec blue (actually, Mayan blue). It’s a kind of light green blue. Yeah and you know also being a valley metal head I was into Metallica, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath… I was the little Led Zeppelin shirt kid.\n\nIván: You started listening to the classic stuff, more on the heavy side of things. Your first EP which actually has that blue color you were talking about, right? It has tigers on it?\n\nRaul: Yeah! That’s my Mexican animal blanket that I photographed with my phone and then photocopied to make a collage\n\nIván: Dude, la cobija!\n\nRaul: Exactly! I had a cobija that my mom was about to throw out and I was like, “No! What do you mean you’re gonna throw it out?!” I was looking for it to make the collage and my mom had already thrown it in the trash. So I took it out, washed it, took the pictures, made the collage and that was the artwork for the first EP I ever made right after college.\n\nIván: I understand you’re also surrounded by music all the time. You work in the music industry, does that influence you in any way in the process of making your own music? Has it become a way for you to collaborate with other musicians?\n\nRaul: I would say work is pretty separate from it. I think I meet more people by just having an anchor date for a performance and finding people to play from there. Like going to shows and just asking a friend if they know someone who’s a drummer or keyboard player, that’s usually how I meet someone. I went to this show at a cafe in Long Beach and I met my buddy Matthew Perez who’s an amazing Jazz guitar player and musician in general. It was just a chance encounter. You end up sitting in front of this person and you say hello, you have a chat and then you hang out a couple of times and become friends. I have a lot of encounters like that that make me believe in the power of saying hello and it sparks a conversation and a friendship.\n\nIván: What are some of your fondest memories, or maybe not so fond, from the music program at CSUN?\n\nRaul: I think it was a defining four years for me. I actually met Josh Solomon and my friend Christian Doboe at this event that their class from the music program was hosting at the Orange Grove Bistro at CSUN after I had graduated. On a side note, I also used to volunteer at Pehrspace and The Smell which is where me and Josh Solomon would see each other around before we officially met. We knew that we’d seen each other somewhere! Turns out me and Josh also had a lot of the same music teachers at Pierce College. Me and Christian ended up working a bunch of Golden Voice festivals together along with Josh Abramovitz and Paul Slater and that was a bit after I graduated… but it’s crazy that this one day that I just decided to go post flyers around CSUN for a show I was playing, I just happen to pop into this event at the Orange Grove Bistro and I meet these two very meaningful people in my life.\n\nIván: That’s awesome. Some of the most supportive people you’ll ever meet in your life show up very unexpectedly. I’m glad to hear you’ve had many of those encounters. Having played live at a number of different venues, what is a crazy experience you’ve had at a show?\n\nRaul: There was this show at a place called Lot 1, rest in peace.\n\nIván: RIP!\n\nRaul: It’s now a Monty’s burger place. Fuck Monty’s.\n\nIván: Fuck Monty’s!\n\nRaul: I played there with an old band and there was this other band playing from Oakland, they were on a tour. We had just played our set and it was cool, but this Oakland band packed this tiny space that Lot 1 had and I remember being there in the crowd watching this band with my friend Stanley Jeong, who was the drummer of the band I was playing in at the time… all of a sudden we see a dude in this Mickey Mouse costume just walking outside. There was this big window where you could see out onto Sunset Boulevard from inside the venue and we just saw a random motherfucker in a legit Disneyland Mickey Mouse costume. One moment we see him outside and didn’t think about it that long, but then me and Stanley are like, “let’s crowd surf”, so we get picked up and are crowd surfing, and all of a sudden we see that Mickey Mouse guy right next to us on top of the crowd in that tiny tiny room. I’ll never forget that show.\n\nIván: Damn, goals. I want to say I’ve crowd surfed with Mickey Mouse. Did you ever find out who was behind the costume?\n\nRaul: No, we never did. But shoutout to the dude in the Mickey Mouse costume. He was probably legit Mickey who came to crowdsurf from another dimension.\n\nIván: What have been some of your favorite live performances?\n\nRaul: If anyone’s ever been to Grand Performances in DTLA, they do these free summer shows and Kamasi Washington did a show there in 2015. I want to say I saw everyone from my musical past and present there. Everyone I met in different eras of my life who were also music fans and/or musicians were there. It was this beautiful experience where Kamasi and his group united a whole city of musicians all in one place. To this day I haven’t seen anything like that. Eduardo Arenas also has a really great live show and Thee Oh Sees have one of the best shows I’ve seen around the city."
