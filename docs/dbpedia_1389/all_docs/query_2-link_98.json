        "text": "In 2015, I traveled to Havana with the support of an ASTR Targeted Areas Research Grant to work on processing the physical materials of the Photographic Archive of Tablas-Alarcos Press (hereinafter the Tablas-Alarcos archive or collection). The Tablas-Alarcos archive is a unique collection because it exists not in a traditional research institution, but in the offices of a state-run press dedicated to the performing arts. Also, it consists of materials that have been saved after critics, researchers, and editors have completed the process of publishing their work. Much more than photographs, this collection also contains programs, unpublished manuscripts, and various theatre ephemera from all over the globe and in multiple languages.1\n\n1 The name of the press refers to Tablas, a Cuban journal for scenic arts, and a book series for performing arts named after José Jacinto Milanés's 1838 play El conde Alarcos. While the press's “photography-plus” collection does have a few unpublished versions of scripts, the playtext itself—typically the nexus of the theatre archive—is not a major component of the Tablas-Alarcos archive. However, the press has produced a large archive of Cuban plays through their output of books and issues of the journal Tablas, which usually features one script per issue. The last time I worked with the material part of the collection was in 2016. Since then, the physical materials have been moved out of the Tablas-Alarcos offices, although the press still hosts a significant digital photography collection.\n\n3 No doubt, there is a lot of overlap between critics and researchers, but in this essay, I use “critic” to refer to someone writing about a performance they witnessed live, and “historiographer” to refer to someone writing about a performance through its documentation alone and at a greater temporal distance from the performance event.\n\n6 Here I am thinking of Joseph Roach's genealogies of performance, Diana Taylor's cultural memory, Rebecca Schneider's discussion of repetition and memory in performance, Fred Moten's fugitive knowledge, Ann Cvetkovic's work with affect theory in reading queer archives, Alexandra T. Vazquez's insistence on listening in detail against reductive taxonomies and anthologizing practices, and Solimar Otero's concept of residual transcriptions in Afro-Latinx religious practices, among others. See Joseph Roach, Cities of the Dead: Circum-Atlantic Performance (New York: Columbia University Press, 1996); Diana Taylor, The Archive and the Repertoire: Performing Cultural Memory in the Americas (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2003); Fred Moten, In the Break: The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2003); Ann Cvetkovich, An Archive of Feelings: Trauma, Sexuality, and Lesbian Public Cultures (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2003); Rebecca Schneider, Performing Remains: Art and War in Times of Theatrical Reenactment (New York: Routledge, 2011); Alexandra T. Vazquez, Listening in Detail: Performances of Cuban Music (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2013); Solimar Otero, Archives of Conjure: Stories of the Dead in Afrolatinx Cultures (New York: Columbia University Press, 2020).\n\n17 Some date the gray years from 1971 to 1976, others from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s or 1980. For an overview of the debate around defining revolutionary culture beginning in the 1960s see Polémicas culturales de los 60, comp. and ed. Graziella Pogolotti (Havana: Letras Cubanas, 2006). For an account of the marginalization censored artists experienced, see Antón Arrufat, Virgilio Piñera: Entre él y yo (Havana: Ediciones Unión, 1994), 42–7.\n\n23 Ibid. In the early 1980s, Blanco continuously collaborated with Cuba's leading dance company, Danza Nacional. That collaboration spanned multiple productions, including Yerma, Lope de Vega's Fuenteovejuna in 1984, and a devised work based on José Martí's war diary, titled De los días de la guerra, which was presented both at the 1982 Havana Theatre Festival with Danza Nacional and in the 1984 festival with a mixed collective that included music by composer Leo Brouwer."
