        "text": "Undoubtedly, the visage of Frida Kahlo has become the most instantly recognizable of all artists across time. Since her popularization in the 1980’s, she has been the subject of books, movies, an opera and a great deal of visual art created by others who have been moved by her paintings and life story. Drawn entirely from the Museum’s Permanent Collection, this exhibit explores works inspired by Frida Kahlo; the work of her students, known as “Los Fridos,” who learned from and surrounded her while she recovered at home in La Casa Azul; as well as familiar items that Kahlo chose to surround herself with such as arte popular, Mesoamerican artifacts and traditional clothing from her beloved Mexico."
