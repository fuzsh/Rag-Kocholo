        "text": "Throughout the 2024 election, KATU News is helping you “Know Your Candidates” with a series of interviews with people who will appear on your ballot.\n\nWe are asking local candidates running for the same office the same series of questions, so you can compare their answers.\n\nCandidates interviewed on camera were given approximately seven minutes to answer seven questions. Some candidates may have spent more time on some questions and so did not answer all of them on camera.\n\nWe also sent questionnaires to those candidates.\n\nFor some races, we only sent questionnaires to candidates.\n\nIf a candidate submitted responses to the questionnaire, those can be found below.\n\nAll candidates running for U.S. Senator for Washington:\n\nThor Amundson (I) - Did not participate\n\nMaria Cantwell (D) - Did not participate\n\nHenry Clay Dennison (Socialist Workers) - Did not participate\n\nPaul Lawrence Giesick (D) - Did not participate\n\nGoodspaceguy (R) - Did not participate\n\nChuck Jackson (I) - Did not participate\n\nScott Nazarino (R) - Did not participate\n\nMel Ram (R) - Did not participate\n\nRaul Garcia (R)\n\nTell us about yourself.\n\nI’m not a career politician. I’m an Emergency Room doctor who for 26 years has served patients at their most vulnerable moments.\n\nI’m also not a born American, but an adopted one who had a love for this country before even stepping foot on it. I was 11 years old when my mother and I escaped communist Cuba and found refuge in America.\n\nAmerica has given me the opportunity to make the American Dream a reality. So, when I see the problems facing our state and our nation, I will step up and work to help resolve them.\n\nWhy are you running for Washington State Senator?\n\nOur state is in the midst of serious crises that need more attention than they are getting from our current leadership.\n\nThe deadly drug fentanyl is the worst killer I've in 26 years. In the ER, I treat two to five overdoses on every single shift. I’ve met far too many people who’ve lost loved ones to fentanyl. I’ve put together a plan, based on methods that have worked elsewhere, to target fentanyl dealers with felony charges and serious prison time, and give addicts a mandatory treatment and recovery program to guarantee more positive outcomes for their future.\n\nAnother major crisis is the high cost of living. The cost of groceries, homes, rent, childcare, gas, and basic needs is out of control. People are being stretched beyond their financial limits just to pay for the basics. We have to stop the reckless federal spending that has put our national debt at dangerous levels. And we need to support good policies that boost productivity and lower prices for consumers.\n\nFor years now, women in many parts of Washington have faced an OB-GYN crisis, losing access to local healthcare services. Our leaders, including the incumbent, have done nothing to stop this crisis. As a physician who provides healthcare to women, I will listen to the women of Washington and help solve this crisis now.\n\nI believe Democrats and Republicans should, can and must work together on these problems instead of wasting time on political partisanship. The people of Washington deserve a government of solutions.\n\nWhat are your qualifications?\n\nI am not a career politician. I am a leader in my medical profession, having been elected to national medical organizations such as the American College of Emergency Medicine, the American Osteopathic Association, and the Bureau of Interns and Residents. I've been a doctor in Emergency Medicine for 26 years, and am the current Chief Medical Officer of Astria Toppenish Hospital. I'm a past owner of a medical practice, the co-founding Dean of two medical schools, and the Medical Director of two hospitals.\n\nI'm also active in my community. In 2020 I co-founded the Partnership for Food Security to promote education for COVID-19, particularly in the Latino community. And I helped lead local drives for a domestic violence shelter, toys for sick kids, bikes for books, and feeding the homeless.\n\nWhat do you see as the number one job for the next United States Senator elected from Washington state?\n\nWe must take strong action to combat the deadly fentanyl crisis that is killing Washingtonians by the thousands, and will continue to kill even more if we stay on the path we're on now.\n\nOur current leaders haven't done nearly enough to stop fentanyl dealers and help addicts, taking half-measures that are ineffective and in some cases wasteful. We must treat this crisis like the true emergency it is. Every day wasted means more lives lost.\n\nMy Americans Against Fentanyl Act, which I've developed by studying programs that work and by talking with treatment experts and former addicts, would impose felony charges and significant prison time on serious dealers. It would also provide mandatory rehabilitation and recovery services for addicts so they can conquer their addiction and rebuild their lives.\n\nI've met far too many people who've lost loved ones to fentanyl. We need to get serious about stopping this tragedy and saving lives.\n\nShould the United States put more strict conditions on its support for Israel or how Israel uses U.S. weapons? Why or why not?\n\nI believe it is in our national interest to combat the terrorist group Hamas. It is also in the best interests of the Israeli and Palestinian people for Hamas to no longer hold power. Israelis should be able to live free from the threat of terrorist attack, and Palestinians should be able to have a government that protects them and respects their rights.\n\nWhile I don’t believe we currently need to impose more strict conditions on Israel, the U.S. does have the right and responsibility, when supplying weapons to any country, to hold the receiving country accountable.\n\nHamas’ actions on Oct. 7, which broke the peace between the two sides, was disgraceful. The U.S. should contribute to a solution that provides peace and security to both Israelis and Palestinians and offers the desired goal of two states.\n\nWhat should Congress do to discourage illegal immigration and encourage legal immigration?\n\nI came to this country legally and I strongly believe in legal immigration into the U.S. But the legal immigration system these days is too cumbersome and bureaucratic and must be revamped.\n\nOn border security, I believe every sovereign nation must vet who comes into the country. That is not happening now, and order must be restored. Human traffickers, criminals, drug dealers, terrorists and more are getting into the U.S. at an alarming rate. It is essential that we have and maintain strong borders.\n\nWhen we’re talking about individuals who have been in our country for many years and have worked hard and paid taxes, I would like for them to stop looking over their shoulder and fearing deportation. I believe they should have a way to get to a permanent residency, perhaps not citizenship yet because they did break the law, and that may be their penalty.\n\nI believe a solution like this should get support from both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nWhy should people who live in Washington vote for you?\n\nWashington is a wonderful place to live, filled with enormous human and natural resources, but we have lost our way and gone a bit off-track. This election is an opportunity for the people of Washington to change the way we are governed – to stop the cycle of divisive politics that ignores the best interests of our people.\n\nIt would be a great honor to have your vote. Together, we can do better for Washington."
