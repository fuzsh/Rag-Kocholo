        "text": "When Hilary Franz decided to exit the job of Public Lands Commissioner in order for a chance to be in the U.S. House of Representatives, seven people competed in the August primary to be the new head of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).\n\nTwo weeks later, the race is still undecided as just a few dozen votes separate second place from third place. In Washington, the top two vote-getters in each respective category from the primary advance to the November general election.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Republican, has claimed the most votes and it is front by just under 23,000. But who her challenger will be has yet to be determined.\n\nAs of late Tuesday afternoon, King County Council member Dave Upthegrove, a Democrat, grabbed the lead over Republican Sue Kuehl Pederson, according to voting results listed on the Washington Secretary of State website. Upthegrove leads by the remarkably slim margin of 51 votes or less than one-hundredth of a percentage point. Upthegrove has secured 396,300 votes and Pederson is at 396,249.\n\nThe Seattle Times has called this one of the tightest statewide races in the last 20 years. Both campaigns are already pushing for a recount with the race too close to call. There are still several thousand votes to be counted, according to the secretary of state’s office, while another 9,000 ballots have already been challenged.\n\nA recount would take another 10 to 14 days to confirm.\n\nIf Pederson does advance to the general election, she and Beutler would make history with a general election victory as the first Republican woman elected as Commissioner of Public Lands. The victor would also be just the second Republican woman to hold a statewide office in Washington.\n\nThe lands commissioner is the elected custodian of state forests and waters, who manages Washington’s response to wildfires and the Department of the DNR. Hilary Franz has held the role since 2017.\n\nOther primary election races\n\nUS Senate seat to represent WA\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell cruised in her race for a U.S. Senate seat from Washington. The 23-year incumbent received 57% of the vote.\n\nCantwell will take on Dr. Raul Garcia currently an emergency physician and the medical director of Toppenish’s Astria Hospital. Garcia, who previously ran for governor of Washington in 2020, received slightly more than 20% of ballots counted. Garcia was endorsed by state Republican delegates earlier this year.\n\nNo other candidate received more than 6% of the vote in the primary.\n\nMore on Raul Garcia: Senate candidate Garcia proposes ‘drastic measure’ to address nation’s drug problem\n\nAttorney General\n\nWith Bob Ferguson departing his post for a chance to become the next governor of Washington, Pete Serrano (R), the mayor of Pasco, took a commanding lead by grabbing 42% of the vote.\n\nIf elected in November, Serrano will be the first Republican to serve as Attorney General since Rob McKenna in 2012.\n\nU.S. Attorney Nick Brown (D) will face off against Serrano after receiving the second-most votes (35%). Brown has previously stated he wouldn’t hesitate to file lawsuits if needed to protect abortion access in Washington, according to Axios, while maintaining support for the state’s gun control laws, including the ban on selling semi-automatic rifles.\n\nState Sen. Manka Dhingra failed to advance out of the primary after receiving just 22% of the vote.\n\nMore on Nick Brown: Former US attorney announces run for Washington AG\n\nSeattle City Council’s 1-year seat\n\nWinning Position 8 on the Seattle City Council, a citywide seat, only wins the person one year on the job this time around.\n\nNormally a four-year position, this year’s candidates are vying to finish the final 13 months of former Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda’s term. Tanya Woo, a business owner and activist within the Chinatown-International District, temporarily filled the vacancy, but is now running to finish the term against Alexis Mercedes Rinck.\n\nThe primary has now revealed that Woo and Rinck will move on to the November election.\n\nMore on Tanya Woo: Woo chosen to join Seattle City Council for citywide seat\n\nWoo’s challenger is Alexis Mercedes Rinck, an assistant director at the University of Washington (UW) and someone who previously worked with the King County Regional Homelessness Authority. She pulled in 50% of the vote with nearly 100,000 votes — 12% and approximately 25,000 votes more than Woo."
