The performance of our students throughout this year’s Hearst competitions is a powerful illustration of how the talent of our students and the dedicated support of our faculty and staff combine to continually reach for new standards of excellence. I thank our faculty for mentoring, elevating and supporting the work of our students competing in the Hearst competitions.”\n\nIn addition to the overall win, the school finished first in the multimedia and writing categories and second in the television, photojournalism and audio categories while eight UNC Hussman students were among 29 students nationally who competed for individual honors June 1-6 in San Francisco.\n\nAnna Connors ’24\n\nKenzie Bulris ’25\n\nMarilee Combs ’24\n\nSinclair Holian ’24\n\nSierra Pfeifer ’24\n\nLia Salvatierra ’24\n\nSteven Schlink ’24\n\nHenry Taylor ’25\n\nThe individual championship finals were the culmination of monthly competitions throughout the year among students at more than 100 journalism and media programs.
