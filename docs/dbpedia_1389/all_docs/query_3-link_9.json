        "meta_description": "US Army\nSGT\nWorld War 2\n\n\tRaul Garcia was born at home in San Diego on December 13, 1925. From age 16 to 18, Raul worked as a postal clerk. On his 18th birthday, he received his draft notice with instructions to report to the processing center at Camp Elliot, which is today the Torrey Pines golf course. Camp Elliot was an induction center, Army boot camp, and artillery weapons training center. \n\n\tDuring Raul’s initial medical processing, it was discovered that he had a punctured left eardrum, placing him in a 4F status or unfit for military service.  Raul was disappointed and petitioned his local processing center to re-examine him.  He was placed on a waitlist for an opening in the schedule.  An appointment for the Los Angeles Processing Center specialist clinic was found in a few weeks, and Raul took the bus up to LA.\n\n\tRaul reported to the Ear Nose and Throat clinic.  He was examined and told again his eardrum would rupture when the gunfire started.  The doctor asked if he wanted to sign a waiver, and he replied, “Yes, Sir.”  Ten days later, on April 16th, 1944, he reported to Camp Roberts for infantry training.  Raul’s eardrum is fine; it never ruptured during his enlistment. \n\n\tAfter initial training, he reported to Fort Ord in Monterey, CA. to the 8th Army 7th Infantry Division as a replacement troop for the Pacific.  He shipped to the Pacific on a liberty ship as a replacement troop.  Raul was still in transit when the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, bringing an end to the war.  Raul landed in Yokohama to serve with occupational forces.\n\n\tWith Raul’s previous postal work, he was assigned to the 704th postal unit, where the Fleet Post Office (FPO) mail was processed on the northern island of Hokkaido in Sapporo.  Raul was assigned to deliver and accompany mail to other basses riding the train around Japan.\n\n\tHe also tested for his military driver’s license, allowing him to be assigned as the company commander.  He drove the CO in his Jeep Willy to meetings at Division HQ and duties around the island and base.  Raul was responsible for the Jeep 24 hours a day.  He also loved having the Jeep for some after-hours rides around Japan.\n\n\tRaul received his discharge notice in November of 1946 and loaded a troop transport liberty ship to return to the US on the Victory ship SS Puerto Rico.  They returned to San Francisco, offloaded at Oakland Army Base and discharged at Camp Beale. \n\n\tRaul returned to the Post office and worked most of his 44 years at the Fleet Post office at the Broadway Pier complex, retiring in 1995. Raul was married and had three children.",

        "text": "Wayne C Davis\n\nUS Army\n\nCPL\n\nWorld War 2\n\nWayne Davis was born on August 9, 1925, and grew up in Hollywood, California. He graduated from Hollywood High School in the summer of 1943 and was inducted into the Army at Fort MacArthur in San Pedro, California.\n\nAfter basic training, Wayne attended advanced individualized training as an airplane and engine mechanic with a MOS of 747(AEM). An AEM is responsible for examining aircraft wings, fuselage, stabilizers, flight control surfaces, propeller, and landing gear for evidence of damage or wear, such as cracks, bent or broken members, and looseness, which might cause dangerous vibration. AEMs correct defects by appropriate maintenance, minor repairs, adjustments, or replacement.\n\nWayne spent very few days working on aircraft and spent the majority of his service time with infantry units, where men were needed most.\n\nPrivate Davis served in Europe from June 1944 until January 1946 in campaigns including Northern France and the Rhineland, as well as the Central Europe campaigns. CPL Davis was promoted in August of 1945 and served as a CPL until he completed his tour in Europe. Corporal Davis was awarded the Bronze Star for heroism when he ran into a burning munitions dump that had been shelled. He returned three times and pulled three soldiers out to safety. Wayne has a key that he had worn around his neck that today bears a mangled piece of shrapnel embedded with the key that looks to have saved his life that fateful day.\n\nAfter he was discharged, Wayne flew with an Air Corps friend in a B-25, delivering mail all over Europe during the early days of the occupation forces. Wayne's sister, Marjorie Laverne “Margie” Davis, was a pilot in the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) with the 2563rd Base Unit. She died October 16, 1944, in service on a cross-country flight at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, TX.\n\nWayne returned to the United States, serving stateside from 12 January 1946 until 2 February 1946, when he returned to Fort MacArthur in San Pedro, California, to separate from the service.\n\nCorporal Davis was Honorably Bischarged on February 11, 1946. He was awarded a Combat Infantryman Badge, the Bronze Star Medal, the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, and a Good Conduct Medal."
