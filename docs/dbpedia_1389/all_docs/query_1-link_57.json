        "text": "The Lecturers for this course are Prof. Kousha Etessami and Dr. Raul Garcia-Patron.\n\nOne of the remarkable developments in Computer Science over the past 30 years has been the realization that the ability of computers to use randomness can lead sometimes to algorithms that are more efficient, conceptually simpler and more elegant that their best-known deterministic counterparts. Randomization has by now become a ubiquitous tool in computation, from applied physics to machine learning.\n\nThis course will survey several of the most widely used techniques in this context, illustrating them with examples taken from algorithms, such as Monte Carlo or Gibbs sampling, and combinatorics. Our goal is to provide a solid background in the key ideas used in the design and analysis of randomized algorithms and probabilistic processes.\n\nThe required textbook for the course is \"Probability and Computing: Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis\" by Mitzenmacher and Upfal.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this course, you should be able to:"
