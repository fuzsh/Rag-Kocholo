Once I heard Ettore's sound it never left my soul and it keeps inspiring my viola playing beyond imagination.\" He also wishes to recognize Syoko Aki, Dean Blocker, the Tokyo String Quartet and the late Jesse Levine.\n\nOne of the most active orchestras in Colombia, the National Symphony Orchestra of Colombia was founded in 2003, though it has operated under various other names since the 1950's. The orchestra is located in Columbia's capital city, Bogotá.\n\nMr. García began his studies at early age in Batuta Foundation.

Raúl was awarded the Carolina Oramas Scholarship by ICETEX.\n\nAn avid chamber music performer, Mr. García has appeared at the St. Lawrence Quartet Chamber Music Seminar, Innsbrook Institute, Zukerman’s Young Artist Program, The Pacific Music Festival, Yellow Barn, the Perlman Music Program and the Menuhin Festival Gstaad. Recent discography projects include a CD for NAXOS titled “Tango Distinto” with music of Astor Piazzola; along with trombone player Achilles Liarmakopoulos.\n\nMr. García holds a bachelor's degree from Juan N. Corpas University, and the Master of Music degree and Artist Diploma from the Yale School of Music. While a student at Yale, García won the Georgina Lucy Grosvenor Memorial Prize for excellence in performance in 2010.\n\nHe is currently a doctoral candidate at Rutgers University, where he studied with Philadelphia Orchestra principal violist Choong-Jin Chang.
