Sculpted Raúl García Latorre, Boxart by Jaume Ortiz. kit includes: 6 kit parts.\n\nAlong with the Coldstream and Grenadier Guards, the Scots Guards were part of the Guards brigade during the Crimea War. They were involved in the conflict from the early beginning in 1854.\n\nDuring the engagement at Battle of the Alma River, the first wave of British and French assault units was repelled by the Russians and retreated in chaos and confusion, leaving the second wave, where the Guards brigade was included, exposed to the enemy.\n\nThe Scots Guards were the most forward unit of that contingent and, consequently, the first one to be attacked. They managed to hold the line and repel the Russian advance, forcing them to retreat to Sevastopol.\n\nFor their actions on that day, the Scots Guards earned four Victory Crosses and the Battle Honor “Alma”, which holds a special significance to the regiment.\n\nOur miniature is a classic made by Raúl García Latorre for Elite miniatures and depicts an officer from the regiment during the defence action.\n\nText Courtesy of FeR Miniatures"
