        "text": "FeR Miniatures New Releases… and Miniatures Day!\n\nHi everybody!\n\nToo many things to talk about that I don’t know where to start… I think we beat our own mark of amount of new releases for a single month this time with EIGHT new articles. Actually, if you consider that the Celts boxed set is composed of 3 busts, it actually makes it TEN new releases! And all in time for tomorrow’s Miniatures’ Day!\n\nOK, bit by bit. Let’s check the new stuff first.\n\nFirst of all, some new 54 mm figure by our collaborator Eduard Pérez.\n\n54 mm Collector Series\n\nDZS00011 – Volontario Garibaldino, 1859\n\nSculpture: Eduard Pérez\n\nPainting: Jaume Ortiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 7\n\nScale: 54 mm\n\nAlso, some new re-releases for our Elite Classics collection.\n\nElite Classics\n\nELI00028 – Officer, Royal Horse Artillery, 1842\n\nSculpture: Juan Carlos Ávila\n\nPainting: Alfonso Prado\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 8\n\nScale: 54 mm\n\nElite Classics\n\nELI00029 – Attila the Hun\n\nSculpture: Mike Good\n\nPainting: Fernando Ruiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 7\n\nScale: 75 mm\n\nThese two are long out of production kits that surely will delight the fans of classic miniatures. Let’s check some new sci-fi stuff now, a really bad-ass addition to our Future is Now line.\n\nFuture is Now\n\nFIN00004 – USMC Drill Sergeant, 2075\n\nSculpture: Pedro Fernández\n\nPainting: Marc Masclans\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 5\n\nScale: 1/10\n\nAnd also the big release for this month, this impossibly cool vignette of 1/12 busts for Magna Historica, depicting the last battle of Vercingetorix and the Gauls against the mighty armies of Rome.\n\nMagna Historica\n\nMHB01004 – The Last Stand, Alesia, 52 BC\n\nSculpture: Ramón Martínez\n\nPainting: Alfonso Giraldes\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 31 (including the exclusive hound bust)\n\nScale: 1/12\n\nOK, let’s talk for a second about this one. This limited edition boxed set is a pre-release of three busts based on the last battle of the Celtic Gaul that will be released separately next month (we simply couldn’t resist the temptation of having them available for the Miniatures’ Day).\n\nIt includes Vercingetorix, a young Gallic warrior, and a Gallic standard-bearer, along with an exclusive bust of a Celtic hound. It also includes a QR code that grants access to extensive video tutorials on the painting of this boxed set by Alfonso Giraldes that will be available starting in September. The box is limited to only 100 sets and comes with a limited edition certificate. Keeping in mind that it comes out just in time for the Miniatures’s Day, when you have the special 20% discount, we think it will sell out fast. So, if you like these busts, don’t miss tomorrow’s chance of getting them in advance, cheaper, with the exclusive hound bust, and including FREE access to the painting video tutorials of the boxarts.\n\nWhat more do we have? Oh, yes, another pair of minibusts for the always popular line of Portraits from the Middle Ages.\n\nPortraits from the Middle Ages\n\nPMA00007 – Oeselian Warrior, Muhu, 1227\n\nSculpture: Paul Deheleanu\n\nPainting: Fernando Ruiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 3\n\nScale: 1/16\n\nPortraits from the Middle Ages\n\nPMA00008 – Livonian Brother of the Sword, Muhu, 1227\n\nSculpture: Paul Deheleanu\n\nPainting: Fernando Ruiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 2\n\nScale: 1/16\n\nThis new pair is centered in the Baltic Crusades, featuring a pagan Estonian warrior and a Germanic knight from a not-so-well-known order, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword. As they engage in epic battles and strategic maneuvers, the pagan warrior proudly wields a real Viking sword, adding an authentic touch to the historical narrative. Closing the ranks, another long-awaited piece, the continuation of the Four Seasons collection, seamlessly weaves together the intricate stories of these characters and their weapons.\n\nWomen, by Pepa Saavedra\n\nWOM00010 – Autumn\n\nSculpture: Pedro Fernández\n\nPainting: Pepa Saavedra\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 2\n\nScale: 1/10\n\nThese are the new releases. Let’s talk about the elephant in the room, the Miniatures’ Day.\n\nThe offer will work as follows:\n\n– The offer starts on Friday, August, 6th at 10:00 AM (Spanish time, GMT +1) and will end on Saturday, August, 7th at 10:00 AM (Spanish time, GMT +1).\n\n– During these 24 hours, all items at the FeR Miniatures online shop will be sold at a 20% discount.\n\n– Also included in the offer will be the August new releases.\n\n– Shipping costs are not included in the discount.\n\n– The offer will be valid for 24 hours or end of stock.\n\nThis year we have prepared a special feature, a live Miniatures’ Day presentation streaming in collaboration with our friends from Miniature Art TV.\n\nThe streaming will start this evening at 8 PM Spanish time (7 PM UK time) and we have some special surprises in store, like special guests, live interviews, and a crazily exclusive give-away for the viewers, the very first copy (number 00) of The Last Stand boxed set. Do you want to win it? Then don’t miss the streaming, where we will explain how you can participate. It will happen on Miniature Art TV’s Youtube Channel.\n\nNot much more to say I guess. Get ready for tomorrow and see you later on the streaming!\n\nCheers\n\nFeR\n\nFeR Miniatures New Releases and… Miniatures Day!!!\n\nHi all\n\nAre you ready for some rock’n’roll?!\n\nWe have the new releases ready, as we normally do on the eve of Miniatures’ Day!\n\nThis year we have just a couple of new miniatures for this day, as we are really busy with another upcoming project that is catching most of our attention (I’m so looking forward to being able to tell you more about it… I can barely keep my mouth shut!). Nevertheless, they are some really cool figures and we expect that you like them:\n\n54mm Collectors Series\n\nDZS00008 – Trooper, 17th Lancers, Crimea, 1854\n\nSculpture: Eduard Pérez\n\nPainting: Jaume Ortiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 9\n\nScale: 54 mm\n\nElite Classics\n\nELI00016 – Sergeant, 93rd Sutherland Highlanders, Balaclava, 1854\n\nSculpture: Raúl García Latorre\n\nPainting: Fernando Ruiz\n\nMaterial: Resin\n\nNumber of parts of the kit: 4\n\nScale: 1/12\n\nOK, the only thing left to do is a brief reminder for tomorrow.
