        "text": "Alma Guillermoprieto\n\nIf we state that a photograph never portrays reality, but is rather an image of the dreamlike state induced in the photographer at the moment of his or her encounter with reality, Cuba: Dos épocas provides us with marvelous proof of our thesis. Constantino Arias, who created his best work in the period immediately before the watershed year of 1959, and Raúl Corrales, who came into his own as an artist thanks to Fidel Castro’s revolution, present photographs that lead to a Cuban reverie because they are, in turn, images of two dreams.\n\nAccording to what can be learned from books, Cuba is a sugarproducing nation of barely twelve million people. It is poor, like so many of its island neighbors, adrift in a sea barely large enough to act as a conduit between two continents. But the island of dreams that Constantino Arias shows us is another country altogether: it is the magical and exalted spot in which all the races and all the pleasures of the planet converge in an endless exhibitionist feast. It is a country of chorus girls, cabaret artists, gamblers, revelers, night owls, and bongo players, whose very sense of themselves depends on being able to display their salsa, their shimmy, their joy of life, and their behinds before our astonished and delighted eyes.\n\nThere was a time when Arias’s photographs were used to demonstrate the abject decadence to which a succession of dictators had brought the Cuban people. Now that postrevolutionary Cuba, too, offers sun, booze, and whores to the dollar-carrying tourist, the same images lose their accusatory charge. Instead, they can usefully help explain why Cuba has always occupied a privileged spot in the world’s collective dreamscape of pleasure.\n\nA key can be found in a pair of portraits: one of a black couple, professional dancers of rumba who are not young, and who nevertheless show off their less-than-firm flesh with provocative cheer; the other of an extremely white-skinned blonde who, naked, examines herself in a mirror with delighted satisfaction. What sets Cuba apart even from other orgiastic cultures is that it has always offered pleasure without shame and without guilt— or, at least, this is the fantasy proposed in Arias’s work, which so perfectly matches our own: in the Cuba of the permanent carnival, there are those who pay and those who buy, but the party is for everyone.\n\nThree or four of Arias’s photographs—a beggar outside a hospital, a woman in her squalid kitchen—help us see how it could have been possible for the pleasure-loving Cubans to surrender wholly to the ascetic Fidel Castro. But the fact is that there is no satisfactory explanation for a revolution. What Raúl Corrales’s photographs manage to do is submerge us in the revolutionary fantasy that captivated an entire idealistic generation worldwide. Here are the bearded rebels—los barbudos—the enraptured followers of el Barbudo Mayor, Fidel. Here is Fidel himself, heroic in the wilderness of the Sierra Maestra. Here is the New Man, hacking his way through the underbrush.\n\nCorrales’s most hypnotic photographs breathe the humidity of the tropical countryside—rebels with rain, rebels with mountains, rebels against a backdrop of storm clouds. It is worth remembering that the thousand and one rural guerrilla groups that sprang up all over the world in the wake of the Sierra Maestra epic were largely the creation of urban youths, virgins in their experience with the tropical wild, who felt they had to go in search of a sacred mystery at its heart. Throughout the years that this revolutionary impulse lasted, the clandestine operatives in the cities consistently took more losses and were tortured and imprisoned in greater numbers than their rural counterparts, yet the rebels in the mountains and the jungle were always the ones who enjoyed greater moral authority—as if communion with nature were indeed the act that would lead humanity to that higher stage dreamed of by Che Guevara.\n\nThe magnetic pull of the guerrillas’ bucolic utopia was so strong that, after the Revolution’s triumph, Fidel realized that he would have to return to the Sierra Maestra with his former combatants so that Corrales could take some of the more emblematic pictures in this book. In other words, the pictures of the barbudos in the woods are staged. But it doesn’t matter. We still want to see them, so we can dream again, like in the old days.\n\nThere are also “real” photographs, so to speak. In one, militiamen prepare their defense against the coming invasion from the north with the help of some toy planes; in another, young soldiers from the brand-new Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces celebrate their wedding under an arch formed by antiaircraft guns. Oddly, it is these unstaged pictures that cut most uncomfortably close to the rhetorical. The Revolution allowed Corrales to live off his work as a recognized artist; in exchange, he lost the unpretentious selfconfidence of the artisan, which is one of the qualities that makes Arias’s work so beguiling. But Corrales’s achievement is part of history; he captured the moment when Cuba stopped displaying itself for others and turned its full attention inward. None of his images is marked by the compulsive need to please that appears again and again in Arias’s most distinctive work. In Corrales’s portrait of a rebel napping in a bourgeois residence, we are once again seduced by the sensuality and beauty of the Cuban people, but this time we also feel relief, because the photograph’s subject doesn’t seem interested in us in the slightest. Soon, the Revolution would turn its attention to the creation of an image of Cuba worthy of feeding the world’s dreams. (Corrales’s staged photographs in the Sierra Maestra are a beginning.) But in these first, fresh images of the Revolution, the world is new, and so is our gaze.\n\nTranslated from Spanish"
