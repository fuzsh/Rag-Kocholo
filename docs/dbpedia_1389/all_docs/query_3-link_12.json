        "text": "FMBE Awards category assessment write ups continue with Team of the Year x 2 and Sponsorship Activation. Team of the Year was an especially compelling competition this year with the Brand Experience Teams putting up some impressive performances and matching the Field Sales category for strength. We don't often see this as Field Sales is just so accountable and the teams are often full time, so teambuilding is a bigger challenge for brand experience. That's no to say that the #fieldsales teams didn't surpass themselves though - they did! In Sponsorship Activation it was just such a logical tie up that saw Loch Lomond Whisky prevail with agency Multiply. Its a sponsorship that has made a big difference to the brand. https://lnkd.in/eBVfKgV #fieldsales #brandexperience #retail #merchandising #sponsorshipactivation REL Field Marketing Weetabix Elevate Field Marketing Britvic plc adidas Produce UK HEL's Elevate Global Fizz Experience & WDS (Warehouse Demo Services) Costco Wholesale Multiply Agency Circle Agency Wasserman Marketing\n\nSpent the day at Coca-Cola a week or so ago creating headshots for members of their leadership team.

This gigantic, brightly lit Digital Screen is well known as the first curved outdoor LED screen in Sri Lanka. This screen creates a vibrant and dynamic visual making this prime location a strikingly visible attraction in the commercial hub of Colombo. #emergingmedia hashtag#emergingmedialk hashtag#ledtvs hashtag#ledscreen hashtag#branding hashtag#brandadvertising hashtag#brandingstrategy hashtag#ledadvertising hashtag#oohmedia hashtag#outdoormarketing hashtag#advertising hashtag#advertisingagency hashtag#digitaladvertising hashtag#onlineadvertising hashtag#advertisinglife hashtag#advertising_insta hashtag#outdooradvertising hashtag#insta_advertising hashtag#facebookadvertising hashtag#socialmediaadvertising hashtag#advertisingcampaign hashtag#creativeadvertising hashtag#advertisingdesign hashtag#videoadvertising"
