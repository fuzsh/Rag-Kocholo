        "text": "Conceria Pasubio: Fatturato 350M‚Ç¨ (2022). Intervista al CEO Luca Pretto \"We don‚Äôt have suppliers, we have partners. We are all part of a much bigger supply chain with the final customer that will choose one final product. So I feel part of Porsche, I feel part of Bentley, I feel part of Lamborghini. We share goals. We want to engage them in our strategy and we want to be transparent. We have to understand that we are part of a bigger family than our single company,\" Pretto states. \"It‚Äôs not a matter of contracts, it‚Äôs a matter of a vision of the same target. We need to grow together, we need to perform together, but we have to sign a pact of continuous improvement.\" \"My concentration now is on who more than what. Who makes things happen and how to organize them, how to make talent grow in the company, how to attract talent from outside of the company. I want to be a facilitator of the talent in our company,\" \"With the right people, you can execute the perfect product.\" Pretto says. #leather #pasubio #concerie #supplychain #fashion #luxury #automotive #lamborghini #bentley #ferrari #bmw #rollroyce #mercedes #car #supercars\n\n1987 Porsche 959 Komfort SOLD!! $1,870,000 LOT S148 // KISSIMMEE 2024 Twin-Turbo 2.85L Flat-6, 6-Speed, 14,679 Miles ODOMETER READS 14,686 miles SPECIFICATIONS ENGINE 2.85L Flat 6-Cylinder TRANSMISSION 6-Speed Manual EXTERIOR COLOR Silver Metallic INTERIOR COLOR Black MAKE Porsche MODEL 959 TRIM/SUBMODEL Komfort AUCTION Kissimmee 2024 HIGHLIGHTS 1 of only 292 959s ever produced for the world Matching numbers 2.85L twin-turbocharged flat 6-cylinder engine Factory Silver Metallic over 'Interior to Sample' Black leather upholstery French market example showing just 14,686 miles California smog legal Documented with Canepa service binders, copy of Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, import documentation, owner‚Äôs manuals, tool kit, warning triangle and more THE STORY The Porsche 959 redefined the sports car market in late 1980s with its many technological advancements that have since become standard on most modern supercars. In comparison to the Ferrari F40 and Lamborghini Countach, which were very raw, simple machines, the 959 had many electronic and mechanical improvements that made the 959 the most luxurious, reliable and tractable. Alongside Lamborghini‚Äôs Countach and Ferrari‚Äôs F40 and 288 GTO, the 959 was not only a ‚Äúposter car‚Äù for a generation of automotive enthusiasts, but also the least produced with only 292 examples built. Powered by a flat-6 engine derived from the successful 962 race car, the 959 used water-cooled heads instead of air-cooling as the thermal limit could not accommodate the 444 HP output of the 959. Power was fed through a specially designed BorgWarner 6-speed transmission, which includes an extremely low \"Gel√§nde\" gear for use in off-road situations, which the Type 961 rally car might have encountered. Porsche‚Äôs Porsche-Steur-Kupplung (PSK) system allowed the driver to vary the 370 lb-ft of torque between the rear and front axles, allowing up to 80% to the rear under hard acceleration, all managed electronically. This 1987 Porsche 959 Komfort was completed on April 13, 1988 and delivered new to France finished in S7 Silver Metallic with an ‚ÄúInterior to Sample‚Äù (99) in black leather, a color combination it still retains to this day. As the standard 959 was so well equipped, this Komfort was simply optioned with an alarm system and heated and electrically adjustable sport seats. As per the copy of the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, it retains the matching-numbers ‚ÄúM959/50‚Äù 2.85L twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine. #classic #classics #classiccars #collectorcars #carcollectors #historic #vintage #performance #racing #rallying #driving #car #cars #automotiveindustry #auto #autos #autoindustry #auction #forsale #sold #automotive #investment #privatesale\n\n\"What if I had bought that Ferrari 288 GTO at the 2003 Bonhams Ferrari auction in Gstaad's Palace Hotel\"? I lived in the Geneva at the time, and the annual Ferrari auction in Gstaad was one of the things I definitely wanted to experience now I lived so close by. I never forget the event, nor the drive to it. Both were magical. It snowed heavily and I had to drive through dark, empty mountain roads, alone in my Alfa V6, covered by some moonlight through the trees, and I just heard the sound of the famous Busso engine and the snow chirping underneath my winter tires. Before moving to Geneva I had sold my Maserati Ghibli as I had found out in Holland it was undrivable in the snow. The Palace Hotel looks like it is from a Walt Disney fairy tale. The hotel's basement was filled with classic Ferrari's, and there I was, a young commodity trader starting to make some money, and car enthusiast, walking along the world's jet set, inspecting the cars before auction. I kept two catalogues, the year after I went too, and sometimes going through them I have that question, \"what if?\" I know it isn't fair, but a fun thought still, and also a lesson about how #markets, the #economy, risk taking, inflation, safe havens, and the classic car market works. I sat in a couple cars. This very 288 GTO. I recall I was surprised how simple it was. The steering rack I could move up and down a bit, the vents were hard plastic, the dials were very small, and the seats were very thin and tight. Was it a regular second-hand car I had probably dismissed it üòÇ . But this was a piece of Italian art of course. It is something you just sit next to, look at and enjoy. CHF 350k at the time was Euro 230k. They can do now towards Euro 4 million. It's 14,5% yield per year over 21 years compounded. The S&P500 did 8,5% over that period, excluding dividends, which would have yielded Euro 1,3 million. To be frank, I did not have the #money to buy the GTO, but there were a couple I could have bought, what about a 1972 Dino 246 GT or 1975 Berlinetta Boxer for Euro 50k üò≠ ? 10-15 baggers! And more fun than the S&P 500! In #investing you need to choose your regret."
