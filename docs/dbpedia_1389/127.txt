LaLiga veteran Raúl García, one of the division’s standout players over the past two decades, will retire at the end of the season.

Now aged 37 and into his ninth season with Athletic Club, the midfielder is set to bow out on a high after helping the side to Copa del Rey glory – ending their 40-year wait for a major trophy and netting the first penalty of a tense shootout.

García communicated his decision to his team-mates and club officials at Lezama on Monday morning.

Only two players (Andoni Zubizarreta and Joaquín) have played more LaLiga games than García with 602 to date, during which he has scored 100 goals.

His total career record reads 811 games played and 140 goals scored, while also displaying his versatility throughout spells with Athletic Club, Atlético de Madrid and Osasuna.

During his spell in the Spanish capital, he won a LaLiga title in 2014 as well as the Copa del Rey, Europa League and UEFA Super Cup.

García also won two Spain caps – both coming in 2014.
