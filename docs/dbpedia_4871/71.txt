PEABODY: Joseph A. Sullivan, 93, beloved husband of the late Barbara (Marston) Sullivan, died peacefully on Thursday, January 29, 2015, at Exeter Hospital in Exeter, N.H.

Born in Lynn, he was the son of the late Frederick and Corinne (Walker) Sullivan. He graduated from Lynn English High School. He had lived in Peabody over 20 years, before moving to Northwood and Hampton, N.H., where he had lived the last 30 years.

Mr. Sullivan was a veteran of World War II, with service in the United States Army Air Corps, which is the branch that became the Air Force.

For a career, he worked as an Inspector with General Electric in Lynn, retiring over 25 years ago.

Sully was a member of the American Legion Post 210 of Saugus, enjoyed snowmobiling, building models, and was very handy with household repairs. He had a love for dogs, and was very devoted to various dogs he had over his life that were a source of much love and contentment for him. His most passionate interest was his devotion to family, especially the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
