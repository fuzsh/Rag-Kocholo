The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in Room SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard J. Durbin, Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. Present: Senators Durbin, Blumenthal, Hirono, Cruz, Graham, and Cornyn. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Chairman Durbin. This hearing of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights will come to order. Today's hearing is entitled `` `Stand Your Ground' Laws: Civil Rights and Public Safety Implications of the Expanded Use of Deadly Force.'' We have a large audience in the room today. At the outset, I want to note that the Senate rules prohibit any signs of approbation or disapprobation, which would include outbursts, clapping, or demonstrations. If there is someone who wishes to be witness to this hearing and cannot attend it in this room, there is another room available, Room 226 in the Dirksen Building. I will begin by providing opening remarks and then give my Ranking Member, Senator Cruz, an opportunity before we turn to our witnesses. The debate over ``stand your ground'' laws raises fundamental questions about self-defense in the United States of America. In recent years, we have seen a dramatic increase in laws expanding the situations in which a person can legally use deadly force in response to a perceived threat. Florida passed the first of this new wave of ``stand your ground'' laws in 2005. Prior to 2005, Florida law held that a person outside his home could not use deadly force and then claim self-defense if the person could have safely avoided the confrontation. This ``duty of safe retreat'' sought to prevent public disputes from escalating into violence. But the gun lobby pushed to change Florida's law so people could shoot someone who threatened them without first trying to avoid a confrontation. Florida was not the first State to adopt this ``stand your ground'' principle, but Florida's 2005 law expanded the principle in several dramatic new ways: First, the law grants criminal and civil immunity for uses of deadly force in ``stand your ground'' situations. Second, it replaces a defendant's burden of proving reasonableness with a presumption of reasonableness when the defendant shoots anyone who intrudes upon his home, porch, or vehicle. Third, it even allows the use of deadly force when a threat is not imminent. The gun lobby wanted to spread Florida's law across the Nation, so the National Rifle Association went to ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council, and asked for their help. Now, ALEC is an organization that brings corporate lobbyists and State legislators together for conferences. They draft model bills, and then they work to get them enacted. In 2005, ALEC adopted model legislation that was nearly identical to Florida's law. They then began promoting it in statehouses across the country. Within a year, 13 more States passed similar laws. Today 25 States, not counting Florida, have passed a law based in whole or in part on the ALEC model. ALEC called the enactment of these laws one of ``ALEC's successes.'' CNN described ALEC as being ``behind the spread of stand your ground laws.'' The Wall Street Journal said ALEC was a ``key advocate'' for them. Now that ALEC-style ``stand your ground'' laws are in effect for over half of the United States, we are seeing their national impact when it comes to public safety and civil rights. This is what we will learn from our witnesses today: These ``stand your ground'' laws have led to increases in homicides and firearm injuries--including 600 additional homicides per year--with no deterrent effect on crimes like robbery or assault. This point was made in several studies, including recent research from Texas A&M University. Second, these ``stand your ground'' laws have allowed shooters to walk free in shocking situations--shootouts between rival drug gangs, drug deals gone bad, and more. This point will be made effectively by the testimony of David LaBahn, president and CEO of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. Third, in some devastating cases, the laws have emboldened those who carry guns to initiate confrontations which have ended up killing unarmed children. The testimonies of Sybrina Fulton and Lucia McBath about the devastating losses of their sons make that point more effectively than I ever could. Finally, these ``stand your ground'' laws increase racial disparities in our criminal justice system. One study found that in ``stand your ground'' States nearly 17 percent of homicides involving white shooters and black victims were ruled justified, compared to one percent of homicides with black shooters and white victims. At my request, the Congressional Research Service analyzed FBI data on justifiable homicides before and after the 2005 wave of ``stand your ground'' laws and found that racial disparities clearly increased. I will be putting this CRS memo in the record. [The information referred to appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Durbin. It is clearly time for ``stand your ground'' laws to be carefully reviewed and reconsidered. Whatever the motivation behind them, it is clear that these laws often go too far in encouraging confrontations that escalate into deadly violence. They are resulting in unnecessary tragedies, and they are diminishing accountability under our justice system. I am pleased that the efforts to reconsider these laws are now underway. Earlier this month, one of the legislators who drafted Florida's law joined with some of its chief opponents in a bipartisan effort to change the law. Changes have been passed in a State Senate Committee in Florida. There is more that needs to be done. But we seem to be moving past the question of whether ``stand your ground'' laws should be fixed. Now we should be looking at the best way to fix them. I urge other States that have ``stand your ground'' laws to revisit them as well. To the extent that ``stand your ground'' laws were passed based on the ALEC model, I would note that few who are connected with ALEC appear wedded to that model today. I reached out to every company and organization that has been publicly listed as a member or sponsor of ALEC since 2005, simply asking them, ``Do you support the `stand your ground' bill? '' One hundred forty of them responded; only one said yes. Even ALEC, through a Connecticut State representative and its Chairman, Mr. Piscopo, made a statement to the press that ALEC no longer has a policy on ``stand your ground'' laws. It is also important that Congress review ``stand your ground'' laws because of the way proposed federal legislation implicates those laws. Just this past April, 57 Senators voted for a gun lobby amendment that would allow a person who receives a concealed- carry permit in one State to carry his gun in every State--even if the person would be disqualified from getting a permit in other States because of criminal convictions, inadequate training, or other factors. Congress should think carefully about how proposals like this would mix with ``stand your ground'' laws. Today we have before us a distinguished lineup of witnesses who will talk about the impact of ``stand your ground'' laws on public safety, civil rights, and American families, and ways that we should work to fix them. I look forward to their testimony. [The prepared statement of Senator Durbin appears as a submission for the record.] I now recognize the Ranking Republican Member, Senator Cruz. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the witnesses who have come here this morning. Thank you to everyone who has come to join this hearing on a very important topic. I would like to talk about three different issues concerning ``stand your ground'' legislation. The first is the difference between serious efforts to stop violent crime and efforts to advance a political agenda. I have spent much of my adult life working in law enforcement and emphatically agree that law enforcement should be vigorous going after violent crime, protecting the innocent, protecting those who are preyed upon by violent criminals. Indeed, one of my most significant criticisms of this administration's enforcement of justice is that they have not made prosecuting gun crimes a priority. In 2010, over 48,000 fugitives, felons, and other prohibited purchasers attempted to illegally purchase a firearm, and yet out of over 48,000, this administration prosecuted only 44 of them. In my view, that is utterly indefensible. If you have felons and fugitives attempting to purchase illegal firearms, we should be going after, investigating, and prosecuting each of those cases. Let me reiterate. Out of over 48,000, this Justice Department prosecuted only 44. Likewise, the prosecution of violent gun crimes has dropped significantly from a high of over 11,000 in 2004 to a low in 2012 of 7,774, which is a 29-percent decline. If we were to put action to all of the rhetoric given about stopping violent crime, we would again put priorities to prosecuting those who commit crimes with guns. Unfortunately, there are many in Washington who seem more driven by advancing a political agenda than actually putting in place common-sense steps to stop violent crime. That leads to the second point I want to make, which is that in our Federalist system, criminal law is primarily given to the States to enforce, and State self-defense law is not in our constitutional system the responsibility of the Federal Government. The Federal Government does not have the jurisdiction, does not have the constitutional authority to determine what the substantive criminal law should be in each of our 50 States. And, indeed, it is quite fitting with the Founders' design that each of those 50 States would make different judgments, different decisions based on the values and mores of their citizens. And so that does raise the question as to the purpose of this hearing. If it is not within Congress' jurisdiction to legislate substantive State criminal law, it raises whether there may perhaps be a broader political agenda behind the hearing instead. The third point I would make is that self-defense is a bedrock liberty of every American, and I would note this is not a new concept. Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller stated, ``The inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right.'' Now, some who get their news from the modern news media may believe that was a new creation of the modern Court. I would note that that idea has been around from the founding of this Nation. Indeed, Justice Harlan for a unanimous Supreme Court in 1895 stated the following: ``He was not obliged to retreat, nor to consider whether he could safely retreat, but was entitled to stand his ground, and meet any attack upon him with a deadly weapon, in such a way and with such force as, under all the circumstances, he, at the moment, honestly believed, and had reasonable grounds to believe, were necessary to save his own life, or to protect himself from great bodily injury.'' The Declaration of Independence begins with the right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness given by our Creator to each of us. And if an individual is confronted by a violent aggressor, the right of self-defense is an inherent right in each of us. And the notion that critics of these laws put forth that if you are attacked on the street by a violent attacker, you are obliged to turn and run rather than to defend yourself is a notion that is contrary to hundreds of years of our jurisprudence and to the rights that protect all of us. I would note also that the Chairman suggested a racial disparity. Look, the problem of violent crime in this country is enormous, and tragically, minority communities bear much of the cost of violent crime. Minorities find themselves at times aggressors, but often victims of violent crime. And I would note, in Florida, the data show that African American defendants have availed themselves of the ``stand your ground'' defense more frequently than have Anglo defendants. According to press reports, 55 percent of African American defendants have successfully invoked the ``stand your ground'' defense in prosecutions compared to a 53-percent rate in the Anglo population. This is not about politicking. This is not about inflaming racial tensions, although some might try to use it to do that. This is about the right of everyone to protect themselves, to protect their family. And I will tell you, given a choice in a confrontation between a violent aggressor attacking an innocent civilian, I for one will always, always, always stand with the innocent civilian. Now, we have a system of justice to determine if that is the facts in any particular circumstance. But, notably, the ``stand your ground'' defense only applies when it is a violent aggressor attacking an innocent defender. If it is not, the defense does not apply. So this is a rule that only applies to protect innocent victims from violent aggressors, and I find the notion that we say if you and your family are attacked on the public street, you do not have the right to defend yourself, I find that an astonishing proposition and one that I certainly hope Members of the U.S. Senate will not advocate. Chairman Durbin. We will turn to our first witness panel. I want to welcome Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, Congressman Luis GutieE1rrez, and Congressman Louie Gohmert. Thank you for being here. You will each have five minutes to make a statement, and if you have a written statement, we will include it in the record. The first person to speak is Congresswoman Marcia Fudge. She represents the 11th Congressional District of Ohio, currently serving her third term. In 2012, Congresswoman Fudge was unanimously elected by her colleagues and serves as the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in the 113th Congress. She is a Member of the House Committee on Agriculture, where she is Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Department Operations Oversight, and the Committee on Education and Workforce. Congresswoman Fudge, thank you for being here today, and please proceed. STATEMENT OF HON. MARCIA L. FUDGE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Representative Fudge. Thank you very much, and good morning. Thank you, Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Cruz. I would just say that it is interesting that the Ranking Member believes in State rights when it favors his position. You cannot have it both ways. Either the Justice Department is over prosecuting persons who buy guns illegally in States, and if they are, then they should also be over ``stand your ground'' laws. I would like to focus on three issues that have serious implications to the public safety of our country: ``stand your ground'' laws, concealed-carry laws, and racial profiling. On February 26, 2012, a young man lost his life, in my opinion, due to racial profiling. Earlier this year, Trayvon Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, escaped the grip of justice because of Florida's concealed-carry and ``stand your ground'' laws. The three issues that I highlight today all manifest themselves in the senseless death of too many young men, including Jordan Davis, who was killed for playing music too loud in his car. Trayvon and Jordan did not ask to be martyrs. The American legal system made them martyrs. I thank Sybrina Fulton and Lucia McBath for being here today. Your strength is inspiring. I fully understand the right to defend oneself from violence as an established principle in our legal system. However, ``stand your ground'' laws eliminate all responsibility to retreat and peacefully end an incident. These laws permit and, quite frankly, encourage individuals to use deadly force even in situations where lesser or no physical force would be appropriate. At the urging of ALEC and the NRA, the first ``stand your ground'' law was enacted in Florida in 2005. Since then, 22 other States have enacted similar laws. The NRA and ALEC actively lobbied States to lower the personal liability and social responsibility for those who carry firearms. Ultimately, this effort fosters a Wild West environment in our communities where individuals play the role of judge, jury, and executioner. In my home State of Ohio, House bill 203 would expand the concealed-carry law to permit the use of lethal force wherever an individual is legally permitted to be while removing the duty to retreat. This change to current law would bring Ohio in line with other ``stand your ground'' States. Proponents of ``stand your ground'' laws often allege that these laws deter crime. However, the opposite is true. According to a study by the University of Texas A&M, States with ``stand your ground'' laws have seen an eight percent increase in homicides. The enforcement of ``stand your ground'' laws too often relies on the decisions of those with cultural biases on whether a person's life is in danger. Not surprisingly, these decisions have had a disparate impact on African Americans. The Urban Institute's Justice Policy Center found that in ``stand your ground'' States, 35.9 percent of shootings involving a white shooter and a black victim are found to be justified. Only 3.4 percent of cases involving a black shooter and a white victim are considered justifiable self-defense. These numbers should make all of us uncomfortable, Mr. Chairman. Racial profiling continues to make communities of innocent individuals fear a system designed to protect them. Under New York's unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policy, more than 90 percent of all those stopped by police were either black or Latino, even though these groups only make up 52 percent of the city's population. Given the underlying taint of racial profiling in both our culture and criminal justice system, it is troubling to see more States trend toward enacting ``stand your ground'' laws. The Center for American Progress' report, ``License to Kill,'' shows the intersection between ``stand your ground'' laws and weak State gun permitting laws. While every State has concealed-carry laws, they differ on eligibility requirements. There must be a strong, uniform standard to allow an individual to carry a deadly weapon. Weak concealed-carry standards combined with ``stand your ground'' laws and racial profiling are a recipe for danger. We in Congress must continue to work with the Department of Justice to monitor and evaluate the impact of these three issues. And until these unjust and inherently biased laws are repealed, we have a responsibility to advocate and to educate. Our work will not be complete until we ensure that no one has to live with the fear of death based on his race or his age or a death that is justified under ``stand your ground'' laws. I look forward to the day when every American can live knowing that the arc of justice bends toward fair and unbiased laws. I yield back. Chairman Durbin. Thank you, Congresswoman. Next up is my colleague, Congressman Luis Gutieerrez, from Illinois. He is now in his 11th term representing the Illinois Fourth Congressional District, Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Immigration Task Force, and leader in an effort to pursue comprehensive immigration reform. In addition, he serves on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Congressman Gutieerrez, thank you for joining us today. STATEMENT OF HON. LUIS V. GUTIEERREZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Representative Gutieerrez. Thank you, Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Cruz. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this extremely important issue. I extend my condolences to the families who lost loved ones. Ms. Fulton and Ms. McBath, I am deeply sorry for your loss, and I appreciate your presence here today. And as one dad to another, I say to Mr. Martin that I, too, feel your pain, and thank you for being here. As a parent, I was shocked by the death of Trayvon Martin, and the fact that no one was even arrested after it happened, an unarmed teenager was pursued by an armed adult in the neighborhood where he was staying, shot to death and nobody was convicted of a crime. I respect the verdict and the judicial process, but I have deep concerns about the expansion of self-defense laws, the proliferation of guns, the weakening of gun laws, and how this affects public safety. The case of Trayvon Martin, like the Sandy Hook massacre, should have sparked a response from our Nation's lawmakers. Mr. Chairman, I, too, requested hearings on this matter as a Member of the House Judiciary Committee but received no response from the Chairman. Examining the ``stand your ground'' laws and whether they make our communities safer or less safe is critically important as part of a larger examination of the impact of gun violence on America. Sadly, we lose a classroom full of kids every day to gun violence across this country, and there have been no hearings in the House. So, Senator Durbin, I applaud you for your leadership and for holding this hearing. The fundamental problem is Americans are so afraid of other Americans that they feel they must arm themselves. The gun lobbyists are pursuing to reshape our laws to make this practice more socially and legally acceptable. Special interests are relaxing our laws, resulting in an escalation of the deadliness of these confrontations. I have never believed that allowing more guns will mean less gun violence. We must confront the deadly combination of rampant fear of one another and easily available guns. We must examine ``shoot first'' or ``stand your ground'' laws in this context. In 22 States, ``stand your ground'' laws expand the use of deadly force outside your home to any place you have a legal right to be. We seem to have made it a decision that it is acceptable to use a weapon on another human, but have failed to have a serious conversation about under what circumstances. Under ``shoot first'' laws, a person is presumed to have a reasonable fear of death that justifies the use of deadly force in many places. In some States, there is also immunity from civil liability, criminal prosecution, and even arrest. I grew up in Chicago in a very different era. When scuffles broke out, it was up to us to protect ourselves. But no one had Glocks and no one had AR-15s back then. New concealed-carry laws and ``shoot first'' laws are a recipe for more dead sons and daughters. The GAO estimated last year that approximately eight million permits for concealed weapons were issued in the United States. Illinois has become the 50th State to allow concealed weapons. As a father, and as a grandfather of a 10-year-old, I strongly oppose proposals to allow national reciprocity for concealed weapon laws issued by States with fewer safeguards than those in my own State of Illinois where my grandson resides. For the safety of all of our loved ones, we must take every reasonable precaution to ensure that individuals who are violent or a public threat do not have easy access to weapons. That is why I have introduced legislation this year to ban cheap junk guns used disproportionately in the commission of crimes. But legislation is only part of the solution. In Chicago, we continue to develop strategies to reduce violence and target at-risk youth. Teaching our kids how to resolve conflicts without pulling a trigger makes more sense. Instead, the gun lobby is pursuing ``shoot first'' laws and claiming they deter crime. The truth is these laws increase murder rates. Researchers at Texas A&M found ``shoot first'' States have an eight percent increase in homicides relative to other States, translating to 600 additional parents, children, and friends killed every year. Moreover, ``shoot first'' laws exacerbate the mistrust of the police among minority communities. There is a widespread feeling in poor and working-class communities that the police are there to protect people from them, not to protect them from other people. That trust further deteriorates under ``shoot first'' laws when communities question whether racial stereotypes or biases will enter into a subjective determination that someone had a reasonable fear. When we allow people to take the law into their own hands, when police hesitate to make an arrest when a young person of color is killed, or if we turn cops into immigration agents, like the House Judiciary Committee's proposal in the SAFE Act, public safety suffers. Engaging in this dialogue is a critical first step. Congress should guide this discussion, carefully monitor the application of these laws, and watch out for racial disparities. I want to thank Senator Durbin for his leadership and for his service to Illinois and for the opportunity to testify. And last, Mr. Chairman, I would ask that the ``End `stand your ground' in Illinois'' editorial in the Chicago Sun-Times be entered into the record. Chairman Durbin. Without objection, it will be added to your testimony. Thank you, Congressman Gutieerrez. [The editorial appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Durbin. Our next witness is Congressman Louie Gohmert. He represents the First Congressional District of Texas. He is in his fifth term in the House. He is a Member of the House Judiciary Committee where he serves as Vice Chair on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security. He is also a Member of the Committee on Natural Resources. Congressman Gohmert, please proceed. STATEMENT OF HON. LOUIE GOHMERT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Representative Gohmert. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Cruz, Members of the Committee. I am before you as someone who has a heavy heart for every victim of crime, especially violent crime. I come before you today as someone who has been involved in successfully prosecuting murder. I have defended a man who happened to be African American of murder in which he was acquitted using self-defense, having killed a naked man. I have successfully appealed appropriately and have gotten a capital murder conviction reversed in which the defendant happened to be African American. I have presided over many murder trials as a judge. As a chief justice, I have reviewed murder trials on appeal. So I am somewhat familiar with the process involved with murder and assault trials. Though I have won an award for a Law Review article I wrote, I have won Baylor Law School's moot court competition, won Best Brief Award along with others, perhaps the highest commendation I have ever had came from now-Senator Ed Markey, who, after a House hearing, approached me and said he wanted to pay me a compliment, that if he were ever arrested, he wanted me to defend him. And he said that was a compliment, and I took it as such. Now, regarding the issue of self-defense, as my friend Senator Cruz pointed out, it was in 1895, Beard v. United States, the Court said, Justice Harlan, the person ``was not obliged to retreat, nor to consider whether he could safely retreat, but was entitled to stand his ground . . . .'' This concept has been around for a long time. Some feel that there should be a duty to retreat before deadly force can be utilized for self-protection. But some have found that, without a duty to retreat, there are fewer assaultive crimes with due deference to Texas A&M. In most places, a deadly weapon does not necessarily have to be present if the victim is in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily harm, worded in different ways. That idea of being able to stand one's ground without first retreating has been combined as part of the law of self-defense in at least 22 States. It might also be noted that these 22 are not necessarily States in which runaway murder rates abound, as they do in some locations where the self-defense is more limited or where gun control laws are most extreme, as in Washington, DC, or Chicago, Illinois. Florida and other States have used their right to be the source of police powers, which was secured to them under the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, because those powers were not delegated to the Federal Government and were, therefore, reserved to the States and the people. That is why States have the right to have their own penal codes, to enact their own laws of self-defense, which laws get tweaked from time to time as necessary. In some States, the doctrine of protecting one's home affords more protection to the homeowner than in other States. In some States, one may stand his ground without retreating wherever he is lawfully located. However, unless the Uniform Code of Military Justice or other federal nexus is clearly present, all of this is up to the State legislatures to make these determinations as they see fit for their citizens. Without a federal nexus, such laws are up to the individual States. The idea that States are less intelligent or less able to discern their citizens' needs is a mistake of federal proportions. Only a Congress that has authorized the spending of over 150 percent more than it brings in would have the nerve to tell State governments that balance their budget every year that the State does not know how to properly govern their people. With only a few exceptions, most States are doing quite well with legislating in the area of criminal law without our interference. It is only the Federal Government that has an estimated 5,000 or so criminal laws that have overcriminalized this country. Hopefully when I am here again for a hearing, we can fervently work toward eliminating or correcting the thousands of federal laws that have sometimes put people behind bars for things that most Americans have no clue would be against the criminal law. So, Senators, I humbly implore you, let us leave State criminal law to the consideration of the State legislatures, though we in Congress would probably be well served to take advice from the States that are still solvent. Thank you. Chairman Durbin. Thank you, Congressman Gohmert, and I want to thank your colleagues, Congressman Gutierrez and Congresswoman Fudge, for their testimony as well. We appreciate your being here today, and we are going to proceed to the second panel as you depart. Thank you again. Chairman Durbin. I am sorry. If I can ask you all please to stand, it is customary to administer the oath before this Committee. If you would please raise your right hand. Do you affirm that the testimony you are about to give before the Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Ms. Fulton. I do. Mr. Sullivan. I do. Mr. LaBahn. I do. Mr. Shapiro. I do. Mr. Lott. I do. Ms. McBath. I do. Chairman Durbin. Thank you. Let the record reflect that the witnesses, all witnesses on the second panel, answered in the affirmative. Each witness will be given five minutes for an opening statement. Of course, any written statement they would like to submit for the record will be admitted without objection. Our first witness is Sybrina Fulton. Ms. Fulton is the mother of Trayvon Martin. Her son was shot and killed at the age of 17 on the night of February 26, 2012, in Sanford, Florida. Sybrina and Trayvon's father, Tracy, have co-founded the Trayvon Martin Foundation to create awareness of how violent crime impacts the families of victims and to provide support and advocacy for those victims. Ms. Fulton is a graduate of Florida Memorial University. Thank you so much for coming here today, Ms. Fulton, and please proceed with your testimony. STATEMENT OF SYBRINA FULTON, MIAMI, FLORIDA Ms. Fulton. Thank you so much for just taking the time to listen to what not only I have to say but the rest of the people that are testifying as well. By nature, I am a mother of two boys, and I still support both my sons. Although Trayvon is not with us, it is very important that I try to make a change for not only my older son, Jahvaris, which is still here on Earth, but also Trayvon. It is unfortunate what has happened with Trayvon, and that is why I feel like it is so important for me to be here so that you all can at least put a face with what has happened with this tragedy. Trayvon had recently turned 17 years old. He had only been 17 for three weeks. We celebrated his 17th birthday on February 5, and he was murdered on February 26. So he had only been 17 for three weeks. It is very hurtful to know that Trayvon was only simply going to the store to get snacks, nothing more, nothing less. It is important to keep that in mind because teenagers like to be independent at times, and he was simply going to get a drink and some candy. That tells me right there his mentality. That tells me that he was not going to get cigarettes or bullets or condoms or other items of that nature. He was going to get a drink and candy. Trayvon was minding his own business. He was not looking for any type of trouble. He was not committing any crime. And that is important to remember that the things that surround the tragedy that happened are most important. At the time that this happened to him, he was on a telephone call with a young lady from Miami. That shows his mentality. That shows that he was not looking for trouble. He was not the criminal that some people have tried to make him out to be. He was not the criminal that the person who shot and killed him thought that he was. He was simply on the cell phone talking to a young lady in Miami, with candy and a drink. As I think about this as a mother and I think about how many kids walk to the store and how many kids now feel that they cannot be safe in their own community, I think about what kind of message we are sending as parents, as lawmakers, as elected officials, even as grandparents and aunts and uncles. What kind of message are we sending if our kids--because, remember, these are our kids in our communities--do not feel safe, do not feel safe simply walking to the store to get candy and a drink? So I just wanted to come here to talk to you for a moment to let you know how important it is that we amend this ``stand your ground'' because it did not--certainly did not--work in my case. The person that shot and killed my son is walking the streets today. And this law does not work. We need to seriously take a look at this law. We need to seriously speak with the State attorney's office, the police departments, more attorneys. We need to do something about this law when our kids cannot feel safe in their own community. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Fulton appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Durbin. Ms. Fulton, we are sorry for your loss, and thank you for your courage in coming today, as well as to Trayvon's father. Thank you very much. Our next witness is Professor Ronald Sullivan. He is a clinical professor of law at Harvard Law School where he serves as faculty director of the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute and the Harvard Trial Advocacy Workshop. He previously taught at Yale Law School and served as director of the Public Defender Services in the District of Columbia. He received his B.A. from Morehouse College and his law degree from Harvard. Professor Sullivan, thanks for being here, and please proceed. STATEMENT OF RONALD S. SULLIVAN, JR., CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF LAW, DIRECTOR, CRIMINAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE, AND DIRECTOR, TRIAL ADVOCACY WORKSHOP, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS Mr. Sullivan. Thank you very much. Good morning, Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Cruz and Members of the Committee. Let me also join the Chair and others in sharing and offering my condolences for your loss, Ms. Fulton. In order to properly understand ``stand your ground'' laws, we must first appreciate the broader context in which they exist. First and most important, it is axiomatic that sanctity of human life is a central and animating value in our legal system. This, I trust, is not a particularly controversial claim. Dating back to our law's Judeo-Christian origins, interpreters and courts alike have recognized that human life is sacred, and those who would extinguish human life carry a heavy burden in order to justify such an act. ``Stand your ground'' laws, like all self-defense laws, require this heightened showing of necessity. The particular version of ``stand your ground'' laws which began with Florida's 2005 law differs drastically from other ``stand your ground'' laws and from the common law of self-defense in three important respects. First, these laws remove the common law duty to retreat. This has the result of emboldening individuals to escalate confrontation as opposed to an alternative rule which would de- escalate confrontation. And the duty to retreat implies a duty to safely retreat. Second, these laws shift the legal presumption regarding reasonableness of one's fear. Under a Florida-type law, the actor is presumed to be reasonably in fear of imminent death if he is in his home or automobile, and this presumption abrogates the need for someone who is responsible for a homicide to affirmatively demonstrate the necessity of taking another human life. Third, these laws provide immunity from criminal arrest and civil liability. This has the unintended effect of encouraging the very sort of vigilantism that normal and ordinary law prevents. In my written testimony, I discuss all of these issues at length. I also analyze at length the extant empirical evidence, and I conclude that the data is not sufficiently robust to make a causal claim in either direction. So to say that ``stand your ground'' laws increase or decrease the incidence of crime, I think there are correlations there. I have not found strong causal evidence. But the weight of the evidence strongly points to the conclusion that ``stand your ground'' has little, if any, impact on homicide reduction, and the promulgation of these laws appears to correlate with an increase in certain types of violent crimes. Now, time does not permit me here to go into more detail, but I will make some observations about the Trayvon Martin case. Mr. Zimmerman's acquittal was made possible because Florida's ``stand your ground'' laws and its concealed weapons laws conspired to create the perfect background conditions for his exoneration. These laws permitted Mr. Zimmerman to carry a loaded firearm, to disregard the clear directive of a 911 dispatcher, to follow and pursue Trayvon, and then stand his ground when young Trayvon reasonably sought to defend himself-- and all because, I strongly suspect, that Mr. Zimmerman could not apprehend any lawful reason for a young black male to be walking through his middle-class neighborhood. To Mr. Zimmerman, Martin's blackness likely served as a crude proxy for criminality. Now, this unfortunate outcome sends a twofold message. First, it tells Floridians that they can incorrectly profile young black children, kill them, and be protected by ``stand your ground'' laws. But, second, this decision sends an even more ominous message to young black children. So I consider myself fortunate to live in a jurisdiction that does not have ``stand your ground'' laws. But what if it did? I have an African American son who is just shy of his 13th birthday, whose name ironically is Trey. What advice would I give him? I regret the only responsible advice, if I lived in a ``stand your ground'' jurisdiction, would be that if he ever felt seriously threatened by a stranger, then he would have to use all reasonable force, up to and including legal force, in order to protect himself, because I would rather my Trey be alive and able to argue that he stood his ground than dead and portrayed by lawyers, the media, and, present company excluded, politicians as some stereotypical black male criminal. This is not a desirable America for anyone, and I do not want my son growing up in such an America. I respectfully suggest that States pass laws that permit police to police and citizens to go about the business of building communities. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Sullivan appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Durbin. Thank you, Professor Sullivan. Our next witness is David LaBahn. Mr. LaBahn is the president and CEO of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, a national association representing elected deputy and assistant prosecutors. Previously he was director of the American Prosecutors Research Institute and executive director of the California District Attorneys Association. He was also a deputy district attorney in Orange and Humboldt counties in California. He is a graduate of Cal State Fullerton and received his J.D. from Western State University. Mr. LaBahn, please proceed. STATEMENT OF DAVID LABAHN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ASSOCIATION OF PROSECUTING ATTORNEYS, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. LaBahn. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cruz, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. My name is David LaBahn. I am the president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, a private nonprofit whose mission is to support and enhance the effectiveness of prosecutors in their efforts to create safer communities. APA is the only national organization to represent and include appointed and elected prosecutors, as well as their deputies and assistants. On behalf of APA, I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the issues surrounding this vast expansion of self-defense referred to as ``stand your ground.'' As prosecutors, we seek to do justice for victims and hold offenders accountable for their actions, especially in cases where a life has been violently ended whether by firearm or other deadly means. Since 2009, APA has tracked the legislative progression of ``stand your ground'' and assisted prosecutors who have been working to enforce these expansive new laws. I have attached to my testimony our Statement of Principles regarding ``stand your ground'' laws. These laws have raised a number of troubling and dangerous concerns. Prosecutors and their professional associations have overwhelmingly opposed ``stand your ground'' laws when they were in their respective legislatures. The concerns expressed include the limitation or even elimination of prosecutors' ability to hold violent criminals accountable for their acts. However, even with this opposition, many States have passed ``stand your ground'' laws. Many of these laws include provisions that diminish or eliminate the common law ``duty to retreat,'' change the burden of proof regarding reasonableness to a presumption, and provide civil and criminal immunity. By expanding the realm in which violent acts can be committed with the justification of self-defense, ``stand your ground'' laws have negatively affected public safety and undermined prosecutorial and law enforcement efforts to keep communities safe. They have undermined standard police procedures, prevented law enforcement from arresting and detaining criminals, stymied prosecutors, deterring them from prosecuting people who claim self-defense even while killing someone in the course of unlawful activity. In some States, courts have interpreted the law to create a new procedural hurdle in the form of immunity hearings, which effectively transfer the role of the jury over to judge. Moreover, because these laws are unclear, there has been inconsistent application throughout the States and even within respective States. Prosecutors, judges, police officers, and ordinary citizens have been left to guess what behavior is legal and what is criminal. Even with the best efforts to implement these broad measures, defendants, victims' families and friends, investigators, prosecutors, defense attorneys, trial courts, and appellate courts have been forced into a case-by-case analysis with no legal certainty as to what they can expect once a life has been taken. ``Stand your ground'' laws provide safe harbors for criminals and prevent prosecutors from bringing cases against those who claim self-defense after unnecessarily killing others. For example, in a February 2008 Florida case, a drug dealer by the name of Tavarious China Smith killed two men in two separate incidents, the first drug-related, the second over retaliation. Though he was engaged in unlawful activity in both instances, prosecutors had to conclude that both homicides were justified under Florida's ``stand your ground'' law. Unfortunately, this example is not an anomaly. A recent study concluded that a majority of defendants shielded by ``stand your ground'' had arrest records prior to the homicide at issue.``Stand your ground'' expansion began in Florida in 2005. It is our position that common law sufficiently protected people's rights to defend themselves, their homes, and others. The proper use of prosecutorial discretion ensured that lawful acts of self-defense were not prosecuted, and I have not seen evidence to the contrary. After reviewing the legislative history of the Florida provision, the very case used to justify this broad measure involved no arrest or prosecution. The law enforcement community responded properly to the shooting, and the homeowner was never arrested or charged in his lawful exercise of self-defense. Because the provisions of ``stand your ground'' laws vary from State to State, I will attempt to summarize some of the provisions which have caused prosecutors difficulty in uniformly enforcing the law. First, the meaning of ``unlawful activity'' needs to be clarified. Many States have extended ``stand your ground'' protection to people who are in a place where they have a right to be and who are not engaged in an unlawful activity. Can a drug dealer defend his open-air drug market? If an individual is a felon, does he have a right to kill another with a firearm? Second, immunity is rarely granted in criminal law, with the few exceptions existing in order to encourage cooperation with law enforcement and the judicial system. The legislatures should remove the immunity provisions and clarify that self- defense is an affirmative defense. Third, the replacement of presumptions with inferences will eliminate many of the dangerous effects. This coupled with an objective rather than a subjective standard will improve accountability while protecting the right of self-defense. Fourth, the statutes should be amended to prevent an initial aggressor from claiming self-defense. Some laws allow a person to attack another with deadly force and later use ``stand your ground'' to justify killing the person he or she attacked if that person responds with like force and the initial aggressor cannot escape. Finally, we recommend that the law be limited so that ``stand your ground'' cannot be raised when the victim is a law enforcement officer, regardless of actual knowledge. Statutes should be amended to read that ``stand your ground'' should not be applicable against a law enforcement officer while acting within the course and scope of their duties. Taken together, I believe these reforms to the various ``stand your ground'' laws will help minimize their detrimental effects and restore the ability of investigators and prosecutors to fully enforce the law and promote public safety, while continuing to respect the rights of law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their families. Thank you, Chairman, for holding this hearing, and as I have been sitting here, I do want to reflect the decision to take a life is one of the most solemn decisions any person can ever raise or be faced with. It should not be taken lightly. Policies should not encourage one to violently take the life of another. Once that event occurs, and having prosecuted cases and dealing with the victim's family here, both lives are forever changed--the individual who chooses to make the decision to take a life as well as the victim's family. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. LaBahn appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Durbin. Thanks, Mr. LaBahn. Our next witness is Ilya Shapiro. He is a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute. Previously he was special assistant/advisor to the Multi-National Force in Iraq on rule-of-law issues and was an attorney in private practice at Patton Boggs. Mr. Shapiro received an undergraduate degree from Princeton, a master's from the London School of Economics, and a law degree from the University of Chicago Law School. He clerked for Judge Grady Jolly of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Shapiro, please proceed. STATEMENT OF ILYA SHAPIRO, SENIOR FELLOW IN CONSTITUTIONAL STUDIES, CATO INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. Shapiro. Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to discuss the right to armed self-defense. It is most appropriate that this hearing was originally scheduled for September 17th, marking the anniversary of the Constitution's signing. On that day, public schools have to teach about our founding document. My organization, Cato, which thankfully is not publicly funded, celebrates Constitution Day by releasing our ``Supreme Court Review.'' In reality, however, every day is Constitution Day, so please excuse me if I have to leave early to travel to the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia to discuss the constitutional issues attending the debt ceiling debate. Now, ``stand your ground'' is tremendously misunderstood. All it does is allow people to defend themselves without having a so-called duty to retreat. That concept has been part of U.S. law for over 150 years. About 31 States, depending how you count, now have some type of ``stand your ground'' doctrine, the vast majority in common law before legislators took any action. Some, like California and Virginia, maintain it without any legislation still. Of the 15 States that have passed ``stand your ground'' since 2005, a majority had Democratic Governors, including Jennifer Granholm, Janet Napolitano, and Kathleen Sebelius. Louisiana and West Virginia passed them with Democratic control of both Houses. Even Florida's supposedly controversial law passed the State Senate unanimously and split Democrats in the House. When Illinois strengthened its longstanding law in 2004, State Senator Barack Obama cosponsored the bill that was then unanimously approved. Conversely, many so-called red States impose a duty to retreat, and even in more restrictive States, courts have held that retreat is not required when preventing serious crime. Indeed, it's a universal principle that a person can use force when she reasonably believes it necessary to defend against an imminent use of unlawful force. Where there is no duty to retreat, as in most States, she is further justified in using deadly force if she reasonably believes it necessary to prevent death or grave bodily harm. The Florida law is no different. It's not an easy defense to assert, and it certainly doesn't mean that you can shoot first and ask questions later. These laws are not a license to be a vigilante or behave recklessly. They just protect law-abiding citizens from having to leave a place where they're allowed to be. That's why this debate isn't new. In ancient Britain, when the deadliest weapons were swords, a duty to retreat greatly reduced blood feuds. British law reflects a ``deference to the constabulary,'' by which the King owed a duty of protection to his subjects. That's obviously not part of our tradition. Despite what gun prohibitionists claim, the no-retreat rule has deep roots in American law. At the Supreme Court, it dates to the unanimous 1895 case of Beard v. United States, which Senator Cruz quoted. In places with a duty to retreat, crime victims can be imprisoned just for defending themselves. That's controversial. A mugger cannot have your wallet, but he can make you leave a public place? Among those harmed by the duty to retreat are domestic violence victims who turn on their assailants. Feminists thus support ``stand your ground'' and point out that ``you could have run away'' may not work when faced with a stalker. ``Stand your ground'' laws are thus designed to protect law-abiding citizens. That's how we have the Castle Doctrine, which essentially all States recognize, most extending the doctrine to public spaces as well. It's bad enough for an innocent person to find herself threatened by a criminal, but to then have to worry about whether she can retreat lest she face lawsuits is too much to ask. As the progressive Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in the 1921 case of Brown v. United States, ``detached reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife.'' Nearly a century later, we shouldn't demand more of crime victims. Of course, any self-defense rule bears the potential for injustice. For example, in a two-person altercation, one may be dead and the other dubiously claim self-defense. These cases, like Trayvon Martin's, implicate the self-defense justification generally. If George Zimmerman was the aggressor, then he has no self-defense rights at all. If Trayvon attacked Zimmerman, then the only question is whether Zimmerman reasonably believed that he was in danger, not whether he could've retreated. And if Zimmerman provoked the confrontation, he lost the protections of the ``stand your ground'' law. In short, hard cases make skewed policy debates. This Committee is well familiar with that demagogic dynamic after Sandy Hook. While anti-gun lobbyists have used both that tragedy and Trayvon Martin to pitch all sorts of gun control laws, what they really target is the right to armed self- defense. With ``stand your ground'' laws, yes, prosecutors need to show evidence to counter claims of self-defense, not simply argue that the shooter should've retreated. For those who value due process, which should include historically mistreated minorities, that's a feature, not a bug. Finally, I should mention one episode that has contributed to the sensationalism surrounding this debate: the attempt to intimidate organizations with any ties to the American Legislative Exchange Council. Accordingly, I've submitted with this statement Chairman Durbin's letter to that effect and the response by Cato's president, John Allison. Thank you for having me. I welcome your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Shapiro appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Durbin. Thank you, Mr. Shapiro. Our next witness is John Lott. Mr. Lott is the president of a newly formed organization, the Crime Prevention Research Center. He previously served in research or a teaching position at the University of Chicago and Yale, among other schools. He was the chief economist at the U.S. Sentencing Commission from 1988 to 1990. He is currently a weekly columnist and contributor for FoxNews.com. He received his Ph.D. in economics from UCLA. Mr. Lott, please proceed. STATEMENT OF JOHN R. LOTT, JR., PH.D., PRESIDENT, CRIME PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER, SWARTHMORE, PENNSYLVANIA Mr. Lott. Thank you very much, Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Cruz and other distinguished Members. ``Stand Your Ground'' laws help people to be able to defend themselves. It is the people who are most likely to be victims of violent crime, primarily poor blacks, who benefit the most from having the option to be able to protect themselves. What has been lost in part of this discussion so far is the reason why States have adopted these laws. Requiring people to retreat as far as possible creates confusion, creates doubt, and can make it more difficult for people to be able to go and defend themselves. In Florida, blacks make up about 16 percent of the population, but they account for 31 percent of the State's defendants invoking ``stand your ground'' laws. Black defendants who invoke this statute to justify their actions are actually acquitted almost eight percentage points more often than whites. The Tampa Bay Tribune has put together very detailed data on ``stand your ground'' cases. Up through July 24th of this year from the beginning of 2006, the newspaper had collected 112 cases. The information that they had that often constitutes their ``shocking'' is that 72 percent of those who killed a black person faced no penalty compared to 59 percent of those who killed a white person; 80 percent of those who killed Hispanics were also not convicted. What one needs to remember, however, in this is that the vast majority of these crimes are within race. So, for example, 90 percent of blacks who were killed in ``stand your ground'' cases--who invoked ``stand your ground'' were killed by other blacks. In the case of whites, it was 85 percent. In the case of Hispanics, it was 100 percent. The basic point is that if you are going to concentrate on the fact that relatively few people who kill blacks are going to be convicted using ``stand your ground'' defenses, you have to realize that almost all those people who are not being convicted are blacks. Sixty-nine percent of blacks who raised the ``stand your ground'' defense were not convicted. That compares to a little bit less than 62 percent for whites. Eighty percent of Hispanics who raised the ``stand your ground'' defense are not convicted. If blacks are supposedly being discriminated against because their killers so often are not facing any penalty, wouldn't it also follow that blacks are being discriminated in favor of when blacks who claim self- defense under the ``stand your ground'' law are convicted at much lower rates than other racial groups? The problem also is not all these cases are the same. Blacks killed in confrontations were 13 percentage points more likely to be armed than whites. By a 43- to 16-percent margin, blacks killed--again, killed by other blacks--were also more often in the process of committing another crime. They also were involved in cases where it was much more likely to have a witness present. If you go and run regressions where you try to account for all the factors that are brought up in the Tampa Bay Tribune data set, what you find is that white defendants are more likely to be convicted than black defendants, and people invoking ``stand your ground'' laws who kill blacks were also more likely to be convicted than those who killed whites. What you find when you look at it--and fortunately this is the case--the people who initiated the confrontation were more like to be convicted. And when there were eyewitnesses, they were less likely to be convicted. Armed individuals and when more than one person was killed also were much more likely to result in convictions. The Urban Institute report that was brought up earlier, I think, actually shows the opposite of what has been quoted here. One of the important things just to mention: John Roman, who wrote this, noted, ``Stand Your Ground laws appear to exacerbate''--well, he said they appear to exacerbate racial differences, but he acknowledges his data lacks details available in the Tampa Bay Tribune data: ``The data here cannot completely address this problem because the setting of the incident cannot be observed.'' And if you go through his paper, what you find, he has no data, no information on whether an eyewitness saw the confrontation, no data on whether there was physical evidence. He has no evidence on a whole range of things in order to try to factor those into account. The big thing, if you look at his study, the central finding is to look at Table 3, and what you find is that when blacks are under ``stand your ground'' laws, their situation in terms of conviction rates actually fall. If you look at the Texas A&M study that was mentioned, they do not account for any other gun control laws. If you are going to look at ``stand your ground'' laws, whether you have right to carry, the number of people who have permits is going to be important. And when you account for those things, the results disappear. If you are talking about Castle Doctrines, whether people are able to get quick access to guns is going to be important. And, again, nothing about gun law or State storage laws are accounted for in those studies, and when you do that, the results also disappear. [The prepared statement of Mr. Lott follows:] Chairman Durbin. Thank you, Mr. Lott. Our final witness is Lucia McBath. Ms. McBath is the mother of Jordan Russell Davis, who was shot and killed on November 23, 2012, at a gas station in Jacksonville, Florida. Ms. McBath and Jordan's father, Ron, have become advocates for reducing gun violence. Ms. McBath is the national spokesperson for an organization known as ``Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.'' She recently founded the Walk with Jordan Scholarship Foundation, providing assistance for graduating high school students. Ms. McBath is a graduate of Virginia State University, and before you say a word, I would like to thank all the members of the panel for their patience in the rescheduling of this hearing. We had a chance to meet when it was previously scheduled, and I am glad we did have those moments together. So please proceed with your testimony. STATEMENT OF LUCIA HOLMAN MCBATH, ATLANTA, GEORGIA Ms. McBath. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Durbin and honored Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Lucia Holman McBath, and I thank you for the opportunity to speak before this great institution today. I was raised in a family steeped in justice and confident in the triumphant goodness of humanity. My mother was a registered nurse, and my father, who served in the U.S. Army Dental Corps, was also, for over 20 years, president of the NAACP for the State of Illinois. He worked actively with President Lyndon Baines Johnson in the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If he could see me here today, testifying in front of the U.S. Senate, he would be beaming with pride and amazed at how far his daughter had come--until he came to understand what brought me here. I appear before you because my son Jordan was shot and killed last November while sitting in the back seat of a friend's car listening to loud music. The man who killed him opened fire on four unarmed teenagers even as they tried to move out of harm's way. That man was empowered by the ``stand your ground'' statute. I am here to tell you there was no ground to stand. There was no threat. No one was trying to invade his home, his vehicle, nor threatened him or his family. There was a vociferous argument about music, during which the accused, Michael Dunn, did not feel he was treated with respect. ``You are not going to talk to me like that,'' he shouted as he sprayed the car that Jordan sat in with bullets, killing him instantly. When Jordan's friends tried to back the car away, Mr. Dunn aimed his handgun and fired off several more rounds; nine, total, pierced the car. There are any number of ways this interaction might have gone, but there was only one way it could have ended once a gun entered the equation. In Florida, over one million people carry concealed weapons. Additionally, 10,000 to 15,000 more Floridians are approved to carry guns in public every month--faster than any State in the Nation. Nationally, Florida has some of the loosest permitting requirements. Automobile glove boxes are becoming modern day ``gun boxes.'' In his glove box, Michael Dunn kept a 9mm semi-automatic gun along with two loaded magazines. Once he had unloaded his gun at my son and his teenaged friends, he immediately went back to his hotel, ordered a pizza, and slept. He left the scene and made no attempt to call police. He retreated, but only after he killed my son. The next morning, he was arrested two hours away. Those are hardly the actions and motives of someone who was quaking with fear. Some will tell you that the argument was about music, but I believe that it was about the availability of guns and the eagerness to hate. People like Mr. Dunn feel empowered to use their gun instead of their voice to reason with others. Now I face the very real possibility that my son's killer will walk free, hiding behind a statute that lets people claim a threat where there was none. This law declares open season on anyone that we do not trust for reasons that we do not even have to understand. They do not even have to be true. In essence, it allows any armed citizens to ``self-deputize'' themselves and establish their own definition of law and order. It lets one and all define their own criteria for right and wrong and how justice will be carried out. Even the Wild West had more stringent laws governing the taking of life than we have now. ``Stand your ground'' defies all reason. It goes against the sound system of justice established long ago on this very Hill. My son was named for the Jordan River. In the Bible, that river symbolized the crossing to freedom. Its waters marked the final steps to liberation and offered up the holy stream that baptized Jesus. Its name seemed a fitting choice for a boy born at the end of the 20th century--a time when black people in this country had finally come into their own. Jordan was named for a change in the tide, a decision to try harder and do better. He was my only child. He was raised with love and learning and a clear understanding of right and wrong. I have been without Jordan now since Thanksgiving weekend 2012, without him last Christmas and on his birthday in February. I never got to take his prom picture or see him graduate from high school. I can tell you all about him--about his easy smile, his first girlfriend, and his plans to join the Marines. I can tell you how he loved his dad's gumbo and how they both rooted for the New York Giants. But you can never really know my boy, because an angry man owned a gun, kept it close at hand, and chose to demonstrate unbridled hatred one balmy evening for reasons I will never understand. These laws empowered his prejudiced beliefs and subsequent rage over my son's own life, his liberty and pursuit of happiness. There will be no sense made of any of it unless I and the families of other victims speak out to assure that this kind of predatory violence ends. It was 50 years ago that my father shook hands with Eleanor Roosevelt. She assured him of the validity of his struggle and the promise of better times. She, as he did, believed that this Nation was righteous to the core; that we as a country would never stop striving to do better; and that was what made us better. Honorable men and women of the Senate, you can prove them right today. With your help and willingness to bring our laws back toward the true tenets of justice, you can lift this Nation from its internal battle in which guns rule over right. You have the power to restore hope to a Nation crying out for justice, and I pray that you hear the will of the Lord. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. McBath appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Durbin. Thank you, Ms. McBath. We will now turn to questions for the witnesses, and each Member of the Committee will have seven minutes. I will start. Ms. Fulton and Ms. McBath, thank you for your courage in coming here today. I find it hard to understand those who defend ``stand your ground'' by arguing that African Americans should celebrate these laws. The notion that somehow this is to the benefit of African Americans or minorities in this country just defies the stories that we have been told by both of you. Innocent children--children--killed in the name of self- defense, when in neither instance was there evidence of aggressive or violent conduct by these victims, these young men who were shot down. Professor Sullivan, you have heard these arguments made, two members of the panel and a Member here, about this notion that somehow African Americans should view this as a positive thing on ``stand your ground.'' What would you respond? Mr. Sullivan. Well, I would agree with your statement, Senator Durbin. It is not a positive thing for anyone where citizens of the United States are running around shooting each other. Whether the perpetrator is African American, whether the victim is African American, it really does not matter. We do not live in the Wild, Wild West era any longer. Private law enforcement has a deleterious effect on our country, and we should leave it to trained police officials to engage in this sort of behavior. Chairman Durbin. Mr. LaBahn, your testimony--I read it over last night and again this morning--and I was particularly moved by one section of it that I would like to repeat. You stated: ``By expanding the realm in which violent acts can be committed with the justification of self-defense, `stand your ground' laws have negatively affected public health and undermined prosecutorial and law enforcement efforts to keep communities safe.'' You then go on and talk about a specific case in February 2008, which you mention in your testimony: `` . . . a 29-year- old drug dealer named Tavarious China Smith killed two men in two separate incidents, the first drug-related, and the second over retaliation for the first. Though he was engaged in unlawful activity in both instances--selling drugs during the first shooting and using an illegal gun in the second-- prosecutors had to conclude that both homicides were justified under the Florida's ``stand your ground'' law. ``Unfortunately,'' you go on to say, ``this example is not an anomaly. A recent study concluded that a majority of defendants shielded by `stand your ground' laws had arrest records prior to the homicide at issue.'' Now, Mr. LaBahn, if we had called as a witness here a person representing the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys, maybe some people would have understood: ``Oh, I can see where they are going.'' But in your case, you represent the profession of those who prosecute criminals, and you are saying ``stand your ground'' laws are not working to the benefit and defense of America. Tell me why you come to that conclusion. Mr. LaBahn. Well, Senator, I think you gave that example, and I can give the Committee additional examples and even more recent cases, but I will start right away with your question about the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. On behalf of APA, we work closely with the defense bar, and this is one of the areas that the two of our groups, we diverge. Why? Because this is good for the defense. When I testified down in Florida, there was a defense lawyer that was on the Scott Commission. He clearly said this is good for the defendants. Chairman Durbin. Excuse me. You are saying the criminal defense lawyers were arguing that ``stand your ground'' laws were good for criminal defendants. Mr. LaBahn. Good for criminal defendants, that the role of the criminal defense attorney is to get their client off in the criminal action. However, the role of the prosecutor is to seek justice. So on behalf of the criminal defendants and defense lawyers, this is a good law. Look at the ambiguities that are here. Look at the specific examples. You talked about--here is a drug dealer in an open-air drug market. Now, unfortunately, at the time of the killing he was not selling. If he had been selling drugs, then it would be an unlawful activity. But he was just in a legal place he had a right to be, and he was not selling at that moment; therefore, he had a right to defend himself. The second piece, as I mentioned in my testimony, is a felon in possession. If someone is a convicted felon, they have no right to possess a firearm. Yet they can go ahead under ``stand your ground'' and use--especially by Florida decisions--use that firearm and be free and not be held accountable. These stories are unbelievable. In January 2012, another Florida case, the victim was stealing--now, again, the victim of the shooting did something wrong, no question about that. But in this situation, someone sees their car being burglarized. They go ahead, they chase--they yell at him, ``Get out of my car,'' in this Florida situation chased him down and knifed him to death. Never reported, never called 911, never said anything about it, and then when confronted, said, ``I was defending my property.'' The Texas example, November 2007: the Horn case that was broadly disseminated out to the country. A gentleman looks and sees his neighbor's house being burglarized, calls 911 to report it. 911 urged them, you know, ``Stay in your house. We will get him. We will take care of it.'' No. Instead, he goes ahead and shoots both of those two dead--and I believe they were juveniles--and then goes ahead and exercises ``stand your ground.'' And that went in front of the Harris County grand jury. The Harris County grand jury found that to be ``stand your ground.'' The movement here to create these presumptions and to give immunity--immunity--is crazy. That is not what it should be. It should be an affirmative defense, and that has caused these problems. So, yes, on behalf of prosecutors, these acts have done nothing but cause us difficulty. Chairman Durbin. It appears that this law is an invitation for confrontation, that historically--and I think Professor Sullivan raised this point--if you could safely retreat, that was your duty, except in your home. The Castle Doctrine, I believe, made a clear distinction when it came to your home in that circumstance. But the new laws, the ``stand your ground'' laws, are an invitation to confrontation and presumption of reasonableness and civil and criminal immunity. Now I understand that the State of Florida is debating about changing these laws. Could either of you testify about how they would change their law and what they are raising as a reason for a change? Mr. Sullivan. Well, I think they are raising as a reason for a change the fact that the law produces absurd results. One of the things that they are thinking about changing is clearly establishing this principle of first aggressor and whether first aggressors can avail themselves of the law. Duty to retreat, if I can, Senator, is important because I have heard comments today that are plainly wrong with respect to what historically duty to retreat meant. And you said it. It meant ``safely retreat.'' It did not mean stand there foolishly and be brutalized because of some law. If it is unsafe to retreat, nowhere in our history is an individual required to retreat; rather, only if it is safe to retreat. This is just a norm of good judgment, the exercise of good judgment, a norm that prevents the sort of vigilantism that we see in these many cases that were cited. Finally, I think Florida, to answer your question, should tweak the immunity provision, because my point is that immunity, along with the change in presumption, conditions a certain response in people; that is, people who know this law behave in a way, a much more aggressive, frontiersman-like way, that they would not but for the broad, expansive protection of these laws, quite different from the historical self-defense laws and even quite different from the ``stand your ground'' iterations historically. 2005 marked an extreme difference in the way that these laws were written. Chairman Durbin. Thank you. Mr. LaBahn. Mr. LaBahn. Mr. Chair, thank you. Responding to your question about Florida, the other significant thing that Florida is doing and has passed out of their committee is the immunity provision. They are working on the--and it was the civil portion to say that if someone sprays and creates--kills a number of people in ``stand your ground'' that they should not be civilly immune, especially hitting an innocent bystander, because I think it is significant, and as I shared, I testified in front of that commission, and now they are stepping forward and changing what is a flawed law. May I add one other comment, sir? William Meggs, who was unable--he is the second judicial circuit prosecutor out of Florida. He was unable to attend today, but he had been in the initial one. His closing comments, I think, are so very, very important, and that was this: ``Shouldn't we have a duty to act reasonably toward one another?'' That was the law before ``stand your ground'' and which is why the law should return. The bottom line is that this is an unnecessary law which makes it easier for the worst criminals to get away with some of our most heinous crimes. So, yes, that is why, on behalf of prosecutors, I stand here today. Chairman Durbin. Thank you. Senator Cruz. Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At the beginning, I would like to enter into the record a statement from the senior Senator from Texas, Senator Cornyn. Chairman Durbin. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Cornyn appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Cruz. I would like to thank each of the members of the panel for being here, in particular Ms. Fulton and Ms. McBath. Thank you for being here. Thank you for sharing your stories. Every parent understands the mourning you are feeling, and it is always a tragedy when a child loses his life. And please know that we are all feeling your loss and express our very sincerest condolences. Much of the discussion this afternoon has concerned the tragic circumstances of the Trayvon Martin case. And none of us in this hearing was there that night. None of us knows precisely what happened. We do know that there was a violent altercation between an Hispanic man and an African American teenager, and we know that at the end of that confrontation, the teenager was dead. What exactly occurred that night no one in this room likely will know for sure. But we do know some things. We know that our system of justice has a process for ascertaining what happens when there is a violent confrontation, particularly one that leads to the loss of life, and that process is a jury trial. And a jury of Mr. Zimmerman's peers heard the evidence in that case. He was prosecuted in that case, and the jury rendered a conclusion. We do not know if the jury was right or wrong, but we do know that the jury system is the only system that our judicial system has for ascertaining what happened. Particularly when you have a one-on-one confrontation, it can be particularly difficult to determine what the facts are. But we also know that the subject of this hearing, the ``stand your ground'' laws, was not a defense that Mr. Zimmerman raised. So this entire hearing--the topic of this hearing is not the issue on which that trial turned. And, sadly, we know that some in our political process have a desire to exploit that tragic, violent incident for agendas that have nothing to do with that young man who lost his life. We have seen efforts to undermine the verdict of the jury and more broadly to inflame racial tensions that I think are sad and irresponsible. I recognize that for the family you are simply mourning the loss of your son, and I understand that. But there are other players who are seeking to do a great deal more based on what happened that Florida night. I would note additionally that the Chairman of this Committee a moment ago made, I thought, a remarkable statement to the effect that no one could reasonably believe that ``stand your ground'' laws protect those in the African American communities who are victims of violent crime. I think that is a remarkable statement on many, many fronts, including the fact that a great many African Americans find themselves victims of violent crime and have asserted this defense to defend themselves, defend their families, defend their children. But I also find it remarkable because the assertion that no one reasonably could suggest this benefited the African American community is drawn into remarkable relief when one keeps in mind that in 2004, a State Senator in Illinois by the name of Barack Obama cosponsored an expansion of Illinois' law providing civil immunity for those who use justifiable force to defend themselves. So the notion that ``stand your ground'' laws are some form of veiled racism may be a convenient political attack, but it is not borne out by the facts remotely. I want to, second, note the issue of ALEC, an organization that exists to encourage common sense legislation in State legislatures. I would like to enter into the record multiple letters that have been submitted to me by organizations that are concerned about the targeting of ALEC in conjunction with this hearing. Chairman Durbin. Without objection. [The letters appear as submissions for the record.] Senator Cruz. And I would note that it should always be a concern when you see the U.S. Senate targeting the exercise of free speech. This observation is not unique to me. Indeed, on August 8, 2013, the Chicago Tribune wrote an editorial that stated: ``Free speech is not always free. It gets downright cumbersome'' when Senators have you on their enemies lists. And it would be wrong for a U.S. Senator to use the power of his high federal office as a cudgel against his enemies, and I certainly hope that this Senate hearing does not become an avenue to suppress free speech. A final point I would like to make: By its definition, the ``stand your ground'' law does not apply to aggressors. It explicitly excludes aggressors. I would note, Ms. McBath, on the facts as you have described that evening your son lost his life, the defense would not apply, would not even arguably apply. It is a defense that only, only, only applies to those who are the victims or potential victims of other violent aggressors. Indeed, it is only triggered when there is ``an imminent attack that could cause death or serious bodily injury.'' So this is a doctrine that, by definition, does not apply to aggressors and only applies when death or serious bodily injury is at risk. And so the question that all of us have to ask is: In a confrontation between a violent aggressor and a potential innocent victim, a potential innocent victim seeking to protect himself, herself, or her children, with whom do we stand? And I, for one, believe we should stand with the innocent against aggressors. That is why the right to self-defense has been so critical for time immemorial. And I hope that we will not see the constitutional rights of innocent citizens sacrificed because of political agendas of some. Thank you. Chairman Durbin. I would ask patience of my colleague from Connecticut. Since the Senator from Texas has raised some personal issues, I am going to respond to them. Let me be very specific when I say this. Do not take my word for it. Take the testimony of Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP Washington Bureau, in which he states--and it is part of this record--``Few issues have caused as much angst and raised as many deeply held concerns among our members and the communities we serve as that of `stand your ground' laws. These laws and their applications have sadly resulted in no less than the murder of people who were doing nothing more than walking down the street.'' Statement in the record by Hilary Shelton of the NAACP. This continued reference to ``inflaming racial tensions,'' my friends, we have heard this before over and over again. We have problems with the issues of race in America that we have to face squarely. And when people are being discriminated against, whoever, wherever in america, the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights is not going to back away. The second point I would like to make is this: There are many victims when it comes to ``stand your ground'' laws. ALEC is not one of them. I will concede that I asked those who were publicly identified as supporters of this organization if they supported this ``stand your ground'' law. Only one out of 140 that responded said they supported it. I am not going to enter the names of these organizations in the record for the very point that was made by the Senator from Texas. I do not want to establish any chilling effect on political participation. But I think it is reasonable to ask the members of an organization if they agree with that organization's agenda, an agenda which Mr. Piscopo, who is now the chairman of ALEC, from the State of Connecticut, has said they no longer stand by. So I am not going to enter any names into the record for that very reason, but isn't it noteworthy that of 140 organizations contacted, only one said they supported ALEC's agenda on ``stand your ground'' laws? That is a fact. Senator Blumenthal. Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I want to thank the Chairman for having this hearing. It is not only a legitimate but a necessary hearing. It is profoundly important that we face these issues of human rights, which hopefully are also matters of constitutional rights. And I want to thank every one of the witnesses, all of you, for being here today, most especially Ms. Fulton, Ms. McBath, for your stories and your firsthand experience, which is so profoundly important, because we can have theoretical and rhetorical debates here, but what really matters is what happens to these doctrines of law in the streets, in the courtroom, when they are explained to juries. I say that as a prosecutor. My fellow prosecutors would often say to me that the most difficult times for them in prosecuting a case was when the judge tried to explain the law to a jury. Right? How do you explain ``stand your ground'' in the complex, challenging, often emotionally charged time when a jury has to decide whether a person's liberty should be taken away and sometimes even a person's life as a result of the alleged commission of a serious crime? And so I must say, Mr. LaBahn, your testimony has special meaning to me because the members of your associations are the ones who take cases, this myriad of facts, sometimes confusing and contradictory, and try to present them to a judge or a jury in a way that results in justice. And you used one word that I think is profoundly important: ``ambiguity.'' ``Stand your ground'' as opposed to self-defense, even as I sit here, I wrestle with what the distinctions are in real life and how they are explained to juries. And that is why I agree with Senator Durbin that the ambiguity of these doctrines can encourage violence and confrontation. The apparent approval that it may give to people who feel that they have been insulted and maybe threatened, non- physically but verbally, seems to me can result in a hope of acquittal or non-conviction and thereby encourage violence. So maybe you can speak to how in the courtroom this doctrine of ``stand your ground'' has a practical impact. Mr. LaBahn. Thank you, Senator, and, you know, here I am in front of not one former Attorney General but actually two former Attorneys General, so I will have to be real good on my law, especially as you talk about the courtroom. First of all, what this law does is place it as either it is murder or nothing. And you talked about the ambiguity. Someone chooses to take an action and chooses and intentionally kills another, and usually the role of prosecutors with homicide and that killing, is it a manslaughter, is it a murder? If it is a murder, is it a first or a second? Are there some special circumstances? But when you put this, both the presumption and the immunity provisions in there, you create a situation where it is very difficult to determine, even at the filing stage, what kind of a crime it is. But especially particularly as it relates to Florida, you are put into that box. It is either murder or nothing. Second, there has been some discussion here about the aggressor, and I would like the Committee to look at Chapter 776.041 of the Florida statute and why ``stand your ground'' did apply in the Trayvon Martin case and applied directly. It is because 776.041 "
