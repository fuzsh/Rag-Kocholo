        "text": "The Mary Baalmann Adkins ’79 Scholarship Fund was established in 1998 by Mary’s SJA classmates, her parents, Dick and Katy Felke Baalmann ’55, and friends of the family. Throughout the years the fund has grown through the Baalmann’s generosity and the continued generosity of classmates and friends. Recently Dick and Katy made it a fully funded scholarship.\n\nThey remarked, “We believe the Mary Baalmann Adkins ’79 Scholarship Fund will not stop with $200,000. With continuing contributions from family and friends, our hope is that it will continue to grow and provide additional funds to deserving young women.”\n\nFounded in 2017, The Berra Family Charitable Foundation promotes a philanthropic vision by funding programs and services that benefit military, education, health, animals, and other societal needs that reflect their personal charitable interests. Most of the Berra family lives in St. Louis, MO, so they keep much of their giving close to home. This foundation is a way to give back to the community and honor their son, husband, brother, brother-in-law, and uncle, Lee Michael Berra, who passed away in an airplane crash in 2017 at the age of 32. Lee was a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base. During his time in the military, he flew 2,599 military flight hours in 30 aircrafts with 2,270 hours in the supersonic B-1 Lancer. He was deployed to the Middle East three times and was a licensed commercial pilot.\n\nThe Boniface Foundation provides support for charitable and educational activities that promote individual and community health and well-being in St. Louis counties and city. The foundation exists to make our community a better place.\n\nThe Boniface name is a tribute to the history of medical care provided to the St. Louis community by the Franciscan Sisters of Germany. The first hospital operated by the sisters was St. Boniface Hospital in south St. Louis, which was named for the parish that brought the sisters over from Germany. The Franciscan Sisters operated St. Boniface from 1873-77, followed by Pius Hospital in north St. Louis, little St. Anthony’s Hospital and old St. Anthony’s Hospital, both in south St. Louis. After the order relinquished control of the hospital, St. Anthony’s Medical Center was built in south St. Louis County and opened in 1975. The foundation was established in 1999 and operated as a supporting organization to St. Anthony’s Medical Center. In 2017, St. Anthony's affiliated with Mercy and the foundation became a private organization and changed its name from St. Anthony’s Medical Center Foundation to Boniface Foundation.\n\nThe Virginia Barrett Florman ’32 Scholarship Fund was established in 2010 through an estate gift to St. Joseph’s Academy. In an interview before her death on January 31, 2010, Virginia remarked, “We (me, my daughter, sister and aunt) received such a wonderful education from St. Joseph’s Academy. They do it the best. They really know how to teach to the whole person. I am giving it as unrestricted - for whatever the Sisters think it would be good for – wherever the need is. I trust they will make the right decision on how to spend it.”\n\nThe Gund Family Scholarship was established in 2023 by Michelle Gund Smith ’84 and Barbara Gund Wittich ’75 at the request of their late uncle/brother, David J. Gund. Michelle Gund Smith ’84 tells us, “The Gund Family grew up knowing the value of a Catholic education. At home, we prayed daily, we were taught that education was important, and that we should be life-long learners. Grateful for the generous gifts and talents that God gave us, we were expected to be productive and contributing members of society with strong work ethics. St. Joseph’s Academy supported and encouraged our family values outside our homes and allowed us to develop life-long friendships to support those values as well. The David J. Gund Trust sponsored this scholarship to emphasize the value of a Catholic education instilled in our family and to celebrate the graduates of the Gund Family - Nancy Gund Simon ’61, Lois Gund Brighoff ’63, Carol Gund Wolken ’68†, Barbara Gund Wittich ’75, Michelle Gund Smith ’84, Anne Marie Gund Greenberg ’95, Catherine Gund ’01, Lisa Wittich Ackroyd ’02, Christina Wittich Greenaway ’04, Regina Wittich ’08, Elizabeth O. Gund ’09, Bridget Gund ’12, Madelyn Simon ’17, Avery L. Simon ’23.\"\n\nThe Robert Korte Scholarship was established in 2017 by the estate of Robert (Bob) J. Korte and his sister, Mary Korte-Mueller. His wishes were to give his money to churches, schools, and charities who help those in need, including institutions that assist families with tuition so their child(ren) will receive a Catholic education. He wanted to give back to those who helped in his life’s journey, i.e. “to pass it on.” Bob was educated by the Sisters of St. Joseph at St. Patrick’s parish in University City. St. Joseph’s Academy was chosen for this scholarship because that school is now closed, and he wanted to assist students associated with a St. Joseph’s education. He also dated a graduate of St. Joe, Class of 1961. Bob believed that he was blessed with talent and treasure that needed to be shared with those less fortunate.\n\nThe Harold Lorenz Scholarship was established in 2015 by his sister, Sr. Paddy Lorenz, CSJ ‘48. Sr. Paddy attended St. Joseph’s Academy with financial assistance as her father had died when she was 12 years old. This assistance was the only way that she could have had such an opportunity. After St. Joe, Sr. Paddy attended Fontbonne College for two years before entering the community of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet. According to Sr. Paddy, her time at St. Joe, “truly changed the whole course of my life” and she wants to help “make the SJA experience possible for young women who would not otherwise have the opportunity.”\n\nThe Mark and Patti Sullivan Mays ’82 Family Scholarship was established in 2008 by Mark and Patti Mays. Patti and Mark hope to provide the opportunity for young women to receive the same type of faith-based education that Patti received as a student.\n\nPatti remarked, “My years at St. Joe had a life-changing impact on me, and we want to give other girls the opportunity to be a part of this incredible experience.” Patti credits the SJA faculty for making a significant impact on her. “My teachers reached out to make a connection with us and pushed us to succeed beyond our own expectations. Even as a student, I could sense the personal investment they were making to help us develop our character and values.”\n\nThe Paul M. Berra Scholarship Fund was established in 1992 by friends and family in memory of Paul and in celebration of his over 40 years of dedication and generosity to the Sisters of St. Joseph and St. Joseph’s Academy. Paul Berra was a city and state public official for almost 40 years and he was devoted to St. Joe.\n\nThis scholarship is awarded to students in financial need that demonstrate public service and good citizenship. Paul’s sister was Sr. Mary de Paul Berra. He has a daughter Ann Berra-Beermann ’81, and a granddaughter, Angela Berra ’08.\n\nThe Paul M. Berra Scholarship Fund was changed to the Paul M. and Elizabeth C. “Betty” Berra Scholarship Fund in June 2008 in honor of Betty Berra’s 80th birthday.\n\nLoss Provides Opportunities for Tomorrow’s Leaders\n\nBetsy Martin '77 Leadership Fund\n\nAs many of you know, Betsy Martin died on June 4, 2013 peacefully in the loving care of her family at her home in Toronto, following a courageous battle with cancer. Her sister Nancy Martin Ross (SJA ’80) received many letters from friends of Betsy and her fellow high school classmates almost all commented on remembering Betsy’s big smile as she walked the halls of St. Joe. The idea of a scholarship fund in honor of Betsy came from Celeste and Matt Padberg. Betsy and Matt’s friendship go back to a road trip they took together in high school. SJA is so very grateful to also acknowledge the generosity of Nancy and John Ross who with their support helped make the Betsy Martin Leadership Fund for tuition support and assistance possible for this school year.\n\nBetsy’s family is honored by this fund and knows that Betsy would love the idea of helping to fund a young woman’s education. Betsy’s daughter Emma is excited to be able to be part of her mom’s legacy by hearing about the St. Joe student.\n\nBetsy was the beloved wife of Corey Copeland and mother of Emma and much loved sister of Maurice (and Rosemary), sister Michele Hovey (and Scott), Joan (and Perry), Anne (and Marty), and Nancy (and John) and is missed by 17 nieces and nephews. Born in 1959 in Washington D.C. she attended Boston College and later the Harvard Kennedy School, where she earned an MPA and was honored as a Littauer Fellow for academic excellence and community service. Betsy credited Sister Sandra for some of her own drive and ambition from both encouragement and challenges.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard, where she met Corey, she began an accomplished career as an advisor to Community Foundations of Canada. She led several ground-breaking initiatives including Our Millennium, a nationwide program that mobilized 4.6 million Canadians in local community-building projects and won the Peter F. Drucker Award for non-profit innovation. An active writer on philanthropic policy, she was also a director of the Social Investment Organization, the Canadian Environmental Grantmakers Network and the Small Change Fund. She co-founded Jackson/Martin, a social impact investment consultancy. She was truly on the forefront of the social impact concept.\n\nBeyond her clear vocational calling and deep commitment to helping others, Betsy was a devoted mother, wife, sister and friend. She was kind, gracious, faithful, and had a wonderful sense of humor and generous heart. She is deeply missed."
