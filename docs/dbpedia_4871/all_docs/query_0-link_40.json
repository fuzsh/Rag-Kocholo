        "text": "Obituary of Matthew Francis Sullivan\n\nMATTHEW FRANCIS (MATT) SULLIVAN, 45, of Thousand Oaks, passed away July 16, 2022 at his home in the Foxmoor neighborhood of Westlake Village where he and his family have lived since 1984.\n\nFuneral Mass will be held at St. Jude’s Catholic Church, 32032 W. Lindero Canyon Road, Westlake Village, CA, on Saturday, July 23, 2022 at 12:00 o’clock noon with Monsignor Robert J. McNamara as celebrant. Burial will follow at Assumption Catholic Cemetery, 1380 Fitzgerald Road, Simi Valley. Visitation will be held at Rose Family Funeral Home, 4444 Cochran Street, Simi Valley on Friday, July 22, 2022 from 5:00 PM until 9:00 PM.\n\nMatt was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut on June 10, 1977 to Mark F. Sullivan and Millicent A (Millie) Sullivan who were then a Navy family. He was the second born in a family of five boys. He attended grammar school at Westlake Elementary, middle school at Colina Intermediate and high school at Westlake High School. From childhood, Matt was a “gearhead” who loved cars and airplanes. He was a self-taught “jack of all trades” with a specialized talent for restoring vintage general aviation aircraft including avionics repairs. Raised in a family of aviation enthusiasts and pilots, he obtained his private pilot’s license in 1997 and frequented both the Camarillo and Oxnard Airports where he worked for various aviation maintenance shops and aircraft owners.\n\nMatt is survived by his father, Westlake Village attorney Mark F. Sullivan, his mother Millie Sullivan, and his four brothers who were also raised in Foxmoor: Patrick Sullivan, a Skywest Airlines pilot in Houston, Texas, Mark Sullivan, Jr., a United Airlines pilot in Hawthorne, California, Thomas Sullivan, a business executive in Cocoa Beach, Florida and John Sullivan, an engineer with the Boeing Aircraft Company in Mukilteo, Washington.\n\nMemorial donations may be made to the Salvation Army Santa Monica Adult Rehabilitation Center (ARC), 1658 11th St., Santa Monica, CA 90404."
