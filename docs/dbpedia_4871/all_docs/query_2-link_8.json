        "text": "Lieutenant Patrick J. Sullivan began his 27-year career with the New York City Fire Department on October 7, 1985. After his probationary training, Pat was assigned to Engine 310 in Brooklyn. Five years later, he went “across the floor” to Ladder 174, where he served until his promotion to lieutenant on September 7, 1996. As a lieutenant, he bounced for a period of time until he was assigned to Engine 45 in the Bronx on June 26, 1999. He served there for five years before again going “across the floor” to Ladder 58 for the remainder of his years as a New York City firefighter.\n\nPat enjoyed sports, both as a spectator and a participant. He would be sure to join in a few basketball games with friends at local parks and gymnasiums whenever he could, but his true sports passion was playing hockey on an FDNY team, which he did for most of his years as a firefighter. He was also an avid New York Rangers fan.\n\nPat loved being a firefighter, and he loved the firefighters with whom he worked. He will be remembered for his calm and capable approach to firefighting.\n\nLieutenant Sullivan is survived by his loving wife, Patricia, and two wonderful children, Michael and Courtney."
