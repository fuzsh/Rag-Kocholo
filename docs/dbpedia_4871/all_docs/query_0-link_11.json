J. Boyle (New York, 1992); Martial (ed.) (New York & London, 1993).\n\nJ. P. Sullivan was a leading critic of Latin literature during the period when modern literary criticism of ancient Latin texts came into its own. Born in Liverpool, of which he remained intensely proud, Sullivan was the first member of his family to attend university. He studied at Cambridge, where he studied Greek philosophy under Renford Bambrough and made a double first in the Tripos, and Oxford, where his interest turned to Latin literature, specifically Propertius, Propertius, and martial. He was fellow of Queen's College and Lincoln College, Oxford, before he moved to the United States. During the 1960s at the University of Texas he participated in founding and editing Arion, an influential, iconoclastic \"journal of imaginative criticism of the classics,\" and also assembled two important collections of critical writing on Latin literature (Critical Essays on Roman Literature: Elegy and Lyric; Satire) which stimulated much fresh inquiry in the field thanks to Sullivan's use of methods used by anthropologists. At SUNY-Buffalo in the next decade he similarly fostered newer approaches to the classics in the periodical Arethusa; under his editorship the journal inaugurated its longstanding practice of publishing special issues with the numbers \"Politics and Art in Augustan Literature,\" followed by \"Women in Antiquity\" and \"Psychoanalysis and the Classics.\" Sullivan's editorial labors continued throughout his career, including from the later period at UC-Santa Barbara anthologies of criticism on and translations of Martial. Sullivan's own major studies are his books on Petronius, Propertius, and Martial. Each aims to serve as an overview or general introduction to the ancient author and is written for scholar and non-specialist reader alike. T.S. Eliot suggested he write Ezra Pound and Sextus Propertius and published (through Faber and faber) Sullivan's The Satyricon of Petronius: A Literary Study, which marked the turning point in literary analysis of the work, not least because of its provocative Freudian approach to the sexual themes. Martial: The Unexpected Classic, Sullivan's synoptic treatment of a neglected poet, will perhaps be his most enduring scholarly achievement. Sullivan was also an accomplished translator of Latin literature, a poet, and a lifelong student of the reception of classical authors in modern literature. His writings always reflect the relationship of the classics to the broader literary culture at the same time that they seek to expand the range of questions that serious readers ask (or should ask) about classical culture."
