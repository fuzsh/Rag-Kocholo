You can then forward the email to the family or print it and give it to them personally.\n\nAfter an order is placed, our forestry partners will plant the tree in the area of greatest need (nearest the funeral home), according to the planting schedule for the year.\n\nDue to seasonal conditions, the tree planting takes place during the spring and summer.\n\nTree Planting Timeline\n\nOrders placed in:\n\nJanuary - May\n\nPlanting will take place in Sprint or Summer of the same year.\n\nJune - December\n\nPlanting will take place in Spring of the following year.\n\nHide Detail"
