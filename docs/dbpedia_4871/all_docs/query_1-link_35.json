        "text": "English-American mass murderer (1991–2014)\n\nElliot Oliver Robertson Rodger (July 24, 1991 – May 23, 2014) was an English-American former college student and mass murderer responsible for the 2014 Isla Vista killings. On May 23, 2014, Rodger killed six people and injured fourteen others by using knives, semi-automatic pistols and his car in Isla Vista, California, near the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Rodger first killed his two roommates and their friend in the apartment they shared, ambushing and stabbing them one at a time as they arrived. Hours later, he drove to a sorority house, intending to murder its occupants. Unable to enter, Rodger shot at three women walking outside the sorority house, killing two. He later drove by a nearby delicatessen, shooting and killing a man inside.\n\nAfterward, Rodger went around Isla Vista, shooting indiscriminately and ramming into pedestrians with his BMW. He exchanged gunfire with sheriff's deputies twice, the latter occurrence resulted in Rodger getting shot in his hip. Shortly after, he crashed his vehicle into a parked car. As police looked around the vehicle, they found Rodger dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head. Before starting his attacks, Rodger uploaded a YouTube video in which he detailed his intentions of \"punish[ing]\" women for their lack of interest in him, as well as the men whom they were attracted to. He also e-mailed a 137-page manifesto—where he detailed his major life events, personal struggles, and frustrations with having remained a virgin his entire life—to several of his family members, acquaintances, and therapists.\n\nEarly life\n\nElliot Oliver Robertson Rodger was born in London on July 24, 1991, to parents Peter Rodger and Ong Li Chin Tye.[1][2][3][4][5] Peter, a British national, is a filmmaker who has directed television commercials and served as a second unit director on The Hunger Games (2012).[6][7][8][9][10] His mother is of Malaysian Chinese descent and has also worked in the film industry, first training in health care and then working as an on-set nurse during the productions of The Princess Bride (1987) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).[11][12][13] His paternal grandfather, George Rodger, was a well-known photojournalist known for his images from the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.[14][15][16][17][18]\n\nFollowing Rodger's birth, his family moved to Sussex, where he enjoyed an affluent and privileged childhood. Li Chin left her nursing career to look after Rodger and soon welcomed a daughter into the family. Rodger's paternal grandmother later moved in and developed a strong connection with her.[19][20][21][22][23] He initially attended Dorset House, a private all-boys school in West Sussex.[18][20][21][24][25] When Rodger was aged 5, his family moved to the upscale Woodland Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles.[18][26][27][28] Here, Rodger attended Pinecrest Schools before switching to Topanga Elementary School.[29]\n\nRodger's parents divorced when he was aged 7.[30][31][32][33][34] Custody was split between the parents, with Rodger and his younger sister living with their mother during weekdays and their father during weekends. A year after the divorce, Rodger's father married Soumaya Akaaboune, a Moroccan-born French actress.[6][35][36][37] It was around this time that Rodger began showing difficulty socializing with others. As an elementary student he was quiet and withdrawn, whispered answers if addressed, preferred to write down information rather than talk and avoided peer interaction during recess. He often engaged in repetitive behaviors, such as tapping his feet, and was easily overwhelmed by overstimulation. Social gatherings like birthday parties made him anxious, and on one occasion at Disneyland, he was overwhelmed to tears by the crowds.[11][38][39] Rodger viewed his sister as a rival, throwing tantrums over issues in which his parents took her side over him.[40][41][42]\n\nIn 1999, Rodger's mother filed an affidavit asking for more child support from his father, labelling her son as a \"high-functioning autistic child\" with special needs. Rodger's father presented a diagnosis by Dr. Stephen M. Scappa, who stated the autism diagnosis was false because the examiner might have missed conditions like depression or anxiety. Scappa recommended that Rodger undergo additional evaluation by a child psychiatrist to secure a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment.[43][44][45][46] Meanwhile, Rodger had a difficult relationship with his stepmother Akaaboune, rejecting her parental authority in favor of his biological mother.[47]\n\nAs he grew, Rodger became self-conscious about his short height and slender frame, briefly playing basketball in the belief that it would make him grow taller.[29][48][49][40] He also became embarrassed about his mixed race heritage, which he felt set him apart from his entirely white peers.[50][51][52][53][54] At age 9, in an effort to blend in, Rodger dyed his hair blonde and picked up skateboarding, hoping these changes would help him befriend other children.[47][55] Despite his extreme social awkwardness, Rodger started to socialize with his more popular peers and attempted to approach girls.[41] He later began experiencing feelings of resentment, convinced that his life was unfair compared to his peers.[6] His increased difficulty establishing friendships, particularly with women, led to a sense of isolation and frustration.[55][47]\n\nMiddle years\n\nRodger's mother dated filmmaker George Lucas for a short period during the late 1990s, leading to her and Rodger being invited to the red carpet premiere of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999).[11][43][55][56] However, Rodger's enjoyment of movies began to wane due to his discomfort with couples present at movie theaters.[55] During this period, his stepmother became pregnant and subsequently gave birth to a son, Rodger's younger half-brother.[57]\n\nAs his social activity decreased during middle school, Rodger immersed himself in popular video games such as Halo and World of Warcraft at his parent's houses and cybercafés,[47][58][59][60] primarily socializing with others via online chatrooms.[55][61][62] When he was aged 11, a fellow chatroom user shared sexually explicit images with him, leading to overwhelming feelings of shock and emotions for Rodger.[30] Upon reaching puberty, Rodger developed a high sex drive but began to believe he would never have sexual relationships with women.[63] He became known as the \"quiet\" and \"weird kid\" who intentionally annoyed classmates, leading to bullying by other students.[41][64] One of his bullies was a blonde girl, which led him to develop misogynistic attitudes.[65][66][67]\n\nAfter finishing middle school, Rodger enrolled in Crespi Carmelite High School (Crespi), an all-boys Catholic school in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles.[68][69][70] While he was initially eager to distance himself from female peers, observing the older, taller students at Crespi caused Rodger to have an anxiety attack during his first day of attendance.[43] Rodger reported being severely bullied by seniors at Crespi, which included homophobic abuse due to his refusal to associate with girls.[55][71][72][73] Overwhelmed by the bullying, Rodger withdrew socially, neglected his homework and spent hours playing video games.[29][71][43][74] On the last day of Rodger's freshman year, a classmate bragged about having sexual relations with his girlfriend. Rodger didn't believe him, causing the classmate to play a voice recording of him and his girlfriend being intimate. Rodger's subsequent outburst led to him being picked up in the main office by his mother, the last time he would leave Crespi.[73][63]\n\nRodger's parents enrolled him in Taft Charter High School, the transition to which intensified Rodger's fears due to its large student population.[29] Once again he faced severe bullying, often by male students and in the presence of female students.[43] One afternoon, while leaving the premises, Rodger suffered an anxiety attack which caused school staff to contact his mother, leading to him being withdrawn from Taft after only a week of attendance.[64][43] His parents then enrolled him at Independence Continuation High School, a school of roughly 100 students that offered three to four hours of daily instruction, believing it to be a safer environment for their son.[29][43]\n\nIn 2007, Rodger was diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), a condition on the autism spectrum (AS) that leads to challenges in social development.[11][75] While he didn't meet the criteria to be diagnosed with autism, his PDD-NOS diagnosis helped him receive special education resources.[11] At age 15, Rodger was prescribed Xanax and Prozac, eventually taking Paxil, but stopped taking those medications after a year.[38]\n\nAt the age of 17, the mere suggestion of visiting his stepmother's home country of Morocco triggered a temper tantrum from Rodger. He ended up going with his stepmother and half-brother but remained discontent, emailing his biological mother non-stop until she finally allowed him to return to her home.[76] Meanwhile, his father's filmmaking career severely declined during the 2000s, culminating in a documentary film, Oh My God (2009), which bombed at the box office.[35][77][78][79][80] The film's failure drove Rodger's father into debt and forced him to pause his child support payments.[17][81]\n\nBecoming concerned with his unwillingness to socialize, Rodger's stepmother made him stop playing his video games, causing tensions between the two to escalate.[43][82][83][84] Eventually these tensions reached a point where in Rodger was kicked out of his father's house.[11] Rodger soon harbored a fixation on becoming rich, believing it to be the key to gaining attention from women.[22][85] He urged his mother to marry a wealthy man,[86] then took up pursuits such as screenwriting and inventing on the belief that they would be shortcuts to success, only to quickly give up when he felt challenged.[17][86][87] Disliking high school and determined to graduate early, Rodger attended classes more regularly and earned top grades, graduating from Independence Continuation High School in 2010.[88][89]\n\nLater life\n\nBy age 18, Rodger had ceased his mental health treatment and refused to take his prescribed medication.[6][90][91] He held his parents responsible for his lack of wealth, blaming his mother for not marrying a wealthier man for his benefit and his father for using his money toward Oh My God.[17] Rodger went on to enroll in Los Angeles Pierce College but didn't stay long, choosing to leave when seeing too many happy couples caused feelings of anger.[43][55][63]\n\nDespite his mother's encouragement to seek employment, Rodger frequently passed his time wandering around her house or reading at a bookstore, hoping to find friends. He would later sit by himself in cafés, hoping for any woman to approach him.[76] Worried about his direction in life, his parents offered him help with finding employment, but Rodger deemed many jobs suggested to him to be \"beneath him.\"[55][86] Rodger's father referred him to one of his friends, where Rodger worked in construction for a time.[92][93] When his half-brother began to show signs of sociability, in spite of his own social disadvantages at that age, Rodger grew envious, but enjoyed his company nonetheless.[76]\n\nRodger soon enrolled at Moorpark College, attracted by its smaller size and appealing aesthetics. He was hopeful that the change would mark a new beginning, particularly with the prospect of meeting blonde women and showing a potential girlfriend around his new campus. However, Rodger quickly found himself in familiar thoughts of loneliness and unhappiness at Moorpark, developing feelings of envy towards a couple in one of his classes. His discomfort was further fueled by his social anxiety, particularly when he was called upon by a professor. Rodger dropped out of Moorpark after completing a year.[86][94][95]\n\nRodger took comfort in knowing that his best friend, who he had known since childhood, was also a virgin, but couldn't understand why his friend wasn't as angry with women as he was. Seeing his friend as weak, Rodger eventually revealed his thoughts of taking over the world and killing people. Their friendship grew strained over time, and Rodger's friend began to distance himself. Rodger shared his disturbing fantasies with other friends, which led those friends to distance themselves as well.[11][96][97]\n\nSanta Barbara\n\nIn an attempt to reduce his isolation, Rodger's parents decided to send him to college in Santa Barbara.[6][64][98] They agreed to pay for his apartment and college classes, optimistic participating in a college community would encourage him to make friends.[17][55][99] Rodger agreed after watching the crime drama film Alpha Dog (2006).[71][100] Thinking about the film, Rodger believed moving to Santa Barbara would give him the chance to go to parties and finally lose his virginity.[64][101]\n\nOn June 4, 2011, Rodger moved into the Capri Apartments in Isla Vista, near the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus.[75][87][102][103][104] Enrolling at Santa Barbara City College (SBCC), he was soon angered when one of his roommate's black friends shared that he had lost his virginity at the age of 13.[105][106][107] This deeply upset Rodger, who retreated to his room and called his mother, expressing his frustration over the attention black men received from blonde women instead of him.[22][96][108]\n\nRodger found it hard to get along with several different roommates and chose to spend much of his time alone.[109][110] When he shared a room with two Hispanic roommates, he would call them racial slurs and insist he was better looking. When his next roommate brought his girlfriend to their apartment, Rodger told him he was \"foolish\" for being happy to be in a relationship with \"an ugly whore\". The roommate sent a letter to Capri's management asking to be assigned a new apartment, stating that Rodger had \"huge psychological issues\" and was a \"ticking time bomb waiting to explode.\"[103][111][112][113]\n\nRodger soon began developing a deep hatred towards the people of Isla Vista, seeing himself as a sophisticated person deserving of relationships with attractive blonde women; he believed that women were wrong for rejecting him, and blamed men who were more successful than him for their rejection.[114][115][116] Rodger started to have thoughts of killing couples, envisioning himself stabbing them to death while they were engaged in sexual activity.[96][117]\n\nIn July 2011, during a visit to Starbucks, Rodger noticed a couple engaging in a kiss; he followed them outside and, in a moment of anger, threw his coffee at them. The man yelled at Rodger, prompting him to flee the scene.[87][118][119] That same month, Rodger saw another couple kissing at a food court; he tracked them down in his car and splashed them with iced tea.[64][87][120] At SBCC, Rodger dropped a sociology course upon seeing a blonde woman with her boyfriend in class.[120] In January 2012, while driving past a bus stop, Rodger attempted to engage two blonde women by smiling; when they did not return the smile, he turned his car around and splashed his latté on them.[121][122][123]\n\nRodger soon developed an obsession with designer clothing, purchasing numerous items in an attempt to elevate his status.[39][55][124] He would roam around Isla Vista every day, often sitting at an outdoor table outside Domino's Pizza, hoping that a woman would find him attractive and initiate a conversation with him.[96] In an attempt to find social connection, Rodger made a friend who introduced him to other acquaintances in hopes of integrating him into their circle.[125][126]\n\nBy February 2012, Rodger's frustration with his social interactions, particularly with women, led him to withdraw from all his classes at SBCC. He began to contemplate what he referred to as the \"Day of Retribution,\" a planned attack on women and couples.[87][127][128][129][130][131] With the plans in mind, on March 11, 2012, Rodger went on a first-class airplane and took a private limousine to attend a private Katy Perry concert after his family were given tickets by friends.[132][133] The next day, Rodger went to the red carpet premiere of The Hunger Games with his father and step-mother, where he met Jack Ross, the 16-year-old son of the film's director, Gary Ross.[55][134][135]\n\nRodger began to believe the only way he would get a girlfriend was to get rich. He bought lottery tickets for the Mega Millions jackpot in June 2012, but his hopes were dashed when he lost. Rodger started to amass the funds for his planned attack, saving up to $6,000 to buy the supplies he thought he needed.[87] The following month, while walking alone in a park, he saw college students playing kickball.[43][136][137] Overwhelmed by envy when seeing blonde women interacting with the men in their group, Rodger went to a Kmart, purchased a Super Soaker, and filled it with orange juice.[43][138][139] He returned to the park and sprayed the students while yelling at them.[43][55][140]\n\nIn August 2012, Rodger's father gave him The Secret by Rhonda Byrne, a self-help book that promoted the \"law of attraction.\" Motivated by its principles, Rodger dedicated the entire month to meditating in his bedroom, imagining himself walking through a park alongside a beautiful woman.[86][87][141] The following month, Rodger broke his laptop computer in rage after failing to win a $120 million Mega Millions jackpot. While traveling to Oxnard the next day to purchase a replacement laptop, he visited a shooting range to learn how to use a firearm, believing that his \"Day of Retribution\" was now very possible.[87][142][143]\n\nStill hopeful of becoming rich, Rodger drove to Arizona in November 2012 to buy tickets for the Powerball jackpot, which had been raised to $500 million.[87][86] Despite driving to Arizona four times, his efforts were met with consistent failure, each loss pushing him deeper into fury.[144][145][146] Thinking this meant he would remain a virgin forever, Rodger actively began to prepare for his \"Day of Retribution\" in earnest, settling on the city of Isla Vista as his target.[17] In December 2012, Rodger bought a Glock 34 Long Slide semiautomatic pistol for $755.57 at a firearms dealer in Goleta, California.[87][147][148][149] Three months later, he purchased a SIG Sauer P226 handgun for $1,179.48 in Burbank.[87][149][150] Rodger's attack was originally scheduled to take place around Halloween of 2013, but he realized the heightened police presence typical of the holiday would thwart his plans.[151][152][153] He began to plan his attack for sometime in November 2013.[55]\n\nRodger and two new roommates were placed in a new apartment complex after taking a questionnaire about their personalities.[154][155] Rodger initially joined them for social activities, but after a few outings, he began to distance himself. The roommates soon suspected that Rodger possessed a firearm after hearing a clicking sound from his room numerous times. They moved out in June 2013, having become uncomfortable living with him.[156][157][158]\n\nIncident at house party\n\nOn July 20, 2013, Rodger, intent on losing his virginity days before his 22nd birthday, drank vodka to ease his nerves before attending a house party, with the hope of engaging with women.[6] As he entered the house, Rodger saw an Asian man talking with a blonde woman. Furious, Rodger deliberately bumped into the man as he walked by them.[120] Frustrated by his inability to talk with them, he climbed a ten-foot ledge and pretended to shoot people with his finger. When he attempted to shove multiple women off the ledge, a group of men pushed him off instead, resulting in a fractured ankle.[6][159][160] Rodger tried to leave the party but realized he had lost his Gucci sunglasses. Still inebriated, he attempted to return to the party but inadvertently walked into another house and was beaten by the occupants, causing him to get bruises, scrapes, and a swollen left eye. A battered Rodger stumbled back to his apartment.[11][161][162][163]\n\nThe following day, Rodger's father took him to the hospital, where Rodger was given surgery for his ankle.[11] He helped his son file a police report, which caused two sheriff's deputies to arrive at the hospital to question Rodger. Rodger claimed he was pushed off the ledge after insulting someone's appearance, asserting that he went to a different house and was then beaten by approximately ten men unprovoked. When asked why he didn't call the cops, he claimed he did not know who to reach out to.[11][159][164] A deputy remarked on Rodger's dishonesty, deeming him too \"timid\" and \"shy\" to tell the truth. A witness confirmed that Rodger instigated the incident, noting that he acted strangely and didn't talk to anyone at the party.[165] A neighbor observed Rodger returning home in tears, swearing to kill those who attacked him and contemplating suicide. The sheriff's office concluded Rodger was the instigator, and the investigation was closed without further action. Rodger was not arrested nor interrogated further.[87][159][166]\n\nMental health and further planning\n\nIn August 2013, while recovering from ankle surgery, Rodger stayed with his mother and agreed to meet with a former childhood therapist. Fueled by resentment over the house party incident and his repeated rejections by women, Rodger concluded that his only resolve was to enact his \"Day of Retribution.\" However, hindered by his fractured ankle, he postponed his planned attack until spring of 2014.[11][87] Rodger's parents sought more professional help for him, leading to therapy sessions with controversial psychiatrist Charles Sophy, who began treating Rodger in late 2012.[167][168][169] Sophy prescribed Risperidone, an antipsychotic drug, which Rodger decided not to take after researching it online.[55][170][171][172] Subsequently, he stopped going to his appointments with Sophy by the fall of 2013.[173][174][175]\n\nRodger's father sought assistance from his friend Dale Launer, a filmmaker known for his work on relationship-themed movies, in improving his son's interactions with women. Launer agreed to help, with the two communicating over email and meeting in person, but Rodger found his guidance ineffective.[11][167][176] His mother enlisted the help of an agency that provided three different counselors. Between May 2013 and May 2014, Rodger attended 29 sessions. He connected well with two male counselors but became jealous when they became social and made remarks about women around them. He formed a connection with a female counselor but was offended by the suggestion that he required paid female companionship, comparing it to being with a prostitute.[11][38][121] Rodger expressed to his counselors an interest in joining political science clubs and volunteering, with the goal of transferring to UCSB. Because of this, a counseling director informed Rodger's mother in late 2013 that he appeared to be making a sincere effort to improve his life and reduce his social isolation.[11]\n\nRodger's parents also enlisted the help of a life coach named Gavin Linderman.[92] Linderman provided Rodger with instructions to improve his social life, requiring him to travel to Los Angeles for the sessions. During their meetings, Rodger opened up to Linderman about his struggles with his virginity.[92] Linderman suggested that moving away from Isla Vista would be beneficial, but Rodger dismissed the idea.[55] Linderman advised Rodger's mother to consider having her son leave Isla Vista. She then gave Rodger two options: either she would help him find a residential treatment center where he could receive daily therapy, or he could move back home and receive intensive treatment from a therapist and social worker. Rodger responded by asking her to continue paying his rent, claiming he made new acquaintances and promising to focus on his classes and meet with counselors. Due to Rodger being an adult, his mother could not legally force him to leave Isla Vista. After discussing with the therapists, his mother was advised to support her son's wish to stay and complete his education.[11] Rodger's mother then bought him a used $40,000 2008 BMW 328i Coupé, giving a glimmer of hope within him that he might attract a girlfriend during the rest of 2013.[87][177][178][179][180]\n\nBehavior with others\n\nThe following semester, Rodger enrolled in classes but quickly withdrew from them.[11] In September 2013, Rodger was assigned a random apartment where he gained two new roommates, 20-year-old Weihan \"David\" Wang and 20-year-old Cheng Yuan \"James\" Hong.[87][181][182] As Wang's mother helped her son move his belongings into the apartment, she urged the three to take care of each other, which Rodger quickly brushed off.[183]\n\nRodger spent most of his time either out of the apartment or alone in his room,[183] making Wang feel bothered by his antisocial behavior. Wang filed complaints with the building manager, claiming Rodger played loud music during the night.[184][185][186] On January 15, 2014, Rodger and Hong got into a fight when Rodger accused Hong of stealing three of his candles valued at $22.[165][187][188][189] The conflict began when Rodger, irritated by Hong's cooking, took his measuring cup, prompting Hong to retaliate by taking Rodger's candles in an attempt to initiate a trade. Rodger then placed Hong under a citizen's arrest.[190][191][187][188] Upon police intervention, Hong claimed he believed Rodger had stolen his possessions, though Rodger denied the allegations.[189][190][191] Law enforcement discovered the candles on Hong's bed. After Hong refused to return the candles, he was arrested and charged with petty theft.[192][193][194][195]\n\nRodger later emailed the building manager, demanding that Hong and Wang be evicted from the apartment due to his stolen candles. He also complained that they were always too loud and constantly played video games.[11][196] Hong was angered by Rodger's actions but refrained from confronting him, concerned that it might worsen their living conditions. He and Wang distanced themselves from Rodger and signed a lease for a different apartment for the following semester.[183][197][198] Rodger in turn began to plan to murder Hong and Wang, finding them irritating and feeling they would get in the way of his attack.[87][199][200][201]\n\nIn October 2013, Rodger's envy toward his half-brother intensified upon learning from his stepmother that he had secured opportunities to appear in television commercials by an agent.[202][203][204] Consumed by jealousy, he began plotting the murder of his half-brother, fearing his sibling would surpass him in popularity with girls and social status.[205][206][207] Additionally, he devised a plan to kill his stepmother by stabbing her in the neck due to their strained relationship and finding she would get in the way.[208][209][210] Rodger planned to commit the murders while his father was away on a business trip, as he harbored concerns that he might hesitate if confronted with the task of killing him as well.[211][212]\n\nBy January 2014, Rodger contemplated launching his planned attack during Valentine's Day or Deltopia, a spring break event drawing crowds to Isla Vista in early April. However, he dismissed these dates due to heightened police presence and his realization that he required additional time for preparation.[213][214][215] Eventually, he settled on April 26 as the revised date for his attack.[87][214] In February 2014, Rodger called his sister while drunk and wandering through Isla Vista alone, venting about women ignoring him. She reassured him and managed to calm him down. Concerned about his social isolation, she became worried that the social scene in Isla Vista would only further damage her brother's mental health.[11]\n\nRodger would later buy another SIG Sauer P226 handgun for $1,132 in Oxnard in February, in case the other two firearms jammed.[149][216] Throughout February and March 2014, Rodger visited the gun ranges and made multiple ammunition purchases, using money he had saved from gifts from his grandparents and the $500 monthly allowance his father sent him.[39][17] Rodger also visited the library at SBCC twice, where a librarian assisted him in finding books about serial killers and mass murderers. He read the books in the library but never checked them out.[38][93]\n\nOnline activity\n\nRodger had a social media presence, sharing selfies on his Facebook profile which showcased himself enjoying luxurious plane rides and attending movie premieres.[217][218][219][220] Rodger also frequently shared photos on his Google+, often posing alongside his car.[221][222][223] On his personal blog, Rodger portrayed himself as a \"sophisticated, polite gentleman,\" expressing his difficulties in socializing and connecting with others in Isla Vista.[30][224][225][226] He would drive around the city and secretly record women and couples while complaining how lonely he felt by seeing them.[11][121][227] Rodger expressed his grievances about being a virgin his whole life through platforms such as YouTube.[43][228][229][230]\n\nIn the weeks leading up to April 26, Rodger uploaded twenty-two videos on YouTube, expressing his loneliness and frustration due to his unsuccessful attempts at attracting a girlfriend.[87][231][232][233] In the videos, he would question why women would prefer \"inferior\" men over him, questioning why his perceived good looks, high end clothes and expensive car failed to garner any attention or acknowledgment from them, with video titles such as: \"Why do girls hate me so much?\", \"Being lonely on Spring Break sucks\", \"Life is so unfair because girls don't want me\", and \"My reaction to seeing a young couple at the beach, Envy.\"[228][234][235][236][237]\n\nIn additional YouTube videos, he recorded himself taking drives around California in his BMW while dancing to music from musicians like Whitney Houston, George Michael and Phil Collins.[238][239][240][241][242] He would post his videos to forums like Bodybuilding.com, where despite his attempts to showcase his loneliness, users left comments that ridiculed him, branding him as desperate and insecure.[43][58] One Bodybuilding.com user attributed Rodger's romantic failures were due to sounding creepy and having a demeanor of a serial killer.[43][58][121][243]\n\nRodger subscribed to multiple YouTube channels associated with the men's rights movement, which posted content aimed at advising men on attracting and talking with women.[244][245][246] He also had a second YouTube channel named \"Valtharion\".[247][248][249] Rodger would leave negative comment across several videos, calling women derogatory terms and accusing other men of lying about their relationships with women. He also boasted about his affluent family background and expressed a sense of superiority due to being half-white.[250] His online activities also included numerous searches related to the Nazis, such as researching Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler, and looking up topics like, \"Did Adolf Hitler have a girlfriend,\" \"Adolf Hitler and the law of attraction,\" \"Nazi curbstomp,\" \"Holocaust of black people\" and \"Nazi anime.\"[38][75][251][252] Rodger also searched for information on \"modern torture devices\" and \"Spanish Inquisition torture devices.\"[253][254][255]\n\nRodger frequently engaged with online forums such as ForeverAlone and PUAHate, communities connected to the manosphere.[256][257][258][259][260] Within these forums, he and other men identified themselves as \"incels,\" a shorthand term for involuntary celibate, where they discussed their struggles to find a romantic or sexual partner, criticized each other and expressed disdain towards women and pick-up artists.[261][262][263][264][265]\n\nWhen a user suggested that lucid dreaming having sex could serve as a substitute for their lack of intimacy in real life, Rodger argued that incels needed to initiate a \"revolution,\" citing it was essential to \"destroy\" the issues they faced by recognizing their \"true strength and numbers.\" He advocated for the overthrow of what he termed the \"oppressive feminist system,\" envisioning a world where women would live in fear of incels.[266][267][268][269] Rodger also expressed racist views towards interracial couples, including mocking an Asian man trying to date a white women and stating it was \"rage-inducing\" after he saw a black man hanging out with white women.[39][270][271][272][273] After users accused him of being racist, Rodger expressed that he was shocked that white women would choose \"undeserving\" men over him.[121][274][275][276][277]\n\nFinal planning\n\nIn the weeks leading up to April 26, Rodger created a 137-page manifesto entitled My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger.[64][278][279][280] In it, Rodger describes his life story and frustrations of staying a virgin. He also described women as a \"plague\" and thought that them getting the right to choose their own partners could \"hinder the advancement of humanity,\" asserting that \"civilized men of intelligence\" should choose who they could mate with.[281][282][283][284][285] He also stated that women should not be given any rights, adding that their \"wickedness\" needed to be \"contained\" to avoid the risk of humanity from \"falling into degeneracy.\" Rodger opined that women's refusal to accept him was a \"declaration of war\" and hoped for his attacks to reshape humanity.[286][287][288][289] He believed that to \"purify the world,\" it was necessary to get rid of love and sex from human existence altogether. He imagined himself as a leader with \"fanatically loyal troops\" who imprison women in concentration camps, and the few left alive would be kept in \"secret labs\" and be \"artificially inseminated\" with sperm samples to become pregnant, ensuring men would be unaware of women's existence.[86][290]\n\nRodger detailed his plan for his \"Day of Retribution,\" and divided it into three phases.[291] The first phase involved killing his two roommates first and then luring victims into his apartment, wanting to slowly torture them before killing them.[292][293][294][295] In the second phase, which he dubbed the \"War on Women,\"[296][297][298] he aimed to target \"the very girls who represent everything I hate in the female gender,\" specifically focusing on the Alpha Phi sorority house, intending to kill as many occupants as possible before setting the building on fire.[299][300][301][302][303] In his final phase, Rodger planned to drive to his father's house and kill his stepmother and half-brother.[304][305][306] He would then steal their Mercedes-Benz and drive it to Isla Vista, shooting and hitting as many people as possible with their car.[56][307]\n\nRodger showed a section of his manifesto describing his childhood in England to his mother. Li Chin was impressed and encouraged him to keep writing.[11] Rodger's father knew that he had been writing something, but Rodger refused to show it to him. During a hike they took together before the attacks, Rodger's father expressed interest in what he was writing and asked if he could send it to him. Rodger brushed off the request, assuring his father that he would share it with him soon.[6]\n\nIn April, Rodger extended his preparations by visiting two additional gun ranges.[39][87] After Rodger posted multiple videos to his YouTube channel in the week leading up to April 26,[231] he hoped that a woman might see his videos and ask him out on a date. As this did not happen, Rodger planned to finish writing his manifesto and upload one last video minutes before he started his attack.[231][304] However, Rodger became sick with a cold on April 24, and his father returned early from his business trip, causing Rodger to question whether these events were a sign to abandon his plans. Consequently, he postponed the date by a month, settling on May 24, to allow recovery from his cold and more time to live.[87][308][309]\n\nIncidents before attacks\n\nOn April 30, Rodger's mother became worried after she had failed to contact him for several days.[11][310][311][312] Li Chin looked him up online and found the \"Why do girls hate me so much?\" video he had posted on YouTube. Becoming disturbed by the content, she tried calling her son again but he didn't answer. She then reached out to Linderman and told him what she found.[11][313][314][315][316] Linderman in turn contacted a crisis hotline and spoke with a staff member, voicing concerns about Rodger mentioning self-harm, causing the staff member to request a welfare check on Rodger.[11][317][318][319] Responding to the request, four sheriff's deputies, a university police officer and a dispatcher in training visited Rodger's apartment.[313][320][321]\n\nWhen the authorities arrived, Rodger stood at his apartments doorway and explained that the videos were his way of expressing his social difficulties in Isla Vista and that he had no intention of hurting anyone or himself.[313][322][323][324] A deputy asked Rodger to call his mother to update her on his situation. He did so, told her he was fine, and handed his phone to one of the deputies. The deputy asked his mother if the videos caused her concern about Rodger harming himself or others.[11][315][325] After she responded that she was not concerned, the deputies handed Rodger back his phone and he told his mother he would call her later. Because they did not enter Rodger's apartment, watch his videos, or check if he owned any weapons, they determined that he did not pose an immediate risk to himself or others. The deputies determined that Rodger did not meet the criteria for an involuntary hold and provided him with information on local support services.[11][326][327][328]\n\nRodger was relieved after the authorities left, as a search of his apartment would have uncovered his firearms and manifesto and thus thwarted his attack.[329][330][331] He maintained possession of a gun and several loaded magazines close at hand, and intended to use them if the police returned.[332][333] Rodger removed most of his videos from YouTube, believing the way he acted on them had raised suspicion that could potentially ruin his plans.[321][334][335] A Bodybuilding.com user noticed that Rodger had taken down most of his videos. Rodger responded saying his parents had forced him to remove them but that he intended to repost them.[121] He later added the same response in the description of one of his videos still up, mentioning the videos concerned some of his family members and would repost them later.[121][218][336][337] Rodger planned to re-post the videos in the days leading up to his attack in May.[321][338]\n\nThe following day, Rodger's mother contacted the counseling office at SBCC to report the incident, but was unable to get ahold of anyone. She felt relieved after hearing from her son again and planned to meet up with him a few weeks later at a sushi restaurant in Montecito with his sister.[11] As the pressure mounted in anticipation of his looming attack, Rodger turned to Xanax to alleviate his escalating anxiety.[38][339][340]\n\nThroughout May 2014, Rodger embarked on drives across Santa Barbara, enjoying his final weeks of life.[87] On May 6, he got involved in an altercation with a couple at Goleta Beach. When the boyfriend was attempting to reverse out of a parking spot, Rodger drove his BMW to block him. The girlfriend, observing from her vehicle, witnessed the fight from their respective cars. Rodger told the boyfriend, \"You're lucky to be an Asian guy dating a white girl. It's too bad she is such a horsefaced slut.\" After making the remark, he sped off. The boyfriend told the incident to his girlfriend, which frustrated her. She decided to pursue Rodger in her car. Upon catching up to him and attempting to confront him, Rodger said nothing, leaving the woman feeling uneasy, causing her to leave. As she drove away, she noticed Rodger speeding through the parking lot, almost hitting several cars in the process. The woman called 9-1-1, telling law enforcement about the situation and to search the area for a black BMW.[75][93]\n\nA week before his attacks, Rodger met his mother and sister for dinner at the sushi restaurant in Montecito. During their meal, he spotted a couple and quietly remarked to his mother that the man was too unattractive to be dating a blonde woman. His mother ignored his remark and shifted the conversation, feeling relieved to see her son again after April 30. Rodger's sister commented that he was eating more than usual, which made him scoff at her. Once they finished eating, Rodger and his family each went their separate ways.[11] On May 21, after being called a \"low-class incel\" on PUAHate, Rodger linked a video of himself, his father and stepmother at the Hunger Games premiere, saying:\n\nYou’re all jealous of my 10/10 pretty-boy face. This site is full of stupid, disgusting, mentally ill degenerates who take pleasure in putting down others. That is all I have to say on here. Goodbye.[11][38]\n\nOn May 22, Rodger reposted the \"Why do girls hate me so much?\" video on YouTube.[87] He then accessed Bodybuilding.com and PUAHate before discovering and viewing anxietyzone.com.[38][39] That same day, the video was posted on Reddit's \"r/cringe\" subreddit,[121][239] where a user compared Rodger to the fictional serial killer Patrick Bateman from the film American Psycho (2000).[341][342][343]\n\nAttacks\n\nMain article: 2014 Isla Vista killings\n\nApartment stabbings\n\nDespite initially selecting May 24 as the date for his attack, Rodger unexpectedly initiated his attacks a day earlier, on May 23.[87] He told his mother that his final day of school would be on May 23 and that he would be taking a test at SBCC. He said he would call her after he finished the test.[93] Before commencing his attacks, Rodger took Xanax and Benzodiazepine.[75][344][345][346][347] He looked up pornography online and searched the terms \"quiet silent kill with a knife\" and \"how to kill someone with a knife,\" before practicing stabbing on his bed sheets and pillows.[38][348][349][350]\n\nCarrying a six-inch \"SRK\" knife along with a nine-inch hunting knife, Rodger first ambushed Wang upon his return to the apartment. Wang tried to defend himself but was stabbed fifteen times, suffering twenty-three slashes.[38][39][75] Rodger then moved Wang's body to the corner of a bedroom and threw it on the floor facedown, partially covering it with blankets, towels and clothing.[38][39][75] Soon after Hong, still wearing his backpack after finishing class, entered the apartment and was immediately attacked by Rodger. Despite his attempts to defend himself, Hong was overwhelmed, receiving twenty-five stab wounds and twelve slashes,[11][39][75][351] with five of the stab wounds being inflicted postmortem on his back after he died.[39][345] Rodger dragged Hong's body to the same bedroom, throwing it face down halfway on top of Wang's body. He also concealed Hong's body with blankets and clothing.[38][39][75]\n\nThe final victim, 19-year-old George Chen, was a friend of Hong and Wang's who arrived at the apartment last to visit them.[352][353][354] Upon entering, Rodger ambushed Chen, unleashing a total of ninety-four stab wounds and eleven slashes as Chen attempted to defend himself.[75][355][356][357] Rodger left his body in a bathroom in a pool of blood. He attempted to clean the apartment and hide evidence of the earlier stabbings as each victim entered. He tried using bathroom towels and paper towels, but they quickly became soaked in blood. Despite his efforts, blood remained splattered on the hallways and walls.[38][39][75][358]\n\nAfter failing to clean the blood, Rodger changed out of his blood-drenched clothes and entangled them with his bed sheets. He showered and put on new clothes, going to Starbucks around 7:38 p.m.[11][359][360] He purchased a triple-vanilla latte while texting his mother saying he was done with school and would call her later.[11][361][362] He returned to his apartment and wrote in his diary:\n\nI had to tear some pages out because I feared my intentions would be discovered. I taped them back together as fast as I could. This is it. In one hour I will have my revenge on this cruel world. I HATE YOU ALLLL! DIE.[11][363]\n\nRodger emailed his 137-page manifesto to 34 people, including his parents, therapists, former teachers, and childhood friends with the message:[364][365][366]\n\nAttached is Elliot Rodger's life story, which explains how I came to be the way I am.[11]\n\nMinutes before his planned attack on Alpha Phi, Rodger uploaded a seven minute video on YouTube called \"Elliot Rodger's Retribution\".[367][368][369][370][371] Rodger recorded two takes of his \"Retribution\" video in his BMW, with the first attempt being interrupted by a passing jogger.[11] In the second take that he uploaded, Rodger is seen sitting in his BMW during a sunset, reciting scripted lines and letting out fake laughs.[372][373][374][375] Rodger explained in the video that he was frustrated that he was still a virgin at 22, that he would \"punish\" women for rejecting him despite being an \"alpha male\" and \"Supreme Gentleman\", and expressed his hatred for sexually active men.[376][377][378][379][380]\n\nShooting and vehicle attack\n\nRodger arrived at the Alpha Phi sorority house around 9:15 p.m. with the three semi-automatic pistols, additional ammunition strapped to his waist, and a full gas can.[11] The sorority house had a heavy wooden double door with an electronic keypad.[381][382] Rodger tried to open the door, pulling on the handle before typing on the keypad numerous times. He then aggressively knocked on the door for over three minutes. Approximately 40 residents of the sorority house were on a trip to Las Vegas, while the rest who stayed behind felt too tired to answer the door.[11][38][383][384][385] After no one answered, he became frustrated and set the gas can down.[11] Rodger returned to his car and, around 9:27 p.m., noticed three women walking near the Alpha Phi sorority house: 19-year-old Veronika Weiss, 22-year-old Katherine Cooper, and a 20-year-old woman, all members of the Delta Delta Delta sorority.[386][387][388][389] As the women were walking back to their Delta Delta Delta sorority house, Rodger slowly approached them in his car, and from an open window, fired multiple shots at them.[390][391][392][393] As Rodger sped away, the 20-year-old woman managed to go on her phone and call her mother, crying repeatedly that she was going to die.[394][395][396]\n\nPeople heard screaming and saw the three women bleeding on the grass, prompting them to rush to a sheriff's deputy for help. The deputy quickly arrived and applied pressure to the 20-year-old woman's wounds. One person began administering CPR to Cooper, and another tried to comfort Weiss by holding her head and speaking to her. More bystanders arrived, and the deputy told them to check if the women had a pulse and start chest compressions. Additional sheriff's deputies arrived and started helping, while another bystander used their sweatshirt to apply pressure to one of Cooper's gunshot wounds. Despite their efforts, Cooper and Weiss succumbed to their injuries.[75][397][398][399] Weiss was shot six times between her legs, with the fatal shot passing through her heart and both lungs. Cooper was shot eight times, suffering multiple fatal injuries, including gunshots to her lungs and the side of her head.[93][388] A bystander then took over the aid of the 20-year-old woman while the deputies chased down Rodger. The bystanders told the 20-year-old woman's mother on her phone that her daughter would survive.[38][75][361]\n\nAfter driving away from the sorority house, Rodger executed a three-point turn in a driveway along Pardall Road. Driving past a closed coffee shop on Pardall, he discharged a shot toward it.[361] Continuing his rampage, he proceeded to the IV Deli Mart, where he unleashed a barrage of gunfire at individuals nearby.[400][401][402][403][404] 20-year-old Christopher Michaels-Martinez was at the deli's entrance and turned around to look at Rodger's car when he was shot in the chest, resulting in injuries to his liver and the right ventricle of his heart.[92][405][406][407][408] Michaels-Martinez managed to stumble inside the deli but fell to the ground. Rodger continued to fire additional shots into the deli, shattering windows and sending people scrambling for cover.[38][361][409][410][411] Rodger then drove away and despite CPR attempts from five people, including a 19-year-old woman, Michaels-Martinez died.[405][406][412][413][414]\n\nAs he continued driving, Rodger struck a man with his vehicle and knocked him into the air.[361][415] While driving on Trigo Road, Rodger arrived at Pizza My Heart and opened fire on a couple exiting the restaurant.[93] The boyfriend was shot in the left arm, while the girlfriend sustained a gunshot wound to her upper right forearm.[75] The man ran in the opposite direction while the woman ran back into the restaurant. Rodger fired numerous shots into the restaurant before speeding away.[416][417] Driving on the wrong side of the road in Embarcadero del Norte, Rodger shot a female cyclist in the right thigh near a 7-Eleven.[75][93][415] He then encountered a woman walking alone. Rodger called out, \"Hey, what up?\", making the woman acknowledge him as she continued walking.[39][418][419] He raised a gun from his car window, leading the woman to initially believe it was an airsoft gun. Rodger then shot at her numerous times, narrowly missing her head, prompting her to run away and scream for help.[420][421][422][423]\n\nRodger then drove to Del Playa Drive, where he spotted a sheriff's deputy and fired multiple shots. As he sped away, the deputy returned fire, discharging a single round.[424][425][426] Continuing his rampage, Rodger struck two men with his car. He then drove to Camino Del Sur, where he shot a man in the right forearm and right buttocks. Rodger proceeded to Sabado Tarde, hitting a male cyclist and two male skateboarders. He encountered two men in a driveway and shot them multiple times.[75][93][426] Near Little Acorn Park, Rodger saw four sheriff's deputies and engaged in a shootout with three of them, during which he sustained a gunshot wound to the hip.[427][428][429] At around 9:37 p.m., Rodger turned onto several streets, putting the gun to his head and pulling the trigger,[11] causing his car to veer and hit another cyclist who tumbled on the vehicle and damaged the car's windshield. Rodger's car eventually crashed into another parked vehicle.[381] As law enforcement officers surrounded the car, they mistakenly handcuffed the injured cyclist, initially suspecting him to be a potential second assailant. Realizing their error, they gave him medical attention, acknowledging him as a victim rather than an accomplice.[430][431][432] Upon searching Rodger's vehicle, police discovered his lifeless body. They pulled it out and found a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Rodger's head.[381][433][434][435]\n\nVehicle search\n\nInside Rodger's car, authorities found a Glock 34 Long Slide handgun with seven loaded ten-round magazines, two SIG Sauer P226 handguns with 34 loaded ten-round magazines, over 500 additional rounds of live ammunition, and the two knives he used to kill his two roommates and their friend. The entire shooting spree unfolded within eight minutes, during which Rodger discharged approximately 55 9mm rounds.[361][436][437][438] During the shootings, Rodger used only one of the three pistols, one of the Sig Sauer P226, which was discovered on the driver's seat of his car.[92]\n\nVictims killed\n\nRodger's rampage resulted in the deaths of six people, all University of California, Santa Barbara students, with 14 others sustaining injuries, seven by gunfire and seven who were hit by Rodger's BMW.[439][440][441][442][443][444]\n\n20-year-old Weihan \"David\" Wang (July 6, 1993 - May 23, 2014), junior majoring in computer engineering[184][445][446][447][448][449]\n\n20-year-old Cheng Yuan \"James\" Hong (April 15, 1994 - May 23, 2014), junior majoring in computer engineering[445][446][450][451][452][453]\n\n19-year-old George Chen (September 14, 1994 - May 23, 2014), junior majoring in computer science[445][446][454][455][456][457]\n\n19-year-old Veronika Elizabeth Weiss (February 24, 1995 - May 23, 2014), freshman majoring in financial mathematics and statistics[446][458][459][460][461][462]\n\n22-year-old Katherine \"Katie\" Breanne Cooper (December 26, 1991 - May 23, 2014), senior double majoring in art history and classics[446][463][464][465][466][467]\n\n20-year-old Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez (December 23, 1993 - May 23, 2014), sophomore majoring in English[446][454][468][469][470][471]\n\nEvents after attacks\n\nAround 10 p.m., Rodger's mother received a text from Linderman, which she initially ignored. Linderman then called her, and when Li Chin answered, Linderman told her that her son had sent an email and advised her to check it. Rodger's mother quickly accessed the email and discovered his manifesto.[11][472][473][474][475] She also discovered her son's \"Retribution\" video online, prompting her to immediately call his phone that went to voicemail. Rodger's mother then called the Santa Barbara police, telling them she needed to locate her son.[11][231][476][477] She then called Rodger's father, who was having dinner with friends, to inform him of what she had found. Rodger's mother set off alone, while his father and Akaaboune and their friends traveled in another car, both parties racing toward Isla Vista.[478][479][480]\n\nAs they approached Isla Vista separately, Li Chin called Rodger's apartment building manager, asking them to check if her son was in his room. The manager informed her that there had been a shooting and car chase and they would have to wait until morning to check.[11] Li Chin then received a call from a sheriff's detective who asked her numerous questions, including whether her son had ever owned any guns. Li Chin was shocked by the inquiry, as her son had never shown any interest in guns.[6][11] She explained that he had social problems, saw a therapist, and that she had been unable to contact him. The detective instructed her to meet him at a Home Depot parking lot near Isla Vista. Li Chin arrived with Peter, Akaaboune, and their friends later showing up, and they waited until 1 a.m.[6][11] When a sheriff finally arrived, Li Chin demanded to know her son's whereabouts. The sheriff informed them that their son had been found dead, and his identity was confirmed by his driver's license. Devastated by the news of their son's death, his parents initially believed he was a victim. They remained unaware that he was the perpetrator until hours later when they saw reports on the internet.[6][11][481]\n\nApartment search\n\nLaw enforcement obtained a search warrant and conducted a protective sweep of Rodger's apartment on May 24 around midnight. They had grown concerned for the safety of Rodger's two roommates and feared that he might have set up booby traps in their apartment. After removing a window screen, authorities looked inside and found Chen's body lying in a fetal position on the bathroom floor.[92][93][482] They breached the apartment and also found the bodies of Hong and Wang in their bedroom.[93][482] When they searched Rodger's room, they discovered it to be a mess, finding pharmacy documents for prescriptions, two gun cleaning kits, empty ammo boxes and magazines, Monster Energy drinks, lottery tickets, a copy of The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene, various video games, and a Starbucks coffee cup.[38][75] Additionally, police discovered a folding knife, a \"zombie killer\" knife with a 10-inch blade, an 18-inch blade machete, a sledgehammer, and multiple other knives. Police discovered two journals in which Rodger expressed his growing frustration over his inability to form relationships with women. Alongside these, they found a hand-drawn illustration of a stabbing and a printed version of his 137-page manifesto. His laptop was found open to YouTube, displaying that his \"Retribution\" video had just finished uploading.[38][75][482]\n\nAftermath\n\nAuthorities and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives executed search warrants at the homes of Rodger's parents. They first visited his father's home in Woodland Hills, followed by a search at his mother's house in West Hills.[69][483] Authorities also obtained search warrants for the cell phone records of Rodger and his roommates. Upon examining Rodger's iPhone 4, they found over 492 images and videos, including more than 200 selfies.[38][484] Due to his attacks, Rodger's family was swarmed by the media and faced numerous death threats, forcing them to move every two days.[11][485] Li Chin became worried about her daughter's safety and sent her to temporarily live with family abroad. She and Peter stayed at a hotel and met up with friend's at a Denny's to discuss their situation.[11][90][486]\n\nAn autopsy of Rodger's body concluded that he died by suicide from a gunshot wound to the head.[345][487] In June 2014, his body was cremated and released from the coroner's office to his family. They held a private ceremony and had planned to hold a funeral in England later that year.[488] That same month, Peter met with Richard Martinez, the father of Michaels-Martinez, to discuss Michaels-Martinez and his life.[489][490][491][492][493] Rodger's father told Barbara Walters during an interview despite his son's long history of social struggles and years of therapy, he never thought his son was capable of murdering people and didn't see it coming. Peter explained that his son was good at hiding his true emotions and expressed sorrow for the pain caused to the victims' families, mentioning that he would help and prevent future mass killings.[494][495][496][497]\n\nLegacy\n\nRodger and his murder spree brought the incel community to mainstream attention, with it having been praised by young men around the world who identify as incels.[498][499][500][501][502][503] Incels referred to him as a \"saint\" and saw him as a \"hero\", celebrating \"Saint Elliot Day\" every anniversary of his attacks.[504][505][506][507][508][509] Incels also refer to Rodger as \"E.R.\", and his mass killings have inspired copycat crimes.[510][511][512][513][514][515] Rodger is frequently cited as an influence by incels involved in or suspected of other mass killings, often referring to their attacks as \"going E.R.\"[516][517][518][519][520][521] For example, on April 23, 2018, 25-year-old Alek Minassian killed eleven people and injured 15 others in Toronto, Canada, by driving a van into pedestrians.[522][523][524][525] Before his attack, Minassian posted on his Facebook profile:\n\nPrivate (Recruit) Minassian Infantry 00010, wishing to speak to Sgt 4chan please. C23249161. The Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys! All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger![526][527][528][529]\n\nSee also\n\nIncel\n\nMisogynist terrorism\n\nGun laws in California\n\nList of rampage killers in the United States"
