        "text": "Batavia, N.Y.\n\nEverything about Brian Downing Phillips was larger than life. When he walked into a room, he filled it up. Not because he routinely had to fold his 6’6” frame to fit into spaces, but because everything about Brian was big. He had the biggest and best laugh, deep from his core, infectious and warm, a huge, beautiful smile and a heart – that was greater than all his attributes combined. While he was quick to laugh, he also was quiet and introspective. It makes sense that when he was younger, he loved to write poetry. He was funny and smart, generous and kind. So much so, that Brian will continue to help others with the gift of sight having donated his eyes. After a brief illness, Brian died on August 22. He was 65.\n\nBrian loved to wander, to get in his car and drive the open road. He was eternally curious, attentive and interested. He loved basketball, football and baseball —especially The Bills and The Blue Jays. Mostly though, he loved his family, his wife, Bonnie, his best friend and younger sister, Karen, his second Mom, Bev Kuras, his daughter, Dakota, his step-children, Breanne Thornton-Harer (Andrew), Erik Thornton (Danielle), Keyrsten Wilde (Chris) and Austin Oklevitch, his step grandchildren, Allyson, Logan, Lathan and Lanah Thornton-Harer, Imogen and Ellerie Thornton and Milo Wilde-Wilson, his nephew, Daniel Gilbert, his many cousins and countless friends. And of course, his dogs, Charms and Chezlee and his ragdoll cat, Deja, who he loved dearly.\n\nAfter graduating Liverpool High School, Brian went on to become a star basketball player at Canisius College. He then held a variety of different jobs; he excelled at them all. He channeled his love of basketball into being a coach at Gloria J. Parks Community Center. He was a bouncer at Park Meadow and a salesperson at Raymour and Flanigan. But the job he loved most, was being the legendary bartender at PJ Bottoms.\n\nBrian is predeceased by his beloved parents, Marvin and Ida Phillips.\n\nIn lieu of flowers donations may be made to either his surviving spouse, Bonnie Phillips or to Connect Life, Western New York’s only community blood bank and federally designated not-for-profit organ procurement organization.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held in the near future.\n\nYour memories and condolences may be shared with Brian’s family at www.falconefuneralhome.com.\n\nLarry D.
