No. 36 - 551 - 26th Avenue\n\nBROKEN WATER MAIN RESCUE\n\nAppointed Engineer May 22, 1916\n\nAssigned to Engine Co. No. 29, 1917\n\nAssigned to Engine Co. No. 11, 1927\n\nAssigned to Engine Co. No. 36\n\nWATER MAIN TRAGEDY\n\nRESCUER DROPS DEAD\n\nTRAPPED WORKERS SAVED\n\nHERO PLUNGES INTO FLOODED EXCAVATION; HURT\n\nA premature flooding of a water main being installed on Fulton Street late yesterday caused the death of the fireman, nearly drowned the welder inflicted minor injuries on another workman.\n\nFireman Joseph Sullivan, attached to Engine 36 and living at 567 Eleventh Avenue, collapsed from a heart attack and fell off the fire truck just as it arrived at the scene. He was dead when picked up.\n\nTRAPPED FOR AN HOUR\n\nWalter Lynch, 33, of 1311 Van Ness Avenue, South, was trapped in the 20 inch pipe, with barely enough room to keep his nose above water, for more than hour before he was rescued.\n\nMitchell Johnson, 31, 909 Myrtle Street, Oakland, was treated for submersion, with Lynch, Park Emergency Hospital. Joseph dived into a flooded excavation to save Lynch’s life.\n\nFLOOD LET LOOSE\n\nLynch has entered the water main at an excavation in Fulton Street at Twenty-ninth Avenue, and had crawled through the pipe to Thirtieth Avenue to enamel “wells” in the main. While he was two to three hundred feet from the opening, another workman inadvertently knocked a plug from a fresh water main exposed in the Twenty-ninth Avenue excavation.\n\n.\n\nFred Sample, 127 Third Avenue, Oakland, also a welder, raced down to an air valve at Thirtieth Avenue, opened and shouted a warning to Lynch as Joseph struggled to shut off torrent.\n\nFANATIC DIGGING\n\nLynch had to wriggle backwards several yards to reach valve as the water rose in the pipe, but reached it in time keep on breathing. Rescuers passed whiskey down to him to keep him warm during the frantic work to open an excavation adjacent to the air valve.\n\nWhen the pipe, six feet below the surface of the street, was reached the hole was cut with acetylene torches and Lynch was dragged out.\n\nSource: San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco, 01 August 1936, page 3.\n\nExtracted from original sources with grammar and spelling as published."
