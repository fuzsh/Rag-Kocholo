        "text": "The applications for the 2024-2025 program are due on Monday, August 26th\n\nPLEASE NOTE BEFORE APPLYING:\n\nApplicants may apply to the screenwriting and or directing categories or to both programs, if they wish to apply to the two categories. We have had past students accepted into both programs, which means the participants write and then direct their own script.\n\n*Please note: You are allowed to apply as both a screenwriter and a filmmaker and can be accepted into both categories.\n\nYou may also apply with someone and send in an application as a directing and screenwriting pair with one person submitting a script and the other person submitting a film submission sample.\n\nPlease note: Students may not go participate in the same category twice.\n\nIf you are accepted as a screenwriter in the high school category, you may apply to the directing portion of the program the next year, but we cannot offer you the same placement as before â€“ in order to allow more students the opportunity to participate in the 10-10-10.\n\nHowever, if you participate as a high school student and then wish to apply again in college, you may do so.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email claire@sbiff.org\n\nEach year, SBIFF offers an outstanding, five month-long filmmaking program to 20 local students. We pair 10 high school and 10 college students into screenwriter-director duos and, with the help of professional filmmaking mentors, they work together to create 10 films that premiere at the historic Arlington Theatre during the International Film Festival!\n\nThis year SBIFF has partnered with the American Society of Cinematographers for additional professional workshops and a prize camera package for the two winning directing students to use on their next projects. Participants work together to bring their creative vision to life, and in so doing, learn skills that translate to better self-esteem, better self-expression, and future job readiness.\n\nEngaging with art is essential to the human experience, but quality arts education is often the most difficult to access, which is why SBIFF offers 10-10-10 absolutely FREE TO ALL STUDENT PARTICIPANTS!"
