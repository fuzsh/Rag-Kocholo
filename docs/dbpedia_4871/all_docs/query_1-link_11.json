They switched to the Saint Louis De Montfort Church and became more involved with the community. They took on many different leadership roles with Randall even joining the Knights of Columbus.

Despite this, he lived a full life, traveling to many parts of Mexico with his uncle Angel, selling furniture as his first job as a teen. When Jose was not accompanying uncle Angel on his work trips, he met his future wife and love of his life, Josefina, and started a relationship which lasted until Jose moved to Mexico City, where he lived with another uncle, Esteban. There, he worked as a factory worker at American Refrigeration Company in his early 20s in the late 1960s.\n\nIt was in Mexico City where uncle Esteban taught Jose strong moral values and ethics on how to be a better and kinder person. It was these lessons by uncle Esteban that helped shape and mold Jose into the man he was destined to be, where he was willing to help out anybody in need without thought of reward.\n\nDuring this time, uncle Angel and some of his cousins migrated to the US and invited Jose to come up north to work with them. Being the adventurous spirit, he went there to work as a laborer in Ojai, CA and worked there for 9 years before returning to Mexico and marrying Josefina in 1979.\n\nHe brought Josefina back, raised a family, and worked in Ojai, CA and eventually became a labor foreman at an orchard management company where he worked until his retirement. By this time he had saved enough to buy a house. Seeing that Ojai and Ventura County were expensive, he decided to move to Santa Maria, where he bought his retirement home in October 2023.\n\nGod called Jose home on May 4, 2024, and he is survived by his wife, Josefina, and his two sons, Carlos and Alberto.\n\nJose lived his life by the creed \"Eyes forward and without fear!”\n\nVisitation will begin at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, May 11, 2024; followed by a Scripture Service at 1:00 p.m. in the Chapel of Magner-Maloney Funeral Home.\n\nJosé Luna Morales, de 73 años, de Santa María, falleció el sábado 4 de Mayo de 2024.\n\nNació en Maravatio, Michoacán, México, en la colonia (barrio) de San Miguel Curahuango.\n\nDesde joven trabajó no sólo para sí mismo sino también para mantener a su familia. A pesar de esto, vivió una vida plena, viajando a muchas partes de México con su tío Ángel, vendiendo muebles como su primer trabajo cuando era adolescente. Cuando José no acompañaba al tío Ángel en sus viajes de trabajo, conoció a su futura esposa y amor de su vida, Josefina, e inició una relación que duró hasta que José se mudó a la Ciudad de México, donde vivió con otro tío, Esteban. Allí, trabajó como trabajador de una fábrica en American Refrigeration Company cuando tenía poco más de 20 años a finales de los años 1960.\n\nFue en la Ciudad de México donde el tío Esteban le enseñó a José fuertes valores morales y éticos sobre cómo ser una mejor y más amable persona. Fueron estas lecciones del tío Esteban las que ayudaron a moldear a José y convertirlo en el hombre que estaba destinado a ser, donde estaba dispuesto a ayudar a cualquiera que lo necesitara sin pensar en una recompensa.\n\nDurante este tiempo, el tío Ángel y algunos de sus primos emigraron a los Estados Unidos e invitaron a José a venir al norte para trabajar con ellos. Siendo de espíritu aventurero, fue a trabajar como obrero en Ojai, CA y trabajó allí durante 9 años antes de regresar a México y casarse con Josefina en 1979.\n\nTrajo a Josefina de regreso, formó una familia y trabajó en Ojai, hasta convertirse finalmente en capataz laboral. Trabajó hasta su jubilación y para entonces había ahorrado lo suficiente para comprarse una casa. Al ver que Ojai y el condado de Ventura eran caros, decidió mudarse a Santa María, donde compró su casa de retiro en Octubre de 2023.\n\nDios llamó a José a casa el 4 de Mayo de 2024 y le sobreviven su esposa, Josefina, y sus dos hijos, Carlos y Alberto.\n\nJosé vivió su vida según el credo \"¡Ojos adelante y sin temor!\"\n\nEl velorio comenzará a las 11:00 a. m. del Sábado 11 de Mayo de 2024; seguido de un Servicio Bíblico a la 1:00 p.m. en la Capilla de la Funeraria Magner-Maloney.\n\nsympathy note\n\nANTHONY \"A.J.\" URIBE\n\n1985 - 2024\n\nAnthony \"A.J.\" Uribe, 38, of Santa Maria, passed away Friday, May 3, 2024.\n\nVisitation will be from 4:00 p.m. until 8:00 p.m. on Thursday, May 16, 2024 in the Chapel of Magner-Maloney Funeral Home.

A native Californian, Minerva was born in Santa Maria on August 19, 1931 to parents Amos and Rebecca Dana. She was a direct descendant of Captain William Goodwin Dana and Maria Josefa Carrillo. The Dana-Carrillo family settled in Nipomo on their vast 38,000 acre Nipomo land grant during the 1830’s. The family was very influential in the early history of San Luis Obispo county and many of the descendants still live there. The family’s home, the Dana Adobe, is now a California Historical Landmark.\n\nMinerva was raised in Nipomo and Pismo Beach and later settled in Santa Maria for over 64 years. She was preceded in death by the love of her life, Louis Mike Rubcic, her oldest daughter Mary Rubcic Tawzer, who sadly passed away just one week before her, her oldest sister Luisitia, youngest brother Amos Dana, and Luke Rubcic, her grandson.\n\nMinerva leaves behind one younger sister, Francis Dana Johnson, one younger brother David Dana, and five grandchildren, Becky, Lanny, Clay, Ariana, and Robert (RW). She also leaves behind six great grandchildren, JD, Danica, Braxton, Sadie, Claire, and Tiffany. Kadence is expected to arrive on April 1st.\n\nMinerva’s childhood was filled with delightful adventures on the family ranch with her inseparable siblings. She loved to tell stories of the idyllic California life she led and how magical the era was in every way.\n\nMinerva graduated from Arroyo Grande High School in 1949. During high school she played first clarinet in the school band and fondly reminisced about all the fun she had during their performances. After graduating, she attended college in Santa Barbara majoring in early childhood education before deciding to return home a year later to be closer to her family and attend Cuesta College. It was during this time when she met her husband to be, Louis Mike Rubcic, who was attending Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. They fell in love and were married on June 11, 1955 in the Catholic Church in Pismo Beach.\n\nA year later, Mary Francis was born (married to Kenny Tawzer), the next year Michael Amos was born (married to Andra Metz). A year after that Anna Louise arrived and a little over a year later David Louis (married to Kristi Abrams), the youngest of her kids, entered this world. Having four kids in five years proved to be a welcome challenge for Minerva. With loving and devoted care and attention she raised all four of her children to be fine upstanding citizens. She was very proud of us and counted these blessings as her most significant life accomplishments. When time permitted, she took a job as a sales clerk specializing in women’s clothing. Minerva worked for many years at Peggy’s Fashion, Holsers, and Gottschalks where she was loved and respected by her friends, customers, and colleagues.\n\nAt home Minerva loved to cook and was known for her beef stew cooked in a pressure cooker the old family way. Her fried chicken was, for many, the best they had ever tasted. At many of the family picnics, especially the 4th of July celebration in Pismo Beach, she always made extra for all the family and friends who accompanied them. Minerva was the consummate mother and friend to all of them.\n\nAs life rolled on, she took on the leadership role when her husband of 31 years, Louis Mike Rubcic, passed away suddenly at the age of 54. Her family rallied around her in this sad time and stayed close as she continued on for the next 38 years. We are grateful for the strength and courage Minerva displayed and use her fine example of perseverance in our own lives. She never gave up and we are our best because of this.\n\nMinerva epitomized the role of the Divine Mother. Her character was defined by the virtues she held firmly in her noble heart and soul. She was, without a doubt, kind, polite, friendly, honest, and generous in all she did. Her loving compassionate nature radiated an aura of holiness. These virtues contributed to the tremendous self-confidence that enabled Minerva to sustain peace and inner happiness. We will all be eternally grateful for the impact she had in our lives and will carry these gifts forward as we continue on, knowing she will always be with us in spirit. I’m sure those she left behind will remember her lovingly in this way and be fortified no matter how hard life becomes. Thank you for being so wonderful and for a whole lifetime of joy. You are truly an angel from heaven.\n\nService Schedule:\n\nMonday, March 25, 2024 at the Chapel of Magner-Maloney Funeral Home\n\nFamily Visitation: 3p - 4p\n\nPublic Visitation: 4p - 5p\n\nRosary: 5p\n\nTuesday, March 26, 2024 at the Chapel of Magner-Maloney Funeral Home\n\nScripture Service: 10a\n\nInterment will follow in the Santa Maria Cemetery\n\nsympathy note\n\nSISTER ANTOINETTE NAVARRO, OSF\n\n1929 - 2024\n\nMaria Socorro Navarro was born to Salome and Antonio Navarro on February 23, 1929 in Los Angeles, CA. and died at Marian Convent in Santa Maria, CA on Saturday, March 16, 2024. She was the oldest of ten siblings, three other sisters and six brothers. The Catholic faith was a part of the daily life of this family, so it was no surprise when Maria Socorro entered the novitiate of the Sisters of St. Francis of Penance and Christian Charity in February of 1949 in Sierra Madre, CA. Antoinette became her religious name after her father, and St. Anthony of Padua, to whom she had a life-long devotion. She professed her perpetual vows on August 17, 1954 and embarked on a ministry of nursing. As one of her brothers said years later: “She wrote the nursing book before she studied with all the experience she had caring for all the cuts and bruises of her younger siblings.” She earned an RN degree from Mt. St. Mary’s College in 1955. Her nursing ministry was exercised in various ways as Director of Nursing, Head Surgical Nurse, Nursing Director of Pediatrics and Director of Emergency Room Nursing. Some of the places she served included Sacred Heart Hospital in Havre, Montana, St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood, CA, Rancho Los Amigos County Hospital in Downey, CA and Marian Medical Center in Santa Maria, CA. For nearly ten years she ministered as a Social Worker at St. Francis Center in downtown Los Angeles as Director of Services. From 1969 to 1972 she ministered as nurse and midwife in Orizabita, Mexico. Her gift for Spiritual Direction was used at St. Joseph’s Seminary in Mountain View followed by another nursing ministry in the infirmary of the Franciscan Friars in Santa Barbara. Moving to Arizona in 1995 she served as the parish nurse at St. Steven’s Church in Sun Lakes until 2002. From 2002 to 2010 she volunteered at Marian Medical Center in the Social Services Department. Officially retired in 2010, she lived in the Rosemead/greater Los Angeles area including Hermosa Beach, until September of 2022 when she moved to Marian Convent with her cockatiel “Bird”. She is survived by all her brothers and two of her sisters, as well as the Sisters of her religious community. Her quiet, unassuming, loving presence endeared her to everyone around her.

FRANTA, SR.\n\n1926 - 2024\n\nIt is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our father, Robert Rudolph Franta. Robert (Bob) was born in St. Louis, MO on August 17, 1926, to Rudolph and Laura (Roe) Franta. An only child, he lost his father, Rudoph R, in 1939 at age 12. The death of his father meant that he and his mother were left to fend for themselves during one of the most difficult times in our country's economic history. Our father however, was the epitome of the \"World's Greatest Generation\" He worked hard, completed high school and before graduation Bob signed up for the Navy to serve his country in the World War II efforts even though as the only son of a widow he could have easily gotten a deferment.\n\nHe worked hard and enjoyed his time as a service man. He was assigned to the radio core which was a cover for radar operators and involved a high pressure school with low test scores kicking one out of the program and sending them to the front. He prevailed and shipped out of Treasure Island for the Pacific theater as a member of the Radio operators on the USS Dolphin. When the war was over Bob was sent home almost immediately which allowed him to enroll, via the GI Bill, in college.\n\nBob graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, MO in 1950, the first member of his family to earn a college degree. He worked hard in school, but also found time to enjoy college life, fraternity endeavors, and meet the love of his life, Florence Miller. Even 75 years later he remembered the exact location and circumstances of meeting her in front of the library’s Ridgely columns. They were married in 1951 and began their family a few years later. A partnership that lasted 67 years.\n\nHe provided well for his family. He stated one of his goals was to live long enough to see his children graduate from high school, which he did and then some. He took his family on fun vacations, camping in national parks, on remote islands in the boundary waters of Minnesota and by many lakes and streams. He taught his oldest son to fish and hunt. He trained 2 hunting dogs/family pets, a black lab named Ebony and a Golden retriever named Sandy\n\nUpon graduating from Washington University with his Bachelor of Electrical Engineering Bob began his long and successful career first in Electrical Engineering with General Electric and later Aerospace Engineering. Some highlights of various companies he worked for include his years at Honeywell, Minneapolis MN, where he was part of the collaborative efforts to successfully launch Apollo 11. In 1967, Bob moved his family out west. settling in Santa Maria, CA to pursue his career in the growing space industry at Vandenberg Air Force Base, (now Vandenburg Space Force Base) He worked at ITT FEC for ten years. He then continued his career with Northrop, North American, Rockwell and Boeing. He was integral to projects developing guidance systems for missiles, design work on the Hubble telescope, and finally the B-1 Bomber simulator. When asked a few years ago what was the most fun he had he stated “flying the B-1 bomber simulator…it was a neat airplane” When asked if he ever crashed the simulator he answered in the affirmative.\n\nBesides being a contributing member of the local space efforts, Bob was involved in his community and especially the Orcutt Presbyterian Church where he was a member for 54 years. There he made many friends, taught Sunday school, served as an elder and a deacon, helped with work crews and church projects, participated in many church functions, and joined several bible study groups. He volunteered with the local Robotics club helping future engineers develop their practical skills. He and Florence also participated in local Swing Dance classes, he played golf with friends, attended most of his children's school functions, and continued to hunt and fish. Bob enjoyed gardening, even planting trees into his 90s. He was always well informed regarding political and world events, kept abreast of the burgeoning development in many of the sciences and could converse knowledgeably on a vast variety of topics. Although always an exacting scientist he maintained a strong and life long Christian faith which shaped much of his morals. He had strong beliefs in the fallibility of men, the need for Christ’s forgiveness and the hope of life everlasting.\n\nBob and Florence had 4 children, Robert Jr., Carol (Davis), Betsi (Parker) and James. Bob is preceded in death by Robert Jr. and Florence, great grand daughter Adelaide Davis, his parents and many family members.

In 2000, he made a dream a reality and bought his first Harley Davidson Motorcycle, later going on to own a Screaming Eagle Harley Davidson. He made several long runs to Sturgis for the famous, annual motorcycle rally as well as to Laughlin, NV and all over California. When he couldn’t be behind the wheel, he built and raced remote control cars with his brother-in-law in the streets of their neighborhood. If it had wheels, Doug wanted to drive it.\n\nDoug had a passion for life, enjoyed socializing, and was the life of the party. He loved to set off fireworks, crank the stereo all the way up, and dance the night away. He was an animal lover, especially his own dog, Coco, his companion, and shadow.

Her French mother, who was a seamstress, came to the States through Ellis Island in 1914. When Dolores was 2 years old, the family moved to Southern France. She also spent time in Spain visiting family in Barcelona. She grew up speaking English, French, and Spanish.\n\nLiving in Europe as fear of World War II was increasing, her Cuban father moved the family to Cuba in 1938. They spent a few years there until her father, who was a painter, got a job representing Cuba in the Pan-American Pavilion at the 1939/40 World’s Fair in New York. They moved again, back to New York, and lived there until 1942. They returned to Cuba, and Dolores studied at the Normal School to be a teacher. Living in Santiago de Cuba in 1952, she met the love of her life, Luis Segui, and they were married shortly after. They had 3 children, Loly (1953), Luisin (1958), and Betty (1968).\n\nIn 1968 she and her family were repatriated to the USA, and moved to southern California where her half-brother Carlos Scuria and his family lived in Thousand Oaks. The Segui family settled in Santa Maria, and with the help of generous family and neighbors, found a house to rent and employment. Dolores started working at the baby store Stork Shop and then began a 17 year career as a bilingual eligibility worker with Santa Barbara County’s Department of Social Services, where she retired in 1992 at the age of 65. Her co-workers referred to her as the “Queen of the AFDC” (Aid for Families with Dependent Children) and wrote a song which was sung by all at her retirement party.\n\nDolores was always actively volunteering, serving as an ESL tutor at the Friends of the Library and the Central Coast Literacy Council, an aide at the Santa Maria Public Library, and director of the St. John’s Center. Being of strong faith as a Catholic all her life, the Seguis joined St. Mary’s Church in 1969 and then in 1986, Dolores and Luis moved to the new St. John Neumann’s church. For 17 years she served as the Council Secretary and served many years as an usher. Through her 90s she also volunteered at Marian Hospital on the Labor and Delivery floor.\n\nDolores enjoyed many hobbies throughout her life: stamp collecting, sewing, knitting, and crocheting. She was an avid reader, always with a library book in her car. She would intentionally arrive early to things so she could sit in her car and read. She loved playing board games with her family and loved all types of puzzles, Sudoku and Cipher being her favorites. She was working on a favorite Dowdle 500 piece jigsaw puzzle the week before she died. Given that her husband Luis always had a camera in his hand, Dolores made photo albums for every family member, including ones for herself.\n\nIn November of 2002, Dolores and Luis celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary, with a renewal of vows and a luncheon.
