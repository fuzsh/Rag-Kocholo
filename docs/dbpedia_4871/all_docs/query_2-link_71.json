        "text": "John Patrick Sullivan, 76, of Plainville, passed away peacefully on Friday, January 3, 2020 following a long battle with Parkinson’s disease that he endured with much strength and optimism. John was born in County Kerry, Ireland on June 17, 1943, and came to the United States at the age of 10. He was the first of many generations of Sullivans to settle on Dogwood Rd, and was a 1963 graduate of Plainville High School. Excelling at track and cross country, he broke many records and was instrumental in leading the team to the state championship in 1961, for which he was inducted into the Plainville High School Sports Hall of Fame in 2011. Eager to serve his country, John became a citizen just days before leaving for duty with the US Army during the Vietnam War. Honorably discharged as a Sergeant in 1971, he returned to his hometown where he raised his son and became a much loved “Pop”. Known to give his heart and soul into every endeavor, John worked for Philip Morris until his retirement, where he was consistently recognized as a top sales executive. In addition to being a long time coach within the Plainville Little League, John was an active volunteer of PARC alongside his lifelong best friend, Frank Robinson, and worked tirelessly setting fundraising records for the organization. He was honored with an award in his name, given to individuals and organizations that share in his principles, and was the recipient of the Plainville Citizen Volunteer of the Year award in 2005. His work is now done, but will forever be remembered by his family, friends and community.\n\nJohn leaves his mother, Eileen of Plainville; his devoted son, Sean, his wife, Catherine, and their daughter, Isabel, who brought him much joy. He also leaves his former wife and longtime friend Christine Sullivan of Plainville and longtime companion Chris Howland who stood by him through thick and thin; his sisters and brothers-in-law, Margaret and Cliff Czellecz of Plainville, Ann-Marie and John Rossley of Farmington and Irene and James Herrera of Stonington; and his sister-in-law, Jean Sullivan of Enfield. He was the proud uncle to Joseph Sullivan, Craig Czellecz, John Rossley, Kevin Czellecz, Daniel Rossley, Michael Rossley, Maureen Herrera, Kara Virello, and Michael Ouchakof and their families. He was predeceased by his father George and his brother George Declan Sullivan.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, John may be remembered with contributions to PARC, 28 East Maple St, Plainville or www.parcdisabilitiesct.org\n\nFamily and friends may gather in celebration of John’s life on Friday, January 10, 2020, from 4-7 p.m. at Plainville Funeral Home, 81 Broad St, Plainville. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held on Saturday at 10 a.m., meeting directly at St. Patrick-St. Anthony Church, 285 Church St, Hartford. Committal services with military honors will follow at Mount St. Benedict Cemetery, Bloomfield."
