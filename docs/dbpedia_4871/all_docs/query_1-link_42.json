He was eighty-eight and a resident of New York City.\n\nWhile at Kenyon, Frank was a member of Phi Kappa Sigma. According to the New York Times, his claim to fame at Kenyon was that after forgetting to study for an examination in medieval English literature, he made up a wild story about dragons. The professor gave him an A+ and wrote, \"You write most entertainingly on a subject you know nothing about.\" Frank left Kenyon in the middle of his junior year because of financial difficulties resulting from the Depression and completed his education at Ohio State University in 1934.\n\nFrank then took a job as an office boy at Time, Inc., where his responsibilities included sharpening Henry Luce's pencils. He rose through the ranks to the position of circulation director of Life magazine. After four years in the Army Air Corps, he returned to Time to be circulation-promotion manager of Fortune magazine from 1949 to 1957, the heyday of direct-mail subscription sales.\n\nFrank, a pioneer in direct-mail advertising, found novel ways to grab readers' attention. His correspondence invaded millions of homes, and because of many people's resentment of this invasion, he strove to show his readers respect. Frank assumed that people had dictionaries and flattered their intelligence by refusing to talk down to them. Modest about his accomplishments in the field, he said, in a 1999 interview with Boardroom magazine, \"Direct mail has been written for many years before any of us were born, and we all swiped from whomever the originators were.\"\n\nThough Frank wrote thousands of letters over the signatures of company or organization heads, he sometimes used the name David Forrest, a name he made up and never explained. According to his daughter, Judith Thoms, while nobody knew who he was, unless they thought he was David Forrest, he received a steady stream of fan mail.\n\nIn 1957, Frank joined a group of former executives from Time to start American Heritage Publishing Company. He wrote and managed the advertising campaigns for American Heritage and its sister magazine, Horizon, as well as promoting dozens of books published by the company.\n\nAfter twenty years with American Heritage, Frank became a freelance consultant. He counted among his clients the Audubon Society, the Bronx Zoo, the Guggenheim and Metropolitan museums, Harper's, Ms, and Newsweek.\n\nIn addition to his daughter Judith, Frank is survived by another daughter, Deborah Johnson; a son, Allan Johnson; and six grandchildren.\n\nHawthorne expert C.E. Frazer Clark '51 dies at seventy-five\n\nC.E. Frazer Clark Jr. '51 on June 9, 2001. He was seventy-five and a resident of AuTrain, Michigan.\n\nFrazer initially enrolled at the University of Michigan but soon left to join the U.S. Army. He served in the 87th Infantry Division and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. After the war, Fraser enrolled at Kenyon, where he developed an interest in Nathaniel Hawthorne that continued into graduate school at Wayne State University.\n\nWhile writing his thesis on Hawthorne, Frazer was employed at Charles S. Boesen's antiquarian book store in Detroit, where he was transformed from a Hawthorne buff into a serious collector when he found a previously undiscovered first edition of The Scarlet Letter, signed by the author. He amassed the most comprehensive research archive of Hawthorne's works ever, collecting books and other memorabilia and artifacts about the author. Frazer, who lectured widely on Hawthorne, was a bibliographer and a friend of libraries, including Kenyon's, to which he donated the one-hundred-volume series Dictionary of Literary Biography and the series companion, the DLB Yearbook.\n\nFrazer, who wrote Nathaniel Hawthorne: A Descriptive Bibliography, published in 1978, ultimately owned every separately published work of Hawthorne, save two. In 1989, he donated his thirty-thousand-item Hawthorne collection of books and artifacts, dividing them between the House of the Seven Gables and the Peabody Essex Institute, both located in Hawthorne's birthplace, Salem, Massachusetts.\n\nFrazer wrote bibliographical and biographical articles about the author and catalogued Hawthorne exhibits that he mounted around the world. The catalogues were usually designed by his wife, Margaret Ann Clark, who survives him.\n\nFrazer was cofounder, with Matthew Bruccoli of the University of South Carolina, of Bruccoli Clark Publishing, which began as a publisher of annuals and limited editions of unpublished writings of authors such as Robert Coover, James Gould Couzzens, and James Dickey.\n\n\"It was Frazer who took me under his wing the night of the Old Kenyon fire,\" recalls classmate Will Pilcher '51. \"I went home with him to 'T' barracks. After a sleepless night, I took the bus home to McArthur, Ohio, where my father, LeRoy Pilcher '17 was, unknown to me at the time, dying of pancreatic cancer. When I got back, I lived with Frazer until the Alumni House was ready to take in many of the fire's survivors for the balance of the year.\"\n\nIn addition to his wife, Frazer is survived by two sons, Douglas A. and C.E. Frazer Clark III, a grandson, and a brother and a sister. Memorial contributions may be made to the House of the Seven Gables, 54 Turner Street, Salem, Massachusetts 01970.\n\nPublic relations whiz Patrick Jackson '54 is dead at sixty-eight\n\nPatrick J. Jackson 1954 died on March 22, 2001. He was sixty-eight and a resident of Rye, New Hampshire.\n\nPat enrolled at Kenyon as a married student with a newborn son. Despite having to work nearly full time to support his family, he played football and joined Delta Kappa Epsilon. Pat left Kenyon after two years because of financial difficulties, but he went on to earn a master's degree in organizational development from Antioch University in 1979.\n\nJohn F. Barton '54 was a high-school acquaintance of Pat and his first wife, Shirley. \"We became good friends at Kenyon, where I visited them in the quonset huts designated for married-student housing,\" said Barton. \"I'm so glad he won recognition for his work in public relations. News of his death brought back memories of those Kenyon times, when we were young and eager to get on with our lives.\"\n\nPat founded Jackson Jackson and Wagner (JJ&W), a behavioral public-relations management consulting firm in 1956, and became one of the most widely known and respected practitioners in the field. Often referred to as \"the public-relations counselor's counsel,\" he was respected by his peers for his passion for advancing the profession and his involvement in the education of practitioners and students.\n\nUnder Pat's leadership in the 1960s and 70s, JJ&W concentrated on public interest and activist groups in the civil liberties, civil rights, consumer, and other movements. It is considered the first public-relations firm to practice in the area of environmental issues and grassroots movements, beginning in 1964.\n\nJJ&W's research subsidiary, Dudley Research, was founded in 1982 with a philosophy based on the premise that true public-relations research is \"rooted in what motivates a person to act.\"\n\nPat was an editor for pr reporter for more than three decades. The newsletter is one of the foremost international public-relations journals, featuring cutting-edge theories and advice.\n\nPat was elected in 1980 to serve as president of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA). He served as a trustee on numerous boards, including those of Antioch University, the First Amendment Congress, and the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests.\n\nPat is survived by his wife, Stacey E. Smith, and their children, Alexandra and Jeremy, as well as daughters Pamela Sadler and Roberta Trefts; sons Richard W. and Kevin S. Jackson; twenty-one grandchildren; eight great-grandchildren; and a brother T. Michael Jackson. Memorial contributions may be made to the Patrick Jackson Memorial Fund, PRSA Foundation, 33 Irving Place, New York, New York 10003, or the New Hampshire Environmental Foundation, c/o JJ&W, 14 Front Street, Exeter, New Hampshire 03833.\n\nRichard Golumb '67, baby boomer symbol, dies at fifty-five\n\nRichard Golomb '67 succumbed to colon cancer on August 14, 2001. He was fifty-five and a resident of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nA biology major at Kenyon, Richard was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity.\n\nRichard had an interest in wildlife from an early age and after graduation from Kenyon he took a job as a zoologist for the Pittsburgh Children's Zoo. Although he was enthusiastic about the work, he was also a married man with children and found the job did not provide enough income to support a family. Richard tried a stint in his family's glass and paint business, but found it unfulfilling. When he was thirty, already divorced and the veteran of two career attempts, he started dating a woman who was a photographer. She inspired him to try photography as a career, and it was as a commercial photographer that Richard found success. He also achieved recognition for his personal photographic work, which often included close-up images of the natural world.\n\nRichard never abandoned his passion for wildlife, and he raised boa constrictors, exotic frogs, lizards, pythons, and tortoises for thirty years.\n\nA natural athlete, he took up tennis at the age of twenty-five and, without so much as a lesson, became a nationally ranked amateur. Also a runner, he ran in Pittsburgh's Great Race from its inception until he was diagnosed with colon cancer in early 2000.\n\nHis friend Ronald C. Weingrad '67 writes, \"I had enriching and funny experiences with Richard that are too numerous to mention. His sense of humor and his love of family and life made for a person who will be missed by everyone who crossed his path. He enriched us all by his presence, sometimes without anyone even knowing it. During his life, Richard made many anonymous donations to the poor and suffering because, as he often said, 'I've been blessed by my membership in the lucky sperm club and most people cannot say the same.'\"\n\nIn 1995, Richard was the subject of one of a series of articles in the Wall Street Journal on baby boomers turning fifty. Reflecting on the decline in health of his parents, and the reality that he had more years behind him than ahead, he said, \"I don't want to lose the capacity to be amused, joyful, in awe of the world.\" His regrets centered on his failed marriages, although his wives were never bitter and, in fact, provided care in his last illness. Ironically, Richard was quoted in the article as saying, \"I've seen an awful lot of people put things off and then the Fates intervened.\" He spent a great deal of time valuing his family and friends just in case.\n\nRichard is survived by his wife, Sharon Voas; two daughters, Lisa Golomb Zaretsky and Alice Golomb; two grandchildren; and a brother, Louis Golomb.\n\nJoshua H. Kaneko '27 on January 8, 1997.

He continued his education at Ohio State University, Columbia University, and Oxford University. From 1929 until 1966, Joshua was a professor at St. Paul's University; in 1971, he moved to Tsuru Bunka College in Yamanashi Prefecture, where he remained until his retirement in 1978. In addition to his teaching, Joshua was director of Jomo Airinsha, a private social-welfare agency in his native city of Maebashi.\n\nJoshua was the author of Manjiro, The Man Who Discovered America, published in 1956. The true story recounts the life of Nakahama Manjiro, a fourteen-year-old Japanese fisherman's son who was shipwrecked in 1841 and rescued by the captain of an American whaler. After becoming the first Japanese to be educated in the United States, he returned to Japan, despite the threat of execution, to help bring his people into the modern world.
