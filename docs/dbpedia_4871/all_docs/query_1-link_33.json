        "text": "Biographical Note\n\nMargaret Sue Sullivan, PhD (January 4, 1935- December 27, 2012) was a teacher and literary scholar. Through her research, she became friends with Carson McCullers (1917-1967) and Lillian Smith (1897-1968), among other notable Southern writers.\n\nAccording to her obituary in the Columbus Ledger Enquirer, Sullivan was born January 4, 1935 to Cora Howell and Jordan James Sullivan in Green Mountain, North Carolina. Her siblings were Dr. James Howell Sullivan (April 1, 1931-October 2, 2008), who was married to Margaret \"Bunny\" Thomas Sullivan (November 9, 1933-February 12, 2009); Nancy Sullivan Bush (July 9, 1935-November 25, 1999), who was married to John Bush; and Patricia Sullivan Conner (November 23, 1936-March 26, 2003), who was married to Frank H. Conner, Jr.\n\nMargaret (known as \"Margie\" to family and friends) and her family moved to Chipley (now Pine Mountain), Georgia in her early years before settling in Columbus, Georgia. She was a 1952 graduate of Columbus High School. She graduated from Duke University in 1956 and returned to Columbus to teach at Jordan High School and to pursue her Master's Degree at Auburn University. She then became a Professor of English at Auburn and taught her favorite subject, Southern Women's Literature. She was an authority on many southern writers, especially Carson McCullers, to whose life and works she devoted years of research, as she did as well to Lillian Smith and her works. During her research she became friends with both McCullers and Smith, as well as with Dr. Mary E. Mercer (1911-2013) and Paula Snelling (1899-1985), the executors of the McCullers and Smith estates, respectively.\n\nSullivan returned to Duke University, receiving her doctorate in English Literature from Duke in 1966. Her thesis was on Carson McCullers. She was a professor of English at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. until she returned to Columbus to live in 1972, partly due to poor health, having been diagnosed with lupus, which she fought the rest of her life.\n\nShe was a member of St. Luke United Methodist Church in Columbus for 68 years, was an active member of the French Lit Club and in years past, Mensa. She also lectured on Carson McCullers and was active with the Springer Opera House, Elderhostel of Columbus and other local organizations. She died on December 27, 2012 and is buried in Parkhill Cemetery in Columbus, Georgia.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThese papers include Sullivan's school papers, research materials (mainly focusing on Carson McCullers and Lillian Smith) from graduate school through her later life, newspaper clippings of local and national events, copies of her dissertation, and a varied and voluminous correspondence.\n\nBelow are two lists of selected correspondents; one alphabetically by signature and the other by last name, if known:\n\nSelected Correspondents of Margaret S.

Fifty eight were identified as having been created by Dr. Sullivan in the process of her research on Carson McCullers, including 57 cassette tapes and 1 reel-to-reel tape. In 2018/2019 the CSU Archives had these recordings digitized. Dr. Sullivan's labels, placed on each side of each recording, were photographed and included (if extant) as part of the digital preservation process. The reel-to-reel tape is of Carson McCullers dictating letters.\n\nThe cassette tapes mostly consist of Dr. Sullivan reading from McCullers' correspondence and papers in the 1960s in McCullers home in Nyack, New York. In addition to this set of tapes there are also 2 cassettes recorded in September of 1977 of David Diamond reading from his diary entries from 1940/1941 about his meeting the McCullers and his subsequent affair with Reeves; a cassette tape made of an interview with Helen Harvey, a close childhood friend of McCullers; and one of a group discussion among three other friends of both Reeves and Carson McCullers. Dr. Sullivan also mistakenly used the same numbers for two cassette tapes (Tape 7 and Tape 8). The two relating to Annemarie Schwarzenbach have been removed from the set of recordings made in McCullers' Nyack house and placed with the three items list above at the end of this description.\n\nAfter the digitization, an archives processor listened to 19 of the recordings and made notes of their contents. These notes should be, in most cases, taken as paraphrases and not verbatim transcriptions. In all cases, Sullivan included the name of the correspondent, their return address, the date and the complete document. She would also include editorial asides, such as \"Now this is an important letter\" or offer her opinion of the full name of someone mentioned in passing by a nickname or first name only in a letter. All 58 of the tapes have been uploaded to the CSU Digital Archives, and the others are being listened to and transcribed as time allows. Many of those only paraphrased also cry out to be full transcribed, such as the letters recorded on Side B of tape 12 from Janet Flaner and others just after the death of Reeves McCullers. The letters from John L. Brown and his wife Simone which are on Side A of tape 12 are also epistolary masterpieces. The processor's paraphrases do not do them justice. Much of the materials read by Sullivan are now in the Carson McCullers collection of the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas-Austin.\n\nBoth sides of each one of the 58 tapes have been uploaded and are available for listening. All 58 have the metadata as supplied by Dr. Sullivan, if extant, but as of April 2019 only the 19 tapes mentioned above have been described and given more detailed metadata such as fuller titles and tags. This fuller metadata includes expanding (and in a few cases correcting) Dr. Sullivan's abbreviations, such as \"The Member of the Wedding\" for her \"MW\", or \"Annemarie Schwarzenbach\" for her \"Anne Marie\". The processor also standardized the labeling of the tape sides, so they all say Side A or Side B (rather than the occasional Side 1 or Side 2). Dr. Sullivan also labeled two tapes as #7 and that has been dealt with as well.\n\nThe fact that Dr. Sullivan grew up only 18 years later than Carson McCullers in the same part of Columbus, Georgia as McCullers and also attended the same schools means that they both had a very similar enunciation, pronunciation and accent. It is almost as if one were hearing the voice of Carson McCullers herself.\n\nThe links below connect to Dr. Sullivan's digital recording files as well as a photograph of her original label for each digitized tape. To the extent possible, the numbering arrangement of Dr. Sullivan is followed, although in those cases where her labels are missing and in the case when she used the same number twice changes were made to the labels. The resource number to which the items below are linked was determined by the order of digitization.\n\nThe processor has standardized the dating of each item. Dr. Sullivan variously expressed dates. She might say August 9 1958 or August 9th 1958 or 9 August 1958 pr 8/9/1958 or use the abbreviation '58 in any of those situations. Below they are expressed as name of month, date and year, as August 9, 1958. This is followed by the name of writer (if known) and the writer's address (if given), the name of the person address and the address (if given). Sullivan's non-substantive remarks, such as \"Now here's a letter from . . . \" are omitted. Substantive remarks are placed within brackets, such as [This letter is incomplete, the third page is missing]. Processor's notes are also placed in brackets, but are differentiated from Sullivans comments by including the words \"Processor's note\" before the comment, such as [Processor's note -- These words are nearly inaudible, but may be . . . ].\n\nReel-to-Reel Tape\n\nReel-to-Reel Tape 1 - Side A - Carson McCullers dictating letters -- 1 minute, 32 seconds\n\nSullivan's Label: #25 [crossed out] Carson, Track 1, Dec. 1963\n\nThe front of the box containing the reel-to-reel tape says \"Tape 1 - Carson\" and \"Tape 2 - Kennedy\", although both sides are Carson McCullers dictating letters. The label on the reel itself says \"Carson\" and is dated December 1963, which is probably the date of Sullivan's copying of the tape.\n\nCarson McCullers dictating a letter to Elizabeth Schwartz [Carson's German translator who lived in Switzerland]. This is only a few seconds long when the recording stops. After a pause there is a dictated letter to Mary Mercer saying that she (Carson) is practicing the use of the Dictaphone machine that Mercer had given to her. She says that she had just dictated a letter to Elizabeth Schwartz, who had given Carson \"that lovely photograph of Annemarie\" (Annemarie Schwarzenbach (1908-1942), Swiss photographer, writer and poet, and friend of Carson). She also mentions that \"Robbie\" [Robert Lantz, Carson McCullers' literary agent], had told Carson that the German edition had sold out and they were preparing another one.\n\nReel-to-Reel Tape 1 - Side B - Carson McCullers dictating letters -- 8 minutes, 39 seconds\n\nSullivan's Label - 25-69, Pope John, 70-79 [Bylon?], 80-182 Kennedy Funeral, 183-OswaldTape 2 -- Kennedy\n\nCarson McCullers dictating a letter to Marielle [Bancou] (artist and friend of McCullers] (1921-2015) for about 1 minute and 10 seconds, during which Carson tells Marielle that Mary [Mercer] had given her a Dictaphone, then corrects herself to \"a talking machine\" for Christmas. \"Ernest, a precious boy who lives upstairs, is helping me to run it. \" Then there is a 1 minute 10 second gap before Ernest, presumably, says \"the machine will now record\" and asks Carson if she would like to recite a poem. She recites two, one with the phrases \"Nothing resembles nothing, yet nothing is not blank. It is configured hell\" and \"Of ticking clocks on winter afternoons.\" Then another minute of silence.\n\nAt about 4 minutes in, Carson resumes dictating the letter to Marielle. She tells again about receiving the tape recorder from Mary Mercer and says she hopes it will help her with her writing and to not be self-conscious and able to record her works. She goes on to ask Marielle to help arrange an exchange of Mary's house in Nyack for a house in Paris for a summer or six months. \"You're wonderful at doing things like that, darling. When are you coming back here darling? I just miss you so much when you're away. Ida [Reeder] sends you her love and to Pascal [Marielle's son] and, of course, so do I.\" \"Your little snow white.\" Then there is an aside to someone to whom Carson says, \"She used to call me 'My little snow white' .\"\n\n[Processor's note -- The following 8 cassette tapes contain correspondence between Carson McCullers and Reeves McCullers.

Newton Arvin discussing Carson's recent illness, new home for her mother and new house in Nyack. Asked about her work, Reeves, his trouble sleeping, his friend Howard Dowdy, hopes to move in a month to more permanent quarters. Three hand-written letters from Newton.\n\nOctober 4, 1953. Newton Arvin saying it was good to hear from Carson after so many years of silence, hopes to see her, his distress at hearing what anguish she had suffered in the last years.\n\nOctober 20, 1953. Newton Arvin saying he was deeply touched by her letter and the memories of Yaddo, his illnesses and hospitalizations.\n\nAugust 10, 1954. Newton Arvin saying he was distressed to hear of her recent illness and wishes to hear more about her. Thinks of her often.\n\nOctober 28, 1960. Next is a typed letter from Michelle Cantarella enclosing a clipping about Newton Arvin and his retirement due to his mental health and \"more trouble with the state police\". The clipping details the reasons for his retirement, including his arrest for \"possession of obscene pictures.\"\n\nSullivan next reads material having to do with the filming of Reflections in a Golden Eye:\n\nAugust 11, 1965. Richard Burton hoping she will get well soon.\n\nUndated. Marlon Brando saying that John [Huston] often speaks of you and your \"desire to get out of that damn bed and get to Ireland.\" He tells her that she makes John do his best. Brando comments that it has been a long time since they met at her apartment.\n\nSullivan then describes empty envelopes with John Houston's name embossed on them, used to record telephone numbers. Sullivan also reads a letter from Huston telling Carson that all arrangements for her upcoming trip to visit him at his home in Ireland will be made, and giving her details of her flight on Aer Lingus. There are also prescriptions written by Dr. Dyer, articles about fox hunting, the article from the Irish Times of April 10, 1967 which was the result of a lengthy interview with McCullers while at the Irish home of John Huston, a large map of Europe, a mention of additional letters which Sullivan does not read\n\nMay 30, 1967. Gladys Hill in a partial letter conveying well-wishes from people who had met McCullers during her visit to Ireland, as well as describing Huston's trip to Rome and seeing some scenes from Reflections in a Golden Eye. [Processor's note - The recording ends in mid-sentence but is completed on Tape 11, Side B.\n\nTape 11 - Side B - Ireland Letters -- 11 minutes and 36 seconds\n\nSullivan's Label: 11b Side 2 - II 2 Ireland Letters\n\nMay 30, 1967 Sullivan reads the letter in full that she started at the end of the preceding tape from Gladys Hill about the trip to Rome, and return to Ireland. It was very detailed about what they ate, how they slept, what they did, and details about both Reflections and Huston's next movie. Enclosed a letter from Dr. Dyer. Looking forward to visiting McCullers in October. \"Loves, hugs and kisses\".\n\nJuly 10, 1967 from Gladys Hill, describing a rainy day in Galway, Ireland and the filming of Huston's next [unnamed] movie. Also wrote of Huston's family. Huston will be in New York by October 18 for the premier of Reflections.\n\nAugust 15, 1967 from Gladys Hill about a telephone call from Carson, and telling her of their day of filming and eating and scouting locations for the film. She also describes an Irish Christmas and Boxing Day. \"End of the Irish Material\", says Sullivan.\n\nCassette Tape 12 -- Letters -- John L. and Simone Brown to Carson McCullers and Letters About the Death of Reeves McCullers\n\nTape 12 -- Side A -- Letters to Carson McCullers from John L Brown and and Simone -- 28 minutes and 27 seconds\n\nSullivan's Label: 12a - Side 1 - Letters to Carson - Letters John and Simone Brown\n\n[John Lackey Brown (1914-2003) and his wife Simone were friends of both Carson and Reeves McCullers. John had a long career with the Department of State. His papers are at the archives of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.]\n\nAll the letters on this tape are from John and/or Simone and are addressed to Carson and/or Reeves, unless otherwise noted. The effects of the McCarthy-inspired purge of the Department of State caused by the activities of Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee touch the Browns in 1953 and are frequently referred to, as well as Carson's departure from France and separation from Reeves, and his deterioration over the course of 1953 culminating in his death on November 19 of that year. Sullivan reads, \"This is a series of letters having to do with the death of Reeves, but I'm going to read some happier letters first from John and Simone Brown. He was with the Foreign Service of the United States of American in France.\"\n\nAugust 10th, 1950 from the Browns to Carson and Reeves. John described his family's August vacation situation, with Simone and the children in the mountains above a river and him on Mount Parness. He enclosed a \"rather idiotic\" review of The Member of the Wedding and tells them that Carl Brooks is very interested in bringing out her short stories, and remains hopeful about her new novel \"in utero\", saying \"all seems sweetness and light on the HM [Houghton Mifflin] front\". He is looking forward to the month of September in the Dordogne region of France where he hopes to finish a study of local domed churches and the Byzantine influence in France. He also hopes to reread some favorite books and study Dante and not look at a newspaper for the entire time. He asks Carson for a copy of her poems.\n\nDecember 31, 1950 (postcard) wishing Reeves and Carson a happy new year for 1951\n\nGood Friday evening, 1951 saying that although they had not had much time together, the McCullers had seemed much more like family that their \"real\" families, and they looked forward to seeing more of them in the future. He describes an idyllic day in the French countryside, gathering eggs from their hens and ducks for breakfast, walking in the fields full of daffodils, visiting a nearby chateau and a 9th century church in the village, remarking on the contrast to the turmoil going on in Paris, just 15 miles away with the on-going strikes of railway workers, bus drivers, subway workers and even of the undertakers. He describes a recent tour he had made through eastern France and Belgium lecturing on recent American novelists (much of it focused on her works). He says that they hope to be in the U.S. in September on home leave and that he longs to smell the air of Times Square and ride on a Fifth Avenue bus. He closes saying that he hopes the moon is shining as brightly in Nyack as it is where they are.\n\nDecember 31, 1951 poem dedicated to Carson, \"Remembering the Nyack Symposium\"\n\nFebruary 19, 1953 note on U.S. Information Service stationary enclosing a magazine article\n\nletter dated \"Sunday\" from Simone on stationary from Houghton Mifflin's Paris offices. Simone says she hopes Carson won't mind the stationary, but it was among her father's things. She says that they have received Rita's letter and are happy to hear that Carson is recovering and that what she needs is a long rest. She has asked Madame Joffre to pack and send Carson's books to Nyack, but that there may be a delay due to lack of money. She also mentions Carson's trunks which Madame Joffre and M. Levy [the McCullers' housekeeper and man-servant at their French home] have delivered to the Browns with instructions to forward to Nyack as well. Simone is concerned about some of the things to be shipped, such as silverware, porcelain and her clothing. There may be a heavy duty to get the silver through customs. She is also concerned that the porcelain is not packed well enough for shipment. They have, of course, not opened the trunks but want to know that it is well packed before they ship it. The clothes also will require a detailed listing to indicate that it belongs to Carson and thus will not subject to duties. The boys are well. \"Today is John Brown Jr.'s 5th birthday, Papa is still working on his book, the dogs are being sweet\"\n\nOctober 11, 1953 acknowledging her letter of the 5th. He will go to the embassy and make a sworn statement that he had seen the silver \"on the sideboard and the flat silver in use in your home in Nyack. Reeves is coming on Wednesday to make a list of everything in your trunk and then will go to American Express to carry out the necessary formalities for shipping. There is a strong possibility that we may be returning to the United States within a couple of months and we may be able to bring these things with us. If we do, is there a possibility of renting the top floor of your house in Nyack until we know what we will do? With all the changes in the government nobody here really knows what is going to happen.\"\n\nOctober 13, 1953 letter from Simone saying that Reeves had come down on Wednesday to take care of shipping the trunk. He felt that Carson especially wanted the polychrome angel and he took it to the post office and sent it to Carson via airmail. The rest of the contents of the trunk will be shipped by American Express\n\nOctober 27, 1943 [sic, but from the content it is clearly from 1953] saying that they hope that Carson is feeling better and that the wooden angle has arrived safely. Reeves was there for several days and they have shipped a trunk with Carson's silver and her clothes. John is waiting for a phone call from Reeves about the other items. John also tells Carson that he has heard from Madame Joffre that M. Levy is recovering slowly from his car accident and has bouts of amnesia. Also they are annoyed because they have not been paid in 4 months and they are running short of money. Reeves is drinking heavily these days and that is another cause for concern.\n\nNovember 10, 1953 from John saying \"Reeves has not done anything that he promised to do, consequently Simone is coming to Paris today to go make the arrangements herself. They will be shipped by rail to Le Havre thence to New York. . . The injustice, the intrigue, the dirty political deals have saddened me beyond saying. I don't know yet where we will go . . . we'll come out of this but it will leave scars and I don't know if I'll ever regain a belief in human beings and a sense of joy in the world\n\nNovember 14, 1953 saying, \"Carson, darling, your letter was an oasis in the desert we are now crossing\". . . \"We have not seen Reeves for some time\". . .his \"telephone has been taken out for the obvious reason and that makes it all the more difficult to keep in touch. Simone is doing everything for the shipment of the trunks. The movers are coming on Tuesday to take them to the American Express in Paris.\" Their plans are to stay until the first of the year, while his book is launched, but \"the bureaucratic atmosphere we are living in stifles joy. It is an atmosphere of pussyfooting, of dread, of denunciation of the most despicable pettiness. It is a mixture of Kafka and Ubu-Roi . . . If you or Rita know of any openings in publishing, do let me know\"\n\nletter dated \"Monday evening\" from the early 1960s from John Brown addressed to\" dearest Carson\" thanking her for a weekend at Nyack and describing how Alex drove him into town. He went in to Mademoiselle and paid a ceremonial visit to Cyrilly [Abels]. Rita escorted him into the Presence. As a matter of fact Cyrilly was nice and interested. He was off to Washington but would return on Saturday and then \"we will all descend on you like a hoard of Visigoths and Ostrogoths\", he also adds love to Marielle and Mary \"I liked them both so much\" and \"I'll find out about the Russian business in Washington\".\n\nTape 12 - Side B - Letters to Carson McCullers about Reeves' Death -- 30 minutes and 24 seconds\n\nSullivan's Label: 12b Letters to Carson - Reeves's death letters\n\nMargaret Sullivan reading the letters connected with Reeves death.\n\n\"Saturday\" [probably November 21, 1953, just after Reeve's suicide on Thursday] letter from Bob [probably Bob Meyers] saying \"Up until now Mr. Porter hasn't had anything more to say about the release of Reeves from the official medical officers. As we have explained, inasmuch as he was discovered in the hotel some hours later, there is always the question of determining the exact cause of death. We can do nothing about finalizing the services until then. Janet [Flanner] and John [Brown] both to be here all this week. They say they can be ready at a moment's notice. We shall probably have to hold the services in the morning because of cremation needs. I shall cable the exact time. Monique and Richard Richt [?] have phoned and will be here. About Bachivillers, they too will know. Shall I call Sarah Morris [?]. All of us here feel badly about the whole thing, in spite of the troubles Reeves gave us the whole year. Don't forget, they were real problem to him, too. He was mentally sick and we must all look at it from that angle. I shall write in more detail about the service. Incidentally I can't find a reference to a Bach double concerto other than the one in D for two violins. Is that it?\n\nSaturday, December 5, 1953 from Janet Flanner, describing the funeral service for Reeves in the American church, with John L. Brown reading the 23rd Psalm. She described the flowers, mentioned the preacher's biblical passages, named those who attended, including Truman [Capote?], and the interment ceremony in the American Legion cemetery in Neuilly. She also mentioned that the McCullers' housekeeper was there, and will call her in a day or two about the dogs. Flanner said that Reeves had been a brave soldier and this was the end of his war, adding that perhaps the war had played its part and destroyed his resistance to ordinary life. \"There were surely none of us who did not weep for him. . . we all felt forgiveness and pity and fondness and human love. . .I can't write more. His disappearance and absence from your scene must give you the liberty for work, which is your inheritance from him now\"\n\nNovember 23, 1953 from Simone Brown sending their condolences and telling McCullers of the progress of shipping her 4 trunks and getting the export licenses, damage insurance, etc. relating to them.
