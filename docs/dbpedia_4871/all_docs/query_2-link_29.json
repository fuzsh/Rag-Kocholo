        "text": "Patrick Joseph Sullivan was the only child born to Joseph and Esther (Stuedemann) Sullivan on April 21, 1941 in Minneapolis. Pat passed away on June 26, 2020 at age of 79 at Abbott Hospital in his old neighborhood. Pat enjoyed life of many adventures.\n\nPat was a unique person that God created, full of goofy jokes and pranks.\n\nPat grew up poor in Minneapolis. Pat met his wife Sandra (Videen) at South High where they graduated in 1959. Pat then played football at Augsburg College.\n\nPat and Sandy were married in 1962. Pat embarked on a career in retail sales, jobs took the family from Chicago to Montana and every state in between. In 1981, Pat realized his dream of becoming a business owner by purchasing Sandra’s ladies clothing store in Whitefish, MT. Pat became a serial entrepreneur starting several businesses. Pat and Sandy moved to Alexandria in 2002 to be near family.\n\nPat enjoyed spending time with family and eating out. He especially enjoyed attending his grandchildren’s sporting events. Most importantly, Pat and his family grew in their faith.\n\nPat was preceded in death by his parents and wife, Sandy (2010). He is survived by: daughter KrisAnn (Brian) Carlsen of Alexandria and son Rick (Judi) Sullivan of Boise, ID; grandchildren Eric Carlsen, Anna (Mike) McLouth, Emily Sullivan, Karina (fiance Josh Saucy) Carlsen, Natalie Sullivan, Matthew Carlsen, and Helen Sullivan; brothers-in-law David (Barb) Videen, Lee (Cheryl) Videen and Steve (Elizabeth) Videen and nieces and nephews. The family would like to give a special thanks to Pat’s friend of the last few years, Yvonne Solvie of Alexandria for her compassion and love.\n\nA graveside celebration of life for both Pat and Sandy will be held at Glen Haven Memorial Gardens in Crystal, MN on July 9, 2020 at 10 am.
