        "text": "Patrick Gillis, 56, of Lowell, a beacon of strength, kindness and unwavering optimism, passed away Thursday March 7th at his home. He was Born in Cambridge the son of the late Joseph S. and Mary (Donahue) Gillis. Patrick was educated in the Burlington school system and graduated from Burlington High School with the class of 1985, after graduation he enlisted in the Navy.\n\nA passionate sports enthusiast, Patrick’s spirit soared with every game played by his beloved Boston Bruins, New England Patriots and Boston Red Sox. His dedication to his teams was matched only by his resilience in facing life’s challenges head-on. Patrick was a pillar of strength, embodying courage and determination in the face of adversity.\n\nYet, amidst life’s trials, Patrick’s greatest joy was found in the company of his family, especially his cherished nieces and nephews. His heart swelled with pride and love as he watched them grow, and his infectious laughter filled every room when they were near.\n\nPatrick’s boundless generosity knew no bounds. He was the first to extend a helping hand, whether it was volunteering to assist with a move or offering the shirt off his back, even if it meant going without himself. His selflessness and compassion touched the lives of all who crossed his path, leaving an indelible mark of goodness.\n\nHe is survived by his adoring siblings, Jane Dunbar and her husband Lawrence of Townsend, MA, Mary Ann Corbett and her husband John of Burlington, Eileen Cudmore and her husband Paul of Woburn and Joseph Gillis and his wife Sally of Tewksbury, as well as many loving nieces and nephews.\n\nRelatives and friends are respectfully invited to attend his visiting hours from 11:00am to 12:30pm on Tuesday, March 26, 2024 at the Edward V. Sullivan Funeral Home, 43 Winn St. Burlington. His graveside service will follow at 1pm Chestnut Hill Cemetery in Burlington.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in his memory may be made to the Eliot Church, 273 Summer St. Lowell Ma 01852 or at https://eliotlowell.org"
