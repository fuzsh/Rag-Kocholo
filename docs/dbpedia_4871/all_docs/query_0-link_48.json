        "text": "The funeral Mass of Paulist Fr. Jeremiah Sullivan was held Saturday, January 9 at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle in New York City.\n\nWith deep sadness, we announce that our brother, Paulist Fr. Jeremiah Dennis “Jerry” Sullivan, entered eternal life on Thursday night, December 31, 2020.\n\nFr. Jerry, 87, died at Parker Jewish Rehabilitation Center in Queens, NY. He had been in declining health in recent months. There is no indication his death was related to COVID-19.\n\nHe had been a part of our missionary society for 68 years. He had been a priest for 61 years.\n\nHe was born on January 23, 1933, in Woodside, NY, a son of Eugene Sullivan and Julia Shea Sullivan.\n\nHe entered our novitiate in 1952; made his first promise on September 8, 1953; made his final promise on September 8, 1956; and was ordained a deacon in 1958.\n\nHe was ordained a priest on May 1, 1959, by Cardinal Francis Spellman.\n\nFr. Jerry earned his undergraduate degree at St. Paul’s College, our seminary in Washington, D.C., which was then a degree-granting institution. He later earned a master’s degree from Iona College in pastoral counseling.\n\nAfter his ordination, Fr. Jerry served his pastoral year at the Paulist Center in Boston. He also was based there from 1965 to 1967 while he served on our mission band.\n\nFrom September, 1960, to 1962, he served as an assistant pastor at St. Vincent de Paul Church in Mobile, AL.\n\nHe also served two stints (1962 to 1965 and 1967 to 1970) as an associate pastor at Good Shepherd Church in Inwood in New York City.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1974, he served in the Newman Apostolate at the University of California at Santa Barbara (St. Mark’s University Parish).\n\nIn 1974, Fr. Jerry became pastor of the Newman Apostolate at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, CT, serving there through 1982.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1986, he was associate pastor of St. Cyril of Alexandria Church in Tucson, AZ.\n\nHe then moved to North Carolina, serving as pastor of St. Paul the Apostle Church in Greensboro from 1986 to 1991 and as a chaplain at St. Vincent de Paul Medical Center in Charlotte from 1991 to 1992.\n\nHe continued as a chaplain at Griffin Hospital in Derby, CT, from 1992 to 1994, and as a chaplain at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles from 1994 to 2011.\n\nIn 2011, he entered senior ministry at our Motherhouse in New York City, adjacent to Church of Saint Paul The Apostle, NYC. He lived there until 2018 when he entered nursing home care on Long Island.\n\nIn addition to his Paulist brothers, Fr. Jerry is survived by his niece, Mary Breen Corrigan; his nephew, John Sullivan; his nephews, Joseph, John, Patrick and Jeremiah Breen; and 16 great nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his brother, John, and his sister, Jean Breen.\n\nFr. Jerry’s wake and Funeral Mass will be held Saturday, January 9, at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle in New York City. The wake will begin at 10 a.m. with the Funeral Mass at 11 a.m. His burial will follow the Mass at St. Thomas the Apostle Cemetery in Oak Ridge, NJ.\n\nIf the case of a snowstorm in New York City and northern New Jersey on Saturday, the wake, Funeral Mass and burial may take place on Monday.\n\nOur prayer for our brother, Jerry:\n\nMay the angels lead you into paradise,\n\nmay the martyrs come to welcome you,\n\nand take you to the holy city,\n\nthe new and eternal Jerusalem.\n\nMore photos from Fr.
