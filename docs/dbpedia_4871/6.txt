Sullivan, Joseph J., Jr. of Hingham, died October 15, 2017.

Dear husband to Helen F. Sullivan of Hingham. Loving father to the late Patricia S. Porter and her husband David Porter of Duxbury, Joseph J. Sullivan III and his late wife Maureen of Weymouth, Carol A. Beale and her husband Jon of Hingham, Michael J. Sullivan and his wife Crystal of Hingham. Cherished brother to Mary Sullivan of Hingham and the late Catherine Howorth and Helen Holland. Beloved grandfather to Jonathan, Jared, Patrick, Ryan, Kelly, Ashley, Shauna, Brittany, Tara, Isabella, Sienna, Finley and Shea. Also survived by 12 great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews.

Joe was born in South Boston on January 7, 1930 to the late Joseph and Katherine (White) Sullivan. He was a 1947 graduate of Boston College High School (B.C. High), served his country in the United States Navy, and attended Northeastern University. He also served on the board of B.C. High.

After working in the food transportation and distribution industry, he started his own company, J.J. Sullivan and Sons. Joe was a man who encouraged those around him to be better, to work harder. He always remembered his friends, and never forgot where he was from.

Joe moved his family to Hingham in 1964 where he raised his four children. An avid sports fan, he coached his sons in baseball and was a man who all could count on. Countless people will miss “Joe,” “Big Joe,” “Pal, and “Grampy” as he was known to all of his grandchildren and their friends.

Relatives and friends are invited to attend the Funeral service Monday at 10:00 AM in Church of the Resurrection, Hingham. In lieu of flowers, please consider donations in memory of Joseph to Office for Institutional Advancement, BC High, 150 Morrissey Blvd., Boston, MA 02125.
