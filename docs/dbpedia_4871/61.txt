Patrick Joseph Sullivan was born in Southern California on November 12, 1947 to Joy and Ray Sullivan, dedicated fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was soon joined by three baby brothers, Mike, Dennis and Tim. Throughout the years various sports became the family's pastimes.

After high school, Pat joined the U.S. Marine Corps and was sent to Vietnam for a tour. Looking for a new kind of adventure after being discharged, Pat set out for Hawaii where he got into logging Koa wood and crafting it into beautiful furniture. He joined the canoe team in Hilo and his lifelong love of boats was born.

Once again, seeking something new and exciting, he headed off to Alaska where he became interested in commercial fishing and fishing boats. He ended up in Hoonah where he bought a troller named Helen T. One season he noticed Bonnie Westlund, a young woman who was trolling in a small sailboat and routinely unloading catches bigger than his. When they crossed paths on the dock he invited her over for 'a great cup of coffee.' The coffee was instant and so was their rapport.

A single father, Pat was proud to introduce Bonnie to his son young son, Kelsey. They were soon a fishing team and later a family. Pat and Kelsey joined Bonnie at her Wrangell Narrows homestead, making the cabin she'd built into their family home.

Pat will remembered for his kindness and his jovial laughter. Unafraid to be silly, he genuinely enjoyed making others happy. He was always noticing other's needs and wanted to help anyone he could.

Pat was medevaced to Anchorage after suffering a massive heart attack and died there on December 21, 2023 surrounded by his entire family. He is survived by his brothers, Mike, Tim, Dennis and their families; his life partner, Bonnie Westlund; his son, Kelsey; daughter-in-law, Lorraine; and a new grandson, Finley.
