Patrick Joseph Sullivan passed away unexpectedly on October 16th 2023. Born at Saint Elizabeth’s hospital in Manhattan, NY to Irish immigrant parents; Mary (née McCarthy) and James Sullivan.

He grew up in Washington Heights and The Bronx. He attended Cardinal Hayes High School before he was drafted and served in Vietnam from 1970-1972. When he returned he attended and graduated Manhattan College. He had a varied career that began in social work, led to teaching, and transitioned into business specializing in commodities.

He is predeceased by his father, James Sullivan; his mother, Mary Sullivan; and his brother, Jimmy Sullivan. He is survived by his wife and soulmate, Margaret (née Cronin) and loving daughter, Katrina; his beloved sisters: Peggy Oates, Kay Burke, MaryAnn Hudson, and Nora Marie Sullivan; and many adoring nieces, grand nieces, nephews and grandnephews who all have happy memories of their uncle/grand uncle.

Patrick proudly loved his Irish roots in Co. Cork and Co. Tipperary and took many trips to visit the auld sod. He cherished all of his cousins in Eire and always had a great time visiting there. He had a keen interest in Irish history and culture and could reference just about anything Celtic. He was a larger than life personality with a gift for storytelling sometimes veering into the territory of tall tales. An Irish gift of the gab that could spin a yarn out of anything. He was a loyal friend with a joyous streak who could see the humor in any situation. He was a devout traditional Catholic with a strong belief in his faith. He said the rosary every night praying for all his family and friends. He was a valued member of the Regina Coeli council of the Knights of Columbus, having served for several years as the Deputy Grand Knight. He was a staunch supporter of the right to life movement. He served as President of the Board at 6200 Riverdale ave Co-op.
