        "text": "Oracle will issue 41 security patches next Tuesday addressing vulnerabilities across “hundreds” of its products, the company said in a pre-release announcement.\n\nMore than 15 of those patches address flaws that were described by the company as being remotely executable without the need for authentication — a class of vulnerability to which Oracle usually assigns its highest severity rating. Of these, nine are slated for Oracle Secure Backup, two for its Application Server product and five for its BEA Product Suite.\n\n[ Learn how to secure your systems with Roger Grimes’ Security Adviser blog and newsletter, both from InfoWorld. ]\n\nThe company’s Critical Patch Update next week will also include fixes for 10 vulnerabilities in its database products. None of these exploits, however, can be taken advantage of remotely without the attacker having access to a username and password first, the company said.\n\nAmong the affected products that were listed by Oracle in its pre-announcement were multiple versions of its database going back to Oracle database 9i, its E-business suite products and several versions of Oracle’s WebLogic Server and Portal products.\n\nThe number of patches being released by Oracle in this round is about the same as the last quarter, when the company issued 36 security fixes.\n\nBy Oracle’s standards those number are relatively small. There have been occasions when the company has issued considerably more patches in its quarterly updates. Its January 2006 update had 82 patches, while the same year’s October update had 101.\n\nAs with every release, Oracle is imploring administrators to install the patches as soon as possible. But if history is any indication, a large number of the database patches, at least, are unlikely to be installed in a hurry.\n\nA study of 305 database administrators released in January 2008 by security vendor Sentrigo Inc. found that two-thirds of those surveyed did not install Oracle’s security patches at all no matter how critical the vulnerabilities were."
