        "text": "MidnightDBA feels pretty! Oh so pretty!\n\nPost author By Jen McCown\n\nCategories In Uncategorized\n\nSo you may have noticed that MidnightDBA looks a bit different. Quite a bit prettier, and a little big uglier. This week we pushed our upgrade…tah-dah!! The site is still a little rough, and we'll be putting in big work this weekend. BUT, the new site features some pretty exciting stuff:\n\nFor us, a much easier video deployment process. It has a (drumroll-please)…..SQL back end!\n\nFor you, the ability to move columns around, and sort the lists of videos by any column. So if you want to see the longest videos in, say, the Dev section, just click on the \"Length\" heading! Sweeeet….\n\nVideo preview images (thumbnails). This is especially amusing on the DBAs@Midnight page\n\nAnd we have a full list of other improvements we want to make. First things first though, gotta work out the formatting and other bugs.\n\nAnd I have a couple of new articles on SQL Server Pedia: First, a thorough introduction to Joins: \"In a SELECT statement we know that the first (select) phrase tells us what columns we’ll be receiving, FROM tells us what table they live in, WHERE limits the set of rows we get back, and so on. So what about JOINs? It turns out, JOINs are all about the math, baby. Stay with me here, this won’t hurt.\"\n\nAnd now, a little TSQL script I like to call Compare Column Definitions Between Two Tables: \"This week I went looking around for a quick bit of code to compare two similar tables – I had to find the mismatched datatypes and NULL settings – and I didn't find anything I liked. So I wrote this!\"\n\nHappy days, all!\n\n-Jen McCown, http://www.MidnightDBA.com\n\nFree Stuff Friday!\n\nPost author By Jen McCown\n\nCategories In Uncategorized\n\nFree is greatness. Please to enjoy:\n\nNorth Texas User Group Next Week!\n\nNorth Texans (and anyone in earshot): Free training, networking, and SQL community ties at the North Texas SQL Server User Group. Next meeting is in a week, Thursday 9/17. Topic this month is \"Bad SQL – Why Does This \"Perfectly Good\" T-SQL Run So Slow?\"\n\nOops…\n\nOk, sorry folks…it looks like this wasn't a legit free offering. So sorry all, and especially to the authors of said book. That's what I get for being naiive….\n\nMore Free Goodness!\n\nFree & awesome IT training: http://www.midnightdba.com/, of course.\n\nFree OReily Webcasts.\n\nFree code at the SQLServerPedia Code Library, soon to feature yours truly.\n\nMore free SQL code (and more) at CodeProject.\n\nFree help on SQL, Windows, and everything under the sun at Microsoft Technet.\n\n-Jen McCown, http://www.MidnightDBA.com"
