        "text": "Compliance and security are in the spotlight this week with McAfee buying database security vendor Sentrigo and news that healthcare compliance budgets are growing. There is also a new beta program to test compliance products for Microsoft’s Lync, while new research shows the global security budget rising to almost US$28 billion.\n\nMcAfee Buys Sentrigo\n\nThe Intel-McAfee deal is closed and it’s back to business as usual -- certainly as far as McAfee (news, site) is concerned, with the announcement this week that it intends to buy database security vendor Sentrigo, with which McAfee has had an OEM partnership since last October.\n\nAs a result, McAfee has been selling Sentrigo’s database monitoring software, along with its other security and auditing and vulnerability applications, since then.\n\nNeedless to say, with security one of the principal considerations for companies thinking of a move to the cloud, the business potential for the deal is huge.\n\nNeither company has offered details about a timeframe or price, but with it McAfee says that it will be looking to sell a database security platform as well as integrating other Sentrigo products across McAfee products.\n\nAs part of McAfee, Sentrigo will be in a position to deliver these best-of-breed solutions to address a much broader range of customer's database security and compliance challenges,\" Nathan Shuchami, CEO of Sentrigo, said in a statement.\n\nIt also joins other database giants such as Oracle (news, site), which bought Secerno, a database security provider, last year, and IBM (news, site), which bought Guardium for US$ 225 million. More on this as it happens.\n\nBeta Program for Lync Compliance\n\nInstant Technologies has launched a beta program for its Instant Archive Viewer application. Companies that are interested in participating still have a chance to sign up.\n\nInstant Archive Viewer helps organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements and enforce internal IM usage policies for products such as IBM Lotus Sametime and Microsoft Office Communications Server, as well as Office Communications Server R2.\n\nInstant Archive Viewer also provides support for Microsoft Lync 2010 and Lync 2010 content types, a new charting and reporting system for Lync10 and a streamlined installation process.\n\nWe are seeing broad adoption of Lync 2010 in our customer base and support for Lync is a high priority . . .Instant Archive Viewer Version 4 will support Lync 2010 and provide a simplified installation process, a rich search and discovery framework, as well as a robust charting and reporting module,\" says Peyton McManus, President of Instant Technologies.\n\nCompanies wishing to participate in the program may submit a nomination via the Instant Technologies web site.\n\nHealthcare Compliance Budgets to Grow\n\nHealthcare and compliance are in the news again this week with new research from SaaS GRC vendor Compliance 360 (news, site), which shows that compliance budgets are set to increase over the course of this year.\n\nLearning Opportunities\n\nWhile it is late in the year to be making budget predictions given that many companies will have already mapped out their spending priorities by now, the 2011 Medical Claims Audits Benchmark Study makes interesting reading.\n\nAmong the healthcare compliance professionals who participated in the study, 40% said that their compliance program budgets are increasing in 2011, indicating that many are expecting increased regulatory oversight and medical claims audit activities this year.\n\nLast year, healthcare providers continued preparing for CMS’ Medicare Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) program, which included aggressive timeframes and a complex appeals process. Three findings in the study stand out:\n\nCompliance spending is on the way up with an increase of 29% in the number of companies considering spending\n\nCompanies and users are considerably more confident then were before about using the software in the event of medical claims audits\n\n50% of respondents said the greatest challenge to managing medical claims audits is holding everyone accountable for their part of the process.\n\nAnd many of them are looking to software for the solutions. Probably explains the huge interest in medical GRC software we have already noted in previous months. Interested in more?

Interested in this?\n\nSecurity Software Market to hit US$ 27.8 Billion\n\nA new report from Infini Ressearch has analysts forecasting that the Global Security Software Market will reach $27.8 billion in 2014. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is increasing frequency and complexity of threats.\n\nThe Security Software market has also been witnessing increasing adoption of deep packet scanning. However, growing piracy and rising adoption of pirated content among individual users could be a challenge to the growth of this market.\n\nIt is estimated that around 70% of all attacks on web security are aimed toward the application layer. With rising application layer attacks, there is an increasing need to secure the web-applications using web-application vulnerability management solutions, the research says."
