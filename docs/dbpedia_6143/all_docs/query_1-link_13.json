The first of these is the indisputable rise of cyber crime, malware attack, information theft and hacking which has accompanied the expansion of the internet. Threat of attack via cyberspace has in recent years become a real concern not only of public organisations guarding state secrets, but also of commercial entities seeking to remain profitable.\n\nWhether the threat is from loss of valuable data, disruption to financial services, release of intellectual property, the shutting down of critical national infrastructure or simply the reputational damage of being known to have been compromised, the possibility of cyber attack represents both a danger to national security and a potential source of major losses.\n\nThe stakes are high; visiongain has assessed the cyber security market will reach $68.34bn in 2013.
