fully of the present invention to provide.Yet clearly, the present invention does not have these details can implement yet.In other cases, for fear of the present invention being caused unnecessary bluring, known construction and device illustrates with block diagram.\n\nGeneral general introduction\n\nAccording to the embodiment that describes herein, for the comings and goings or the incident of the integrality, authenticity or the accuracy that detect the infringement data, but the data of monitor database system management and storage.Embodiments of the invention can be realized on the device of data base management system (DBMS) (by this assembly monitor) peripheral operation.\n\nIn one embodiment, providing a kind of is using one group of processor being made up of one or more processors to keep the method for monitor database in the environment of database.Use can be carried out this method basically by the processing resource of one group of processor outside that one or more processors are formed.Data element comprises the data of the content in the database that saves as Database Systems, reads from the position that keeps or carry out the processor outside of database.One group analysis operates on the part of database and carries out, and satisfies one or more data elements that are considered to the standard of potential abnormal data with identification.But signaling or send notice when recognizing potential unusual data.\n\nAccording to another embodiment, the method that is used for the monitor database system comprises one group of data element of the content of discerning the database that saves as Database Systems.A series of routine analyzers are carried out on this group data element, in the identification database to be potential unusual data.Trigger notice when detecting potential unusual data.\n\nIn another embodiment, the method that is used for the monitor database system is included in the fixed time and saves as one group of data element of the content in the database of Database Systems at interval with the identification of one or more examples place.This method comprises that also identification is used at the appointed time how revising the trend data that this organizes data element on the interval.Based on this trend data, carry out one or more analysis operations, with potential unusual data in the identification database.\n\nUse the foregoing description, can handle various types of data of Database Systems, to be identified as potential unusual or suspicious data.In one embodiment, read and handle metadata, to detect the potential suspicious variation of database schema about database schema.For example, the variation of database schema can be represented the existence of Malware.But scope of examination data are with the express possibility database schema of incident (some of them are described in next section) of any number of damaging database of detection.Further, embodiment described herein can monitor the data that limit user's privilege on the network.The variation of database privilege can be inspected and possibly reported as suspicious, to guarantee, for instance, is not to use privilege to carry out lawbreaking activities inadequately.\n\nOwing to can detect anomalous content data or metadata, so embodiments of the invention can detect bad data and when supply with from other system in other incident, when software robot search (spidering) destruction appears in the distributed data base, write the existence of the inconsistent data of database by the different application module, unexpected or the deliberately deletion or the operation of data, the use of breach of security policy, duplicity database transaction and input, and management or misoperation.And embodiments of the invention can detect to be usurped or privilege that duplicity ground obtains or by the data of \" invasion \".Equally, in the time in fact should not giving the right in user accesses data storehouse, privilege can be had a mind to or by mistake be changed, thereby authorized user can accessing database.\n\nIn addition, the foregoing description can be carried out such function, and does not need any a large amount of resource of database.For example, embodiment provided herein can carry out the function of monitor database, and does not need to handle the resource that is used to keep database.Keeping the wide area information server server needn't dispose and make the foregoing description operable \" agency \".In fact, for example embodiment such as the foregoing description makes database monitored in this uses, simultaneously to the minimum that influences of the performance characteristic of the system that keeps database.\n\nTerm\n\nAs used herein, term \" content \" or \" content-data \" are meant that being arranged in database does not still form the structure of database or the partial data of pattern (schema, outline).In addition, content-data does not comprise metadata.\n\n\" database \" comprises any data structure that is used for the mode storage data of tabular form or row.Generally speaking, database structurally is stepless, but can be used for storing ranked data.\n\n\" privilege \" is meant set or the operation that allows the network user to carry out.Alternatively, also can be referred to as to authorize, or one group of mandate.\n\nTerm \" data element \" is meant any data that are stored in the database.For example, \" data element \" can comprise object or be included in the interior value of object.\n\nSystem description\n\nFig. 1 shows the system that is used for monitor database according to one embodiment of the invention.In order to describe purpose, Fig. 1 is illustrated in the embodiment in the network range with a lot of traditional characteristics.\n\nAccording to an embodiment shown in Figure 1, (data analysissystem DAS) 110 is arranged on the Local Area Network 104 data analysis system.LAN 104 links to each other with internet 108.Fire wall 124 is configured to protect LAN 104 not to be subjected to the influence of the input communication that sends by internet 108.Router one 22 is used to guide the flow that comes from LAN 104, or the designated assembly that is used for LAN 104.\n\nDatabase server 130 remains on the LAN 104.Database server 130 can be assumed to the significant data that keeps on the database 132.This significant data can comprise, for example, and record of the audit, archives and customer account information.Database 132 is organized data with correlation form, for example organizes data with list data structure.Database 132 can be the ingredient of database server 130.The data of being kept by database server 130 comprise content-data, about the metadata of database schema with limit the privilege that the user watches the mandate of the data in the database.But these database server 130 managing control datas, metadata and privilege.Management station 144 is used for carrying out management function on LAN 104.Management function can comprise the safety of monitoring LAN104, comprises LAN user's activity.The various elements of LAN 104 and assembly can be by channel 106 interconnection.Interconnection element in the scope of perimeter firewall and parts are considered to the part of LAN 104.\n\nIn one embodiment, DAS 110 comprises business rules process 112, peek engine (fetching engine) 114 and policy engine 116.The peek engine 114 be configured to an appointed interval or when specified requirements (manual command) takes place from database server 130 reading of data.DAS 110 is to its data execution analysis operation or program of fetching from database server 130, to protect the overall integrity of the data of being kept by database server 130.In one embodiment, the specified portions of peek engine 114 scan databases 132 and the row or other parts of fetching the table of database server 130 management.By from database 132 reading of data, DAS 110 can be in database server 130 peripheral operations, thereby make the influence to database server reach minimum.\n\nIn one embodiment, DAS 110 carries out the series of analysis program on the date of giving for change by peek engine 114, with the identification abnormal data.One or more routine analyzers can require to use the keeper of business rule or database server 130 or the Else Rule and the condition of operator's appointment.Business rules process 112 can be provided for making that keeper or operator can enter the mechanism of business rule.This business rules process 112 also can be managed the execution of business rule.In case recognize abnormal data, then this DAS 110 available signals notice.For example, but DAS 110 send Emails 122 are given management station 144.Alternatively, this DAS 110 for example can send our page 124 or produce and can listen or visible alarm.\n\nPolicy engine 116 is configured to carry out a series of programs (being referred to as alternatively, \" policy \") in the various data of fetching from database server 130 by peek engine 114.In one embodiment, policy engine 116 is responsible for every row of the database 132 fetched by peek engine 114 or every section are carried out a series of programs with designated order.The more detailed description of the various policies of carrying out for DAS 110 is provided in Fig. 4-6.The mode that in Fig. 3, provides these policies to carry out.\n\nTherefore, for instance, DAS 110 can work, and need not carry out the agency on database server 130.Therefore, DAS 110 only needs database server 130 is carried out \" read-only \" visit.According to an embodiment, DAS 110 does not produce significantly influence to the performance of database server 130.\n\nAs describe among Fig. 2-7 embodiment provided, DAS 110 can obtain the snapshot of data from database server 130.This DAS 110 can inspection and analysis of metadata, privilege data and content-data.Metadata comprises about the data of the structure of database 132 and about the data of the relation of particular data elements or structure or other elements/structures.Privilege provides the mandate to the different user on the network.Content-data is meant the data that stored by the data structure that forms database 132.\n\nIn other purposes of DAS 110 on LAN 104, when DAS influences the data that kept by database server 130 unfriendly if can detecting incident.For example, DAS 110 can detect from the undelegated visit of the unknown subscriber by internet access LAN 104 and/or the data manipulation that is kept by database server.DAS 110 can determine also when the user of LAN 104 deliberately or unintentionally damages the data that stored by database server 130.When the Malware by LAN 104 influences the data that kept by database server 130, can detect this Malware.To incident influence database server 130 and can be by other example of the incident of DAS110 detection be described.\n\nFig. 2 illustrates the method that is used for the monitor database system according to one embodiment of present invention.For example the method for method of Miao Shuing etc. can be carried out on system shown in Figure 1.For example, the method for for example describing among Fig. 2 can be carried out on DAS 110.In the method for describing Fig. 2, provide any reference, so that the assembly or the context (context) that are fit to that is used to carry out embodiments of the invention to be shown to the element of Fig. 1.\n\nReferring to Fig. 2, be provided for reading the step 210 of one group of data from database server.These data are read into external device (ED) or position.This external device (ED) can comprise the individual components corresponding to DAS 110 for instance.This read operation can automatically perform, and for example regularly carries out.For example, an executable generic operation comprises the SELECT statement of writing with Structured Query Language (SQL) (SQL).The specified portions of this SELECT statement scan database 132.Each read operation can provide \" snapshot \" of the data that kept by DAS 110.Each snapshot all is recorded, so that it can be used for comparing function afterwards.\n\nWherein the frequency of reading database or scheduling can change according to user's needs.For example, for some high-security applications, per a few minutes or several seconds just obtain the snapshot of database 132.But for other low-security applications, can be based on every day or obtain the snapshot of database 132 weekly.Alternatively, reading of database 132 can be event-driven.For example, reading of each database 132 can be manually started by the network manager.\n\nAccording to an embodiment, wherein each example of reading from database server 130 of data all can produce some of data of following type: (i) comprise the system directory about the metadata of the data structure kept by database server 130, one or more tables and the (iii) content-data of (ii) representing the network privileges of different user on the LAN 104.This system directory can comprise about relation, row or independent data element between the row of the metadata of all tables of database, database, the table.This content-data can be corresponding to the actual relationship data of the part of database 132.This content-data especially can have special-purpose, is used to detect the integrality of infringement database 132 and the various incidents that are difficult to detect of security.\n\nIn step 220, one or more analysis operations are carried out in these group data that read from database server 130.Analysis operation is database server 110 outside execution.For example, DAS 110 can read the data that kept by database server 130, and can execution analysis operate, and without any need for the resource from database server.The analysis operation of being carried out by DAS 110 depends on the data type of analyzing.With regard to complexity, content-data is the most difficult, thereby needs more complicated analysis operation.On the other hand, can be by from the data of nearest snapshot be appointed as between the data of another snapshot of reference source and directly contrast, and analyze executive system catalogue and authorization table.\n\nIn one embodiment, the analysis operation detection is unusual data.Abnormal data is to be appointed as to require the further data of inspection, is for example specified by the keeper.In one embodiment, analysis operation is actually a series of program, and wherein each program uses a kind of specific method to detect abnormal data.Operation or program can designated order be carried out in proper order, so that its result's maximization.More detailed description to analysis operation and their executive mode is provided below.\n\nIn step 230, if the Data Detection that reads from Database Systems to abnormal data, signaling then.According to an embodiment, this notice can be the mail of the network user (for example keeper etc.) to appointment or the form of the page.This notice can trigger the potential unusual data of user's hand inspection, determining in fact whether these data are incorrect, or otherwise represents infringement to the integrality of the data that kept by database server 130.\n\nFig. 3 illustrates wherein a series of procedure order and carries out to analyze the embodiment from the content-data of database.Can analyze this content-data, to detect the anomalous content data that the potential incident may represent to have damaged database takes place.For example, anomalous content data can be represented because content-data is undesired, so database is invaded.Further specify this example.Content-data can be corresponding to other user of a specific order amount to be reduced or remitted, and abnormal data can be corresponding to a people who is appointed as in this rank that receives the fund of Duoing than other people.The existence of this abnormal data can represent whether the keeper should investigate abnormal data is correct.If abnormal data is incorrect, then the keeper can investigate checking whether database is invaded, or whether the people who has the mandate of data input base carries out specific input improperly.\n\nUnder one situation of back, whether debugging that the keeper is adjustable mistake is to be not intended to and to be, or whether the people with access right deliberately imports abnormal data mala fide.For example, the keeper can find, the people who is appointed as the more funds of reception also be can accessing database the employee.In this case, the prompting keeper, the employee has embezzlement conduct or the tendency of the further action that damages data base integrity is arranged.\n\nAs indicated in the example that provides, the detection of anomalous content data can provide much about incident that influences data base integrity or even people's clue and information.In the described embodiment of for example Fig. 3, order execution analyzer on identical content data elements or content-data, unusual whether to have in definite this content-data.For example, program be defined as unusual data can be different with the data that another program limits.Like this, embodiment (for example Fig. 3 is described) provides when determining whether to have anomalous content data, and continuous program can be carried out on the part of the content-data of database.Clue or indication that variety of event that this exists the decision of anomalous content data to provide to have produced abnormal data or situation take place.In the description of Fig. 3,, the parts that are fit to of the step that is used to carry out the method for describing or function only are shown referring to the element of Fig. 1.\n\nIn step 310, content-data reads from database.For example, content-data may read from the database server 130 that keeps database 132.\n\nIn step 315, being identified for analysis to small part of the content-data of fetching from database 132.In one embodiment, stand a series of continuous routine analyzers by the every part that makes content-data and analyze this part.Can be one at a time or analyze the different piece of this content-data simultaneously.\n\nStep 320 provides first routine analyzer to carry out at the content-data that reads from database 132.This program self can comprise the sequence of operations of carrying out with the order of wanting.For example, this program can be corresponding to the unusual algorithm that is used for detecting content-data.\n\nIn step 330, determine whether first routine analyzer detects the abnormal data that is used for specific data content or one group of data element.This abnormal data can more may be incorrect data corresponding to abnormal content-data or than other data.In one embodiment, when unusual first routine analyzer defined one or more specified datas criterion.First routine analyzer can be checked the data that read from database 132, to determine whether to satisfy one or more criterions by this program appointment from the content-data that database reads.For example, each data element for example is stored in one or more values of the data object in the database, can be by analyzed by the algorithm of first routine analyzer definition.\n\nAs another example, this algorithm can be simultaneously compare data element and other data element that reads from database 132, to determine whether be abnormal when this data element and other data element compare.As another example, the algorithm of first program can compare independent data element and other data element that before reads from database.For example, when known this database is safe and during unimpaired, the one group of comparing data that reads from this database is used for one group of data of comparison in the time of can being provided at and carrying out first (and subsequently) routine analyzer.\n\nIf the analyzed data element of determining in the step 330 is unusual, then step 335 provides and has produced notice subsequent signal notice.In one embodiment, the individual of appointment or agency send the notice that has been found that anomalous content data.This notice can be the form of Email, the page or other form of sending out message, although but this notice may be simple as the flash of light of sounding alarm or lamp.In one embodiment, this notice is specified particular data value or the data element that triggers this notice.In another embodiment, the part of the content-data of being analyzed by continuous program in this notice identification notice.\n\nIf determining in the step 330 be, first routine analyzer does not detect abnormal data, and then step 340 determines whether another routine analyzer that can carry out exists on the identical content data.In one embodiment, a plurality of programs (each all uses distinct algorithm) can be carried out on identical content-data.If determining in the step 340 be, do not exist other routine analyzer to analyze the certain content data, then whether another part of the content-data that reads in step 345 identification step 310 keeps treating analyzed.If determining in the step 345 is to keep other content-data from step 315, another part of this content-data exists, and then repeats this method from step 315.\n\nExist if determining in the step 340 is used for another routine analyzer of the specific part of content-data, then this method repeats from step 330, and all programs in this a series of program all are to carry out in proper order from the content data elements that database 132 reads.If any one program is trigger notice all, then step 335 sends this notice.\n\nNeed analyzed extra content-data if exist, then be provided for using another program on this content-data, to carry out the step 350 of another analysis operation.Can carry out the order of a plurality of programs specifies at the specific program of this step execution.\n\nIf determining in the step 345 be, there is not other content-data from step 315, then this method finishes (till other data are read from database 132) in step 350.After the method for finishing the result who describes or give prominence to the various routine analyzers on this notice or the different piece in detail, can produce report at content-data.This detailed description, outstanding or result also can be filed.\n\nIn one embodiment, can be periodically or read content-data from database 132 according to a certain program.In case be read, then can carry out for example method of Fig. 3 description.Alternatively, can respond a certain unplanned incident content data.For example, but keeper or other network user's manual activation for example the method described of Fig. 3 to be performed.\n\nThough for example the embodiment that describes among Fig. 3 provides on one group of specific content-data order to carry out all routine analyzers, another embodiment provides simultaneously or at least each other at least some of execution analyzer on the spot.For example, this embodiment can provide not have and notes that when first routine analyzer starts or finish, and just can carry out second routine analyzer.\n\nFig. 4 illustrates according to one embodiment of the invention and is used for method with the content-data of empty database system.This content-data can be monitored, with the generation of a plurality of incidents of the content that detects the database may change monitoring improperly.Like this example of incident comprise assault, Malware appearance, change content-data have a mind to but the lawbreaking activities of authorizing or improper value is input to the data input of the chance in the database.\n\nIn the description of Fig. 4,, the step that is used to carry out the method for just describing or the suitable parts of function only are shown referring to the content of Fig. 1.For one group of content data elements, for example the method for describing among Fig. 4 is carried out a series of policies to determine whether that meaningful data are unusual.This policy is actually program, and each policy has all when the definition content-data is unusual parameter and condition.\n\nThe supposition of method that Fig. 4 provides has been read in DAS 110 from the content-data of database 132.For example, in the following description that provides, suppose that peek engine 114 has read in content input DAS 110, wherein the combination of policy engine 116 and business rules process will be pursued a policy determining whether that meaningful data should arouse attention, or trigger notice.\n\nIn one embodiment, step 420-460 carries out in proper order, thereby carries out when another step finishes a step.In another embodiment, step 420-460 carries out simultaneously.Further, these steps can be each other on the spot carrying out.In one embodiment, the specific timing that when is performed of each step can be specified by network manager or operator.\n\nStep 410 provides sets up the one or more parameter that is used for execution analyzer.Each program can require the comparative parameter of different groups.In one embodiment, at least some of comparative parameter are by network manager or operator's definition.To the desired comparative parameter of each policy be described in more detail referring to the detailed policy of following detailed description.\n\nThe policy that step 420-460 identification is carried out, wherein each policy is treated the analysis of the particular type carried out all the time on content-data.Each policy all can be carried out by policy engine 116.The instruction that specific procedure or be used for is carried out these programs can be stored in policy engine 116, or is stored in other places, and for example in the storehouse, wherein policy engine 116 can obtain these policies.\n\nIn step 420, carry out the policy that is used on content-data, carrying out average analysis of specifying.In one embodiment, by handling a column data that peek engine 114 reads to determine, for the data in the row, the mean value of (1) all values, the maximal value of (2) these values, the minimum value of (3) these values.Each data element in the row all compares with mean value, maximal value and minimum value then.These comparative parameters (identification in step 410) concrete data element of definition is different from mean value, minimum value and/or peaked possible range or zone.\n\nFor example, the value of comparative parameter definable data element can be from mean variation 20%, from minimum value or maximal value variation 5%.If exceed this zone, then data element is defined as unusual.As described in Figure 3, notice can be sent or send by signal.In one embodiment, if as the result of this step, concrete data element is thought unusual, then this concrete data element was not handled by other policy afterwards.\n\nIn step 430, carry out the policy that is used on content-data, carrying out the program of distributed analysis of specifying.This distributed program compares the value range of data element and one group of criterion of appointment.One group of criterion of this appointment can obtain in step 410.In one embodiment, if having data element to have to exceed the value range of designation criteria, then be labeled as those data elements unusual.Do not need those data elements are done further to analyze.And if detect potential unusual data element in this step, then the recipient of appointment can signal is sent or send to notice.\n\nFor an example is provided, the specific data of row can be listed the value that comprises company clerk's salary.Definable is specified Da Yu $100, and 000 salary value is as one group of unusual criterion.Then, each data element in the inspection row is with this concrete data element salary value of identification.If the salary value surpasses $100,000, then notify with signal and send or send.\n\nStep 440 provides the policy that is used for carrying out in the content date of fetching from database the program of data mining analysis of specifying of carrying out.This data mining analysis can flock together data element based on two or more variablees or parameter.For example, each data element can be corresponding to the object that is independent employee profiles (profile, configuration file).The variable of analyzable object comprises position and salary.For one group of given data element, can independent employee profiles merger be in the same place by position and salary.Then, if determine that an employee profiles is positioned at this bunch outside, then this employee profiles is identified as unusually.For example, can determine that an employee has the salary more much higher than other employees identical with its position.As another example, can determine that an employee has the position that other people do not have in the company.Each of these examples all can trigger specific employee profiles and be considered to unusual.Each that is used for the particular variables of this step and this bunch is worth the part that admissible deviation all is the comparative parameter that obtains in step 410.\n\nIn step 450, carry out to specify another policy of the classified program of content-data that to fetch from database.Then, in step 455, carry out the program that in step 420-440 one or more, describes in detail once more, except for revising this program according to the data element of specific category classification.When being specific classification execution in step 420-450, the standard that is used for defining no abnormal data can be these classifications and defines specially.These classifications can be by Network Management person/operator's definition.In step 410, can obtain to be used in the concrete criterion of classification in each program that execution describes in detail in step 420-440.\n\nStep 460 provides to carry out to specify uses business rule or other pre-defined rule to determine another policy of the program that content-data is whether unusual.Business rule comprises user-defined rule.For example, user-defined rule can be specific business environment and carries out, for example company's specific security policies.In one embodiment, these rules can be configured to the form of SQL formation.This rule can be by the Network Management person who has monitored database or operator's definition.The predefine rule is meant the big classification that can be included in the rule of carrying out the manufacturing industry definition rule on DAS existence before and the DAS 110 on the network.In one embodiment, \" best enforcement \" policy of predefine rule declaration seller appointment.This best enforcement policy provides the database that has known mute password and registration for instance.Although these passwords and registration are well-known, in fact not all keeper knows that they exist.Pre-defined rule can be configured to implement policy from such the best and eliminate the potential breach of security automatically.\n\nIn one embodiment, business rule can be by business rules process 112 management of DAS 110.Policy engine 114 can be used business rule.The ability that produces business rule makes DAS 110 can extend to the particular network environment.For example, threaten the event type of the content-data of a company can be different from the event type of the content-data that threatens another company.In described embodiment for example, each company can both define its oneself business rule, to satisfy himself needs.And the fabricator can have the expertise that its client does not have.This fabricator can provide the device that has pre-defined rule (for example DAS 110), so that the client uses.\n\nAlthough embodiment for example shown in Figure 4 has described the particular order of pursuing a policy in detail, other embodiment can use other to carry out similar policy in proper order.The order of pursuing a policy alternatively, can be by the network user or keeper's definition.\n\nFig. 5 illustrates the method by the change monitor database system of the identical system directory of monitor database.In describing the method for Fig. 5,, the parts that are fit to of the step or the function that are used to carry out described method only are shown referring to the content of Fig. 1.Generally speaking, database system catalog comprises about the metadata of table, row with just at the data element of monitored Database Systems.This system directory will for example provide the row of particular database table and the definition of pattern.The definition that this system directory also can provide data element, row and table how to be relative to each other.\n\nIn step 510, obtain to be known as accurate system directory, as the reference paper that is used for comparing in the future.This system directory can read from database 132 when being accurate at known this system directory for instance.For example, this can be corresponding to the just incident behind audit database.Alternatively, the copy of system directory can directly be imported this system.This system directory is as the basis that compares for later analysis.\n\nIn step 520, another system directory to be analyzed reads from database 132.Reading the first system directory later time section, can read next system directory from database 132.In one embodiment, with the gap periods of network manager's appointment ground execution in step 520.For example, in order to make the validity maximization of this method, per minute or every several seconds execution in step 520 are to carry out relatively between first system directory and system directory afterwards.Alternatively, when expecting almost not have incident to upset database server 530, execution in step 520 once in a week.\n\nIn step 530, execution analysis operation or program are to compare second system directory and first system directory.Execution analysis is to determine how to have changed since first system directory, second system directory since the time that database 132 reads.\n\nStep 540 provides and has produced the report that the mode that changes system directory subsequently is described in detail in detail.For example, can list the tabulation of all changes of system directory, can be identified as all new row that particular table is created, and/or list schema modification another table.Make great efforts to determine subsequently system directory and first system directory between in the whether unusual process, can be by security personnel or keeper's audit report of network.Potential the keeper can be triggered unusually or the security personnel reacts.\n\nAs the possibility of execution in step 540, provide to be used for programmatic ground (programmatically) and to determine the other method that more whether has abnormal data between two system directories.If determine unusual the existence, then send and be notified to Network Management person or security personnel.Like this, such embodiment will operate otherwise the step that will manually carry out automatically.\n\nFig. 6 illustrates by detection and distributes to the variation of privilege of the user on the network and the method for monitor database system.Unless privilege is monitored, otherwise such possibility is always arranged, someone can find a visit and edit himself privilege to obtain the more visits of Internet resources and the path of control on network.If someone one group of privilege is revised or obtained undesiredly, then Lan Yong detection will become very difficult.The new privilege that gives the user only strengthens the activity of user's mandate, thereby makes that the detection of its abuse is difficult more.In describing the method for Fig. 6,, the step of the method that is used to carry out description or the parts that are fit to of function only are shown referring to the content of Fig. 1.\n\nStep 610 provides the privilege data of the user privilege on becoming known for recognition network stores this privilege data when being accurate.For example, privilege data can be stored after it is by hand inspection and investigation.This also can be corresponding to a row privilege data that has for example read from database server 130 at special time (thinking safely that wherein privilege data does not have mistake or abuse).\n\nIn step 620, from just reading privilege data at monitored database server 130.This can carry out in any time after database server 130 obtains one group of initial privilege data.In one embodiment, reading this data frequency is determined by the keeper.\n\nIn step 630, the privilege data that will read in step 620 compares with the privilege data that reads in step 610, to determine whether privilege data exists any unusual hint.In one embodiment, any variation of privilege data can trigger compare operation, exists unusually to show.Yet in another embodiment, the variation before showing unusually in the privilege data must be satisfied some criterion.For example, the number that can require privilege data on the network to change keeps below and specifies number.Alternatively, can ignore the variation of some lower-level privileges.\n\nIf determine not exist unusually in step 630, then the privilege data that supposition is read from database server 130 in step 620 in step 635 is correct.In one embodiment, in the execution subsequently of for example shown method, this privilege data is gone out with the base of making comparisons.\n\nIn one embodiment, if exist to change in the privilege or other is unusual, then step 640 provides and has produced notice, gives keeper and/or security personnel with the variation in the notice privilege data.Variation in this privilege data can be seriously to run counter to network security.\n\nFor monitor privileges, the method in past is the user privilege of periodically checking on the network.Typically, this is by manually finishing, thereby more more franchise than its privilege that should have if given the user, then this hand inspection will finally detect it.In this case, network subjects to such situation, and the user can use its privilege, changes privilege, uses new the mandate to use previous out of use Internet resources then.This user can be changeed back its privilege its original setting then, to avoid detection.\n\nBecause privilege data can read and analyze automatically, so for example the embodiment of Fig. 6 description has solved such problem.And privilege data can read continuously, or at least so that the frequency that the quick variation of privilege data can be detected reads.\n\nPossibility as 640, another embodiment provide the variation that produces between general introduction or outstanding at least this two groups of privileges or difference and/or the report of the notice that is sent out owing to variation/difference.\n\nAccording to an embodiment, can once read metadata (for example system directory) and privilege data.Alternatively, can read data of different types at different time.For example, can read the content-data of more multiprocessing resource from database server 130, to guarantee not overload of DAS 110 at different time.\n\nAccording to an embodiment, analyze the mode of content-data, metadata and privilege and can on particular network, make amendment, use the mode of network and the historical mode of generation of interested time with explanation.Such embodiment has integrated trend data, to revise the program implementation of analyzing various types of data unusually in order to check.\n\nFig. 7 illustrates in order to adjust the method that the mode of carrying out the one or more programs be used to discern abnormal data is used for mode of learning the analytic trend data.The same with previous embodiment, the reference of the content among Fig. 1 is only illustrated the step of the method that is used to carry out description or the part that is fit to of function.For example, according to the embodiment that describes among Fig. 7, DAS 110 is configured to the monitor database incident, and adjusting its program implementation, thereby it can determine when better and guarantees notice.\n\nStep 710 provides data to read from database server 130.Wherein data can be described among embodiment forward from the mode that database server 130 reads.\n\nIn step 720, determine on DAS 110, to activate \" mode of learning \".This mode of learning can obtain the pattern of trend data or the expression of the historical act in other past corresponding to DAS 110, and handles notice, result and/or definite how being used that trend data is made to watch network manager/operator.Whether activating mode of learning is that the user selects.For example, can provide the selection of icon wherein or other characteristic can trigger mode of learning and become movable user interface to the keeper.With similar pattern, the keeper can cancel selected mode of learning.\n\nIf mode of learning is activated, then step 730 provides trend data obtained.This trend data can be obtained in many ways.This database server 130 can be reported the data that converted to trend data by DAS110.But another module monitor database activity is with the activity of determining to be carried out with the administrators/operators that receives this notice by designated.Alternatively, DAS110 can observe database server 130.The theme of this trend data can comprise that whether corrective action is taked in the detection in the past of response abnormality data, and what those corrective action comprise.\n\nStep 740 provides can be by one or more routine analyzers of DAS 110 execution based on the trend data renewal.But the complexity of trend data Impact Analyzer can change.On simple grade, the repetition of ignoring can observe in trend data unusually continuously.Then, can be ignored by DAS 110 if decide unusual detection this subsequently.On more complicated grade, statistical study can be used for the analytic trend data to seek tiny difference.\n\nIn one embodiment, as the result of mode of learning activity, but any change that informing network keeper or operator make routine analyzer.Can give the chance of any renewal of the result of keeper or operator refusal to being identified as the study trend data.\n\nIn step 750, routine analyzer is updated, and carries out in the data that read from database server 130 then.For example, the specific column or row that are at least the data of fetching from database 132 change the comparative parameter that is used to carry out average program or distributed program.For the privilege data of analyzing in the method for in Fig. 5, describing, but be the particular privilege usage trend Data Update of comparison basis.Similarly, in the method for in Fig. 6, describing, for the system directory on the basis that compares can be updated similarly.Other renewal based on the method for learning trend data to description among Fig. 4-6 also is possible.\n\nIf in step 720, determine that mode of learning is not activated, then step 760 uses the routine analyzer of setting up that the data that read from database are analyzed.\n\nAfter step 750 or step 760, step 765 determines whether to detect abnormal data.Like this, mode of learning is that this movable fact can not hinder DAS 110 its routine analyzers of execution.If detect abnormal data, then step 750 provides notice to be sent out.In addition, method begins repetition from step 710.That is, may be in the time afterwards, other data are fetched from database.\n\nIn one embodiment, if mode of learning is activated, and abnormal data is detected, and then step 710 repetition afterwards can be used by the mode of learning of deactivation and carry out.This can be convenient to the abnormal patterns consideration in trend data.\n\nSince by the result that the method for describing among Fig. 7 for example provides, can be out in the cold otherwise will be defined as potential some unusual content-data based on bygone spare.For example, can be monitored corresponding to the content-data of employee's salary.At monitoring period, set up the trend that employee's new salary was recorded before employee's reposition.\n\nLike this, for example, be elevated to senior employee record and can show that the employee has been subjected to big lifting, and show that the employee has new post after several days or a few week from elementary.Though new salary is unusual for the work before the employee, can use for example method of Fig. 7, thereby DAS 110 knows between time that the new salary of employee is recorded and employee post are recorded in time in the database 132 and has delay.DAS 110 approvals do not need notice corresponding to the potential abnormal data of employee's salary.On the contrary, whether DAS 110 can wait for to watch writing down and will show subsequently that this employee's post changes.\n\nCan comprise report generator by the characteristic that for example described embodiment provides.Report generator can be the auto-mechanism that produces report for network manager/operator.This report generator can be module or the similar logic that forms the parts of DAS 110 (Fig. 1).This report can be summarized or the outstanding specific exceptions that runs into.The result of trend data or trend data can be described in report in addition.In one embodiment, report also works to replace notice.\n\nCan comprise archiving mechanism by another characteristic that for example described embodiment provides.This archiving mechanism record is about the various information of the use of DAS 110.The record of all abnormal datas that run into is also contained in this information.In addition, the result of trend data or trend data can be filed.This archiving mechanism also can be other parts of module or DAS 110 (Fig. 1).\n\nArdware overview\n\nFig. 8 illustrates the block diagram according to a computer system 800
