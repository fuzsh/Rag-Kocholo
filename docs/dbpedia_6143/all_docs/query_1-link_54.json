        "text": "Albert Lim\n\nManaging Director SolarGy Pte Ltd SolarGy Pte Ltd is one of the leading professional system integrators of solar PV systems based in Singapore. The founder of SolarGy, Albert Lim, has been a practicing M&E consulting engineer for more than 25 years. Leveraging the founderâ€™s background knowledge and experience, SolarGy delivers optimum solutions to Clients from a designer's perspective. The result is a PV system that is not only high in performance but integrates seamlessly into the building architecture. Since its incorporation in 2007, SolarGy has successfully undertaken several notable PV projects for Clients such as NTU, NUS, PUB, Resorts World at Sentosa, Keppel Infrastructure Trust, CapitaLand, SingTel, Singapore Polytechnic, Temasek Polytechnic, NEA, NParks, ST Aerospace, SP Group, 3M, etc. In his 25 years of practice as an engineering consultant, Mr. Limâ€™s work culture has been centered on professionalism, commitment, and passion. This is the same culture that he brings forth to SolarGy. It is this business model that leads to the companyâ€™s success in securing several large and iconic solar PV projects within a short span of time of its incorporation. In particular, SolarGy managed to clinch the largest PV project in Singapore of 500 kWp at the Universal Studios in Resorts World At Sentosa within 2 years of its incorporation. It is the company's vision that by designing efficient and creative solar energy solutions, they will enthuse and attract more building owners to consider solar energy as an alternative or to supplement their energy needs. In turn, this strategy will help to cut down carbon emissions from our home country and to the world at large. With the above sustainable business model in place, SolarGy became the first company in Singapore to receive the prestigious Frost and Sullivan Award for Leadership In Solar PV Market Penetration in 2010. In February 2013, SolarGy broke their previous track record by completing the single largest PV system at the Keppel Seghers NEWater Plant â€“ a 1 MW solar PV project with more than 4000 solar panels sprawling over about 10,000 sqm of roof space. In 2014, SolarGy again won the single largest PV project in Singapore - a 5MW PV system at the NTU and a 1 MW PV system at the PUB Choa Chu Kang Waterworks. To date, SolarGy has successfully completed 16 MW or solar PV systems with a further 8 MW currently under construction. Being a registered Professional Engineer, SolarGyâ€™s Managing Director is well placed to engage with the various technical agencies such as EMA, Singapore Power, SCDF, URA, BCA, etc. so the design and installation of the PV systems are optimized while meeting the minimum regulatory regimes.\n\nJeff Ericson\n\nCities are my passion. I've been studying, wandering in, exploring and dreaming about cities since I was a kid growing up in Denver. We had 'busing' in Denver and in first grade I'd start my day in a 1960's functional school building (McMeen - we were the 'Meanies') in a white middle class neighborhood, and mid-day be bused to an almost identical building near Montbello (Smith) in a black middle class neighborhood. The long trip up and down Monaco Blvd going from one to the other was like traveling through a cross section of the earth, complete with jewels and bones and curiosities of all types. These two neighborhoods didn't look so different, but all the voices around me said they were. I've since traveled all across this great country, in South America, Europe and Africa; for the longest time I studied the buildings - the great ones and the plain ones: or thought I did. Only much later did I realize that the important stuff is everything else. The people, the spaces between buildings, the roads, sidewalks, and connective tissues of our cities and towns. Those details that appear accidental but happen in every town, and those products of engineers and committees that could be anywhere or nowhere, and that too often don't really work. It's a funny thing - we used to think a lot less intensely about how our cities should be, but those cities were much richer places to live. About 6 years ago I left Architecture â€“ making props for our towns isn't scalable, and it isn't satisfying. Architecture today has very little to do with delight, and way too much to do with compliance. Transportation isn't sexy, but it has much more impact on people's lives, and for most of us, in a very real way, access to transportation is the key to opportunity and self-determination. Itâ€™s also our best hope for strengthening communities and supporting our local businesses and shops. RubyRide is excited to play a part in the next chapter of the Great American Cities and Towns.\n\nJeff Ericson\n\nCities are my passion.

Neither; if Udyogvardhini of Solapur has its way. This is an NGO that helps and trains women to become entrepreneurs through self-help groups. It is the brainchild of Chandrika Chauhan, an award-winning entrepreneur, politician and an amazing success story in her personal life. Get Moneylife's Top Stories by Email abc@abc.com SUBSCRIBE Chandrika was born and brought up in Ahmedabad in a family that was almost illiterate. She moved to Solapur after marriage to Shambhu Singh Chouhan, who has dedicated his life for various nationalist voluntary organisations. Ms Chauhan, known as ‘bhabhiji’ to those who work with her, had to become the bread-winner of her family due to her husband’s frail health. For several years, she worked with a consumer forum and the Jankalyan Samiti. Soon she began to take up tailoring work and catering contracts with the help of women in her neighbourhood. This not only helped turn her into an entrepreneur, but also exposed her to the problems and hardships that women from lower-income groups faced in their domestic lives. Over time, she built a larger network and also helped women become entrepreneurs in their own right. The network that she built up, and the people she helped through her work, helped her enter politics. She was elected as a corporator and served the Solapur Municipal Corporation for two terms. In 2006, she gave her work a formal profile by starting Udyogvardhini initially aimed at making rural women independent. Catering is an important part of its activities and core strength. The organisation is famous for its ‘kadak bhakari’ which it has managed to market as a packed local speciality from Solapur. It also made a name for itself for being able to deliver large food orders (hygienically cooked and well-packed) or chapatis (unleavened bread). On one occasion, it produced a massive 100,000 chapatis for a mass wedding organised by the Lokmangal Foundation. Under Ms Chauhan’s leadership, Udyogvardhini quickly expanded its activities to a range of activities including stitching, making cotton handbags, files, purses, shopping bags, etc; running beautician’s courses. Women are encouraged to explore business opportunities and trained in all these activities. The focus on women’s empowerment includes running adult literacy programmes and even teaching women to ride two-wheelers to become independent. In fact, women who are capable of turning entrepreneurs are specifically trained in activities such as buying raw materials, marketing, billing, taking orders, supplying finished products and even filing tax returns. Helping the old and needy through its old-age home and providing food to the destitute is also a part of its social activities. In an interesting experiment, it offered shelter to visually challenged girls and trained them to be self-sufficient. These girls were accommodated at the old-age home; many of them are now married and have moved away. Udyogvardhini aspires to set up a proper training centre to provide job-oriented training and also train self-help groups. It also plans to expand its old-age home and to set up an orphanage. Asked about the challenges that the organisation faces, Ms Chauhan’s team says, “Solapur is a labour-dominated town and the per capita income is low,” consequently, raising funds and getting donations from people is one of the biggest challenges. It has to find donors from large cities and attracting their attention to its work is no easy task. Due to lack of funds, Udyogvardhini is not able to employ trained staff, as salary is the main concern. But the NGO and its founder have seen innumerable awards and honours come their way and got support from the local government for its work. Readers who wish to donate to Udyogvardhini will get tax benefits under Section 80-G of the Income-tax Act.\n\nAlbert Whale\n\nIT Security is lead by its founder, Albert E. Whale.

I didn’t know it then, but I was running on empty. I barely had enough power to get through the things I had to do, let alone the things I wanted to do. I was going through the motions of life but somehow lacking the joy and the enthusiasm I once knew.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine I once worked as a prosecutor with the US attorney’s office in the Los Angeles District Attorneys office. I didn’t know it then, but I was running on empty. I barely had enough power to get through the things I had to do, let alone the things I wanted to do. I was going through the motions of life but somehow lacking the joy and the enthusiasm I once knew.\n\nBack in 1989, a chance meeting with spiritual master Sri Sri Ravi Shanker changed all that. Who could have guessed a few moments a day could change how I think, feel, act, and up-level my happiness quotient? Since that chance meeting, I have traveled the globe teaching that ancient wisdom of India to hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life.\n\nI’ve had the privilege of working with Fortune 500 CEOs, celebrities, parents and students to help them manage their mind and emotions and to live a more resilient and fulfilled personal as well as professional life. In addition, I’ve had the opportunity to conduct programs for organizations such as Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, Lyft, NBC Universal, LinkedIn, Gap, The World Bank, Shell Oil, Morgan Stanley, Harvard University, MIT and many more.\n\nWitnessing the transformation in hundreds and thousands of lives, I was inspired to write The Power of Vital Force. The book not only demystifies the ancient wisdom of India but also makes the tools and techniques practical and accessible for daily, modern life. I continue to up-level the lives of thousands of individuals, couples, groups, and organizations as I transform my own life through the beautiful wisdom of Vedanta.\n\nAlbert Whale\n\nIT Security is lead by its founder, Albert E.
