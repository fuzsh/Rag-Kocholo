Its benefits of productivity and policy enforcement have been understood for some time, but it was widely regarded as a technology that was too hard to deploy. There is now wider agreement on standards and a much better understanding of how to conduct a successful project. At the same time the business case is becoming more compelling as the scale of automated interoperation with entities outside the enterprise grows, including the growing use of cloud services.\n\nOvum view Identity and access management must be approached as a business issue and designed around business processes. It is fundamentally about how the organization works with its people and with other organizations. IAM projects must be approached with a comprehensive and long-term vision, but it is best to implement it incrementally in phases, each with a clearly defined business benefit. The total investment will be large, but many parts of the process can be expected to pay for themselves in months. While extensions to the project can be expected to deliver lower rates of return than the lowhanging fruit addressed by the early stages, the overall project should still represent a good investment as there is no requirement to implement the full vision in one project.\n\nKey findings:\n\nIAM projects require upfront and continuous high-level business sponsorship.\n\nAddress pain points first and deliver significant and quantifiable benefits to demonstrate the value of the approach.\n\nFederation of identities between collaborating organizations has been enabled by general acceptance of the main standards, including the WS-* family and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions.\n\nUse of cloud services creates an important application for IAM.\n\nIAM is an essential tool in delivering compliance and protecting information.\n\nBusiness may soon be able to connect to Internet identity services that will be useful for authenticating people outside the organization.\n\nThe role of IAM What is IAM? IAM is the discipline of determining policies for who has access rights to information assets in an organization, the issuing of these rights, and the implementation of the consequent access controls. It is at the heart of information protection, and of compliance programs with all regulations that control access to information.\n\nIAM is the discipline of determining policies for who has access rights to information assets in an organization...\n\nHistorically IAM was limited in scope and delivered as a function of operating systems. It has emerged as both a business concern, and a broader field of technology, as business IT systems have developed from a collection of siloed systems into a complex network of interconnected systems, which are connected to systems in partner organizations and to customers, employees and other users across the Internet. The complexity of managing large numbers of users on multiple systems requires an automated and processdriven system to satisfy both the efficiency and security needs of the organization.\n\nCHAPTER 1: MANAGEMENT SUMMARY\n\n11\n\nCloud services require IAM The adoption of cloud services by organizations places greater urgency on the need to deploy comprehensive IAM systems. When valuable information is placed in a cloud, the access controls to the system become the only protective layer for that information. It is therefore essential that the access controls to the cloud service are maintained in a state that is consistent with the corresponding access controls in the data center. The cloud service provider can and should be seen as a business partner.\n\nIAM must recognize the diversity of users Mobility, whether between workstations within a building such as a hospital or factory, or between working locations, requires IAM to provide an easy to use and consistent user experience. Automated processes, extending beyond the enterprise walls, require a pervasive access control mechanism that recognizes corporate entities and other processes as having equivalent access control needs to those of human users.\n\nBusiness issues The business case IAM is a key issue for the business. Implementing a system represents a major investment and its deployment will require changes in business processes to capitalize on its benefits. However, successful projects provide a high return on investment and a payback period of less than two years is frequently achieved. IAM is a useful, if not absolutely essential, tool for satisfying the more demanding regulatory and compliance requirements. It provides the audit and reporting functions to determine, with a high level of confidence, who has done what with critical information. The business benefits of IAM come in two main categories: productivity/ease of use, and security. In the efficiency category, we can list:\n\nReduced cost of administration due to automated approval processes, synchronization of permissions, and user self-service functions, including password resets that typically account for 25% of IT help-desk workloads.\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO) to raise end-user productivity by providing quicker access to systems, and reducing the burden on users of having to manage multiple sets of credentials. People who use several systems, or work from workstations in multiple locations, can save substantial amounts of time in a typical day.\n\nImproved experiences for external users, leading to more business, and better collaboration with business partners.\n\nFrom a security perspective, good quality and effectively deployed IAM provides:\n\nRapid and accurate provisioning and de-provisioning of users, minimizing unauthorized access to information and processes.\n\nThe opportunity to adopt more secure forms of identification and authentication, including two-factor authentication, further enhancing access controls.\n\nFull audit and logging capability of user sessions on corporate systems.\n\nIAM is a means of implementing business strategy insofar as it relates to information processing.\n\n12\n\nIAM is a means of implementing business strategy insofar as it relates to information processing. The issues of who the business needs to work with, the level of automation that is required in these interactions, and the depth of trust between organizations, are represented in the IAM configuration and deployment. Internal issues also have a major impact on the architecture of IAM systems, such as employee mobility, integration of IT systems following mergers and acquisitions, and the way in which compliance obligations are met.\n\nIDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 2011/12\n\nRunning a successful IAM project IAM projects are neither quick nor cheap. It is therefore essential that they IAM projects are have the wholehearted support of senior management and that this support neither quick nor is sustained throughout the project. Project managers can help to sustain cheap. this enthusiasm by adopting a phased approach to the project, with clearly defined business benefits flowing from each phase. This approach also minimizes both the technical and business risks, as design errors can be rectified before they become widespread.\n\nExternal identity on the Internet We are now entering an era in which individuals can call up “Internet identities” that carry a level of assurance that we do not have with the self-asserted identities that are almost universal on the Internet today. For the business, this will open up new ways of communicating with customers and others that do not have a strong existing relationship with the organization, at a lower cost than pre-registering them with the organization. While this prospect is still at an early stage of its evolution, standards work largely promoted by the US government provides a basis for identity services along with a potential business and liability model.\n\nOrganizational issues Federation technologies have to align with business relationships Identity federation technology allows organizations to work together, with individual users being identified and held responsible for their actions across all of the collaborating entities. It avoids the need for replicating user registration in each organization by regarding their employer as the authoritative source of information about them. It also ensures that any changes in their status are immediately applied across the whole eco-system. The technologies available for identity federation reflect the business structures to which they are applied. Traditionally the most deployments have been to a “hub and spoke” model in which the key organization federates to several of its partners such as its suppliers or channel partners. This model also works well between a company and the subsidiaries it has acquired or created. More complex webs of collaborating organizations can be supported with “claims-based” networks, and managed services are appearing to simplify the deployment of federated networks.\n\nTaming the super user A comprehensive IAM suite will provide a means of securing and hiding all super user accounts...\n\nComputers, networks and applications have traditionally been managed through an account called “administrator” or “super user”. The requirement for 24 x 7 operation has led to several people having access to this account. Across a large organization, with thousands of servers and applications, there has been a proliferation of privileged and effectively anonymous accounts. This has created a nightmare for both security and compliance officers.\n\nA comprehensive IAM suite will provide a means of securing and hiding all super user accounts and assigning administrator privileges to the individual users who are authorized to perform these roles. This ensures that they are monitored and held responsible for all the actions they perform in this mode and deals with segregation of duty issues.\n\nThe extended enterprise In addition to integrating the management of partner organizations, IAM helps to define who works within an organization. Human resources departments are often only concerned with permanent employees, whereas IAM systems have to provide for all users. Even the payroll department has no record of contractors who are paid, directly or indirectly, through the purchase invoice system.\n\nCHAPTER 1: MANAGEMENT SUMMARY\n\n13\n\nIAM systems can be integrated with physical access systems, enabling physical and logical access to be controlled through common credentials and providing an extra channel of authentication by correlating system access with physical location. When this approach is adopted, the IAM registration process has to be extended to include all people who are entitled to enter the premises, irrespective of whether they use IT systems.\n\nTechnology issues The scope of IAM IAM systems are technically complex, comprising the following functions:\n\nenrolment of users\n\nprovisioning/de-provisioning of access rights to users, in accordance with corporate policies\n\nrole management\n\nroutine user administration, including functions such as issuing credentials and password reset\n\naccess approval and revocation processes, and escalation of disputed issues\n\nidentification and authentication of users, including flexibility to adapt authentication to match the appropriate level of business risk; an important part of this function is SSO functionality to a wide a range of resources by a single act of logging in to a workstation\n\ncontrol of access to all information and process resources according to policy\n\nreporting and auditing of actions relating to access permissions and access usage\n\nacceptance of corporate entities and automated processes as “pseudo-users”\n\nfacilitating usage of corporate resources by business partners and customers, according to appropriate policies and controls.\n\nIAM projects are based on IT and process integration IAM projects are mainly integration projects. The largest parts of the work in an IAM deployment project are in configuring the system to reflect the business, and in integrating the components of the system with the infrastructure of the organization. A major factor in selecting an IAM suite is its fit with the existing technology in the organization. SSO requires the IAM system to be integrated with each platform and application that it is required to support. Vendors provide connectors to some common applications with their product, while other assets will require bespoke connectors using APIs. In many cases these can be bought from third parties. The foundation of every IAM system is one or more corporate directories, and most support Active Directory and any Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)-compatible directory. Organizations will want to automatically move existing user registration information from existing data stores, which may be either directories or files. The ability to re-use existing configuration data will significantly affect the duration and cost of the IAM project. The task of integrating with external organizations, including cloud service providers, has been made easier since the industry moved towards a common set of supported technologies. In particular Microsoft’s acceptance of claims-based communications, including the use of SAML assertions, has removed a major stumbling block to federated working. Integration is a two-way activity and today the level of integration offered by cloud service providers is limited, but this situation will improve.\n\nAdministration and workflow Identity administration tasks can be complex, particularly when authorization requires the participation of multiple asset owners. IAM tools should provide a workflow-based configurable process model. It is advantageous if this workflow engine is open and allows the integration of IAM processes with wider management processes, so that provisioning can be seamlessly and automatically incorporated into other management activities.\n\n14\n\nIDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 2011/12\n\nMarket issues The market for IAM products has undergone substantial consolidation. The market for IAM While many specialist vendors remain serving individual parts of the products has product spectrum, the number of comprehensive suites is limited. Most of undergone the providers are the major IT vendors. They have continued to acquire substantial specialist vendors to fill gaps in their product range, with the result that they now have almost completely covered the required range of functionality. consolidation. They can still be differentiated in terms of how well individual components in their suite meet the needs of an organization, but the major area of differentiation is in their level of integration with the wider IT environment. As the implementation of IAM projects is largely a consultancy exercise, channel partners are also an The emergence of important factor in selecting a vendor.\n\nidentity provider services on the Internet will provide a new area of opportunity for businesses.\n\nThe emergence of identity provider services on the Internet will provide a new area of opportunity for businesses. However more work needs to be done to establish a business model for such providers. The value of services to the relying parties who will use the services is clear. The only conceivable revenue model is one in which the relying party pays the identity provider, most probably with a per-use payment. Providers could charge according to the level of assurance of each identity. One obstacle to the development of this market is that the main candidates for providing such services are organizations (such as banks) that do not see being an identity provider as one of their core business concerns. The other major obstacle is the need for a limited liability model that meets the needs of both sides.\n\nRecommendations Recommendations for enterprises Every large, and large-medium, enterprise needs an IAM system to enhance its operational efficiency and to improve its security and compliance posture. Smaller organizations should review their particular circumstances. IAM projects are about business process automation and need to be approached from a business perspective. IAM deployments need to be carefully planned, and deployed incrementally. Most of the major vendors provide a comprehensive coverage of the solution space, but some are easier to use and to integrate with existing infrastructure. An IAM project is mostly about integration with the IT infrastructure and with business processes. These are the areas that need most attention.\n\nRecommendations for vendors IAM is one of the most strategic areas of corporate IT. Success in the IAM sector will place a firm in a strong position to influence corporate-wide IT policy. IAM is an essential companion to information protection, and both technologies have enhanced business value when they are deployed together. IAM is never an island, and integration and interoperability with the wider environment are primary product differentiators. Focus on ease of deployment and flexible use.\n\nThe Ovum IAM Decision Matrix The Ovum IAM Decision Matrix explores the competitive dynamics within the IAM security market and is designed to help organizations make informed choices among the leading offerings. It presents a view of the market based on three factors: technology assessment, user sentiment, and market impact. It offers a snapshot view of the market as it stands today, and indicates those vendors that, in Ovum’s opinion, organizations should shortlist, consider, or explore. The results of Ovum’s in-depth research are summarized in the following table. Vendors are listed in alphabetical order within each category.\n\nCHAPTER 1: MANAGEMENT SUMMARY\n\n15\n\nConsider\n\nShortlist\n\nRating\n\nCompany/Solution\n\nOvum Opinion\n\nCA CA Identity and Access Management Suite\n\nCA’s IAM portfolio is among the most comprehensive in the IAM space. The company’s current IAM positioning focuses on “content aware identity management”, which incorporates IAM, data loss prevention (DLP), and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) integration.\n\nIBM IBM Tivoli Identity and Access Management Products\n\nIBM is among the largest and most successful vendors in the IAM space. Its coverage includes enterprise and web SSO, user provisioning and role management, password management, access control, and federated identity management services.\n\nNovell Novell Identity Manager 4 Advanced Edition\n\nNovell Identity Manager 4 provides a comprehensive suite of IAM products. Novell delivers an enterprise-class IAM product set that has the scalability and high availability required to deal with large, complex, and diverse operating environments. However the company’s market impact is significantly lower than that of its main competitors.\n\nOracle Oracle Identity and Access Management Suite (release 11g)\n\nFollowing its acquisition of Sun, Oracle has become even more of a market leader in the IAM space. It has a strong presence across all traditional IAM markets including financial services, healthcare, and the public sector and its geographic reach is also extensive. Oracle provides a very comprehensive set of IAM capabilities with a good focus on enabling customer usage across all available platforms.\n\nEvidian Evidian IAM Suite (version 8)\n\nEvidian delivers a near-full suite of IAM products. However, the company’s influence remains largely restricted to European markets. It provides a good range of enterprise and Web SSO, user provisioning, and access control services, and strong support for standards and authorities.\n\nHitachi Hitachi-ID Portfolio\n\nHitachi is not a strong contender in web access management or the web and enterprise SSO markets. It does, however, provide good quality user provisioning, access control, and password management services, and is respected for its privileged user management capabilities.\n\nMicrosoft Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager 2010 and Associated Products\n\nMicrosoft’s impact on the IAM market continues to grow. It is well respected across enterprise and web SSO, user provisioning, password management, access control, and federated identity management dimensions. It is seen as a low cost provider of IAM technology and a supplier that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are likely to turn to as their first IAM provider. Continued on the next page...\n\n16\n\nIDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 2011/12\n\n...continued from the previous page.\n\nExplore\n\nRating\n\nCompany/Solution\n\nOvum Opinion\n\nEntrust Entrust IdentityGuard, GetAccess, & TransactionGuard\n\nAlthough SSO and provisioning services are provided by third-party partners, Entrust remains a strong contender in the authentication and fraud management space. It also exhibits good password management capabilities.\n\nRSA RSA Identity & Access Management\n\nRSA is the authentication market leader and partners with Courion for provisioning and role management. Across security areas adjacent to IAM such as security information and event monitoring, DLP, and GRC, RSA is strong and active. However, the growth in its overall IAM capabilities has failed to keep pace.\n\n1.2 Report objectives and structure Report Guide The report is aimed at chief information officers (CIOs), chief security officers (CSOs), IT managers, business strategy managers, business analysts, system architects, development managers, and other senior decision-makers in both IT and the business.\n\nChapter 2: Business and technology issues in IAM This chapter summarizes the content of this report and provides a deeper insight into the need for identity and access management (IAM). It focuses on the delivery of IAM projects, their scalability and complexity issues, and the corporate investment required. It addresses the requirement to improve business processes, the need to support the use of cloud-based services and the growing requirement to be able to federate identities between organizations. It also considers the changing vendor landscape, which continues to be rationalized.\n\nChapter 3: Identity and access management and compliance The deployment of IAM is a vital component of any enterprise security strategy. It provides the foundations for controlling who has access to operational information systems, and as such aligns technology-based controls with business and operational rules and access policies. Improving the organization’s security position helps towards achieving regulatory compliance. Domestic, industryrelated, and international regulations all have an impact on the actions that companies must now take in order to be compliant. IAM solutions should not be purchased just to help tick compliance boxes. However, the value of the technology to businesses brings together important efficiency improvements such as providing streamlined access to systems, delivering efficient user provisioning and role management services, and providing the ability to accurately control and report on user access rights.\n\nChapter 4: Identity services in the cloud Today identity continues to reside mainly in individual websites with little or no interaction between them. Users have to identify and authenticate themselves to each site or service in order to gain access. Also, once users have given personal information to a site, they have no control over how the information will be used. Site operators have very little confidence in the accuracy of the information they are given. An identity infrastructure that works across sites must be based on policy and semantic interoperability. We also require standards that go beyond syntactic and semantic levels and embrace business process issues such as assurance, privacy, and liability. They must be both privacy-enhancing and cost-effective for both users and website operators. An interoperable identity infrastructure that would be recognized at multiple websites would provide a major advance towards a truly connected world.\n\nCHAPTER 1: MANAGEMENT SUMMARY\n\n17\n\nChapter 5: Federated identity The use of technology allows businesses to run lean and efficient supply systems. To support the approach, organizations rely on all required components being available at the optimum time. Having full visibility of stock levels, product delivery dates, new pricing tariffs even when that information is the property of a partner organization, adds real value to decision-making processes. Federated identity management technology can be used to create local, as well as global, interoperability between online businesses and trading partners using agreed identity management approaches. Utilizing a SSO approach, allows users to move between business systems of their own organization and beyond corporate boundaries to access third-party systems.\n\nChapter 6: Technology comparison The technology comparison chapter presents Ovum’s view of the leading IAM vendors and their technology solutions. It includes feature comparisons of the technology along with decision matrix information on the vendors and market analysis information.

Identity and access management (IAM) is an essential tool for compliance and a key component of information protection in open collaborative working. More than this, however, it is a productivity tool enabling tighter working practices, collaboration, and automation of some error-prone, laborious processes.\n\nOvum view IAM is a business issue, and projects must be driven by business priorities. However, many other factors need to be taken into account, and a lot can be learned from organizations that have completed successful projects. Future proofing must be built into deployed systems. IAM is an idea whose time has come, as it can be considered a strategic component of adopting cloud services.\n\nKey messages\n\nIAM projects are large-scale investments.\n\nBusiness processes need to be overhauled.\n\nCloud services add urgency to the need to federate identities between organizations.\n\nThe vendor landscape has been rationalized.\n\n2.2 Identity and access management projects are large-scale investments Business strategy must drive technological decisions Identity and access management is a business process. The requirements for handling identities and the use that is made of these identities are determined by how the business wishes to operate. IAM is a fundamental pillar of security strategy, while the security and regulatory requirements that the business has to satisfy are also determined by business, rather than technological considerations. It is the job of technologists to meet business needs. Business leaders must specify their requirements.\n\nThe requirements for handling identities and the use that is made of these identities are determined by how the business wishes to operate.\n\nIAM systems link organizations, and inter-organizational relations must be driven by business managers. The level of buy-in from these associated organizations will depend on the configuration of the chosen system. The configuration can range from a close two-way federation of their respective IAM systems to a more basic arrangement that allows employees of the partner organization to use the primary party’s resources as external users. However, any level of inter-operation requires a business understanding of the status and assurance level of the other party’s identity credentials and a commitment from both parties to keep their identity bases up to date. Both of these require businesslevel convergence.\n\nCHAPTER 2: BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY ISSUES IN IAM\n\n21\n\nIAM systems change the way in which users interact with IT systems. Provided that the system is welldesigned, these changes should have a positive impact on the user experience. Security will certainly be enhanced. However, access will be restricted in some cases and this may block some established working practices, particularly where roles are not well documented or IAM systems change understood. The business must be prepared for these inconveniences and have a method for rapidly resolving issues as they arise. the way in which\n\nusers interact with IT systems.\n\nIAM projects are large and costly. Without substantial business buy-in at the highest level they will not be completed. They have to be integrated into business processes, which will inevitably disrupt the business process to some extent. The process owner must be an enthusiastic supporter of the IAM project to ensure the necessary commitment through this stage. A rough estimating rule is that buying professional advice and assistance is likely to cost five times as much as the technology. The “identities” in IAM systems mostly relate to people. (Some systems may also manage systems, processes, and corporate entities.) They contain personal information that is subject to privacy legislation, and organizations that do not have IAM practices that meet all legal requirements risk substantial penalties. Therefore, a technical failing One way to reduce within the IAM system can have substantial business-level repercussions. risk and maintain This risk increases when an IAM system integrates silos of information that business previously only existed within small systems in departments.\n\ncommitment to the\n\nOne way to reduce risk and maintain business commitment to the project project is to roll out is to roll out IAM incrementally, delivering real business benefit at each IAM incrementally... stage and starting with “low-hanging fruit.” Fortunately, IAM is well suited to incremental rollout by dicing up according to organizational units, systems and applications, and user groups. The majority of the cost of a project goes into the configuration, data acquisition, and process definition aspects, rather than into technology acquisition. This makes an incremental rollout viable. Ultimately, the business and political issues are significantly more challenging than the technology issues involved in IAM projects. The project is about managing people, not user accounts.\n\nThe benefits of IAM IAM delivers many business benefits, ranging from good governance through security, improved user experiences, and productivity enhancements to cost savings. While every IAM project is different, it is realistic to aim for a project whose benefits will pay for the project within 18 months. A comprehensive, enterprise-wide project will typically take longer to recover its costs as it embraces aspects with a lower return-on-investment, but organizations can configure a project to fit a required rate of financial return.\n\nWhile every IAM project is different, it is realistic to aim for a project whose benefits will pay for the project within 18 months.\n\nIAM systems can enhance user experience and productivity. Single sign-on (SSO) to multiple platforms and applications removes the need for users to remember different user IDs and passwords, which they often feel they have to write down. It avoids the irritation and wasted time of having to repeatedly re-authenticate information to the system.\n\nIAM systems automate the provisioning process for new users and users who take on new roles. The time required for the provisioning process is typically reduced by 90%, from days to hours. The new user is therefore able to become productive much more quickly. This is particularly significant for contractors and short-term hires, for whom the provisioning time can significantly add to employment costs. Identity federation allows the provisioning of a user in one environment to extend to collaborative environments immediately and automatically. Moving forward, IAM will be at the heart of open-enterprise computing.\n\n22\n\nIDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 2011/12\n\nThe direct financial savings of IAM come from the automated provisioning and de-provisioning capabilities and reduced IT helpdesk workloads. Typically 25% of IT helpdesk workload is eliminated due to the much-reduced number of forgotten password calls. Many IAM tools provide self-service password reset capability, which can further reduce the password-related workload. Process improvements in the areas of access request consideration and approval and periodic reviews of access permissions deliver further savings.\n\nIAM is an essential element of corporate compliance and security\n\nThe direct financial savings of IAM come from the automated provisioning and deprovisioning capabilities and reduced IT helpdesk workloads.\n\nOrganizations should deal with compliance as part of their operational infrastructure. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) require organizations to restrict and monitor access to sensitive information. IAM IAM provides provides auditable policies and a control framework that addresses many auditable policies requirements of compliance. Many aspects of compliance require an and a control organization to control who can perform certain functions to reliably monitor framework that who does what, and to raise the consistency of process performance. addresses many When used in conjunction with logging tools, IAM can provide a wealth of requirements of information about who did what and when. Logging tools need the strong and accurate access control tools provided by IAM to be certain that the compliance. reported user was the actual user. Four aspects of the benefits of IAM are:\n\nAccess rights can be more closely aligned to roles and responsibilities.\n\nTraditionally IT users with administrator-level privileges can do almost anything on the systems on which they enjoy these privileges. Furthermore, because of the need to keep systems operating 24×7, several people are often given administrator rights to each system, sharing the same user credentials. This creates the perverse situation in which the most privileged users are not subject to personal accountability for their actions. The better IAM systems can block all anonymous systems access, restrict all administrator-level access to sensitive data, and provide separation-of-duty controls.\n\nThe ability of IAM systems to automatically remove access rights from leavers and employees who move on to different roles blocks one major category of inappropriate access to systems. This deprovisioning function is one of the most important security functions of an IAM system.\n\nIAM systems can give much faster and easier login to systems, removing the very real temptation for users to share sessions on machines in common access areas, and hence provide a level of personal accountability for user actions. The value of this feature is seen in hospitals with the access patient records and in financial dealing rooms.\n\nThese benefits also help raise the security of corporate systems. Additionally, IAM can enhance security by bringing in stronger authentication systems than were previously available. Traditionally authentication is built into platforms, systems, and applications and offers little scope for changing the default mechanism. IAM systems can allow the flexibility to adopt different forms of authentication, use two-factor authentication, and even vary the level of authentication according to the current characteristics of a session or the business being transacted.\n\n...IAM can enhance security by bringing in stronger authentication systems than were previously available.\n\nThese security enhancements are essential to satisfying e-governance requirements because the associated reporting is meaningless without personal responsibility. Data loss prevention (DLP) systems are similarly hamstrung without a reliable indicator of who is handling a piece of information. The combination of IAM and DLP is particularly powerful, and can be configured to implement data protection policies that are appropriate for specific countries, for example.\n\nCHAPTER 2: BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY ISSUES IN IAM\n\n23\n\nHow to run a successful IAM project The key to success in an IAM project is to focus on the business issues. Too often they are technologydriven and fail as a consequence. We have already discussed the importance of getting buy-in and commitment at the highest levels of the organization. The next prerequisite is to know your users and understand what they do and how they do it, The key to success remembering that actual practice may have diverged from theoretical in an IAM project is processes over time. If the new IAM-related processes do not fit with to focus on the business practices, the project will fail.\n\nbusiness issues.\n\nThe aim should be to introduce the maximum amount of automation into the processes. This will win the support of key business movers as well as providing the necessary payback. When selecting products, ease of management should be a key consideration. The selected product should enable you to specify each change in access rights or processes once, and have it rolled out across the enterprise automatically and consistently. Pay particular attention to any pain points in the existing processes and ensure that they The IAM system are mitigated in the new system. should be capable of The IAM system should be capable of seamlessly and effortlessly incorporating any changes in employee working practices, particularly relating to flexible working and homeworking. It is likely that within the lifetime of the IAM system the organization will have moved some way towards allowing employee-owned endpoints, and that virtual client technology will be widespread.\n\nseamlessly and effortlessly incorporating any changes in employee working practices, particularly relating to flexible working and homeworking.\n\nWe have also mentioned the importance of cross-enterprise working in modern business. External users need to be deeply integrated into IAM in a form of federation. However, there are different federation architectures and it is important to choose the right one, considering future changes that may occur in the way the business operates. The main choice is between a “hub-and-spoke” configuration in which the central player takes the main role in establishing bilateral relationships, and a many-to-many model in which a central federation service negotiates claims by people who require access to any organization in the network.\n\nAbove all, when you are ready to implement the IAM system, adopt an incremental rollout and review the success of each phase as you go, refining the details to resolve issues that arise. Incremental rollouts reduce the capital risk by partitioning the project budget, and allow proven economies to be recognized as justification for following phases of the project. They also help to win support for the project. In particular, SSO has to be configured to accommodate each application, platform, and service that it embraces. These targets can be implemented in batches. Incremental rollout and pilot projects can also be used to validate the processes that are being defined within the It is important not to IAM system – for example, to remove bottlenecks in the approval process.\n\noverlook the need to educate users before they are brought into the scope of the IAM system.\n\nUse existing identity stores to avoid unnecessary reinvention of the wheel. 75% of enterprises will find that their Active Directory (AD) will give them the bulk of their required configuration file. However, all imported data should be reviewed for currency and accuracy to avoid perpetuating bad practices.\n\nIt is important not to overlook the need to educate users before they are brought into the scope of the IAM system. It should not be assumed that the new working methods will be self-evident. It is also a good idea to communicate with users during the implementation phase and afterwards as the system is extended and improved. There are complex issues involved in extending the IAM system to customers and others who are not employed by either the organization or its federated partners. In particular, there is the question of what information about each person needs to be held in the system. Within the workplace, a person’s identity is usually primarily about the roles they perform.\n\n24\n\nIDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 2011/12\n\nFor external users, identity is about their relationship with the organization. For customers this could include their payment information, relationship history, and identity assurance requirements. Each situation brings its own requirements, and the system needs to be designed around them. External users should not be regarded as “pseudo-employees” because this approach will not deliver the required security level or meet business requirements. For example, there is no defined “leaving” process for external users that could trigger their de-provisioning. External users have particular needs for controls on the disclosure of their attributes that are held in the system, because this information tends to be personal.\n\n2.3 Business processes need to be overhauled Managing non-employees in the workforce IAM systems provide a single central authority managing the identities of system users. This is in itself a culture shock for many organizations in which the management of contract and temporary staff is often handled at departmental or project level, with little reference to the HR department. The accounting department, with its responsibility for payroll, is often closer to being the global authority of current workers. However, in some cases staff may be paid locally or through the invoice process, rather than through the central payroll.\n\nIAM systems provide a single central authority managing the identities of system users.\n\nThe IAM system often has to manage access for workers employed by subcontractors on site who are not covered by any direct payment system. In some organizations volunteers work on the company system. The group of people who are entitled to be in the building and use the IT system is often much wider than the current employees. All of the issues surrounding access rights management are magnified many times when looking at user accounts with administrator privileges. Administrator accounts are, by default, all-powerful and anonymous. Each platform, system, and application may have an administrator to manage it and keep it in good health. As work needs to go on around the clock, several people need to have these powers to ensure that at least one will be available when needed. Business systems run across many servers and applications. This leads to a proliferation of administrator accounts. For example, Ovum knows of one organization that has 86,000 users and 100,000 administrator accounts. The anonymity of administrator accounts makes it impossible to assign personal responsibility for the actions of such users. We look to IAM systems to “hide” the administrator accounts and only allow users to exercise them after they have logged into the system as a normal user and through the IAM system itself. The access rights to information held within the system can also be restricted through the IAM mechanisms. These opportunities should be exploited. Although using Removal of user external IAM services is an option that many organizations have successfully rights and deexploited, particular sensitivities about outsourcing the management of provisioning of administrator accounts need to be considered.\n\nAll of the issues surrounding access rights management are magnified many times when looking at user accounts with administrator privileges.\n\nLeavers\n\nusers who cease to work for the organization make up one of the most important functions of the IAM system...\n\nRemoval of user rights and de-provisioning of users who cease to work for the organization make up one of the most important functions of the IAM system from a security perspective. However, integrating this apparently straightforward task into business processes can be complex. Whereas the arrival of a new employee is a single-step process, their departure is long and drawn out, going through several stages. In the simplest case the departure process is triggered by the employee’s resignation. Their leaving date should then be known, but may not be cast in concrete at this stage. They may have more restrictive access rights at stages during their notice period. With redundancies or disciplinary procedures, the process becomes much longer and more complex. These processes all have to be captured within the IAM system, and each change in the status of the employee must be recognized in the system immediately.\n\nCHAPTER 2: BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY ISSUES IN IAM\n\n25\n\nWhen we consider volunteers, subcontractors, and other non-employees in the system, the process becomes even more confusing. What event signifies or triggers the user’s departure? How is this communicated to the IAM system? Do subcontractors retain any residual maintenance functions after they finish their period on site? One possible approach to this problem is to re-certify the access rights of all non-employees periodically, but this may place an unacceptable burden on managers.\n\nMergers and acquisitions Mergers and acquisitions place a heavy burden on IT administration. The consolidated business will be working towards a single comprehensive IT infrastructure to achieve economies of scale and rationalization. However, this is only achievable at a reasonable cost if it is a long-term objective. In the meantime, there is a need for a convergence strategy that will enable interoperability and start to realize cost savings. A unified IAM system The easiest way to should be at the heart of the convergence strategy.\n\nembrace diverse infrastructures immediately is to federate the parts using an identity federation tool.\n\nThe easiest way to embrace diverse infrastructures immediately is to federate the parts using an identity federation tool. This avoids the need to enroll a user in both parts of the organization, and can provide the basis for SSO across the enlarged enterprise. This scenario is a relatively simple scenario for deploying identity federation as there are no issues surrounding inconsistent standards of identity assurance to resolve. In this scenario, the deployment team can focus on the technical issues.\n\nMoving forward, the business will want to increase the level of convergence towards total unification. The IAM system should allow the move to be made incrementally, with federation technology ensuring that users retain their necessary access permissions on both sides of the merged organization.\n\n2.4 Cloud services add urgency to the need to federate identities between organizations Use of cloud services requires corporate identity to be externalized Many organizations are using or planning to use cloud services. The issues surrounding access control are particularly important for cloud services. Public cloud services are accessible to anyone on the Internet, with only the access control mechanism between the corporate intellectual property and the outside world. Services implemented in a soMany organizations called “private cloud” on the corporate Intranet are also relatively open to are using or unauthorized access. Access control to cloud services has two main requirements:\n\nplanning to use cloud services.\n\nUser authentication has to be strengthened to reflect the ease of access to the service portal and the value of the information and processes behind that portal.\n\nThe directory of authorized users of the service has to be kept up to date. It needs to be automatically synchronized with the internal corporate IAM directory to be both secure and efficient.\n\nAccess control based on user IDs and passwords held within the cloud service does not meet either of these requirements. The best option is to configure the cloud service to accept assertions from the corporate IAM system as the only means of gaining access to the service. The user experience would require the user to log in to the corporate system and then enjoy an SSO transfer to the cloud service when required during their session. The strength of authentication is determined within the internal IAM environment. A possible compromise is to configure the service to use an assertion from the corporate system as a second authentication factor. This can deliver most of the security benefits of full integration, but it does not give the user seamless access to the cloud service or perform automatic provisioning and de-provisioning.\n\n26\n\nIDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 2011/12\n\nWhile this discussion represents current best practice, regulators and legislators lag behind technology. Organizations may find their options restricted by regulatory impositions. For example, financial services regulators generally dislike passwords being shared between services. It remains to be seen how they will react to a claims-based access regime, which effectively means using the same password as the user’s system login.\n\nFederation delivering benefits The early history of identity federation saw most deployments in configurations in which a central organization wants to improve collaboration with several of its business partners. Typically a large corporation would want to tighten its relationship with its suppliers or channel partners. The two major civil airline manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus, both made extensive and successful use of identity federation technologies, along with major The other area for automotive manufacturers. which federation The other area for which federation has delivered substantial benefits is bringing together the parts of an enterprise following a merger or acquisition. Federation is starting to move out into more diverse deployments, including ones in which there is a more flexible community of organizations than the rigid “hub-and-spoke” configuration in the early deployments. Some of these deployments are enjoying a simplified design by adopting the managed federation services available in the cloud.\n\nhas delivered substantial benefits is bringing together the parts of an enterprise following a merger or acquisition.\n\nEven when federation services are used, the user identities are retained inhouse. The common characteristic of all federated identity deployments is that each user identity remains with the user’s employer, and the employer asserts their access rights to the other partners when required. This ensures that other partners do not incur a user management overhead by participating in identity federation, as well as protecting the privacy of the individual.\n\nTechnology issues IAM usually focuses on controlling access to systems and information by human users. However, in the collaborative and automated business environment that is emerging, the concept of identity needs to be broadened to include corporate entities, computers, processes, services, and applications. Integrated cross-organization automated processes need to control access by all of these. These can collectively be described as “objects”, taking the terminology from the object-oriented programming world. Thus, IAM systems need to be able to The claims-based manage identities for any such object, and these objects need to have the approach to intermeans of identifying and authenticating themselves.\n\norganizational access control is a sound basis for moving forward.\n\nThe leading IAM suites available today are fundamentally architected to deal with objects of all types, but some of the user interface components need to be tailored to fit these broader concepts.\n\nThe claims-based approach to inter-organizational access control is a sound basis for moving forward. Unlike some earlier protocols, it is scalable and flexible. Claims are simple statements that can be composed into more complex requirement statements using the basic operators in Boolean logic such as “and” and “or.” Using these avoids the Many organizations significant administrative burden of maintaining access control lists.\n\nfind role Many organizations find role management a particularly difficult task. Roles management a define sets of entitlements and are an efficient method for grouping employees who perform similar duties. Most IAM suites allow individuals to perform a set particularly difficult of roles. However, many employees perform tasks that are not identical to task. those of any other person in the organization, particularly those in management or knowledge-worker fields. In these cases, roles become cumbersome and confusing. IAM products should allow administrators to combine role-based access permissions with additional individually allocated permissions, and should not force everyone into the role model.\n\nCHAPTER 2: BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY ISSUES IN IAM\n\n27\n\nThere is a divergence of opinion about whether IAM systems should manage both access to IT systems and physical access to facilities, or whether they should be limited to information system access. Cost and complexity are increased if physical access is included. However, the combined approach allows:\n\nThe leveraging of identity credentials such as smartcards\n\nthe use of a single identity directory, giving some economy\n\nsecurity to be enhanced using a joined-up view – for example, physical presence can become an implicit authentication factor.\n\nHowever, a unified approach means that you will have to register everyone who works on site, even if they never use the IT systems – including cleaners and security guards.\n\n2.5 The vendor landscape has been rationalized The vendor landscape has consolidated around big IT suppliers The vendors of the main IAM suites have been acquired by the big IT infrastructure vendors. In some cases, such as with CA, IBM, and Oracle, the vendor has made a number of small and large acquisitions over time to arrive at its current position. In contrast, some vendors such as Microsoft and Novell have largely built up their IAM offerings by internal product The vendors of the development. The current dominance of the market by the big players is a main IAM suites consequence of the central role that IAM plays in IT management and have been acquired delivering IT compliance. Organizations want to buy fundamental capabilities from a strong vendor with which they already have a substantial by the big IT relationship and whose IAM systems will fit in well with their IT infrastructure environments. The vendor landscape reflects the fact that IAM projects are vendors. “big-ticket”, long-term, and strategic. The trend towards big vendors has also been driven by the commercial aspects of this market. Until recently IAM vendors found it difficult to make a profit in a relatively slow market. However, the consultancy work that went with an IAM project was more lucrative. This encouraged vendors with large consulting practices to be active in IAM.\n\nThe trend towards big vendors has also been driven by the commercial aspects of this market.\n\nA large group of vendors specialize in particular aspects of the technology, such as identification or authentication, clustered around the IAM suite providers. These include smartcard providers, biometric product vendors, and suppliers of a range of innovative authentication approaches. These products can interact with IAM suites using standard protocols such as the biometric application programming interface (BioAPI) protocols, supplemented with various amounts of bespoke integration work.\n\nSun’s demise has provided the latest crumbs The club of IAM suite providers is now quite small and fairly stable. However, there have been two notable exits in recent years. In 2008, HP sold its IAM practice to Novell, which was already a major player in the space. In 2010, Oracle completed its acquisition of Sun Microsystems, including the latter’s IAM products. As both vendors had comprehensive suites, there is a lot of rationalization ahead, with most cuts falling in the former Sun portfolio. Oracle has provided an open The club of IAM path, allowing organizations that currently use Sun’s suite to migrate to its products, in addition to incorporating a few Sun products into its range. suite providers is now quite small and However, Oracle faces competition from Courion, which has also laid out a migration route for Sun users and is a strategic provisioning partner of RSA.\n\nfairly stable.\n\nAs IAM is becoming increasingly strategic, both infrastructure vendors and security vendors that do not have an IAM offering are looking less credible in their fields. Most aspects of information protection require an awareness of who is accessing the information.\n\n28\n\nIDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 2011/12\n\nThe focus of security is to move from network security to information protection, throwing the spotlight on gaps in the vendor’s portfolio. At the same time the limited number of players limits the scope for partnerships, which in most cases would be with a competitor. The number of potential acquisition targets is now small. Currently, we can only speculate on how vendors such as HP, Symantec, Cisco, and Intel/McAfee will respond to the new market perspective.\n\n2.6 Recommendations Recommendations for enterprises IAM is a strategic project that needs a strong, long-term business strategy behind it. If the project is executed well it will deliver a high rate of return, both financially and in terms of improved governance. It must be driven by business considerations and supported by buy-in at the highest levels in the organization, not least because it will require changes in business processes. Implementation is best approached in an incremental fashion. IAM is as much about working with partners and outsiders in the extended enterprise as it is about the internal IT systems. Systems must be designed to accommodate any foreseeable expansions and extensions in the working realm. Cloud services are about to boost the importance of IAM in the enterprise. The cloud service provider can be regarded as an important business partner that needs to be brought into the federated identity net.\n\nRecommendations for vendors IAM is also strategic for vendors. It is a sticky technology that can reduce customer churn by locking customers in to building processes around your technology. IAM is now more than just an opportunity to drive consulting engagements, and has become a cornerstone around which to build systems management, compliance, and security offerings.\n\nCHAPTER 2: BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY ISSUES IN IAM\n\n29\n\nIncorporating\n\nTechnology Evaluation and Comparison Report\n\nOVUM Butler Group\n\nCHAPTER 3: Identity and access management and compliance\n\nWWW.OVUM.COM\n\n3.1 Summary Catalyst The use that is made of identity and access management (IAM) technology within the public and private sector is growing in line with the threat environment. Most organizations understand the need to maintain control over who is allowed to access their information assets. They recognize the negative impact that not having the proper identity management controls in place can have on the organization and its reputation. They also appreciate that industry regulators have the power to extract fines and impose sanctions when organizations fail to fulfill their compliance obligations.\n\nOvum view The deployment of IAM technology should be seen as a vital component of an enterprise security strategy. The use of IAM is foundational to controlling who has access to operational information systems. Knowing which users are allowed to have access to which information systems and aligning control with the operational rules and access policies improves the organizations security position and helps towards achieving regulatory compliance. Domestic, industry-related, and international regulations all have an impact on the actions that companies must now take in order to be compliant. IAM solutions should not be purchased just to help tick compliance boxes. The value of the technology to businesses ought to bring together important efficiency improvements such as providing streamlined access to all available systems, efficient user provisioning and role management The deployment of services, and the ability to share systems access with authorized third IAM never was and parties. It should also address the need to protect the integrity of businessis not likely to sensitive data; controlling as well as facilitating access for information users become an easy fix helps to reduce data theft and fraud.\n\nfor broken The deployment of IAM never was and is not likely to become an easy fix operational for broken operational structures. The implementation of the products can be complex and difficult to achieve and maintain. There have been many structures. examples of organizations that have struggled to gain business value from the technology, often because they have been unrealistic in their objectives, or have failed to gain project buy-in at the highest levels of management. However, when an organization gets its IAM deployment strategy right, operational improvement, continuity, and security benefits accrue and as a result compliance and audit advantages become more achievable.\n\nKey messages\n\nIAM delivers services that are relevant to business improvement, continuity, protection, and compliance.\n\nRegulatory compliance has a demanding impact on most organizations.\n\nAudit adds urgency to the need for a better IAM infrastructure.\n\nContinuity and the lifecycle approach to managing identity delivers business value.\n\nEveryone needs to be accountable.\n\nAchieving and proving compliance is a key business objective.\n\nCHAPTER 3: IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE\n\n33\n\n3.2 IAM delivers services that are relevant to business improvement, continuity, protection, and compliance IAM provides vital business services Organizations evolve and change as the demands of their operations grow or indeed contract. Competitive influences dictate that most businesses are constantly looking to improve their existing operations.\n\nA common theme that runs across many business requirements is the need to make use of IAM to understand and control who has the right to access our systems...\n\nCost controls dictate that more must be achieved with fewer resources and always more efficiently. Automation, self-service, and a whole range of associated approaches are used to deliver improvements. Similar demands are placed on continuity requirements, such as the need to efficiently deliver corporate services while remaining fully protected and, importantly, achieving the above objectives without falling foul of compliance regulations.\n\nA common theme that runs across many business requirements is the need to make use of IAM to understand and control who has the right to access our systems, what use they can make of that access and where they are allowed to gain access from. As such, it is no surprise to find that IT administrators struggle to keep pace with the need for change and at the same time maintain a balance between the organization’s desire to improve its operations and its need to remain secure.\n\nIAM can be used to improve service delivery – but beware Business improvement, efficiency savings, and the sometimes conflicting need for operational continuity are often addressed through an attempt to deliver an increased level of automation. This usually involves growth in the use of self-service and online facilities. For IT administrators working with IAM systems, there will be a need to improve service efficiency and deliver automated user provisioning, authentication, and access control services that meet the self-service requirements of the business and its users. Since the earliest Active Directory (AD) and associated Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) management systems made their way onto the market, the value to business of controlling users has been widely recognized. That is not to say that technology associated with the management of identity that we conveniently bundle under the IAM label has always been particularly successful in achieving these objectives, but at least the opportunity has been there. For many organizations the struggle continues, and for those that have deployed fully-featured IAM solutions or selected components of IAM the resulting benefits have often been less than impressive. Problems have occurred for a number of reasons. Some are directly attributable to the vendors and the solutions that they deploy being too complex and impractical. Others fall squarely at the feet of end-user organizations that have not fully understood the internal commitment that successful IAM projects require. Organizations have gone into identity management projects without a clear enough vision of the ultimate objectives, or have simply tried to do too much too soon.\n\nOrganizations have gone into identity management projects without a clear enough vision of the ultimate objectives, or have simply tried to do too much too soon.\n\nIn such cases, IT has had to either go back to the basics of locally managing identity directories or starting up second- or even third-generation IAM deployments.\n\n34\n\nIDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 2011/12\n\nControlling identity and user access is vital Making use of IAM technology to achieve business improvement and continuity benefits and, at the same time, remaining secure and compliant involves the deployment of good quality IAM services that are also easy to use.

At the same time, those elements of control that ensure that unwelcome visitors can be rejected and the compliance components used to scrutinize how access to business-sensitive systems and their data is controlled must also be maintained.\n\nBusiness improvement and compliance objectives need to be addressed A driving force behind the use of technologies such as IAM is the competitive nature and efficiency demands of business organizations.\n\nA driving force behind the use of technologies such as IAM is the competitive nature and efficiency demands of business organizations. In many organizations, changes to business operations continue at a fast pace; updates and additions to user communities, operational work groups, and project teams can be just as dynamic and, as such, need to managed as efficiently as possible. Without the structure and management components that IAM provides, organizations will struggle to keep pace with the maintenance overheads needed to ensure that users and the data controlling their access rights are kept up to date. Integrated IAM is required to support business improvement and at the same time to ensure that compliance objectives are not ignored.\n\n3.3 Regulatory compliance has a demanding impact on most organizations Organizations need to deal with compliance as part of their operational infrastructure Maintaining regulatory compliance and ensuring that the operations of an organization remain within the required parameters involves combining the use of good technology controls, ensuring that systems users are responsible for their actions, and putting controls in place that are both usable and effective. Depending upon the industry and geographical location of the business, different regulations, rules, and interpretations of compliance mandates apply. The Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act, while not forcing the use of specific security products, takes in the requirement to be able to maintain the validity of corporate information and control who has access to it. Where there is commonality for rules and processes that can be applied to specific regulations such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for the handling of financial data or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the healthcare sector there is the opportunity set up and make available common operational processes. For example, PCI DSS dictates that where sensitive data are being processed or held, those data need to be encrypted; the rules and regulations also determine how long and under what circumstances those data can be held.\n\nCHAPTER 3: IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE\n\n35\n\nWhat organizations must do to ensure that they do not repeatedly fall foul of regulations that have already been addressed is to make sure that the information that they hold cannot be subverted during normal operational activities. Information relating to customers, citizens, finances and so on may be held legitimately. That said, if access to A fundamental requirement for the sensitive information is not continuously controlled then all the compliance efforts that have gone before count for nothing.\n\nprotection of sensitive data involves controlling who has access and influencing what users can do with data once access has been granted.\n\nA fundamental requirement for the protection of sensitive data involves controlling who has access and influencing what users can do with data once access has been granted. Importantly, it must also involve having the knowledge and information required by the company’s auditors to be able to prove that the right user controls were applied.\n\nIn an ideal world the demands of the chief information security officer would be for reliable, accurate, auditable IAM controls that safeguard and manage all access to key business systems and the sensitive data that they hold. Realistically, however, we have to accept that restrictions will be placed on what can be achieved, because of What ought to be the costs involved and IT budget restraints. considered is how IT What ought to be considered is how IT can make better use of the IAM facilities that they already have in place, how the operational use of user authentication and access control facilities can be aligned to the acceptable risk profile for the organization and how IAM can be used to improve the security and compliance profile of the business.\n\ncan make better use of the IAM facilities that they already have in place...\n\nAddressing the compliance challenges and drivers Properly deployed IAM services deliver usability for an organization’s authorized users and invoke controls that help to maintain security and compliance. The requirements of the organization should include achieving full control over user access rights and, in doing so, providing the audit trail and management reporting facilities that prove that control is being maintained. This involves the use of stop-and-block controls, but ought to also include the use of warnings, alerts, and reports that are delivered to the appropriate authorities when suspect activities take place. Starting operational compliance involves having the ability to record all identity-related events, which includes both accepted and rejected access attempts. It involves making effective use of technology to automate the controls that are needed to allow or deny access, to detect and report on wrongdoing, and to deliver corrective actions.\n\nSome of the latest access control and systems management problems that organizations face involve external influences.\n\nSome of the latest access control and systems management problems that organizations face involve external influences. These originate with both the business partner organizations and users that need to be controlled and the mixed operational environments that need to be supported. IAM has to be capable of working on behalf of mixed user groups across mixed physical, virtual, and cloud based operations.\n\nThe requirement involves the ability to maintain control. Specifically, it is about managing the provisioned rights of users to ensure they are kept up to date and that all de-provisioning elements are also effectively addressed. For leavers and users whose role within the organization has changed, this is a particularly important issue. Included within this area is any separation of duties that needs to be applied. This specifically includes access controls that are focused on privileged users, with the intention of ensuring that all user entitlements are proportionate.\n\n36\n\nIDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 2011/12\n\nAddressing specific compliance issues with IAM PCI DSS PCI DSS does not force the use of specific protection products or services. It does, however, define industry best practices for how credit and debit card information should be handled while being stored or communicated during transaction processes. PCI DSS data protection requirements that need to be maintained involve the strengthening of common security protocols; specifically, this includes reducing the opportunities for unauthorized users to access customersensitive information. It includes ensuring that external access channels are properly controlled and also has implications for what access internal users (employees, contractors, etc.) should be allowed to have.\n\nPCI DSS does not force the use of specific protection products or services.\n\nFollowing various widely reported data-thefts incidents, many caused by internal users, there are specific PCI DSS requirements that are intended to limit employee access to customer credit card and associated financial information. Such access controls need to be measured and maintainable and supported by reporting services that satisfy the needs of IT and the company’s auditors. PCI DSS dictates that user access to financial data (credit and debit card data) should be limited to users who clearly need to see and work with this information. It specifically requires organizations that handle card data to implement strong access control measures. The act states that access by business users must be on a need-to-know basis. Authorized users must be assigned a unique identity so that their access requests can be recorded and analyzed, and to ensure that physical access to cardholder data is controlled.\n\nHIPAA HIPAA compliance, with its specific focus on the healthcare sector, and that industry’s increasing dependence on constantly updatable patient information, present a number of interesting identity challenges that can be addressed through the use of IAM. The focus is on the need for improved security and privacy and further demands for efficiency and quality of service. The regulations and standards that are applied alongside HIPAA are wide-ranging.\n\nIAM can be used to provide administration and access controls that protect sensitive medical records.\n\nIAM can be used to provide administration and access controls that protect sensitive medical records. The requirement is for products that are capable of controlling access to electronic records in complex enterprise environments. Healthcare systems share patient and associated healthcare data at local HIPAA data and national levels.\n\nThe underlying requirement involves controlling how information is collected, stored, and transported. Once this is achieved, however, the key objective switches to how healthcare institutions are able to keep operational data available and accessible and safe from unauthorized use, which is where IAM has an important role to play.\n\nprotection requirements are supported by the IAM’s ability to control which users have access to particular systems, applications, and data.\n\nHIPAA data protection requirements are supported by the IAM’s ability to control which users have access to particular systems, applications, and data. By controlling and reporting on the management of users, their identities, and their access rights in line with the policies and operational rules of healthcare operations, the deliverable components of compliance can be achieved. Also the automated nature of IAM can be used to reduce the cost of healthcare compliance.\n\nCHAPTER 3: IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE\n\n37\n\nIAM takes responsibility for controlling user access; it also addresses privacy, security, and audit requirements. These are critical HIPAA issues, particularly when organizations are operating across distributed and networked environments. Allied to this is the need to change, update, or remove access rights when employees change jobs or move on. This is a specific business risk that IAM can be used to address. The management of user credentials falls into the same category of importance to ensure that usernames, passwords, and other strong access credentials are maintained. Other areas that IAM covers and are relevant to HIPAA compliance requirements include the enforced segregation of duties wherever this is appropriate, and directly linking the provisioning elements of user access to the role of each user within the organization.\n\nSOX The SOX act specifies that a company’s financial reports must be both verifiable and auditable. To achieve these objectives, organizations and their IT management must be able to prove that the company’s critical software applications are only available to approved personnel, and that access cannot be exposed to failure by human error or The SOX act sabotage. specifies that a\n\ncompany’s financial reports must be both verifiable and auditable.\n\nWhile SOX is not specific about which IT security systems should be deployed, it does require organizations to implement strong access control facilities in order to fulfill user management objectives. Audit and reporting\n\nIAM provides the required elements of identity management and access control. Therefore, when its use is supported by compliance-based best-practice templates, facilities can be tailored to address the needs of SOX. Examples of this include the provisioning of access rights to each business-critical system or information resource that is fully aligned with the individual’s exact needs as specifically defined by their job description or role within the organization.\n\ncapabilities can also be used to prove that only authorized users could have gained access to sensitive information.\n\nAudit and reporting capabilities can also be used to prove that only authorized users could have gained access to sensitive information. This level of control can be extended to necessary business process constraints and can be applied by provisioning and role management systems to include separation of duty controls and regular assessments of current access rights and privileges.\n\nCompliance demands are driven by common themes Among a number of common control themes that run across the regulatory compliance relationship between regulators and the organizations that are required to comply with their rules is the ability to prove who your users are and control what they are allowed to do. If you drill down into the regulator’s expectations of how identity ought to be used to control user access, there are elements that are standard to the general usage of IAM in most business operations. Where the additional requirements occur is around the issue of the information that is required to ensure that only the right users can access specific systems and their data. Even after adding the burden of proving that users are who they say they are and that their access rights are balanced and appropriate, and supporting the required controls with audit-level evidence, the use of IAM for compliance is not overly burdensome. These requirements make IAM into a frontline component of compliance. Its wide-ranging use across different industry verticals also makes it available to support the controls required by many different industry regulations.\n\n38\n\nIDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 2011/12\n\n3.4 Audit adds urgency to the need for a better IAM infrastructure Audit helps organizations to prove compliance Government and industry regulations, such as those mentioned in the previous chapter, demand that organizations exercise proper control over customer and financial data and business-sensitive systems. The requirement is to be able to prove compliance. How are organizations expected to achieve this in a way that is wholly acceptable to each regulatory body? One suitable method is being given a clean bill of health by an independent external IT audit report. Most successful enterprise organizations are both dynamic and busy. To maintain their required levels of efficiency they need to have facilities in place that automatically provision, maintain, and manage user identity resources. An important part of the complete resource management role involves the ability to record and report on all identity-related activities, including those that involve changes to user, role, and segregation of duty permissions.\n\nContinuous compliance assists with audit processes Continuous compliance is an objective that most organizations would love to achieve, but many struggle to get there. The vast majority of enterprise IAM products claim to provide a range of authentication, provisioning, role management, web and enterprise single sign-on (SSO), and password management facilities that address compliance issues. They also claim to be able to detect and remediate against anomalies found on an ongoing basis, and maintain all management information for future use.\n\nContinuous compliance is an objective that most organizations would love to achieve, but many struggle to get there.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that this particular level of good practice, if it becomes a reality, is viewed favorably by auditors. In real terms it helps to position the organization as being efficient and strong in the delivery of security and management controls. From a purely practical perspective, it can also help minimize the time that the auditors will then take to test and validate the organization’s security controls.\n\nGood IAM practice provides business benefits There are many different examples that show how IAM is being used to achieve compliance and how, through the use of automation, such activities also find favor with an organization’s auditors. One good indicator that is often put forward is that of how effectively employees that leave an organization or change their role are dealt with.\n\nOne good indicator that is often put forward is that of how effectively employees that leave an organization or change their role are dealt with.\n\nThe requirement for disowned accounts is spread across three levels. First of all, organizations need to know about and be able to identify all user accounts that are no longer valid; then they need to have the ability to take the required corrective actions. This may involve suspension, change management, or the removal of access rights. The final element in the process involves recording and reporting on the actions taken. The type of audit controls envisaged can also be extended to ensure that account managers carry out periodic review processes to certify that active users in their domain have the right access entitlements and, importantly, that they retain the need to keep those entitlements.\n\nCHAPTER 3: IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE\n\n39\n\n3.5 Continuity and the lifecycle approach to managing identity delivers business value Continuity drives the need for IAM So far we have covered IAM continuity as it relates to continuous compliance and to the improvement of audit processes. What have not yet been discussed are operational benefits and why it is important to take a more inclusive view of identity management and its access control facilities. There are two major elements that drive the need for continuous IAM control and with it the delivery of a lifecycle approach to the management of identity. There is the requirement to fully utilize the information resources in corporate data stores to trade as efficiently as possible. For example, making using of the Internet to provide access to corporate data and the web as a direct trading channel means that organizations can support self-service efficiency and customers can have 24/7 access. The other element is the ever-increasing range of threats and malicious attack approaches that threaten to destabilize web and associated real-time activities. From an IAM perspective, continuity starts with the ability to manage each user from the first time that they are provisioned with an initial set of access rights through to the time that their rights are removed. In effect, this means management of the complete user lifecycle, a definition that may sound inclusive enough, but in reality only scratches the surface. This is because the nature of doing business is constantly evolving. We now share information with suppliers and business partners and collaborate on projects. We provide customers and other system users with all-day, every-day access to our systems and information resources. Going forward, further interactive opportunities will emerge, they will need to be supported, and the lifecycle approach to managing users will continue to grow.\n\nOutsourcing and the use of managed services adds complexity In attempting to do more with fewer internal resources, organizations are taking up the option to outsource operations and services to contractors and are also using service providers to manage operational systems. Because all these external elements add complexity to business operations, they also increase the demand for good quality IAM solutions that are capable of automatically managing mixed communities of users across physical and virtual operating environments. A further issue is the requirement for continuity when considering the IAM controls needed The increasing to deal with internal and external users while still attempting to reduce volume of remote security risks.\n\naccess demands is changing the systems dynamics of IAM.\n\nIAM is an essential product in the battle to maintain control over who and what can gain access to information systems. However, bringing systems access and usage up-to-date and including the key considerations of web clients and general Internet access is challenging.\n\nThe increasing volume of remote access demands is changing the systems dynamics of IAM. It means that some longstanding identity management solutions are now overdue for an update. To remain fitfor-purpose, their services need to be brought up-to-date to meet the demands of collaborative working practices, shared information services, and operations where third parties, business partners, or service providers have control over everyday information assets.\n\nThe effective management of identity is a precursor to successful data loss prevention (DLP) IAM controls user access to operational systems and addresses many of the control issues related to regulatory compliance and audit. Another area of IT security that directly associates itself with the demands of the regulators is the prevention of data loss.\n\n40\n\nIDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 2011/12\n\nBusiness users can play a primary role in putting an organization’s data assets at risk.\n\nBusiness users can play a primary role in putting an organization’s data assets at risk. Therefore, the case for aligning the use of DLP solutions and their ability to protect sensitive data with core IAM technology that assigns and controls user access rights is a strong one.\n\nThe protection role of DLP involves the need to work with existing infrastructure systems such as AD and other common LDAP directories. It entails a requirement to integrate with existing IAM facilities in order to understand what systems access rights each user or group of users has. Leading on from this, once those access rights have been accepted, it also requires the ability to work with permission-based roles in order to ensure that what users go on to do complies at each level with the organization’s data usage policies. Controlling who has access to an organization’s systems and information resources becomes very difficult to achieve without an integrated relationship between core management systems such as IAM and DLP.\n\n3.6 Everyone needs to be accountable IAM provides organizations with well defined access management tools IAM technology provides the tools to ensure that effective access management facilities can be implemented across organizations. This represents the starting point for controlling the rights of each user.\n\nIAM technology provides the tools to ensure that effective access management facilities can be implemented across organizations.\n\nA common misconception is that having achieved this objective, the task is complete. This of course is not true. It is only the beginning of a continuous process that requires IT administrators, business managers, and responsible infrastructure departments, such as HR, to collaborate on the provision of effective controls.\n\nThe object is to provide information users with all the access rights that they need to do their jobs. At the same time, the correct security balance requires that the access provided is appropriate to fulfill a user’s role within the organization, and limited for compliance purposes to those systems and information resources that they need to have.\n\nThe object is to provide information users with all the access rights that they need to do their jobs.\n\nThat said, the needs of individual users constantly change; promotions change roles, new arrivals need to be provisioned, and leavers must have their systems access rights removed in a timely manner. Security aligned with usability is what needs to be achieved. IAM provides tools that can deliver the required objectives, but not without help from process owners and business managers. Arguments against the efficiency of IAM and its ability to achieve the required user control objectives suggest that previous generations of the technology were not up to the task because they focused purely on the security issues. They did not do enough to deliver a sustainable model of continuous access. Access governance that ensures that the policies of the organization are in alignment with the provisioning and role management elements of IAM is what is required. However, delivering this balanced approach requires the skills of a knowledgeable management team, good administration, and effective levels of automation from technology that can fit with both operational and compliance requirements.\n\nCompliance demands that users play their part Technology can be used to provide as many automated processes as an organization demands. Provisioning, password management, SSO and user self-certification processes have been improved for the benefit of the business and to achieve cost savings using automation and self-help approaches.\n\nCHAPTER 3: IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE\n\n41\n\nThat notwithstanding, any automated delivery approach is only as good as the back office rules, processes, and management that have been put in place to deliver the service.\n\nProvisioning facilities that are not properly controlled by strong rules and not regularly maintained by administrators and process owners can result in users having open access where this is not appropriate, or not enough rights to do their jobs.\n\nPassword management that is too easy to bypass or too complex to maintain has the same issues.\n\nSSO that is delivered with the right levels of control can be extremely beneficial to users and the business, but SSO without strong protection can put the whole organization and its information systems at risk.\n\nIn all these areas, self-service and certification can have an important role to play, but to ma"
