        "text": "Security, Confidentiality and Privacy in Health of Healthcare Data\n\nBackground One of the most important facts that should be considered is confidentiality in order to maintain privacy turning out to be matters of security. Keeping up confidentiality is a crucial factor in any field, as well as health realms. Professionals who have the ingress to approach the patients' communications must keep confidentiality in health. The priority for any human being is privacy to information especially related to health. Security enables us to live peacefully, without anxiety and in full insurance. Methods The interpretive methodology was used in this research as it gives an impression of face to face interactions in healthcare bringing in social reality of what is happening in the health society.Results In consultations on gathering these results for our research, we also realized that the most common threats of loss of data and theft come under certain types of disclosures mainly third parties, routine and inadvertent. Upon this realization, there must be notification to protect security, confidentiality and privacy when security breaches occur mainly to patients. As a result, patients must provide consent about their medical information in electronically form or in writing and the consent must be signed by the patient or family member or trusted entity. The patients must come clear on the nature of the information to be disclosed and where it should be disclosed and also when the consent should expire. At the same time, a health facility must take care of the institution's database and can only disclose to the management of the health institution whose obligation would also be to protect the data, as they might need the information for research purposes, where the researchers have approval from their institution's or to legal representatives.Conclusion The advent of the hype of electronic information technology leads to major inconvenience in the main areas of human life. This manuscript explores issues in maintaining confidentiality and privacy in healthcare and other analysis of its value to individual and society as a whole. \"Right to privacy is really important. You pull that brick out and another and pretty soon the house falls.
