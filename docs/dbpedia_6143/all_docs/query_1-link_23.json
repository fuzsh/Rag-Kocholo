Substantial debate remains as to whether 'cyberwarfare' is more properly an appendage of 'information war,' or retains the properties of other military sectors (such as electronic warfare). Yet, despite lacking a clear conceptual framework, spending in the cyberwarfare market is already substantial, as a range of governments and global military organisations move to secure their networks and is expected to increase further over the course of the forecast period, 2014-2024.
