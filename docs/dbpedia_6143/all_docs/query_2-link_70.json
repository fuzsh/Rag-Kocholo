        "text": "Fortinet, a unified threat management concern, hopes its new database vulnerability detection product can help database administrators sniff out exploits on enterprise systems before they can do any damage.\n\nThe Sunnyvale Calif.-based independent service vendor announced the launch of the FortiDB-1000B, a new security appliance to protect businesses against data theft from their corporate databases.\n\nThe device is designed as a diagnostic tool to identify and give notifications via the operating system about weaknesses in passwords, access privileges and configuration settings. It also has built-in evaluation and remediation advice for common compliance requirements such as Sarbanes-Oxley 404 and The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which were recently renewed.\n\nJason Wright, Fortinet's senior product manager for the product, said that for now FortiDB-1000B is slated to mesh well with medium-sized enterprises and allows database administrators to establish an audit trail and monitor possible weaknesses.\n\n\"It's another mode of security that hardens the OS,\" Wright said. \"Since the company has a rich history in network security, the logical step is to look at the database specifically, strategically and comprehensively from a security perspective.\"\n\nThe release comes at an appropriate time with a slew of high-profile thefts aimed at that database and with other ISVs such as Sentrigo, Inc., deploying database protection products of their own to complement Windows enterprise environments. For its part, the Fortinet product is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, Sybase and other database management systems, applications and services. Each Forti-DB appliance is said to have the capacity to support up to 30 concurrent databases.\n\n\"We're also planning both low- and high-end versions of the FortiDB product line later in 2008 and 2009, which will be able to support database instances of 10 and 60,\" said Jason Wright.\n\nMost enterprises hold personal and proprietary electronic data on database programs such as Redmond's SQL Server database application, whose security has been a recent priority for Microsoft due to an increase in SQL injection attacks.\n\nIn this environment, said Charles Kolodgy, security analyst for IDC, preventative and detective database products are no longer optional."
