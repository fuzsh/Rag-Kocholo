The winning security orchestration playbooks will be showcased in the Cortex XSOAR marketplace. Award categories include sponsored challenges from some of the industry’s biggest names, including AWS, Google Chronicle, Sixgill, and RiskIQ. There’s still time to enter -- join today and be a part of history!\n\nHackathon competitors will have their submissions judged by a diverse and esteemed panel of recognized cybersecurity leaders.
