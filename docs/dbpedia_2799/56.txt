CJLF-FM is a Canadian radio station, broadcasting a Contemporary Christian music format on 100.3 FM in Barrie, Ontario. Using the on-air brand name Life 100.3, the station was founded by Scott Jackson in August 1999 and is owned by Trust Communications Ministries, Inc, which is based in Barrie, Ontario. On August 27, 2006, CJLF-FM increased its power from 1.8 kW to 18.7 kW. This move was supported by many motorists who lost reception of the station while commuting to and from Toronto along Highway 400. As well, since there are no FM Christian stations in Toronto, it also serves the northern part of the Greater Toronto Area. The power was further increased to 40 kW in January 2007.
