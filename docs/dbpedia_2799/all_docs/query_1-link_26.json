        "text": "The Christian Community Church of Boswell will be hosting a coffeehouse event at 6:30 p.m. Friday. Recording artist Profound Revival will be ministering in song.\n\nProfound Revival is a Pittsburgh-based ministry. Band members, Josh and Andrea Richmond began playing music together for their youth group shortly after their marriage. Complimented for their unique sound, this duo writes and records all their work in their home studio. Their music demonstrates a blend of singer-songwriter and folk-pop with the incorporation of unique instruments such as a suitcase kick drum. Their most recent album, \"Images,\" is now available on all streaming platforms.\n\nThe evening will consist of a laid-back atmosphere presented in the church fellowship hall. Free pizza, hot dogs, desserts, various coffee blends, expressos and other refreshments will be provided. There is no charge for the event. The church is along Route 30, 1/4-mile west of Route 219 near Boswell. For more information, call 814-443-4061."
