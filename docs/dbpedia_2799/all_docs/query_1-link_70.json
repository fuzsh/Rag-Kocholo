        "text": "This book examines Andean oral traditions from the point of view of the social actors involved: the women of Qaqachaka, an Aymara-speaking ayllu-community in the Bolivian highlands. The detailed description of their lives contributes to the ethnography of herding and of Andean weaving. The experience of history viewed through oral tradition brings ethnohistory to life. And the attention to the verbal arts opens the way to an Andean poetics. The focus is on a particular genre: the songs to the animals. The transcriptions in the Aymara originals (text and music) with translations into English include the songs to the Andean camelids (llama and alpaca), and to the Old World animals introduced into the Andes centuries ago: goats, sheep, donkeys, mules, horses and oxen. The songs are contextualised within the animal marking ceremony, the llama mating ceremony, service on the way stations called tambo, the tax-paying ceremony called cabildo, and the first ploughing. At a practical level, the tradition of singing to the animals relates closely to weaving, and above all the production of fleece, so that learning to sing goes hand in hand with learning to weave. The songs as repositories of Andean knowledge relate the women of the place to their ecological setting, and to the songs of certain water birds thought to be the spirit-sirens of song and of the camelids. At a theoretical level, the book analyses the song texts as a bodily expression of female knowledge, quite different from Western writing. Here the singers pay attention to voice quality, inspiration and the unfolding of music and verse as vital elements of their woven world. Their taxonomy of the songs draws on the colours and fleece types they desire from the new generations of animals. And their song units and verse ‘formulae’ constitute an Andean grammatology of song."
