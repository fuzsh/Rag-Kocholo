The company announces it has entered into an agreement with Actualidad Media Group, LLC to purchase the assets of Class B daytimer WMYM-AM, Kendall, Florida and translator W254DT (98.7 FM) for an undisclosed sum. Salem Media Group executive chairman Edward Atsinger says, “Salem is beginning a new chapter in Miami as we expand our conservative and family themed programming to the Spanish-language audience.

Currently Salem owns Spanish-language radio stations in Dallas – KLTY-FM 94.9 HD2 and translator FM 102.5 (Spanish Christian Contemporary Christian Music); KTNO-AM 620 (Spanish Christian Teaching and Talk) in Portland; KRYP-FM 93.1 “El Rey” (Regional Mexican); and in Denver – KBJD AM 1650 (Spanish Christian Teaching and Talk).\n\nCumulus Makes if Official: Rich Valdés to Host Jim Bohannon Show.

Now, Cumulus Media makes it official and says Valdés will be the permanent host for the program that will continue to be called “The Jim Bohannon Show.” Valdés welcomed Levin as his first guest on the program last night (10/170. Levin comments, “Jim Bohannon is a legend. He’s also the #1 gentleman of talk radio. His absence from radio will be deeply felt. But there is no better person to assume that slot than my dear friend and colleague, Richie Valdés. Richie V, aka Mr. Call Screener, has been a fill-in host for me and is superb. He is compelling, entertaining, smart, and an unapologetic patriot. I could not be happier for him and, even more, the great radio audience.”\n\nRadio Hall of Fame Names WTOP’s Julia Ziegler ‘One to Watch.’ The Museum of Broadcast Communicationsannounces today that the Radio Hall of Fame names Julia Ziegler, director of news and programming for Hubbard Broadcasting’s all-news WTOP-FM, Washington as the recipient of its “One to Watch” award. The “One to Watch” award was created in 2018 in honor of radio legend and 2012 Radio Hall of Fame inductee Art Laboe, who passed away earlier this month at the age of 97. Each year, the nominating committee selects what it considers a promising radio personality or team who has demonstrated ratings success, audience growth, and impact on one or more radio stations and their communities. Ziegler began her career at WTOP in 2002 as an intern. From 2015 to 2019, she served as WTOP’s digital news director, where she oversaw the creation and development of WTOP’s digital news products, including WTOP.com, the WTOP app, social media, video, podcasts, smart speakers and more. She was part of the WTOP team that created and produced the award-winning true crime podcast, “22 Hours: An American Nightmare.” She rose to her current position in 2019. Nominating committee chair Dennis Green comments, “It is with great pride that we honor Julia Ziegler with this year’s ‘One to Watch’ award. Julia has literally done it all at a station that is one of the most highly respected in the nation. From interning at WTOP to working her way up to director of news and programming while setting the station’s path in digital and social media, this recognition is well deserved. On behalf of the Radio Hall of Fame nominating committee, congratulations, Julia, and continued success!”\n\nWayne Allyn Root Inducted into Nevada Broadcasters Hall of Fame.

Data from the third quarter of 2022, according to Comscore, FOX News Digital finished the period as the top-performing news organization in the competitive set in multiplatform minutes and views. FOX News Digital closed out the quarter delivering over 8.5 billion total multiplatform minutes, over 4.3 billion total multiplatform views, and averaged 80 million monthly multiplatform unique visitors…..NRG Media’s news/talk KXEL-AM, Cedar Rapids-Waterloo, Iowa reports that it is replacing “The Jim Bohannon Show” with two programs – an expansion of Starnes Media Group’s “The Todd Starnes Show” and Key Networks’ “No Spin News” with Bill O’Reilly. Station program director Jeff Stein says, “Our audience loves Todd Starnes’ common-sense conservativism and has asked us to find a way to carry the full program. There’s no better way to fill the shoes of a radio hall-of-famer than to provide more of a show that has already proven to be popular with Iowans. Adding ‘No Spin News’ is a logical move, based on the success of both the ‘O’Reilly Morning Update’ and ‘Bill O’Reilly Update’ we air each morning.”…..FOX Sports Radio’s LaVar Arrington – co-host of the network’s weekday morning program “Two Pros and a Cup of Joe” with Brady Quinnand Jonas Knox, and co-host of the nationally-syndicated weekend program/podcast “Up On Game” with TJ Houshmandzadeh and Plaxico Burress – announces today the addition of comedian and social media influencer Bubba Dub to the “Up On Game Presents” lineup with his new show, “Trashh Talk Podcast with Bubba Dub.”\n\nMidterm Elections, Russia-Ukraine War, The Economy, Trump Legal Issues, China Politics, Ye-Parler Deal, and British Politics Among Top News/Talk Stories Yesterday (10/17).

Longtime radio sales professional Kathy Carr, president of the Howie Carr Radio Network, writes today in an exclusive piece for TALKERS magazine that in radio’s halcyon days of the 1990s, a salesperson could make a good living filling agency avails. “Those were the days of sitting in front of that huge desktop computer and typing out a schedule in Tapscan to make the cost per point. But was that really sales or was it mere customer service?” Carr says real salespeople will always be able to find a job and reveals five questions she asks a prospective seller to determine if they are really a salesperson. Read it here.\n\nSalem Media Group To Boost Power. In a promotion that takes effect at the beginning of next year, Salem Media Group senior vice president Allen Power will be elevated to president/broadcast media. Chief executive officer David Santrella comments, “Allen Power and I have worked and collaborated closely for 18 of my 21 years with Salem. His keen operational experience, combined with his strong hand of leadership, provides a perfect combination to build a better future for the broadcast division.” Power notes, “My years with Salem have been the most rewarding of my career. Our dual focus on doing well – while doing good – provides a culture unique in media. I’m grateful for the leadership of our founders, Edward Atsinger and Stuart Epperson, and to Dave Santrella for the opportunity to play this role as our company continues to grow as a multimedia platform.” In other SMG news, senior vice president of operations Linnae Young is upped to executive vice president of operations & revenue development. “Linnae has been my go-to person every time we’ve had an opportunity to sell multiple marketing elements from several divisions to new clients,” Santrela states. “Her work in our industry on Salem’s behalf with many clients made this an easy decision for me.

The founder and chief executive officer of what is now iHeartRadio, Lowry Mays, died yesterday (Monday, 9/12) at the age of 87. Mays co-founded San Antonio Broadcasting Company with Red McCombs 50 years ago (1972). They purchased their first radio station, San Antonio’s KEEZ-FM; three years later (1975), they bought a second San Antonio outlet (currently iHeartMedia news/talk) WOAI. The company became Clear Channel Communications then iHeartRadio. Born in Harris County Texas on July 24, 1935, Mays graduated with a bachelor’s degree in petroleum engineering from Texas A&M University in 1957 and enlisted in the United States Air Force. Upon his discharge, Mays earned an MBA from Harvard University and became an investment banker. Mays continued his affiliation with Texas A&M by serving two non-consecutive terms (1985 -1991 and 2001- 2007) on the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents, including as chair from 2003 – 2005. In 2002, the school renamed its business school after Mays. Texas A&M University System chancellor John Sharp comments, “A really big tree fell in the Aggie forest. We will never forget what he did for Aggieland.” Texas A&M’s school of business was endowed by Mays in 1996 with a $15 million gift and was renamed the Lowry Mays College & Graduate School of Business. The university renamed the school once more in 2002 to Mays Business School. In 2017, the Mays Family Foundation gifted an additional $25 million, the largest single commitment in the business school’s history. Both gifts were part of an overall lifetime giving of $47 million. A 1999 Texas Business Hall of Fame inductee, Mays served as chair of the United Way of San Antonio and was a member of the associates board at Harvard Business School. In 2003, Mays testified before the Senate that the deregulation of the telecommunications industry had not hurt the public. In an interview that same year with Fortune Magazine, however, he remarked, “We’re not in the business of providing news and information. We’re not in the business of providing well-researched music. We’re simply in the business of selling our customers products.” Mays was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 2004, but suffered a stroke the following year. He stepped down as Clear Channel’s chief executive officer and was succeeded by his son, Mark.\n\nBloomberg Media Chief Mayers Is Retiring. Having joined the company in 2001 as Bloomberg Radio’s station manager, Bloomberg Media global head of radio and television Al Mayers is retiring from the company. Announcing the news in a staff memo, Bloomberg Media chief executive officer M. Scott Havens and Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait write, “Al has been a tireless leader at Bloomberg for over two decades, first in radio and now in his wider broadcast role. During COVID, it often seemed as if Al was single-handedly keeping us on the air. His retirement is a prompt for us to redesign the editorial side of Bloomberg Media – both in line with that philosophy and the broader changes in journalism and the media world. The lines between audio, video, print and live events have become ever harder to distinguish, especially as our audience decides when they want to watch, read or listen to our content. We need a unified approach not just to fit this world, but also to reflect the fact that Bloomberg Media is now an integrated global business, which surged almost 50% last year and has just realized another 24% increase in the first six months of 2022. So after Al leaves this month, David Merritt will become head of a new position, Bloomberg Media Editorial. [He] will oversee the editorial side of all of our media platforms – the website, all our audio and video, including BTV, radio, Quicktake, podcasts, events and our magazines. We are forever grateful for what Al has done for this company and wish him all the best in his next chapter on Cape Cod.” Mayers previously was general manager of Bloomberg Radio, overseeing the station’s programming, syndication and business operations. Michael Bloomberg named Mayers chief of Bloomberg’s global TV division in 2015.\n\nOmnipresent air talent/media executive Nick Cannon will host next month’s (10/19) Marconi Radio Awards dinner during the NAB Show in New York.

New Hampshire Public Radio president/chief executive officer Jim Schachter notes, “In Julia, we have a serious journalist in the ‘All Things Considered’ anchor chair. [She] connects with listeners across a broad, diverse spectrum; loves exploring New Hampshire; and understands that reporting the news is both a joy and a responsibility. Everyone at our studios knows she’s fun to be around, and now ‘ATC’ users can hear that.” Furukawa adds, “I came to NHPR [two years ago] thinking I’d mostly be behind the scenes, not behind the microphone. The team here has given me the chance to grow into a role I’ve always dreamt of being in; I couldn’t be more grateful and excited for what’s to come.” … Best known for her many reports from the front lines of world events, NPR international correspondent Anne Garrels has died at the age of 71. When Garrels arrived at NPR in 1988, she already had ten years of experience in television news at ABC, where she was bureau chief in both Moscow and Central America.

Pappademas says, “The shows and films and albums we explore have all been chosen not just because they’re massive pieces of popular culture. We’ve picked them because each has had a profound butterfly effect on our culture. Whether we’re tracing how an author’s vivid dream about a sparkly vampire led to an entirely new fan culture or how a megastar reckoning with success, expectation and survivor’s guilt crafted a masterpiece that became the soundtrack to the biggest protest movement in a generation, listeners will know from chapter to chapter they’re getting a high stakes narrative that explains how our culture has been influenced and shaped by these creations.”\n\nJanuary 6 Capitol Attack Anniversary, COVID-19, Midterm Elections, Border Crisis-Human Trafficking, and NYC DA’s Jail Policy Among Top News/Talk Stories Yesterday (1/5).
