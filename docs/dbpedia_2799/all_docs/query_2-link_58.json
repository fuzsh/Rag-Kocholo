        "text": "Tucson, AZ---The Century Room’s Artistic Director Arthur Vint has had a very busy summer. With his heavy booking, performing and teaching schedules (UA School of Music), he has also been traveling, always on the search for the best talent in the world. This year he also joined the board of the Tucson Jazz Music Foundation (TJMFdn) to further expand educational opportunities to youth interested in jazz under the Century Room Jazz Education Program. Besides offering discounted student tickets to concerts and performance opportunities at the weekly jam session, the program also raised funds to provide state of the art instruments to the Century Room for use by guest artists and local students. These include a new YAMAHA S5 6′ 7″ piano, a Viscount Soul 273 organ and an acoustic bass.\n\nAugust’s Century Room Signature Concert series kicks off with the Grammy Award winning Bill Charlap Trio, performing for two nights August 1st and 2nd. Other notable performers in August include a celebration of Louis Armstrong with James Williams and the Century Room Jazz Orchestra, the Chicago vocalist Alyssa Allgood, NYC pianist Armen Donelian, the Arthur Vint & Associates “Copper State” album release show and many other fantastic local musicians throughout the week.\n\nAdditionally, beginning in late August, the Century Room will feature the “Soul Jazz Lounge”, a new weekly series each Thursday at 9pm that will highlight the new organ and feature local artists including Jonathan Eldridge II, Chris Peña and Mark “Doc” Holladay. Holladay, who spearheaded the organ fundraiser, has also volunteered to conduct an free Organ Master Class and demonstration at The Century Room on Sunday, August 25, at 4:30pm.\n\nVint and the Century Room continue to receive national recognition, including a recent article in the renowned national jazz publication DownBeat Magazine and the Syncopated Times.\n\nFor additional information about TJMFdn, contact Krystyna Parafinczuk at treasurer@tjmfdn.org or visit www.TJMFdn.org.\n\nFor tickets and information on all shows at the Century Room visit www.centuryroomtucson.com\n\nAugust 1 & 2 | Bill Charlap Trio: And Then Again\n\n($30-$45 tickets | 7pm & 9pm shows) The Bill Charlap Trio returns to the Century Room for their third annual two-night residency! Together since 1997, the Bill Charlap Trio is the greatest and longest working piano trio in jazz today. They are celebrating the release of their stellar new album on Blue Note Records, “And Then Again”, recorded live at the Village Vanguard in New York City. Showcased throughout the album are the locked-in accord and extrasensory communication shared among these three musicians. The fleet yet diamond-sharp decision-making that happens bar after bar, tune after tune. The terra firma of the repertoire set against the improvised pluck of the arranging, and the many wonderful, unforgettable moments that ensue. “This record is about the communication of the trio — what we’re doing individually, and what we’re doing as a unit,” says Charlap. “And we try to do this in our own way, without really having to think too much about doing it in our own way. That should just happen naturally, and I think it does. You train the head, you trust the heart.”\n\nIn the discography of Charlap’s group — its own micro-canon of piano-trio language and repertoire — And Then Again hits as especially open and intrepid. The set also serves to document the current state in the trio’s continuing evolution, away from an outsize book of hundreds of tunes and charts, and toward a strategy where the setlist and the performances are as natural and intuitive as they can possibly be. The interplay, spontaneity and identity are the takeaway — even as Charlap very obviously adores these tunes and their composers and has lived this music. Come experience this trio live!\n\nBill Charlap (piano) Peter Washington (bass) Kenny Washington (drums)\n\nAugust 3 | Grown Folks Pt II\n\n($15-$25 | 7pm & 9pm Shows) PHX drummer TroyCov & PHX bassist Tha Mad Scientist join forces with local piano legend Chris Peña for an unforgettable night of music. Featuring musician AmGn, the group will be playing the music of Robert Glasper, Marcus Miller & a selection of original tunes. Expect a mix of jazz, R&B, hip and more from this super group. Their previous show at the Century Room was completely packed and off the hook, so be prepared for another memorable night of music!\n\nAmGn (keyboards & vocals) Chris Peña (keyboards) Tha Mad Scientist (bass) TroyCov (drums)\n\nAugust 9 | Andrew Walesch Tentet: I’ve Got You Under My Skin\n\n($25-$35 tickets | 7pm & 9pm shows) Like a good many before him, singer and pianist Andrew Walesch somehow manages to encapsulate the sophistication of a cosmopolite and the self-effacing charm of a country boy. Whether composing and arranging or appearing in settings ranging from solo artist to big band, this St. Cloud, Minnesota native, who crisscrosses the country playing dates big and small, is as respectful of his predecessors as he is ready to take a leap into the unknown and chart a new course.\n\nWith his 10-piece band, Walesch is a traditionalist and an iconoclast rolled into one. His audiences include jazz enthusiasts of a certain age, as well as a younger crowd compelled by his down-home insouciance, and the knowing irreverence of a tried-and-true American nightclub entertainer. “Although they are my idols, I don’t attempt to imitate the great pop and jazz artists of the 50’s and 60’s,” says the singer and pianist, “but I go for broke when we do our shows - vocally and musically - which is what they all did best and why they were in a class of their own.\"\n\nAndrew is currently the Artistic Director of the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, AZ.\n\nAndrew Walesch (vocals & piano) Jibrael Alsooz (trumpet) James Williams (trumpet) Eric Nakanishi (alto) Brice Winston (tenor) Joseph Rader (bari sax/flute) Max Goldschmid (trombone) Ed Delucia (guitar) Scott Black (bass) Arthur Vint (drums)\n\nAugust 10 | Alyssa Allgood Quartet: Songs Of Hope & Love\n\n($25-$35 tickets | 7pm & 9pm shows) Alyssa Allgood is an award-winning jazz vocalist, composer, arranger and educator with a compelling voice in the modern jazz landscape. Described as “assured and daring” by Downbeat Magazine and “a model of sophisticated song interpretation” by the Chicago Tribune, the Chicago-based artist boldly weaves soulful storytelling and rich improvisational language through original compositions, captivating arrangements and a lyrical focus of self-love and human connection.\n\nAllgood first made her name in such legendary Chicago clubs as the Green Mill and the Jazz Showcase, through residences at Winter’s Jazz Club — where she has delved into the songbooks of jazz’s classic divas (Ella Fitzgerald, Carmen McRae, Dinah Washington) — and at the internationally renowned Chicago Jazz Festival. Appearances followed in New York’s famed Birdland, Jazz at Lincoln Center Shanghai (China) and the Shadbolt Centre for the Arts (British Columbia). She was a semifinalist in the 2015 Shure Montreux Jazz Voice Competition, where jazz icon Al Jarreau led the jury, before winning the Inaugural Ella Fitzgerald Jazz Voice Competition (2017) and the David Baker Memorial Scholarship offered through the Jazz Education Network (2022). Closer to home, she was a 2016 Jazz Improvisation Fellow of the Luminarts Cultural Foundation in Chicago and was named Best Jazz Entertainer in the Chicago Music Awards (2019).\n\nAlyssa Allgood (vocals) Angelo Versace (piano) Scott Black (bass) Arthur Vint (drums)\n\nAugust 16 | Nick Manson: Reflections on Bill Evans\n\n($20-$30 tickets) A talented jazz pianist and keyboardist, the two-time Emmy Award winning multifaceted Nick Manson is also a composer, arranger and producer who has excelled in several fields. His piano playing is swinging, lyrical, consistently inventive, and quite individual. Throughout his career, Nick's performances are both accessible and creative, appealing to a wide audience yet remaining true to himself. A highly sought-after studio musician and producer, he has always maintained a dedication to jazz. He travels from Phoenix to perform the music of Bill Evans with his trio!\n\nBill Evans holds a timeless significance in the realm of jazz and his introspective improvisations and lyrical touch revolutionized the jazz landscape. Evans' harmonic sophistication and ability to weave intricate melodic place as one of the most influential pianists in music history.\n\nNick Manson (piano) Scott Black (bass) Arthur Vint (drums)\n\nAugust 17 | Jane Kaiser Quartet: From Brooklyn to Baja\n\n($10-$15 tickets | 7pm show) Album Preview Party! Long-time Tucson jazz pianist, educator, and composer Jane Kaiser brings her Chamber Jazz quartet performing her originals from their upcoming album “From Brooklyn to Baja”. Collective jazz grooves interlace swing, soul, and Latin rhythms with evocative melodies and harmonies to create an eclectic neo-classical vibe.\n\nJane is a jazz pianist and piano teacher based in Tucson, Arizona. She currently performs around town with her Jazz combos JAZZLAB and THE JANE KAISER TRIO. Her performance career is complemented by an active teaching studio, founded in 1988. Growing up in New York City, Jane studied Classical piano beginning at age five. She holds a B.A. in Piano Performance and Jazz Studies from the University of Iowa. She also holds Certification from the California and Colorado Suzuki Institutes in all levels of Suzuki Piano. She has performed with numerous jazz ensembles throughout the Midwest, including Bill Parson’s “Citizen’s Band”. She is also a founding member of the Matt Bevel Orchestra in Tucson, Arizona.\n\nRichard Sullivan (sax/flute) Jane Kaiser (piano) Adam Jones (bass) Chris Constantine (drums)\n\nAugust 17 | Susan Artemis Quartet: Too Darn Hot!\n\n($10-$15 tickets | 9pm show) Pianist Susan Artemis has become a mainstay of the Tucson jazz scene and has performed at the Century Room many times, both as a leader and a sideman. Her hit shows “Love Songs From The Dark Side of the Lounge” remain Century Room favorites. She brings her fabulous quartet back to the Century Room to perform a program of songs about surviving the summer in Tucson, including the Cole Porter classic, “Too Darn Hot!”\n\nEric Nakanishi (alto) Susan Artemis (piano) Evan Arredondo (bass) Casey Hadland (drums)\n\nAugust 23 | Armen Donelian Quintet: The Scattered Brotherhood\n\n($25-$35 tickets | 7pm & 9pm shows) Armen Donelian returns to the Century Room for another two-night engagement. Friday night highlights compositions from his albums “Secrets” and “The Wayfarer.” Donelian’s distinctive compositional style reflects his deep musical intelligence and adventurous spirit, and his compositions are characterized by intricate melodic motifs woven into rich harmonic frameworks, often drawing from a diverse palette of influences including jazz, classical, and world music. In quintet formations, Donelian's music thrives on allowing each member to contribute creatively while maintaining a cohesive ensemble sound.\n\nJason Carder (trumpet) Brice Winston (tenor) Armen Donelian (piano & compositions) Colin McIlrath (bass) Arthur Vint (drums)\n\nAugust 24 | Armen Donelian Trio: Detour Ahead\n\n($20-$30 tickets | 7pm & 9pm shows) Renowned pianist Armen Donelian embodies a synthesis of technical brilliance and profound musicality in his playing. His style is characterized by a seamless blend of intricate harmonic textures, fluid improvisational prowess, and a deep sensitivity to rhythm and dynamics. Within the trio format, he fosters a dynamic interplay with fellow musicians, emphasizing collective improvisation and intuitive dialogue.\n\nArmen Donelian (piano & arrangements) Scott Black (bass) Arthur Vint (drums)\n\nAugust 30 | Arthur Vint & Associates: Copper State\n\n($20-$30 tickets | 7pm & 9pm shows) Century Room Artistic Director (and house drummer) takes center stage to play music from his “lost” country/jazz album “Copper State.” Recorded in October of 2019 in New York City, this album has sat on the shelf for almost 5 years. The compositions from the album are ruminations on Arizona’s landscape and folklore, inspired from a trip to AZ after living in New York City for over a decade. With no plans to return to Arizona, the album was made as a love letter to his home state. The Covid-19 pandemic and moving back to Arizona caused the project to be shelved…until now!\n\nBrice Winston (saxophone) Nick Coventry (violin) Matt Mitchell (guitar) Chris Peña (organ) Angelo Versace (piano) Colin McIlrath (bass) Arthur Vint (drums)\n\nAugust 31 | Tucson Latin Jazz Nonet\n\n($20-$30 tickets | 7pm & 9pm shows) Vibraphonist Homero Ceron and pianist Amilicar Guevarra return to the to the Century Room with the Tucson Latin Jazz Nonet, a super group of Tucson's finest musicians playing high energy Mambo, Cha Cha and Boleros!
