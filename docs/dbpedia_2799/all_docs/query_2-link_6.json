        "text": "Spirituality should be established within the field of psychology at the core of the individual life and human process, so at the core of the therapeutic process. The relationship of psychology and religion has been established in the psychology of religion, and has been given some consideration in pastoral counseling, spiritual direction, and transpersonal psychology. This article describes the relationship of spirituality and religion within psychology. It establishes depth psychology as fundamental, in addition to personality psychology and in relation to it, to understanding the spiritual “inner landscape” of the person. Together these two subfields can best observe and assess the outer landscape of personality and the inner landscape of the psyche – of consciousness. The purpose of this article is to conceptualize and understand the psychological landscape of religion and spirituality as an axis connecting inner personal experience with manifestation of the personality in the outer world. This way we will insure that we have examined our research question or problem in the fullest context of psychospiritual experience of the person and the person in society. Key Words: consciousness, depth psychology, self-report, soul, spirituality, transpersonal psychology\n\nExploring the Landscape of Spiritual Geography is an attempt to review recent interest in environmental concern as a key spiritual value within religious education. Using geographical metaphors, the paper will briefly examine this theme on three interrelated levels: with regard to the contours of the curriculum (SCAA Model Syllabuses), the coordinates of inspection (Ofsted), and maps of tradition and implementation (sacred texts and school texts). The paper will then present, as a basis for further discussion and curriculum development, an open conclusion about the value of the landscape of spiritual geography to a child's sense of identity and to a child's sense of place.\n\nFrom where can we draw inspiration to cultivate an intimate sensibility into the spiritual nature of landscape, the foundation for designing gardens for meditation and healing? Through various spiritual lenses, this inquiry penetrates fundamental grounds for our subtle relationship with landscape. Beginning with excerpts of a private audience with His Holiness the Dalai Lama at Middlebury College, at which I present my proposed plans and designs for Milarepa Center in Barnet, Vermont, this inquiry looks into the profound links between spiritual inquiry and the practice of designing gardens, making design of landscape integral to a spiritual path, and the profound relationship between Landscape and Divinity. It is presented in three parts: (1) spiritual inspiration; (2) setting terms on the table; and (3) expressions of sacred landscape.\n\nThe widening spectrum of scientific and theological reflection has encompassed much of the natural sciences as was evi-denced in the August 2013 volume of Studia Historiae Eccle-siasticae that celebrated the work of Professor Cornel du Toit. But subjects like geomorphology are far removed from reflections on the human person and thus not a traditional point of departure for theological engagement. Nevertheless some key concepts in geomorphology such as the ideas of inter-connectedness, holism and scale perspectives have been tentatively explored by the author to locate human thought and actions towards and within the environment as an extension of the ethic to “love your neighbour”. Within this initial attempt of exploration were the seeds for a much greater and deeper exploration of geomorphic logic to theology, applying geomor¬phological concepts in the pursuit of theology and in the context of this article, to historical theology. The aim is to find traction between the two very different fields of geomor¬phology and theology\n\nThe first stage of becoming human beings as a species on Earth is a direct reference to the existence, the concrete forms of the surrounding reality, which become objects to this practice and also of consciousness. Once with the reporting human nature, the thought begins his own religious experience. At this level, man proposes between him and the world of nature another world, mediator, through which to act on its possibilities of existence. Religious thought in consciousness becames a reflection of reality and a projection of thought into reality. As a medium, it is an invention by not being in the objective existence, but with excellent exercise as mediator in ontological form, in that he always took refuge in a concrete object."
