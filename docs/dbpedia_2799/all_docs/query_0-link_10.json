The studio building was also pierced by stray shrapnel, which put a hole in the roof and damaged doors and windows. The studios are located close to the Ivory Coasts national radio and television network in Abidjan, the scene of intensified clashes in recent weeks. The radio station is operated by US mission group, SIM, in partnership with local churches and broadcasts Christian programs in numerous West African languages. SIMs Tim Welch said the station directors apartment had also been damaged by shrapnel and that the family was now staying in the recording studios. He added that the stations coverage had been weakened after the destruction of their 4,000-watt transmitter, which could only be replaced by a spare 300-watt transmitter.\n\nHCJB Globals Francoise Dossmann, who worked at the station for several years in Abidjan, said that around 100 people are sheltering in a nearby evangelical church.

This marks the third time that KLRC has been nominated for the award. The NAB has been honoring radio stations for their outstanding year-round commitment to community service since 1987.

Actually U.S. station FamilyRadio.com (lead by divisive personality Harold Camping) is the group responsible for the billboards. As most in the U.S. already know the 89-year-old author, broadcaster and former civil engineer first predicted the 'rapture' would come on September 4, 1994. Camping later revised his calculations to account for the new rapture prediction now promoted by Family Radio on their billboards in Brisbane and around the world. Rob Cowan, chief executive of 96.5 Family FM, said the views advertised on the posters were definitely not the views of his station. Cowan said he was taking steps to have the posters in Brisbane removed, including the one situated a stone's throw away from the station's Milton headquarters.

Don Hughes, Pres. / CEO of Great Plains Christian Radio (KJIL/Meade is the flagship station) is leading a Journey Through The Bible. Don developed a Bible reading schedule available in brochure form which will take participants through the scripture in 271 days. In developing the plan Don allowed for those involved to miss a few days and still maintain the schedule. He also brought similar passages in the Old and New Testaments together for reading on the same day. Also available is a blog which gives background, context and setting with each day's reading along with a devotional thought. The Journey Through the Bible is available at www.blogthruthebible.com. The unique idea has attracted not only people from the KJIL / KHYM listening area, but also from twelve countries. Outside of the United States the great participation has been from Japan.

One of our employees, Greg Lamb, has a young son who was a classmate of Christina Green, the little 9-year-old girl killed immediately at the scene. Since that tragic day, our Family Life Radio team has searched for ways to inform the nation, comfort the local community, and assist our neighborhood and our ministry staff. We have created an online Virtual Memorial shared via our website and other social media outlets.\n\nA special Thank You to Focus on the Family President, Jim Daly, Joni and Friends host, Joni Eareckson Tada, and Founder and President of Christian Emergency Network, Mary Marr, for assisting our Production department in creating an online Virtual Memorial.

After visiting the area Sunday morning, I was reminded that carnage results whenever evil seems to prevail. Of course, we know that ultimately God will prevail and all things will be set right. This reminds me of the fragility of life and the importance of living every day with passion and intentionality. I encourage you to be mindful of God's precious gift of faith, family and health, and return to Him our gratitude by remembering the families whose lives have been unquestionably changed forever. Our hearts and prayers go out to every person impacted by this unbelievable tragedy. We have much to be thankful for after observing the professional and caring response by those in law enforcement and medical services.
