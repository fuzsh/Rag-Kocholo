        "text": "American folk song\n\n\"The Wayfaring Stranger\"SongPublished1858 (earliest known)GenreAmerican folk music, GospelSongwriter(s)unknown\n\n\"The Wayfaring Stranger\" (also known as \"Poor Wayfaring Stranger\", \"I Am a Poor Wayfaring Stranger\", or \"Wayfaring Pilgrim\"), Roud 3339, is a well-known American folk and gospel song likely originating in the early 19th century[1] about a plaintive soul on the journey through life. As with most folk songs, many variations of the lyrics exist and many versions of this song have been published over time by popular singers, often being linked to times of hardship and notable experiences in the singers' lives, such as the case with Burl Ives' autobiography.[2]\n\nAccording to the book The Makers of the Sacred Harp, by David Warren Steel and Richard H. Hulan, the lyrics were published in 1858 in Joseph Bever's Christian Songster, which was a collection of popular hymns and spiritual songs of the time.[3]\n\nThe melody was composed by Johann Georg Ebeling and lyrics written by Paul Gerhardt in 1666 in Germany as \"Ich bin ein Gast auf Erden\" (I am a guest on earth). The song is based on Psalm 39:12 and Psalm 119:19 [4][5] Both lyrics and melody are close to the modern English version.[6]\n\nDuring and for several years after the American Civil War, the lyrics were known as the Libby Prison Hymn.[7] This was because the words had been inscribed by a dying Union soldier incarcerated in Libby Prison, a warehouse converted to a notorious Confederate prison in Richmond, Virginia known for its adverse conditions and high death rate. It had been believed that the dying soldier had authored the song to comfort a disabled soldier, but this was not the case since it had been published several years before the Civil War in 1858, before Libby Prison was put into service (1862).[8]\n\nMembers of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.[9]\n\nNotable versions\n\n[edit]\n\nIt became one of Burl Ives' signature songs, included on his 1944 album The Wayfaring Stranger. Ives used it as the title of his early 1940s CBS radio show and his 1948 autobiography.[2]\n\nPaul Robeson performed this song in his acclaimed 1945 and 1947 New York concerts. The son of a slave, Robeson performed the selection in a style reminiscent of the \"Negro spirituals\" of the 19th Century. The recording is featured with many other spirituals in the \"Power and the Glory\" collection.[10]\n\nJo Stafford features the song on her influential 1950 album American Folk Songs.\n\nEmmylou Harris covered the song on her 1980 album Roses in the Snow. Harris' version peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart.[11] It reached number 1 on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada.[12]\n\nAnother popular version of the song was released by Johnny Cash in 2000 as part of his album American III: Solitary Man.[13][14]\n\nJack White performed the song as his character Georgia in the 2003 film Cold Mountain and the song was included on the film's soundtrack.[15]\n\nNatalie Merchant recorded a version on her 2003 album The House Carpenter's Daughter.\n\nThe song is featured in the 2012 Belgian film The Broken Circle Breakdown.\n\nIn 2015, the Norwegian bluegrass ensemble, Hayde Bluegrass Orchestra, inspired by the music of the film The Broken Circle Breakdown, released a cover of the song on Youtube which garnered over five million views.[16][17] A video on Youtube of Hayde Bluegrass Orchestra performing The Wayfaring Stranger during their later 2018 live performance at John Dee would be viewed an additional 1.8 million times.[18]\n\nThe song, referred to as \"I Am a Poor Wayfaring Stranger\", was featured in the 2019 World War I drama 1917.[19] It was performed by actor and singer Jos Slovick. In February 2020, a Change.org petition collected over 2,500 signatures to urge film producers, Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures to release a full studio version of Slovick's performance.[20] The studio version was published in March 2020.\n\nFor the soundtrack of the 2020 video game The Last of Us Part II, actors Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, as their characters Ellie and Joel, performed the song over the end credits with additional lyrics.[2]\n\nBluegrass family band, The Petersens, released a live performance recording of The Wayfaring Stranger in November 2021, garnering over 1.2 million views on Youtube, and included the song on their album, Live Sessions, Vol. 4.[21]\n\nThe Longest Johns in 2022 released a cover of the song as a part of their Smoke & Oakum album, and released an alternate recording version for their Made of Ale live sessions.\n\nThe Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square recorded this song as part of their album Peace Like a River in an arrangement written by Mack Wilberg.\n\nPoor Man's Poison recorded this song as part of their album Providence.\n\nThe Platinum Tears in 2023 recorded a version for the soundtrack to the Documentary The Murals by TG Jamroz\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn F.
