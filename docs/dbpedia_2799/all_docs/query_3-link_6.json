        "text": "When I was in high school, I was a lonely child who made friends online. I had this pen pal who claimed to be from England, a city by the sea called Chichester to be exact. One day, he took a pilgrimage to London. While he was there, he went to a concert, and subsequently sent me footage from said concert. The attached message looked exactly like this: “Hi April. I hope you are doing well. I went to a concert in London today. I saw this person named Ed Sheeran. He played guitar and was really good!” The young musician I was, I checked out the extremely poor and broken footage. While all I could actually see was ginger hair and a Picassoan outline of a guitar, I heard a beautiful voice that forever captured my soul.\n\nI tracked Ed’s performances and rise on the BBC top charts. I was overjoyed when he released his first album “+” (pronounced “plus”) during my college years. His song “A Team” was the track that allowed him to penetrate the American market. Right after I graduated and was lost in the abyss of being adult, he brought me some comfort with his sophomore album, “x” (pronounced “multiply”). This secured his brand of pop star with millions across the globe.\n\nSo, after six years, moving from fan to mega fan, I finally was offered the opportunity to see him in concert. While he provided an excellent display of talent, the concert experience itself brought me from mega fan back down to casual listener.\n\nThe concert was at Frisco’s Toyota Stadium, home to FC Dallas. The stadium seats were completely sold out, and the standing room on the field itself was also packed. Having an optimal view from the stage and the experience to back it up, he claimed that this was his biggest North American show to date. Ed was a darn near flawless performer. Even though he had been doing this same tour for over a year now, his energy seemed no different from opening night. You can tell that performing is in his soul. He was very charismatic with the audience, explaining how he uses his loop pedal to create harmonies with himself and live music. He donned a cowboy hat to symbolize how much he “loves Texas”. He showed support for his opening act, Jar of Hearts singer Christina Perry. His fingers flew effortlessly across his various guitars. He sounded exactly like his album, even the subtle vocal inflections that made me fall in love with his voice were the same. He only went out of tune once, and it was so slight that even after being blasted across the stadium’s magnificently clear sound system, only someone looking for a mess up could tell. All in all, he was a well oiled industry machine, which is great, except for the fact that I’m over it.\n\nI arrived late (purposefully?) so I unfortunately missed Ed’s opening opening act, Jamie Lawson. So, Let us start with one of Ed’s self proclaimed “besties” and industry buddy, Christina Perri. Perri is a stunningly beautiful girl who in my opinion would be better utilized in the Christian Rock genre. She uses her music as a platform for various issues including loneliness and heart break. When combined with her high pitched speaking voice, energy, and major keyed songs, I believe Christian audiences would be more receptive of her musical vision. Even while backed by an amazing live band, her performance was very stripped (some would call it basic). Her piano playing was purely for performance reasonings, she wore a modest back and white ensemble. She too was a flawless performer, but even with a top half full of tattoos, she was still lacking edge. The “Pop Star” aspect of her performance was missing.\n\nThis was also my main issue with Ed. Originally, I praised Ed for being a self made pop star. He dropped out of school to move to a foreign city and pave a way for himself. He now packs out stadiums, but his shows are essentially the same thing I saw on the broken home video back in 2009. According to a bit of snooping on his official Instagram, the same unoriginal plaid shirt he wore during the Frisco performance was the one he had worn the day before. When he walked out on stage, he looked so normal and ordinary. It was like I was watching a friend at an open mic night, except I paid $90 for it. When I was in my super fan stage, I watched recordings of his previous concerts. He said the exact same things and told the exact same stories at other concerts, just like he was following a script.\n\nThe concert was pretty much a giant sing a long. I knew every word to every song. That being, I found it funny how when Ed played something from his older album, I was basically in a duet with Ed. All the underaged girls in short shorts were impressed with how good I sounded.\n\nAs I morph into my adult self, I am learning more about what I crave in a musical experience. I want originality. I want to feel special. I am paying to have a connection with the artist, to share a moment with the people surrounding me. A moment that not only will never be duplicated, but can never be duplicated. I want passion and mistakes. I want raw, bespoke, original. Maybe at some times Ed is that, but not during this performance. This was a “how many deranged fans can we make money off of at one time” situation. I got suckered in by the machine.\n\nI am looking forward to what Ed does next. I’m still a fan and think he has a truly beautiful talent. I will still support his music and his next album. I just hope it is more unique, because I don’t think he can get away with the same act he’s been doing for the past few years. Hopefully he’s taking notes from his other bestie Taylor Swift and will attempt to reimagine his sound and his image. Or maybe he will follow the formula and continue enjoying where I originally thought I would be when I turned 24 years old.\n\nIn the past 5 years, EDM (Electronic Dance Music) has experienced a rise of prominence in America’s pop music culture. It is easy to make, easy to distribute, and characterized by technology, is a staple of the Millennial generation. The coproducer of MTV’s Catfish did a great job artfully explaining the EDM scene in his movie “We Are Your Friends”, but failed to create anything other than your run of the mill underdog story.\n\nCole is a 20 something who grew up in California’s San Fernando Valley. He is a DJ and has an adorably bro-tastic squad that promotes him at clubs around Los Angeles. During a chance encounter, an older DJ takes him under his wing. He opens up musical opportunities for him, teaches him how to have music with a soul, and how to fine tune his sound.\n\nAs far as story goes, the film is bland, but truthful. It is a classic rise and fall scenario that Millennial movies tend to gravitate to, i.e. the, ” I refuse to be unhappy at a 9-5 just to pay bills and die” mantra that we all emit. It also incorporated the “Your music needs soul in order to be real” ideal that most musical biopics naturally revolve around. However, I can relate to almost every part of Cole’s journey as an artist. I remember meeting my former boss at a party and getting into a car with an otherwise complete stranger to be whisked away to a drug filled high society fling. I remember the exact piano lesson, after 12 years of taking them, where I figured out how to put all of my emotional energy into my playing. I remember getting random text messages to come over to my bosses house for platonic bonding when he felt lonely and slowly building that awkward relationship. I think the movie beautifully captured those experiences. While a mainstream movie, it had its indie moments -think hipster-sunsets on California beaches, wide-angle shots of people staring contemplatively of the horizon, etc.- that added to the overall feel of the movie.\n\nI am giving the soundtrack an A-. If it was not a movie about music, then it would be an A+. The chosen music makes for an excellent Spotify playlist, but I attribute the lower rating to three things. The first is that the style of EDM music displayed in the movie was very limited. The director clearly has a musical style preference and for a film that attempted to educate the masses about EDM, it failed to diversify. My second issue with the music was that they incorrectly referred to a specific type of dance music as “hardcore”, when the proper term is “hardstyle”, but that was just a minor annoyance. The last issues was that the climax song of the film was…less than climactic. It was predictable, not exciting, and it showed too much of how it was conceived instead of it being any kind of surprise.\n\nOverall, We Are Your Friends seemed as if it was missing several scenes. I enjoyed the bromantic relationship of the main character’s best friends. They all responded differently to the issues surrounding a 24/7 partying lifestyle and the direction that their individual lives would take, but I wanted to see that expanded upon. I enjoyed Zac Effron’s beautiful face and emotional performance, but the story’s inevitable happy ending made me less sensitive to the trials of the main characters. As a fan of the EDM scene, I expected more of a historical account, but I think it is an accurate first look for anyone wanting to see what this generation is up to.\n\nI followed the crowd of people under the overpass in Downtown Dallas and joined them as they gathered around the stage. So much sweat rolled down my cheeks that it felt as if I was taking a steamy shower. It was 100 degrees and clearly there was no point in wearing any makeup, even if I did have my on best sweat protective measures. I got there a little bit late, so the fourth guest on the lineup, I Love Makonnen was just jumping on stage. He turned the crowd into a moshpit with his hip-hop and edm infused hits such as “Tuesday”, “Don’t Sell Molly No More”, and “Look at Wrist”. He was the artist I was least looking forward to but proved to be a nice break from the bass driving DJs.\n\nDallas is not a premier EDM destination so I am more than over joyed that for eight years running, EDM mega artist Diplo has brought several mainstream EDM artist to our humble town. However, Dallas seems like the kid that really wants to be a part of the cool crowd, but just doesn’t know how to fit in when he is invited. The festival was definitely more reminiscent of a “Block Party” than a true “Rave”, (even in the 21st century definition of the word). There were only a handful of fancy rave costumes, most people were in shorts and tee shirts, or dresses and cowboy boots, the usual for a Texas outdoor event. That didn’t bother me as much as the fact that nobody was dancing. There was no shuffling, there was no jumping up and down, the closest thing to anybody looking like they were having a good time was the mosh pits that kept forming, and all the pushing, shoving, and general rambunctiousness took away points for me. The rave cultures mantra of PLUR (Peace Love Unity and Respect) was non existent throughout the crowds, restroom lines, food lines, security, and pretty much the entire festival.\n\nThe DJs that we saw played very interesting sets. The type of artists that gathered for the event were more of the hardcore artists. In the EDM community, it was definitely what one would call a “Trap Fest”. They didn’t play the normal festival sets. Instead of hits from the EDM community, they mixed in more hits from the top 40 hip hop charts and from other artists that were performing. “Dirty Vibe” a 2014 single from Skrillex’s latest album “Recess” was a hit that all the artists mixed into their sets at some point. Usually I can tell what song is coming up next by how the DJ mixes, but the stage was so loud that any differentiation from the bass going BOOM BOOM BOOM was hard to find. I’ve been to plenty of concerts, EDM and otherwise, but this was the only time I ever felt like my ear drums were going to burst. It was painful, and I now know to always take ear plugs.\n\nI’m torn over whether or not I enjoyed myself at this event. I liked the idea of it. I liked that big named artists (Jauz, Party Favor, TJR, Borgore) were playing in the back yard of the Green Monster and Perot Museum. But I disliked its simplicity, the crowds, the sound system, and the lack of advertising. I think Dallas just needs to host a few more parties in order to better understand how to act during different types of concerts and events.\n\nI decided to try one of the current hair trends, dying your hair a vivid, non natural color. It was always a staple in Nicki Minaj’s look, Kylie Jenner sent the media into a frenzy with her blue hue, and it seemed as if Katy Perry’s hair changes color every other day. I was headed to my first music festival in a few weeks and decided that maybe I should try it too.\n\nWhile I saw a lot of grey, blues, greens, and pinks, purple was a bit of a more subtle option that I decided to go with. Purple is considered a “royal” color, yet it also had the opportunity to go incredibly ratchet, so I had to be careful with how I did this. With no beautician experience whatsoever, I skimmed through YouTube for days trying to figure out how to do this, and, how to do so on a budget. I gathered my supplies; bleach, whitening cream, a tube of illegally attained professional level color, toner, gloves, and a high level of hope, to get started adulterating the Brazilian weave hair I purchased days before.\n\nMy sisters and I attempted to make a YouTube tutorial video on how to dye hair in order to share our experience with others, but that went totally wrong. We didn’t apply the bleach quick enough, so half of the hair was still brown while the other half was ice blonde. We got toner all over the bathtub. (We bleached out the tub back to white, but purple streaks are permanently running down the sides) And the worst part, we stuck the aluminum foil out in the sun and it caught on fire. Mixing heat with the bleaching powder, the chemical reaction actually made the hair burn. It was the biggest fail of a hair tutorial. It took us all day just to dye the hair. Then, my sister attempted her first sew in ever and it took another two days, and plenty of pain, to have the hair put in my head.\n\nThe best part however, was that even after all the mishaps, the hair looked absolutely wonderful! Because we didn’t bleach the hair evenly, it was darker in some spots. This actually gave the hair depth instead of it being a solid color. My sister did a great job on her first sew in. It survived a week in Vegas without falling out. The color paired well with my green eyes, making them stand out even more. But what I thought was the coolest part, was that every time I looked at my hair, it was a different color. Depending on if I was inside or outside, if it was day or night, or how the light caught my hair, it looked different, from various shades of purple, to sometimes even blue. Walking around and talking to my sisters, I was feelin’ myself. I was looking’ good and for once I couldn’t convince myself otherwise. However, everything changed when I actually stepped outside.\n\nMy mom stared at me and said, “Oh, so you actually did it.” “What’s that supposed to mean mom?” “I don’t know…don’t you think you look foolish?” Stepping out side of the door to my apartment, I was met with all kinds of stares from the neighbors, the facility workers, to the post man. I was convinced even the dogs were tuned into my direction. I am usually used to being stared at. I am a black kid in a white community who rocks her fro and loves her Timbs. But this time it was different. I wasn’t a part of a community, I couldn’t be put in a box. I was just me. Even if I was used to it, having that many people turn heads at you and give you disapproving looks still wears down on you. You instantly begin to fix yourself, checking for boogers, making sure your shirt is tucked in correctly, but in this instance, there was nothing I could do. Especially being outside, the hair was at its most purple. I had purple hair in my head and it wasn’t coming out any time soon.\n\nThings got worse when I got to work. I had been shopping around the idea that I was going to dye my hair purple. While a couple of friends really liked it (THANK YOU), many just continued to stare with disapproving looks saying, “Oh, you changed your hair”. One of my coworkers told me that their nine year old daughter was about to do the same thing with her hair but she didn’t really like the idea. (Because above the fact that you just disapproved of my life style choice, at 24, being compared to a nine year old was something I really needed to hear.)\n\nWhat was really amazing to me was that everyone felt the need to comment on my hair. And more likely than not, it was a negative comment. (Or if it was positive, it was a back handed compliment. For example, “Your hair looks really nice like that! I would never go out in public like that.” ) I got a lot of “Why did you do that?” and a lot of blatant, “That was a stupid idea” from TOTAL strangers. White people touched my hair without permission. Black people looked down on me like I was some sort of degenerate. One of my managers pulled me aside and told me that while it was within the rules, the purple hair may affect my promotion. Everyone tried to put their own perceptions of who I was on to me. “You look like an anime character” “You look like a warrior princess” “You look like a white girl”. Was I not allowed to just look like April?\n\nWhen I got home after spending all day internally processing the remarks a simple change of hair had garnered, I took a look at myself in the mirror. And guess what? I still looked off the chain. Nothing ANYONE said to me, good or bad, made me feel any different about my appearance than I felt when I woke up this morning. To for once not be swayed by public opinion was one of the most freeing things I have ever felt in my life. I remember hearing the same comments on my hair when I first started going natural. (natural: letting go to the chemical relaxers to make my hair lay straight and embracing my nappiness because screw western societal norms) But with my natural looks, it was different. I didn’t, and still six years later, don’t feel pretty about my hair. The natural look was not something I felt comfortable in. I did it because other people told me to, because I have “good hair” and “didn’t need a perm”. But it just wasn’t me. What I found out was that in this moment, purple hair was me. I assimilated the team and put in the effort to create this look. Purple hair was everything I wanted to be. Purple hair made me smile and no one else could diminish it.\n\nYes, my hair is purple. And yes, it looks really good.\n\nDown the Rabbit Hole is the tell all autobiographical account of Holly Madison’s life-before, during, and after living in the Playboy Mansion. This memoir debuted to much acclaim and reached the top of the New York Times best seller list. Holly was a small town (yet upper middle class) girl from Alaska who grew up studying Marilyn Monroe and dreamed of becoming a star. At age 20, Holly maxed out her credit cards on a boob job and transferred from Portland State University to Loyola Marymount University in order to begin chasing the fabulous LA life she’d always dreamed of. I really enjoyed how the book brilliantly utilized quotes from Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland to guide the chapters and to sum up how she was feeling, but depression or not, I couldn’t help but to think, “Sigh, White Privilege”.\n\nI originally picked up the book because of the pivotal point of which I currently stand in my life. Critics call it the “Quarter Life Crisis”. I graduated from a top-notch higher educational institution over two years ago, but haven’t been able to find anything above a minimum wage job, let alone follow my dreams of working in the entertainment industry. I knew Holly Madison from both her show on E! “Girls Next Door” and as the stunning wife of the Electric Daisy Carnival’s curator Pasquale Rotella. I wanted to investigate how Holly made the transitions in her life and see if any of those lessons could apply to myself. While Playboy magazines were never in my household, I remember watching Girls Next Door and trying to imagine what it would be like to be more mature, more beautiful, and more white.\n\nUltimately, the book didn’t help me with any of those conundrums. While I did get older, I never did lose any of what I thought was “baby weight”. I’m beautiful, but not in an American standard of beauty sense. More of a, I know how to take care of myself and know where I stand as a person sense. And now, I scoff at the fact that I ever wanted to be more white, or anything less or more than what God blessed me with. Carrying no answers I thought it would provide-this book simply made me angry.\n\nOn one hand, I truly felt sorry for Holly. She dreamed of this Hollywood Stardom life, but instead was met with curfews, long productive-less hours, and being physically and emotionally toyed with for the pleasure of a sadistic old man who (as she tells it) thrived on catfights and loathed for public adoration. As someone living with depression myself, I take it very seriously when someone mentions any thoughts of suicide. You feel trapped, you feel hopeless, you feel your life is not worth living. And regardless of how you got there, being with those thoughts is a dark place to be.\n\nOn the other hand, mansion life was a piece of cake. According to the memoir, playmates could request any food any time they wanted, got to constantly be in the media, and were able to learn all about the entertainment industry. They had the grand Charing Cross address as a magnificent covering over their heads, did not have to worry about their debts being paid, and were set up for easily finding a well-to-do husband after their stint at the Mansion was complete. I view the openness and “world as your oyster” feeling after leaving college as a negative and I would have loved to have my basic needs catered to while figuring out my life instead of working as hard as I do now and taking two steps backwards just to eat every night.\n\nThe book was (albeit surprisingly) well written. It was indeed a page turner and I enjoyed learning about the (depressing) life of the privileged upper class. However, it was very out of touch with my current position in society. Many of my people won’t even make it to Holly’s starting point. It really went to show me that everyone is on their own track, have their own issues, and respond to those issues in different ways. Many times it is hard to judge somebody else problems and the specific severity it casts on them. I think Holly showed strength and courage during this portion of her life and I wish her well with her new family. While I know my success will not come as easily, I am happy for the happiness she found. The book gave me the courage to not give up and to create my own story, because only God knows what will happen in our futures.\n\nEDC, or the Electric Daisy Carnival, is currently the biggest North American music festival. EDC, brought to us by LA-based Insomniac Events hosts several smaller festivals across the globe, including New York, Orlando, England, and recently added, an EDC Brazil. However, The Electric Daisy Carnival in Vegas is the massive fest that features the biggest artists in electronic dance music from dusk till dawn for three nights straight. My friends and I attended our first EDC this year, and these were the highlights and lowlights that stood out during the best experience we’ll have all year.\n\nBEST: DJ Snake’s getting us down and dirty at Kinetic Field. French artist DJ Snake took us through all of his hits while mixing in some pretty serious bass drops at the biggest EDC stage. I danced so hard, people asked me if I was rolling. (My response, on caffeine pills, maybe). My favorite of his set was when he dropped the music to a low volume and took the time to make sure the entire audience was bent down low to the ground. Then, he blasted Dillon Francis’ summer takeover song “Get Low” and the crowd went wild, (and followed suit when he told everyone to scream out ‘screw Dillon Francis’.)\n\nWORST: Calvin Harris/Calvin Harris’ fans. Calvin Harris played Kinetic Field early Sunday night. Most of the crowd at this set consisted of “poser ravers”. My friends and I are new to the rave scene, but we did some research and understood the culture’s mantra of PLUR (Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect), unlike the poser ravers who heard Calvin Harris on the radio and blindly followed him to EDC. They pushed and shoved, hit people on the head with their flailing arms filled with reckless abandon, and couldn’t decide if they wanted to stay at the set for the whole time or not, moving in 2o people -long lines in front and behind me for the entire set. Now, I want to believe in Mr. Harris. He holds the record for more top 40 hits at one time than Michael Jackson, and Michael was The King, so that’s a miraculous achievement. I admit, I bought the Motion album, and it’s on repeat in my car (after Ed Sheeran of course), but when I flew halfway across the country, bused through the desert, and bee-lined to his set at 11:11pm, I expected to hear more than just replays of his albums. I wanted to hear some remixes, some new drops, some wild fist pumps, something more than what I get when driving to work. Maybe he was having an off day, or maybe he is just a stoic performer, but between him and his fans, I was slightly disappointed with this set.\n\nBEST: Valentino Kahn’s song “Deep Down Low”. This song was the overwhelming winner of this year. The DJ’s loved to play it, and the crowd loved to hear it.\n\nWORST: Little bits of Drake’s latest album dropped in almost every set. It was almost as if Drake had paid each DJ to mix his songs into their sets, but the DJ’s didn’t actually want to play them. The would play 5-10 seconds of each song, and as soon as I was ready to shout “I was runnin’ through the 6 with my woes”, the song stopped and real woes were beginning to form. Sorry Drake, there was none of your “Energy” repped at EDC.\n\nBEST: DJ Carnage’s Hardstyle set. We saw him play his second set of EDC at the Wasteland stage. Carnage readily informed us of who he was and the fact that he does “whatever the *heck*” he wants to. So while I thought I was getting myself into some serious trap music, I instead got a brilliant introduction into hardstyle music. At this set, I danced so hard I threw up in my mouth, but then swallow sit and kept that Melbourne shuffle going.\n\nWORST: Too many white DJ’s who weren’t quite pulling off the Funk House stage. While DJ Jazzy Jeff shut down and over-capactiated the 360 Funk House stage on night one, some of the night two and three performers weren’t quite up to snuff. The few artists I saw played the same “soul” songs that were edited through with terrible mixing. It’s ok. It’s not their fault that even though African Americans started EDM, that they are now terribly underrepresented in the industry. (cough cough, hint hint)\n\nBEST: Martin Garrix’s pop up set at the 7 up Discovery Stage. The discovery stage was a showcase for up and coming EDM artists. While standing in line for a ride (and trading kandi, yay), the discovery stage was blasting and had pulled me into intrigue. After the ride, we rushed over and had a great time jumping and getting hit in the head with beach balls. I had originally decided not to see Garrix’s set because I thought it may be a disappointing and over commercialized hour, but his pop up set turned out the be my second favorite performance of the weekend. (Plus, he was a super cutie!)\n\nWORST: Not discovering the Discovery Stage sooner. Upon listening to the soundclouds of some of the performing artists when I got home, I realized that there was a lot of talent being pumped through that stage. There was so much music performed at EDC, I wish it was a week long event so I could take it all in.\n\nBEST: Street tacos inside the speedway. Yum.\n\nWORST: Not having all the food available that was advertised. While I was satisfied with my tacos, I was pretty upset that the chicken tender tent didn’t actually have any chicken tenders.\n\nBEST: The Bass Pod stage. Being surrounded by several larger than life pods that shot fire and were decorated with LED screens and lasers was the coolest thing ever. The weirdest part was how all the neon colored, tutu toting, kandi kids fled far from the Bass Pod stage (probably to see Calvin Harris). Instead, the serious black clad, hood pulled up, masked rave angels body thrusted to the bass. I saw Brillz and Excision at the Bass Pod stage and felt all their bass pumping through my chest. It was like having a two hour long panic attack, but in the best way imaginable.\n\nWORST: Bass Pod being too awesome for itself. Bass Pod was actually defunct for about an hour because the bass was too much for it’s sound system. What a sad hour it was.\n\nBEST: Staying on the Vegas Strip. We stayed at the Luxor hotel on the strip. Because of this, we were able to do Vegas activities during the day. We rode the Big Apple Coaster that winds through the New York, New York hotel, had brunch at Caesar’s Bacchanal Buffet, and partied it up at the Marquee Day Club in the Cosmopolitan.\n\nWORST: Staying on the Vegas Strip. As awesome as our day activities were, we missed a lot of EDC trying to sneak in naps before the big event. Staying closer to the speedway might have been a better idea. Also, even though we had shuttle passes, the trip to the speedway was still an hour plus drive. Waiting in line for the shuttles seriously cut down on our fun time. One of our shuttles didn’t have air conditioning, and at 113 degrees, that is a serious offense.\n\nBEST: Porter Robinson’s Residency at the Cosmopolitan. Porter is probably the best weeaboo I have ever met. At the Marquee DayClub Pool Party, he went over time and played a three hour long set. He expertly mixed his “Worlds” album with top 40 EDM hits, a little Daft Punk, and a lot of dirty, grimy bass drops that had me bouncing up and down for the entire thing. Not only was his music on point, the crowd of bros were super friendly, and Porter was nice, blotto, and happily available to meet his fans after.\n\nWORST: DJ Carnage doing a surprise set after Porter Robinson at the Cosmopolitan. How dare DJ Carnage keep the party going? He knew it was 6 o’ clock and we all had EDC day 3 to get to. And he knew that we would all stay to listen to him turn that pool from a party to a true club as the sun set. But it’s ok, I still “Like Tuh”.\n\nCOULDN’T DECIDE IF IT WAS AWESOME OR TERRIFYING: Cutting through a military base in the middle of the Mojave Desert. It was the creepiest thing ever to wind slowly through the night with only a single white light to guide our shuttle bus. Not to mention the signs that read “Beware, explosive material in the ground; DO NOT DIG”. However, it cut the travel time in half because we got to avoid the traffic, hence getting us to the music faster!\n\nCOULDN’T DECIDE IF IT WAS AWESOME OR TERRIFYING: Flosstradamus. There was SO MUCH going on in this trap set. His hype man was bouncing everywhere, he changed the song every five seconds, and the screen of LEDS flashed at 1/250th of a second for the entire performance. I don’t know how everyone in his crowd managed to sneak in blunts after the invasive pat down we received at the entry, but there was definitely a cloud of smoke above his stage. I think I enjoyed it, but I was so confused, and couldn’t stop twerking.\n\nCOULDN’T DECIDE IF IT WAS AWESOME OR TERRIFYING: Watching Dillon Francis’ surprise sun rise set. Except, it wasn’t too much of a surprise because he announced he would be playing a week prior on his twitter. We sat at the top of the bleachers of the speedway listening to “Not Butter” and taking in all that EDC had to offer one last time. We were tired, we were dirty, but we wanted to stay. The Kinetic Field owl closed it eyes as the mass EDC 2015 exodus took place. I was grateful for the opportunity, and was ready to go home, but at the same time wanted to live out there under the electric sky forever.\n\nEd Sheeran is probably my favorite artist right now. He built his career the old fashioned way-leaving home at a young age and couch surfing from gig to gig until someone that mattered realized how awesome he was. Must have been the life. Everything about him is organic. His trademark ginger locks, his love for chicken, his spotless publicity record, and his panty attracting vocals. In a world where people my age no long purchase CD’s, I bought “X” (pronounced multiply), played it to death, and then bought it again, all while sending his Spotify hits soaring when I wasn’t in the presence of a cd player. Apparently I wasn’t the only one. “X” was the most streamed album on Spotify in 2014 and his album hit the top several top positions on the billboard charts in several countries around the world. I’m not kidding-it’s that good. And track by track, I’m going to tell you why.\n\n1. A quiet guitar riff followed by a breath that stabilizes mental energy begins the album. That all important breath and release is too well known to a performer. We have to do it in order to get in the “musical zone” before starting a performance. When I first popped the cd into my car, Sheeran’s recorded instance of this got me into the zone of listening to his music. So much so, that I played this first song over and over (and over), not moving to the second track until three weeks later. You have to understand, Ed Sheeran’s music is comprised of three parts. One part rhythm, one part vocal bliss, and one part story telling. “One” exemplifies his skills in story telling. It is a beautiful take-me-back love request wrapped up in soft guitar finger picking and subtly sexy breathy vocals. “Take my hand and my heart and soul, I will only have these eyes for you.” (If a man told me that in real life, I would personally see to it that he is the happiest man in the world for the rest of his life). It is a slow tempoed ballad that in true Ed Sheeran fashion, discusses his moments of relationship clarity after a period of heavy drinking. It may be sappy, but the constant, driving bass and melodic flow of this song makes it worth it. And if you don’t want to take him up on the offer, Ed will wait- “Just promise me you’ll always be a friend-because you are the only one.”\n\n2. So apparently the lady Sheeran was proposing to in track 1 did not take him back. So naturally the second track, “I’m A Mess” tells his difficulties in dealing his disappointment- “See the flames inside my eyes-it burns so bright I want to feel your love.” This track starts out with rhythmic dotted quarter note strums and immediate vocal entry. A quiet reverb from post production adds to the dynamic nature of his sweet, but firm voice. In the chorus you can hear a little bit of soul beginning to come from Sheeran. It get’s more intense as his voice crackles and jumps an octave within a single line. His runs sound like they came straight out of a Pentecostal worship service. The bridge-“For how long I’ve loved my lover“- is a whole other ball game. He drops dynamics yet maintains the songs intensity as he repeats a single line, then layers on another melodic sentence, and then ad libs on top of that. It creates a powerful build up effect that ends in soft staccato sting plucks as his voice fades out. (This track gets bonus points because it holds the best line ever-“You’re my road, walking me home.” Love. )\n\n3. Sing is a pretty straightforward song, again showcases his story telling abilities. The guitar plays a few funk chords while the contrary motion of the descending bass in the song to the ascending vocal riffs add interest to the track. Ed is a total G in this song. He chatted up this girl he wants during the party, and now he’s throwing the ball in her court saying, hey, I know you want me, if you’re ready, I’m ready. -“I want you to be mine lady-to hold your body close” (He must have gotten over the track 1 and 2 breakups) He tells the girl, “If you love me, come on get involved, feel it rushing through you from you head to toe-sing“. (Is ‘sing’ alluding to an orgasm?) This song reads like a novella. I love the confidence displayed in this song-both in words and musicality. His falsetto adds interest and dynamic to a song that’s already funky and fun. Apparently, this song is his closer during his Multiply tour, because he can leave the crowd singing, “Sing” and everyone is happy that they got to sing with Ed Sheeran. “Can you feel it? -ohhhhhhhh” I felt those runs Ed. I felt them in every part of my soul.\n\n4. “Don’t” was a brief radio hit in the states. I remember hearing it being played on the radio and that Beats commercial, but not actually liking it. The hip hop beat was a little too bland, and bass too deep, and I always wished he was saying something instead of “ah la la la laaa“. I’ve learned to like it now, but it’s still probably my least favorite track. He tells the story of this girl-she seems crazy from the start, but he probably didn’t see it. He falls in love, but she ends up cheating on him even after he told her not to mess with his love. He does provide some solid relationship advice stated in the most positive of ways- “This is not the way you realize that you want it, It’s a bit too much too late if I’m honest“. Know what you got ladies, and take heed before making your decisions!\n\n5. “Nina” starts off with some piano. (I always enjoy the keys.) It’s a pretty simple story of how touring kept him from his girl. He clearly liked this girl, they turned up and sexed it up-“Creating new habits-And as if we were two rabbits“. (heh) His singing style more closely resembled rapping, with heavy use of triplets, which always sound so fly to me, no matter what you’re saying. His accent really stands out in the track, which is nothing but a plus. Best line- “And you don’t even need to worry about your weight ’cause we can all be loved the way that God made us“- shout out to the thick girls.\n\n6. The next track “Photograph” is probably the most understated track on the album. The beginning starts of cliched-“Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes“- and you’re listening like “ugh, another sad love ballad, really Sheeran?” However, about a minute into the song, the pre-chorus picks things up with some added piano chords and soft “oohhs” while his voice goes back up an octave. He then changes the tone mimicking the opening lines-“Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul“. After this he starts to lay down some wisdom that isn’t as basic. You start to feel the groove of the song and hear his harmonies underneath the main line. And by the end of the song, you’re gripping the photo you ripped out of him from your Rolling Stone magazine. and holding it close to your heart, eyes dilated and heart aflutter.\n\n7. “Bloodstream” is a very sensual track, but not in the romantic sense. It’s more about life’s other vices-“How’d I get so faded?” It’s a soft, groovy track, ladened with percussive devices. The bridge builds up a fabulous surround sound setting that highlights the intensity of the drugs Sheeran is alluding to in the songs. A 1960’s flute sample similar to the one at the beginning of Zeppelin’s Stairway to Heaven adds another layer that sends your brain into that psychedelic state. (Pink Floyd? Grateful Dead anyone?) The result in your ears is phenomenal. This track is proof to me that Rick Rubin is truly the prolific producer I learned about in my history of popular music class.\n\n8. “Tenerife Sea” refers to the waters of a beautiful island off the coast of Spain. Naturally, Sheeran is comparing the island’s beauty to a girl, and he does it in the most precious way possible. “You look so beautiful in your dress, I love your hair like that“. A slow, 60 bpm groove is built up by the constantly moving guitar line. I don’t understand how someone can move their fingers fast enough to create the subtle turns on guitar required to play this song. The guitar itself is enough to carry this song. The guitar part the last time the hook is repeated has hints of flamenco style and is clearly Spanish inspired. Boyfriends everywhere should take a lesson from this song to learn how to truly whoo their girl. I can only hope one day someone feels this way about me!\n\n9. Welcome to my favorite track on the album! “Runaway” was produced by Pharrell Williams and this man knows how to groove. “Runaway” sounds like a bunch of old black guys in a garage messing around playing funk music with a bottle of gin, smiling, and having a great time. Imagine that mixed with the polite young adult angst of Ed Sheeran telling his Dad he can’t take it at home and he’s out. My favorite part is the bridge. Sheeran does that amazing thing where he starts to rap again. He speaks in this deep voice while the music breaks down to only the essentials and the lyrics tell about him finally leaving. The rhythm of his voice against the soulful rhythm of the bass is masterful. It gives that expalanation this grimy edge and you can see exactly what’s going on in the story and why. “Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back as I packed my clothes up“.\n\n10. “The Man” is this albums genuine approach to hip-hop on all levels. The beat is an old school 1970’s rap beat mixed with quick guitar diddles. His rapping sounds like British Grime music, similar to Dizzee Rascal, Tinie Tempah, and JME, except with less EDM influence and more acoustic guitar. The message? We could have been together if you didn’t cheat. Good luck in life, tho. “I don’t love you baby, I don’t need you baby, I don’t wanna love you no, Anymore“. The outro solo is beautifully done, reminding me a little bit of Eminem’s “Lose Yourself”.\n\n11. If you haven’t heard “Thinking Out Loud” yet, you must live in a box in the middle of the Tenerife Sea. This love ballad has won the hearts of charts across the globe. It is a gorgeous song. “Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, place your head on my beating heart“. A guitar, bass, piano, and drum set up make this a fantastic walk-down-the-aisle song. Sheeran sings his soul out of his chest on this song. The laid back guitar solo is both funky and sweet. My favorite part about this song is how Sheeran ends the phrases in this song. These subtle vocal drop off of words that he probably doesn’t even realize he does i’s a piece of vocal magic that he has seemed to both trademark and master. My only complaint about this song is that I still don’t know why he’ll only be loving this girl until she’s 70. Ask Betty White, there is more to life and love after that age!\n\n12. “Afire Love” is a ballad written about Sheeran’s late grandfather and his battle with Alzheimers. He tells the story through the eyes of his Grandmother. It’s a beautiful song. While it starts out quite sad as he describes the decent of the disease and eventual death caused by it, but the bridge is an uplifting piece-“And my mother and all of my family rise from their seats to sing ‘Hallelujah‘”. Sheeran is big on family (what a guy) and this bridge signifies the familial unity presented at the funeral. I’m sure it was just as beautiful as this tribute.\n\nWell folks, I’m only giving you the basic album. “X” does have a deluxe edition which includes the track “I See Fire” from the Hobbit movie and a few other equally excellent selections, of which I will let you explore for yourselves! I’m looking forward to Sheeran’s tour stop in Atlanta. I sold my soul to get tickets for this show and I sincerely hope that Sheeran will deposit that soul right back to me as I weep from sheer(an) enjoyment. Pick up a copy, listen to the radio, download off of iTunes, stream it on Spotify, “X” is worth it in every way, shape, and form.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bocasmiles/break-your-heart-right-back-feat-childish-gambino\n\nI received a call around 10pm from my best friend’s dad. Hesitant to answer at first, I eventually picked up the phone and answered with a weak, “hello…?” To my surprise, he had purchased four tickets to the Ariana Grande concert next weekend for a mutual friends birthday party. He asked if I liked Ariana Grande and if I was available to go. To be perfectly honest with you, I had not heard any of her songs except for her brief part in Jessie J’s radio hit Bang Bang, and I had work the day of the concert. But, all my ears heard was “free” and “concert” and I let him know that I was a super fan and that I could definitely free up my schedule.\n\nAnd boy am I SO glad I did.\n\nWe had a black SUV pick us up the evening of April 1. We grabbed a bottle of champagne from the local liquor store, popped it, and toasted to the birthday girl during our traffic-filled descent into Dallas. I had been listening to Ariana Grande’s past two albums for two straight weeks in preparation for the concert via Spotify. Some of the slower songs were not my forte, but in no way could I doubt the powerful voice the itty bitty possessed. I was looking forward to hearing some of her more upbeat bangers such as “Hands on Me” and “The Way”.\n\nThe concert was held at the American Airlines Center, a fantastic venue where every seat is great. Our seats were no exception. We were located on the lower section of the right hand side and we had an amazing view. We weren’t close enough to touch Ms. Grande (not sure how rapper big Sean would feel about that anyways) but we were definitely close enough to feel the heat from the pyrotechnics that erupted from the stage.\n\nThe show began with a pre-opening act, an EDM DJ named Cashmere Cat. He’s relevant because he has a song with Ariana called Adore, which is fantastic. The crowd, of course full of preteens and their parental chaperones, paid little attention to the sheer amount of epic that Cashmere Cat was producing on stage. His music resembles transient stoner music, but with a happy, melodic vibe. While listening to the rainbows coming out of his DJ set up and into my ears, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to get up and dance, or just sit there and smile with the biggest grin on my face. His song Mirror Maru drifted me into this pleasant place where everything around me disappeared and it was just me and the music. I was not expecting him to be at the concert, but his 30 minute set literally put me in the best mood I had been in all year.\n\nFollowing Cashmere Cat, the British Boy Band Rixton was Ariana’s official opening act. Being too old to know who these people were, I was prepared to do more crowd watching of all the screaming girls instead of actually enjoying the performance. But that’s not at all what happened. At first, I sat down for the first song and patiently waited for Ariana to come out. However, I was quickly on my feet because they turned out to be a fantastic opening act. Their musical abilities were on point, and the lead singer captured me with his attempting to dance involving a signature fancy footwork, his enthusiasm, and his over all britishness. Just the groups very presence made me jump up on my feet for the rest of their set and start screaming like the overaged British Boy Band Groupie that I not-so-secretly am. Rixton performed a newly created song that was written by my personal favorite Brit, Ed Sheeran, entitled Hotel Ceiling. They heavily alluded that Ed himself was going to come out and sing the song with them. At that point, I was in tears. I had been trying and failing to get tickets to Ed Sheeran’s concert for a few months now. And now, out of nowhere, all my dreams were coming true. Except for the fact that it was April Fools. And Ed Sheeran was in fact not in the building. I felt pretty stupid for falling for that. Anyways, will I be adding Rixton to my Spotify starred playlist? Probably not, but I wish them all the luck with their music endeavors, and with keeping those teenaged hearts a-flurry.\n\nAriana finally came out around 8:30pm. She had a live band complete with cute, kimono-wearing violin chicks. She herself came out in her signature cat ears, high waisted sparkle shorts, and red bottom thigh high boots. Every move she made was so cute and perfect. Her legs covered in nude tights looked amazing, and her thigh gap was on point. She didn’t do much dancing, but a lot of super adorable cacheing back and forth across the stage. Her back up dancers provided very classy, trendy, yet not over sexualized moves that hyped up the energy.\n\nShe started out the concert with her part on Bang Bang and also perfectly rapped Nicki Minaj’s part, which was exciting. She followed that up with another show stopper, Hands On Me. She then started to slow it down with the track “Best Mistake”. Beau Big Sean’s head floated on screen as he rapped his part. She followed up with one of my favorite tracks of hers, “Break Your Heart Right Back”, where she samples Diana Ross’s “I’m Coming Out”. Childish Gambino’s homeless handsome chic graced the jumbo screen during his part in this song. [My baby loves me-but do he really doh?]\n\nAfter “Right There” and “The Way”, she emerged elegantly placed on top of a white piano to sing “Tattooed Heart”. Her musical banter with the pianist impressed me and made me smile. A few love ballads snuck in the way including “Why Try” and “My Everything” before the EDM influenced Love Me Harder was performed. She ended the hour and a half long concert with the hit “Problem”.\n\nAriana’s makeup was still perfect and she was still well composed at the end of her set. Me on the other hand, looked like a wreck. My hair had been killed by the humidity and my body weak from all the explosive dancing. It took everything in me to get in my final twerks for the trumpet filled chorus of “Problem”.\n\nAriana, you are great. Keep up the hard work. Don’t let Big Sean influence you in anyway but good. And thank you for the amazing evening. And for giving me the chutzpah to wear my homemade cat ears at some place outside of Akon.\n\n-Rose"
