        "text": "CHAPEL UPDATE\n\nWe welcome you to join us for Sunday Worship Service at 10:15am, and Wednesday Prayer & Healing Service at 12:00pm, currently held at St Francis Episcopal Church (small sanctuary). 2200 Via Rosa ~ Palos Verdes Estates ~ 90274\n\nChapel & Grounds Are Closed\n\nNO PUBLIC ACCESS ALLOWED ON PREMISES\n\nWayfarers Chapel management announced plans to move forward with disassembly of the iconic structure to save it from landslide destruction. Currently, Wayfarers Chapel and the surrounding grounds are closed due to the momentum of local land movement. The Portuguese Bend landslide has accelerated at an unprecedented rate and is dramatically impacting the Wayfarers Chapel campus and surrounding area.\n\nIt has been determined that the immediate deconstruction of the chapel is the safest and most viable preservation action to take at this time and will prevent further irreparable damage to the chapel’s structure and materials. The team will begin the careful disassembly of the chapel, which includes cataloguing and documenting each piece, preserving as much of the chapel’s original materials as practicable, and relocating all component parts to a temporary safe location until they can be reassembled. Simultaneously, the team will evaluate options for reconstruction on this site or one nearby. The Wayfarers community is committed to preserving the historic chapel and giving it a resilient future.\n\nFor more information, please visit our website to view our recent press release and frequently asked questions.\n\nTo Have and to Hold\n\nThe Perfect Day at Wayfarers Chapel\n\nFor over 70 years, the Wayfarers Chapel has welcomed couples from all religious and spiritual backgrounds to celebrate their wedding in this natural sanctuary. Designed by Lloyd Wright, the all glass sanctuary is nestled in a grove of towering redwood trees surrounded by 3.5 acres of beautifully landscaped lawns and gardens with a panoramic ocean view of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island. The exquisite Rose Garden forms a stunning background for wedding photography and videography. Evening ceremonies provide an opportunity for an enchanting candlelit atmosphere.\n\nThe natural plantings inside the Chapel eliminate the need for added decorations. Music is played by the Chapel keyboardist or you may have additional Chapel Musicians play, allowing you to choose a wide variety of music. Candles on the altar are lighted for your ceremony. Evening ceremonies have an additional candlelight option available.\n\nOur dedicated staff guides you from your initial reservation through your wedding day including a planning conference, your rehearsal, and the wedding ceremony. Your assigned Chapel minister will meet with you to discuss and personalize your ceremony."
