        "text": "[The brief essay below is the curatorial statement I wrote for Ear Taxi Festival 2021, which took place from Sept. 15 to Oct. 4, 2021 in Chicago]\n\nThe history and present of Chicago new and experimental musics is as complex, nuanced, non-linear, and fraught as that of the city itself. The word “sprawling” comes to mind; Chicago’s music is irregular, improvisatory, incomplete, unlikely; while it interacts with them, it ultimately evades traditional genre markers. (Sometimes I stubbornly insist on using the cumbersome word “musics” rather than the more friendly and familiar term “music.”) These musics are truly diverse, and in multiple senses of this loaded and often unsatisfying term. I want us to eschew a seductive but false (and potential dangerous) universality, and for us to be ever-aware that we’re dealing with a multiplicity of traditions that are both interrelated and autonomous, a sort of musical Venn diagram.\n\nAs a festival, Ear Taxi does not and simply cannot claim to be a comprehensive representation of all Chicago musics. However, it does hope to be as inclusive as we can manage with the resources we have available—to “HEAR CHICAGO” as our 2021 Mission Statement exhorts—and we strive to create unlikely encounters. Quite simply, we want you to bump up against some local music, music by your cultural peers, music about your location and of your life—in short, your music—that you may nevertheless not have come upon otherwise. We hope you will discover some things that are familiar and comfortable, that are new and surprising, that are nonsensical and zany, and—perhaps most importantly—that are challenging and disruptive.\n\nSpeaking of which: in the face of all this genuine positivity, the inspiring people we collaborate with, the remarkable work being made here, we also need some real talk. Let me speak here only from my personal positionality. I’m a white cis-male from the South who works largely in a field that is often called—depending on who you ask—contemporary classical music or new music (and these are heavily litigated terms). This field is a branch of, or maybe historically descended from, the US classical music industry, which is among the most imperialist and oppressive fields in contemporary culture. If US culture were on trial, charged with being what bell hooks calls the “white supremacist capitalist patriarchy,” the classical music industry would be Exhibit A. Classical music institutions are supported by generational wealth of the sort systematically denied to Black citizens in the US for the entire history of the nation. Classical music requires highly specialized training that is expensive, and therefore primarily available to white people from an upper- or middle-class background. Asian-Americans also show up in these spaces, but they are often caricatured and typecast (including physical stereotypes regarding their suitability to certain instruments) via the racist and de-humanizing discourse of the “model minority,” which, in our field, simply re-centers whiteness. In addition to being associated with economic status, this exclusionary training privileges a highly specific kind of virtuosity and instills submissive attitudes towards authority (whether the conductor, the score, the composer, the private teacher, etc.), in addition to habituating a perfectionism that can lead to pathological self-loathing. It is also ableist; there are many great musicians with disabilities (including deaf musicians), however, the nuances of their experiences are rarely centered. And while there are scholars doing excellent work in the fields of music and disabilities studies, the discriminatory social practices disabled musicians face in all kinds of various environments—educational, recreational, professional—are not a common part of our discourse.\n\nSimultaneously, our industry under-compensates musical workers of all races (include lower- and lower-middle-class white people) who are not associated with high-status institutions. Within higher education, schools of music, departments of music, conservatories, etc. tend mostly to be schools of classical music (though many have jazz programs as well, normally less well-funded) without, as Loren Kajikawa has written (1), naming and owning their colonialist exclusion of other modes of knowledge and expression. The hierarchical, privileged, and patriarchal structures of these institutions not only enable abusers to have long careers that mostly avoid accountability but protect and reward them. Schools of music, concert halls, and other musical institutions are located on land stolen from Native people that these institutions mostly do not even take the very bare-minimum step of acknowledging.\n\nHowever, as George E. Lewis has written (2), “the primary remit of new music and new noises [is] to declare that change is possible.” Elsewhere (3), Lewis quotes Caribbean authors Jean Bernabé, Patrick Chamoiseau, and Raphael Confiant in support of what Lewis describes as the “condition of créolité” by which 21st century music finds itself marked: “[we] will be torn between several languages, several histories, caught in the torrential ambiguity of a mosaic identity. To present creative depth, one must perceive that identity in all its complexity. He or she will be in the situation of a Creole” (4) (In Praise of Creoleness, p. 112). Lewis goes on to say (p. 446) that “[t]he mobile musical subject becomes reconfigured in ways that pluralism cannot hear, resulting in new musical forms that exceed the limitations of postmodern pastiche.” Indeed pluralism cannot hear this. We reflexively double down on exclusionary historical practices, reify contingent procedures, stubbornly holding onto neoliberal logics of the “marketplace of ideas,” hide behind a putatively objective (but in fact subjective, often arbitrary) quality metric in music; but these are all choices to deny, erase, and misunderstand the complexities and contradictions of lived experience. It’s not merely that our old spaces need to make room for voices the classical music industry has othered and excluded (especially Black voices), though this is certainly necessary—and we probably need some redistributive and reparatory processes for that. It is that we need to engage in a project of creating liberatory spaces for future musicians and our future selves. Every music these days reflects what Lewis calls a “mosaic identity,” and embracing and holding multiple meanings simultaneously is a step towards freedom.\n\nArtist Samson Young puts it less grandly but more snappily: writing in a different context (5), he describes a particular cultural item as “a communal invention, a strange [...] but beautiful glitch that we share;” this sure sounds a lot like the music in my world. I’m looking for beautiful glitches—accidental truths, productively disruptive mistakes, the truly unexpected—in Ear Taxi Festival 2021, and I hope you’ll find some with me. Maybe they’ll be the glitches that facilitate some change. We must keep in mind, though: we’re talking about glitches, and this doesn’t imply a facile solutionism that sees easy or technocratic fixes to complex problems. To further parse Lewis’s statement, we’re still at the point where we’re making the declaration that change is possible—my sense is that we’re only seeing the beginnings of actual change itself. We all have healing to do, and that takes time.\n\nSpeaking of complex problems, by way of ending, I want to acknowledge a necessary incompleteness and imperfection. To be honest with you, this statement has gone through several iterations. I’ve updated it as my thinking has changed, as I’ve learned, as I’ve made new connections, formed new relationships, and become a better listener. I don’t plan on arriving at a finalized version of this, and will continue to change it as I grow. Feel free to check out previous versions here. I also invite any feedback (michael@newmusicchicago.org) on the current version of this statement by way of holding myself to my communities—I have made mistakes and I will make surely continue to make them.\n\n—-\n\n(1) Kajikawa, Loren. \"7.

Paris: Gallimard, 1993.\n\n(5) Citation coming: this is part a text in an exhibition of his work I saw at the University of Edinburgh in August, 2019.\n\n[This essay is a draft of an op-ed that I wrote shortly after James Levine’s death was announced on March 17, 2021. It partially addresses the New York Times’ coverage of Mr. Levine. I submitted this op-ed to the Times but they did not respond.]\n\nI was, at the time, an aspiring conductor growing up in Savannah, GA. I’m guessing I was 17, as I was in the driver’s seat, ferrying a much older musician, a friend of a music teacher, to the airport to fly back to New York City. This person knew I was an aspiring conductor. They had some connection to James Levine and offered to introduce me to him. While doing so, this person said, “keep in mind that you are pleasant to look at,” and that I should be careful when dealing with Levine.\n\nI did not follow up on the offer, but the interaction stayed with me. Twenty-five years later, I take two things away from it. First, that the state of the classical music industry at the time (and that we have inherited today) was so toxic that a chance at an early career breakthrough came in the same breath as an ostensibly helpful, but rather offhand, tip about a sexual predator. Second, this may have been the moment that first revealed to me that the classical music industry is something deeply flawed and problematic, its leaders the recipients of tremendous privilege, Exhibit A of what bell hooks has called the “white supremacist capitalist patriarchy” (which George E. Lewis invokes regularly in relation to the new music field).\n\nConductors have too much power. Not merely in rehearsals or artistic planning, say, but in public imagination, with administrators, with critics, etc. Along these lines, I believe a lot of the discourse surrounding Levine commits a category error. It’s a mistake to conflate the quality of his musicianship (clearly there can be no objective evaluations, but I’m willing to concede something general, like that he was a “a really good musician”) with other aspects of his life. Conductor as arm-waver/rehearser/performer and conductor as public figure, wielder of power and influence, etc. are not the same thing, though they are commonly assumed to be; we ought to interrogate critically the conventional wisdom that the latter flows directly from the former. A human is a lot of things. Speaking personally, I’m a pretty decent conductor but not a particularly good cook. Obviously, my cooking abilities are not socio-criminal problems, thus not relevant to institutions I’m a part of. However, serial sexual assault is very, very relevant. The genius myth, tragically, conflates all of these different characteristics in a mystical soup that only serves to excuse the worst behavior by the worst people. (A. Z. Madonna has recently written about Levine as a case-study in the dangers of genius-worship culture.)\n\nPut another way, not only do conductors have too much power, but many people overestimate or misunderstand what they actually do, strictly speaking, in their role as conductor. There is nothing inherent in the qualities of a good conductor that makes child rape any less unacceptable. It isn’t some metaphysical truth that in order to continue to rehearse and perform effectively, a conductor needs to abuse minors. Indeed, as a number of people have noted—and it’s unbelievable that we even have to say this—there are plenty of good conductors out there who don’t molest children. And if you find yourself thinking something like, ‘but none of those conductors could have achieved the heights of Levine’s performances,’ ask yourself what your evidence is. How could you prove this counter-factual?\n\nThis is the logic Levine apologists really seem to be suggesting, reduced to its simplest: systematically enabling and protecting a serial child molester was worth it because it may have produced somewhat more aesthetic enjoyment for the patrons of the institutions he was involved with. My claim here is that this trade-off is not only clearly evil but also fallacious.\n\nIf you are one of these patrons, a listener (especially a white one), making Levine’s disgraced end about your own experience rather than that of Levine’s victims or the institutions that enabled him, first of all, Robin DiAngelo has a term for that, and you should check out her book. Second, if you have enjoyed Levine’s performances, if you have fond memories of them that you want to cherish, you might start by considering that a term like “Levine’s performances” is not really accurate. As a conductor Levine did not make any sound. The countless men, women, and non-binary people who played in the orchestra, sang in the chorus, were soloists, etc., however, did. It is unnecessarily hierarchical, callous, and insulting to marginalize their contributions. Clearly, the convention of crediting an orchestra's very identity to its conductor is not specific to Levine, but endemic to the classical music industry as a whole, one of very many things that must change in our discourse. As I said earlier, conductors have too much power. (I know because I am one.)\n\nSpeaking of these aforementioned musicians—the professional instrumentalists and singers—Levine’s death happens in the wake of the Metropolitan Opera having treated its orchestra and chorus monstrously and inhumanely for nearly a year: it furloughed these artists without pay in April 2020, even after having paid Levine a $3.5 million settlement. The final line of Anthony Tommasini’s disgraceful apologia for Levine is thus a paternalistic platitude masquerading as a call for the Met to do the right thing: “[o]ne way for the Met to honor the best elements of Levine’s hopelessly tarnished legacy would be to save the magnificent orchestra he built.” To read a critic in The New York Times speaking of professional musicians as if they are Levine’s children, subjects, or playthings, and not very real human beings and workers struggling through a global pandemic, is truly breathtaking.\n\nWhat we—the classical music community, and yes, I am looking especially hard at you, fellow white cis-dudes—can do is reflect honestly, even if it is is very painful (how could it not be?), on our role in perpetuating and supporting an industry that allows a career like Levine’s. Levine is not merely the proverbial bad apple (though don’t forget what the bad apple does to the barrel), or an isolated incident, but part of a much larger system that enables such abuses. We must make real, substantive, possibly radical, changes—not reforms. Frankly, I am skeptical that we will do this, but I hope I am wrong.\n\n… and if at the end of this op-ed you still find yourself saying a version of “... but he was a great musician,” you are part of the problem.\n\n[I wrote this essay in the summer of 2020, initially intending it to be an op-ed that; unfortunately I never found time to look for an outlet for it, so now it will live here.]\n\nDuring this time of crisis and change in the United States—related both to COVID-19 and to the racial justice uprising following the murder of George Floyd—the US classical music industry must reckon with, and take proactive steps to correct for, its complicity in what feminist author and activist bell hooks calls the “white supremacist capitalist patriarchy.” Such a moment demands, and makes possible, radical change, not merely incremental reforms. The sorts of changes required of us now are not in one area or at one level of the industry, but are multi-pronged and overlapping.\n\nFirst, a few definitions and caveats. By “classical music industry” I mean institutions like conservatories and university schools of music, symphony orchestras, opera companies, chamber music organizations, etc. And though neoliberalism is a global phenomenon, I confine my remarks here to the US classical music industry—as opposed to that of other countries—because peculiarities of the US political and economic system (particularly the tax code) are important structuring elements of this industry. (For a treatment of this subject in a European content, see Christina Scharff’s excellent Gender, Subjectivity, and Cultural Work: The classical music profession.)\n\nI will not litigate here the question of whether the aesthetic content of the music itself is part of the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy; i.e., perhaps Wagner’s Die Meistersinger or Debussy’s Golliwog’s Cakewalk are, but Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony is not, etc. Nor will I do more than mention in passing the problematic nature of the term “classical music,” which, as musicologist Robert Walser writes, is “an ‘invented tradition’, whereby present interests construct a cohesive past to establish or legitimise present-day institutions or social relations[...] The hodgepodge of the classical canon—aristocratic and bourgeois music; academic, sacred and secular; music for public concerts, private soirees and dancing—achieves its coherence through its function as the most prestigious musical culture of the twentieth century.” These are both worthy conversations; however, here I write about the US industry of classical music, which is populated by classical music laborers, and institutions that employ and train them.\n\nbell hooks remarks the following about the phrase “white supremacist capitalist patriarchy:” “I wanted to have some language that would actually remind us continually of the interlocking systems of domination that define our reality[...] a sort of short cut way of saying all of these things actually are functioning simultaneously at all times in our lives[....] I won't be able to understand it if I'm only looking through the lens of race. I won't be able to understand it if I'm only looking through the lens of gender. I won't be able to understand it if I'm only looking at how white people see me.” She often deploys this concept to critique popular culture, but it is not difficult to see the extent to which it applies to the US classical music industry. It is white supremacist because of the majority of its audience, musicians, and composers are white. (This is not to say that individuals, necessarily, carry prejudice in their heart; it is, however, to say that the industry participates in structural racism.) It is capitalist because it relies on accumulated wealth to sustain itself. It is patriarchal because most of its performers, administrators, and composers are men; in addition, some women have internalized this male dominance of the field, and, advertently or not, defend this system.\n\nRegarding the “white supremacist” part of the triad: the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent uprising have prompted widespread and long-overdue attention to matters of racial inequity all across culture. The US classical music industry is among the worst offenders here, with its fetishization of “absolute music”—music that transcends extra-musical meaning, and that abides, supposedly, only by its own internal rules—the logic of which is only too reminiscent of discredited “colorblind” ideology, and which attempts to put it beyond question, critique, historicization. As George E. Lewis has written, “[a] cone of silence hangs over the work of Black composers from Africa and its diaspora. It is not that Black men and women have not written music, but too often it has been ignored—and thus assumed not to exist at all.” However, it is not merely Black composers that have been ignored or under-represented. BIPOC performers and administrators in our performing and educational institutions are found in disproportionately small numbers across the board. The US classical music industry must take immediate steps to diversify personnel in all institutional settings: from pre-collegiate music schools, to conservatories, to professional performing institutions. The problem must be dealt with from multiple angles: the “pipeline” problem must be addressed by schools, and solutions to diversify the ranks of performers, composers, and administrators must be implemented immediately. The tired concerns about, and overblown fears of, a drop in ‘quality’ must be viewed for what they are: stand-ins for the maintenance of socio-political power by white people. (Usually an appeal to ‘quality’ is vague and undefined, an appeal, perhaps, to a famous composer or performer; a person invoking a decline in ‘quality’ ought to be pressed on exactly how one measures such a thing, and who is allowed to do the measuring.)\n\nRegarding the “capitalist” part of our triad, we face thorny problems. The US classical music industry is simultaneously both under-capitalized and deeply inequitable in its distribution of resources. Perhaps because of US culture’s glorification of individualism, competition, and wealth, unlike many other countries, the classical music industry in the US receives vanishingly small amounts of support from federal, state, and local governments. Classical music institutions, most of which are 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organizations, thus rely heavily on philanthropy—either support from foundations or wealthy donors who receive a tax write-off for their contributions. Such an economic structure favors the “haves” over the “have nots,” and perpetuates systemic inequality; it has privatized patronage of the arts, rather than placing responsibility for funding them in the commons. Larger organizations can employ development staff, and cultivate relationships with big-money donors and foundations, making it difficult for smaller or newer organizations to compete. (Notice that even here I have subtly allowed a notion of competition between organizations to creep in; while this may make sense for corporations, are we sure it is a healthy framework for arts organizations?) All of this renders classical music labor—with a small number of notable exceptions like tenured university and orchestra positions (even these less secure than previously thought in the era of COVID-19)—precarious and unstable. There has been a recent trend in education towards the development of entrepreneurship curricula. However, there is little evidence that such curricula are successful on a large scale or in the long term, and indeed it is not even clear how one would measure the success of such training. Surely, however, the wholesale COVID-19-related cancellation of gigs, performances for months on end, in some cases entire seasons, is all the evidence we need to prove that precarious labor is unsustainable for the vast majority of the US classical industry. Whether we call performing musicians members of the “precariat” or use scholar Angela McRobbie’s term “risk class,” it is clear that a new, shared, and clear-headed understanding of the severe plight of US classical music laborers is needed.\n\nRegarding the “patriarchy” part of our triad, the solution may seem straightforward: hire more people who are not cisgender men (i.e., women and trans people)—especially in areas of the field that are most traditionally patriarchal—like conducting and upper administration, and address the gender pay gap in the industry. However, along with patriarchy comes a tendency to fetishize unquestioned authority. Conductors, composers, instrumental teachers, vocal and instrumental soloists, and others are traditionally treated as geniuses whose judgment and behavior is beyond critique or question. We should note that precisely because of this “genius ideology,” some professions in the US classical music industry tend to select for personalities that seek such praise and deferential treatment. An extreme case is that of James Levine: the all-powerful conductor of the Metropolitan Opera whose sexual abuse of young men was an open secret in the US classical music industry for decades (as an aspiring conductor at age 17, I was advised to be cautious about seeking a meeting with him because I was “pleasant to look at”). James Levine is hardly the exception, and every conservatory-trained musician is likely either to have encountered personally, or know people who have encountered, sexually, psychologically, or even physically abusive teachers and conductors. It is clear that, in addition to hiring more people who are not cisgender men in roles traditionally favoring cis men, the narrative of the genius, of the artist who can’t be bothered with rules, must end.\n\nWhat this moment both demands and makes conceivable is a truly radical re-organization of the classical music industry in the US. For this, utopian imagination is required, and I share musicologist Marianna Ritchey’s view (in her recent book Composing Capital) that “[the] endeavor[...] to think and imagine differently[...] remains a necessary one.” This brief essay is meant only to introduce conceptual frameworks for understanding the state of this industry; it is clear from the pandemic that its structures were all too easily devastated. We must rebuild doing several things simultaneously. 1) We must proactively diversify—in terms of race, ethnicity, and gender—at all levels of this industry, from early education to prestigious performing organizations, from personnel to music performed. 2) We must develop a shared and clear-eyed understanding of the deep structural economic inequities that we face. We must reject the competitive narratives and self-exploitation of neoliberalism, reversing the logic of Claire Chase’s famous exhortation to young musicians—“I'd love for every single one of you to put me out of business”—in favor of a shared model that emphasizes community over individuality. We must develop an economic model, in short, that foregrounds sustainability of careers and treats musicians as subjects, not commodities. 3) We must dismantle patriarchal structures, and the genius ideology that accompanies it, in favor of a healthier model of power distribution in which people of all genders are equally influential.\n\nFinally, perhaps most importantly, we must re-center who we serve. Section 501(c)(3) of the US tax code provides tax exemptions for “[o]rganizations organized and operated for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals,” in other words, for what we generally call a public, rather than private, benefit. The US classical music industry must take the spirit, not merely the letter, of this seriously. It must abandon its twin colonializing projects: that of paternalistically bringing so-called “great music” to the so-called masses, and that of obsessively seeking to “create new audiences”—as if the audiences serve the arts organization and not vice versa. The classical music industry must engage in dialogue and reflection about how it serves its community. This is an especially tricky and difficult task. Surely one of the single most important benefits of musical art is that it can be challenging, difficult, new, and productively disruptive; thus being “beneficial to the community” cannot simply be programming in a way that cynically caters to popular taste. Neither, however, can it be defensively posturing itself as conserving ill-defined “great music” or tacitly letting its community be a self-selecting and self-reinforcing revolving door of donors, foundations, performers, and audience members who are “in the know.” In short, the US classical music industry must view itself for what it is: not primarily part of a tradition, but a contemporary, living cultural phenomenon that must contribute to its society and community in a manner that is supportive and healthy.\n\n[This essay initially appeared as the program note for the DePaul Concert Orchestra’s performance of this work on March 16, 2019.]\n\nShostakovich: Symphony No. 8 in C minor, Op. 65\n\nThough this is surely an odd thing to say about one of the most performed composers of the 20th century, there is a sense in which Dmitri Shostakovich’s music is underrated. So relentlessly tragic were the historical and political circumstances of mid-century Soviet Russia that his creative achievement and craftsmanship are often overshadowed by the extra-musical aspects of his life. Shostakovich reception suffers, as it were, from over-contextualization, or perhaps more precisely, from being wrongly contextualized. 21st century US concert programming tends to focus on a standard repertoire that is presented as beyond reproach and timeless; thus when a music that is clearly not timeless presents itself, our tendency seems to be to swing in the opposite direction. To ignore Shostakovich’s craftsmanship as a composer, though, is to do him a tremendous disservice, and is also to distort the most interesting contextual aspects of his music.\n\nThe symphony as a genre had a hard time in the 20th century; even by the end of the 19th, composers were beginning to think that it was “written out.” There are no symphonies to speak of by some major early 20th century composers like Debussy and Ravel. And while the likes of Stravinsky, Copland, Barber, and Bernstein all wrote symphonies, these, for the most part, are not the pieces that jump to mind first we think of when talk about them. Shostakovich, however, wrote 15 symphonies, more than any major symphonist since Beethoven. He also made the genre of the symphony speak to 20th century—he made its passé formal conventions culturally relevant in a way that few others have. The 7th, the so-called “Leningrad” symphony, written during World War II, was heard by millions all over the world on international radio broadcasts. Shostakovich was on the cover of TIME magazine, a thing that would be hard to imagine in today’s cultural milieu. The current work, the 8th symphony, was also written during World War II and came on the heals of this international celebrity. In spite of his international stature, though, Shostakovich continued to face persecution at home; little did liberal-minded American listeners know that Shostakovich's wartime music has as much to do with the brutality of the Nazis as it does the oppressive regime in his own country.\n\nShostakovich managed to engage with the tradition of the symphony on its own terms; but he also did this in ways that spoke compellingly and forcefully to a contemporaneous 20th century audience. He achieves unity of the five movements of the 8th symphony through an old-fashioned quasi-Beethovenian development of a few small motifs. Both the primary and secondary motifs are simple intervals. One is a stepwise motif, a 2nd (sometimes major, sometimes minor), that always goes up or down and returns to its starting pitch—a motif of futility. The other is simply a perfect 5th.\n\nThese two motifs are presented viciously by the cellos and basses in the C minor first movement's introductory bars: C, B-flat, C, followed by C, G. This gives way to the beginning of the sonata form proper and what is, quite simply, an extremely long first theme in the violins. There is no obvious structural cadence; the listener may be expecting a four- or eight-measure theme, yet this one is twenty-five at least (at a very slow tempo), and evinces an oppressively pessimistic affect. This is typical of Shostakovich's rhetoric—to understand a listener’s expectations and to provide something that is exaggeratedly, not merely slightly, more or less than what they expect. It is a rhetoric that is meant to make 19th century symphonies look well-behaved, while simultaneously casting the 20th century equivalent as unruly, mangled, deformed, excessive, hyperbolic.\n\nAfter brief development by the winds, a second theme emerges in the violins (accompanied nervously by the other strings) forced into an asymmetrical 5/4 meter, which gives it a hobbled and broken character. The motivic 5th descends and is followed by the indecisive 2nd, now ascending.\n\nThe ensuing development section, like many of Shostakovich's, is a steady angst-ridden crescendo that puts both themes in guises that one could hardly have foreseen, climaxing with the first theme played canonically as a demonic march. The percussion interrupt to signal the recapitulation, as if a distorted paraphrase of the same moment in the first movement of Beethoven’s 9th symphony. Hardly noticeable because of deafening and volume over-wrought afftect is how literal a recapitulation it is: the trumpets and trombones play is exactly the same notes that opened the symphony in the cellos and bass. From the dust following the violent collapse arises a plaintive English horn recitative. As if reminiscent of the same moment in a different Beethoven symphony, No. 5, the English horn takes the end of the introductory theme and spins it into some of the most direct music Shostakovich ever wrote. The second theme is recapitulated in a major key which, not altogether surprisingly, doesn't last. The first theme of the sonata form returns to close the movement, now all of the intervals directed downward, over a chromatically descending bassline. The movement closes on a C major triad with an added D—it is the stepwise motif present as a harmony (C-D-C), and it deprives us of a real resolution.\n\nThe second movement is the first of two Scherzos, this one a driving, unhinged march. The stepwise motif is now a half-step heard in the first bar, and the entire melody outlines the fifth from D-flat to A-flat. The Trio section illustrates another of the ways in which Shostakovich engages symphonic tradition. Trios of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven symphonies are often more harmonically relaxed than the Minuet or Scherzo they follow, and some feature solo wind players. Shostakovich's Trio involves a solo piccolo and E-flat clarinet, both playing demented circus music, before a more bombastic return of the opening material.\n\nThe third movement, the second Scherzo, is cast as a Toccata. Shostakovich creates a six-minute movement in which some instrument plays a quarter note on every single beat of every single measure. There is no relenting; it is a non-stop, inhuman, machine-like drive forward, a classical form subjected to one of Stalin’s five-years plans. The motivic 5th is hidden in the arpeggios, but more interesting is the location of the step-wise motif. It is present in the oboe and clarinet as a slow, shrill, high E, F, E. An octave displacement of the final E gives it an added element that is both bitter and expressive. The Trio section again features a solo wind player: in this case, a trumpet playing a ferocious, sarcastic military fanfare mocked savagely by the rest of the orchestra. The strings are muted for the return of the opening, the brutality now as if seen from afar, detached. The movement climaxes with the timpani pounding out the quarter notes, accompanied brutally by the rest of the ensemble.\n\nThe percussion interrupt, as they had done in the first movement, to signal the beginning of the fourth. Shostakovich casts this slow movement in another antique form, the Passacaglia. This serves at least two functions. One is, again, to engage older music. Besides the ground bass Baroque form that is the reference point, music like the Finale of Brahms's 4th symphony come to mind. The other function is maybe more personal. After three movements of emotional intensity, a Passacaglia seems like the right vehicle for obsessive introspection following a trauma.\n\nExamining the repeating eight-measure ground bass line itself (heard immediately after a final tam-tam crash) the step-wise motif is immediately audible; less clear is that the two central notes in the bassline, G# and D#, are a 5th apart. This theme actually resembles the first movement's main theme in other ways – there are distinct rhythmic similarities, as well as a similar cadential gestures. It is as if the Passacaglia theme is some distant, ghostly half-memory of previous music. The movement meanders on, through a headache, as if trying to remember. Haunted horn, piccolo, and clarinet solos litter the musical landscape as the ground bass begins inevitably again and again. The clarinets, as if sensing a distant ray of light, stumble as if by accident onto a C major triad, we are surprised to find ourselves already in the Finale. The key choice is significant, as is the method of arrival—it is surely another direct reference to Beethoven's 5th symphony, whose course outlines a C minor to C major trajectory and does so with no break between the final movements. For those really keeping score, the harmonic relations are even the same: Beethoven’s long-held A-flat major chord’s bass note eventually resolves to G, then to C at the beginning of the Finale of the 5th symphony; Shostakovich’s G#, A-flat’s enharmonic, resolves to G (instead of F double-sharp), then to C at the beginning of Shostakovich’s Finale.\n\nParenthetically, Beethoven's 5th symphony, of course, had significant extra-musical meaning in World War II, the dot-dot-dot-dash being the Morse code letter \"V.\" (What could be more demoralizing to the Nazis than the allies appropriating the great masterpiece of a German composer to stand for \"Victory?\")\n\nIn Shostakovich’s symphony, instead of a blazing fanfare, what we get is a modest bassoon solo, still obsessively fussing over the step-wise motion, which is now C-D-C. It remains a motif of futility. The melody begins with the motif, comes back to it midway though, and finally closes on it. We seem not to have gotten anywhere.\n\nThe ensuing music is a series of variations in different families of instruments. A secondary theme involves a grim peasant dance in the cellos and basses, interrupted by demonic fiddle music. This is followed by a fugato whose subject is, inevitably, the step-wise motif. At the climactic moment the percussion re-enters and the opening of the first movement returns arrestingly, just as it had in that movement's recapitulation. Here though, it is reharmonized, mangled, transfigured, and quickly collapses. The recapitulation is compressed and sardonic, the peasant dance now heard in a single bass clarinet and solo violin, and the bassoon winding its way back to the opening theme; the recapitulation ends with an ever ascending solo violin line.\n\nWhat are we to make of the coda of the symphony? It is a static C major triad in the upper strings, with the step-wise motif repeated below by the flute and pizzicato violas; chromatic notes mar the texture. Though a pure C major eventually arrives, it seems more a moment of resignation than resolution. It seems to be a triad of survival, not of triumph and is—maybe, if one were to find a glimmer of hope is such resolutely negative music—the only thing that Shostakovich allows himself to believe in. Given all the composer had been through in his lifetime until that point, at least it is something.\n\nThe Second Sexing Sound Symposium (SSSS!), a series of public events in Chicago dedicated to ideas, research, performance, and conversation surrounding female and trans-identifying practitioners in and around the sonic arts (sponsored by the Goethe-Institut Chicago), took place on Dec. 2-4, 2017. Among the featured artists was German composer-performer Neo Hülcker, whose work Crackles was premiered by Mocrep at the 2016 Darmstadt Summer Course for New Music in Germany, and performed in Chicago as part of SSSS!. Here is my interview with Neo about their practice and philosophy, originally published in Cacophony Magazine on January 22, 2018.\n\nMichael:\n\n1) I’m curious about your background, as a person who studied composition in Germany with at least two people who I would identify as IMPORTANT GERMAN COMPOSERS (Dieter Mack and Manos Tsangaris), but whose work really does legitimately push the boundaries (“boundary-pushing” is a catch-phrase in the US for art that, unlike yours, isn’t) of what we consider a “musical composition.” I think this question has two parts:\n\na) what process did you undergo philosophically or psychologically or spiritually or economically or educationally to arrive at a place where you self-identify as a “composer-performer” but write music like Crackles, which is mostly movement-based on the part of the performers; or, maybe more simply put: why is important to you to call yourself a “composer”?\n\nNeo:\n\nIt all began when I was a kid: When I was 9 I found out that my cassette recorder had a recording function and so I started to record my whole life with it. I recorded at home, at school, when I was playing with my friends...I also invented acoustical situations and radioplays for this cassette recorder and became more and more obsessed with sounds. And also with performances and little theatre plays I invented for my friends and me. When I was 12, I started to learn the piano and compose for instruments. Later, when I studied composition, I got more and more interested in all these performative aspects on stage. I began to invent sound installations and performances and got a lot of inspiration by fine arts and performance art.\n\nI've also always been interested in the whole frame of a concert, in the situation on stage itself, in the bodies we are observing on stage, in all the different perspectives that are taking place during a moment we call performance. (At the same time I also love to observe all these not-staged performances during our everyday lives.)\n\nI also like to compose with very different materials that don’t need to be sounds but that I can form in a musical way. And I prefer to work with reduction: with these simple things that shape a situation on stage: the presence of bodies, movements, lights, sounds, bowing... There is so much that is going on and I like to focus on these little basic elements that each contain a whole world in themselves.\n\nAnother thing is that I like to push our modes of perception: what if I perceive this or that as music ? How will my mode of listening change? How will my thinking about music change? What if I perceive something as music without hearing anything through my ears?\n\nMichael:\n\nb) how is working in the US different in this regard? For all the similarities of German and US arts scenes, there are substantial contextual and historical differences, and slightly different conversations those cultures are having. How does Crackles fit into those conversations differently?\n\nNeo:\n\nIt’s not so easy for me to answer this question as there are so many different aesthetics and movements in both countries. And I think I would need to know more about the different cultural conversations.\n\nWhat I can see is that there is an international circle of composer performers, like Mocrep for example, who are very open for any kind of ideas, collaborations and working processes. Who play objects and their bodies as instruments as well or even more as their traditional instruments and who are honestly interested in experimenting.\n\nSomeone once said that Mocrep, Bastard Assignments from London and some other composer performers who all have worked together could form into an international supergroup. That’s so nice: that we support each other, work together and build a community.\n\nOne thing that seems different to me between Germany and the US is the financial support: In Germany it's relatively easy to find funding for projects while it seems to be more difficult in the US. I see people having several money-jobs and I have the impression that teaching at a university almost seems like the only option if you don’t want to do another non-musical job. In Germany I see more people who can survive just by composing, performing or curating.\n\n[Here's Tim Cape, Edward Henderson, and Josh Spear of Bastard Assignments performing Neo's Crackles in London in 2017.]\n\nMichael:\n\nSo, working with Mocrep on Crackles in Darmstadt in 2016, then having it performed by them again in Chicago a year and a half later on the SSSS! (and by others in the intervening time)... what was this work to you at the time of its creation, and how has that changed? To what extent is it Mocrep’s work, rather than, or as much as, yours?\n\nNeo:\n\nWhen I wrote the piece for Mocrep I was curious to try out something new for me, I wasn’t sure how things would work out on stage. After the first performance I got the feeling that I wanted to work more in this direction and it actually inspired me so much for other pieces I composed later. I felt that there was a path that I wanted to figure out more for my artistic work. And it’s still like that: after the last performance of Crackles I had so many new ideas for a next piece that will be different but related to Crackles in many ways, I can’t wait to work on these ideas.\n\nThe first version of the piece was for 9 performers on stage, after that I made a version for 3 performers. It was quite interesting how different things worked with these shifting numbers of performers.\n\nI wrote the piece for Mocrep, so I had these people and bodies in my mind when I was composing it. I also asked them to make videos for me during the working process: I gave them instructions for different movements, like for example to stand in a row and bend up and down as slowly as possible...so I could get a feeling for them. We also changed and added things together during the rehearsals and for that it was really helpful to practice the piece for a longer period of time and work on it together.\n\n[Here's Crackles performed by Mocrep at the International Summer Courses for New Music Darmstadt, August 2016]\n\nMichael:\n\nAlong those lines, it seems to me that questions of power, on many levels, are key to any understanding of music’s history and affect. Surely one of the main questions regards the power dynamic between composer and performer; in traditional (“classical music”) settings, the composer is literally ordering a performer’s muscles to execute a series of actions, controlling the performer’s body in a substantial sense. While this doesn’t have to be read, necessarily, as violent, it sometimes (or often) can be. So, in that you subtitle Crackles “for bodies on stage” you appear to be exhibiting a sensitivity to this dynamic—almost drawing attention to how fundamental it is to music. How, though, when writing such music, do you avoid an even more explicitly controlling power dynamic? To ask in a different way: what is the power-sharing arrangement between you and Mocrep? or in any work for “bodies on stage” that you might make?\n\nNeo:\n\nI think bodies on stage always have a meaning and are not exchangeable without implications. Very often it seems like the performers bodies don't matter at all in contemporary music or in classical music in general. You get the feeling that the idea is that they all disappear behind the music, but I don’t think it’s working like that. Bodies on stage are so present and they come with a whole history of representation: of performing a certain role in society, with a history of oppression or of privilege.\n\nThe power-sharing arrangement of Mocrep and me is a playful one: I wrote a piece with explicit instructions and I even give some of these instructions during the piece with my voice. They are executing what I'm telling them live, so it’s an exaggerated, exhibited situation of these arrangements between composers and performers. Crackles is an agreement to perform these roles in the frame of the piece, it's a performed top-bottom-situation that might remind on other power relations in reality.\n\nMichael:\n\nWhat do you think of Chicago? I’ll leave this question intentionally vague so you can say really whatever you feel like saying.\n\nNeo:\n\nI love Chicago! Such a wild mixture of different scenes and cultures. Lots of new music and art is going on and people were so welcoming and open minded. I felt that there was a real interest in exchanging artistic (and other) ideas. And I also liked that the people I met were so educated and sensitive about queer topics. Oh and I love the lake.\n\nGuess who can’t wait to come back to Chicago :-)\n\nMichael:\n\nWhat does your first name mean? It has recently changed, yes? If so, why the change?\n\nNeo:\n\nI’m trans and wanted to have a more gender neutral name. I wanted it to be short, start with an \"n“ and sound nice, so I came up with \"Neo“. That \"Neo“ is the latin translation of „new“ was a happy accident. Also people told me that the guy from Matrix is named „Neo“ which I wasn’t aware before I chose the name which is a bit funny.\n\nI started to use it in summer 2016, so it’s not super recent.\n\n[This essay was originally published in Cacophony Magazine on August 23, 2017]\n\nSitting on the porch of a house in Logan Square, Ludwig Abraham told me this about how he met members of Mocrep for the first time:\n\nI met Chris [Wood] and Zach [Moore] in Darmstadt in 2014. The guy who pushed me to composition classes, into composing, into school for composers—he said to me ‘hey there’s somebody you need to meet.’ And then I met them and we just talked. We just liked each other, and it was on. And then they had some days off afterwards and I said ‘yeah, you can come to my place because there's Ruhrtriennale,’ which is one of the world's biggest festival for performing arts. It’s the area where my school was and is a former industrial center so it may have the same problems as Detroit but not in that big a way. And so they came by and I think the installations we saw were pretty shitty but we just hung out in my flat and listened to records one day, the whole day, and then we saw Planet of the Apes: Revolution in 3-D in an empty theater. And that's it. And then like on the last day they were like, ‘hey we actually have this ensemble and don't you want to do something.’\n\nAt this point, Ida Cuttler, a Neo-Futurist—drenched in a not-totally-clear combination of a sweat and water from the just-concluded rain shower—suddenly appeared at the gate, having finished a jog, curtailing our conversation briefly. I fiddled with my phone, made a joke about exercise, and Ludwig and I resumed our convo as Ida went to the back of the house.\n\nI think I was there because I was meant to be interviewing him about his upcoming show with Mocrep, Pants, Pants, Pants, which the website describes thusly: “through show tunes, fast choreography, interviews and games and balloons, Mocrep and Ludwig Abraham team up to beg the question ‘What is entertainment?’.” Having apparently unconsciously internalized that blurb, I found myself asking him that exact question multiple times.\n\n[Distractionem I: As it turns out, Ludwig and I both had formative experiences with Weezer’s Blue Album. When was the last time you listened to it? Ludwig was initially drawn to “Say It Ain’t So” and “Buddy Holly”; but this is my article, not his, so I’ll point you instead to “Surf Wax America.”]\n\n[Did you know Deidre is from Buddy Holly’s hometown? And had a crush on him in preschool??]\n\n[[ML’s note]: that sentence ^^^^^^^ was written by Deidre.]\n\nIn the midst of an attempted question, Ludwig interrupted me to say “the thing is, entertainment is the human quality. I think that’s what defines us; we search for entertainment. Playing music for fun, for yourself even if you're not aspiring to be a rock star or pop star, it is entertaining. Or reading a book is entertaining. I think the search, that we are searching for diversion, that's first of all human, then it gets capitalized on secondly. The same with food.”\n\nThis is a striking claim, and since I’ve been trynna read some serious philosophy recently, I sought further definition. As it turns out, this is slippery and hard to pin down metaphysics, in a sense because he’s right: it's difficult not to imagine that just about all human activity might be described, broadly, as the search for diversion, distraction, and/or entertainment, and this list of all human activity includes what I’m doing now, say, the activity of metaphysics-construction, which realization might render my activity trivial or tautological. Ludwig references this famous Louis C.K. bit about cellphones—“you need to build an ability to just be yourself and not being doing something… that’s what the phones are taking away, the ability to just sit there... like this… that’s being a person”—but without Louis’s didactic, moralizing sense. If anything, Ludwig seems determined to be the opposite, to be a creature of his times, to exploit what it might mean to live in a world of constant distraction and entertainment-seeking.\n\n[Distractionem II: so, I tried using an iphone app called Steno to record and transcribe my conversation with Ludwig. The results were predictably hilarious but unexpectedly fruitful; you could try it sometime if you're experiencing writer’s block and are unsure how to generate material. Consider, for instance: “Like flying with like exact considered Heifetz. Of course yeah I mean he could have to grow its appeal yeah so that defense here. Yeah because you're going to get going or at yeah also saw cats. Okay like any was really yeah yeah and so you.”]\n\nSomething about how Ludwig presents himself comes across to me as very specifically European and very specifically German—a certain confidence that what he is saying and doing is right, or ok, or makes sense. [Hmmm, sorry to interrupt again, but I have to; being honest, even though I wanted to make the point, I found it hard to complete this ^^^^^^ previous sentence because I notice myself, even in the moment I ascribe a characteristic to someone that I say is “European” or “German,” I realize how deeply problematic that is to say. And even more so these days, where people in the United States—with a chief executive who really thinks that Nazis and first-amendment-rights-exercising protesters are basically the same, or that the first US president and the leader of an army of traitors are equivalent—are coming to understand that they have even fewer things in common and even less agreed-upon language than they ever knew. In this context, I feel hesitant to call anyone anything at all, and I have no confidence in the words I use, and no particular reason to hope that anything I say might be meaningful.] And also in this context, I find Ludwig a reassuring presence—a person who wants to, and is ok wanting to, give people experiences that are complex and uncomfortable, but fundamentally entertaining.\n\n[Distractionem IV: sorrynotsorry more from my phone: “Stimpy the some. %Hesitation should go to Princeton %HESITATION. Pete impedes. All that's. Like I first band I honestly love through my brother was comes with roses. You know so it's like this weird like. Everything is like. That was like the dominant force of from me that's kind of this. When you're young and there's like this untainted it's.”]\n\nML: What does a person who comes to your show get out of it?\n\nLA: Hopefully they are entertained... in a good way. I’m really really serious. I think there’s not enough... also I work lots in the theater... I think the biggest problem that there is right now is that it’s not entertaining enough. In any sense...in a “I’m frustrated” or “I’m happy” or “I cried” or “I’m angry” or whatever. It’s too much catering to a discourse of whatever scene. Of high art theater or high art dance. I always say ‘theater theater’ or ‘dance dance’ or ‘music music.’ [ML here again, hi. This reminds me of Johannes Kriedler’s “stil” series, what he calls “music with music”; also a formulation in this outstanding article by Marek Poliks: “new music is music about new music”, which I think he doesn’t mean negatively.] It’s always meta-art, where it’s like you need to have studied how Beat Furrer comes up with his polyrhythms. Yeah, I know how he comes up with that, I studied that; it’s boring! It doesn’t help me when I listen to the music. I just don’t think it’s interesting. Someone else can think that, and that’s really great. Hopefully what I try to do is… I want to be uncomfortable for somebody, and I want to be at the same time also very nice. I’m coming from a place where I’ve learned I want to make beautiful moments for someone or offering them what can be very very inviting; but also produce something very very unsettling. Hopefully in the end someone goes out and says “that was fun; that was interesting.”\n\n[Distractionem V: Now I find myself regretting my choice of Weezer songs above. My initial thought was to link to “The World Has Turned and Left Me Here” but I changed it, thinking something more compact and sexy would make it more likely that you’d listen to the whole thing. In reality TWHTALMH is a much better figure for Ludwig’s work, formally speaking. It’s conventionally constructed except for the fact that during the last chorus, the counter-melody—what had been in a sense a musical distraction—completely takes over and consumes your attention; the result to my ear is something exaggerated and suspicious, too obvious to be taken at face value, uncanny-valley-esque.]\n\nI asked him if he were a composer. Is what he's doing music? Is what Mocrep is doing music? What is music anyway? I expected a complex answer to this. [Speaking of complex answers, do you know the book by G. Douglas Barrett called After Sound: Toward a Critical Music? It’s provocative, and—possibly—right.] My experience, as a Chicago/US person in music, is, tbh, pretty, maybe overly, fraught on these questions. I feel defensive about it, and from a lot of angles; my childhood and adolescence was spent strategizing defensive postures, to myself and others, to criticisms of my decision to go into an impractical field; and my adult life involves a lot of trying to explain to people why they should like music they don't like. Ludwig’s answer: “I do write music and studied composition so for tax reasons and in a theatre context, where sometimes your title is helpful, I have to be one. I don't identify with the so-called new music scene and its image of a composer if that is what you mean.”\n\nMe: “In what sense is what you do music?”\n\nLudwig: “I write music.”\n\nLudwig: “But it’s always more that music; it’s music plus context in a very much more aggressive way than the genre of new music or classical music deals with it. Sometimes in a bad way; sometimes way too much focus on the context and not enough focus on the music, you could say. I think this piece [Pants, Pants, Pants, I assume he means] is like... I write a lot of music. That’s what I do all year long, writing a lot of music, writing a lot of texts, but I always have the framework, I always think about what do I want to do with this; it’s much more purpose-driven in a broader sense.\n\n[Distractionem VI: I now feel self-conscious about having chosen a Latin word for “distraction.” I think it’s because I thought it would be funny if it had a sort of Medieval scholastic quality to it, as if a distraction was a particular category of thing that had a function that could be stated and a set of clear characteristics associated with it. But now it’s just pretentious.]\n\nLudwig described his education to me: he started with pop music, got into noise music, and then new music, wanted to go into what he calls the “free arts scene”, pursuing each with, it seems, an intensity and focus characteristic of a person who ends up working on a highly ambitious set of art-making projects in foreign countries at the age of 29. Maybe one way of reading this is as long, drawn-out series of entertainments: education as an entertainment, say.\n\n[Distraction [got tired of Latin] : I can get down with this^^^^^^^^^^, and in fact my education has been similar. But I want to exercise a sort of professorial caution here; how much is your monthly student loan payment? I have tenure, and mine is still not paid off.]\n\nI realize that you may not have actually seen any work of Ludwig’s this whole time, and this is partially my fault (but partially his: he admits to being bad at documentation in a serious sense; probz got distracted or something). You might check out this Andy Kaufman tribute, The World Is A Wonderful Place. I watched the whole thing, but got distracted about 9 minutes in—realizing that I didn’t know Andy Kaufman’s work that well—and paused it for several days, browser window remaining open and all.\n\n[It is secretly a source of low-level shame for me that I don’t have nuanced opinions about famous comedy performers; makes me feel so uncool.]\n\nLudwig: “I think the desire to have something that is just, in big quotes, ‘art’ is selfish.”\n\n[My no-opinions-about-comics self-shame is really a story about thinking I’m not funny.]\n\nIn spite of, or tbh probably because of, my ignorance of comics, I feel totally entitled to theorize, especially after doing a bare minimum amount of research into this topic. Since Ludwig mentioned him several times in our convo, I listened to the recent Louis C.K. Netflix comedy special 2017, and understood something about why a sort-of-in-name-only composer would find this work remarkable. There’s a symphonic quality to C.K.’s routine, and I don’t mean this idly or preciously. It has large blocks—movements, say—with internal structures that resemble musical form that (as Deidre pointed out to me) contain yet smaller forms that are even more intricately wound. The broad-brush subjects are idiosyncratic and provocative commentaries (whose precise meaning is difficult to ascertain) on hot-button cultural topics like abortion, suicide, race, masculinity, sexuality. It’s a grand political and public statement delivered in an artistic way, exactly like what the symphony was meant to be in a completely different socio-economic context. Certainly I don’t want to tell you that Pants, Pants, Pants is going to be symphonic or operatic or whatever, because honestly I don’t really know what the show’s gonna be like; but I do want to tell you that I’m sincerely v. interested in how Ludwig thinks about genre and medium. [Not totally related, do you know Chris Fisher-Lochead’s string quartet about comics, Hack, recorded amazingly well by Spektral Quartet?]\n\n[Feeling the need for a bland conclusion.] I’m a pretty stressed out person; and Ludwig said something similar about himself. It occurs to me that something about his work might help me relax occasionally, and be ok becoming more, in a word, entertained. [I feel certain I’ll regret this previous sentence when it’s published.] I don’t mean to be uncritical of these ideas, which are not unproblematic [for instance, what is the role of criticality itself in a universe of constant entertainment-seeking? And, especially urgent these days, what is the role of politics?]. But. Do you mind if we just get to that later? Is it hopelessly naive of me to say that I’m just genuinely curious, and look actually forward to seeing Pants, Pants, Pants? [Really, actually, you know, it might be great.]\n\n[Here is the unedited Steno transcription of our entire interview except for the part that my fucking iphone stopped recording. I think it would be an act of supreme discipline to try to read the whole thing, probably not entertaining at all. If you can read it without getting distracted, I’ll high-five you.]\n\n[Finally, I guess I want to offer a one of those fake I’m-sorry-if-you-were-offended non-apologies: if you find it off-putting that I heavy-handedly, eye-rolling-emoji-ly wrote all of my distractions and diversions into this piece, please know that I mean it not only as a smug, too-clever-by-half experiment in form, but as a way of for-realz considering and seriously engaging with what seemed to me a really interesting way that Ludwig seems to think about the world. idk, you might try it, if you like; noticing your distractions, I mean.]\n\n[A version of this piece originally appeared in Cacaphony Magazine on May 26, 2017.]\n\nJacques Attali, in the inconclusive final chapter of his book Noise: The Political Economy of Music[1], writes about composition in a way that is not common; in contrasting it with the mechanism of repetition (i.e., reproduction) that has preceded it in the 20th century, he says composition is (or should be) (or will be) something\n\nin which the musician plays primarily for himself, outside any operationality, spectacle, or accumulation of value; when music, extricating itself from the codes of sacrifice, representation, and repetition, emerges as an activity that is an end in itself, that creates its own code at the same time as the work.\n\nComposition thus appears as a negation of the division of roles and labor as constructed by the old codes.[...] The listener is the operator. Composition, then, beyond the realm of music, calls into question the distinction between worker and consumer, between doing and destroying, a fundamental division of roles in all societies in which usage is defined by a code; to compose is to take pleasure in the instruments, the tools of communication, in use-time and exchange-time as lived and no longer as stockpiled. (p. 135)\n\nAt the end of a fabulous, recently written (April 2017, I think) essay entitled “Thinking About New Music,” composer/apparent-spaceship-lover Marek Poliks lists several positive things he’s incorporated into his own music-making that he thinks we ought to consider for ourselves, among which is this:\n\nPerform your own work. Identify as a musician, not a composer. Find other musicians who will perform with you and make your music together. Feature guest artists. Ask for help, ask other people what they think. Attribute authorship to the group, you made it together.[2]\n\nBacking up: it does seem, doesn’t it, that new music has been in a state of paralytic re-thinking of itself for a while (Attali is writing in 1977 and Marek is doing so 40 years later. The latter talks about 2008 as a pivotal year, and he’s right; but I also think it’s worth hypothesizing that something cyclical might go on as well—2008 is not the only time that musicians have said to themselves “wtf are we doing”[3]). And it also seems, doesn’t it, that this state of paralytic re-thinking has felt like an urgent emergency-crisis for the last year or so (the unceasing collective heart attack that is the current US/worldwide political environment being both a symptom and a cause). I hope this doesn’t seem like a grandiose claim—I’m just setting the stage.\n\nI feel somewhat insecure and not particularly qualified to generalize at the moment, but I also feel equally duty-bound to point to and look at things that propose provisional, hesitating responses to the seemingly insurmountable problems of culture in the world. The peculiar experience afforded by Danny Clay and Earsight Duo (video artist Xuan and percussionist Peter Ferry)’s “on/off” at High Concept Labs is such a thing—a proposition in answer to seemingly impervious questions—though I actually don’t think their description of the project as something “blurring the line between performer, composer, and listener” quite does it justice.\n\nBen Melsky, Deidre Huckabay, and myself were the three participants(?) in the 9:30 show(?) (which started at 10:05) on Friday night, May 5, and were joined by Peter in the performance(?), thus making us a quartet. Ben and I had just come from the Spektral Quartet Contempo concert at U of Chicago (on which me and a few Dal Niente players had performed), thus the quartet as musical institution was on my mind. It would be difficult to overstate how conspicuously well Spektral Quartet plays new work, and it would be equally difficult to overstate how different the Ferry-Huckabay-Lewanski-Melsky quartet experience was.\n\nI don’t know, what do you think about this?—maybe there’s something utopian-propositional about a quartet. It’s an even number of people, unlike the Supreme Court or the UN Security Council, and there’s no Vice President to cast the tie-breaking vote for Betsy DeVos. (Just a reminder: that happened. Betsy DeVos is the US Secretary of Education. Just a reminder.) The existence of the quartet is an incessant negotiation because of the ever-present, structurally inherent possibility of a 2-2 tie. However hierarchical things might be, the format simply does, in the end, demand that everyone work together. Or, to put it more accurately and more succinctly, as Doyle Armbrust did in a rehearsal: “I hate me more [than you hate me].” #utopia\n\nOK, so what happened on that Friday night. Really, I’m trying to get to my experience, but I keep getting sidetracked by myself: Ben, Deidre, and I walked into the HCL space, led by Peter. There was a circle drawn in the middle of the floor, with what turned out to be four synthesizer boxes on its perimeter; we all explored the space a bit, not knowing what was going on; in order to be a guide for the perplexed, I suppose, Peter walked through the circle. I am a toxic combination of always curious but only rarely impetuous, and for this reason I surprised to find myself the first one messing with a synth; once it made noise we all immediately sat on the floor in a circle.\n\n(Attali, describing a part of Breughel’s Carnival of Lent, at the very end of the chapter on composition: “Five people in a circle. Are they singing? Is there an instrument accompanying them? Is Brueghel announcing this autonomous and tolerant world, at once turned in on itself and in unity?” [p. 148])\n\n(OK, I realize this doesn’t quite work because Attali talks about five people and we were only four. The world is actually imperfect and contingent rather than autonomous and tolerant. Sorry.)\n\nThe synths have an on-off switch, they have a sort-of volume knob (one that actually seems to change the timbre as well as the loudness), and they have a frequency knob (one that makes things higher and lower). The on-off switch makes a satisfying sound; this sound is probably not intended to be part of the work, but I don’t care. (Attali, you might remember: “to compose is to take pleasure in the instruments”.) The range of possibilities that the two parameters make available is completely engrossing and immediately all-consuming. Whoa, this goes really high! Wait, it goes higher? Wait, it can get louder??? WAIT IT CAN GET STILL HIGHER AND LOUDER. WAIT WAIT WAIT WHAT HAPPENS IF I TRY TO DO THE SAME AS ANOTHER PERSON’S HIGH/LOUD SYNTH. WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT. WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WHAT IF I’M LIKE REALLY CLOSE BUT A LITTLE OFF OR WHAT ABOUT LIKE AN OCTAVE LOWER OR WHAT ABOUT SOME RANDOM WEIRD-ASS INTERVAL WAIT OR WHAT IF I DON’T DO ANYTHING BUT STUFF CHANGES ANYWAY.\n\nThe experience of sitting in this synth quartet is intense; the synths are often loud, but more to the point, the ever-changing frequencies and the room’s acoustics do things to my head. You might think I mean this in a metaphorical or psychological sense, but actually it’s physical. I imagine that I’m feeling my eardrums; sometimes my brain seems like it’s in a different place than my face; I’m having a hard time locating senses in my body; I’m experiencing some sort of acoustical phantom limbs. I’m half-aware that I’m responding to the actions of my fellow quartet members, but I’m not sure how or why I’m responding, what I want, what it means, or what I want us to be doing. How do we think this is to go? Are we trying to achieve unity? Are we attempting to remain in a state of enjoyable tension? Are we playing? Is this is a game? Is this a piece of music? What is a game? What is a piece of music? (Recall Marek’s suggestion: “Attribute authorship to the group, you made it together.” We definitely made it together, whatever “it” was, though I’m not sure if “authorship” is a thing we were looking for or quite deserve.)\n\nOK, I'll interrupt again and pose a serious question for you: what are your experiences like when listening to performances, and/or performing yourself? Mine vary widely—even more these days than before—from the seemingly transcendent (like whoa that german sixth chord in the slow mvt of bruckner 7 i could just die rn) to the pedestrian (is that a theme from earlier i can’t quite tell) to the annoyed (oh FFS i told that person so effing many times not to miss that entrance) to the bored (omg why are they taking this repeat i don’t need to hear this music again) to the despairing (srsly fuck this whole thing such bullshit i should stop doing music and get a law degree and go work for SPLC what if i literally walked offstage at this very moment what would everyone do and who cares anyway)[4].\n\nHere though, in HCL, among these people that I love in various ways, I experience myself listening-performing and am doing so in a Goldilocks just-right of creative flow and self-awareness. I am making the piece and the form and the rules and the genre with my friends in real time. And looking back on the experience, I even worry that as I commit these words to computer screen that they betray a fallen-ness and a certain critical distance and an already-subject-to-memory-death-ness and that, worse yet, they will somehow negatively impact your experience of such a piece when you have the opportunity to take part in it. I hope you’ll accept my apology and forgive me for future harm to your listening-performing; but somehow I thought telling you about my experience was important for me to do and for you to read.\n\nAt some point various instructions started appearing on a screen. There was a long period during which we walked around the space while the synths sustained some dissonant non-chord; based on your location, its sound changed, as if it were the un-arrival point in a non-cadence that not-closed the non-form. Towards the end there was a graphic score that, tbh, I didn’t love; maybe it was a bit prescriptive and sort of a buzzkill at the end, I don’t really remember what I didn’t like about it. I do recall at some point getting all conductor-y and like trying to get the four synths exactly in tune with each other on a very high frequency, and had to just deal with it when my rage for order was frustrated.\n\nLook. I wish I could say that all of my writing since the election has been a sort of participation in group therapy, but I don’t even think that’s quite true. It’s way more therapy for me—personally, as an individual—than for the group; it’s that I fear that what I’m doing as an artist is deeply and painfully irrelevant and I’m trying to work through those feelings; and I simply have to trust that I have your best interests in mind as well, and to hope that everything I write isn’t just so exhaustingly self-indulgent as to be not worth your time.\n\nAttali is particularly concerned with what he calls “stockpiling”, which is what happens in the “repeating” phase of music history (roughly, the industrial 20th century); what he calls “composition” is an answer to this. “Stockpiling then becomes a substitute, not a preliminary condition, for use. People buy more records than they can listen to. They stockpile what they want to find the time to hear.” (p. 101) If I were to theorize, I might say that stockpiling, so described, is merely a thing that capitalism realized it could hella-mega-do with drives (in the psychoanalytic sense) already inherent in earlier music—to codify forms, to control the experience of time. The next logical step beyond refining these things into formenlehre-type models is to emphasize the control part, rather than the experience-of-time part, with the eventual outcome that no one listens to music but everyone owns a lot of it. For Attali, the possible escape from this is a vague vision of a person playing “primarily for himself, outside any operationality.” For Marek, writing 40 years later, it takes the form of the realization that “new music 2.0” “shrugged out” in 2008.\n\nTo be tautological: music is always about its time and place, and this is because the people that make it make exactly what they make and not something else; which is to say, the music they make must be the stuff they are driven to make. I don’t really want to do a bad job of trying to explain why I think this is (something about Trump, late capitalism, Roger Ailes, Middle Eastern politics, the weakness of the EU, WMD’s, bots, idk so much else), so much as I want you to understand something about the listening-performing experience I had with Ben, Deidre, and Peter. It wasn’t transcendent (though it was arresting), and it may not have been great or even good music, and actually maybe it was not music in a sense in which I am/you are accustomed to thinking of it; but it felt right and it felt new.\n\nAnd actually this, most of all: I am interested in knowing from you, in some sense specific or general: what feels new and what feels right to you these days, musical or otherwise?\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1 Jacques Attali, Noise: The Political Economy of Music, trans. Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1985); here’s a decent summary of its arguments in the event that you don’t have enough stockpiled time.\n\n2 Not actually gonna talk too much about Marek’s essay here, but I do want to encourage you to go read it if you haven’t. His analysis is shrewd and his writing is fun.\n\n3 I don’t want to get too hung up on this because it’s not the point to of this essay, but to be fair to Marek, he also acknowledges this, and I wouldn’t to misconstrue him: “To repeat the so-tired-as-to-be-silly refrain aimed at so many people in v2.0: ‘ok, fine, but this isn’t new, this is all super 1960’s, these people aren’t radical.’ I am really not interested in having this conversation. Whether or not new music 2.0 is just a cyclical inversive reanimation of v1.0, its practice is nonetheless occasionally at odds with its intentions.” Anyway like I said go read his essay if you haven’t.\n\n4 If you walk offstage in the middle of a show, stop doing music, get a law degree, and go work for the Southern Poverty Law Center, I would strongly support your life choice. I just want to affirm that unambiguously.\n\n[This piece is an expanded set of program notes for the April 28, 2017 joint concert of the DePaul Concert Orchestra and Ensemble 20+]\n\nJean-Féry Rebel (1666-1747): “Le Cahos” from Les Elemens (1737) (DePaul Concert Orchestra)\n\nJohn Cage (1912-1992): Atlas Eclipticalis (1964) (Ensemble 20+)\n\nJoseph Haydn (1732-1809): Introduction (\"The Representation of Chaos\") to The Creation (1798) (DPCO)\n\nPeter Ablinger (b. 1959): Three Minutes for Orchestra (2003) (DPCO)\n\n* Intermission *\n\nPeter Ablinger (b. 1959): Three Minutes for Orchestra (2003) (DPCO) (repeat performance)\n\nCharles Ives (1874-1954): Scherzo: Over The Pavements (1906/1913) (Ensemble 20+)\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770-1827): Symphony No. 3, Eroica (1806) (DPCO)\n\nI. Allegro con brio\n\nNOISE\n\nAmong the oldest aesthetic and theoretical concerns in the field of music is the attempt to create a clear sense of just what is music and just what it is not—where noise starts and where it ends. Given that this has persisted, explicitly or implicitly, for centuries, our current project is not to attempt yet another insufficient and unsatisfying answer; rather, it is to examine how this question has ramified in music of the distant and recent past, and how we hear answers to those questions today. And it is far from an empty theoretical exercise. We can experience, in each work presented on this program, composers experimenting with the limits of the musical vocabulary of their culture, pushing or breaking or ignoring boundaries, and generally struggling with material they exert only varying levels of control over.\n\nJean-Féry Rebel was hardly a revolutionary firebrand. His was a successful career as, among other things, a violinist and the court composer to Louis XIV; he was 71 years old in 1737 when he wrote his ballet Les Elemens, which, in spite of his background as a force of establishment and tradition, contains some of the most untamed music of the 18th century. Wrote Rebel:\n\nThe introduction to this work is Chaos itself; that confusion which reigned among the Elements before the moment when, subject to immutable laws, they assumed their prescribed places within the natural order. This initial idea led me somewhat further. I have dared to link the idea of the confusion of the Elements with that of confusion in Harmony. I have risked opening with all the notes sounding together, or rather, all the notes in an octave played as a single sound. To designate, in this confusion, each particular element, I have availed myself of some widely accepted conventions. The bass expresses Earth by tied notes which are played jerkily. The flutes, with their rising and falling line, imitate the flow and murmur of Water. Air is depicted by pauses followed by cadenzas on the small flutes, and finally the violins, with their liveliness and brilliance represent the activity of Fire. These characteristics may be recognized, separate or intermingled, in whole or in part, in the diverse reprises that I have called Chaos, and which mark the efforts of the Elements to get free of each other.\n\nJohn Cage, two centuries later, had rather different ideas about chaos, though perhaps it behooves us to use his terms, “chance” and “indeterminacy”, and to take his various statements on these subjects at face value:\n\nMy intention is to let things be themselves.[...]\n\n[Indeterminacy is] the ability of a piece to be performed in substantially different ways[....]\n\n[Music is] an affirmation of life—not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply a way of waking up to the very life we're living.\n\nAtlas Eclipticalis, an indeterminate work, was composed by Cage using the “Atlas Eclipticalis 1950.0” (a 1958 atlas of the stars made by Czech astronomer Antonín Becvár). Cage took the star charts and superimposed over them musical staves to generate notation; thus he completely removes any of his own taste or volition from the compositional process. A complex of permissive and sometimes not-completely-clear instructions govern its execution, thus making it both indeterminate in its composition and its performance. It may be played in whole or in part by any number of players, up to a full orchestra. It may be played simultaneously with Winter Music, for one to 20 pianists (which it is tonight), or with Song Books. Most provocatively, Cage writes that “a performance may be at any point between minimum activity (silence) and maximum activity (what’s written).”\n\nCage wrote, in his essay Music as Process: II. Indeterminacy, the following:\n\nOne evening Morton Feldman said that when he composed he was dead; this recalls to me the statement of my father, an inventor, who says he does his best work when he is sound asleep. The two suggest the \"deep sleep\" of Indian mental practice. The ego no longer blocks action. A fluency obtains which is characteristic of nature. The seasons make the round of spring, summer, fall, and winter, interpreted in Indian thought as creation, preservation, destruction, and quiescence. Deep sleep is comparable to quiescence. Each spring brings no matter what eventuality. The performer then will act in any way. Whether he does so in an organized way or in any one of the not consciously organized ways cannot be answered until his action is a reality.\n\nThis is severely disciplined music that demands from its composer, performers, and listeners complete awareness, total attention to the sound around them, and careful removal of all sorts of agency that interferes with those things. As it turns out \"let[ting] things be themselves\" is not easy for humans, whose basic modus operandi is to attempt to exert change, in some manner, on the world in which they live.\n\nThe introduction (“The Representation of Chaos”) to Joseph Haydn’s Creation (which, though written in 1797-8, became one of the greatest hits of the early 19th century), may seem similar to Jean-Féry Rebel’s work: both are intentionally transgressive of various rules of their respective discourses, and the compositional performance is intended ultimately to reinforce the prevailing social ideologies (as represented in the guise of conventions of tonality, form, and instrumentation). Haydn’s vision, though, is both more raw and more tame at the same time. Its slow and formless meandering, its incorrect execution of common practice harmonic progressions, its stunningly prescient and coloristic orchestration, all paint a sophisticated picture of chaos; its rather ordinary deployment of key areas—based on the the limitations and normal use of the available instruments—show us that the frame of this picture is distinctly that of the late-18th century bourgeoisie.\n\nAustrian composer Peter Ablinger writes [Author’s note: all quotations slightly edited from composer’s website]:\n\nOnce—I believe it was 1986, high summer—I came on something remarkable while on a walk through the fields aast of Vienna near the Hungarian border and close to the birthplace of Haydn. The corn stood high and it was just before harvest. The hot summer east wind swept through the fields and suddenly I heard das Rauschen [noise/the sound]. Although it was often explained to me, I can still never say how wheat and rye are different. But I heard the difference. I believe it was the first time I really heard outside an aesthetic circumstance (say, a concert). Something had happened. Before and after were categorically separated, had nothing more to do with each other. At least it appeared to me then that way. In hindsight I recognize/remember other comparable experiences that had to do with a jerking open of perception, but the walk through the corn fields was perhaps the most momentous.\n\nHis Drei Minuten für Orchester (Three Minutes for Orchestra) is part of a larger work, Altar, about which the composer writes:\n\nALTAR (2002-03)\n\nis one piece in three different situations.\n\nThe first situation involves so-called \"listening columns\" in public space where one could take headphones and listen to what (right now) can be heard in the actual situation. The second situation [entitled “Complementary Study”] is an 18 minute long, quite hermetic, noise block including an almost inaudible live cello. The third part is \"Three Minutes for Orchestra\". It consists of 3 layers: first, ambient street sounds recorded at the exact places where the listening columns were located, secondly, the orchestra part with its parallel analysis of the frequencies of these street sounds, and an additional piano part which is just an ascending scale.\n\nAll 3 pieces are presenting the same 3 situations in different medias. Therefore the piece is also about different possibilities of (artistic) representation.\n\nLater:\n\nThe \"Three Minutes for Orchestra\" also uses sound that was previously recorded on the the “listening columns” in the city center. The piece is divided into three parts, each of which is symmetrically arranged around the 40-second playback of a \"listening column\" recording: the piano begins, the orchestra begins, the sound recording plays, end of the orchestra part, end of the piano part.[...] The orchestra plays an acoustic analysis of the recorded sound landscape at a resolution of 2.5 seconds (which corresponds to a sampling rate of 0.4 Hz). The piano moves slowly in every part, similar to the cello in the \"Complementary Study\" of Altar, through its frequency range. The orchestra, like the piano, uses only the seven notes: C, D, E quarter-tone flat, F, G, A quarter-tone flat, B-flat. The orchestra \"accompanies\" the city sounds of the CD, not vice versa.\n\nCharles Ives, professional insurance salesman and amateur composer, lived in a basement apartment (“poverty flat” as Ives and his roommate called it) in Central Park West in the opening years of the 20th century, while working for Mutual Insurance Company in New York City. From the window he observed people going by “in all different steps” about which he said, “I was struck with how many different and changing kinds of beats, times, rhythms, etc., went on together—but quite naturally.” His Scherzo: Over the Pavements is the result of these listening experiences; a “kind of take-off of street dancing,” it is initially straightforward but develops into a chaotic series of independent streams and styles, all woven together into one work. A ragtime section bookends a fiendish piano cadenza (on the one hand, “As Fast As Possible” but, apologetically, “to play or not to play”) as well as a concatenation of a brass march and a woodwind dance.\n\nFinally, Beethoven’s Eroica symphony, noise on a grand scale, and writ on a multiple levels. Try as we might, it would be simply impossible for an audience of 2017 to recover the feeling of upheaval caused by the political, social, and intellectual revolutions of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. One can study the history of, and thought behind, the art and politics of the time. But fundamentally, we are unable to experience the extent to which the sweeping away of the ancien regime in France changed people’s perception of life itself, and the medium via which it is lived, time. As musicologist Reinhold Brinkmann has written: “The most overwhelming effect the Revolution had on its contemporaries was indeed an entirely new mode of experiencing time.” This experience was based on the recognition that far-reaching and profound social changes were taking place, changes as extraordinary in speed as they were unforeseen. Contemporaries noted the tempo of change, the acceleration in the passage of time itself, and “contemporaneity of the non-contemporary” the latter a result of differing levels of acceleration in disparate fields. The Eroica symphony is time-capsule of this feeling, a representation of literal and historical and psychological noise.\n\nThe work opens with two bracing, aggressive chords, in media res interruptions of whatever is happening previously. (These chords have been so much the obsession of culture and the collective unconscious that there exists a youtube video of nothing but a series of chronologically progressive recordings of these two chords). They are followed immediately by what can only generously be called a \"theme\" in the cellos whose stable E-flat major triad is immediately belied by a harmonically ambiguous C-sharp. The subsequent music is a breathless hodge-podge, a frantic exposition of thematic fragments, sudden dynamic changes, shifts of the perceived meter, strange accents, and eventually, a sort of orchestral record-skipping—getting stuck on a single chord that, while recalling the opening, defies other aspects of the musical logic of Beethoven’s culture. The key of B-flat major is eventually achieved, but the exposition is repeated with a jarring move back to E-flat.\n\nThe long development section goes further. Sforzandos, unlocalizable disruptions of consciousness, ring out unpredictably. There is a short fugato. Strife returns, intensified. Diminished chords create harmonic uncertainty. Hemiolas create a the tension between the triple meter printed and a clearly audible duple. The tension becomes unbearable on a chord that is aggressively confrontational in its dissonance, and the music collapses onto the heavy strings. A mournful theme emerges in the oboes—the first real melody of the movement, and, though motivically related to the opening, new. In a truly unusual formal move, it lends all the more emotional weight to the moment, and serves as a sort of \"N.B.\" that tells us what we already knew: this is not a normal, well-behaved sonata form. The music dwindles to near inactivity. The second horn stumbles in obliviously to catalyze a change. (Famously, even Beethoven's student Ferdinand Ries thought it was a mistake during the first rehearsal-performance; the none-too-pleased composer struck him on the ear—a curious sort of noise, indeed. But let us notice that it perfectly captures, in a single gesture, Beethoven’s entire project, and the aim of this concert: to hit the sense of hearing, to wake it up, to make it reconsider what it previously understood to be wrong.) While the long recapitulation basically follows the exposition’s patterns, it ends without having achieved a definitive, unambiguous version of the opening theme. The post-formal coda finally offers a provisional completion—heroically in the first horn, then in the first violins accompanied by a horn chorale in canon, and eventually triumphant with trumpets. But the more we hear it, the more cyclical and sing-songy it seems. The completion is an illusion. Make no mistake: the ever-changing nature of this music reveals it to be a fragment of revolution—theme as enigma, sonata form as agent of change, music as noise, symphony as Hegelian “becoming” rather than Aristotelian “being.” Maintaining appearances, though, the opening two chords, now rounded out with a third—heroic, enlightened, positivistic—return to end the movement.\n\nBut that’s not where the symphony ends; and even though the concert is over, its work is no less incomplete. Let us close with a passage from an interview with composer, improvisor, computer musician, scholar George Lewis, quoted in in Aaron Cassidy and Aaron Einbond’s Noise In And As Music:\n\n[I]n his 1999 book Culture on the Margins, historian Jon Cruz points out, the trickster function of noise as “sound out of order. It evades, eludes, spills out of, or flows over, the preferred channels—out of place, resistant to capture.” In that sense, the pretense to control becomes exposed as quixotic; noise and noises routinely overflow the banks of propriety, resisting and unleashing. People hear the sound and say, “no one told me it could be like that; I wonder what else they haven’t told me.” Or they say, “wow, that music is really different”; once they start down that road, thoughts inevitably turn to what else might need to be different.\n\nSo when we want change, in the memorable phrase of the rap group Public Enemy, we “bring the noise”—in Egypt, Tunisia, Montreal, or elsewhere. The improvised, spontaneous, seemingly leaderless nature of these and other protests reminds us of the primary remit of new music and new noises: to declare that change is possible.\n\n[A version of this piece was originally published on Oct. 4, 2016, in New Music Box]\n\nI realize that there is an imbedded irony in a person who lives and works in Chicago new music making this observation, but I’ll do it anyway: it seems like people outside of Chicago talk a lot about new music in Chicago. Why is this?\n\nFrom my vantage point—the lives-here, works-here one—I want to guess at an answer by saying tentative things, stutter while I do so, and use the shrugging shoulders emoji at the end of what I say. I want to make a weak claim, not a strong one; I don’t want to assert that what is happening in Chicago is truly unique or mystically special or importantly revolutionary. I don’t have the expertise to be able to make such a claim (and, actually, a suspicion of expertise is a strain in a mode of artistic production here). What I want to hypothesize is that Chicago is a particularly concentrated expression of confluences in current culture, and that the evidence of this is both the explosive energy of the city’s new music community in recent years and also how hard its characteristics are to pin down. This essay (in both senses: “a piece of writing,” but also “try” or “effort”) is one of a number of attempts I’ve made to theorize Chicago new music, and inherent in these attempts is—as an axiomatic presupposition surely, an ever-present anxiety maybe—an awareness that I could be wrong. Going a bit further: my tendency to theorize, my hypothesizing impulse, my weak-claim-making, is a very Chicago-new-music-esque characteristic.\n\nWhat comes to mind when I describe the character of Chicago new music are words like “provisional” and “transient”and “conditional” and “contingent” and “fragmented.”\n\nA quintessential work of Chicago new music is something like George Lewis’s Assemblage, which he wrote for Ensemble Dal Niente (which I conduct) in 2013. It’s quintessential to Chicago new music because it was written for the Bowling Green New Music Festival by a Chicago-born improviser/scholar/composer/computer musician living in New York for a new music ensemble started ten years ago by a bunch of mostly students without jobs, composed in a style that references many other musics, and cast in a form that encourages the listener to “catch the bus and go along for the ride.” Thus, the city of Chicago is essential to the work’s creation, but its presence cannot be readily pointed to. The essence of its Chicago-ness, if one may say so, is the not-exactly-there-ness of Chicago. George was born in Chicago, cut his teeth as an experimental musician in the AACM, left to go elsewhere (Yale and Paris and San Diego and New York), has turned to notated composition only in relatively recent years. Ensemble Dal Niente (literally, “from nothing”) was initially a bunch of musicians—mostly from Michigan or Indiana or Texas or Georgia or Canada or Kentucky, and not too many of whom were actually born in Chicago—just trying to make stuff work because existing things didn’t satisfy. The Bowling Green New Music Festival is sort of close to Chicago I guess, kind of. “Both the title and the content of Assemblage refer to a type of visual artmaking that recombines and recontextualizes collections of natural and human-made objects,” writes George. Everything about the piece—its composer, the musicians for whom it was written, the form, its external references, the listener’s experience, the circumstances of its production—is provisional. It is the instantiation of the contingent, if such a thing isn’t a contradiction in terms.\n\n***\n\nTo be less slippery, I buy a basic Marxian approach to culture (articulated and developed by, for instance, Adorno and other Frankfurt School theorists) that “means grasping[...] forms, styles and meanings as the products of a particular history” (Terry Eagleton, Marxism and Literary Criticism (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), 2), as the results of a set of socio-economic conditions. It’s not merely that works tend to be about their place and time, or that composers consciously engage with political issues (say, the Eroica symphony or Shostakovich’s wartime works or John Adams’s On the Transmigration of Souls); it’s that every facet of culture creates the conditions for a piece of music, and this happens on many levels, including (and especially importantly) unconscious ones. We have a particular and peculiar situation in Chicago: it's a very large city—the largest in a large region—that attracts intelligent, talented young people from this region and beyond. It has famous performing and visual arts institutions with histories of being famous. But these same institutions suffer from a certain second city-ism that makes them anxious about their own prestige and causes them to look to more famous arts institutions (in other cities) for art, and thus, they have only recently started paying close attention to the local new music scene. It doesn't have many presenters, so the venue situation is often difficult. (Sure, there are a few stap"
