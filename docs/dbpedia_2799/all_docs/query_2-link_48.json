That is why some pilgrims still make that journey to Finisterra and wait at the lighthouse for the sun to set. It was also traditional for pilgrims to burn their clothes here as a way of casting off the old and starting anew. In reality they probably burned them because they were lice and bedbug ridden.\n\nTincatinker\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012\n\nNov 4, 2013\n\n#4\n\nWestern Galicia has been called the largest neolithic cemetery in europe. Its seems possible that the mortal remains of our early ancestors were brought for internment at the \"end of the world\". Ireland, Cornwall, Brittany can all make similar claims but there does seem to be something special about Galicia. There have been suggestions that Campo Stellae refers not to a field of stars but to a field of grave (markers). Certainly the pagan pilgrims will lay an ancient claim to the route to Fisterra. It seems the desire to be buried at the end of the world gripped even Santiago.\n\nvicrev\n\nActive Member\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#5\n\nThanks,Tincatinker.......Is there evidence of this ?........... ....Vicrev\n\nTumbleweed\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Frances (2013)\n\nK\n\nkarenfromcali\n\nGuest\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#7\n\nIn reality they probably burned them because they were lice and bedbug ridden.[/quote]\n\nAh, so not much has changed then!!! lol.\n\nHoulet\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Frances 2014\n\nVia de la Plata 2015\n\nCamino Sanabres 2015\n\nCamino Norde 2017\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#8\n\nEveryday is a learning experience - Thans for the backgound info.\n\nSYates\n\nCamino Fossil AD 1999, now living in Santiago de C\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFirst: Camino Francés 1999\n\n...\n\nLast: Santiago - Muxia 2019\n\nNow: http://egeria.house/\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#9\n\nI am looking for evidence for a \"pre-Christian\" Camino since months and honestly, I haven't found much ... Yes, there is evidence of ancient settlements, including cemeteries of course, Roman roads and transhumance ect but I have, yet, to come across academic proof of a \"pre-Christian\" pilgrimage on what is now the Camino de Santiago.

It was more worship (especially the sun) than pilgrimage those days. In nowadays Europe pilgrimage was/is kind of constant flow of admirers/believers to certain places that have some saints relics, on the other hand worshiping was set on exact dates during the year (equinox etc.).\n\nMaybe I'm doing a mistake here with terms \"worship\" and \"pilgrimage\" because I'm not English native speaker, sorry...\n\nI know that todays interpretation of burning the clothes or shoes at Finisterre is as symbol of casting off the old and starting anew, but maybe it came from slaying and burning animals (or humans in some cultures) in pre Christian ages???\n\nnewfydog\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nPamplona-Santiago, Le Puy- Santiago, Prague- LePuy, Menton- Toulouse, Menton- Rome, Canterbury- Lausanne, Chemin Stevenson, Voie de Vezelay\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#13\n\nThe Romans made an amazing network of well engineered roads. When the pilgrimage started, there had been little long distance travel through the dark ages, and the Roman roads were still the best routes available.\n\nHere a picture I took of them building one, and what it looked like when I returned 2100 years later.\n\nwayfarer\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012, 2013, 2014.\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#14\n\nMany many many belated Happy Birthdays newfydog.\n\nTincatinker\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#15\n\nNewfy is right in that there is little evidence of long distance travel in the dark-ages (unless you count the Golden Horde battering the gates of Vienna) but there is considerable evidence of long distance travel in Neolithic times. The Stonehenge \"Archer\" came from somewhere on the Danube, Utzi, the Italo-Austrian ice-man was a long way from home when he was slain. Flint tools from Grimes Graves in Norfolk traded to the Mediterranean. Mediterranean sea shells traded back.\n\nSome have calculated that it would have taken the entire Neolithic population of the UK to build elements of Stonehenge, with the implication that people assembled from all over Europe. And when there they made formalised journeys along processional routes; pilgrimages, maybe not. But me I'm happy in my faith that when I walked to Fisterra I was following a route of pilgrimage the history of which the mists of time have long obscured.\n\nLike SYates I've been looking for definitive evidence but there isn't a lot about. The focus of palentology has been on dna and human migration for the last couple of decades. Although some great stuff has been done and published on Stonehenge and it's evolution Most people still think the 'henge had something to do with Druidism. Though it had fallen out of use for maybe a couple of millennia before those guys came along. Fable, fact, faith and knowledge. We need a little of each in our lives I believe.\n\nwayfarer\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012, 2013, 2014.\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#16\n\nI think this is an example of when history becomes ledgend, the spoken word but nothing on paper.\n\njmcarp\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Frances, 2013\n\nCamino del Norte a Chimayó (USA), 2015\n\nCamino Portugues, 2017\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#17\n\nThis may be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know how much of the Camino as it exists today, follows (at least closely) the paths and roads taken by pilgrims in the golden age of the pilgrimage back in medieval times?\n\nJim\n\nSYates\n\nCamino Fossil AD 1999, now living in Santiago de C\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFirst: Camino Francés 1999\n\n...\n\nLast: Santiago - Muxia 2019\n\nNow: http://egeria.house/\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#18\n\nI know a bit more about that ;-) I can't give you percentages, but it is pretty clear that the Camino changed even during in the \"golden age\" its course. For example, before Santo Domingo built the bridge and pilgrims hospice in what is now Santo Domingo de la Calzada, the Camino followed another route, but as the bridge, the road and the hospice Santo Domingo build became more popular the route adapted. I remember vaguely that Alfonso VI even put out an official decree that confirmed this \"re-location\" of the route. Need to dig through my books to find out more if you are interested.\n\nAlso bear in mind that the Camino fell, nearly completely, in disuse for several centuries. As Don Elias of O Cebreiro started to paint the first yellow arrows to re-mark it, some of it had already disappeared under modern roads. A Spanish pilgrim I know, who walked the Camino the first time in the 80s, told me that for them the equivalent of the yellow arrow today was then the white line alongside the road.\n\nThere is a lot of evidence preserved in Spain what villages where on the road (sometimes changing, see above) and sometimes even the exact pilgrims road through the villages, towns and cites was preserved (sirga peregrinal, calle de Santiago ect) but between the villages? Bridges and old (Roman) roads are other hints, see Via de la Plata.\n\nI am not sure if that answers your question, but as I said, even during the Golden Age the pilgrims walked where they wanted and where they found the best support. So, in the end, the Camino is where a pilgrim walked / walks because it were and are the pilgrims that made the way. Buen Camino! SY\n\nThis may be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know how much of the Camino as it exists today, follows (at least closely) the paths and roads taken by pilgrims in the golden age of the pilgrimage back in medieval times?\n\nJim\n\nPelegrin\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2019\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#19\n\nI don't know anything about prechristian pilgrimage to Santiago. In fact my first news about it is from this forum.\n\nWhat I know about prechristian pilgrimages in Galicia is that their destinations were to places that had sacred elements, like rocks (Mount Pindo), forests (Lugo), and above all fountains (San Andrés de Teixido, Fonsagrada, etc.). People went there for healing and worship purposes. And still today, they go from all over Galicia to San Andrés to pray in its little chapel and drink water from the \"Fonte Santa\".\n\nTherefore, a posible way of research, would be to find out the presence in Santiago of one of these sacred elements. But I'm afraid that in afirmative case the pilgrimage would be more local than international.\n\nSYates\n\nCamino Fossil AD 1999, now living in Santiago de C\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFirst: Camino Francés 1999\n\n...\n\nLast: Santiago - Muxia 2019\n\nNow: http://egeria.house/\n\nNov 5, 2013\n\n#20\n\nOh San Andres de Teixido! \"va de muerto quien no fue de vivo\" (Go as a dead person / ghost, if you didn't go whilst alive.)

If you go there, make sure to find a Galician / knowledgeable person to show you around and explain things to you.

My best local example be the church of St Andrew at Alfriston in West Sussex, built on a flint walled mound of far greater age. Suggested by some to be a sacrificial mound where \"gifts\" could be offered to the river gods of the Cuckmere.

When I visited the Naranco sites I thought it must've been a fine line in the early church between Christianity and paganism, they are covered in animal and nature symbols, the only Christian imagery appears to be later additions.\n\nThe reverence of springs, fountains, Fuentes is another matter.

Fire, the Botafumerio or a bonfire of socks at the lighthouse...\n\nOoh... springs and fountains is one of my pet subjects. I've done a lot of diving in springs/fonts in France and so many of them have some form a sacred tradition to them. There is one in the north-east that has had all sorts of stuff (thought to be offerings) lifted from the mud. Most have some sort of folk tradition associated with them, home of monsters/spirits, or linked to saints or used for ceremonial bathing, etc. I dived in some springs in Mexico where you could still see offerings chucked in a thousand years ago, they were considered the entrance to Xibalba, the underworld. There is another spring in the north of England I've dived a lot and on Midsummer someone still leaves bundles of herbs and flowers at it.\n\nMy favourite is the Fosse Dionne in France, thought to have been a place of worship of Divona, a Romano-Gaulish goddess and the home of a basilisk.

The remains of the chapel dedicated to St Michael on Glastonbury Tor is another classic example of christian devotional masonry erected on an ancient site.

So too with the summer and winter solstice, in summer the sun reached its highest peak and then started to slowly wane towards the winter soltice. During the winter soltice the sun does not appear to rise any higher above the horizon for about three days the slowly starts to rise again as the seasons progress.

I remember a lot of sites in the Yucatan were aligned on the setting sun. In Scotland in the dark ages heading west was a big thing, the ancient kings were buried on Iona. Iona was the home of the first Christians but it's also one of the most westerly islands that was easily accessible, the place of the setting sun. On the other hand, Maes Howe, an underground building thought to possibly have been either a tomb or a temple, is aligned on the rising sun around the winter solstice, presumably signifying rebirth.\n\nThen there is the closing scene of the Wicker Man, filmed against the sunset and all its symbolism of death.\n\nCaplen\n\nWherever you go, there you are.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFall 2000 - Frances;\n\nSummer 2001 - Norte/Frances/Fisterra;\n\nSpring 2015 - SJPdP>Irun(GR10)>SdC((Norte)>Fisterra/Muxia\n\nNov 6, 2013\n\n#45\n\nIsn't it great to see people having a discussion, about such volatile subjects as Religion & Paganism ( what a mix) without getting all uptight & nasty !!...You people are a credit to this Forum... ..............thank you all for the information you have given me (& others).....I have lots of questions on this ,but I might wait a while & PM people ( that's if they don't mind )...... ........keep smiling........Vicrev\n\nAbsolutely!

There are no written records. The Celts have left us the remains of their civilisations but they didn't have a written language so nearly all is lost. There was a period of Roman occupation - therefore Latin and Greek - before Rome became Christian ... but it would mainly have been the invaders who used these languages. All we really know about the Druids, for instance, was written by Julius Caesar (that power-mad murdering psychopath) who rather disliked them, to say the least!\n\nSo, we can infer quite a lot from Celt and pre-Celt remains but we just cannot know.\n\nWe have found Celt remains far away from Celt lands so they were certainly travellers, as we are now.\n\nWhat we do know is that they were people, as we are people .. and what we long for they would have longed for. If we search for meaning then they would have searched for meaning. If we pilgrimage then it would be surprising if they didn't also pilgrimage.\n\nAt their gatherings they probably also discussed what footwear/backpack/waterproof coat was best for the great journey west!!\n\nOf Christianity moving into new areas and displacing the older religions - well, .. all religions adapt as they spread, adopting rites and rituals into their theology to incorporate followers of the 'previous' religion. In a sense it is like stretching a new rubber sheet over something older. At first it is all smooth, and then the older starts to push through, distorting the sheet (terrible example I know but can't think of anything better at the moment).\n\nOh for a time machine!!!\n\nLast edited: Nov 7, 2013\n\nstevenjarvis\n\nActive Member\n\nNov 7, 2013\n\n#49\n\nI am alsways delighted that Ancient Civilizations has the good sense to build their ruins near excellent transport infrastructure.\n\nSYates\n\nCamino Fossil AD 1999, now living in Santiago de C\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFirst: Camino Francés 1999\n\n...\n\nLast: Santiago - Muxia 2019\n\nNow: http://egeria.house/\n\nNov 7, 2013\n\n#51\n\nAs I was walking today my 'part-time dog' (long, unrelated story!)

For example deducting correctly that they have been used as meeting place and centres of some sort of worship. But they couldn't reconstruct much of the liturgy or the theology solely on the buildings they found. Remember - no written traces! They could conclude, as most churches are build 'east facing', that the worship there had something to do with the rising sun, not entirely wrong, but also not completely correct. Now take in account how the use of churches has changed over time, from city central meeting place to 'only open Sundays' and you see which problems our imaginative archaeologists would face if they wanted to know what happened exactly, and why, in these buildings.\n\nLike David and others said, we can deduct some things from buildings, monuments and ruins, but others will, without written records, always be a theory which might be correct or wrong, or a bit of both.\n\nSY\n\nStuartM\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Frances (2012)\n\nNov 7, 2013\n\n#52\n\nObviously the cathedral floor has been dug up, and what was found where the remains of a Roman cemetery that belonged to a Roman mansion dating back to the 1st century AD.

In Germany, for example, market rights were a privilege given to a place, town or village by either the secular and the church authority, depending on who was the ruler of the land. When, for example, the village belonged to a monastery, yes, the monastery would be the one that granted or refused permission to hold a fair or market. On the other hand if the 'right to grant market right' for that area was in the hand of a secular authority, a duke for example, he would grant or refuse it. And prior to the 12th century only the ruling king had this right in the area that is now Germany. Markets were, btw, a 'medieval invention' in Europe that happened as the christianization of Europe was mostly completed.\n\nSY\n\nRelating to the discussion of takeover of pagan sites by Christian decree...didn't the church take control of markets..making them take place on church property to help with the conversion process...town folk became Christians, people of the heath not hence heathen?\n\nSYates\n\nCamino Fossil AD 1999, now living in Santiago de C\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFirst: Camino Francés 1999\n\n...\n\nLast: Santiago - Muxia 2019\n\nNow: http://egeria.house/\n\nNov 7, 2013\n\n#58\n\nAnd just a quick opinion that it would be a good idea to stay with the original topic, see quoted text below, if we spread too wide out, things might get muddy ;-) SY\n\n... ,at times on this Forum it has been stated the pilgrims were following pre Christian tracks.........why did the pre Christians go to Santiago ?............what reason did they use any of the Camino tracks ?.....\n\nTincatinker\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012\n\nNov 7, 2013\n\n#59\n\nSo glad to see this thread still running nicely. SY's re-stating of the OP is maybe timely too. Maybe a re-visit: \"pilgrims were following pre Christian tracks\". Well sections of, say, the Pilgrims' Way in the UK certainly follow ancient chalk ridgeway tracks but only because they are there and going in the desired direction of travel. As SY has said, the Camino routes have meandered across the landscape in search of easy, safe passage and indeed as modern motorways have been built along those desirable routes the blessed pilgrim has been guided to the by-ways and quieter routes by the negotiating skills and yellow paint brushes of the amigos and associations. Those who have walked the Calzada Romana can be confident they have followed an ancient pilgrim route and indeed occasionally stepped on the very stones our forebears sandals kissed. When I walk The Ridgeway from Ivinghoe Beacon to Avebury and the other Wiltshire Henges I'm following a pre-historic \"motorway\" a trade route and drove-way and, who knows perhaps a route of pilgrimage for those making their way to the Neolithic temples that scatter the Wiltshire landscape.\n\n\"Why did the pre-christians go to Santiago\" - they probably didn't. I can't find much on the pre-history of Galicia other than dear old Wikipedia, some snippets in the Labrinthos site www.labyrinthos.net and some hard-core academic stuff, but there are no obvious direct links. They probably walked right on past, at least until the Romans started all that \"improving\" of the infrastructure. I believe the destination, if it was such, was \"World's End\", the \"Costa del Muerte\".\n\nThis thread has given me a nudge for what this winter's home-work might be though.

Before fridges and freezers were invented, salt (and smoke) where the main methods to conserve food for a longer time. So there were also very practical reasons to make a pilgrimage to the coast ;-) Plus the shore was also heaving with valuable, easy to catch, protein at that time (fish and seafood). Forget about over fishing, that wasn't a problem at all at that time! I imagine it like this:\n\nWe need to get some more salt to make sure the meat we harvested hunting stays edible over the winter.\n\nLet's go fishing also and pick up some mussels or fish in the process.\n\nOh, and isn't the sunset at the rock beautiful?

The explanation I hear often from Pagan friends goes along the lines \"The Church usurpated pagan sites of worship.\" like they did so intentionally (per decree), more likely is that allegiances changed over time, but people still used the same space, because they liked it and were used to it. So not by (Church) decree but by custom did this happen in many cases.\n\nMy comment in the thread- \"Rules and Standards on the Camino: Do they exist? Should they?\" reminded me of this thread!\n\nBack in the day, one of my tutors suggested that, because of my interest, I should write a \"paper\" on Syncretism in the Church in Britain\".

I say on my post that this point has been in discussion and introduce some toponomy in favour of that supposed \"celticity\".\n\nLast year, for family reasons, I couldn´t spend money for holidays and I didn´t know what to do with my saved money. One day I thought Why not?. So I sent my DNA (and money) to be analysed. And the outcome was (Bingo!) : Haplogroup: R-P312, Origin : Celt.\n\nSo, now in case of a discussion about the Galician celticity I can give another reason apart from the toponomy.\n\nSYates\n\nCamino Fossil AD 1999, now living in Santiago de C\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFirst: Camino Francés 1999\n\n...\n\nLast: Santiago - Muxia 2019\n\nNow: http://egeria.house/\n\nAug 26, 2016\n\n#72\n\nGalicia has bagpipes - what could be more celtic?

As both local peoples and representatives of the Church, they tend to encourage those local practices that are compatible with the faith and discourage those that aren't--sometimes with explicit advice coming from Rome and often not.\n\nFor instance, Animist worship of ancestor spirits gets re-directed to the Catholic belief in the Communion of Saints and their veneration. While the theology might be quite different, from a practical standpoint they both may result in talking to Great-Grandpa before you go to bed!\n\nDeacon Jason\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Frances (2016)\n\nCaminho Português (2023?)\n\nAug 28, 2016\n\n#75\n\nLets just agree that both approaches did/do exist ;-) Human behaviour is rarely either-or but most of the time a mixture of both.

SY's re-stating of the OP is maybe timely too. Maybe a re-visit: \"pilgrims were following pre Christian tracks\". Well sections of, say, the Pilgrims' Way in the UK certainly follow ancient chalk ridgeway tracks but only because they are there and going in the desired direction of travel. As SY has said, the Camino routes have meandered across the landscape in search of easy, safe passage and indeed as modern motorways have been built along those desirable routes the blessed pilgrim has been guided to the by-ways and quieter routes by the negotiating skills and yellow paint brushes of the amigos and associations. Those who have walked the Calzada Romana can be confident they have followed an ancient pilgrim route and indeed occasionally stepped on the very stones our forebears sandals kissed. When I walk The Ridgeway from Ivinghoe Beacon to Avebury and the other Wiltshire Henges I'm following a pre-historic \"motorway\" a trade route and drove-way and, who knows perhaps a route of pilgrimage for those making their way to the Neolithic temples that scatter the Wiltshire landscape.\n\n\"Why did the pre-christians go to Santiago\" - they probably didn't. I can't find much on the pre-history of Galicia other than dear old Wikipedia, some snippets in the Labrinthos site www.labyrinthos.net and some hard-core academic stuff, but there are no obvious direct links. They probably walked right on past, at least until the Romans started all that \"improving\" of the infrastructure. I believe the destination, if it was such, was \"World's End\", the \"Costa del Muerte\".\n\nThis thread has given me a nudge for what this winter's home-work might be though. The myth is out there...\n\nHi @Tincatinker! I know this thread is rather old already, but would you be able to share some of the \"hard-core academic stuff\" you found? I've found a lot of non-academic sources, which I had posted in this thread: https://www.caminodesantiago.me/community/threads/janus-to-venus.32261/#post-1003211\n\nWould love to read up on academic findings.\n\nAlso would appreciate some input on this subject from anyone who commented here, and @Caplen I share you concern for attitudes here.... I'm beginning to find out that suggesting there may have been journeys that pre-date the Christian Camino route is a touchy subject in this forum\n\nAbsolutely! I haven't had time to contribute the last couple of days, but I have been thoroughly enjoying reading this thread.\n\nWhen I started at this forum a couple of months ago, I was roundly spanked for making the mere suggestion of pagan influences on the Camino. I almost quit this place after less than a week. I'm so happy I stuck around, and so pleased with the positive tone and enthusiastic discussion.\n\nThanks for all the interesting input here! Can I suggest though, that the discussion not move to PM's? This is all of public interest for those inclined to click on the thread in the first place.

That is why some pilgrims still make that journey to Finisterra and wait at the lighthouse for the sun to set. It was also traditional for pilgrims to burn their clothes here as a way of casting off the old and starting anew. In reality they probably burned them because they were lice and bedbug ridden.\n\nI think this explains it perfectly. It's true Santiago as the city did not exist at the time that Celts or other ancient peoples would be at Finisterre (although archaeologist have found numerous ancient artifacts from Celtic and Roman times underneath the city of Santiago, so there seems to have been some settlements there).\n\nHowever, many pilgrims even nowadays continue to go on past Santiago to Finisterre for spiritual reasons outside of the standard of ending at the cathedral. The Celtic, Roman and Christian history in northern Spain all intersects with one another, so I think this is just as a valid of a \"Camino\" as the traditional one ending in Santiago..... I can confirm standing at cliff's edge on the Costa da Morte can really be a \"spiritual\" experience.\n\nI think the sticking point for some is then calling it a \"Camino\".... since traditionalists will only see the path ending at Santiago and at the cathedral as a \"true\" Camino.\n\ncj330\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nPrimitivo(2012); CF(2016); Norte(2023)\n\nMar 7, 2022\n\n#81\n\nStonehenge long predates the druids.\n\nOnly some Roman roads were like that -- generally, near towns and cities ; and where terrain requirements mandated it.\n\nBut most of them were dirt tracks -- though these too often involved engineering work.\n\nAFAIK it's a \"new\" tradition started by modern pilgrims (and frowned upon locally).\n\nThe tradition in the Middle Ages was to cleanse yourself at Lavacolla, and then walk into Santiago refreshed and renewed.

By definition, surely the \"Camino\" ends in Santiago, no matter what your spiritual inclination.\n\nTincatinker\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012\n\nMar 9, 2022\n\n#90\n\nCamino translates - Spanish to English - as: Way; Path; Road; Journey; Course; Trail, and a few more. So Camino is both a physical and metaphysical thing - a road and the journey along it. For me when I make my Way along the Northern and French routes to Muxia and our broken boat or to Finis Terre I am en camino and also on Pilgrimage. I am making a journey to a place sacred in my tradition.\n\nIf I walk to Santiago, if I undertake Camino de Santiago, by any of the thousand ways I am making pilgrimage to the remains of one who may have touched the divine. If I walk the \"Frances\" or the Vasco or any of the others that coincide I will always pause and give thanks to Santo Domingo, the road-builder, at his shrine. Not so much pilgrimage but with heartfelt thanks. I'll brush my hand through the nettles of the Montes de Oca, a nod to San Juan and another builder of \"the Way\".\n\nIt is my heartfelt and profound belief that \"pilgrims\" made their way west through Iberia for many reasons and for many millennia. Of course its un-provable though the Mithraic remains in and around Lugo, Boveda in particular, the Piedras de Pie found throughout but concentrated in Galicia. The high numbers of neolithic burials in Galicia https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=neolithic+burials+galicia&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart proportionate to the anticipated population all give clues, hints, suggestions of purpose and reason.\n\nSo yes, the Camino(s) de Santiago end in Santiago, hugging that statue or on your knees in front of that glittering box but Camino is just the journey we all undertake through life to wherever it is we go next.\n\nBuen Camino a todos"
