        "text": "In this chapter I present a self-reflection about my identity as an artist, focusing essentially on two points: personal identity, which certainly explains some of the choices in the composition process, and part of my work as an artist, giving a special focus to the pieces written during this project and the consequent use of elements of the traditional culture of Braga in my pieces. For this, throughout the text I react to the themes presented above, anchoring myself in these concepts and the information presented in order to make a personal reading. I will talk about identity(s), culture, tradition, among others. In my opinion, the role of an artist is never just to create a work of art, but to be active in society, thinking about it and trying to transmit his vision through his works. Therefore, I think it is also useful and interesting to present my point of view regarding Portugal and Europe. Logically, this point of view is not that of a sociologist or anthropologist, but of an artist who is aware - and seeks to sharpen awareness - of the identity and ideological visions of both Portugal and Europe. The main objective of this project has always been to demonstrate the compositional process, explaining how elements/aspects that come from some traditions of Portugal are used in the pieces I wrote.\n\nThis was the most difficult chapter to write. The exercise of writing down my ideas, reflections and opinions, was always accompanied by a fear of falling into exaggeration or arriving at an inaccurate judgement, or at least one that is dissonant with the view of others.\n\nAs I consider that the role of an artist should not be limited only to the creation or interpretation of works, I think daily about my artistic function and, thanks to this search to strengthen a more academic perspective, I have developed a more conscious work, more aware of certain details in order to better expose my ideas. In recent years, by developing my research skills (especially parameters outside the musical field), I have sought to expand a more academic vision. It has been a long, slow and painful project, but beneficial for my artistic and personal growth.\n\nMy personal identity is inevitably marked by involuntary belonging to a series of collectives: I am Portuguese, European, a supporter of Sport Lisboa e Benfica, musician, composer, conductor, student. To reflect on these different identities it was necessary to distance myself from them. Perhaps because of this, it is important to present a self-analysis, where certainly some themes will be developed in the future.\n\nI can recall a conversation with some of my housemates about my club - Sport Lisboa e Benfica - and saying that 'we were one of the greatest teams in Europe'. What followed was a question that has been massacring me in recent years: ‘We? Who? But were you playing there back then?’ This conversation has remained quite imprinted in my memory. The image about myself, being part of a bigger group - be it a 'national we' or in a bigger project like the European one, or even a 'club we' - was questioned in my years in Antwerp. The truth is that I had never thought about the issues that an 'individual being' might have in relation to that integration into a group.\n\nAlthough \"identity\" comprises several layers, and that each of us, human beings, will have various identities (depending on the situation we are in - religion, professional, as a sports fan, in the family, in different groups of friends, a. o.), my focus in this research is cultural identity issues. It is in this context that \"identity can become a marker of people's abiding in such a singular community, where the community defines an abode marking people's ways of belonging within the structured mobilities of contemporary life\"[1]. As Moura points out, we identify with some (social or cultural) groups by their set of values and goods, material and immaterial. Those are the elements that \"allow us to recognize ourselves as belonging to a nationality and at the same time to a set of civilizations\"[2].\n\nOn a personal level, one knows that our (individual) identity differs from person to person. Identity is created from the various events that one experiences throughout his or her life, thus nourishing himself or herself with memories and different episodes. We build this idea by identifying ourselves with the stories as being the same person in all the episodes. Thus, we build a feeling of continuity that corresponds to a \"self\" that is only known by each of us individually.\n\nThere is a steady element in the concept of identity, which remains unchanged over time and history. Starting from a ‘cultural identity’, it can be considered that there is also a whole part: history, established practices, traditions, and culture. These aspects are both common and shared among individuals, having different identities themselves, in constant transformation and change[3]. Identity implies the discovery of history, language and culture, and at the same time, the use of these resources in order to transform and create oneself. Therefore, identity is based on tradition, but also on its 're-creation': not as a return to the roots, but as understanding and acknowledging them.\n\nThis network of identity aspects, creating a whole identity of an individual, is also claimed by A. Malouf: “The identity of a person is not a juxtaposition of autonomous aspects; it is not a ‘patchwork’, it is a drawing on a tight skin. If you touch one aspect, it is the whole person that vibrates”[4]. Malouf also presents two directionalities of our multiple-identity. The first, horizontal, is defined by our daily life choices; the second is established by \"our heritage, including notions such as race, nation, and religion\" and is at the core of most conflicts[5].\n\nIn essence, our identity can be seen as history (or a story) that we \"build and tell about ourselves\", thus defining \"who we are for ourselves and for others\"[6]. The creation of identity is thus illusory, invented and (re)constructed subsequently.\n\nIn the arts, although individual identity has always been something sought after by creators, it has gained high importance in recent years. \"We live in a world that values individuality\"[7], notes Lima. Individuality, or the set of individual qualities, when linked to the creative process, boils down to a(n individual) search for an identity. In the arts, this search is even more valued. Our personal or professional experiences make us unique, and that must be part of the artwork created by us.\n\nThe purpose of defining and understanding the concept of \"identity\" comes precisely due to this relevance in the arts and for me as an artist. This question arises in order to understand and enhance elements of Portuguese (traditional) cultural identity in my works. As G. Cools states, the question of - cultural, gender, or even religious - identity has been present throughout the last centuries in the creation of works of art. In the creation of contemporary works of art, it continues to be “a major source for many creative practices”[8].\n\nI believe that the search for (my) identity has three reasons. First, because it is actually part of my way of being. Reflecting about myself, my choices, my faults and my qualities, what I can improve and develop as a human being and as an artist. I jokingly tell some friends and family members that I bring with me an inheritance from the Judaeo-Christian culture. I had a Christian education, following and participating for many years in catechesis and Catholic youth groups, together with the education that my parents and my family gave me. I learned, above all, the importance of doing good for the good. This influence is, in my opinion, perceptible in the music that I write. Although I am not a believer, I don't believe in a God, I believe in the power of religions as a way to get the best out of human beings. My music represents (or at least intends to represent) my religious (or maybe spiritual) vision of life and of what I feel. Music, from a spiritual point of view, is also a form of sharing. Whether in a live performance, or through recordings. It is, at the same time, a search for the \"inner self\", for my well-being and for the well-being of those around me.\n\nThe second reason is the search for personal and professional development. I try to use this awareness also because of my professional goals. In recent years I have tried to understand what I can do differently and better than what I have been doing. In my view, and succinctly, I can offer in my pieces my personal identity, not only through my own musical language, but by looking for elements that can better represent me.\n\nLastly, my coming to Belgium in 2012 led me to look at Portuguese culture in a different way. My decision to come to Antwerp to study was essentially due to the fact that I thought this move could help me grow as an artist, due to the experience of studying with composers like Wim Henderickx and Luc Van Hove with an admirable artistic career, studying in an international school like the Koninklijk Conservatorium Antwerpen, getting to know other cultures, other people and being integrated into a social environment that values art and culture. In personal terms it was a very complicated decision, and it took months for me to feel good about myself. I left family, friends and work opportunities in Portugal. As time went by, I stopped feeling lonely, away from those who had stayed in Portugal, creating in myself a physical space between Braga and Antwerp, where I feel good. Due to the fact that I was always between these two cultures, I felt like a foreigner both in Belgium and in Portugal. The fact of having left Portugal and of never having felt totally integrated in the two societies between which I wander, having to deal with the condition of \"displaced\" (even if by my own will), motivated me to re-invent myself and to deal with some identity issues that I certainly wouldn't have if I had never left Portugal[9].\n\nPortuguese\n\nestimated read time: 5 minutes\n\nThe collective identity of a nation consists of a perception of continuity between the past and the present, the result of history and the interpretations applied to it, as well as of its rituals. The calendar also affects the way we behave as a nation, leading us to repeat certain patterns of social behaviour more or less consciously. It is obvious that the collective memories and 'mental geographies' of Portugal are changing and adapting to the current condition of the country with the changes in society and the strategy of Portuguese domestic and foreign policy.\n\nBy presenting the texts \"Portugal, national identity\" and \"Elements of traditional music from Minho\" my idea was to have a starting point to talk about myself as an artist and composer, and to understand how Portuguese culture, its elements and characteristics are present in my music. My previous perception about the state of Portugal, its history and cultural and intellectual development of the country was influenced by the information I got at school, family and friends. Certainly, the research developed during this project has broadened my perception about the direction Portugal has been going, the emergence and treatment of musical elements present in the traditions over decades, and the influence these aspects have in my music.\n\nHere I quote the four complexes presented by Real (four anthropological and cultural complexes: Exemplary Origin, Superior Nation, Inferior Nation and Cultural Cannibalism). For me, my work, my music, also reacts to these complexes, in an intentional or involuntary way. Throughout my journey as a student until I was 18, I learned in History and Portuguese about many of the historical moments and artistic (mainly literary) outcomes of all these complexes over the centuries, and so these have influenced me throughout my growth and development. I don't know if this defines me as Portuguese (in reality I believe not), but they are certainly part of my artistic and critical thinking towards Portugal.\n\nThe notion of national superiority always appears in the myths linked to Portugal. Although I don't believe in destiny, i.e., I don't consider that any people or individual is predestined to something, I am aware that this vision, and the way history is presented to us while we are being formed, through the study of works by Padre António Vieira, Camões and Fernando Pessoa, sometimes leads us to dream of a Portugal that will be made and that Portugal and the Portuguese are almost mythological beings.\n\nI realise that this type of project may give the idea of a nationalist quest, but nothing could be further from the truth. Especially if we look at the nationalist issue using Orwell's view that “A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or negative nationalist - that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or denigrating - but any rate his thoughts always turn on victory, defeats, triumphs, and humiliations”[10]. My aim has never been to demonstrate the national, political or musical superiority of Portugal. Never, either throughout this project, or throughout my (artistic) life have I tried to demonstrate the superiority of Portuguese culture. As a matter of fact, from the political point of view I am strongly against nationalist and regionalist ideologies. The aim is to demonstrate the characteristics of Portuguese culture, some exclusive to Portugal, with national developments, others with links to other countries and cultures. The presentation of these elements aims to offer a better perception about the music I write and my identity.\n\nMy fear of being seen as a nationalist stems from the negative sense the word can have. “Nations and national identities are potential obstacles to international cooperation and need to be gradually superseded by a new layer of transnational rules and organizations”, argues Fukuyama[11]. I agree with this point of view, especially when one only looks, selfishly, at one's own navel. Of course, protectionism in nationalism is only one side of it. Carlos Moedas argues that an important division in political thought lies in the difference between 'protectionists' and 'internationalists'. The former \"dream of a past that never existed\", while internationalists \"dream of a future that never comes\"[12].\n\nMy project originates exactly from a position contrary to the enclosure of a culture in itself. I try to demonstrate the differences that still exist in national cultures, using them to create new pieces that express an identity of their own. On the other hand, and because I consider healthy, interesting and important to maintain the diversity of cultural elements, I develop this project, also, with the intention of demonstrating the cultural diversity present in Portugal, focusing, mainly, on the elements from Minho.\n\nIt is perhaps part of the Portuguese identity to 'leave the motherland' and, although the Portuguese have, as António Vieira wrote, 'little land to be born in', they have ' a whole world to die in'. This identity, was given - or transmitted - through the myths and stories of history. As Portuguese, we were educated, both by philosophy and by the social and economic problems that we will have to live through the world, being part of our 'Portuguese soul' the emigration and the search for new and better opportunities.\n\nFrom my perspective - and taking into account how members of my family saw life in the past -, it is \"Portuguese\" to hope for a better world ('future'), because the present was not always good. As I said a few years ago (I think it was in 2009 or 2010) to a professor at ESMAE, from the portraits that my relatives always gave me, the crisis that was coming would be nothing more than the continuation of the way they lived over the years: struggling for better days, with hope and a lot of work to live in a more comfortable way.\n\nReal also presents an \"existential model\", a pattern of the life and work of \"almost all Portuguese intellectuals\" and which he summarises in three paradigmatic moments[13]. The first moment is a \"phase of approximation, of commitment and of voluntary adaptation to or attempt to transform the general destiny of Portugal\". The second, which differs from author to author, leads the Portuguese intellectual at a certain moment in his life to a \"profound disenchantment with the conjunctural state of the country\", which leads him to two options: first, to give up transforming the Portuguese cultural panorama, leading the authors into (physical or psychological) exile, and to concentrate \"on his individual aesthetic or philosophical work\"; or to create an alternative work to the dominant social and political vision, reiterating his commitment to transform Portugal. The last moment, at the end of the author's life or after his death, his work is recovered by national institutions, valuing it as \"one of the most salient vectors of Portuguese culture, so sanctified by the new school generations as before it had been abhorred and despised by the previous ones\". Being still developing my artistic career - and still not being able to consider the third moment presented by Real-, since I started to compose (with the hope of my work being relevant to my country), I am afraid that this is the end of my artistic career. I am not exiled, I remain close to Portugal and I try to be included in the artistic life of the country and I still have the will and the hope that there will be a cultural development, but the fear of falling in the same \"destiny\" outlined by other Portuguese creators and intellectuals accompanies me.\n\nEuropean\n\nestimated read time: 13 minutes\n\nIn my opinion, an artist should, through his art, reflect and represent his time and ideals. I consider it very important that an artist understands - or at least tries to understand - the society in which he or she lives, and, in my case, I also see this as an aim. That's why I consider it essential to have concrete ideas, identifying problems and looking for solutions, also in society. I do not believe that artistic work alone will change anything, but it can be a vehicle that initiates different movements that lead to improvements. My idea of Europe (and its identity) is presented 'only' because of who I am. I am not a jurist, law maker, politician... I am an artist. An artist who thinks about Europe and who has his reading of the European identity. Yet, an artist who does not find it easy to describe his opinion, nor comfortable to promote it (his opinion) and who therefore wants to do it through art.\n\nThe European identity is based on the history and collective memory of the peoples that are part of it, influenced by existential, affective and utopian connotations, shared from a particular dynamic, of affirmation and survival. Like any identity, individual or collective, the European identity is the result of a long and ongoing process, built on a legacy of heritage elements (tangible and intangible) and also by a set of values[14].\n\nConceivably, the European identity is the result of a fusion of Greco-Roman and biblical-Christian cultures, allowing a purely geographical concept to result in an ethical concept \"that still persists today in the idea that Europe represents a higher stage resulting from the convergence of classical and Christian culture”[15]. Other major influences on this identity construction are the myths and legends transmitted over time, by the different languages and traditions, by the imaginary, both erudite and popular, and by the classical motifs[16].\n\nThe European cultural heritage, tangible or intangible, also plays an irreplaceable role for national and European identity. Cultural heritage, i.e. \"the combination of elements which enable a given group to recognise itself as the bearer of its own identity and to communicate over time, either within that group or, by marking a difference, beyond it”[17], comprises \"among many other realities in permanent interaction, works of art, monuments, religious and secular dimensions literary, scenic and musical testimonies, architectural and artistic values, aesthetic standards, erudite and popular matrixes, ideas, social values, marks and traces of past generations and their struggle for emancipation and a better life, as well as a potential of their actualisation in living meanings, which maintain or recover successive symbolic charges and fullness of meaning\"[18]. This allows us to recognise ourselves as part of a nationality and of a civilisational ensemble.\n\n‘Culture’ has different implications, allowing the integration of a person in a certain social, political, and economic system, being a central role in society by transmitting knowledge about accepted behaviours and ways of being in a certain society and giving a meaning in that social group belonging[19]. In addition, it is also through culture that values are transmitted to us. Culture thus functions as a provider of meaning, both in a formal sense and in a deeply existential sense.\n\nCulture plays an important role in European cohesion. As we saw earlier, 'culture' is constantly changing, developing and altering over time. Not only can 'culture' be seen as the basis of a society, or a way of living together, but it is also a collective form of self-knowledge, involving a continuous process of evaluating what is, or is not, necessary or important.\n\nCulture shapes human beings by developing our way of living together, but societies also transform culture through repetition, adaptation, updating, interpretation and critique, creating a continuous development in it[20].\n\nEuropean identity is also developed from individual artists who have created works on which societies (national or European as a whole) have been founded. These artists (e.g. Dante, Petrarch, Ronsard, Camões, Shakespeare and Racine), although far apart in time, were influenced by the great classical Greek and Latin models[21].\n\nAlthough the vast majority of citizens do not experience, \"either affectively or intellectually, a sense of belonging to Europe”[22], the idea of a Europe with a joint culture is a long process that began after the Second World War. This process, initiated by \"intellectual and political sectors\", was guided by \"ethical and humanist values, historical, civilisational and cultural perceptions, philosophical and political will, obeying the imperative to ensure the existence of conditions for peace between nations and the affirmation of personalism and of new social models outside totalitarian impulses\"[23].\n\nPerhaps for this reason, European identity seems to be an \"elite conception\" and is therefore a reality that is difficult to perceive, which generates some \"misunderstandings in the overall so-called 'cultural' policies and framework programmes for culture that the European Union has adopted\"[24].\n\nIn my opinion, it would be important for European policy makers to (re)think about how this culture can be nurtured, keeping it alive, as Pascal Gielen states in the book “No Culture, No Europe: On the Foundation of Politics”, “without a solid cultural policy, European politics will eventually dig its own grave”[25].\n\nThe dynamics of invention and reflexivity towards the self also seem to be European identity principles[26]. These will not be uniquely European characteristics, but they play a crucial role in the development of the project. In the words of J. Kristeva, \"there is an identity, mine, ours, but it is infinitely buildable and de-constructible\"[27]. To the question \"Who am I?\", the best answer, European, is evidently not certainty, but love for the question mark. After having been carried away by the \"dogmas of identity that led to the crimes we know, a European we is now emerging\"[28]. According to Graça Moura, one of the most important elements of the European identity is the tendency for \"Europe to reflect on itself\"[29], as \"Europe is the civilizational unit with a wide geographic perimeter that for the longest time and most profoundly questions itself, questioning not only its action but also its most relevant characteristics, that is, its own identity\"[30]. This way of being, of reflection and, in some way, of introspection, is very present in art and is perhaps one of the reasons that lead me to write a text like this one. The continuous development, research and learning in action, together with the critical correction and conservation that sometimes leads to systemic changes and revolutions is the basis of the value system and the secret of progress in Europe. The contact with other cultures, close geographically, and the European expansion itself, with all the conflicts that resulted from it, were fundamental for the existence in Europe and in Europeans of this need for a process of questioning about the past, the present and the future. The tolerance that exists in European culture is thus \"the zero degree of questioning\", which leads us to invite the other and ourselves to question, instigating \"the culture of questioning and dialogue to meetings that problematise all participants\"[31]. This way of \"living together\" guides us towards a plural identity where multilingualism and multiculturalism are key elements[32].\n\nIn order to achieve a European cultural identity (or in order to understand it), it is necessary to recognise \"a certain vision of the world that ends up being common from perspectives that do not necessarily coincide in all points\", and, therefore, to recognise the existing differences, respecting them and providing for cooperation mechanisms[33].\n\nThis diversity, for example in customs, traditions, languages and gastronomy, which can make it difficult to define a European identity, is in fact a core point of such an identity. The existing plurality of languages is the basis of cultural diversity[34] and therefore the basis of multiple specific collective identities and different world views. This diversity of languages should be seen as an inexhaustible wealth and not as a \"handicap of a purely theoretical construction”[35].\n\nThe perception of difference(s) and the recognition of the permanent contact with different cultures and traditions and the (re)knowledge of the Other are crucial for living together in this project, without falling into the trap of closed nationalism. It is this awareness of cultures that are different in some aspects that allows Europeans to coexist peacefully.\n\nThe European identity can even be based on the way the different identities that constitute it (regional, national, religious and cultural) are managed and on development in a permanent balance between unity and diversity[36], the universal and the particular, the general and the unique, the common and the individual[37]. This cultural pluralism, based on a responsibility to respect the individual and leading to the spread of the philosophy of human rights is, according to Konrád, Europe’s main innovation[38].\n\nThere are different perspectives to look at \"multiculturalism\"[39]. If we take a historical viewpoint, we may fall into a conservative position. If we look at the ethnic perspective, all Western societies can be considered \"multicultural\". If we look at the geographical space, this can call into question the whole vision of contemporary mobility. Europe, in my opinion, is multicultural because of these three visions together. Europe is a wide geographical space with an exchange of cultural elements and it is this openness to dialogue and exchange of elements that makes Europe what it is today.\n\nThis cultural diversity should, in my view, continue to exist. It would, in my opinion, be a mistake to strive for the whole continent to be the same. Despite the many differences between the cultures (or, if you like, the way of being in society, visions and traditions) of the various member states, I believe that what unites us is much stronger. And it is strengthened by the diversity (and multiculturalism) that exists. The similarity is present not only in the monetary currency we use, but also in the tolerance, defence of democracy and human rights, fight for freedom(s) and peace. And this is why it is so dangerous to fall into immediate solutions that will cause each member state to be closed in on itself. Alone. Together, as European Union, we will be better prepared to respond to each of the existing problems.\n\nIt is necessary that the \"local, national and supranational articulate without excluding each other\", allowing the different identities to converge in search of a memory enriched by what is proper and common[40].\n\nIn a perhaps utopian vision, I would say that Europe should be a land of solidarity, but this will only work if there is a notion of European unity. Especially in recent years, fears of possible European fragmentation have been felt in Europe, the result of a \"misunderstanding of memory, political history and society” [41]. This can result from a fear of what is different, of the other, in a national (or regional) egoism, to a disregard of the potentialities of society and a devaluation of memory and heritage. The only way of not fulfilling the European project in its entirety, of losing everything that has been gradually achieved, is to let this idea be lost (even if it sometimes seems vague to a member of the people) and each country think only for itself and of itself.\n\nThe times we live in today, with fears of European fragmentation for some years now, make a work like this even more important, in my opinion.\n\nThe dialogue-based role of Europe, an objective pursued after the Second World War and which resulted in the principle of the European Union[42], was at the origin of the transformation from a constant state of war to the present moment of internal peace, and has sustained the longest period of development and prosperity ever experienced here. \"Europe\" today, can mean a continent, an idea or a culture[43]. Its elements (historical, cultural, psychological and emotional) offer a conformity to the ideals present in the project and are a set of assets that influence peace.\n\nEuropean unity is still a work in progress, starting from the use of the common currency and the Schengen agreement by many of the Union's Member States, without forgetting the various nationalities present, their traditions and the relations between each of the members with their neighbours (whether they are members of the Union or outside the project)[44].\n\nEurope as a mobile space should be part of our consciousness as citizens of this Union (and, of course, of this geographical area), and its mobility should be defended, supported and seen as a point of interest. This is another very important feature of European culture, not only in terms of free movement, but in opening up to other (financial and labour) markets, opportunities for study and constant exchanges of information.\n\nThe dynamics of travelling in Europe, the mobility within the Schengen area with all the flux we have seen in recent years, facilitates the creation of a pluri-ethnic or multicultural European social space. Also the Erasmus Programme (and Erasmus+), the main EU programme for education and teaching, aiming at \"increasing skills and employability\", have brought a dynamic and exchange of lessons and experiences[45]. European mobility allowed me to leave Portugal in 2012 to study in Belgium. In other times, and with other conditions, this would never have happened.\n\nThe European project must, in my view, be strengthened whenever it encounters crises - economic, social and cultural - such as those that have appeared in the last decade (financial crisis, terrorist attacks and rise of populism). In my opinion, the European Union as a project is a beginning of a good utopia. The coordination of efforts between all the countries that are part of it has brought us, in my opinion, very positive changes. One of the most important has been the use of dialogue and negotiation, which has created an EU without internal (warlike) wars. This construction has been carried out step by step, creating bases that have been covered, so that they can support the growth of a European Union strengthened in itself and in the world, consolidating the political, economic and social space.\n\nAnd if it is true that sometimes I think we are getting closer and closer to making the European utopia a reality, every now and then the real reality - not the one we hope for, but the one that actually happens - shows us that we are still a long way from reaching the point where countries protect each other, act together and look to the future as one.\n\nThe European project should be seen as a 'long run', a slow, thought-out, safe development. A search for the welfare of all, and hopefully a slow but joint growth. A joint and well-planned vision is therefore needed, and patience so that the project can develop and, who knows, complete itself.\n\nThe complexity of the European Union means that it must be built on several layers. It is true that the European institutions carry great weight, but it will be necessary that citizens feel included and regional entities also engage in dialogue. Cooperation between these entities will strengthen the Union, creating the social and geographical cohesion necessary for everything to function properly. Regarding ordinary citizens, it is important that they feel that the EU is not just a set of buildings in Brussels or Strasbourg, but part of a joint society, with solidarity, with an ideal of the future.\n\nIn the political context, the role of the President of the European Council and the President of the European Parliament seem to have little relevance for the populations of the nations that are part of the EU. Perhaps the only figure who still has a symbolic capital, but still with little dynamic and effectiveness for the populations, is the President of the European Commission[46]. The \"ordinary\" European is, in general, distanced from the decisions taken by the bodies of the European Union, either through their own will, lack of collective vision or lack of information. For example, in the last European elections in 2019, Portugal had an abstention rate of 69.3%[47], which demonstrates, among other things, the remoteness of the population's decision making when it comes to European political decisions. But the feeling of belonging to a (apparently) not very united Europe like ours is also due to the fact that there is no \"hope\" (on the part of Europeans, more precisely the people) in the European project. As long as there is \"us\" vs \"them\" it will always be like this. Europe's path should be that of justice between countries and the creation of a European culture, of group identity, through unifying laws and the demonstration of a positive currency, as well as the demonstration of unity during crises. When all is well, it is easy to believe in projects. For this project to be robust, it is necessary to show unity in the most complicated moments.\n\nIt is true that not everything in Europe is positive and there is much room for improvement. The financial inequality between the populations of each country and between the various countries, the combat against corruption and terrorism, the threat of nationalist ideas. In any case, the main problems for the near future in this Union will be migratory pressure, globalisation (the way we look at it), climate change, demography and youth unemployment. We therefore need a cohesive, balanced EU that offers solidarity to its citizens. The European Union must be based on three political projects: the economic, political and cultural project[48].\n\nWe must bear in mind that one of the main threats to this European project (apart from the known problems of economic and social crises) is the manipulation of the truth and the irresponsibility (or incompetence) of part of the political class, which has a populist and selfish vision of the \"common good\", using it for their personal interests. In my opinion the fears that have arrived with Brexit and the questions raised almost daily thanks to the growth of a nationalist vision in each country, make us fear that the EU is not strengthened enough to protect itself. I think that Europe, united, is stronger than the image conveyed.\n\nEurope must be an ideal. An ideal of peace, equality, freedom[49], with a strong ecological vision, with confidence in scientific progress. Fair. That is why the effort to move forward, to develop an increasingly fair and egalitarian Europe (in terms of living conditions, not customs), has to be daily. And since nothing that has been achieved in the last six decades can be taken for granted, the effort not to go backwards will also have to exist, by thinking and rethinking European steps and policies.\n\nIn Between\n\nestimated read time: 2 minutes\n\nSibony, as presented here, defines identity as “a ‘movement in-between’, ‘an open process’ in which one has to integrate the ‘stranger’ and ‘the event of otherness as well as oneself’”[50]. Sibony also presents the distinction between identity ‘in-between’ and the concept of ‘difference’, the latter being “a static division, marked by a borderline and symbolized by a trait”, a “simplistic polarity between the sexes, between religions and cultures, between life and death, between have and have-nots, between good and bad” [51]. This concept of \"in-between\", presented by Sibony, is associated with the notion of “a shared but unstable ‘origin’” [52]. Our origins are points of departure shared with others and are therefore not fixed points in time or space. Thus, our identity is created by the journey we undertake, always influenced by the world(s) around us, like a “pilgrim” (Bauman) or “wayfarer” (Ingold): someone who is continuously and continuously moving, gathering his or her knowledge throughout the journey[53].\n\nThis sensation of being nomadic, “being rootless of living between worlds” is one of the characteristics of the (post) modern World[54]. To be honest, I don't consider myself rootless, but part of several different cultures, certainly thanks to the ease of travelling and being connected at the same time with the different cultures in which I insert myself due to the current technologies. My own experience as a “migrating body”[55] grows with the daily living between the Portuguese culture and my journey and certainly has a lot of influence on the final result of this project.\n\nThis nomadic character and the relationship between two different cultures (despite some similarities) are very present in my work. The nomadic character I refer to includes the fact that, at this moment, I don't really know where my home is. Maybe this feeling is connected to the fact that \"once you have gone through the experience of uprooting yourself, you will never fully settle again”[56]. From an emotional point of view, home will be where me and my family are. But if we have in mind the artistic or cultural character, I'm not sure where I stand. As I will present later, traditional Portuguese elements are very present in my music, but my artistic and academic life is much more linked to a vast \"western\" (in contrast to eastern) or European context than exactly Portuguese.\n\nPerhaps this transformation, and this search to belong to two different cultures, made me understand \"being European\" and, perhaps more than understanding, made me want to be part of that way of being, coming from one country, living in another, but trying to find common points (or bridges) to accept myself and to feel accepted.\n\nIn this regard, I am also the result of a certain nomadism existing in European culture: \"being a nomadic European subject means to be in transit between different identity formations, but, at the same time, being sufficiently anchored to a historical position to accept responsibility for it”[57]. I belong to a generation that was born after the fall of the Berlin wall, I grew up in a Portugal already part of the European Union, with the existence of a Schengen area and I have few memories of my life before the use of the single currency (euro). Therefore, I cannot see myself 'only' as Portuguese, but as part of a globalized and cooperative Europe, where the distance seems smaller due to all the (digital) tools we can use, as well as all the existing means of communication and transport.\n\nGlobalisation\n\nestimated read time: 4 minutes\n\nThe term globalisation, “a set of social processes that are thought to transform our present social condition into a condition of globality”, suggests “a kind of dynamism that is best captured by the notion of ‘development’ or ‘unfolding of events’ according to discernible patterns”[58].\n\nGlobalisation is a set of several dimensions of social processes, originated by worldwide social exchanges that \"create, multiply, extend and intensify interdependencies”[59]. This process, which is not uniform and results in different influences on the transformation of social and cultural structures, also leads to societies having a \"growing awareness of ever deeper connections between the local and the distant” [60].\n\n‘Globalization’ includes not only the acceleration of social interactions but also the understanding and intensified awareness of the world as a whole, which comes from the \"ever diminishing importance of geographical borders and distances”[61]. The experiences of global interdependence, daily and gradually change people's individual and collective identity, strongly influencing their way of acting in the world[62]. In this way, globalisation \"involves the creation of new social networks and activities that increasingly transcend traditional political, economic, cultural and geographical boundaries, and the multiplication of those that already exist”[63].\n\nThe technological developments that have occurred in recent decades, have helped to create a particular form of globalisation[64]. Thus, globalization is also largely based on the notion that the amount and speed of movement of goods, capital, and people - not only in their social role as “labour” but also as tourists, scientists and intellectuals working together across borders and oceans, artists, and in a variety of other roles - is now so great that it has completely changed the world. Moreover, this transition can be seen in a whole new set of institutions or the reform of existing institutions to better serve a specific purpose[65].\n\nA result of globalisation, cultural homogenisation can be seen in modern architecture, clothing, fast food, popular music, hotels, among many other things. They are the result of a worldview that seeks neutrality, where “Everybody is basically the same”[66]. This desire to \"neutralize difference\" is present in the Western world, arising from a fear of difference that intersects with the economy of global consumer culture.\n\nGlobalisation can have both positive and negative aspects[67]. For some, the process of globalisation is based on mutual respect and bringing different societies together for peaceful purposes, based on sharing and a certain degree of fusion of cultures. For others, globalisation is a nullification of traditional and local cultures, losing the unique elements of each society.\n\nGlobalism exists in the smallest things, from the fact that I can use the computer on which I am writing this text, to the way I disseminate my work or collaborate with others, and also in the options we have in our daily lives (such as, for example, going out to dinner in an Asian restaurant or another American food chain, watching English football or even the ease with which I can order a book from another country). These may not be globalisation per se but they are undoubtedly the result of the development of a global world.\n\nIt has been this global exchange of lifestyles, of ideas, of \"cultures\", if you will, that has also allowed a development of the way of living and, consequently, of the works of art (from music to literature, passing through the visual arts, inspiring us (the creators) in various ways).\n\nAs information technologies have developed over the last 20 years, they have increased in importance, allowing, among other things, communication between geographically distant individuals. Social networks, and the ease of obtaining information at the click of a mouse, can expand knowledge.\n\nIt allowed me, despite being in Belgium, to follow news in a faster and more accessible way from my family, friends and to be aware of events in Braga. One such example was following the “Queima do Home”. The first time I watched this event was in 2016, through facebook, while I was at my home in Antwerp developing ideas for the piece \"home(m)\", where I use elements of this Braga tradition. This way of being close, despite being so far away (approximately 1800 km away), allowed me to have a different view of the event - which I would only attend in loco the year afterwards.\n\nI am very influenced by the world at the moment I write a piece and so each piece has a final result depending, also, on outside factors. Living in Belgium, I am still aware of what is happening in Portugal and I try to be aware of what is happening culturally in other countries like Italy, Germany, England or the United States. In other words, my world, the world in which I live every day, is influenced by all these issues that are happening in different geographical locations. So, even though I live in Belgium, a certain political event in Portugal or in France (or somewhere else), a sporting event (another of my main focuses on a daily basis), or even a terrorist attack (for example during the composition of “and they still seek the traces of blood”), end up having more influence than my daily life in Antwerp. And this is perhaps due to globalisation, the fact that I can be in several places “at the same time”.\n\nThrough my work (including this project), I represent a search for the existing cultural difference. This work is therefore also a reaction to the existing globalisation and the expansion of global cultural flows, not in disagreement with them, but in order to demonstrate different elements present in the culture of the city where I was born and grew up until I was 18 - and to which I will always be connected.\n\nMy identity as an artist\n\nestimated read time: 10 minutes\n\nEver since I started composing with the aim of becoming my job (i.e. not as a hobby), different people around me - family, friends or acquaintances - have asked me why I write music. I write music for different reasons. For me, composing is a mental, intellectual exercise of search for an identity (not only musical), which aims at sharing with others (the interpreters, the audience). Thus, and although the ‘outside’ influences what I write - the ‘outside’ can be the news, the speed of life, the landscapes, the people I come across - my compositional process is essentially an inner search.\n\nFirst, I write to express myself, to share experiences and the world(s) I create. Some pieces have a more factual basis, while others start from a purely speculative principle (such as “where the shadows are so deep” (for ensemble, 2019) and “i [w]ill meet you by the sea” (for solo trumpet, 2018)), but they always represent my feelings, expectations and fears. But this sharing is only meaningful to me if there is an audience (in rooms or online) to share it with. The pieces I write are not personal diaries. In my pieces, I try to present a personal, inner vision of the world I observe, interpreting it and creating an artistic artefact that represents my musical identity but at the same time serves the listeners or viewers to find themselves in the music they listen to. My music also represents my constant state of mind, between Braga and Antwerp. Maybe that is also why I search in traditional elements my identity as a composer and artist (root to route).\n\nSecondly, I pursue the goal of bringing (\"classical\") music to more people. I believe that anyone, if given the necessary support and guidance, can listen to, understand and appreciate classical music. Since the early days when I started to compose, I have tried to explain, to the people around me, the music I make and listen to. I confess that I didn't always achieve the goal of making them understand contemporary music, but I am happy to think that my attempt to show them something \"new\" and \"different\" (from their perspective) resulted in a greater openness to other kinds of sounds. I remember that some of these people, who had never had a musical education, later talked about albums of music they discovered in search of different sonorities.\n\nAnd it is on those listeners that I think - those who for whatever reason did not have the opportunity to learn or appreciate \"art music\" - when, in some works created for amateur musicians, like, for example, \"Benedictus\" and \"braga: à [b]olta do s. joão\" I use some elements that might be more peculiar in the works together with others that make the work more accessible. In \"Benedictus\", I looked, among other things, for more dissonant intervals - for instance, the final note does not resolve - and in \"braga: à [b]olta do s. joão\", besides the dissonances used, I looked for different approaches throughout the piece - from the use of an object that all the interpreters knew from St. John's festival (the hammer), to the use of the \"banda\" as a choral group.\n\nAnother of my reasons for composing is the search for development as a human being and as an artist. Artistic development also encompasses a search for progress in classical music. Nothing I create is totally new, and I seek information from different artists and composers and hope that my work can influence other colleagues in the future. I like to look at what exists and develop it in other ways. For example, when I discover a technique for any instrument, I try to develop it, creating a piece in which that particular technique is fundamental and essential in the resulting sound of that piece, without it being used only as a sound “ornament”. This constant challenge of development (either personal or in art) has a great weight in my compositional process.\n\nMy music is the result of my life’s path: of my roots, of my experience and of continuous learning, with all the influences that surround me. The changes I have suffered over the last ten years, the scars that are part of my body[68], are the result of all the road (“route”) I travel. These psychological “scars” (being far away, fear, death and loss, and paying homage to those around me), are also constantly represented in my music. Thus, it was essential for me that this internal research was part of this project, so that I could make my choices more conscious and also transmit to the reader my vision and reading of what I have been developing.\n\nFinally, I write music to pay homage. In the last few years, and much thanks to this project where I also tried to understand my identity as a composer, I have realised that most of the works I write are homages to someone and a reaction to the memory. As Sobral says in the book “Portugal, Portugueses: a Identidade Nacional”, memory is not “a simple restitution of the past in the present, but a reconstruction of the former from the present”[69]. And it is with that memory that I consciously work. My work thus results in a tribute to my memories (which include my experiences and traditions, as well as those of my ancestors).\n\nThe memory of moments or stories, which help us in creating our identity and that of others around us, is done selectively. We tell these stories over and over again to demonstrate what we are and to explain what we are to others. The act of remembering is always built, deconstructed and transformed, as our memory is subjective[70]. Sharing memories, a collaborative process, is also an essential part of creating an identity. When one seeks to remember something as a group, these memories are created by each of the participants, thus adding a common narrative to the group members, sometimes slightly modifying the initial individual memory. As explained by Cools, “already in the moment of experiencing through the senses, the memory takes apart factual experience and reassembles it by stressing certain parts and forgetting others, by reordering them according to a logic that seems appropriate and makes sense to the self that remembers” [71].\n\nIn my pieces, I try to represent some of my “autobiographical memories” but also aspects of “historical memory”. Perhaps I use these memories and homages because I am afraid of losing something, or of forgetting and because I think that these moments demonstrate my growth (or development) over time.\n\nAutobiographical memory is the recall of experiences and events that we have personally had in the past[72]. Autobiographical memory tends to fade over time unless it is periodically reinforced through interactions with people with whom one has previously shared experiences[73]. If there is a long period of time during which we have had no contact with a specific set of once significant others, the memory of them tends to fade. In such cases, given the long intervals of time, the memory may be completely lost unless it is brought to awareness again through contact with associations almost otherwise forgotten.\n\nEach stage of our lives is preserved in our memories, which are continuously recreated. Through these memories, as through continuous relations, a sense of our identity is maintained[74]. However, because these memories are repetitions, they lose the form and appearance they had before.\n\nIn relation to historical memory, the person does not remember the events directly and is stimulated indirectly through commemorative and festive occasions or through reading or hearing about the event. Here, the past is stored and interpreted by social institutions[75].\n\nCollective memory is a socially constructed notion, existing in each group and institution of a society (social classes, families, associations, corporations, armies and unions). These collective memories have been constructed over time by the members of these groups or institutions, all have distinct memories that their members have constructed, often over long periods of time. Halbwachs claims that every collective memory “requires the support of a group delimited in space and time”[76].\n\nPersonal identity is nourished by memories of different episodes in our lives. This also happens in music. We could say that composing is recreating our memory, using more or less conscious influences in the production of new music.\n\nAs I have stated previously, in each of my pieces I try to demonstrate - ‘simulate’ - part of my life experiences, my personal visions and emotions. I try to make the piece a ‘simulacrum’ of the ‘struggle’ I have when writing the piece, be that technical, emotional or other kinds of ‘struggle’. My homages are a result of this.\n\nInitially, the use of traditional elements in my music was done in order to pay homage to my memory and my roots. For me, the search for an identity is not only linked to the present, to who I am, but also to my past (my roots and path). I try to pay tribute to the city where I was born, Braga, and its people, presenting the traditions of the city and developing the elements present in them.\n\nIn fact, I have been thinking of my work (my compositions) as a result of various homages: in “homenagem a um fugidio”, “nyMpheas”, “pranto”, among many others. These homages are, very often, connected to a “pain”, “loneliness” and my fears guide me in the writing of some pieces. Perhaps with the exception of the pieces where I use the influences of the Braga's St. John (“ensaio para um s. joão” and “braga: à [b]olta do s. joão”), as those start from the influence of a festive event, of colourful and joyful traditions, all my pieces have in themselves a visible presence of the elements firstly mentioned. Due to the influence of everything I have lived through in the last ten years - from all the fears of leaving Portugal, losing friends and family who passed away or merely left (some of them in an abrupt and painful way) my life, the death of my father (whose last months of life I followed, at his side, almost non-stop), the challenges related to the development of this project (like, for example, the great difficulty in getting a grant) and the nervousness resulting from feeling that the project did not develop at the speed I expected, or even the fact of feeling that my career is less developed than I would like - a dark, sad side is present in my music.\n\nTherefore, I could not talk about my music without presenting some pieces I have been writing over the last few years, for less positive reasons. I know that these pieces have no connection with the project itself (regarding the treatment of elements present in social celebrations in Braga), but they represent a very important part of who I am, and of what I have been living in all these years. As I mentioned, all the events that happened in the last years forced me to a search for my identity (or finding out who I am). In a certain way, this search has worked almost as a therapy, which helps me to overcome the crises I have been feeling. Not only as a composer/artist but as a person. These were, for various reasons, as I explained in the introduction of this document, difficult years that had as the darkest point of my life the death of my father. The pieces “where the shadows are so deep”, “pranto”, “[a]void”, “was birgst du so bang dein Gesicht?”, and “sei que estou só”, written after my father’s death, are the result of that search. It was a difficult search. It was, above all, a difficult search to show. It is not always easy to show the more personal, private side in music. And also, it is not always easy to create something so personal but that works well artistically.\n\nOther examples of pieces where I pay homage and mourn (besides the ones mentioned above), are “sa·lo·mão, ou a inquieta procura do eu” and “pranto”. “sa·lo·mão, ou a inquieta procura do eu” was written during the summer of 2017, when there was already some fear about my father’s health condition. This piece was a commission, where I was asked to write a piece based on one of José Saramago's works. I chose “A viagem do elefante” (“The Elephant's Journey”), a book I had read the year it was published (2008), and which I reread in 2017 because I myself was on a journey in search of answers. In the piece, I took some sentences from the book and worked the text in order to present my own journey.\n\nIn “pranto” (2019), for example, the piece starts from a poem I wrote to ‘talk’ with my father. I think that in that piece for bass clarinet, voice and electronics, the pain I felt at that moment is well represented and, I confess, that the whole process of creating the piece, from the first ideas for the text and music, through the performance at Casa da Música and the recording of the piece for CD, was a huge help for the mourning to be (at least in part) done.\n\nThese are just examples. Each of the pieces had its own context.\n\nList of works written in the past years NOT linked to this PhD:\n\n“diz tu por mim, silêncio”, for ensemble (2022)\n\n“gaivota”, for ensemble (2022)\n\n“Benedictus”, for choir and string orchestra (2019)\n\n“pranto”, for clarinet, voice and electronics (2019)\n\n“was birgst du so bang dein Gesicht?”, for string orchestra (2019)\n\n“sei que estou só”, for choir (2019)\n\n“where the shadows are so deep”, for ensemble (2019)\n\n“[a]void”, for violin, saxophone and piano (2019)\n\n“Benedictus”, for choir and chamber orchestra (2018)\n\n“i [w]ill meet you by the sea”, for trumpet solo (2018)\n\n“quatro poeMas”, for clarinet solo (2017)\n\n“a geada matou os narcisos”, acousmatic piece (2017)\n\n“sa.lo.mão, ou a inquieta procura do eu”, for ensemble (2017)\n\nPortuguese composer\n\nestimated read time: 3 minutes\n\nFernando Lopes-Graça, Portuguese composer, musicologist and conductor, wrote in “A música Portuguesa e os seus problemas I” about the difficulty in establishing the essential criteria for the definition of ‘Portuguese music’. Lopes-Graça inquires if the criterion should be ethnic, aesthetic, ethnographic or nationalistic, or if this concept should seek to “include in a generic unity all and any musical manifestations, as soon as they are signed by Portuguese authors?”[77]. The author claims that the “fact that any work is written by a Portuguese author is not enough to categorize it as Portuguese, in the only, in the unmistakable sense that the expression carries - its superior sense, which is the truly valid, appropriate and absolute sense: the aesthetic sense” [78]. This would be an interesting vision if it wasn't practically impossible to achieve since Portuguese music doesn't have a common aesthetic. Nevertheless, we can look at the influence of Portugal and its sounds, as another step to aspire for Portuguese music. This project of mine was born, in a certain way, from this search, and so I have been trying to understand in what way Portuguese culture, society and the soundscapes that result from it, can be the stimulus for contemporary musical creation.\n\nThe important works throughout the history of music, despite representing a personal and individual vision (mainly since the 19th century), are the fruit of a more or less long process of collective elaboration, starting from technique and in the search to express the prevailing cultural ideas and, therefore, the state of society. These are the works that influence the national schools (in the sense of an existing sonority). Thus, the main national traditions in music have always departed mostly from a personality or an important group of composers who lived together in the same period. Each one of the great classical schools (German, French and Italian) has, as a result of this process, a defined aesthetic.\n\nHowever, Portuguese music, perhaps because it did not have a defined aesthetic, always had the influence of the main European aesthetic currents, mainly the German, Italian or French schools. João Domingos Bontempo (1775-1842), Freitas Branco (1890-1955) and Lopes-Graça himself (1906-1994) are examples of this, having been influenced by German, French and Bartok's folkloristic aesthetics respectively.\n\nWith no clear aesthetic in Portuguese art music, it is hard work to define it that way. Thus, I believe that the only possibility to define \"Portuguese music\" is the nationality of its creators, not having an inherent aesthetic value to the definition. Anyway, with globalization and the consequent (very fast) exchange of information, it is increasingly difficult to make a clear regional (or national) division of artistic languages - and, in fact, perhaps it is not even relevant that this happens.\n\nIn fact, Portuguese music is still influenced by what is done in Germany, Austria, France, Italy and England. Young Portuguese composers like Nuno Costa, Igor C. Silva, Francisco Fontes or Pedro Lima, to name but a few, have been studying outside Portugal (Belgium, Italy, The Netherlands, England, Germany and France) and are therefore influenced by different aesthetics. Thus, Portuguese works - or, to put it another way, works written by Portuguese authors - may not indicate any Portuguese value in them, as their composers are influenced by different cultures and aesthetics.\n\nIn any case, the “Portuguese music”, more than being written by Portuguese people or following a collective aesthetic (still inexistent, in my opinion), can represent Portuguese society and its sonority through its sound elements. With this I am not defending the sound representation of Portugal, of a “rural people” that only exists in certain parts of the country, but of society itself, with the normal influences that any society has.\n\nThis search for a Portuguese sonority can, in my opinion, be done in two ways. First, through the influence of soundscapes, whether current or in the memory of the composer. Secondly, through specific timbres, which can be integrated in those soundscapes, such as, for example, the characteristic timbre of some instruments.\n\nMy thoughts about an ‘art work’\n\nestimated read time: 13 minutes\n\nIn this part of the text I do not seek to explain the meaning of \"art\", due to the complexity and subjectivity of its definition - which is changeable over time, individually and collectively -, but to demonstrate what I believe a work of art should contain or, in other words, what I look for in the art I create.\n\nIn my opinion, there are four factors that make an artistic object more interesting: 1) the planning and thought behind the work; 2) the composer's technical work; 3) representation of identity as composer and musician; 4) subjectivity for the listener.\n\nFirst, an artwork must be thought out, planned. My vision of art may be related to the idea of art as something cultured, cultivated. And then you may ask me: if it is like that, why not use another word like, for instance, culture or some more specific aesthetic definition? Culture, as I wrote earlier, has a vast amount of definitions, so it seems short to me to use the word to define ‘simply’ something that is created with the aim that one can admire. On the other hand, the aesthetic question, in my opinion, does not arise. A pop/rock/punk/hip-hop album, etc, etc, can and should be considered art - in its ‘highest’ definition, linked to the point of view of technical, musical and artistic development.\n\nI have some concern that this view of art sounds a bit old and 'romantic', but it is also a reaction to what I have observed since I started composing and thinking about these issues. In any European language there is certainly enough vocabulary to choose the right names for each object. So when I call something an 'artistic object', what I am looking for is a thoughtful object, with an intellectual basis and with the aim of presenting something technically well developed.\n\nIn my opinion, a work of art of excellence must have a process of searching and reflection during its creation process. The type of research of the composer during the compositional process can be ‘just’ that of discovering and developing new sonorities. It doesn't have to be a discovery essentially new for humanity (or for the arts), it can of course be ‘just’ a personal discovery for the artist. As a composer I try not to fall into a routine of using a recipe over and over again. It is important for me to look for something new, a constant development, adding to that a search for an artistic identity of my own, since I see the work of a composer as a process of overcoming and constant development. This identity can be achieved through new sounds, or new views on existing sounds, harmonic, rhythmic or melodic development, or even in orchestration.\n\nThe form of a piece is therefore very important to me. A work of art must be thought out, structured. The creation of a form does not have to happen at the beginning of the compositional process (which is what I tend to do), but there must be at the end of that creative process - that is, before a work is presented to musicians and public as a final result - a perception of the form and this must have a logic in itself. From masterclasses and talks I had with, for example, Clara Iannotta, Francesco Filidei and Nuno Costa, I realised that many composers (including these three) do not often start the compositional process thinking about the form. Most of the times, at least in the last years, they write in a continuous, linear way, and they go on revising the work until they are satisfied with the final result. Thus, and despite not planning the form in the beginning, they maintain a musical and artistic thought in relation to the form, starting from an organic writing and consolidating it throughout the composition.\n\nThe second factor that makes an artistic object more interesting is the development, through the technical work of the composer during the process of composition. It is undeniable that art is subjective, but there are always elements that can be analysed to understand the quality of a work.\n\nNot always - or almost never - the first idea one has is the best. Not always the way one arrives at that idea, or the result of that idea, is the best. It is necessary to think a piece through, review it, work on the elements, the details, building a more solid and more interesting work. I give the example of the orchestration of an idea: for some decades now, the orchestration of an idea has progressively been more than just the choice of which instrument would play a certain note. There are many more choices to be made when choosing which instrument should play a note. Articulation techniques, different dynamics in different registers of the instrument, techniques where the \"air\" is used (wind instruments), different tensions (on strings).\n\nTherefore, the most important aspect for me in the creation of a work of art is not the artistic inspiration (whatever it may be), but, on the other hand, the result of that inspiration and of the work of those who create, that is, the process of composition. I value very much the process of creation of a work of art (and even if we think of an improvisation, the process of creation exists - although it is presented in a more immediate way, i.e. there is no temporal distance between the creation and the presentation in public, but, certainly, there is a technical development used during the improvisation).\n\nThus, an artist must present in his work, also, his/her side of “craftsman” (in two senses). The difference between art and craft, besides the great difference between their agents - who in art are “professional artists from a mere speck of the population, whereas craftsmanship extends to all sorts of labors”[79] - seems to be that the “artist” focuses on the creation of unique or at least distinctive works, while the practice of craft is more anonymous, collective and continuous[80]. Nevertheless, Senett argues that we should be wary of this distinction, since originality is also a social label and has its origin in the Greek word poesis, which Plato, among others, used to designate “something where before there was nothing”[81]. Thus, “originality” is a marker of time and signals the sudden appearance of something where before there was nothing, and “because something suddenly comes into existence, it arouses in us emotions of wonder and awe”[82]. The term developed, leading to the connotation used in the Renaissance where the appearance of something “was connected to the art - the genius, if you will - of an individual” [83]. Despite this, we can assume that there is no art without “craft”, as an undeveloped idea of an art object is not art in itself[84].\n\nAccording to Sennett, “the craftsmanship” is still present in everyday society, constituting “an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake” and exploring the dimensions of “skill, commitment, and judgment in a particular way”[85]. The \"good craftsman\" establishes a dialogue between \"concrete practices and thinking\" that develops into “sustaining habits, and these habits establish a rhythm between problem solving and problem finding” [86]. In my work I identify some characteristics of a “good craftsman” in the sense that I seek “the desire to do a job well for its own sake” [87]. First, following the point of view of autonomy, where “original artist may have had less autonomy, be more dependent on uncomprehending or willful power, and so be more vulnerable, than were the body of craftsmen”[88]. Second, through valorisation “on contingency and constraint”, but avoiding pursuing “a problem relentlessly to the point that it becomes perfectly self-contained”[89]. Third, by making the piece and the work dependent on curiosity, tempering obsession, seeking “the value of experience understood as a craft”[90].\n\nAlthough I use quite rational compositional processes, I seek for my music to have a final result that I consider to be of artistic and musical interest. The rational processes are only tools to achieve the writing of the pieces and never a final goal of the pieces. My works have a thought, an idea, but are developed using some skills, and techniques, that can grow into a piece of art.\n\nThe third factor is the representation in a work of art of the artist's identity that creates it. In my opinion, there should be a personal, individual search in the work created, seeking an identity of its own - one that encompasses any of the artist's identity elements. These elements can be of various kinds. My identity can be present in various ways, either from the traditional elements of my homeland (as in the pieces present in this project), or by expressing something I experienced when writing the work, or by my ideologies. As a listener, when I listen to a work of art, that is what I expect to find. An object that represents the creator artist.\n\nFrom an individual point of view, a work of art is a reflection of the artist who creates it, thus representing not only the artist himself, but also the moment in which he lives - either on a personal level or in community.\n\nIn this way, a work of art can be seen as a lens into a particular culture. Each work of art is a door that can lead us to better understand a certain culture. The analysis of Beethoven's work, for example, relating it also to political events of the time, are a way to better understand what was happening in society at the time. In this way, a work of art created today will have a possible political and sociological reading in the future, either in an understanding in relation to the composer as an individual, or as a part of a society in motion. Therefore, in my opinion, a composer should not only be seen as an individual who writes a piece of music. The role of an artist is also to think about society and to bring society (even if it is only a personal vision) into his work.\n\nA work of art may, or may not, be beautiful, but it must represent the (artistic, or in this case musical) idea of the composer. It should express the world, or worlds, inner and outer to the artist. That is also what I look for in my pieces. If my world is not a paradise with unicorns and rainbows (and I'm glad it isn't!), why should I represent that 'world' in my music. Of course I could represent it as a form of desire, to present in musical form the dream of life I might wish to have. But this is not my way of being, and life has given me more pain than exactly tranquil moments of laughing happiness - and there is no harm in that, “it is what it is”.\n\nThus, art aims to make us reflect on life, contributing to our (self)consciousness and identity, through imitation and representation of society (or life) “in the form of a lived experience”[91]. Art “contributes to our awareness and self-awareness and with that to our self-image and identity. (...) as such, art is one of the most important forms of cultural awareness we have, and it is the form that affects us most directly, precisely because it comes with and through an experience”[92].\n\nDifferent artists, in different periods of history, have sought a more beautiful, more interesting or more real art.\n\nThis search for personal development in each of the works is an inheritance I have from music creation, mainly since the 19th century (mainly with Beethoven) and where the personal cult of the composer started to acquire more prominence. Following Shils’ definition of tradition, there are two traditions that have an enormous weight in the art I create: the folk tradition and the tradition (or canon) of western classical music (or “art music”). As Shils says, “no imagination is so free as to be able to contrive something wholly new, comprehensive, and detailed”[93].\n\nWe live in a society greatly influenced by the past. Greek and Latin antiquity, the Judeo-Christian teachings, influenced by Germanic, Slavic and Muslim traditions (and others, of course), all of European history and development are still present in European and world culture[94]. In the arts, and more specifically in music, we observe a great importance of the sharing of musical traditions, techniques and ideas, among others, since prehistoric times[95].\n\nThese same influences are present in my education, in my way of being and thinking, and therefore present in the music I write. These influences may not be perceptible to a less attentive listener, and are often complicated for me to explain. But whether in a conscious or unconscious way, influences are part of my compositional process.\n\nOn an artistic level, my music is the result of a European development. I am constantly influenced by European composers, from the beginning of the 14th century to the present day. I am aware that without the work of the composers who preceded me, my works would not have the same value. Except for Takemitsu and Piazzolla, two extra-European composers (although they both had a great bond with European music), all the composers that inspire me are European (from Beethoven, Brahms and Mahler, to Vasques-Dias, Saariaho, Henderickx, Iannotta, Costa, among many, many others).\n\nI am aware that I do not create anything new, from scratch. My music is the development, from my point of view and with my own musical language, of what other composers in the past have developed. The past is an unavoidable starting point for my actions. I am aware that much of what I do is due to what other composers have created in the past. Not only regarding the use of elements of popular culture in my music (since Haydn, (and much earlier), Brahms, to give just two examples), but also the classical tradition of written music, or if we want to call it “classical music”. Regarding aesthetics, and although over the last 15 years some of my pieces have followed different aesthetics, I'm aware that everything I have done has been developed from others. Nothing is created from scratch. My influences - often unconsciously for me in the process of composing - are easily noticeable. Although the creative work “forces” or “leads” me to find other (sometimes new) ways of developing the music in the piece I write, I am aware that what I do is a development of what has been done in the past. I am part of a music history influenced by itself, developed in itself. Nothing from the beginning of individual musical creation is completely new. It comes about through a development of the creative thought of others. And, in my view, it could not be otherwise.\n\nThis perception of being developing a work that follows a tradition leads me to analyse art as being in constant development. Few elements are invented again, and the great composers of European (or Western) classical music have a very big impact on my way of thinking and developing new works. I see works of art as creations which are based on the reaction to society and other created works (either from one composer or comparing different composers).\n\nFollowing the idea of the continuous development of art, a new work of art has in itself (‘stores’, has in its musical or artistic content) properties of past works of art. However, it must also offer new properties, a search for sounds and ideas that are a development of what has been done. A work of art must innovate - and here, the innovation can be in relation to the artist himself, or, in the most brilliant composers, innovations for music in general.\n\nFourth, and last factor, it is important that a work of art has some inherent space for subjectivity, so that those who do not know the composer, his personal life, his path, can appreciate the work, creating their personal connections to it.\n\nThat is why, when I write a musical work, I seek to communicate with those who will listen to or watch the pieces. I can hardly understand that an artist would not seek this, since a work will only have full value if it is interpreted and presented. If the purpose of the creation is that it be done and kept in a drawer, the artefact (or the result of the work) ceases to be artistic and becomes merely a study in technical development. Despite this, and because it is extremely important for me that the public appreciates and enjoys the music I write, I do not have this acceptance (or evaluation) as a permanent objective. The appreciation of a musical work of art can be as complex as is the person who listens to it. It is, for me, logical that the knowledge one acquires interferes with the way a work is heard or analysed (even if \"analysed\" in an aural way, in a concert). It interests me more that I am satisfied with the works I write, as well as the evaluation of some of my peers (those whom I trust to criticize based on the technique used, imagination and musical search).\n\nWhen I write new pieces, I always have as a goal that the audience hears the pieces involved in the little world I create in them[96]. Although it is not central to the understanding of my pieces - since I consider individual freedom in the perception of a work important, opening the way for personal imagination - I consider it very important to know their background in order to understand as best as possible my artistic thinking behind them.\n\nI like the idea of a piece being able to speak for itself and be understood by each listener in a personal way. The pieces all have a personal point of view, an individual \"world\". This world, heard by me, in loco, worked on technically and artistically afterwards, is also presented with personal filters that are sometimes difficult for me to describe.\n\nIn summary: for me, a work of art should reflect the creativity, technical skills and talent of the creator, and at the same time give space for the listener to receive it with some subjectivity, also making it their own.\n\nMy influences\n\nestimated read time: 5 minutes\n\nSince I first started composing, when I was about 15 years old, I tried to listen to several composers who were building the history of European music throughout the 20th century, from the members of the second school of Vienna (Schoenberg, Berg and Webern), to Várese, Cage, Stockhausen, Ligeti, and later Berio, Takemitsu, Boulez, Saariaho, among many, many others. Although I started to compose in the 21st century, I have been learning with the great composers of the 20th century, through the disciplines of “Práticas Musicais” (at ESMAE) where we analyse and write music in the style of different composers or languages (French Music of the beginning of the 20th century, B. Bartok, second school of Vienna, J. Cage, spectralism, among many others), but also by my personal taste.\n\nI realize that this can still be heard in my music - although I have other influences, influences of pieces and composers already from the 21st century. From the second school of Vienna I still use, in my compositional process (usually more in the moment I called “pre-composition”), methods of melodic and rhythmic treatment that I develop throughout the composition. From Várese (and others), I started the search for a use of the sounds that surround me in my daily life, by thinking them and transforming them into musical elements of the pieces. In this way, the musique concrète of Pierre Schaeffer and other composers also had a significant influence.\n\nMy individual search, in all the works I write, is driven by the will to continue to develop what other composers have presented, expanding and seeking other points of view from the work of those same composers. Stockhausen wrote that “there have always been different kinds of artists: those who were mainly mirrors of their time, and then a very few who had a visionary power, (...) those who were able to announce the next stage in the development of mankind, really listen into the future, and through their work prepare the people for what was to come”[97]. In fact, I believe there is a third group of composers. Besides those who are a mirror of their time and who 'take advantage' of the creation of the 'visionaries', developing elements that the former created, trying to represent the world as they live it and the 'visionaries' who try to discover how music will sound in the future, 'forcing' music to have new visions, I believe there is still a type of composers who are always behind their time, suggesting with their music that the 'world' sounds the same as it did in the past. I see myself in the first type of artists, being influenced by society and the current political and cultural situation. Also my way of seeing the musical and artistic elements in my pieces and of developing them falls in that first category presented by Stockhausen. I try to develop techniques (whether instrumental or compositional) that already exist and that the first group of composers created or developed, giving them a more personal point of view in their treatment. So I don't consider myself as a composer who creates something completely new. I see myself as a composer who develops, in a personal way, processes, ideas and elements that have been used over the last centuries, seeking an identity of my own in my music. In a certain way, each piece itself works through memory. Each new idea results from the previous idea, either by development or as a reaction.\n\nI am also influenced by various types of music, from contemporary “classical” music, “old” classical music, jazz, hip-hop, pop, traditional music, among many other genres that I hear in my daily life. Some are more present than others, but I try to include - sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously - these different genres of music.\n\nPerhaps the pieces where the elements of music (non-classical) that I heard during the process of composition are more easily perceptible are: “¡SchoL!” where I tried to use some elements of Jazz that I heard at the time (I remember some classes where Wim Henderickx and I analysed the drums of some jazz standards), as well as elements (mainly in the pitch) of “Nem às paredes confesso”; “biLhete”, where I use the piano introduction of the song “Bilhete” by Ivan Lins (in the version with António Zambujo), as a harmonic base and as a point of arrival; “do lume que pesa”, where I used in the last part of the piece the harmonies and melodies, although in a worked form, not so perceptible to the inattentive ear, from the song “A gente vai continuar” by Jorge Palma. When I started composing “do lume que pesa”, I thought of using a slow melody in the second part, which would represent my mourning. During the process of composition, I changed the idea to a melody that could express “hope”. So, I used, in a crafted way, on the piano, a melody by the Portuguese composer/singer Jorge Palma. I used \"A gente vai continuar\" because of the lyrics that the song has, especially the part of the chorus: “Enquanto houver estrada p’ra andar A gente vai continuar” (\"While there is a road to walk, we will keep going). The piano plays a “reduction” of the melody, while the strings play until bar 157, two chords of the song's harmony. Finally, the electronics came from the sound work of a piano improvisation based on this song and the reduction made for this piece. For a detailed presentation please click here.\n\nAs an artist, I have realized exactly that my way of perceiving my work, the art I create and even the way of standing in the music scene, is influenced by the ways in which those around me have taught me to be and to behold this environment. According to Lima, this influence - which I have received in an unconsciously way, and which remained unconscious until some time ago - is due to the fact that ideas which guide our lives are “largely socially constructed shared by people of the same social class or generation”[98]. I certainly would not be where I am if I was not in constant artistic exchange with colleagues and friends. I have no doubt that the people I've learnt most from over the last 10 years are the people around me, who have been teaching me so much - and who I also hope will learn something from me. From projects, rehearsals or just making plans with other artists for the near or distant future, as in the cases of the collaborations with Antwerpen Camerata, Frederic Cardoso, the project \"A Geada matou os Narcisos\" with Teatro 0, among others, to lunches, snacks or dinners with colleagues and friends - Nuno Costa, Bruno Ferreira, Igor C. Silva, Paolo Galli, Nils van der Plancken - and, of course, also by the constant conversations with Mafalda, in all these moments I was learning and shaping some ideas and thoughts that brought me here.\n\nMy process of composition\n\nestimated read time: 7 minutes\n\nThere are three main stages in my composition process: 1) \"pre-composition\"; 2) development; 3) revisions.\n\nThe first, \"pre-composition\" (the name I give here just to simplify the explanation), is perhaps the most important part of my compositional process. This is the moment where I search and collect all the information that I expect to use in the piece, from the choice of instruments, formal ideas, timbres, rhythmic, harmonic, musical gestures. In short, this is where I define how I want the piece to sound and also how the instrumentalist or instrumental group (be it ensemble or orchestra) looks and acts on stage. The latter is not done with the intention of creating a theatrical performance, but it helps me understand what feeling I want to have as listener/ spectator, because I believe that the way a piece is presented can offer another perspective to the audience.\n\nThis is a crucial moment of the composition process for me, where I seek and later define what the artistic purpose of the piece is, which elements will be more important to develop later. There are many elements that I consider important and these can vary from piece to piece. In the music I write, silence, rests, long notes, rhythms that complement each other, the ways in which harmonies are formed and interact with each other, and the way I deal with tension(s) in the pieces, all these are fundamental aspects (or elements).\n\nAll these elements lead me to try to imagine how I would like the piece to sound and, from there, some ideas emerge and are developed in another moment of the compositional process. It is here that I start to develop the idea of what I want to express in the piece, some musical ideas (often vague, like musical gestures, little melodies, rhythmic ideas) and also the temporal and formal planning of the piece. All this happens from different brainstormings, often at home, but other times in travels, visiting museums or even in concerts.\n\nOn commissioned works, I seek that the person who commissioned the piece feels represented in it. So I do some research about the instrumentalist or the group, trying to understand what kind of aesthetics they normally interpret, understanding what kind of elements (musical or sonorous) are more adequate to the idea of the person who commissioned the piece. In this phase, I always organise some informal meetings where I exchange some ideas with the person who commissioned the pieces. Frequently, commissions come with specific requests, like, for instance, having some relation with a piece by another composer (as it happened in “was birgst du so bang dein Gesicht”, with connections to the quartet “Der Tod und das Mädchen” by F. Schubert), with texts (like in “diz tu por mim, silêncio”, where I was asked to use a poem by José Saramago, for the commemoration of the writer's centenary), or even to an event (like in “braga: à [b]olta do s. joão”, where I was asked to use elements from Braga's Festival of St. John in the piece). It is also at this stage that I do research on elements related to the idea I start to develop, doing exhaustive research related to the request. In “was birgst du so bang dein Gesicht”, the research led me to the poem “Erlkönig” by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, from which I took the quote that gives the title of the piece.\n\nAfter organising the instrumentation, I study the sound possibilities of the instruments I am going to use, focusing on the sonic world I have previously defined.\n\nEspecially in this stage of “pre-composition”, I always carry one or more notebooks. I do this not because I'm waiting for ‘inspiration’ to come, but to always have at hand where to write down the ideas resulting from those “brainstormings” that I do or that I'm mentally constructing. Sometimes they are just words, or sentences, written ideas. Other times they are drawings (tension graphs or showing the movement of the elements by the instruments). Other times they are the first musical ideas that, at a later stage, I develop.\n\nIn addition to this, there is also the formal work of the piece. One of the first steps in my compositional process is the development of a form for the piece, which leads to the construction of a narrative, that I develop later. Although each piece has a different form, I always use the same calculations, multiplying the total seconds by the golden ration (0.618) - see image on the left. The result of these calculations are used in different ways depending on the piece.\n\nIn my composition process I often use some graphics to experiment or organize some ideas. Initially, I create some graphics with loose ideas, a kind of preview of the ideas I have at the beginning of the creative process. In a second phase, I create graphics (which I usually call the \"map of the piece\") where I organize the form of the piece. Here, I usually organize the initial ideas, with the seconds of each part, and create a tension chart. At this stage, the piece is usually already roughly structured, although I always leave some room for the form or duration of each part of the piece to change. The tension graph can be a demonstration of the dynamics to be used, but also the type of gestures, speed (time of the piece, but also of the micro-rhythms of that moment), number of instruments playing at that moment (in the case of works with a larger instrumentation), among other details that can guide me throughout the composition process. During the process of composition I'm writing in this \"map\" different ideas (or changes) that I'm doing to the work.\n\nAnother example of drawings I use as part of the creation process is the movement of musical elements through the instrumentation. In the process of composition, I think about the image, organise it, plan the paths I take during the piece and, in the end, write the music that represents them. So I use drawings to mediate between these traditional elements and adapt the music I make. It's my way of translating one into the other. In \"ensaio para um s. joão\", in order to look for the movement of people, I created a drawing where I planned the movements of the musical motif. In this case, the drawing was fundamental for me to achieve the \"chaos\" of the movement of people at the party, creating the “controlled chaos” that I wanted. These movements are sound, and are not a performative (visual) act.\n\nIn one of the classes I had the opportunity to attend at the \"2021 Darmstadt Summer Course\", the Israeli American composer Chaya Czernowin told me that she understood that my way of composing was somehow about translating the visual into music, i.e. that I had a kind of frame/painting/image in my head and would translate that into music, and that it was perceived that my pieces were thought out from the beginning, as if “there was a map”. When I finished the class with Czernowin I was really impressed with her analysis. I felt like I had walked out of a psychology appointment or something. Her words were completely spot on.\n\nIn the second part of my creative process, I develop the pre-established and chosen ideas. This is the moment when I write on the score, always with paper and pen. This part of the process varies from piece to piece, even if the methodologies used are similar or have been developed from previous pieces. This is where I develop the gestures, melodies and harmonies and where I work on the orchestration of the sound. Depending on the form of the piece (or the narrative), a sound element may be orchestrated differently. In “do lume que pesa”, for example, I developed the sound of the matracas and the ‘fire’ in different ways. Each of the 5 instrumentalists uses in the performance two matracas, one small and one big, but the resulting sound is worked on the instruments in different ways. Some examples of this work can be seen: 1) in the voice part that each player will have to interpret, and where I ask them to whisper \"ru\" and \"r\" (bar 12-14, for example); 2) in the flute playing at the same time a trill between two notes, trill in the embouchure (half-open<->closed), while producing with throat and tongue the sound \"gr\" (bars 21 and 22); 3) in the strings, through different forms of overpressure with increasing pressure bars 25 and 26), in pianissimo (bars 34 and 35), or playing behind the bridge (bars 29 and 30); 4) on the piano through the repetition of high notes (bars 16 and 17, and bars 50-52, the latter in a developed form) or with glissando on keys, without pressing the keys and, therefore, not producing the sound of the piano strings (bars 30-34). The sound of flames is developed through the use of key-clicks in the clarinet (bars 15-17) and in the flute (bars 32-33), circular bowing in the violin (bar 17), guiro-movement in the violin and cello (bars 59 and 60) and in the voice part, through the production of “s”. For further understanding of these examples, see The use of elements of Braga’s Holy Week in “do lume que pesa”.\n\nIn my compositional process there is also some space for intuition as a tool to develop the elements. This \"intuition\" is perhaps an influence from the exterior, not conscious.\n\nThe last part of my compositional process consists in transcribing the score to the computer, and then revising what has been written, after moments of reading the piece, briefly observing and reviewing the final result, with room for some changes.\n\nThe use of Portuguese traditional elements\n\nestimated read time: 10 minutes\n\nMy compositional process is essentially the same whether I use traditional elements or not. I believe that this would be a particular characteristic of my work. The use of those elements only influences the writing of the work in the treatment of those elements, but not the general process of composition. This happens because, for me, the development of the musical elements is influenced by their characteristics, which means that each element also has its own specificity when it comes to its development. For me, no element is “sacred” - in the sense that it is not a “sin” or a “crime” to use, develop, translate or deconstruct it. In relation to traditional elements, perhaps this is because of the way I see tradition itself.\n\nWhen speaking about “traditional culture”, there is a certain bias of seeing it as synonymous with \"archaic and obsolete\" due to the existing view that “modern Western societies” had about others[99]. My view on “tradition” is different, and I look only at its basic definition. Tradition is something that is passed on. It can be archaic or obsolete, or it can be developed. It can be rural, but also urban. It can be local or more globalised. But it must have been passed on, from generation to generation and, of course, accepted by the people who follow it, and be part of the present.\n\nIt is not always easy to understand when something becomes a tradition. A tradition need"
