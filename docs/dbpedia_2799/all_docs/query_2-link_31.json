Michelin-starred MICHAEL MINA, Michael's flagship restaurant in the heart of San Francisco, represents the culmination of his core culinary philosophies, Middle Eastern heritage, lauded chronicles as a chef and restaurateur, and personal character.

Under the auspices of MINA Group, he has opened over 40 operations including ARCADIA in San Jose; BARDOT BRASSERIE in Las Vegas; BOURBON STEAK in DC, Glendale, Miami, Nashville, Orange County, Santa Clara, and Scottsdale; BOURBON PUB and MICHAEL MINA's TAILGATE in Santa Clara; CAL MARE in Los Angeles and Springfield; CLOCK BAR in San Francisco; INTERNATIONAL SMOKE in San Francisco, Houston, Aventura, and San Diego; LOCALE MARKET and FARMTABLE CUCINA in St Petersburg, Florida; MARGEAUX BRASSERIE and PETIT MARGEAUX in Chicago; MICHAEL MINA in San Francisco and Las Vegas; MINA BRASSERIE in Dubai; MINA'S FISH HOUSE in Oahu; PABU in San Francisco and Boston; PIZZA & BURGER in Miami Beach; PUB 1842 in Las Vegas; RN74 in Seattle; STRIPSTEAK in Las Vegas, Miami Beach and Waikiki; THE HANDLE BAR in Jackson Hole; THE RAMEN BAR in SanFrancisco; THE STREET: A MICHAEL MINA SOCIAL HOUSE in Waikiki, and TRAILBLAZER TAVERN in San Francisco.

If you take the time to treat the ingredients, we are lucky enough to use with respect from start to finish, I honestly feel the guest can taste the difference.\"\n\nHailing from a small community of commercial salmon fishermen in South Central Alaska, Executive Chef Sara Garrant happily brings her background directly to the Bourbon Steak kitchen with a dynamic focus on fresh, local ingredients through a tight-knit, respectful team atmosphere. After beginning her culinary journey at Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts in Ottawa, Chef Garrant showcased her talents at various esteemed Valley restaurants as well as becoming Chef de Partie at the Fairmont Grand Del Mar before joining Bourbon Steak Scottsdale. She then moved to Miami Beach, where she became the Senior Sous Chef at Fountainebleau Michael Mina 74, until her heart led her to return and claim her current role as Executive Chef at Bourbon Steak in Scottsdale. Chef Garrant aspires to serve guests with memorable dining experiences worth returning for time and time again.\n\nMaki Pottenger\n\nLead Sommelière\n\n\"Wherever you are, be all there.\"\n\nMaki began her career at the Ritz Carlton Dove Mountain in Tucson, AZ in 2011. During her time at CORE Kitchen & Wine Bar, Maki held the positions of Server Assistant, Food Runner, and Server. In 2014 she moved North to Scottsdale and worked for a year at the JW Marriott Camelback Inn as a Server before she joined Mina Group and the team at Bourbon Steak in December 2015. In December 2016 Maki moved out to San Francisco, CA and joined PABU by Michael Mina as the Lead Captain. She returned to us in March of 2018 and was most recently studying under Jason Caballero as the Assistant Sommelier. In her new role Maki will lead the wine program and continue to elevate the Bourbon Steak experience for our guests. Maki holds a degree from Pima Community College in Tucson, AZ and was certified by the Court of Master Sommeliers in 2018."
