        "text": "History\n\nBlack Media Works, Inc., launched this station as WJFP on January 15, 1995.[1] Under Black Media Works, the station broadcast urban gospel music in the mornings and midday, with hip hop, R&B and urban contemporary music in the afternoons through late night. There was also a Sunday night block of specialty programs for the region's Haitian community.[2] The original studios, a former bail bondsman's office in a converted house on Orange Avenue,[1] until the owners wished to use it for their business again, at which time WJFP relocated across Fort Pierce to a site on US 1.[3] Translators were also built to expand the station's signal to key areas with large Black and Haitian populations.\n\nIn August 2021, Indian River State College announced it had reached a deal to purchase WJFP and its Clewiston satellite WJCB to provide a second frequency and split NPR news/talk and classical music programming in the Fort Pierce area. On September 14, 2021, the final live show aired, the Drive Time Show with Jumpin' Joe, with guests on air and by phone including now-former station owner and president of Black Media Works Kim Kassis (Special K), DJ One Shot, Shaneiac, Melan from the T-Babby Radio Show, DJ T-Black, a few of the pastors from WJFP, and others. The final song on the show was \"We Are The World,\" by USA For Africa.\n\nOn September 14, 2021, by 6:00 p.m., the live online stream was taken down and the translators in Brevard County on 94.3 FM and 93.9 FM had gone silent. The next day, music continued to play through the night with R&B, hip hop, pop, disco, oldies, jazz, and some Christian music, switching to gospel music from 5:00 a.m. until the final song aired just before 8:00 a.m.\n\nOn September 15 at 8:00 a.m., classic hits 88.9 HD3 \"The River\" began simulcasting on 91.1 and 88.5 temporarily until the new services launched with new call letters on September 28. The programming on WQJS is heard in Fort Pierce on the HD2 subchannel of WQCS.[4]\n\nThe purchase of the two stations by Indian River State College was consummated on September 27, 2021, at a price of $950,000."
