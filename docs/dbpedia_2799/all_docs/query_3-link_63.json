[as published] The _ commission would se-rve as a memorial to Mr MacKay as well as help rid the New - South Wales Rive?-ina town of its image of drugs and corruption. The town will = close down on 7 April to show Australia that it is a united and happy place and not the crime ridden drug capiLal some have claimed it to be. The f;ght to clear the town's name is being led by the Griffith Chamber of Commerce but the money - for the citizens' crime comanisaion would come from an Australia-wide appeal by the Apex movement. The NSW Attorney General, Mr Walker, said he did not see what the setting up of a citizens' crime investigation committee cruld do. \"There - has already been a Royal Commission (the Woodward Commission) and the police are _ still investigating. Citizens are entitled to do what they like within the law, _ but iï¿½ the Royal Commission didn't get to the bottom of it and the police are still investigating, I do not see what a citizens' committee can do\", he said. Mr Walker denied reports that a new Federal Royal Commission would soon be announced to investigate the Mackay disappearance, the death of Mr Frank Nugan, one of the partners in ttie faiied Nugan Hand Bank, and the link between the deaths of Douglas and Isobel Wilson and the 'Mr Asia' drug ring.

Bates, director of narcotics of Austral3.a, at the police headquarters in Kebayoran Baru. Mr Bates had participated in a conference on narco- ; tics held in Manila and sponsored by Interpol and thereaï¿½ter in conferences of ASEAN ' drug experts meeting in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and in Vienna, Austria. Material ob- tained at these conferences formed the agenda for the exchange of information on drug problems with police officials in Indonesia. The pol.ice chief said the drug problem must be taken in hand early and continuously _ before it is too 12te as lias been the case ir_ a number of countries. Indonesia's _ experience shows that driig abuse has not been a serir,us problem in the past 10 years although it is an increasing one at present. However, the f igures for drug abuse _ have not yet reached the danp,er point. The police chief said drug abuse probably is rising because many cases arei unreportEd and there ls a sfioï¿½rtage of facilities in the police force and in other agencies for treatment and rehabilitation. In3onesian police use lectures in schools, information in the mass media and on rad.io and television, an3 f ilms on drug victims as a means of prevention. Indonesian judges who have observed the criminal laboratory in Mabak and whc viewed films on drLg victims are aware that those who perpetrate the crimes of smuggling - and distributing drugs should receive sentences that fit the crime. Mr Beni L. Bates said that figures on drug abuse in Australia continue to rise and this is of great concern to the Australian government, Every attempt has tieen made to control the abuse, smuggling, trade, and distribution of drugs. Australia has 300 police and special off.icials who are experts on the types and qualities of drugs. Both sides admitted that drug crimes were most complex because they are supported by well run criminal organizati.ons. Mr Bates said international cooperation is needed to control drug crimes including smuggling, trade, distribution, and use. - 6804 CSO: 5300/8328 - APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400010003-3 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400010003-3 = INDONESIA BRIEFS MORPHINE ARRESTS--Police Lt Col A.

Then on 25 January two other indigenous persons, the lirothers S bin A and L bin A, were arrested for holding 11.5 grans of morphine crystals.

There were also maiiy who watched private showings of the film with a morbid desire, more or less like people who . go to a funeral to see the face of the dead person. - I viewed the filrn as a journalist and left angry. I do not deny the rElative value - oi so;iie accusations and certain evidence shown in that television program. It would be foolish to deny it. As a journalist, I know that drug traffic e::ists in the country. You, as readers of the newspapers, know tha.t there is coc-aine Lraf- Pic in the country, mainly destined for the United States. i~mat is cl;;verly t'orc-otten in the fiLn is that drug traffi3 requires sellers and buyers. This famous film only shows, in bits and pieces, the activity of the sellers. UJhy did it hide the buyers on J.S. soil? A large quantity of the drug reaches the United :3tates. ThP cocaine is not sold on the retail market by Boli- _ vi_ans standirig next to hotdog stands or in the doors of discotheques or drugstores.

All the federal officials detai-led tothis port are accused of committing extortion involving millions against individuals who were er:gaged in drug trafficking in the past. A concrete instance is that of Ramon Guzman Villarreal, who was abducted by several federal auxiliary agents, as well as actual agents, who extorted over 1 million pesos for his release. Identified among the federal agents who participated in this misdemeanor was Raul Velazquez Castillo, as well as several auxiliary officers of the State Judicial Police, and Luciano Rodriguez Robledo, an aide of the prosecutor Martinez Cerda, and identified as a murderous felon, who is now being held in one of the rooms of - the E1 Rio Motel. Guzman Villarreal`s relatives had requested the intervention of coordinator Carlos - Aguilar Garza to obtain his release. However, their appeals were not heeded and ' they were forced to have recourse to the federal prosecutors Nicolas Cerda Martinez, Porfirio Barragan Rizo Villon, and the federal group chief, as well as Comdr Jose Siordia Jimenez. Unfortunately for them, all the federal officials based in this town refused to inter- vene in the case; an3 hence they opted to seek the intervention of the governor of Nuevo Leon, Alfonso Martinez Dominguez, who, after learning the aforementioned facts, held a telephone conference with the attorney general of justice of the nation, Oscar Flores Sanchez, and requested his aid in clearing up the natter. At the request of the governor of the state of Nuevo Leon, the attorney general assigned for this purpose Ricardo Tapia Salas, special prosecutor of the Office - of Attorney General of the Republic, who has been in Nuevo Leon since Monday _ conducting the pertinent investigation. 38 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400010003-3 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400010003-3 It was also reported, unofficially, that Tapia Salas had already subjected the _ coordinator, as well as all the prosecutore and several of the agents implicated in the extortion case,to an investigation.

Without the authority of a legal nature, much less a fully executive order, the then head of crime prevention and social rehabilitation, Enrique Duran Cruces, assumed authority that he did not have to authori.ze and order the drug trafficker's transfer from the jail in th.is town to that in Miguel Aleman. Martinez Cerda reported: \"The federal jurisdiction and the territoriality of the pertinent district judge were invaded, because the prisoner was not even at the dis- posal of the federal executive entity nor the state entity; and th2refore, there was no reason to assiime the authority for allowing his transfer to another jail, since - he was at the complete disposal of the second district court.\" Until the appeal filed by the convicted individual abainst the prison sentence imposed on him was resolved, Efren Gonzalez should have remained in the La Loma jail, pending the authorization of his transfer by Cayetano Hernandez Valencia, head of the court in which the case was being tried. 40 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400010003-3 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02108: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400010003-3 Efren Gonzalez Olivares, alias \"E1 Menso,\" member of a powerful ring of drug traffick- - ers that had been operating in Miguel Aleman and Reynosa, was arrested in early Janu- _ ary 1980, while in the company of customs guard Rolando Garcia Hinojosa, with whom he was carrying a shipment of marihuana which they had just picked up at a farm4 ' \"E1 Menso\" was subsequently given a jail sentence of l years and 3 months for mari- _ huana possession.
