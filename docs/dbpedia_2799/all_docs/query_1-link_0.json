(7/29)\n\nIn a release today, National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) says it strongly opposes performance tax legislation. The NRB expressed concern with an announcement by Rep. Mel Watt (D-NC) that he intends to introduce performance tax legislation that would place a new and unwarranted burden on many Christian radio broadcasters. Performance tax legislation would be a crushing blow to many Christian radio stations, asserted Dr. Frank Wright, President & CEO of NRB. Moreover, I respectfully suggest to Rep. Watt that such legislation is fundamentally flawed as it rests on the faulty premise that all the value in radio airplay of music flows to broadcasters  an assumption refuted by reason and experience.\n\nMusicians receive free airplay by radio, boosting recognition and sales of their work. However, advertisers, sponsors, and program syndicators pay for placement on radio because of the substantive benefits they receive from over-the-air (OTA) carriage. The demonstrable value of radio airtime is ignored by many advocates of a new OTA performance tax. Dr. Wright continued, NRB would welcome a more coordinated collaboration with Christian music artists in order to both preserve Christian radio and to benefit the music of those artists.\n\nNRB supports a bipartisan bill, the Local Radio Freedom Act, sponsored by Rep. Michael Conaway (R-TX) and Rep. Gene Green (D-TX) in the House and Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) in the Senate. The bill (H.Con.Res.16/S.Con.Res.6) opposes any new performance fee, tax, royalty, or other charge relating to the public performance of sound recordings on a local radio station for broadcasting sound recordings over-the-air, or on any business for such public performance of sound recordings, and it has attracted the support of 143 Representatives and 11 Senators thus far.
