        "text": "Lauree Austin\n\nMidday Talent, K-LOVE\n\n< MOMENTUM HOST >\n\nEven though Lauree is originally from Boring, Oregon, she has lived and traveled to over 50 countries and is always excited to discover a new city, a new culture and a new expression of God’s amazing creation! She flew all the way to Iceland for just 12 hours.\n\nHer first radio job (‘job’ might be generous, it wasn’t paid) was when she was 19 years old at a YWAM school in Northern Ireland.\n\nLauree loves adventures and has had some crazy ones in her life: tour manager for Tony Hawk and So You Think You Can Dance, missionary to the Czech Republic, skydiving-bungee jumping adrenaline junkie, leadership development consultant, being at gunpoint 12 times…online dating.\n\nSeventeen years after those four shows in Northern Ireland a friend told Lauree, “I think you could do radio.” A PD in Dallas took a chance to teach her how to do radio. Lauree is celebrating 5 years as a radio personality and loves doing middays at K-LOVE.\n\nEJ Gaines\n\nSenior VP of Marketing at Capitol CMG & Co-Executive Director of Motown Gospel\n\n< INSPIRATIONAL >\n\nKeeping the Gates of a Holy City\n\nBe encouraged and challenged as we refocus our collective missions to include the idea of “gatekeeping” according to God’s intended design for it. We’ll explore what stewardship of platforms can spiritually and practically look like, and we’ll dive into how we can best honor God and one another as we serve in the Christian media industry.\n\nEJ Gaines is Senior Vice President of Marketing at Capitol CMG and Co-Executive Director of Motown Gospel, divisions of Capitol Records/Universal Music Group. An entertainment lawyer and former artist manager with 20 years of experience in the music business, EJ Gaines has guided the careers of GRAMMY® Award-winning recording artists, producers and songwriters, as well as producers and talent in film, TV and other forms of media and content.\n\nEJ Gaines serves as a National Trustee for the Recording Academy, and sits on the Board of Directors for several organizations, including Music Health Alliance, the Gospel Music Trust Fund, and the Gospel Music Association. In 2021, EJ was named a Change Agent by Billboard and, most recently, was appointed Chairman of the U.S. Board of Hope for Justice, a global nonprofit organization which aims to end human trafficking and modern slavery.\n\nEJ Gaines currently resides in Franklin, TN with his wife, recording artist and public speaker Janice Gaines, and their two sons.\n\nPeter Greer\n\nPresident & CEO, HOPE International\n\n< LEADERSHIP, INSPIRATIONAL >\n\nRooting for Rivals\n\nFaith-based organizations are sometimes known for what we’re against–and, all too often, that includes being against each other. But followers of Jesus have a unique opportunity to link arms across our organizational boundaries and pursue a calling higher than our own agendas. Rooting for Rivals reveals how your organization can multiply its impact by cooperating rather than competing. This session celebrates case studies illustrating the power of collaborative partnership in pursuing the power of openhanded leadership.\n\nPeter Greer is the president and CEO of HOPE International, a global Christ-centered economic development organization serving throughout Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Prior to joining HOPE, Peter worked internationally in Cambodia, Zimbabwe and Rwanda and received an MPP in political and economic development from Harvard’s Kennedy School. Peter’s favorite part of his job is spending time with the entrepreneurs HOPE serves—whether harvesting coffee with farmers in Rwanda, dancing alongside savings groups in Haiti, or visiting the greenhouses of entrepreneurs in Ukraine. As an advocate for the Church’s role in missions and alleviating extreme poverty, Peter has co-authored 14 books, including Mission Drift, Rooting for Rivals, The Gift of Disillusionment, and The Spiritual Danger of Doing Good. More important than his role at HOPE is his role as husband to Laurel and dad to Keith, Liliana, Myles, and London. While his sports loyalties remain in New England, Peter and his family live in Lancaster, PA.\n\nDaniel Harkavy\n\nCEO & Executive Coach, Building Leaders\n\n< LEADERSHIP, INSPIRATIONAL >\n\nLiving a Life of More\n\nMany of us feel called to live a life of more – more impact, more meaning, more purpose. But if we’re not careful, we can get stuck in The Drift and find ourselves living a life of mediocrity – or worse regrets. Daniel will share a time-tested model from the best-selling book, Living Forward, so you can use your life as a platform to make an even greater impact in those around you.\n\nDaniel Harkavy has been coaching business leaders to peak levels of performance, efficacy, and fulfillment for more than 25 years.\n\nIn 1996, he harnessed his passion for coaching leaders and teams to found Building Champions, where he serves as CEO and Executive Coach. Daniel and his team of coaches have worked with thousands of clients and organizations to improve the way they lead and live.\n\nDaniel is a sought-after author and speaker, most recently authoring The 7 Perspectives of Effective Leaders which was released in October 2020. His book Living Forward, a national bestseller, was published in March 2016. Daniel also authored Becoming A Coaching Leader: The Proven Strategy for Building Your Own Team of Champions in 2007.\n\nAs an executive coach and trusted confidant, Daniel works with high profile leaders to improve their leadership, decision-making, influence, and overall effectiveness. Daniel’s emphatic belief is that self-leadership precedes team leadership, and his goal is to help his clients optimize how they lead themselves first, then focusing on how to best work with their executive teams and all key constituents in their organizations. He engages with clients in many forms including one-on-one executive coaching sessions, executive retreats, speaking engagements and custom experiences.\n\nSome of the clients he has worked with include: Daimler, Nike, Chick-fil-A, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Infineum (an ExxonMobil and Shell company), Bank of America, Wells Fargo, MetLife, PrimeLending, US Bank, Northwestern Mutual, Morgan Stanley, Prudential, Merrill Lynch and many others.\n\nDaniel lives just outside Portland, Oregon, where he and his wife and family enjoy a little space for gardening and play. Daniel actively serves his community as a member of nonprofit boards and a mentor to those seeking his guidance. His other passions include surfing, snowboarding, and spending time with his family.\n\nTodd Henry\n\nAuthor & Speaker\n\n< LEADERSHIP, CREATIVE >\n\nCreativity, Bravery, and Impact\n\nMost of our cultural reference points for bravery involve heroic actions like storming a beach, risking everything on an unlikely business deal, or casting caution to the wind on a massive career change. When organizations are willing to confront uncertainty with clear and decisive action, greatness emerges. Discover the two key factors that must be present for habitual bravery to occur and how leaders and creative pros can cultivate “the brave habit” in their daily lives to grow both their platform and impact.\n\nPositioning himself as an “arms dealer for the creative revolution,” Todd Henry teaches leaders and organizations how to establish practices that lead to everyday brilliance. He is the author of five books (The Accidental Creative, Die Empty, Louder Than Words, Herding Tigers, The Motivation Code, Daily Creative) which have been translated into more than a dozen languages, and he speaks and consults across dozens of industries on creativity, leadership, and passion for work.\n\nWith more than fifteen million downloads, his podcast The Accidental Creative offers weekly tips for how to stay prolific, brilliant, and healthy. Todd’s book Die Empty was named by Amazon.com as one of the best books of 2013.\n\nHis latest book, Daily Creative, offers daily sparks of inspiration and practical advice for creative pros.\n\nNeal Hopson\n\nAfternoons, BOOST RADIO / Middays, NGEN / Evenings , Pulse 101.7\n\n< MOMENTUM HOST >\n\nNeal “Neallytime” Hopson is a man driven by family and faith. He is a husband of 13 years to his beautiful wife, Kim and father to their 4 year old daughter, Gabriella. He’s a lover of Jesus and Chipotle.
