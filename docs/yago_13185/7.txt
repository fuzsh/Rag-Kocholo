On Jan. 24 at SIFF Cinema at the Uptown, director Eric Byler appeared at a screening of his critically acclaimed 2006 film “Americanese,” which is based on Shawn Wong’s 1995 novel, “American Knees.”

Byler and Wong answered questions from the audience after the screening, which was partly aimed at stirring up interest for a DVD release of the film.

The event was co-presented by the University of Washington Creative Writing Program. (end)
