        "text": "Feature Film Grand Jury Awards\n\nNARRATIVE FEATURE COMPETITION Presented by Panavision\n\nWinner: I Love My Dad\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: James Morosini, Producers: Bill Stertz, Patton Oswalt, Sean O'Grady, Dane Eckerle, Phil Keefe, Daniel Brandt, Sam Slater\n\n“A bold, funny film that marks an impressive feature debut for writer-director-star James Morosini, I Love My Dad finely threads the needle with its tale of an estranged father (Patton Oswalt) who catfishes his son (Morosini) in an attempt to reconnect. Working from a screenplay based on his own real-life story, Morosini displays massive empathy as a filmmaker to get into the mind of the father he feels betrayed by, and also as an actor portraying the impact of that betrayal. He’s aided by a great cast, particularly Oswalt.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Extraordinary Cinematic Vision: Cast and Crew, It is In Us All\n\n“Every creative element of It Is In Us All, from its editing andmusic to its performances and cinematography, works in tandem to craft a haunting atmosphere. Writer-director-actor Antonia Campbell-Hughes’ extraordinary feature debut is a remarkable example of how the various artistic facets of a movie can converge to create something cinematic, in the purest and most soulful sense: a work that accesses some part of you that feels hidden away.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Breakthrough Performance: Elizaveta Yankovskaya, Nika\n\n“In her first lead role in a feature, Elizaveta Yankovskaya delivers a knockout portrait brimming with rage, joy, despair, uncertainty and 20-something yearning. She plays Nika Turbina, a real-life figure who, after fame was thrust upon her as a child poet, finds herself past her prime before she's 30. Whatever narrative conjectures the intimate drama might make, there isn’t a moment in Yankovskaya’s breathtaking performance that doesn’t ring true with messy emotional complexity, or that doesn’t feel like unpredictable life itself unfolding before our eyes.”\n\nA big thanks to our Narrative Feature Competition presenting sponsor Panavision, the global provider of optics, cameras, and end-to-end services that power the creative vision of filmmakers.\n\nDOCUMENTARY FEATURE COMPETITION Presented by IMAX\n\nWinner: Master of Light\n\nDirector: Rosa Ruth Boesten, Producers: Roger Ross Williams, Anousha Nzume, Ilja Roomans\n\n“In both substance and form, Master of Light is a gift. The earnest and gifted painter George Anthony Morton embeds viewers in his world as he struggles to render his mother — both on the canvas and in his psyche. Boesten disabuses us of static tropes about America’s merciless drug war and about contemporary art. With astonishing intimacy, the film’s visuals build an artful bridge between two- and three-dimensional realms that are deeply rooted and utterly transcendent. Put this painting of film in a museum, next to a Rembrandt and a Morton.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Exceptional Intimacy in Storytelling: Bad Axe\n\nDirector: David Siev, Producers: Jude Harris, Diane Quon, Katarina Vasquez, David Siev\n\n“Stories centered on the pursuit of the “American Dream” abound. Rarely do they portray the sacrifices and recurrent trials that the promise of a better life entails the way director David Siev accomplishes with Bad Axe. Examining those closest to him with profound compassion and incisive curiosity, he paints a distinct and easily recognizable portrait of the alienation many feel in the place they call home, by birth or by circumstance. For its ability to reveal something unexpected about the American fabric and the American family, Bad Axe deserves celebration.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Acting in a Documentary: Steve Glew, Pez Outlaw\n\n“Steve Glew is the kind of colorful character that most documentarians dream of capturing, a born storyteller with a crackerjack sense of scene-setting and comic timing. In the tradition of Muhammad Ali in The Greatest and Evel Knievel in Viva Kneivel!, The Pez Outlaw’s reenactment sequences cast the only actor who could credibly bring Mr. Glew’s exploits to life: the man himself. There’s something uniquely American about Glew’s mixture of chutzpah, ingenuity, charisma, and grievance that makes him a mesmerizing onscreen presence.”\n\nSince 1970 IMAX Documentaries have immersed audiences in real-life stories told on a grand scale. In 2022 that tradition continues as a new generation of filmmakers turns its lens to a theatrical experience like no other. Today, IMAX is honored to present this year’s documentary award to recognize the future — gifted storytellers who are bringing their stories to audiences in powerful and wondrous ways.\n\nShort Film Grand Jury Awards Presented by IMDbPro\n\nNARRATIVE SHORT COMPETITION\n\nWinner: All the Crows in the World\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: Tang Yi, Producer: Haozheng Li\n\n“The jury recognizes All The Crows in the World as the Jury Award Winner, a film that reminded us of the power of short-form cinema as a stand-alone art form on its own. The film's balancing of surrealism, bizarreness, tenderness, and reality was only outdone by its inventive narrative and critiques of patriarchal culture, paired with execution by a director who is clearly in command of her craft.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Directing and Community Filmmaking: Glitter Ain’t Gold\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: Christian Nolan Jones, Producers: Maia Miller, T. Popps, O. Valerie Nicolas\n\n“The jury awards Glitter Ain’t Gold a Special Jury Recognition for Directing and Community Filmmaking, which stood out for its vibrant narrative and authentically palpable energy filled with compelling visuals and inventive editing harmoniously coupled with powerfully nostalgic music. It was clear that its level of specificity was a direct result of a community that came together to make a profound piece of art that touched us deeply.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Outstanding Performances: Aphrodite Armstrong, Kyle Riggs, West By God\n\n“The jury awards a Special Jury Recognition for Outstanding Performances to Aphrodite Armstrong and Kyle Riggs for West by God. Their dynamic and visceral performances beautifully emulate the powerful themes within the film about the human condition and the need for love, no matter what your walk of life.”\n\nDOCUMENTARY SHORT COMPETITION\n\nWinner: Long Line of Ladies\n\nDirectors: Rayka Zehtabchi, Shaandiin Tome, Producers: Garrett Schiff, Pimm Tripp-Allen, Rayka Zehtabchi, Sam Davis, Dana Kurth\n\n“Long Line of Ladies presents an affecting perspective on celebrated generational cultural traditions. The tapestry of beautiful cinematography and vivid character moments elevates the filmmakers’ vision, inviting us into a devoted community that is committed to preserving their heritage.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Visual Reflection: not even for a moment do things stand still\n\nDirector: Jamie Meltzer, Producers: Annie Marr, Jamie Meltzer, Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg\n\n“In a simple, yet profoundly moving way, not even for a moment do things stand still allows us to sincerely reflect on the lives we have lost over the past two years. The poetic visual language gives us a new perspective on a sadly familiar topic of love, life and loss.”\n\nMIDNIGHT SHORTS\n\nWinner: Moshari\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: Nuhash Humayun, Producers: Bushra Afreen, Nuhash Humayun\n\n“Moshari is a terrifying, spine-chilling horror tale centering two sisters that renders a fresh take on blood sucking creatures set in an non-traditional post-apocalyptic world. The compelling performances, the haunting visuals and the layered storytelling highlight the director’s command of the genre and make him someone to watch. Nuhash Humayun has the ability to take recognizable elements, flip them on their head and turn them into nightmares. Moshari has created an allegorical story that will resonate with the viewer on a deeper level.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Powerful “Short Trip”:Omi\n\nDirector: Kelly Fyffe-Marshall, Screenwriters: Tamar Bird, Kelly Fyffe-Marshall, Producer: Tamar Bird\n\n“Unexpected, effective and engaging film that in under three minutes manages to set up the lore, get us invested in the characters, while leaving us fulfilled and still craving more. Kelly Fyffe-Marshall has created a grounded supernatural story that is provocative, mysterious and unforgettable.”\n\nANIMATED SHORTS\n\nWinner: Bestia\n\nDirector: Hugo Covarrubias, Screenwriters: Martín Erazo, Hugo Covarrubias, Producers: Tevo Díaz, Hugo Covarrubias\n\n“Bestia is an exquisite, intimate peek at the dreams and memories of a sadistic secret agent, set in a tactile stop-motion non-wonderland, where a porcelain exterior isn’t enough to keep the damage away.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Unexpected Emotion: Les Larmes de la Seine\n\nDirectors/Screenwriters: Yanis Belaid, Eliott Benard, Producer: Carlos De Carvalho\n\n“The magic trick of this film is that it describes great tragedy almost entirely with joy. History comes alive as we are immersed in raw beautiful humanity that jokes, laughs, feels nervous, fights, and dies. By illustrating extreme distress with astonishing euphoria, the directors create a fever dream “photo negative” glimpse of what we’ve missed by living with hatred and abuse rather than love and understanding. Like a sad melody played in major key, the film is both haunting and uplifting while stirring emotions like no film we’ve ever seen.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Visceral Storytelling: Something in the Garden\n\nDirector/Screenwriter/Producer: Marcos Sánchez\n\n“It is so important to keep your brain open to play, and we commend this film's playful spirit combined with its beautiful animation, reminiscent of a graphic novel. It felt at the perfect cross section of horror and ASMR, using impeccable pacing and sound design to take us on a visceral journey that thrilled, scared and delighted us. A brilliant use of the animated short form medium!”\n\nMUSIC VIDEOS\n\nWinner: Desirée Dawson - ‘Meet You At the Light’\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: Alexander Farah\n\n“Without a single detail wasted, we were all moved to tears by this powerful story from a first-time music video director. Featuring equally beautiful performances, editing, and cinematography, we present the Best Music Video award to Desirée Dawson - Meet You At the Light by Alexander Farah.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Going the Extra Mile: Myd - ‘Let You Speak’\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: Dan Carr\n\n“Funny, unexpected, and with a meta wink to the industry, our special jury mention went above and beyond our expectations, taking us around the world to various locations with a group of ragtag misfits that made us LOL along the way. Hence, the ‘Extra Mile’ award. The Special Jury Award for Going The Extra Mile Goes to Myd “Let You Speak” by Dan Carr.”\n\nTEXAS SHORTS\n\nWinner: Folk Frontera\n\nDirectors: Alejandra Vasquez, Sam Osborn\n\n“Centered around characters who call the desert borderlands of Texas their home, Folk Frontera turns the traditional documentary form on its head. Filmmakers Alejandra Vasquez and Sam Osborn imbue the documentary with the same magic and surrealism that feels authentic to the Chihuahuan Desert and its communities. Dreamlike visuals and nuanced presentation of the subjects’ stories make for a special experience.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Vision: Birds\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: Katherine Propper, Producer: Sophia Loffreda\n\n“Katherine Propper’s Birds feels both fresh and warmly familiar to anyone who’s grown up during a Central Texas summer. Members of the film’s exceptional young ensemble shine in natural performances that help us see gorgeously shot scenery in a new light.”\n\nTEXAS HIGH SCHOOL SHORTS\n\nWinner: Honeybee\n\nDirector/Screenwriter/Producer: Emilio Vazquez Reyes\n\n“Honeybee is a beautifully-written, thoughtfully-crafted film that unfolds with a gentle and disciplined reveal, helping to humanize the experience of an undocumented immigrant. We felt this film was a graceful way to tell a difficult story, using all of the important elements like cinematography, music and editing to both advance the story and sincerely engage with the audience.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Artistic Expression: It’s Getting Bad Again\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: Sarah Reyes, Producers: Sarah Reyes, Kenneth Rogers\n\n“As an artist, Sarah Reyes captures a roller-coaster of an emotional exploration that balances darkness, humor and music in a poetic and refreshing way, all the while prompting an important dialogue about mental health awareness.”\n\nA big thanks to our presenting sponsor, IMDbPro.

The subtlety of the episode’s writing and acting are complemented by specific and stylized direction and cinematography. And above all, Something Undone sets itself apart with its smart use of diegetic sound, establishing quietly humorous commentary on the sounds of the genre at large — while also totally terrifying us in just ten minutes.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Unique Vision in Writing and Directing: My Year of Dicks\n\nShowrunner: Pamela Ribon, Directors: Sara Gunnarsdóttir, Screenwriter: Pamela Ribon, Producer: Jeanette Jeanenne\n\n“For its thoughtful curation of imagery combined with a funny and inventive script, the Special Jury Recognition for Unique Vision in Writing and Directing goes to Pamela Ribbon and Sara Gunnarsdóttir for My Year of Dicks. Their bold voices overlap to make for an experience of feminine youth and sexual exploration that is both relatable and entirely its own.”\n\nSXSW Film Design Awards Presented by Adobe\n\nPOSTER DESIGN COMPETITION\n\nWinner: More Than I Remember\n\nDesigner: Yen Tan, Maya Edelman\n\n“This poster evokes so many feelings at once, from the captivating gaze to the lush swirl of colors that surround you — it draws you in, tempting you to look harder, to try and unlock whatever secret is hidden just beyond reach. The text and illustration are perfectly integrated to create something powerful and mysterious, catching not just your attention, but your imagination as well.\"\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition: The Sentence of Michael Thompson\n\nDesigner: Juan Miguel Marin\n\n\"Understated intensity and a timeless quality make this poster truly effective — from across the room it immediately catches the eye. Type, design, and image work together to form a complete narrative, one you want to know more about. Understated intensity and a timeless quality make it truly effective.\"\n\nTITLE DESIGN COMPETITION\n\nWinner: Foundation Title Sequence\n\nDesigner: Ronnie Koff\n\nCompany: Imaginary Forces\n\n“A beautifully constructed sequence that encapsulates the show’s futuristic setting as humans have colonized the galaxy. Using a particle system to form these incredible images each frame is a visual triumph as we journey through this vibrant main title.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition: The White Lotus Title Sequence\n\nDesigners: Katrina Crawford, Mark Bashore\n\nCompany: Plains of Yonder\n\n“This title’s distinctive design perfectly sets up the audience for the show and reflects the suffering before enlightenment of its protagonists. Its stunning illustrations capture the soul of the story and are enhanced by the flawless score.”\n\nXR EXPERIENCE COMPETITION\n\nWinner: On the Morning You Wake (To the End of the World)\n\nDirectors: Dr. Jamaica Heolomeleikalani Osorio, Mike Brett, Steve Jamison, Pierre Zandrowicz, Arnaud Colinart, Screenwriters: Mike Brett, Steve Jamison, Jamaica Heolimeleikalani Osorio, Producers: Arnaud Colinart, Mike Brett, Steve Jamison, Jo-Jo Ellison\n\n“On The Morning You Wake (To the End of the World) is an emotionally impactful and beautifully told story, delivered with stunning technical craftsmanship. This project explores the potential of immersive experiences, refining the grammar of spatial narrative. This particular story deals with the urgency of nuclear disarmament that has very unfortunately come into sharp focus due to current events. It effectively presents a massive geopolitical issue and grounds it in emotional and personal stories, translating what are usually abstract concepts into an embodied context.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Immersive Storytelling: (Hi)story of a Painting: The Light in the Shadow\n\nDirectors: Quentin Darras, Gaëlle Mourre, Screenwriter: Gaëlle Mourre, Producers: Charlotte Mikkelborg, Gaëlle Mourre\n\n(Hi)story of a Painting: The Light in the Shadow receives a Special Jury Recognition for immersive storytelling. This experience uses the medium of VR to transport us into history, revealing the story of a lesser known female baroque artist, her resistance to the patriarchy and determination in the face of adversity.”\n\nSXSW Special Awards\n\nFandor New Voices Award\n\nFandor is proud to present the first ever Fandor New Voices Award, celebrating an outstanding feature making its worldwide premiere this year at the 35th annual SXSW festival.

(Opt-in Award)\n\nLouis Black \"Lone Star\" Award\n\nWinner: What We Leave Behind\n\nDirector: Iliana Sosa, Producers: Emma D. Miller, Iliana Sosa, Isidore Bethel (co-producer)\n\n\"Iliana Sosa's exquisite documentary What We Leave Behind is a love letter to her Mexican grandfather, whose final decline she chronicles with artful grace. It is also a moving look at a family disconnected by both border and dreams, and how their patriarch, too old now for his monthly 20-hour bus rides from Durango into Texas, worries who will hold the center once he's gone. Eighty-nine year old Julian has the face and gravitas of an old time movie star. Sosa has made a profound, gorgeous movie worthy of her precious subject.\"\n\nZEISS Cinematography Award\n\nZEISS Cine Lenses is honored to be returning this year to support the SXSW film community in the Cinematography category.

Writer and director Megan Park delivers a timely, riveting, and thought-provoking film on the toll it takes on a teenager who is facing a world where they no longer feel safe. It is an intense, moving piece that highlights an important issue to which one can’t help but feel connected.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Multi-hyphenate Storyteller\n\nI’m Fine (Thanks for Asking)\n\nDirectors: Kelley Kali and Angelique Molina\n\n“Kelley Kali’s I’m Fine (Thanks for Asking), financed in part by stimulus relief checks, is a marvel of multitasking and resourcefulness. Kali’s film, which she wrote, directed, produced and stars in, winningly captures the pandemic plight of a homeless, roller-skating single mother over a memorable daylong odyssey.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Breakthrough Performance\n\nIslands\n\nDirector: Martin Edralin\n\nActor: Rogelio Balagtas\n\n“Islands gives us the story of a painfully shy man set adrift in the world by the declining health of the parents who sheltered him. This story, of someone blooming late in life, hinges on the tremendously compelling, interior performance from relative newcomer Rogelio Balagtas who can break hearts throughout with his tears and enables the movie to transcend with a single smile.”\n\nDocumentary Feature Competition\n\nWinner\n\nLily Topples the World\n\nDirector: Jeremy Workman\n\n“A joyful portrait of grace in artistry and commitment in engineering, Lily Topples the World shows a life online that transcends virality and touches something deeper. In Lily Hevesh, aka Hevesh5, the film features a collaborative, creative soul who comes by community and entrepreneurship naturally. A rare achievement in nonjudgmental subcultural exploration and a gorgeously rendered portrait of burgeoning adulthood that tumbles forward, like Lily’s domino art, into something beautiful.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Exceptional Intimacy in Storytelling\n\nIntroducing, Selma Blair\n\nDirector: Rachel Fleit\n\n“Selma Blair's unflinching and raw vulnerability in Introducing, Selma Blair, coupled with director Rachel Fleit's almost voyeuristic chronicling of her MS diagnosis, invites us not just to feel empathy for the star. More than that, it invites us into her fight, prompting anyone watching to feel joined with her in battle. That level of disarming intimacy is rarely witnessed on screen, particularly from a public figure, making the feat all the more incredible.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Humanity in Social Action\n\nNot Going Quietly\n\nDirector: Nicholas Bruckman\n\n“Activist is a word much used in contemporary culture. But few give expression to it like Ady Barkan, a California organizer who, upon being diagnosed with ALS in his early 30s, responds not with self-pitying convalescence but by barnstorming his fight across the country, bringing a movement with him. Barkan’s tale suggests that grace is not incompatible with ardor, and hardship no obstacle to achievement. Bruckman’s film captures him and the powerful women who lead his fight in ways that are richly human, always affectionate and frequently rousing.”\n\nShort Film Grand Jury Awards\n\nNarrative Shorts\n\nWinner\n\nPlay It Safe\n\nDirector: Mitch Kalisa\n\n“We were so thrilled by the varied, inventive selection of films in the Narrative Shorts competition this year. Of the shorts, we have decided to award the Jury Award to Play It Safe, for approaching oft-addressed topics in a new way, for its incredible main performance, for its thoughtful direction, and compelling cinematography.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Visionary Storytelling\n\nDon't Go Tellin' Your Momma\n\nDirectors: Topaz Jones, rubberband.\n\n“We are awarding Don't Go Tellin' Your Momma a Special Jury Recognition for Visionary Storytelling for its bold filmmaking and mix of music, visuals, and documentary footage.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Direction\n\nLike the Ones I Used to Know\n\nDirector: Annie St-Pierre\n\n“We are awarding Like the Ones I Used to Know a Special Jury Recognition for Direction, as its weaving between reality and flights of fancy make it a Christmas tale to remember. Congratulations to all of the filmmakers this year, and thank you for your new works!”\n\nDocumentary Shorts\n\nWinner\n\nÁguilas\n\nDirectors: Kristy Guevara-Flanagan and Maite Zubiaurre\n\n“Águilas is a film that most poignantly displays the need immigrants feel to come to America — even at the cost of starvation and death. Failed attempts are presented by a backpack, a sweater, and scattered bones. How desperate the dream is of a perfect landing that ends so tragically.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Courage\n\nRed Taxi\n\nDirector: Anonymous\n\n“Red Taxi is a film that is being recognized for its courage. The type of courage that spans the definition of the word. The subjects are courageous, the filmmakers are courageous, and the film itself is courageous both stylistically and in the way it speaks on an issue through editing that is measured, considered, and understanding of the complexities of the post-colonial project.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Poetry\n\nI Ran From It and Was Still in It\n\nDirector: Darol Olu Kae\n\n“Its title invites audiences to expect a wholly distinct storytelling experience and this film delivers. For its audacious storytelling through textured imagery, bold structure and lyrical approach, we award this special achievement to I Ran From It and Was Still In It.”\n\nMidnight Shorts\n\nWinner\n\nThe Moogai\n\nDirector: Jon Bell\n\n“The Moogai is a haunting, psychological thriller that explores postpartum depression in an impressive display of disciplined filmmaking that stuck the landing at every pivotal moment. The cinematography is striking, the actor’s performances are brave, and the underlying commentary on a country’s forced removal of generations of children is heartbreaking. Filmmaker Jon Bell’s film affected us on so many levels that we proudly recognize it with the Jury Award prize.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Bold Vision\n\nStuffed\n\nDirector: Theo Rhys\n\n“Stuffed proudly presents a story grisly and grotesque yet beautifully bittersweet. Director and co-writer Theo Rhys stitches together a world of rot, flesh, and leather, then brings it to radiant life with curious characters and striking songs of dark dreams, lifting love, and the ultimate sacrifice. It is with shock and awe that we award this strange and sensational short a Jury Recognition for Bold Vision.”\n\nAnimated Shorts\n\nWinner\n\nNuevo Rico\n\nDirector: Kristian Mercado\n\n“Be prepared for this dystopian tragedy to rip your hair out by the roots and pour liquid vaporwave rainbows directly onto your brain’s tongue. A cautionary tale of friendship and fame, Nuevo Rico slaps convention to the ground and stomps on it with steel toed boots of satisfying stylistic innovation. Kristian Mercado Figueroa doesn’t give a fuck — and gives all the fucks at the same time. If you’ve never wrestled a laser snake in a Lambo going two hundred off a cliff into an iridescent volcano, Nuevo Rico will make you feel like you have.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Innovation\n\nKKUM\n\nDirector: Kang Min Kim\n\n“An awe inspiring masterclass in creativity, resourcefulness, and innovative lighting and stop-motion techniques. This film manages to elevate simplistic materials to create mesmerizing sequences, while also taking you on a poetic, dreamy, and emotional journey that serves as a beautiful tribute to a mother's love.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Storytelling\n\nYour Own Bullshit\n\nDirector: Daria Kopiec\n\n“We the jury have selected Your Own Bullshit for a Jury Recognition for Storytelling for its masterful and experimental take on a vastly relatable human story. Its stylistic choices, humor, sound design, character development, and pace bring excitement to a topic under which it is not easy to push boundaries. Yet, it does just that.”\n\nMusic Videos\n\nWinner\n\nMadame Gandhi - 'Waiting for Me'\n\nDirector: Misha Ghose\n\n“Of all the wonderful works nominated, Madame Gandhi's 'Waiting for Me', directed by Misha Ghose, soared to the top for its compelling visuals, rich color palettes, and vital message of empowerment and self-expression. The video supported and enhanced both the song and the artist. This video and this artist deserve to be shared, seen, and heard by everyone. Everywhere.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for How the Hell Did They Do That?!\n\nWaze & Odyssey, George Michael, Mary J. Blige & Tommy Theo - 'Always'\n\nDirector: Nelson de Castro\n\n“The Jury would also like to award the music video for 'Always' by Waze & Odyssey with a Special Jury 'How the Hell Did They Do That?!' recognition.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Pure Joy\n\nKuricorder Quartet - 'Southpaw'\n\nDirector: Sawako Kabuki\n\n“The Jury would further like to recognize for pure joy, the music video, ‘Southpaw' by Kuricorder Quartet, directed by Sawako Kabuki.”\n\nTexas Shorts\n\nWinner\n\nSummer Animals\n\nDirector: Haley Elizabeth Anderson\n\n“Summer Animals, Haley Elizabeth Anderson’s short film entry for SXSW 2021, captivated us with its naturalistic style and layered approach to storytelling. Ostensibly a story about three siblings and their quest to find a moment of relief — or a pool to cannonball into — during a particularly grueling summer, the film evolves into something else entirely, and is anchored by the cast’s stellar performances and Anderson’s clear-eyed direction.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Vision\n\nO Black Hole!\n\nDirector: Renee Zhan\n\n“This imaginative journey explores a literal impression of its title and a figurative one. It’s otherworldly imagery, music and sound design combined for an emotional experience that surprised us at every turn.”\n\nTexas High School Shorts\n\nWinner\n\nA Really Dark Comedy\n\nDirector: Manasi Ughadmathe\n\n“A Really Dark Comedy is a well-crafted comedy short that weaves together great comedic timing, excellent chemistry between its two leads, and some surprising twists. We found it to be a breath of fresh air in a pandemic year where everyone could use a (really dark) laugh.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Directing\n\nBeyond the Model\n\nDirector: Jessica Lin\n\n“The power of this documentary comes from the artistry and sensitivity of its director, Jessica Lin. Parts observational and parts reflexive, Beyond the Model’s clear voice stems from a desire to allow its subjects to breathe and share, making for an organic, poignant, and insightful short.”\n\nEpisodic Pilot Competition\n\nWinner\n\n4 Feet High\n\nDirectors: Maria Belen Poncio and Rosario Perazolo Masjoan\n\n“For its beautifully cinematic and heartfelt coming-of-age story, with a confident performance from a standout lead actress, the jury is awarding this year’s top prize to 4 Feet High. The episode is thrillingly unique from its opening minutes, with a strong point of view and an engaging central character whose journey feels keenly specific but also evokes universal high school experiences — and while the story takes its time, there is never a wasted frame. We commend the cast and creative team for telling this a moving story in such an assured way.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Best Duo\n\nPretend Partners\n\nDirector: Ron Najor\n\n“For their witty script and genuine onscreen chemistry, the Special Jury Recognition for Best Duo goes to Kristin Erickson and Ron Najor for Pretend Partners. As showrunners, screenwriters, producers, and stars of the project (in addition to Najor directing), Erickson and Najor created an inventive take on the romantic comedy that was sweet and hilarious in equal measure, and then carried that story themselves as its central characters.”\n\nSXSW Film Design Awards Presented by Adobe\n\nPoster Design Competition\n\nWinner\n\nBob Moses Featuring ZHU - 'Desire'\n\nCreative Director: Owen Brown\n\nArt Director and Illustrator: Benjámin Kalászi\n\nGraphic Designer: Diego L. Rodríguez (Paramoidme)\n\n“A visually gripping design, this poster draws you into a surreal moment frozen in time where something you want so badly seems just out of reach. We were struck by the electric color palette, bold typography and dreamy illustration style that evokes flight, time travel, and science fiction. Everything in this poster just feels intriguing and we are so excited to award the Excellence in Poster Design Winner to 'Desire'!”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition\n\nThe Box\n\nDesigners: James Burns and Shal Ngo, Aleksander Walijewski\n\n“A mix of bold graphics, creative typography, and emotive imagery, this poster grabs attention and pulls you into the narrative of prisoners in criminal reform systems and isolation. Spending a moment with the imagery feels like a window into the film and the minds of those enduring their own boxes, both tangible and the ones built in our minds. Overall, this poster was interesting, thought provoking, and wove together narrative and design in striking ways. Brava! We’re thrilled to give a Special Jury Recognition to 'The Box'!”\n\nTitle Design Competition\n\nWinner\n\nThe Queen’s Gambit Title Sequence\n\nDesigner: Saskia Marka\n\n“Using simple geometric forms and a restrained palette, these titles spring to life through elegant motion design that captures the spirit of the protagonist’s brilliant mental calculations.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition\n\nBirds Of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn Title Sequence\n\nDesigner: Michael Riley\n\n“This sequence embodies everything a great title should: The tone is a perfect match for the movie, the style is unique and ownable, and the visual narrative keeps the audience engaged and delighted throughout.”\n\nVirtual Cinema Competition\n\nWinner\n\nSamsara\n\nDirector: Huang Hsin-Chien\n\n“Samsara provokes existential questions about the future of humanity and consciousness. From the evolution of users’ hands to the rhythmic juxtaposition of vignettes, every detail is weighted in metaphor. The result is a work that compresses a universe into a few minutes; audiences are left to reflect on humanity as a collective macro-organism—as experienced through the machine.”\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Immersive Journalism\n\nReeducated\n\nDirector: Sam Wolson\n\n“Reeducated offers a glimpse into a horrifying world obscured from public view. Through illustration and testimony from three people who lived through the internment camps in Xinjiang, we learn about the brutal practices used against the Uyghur ethnic minority. It’s a striking piece of 360 cinema that makes a clear argument for the unique affordances of immersive formats for telling stories, establishing a powerful logic and vocabulary through the use of composition, scale, pace, and perspective.”\n\nSXSW Special Awards\n\nBrightcove Illumination Award\n\nThe Brightcove Illumination Award honors a filmmaker on the rise, celebrating the innovation and creativity of new artists within the SXSW Film Festival official selections.\n\nBrightcove Illumination Award Presented to:\n\nThe Fallout\n\nDirector: Megan Park\n\n“For her empathetic and honest exploration of life after tragedy, inspired craft, and stellar guidance of a talented young cast, we award the Brightcove Illumination Award to Megan Park for her film The Fallout.”\n\nAdam Yauch Hörnblowér Award\n\nIn honor of a filmmaker whose work strives to be wholly its own, without regard for norms or desire to conform.

We pride ourselves in shining a spotlight on new voices in the writing and filmmaking community, and coming together with like-minded organizations, such as SXSW, that share the same core values. A huge congratulations to this year’s recipient from all of us at Final Draft!\n\nFinal Draft Screenwriters Award Presented to:\n\nPaul Dood’s Deadly Lunch Break\n\nScreenwriters: Brook Driver, Matt White, and Nick Gillespie\n\nLouis Black “Lone Star” Award\n\nTo honor SXSW co-founder/director Louis Black, a jury prize was created in 2011 called the Louis Black “Lone Star” Award, presented to a feature film world premiering at SXSW that was shot primarily in Texas or directed by a current resident of Texas. (Opt-in Award)\n\nLouis Black “Lone Star” Award Winner:\n\nWithout Getting Killed or Caught\n\nDirectors: Tamara Saviano and Paul Whitfield\n\n“This year's Lone Star Award goes to Tamara Saviano and Paul Whitfield's remarkable Without Getting Killed or Caught, an examination of not just the life of legendary Texas singer-songwriter Guy Clark but the complicated, fascinating relationship between himself, his wife Susanna and his best friend Townes Van Zandt, all of whom made extraordinary work together and apart. The storytelling was graceful, densely layered, and immersive.”\n\nZEISS Cinematography Award\n\nZEISS Cine Lenses is honored to be returning this year to support the SXSW film community in the Cinematography category. We believe that by supporting the art within the frame, ZEISS helps filmmakers realize their creative vision.\n\nZEISS Cinematography Award Winner:\n\nGaia\n\nCinematographer: Jorrie van der Walt\n\nMailchimp Support the Shorts Award\n\nMailchimp is committed to uplifting and supporting creators. We’re so proud to support SXSW by helping short films win big. We congratulate the honorees of the Support the Shorts Award and Special Jury Recognition as well as the entire SXSW-invited filmmaking community.\n\nMailchimp Support the Shorts Award Presented to:\n\nChuj Boys of Summer\n\nDirector: Max Walker-Silverman\n\n“With its gentle, observant eye, Chuj Boys of Summer offers a vision of unexpected compassion and tender masculinity. Director Max Walker-Silverman and writer Marcos Ordoñez Ixwalanhkej Mendoza know too much about the world to provide convenient answers to the film's complicated questions, so they instead focus on the little gestures that define their characters' lives. Against the grandeur of the San Juan Mountains, these small moments become unspeakably powerful.”\n\nMailchimp Support the Shorts Special Jury Recognition Presented to:\n\nLike the Ones I Used to Know\n\nDirector: Annie St-Pierre\n\n“Weaving a Christmas tale filled with familiar indignities, Annie St-Pierre and her talented ensemble deftly transform heartbreak into levity while always staying one step ahead of the audience. As every emotion imaginable plays across the cast's astonishing faces, it's the heroes' crumpled dignity that leaves us smiling.”\n\nMailchimp Support the Shorts Special Jury Recognition Presented to:\n\nMalignant\n\nDirector: Morgan Bond and Nickolas Grisham\n\n“In its combination of rich characterization and mysterious camera work, Malignant manages to conjure a uniquely cinematic sense of hallucinatory tension. We honestly can't pinpoint exactly what it is that directors Morgan Bond and Nickolas Grisham have done to create this much unease, but thanks to their mesmerizing talents, Malignant's climax floods the senses and lingers long after the film is over.”\n\nWatch the 2021 SXSW Film Awards\n\nExplore SXSW Film Festival Award winners from previous years:\n\n2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 | 2007 | 2006 | 2005 | 2004 | 2003 | 2002 | 2001 | 2000 | 1999\n\n2019 Film Award Winners\n\nFeature Film Grand Jury Awards\n\nNarrative Feature Competition\n\nGrand Jury Winner: Alice\n\nDirector: Josephine Mackerras\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Best Ensemble: Yes, God, Yes\n\nDirector: Karen Maine\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Breakthrough Voice: Saint Frances\n\nDirector: Alex Thompson\n\nDocumentary Feature Competition\n\nGrand Jury Winner: For Sama\n\nDirectors: Waad al-Kateab, Edward Watts\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Empathy in Craft: Ernie & Joe\n\nDirector: Jenifer McShane\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition for Excellence in Storytelling: Nothing Fancy: Diana Kennedy\n\nDirector: Elizabeth Carroll\n\nShort Film Jury Awards\n\nPresented by Vimeo, an all-in-one video platform that provides creative professionals and businesses with tools technology they need to succeed with video– from hosting, to collaborating, to distributing and monetizing.\n\nNarrative Shorts\n\nJury Winner: Liberty\n\nDirector: Faren Humes\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition: The Orphan\n\nDirector: Carolina Markowicz\n\nDocumentary Shorts\n\nJury Winner: Exit 12\n\nDirector: Mohammad Gorjestani\n\nSpecial Jury Recognition: All Inclusive\n\nDirector: Corina Schwingruber Ilić\n\nMidnight Shorts\n\nJury Winner: Other Side of the Box\n\nDirector: Caleb J.
