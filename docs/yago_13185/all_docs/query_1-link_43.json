        "text": "Interview with Eric Byler\n\nDiscover the Passions That is Behind\n\nThe Creation of the film \"Charlotte Sometimes\"\n\nPart 3 of 6 Pages\n\nTHE CASTING AND THE PLOT\n\nUS ASIANS: Was the plot to \"Charlotte Sometimes\" based on a past experience(s) in your life?\n\nERIC BYLER: Very little in the story actually happened, but the emotional core - the vibe, the mood, the atmosphere - are very particular to my life, and to the lives of the actors. In many ways, the film is a confession.\n\nUS ASIANS: Could you share the reasons and stories behind the casting of the characters in your film?\n\nERIC BYLER: I wrote “Darcy” for Jacqueline Kim.\n\nMatt Westmore won the part of “Justin” with his first audition.\n\nI had a feeling Eugenia Yuan would be perfect for “Lori,” having worked with her at Lodestone.\n\nIt was very difficult to find the perfect actor for “Michael.”\n\nI invited Michael Idemoto to audition late in the game, in large part because I couldn’t choose between the actors I’d narrowed it down to.\n\nUS ASIANS: Can you share the unique story behind the casting of Michael Idemoto?\n\nERIC BYLER: Michael Idemoto was someone I remembered from films like “Sunsets” and Justin Lin’s short film “Breezes,” part of an APA anthology film called “OBITS.” Michael wasn’t the type to show up at auditions though, and in the midst of pre-production I forgot about him.\n\nThe search went on for weeks. The start date was approaching, and I still didn’t have a leading man. It was actually a dream that reminded me of Michael. The idea made so much sense, it woke me up.\n\nThe next morning I tracked down his number and asked him to audition. He liked the script. But I almost felt like I was auditioning for him when we met for the first time.\n\nHe might deny it, but I remember him saying to me, “I love the idea, but, do you really have the goods to pull this off?” I suggested we drive across town, in the rain, to watch my short film at the production office. After seeing “Kenji’s Faith,” he said, “Okay, what do I have to do?”\n\nI asked him to read with Jacqueline and Matt - who’d been cast already – and later with Eugenia, who won the part after doing the same.\n\nI knew that the dynamic between Jacqueline and Michael would be the key. Ultimately, I chose Michael because the two of them were great together. If I had to identify the moment I knew for sure, it was a brief glimpse of Michael and Jacqueline with Matt-- as they read the scene where “Justin” and “Darcy” first meet.\n\nMichael and Matt were perfect rivals, with Jacqueline caught in between. Jacqueline and Eugenia were perfect rivals too. If I hadn’t been fortunate enough to strike the right balance with all four lead actors, I’m certain the film would not have been a success.\n\nUS ASIANS: It has often been stated that talented actors bring additional textures, could you share (in your opinio) what unique perspective(s) that they added to their characters?\n\nEugenia Yuan\n\nERIC BYLER: They all contributed a great deal. Michael Idemoto brought sincerity and integrity to “Michael”—whereas I’d written him to be more of a deceiver.\n\nEugenia Yuan’s “Lori” was more vulnerable, innocent, and I guess more forgivable. Together, they developed a sort of childlike, flirtatious chemistry that was kind of unexpected. I decided to go with what developed naturally. That’s why I added the scene in the junkyard, where Lori hangs with Michael in the car with no engine. I also rewrote the ending.\n\nMatt Westmore and Jacqueline Kim departed less from my original ideas. They fully understood the characters I’d written and just became them. I think that’s why both were so comfortable with improvisation. The moments leading up to sex in the hotel room are entirely improvised. You can see it, also, in their repartee during the lunch scene.\n\nI planned for a level of improvisation in all the performances, even though most of the dialogue was scripted. There was always an unknown variable for the actors to look out for, and react to.\n\nClick HERE to continue\n\nTo read about Eric's views on other subjects, click on the topics listed below\n\nPart 1: Background Information (Family, Personal and Entertainment) Part 2: Entertainment community support, Film revieww, Opening Dates Part 3: Casting of the film, Michael Idemoto Profile, Plot, Working with the actors Part 4: Asian Pacific American Factors, Jacqueline Kim & Eugenia Yuan's Profiles Part 5: Community support, APA role models, Purpose of the arts Part 6: Film Reviews and Nominations"
