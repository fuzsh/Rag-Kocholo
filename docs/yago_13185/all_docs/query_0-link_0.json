It is based on the novel American Knees by Shawn Wong, concerning the relationships of a man and woman of East Asian descent in the United States.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was written and directed by Eric Byler, adapted from the novel, \"American Knees,\" by Shawn Wong. It was produced by Lisa Onodera, who optioned the book when it was first published in 1995. The film had its world premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival (SXSW) in 2006, where it won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature and a Special Jury Prize for Outstanding Ensemble Cast.[1] In October 2006, IFC Films acquired the film for distribution, under their IFC First Take distribution arm,[2] which will release the film on a \"day-and-date\" platform, which will include a limited theatrical release accompanied simultaneously with a video on demand (V.O.D.) broadcast premiere on Comcast cable.\n\nPremise\n\n[edit]\n\nRaymond Ding, a middle-aged Chinese American college professor, and Aurora Crane, his younger Hapa (half East Asian) girlfriend, have just split, but continue to drift in and out of each other's lives. Unable to fully let go, Raymond visits the apartment they once shared, during the day while Aurora is away. Aurora is haunted by flash-backs of moments from their relationship.\n\nEncouraged by their best friends to move on, Raymond and Aurora each begin new relationships. Aurora dates Steve, a white man closer to her age (and also her best friend's former boyfriend). Raymond dates Betty, a Vietnamese American colleague, who he soon discovers is haunted by her own past. Race and identity issues begin to surface as Raymond and Aurora try to start new lives, but remain drawn to their past.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Tashima as Raymond Ding\n\nAllison Sie as Aurora Crane\n\nJoan Chen as Betty Nguyen\n\nKelly Hu as Brenda Nishitani\n\nBen Shenkman as Steve\n\nSab Shimono as Wood Ding\n\nMichael Paul Chan as Jimmy Chan\n\nAutumn Reeser as Sylvia\n\nRyan Cutrona as Hank Crane\n\nTakayo Fischer as Keiko Crane\n\nAnnie Katsura Rollins as Julia Crane\n\nGreg Watanabe as Young Wood\n\nStephen Bishop as Miles\n\nMunda Razooki as Test Driver #1\n\nNathaniel H.

The film has a score of 67% from Rotten Tomatoes based on nine reviews.[3]\n\nAcclaimed film critic Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three and a half out of four, and wrote \"Byler deals with characters who have lived their years, learned from them, and try to apply their values to their lives. Their romances are not heedless but wary, and involve a lot of negotiation,\" and finished by calling the film \"...uncommonly absorbing\".[4]\n\nKevin Crust of the Los Angeles Times stated that Americanese had \"fine, understated performances and the self-assured way that Byler lets the film find its own rhythms, rather than setting into some template, result in a mature film of subtle complexity\".[5]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nAudience Award – Best Narrative Feature – SXSW[1]\n\nSpecial Jury Prize – Outstanding Ensemble Cast – SXSW[1]\n\nGolden Space Needle Audience Award – Best Actor, 2nd Runner-Up (Chris Tashima) – Seattle International Film Festival[6]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
