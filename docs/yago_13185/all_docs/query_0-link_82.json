Her work has received the Western States Book Award, the Governor’s Writers Award, and a Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Book Award. She received her second Artist Trust Fellowship in 2008, and was honored by the national Latino writers group, Con Tinta, at the Associated Writing Programs Conference in 2014. She has been designated an Island Treasure in the Arts on Bainbridge Island.\n\nKathleen’s latest book is The Deepest Roots: Finding Food and Community on a Pacific Northwest Island, by the University of Washington Press. In it, she explores our relationship with food and the land through research and numerous interviews with the people who bring us our food on Bainbridge Island.\n\nKathleen has a B.A. in Linguistics from Stanford University, an M.A. in Creative Writing from the University of Washington, and a Master of Fine Arts from the University of New Orleans. Kathleen has a great affinity for the story-telling techniques of magic realism and science fiction, and has been both a student and instructor in the Clarion West Science Fiction Workshop.\n\nKathleen was a faculty member at the Northwest Institute of Literary Arts on Whidbey Island from 2008 to 2016. She continues to lecture and teach workshops in creative writing.\n\n2012 Writers Program\n\n2001 Writers Program\n\nGabriela Denise Frank is a transdisciplinary literary artist, editor, educator, and creative consultant whose work expands from the page into the sonic, the visual, and the experiential. In experimenting with formal expression, she seeks to expand the idea of what literary art can be and where people can encounter it. By placing literary art in the path of everyday life Gabriela celebrates storytelling as both a technology of survival and an evergreen source of wonder, pleasure, delight, and humanity.\n\nAn advocate for public art and artists, Gabriela serves as an arts commissioner for the City of Burien, on 4Culture’s arts advisory committee, and as creative nonfiction editor and managing editor of Crab Creek Review. Her creative practice is supported by 4Culture, Centrum, Civita Institute, Invoking the Pause, Jack Straw, Marble House, Mineral School, Seattle Public Library, Shunpike, Vermont Studio Center, and Willapa Bay AIR.\n\nArtist Support Program 2023: Storefront and Sidewalk Poems\n\nNew Media Gallery 2014-2015: UGLY ME\n\n2012 Writers Program\n\nPoet and writer Sharon Hashimoto was born and raised in Seattle.

Her second poetry collection, More American, won the 2021 Off the Grid Poetry Prize and the 2022 Washington State Book Award in Poetry. Her debut short story collection, Stealing Home, is forthcoming in May 2024 (Grid Books). Her poetry and fiction have appeared widely in journals such as the Rambler, Crab Orchard Review, and Shenandoah. She has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the King County Arts Commission, and Artist Trust. Hashimoto teaches writing at Highline Community College in Des Moines, Washington.\n\n2024 Jack Straw Alumni Poetry Series:\n\nMidnight,\n\nThe Spotted Hound Wanders\n\nThrough the Kobashi’s Farm\n\nThe triangle of his head cocked,\n\nsome strange sound catches\n\nhis ear, triggers the far-off call\n\nto something not yet lost\n\nin his blood. Listening, he lowers\n\nhis jaw to the earth, then releases\n\nthe deep bell of his throat.\n\nAgain, his voice pursues the ravine,\n\nbut the open night closes in\n\nfaster. Crouched down on his belly,\n\nwith his eyes closed, he can feel\n\nthe furrowed land like the echoes\n\nof his howl ringing\n\nthe moon.\n\nWriters Program 2012"
