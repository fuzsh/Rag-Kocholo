        "text": "THE RIGHT STUFF\n\nScott Wilson\n\nFrom his spectacular motion picture debut in 1967 in two of the motion picture industrys classic films, In the Heat of the Night for director Norman Jewison and In Cold Blood for Richard Brooks, Scott Wilson has consistently achieved the highest industry and critical response. The key to Wilsons success has been the careful selection of material and his association with many of the film industrys most illustrious directors. Such perceptive directors as Ridley Scott, Tim Robbins, Walter Hill, Steve Kloves, Phil Kaufman, Jack Clayton, William Peter Blatty, Sydney Pollack, Robert Aldrich, Dale Rosenbloom and Krzysztof Zanussi have cast Wilson in important roles. Wilson will soon be seen in The Last Samurai with Tom Cruise directed by Edward Zwick and Monster with Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci directed by Patty Jenkins. Wilson lives in Los Angeles and has been married for 26 years to his wife, Heavenly, attorney, artist and writer.\n\nVeronica Cartwright\n\nBorn in England, Veronica is the older sister of popular Television child actress Angela Cartwright. In her early career, she was cast in a number of popular films such as The Children's Hour (1961), Spencer's Mountain (1963) and Hitchcock's The Birds (1963). As such, she was cast as Jemima Boone in the popular Television series \"Daniel Boone\" which ran from 1964-66. Her career after \"Boone\" may have been influenced by Hitchcock as she appeared in both the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and the horror classic Alien (1979). On Television, she would appear sporadically as the Lumpy's younger sister, Violet Rutherford on \"Leave It to Beaver (1960)\" and have a small role in the Television movie \"Still the Beaver (1983)\". She would also appear in \"Robert Kennedy & His Times (1985)\", \"Tanner '88' (1988)\" and have a recurring role on \"L.A. Law (1986)\". Her big screen features would include The Right Stuff (1983), Flight of the Navigator (1986) and The Witches of Eastwick (1987). Veronica would work on the stage in \"Electra\", \"Talley's Folly\", \"Homesteaders\", \"Butterflies are Free\" and \"The Triplet Connection\". Alternating between Television and big screen movies in the 90's, she appears in such films as Hitler's Daughter (1990) (TV) and Candyman 2 (1995).\n\nDonald Moffat\n\nRADA alumnus Donald Moffat made his London stage debut in 1954, playing the First Murderer in MacBeth. On stage, the wiry, angular Moffat excelled in the plays of Ibsen and Moliere; on screen, he has since carved his niche in eccentric, unpredictable roles. He has also sparkled in authoritative characterizations, both bombastic (a tantrum-tossing LBJ in 1981's The Right Stuff, a fascistic Colonel Ruppert in the 1991 TV movie Babe Ruth) and cool-headed (the fictional U.S. president in 1993's A Clear and Present Danger, Kennedy in-law Hugh Auchincloss in the 1982 video presentation Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy). In addition, Moffat has brightened many a Robert Altman production, most prominently as the ubiquitous bike-riding tax collector in Popeye (1980). Donald Moffat's TV-series resumé includes such roles as an immigrant Scandinavian minister in The New Land (1974), a lovable android in Logan's Run (1977), and all-knowing Dr. Marcus Polk on the ABC daytimer One Life to Live. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nSTONE READER\n\nDow Mossman\n\nAuthor of the Stones of Summer, and surprise guest at Ebertfest, Dow Mossman is enjoying the belated success and celebrity of his his first book, published in 1972!\n\nMark Moskowitz\n\nMark Moskowitz is known for his issue-oriented media, including more than three thousand political spots for hundreds of races nationally and worldwide.
