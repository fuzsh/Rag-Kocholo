        "text": "Aurora has changed a lot since Allison Sie relocated there from New Jersey with her family and then moved away, “many, many moons” ago. For one, the city’s Asian population grew to 4.37 percent, nearly twice as large as Denver’s, according to the 2000 census.\n\nSo the actor-producer’s homecoming will be particularly poignant next week when she attends the opening night of the Ninth Aurora Asian Film Festival (Thursday through Sunday). Sie, the daughter of philanthropist and Starz Encore founder John J. Sie, plays Aurora Crane in director Eric Byler’s romantic drama “Americanese” (7 p.m. Thursday).\n\nAs one of the film’s producers, Sie didn’t want to overexpose the movie on the festival circuit.\n\n“But when I found out there was Aurora, I asked if we could take time out to form our strategy, because that’s my hometown,” she says on the phone from Los Angeles. “I wasn’t even aware of the new Asian-American community there.”\n\nGone is much of the cracking wise in Shawn Wong’s 1995 novel, “American Knees.” Byler has crafted a moody, subtly wry study of broken relationships. Wong must be pleased with the outcome. He’s scheduled to appear opening night at the Fox Arts Center on East Colfax Avenue along with Byler, Sie and co-star Chris Tashima.\n\n“Americanese” begins as professor Raymond Ding (Tashima) moves into a new apartment. He’s relinquished his old one to younger ex-lover Aurora. Still, when she leaves for work, he uses his keys and floats into the place more a melancholy ghost than a stalker.\n\nTashima’s performance could lead the uninitiated to think Raymond is passive, if not passive-aggressive.\n\nIn an online piece about masculinity and “Americanese,” cultural critic Jeff Yang writes “the concept that Byler finds so appealing is probably closest to one that’s at the heart of Japanese culture and especially Japan’s culture of masculinity: ‘gaman,’ which can loosely be defined as the ability to endure, persist or persevere in the face of adversity and to do one’s best at times of frustration.”\n\nSie knows a counterpart for Raymond. “No one questions why we think Jeff Bridges is attractive,” she says. “He’s a certain type of man. He’s not a god, or gorgeous. He’s an everyday white American man, but he has something. I wanted to bring the Asian-American version of a Bridges to the screen.”\n\nOnce Crane heads to her parents’ home in Boulder, she wrestles with her father’s racial chauvinism. While she weathers bumpy hapa epiphanies (hapa comes from the Hawaiian designation for half white – “hapa haole”), Ding sets off on a different journey. He courts fellow professor Betty Nguyen.\n\nJoan Chen continues to do revealing work in indie films. Here, she plays Nguyen with a vivid, troubling mix of the forthright and the wincingly unhinged.\n\nAmong other films:\n\n“Mongolian Ping Pong” (7 p.m. Friday) is near-perfect family fare. When Bilike finds a ping-pong ball floating in a river, he and friends Dawa and Erguotou don’t know what to make of the feather-light orb. Bilike’s grandmother confirms the youngster’s suspicion that it is a treasure from upstream spirits. Later, thanks to a TV transmission as pure as driven snow, they learn the ping-pong ball is China’s “national ball.” Director Ning Hao delivers a lovely movie played against a humbling horizon of vast grasslands and shifting skies.\n\nSingapore director Eric Khoo’s “Be With Me” (6:30 p.m. Saturday) requires quiet and rewards patience. Seemingly disparate visions of thwarted love come together thanks to Theresa Chan, whose novel inspired the film. Chan, who plays herself, became deaf and blind as an adolescent.\n\nThe festival’s 11 films, including a free outdoor screening of “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” are presented in their original languages with English subtitles. Except for the outdoor film, all movies are shown at the Aurora Fox Arts Center, 9900 E. Colfax Ave.\n\nIndividual tickets $5-$8; festival pass $75; ticket information and schedule at auroraasian.org or denverfilm.org, or 303-326-8695."
