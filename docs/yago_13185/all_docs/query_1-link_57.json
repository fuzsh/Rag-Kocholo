Despite fears of reprisal, a group of citizens launches a ‘virtual resistance’ using social media, setting up a final showdown with the law’s advocates.”\n\nFarmageddon: The Unseen War on American Family Farms (a film by Kristin Canty) [HD1476.A3 F36 2011 DVD] – “Documented is the story of family farms who were providing healthy foods to their communities and were forced to stop by agents of misguided government bureaucracies.”\n\nChasing Madoff (Cohen Media Group presents; a Jeff Prosserman production; produced, written and directed by Jeff Prosserman) [HV6692.M33 C495 2012 DVD] – “Presents an account of how Harry Markopolos and his team of investigators uncovered Bernard Madoff’s investment fraud empire.”\n\nNo Way Out But One (a Garland Waller production ; produced and directed by Garland Waller, Barry Nolan ; written by Barry Nolan, Garland Waller) [HV6603.C65 N62 2012 DVD] – “Tells the story of Holly Collins, the first American to be granted asylum by the Dutch government as a result of domestic violence.

Through the story of Holly Collins, a larger and more shocking national scandal is revealed. In American family courts, all too often, abusers get custody of their children.”\n\nThe Island President (After Image Public Media presents; an Actual Films production in association with Ford Foundation and Impact Partners; directed by Jon Shenk; produced by Richard Berge, Bonni Cohen) [QC981.8.G56 I85 2012 DVD] – “Jon Shenk’s The Island President tells the story of President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives, a man confronting a problem greater than any other world leader has ever faced–the literal survival of his country and everyone in it. After bringing democracy to the Maldives after thirty years of despotic rule, Nasheed is now faced with an even greater challenge: as one of the most low-lying countries in the world, a rise of three feet in sea level would submerge the 1200 islands of the Maldives enough to make them uninhabitable. The Island President captures Nasheed’s first year of office, culminating in his trip to the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009, where the film provides a rare glimpse of the political horse-trading that goes on at such a top-level global assembly.”\n\nYoung Mr. Lincoln (20th Century Fox; Twentieth Century Fox presents Darryl F.

A friend of Toño’s contacted two young lawyers, Roberto Hernández and Layda Negrete, who gained prominence in Mexico when they helped bring about the release of another innocent man from prison. Looking into Toño’s case, Roberto and Layda managed to get a retrial–on camera–and enlisted the help of filmmaker Geoffrey Smith to chronicle the saga. Shot over three years with unprecedented access to the Mexican courts and prisons, this dramatic story is a searing indictment of a justice system that presumes guilt.”\n\nForks Over Knives (Monica Beach Media presents; written and directed by Lee Fulkerson; executive producer, Brian Wendel; producer, John Corry; a Monica Beach Media production) [RA645.N87 F67 2011 DVD] – “This film examines the claim that most if not all degenerative diseases that afflict us can be controlled, or even reversed, by rejecting animal-based and processed foods. It traces the personal journeys of a pair of pioneering researchers, Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn. Although they didn’t know each other, their individual research led to startlingly similar conclusions: degenerative diseases could usually be prevented–and in many cases reversed–by adopting a whole food, plant-based diet.”\n\nLaw Reserve Collection\n\nKnow Your Rights (American Bar Association) [KF4842 .K66 2012 DVD] – “Presents overview of the American legal system’s immigration removal process to help people who have received a notice to appear (NTA) or who are detained currently understand their rights and what to expect during the process.”\n\nThe Naked Option: A Last Resort (writer, producer, director, Candace Schermerhorn) [HD9577.N52 N35 2010 DVD] – “Provides an intimate, candid, visual observation of the realities of daily life in these oil-soaked communities.
