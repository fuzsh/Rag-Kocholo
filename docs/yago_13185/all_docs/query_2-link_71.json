        "text": "24th San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival\n\nSee the latest San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival\n\nDate: March 16-26, 2006\n\nLocations: San Francisco, Berkeley, San Jose\n\nTickets\n\n$10 General Admission\n\n$7 NAATA Members\n\n$8 Student/Seniors (65+)/Disabled\n\nSpecial Deals - Castro Pass, Festival 6 Pack, Win Tickets , Buy Warriors vs Rockets Tickets and see Yao Ming live.\n\nFor more information, call 415.865.1588 or go to Order Tickets\n\nMore festival info\n\nWith almost 130 films and videos from over 20 countries, the 24th San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival (SFIAAFF) spans the globe to offer the largest and most prestigious showcase of movies by and about Asians and Asian Americans. The festival unspool March 16-26 in San Francisco (AMC Kabuki 8 and Castro Theatre), and the Berkeley (Pacific Film Archive) and San Jose (Camera 12 Cinemas).\n\nThe Festival is pleased to open with Eric Byler’s Americanese. A decade after its publication, Shawn Wong’s seminal novel on contemporary Asian American love – American Knees - is brought to life on the silver screen by writer/director Eric Byler (CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES/SFIAAFF ‘03). Screening at the landmark Castro Theatre in San Francisco, with an allstar cast including Joan Chen, Kelly Hu, Sab Shimono, Michael Paul Chan and Chris Tashima, Americanese represents a triumph of Asian American cinema – a frank, provocative tale of love, sex and race in the adult world. Raymond (Chris Tashima, VISAS AND VIRTUE) is a fortyyear-old, divorced Chinese American college professor struggling with his recent breakup with the younger, half-Japanese Aurora (Allison Sie). For Raymond, Aurora needs to recognize her own Asian identity; Aurora, however, would have preferred a lover, not a course in ethnic studies. As Aurora begins dating a Caucasian man, Raymond embarks on a new relationship with a Vietnamese co-worker (Joan Chen/SAVING FACE SFIAAFF ‘05) with a troubled history of her own. Struggling with their own pasts, lonely in their respective presents, each character seeks something more for the future in the dramatic tale of Asian American masculinity and love. Following the film, the festival gets off to a lively start with the official Asian Art Museum Opening Night Gala at the Museum.\n\nThe San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival is pleased to present three stunning feature films from mainland China – all unique visions which represent an exciting new generation of Chinese filmmaking. Lu Chuan’s (MISSING GUN) Kekexili: Mountain Patrol is a spectacular, Western-inspired and ecologically aware tale of survival and morality of a mountain patrol’s harrowing pursuit of a group of ruthless poachers, set in the rugged expanse of the Tibetan Plateau. Unfolding over the course of twenty years, Xu Jinglei’s (SPICY LOVE SOUP/SFIAAFF 99) Letter from an Unknown Woman is a gorgeously photographed tale of unrequited love and passion chronicling the life of a woman in wartime China whose love for a man ultimately consumes her. Soon-hee is a Korean Chinese single mother who illegally sells kimchee to survive, all the while protecting her son from the harsh realities of being an ethnic minority in China. The patient kimchee peddler discovers that she does have her limits in Zhang Lu’s Grain in Ear, an intricately orchestrated minimalist drama.\n\nAdditionally, from master Taiwanese director, Hou Hsiao-hsien, the Festival is pleased to present Café Lumiere, a luminous portrait of contemporary Japan, which Hou made in homage to Japanese film director Yasujiro Ozu. Set entirely in Japan and starring Tadanobu Asano (LAST LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE), CAFÉ LUMIERE charts the story of a young woman who returns home from Taiwan, to confront her pregnancy, her family, and to revive old friendships. Also of interest is special sneak preview screening of Micha X. Peled’s China Blue, a revelatory and eye-opening exploration of the inner-workings of China’s many garment factories. Millions of young people are leaving their rural villages and flocking to the big cities of southern China, lured by the prospect of participating in the burgeoning “New China” economy.\n\nThe Festival will once again recognize the extraordinary achievements of Asian American filmmakers through its Juried Narrative and Documentary Competitions. Showing in this year’s competitions are three fictional films and two documentaries, by Chinese Americans or about the Chinese experience. Chinese custom has it that red doors will bring good luck into one’s home. Georgia Lee’s (EDUCATED, SFIAAFF ‘03), phenomenal first feature Red Doors tells the quirky and compelling story of a disconnected Chinese American family who could use just a little more luck. RED DOORS, a prize-winner at the Tribeca Film Festival, stars Tzi Ma (RUSH HOUR) and Jacqueline Kim (CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES, SFIAAFF ’03). Two\n\nChinese Canadian sisters must navigate a 1970’s childhood of playground racists, Catholic school and ill-fitting polyester in Julia Kwan’s impressive debut feature, Eve & the Fire Horse, recipient of a Special Jury Prize at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. Born in the year of the fire horse (notorious for producing troubled children), nine-yearold Eve finds herself between two worlds, the relative safety of her family home, where her parents and grandmother listen to old Cantonese 45’s and put Buddha figures on the mantle, and the uncertain outside realm of Vancouver, where disco and Jesus rule. Frank Lin’s Amaerican Fusion delicately blends the sweetness of a middle-aged love story with the irreverent, envelope-pushing comedy of a Farrelly Brothers movie. Sylvia Chang (20:30:40/SFIAAFF ‘05) plays Yvonne, a divorcee in her forties who sets out to find true happiness; unfortunately her raucous family may be standing in her way. Cheuk Kwan’s globetrotting survey of family Chinese restaurants has turned the search for a good place to eat into a tribute to the resilience and adaptability of the Chinese Diaspora. Following up on the sold-out success of SONG OF THE EXILE (SFIAAFF ‘04) and THREE CONTINENTS (SFIAAFF ‘05), Chinese Restaurants : Latin Passions focuses on remarkable individuals and eateries in Peru, Brazil and Argentina. In the fall of 2004, Chinese American rapper Jin Au-Yeung -- the first Asian American signed to a major hip-hop label -- embarked on an eight-city tour of Asia with stops in Shanghai, Tokyo, Taipei and Singapore. Todd Angkasuwan’s No Sleep til Shanghai follows Jin back to the so-called “motherland” where his experience is marked by equal parts awe and ambivalence, especially when it comes to understanding his relationship to fans that look like him, but come from wildly different backgrounds.\n\nFrom the isle of Hong Kong and presented in conjunction with the Pacific Film Archive, “Heroic Grace; The Chinese Martial Arts Film, Part 2” features a quartet of classic martial arts films, many of them restored to their former glory, that are stand outs in the enormously creative martial arts cinema of the Seventies. On the action-packed, bodytwisting bill are Chu Yuan’s Clans of Intrigue (1977), Chung Chang-wha’s King Boxer (1972), Zhang Che and Bao Xueli’s The Boxer from Shantung (1972), and Lau Kar-leung’s Dirty Ho (1979).\n\nAttending a film festival is about more than simply seeing a movie. It’s about opportunities for dialogue, interaction and full cultural immersion. Looking at how far portrayals of Asian American men have come since the days of Charlie Chan and Fu Manchu, “Is Charlie Chan Dead? Asian American Men on Screen” examines the history of Asian American men in movies. Immediately following a screening of Jeff Adachi’s documentary The Slanted Screen, a panel of actors, academics and filmmakers will discuss the politics of representing Asian American men, the experiences of actors themselves and the complicated history governing media portrayals in Hollywood. Also of interest is “From Novel To The Big Screen: American Knees To Americanese,” a panel discussion featuring filmmaker Eric Byler and author Shawn Wong in discussion about the creative and collaborative process. Accompanied by film clips, Byler and Wong will discuss how the AMERICANESE screenplay was written and translated for the screen, exploring topics ranging from a filmmaker’s artistic license, to casting, to the role of the author in this process.\n\nTo catch a glimpse of tomorrow's new talents, check out the Festival's short film programs. Works by Chinese and Chinese American makers are scattered throughout the following programs: Confessions of Longing, The Life Quixotic, Memoirs of a Sudoku Superstar, Punchards and Preoccupations, and Mystery Arcade.\n\nEight days later at the resplendent Palace of Fine Arts, the curtain closes on the Festival with Journey from the Fall, the feature-length directorial debut from Ham Tran. JOURNEY FROM THE FALL is the first major American film to dramatize the traumatic aftermath of the Vietnam War from a Vietnamese perspective. Unlike Hollywood films with a one-sided focus on the American psyche, Ham Tran’s film, with cinematography from Guillermo Rosas and Julie Kirkwood delves into the stories of those left behind after the fall of Saigon. JOURNEY FROM THE FALL is a tribute to the perseverance and hope of the Vietnamese people, and a testament to the beauty and power of filmmaking. A Gala reception and the highly anticipated Festival Awards Presentation follows at the Palace.\n\nSanFranciscoChinatown.com Picks\n\nInternational\n\nLetter from an Unknown Woman (China)\n\nKekexili:Mountain Patrol (China/Hong Kong)\n\nBe with Me (Singapore)\n\nCafe Lumiere (Japan)\n\nGrain in Ear (South Korea/China)\n\nNorth America\n\nEve & the Fire Horse (Canada)\n\nAmerican Fusion (USA)\n\nAmericanese (USA)\n\nThe Achievers (USA, Wold Premiere)\n\nRed Doors (USA)\n\nHong Kong Classics\n\nClans of Intrigue\n\nDirty Ho\n\nThe Boxer from Shantung (Newly Restored)\n\nKing Boxer aka Five Fingers of Death (Newly Restored)\n\nShort films\n\nMemoirs of a Sudoku Superstar\n\nPunchards and Preoccupations\n\nConfessions of Longing\n\nThe Life Quixotic\n\nMystery Arcade\n\nDocumentaries\n\nNo Sleep Til Shanghai (USA)\n\nThe Slanted Screen (USA)\n\nChina Blue (USA, China)\n\nChinese Restaurants: Latin Passions (Canada, North American Premiere)\n\nGrassroots Rising (USA)\n\nFor more information, call 415.865.1588 or go to Order Tickets\n\nMore festival info\n\nSpecial Deals\n\nAvailable at\n\nKabuki 8 Box Office - 1881 Post St., San Francisco\n\nmail - SFIAAFF Box Office,\n\n145 Ninth Street, Suite 350\n\nSan Francisco, CA 94103\n\nfax - 415.522.5543\n\nSanFranciscoChinatown.com Festival 6 Pack\n\nSix films for only $50\n\nOffer valid from February 20 - March 10, 2006\n\nRedeem Vouchers early because shows will sell out.
