I am curious, why does "vacuum" have two "u's?" I am aware that it is a Latin-derived-Word, so therefore it was probably pronounced [wakwum], logically. Is this correct? I can understand us English speakers maintaining the original spelling, and then pronouncing it as any of: [vacym~vakym~vacjum~vakjum~vacjʌm], because of our willingness to preserve the original spelling*, but why do other languages maintain the the two "u's" also? Or, because I am unaware of Latin spelling, was it pronounced: [wakuːm] or potentially [wakwuːm].

*for instance, how words that maintained "-tjon (-tion)" like "Nation." We opted to continue to spell them "natjon~nation" for preservation of the original spelling, and keep saying [naˑsjon~nasjon], rather than spelling it "nacion," as some languages opted, to preserve the hint of the words' latin origins.

The Latin vacuum is the nominative neuter singular form of the adjective vacuus 'empty'. Both words had and still have three syllables each, that is, both Us are pronounced as separate vowels, and yes, both words have hiatus. That is why the transcription of vacuum in Classical Latin is:

vacuum /ˈwa.ku.um/, [ˈwa.kʊ.ʊm]

The reason why there are two Us is that the word is formed from the verb vacō (“I am empty, void”) +‎ -uus (“adjective-forming suffix”).
