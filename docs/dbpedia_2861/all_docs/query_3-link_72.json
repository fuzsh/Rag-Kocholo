For a variety of reasons, this is undesirable, and I want R to be English.\n\nWhat works\n\nI am able to use LANGUAGE=en as a command line option for the R console desktop shortcut, but the language is still wrong in Rstudio, which launches the R executable directly and hence ignores the command line arguments in the shortcut.\n\nWhat doesn't work\n\nI have tried creating an .Renviron file under C:\\Users\\[MY_NAME]\\Documents, which is the path returned for the working directory by getwd(), with LANGUAGE=en in it. R ignores this. My R_ENVIRON and R_ENVIRON_USER variables show up as \"\" so .Renviron should be the correct filename.\n\nI have also tried creating .Renviron under R_HOME\\etc (R_HOME points to C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-215~1.0) and R also ignores it.\n\nI was somewhat successful with adding Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE=\"en\") in R_HOME\\etc - this made all output from the R console English, except for the initial copyright information.\n\nThe question\n\nHow can I make R default to English such that this is propagated to RStudio?"
