Niels Bohr Library & Archives.\n\nPapers created by\n\nAmerican Vacuum Society\n\nSize of collection\n\n1 linear foot\n\n2 manuscript boxes\n\nShort description of collection\n\nPublications of the American Vacuum Society (AVS) that include reports, symposium materials, and newsletters.\n\nLanguage(s) of collection\n\nEnglish\n\nCollection number:\n\nAR20111013\n\nHistorical Note\n\nA professional society formed in 1953 to promote communication among people interested in high vacuum technology through symposia and publications. Originally formed as the Committee on Vacuum Techniques and mandated to initiate a symposium and develop programs for education and recommend standards. Name changed at 1957 symposium to American Vacuum Society, the society became an affiliate member of the American Institute of Physics in 1963, and a full member in 1976.\n\nScope and Contents of Collection\n\nThe collection contains miscellaneous publications printed by the American Vacuum Society (AVS) for their members, and include reports and newsletters.\n\nRestrictions on Use and Access\n\nResearchers must have an approved access application on file in order to access archival materials. https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/item-request.\n\nSelected Search Terms\n\nThese papers have been indexed in the International Catalog of Sources for History of Physics and Allied Sciences (ICOS) using the following terms. Those seeking related materials should search under these terms.\n\nInstitutions\n\nAmerican Vacuum Society.\n\nSubject terms\n\nPhysics. Publishing.\n\nPhysics. Societies, etc.\n\nGenre terms\n\nNewsletters.\n\nOrganization and Arrangement of Collection\n\nThe collection is organized by type with reports followed by symposium materials and newsletters. Reports are arranged alphabetically, while newsletters are in chronological order.\n\nProvenance and Acquisition Information\n\nCollection is added to on an annual basis as new publications are received.\n\nProcessing Information\n\nThis collection was processed by Amanda Nelson in 2016.\n\nAll American Vacuum Society miscellaneous publications accessioned before 2011 have been incorporated into the American Vacuum Society Records, 1953-2007.\n\nPreferred Citation of Collection\n\nBox [number], Folder [number], American Vacuum Society miscellaneous publications, 1980-2015.
