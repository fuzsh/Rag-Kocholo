        "text": "The Plan for Fall\n\nArlington collects about 50,000 cubic yards of leaves every year. Months ahead, staff analyzes historic data, tree types and density, weather forecasts, state forestry forecasts and resident feedback to develop the leaf collection schedule.\n\nDid You Know? You can compost leaves in your yard, creating nutrient-rich mulch for spring flower beds and trees. Leaves collected by the County are turned into mulch available for free pick-up or delivery at a nominal cost.\n\nFall 2023 Leaf Vacuum Schedule\n\nTwo Passes per Civic Association Zone\n\nRoutes run Monday – Saturday including holidays except Thanksgiving.\n\nTwo passes per civic association. (Arlington civic associations map)\n\nView the in-season leaf vacuum collection status map\n\nSchedule Information\n\nSign up for leaf schedule Listserv email updates.\n\nLook for neighborhood signs posted three to seven days before each pass by civic association. The first pass is in November (bright yellow); the second pass is in December (orange). Note: The date on the sign marks the beginning of the leaf collection window. Leaves may not actually be collected on that date, but should be left at the curb from that date until they are collected.\n\nMissed a collection? Bag leaves for the next weekly collection or wait for the second vacuum pass.\n\nHow to Prepare for Vacuuming\n\nRake leaves to curb the weekend before the posted start of zone collection (residents with contract lawn services should plan ahead).\n\nDon’t block roadways with leaves more than seven days in advance of a scheduled vacuum leaf collection as it can interfere with traction, blocks traffic, limits street parking and is a potential fire hazard.\n\nPile leaves away from storm drains, water meter covers, low wires and parked cars.\n\nRemove stones, litter, branches and other debris from leaves to prevent equipment damage and worker injuries.\n\nDon’t place leaves in plastic bags or trash carts.\n\nNever park your car on leaf piles — it’s a fire hazard.\n\nDrive slowly around leaf trucks, especially when passing.\n\nAlways look out for children playing in and around curbside leaf piles.\n\nBiodegradable Bag / Green Cart Collection\n\nLeaf bags are collected year-round on your regular weekly curbside collection day. Leaves can, naturally, also go in the green yard waste cart.\n\nHow to Prepare for Collection\n\nPlace paper leaf bags/green cart at the curb no earlier than 5 p.m. the day before your regular collection day and no later than 6 a.m. on collection day.\n\nRemove any stones, litter and other debris from your leaves.\n\nClose bags by folding them top down.\n\nNever use plastic bags for yard waste—they can't be composted and won't be collected\n\nBiodegradable paper leaf bags are available at most hardware stores. Or you can use any bags left over from the spring.\n\nFree paper yard waste bags are available from Arlington County during posted spring and fall seasonal dates.\n\nMissed or Partial Pickup"
