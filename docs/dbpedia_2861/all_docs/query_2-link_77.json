        "text": "The International Union for Vacuum Science, Technique and Applications (IUVSTA) is an international federation of national vacuum organizations (i.e. vacuum societies or national committees on vacuum), currently 30 in number, which had its origin in June 1958 in Namur, Belgium. It is an official international association registered in compliance with Belgian law. Each of the member countries is represented by a councillor at Executive Council meetings, which normally take place about every 6 months and by up to 3 delegates at a General Meeting which is usually held every 3 years. Individual or private membership is excluded.\n\nThe purpose of the IUVSTA is to promote vacuum science and technology on an international level. This includes promotion of vacuum education and research, the establishment of international vacuum standards and the organization of international congresses, conferences and workshops. It encourages the establishment of national vacuum societies or committees on vacuum in countries where, up until now, no such national group exists."
