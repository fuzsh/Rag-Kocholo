        "text": "At the American Vacuum Society (AVS) Mid-Atlantic Virtual Chapter Meeting in April, students competed with one another through oral presentations for a cash prize.\n\nTwo students from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering won top honors. The two winners were Alexander Goldstone and Zhenyi Ye — both PhD candidates in the department. The two students will have the chance to compete in the AVS International Symposium this year in Charlotte, North Carolina. Professor Qiliang Li served as the lead advisor for both presentations.\n\n“In the wake of the discovery of graphene, the search for new and remarkable 2D materials with astounding electronic and mechanical properties has led to the fabrication of germanene, a 2D germanium allotrope similar to silicene,” says Goldstone. His presentation was titled “Analysis of various passivation species on Germanene AC and ZZ Nanoribbon physical structure and band structure.” The study indicated the engineered Germanene nanoribbons are promising for next-generation nanoelectronics.\n\nThe title of Ye’s presentation was “Embedding Learning from Odor Using Cost-effective E-Nose. Ye says that “E-nose is a device based on gas sensors that can fingerprint patterns for a specific gas. It is an emulation of a human olfactory system involving multiple technologies” This study represented significant progress in developing precise and intelligent electronic noses.\n\nAbout AVS\n\nAVS is a non-profit, volunteer-driven, interdisciplinary organization that is dedicated to advancing the science and technology of vacuum, materials, surfaces, interfaces, thin films, and plasmas. The AVS supports networking among academic, industrial, government, and consulting professionals involved in a variety of disciplines.\n\nLinks to the winners' full presentations:\n\nZhenyi Ye – 5 min highest honors\n\nTitle “Embedding Learning from Odor Using Cost-effective E-Nose”\n\nAlexander Goldstone – 5 min high honors"
