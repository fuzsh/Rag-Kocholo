Blaise Pascal was a renowned mathematician, known for his contributions in number theory, geometry, and the theory of probability. In this volume Pascal explains his theory on pressure and presents an outline of a hydrostatic system.\n\n\"The philosophical works of the Honourable Robert Boyle Esq\" (London, 1725) Robert Boyle was a chemist and natural philosopher. Not only was he known for his theories regarding experimentation but also for his experimental practices. He developed the vacuum pump and helped to found the Royal Society of London, but is best known for Boyle's Law - the pressure of a confined quantity of gas varies inversely with its volume.\n\n\"Technica curiosa sive mirabilis artis\" by Gaspar Schott (Nuremberg, 1687)\n\nGaspar Schott was a professor of mathematics. This work popularized the scientific discoveries of Boyle and von Guericke.\n\nCirculating and Reserve Items: (Non-circulating indicated by double asterisk **)\n\nAbanat, Robert, et. al., High vacuum industry, Marvin Grossman, 1953\n\nAlbe, E.E.
