        "text": "It’s easy to suppose that the way we talk to one another is steadily coarsening in our modern America. The grand old four-letter words seem to be used as punctuation. To many, younger people’s speech sounds messy and unconsidered, a kind of linguistic equivalent of bedhead. Twitter is full of perfectly normal people being recreationally nasty.\n\nYet in truth, when I listen to America talking in our times, I hear an encroaching sweetness, a flowering of deference. I know, I know — but hear (read) me out?\n\nWe are all familiar with uptalk, in which people intone statements the way they would questions. To older heads, this often sounds as if people are doing nothing but asking questions? — instead of just talking? — which to them can seem not only unconfident but also unintelligent (?).\n\nBut what has happened is that the question melody has extended its range into statements. People use the question melody as a way of asking whether another person is following their point. It’s as if they appended “You know what I mean?” to the end of the statement but it faded away, leaving only its question melody behind, like the Cheshire cat’s smile.\n\nUptalk, then, involves acknowledging other people’s presence and marking their engagement and interest. It’s quite menschy, if you ask me. I remember the first time I heard a young woman doing uptalk one cloudy day in 1987 and thinking that as quirky as it sounded, she seemed too confident in what she was saying to be thought of as asking questions. She was just highly engaged with her friends.\n\nThe infamous usage of “like” is a similar story. It’s easy to hear nothing but hedging in it — “That was, like, not a great thing to do.” But a linguist can break (and has broken) the new “like” down into assorted usages beyond hedging. For example, if a guy says, “We looked in, and it was so crowded. And not just a few kids. There were, like, grandparents and cousins in there. We had to go somewhere else,” he isn’t hedging; he’s stressing his point. The function of “like” there is to imply, “You might think it was just some kids, but actually ….” He is thinking about the state of mind of his interlocutors as he speaks.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
