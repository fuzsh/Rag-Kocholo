        "text": "I'm not British but I maybe can help. Hoover is a well-known brand of vacuum cleaners. So it is sometimes (more often in the past, I think) used instead of \"vacuum.\" I haven't ever heard it used as a verb, only as a noun.\n\nHere in the U.S. it would be very unusual to use that word (unless you were maybe someone older); I don't know about Britain. \"I need to vacuum\" sounds just right; \"use the vacuum cleaner,\" while grammatically correct, isn't how people say it (again, here).\n\nI have never heard anyone in the US, regardless of age, speak of \"hoovering\" a rug instead of \"vacuuming\" it. I have always thought of using \"hoover\" to mean \"vacuum\" to be a British usage.\n\nNeither have I. Here, Hoover is a brand of vacuum cleaners and that's it. Americans say \"vacuum\" generally. However, I have always said \"sweeper\". For some reason, a lot of people around here don't vacuum, they run the sweeper. No idea where that came from.\n\nIf you use the search function on this thread, you will see that this topic has been treated exhaustively in the past. So much so, in fact, that the life has been hoovered out of it.\n\nSee, for example, hoover.\n\nI did see that thread, indeed (I by no means aim to waste anyone's time y'see!). But there were mostly replies by Americans, hence my new thread asking specifically!\n\nThanks for all your replies!\n\nI'm reviving this discussion because at the moment in the Italian-English forum we're drawing up a list of words where the British and American translations are different.\n\nWhat has surprised me is that \"hoover\" is being indicated as the British term, while \"vacuum-cleaner\" is given as the American term. I grew up in south-east England and in our family, which was not particularly enthusiastic about adopting americanisms, \"vacuum-cleaner\" was perfectly normal. I was aware that many families used \"hoover\", but if I said \"vacuum-cleaner\" no one was surprised. I don't know if it's changed since I've been in Italy (since 1977), but I'd like to know what other Brits think.\n\nI see from this and the other threads that both terms exist in the USA too, but that \"hoover\" has gone out of fashion (but would still be understood). Sometimes I wonder if we look for AmE/BrE differences where they don't exist, or exist only vaguely."
