        "text": "AVS: Science and Technology of Materials, Interfaces, and Processing[3] (formerly American Vacuum Society[4]) is a not-for-profit learned society founded in 1953 focused on disciplines related to materials, interfaces, and processing. AVS has approximately 4500 members worldwide from academia, governmental laboratories and industry.\n\nQuick Facts Abbreviation, Formation ...\n\nClose\n\nAVS is a member society of the American Institute of Physics.[3] AVS publishes through the American Institute of Physics the journals Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology (JVST A and B) and Biointerphases, which are devoted to peer-reviewed articles, and Surface Science Spectra (SSS), which publishes peer-reviewed articles with reference spectra of technological and scientific interest. In 2019 American Institute of Physics and AVS launched jointly a new journal, AVS Quantum Science.[5]\n\nAVS is composed of 10 technical divisions, two technical groups, 16 regional chapters, two international chapters and one international affiliate:\n\nAdvanced Surface Engineering Division[6]\n\nApplied Surface Science Division[7]\n\nBiomaterial Interfaces Division[8]\n\nElectronic Materials/Photonics Division[9]\n\nMagnetic Interfaces and Nanostructures Division[10]\n\nNanometer-Scale Science and Technology Division\n\nPlasma Science and Technology Division[11]\n\nSurface Science Division[12]\n\nThin Film Division (TF)[13]\n\nVacuum Technology Division[14]\n\nAVS Technical Groups Division\n\nManufacturing Science & Technology Technical Group (MSTG)\n\nMEMS and NEMS Technical Group\n\nThe AVS International Symposium and Exhibition is AVS's flagship conference. The symposium addresses cutting-edge issues associated with materials, processing, and interfaces in the research and manufacturing communities. AVS also sponsors a variety of topical conferences, including the International Conference on Atomic Layer Deposition and the North American Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy.\n\nDorothy Hoffman Award[15]\n\nMedard W. Welch Award\n\nJohn A. Thornton Memorial Award & Lecture\n\nRussell and Sigurd Varian Award\n\nDorothy M. and Earl S. Hoffman Award\n\nNellie Yeoh Whetten Award\n\nDorothy M. and Earl S. Hoffman Scholarship\n\nGraduate Research Award (GRA)"
