        "text": "Accumulating evidence shows how language context shapes bilingual language use (Elston-Güttler & Gunter, 2009; Kreiner & Degani, 2015) and its consequences for broader cognition (Green & Abutalebi, 2013). In contrast, little attention has focused on the impact of language context for monolinguals. Monolinguals’ language processing is assumed to be relatively stable and homogeneous. Yet an emerging body of research has cast doubt on this assumption. Some studies have demonstrated that monolinguals are less homogeneous than assumed by revealing large individual differences in electrophysiological responses during language processing (Pakulak & Neville, 2010; Tanner & Van Hell, 2014). Others studies have shown changes to the native language in late second language learning, even at early stages of learning (Bice & Kroll, 2015; Kroll, Dussias, Bice, & Perrotti, 2015). Critically, learning can occur even in the absence of attention or intention to learn, with increasing sensitivity to novel languages though exposure alone (Gullberg, Roberts, Dimroth, Veroude, & Indefrey, 2010; Saffran, Newport, Aslin, Tunick, & Barrueco, 1997). Monolinguals living in linguistically diverse communities regularly overhear languages that they neither understand nor speak, but may still learn something about their sounds and features. While many past studies have shown that learning can proceed under implicit conditions (Morgan-Short, Steinhauer, Sanz, & Ullman, 2012), few have addressed how the contexts from which learners are drawn may contribute to the pattern of observed results.\n\nHere we report data on the impact of ambient linguistic diversity on the ability of monolinguals to acquire a novel language. We compared monolinguals in two different contexts: a relatively homogeneous unilingual context in which English is the predominant language (central Pennsylvania), and a linguistically diverse community in which multiple languages are spoken (southern California). The opportunity to examine the consequence of the linguistic context for learning was serendipitous, the result of a lab move across the country. Data were collected as part of a larger project in which both bilingual and monolingual speakers were recruited. In the findings that we report, we focus on participants in each context who considered themselves functionally monolingual. At the same time, the study was not designed explicitly to investigate this issue and in the results and discussion that follow we consider some of the resulting limitations.\n\nIn a strict sense, linguistic diversity refers to a plethora of different languages spoken within the same context. However, this context does not exist in a vacuum, but instead has many natural consequences for those living within the context that require the definition of linguistic diversity to be extended. For example, those living in linguistically diverse contexts may have greater exposure to non-native languages, more opportunities to learn and practice using other languages, more interactions with accented speakers of the majority language, and changes in the perceived value of knowing more languages or in what it means to be bilingual. Importantly, the ambient nature of linguistic diversity can be largely passive, and does not necessarily require community members to actively engage in learning or seek out these opportunities to be impacted by it. We therefore use the term ambient linguistic diversity in describing how these contexts are different, yet the term encompasses the many other consequences for the speakers in those contexts as well.\n\nMonolingual Differences\n\nThe traditional view of the native language assumes very high proficiency arising from a robust and stable language network that is unperturbed by experience. While language experience and variation impact the acquisition process during development (e.g., Foulkes, Docherty, & Watt, 2018; Smith, Durham, & Fortune, 2007), monolingual children have sufficient (~100%) exposure to extrapolate and distill the language to a stable and uniform representation, such that as adults, their language network is relatively similar to other monolinguals’ and relatively unmodified by continued exposure. Interestingly, much of the research on language acquisition in children suggests that greater variability and diversity facilitates acquisition (Legate & Yang, 2007). Among adults, differences in native language performance are often ascribed to constraints on cognitive resources, such as working memory (Just & Carpenter, 1992).\n\nHere, we do not argue that the traditional view is wrong; under typical circumstances, speakers learn the native language to high levels of proficiency. However, we challenge certain assumptions within the traditional view based on recent research. Language processing in monolinguals is not uniformly homogeneous (Tanner & Van Hell, 2014), and differences in native language performance are not always a result of constraints on cognitive resources, but may reflect actual differences in proficiency/fluency (Pakulak & Neville, 2010). Native language processing is also not as stable as typically assumed, as it has been shown to change for proficient bilinguals (Ameel, Malt, Storms, & Van Assche, 2009; Dussias & Sagarra, 2007; Van Hell & Dijkstra, 2002) and for second language learners (Bice & Kroll, 2015; Chang, 2012). The findings that the native language changes in the process of learning a new language also suggests that it is open to the influence of past and new experiences. The phenomenon of language attrition is an extreme example (e.g., Schmid, 2013).\n\nOne study that exemplified many of these assumptions about monolinguals compared electrophysiological responses while monolinguals processed grammatical and ungrammatical sentences (Pakulak & Neville, 2010). Monolinguals were identified as high or low proficiency based on standardized English proficiency tests. They found that proficiency was related to socioeconomic status (SES), highlighting the effects of past and current experience on the native language. The sentences used high frequency, simple structures, and the grammatical violations were overt insertional phrases (“Timmy can ride the horse at my his* farm”), leading to the assumption that detection and processing should be relatively automatic and uniform. Despite that, they found individual differences in both behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs), such that the high proficiency monolinguals performed as expected based on the standard of “native-like” processing, whereas the low proficiency monolinguals were less accurate, with neural responses that were less robust and more varied. They concluded that there are significant individual differences in both automatic and controlled syntactic processing among monolingual native speakers, and that it is important to include participants from a wider and more diverse spectrum of society. The variation in language processing described by Pakulak and Neville can also be found in more restricted samples of college-educated adults, suggesting that the variation in monolingual language processing is typical and not simply a reflection of a single factor such as socioeconomic status (Bice & Kroll, in preparation; Tanner & Van Hell, 2014)\n\nUnder the traditional view, there should be no reason to expect differences between the monolinguals in Pennsylvania and southern California, especially given that they are all university students. It is only when we consider the possibility that the language system is open to the influence of experience as part of a typical dynamic that presents the potential for differences to emerge. Research on bilingualism has long considered the bilingual’s language system as open to the influence of exposure and usage (especially the less dominant second language), with recent studies revealing the way that different interactional contexts of language use shape both linguistic and cognitive processing (Gullifer et al., 2018; Pot, Keijzer, & De Bot, 2018). In fact, a new wave of initiatives in bilingualism research has focused on the role of interactional contexts (Green & Abutalebi, 2013) and diversity of social language use (Gullifer & Titone, 2019) in bilingual language processing and broader cognition. Ironically, as research has moved toward a focus on variation in bilingual experience (e.g., Baum & Titone, 2014; Fricke, Zirnstein, Navarro-Torres, & Kroll, 2019; Luk & Bialystok, 2013), the call to avoid comparisons of bilinguals and monolinguals has eliminated monolinguals entirely from many of these studies. While this approach has provided critical new insights into how interactional dual-language use impacts bilingual language processing and cognition, it omits the role of monolingual speakers in these communities as well as the possibility that exposure alone may play a significant role.\n\nThe current study extended this perspective to monolinguals. We contend that there is a continuum of language experiences between the traditionally dichotomized “monolingualism” and “bilingualism”. While many have argued for a continuum of bilingualism (e.g., Grosjean, 1989), based on language proficiency and the context of dual language use, we take the perspective that this continuum extends to monolingualism as well, in which proficiency is not the defining feature but rather exposure and context. While many of the bilingual initiatives have focused on the consequence for cognitive control, we examined the consequences for new language learning. It would not be too surprising to find evidence that exposure to a language improves one’s ability to learn that language; instead, the current study tested whether exposure to many different languages has the consequence of making the language system better able to learn new languages that are not present in the ambient context.\n\nWe have reason to believe that monolinguals in California have more experience with languages other than English than monolinguals in Pennsylvania, in some ways making them less “monolingual”-like. However, we argue that this is precisely the point; the monolinguals in California are nevertheless functionally monolingual with English as their native language. For our purposes, we consider functional monolinguals as speakers who report not being able to speak languages other than their native language much beyond the use of basic greetings and are not actively learning another language. Living in a linguistic context like southern California in which many languages are spoken in the surrounding environment may have the consequence of providing additional exposure or opportunities for practice in a previously studied language, increasing the perceived relevance of bilingualism and language learning, and many other things. Therefore, the role of ambient linguistic diversity necessarily involves these other experiences that are part of living in such a context.\n\nMonolinguals in the current study were trained on vocabulary in a new language (Finnish) to which neither group had previous exposure and which is not part of the linguistic landscape in either location. Critically, Finnish adheres to vowel harmony, a phonological constraint on how words are formed in the language that prevents front vowels (ä, ö, y) from co-occurring with back vowels (a, o, u). We asked whether monolinguals living in a more linguistically diverse context would be better able to implicitly detect, extract, and generalize these novel phonological patterns to previously unencountered words. If the effect of linguistic context is specific to the language being learned, then there would be no reason to expect any differences across the two monolingual groups given that Finnish is not part of the linguistic landscape of California or Pennsylvania. But if exposure to linguistic diversity has the impact of increasing sensitivity to foreign languages in general, then we might find differences in how well the monolinguals in each location are able to learn and generalize a novel phonological pattern like vowel harmony.\n\nUnintentional learning\n\nResearch on statistical learning, artificial grammar learning, and incidental learning converges in demonstrating that exposure alone is sufficient to produce low levels of learning in the absence of attention or the intention to learn. Given the potential influence of experience on variation in monolingual language processing, these mechanisms may play important roles in generating variation between monolinguals under different circumstances.\n\nStatistical learning is the cognitive mechanism by which statistical regularities are extracted from the environment to aid in detecting meaningful units, such as segmenting words from the speech stream. In a seminal study by Saffran, Aslin, and Newport (1996), they demonstrated how 8-month-old infants can extract statistical information about transitional probabilities within and between words after only 2 minutes of exposure to a continuous speech stream. Since the initial study, a body of research has shown the robustness of the statistical learning mechanism across language, motor, and visual domains, and across developmental periods in children and adults (e.g., Abla & Okanoya, 2009; Hunt & Aslin, 2001; Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, & Newport, 1999; Turk-Browne, Scholl, Chun, & Johnson, 2009). The underlying idea of statistical learning is that the brain is wired to detect co-occurrences and probabilities in our environments as the first step for developing meaningful representations, and that it is constantly doing so whether we attend to the information or not.\n\nWhile statistical learning studies have demonstrated how people extract chunks of information (i.e., words and word boundaries) from their environment, research on artificial grammar learning has demonstrated that people can also acquire implicit rule-based patterns between the units of the input without realizing a pattern was present (Reber, 1967). In artificial grammar studies, participants are asked to reproduce written letter strings that adhere to a consistent pattern (i.e., the grammar) under the guise of a memory task, consumer preference task, or some other distraction. After training, they are informed that the letter strings were rule-governed. When asked to select a new letter string on a 2AFC classification task, people perform above-chance at identifying letter strings that follow the grammar, even when accounting for surface similarity to the training items (i.e., chunk strength; Lieberman, Chang, Chiao, Bookheimer, & Knowlton, 2004). The implicit nature of the task is validated by studies showing that amnesiac patients, who cannot form explicit memories of the studied items, can also extract the regularities of the artificial grammar (Knowlton & Squire, 1996). Combined with statistical learning, these mechanisms help explain how people extract meaningful units and relate them to each other through repeated exposure, often without any explicit awareness of doing so.\n\nA related body of research has taken these findings further to show how meaning is assigned to the segmented units. Studies of incidental learning, although more sparse than statistical learning, have shown that adults combine meaningful real-world information to extract the underlying semantic information. Gullberg et al. (2010) asked participants to watch an 8-minute video of a weather forecast in a foreign language (Mandarin). In the video, certain words were repeated a different number of times, and some were paired with the forecaster’s gestures to the weather map while discussing different weather conditions (e.g., sun, rain, temperature). They found that even after such a short exposure, participants were above chance in their ability to map the meaning of the weather conditions to the words. Unsurprisingly, learning was affected by the number of repetitions and gestural information, but sound-to-picture matching was above-chance after just 8 repetitions of a word accompanied by a gesture. Moreover, participants reported no awareness of learning, again demonstrating that exposure alone can produce learning in the absence of awareness or intention.\n\nSounds are special\n\nWhile some past research has demonstrated that information about words, word meanings, and grammatical patterns can be extracted in new contexts, another body of research addresses how phonological perception and production is modified by experience over time, particularly early in life. For example, adults who consistently overhear a language as young children (childhood overhearers) and later attempt to re-learn that language, demonstrate native-like phonological perception, but are more similar to novice L2 learners in phonological production and morphosyntax (Au, Oh, Knightly, Jun, & Romo, 2008; Oh, Jun, Knightly, & Au, 2003). Research on international adoptees also shows how very early language experience with no maintenance beyond childhood continues to influence language processing much later in life and remains preserved in the neural patterns of the language network (Pallier et al., 2003; Pierce, Chen, Delcenserie, Genesee, & Klein, 2015; Pierce, Klein, Chen, Delcenserie, & Genesee, 2014). Indeed, phonological perception is tuned at a young age to narrow in on relevant phonological contrasts in the native language (e.g., Kuhl et al., 2006; Werker & Tees, 1984). Tuning occurs slightly later for infants exposed to more than one language (Bosch & Sebastián-Gallés, 1997; Werker, 2012), leaving their phonological systems open to the influence of additional languages longer. Some have proposed that early exposure to such linguistic diversity creates a “perceptual wedge” in the phonological system that has long-lasting linguistic and cognitive consequences (Petitto et al., 2012; Tees & Werker, 1984).\n\nA recent study extended these ideas to show that adults remain sensitive to novel phonological features through passive exposure (Kurkela, Hämäläinen, Leppänen, Shu, & Astikainen, 2019). Monolingual Finnish adults watched silent movies while Mandarin speech sounds (tones) were passively played in the background for two hours at a time over the course of four days. After the exposure, their ERP responses for change detection (mismatch negativity, P3a) and attention (P3b) to novel speech sounds and non-speech sounds (sinusoidal waves) were enhanced, although their behavioral discrimination did not change. They emphasized the importance of repeated exposure with the potential for sleep consolidation as critical for successful learning. These results are among the first to demonstrate such effects in adults.\n\nIn the current study, the ability to perceive the distinction between the front and back Finnish vowels is a form of phonological perception. The California monolinguals were likely to have been exposed to linguistic diversity from a young age, but not specifically to Finnish phonological contrasts. Here we ask whether the linguistic diversity of the ambient environment has the effect of making learners’ phonological systems more flexible, such that they may be faster to tune in to the novel meaningful contrasts in a completely unfamiliar language.\n\nCurrent study\n\nThe combination of research on unintentional learning with the special sensitivity of the phonological system led to a prediction that ambient linguistic diversity might promote the ability to learn novel, meaningful phonological contrasts in an unfamiliar language. The front/back vowel distinction in Finnish and its consequences for word formation and morphosyntax is a unique feature not present in the predominant languages spoken in southern California (e.g., Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Korean), nor in the languages that participants reported studying in high school (see ), making it a feature that is equally novel to the monolinguals in Pennsylvania and California. Yet if ambient linguistic diversity has the effect of tuning the linguistic system of speakers in those contexts, including monolinguals, then we might expect monolinguals in diverse and homogeneous contexts to differ in their sensitivity to such a novel contrast during new learning. Therefore, if we find any differences in sensitivity to the novel Finnish vowel contrast between the monolinguals in each context, we can be confident it is not a result of previous exposure, but is more likely to be related in some way to the different contexts.\n\nTable 1:\n\nPennsylvania (n = 18)California (n = 16)% Female78%63%X2 = 0.36, p = .55Age (SD)23.78 (4.86)20 (2.56)t(32) = 2.78, p = .0l*English Verbal Fluency Score (SD)14.25 (2.36)12.85 (3.05)t(32) = 1.5, p = .14English Self-Rated Proficiency (SD)9.65 (0.62)9.73 (0.59)t(32) = 0.39, p = .7Operation Span Score (SD)48.44 (7.21)44.67 (9.6)t(31) = 1.29, p = .21Mother’s EducationUp to GED: 1 Post-secondary: 17Up to GED: 6 Post-secondary: 10X2 = 3.51, p = .06Reported Experience with other language(s)Spanish: 9\n\nChinese: 1\n\nItalian: 1\n\nFrench: 1\n\nLatin: 1Spanish: 7\n\nChinese: 2\n\nJapanese:\n\n1 Hindi: 1\n\nGerman: 1Age of Acquisition of other language(s) (SD; range)15.45 (4.57; 9–26)11.92 (4.76; 5–20)t(21) = 1.82, p = .08Self-Rated Proficiency in other language(s) (SD)2.18 (1.7)3.93 (1.7)t(21) = 2.46, p = .02*% Exposure to reported other languages (SD)0.61% (1.61%)10.44% (14.54%)t(15.33) = 2.69, p = .02*\n\nIn the current study, participants knew they were explicitly learning Finnish vocabulary words, but were also told to try to learn about “what kind of words belong or don’t belong in the Finnish language”. In this way, they were required to explicitly learn vocabulary and implicitly learn the vowel harmony rule. Large individual differences often emerge under implicit conditions of learning (Batterink & Neville, 2013), making it perhaps more sensitive to any differences between these groups. In addition to making the nature of the learning task quite difficult to improve our sensitivity to detect effects, we employed electrophysiological measures of brain activity (ERPs). While most word-level manipulations in language studies typically elicit an N400 component, associated with lexico-semantic retrieval from long-term memory (for review, see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011), we may also observe other ERP effects given that the participants were asked to make a lexical decision about words for which they have no semantic mapping. Nevertheless, the expectation was that the behavioral and/or ERP measures should reveal differences between the monolinguals residing in two different linguistic contexts in their ability to detect the pattern of vowel harmony and use it to distinguish between real Finnish words and vowel harmony violations.\n\nWhile the difference between the California and Pennsylvania monolinguals on which we are focused is linguistic diversity, the two contexts differ in other ways that were not possible to match closely. For example, we cannot say with certainty whether the exposure to ambient languages is the primary factor driving any observed differences, more frequent interactions with speakers who have varying degrees of accented English, sociocultural attitudes towards learning new languages, or any of the other natural consequences of linguistic diversity. Perhaps most critically, SES is a factor that differed across these different university communities. Monolinguals in Pennsylvania came from higher SES backgrounds than those in California. That difference itself might lead to a prediction that the monolinguals in Pennsylvania, like the higher proficiency and higher SES participants in Pakulak and Neville (2010), would outperform the monolinguals in California.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the current study, we asked whether linguistic diversity in the ambient environment significantly impacts a person’s ability to learn a novel language not present in that environment. We compared monolingual speakers in central Pennsylvania with those in southern California, locations with different populations and linguistic profiles. The main finding was that the monolinguals in California became sensitive to a subtle, non-native phonological contrast during language learning, whereas the monolinguals in Pennsylvania did not, suggesting fundamental differences in how the monolinguals in each location learned. While this finding needs to be qualified in a number of respects, the difference between the two groups itself holds important implications for language processing and language learning, bilingualism, and more generally for the impact of context on cognition.\n\nThe monolinguals were asked to learn Finnish, a language that is absent in their surroundings, and a language that, unlike English, adheres to a special phonological pattern called vowel harmony. In Finnish, front vowels (ä, ö, y) and back vowels (a, o, u) are phonemically distinct and cannot co-occur within the same word. Therefore, monolinguals in this study had to implicitly acquire the distinction between the front and back vowels, and then use that distinction to extract the vowel harmony pattern to discriminate novel words they had not previously encountered.\n\nThe behavioral results of the learning task revealed that both groups were able to learn the form-meaning mappings of studied Finnish words, but neither group was able to reliably generalize the vowel harmony pattern to novel words. However, the pattern of brain activity, measured via EEGs, revealed more sensitive information. Both groups had significant ERP effects for the studied words, although a marginal interaction suggested that the effect in the Pennsylvania monolinguals was more broadly distributed whereas the effect in the California monolinguals was more restricted to the posterior sites. These results are generally in line with the behavioral findings; both groups demonstrated the ability to distinguish between studied words and violations in behavior, and the Pennsylvania monolinguals had numerically (but not statistically) higher performance.\n\nIn contrast, the behavioral results for the novel words, which were no better than chance, might lead to the expectation that the monolinguals were not at all sensitive to the distinction between the novel words and vowel harmony violations. This was true for the Pennsylvania monolinguals, whose ERP results for novel words and nonwords revealed no significant or marginal differences in the waveforms. In contrast, the monolinguals in California revealed two marginally significant clusters in their ERP effects that reflected a larger positivity in the 480–760 ms window over left anterior and left central electrodes. While the effects have no functional connection to established ERP components, the morphology of the waveforms was actually quite similar to their waveforms for the studied words and violations, but the effect was in fact numerically larger in novel items than for the studied items. The observation that the ERP deflection was found in the real words rather than to the violations may imply that the California monolinguals learned something about what forms the real words, rather than something about what made the “fake” words different. Regardless of the functional interpretation of the component, the fact that their brain activity distinguished the two types of stimuli suggests that they were sensitive, and that the Pennsylvania monolinguals were not.\n\nThere are potential factors that it was not possible to control in the current study that could have impacted the results, including SES. However, if SES were the primary factor, then Pennsylvania monolinguals should have outperformed the California monolinguals. The effects of SES differences have broad and robust cognitive consequences (e.g., see Raizada & Kishiyama, 2010). Therefore, in many ways, one might expect larger differences between the monolingual groups based on SES factors alone, in favor of those living in Pennsylvania. Although SES differences have not been directly linked to second language learning or learning more generally, particularly in college-age students, the differences in SES may have had other consequences for our participants (e.g., access to resources or opportunities) that would only have been biased in favor of the Pennsylvania students. Instead, we found that the California monolinguals became sensitive to a critical phonological distinction in Finnish.\n\nThe ERP differences between the two monolingual groups suggests that ambient linguistic diversity, and the various other factors co-involved in linguistic diversity, may have a positive impact on new language learning. As noted, there are other factors that may have contributed to these differences. Even if ambient linguistic diversity is the factor driving this effect, we cannot tell from these data alone whether it is simply overhearing foreign languages, the requirement to interact regularly with non-native speakers of English, or actual differences in past language learning experience. Living among linguistic diversity not only increases the number of interactions with accented speakers, but also may have consequences for the regional dialect. A wealth of studies have examined how the speech sounds in one’s native language or native regional dialect impact the sensitivity and perception of non-native speech sounds (e.g., Conrey, Potts, & Niedzielski, 2005; Williams & Escudero, 2014). While these studies have primarily focused on specific sounds that do or do not overlap across dialects or languages, it is possible that the linguistic diversity increases the heterogeneity of speech sounds in the environment in ways that impact the phonological inventories of those speakers.\n\nAnother important implication of these results concerns the term “monolingual”. Many studies would exclude the monolinguals from California in our sample for not being what one might consider “pure” monolinguals. However, in California and in other areas of the country (particularly urban areas), the linguistic landscape sampled from our California population is very characteristic of typical monolingual experience. By excluding these monolinguals from our samples, we often miss the cognitive, linguistic, and social consequences of living in such diverse environments. In our sample, similar proportions of the monolinguals in each location reported experience with other languages. Of the California monolinguals, 75% reported experience with another language, and 72% of the Pennsylvania monolinguals had experience with learning another language. What differed was that California monolinguals had on average earlier and more exposure to their reported languages than the Pennsylvania monolinguals, resulting in higher self-ratings in those other languages. From the data we report, we do not know whether earlier and/or continued exposure is a critical factor.\n\nWould the California monolinguals be better able to learn a new language in a classroom setting? In the current study, we found similar results for the two groups for studied items, whereas the differences emerged in more implicit learning of unattended features. Additionally, the differences emerged in the neural measures but not behavioral measures. While it is not clear why the effect would present in brain activity but not in behavior, a growing number of studies have reported such patterns (e.g., Bice & Kroll, 2015; Kurkela et al., 2019; McLaughlin et al., 2004), suggesting that the two measures are capturing different aspects of the learning process. The research on childhood overhearers who later attempt to learn the language as an adult reveals quite specific effects, with advantages in learning phonological, but not grammatical, aspects of the language (Au, Knightly, Jun, & Oh, 2002; Au et al., 2008). Similarly, research on international adoptees found that adults who were adopted at a young age into a new language context show very distinct neural patterns of processing (Pallier et al., 2003; Pierce et al., 2014), but none have examined whether those neural patterns translate directly into a behavioral advantage for new learning. In fact, while international adoptees have been found to have special maintenance of the language they were exposed to at birth, other research has found the effects to be specific; they do not generalize to phonological perception for other languages (Choi, Broersma, & Cutler, 2018). The effects of ambient linguistic diversity may prepare individuals for some, but not all, aspects of new language learning.\n\nThe results also speak to the role of immersion in language learning, but raise questions about the nature of immersion. Past studies suggest that immersion in the second language benefits learning (e.g., Freed, Segalowitz, & Dewey, 2004; Linck, Kroll, & Sunderman, 2009). However, most studies on language immersion examine late bilinguals who are intentionally learning the language and who are moving from a relatively unilingual context into an immersion context that may itself be unilingual or linguistically diverse. To our knowledge, the past research has not examined the consequences of linguistic diversity within the immersion context. Given the serendipitous nature of the present study, we do not have systematic information about how long the monolinguals have lived in each place, although we suspect that the majority of those living in California had been immersed in a linguistically diverse context for most of their lives. In future research it will be of great interest to determine whether openness to new learning is created by immersion in a diverse environment itself or whether specific features of the context or language experience are critical.\n\nThe biggest limitation of the current study was that the opportunity to collect these data from such different locations was serendipitous. This lessened our experimental control and ability to report many variables and factors that could have been useful for disentangling the source of the effects. In retrospect, our conclusions would be stronger if we had been able to limit the California sample of monolinguals to only those who had been living in the context for most or all of their lives; while we suspect the majority of our sample fit that description, we do not have empirical measures to support such claims. Nevertheless, if our sample did include monolinguals who had only recently moved to that context, then the effect would likely be smaller, leading to greater noise in the signal or an underestimation of the effect. Likewise, we would have liked to have been able to ask more detailed questions regarding language experiences, exposure to languages other than those that the participants reported having previously studied, performance in foreign language classes, socioeconomic status, etc. However, despite the lack of empirical measures to describe how these groups may differ, we fully believe that the differences between contexts and the effects on language learning reported here are true and representative. We implore future research to further investigate how context modulates variation in monolingual speakers under more controlled conditions.\n\nThe current results support and extend the many new initiatives in bilingualism focusing on the role of interactional contexts and diversity of social language use to include monolingual speakers as well. The essence of these models is that the way we use and are exposed to language shapes cognition. We found that different language contexts potentially changed language learning for monolingual speakers. Like studies of bilingual language processing, the results suggest that language experience lies on a continuum between monolingualism and bilingualism. The results also provide a fruitful new avenue for investigations into adult language learning and has important implications for our understanding of the role of experience and immersion in native language processing. Considering the consequences of the ambient environment together with other sources of individual variation will frame an important new agenda research on language, learning, and cognition."
