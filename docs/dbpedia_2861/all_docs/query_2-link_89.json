        "text": "Automobiles imported into the United States must meet the fuel-emission requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency and the safety, bumper, and theft prevention standards of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Trying to import a car that doesn't meet all the requirements can be difficult. Please see the Importing a Motor Vehicle page for more information.\n\nAlmost all cars, vans, sport utility vehicles and so on that are bought in foreign countries must be modified to meet American standards, except most late model vehicles from Canada. Passenger vehicles that are imported on the condition that they be modified must be exported or destroyed if they are not modified acceptably. Also under these circumstances, the vehicle could require a bond upon entry until the conditions for admission have been met.\n\nAnd even if the car does meet all federal standards, it might be subject to additional EPA requirements, depending on what countries it was driven in. You are strongly encouraged to contact EPA and DOT before importing a car.\n\nInformation on importing vehicles can be obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency Web site. You may also find importation information from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance.\n\nCopies of the brochure Importing or Exporting a Car can be obtained by writing to:\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n\nP.O. Box 7407\n\nWashington, DC 20044\n\nYou can also visit the Exporting a Motor Vehicle page. The EPA Automotive Imports Fact Manual can be obtained by writing to the Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460. You can also visit the EPA Web site.\n\nCars being brought into the United States temporarily, by nonresidents, (for less than one year) are exempt from these restrictions. It is illegal to bring a vehicle into the United States and sell it if it was not formally entered on a CBP Form 7501.\n\nMost countries have laws that protect their cultural property. Art/artifacts/antiquities; archeological and ethnological material are also terms used to describe this material. These laws include export controls and/ or national ownership of cultural property. Even if purchased from a business in the country of origin or in another country, legal ownership of such artifacts may be in question if brought into the United States.\n\nTherefore, although they do not necessarily confer ownership, you must have documents such as export permits and receipts when importing such items into the United States.\n\nWhile foreign laws may not be enforceable in the United States, they can cause certain U.S. laws to be invoked. For example, under the U.S. National Stolen Property Act, one cannot have legal title to art/artifacts/antiquities that were stolen - no matter how many times such items may have changed hands. Articles of stolen cultural property from museums or from religious or secular public monuments originating in any of the countries party to the 1970 UNESCO Convention specifically may not be imported into the United States.\n\nU.S. law may also restrict the importation of specific categories of art/artifacts/antiquities. For example, U.S. laws restrict the importation of:\n\nAny pre-Columbian monumental and architectural sculpture and murals from Central and South American countries;\n\nNative American artifacts from Canada; Mayan pre-Columbian archaeological objects from Guatemala; pre-Columbian archaeological objects from El Salvador and Peru; archaeological objects like terracotta statues from Mali; Colonial period objects such as paintings and ritual objects from Peru;\n\nByzantine period ritual and ecclesiastic objects such as icons from Cyprus; and\n\nKhmer stone archeological sculpture from Cambodia.\n\nImportation of items such as those listed above is permitted only when an export permit issued by the country of origin where such items were first found accompanies them. Purveyors of such items have been known to offer phony export certificates.\n\nAs additional U.S. import restrictions may be imposed in response to requests from other countries, it is wise for prospective purchasers to visit the U.S. Department of State website.\n\nMerchandise determined to be Iraqi cultural property or other items of archeological, historical, cultural, rare scientific and religious importance illegally removed from the Iraq National Museum, the National Library and other locations in Iraq, since August 6, 1990, are also prohibited from importation.\n\nTemporarily taking a firearm or ammunition outside the United States for personal reasons. i.e., hunting, or other personal recreational activities.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reminds United States Citizens (USCs) and U.S. Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) who intend to temporarily export from the United States a firearm(s) and/or ammunition that they must comply with export control statutory and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe temporary export of firearms is governed by the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the BIS for firearms “subject to the EAR.” Generally, a BIS license is required to temporarily export a firearm. Travelers may be able to utilize the 15 CFR 740.14 Baggage (BAG) license exception, which provides special provisions for exporting firearms and ammunition. Under Lice. Exports of firearms under License Exception BAG must follow the export clearance requirements under 15 CFR 758.11. Export clearance requirements for firearms and related items, which refers to the CBP Form 4457 requirements described below in this guidance.\n\nA nonimmigrant alien leaving the U.S. may export or reexport under the BAG license exception only such firearms controlled under ECCN 0A501 and ammunition controlled under ECCN 0A505 and only if he or she brought the firearms and/or ammunition into the United States under the relevant provisions of Department of Justice regulations at 27 CFR part 478.\n\nUSCs, LPRs and nonimmigrants utilizing the BAG license exception are required present the firearms and ammunition for inspection to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer prior to departure from the U.S. To complete this process, the traveler must complete the Certificate of Registration for Personal Effects Taken Abroad CBP Form 4457 and present the merchandise being declared under the BAG license exception to a CBP Officer prior to departure from the U.S. the CBP Form 4457 must be presented along with the firearm(s) and any returning unused ammunition to CBP upon return to the U.S.\n\nIt is important to note that the Form 4457 is only for reentry into the U.S.; it is not an entry document to the importing country. It is the responsibility of the traveler to comply with the import laws of the country to which they are traveling.\n\nAdditionally, the permanent or temporary exportation of a firearm and/or ammunition that may be regulated by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), or by the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). Also, travelers may be required to possess the appropriate Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) form.\n\nFor additional information on the regulatory requirements of other government agencies and information on licenses, forms, and exemptions, please refer to links below.\n\nDirectorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC)\n\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\n\nBureau of Industry and Security\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Guidance for U.S. Persons Traveling Outside the U.S. with Firearms and/or Ammunition\n\nTransportation Security Administration – Transporting Firearms and Ammunition\n\nCertain fish and wildlife, and products made from them, are subject to import and export restrictions, prohibitions, permits or certificates, as well as requirements. CBP recommends that you review the U.S. Fish and Wildlife page for additional information before you depart if you plan to import or export any of the following:\n\nWild birds, land or marine mammals, reptiles, fish, shellfish, mollusks or invertebrates;\n\nAny part or product of the above, such as skins, tusks, bone, feathers, or eggs; or\n\nProducts or articles manufactured from wildlife or fish.\n\nEndangered wildlife species, and products made from them, generally may not be imported or exported. You will need a permit from the FWS to import virtually all types of ivory, unless it is from a warthog. The FWS has many restrictions and prohibitions on various kinds of ivory - Asian elephant, African elephant, whale, rhinoceros, seal, pre-Endangered Species Act, post-CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) and many others - and urge you to contact them before you acquire ivory in a foreign country. You may contact the Management Authority at 1-800-344-WILD (1-800-344-9453) Pressing Option 3 will provide you with general information, and Option 4 will connect you to the permits section. You can also get information on permits at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service website.\n\nYou may import an object made of ivory if it is an antique. To be an antique the ivory must be at least 100 years old. You will need documentation that authenticates the age of the ivory. You may import other antiques containing wildlife parts with the same condition, but they must be accompanied by documentation proving they are at least 100 years old. Certain other requirements for antiques may apply.\n\nIf you plan to buy such things as tortoiseshell jewelry, or articles made from whalebone, ivory, skins or fur, contact the:\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n\nDivision of Law Enforcement\n\n5275 Leesburg Pike,\n\nFalls Church, VA 22041\n\nYou can also call 1-800-344-WILD (1-800-344-9453) or visit the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service website. Hunters can get information on the limitations for importing and exporting migratory game birds from this office as well or from the Migratory Birds website.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated specific ports of entry to handle fish and wildlife entries. If you plan to import anything discussed in this section, please contact CBP about designated ports and the brochure Pets and Wildlife, which describes the regulations CBP enforces for all agencies that oversee the importation of animals.\n\nSome states have fish and wildlife laws and regulations that are stricter than federal laws and regulations. If you are returning to such a state, be aware that the stricter state laws and regulations have priority. Similarly, the federal government does not allow you to import wild animals into the United States that were taken, killed, sold, possessed or exported from another country if any of these acts violated foreign laws.\n\nThe Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Bioterrorism Act or BTA), Public Law 107-188, established the requirement that food items, imported (or offered for import) for commercial use, including hand-carried quantities, be properly reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prior to arrival of those items in the United States. The FDA prior notification timeframes (by transport mode) are two hours by land, four hours by rail or air, eight hours by vessel and prior to the \"time of mailing\" for international mail.\n\nFood that was made by an individual in his/her personal residence, or food purchased by an individual from a vendor that is sent by that individual as a personal gift (for non-business reasons) to someone in the United States is not subject to Bioterrorism Act requirements. However, food that is sent to an individual in the United States by a business is subject to special requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For instance, if you go to a food shop in England and buy a gift basket, then take it to the post office or a courier service to send to a friend, the shipment is not subject to BTA requirements. But if you go to that same shop and ask them to send the gift basket for you, the shipment is subject to BTA requirements, and the vendor will have to file Prior Notice. Many travelers are finding that vendors will not ship food directly to U.S. residents because the reporting requirements can be time-consuming to complete.\n\nIn general, failure to provide complete, timely and accurate prior notice for Bioterrorism Act regulated items, can result in refusal of admission of the merchandise, movement of the goods to an FDA registered facility (at importer expense) and/or civil monetary penalty liabilities for any party that was involved in the import transaction.\n\nBringing fruits and vegetables depends on a number of factors. For instance, consider the apple you bought in the foreign airport just before boarding and then did not eat. Whether or not CBP will allow the apple into the United States depends on where you got it and where you are going after you arrive in the United States. The same would be true for Mediterranean tomatoes. Such factors are important because fresh fruits and vegetables can introduce plant pests or diseases into the United States.\n\nOne good example of problems imported fruits and vegetables can cause is the Mediterranean fruit fly outbreak during the 1980s. The outbreak cost the state of California and the federal government approximately $100 million to get rid of this pest. The cause of the outbreak was one traveler who brought home one contaminated piece of fruit. It is best not to bring fresh fruits or vegetables into the United States. However, if you plan to, contact either CBP or check the Permits section on the USDA-APHIS website for a general approved list on items that need a permit.\n\nNote: The civil penalty for failing to declare agricultural items at U.S. ports of entry will cost first time offenders $300. The penalty for the second violation goes up to $500. To avoid receiving a penalty all agricultural items and present them to Customs and Border Protection for inspection so that an agriculture specialist can determine if it is admissible.\n\nInformation on bringing back your game or hunting trophy can be found at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Information on Hunting and Fishing page. Currently, 14 ports of entry are designated to handle game and trophies; other ports must get approval from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to clear your entry.\n\nDepending on the species you bring back, you might need a permit from the country where the animal was harvested. Regardless of the species, you are required to fill out a Fish and Wildlife Form 3-177, Declaration for Importation or Exportation.\n\nTrophies may also be subject to inspection by CBP for sanitary purposes. General guidelines for importing trophies can be found on under the APHIS Import Authorization System (IAS) on the Guidelines for the Importation of Ruminant, Swine, and Bird Trophies website, or by writing to:\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\n\nAPHIS, VS, Strategy & Policy, APIE\n\n4700 River Road, Unit 40\n\nRiverdale, MD 20737-1231\n\nYou can also call (301) 851-3300, option 4.\n\nNonhuman primate trophy materials may require a permit from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prospective importers of nonhuman primate trophy materials from nonhuman primates should review the permit requirements and complete an application form, following the Guidance for Individuals Wishing to Import Non-Human Primate Trophies, Skins or Skulls. Trophy materials of other animals under import embargo because of viral zoonotic infections, such as civets, Asian birds, and African rodents, may be imported if the body has been sufficiently processed to render it non-infectious. Proper methods of accomplishing this include:\n\nHeating to an internal temperature of 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit) or placing in boiling water for a minimum of 30 minutes);\n\nPreservation in 2 percent formaldehyde;\n\nChemically treating in acidic or alkaline solutions (soaking in a solution below pH 3.0 or above pH 11.5 for 24 hours); or\n\nThe use of hypertonic salts.\n\nAlso, federal regulations do not allow the importation of any species into a state with fish or wildlife laws that are more restrictive than federal laws. If foreign laws were violated in the taking, sale, possession or export to the United States of wild animals, those animals will not be allowed entry into the United States.\n\nWarning: There are many regulations, enforced by various agencies, governing the importation of animals and animal parts. Failure to comply with them could result in time-consuming delays in clearing your trophy through CBP. You should always call for guidance before you depart.\n\nRule of thumb: when you go abroad, take the medicines you will need, no more, no less.\n\nNarcotics and certain other drugs with a high potential for abuse - Rohypnol, GHB and Fen-Phen, to name a few - may not be brought into the United States, and there are severe penalties for trying to do so. While these drugs or devices may be legal somewhere else, they may not legally enter the country and will be confiscated, even if they are prescribed by a foreign physician. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) may also have other restrictions on bringing controlled substances into the country.\n\nIf you need medicines that contains controlled substances listed in schedules II, III, IV, or V (e.g., some cough medicines, tranquilizers, sleeping pills, antidepressants, or stimulants), do the following:\n\nDeclare all drugs, medicinals, and similar products to the appropriate CBP official;\n\nCarry such substances in their original containers;\n\nCarry only the quantity of such substances that a person with that condition (e.g., chronic pain) would normally carry for his/her personal use; and\n\nCarry a prescription or written statement from your physician that the substances are being used under a doctor's supervision and that they are necessary for your physical well being while traveling.\n\nU.S. residents entering the United States at international land borders who are carrying a validly obtained controlled substance (other than narcotics such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or LSD), are subject to certain additional requirements. If a U.S. resident wants to bring in a controlled substance (other than narcotics such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or LSD) but does not have a prescription for the substance issued by a U.S.-licensed practitioner (e.g., physician, dentist, etc.) who is registered with, and authorized by, the Drug Enforcement Administration to prescribe the medication, the individual may not import more than 50 dosage units of the medication into the United States.\n\nIf the U.S. resident has a prescription for the controlled substance issued by a DEA registrant, more than 50 dosage units may be imported by that person, provided all other legal requirements are met. Note: Only medications that can be legally prescribed in the United States may be imported for personal use. Be aware that possession of certain substances may also violate state laws.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the importation of a controlled substance into the United States, please contact the Drug Enforcement Administration, Office of Diversion Control, International Drug Unit, at (202) 305-8800.\n\nIf you plan to take your pet abroad or import one on your return, please review the Bringing Pets and Wildlife into the United States page for additional information. You should also check with state, county and local authorities to learn if their restrictions and prohibitions on pets are stricter than federal requirements.\n\nImporting animals is closely regulated for public health reasons and also for the well-being of the animals. There are restrictions and prohibitions on bringing many species into the United States.\n\nCats are subject to inspection at ports of entry and may be denied entry into the United States if they have evidence of an infectious disease that can be transmitted to humans. If a cat appears to be ill, further examination by a licensed veterinarian at the owner's expense might be required at the port of entry.\n\nCats are not required to have proof of rabies vaccination for importation into the United States. However, some states require vaccination of cats for rabies, so it is a good idea to check with state and local health authorities at your final destination.\n\nAll pet cats arriving in the state of Hawaii and the territory of Guam, even from the U.S. mainland, are subject to locally imposed quarantine requirements.\n\nDogs must also be free of evidence of diseases that could be communicable to humans. A general certificate of health is not required by CDC for entry of pet dogs into the United States, although some airlines or states may require them. Dogs must have a certificate showing they have been vaccinated against rabies greater than or equal to 30 days prior to entry into the United States. This certificate should identify the dog, show the date of vaccination, the date it expires (there are one-year and three-year vaccinations), and be signed by a licensed veterinarian. If the certificate does not have an expiration date, CBP will accept it as long as the dog was vaccinated 12 months or less before coming to the United States. Dogs coming from rabies free countries do not have to be vaccinated.\n\nThese requirements apply equally to service animals such as Seeing Eye dogs.\n\nIf your pet does not meet CDC's entry requirements as described above, contact CDC at CDCAnimalImports@cdc.gov to discuss your particular situation.\n\nBirds may be imported as pets as long as you comply with APHIS and U.S. Fish and Wildlife requirements.\n\nAdvisory: Until further notice, there is a temporary ban on the importation of pet birds from countries/ regions affected with highly pathogenic Avian influenza subtype H5NI. See the Animal and Animal Product Import Information website for more information.\n\nAll non-U.S. origin pet birds imported into the United States (except from Canada) are required to be quarantined for 30 days in a USDA animal import quarantine facility at the owner's expense. A reservation at the facility must be made in advance by contacting the USDA port veterinarian at one of the special ports of entry listed below. A cost estimate for the quarantine will be provided at that time. Once the reservation is made and payment is received in full for all quarantine services, the animal import quarantine facility will issue a USDA import permit (VS Form17-129). This permit must accompany the bird while in transit.\n\nThe USDA defines pet birds as those that are imported for personal pleasure of their individual owners and are not intended for resale.\n\nDocument and Quarantine Requirements:\n\nUSDA import permit (VS Form17-129);\n\nCurrent Health Certificate issued by a full-time salaried veterinarian of the agency responsible for animal health of the national government in the exporting country of origin;\n\n30-day Quarantine in an USDA Animal Import Center; and\n\nFish and Wildlife Services Certification (if necessary).\n\nUSDA Quarantine Centers and Ports of Entry\n\nAll non-U.S. origin pet birds must enter the country and undergo quarantine at one of the following import quarantine facilities.\n\nThese are the only ports of entry available for importing non-U.S. origin pet birds.\n\nNew York Animal Import Center (NYAIC)\n\nUSDA, APHIS VS\n\n230-59 Rockaway Blvd., Suite 101\n\nJamaica, NY 11413\n\nTelephone: (718) 553-3570\n\nFax: (718) 553-3572\n\nPort of Entry: JFK International Airport\n\nMiami Animal Import Center\n\nUSDA-APHIS-VS\n\n6300 NW 36 Street\n\nMiami, FL 33122\n\nTelephone: (305) 876-2200\n\nFax: (305) 876-2201\n\nPort of Entry: Miami International Airport\n\nThe 30 day quarantine period officially begins when your pet bird arrives at the quarantine facility.\n\nOther common pets such as rabbits, ferrets, hamsters, gerbils and guinea pigs may be imported if they are in good health. The importation of reptiles and invertebrates is restricted; please contact the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for additional guidance. Most species of snails are not admissible. Contact APHIS for additional information. All civets, African rodents and nonhuman primates are prohibited except for science, education and exhibition. These species cannot be imported as pets. Refer to the CDC's Traveling with Pets, Importation of Animals and Animal Products into the United States website for more information.\n\nIn general, there is no limit to how much fabric and clothing you can bring back as long as it is for your personal use or as gifts. If you have exceeded your personal exemption, you may have to pay duty on the items. Unaccompanied personal shipments (packages that are mailed or shipped), however, may be subject to limitations on amount.\n\nOn January 1, 2005, quotas for all countries that are part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) were eliminated. There are still some countries, like Vietnam, that are not part of the WTO that have quotas in place for commercial shipments. These countries may require an additional document called a \"visa\" accompany the shipment.\n\nChina could have limits on particular garments called \"safeguards.\" It is recommended that you contact a CBP import specialist in your area or at the port where you plan to import to determine what countries are subject to quotas and what products from China are subject to safeguards.\n\nThere may be additional documentation required for textiles from other countries such as the African countries that require a visa to be placed on a commercial invoice in order to get duty-free treatment. There may also be a certificate of eligibility document requirement to get duty-free treatment under many of the free trade agreements that are negotiated between the United States and the foreign government. These are not admissibility documents, but allow you to import your garments duty-free, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nCBP enforces laws relating to the protection of trademarks and copyrights. Articles that infringe a federally registered trademark or copyright or copyright protected by the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works are subject to detention and/ or seizure. Infringing articles may consist of articles that use a protected right without the authorization of the trademark or copyright owner or articles that copy or simulate a protected right.\n\nArticles bearing marks that are counterfeit or inappropriately using a federally registered trademark are subject to seizure and forfeiture. The importation of articles intended for sale or public distribution bearing counterfeit marks may subject an individual to a civil fine if the registered trademark has also been recorded with CBP. Articles bearing marks that are confusingly similar to a CBP recorded registered trademark, and restricted gray market articles (goods bearing genuine marks not intended for U.S. importation for which CBP granted gray market protection) are subject to detention and seizure.\n\nHowever, travelers arriving in the United States may be permitted an exemption and allowed to import one article of each type, which must accompany the person, bearing a counterfeit, confusingly similar or restricted gray market trademark, provided that the article is for personal use and is not for sale.\n\nThis exemption may be granted not more than once every 30 days. The arriving passenger may retain one article of each type accompanying the person. For example, an arriving person who has three purses, whether each bears a different infringing trademark, or whether all three bear the same infringing trademark, is permitted only one purse. If the article imported under the personal exemption provision is sold within one year after the date of importation, the article or its value is subject to forfeiture.\n\nIn regard to copyright infringement, articles that are determined by CBP to be clearly piratical of a protected copyright, i.e., unauthorized articles that are substantially similar to a material protected by a copyright, are subject to seizure. A personal use exemption for articles, similar to that described above also applies to copyrighted articles for the personal, non-commercial use of the importer and are not for sale or distribution.\n\nYou may bring back genuine trademarked and copyrighted articles (subject to duties). Products subject to copyright protection most commonly imported include software on CD-ROMs, sound recordings, toys, stuffed animals, clothing with cartoon characters, videotapes, DVDs, music CDs and books. Products subject to trademark protection most commonly imported include handbags and accessories, and clothing."
