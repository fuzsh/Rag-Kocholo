        "text": "Learning Objectives\n\nIdentify and discuss the four main types of linguistic expressions.\n\nDiscuss the power of language to express our identities, affect our credibility, control others, and perform actions.\n\nDiscuss some of the sources of fun within language.\n\nExplain how neologisms and slang contribute to the dynamic nature of language.\n\nIdentify the ways in which language can separate people and bring them together.\n\nWhat utterances make up our daily verbal communication? Some of our words convey meaning, some convey emotions, and some actually produce actions. Language also provides endless opportunities for fun because of its limitless, sometimes nonsensical, and always changing nature. In this section, we will learn about the five functions of language, which show us that language is expressive, language is powerful, language is fun, language is dynamic, and language is relational."
