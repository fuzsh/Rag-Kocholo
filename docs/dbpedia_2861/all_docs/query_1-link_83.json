Did you know that approximately 1/3 of enslaved Africans in what came to be the United States came from predominantly Islamic parts of West Africa? Did you know that “Islam”, usually translated as “peace” and “submission,” more correctly means “commitment”? This course introduces students to religious currents in the Islamic world, past and present.\n\nARAB 382C – Contemporary Issues in Arabic - Professor Mary Youssef\n\nThis is an Arabic language course, in which students achieve proficiency and a comparative perspective in discussing and interpreting pressing contemporary issues in Arabic, especially those that pertain to the Arab world, the Middle East, and their immigrant communities across the globe. The course focuses on reading, writing, discussing, and listening to specialized studies, commentaries, news coverage from versatile media outlets, and important social media sites. Topics covered in the course range from politics, culture, and the arts to economy and science and technology\n\nARAB 385C/ISRL 315/JUST 315 - Israeli-Palestinian Conflict – Professor Shay Rabineau – Gen Eds: GN\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Israel-Palestine comprises the territory that lies between the Mediterranean Sea (on the west), Lebanon (in the north), the Gulf of Aqaba and the Sinai Peninsula (on the south) and the Jordan River (on the east).\n\nARAB 386C/AFST 383P/COLI 380T/ENG 300K/HMRT 389F/WGSS 383C – Comics and the Middle East – Professor Mary Youssef - Gen Eds: AGOTI & Harpur W\n\nThis course explores comics and graphic novels that portray the Middle East, its peoples, and their experiences. We will read comics and graphic novels that are written or illustrated by authors and artists from the Middle East in dialogue with those created by their counterparts from across the globe—so long as the Middle East, its diasporas, and their communities (as part and parcel of our connected world) are the focus of their works. Examples of the comics and graphic novels we will study range from world-renowned works such as Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood and Joe Sacco’s Palestine to Magdy El Shafee’s Metro: A Story of Cairo, Malaka Gharib’s I Was their American Dream, and Zeina Abirached’s I remember Beirut. Some of these works are written originally in English and some others will be read in English translation from their original languages, such as Arabic.\n\nARAB 101 (2 Sections) – First-year Arabic I – Instructor: Mona Azzam\n\nArabic is the fastest growing language in the United States and the fifth most spoken language in the world. ARAB 101 /ARAB 501 is the first in a sequence of courses in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of all official forms of communication and media throughout the Arab world, the register of Arabic taught in countries where Arabic is an official language, the liturgical language of more than two billion Muslims worldwide and millions of Arab Christians, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations.

We will consider the image and portrayal of these figures with their portrayal in the Bible. Special focus will be given to how Quranic translators and commentators have understood, interpreted, and negotiated their stories.\n\nARAB 102 (2 Sections) – First-year Arabic II – Professor Mona Azzam\n\nThe language of all official forms of communication and media throughout the Arab world, the register of Arabic taught in countries where Arabic is an official language, the liturgical language of more than two billion Muslims worldwide and millions of Arab Christians, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\n\nARAB 204 (01) – Second-year Arabic II – Professor Mona Azzam\n\nThe language of all official forms of communication and media throughout the Arab world, the register of Arabic taught in countries where Arabic is an official language, the liturgical language of more than two billion Muslims worldwide and millions of Arab Christians, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations. In this course, students will continue to acquire more vocabulary and learn fundamental morphological and syntactical structures that allow them to express themselves and respond to communication with ease in predictable situations; request and provide information; write and speak comprehensibly at the sentence level; read basic texts through making use of contextual knowledge and familiar vocabulary; and listen to and comprehend simple and straightforward speech—one utterance at a time. As no language exists in a vacuum, learning about Arab culture will constitute an integral component of this course.\n\nARAB 306/506 – Third-year Arabic II – Professor Mary Youssef\n\nARAB 306/506 is the sixth in a sequence of courses in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of all official forms of communication and media throughout the Arab world, the register of Arabic taught in countries where Arabic is an official language, the liturgical language of more than two billion Muslims worldwide and millions of Arab Christians, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations. In this course, students will continue to learn important idioms and expressions, significantly expand their vocabulary.\n\nARAB 310 – Egyptian Colloquial Arabic – Professor Mary Youssef\n\nThis course is an introduction to the vernacular of Arabic used in Egypt, for students who have completed at least three semesters of training in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA) is not only the native language of the most populous Arab country, it is also the most widely understood spoken variety of Arabic, due in large measure to Egypt’s geographic location, its social and political influence, and the proliferation and popularity of Egyptian cinema, music and literature throughout the Arab world since the early part of the twentieth century.\n\nARAB 150 – Intro to Islam: Texts & Contexts – Professor Omid Ghaemmaghami – Gen Eds: GH and Harpur W\n\nThis course is a textual survey (in English or English translation) of religious currents in the Islamic world, past and present. We will begin by looking at the origins of Islam, and placing the most salient textual expressions of its principles, practices, and beliefs in their historical context. In an attempt to explore the enduring ties that bind the myriad interpretations of Islam across time and\n\nspace to their universal foundations, each week will be devoted to a different theme.\n\nARAB 180B– Intro to Modern Arabic Lit – Professor Kevin Lacey – Gen Eds: CH\n\nThis course is designed to give students a first sustained glance at modern Arabic literature by way of a survey, through English translations, of some of the more seminal authors and works. Reading assignments will entail works (either in their entirety or parts thereof) of celebrated novelists, short story writers, play writers, essayists, and poets. Lectures and discussions as well as the examinations and the composition requirement for the course will revolve around these works.\n\nARAB 281E/AFST 251 - Islamic Cultures in Africa- Professor Ali Bouanani – Gen Ed: H and Harpur W\n\nIslam has a rich cultural and artistic heritage in Africa. With a history that goes back to the seventh century, it is now a vital part of the African cultural landscape. This introductory course explores a range of Islamic cultural productions from the advent of Islam to modern times by Muslim men and women in different regions of Africa from North to South and from East to West.\n\nARAB 380A – Framing Other Cultures - Professor Kevin Lacey – Gen Eds: AHO\n\nThis course will examine latent as well as manifest Orientalism, its structures and strictures, its current most disquieting offshoots (Arabophobia and Islamophobia, especially with respect to Palestinians), how deeply it is inscribed (especially regarding Arab and Islamic civilizations) within \"enabling\" U.S. policies and institutions, and its association with aspirations of exclusion, domination, and control.\n\nARAB 385C/ISRL 315/JUST 315 - Israeli-Palestinian Conflict – Instructor: Shay Rabineau – GenEds: GN\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Israel-Palestine comprises the territory that lies between the Mediterranean Sea (on the west), Lebanon (in the north), the Gulf of Aqaba and the Sinai Peninsula (on the south) and the Jordan River (on the east).\n\nARAB 101 (2 Sections) – First-year Arabic I.\n\nArabic is the fastest growing language in the United States and the fifth most spoken language in the world. ARAB 101 /ARAB 501 is the first in a sequence of courses in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of all official forms of communication and media throughout the Arab world, the register of Arabic taught in countries where Arabic is an official language, the liturgical language of more than two billion Muslims worldwide and millions of Arab Christians, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations. In this course, students will be introduced to the letters, sounds, and symbols that make up the Arabic writing system, and acquire basic skills in the areas of speaking, reading, writing, and listening.\n\nARAB 203 (01) – Second-year Arabic I – Instructor:\n\nStudents will acquire more vocabulary and learn fundamental morphological and syntactical structures that allow them to express themselves and respond to communication with ease in predictable situations.\n\nARAB 180B – Intro to Modern Arabic Lit - Professor Kevin Lacey – GenEds: CH\n\nThis course is designed to give students a first sustained glance at modern Arabic literature by way of a survey, through English translations, of some of the more seminal authors and works. Reading assignments will entail works (either in their entirety or parts thereof) of celebrated novelists, short story writers, play writers, essayists, and poets. Lectures and discussions as well as the examinations and the composition requirement for the course will revolve around these works.\n\nARAB 305 – Third-year Arabic I – Professor Omid Ghaemmaghami\n\nIn this course, students will learn important idioms and expressions, significantly expand their vocabulary, and acquire further knowledge of fundamental morphological and syntactical structures that allow them to express themselves orally and in writing with increasing grammatical accuracy.\n\nARAB 380A – Framing Other Cultures - Professor Kevin Lacey – GenEds: AHO\n\nThis course will examine latent as well as manifest Orientalism, its structures and strictures, its current most disquieting offshoots (Arabophobia and Islamophobia, especially with respect to Palestinians), how deeply it is inscribed (especially regarding Arab and Islamic civilizations) within \"enabling\" U.S. policies and institutions, and its association with aspirations of exclusion, domination, and control.\n\nARAB 480E/AFST 480M/COLI 535N/ ENG 562C/TRIP 480F & 580L – World Afro-Arab Voices in Lit – Professor Mary Youssef\n\nSituating itself at the intersections of postcolonial studies, critical race studies, African and Arab Diasporic literatures, and Arabic literature, this course explores a number of Afro-Arab literary texts authored by writers who identify as African and Arab whether in the Arab world or in the diaspora. The course examines how Afro-Arab authors negotiate their identity, no matter where they are, in response to persistently exclusive discourses othering them from a different, dominant self on the basis of race and culture. In other words, this course pays attention to this overlooked hyphenated identity, Afro-Arab/Arab-African, and its imaginative expression of who, how, and where it is in the world.\n\nARAB 102 (2 Sections) – Elementary Arabic II – Instructor: Badreddine Ben Othman\n\nThis course is the sequel course to ARAB 101: Elementary Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) II. In this course, students will continue to improve their essential language skills as well as cultural knowledge of the Arab world. Students will continue to be introduced to new vocabulary, learn to recognize word roots, and internalize sets of new morphological and syntactical formulas that will expand their Arabic expressions and help them exchange information about self, family, and immediate needs. In this course, students will learn to use the dictionary on the basis of their education in the Arabic root system. In-class activities may include watching scenes from documentaries and films and listening to popular music.\n\nARAB 204 (01) – Intermediate Arabic II – Instructor: Kevin Lacey\n\nThis course is the sequel to ARAB 203: Intermediate Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) I. Throughout the semester, students will continue improving their language skills with the aim of reaching the proficiency goals of the high-intermediate level. They will expand their vocabulary, learn important idioms and expressions, and acquire further knowledge of fundamental morphological and syntactical structures that allow them to express themselves with ease in predictable situations and read and write with increasing grammatical accuracy.\n\nARAB 306 – Advanced Standard Arabic II – Instructor: Mary Youssef\n\nThe sequel to ARAB 305, this course prepares students to reach or surpass the goals of the advanced-low level of proficiency in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Throughout the semester, students will significantly expand their vocabulary and acquire further knowledge of fundamental morphological and syntactical structures that allow them to express themselves orally and in writing with increasing grammatical accuracy.\n\nARAB 380B – The Postcolonial Arabic Novel – Instructor: Mary Youssef – GenEds: GHO & Harpur W\n\nThis course examines, through the critical lens of postcolonial theory, novels and fictional autobiographies—all in English translations—that are written by Arab authors from different parts of the Arab world: Egypt, Palestine, Libya, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and the Sudan. The literary works are set in colonial, post-independence, and neocolonial times and illustrate how Arab writers creatively respond to dominant forms of power in their historical contexts. We will pay attention to issues of imperialism, nationalism, tradition, modernity, identity, migration, democracy, and revolution as they arise in these texts.\n\nARAB 380P – Modern Arabic Prose Readings – Instructor: Kevin Lacey\n\nReadings in Modern Standard Arabic prose, from selected authors and genres (e.g., short stories, essays, plays). The course is designed for Arabic language students at Binghamton University who have completed at least five semesters of study of modern standard Arabic. Prerequisite: ARAB 305 or higher.\n\nARAB 385C/ISRL 315 - Israeli-Palestinian Conflict – Instructor: Shay Rabineau – GenEds: GN\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Israel-Palestine comprises the territory that lies between the Mediterranean Sea (on the west), Lebanon (in the north), the Gulf of Aqaba and the Sinai Peninsula (on the south) and the Jordan River (on the east). Although it covers a small geographic area and includes a relatively small population (compare present-day Israel's 8 million citizens with Egypt's 90 million), the dispute between the two rival sets of nationalisms which claim the sole right to control this territory has remained at the forefront of international attention for more than half a century.\n\nARAB 101 (2 Sections) – Elementary Arabic I – Instructor: Ali Almajnooni\n\nArabic is the fasting growing language in the United States and the fifth most spoken language in the world. ARAB 101 is the first in a sequence of courses in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of all official forms of communication and media throughout the Arab world, the register of Arabic taught in countries where Arabic is an official language, the liturgical language of some 1.8 billion Muslims and millions of Arab Christians, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\n\nARAB 203 (01) – Intermediate Arabic I – Instructor: Kevin Lacey\n\nThis course is a continuation of the first-year language study of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), by which students improve their language skills from the novice-high level to reach the proficiency goals of the intermediate level. Students will acquire more vocabulary and learn fundamental morphological and syntactical structures that allow them to express themselves and respond to communication with ease.\n\nARAB 281A – Arabic Word Formation I - Instructor: Kevin Lacey\n\nThis course is designed to help students of Arabic (especially those at pre-advanced levels) improve their knowledge of the most basic word patterns in the language, which are both 1) very predictable and 2) the key for allowing rapid vocabulary build-up in all skill sets (reading, writing, listening comprehension, and speaking). Arabic works on a pattern system. PREREQUISITE: knowledge of the Arabic alphabet.\n\nARAB 305 – Advanced Standard Arabic I – Instructor: Mary Youssef\n\nThe sequel to ARAB 204, this course prepares students to reach or surpass the goals of the intermediate-high to advanced-low levels of proficiency. Throughout the semester, students will learn important idioms and expressions, significantly expand their vocabulary, and acquire further knowledge of fundamental morphological and syntactical structures that allow them to express themselves orally and in writing with increasing grammatical accuracy.\n\nARAB 380G/COLI 331C/ENG 380K/WGSS 383B – Race & Gender in Arab American Lit – Instructor: Mary Youssef - GenEds: HOP & Harpur W\n\nThis course offers a deep understanding of Arab-American literary production across the genres of the novel, poetry, the short story, and fictional autobiography. While interest in Arab immigrant literature in the U.S. has particularly culminated after the events of 9/11, authors from Arab descent have striven to creatively express their racial, religious, and cultural difference; draw attention to problems of differentiation in the U.S. due to persistently dominant Orientalist discourses; and negotiate their identity, all since the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nTURK 203/503 – Intermediate Modern Turkish I – Professor Greg Key – ONLINE HYBRID COURSE\n\nModern Turkish skills are further developed through speaking inside the classroom, interaction with native-speaker language partners, reading authentic texts containing more complex structures than in the first year, watching and listening to authentic on- line materials such as news broadcasts and television dramas, and writing short weekly essays. Awareness of the distinctive features of Turkish culture is developed through all of these means.\n\nTURK 282C/CINE 286F/COLI 281D/HIST 285B – Turkish Pop Culture History – Professor Greg Key\n\nThe language of all official forms of communication and media throughout the Arab world, the register of Arabic taught in countries\n\nwhere Arabic is an official language, the liturgical language of more than two billion Muslims worldwide and millions of Arab\n\nChristians, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\n\nhe language of all official forms of communication and media throughout the Arab world, the register of Arabic taught in countries\n\nwhere Arabic is an official language, the liturgical language of more than two billion Muslims worldwide and millions of Arab\n\nChristians, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\n\nARAB 306/506 is the sixth in a sequence of courses in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of all official forms of\n\ncommunication and media throughout the Arab world, the register of Arabic taught in countries where Arabic is an official language,\n\nthe liturgical language of more than two billion Muslims worldwide and millions of Arab Christians, and one of the six official\n\nlanguages of the United Nations.\n\nThe focus of the class is on pop culture in the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey through the end of the 20th century. The\n\ncourse title is intentionally ambiguous: It is both a history of Turkish pop culture, and a history of Turkey told through the lens of\n\npopular culture. It follows historical developments in music, cinema, radio, and television, as well as print media. While the course\n\ndoes not systematically track current pop culture, through-lines are drawn that do lead to the 21st century."
