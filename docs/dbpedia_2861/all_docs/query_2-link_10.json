        "text": "Time to jump in here, seems a little Roborock-minded.\n\nIt depends on your wishes regarding the integration into HA and the use of a cloud or not.\n\nThe only firmware I know, that is cloud independent, is Valetudo. It works on a lot of vacuums, but it is some knowledge needed, to get it installed. But after you got that hurdle, it is very nice, doesn‚Äôt need internet- or cloud-connection at all and does a pretty good job in running your vacuum.\n\nI run Valetudo on a Dreame Z10Pro.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to be cloud-free, than Roborock is one of the alternatives. I would as well take Dreame or Xiaomi into account. Dreame is the manufacturer for most Xiaomi vacuums, meaning it‚Äôs a good address to check for inexpensive vacuums. But keep in mind, with Roborock Roomba it‚Äôs Amazon, who get‚Äôs your data, with Xiaomi or Dreame it‚Äôs a Chinese company. Make of that whatever you want.\n\nBut it‚Äôs difficult, to help you out here and give you a recommendation. The use cases are simply too much. Do you mostly have carpet or hard floor? Want a laser or camera navigation and so on. I‚Äôd advise to look for some comparison websites in your country, so the tests you can read are for models you can actually buy.\n\nTake a look at the Valetudo website, there are a few models shown, maybe there‚Äôs something on the list for your use case.\n\nEDIT. changed ‚ÄúRoborock‚Äù to ‚ÄúRoomba‚Äù\n\nSee also the Valetudo Newcomer Guide, which states in part (emphasis added):\n\nValetudo is a cloud replacement for vacuum robots enabling local-only operation. It is not a custom firmware.\n\nIt‚Äôs great. I use it with a Roborock S5, a Dreame Z10 Pro, and a Dreame W10.\n\nThat said, there are good reasons not to use Valetudo, and the project‚Äôs maintainer, S√∂ren Beye, requests that users not talk others into using it:\n\nFirst of all, please do not try to convince people to use Valetudo.\n\nWe all know how terribly it usually turns out when people try to convince their friends to use linux on their desktop. Using Valetudo only makes sense if you understand its goals and feel like they are important to you. Everything else will fail.\n\nRoborock is also a Chinese company.\n\nBeijing Roborock Technology Co., Ltd. engages in the design, development, production, and sales of robotic home cleaners and other cleaning appliances. Its products features sweeping and mopping, intelligent route planning, and application control. The company was founded on July 4, 2014 and is headquartered in Beijing, China.\n\nXiaomi invested in and has hardware built by Roborock as well as Dreame.\n\nIn July 2014, our company was established.\n\nIn September 2014, we received the investment from Xiaomi and became a member enterprise of Xiaomi ecological chain.\n\niRobot, not previously mentioned in this thread, is an American company, founded in 1990, who manufacture the Roomba line of robotic vacuum cleaners, and has for nearly a year been in negotiations for sale to Amazon.\n\nNo, I expect newbies not to install Valetudo. You might tell them that this is not replacement firmware‚Äìit cannot change the robot‚Äôs functionality‚Äìbut rather is software that protects your data and enables you to connect your robot to your home automation system without having to detour through a vendor cloud, that its target user is not a newbie, that no support is available from the maintainer, and that reverting changes made by it to your robot will be difficult at best, and likely impossible.\n\nFrom the aforementioned newcomer guide:\n\nWho is Valetudo for?\n\nValetudo can be used by anyone with a basic understanding of the english language.\n\nNote:\n\nWhile Valetudo can be used by anyone with a basic understanding of the english language, it cannot be installed just with those skills.\n\nTo install Valetudo you will need some understanding of linux-ish operating systems as well as computers in general and maybe even some basic hardware hacking stuff. If you lack these skills, please consider asking a friend or computer repair shop to help you with that."
