        "text": "INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING JVST MANUSCRIPTS\n\nJVST B Special Collection\n\n2024 International Symposium of the Vacuum Society of the Philippines\n\nManuscript deadline: September 17, 2024 July 17, 2024\n\nPapers presented at ISVSP 2024 may be submitted for publication in a Special Collection within the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B (JVST B). The deadline for manuscript submission to JVST B is July 17, 2024. Submit your manuscripts to JVST B and select the ISVSP 2024 Collection using the journal’s online manuscript submission system at http://jvstb.peerx-press.org. In preparing your article, please follow the instructions for contributors, which may be found on the Information for Contributors link at https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/pages/manuscript.\n\nNo Page Charges: AVS Journals do not require page charges. AVS also offers free membership for one year to the corresponding author on accepted JVST papers, which includes journal access.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to use the JVST templates. The easiest way to prepare your manuscript is to use the available JVST Article Template to delete and replace text as necessary. Article templates can be found at https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/pages/manuscript.\n\nNote that acceptance to present at the conference does not guarantee the acceptance of your manuscript in JVST B. Papers will be reviewed according to criteria set by JVST and must meet JVST standards for both technical contents and written English. To be published in JVST B, the manuscript must:\n\npresent original findings, conclusions, or analyses that have not been published previously by the authors or others,\n\nbe free of errors and ambiguities,\n\nsupport conclusions with data and analysis,\n\nbe written clearly, and\n\nhave high impact in its field, which must be within the scope of topics covered by the journal\n\nNote: Authors should select “Article” as the type of paper within the conference special issue (not Letter, Note, etc.)\n\nIt is very IMPORTANT that authors indicate to which Collection the paper is submitted. Online, you will have an opportunity to tell us that your paper is a part of this Collection by choosing the Special Topic or Conference Collection “Papers from The 2024 International Symposium of the Vacuum Society of the Philippines (ISVSP 2024)” from the drop-down list in the Manuscript Classification tab.\n\nPlease refer to the JVST B journal web page for details about manuscript preparation.\n\nNote: Please observe the deadline to allow for timely processing. JVST will try to include papers submitted after this deadline in the Collection, but these papers may not be included. However, if accepted, papers can still be published as regular articles."
