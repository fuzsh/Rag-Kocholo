AVS is a member society of the American Institute of Physics.[3] AVS publishes through the American Institute of Physics the journals Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology (JVST A and B) and Biointerphases, which are devoted to peer-reviewed articles, and Surface Science Spectra (SSS), which publishes peer-reviewed articles with reference spectra of technological and scientific interest. In 2019 American Institute of Physics and AVS launched jointly a new journal, AVS Quantum Science.[5]

AVS is composed of 10 technical divisions, two technical groups, 16 regional chapters, two international chapters and one international affiliate:

Advanced Surface Engineering Division[6]

Applied Surface Science Division[7]

Biomaterial Interfaces Division[8]

Electronic Materials/Photonics Division[9]

Magnetic Interfaces and Nanostructures Division[10]

Nanometer-Scale Science and Technology Division

Plasma Science and Technology Division[11]

Surface Science Division[12]

Thin Film Division (TF)[13]

Vacuum Technology Division[14]

AVS Technical Groups Division

Manufacturing Science & Technology Technical Group (MSTG)

MEMS and NEMS Technical Group

The AVS International Symposium and Exhibition is AVS's flagship conference. The symposium addresses cutting-edge issues associated with materials, processing, and interfaces in the research and manufacturing communities. AVS also sponsors a variety of topical conferences, including the International Conference on Atomic Layer Deposition and the North American Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy.
