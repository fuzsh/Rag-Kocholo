IVS vision and goals

Since its inception in 1968, the main goals of the Israel Vacuum Society have been to promote and stimulate professional interconnections and communication among Israeli scientists specializing in the areas of surface science, thin films and vacuum science, and to foster educational activities in these areas at various scientific levels. There is a common understanding that surface science, thin films and vacuum technology should be regarded in a broad sense. Accordingly, members of the society work in a wide range of fields including nanotechnology, optoelectronics, low-k dielectrics, hard coatings, thin films, self-assembly, sensors, bio-interfaces, electronic materials, MEMS, thermodynamics and kinetics of processes, and surface dynamics.

The IVS goals are met by a variety of activities among which are:

I. National Conferences, including Scientific Sessions, Commercial Exhibition

II. Workshops on topical subjects.

III. Courses in a range of topics such as surface science, calibration and measurement of vacuum equipment.

IV. Encouraging the activities of scientists, graduate students and technicians by recognizing excellence through awarding prizes and travel scholarships.

V. Fostering international connections by inviting distinct non-Israeli plenary speakers, by setting English as the official language at IVS meetings and by maintaining close relationship with international and sister societies abroad.

The IVS is a member of the International Union for Vacuum Science Technique and Applications (IUVSTA) and has a cooperative agreement with the American Vacuum Society (AVS).

You are invited to join us and to take part in our activities.

Sincerely,

Daniel Nessim

IVS President, 2020
