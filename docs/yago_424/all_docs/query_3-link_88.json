        "text": "READ MORE: Review: Ben Wheatley’s ‘High Rise’ Stars Tom Hiddleston in a Demented Class War\n\nIf the striking teaser poster for “High-Rise” wasn’t enough to satisfy your Ben Wheatley appetite this week, fortunately there’s a hypnotic new trailer that star Tom Hiddleston has debuted on his Twitter page.\n\nBased on J.G. Ballard’s 1975 sci-fi novel, the thriller focuses on the class warfare that breaks out in a high-rise condo following a series of power outages. Hiddleston leads the ensemble cast, which also includes Elisabeth Moss, Sienna Miller, Luke Evans and Jeremy Irons.\n\n“High-Rise” has been touring the festival circuit over the past several months, earning solid buzz out of TIFF last September and setting Wheatley fans into a tizzy. No U.S. release date has been set, but you can watch the dazzling new UK trailer below."
