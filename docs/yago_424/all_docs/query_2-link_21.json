        "text": "Playing with friends is fun. Playing alone is realistic. But when a game gives you the option to do both, you can at least buy it with the hope that someday you won’t have to do the latter. Heavily inspired by The Lost Vikings of old, Grave Danger seems like the kind of fun, puzzle-y platformer you’ll want to sink your teeth into.\n\nIn development by JB Gaming, Grave Danger is a 2D puzzle platformer set around three outlaws, wanted “Dead And Alive,” who go out to clear their name, fighting off everyone standing in their way. The core of the game centers around the three protagonists, a cowboy, a wizard, and a reaper. Much like Trine, each character has their own weapon types and abilities, which will come in handy when trying to traverse the different sections of the game and solve the puzzles blocking your path. You can play alone and control each character separately, or play with your friends as each of you work together to reach the end of the map.\n\nThe art is fantastically fun and light, very reminiscent of The Lost Vikings, but for the modern generation. JB Gaming has also said that they were very much inspired by the sense of humor and campiness of the classic Blizzard platformer, which I can very much get behind."
