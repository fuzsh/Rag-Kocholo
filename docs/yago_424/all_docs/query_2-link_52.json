They've been scaring up a spooky themed release for this wonderful holiday annually since 2018 (they missed out on 2020 for obvious reasons).\n\nThis year's treat, with no tricks, is “Wake the Dead”. Like 2021's entry, the band is releasing only a single track this year (2018 and 2019 are EPs). Still any Grave Danger is better than no Grave Danger. Skank out below, and visit their Bandcamp or Spotify for more.\n\nWake the Dead by Grave Danger"
