        "text": "Since my birthday is up coming, may this be my present to you all.\n\nEnjoy NinjagoLovers!\n\n===\n\nWe all reached the Endless sea, where the Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master is located. I look at the glass, admiring the sea creatures underwater. Fishes, squid, seahorse and sharks can be seen underwater, including corals, seaweed and rocks.\n\n\"We're almost to the Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master\" Zane stated.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Cole agreed, \"Can't believe we're almost there, after all, we've been through\"\n\n\"Being underwater is so cool,\" I awed when I saw a fish similar to Dory, but was eaten by a shark \"And scary at the same time\"\n\nKai look out the glass and gulped, \"I can't believe I'm underwater\"\n\n\"You? What about me? Just how thick is this glass?\" Worried Cole and taps the glass a couple of times, making sure it is safe.\n\nThe screen turned to the Bounty, revealing both Master Wu and Misako, \"We're heading to your location now. With Morro already ahead of you and able to foresee the traps protecting the tomb with the Sword of Sanctuary, it's going to be up to you five to find the Realm Crystal before he does.\"\n\n\"Hehe, Cole's a Ghost, Kai can't swim, we have no magical sword or Elemental Powers. Y/N just came back alive\" The Blue Ninja laughs nervously \"What could go wrong?\"\n\n\"I may not know the three tests you're about to face, but I discovered a riddle that makes reference to it that may help: 'A Spinjitzu Master can. A Spinjitzu Master cannot. To move forward, don't look ahead, to find his resting spot.' \" Misako lectured.\n\n\"Great, riddles. I hate riddles\" I griped.\n\n\"Huh. That's food for thought\" Cole joked.\n\n\"Speaking of food, we're about to be some!\" Jay quavered.\n\nWe all look at the glass and see blue tentacles trying to reach R.E.X.\n\n\"Is that the fucking Kraken?!\" I quizzed.\n\n\"We have to go faster. Much faster\" Kai instructed and Cole speed up the jet. But the large octopus uses its tentacles to crack the glass. \"Why did the tomb have to be underwater?\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" Cole told us and speed up the Jet again.\n\nI look behind the see the octopus picked up his speed, wanting us to be the octopus meal. \"Is gaining on us!\"\n\n\"Ugh! What kind of weapons is this thing equipped with?\" Jay inquired.\n\n\"We don't need weapons. Aim for that rock!\" Zane ordered, pointing the rock ahead of us.\n\n\"On it\" Cole ventured and do what he was told to.\n\nWe went under a rock and came out of the other said, the octopus that we were being chased tried to follow us but ended up being stuck. We cheered when we made the octopus stuck.\n\n\"Yeah! All right! Atta Boy, R.E.X.! Atta boy!\" Jay burst in joy.\n\nR.E.X. emerge from the water after we reached our destination, the door opened and we all hopped off the jet.\n\n\"If you wanna hide a tomb, this looks like a good place. We're here\" Cole remarked.\n\nWe saw a green cloth on a stick and we already know who the cloth is from.\n\n\"Argh!\" Jay groaned, picking up the cloth and looking ahead to see footprints \"There goes any hope Morro couldn't find this place\"\n\n\"Hey, stay positive.\" Kai counseled \"We're about to risk our lives going through traps we know nothing about. All we have to rely on is each other. At least feel lucky we got this far\""
