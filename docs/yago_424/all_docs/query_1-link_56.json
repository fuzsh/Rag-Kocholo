        "text": "In this level you’ll need a Regular Wizard, Dark Wizard, Weasley, Deluminator Character, Bag Character, and Digging Character.\n\nFirst Time\n\nWhile playing this area, use Wingardium Leviosa on five bouquets of flowers (one immediately to the right in front of the grave, one near the Weasley box, one in front of another grave to the right, one in front of another grave down the path, and the final one in front of yet another grave to the far right) to get the Hufflepuff Crest piece. Shake the snow off the top of the grave and use Hermione to check if it’s the right one. The correct grave, you’ll find, is toward the middle, and you must assemble and use a salt dispenser to melt the snow before checking it.\n\nUse Reducto on the lock to get a bag plate for Hermione. Use Aguamenti to fill the can and put out the fire, then arrange the pieces into some teeth and chomp away the books on the stairs.\n\nAvoid Nagini’s shots by running, then throw whatever falls and use Wingardium Leviosa to be able to move closer. Around the middle of the battle, you must use Hermione’s bag plate and pull out a hammer to use.\n\nFree Play\n\nTo the far right there is a cage-ish thing that the Student In Peril is trapped inside. To get him out, use Dark Magic on the bars in the front. Go back to the start of the level and use the Weasley box to open the gate. Shoot the statue and jump up on it to get the Lily Potter character token. Then use a digging character on the spot, go out of the gate to put on some Spectrespecs, and use them to build a statue and get the Gryffindor Crest piece. Use a Deluminator character to take the light from the lamp here to the Diffindo wall on the far right. Use the recently discovered bag plate and wind up the record player to cause some ghosts to dance. Once they’ve finished, you’ll get the Ravenclaw Crest piece.\n\nUsing Dark Magic on the door in the back of Bathilda’s house will let you into a secret area. Here you can throw the garbage away and put the lid on the trash bin to get the Slytherin Crest piece. Also, use Wingardium Leviosa to run the item through the press for the Bathilda (Snake) character token. Shoot the spider hanging from the wall here, the two in the previous room, and one in the final area to get the Harry (Godric’s Hollow) character token.\n\nAfterward\n\nUse Hermione’s bag plate, then use the dragon to melt away the snow and follow the Patronus."
