        "text": "Get it?\n\nYou're in Grave Danger is the ultimate death handling mod. With this mod you can configure almost every aspect of when you die, from items you lose, to items you keep, to items you drop, to xp, to effects you get when respawning, to health and hunger values being set when respawning, and much more.\n\nA big part of this mod, although it is technically an optional feature, are the gravestones (feature enabled by default). These gravestones generate when you die, and stores your loot, until you reclaim it. The graves are also highly configurable, to where they can and can't generate, to what will end up in your grave, how you retrieve your items, as well as many more configuration options.\n\nGraves will also remember the layout of your items, and replace this layout when grave is claimed. This is however configurable, and weather the grave layout or your current layout should be prioritized can be changed through the config.\n\nThe graves are also equipped with rendering features, like rendering a head of the deceased player, and their name, that will help you keep track of whose grave is who's when playing with your friends. All rendering can be configured.\n\nThe mod is available for 1.16.5 and all later versions!\n\nSince the release of the 1.20 release, no older versions will be maintained actively.\n\nYou're in Grave Danger (YiGD for short) is compatible with all inventory mods known to me (developer of YiGD), with some examples including trinkets, travelers backpack, and inventorio.\n\nThe mod is also compatible with all soulbound enchantments, as long as they're added to the soulbound config.\n\nGraves can be waterlogged, and renders can be adapted to the block the grave is standing on.\n\nThe mod also includes a large number of other features. If you're intrigued by what YiGD can do, check the configs. The mod includes components that can control various aspects of the following, when a player die:\n\nPlayer Inventory\n\nPlayer experience points\n\nPlayer Respawn event\n\nGraves\n\nAdditional registries such as a few items and enchantments\n\nIf you found ANYTHING there is not a config for, that you'd like to be configurable, let me know through discord, github, or similar, and I'll see about making this configurable\n\nIf you find any bug/missing config, or have a cool idea that would fit in the theme of the mod, please open an issue on the github issue tracker\n\nThe mod is under MIT license, so feel free to use this in your modpack!\n\nThis mod is required both on client and server, as it will add custom blocks and renderers. It's intended for use in modpacks. If you're looking for a server side only grave mod, I'd recommend Universal Graves"
