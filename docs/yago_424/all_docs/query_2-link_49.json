        "text": "Really fun! A little tough for bad hands to play. I recommend games don't ask to hold something for long periods or repeatedly click on them, like in Garden Simulator that came out I think late last year, they had to change their clipping function where you could hold it down instead of repeatedly clicking? Got painful to constantly click the whole game. I'm not using the function the entire time but the pace of the game, you can afford the break. In this one, the entire game I'm holding it down and it gets painful pretty fast. Making it toggleable isn't hard! Or a toggle setting, to make it toggleable! haha.\n\nLong winded explanation: Gimme a toggle option if you make another game like this.\n\nVery lovely game! I thought the challenge level was just right. I had to take a first run to get the hang of things. After a tense few waves, I got upgrades and the difficulty flattened out. Around wave 5, I think I had enough health that surviving the wave was no longer very hard. All the same, I enjoyed it! Very charming art and audio!\n\nI noticed a bug when shooting at the rock throwers. If you aim around their feet, especially when south of them, arrows from the crossbow appear to get lodged in an invisible barrier and they do not take damage\n\nOk, first off, I love your videos about game dev. As an aspiring game dev as well, I think it's really cool how you're dedicating yourself a lot on this. But I'm not here to talk about that. This game is amazing!\n\nMusic - 9/10, really feels like I'm a medieval dude killing a bunch of monsters.\n\nArt - 10/10, a charming art style that really sucks you into the game world.\n\nGameplay - 8/10, fun gameplay. Psychics is absolutely amazing, however it got a little boring and stale toward the double digit waves.\n\nNow for some problems I encountered and things I suggest to improve this game:\n\n1. Enemies would hit me when they were outside the little walled sections and I was inside.\n\n2. Game doesn't really pause when you hit pause. When I hit pause, I noticed that the only things that happen is that the enemies and you stop moving, but you can still let go of and shoot stuff. I think you should use get_tree().paused = true/false when they hit the esc key. Just don't forget to turn the process mode to always in the Control node.\n\n3. I didn't really know when I got hit. I think maybe you could do a screen shake effect so the player really understands they got hit.\n\nOther than that, this game is absolutely amazing for being made in 2 weeks. Can't wait to see what else you're going to make!\n\nP.S here's a picture of the pause script:\n\nall other weapons pale in comparison to the hammer, it is very difficult to play with weapons with a small attack radius, throwing weapon was completely out of my control, the bow and crossbow are made well, but they still lose their meaning because of the hammer in the game, money accumulates in tons and then there is nowhere to put it, there is no ending (you could have done 13 rounds and the final counting in gold and killed monsters), and I would also add durability to weapons and slightly change the logic of the stones so that when a shadow appears, they still move behind the player half the time, and the physics of the attack feels good\n\noverall great! The game style is extremely enjoyable, the perfect game to be the first game created by the author <3\n\nI found the most OP strat instantly. SPOILERS: To just spin the hammer at light speed until I got tendonitis which basically just made it so I had to run into enemies. Got so much money so fast that I had all the items (that I don't know what they do) right away. The only times I took damage was when I didn't see the falling rock out of disinterest. I played wave 10 expecting something to change but it didn't so I gave up after.\n\nBut it feels ok and it looks very pretty. A lot of games feel like they have stiff sprites when they're drawn like this but the animation really made them pop and felt fluid.\n\nI love that items feel like they're in the world. I always want that in games, never stop doing that.\n\nHere's an idea for a boss character:\n\nThe Grave Keeper - Skeletal Warden of the Graveyard\n\nThe Grave Keeper is the skeletal, ghoulish figure who reigns over the graveyard. With his haunting appearance and massive scythe, he ruthlessly eliminates any who dare to defy his twisted authority.\n\nDriven by an insatiable hunger for power, the Grave Keeper views the graveyard as his kingdom. He will stop at nothing to expand his macabre domain, making him a truly formidable and uncompromising threat for players to face.\n\nOr something like that. Haha!\n\nCool game!"
