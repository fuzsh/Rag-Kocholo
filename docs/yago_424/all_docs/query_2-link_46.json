        "text": "Texas authorities have launched Amber Alerts for two young boys \"in grave danger\" who were last seen Tuesday night.\n\nThe Dewitt County Sheriff's Office is searching for 4-year-old Aiydann Ribera and 5-year-old Angel Ribera.\n\nThey were last seen at 9 p.m. Tuesday at the 120 Block of East 5th Street, Yorktown, Texas.\n\nThe police are looking for Julian Ribera in connection with their abduction.\n\nThe suspect is driving a black 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe with the Texas license plate number FVK0342.\n\nThe suspect was last seen in San Antonio, Texas. Law enforcement officials believe the children to be in grave or immediate danger.\n\nWhat's an Amber Alert?\n\nAs of 2023, 1,200 children were found through the AMBER Alert system and 180 children were rescued because of the emergency alerts.\n\n\"Every child featured in an AMBER Alert has been reported missing to law enforcement. The goal of an AMBER Alert is to instantly galvanize the community to assist in the search for and safe recovery of a missing child,\" Alan S. Nanavaty, Executive Director of Special Programs for the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, said in a previous interview with Newsweek.\n\nNanavaty said that, on average, there are less than 200 AMBER Alerts issued each year. The alerts are broadcast through radio, TV, road signs, cellphones and other data-enabled devices. The AMBER Alert system is being used in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Indian country, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nNewsweek created a map using 2022 data showing states have seen the most Amber alerts in 2022. According to the data, there were 31 Amber Alerts in Texas that year.\n\nActive Amber Alerts issued This Year\n\nThe missing Texas boys are among two other active Amber Alerts this year.\n\nA Wisconsin toddler remains missing three months after an Amber Alert was issued as the child's mother and her boyfriend are facing child neglect charges.\n\nElijah Vue, 3, was last seen on February 20 in Two Rivers while staying with his mother's boyfriend, 39-year-old Jesse Vang. When Vang took a nap and woke up three hours later around 11 a.m., the child was gone.\n\nThe child is 3 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds.\n\n\"He was last seen wearing gray sweat pants, long sleeve dark colored shirt and red and green dinosaur slip on shoes,\" the Amber Alert said.\n\nVang and 31-year-old Katrina Baur, Vue's mother, are being held at the Manitowoc County Jail for child neglect. Baur is scheduled to appear in court again on May 28. Vang's next hearing is June 28.\n\nAcross the country, the search also continues for missing Tennessee teen Sebastian Rogers.\n\nRogers, 15, disappeared late in February from the home he shares with his mother and stepfather in Sumner County, Tennessee. The boy's stepfather, Chris Proudfoot, was working out of town, and mom Katie Proudfoot said her son wasn't in his room when she went to wake him up for school on February 26. There had been no sign of a break-in, suggesting he may have left of his own accord.\n\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation issued an Amber Alert on February 27 for the teen, who was described as having \"a medical condition that may impair his ability to return safely without assistance.\"\n\nThe alert described Rogers as 5 feet 5 inches and weighing 120 pounds. He wears glasses and has brown hair and brown eyes. Rogers was last seen wearing black sweatpants and a black sweatshirt, according to an alert issued by the Sumner County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThis is developing news story. More information will be added as it becomes available."
