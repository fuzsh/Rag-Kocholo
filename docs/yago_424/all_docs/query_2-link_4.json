        "text": "Grave Danger is a daily from Neovia on Neopets.\n\nSite Description[]\n\n\" The catacombs below Neovia are full of treasure, with the danger to match! The chance of being cursed is currently at 93.7%. Savvy adventurers are advised to train Petpets to seek out glorious riches in their stead. Everyone knows that Neopet curses don't work on Petpets. Pfft.\n\nIt's a good thing Petpets long for adventure. Choose one of yours to send into Grave Danger all by itself, where it will face cultists, monsters, and all manner of unspeakable creepiness. Hope it's feeling brave! \"\n\nHistory[]\n\nGrave Danger was released on November 7th, 2013 (7th day of Storing, Y15), being based on the Catacombs portion of the Spooky Food Eating Contest event.\n\nDuring the 2022 Festival of Neggs, a new species of Petpet known as the Talpidat was discovered hiding in the Grave Danger's crypt. It was involved in interfering with that year's Negg hunt.\n\nHow it Works[]\n\nAt the Grave Danger catacombs, the user can send any of their Petpets off on an excursion for an item.\n\nA Petpet's excursion through the catacombs can take anywhere from 4-10 hours, which is determined by the user's computer's time and date settings.\n\nWhile the Petpet is in Grave Danger, the user will not be able to remove it or zap it at the Petpet Lab Ray. Additionally, they will not be able to transfer or abandon the Neopet that the Petpet belongs to. However, Turmaculus can still eat the Petpet.\n\nNC Component[]\n\nThe user can also equip a Ghostly Wand of Spades, Illuminant Head Lantern, or Adventurers Sword and Shield to a Petpet so they can uncover an exclusive NC item during its excursion through Grave Danger. (The equipment must be equipped beforehand.)\n\nStatus Sayings[]\n\nAte a Grumblebug. Batted around an old ring with a triangular symbol. Begging for scraps at the table of a cultist tea party. Being cuddled by an evil cultist. Being taught how to glorp by a Gelatinous Non-Cube. Chased a Skidget past a sewer, a dragon, and a mob of Meepits. Survived. Chasing its tail on Level 92. Chewing a cultist's robes. Chewing a slime-covered shoe left by some unfortunate adventurer. Clambering across the keys of an organ as curses fly in all directions. Cowered in fear as a skeleton shot arrows at it. Danced in a circle with Ghost Meepits. Dancing to some sweet jazz music with a friendly cultist. Dug up some bones and played with them for a bit. Exploring an empty corridor. Followed its nose to the scent of cinnamon rolls. Fought a cult dedicated to the destruction of Neopia... then made friends and went out for cupcakes. Found an old shoe! Grrr... Rawr! Found a peanut. Found a treasure room! Wandered away without taking anything. Got covered in slime... Ew. That's going to take a good scrubbing. Got eaten by a Gelatinous Non-Cube... and was spit back out. Got stepped on at a cultist dance party. Had a sneezing competition with a dragon. Had a staring contest with its doppleganger.
