        "text": "Developed by the Omaha-based Spotted Shark Studio, Grave Danger is a hat tip to the old days of platform gaming when characters were quirky, the pitfalls were challenging, the consequences of failure were infuriating, and the rewards for success were gratifying. In an industry where quick saves and unlimited retries has become the norm, diving headfirst into a challenging title like Grave Danger can be like a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe game centers around three characters (and this is where it gets a little weird):\n\nDante, in a possible nod to Devil May Cry, is essentially the central character of the story. He is steampunk cowboy train robber that packs a pistol, and can execute wall-jumps to reach high platforms and dash-jumps to cross large pitfalls.\n\nDante quickly befriends Elliott the wizard, who looks a bit like He-Man’s floating wizard-friend Orko, and can shoot balls of fire from his wizard’s staff at enemies and execute double-jumps to get to higher platforms that don’t have adjacent walls for Dante to climb.\n\nMaurice the final member of the trio. He, in a possible nod to Sir Daniel Fortesque of MediEvil, is a skeleton reaper who can throw his reaper’s scythe at enemies and can execute a hover-move for long enough to navigate through dangers that Dante’s dash jump won’t clear. I’m not entirely sure where the name Maurice came from, but it works.\n\nThere isn’t much to the storyline – the three characters team up to track down and defeat an evil skeleton King who, well…I don’t really know what he did, but let’s just say he’s the bad guy of the game. The gameplay is standard party-puzzle fare, in which gamers cycle through the three characters exploiting the advantages of each to navigate the increasingly difficult levels. Many of the puzzles involve leaving one player on a switch (that only they can reach), thereby opening a door for another character to progress. Rinse and repeat.\n\nWe’ve seen this party-based gameplay for decades, and Grave Danger doesn’t really offer up anything new or unique. What it does deliver is a level of challenge that hasn’t been seen for some time. It doesn’t just look like the arcade classic Ghosts ‘n Goblins (I will discuss that later), it plays like Ghosts and Goblins – and by that, I mean that Grave Danger is so tough at times, it can utterly destroy you.\n\nIs the difficulty fair? Well, that’s a bit of a mixed bag. Yes, it poses some really well-thought-out challenges that really require trial-and-error to overcome – and when you do, it feels oh so good. But then you get the ridiculous amount of backtracking that comes with failing in the trial and error.\n\nOk, you know how with most platformers, a death means that your character is teleported back to the last checkpoint? I would have been bad enough if Spotted Shark had simply stuck with their two checkpoints per massive level and required you replay the last 1/3 of a level, but they took it a step further and ditched the teleport, instead tasking the gamer to walk a ghost version of each dead character back to the last checkpoint, reviving them, then turning around and replaying the level with all the enemies respawned and challenges reset. I’m sure you can imagine the frustration this begets. But then again, this is the way gaming used to be way back when, an at least it isn’t eating a handful of quarters each time you play.\n\nAnother issue is that the three-character gameplay is a bit too cumbersome for one-player play, but not really suited for the 2 or 3-player co-op that the game offers. It is always difficult to fully capture three autonomously moving player-characters on a single screen; some games try to zoom out as players move off screen until it almost gets too small to control, other games, like Grave Danger, focus on one player and simply let the other co-op players walk off screen which is not good at all, especially with all the backtracking that needs to be done.\n\nI mentioned earlier that Grave Danger has a very similar appearance to the Ghost ‘n Goblins series, and it does. With similar gothic castles, skeleton-enemies, and quirky characters, Grave Danger’s sharp colorful visuals would put it right around the timeframe when Ghosts ‘n Goblins resurrected itself as Maximo on the PS2 (a fantastic franchise, by the way), which is a compliment in my book. Conversely, Grave Danger’s story is told via text boxes with no voiceovers and only the minimal offering of generic sound effects and monotonous backing music. The lackluster audio package led to more than one incidence of this gamer dozing-off during play.\n\nIt’s obvious that Spotted Shark appreciates the classic platformers of old, and they do a pretty good job expressing that appreciation with Grave Danger. There’s a bit too much backtracking for my taste, and the co-op play definitely needs some refinement (split screen maybe?). Otherwise, it looks great and plays solidly. Grave Danger is a good first-outing from Spotted Shark; here’s hoping their next release is even better."
