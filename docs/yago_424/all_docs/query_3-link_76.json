        "text": "Britney Spears faces “grave danger” as the pop star’s mental health and alleged substance abuse issues worsen, multiple sources told TMZ.\n\nThat report alleges the 42-year-old “Toxic” singer suffers radical mood swings and has been prone to violent rages since a restrictive conservatorship implemented to modify her behavior was lifted in late 2021.\n\nNumerous people associated with Spears reportedly came forward with hopes a California court would consider a new conservatorship to protect the 2004 Grammy Award winner from her current situation. This time, it’s hoped Spears’ father — with whom she’s had a strained relationship — won’t be involved in that process.\n\nIn addition to foregoing medication to treat her emotional issues, Spears is said to be drinking and using illegal drugs.\n\nShe and her boyfriend reportedly got into a fight that ended with Speaks half-naked in the hallway of a posh West Hollywood hotel, where the pair had been allegedly boozing a couple weeks ago. Spears suffered a serious ankle injury during that debacle, which she documented on social media. TMZ said the couple was also recently involved in a fight at a Las Vegas hotel that caused thousands of dollars in damage.\n\nSpears’ alleged paranoia led to a judge lifting her conservatorship after she claimed her father bugged her bedroom. According to TMZ, no such invasion of privacy happened. The singer called being released from her conservatorship the “best day ever!”\n\nSources describe Spears as often unable to engage in rational conversation.\n\nHer representatives haven’t responded to a request for comment."
