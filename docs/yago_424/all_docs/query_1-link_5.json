Actually she tells him the second one. Seriously instead of hanging up she adds a story to drag it up. She's not even having fun doing it. Every story has a woman get naked so randomly that he totally makes it unsexy and literally funny. Just over half way through even the woman on the phone is told to get naked, so of course she does.
