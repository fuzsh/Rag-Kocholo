        "text": "May 26, 2023\n\nI’m always happy when the next book in a series has a summary of what happened previously. I don’t always have the time to reread previous books so this really helps out my sieve of a brain.\n\nGrave Danger is a fantastic addition to this series. It is lighthearted, yet gets serious at the right moments. It’s sexy but also gory to add in some varying adrenaline rush causes.\n\nI love that we got to see a different side of several of the characters we got to know previously—sometimes for the better but sometimes for worse. I also liked that some of the relationship issues were dealt with in a way that felt realistic, both the consequences as well as the feelings attached to that.\n\nThe mystery had me going for a while. At one moment, I thought I had it figured out but then all of a sudden I got tricked again. This isn’t a super deeply convoluted mystery but it’s a fun one to figure out with characters I enjoy following. Tony is fun to follow as a narrator and I like seeing how she handles the various crazy situations she finds herself involved in.\n\nI read this book much more quickly than anticipated and really wanted to grab the third one right away as well. It was exactly what I needed at the time. I can’t wait to continue with the series and love that it’s a long one at that.\n\nMarch 22, 2023\n\nIn my review for Grave Secrets, the first Lavington Windsor Mystery, I asked for more (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).\n\nGlad to say we are getting just that with Grave Danger, released in May this year and a third volume towards the end of year.\n\nIn Grave Danger Toni is once again assisting her brother with a murder using her necromancy to elide clues to the killers identity. Whilst also trying to juggle her complicated love life with a vampire and his other lover; holding down her job at the estate agents and fending off her boss's unwanted attentions. Oh and she is mentoring the prime suspect in the murder inquiry on the side. So far pretty normal for Toni.\n\nI love this chaotic character and her ineffable ability to continually put her self in grave danger time and again. I love that courage, to see hard things and do them anyway attitude. Am I a little smitten by Ms. Windsor, yes.\n\nCan't wait for book 3.\n\nI received an ARC of this from author.\n\nMay 4, 2023\n\n3,5 stars\n\nThank you to Rebellion, Solaris and Netgalley for the review copy in exchange for an honest review . This does not change my opinion in anyway\n\nTrigger/Content Warnings: Sexual Content | Emotional Abuse | Physical Abuse | Sexual Violence\n\nSlightly spoilerly I suppose\n\nThe second book of this series starts a few months after the ending of Grave Secrets. And I must wonder about Tony's life choices. She seems to desperately want a relationship and for that reasons had stuck with an abusive vampire boyfriend. She sees it. She sees what he does. But she just wants that boyfriend so desperately that she can't say goodbye to him.\n\nThat is until he tries to force her to be marked and have her blood drank, something she thinks is disgusting. I liked that this was very early on dealt with in the book. Because it needed to be dealt with. Oscar is an abusive boyfriend and violence lover. He is not a good person, and while I could see that, Tony didn't want to see it. Another thing that she doesn't seem to want to see is how Oscar's other coterie member was at the very least a silent part of this. She loves him too, but girl, that man knew exactly what Oscar was like after 10 years. You can't tell me he had no idea how violent Oscar could be.\n\nI like Tony as a person. She is fun and has an unique voice to read. But she is a train wreck to watch. And I would hope that in future installments she will get some more character growth because this will get old very fast.\n\nHaving said that, this book was a lot better to read because the above mentioned was dealt with for the most part and that meant there was more room for other things. Like Tony getting to know Akil a little better, finding a new roommate and learning more about her history. We learn a little more about how she grew up and it explained to me better why she so desperately wanted to cling to Oscar. It made a bit more sense. I hope she sees that too.\n\nMay 26, 2023\n\nI really enjoyed Grave Secrets and was happy to find that its sequel, Grave Danger was more of the same light-hearted paranormal adventure romance. On the cover it says ‘More Murder, More Mayhem, More Romance’ – let’s add to that: more necromancy, more spiciness and more sassy humour and there’s bound to be something for everyone in this romp of a mystery!\n\nIn Grave Danger, Lavington “Toni” Windsor is back in an excellent and witty read centring on the mystery of a murdered schoolgirl who bears a striking resemblance to a young Miss Windsor herself. Toni’s brother, a policeman, has once again asked for her necromantic help in raising the victim to find out who killed her – but with no luck this time. There follows a thorough investigation as Toni tries to clear the name of the prime suspect, an eighteen-year-old boy with a colourful home life. Throw into the mix Toni’s propensity to end up in dangerous situations and attract people wanting to kill her and you have a fast-paced adventure which never slows down from start to finish.\n\nThe book begins pretty much where the first book in the series left off, with Toni having moved into her vampire boyfriend Oscar’s mansion and redecorated it tastefully for him. Unfortunately, his taste leans more towards her blood than design styles and she is repulsed by the idea, so their relationship is heading for rocky ground. Toni finally begins to understand how much she is dazzled by good looks, which makes her throw all her common sense out of the window and blinds her to the obvious, time and again. This personal growth and character development was something of a relief to see. It’s very easy to like Toni, but she can be frustrating as she hurtles pell-mell from one dangerous situation to another – luckily she knows some talented healers who are always willing to show up for her!\n\nToni’s life is complicated, to say the least! At night her life is filled with gorgeous, yet psychopathic vampires, murder investigations and picnics with a devoted zombie, but during the day she is trying to make ends meet as an estate agent in a small Staffordshire village where winter has caused viewings to grind to a halt, while keeping her powers secret. I was pleased to see Bredon Havers still playing a part in her life as confidant, father figure and trusted friend. Benedict, the head vampire, plays a larger part in this story and his fierce and terrifying nature seems to have become tempered towards Toni. As he gets to know her, he seems to be respecting her talents and usefulness more. There are quite a few surprises in this book, relating to members of Toni’s family, which help explain some of her skills and also maybe why Benedict is so intrigued by her. The ending leaves the reader with many questions unanswered, however, and a relationship cliffhanger – I will be eagerly anticipating the next book in the series to see what happens there!\n\nI was sent a review copy of this book for the tour – thank you very much Alice James and Solaris/Rebellion Publishing. My review is honest and my opinions are my own.\n\nMay 19, 2023\n\nA very impressive follow up to the first books arhat focuses more on the human side of the world and explores toxic relationships and how to recognise the warning signs. A very good case to solve too then more vampire issues to resolve on top - made this a hugely enjoyable read!\n\nFull review - https://www.runalongtheshelves.net/bl...\n\nMarch 12, 2023\n\nAt last! Volume Two of the Lavington Windsor Mysteries is available. Lavington Windsor (Toni to her friends) is an estate agent with a secret...she's a necromancer who is compelled each night to raise the dead. And her life is further complicated by one-and-a-half boyfriends and a policeman brother with a disturbing murder to solve.\n\nI found Grave Danger to be an absolute page-turner. It's a murder mystery - a modern fantasy - Toni's ongoing story - and a great piece of writing.\n\nTwelve-year-old Annabel was killed when she nipped into Toni's old school one evening to pick up some forgotten homework...and although there are several suspects, nobody can explain how any of them could have committed the murder, let alone why. Meanwhile, Toni's vampire boyfriend Oscar is getting impatient with her reluctance to engage with him in traditional vampiric cultural activities. The three-way relationship between Toni, Oscar, and his other companion, Peter the doctor, is dangerously unstable. Benedict, leader of the local vampire Assembly, is pushing Toni for magical favours - and what was his deal with her necromancer ancestor Ignatius anyway - while local property still needs to be sold, pizza eaten and stray teenager Paul needs either help with his A-levels or handing over to the police...but which? Oh, and really, it's NOT a good idea to mess with demons. Or nuns.\n\nGrave Danger features a perfectly-constructed murder mystery in which we're given all the clues, but subtly enough that I failed to put them together - and I've read a LOT of Agatha Christie novels. Toni's average day is a roller-coaster of hair-raising near-death experiences, corpse-raising necromancy, a complicated love life and messy attempts to negotiate the complexities of vampire society (in this alternative modern Britain, the vampires have come out of the coffin and while some are attempting to prove their worth to humanity by using their supernatural healing abilities for good, others are all too human in their failings).\n\nJames's writing is elegant, witty and snarky; the tone is light and humorous but every now and then there is an edgy moment when serious issues are faced. Toni is a complex person who is deeply attached to her family yet struggling to understand how they could have failed her so badly. She has a ruthless streak of practicality and a love of champagne cocktails that carry her through one crisis after another.\n\nAlthough this is a complete story, it's clear that there's a lot more for Toni to learn about her past and powers, and plenty more action to come in her love life. Roll on Volume Three, which I understand is coming soon!\n\nI recommend Volume One, Grave Secrets, if you haven't already read it: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5...\n\nJune 26, 2023\n\nSo! Here we are again and another story with the effervescent Lavington (Toni) Windsor and her forever falling through the world of vampires into some danger or other.\n\nThe story starts a couple of months after the first book and we soon get the hint that there's trouble in paradise. At the end of the last book, Toni was supposed to be going off into the sunset with her vampire lover, Oscar. However, as we start the book, we soon see that things are not going well.\n\nWell, that is not entirely true! To be more specific, things are not going well at all with Oscar. But then there's Peter and that is a whole different story. Yep, Toni's love life is as complicated as ever, and just to add that little extra little bit of bother, there's Benedict, the head of the vampire coterie to add in the mix.\n\nPhew, this woman! I don't know how she has time for anything else, but she most certainly does, coz if she isn't in trouble with her love life, she manages to get herself in trouble in a myriad of other ways.\n\nSimilarly to book one, the story starts with our little ray of sunshine heroine aiding her brother in a murder. This time though, it's the murder of tween Bella, who after nipping into the school after hours is brutally throttled by goodness knows who, but there are two main suspects, Spikey Mikey, the cleaner of the posh grammar school, and dodgy teenager Paul, who apparently has a rap sheet as long as yer arm and coincidentally sneaks into the school after hours to do his homework.\n\nI can't help but like these books as they are utterly charming. Toni is a great character, a complex mish mash of contradictions. On the one hand she is completely ditzy, yet full of depth. She's fun and shallow, but can turn on a sixpence to being fierce and loyal.\n\nThen there's the necromancer side of her, which I find really intriguing, especially when she starts conversing with demons and shit, and she will also off the odd vampire or two without a second thought.\n\nOne of the things that I like about these books, is that whilst there is a seeming lightness to the story, there are also some things going off under the rippling surface of good naturedness, and one of these things is Toni's relationship with Oscar. I don't want to spoil things, but things do take a turn in their relationship that has a significant impact and brings back some of the warnings that were presented in book one.\n\nI also love that the books are chock full of wonderful characters that elevate the story as a whole.\n\nIf you like your books with a complicated heroine, a bit of spiciness, blood and guts a lot of mystery, then nip out to your local bookshop and pick up these books.\n\nApril 21, 2023\n\nI hadn’t read the first book in this series before requesting this one, but I was really intrigued by the blurb. I started this, and I admit I wasn’t sure I was going to like this. However, it didn’t take long for that to turn around and become such a fun book. This is not exactly a mystery. Yes, it does have a mystery component, but it has so much more in it: love story, humor, staying true to yourself, defending yourself, falling love, falling out of love, family…and so much more. I really didn’t miss much by not having read the first one, and I am ready to read the next. Toni is a complex character, and I want to read more about her. Highly recommend. I was provided a complimentary copy which I voluntarily reviewed.\n\nApril 2, 2023\n\nWhen I requested this book I didn’t realize at the time that Grave Danger was a sequel. So I spent last night reading book one, Grave Secrets, and spent this morning reading Grave Mercy.\n\nAlice James, you have yourself a hooked fan!! I’m honestly upset that there are currently only these two books of Toni Windsor for me to read. I could spend days reading about the misadventures she gets herself into.\n\nI’m very happy to see that Oscar is out of the picture, as I got a bad vibes from him even in the first book. And I’m devastated about Peter. You’ll bring him back, won’t you?\n\nI see that there’s a third title on the way, and I can’t wait!\n\n9/10\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nApril 15, 2023\n\nGreat follow-up ftom book one smart wiity dialogue great mystery and fun characters .\n\nA fun series to read.\n\nMay 19, 2023\n\nGrave Danger (Toni Windsor book 2)\n\nAuthor: Alice James\n\nPublisher: Solaris an imprint of Rebellion Publishing Ltd\n\nRelease date: 25th May 2023\n\nVampires and Zombies and Snogging, Oh My!\n\nI’ve been waiting for the follow up to Grave Secrets with the proverbial bated breath. And it does not disappoint.\n\nFor starters, the interior has cute little character illustrations as headers and the formatting and editing is on point as usual with Rebellion.\n\nLavington “Toni” Windsor is a Staffordshire estate agent by day but at night she’s a necromancer who raises the dead. She also helps her brother – and police chief Wills - solve crimes by interviewing the deceased on occasion. As well as getting involved in vampire shenanigans.\n\nAt the beginning of book two, we get a short recap of the main events of the first book, to help readers get back into the story. So if you haven’t read the first one it’s not an issue.\n\nThe novel starts with a an eleven year old dead girl found in a local school. Wills asks for Toni's help in raising and questioning the victim, who looks eerily like a young Toni. Unfortunately it’s a bust.\n\nMeanwhile, Hildred Rutherford - itinerant healer and vampire/undead bigot - has also decided to visit the area without asking permission of Benedict Akil, the ‘king’ vampire in the area. So of course, Benedict sends Toni to speak to her and find out why.\n\nThe order is delivered to her by not-quite-boyfriend Peter, who is her vampire-boyfriend Oscar’s, boyfriend. Still with me? Yeah, to say Toni’s love life is complicated is like calling the Arctic a bit chilly. Add dating a vampire when you have a blood phobia, and yes, even more complicated.\n\nEspecially when Oscar, said vampire is getting impatient, and pushy, wanting Toni to feed him.\n\nAt the latter end of book one my “ spidey senses” were tingling and I was starting to find Oscar a tad arrogant and selfish. By book two, as Toni says often enough, she has “bad taste in boyfriends.” It isn’t long before Oscar shows his true colours.\n\nToni herself seems to be a little like vampire-catnip, with Peter, Oscar and Benedict all wanting a piece of her.\n\nBenedict is decidedly yummy, and wants his mitts and his molars on Toni and part of her is tempted. I would be, too.\n\nAs well as the romance aspects of the book, we have the cosy crime elements, and Toni’s own growing power.\n\nThere are secrets, dangerous ones at that, and some interesting side characters such as teenager Paul, a young girl called Kathy, Mr Suki who is always trying to marry Toni off, glamourous camp Grace and Hildred herself who add to the humour and various plot strands.\n\nThe underlying theme of lies, truths and choosing what to tell affects most of the characters in this novel, Toni predominantly, so it’s apt she learns a few hard truths about her own life throughout the novel.\n\nWhat makes this book work so well, is Toni’s snark. When she’s in the Vampire Assemblage and runs into a huge auburn-haired hungry chap who decides to take her out for dinner – with her being the main course – her retorts are legendary and she almost manages to kill him what alone. It’s like every thought a woman could have at seeing another conceited man, just jumps out of her mouth. And it’s fabulous.\n\nAs for Bredon, the recurrent zombie Toni is ‘friends’ with, he’s great fun. And a great conversationalist. In fact in this reality, zombies prefer pork pies or rotisserie chicken when they get the munchies, so raising zombies isn’t too bad.\n\nIn exchange for this honest review, I would like Toni to raise me so I can join her and Bredon for a picnic, please.\n\nMarch 29, 2023\n\nThis book is even funnier and quirkier than the first one. It is also even more sarcastic and witty than the first one. Oh, and it has even more sexy vampires. What’s not to like? James’s writing is brilliant! A perfect blend of witty, crazy and humorous tones mixed with seriousness and complexity. All this makes each of the characters, especially Toni, not only fun but also portrays how complex each of them are. Basically, I am trying to say that life is complex and James writes her characters with a perfect balance of seriousness, crazy and funny.\n\nIn the book, we follow Toni, who is asked to assist her brother in yet another murder case. There are several suspects, but no one knows who did it, not even zombie Bella after Toni raises her from the dead. On top of that, Toni has to deal with her boyfriend Oscar, who, let’s say, is getting on her nerves and pressuring her to do things she doesn’t want. She also is pushed around by Benedict, who she has to run errands for. Oh, and Toni also has to deal with the forever-growing line of people that wants to kill her…The girl can’t seem to catch a break…\n\nThis book felt both, a murder mystery and Toni trying to find her way, as well as make sense of her newfound life with vampires at such proximity. She is not only asked to find out who Bella’s murderer is but also needs to sort out her own (messy) love life and keep herself safe from vampires and other creatures that are trying to kill her, whilst also juggling whatever the Assemblage tells her to take care of.\n\nI loved how Toni grew as a character throughout the first two books, especially in this book. I just love her attitude and her outlook on life. I feel I could learn a thing or two from her, yet at the same time, she feels like a familiar character to whom I can relate.\n\nI love how the story is progressing too. There are still so many questions unanswered, but this book built such a great foundation for all of those to be answered in the next instalments.\n\nI am just going to go and cry about how frustrating Peter’s situation is… and laugh about Oscar…if you know, you know…#TeamPeter\n\nOverall: Brilliantly written story, with so many great characters that I fell in love in the first instalment and don’t want to let go. Like I need the third book now! The suspense! Why did the book have to finish on such a cliffhanger!!! Honestly, can’t wait to see what crazy situations Toni will get herself into in book three.\n\nMay 28, 2023\n\nI was SO glad to see Alice Jame's \"rural fantasy\" (modern supernatural, but not urban) continue into another volume. We pick up Lavington (Toni) Windsor's story six months on from the end of the previous book. It's a bleak January, and whole everyone's favourite Staffordshire estate agent/ necromancer (it's in the family!) is settled into a regular routine, flogging property by day and raising the dead/ being with her vampire boyfriend Oscar by night. Toni is though struggling with her relationships - her menage with Oscar and his human partner Peter is problematic: Oscar wants to take her blood and allow her to 'ascend', Toni can't bear the thought.\n\nSo a spot of corpse raising to assist her policeman brother William investigate the death of a local schoolgirl sounds like a suitable distraction, but Toni has to be careful. While vampirism is now public and accepted, necromancy isn't - so Toni may draw attention to her talents in a way that may risk opening her activities up to unwelcome attention.\n\nAs well as walking that tightrope, Toni is wary of attracting unwanted attention, lord of the local vampire Assemblage to which Oscar belongs. Benedict warned her off Oscar, and she distrusts him, but she also swore loyalty and is uncomfortably aware that she may as a result be required to intervene in local vampire/ human matters as a result.\n\nI am really enjoying this series.\n\nToni is, her nocturnal hobby aside, a refreshingly normal protagonist: she's not out to save the world or defeat dark powers, she enjoys a gossip with her girlfriends, enjoys splashing out on a new outfit when she gets a windfall and has to negotiate office politics (her boss is a bit handsy but otherwise nice). Toni also has a complex family legacy and is short of money (Oscar would help out but would it be wise to let him?) The crime side of the book is well developed mystery which Toni doesn't just jump into and try and solve, she's providing (covert) support for her brother and most of the investigation uses conventional methods with Toni's contribution having to be sneaked in by William. There's also a nicely developing relationship with the dashing Bredon Havers, Toni's favourite corpse to raise, who's seeming becoming younger and easier to call and I wonder where that is going to lead?\n\nGrave Danger is therefore a fine read, a genuinely original, funny and in places sexy read (Toni's relationships are nothing if not full).\n\nIt is also, at times VERY dark read. Alongside the supernatural peril and crime, James explores issues of consent, abuse and control in relationships. She admits to a history of poor boyfriend choices, and as this second part of the series opens, is recognising that all is not what it should be with her current ones. It's another issue to be negotiated in a life that is becoming more and more complex and where moral boundaries are far from clear (negotiate with demons? REALLY?)\n\nSo there are aspects here which some readers may wish to be aware of before beginning the story, but I would say they are handled with sensitivity and importantly aren't gratuitously or justified because vampires: many of the vampires here would deplore such things.\n\nOverall then, a book that left me wanting more.\n\nJune 3, 2023\n\nThe blend of humor—sometimes gallow in nature—and suspense made this novel a compulsive, thoroughly enjoyable read. I’m enjoying getting to know the cast of recurring characters too. I highly recommend these books as delightful escapism at its finest!\n\nJune 19, 2023\n\nToo much in the best of ways.\n\nThank you to Rebellion, Solaris, and NetGalley for providing an eARC for a honest review.\n\nSeptember 1, 2023\n\nI found this book …..blah. I saw it on the New Books shelf at the library and decided to give it a try since I didn’t have any Holds to pick up.\n\nMaybe I should have read the first book in the series prior to reading this one.\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\nGrave Danger had a little bit of everything - mystery, mayhem, romance, and just a touch of spice.\n\nToni is navigating her difficult relationship with vampire lover Oscar, his boyfriend Peter, his boss Benedict, and a demon who claims he just wants to apologize to God to get back into heaven.\n\nThere was a LOT going on in this book. Fans of open relationships will love it. Basically, everyone is sleeping with everyone else, regardless of relationship status. I'm not a fan of this trend in books, so it lowered my enjoyment of the story. If you're a fan of the Why Choose romances, you'll love how open the characters are.\n\nI wish there'd been more Benedict in the story. To be honest, most of the characters fell flat for me. Toni was funny enough and she reminded me of Anita Blake midway through that series, but I struggled to relate to her or anyone else. Benedict was the bright shining light. I loved every interaction with him and looked forward to his appearance.\n\nGrave Danger wasn't my cup of tea, but fans of paranormal mysteries with an open sense of romance will love it.\n\nI voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own.\n\nJune 25, 2023\n\nlove and necromancy\n\nLiked how the characters developed from the first book. Good read many twists and turns. Vampire and zombie filled book.\n\nMay 23, 2023\n\nReview originally published on Jamreads.com\n\nGrave Danger is the second book in the Lavington Windsor Mysteries series, written by Alice James. In this sequel, our confused necromancer will help his brother to resolve a new case, while at the same time trying to deal with the difficulties of having a romantic relationship with vampires; all with the usual doses of sarcastic humour and spiciness we had in the previous book.\n\nSome months passed since the end of Grave Secrets, and Toni is just trying to keep a normal relationship with her boyfriend, Oscar. However, dating a vampire is not proving to be the best of ideas, as her prince turns out to be an asshole; on top of this, Toni's brother asks her for help to solve the murder of a mini version of her, requiring of her ability to raise corpses.\n\nWhile trying to give the best help she can to those affected by this crime, including a poor boy that is pointed as the suspect, she ends up having to deal another time with vampiric businesses.\n\nAnd all of this with the humour and sassiness that characterizes Toni as a character. In this case, the story takes a spin to focus more on the relationships between the characters, and it is actually a good depiction of how sometimes people become blind in abusive relationships, one of the central themes in this novel.\n\nThat doesn't mean that we will skip action scenes and more times when Toni can show her multiple abilities to deal with the problems (if you can call verbal damage an ability), but honestly, she's plenty resourceful when fighting against enemies that are pretty much stronger than her.\n\nDon't forget about some spice and romance, which complements the story in a perfect way. James includes it naturally, and it works as a counterpoint to the gory/violent parts. And honestly, relationships are difficult, just ask Toni about them.\n\nGrave Danger is a great romantasy mystery novel, a really enjoyable read with some coffee. If you haven't read it yet, I totally recommend you to start The Lavington Windsor Mysteries. Today.\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\nOK. While the first book didn’t really hold my interest, this second book definitely did. I think there were just a lot more characters that I liked. There’s more to her than her relationship with Oscar and Peter. I find this much easier to read as well, so I don’t know if I just got used to Alice James’ writing style.\n\nEither way, highly recommend this book. If you like a murder mystery plot, heroine always escaping death, friendly and powerful zombies, and bloodthirsty vampires (but there are friendly, allied ones too).\n\nThoughts when I was reading…\n\n-New murder mystery that needs to be solved.\n\n-Toni having relationship problems with Oscar- she’s refusing him to feed from her. Now he wants to change her into a vampire.\n\n-Oscar… wow. I’m sorry but he needs to go. My dislike for him is SO JUSTIFIED.\n\n-Not gonna lie, I’m really liking Benedict. My interest in his and Toni’s dynamic is increasing.\n\n-Peter needs to come back.\n\n-More Bredon please.\n\n-And a new revelation at the end??? Toni is also a witch???\n\n-I probably need to do a re-read of the first book again.\n\nTold single first person POV.\n\nPlease check TW prior to reading.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Solaris for this ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\nMay 25, 2023\n\nGrave Danger wasn't quite the 4 star read for me that Grave Secrets was, but it was pretty close.\n\nGrave Danger feels very nostalgic of cozy murder mysteries that I've read over the years. The main murder mystery in this book had a really satisfying wrap up where I got to put together the puzzle pieces and workout the clues, which I was missing from Grave Secrets. The other mysteries in this series have continued to pile up and I am now anxiously awaiting the third book to get some answers.\n\nWhile the mysteries in the second book were more satisfying, I feel like some of the sparkle and humor was lost in the second book. The book is far more serious, and definitely doesn't call for as much humor, but it could have used the comic relief a little more too. There was less sparkle mostly in the sense that there was far less Bredon, and he really is a fantastic character that deserved more page time. And while I appreciate and like Toni's ability to forgive and fall in love, I wish that she hadn't been quite so forgiving in this book. Then again, if she was a harder person she wouldn't be the same character that I really do like.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Grave Danger almost as much as the first book and I am already looking forward to the next installment.\n\nMay 21, 2023\n\nAfter having just finished and very much enjoyed the first book in the series, I immediately jumped on the chance of getting an ARC for book two.\n\nAnd we continue as chaotically as we have ended... in a good way. Toni has a very unique voice and it is great fun looking at the world through her eyes and mind - and rolling our eyes at the mistakes that she makes, that are of course glaringly obvious to us.\n\nGrave Danger deals with abusive and toxic relationships, while not falling short on corpses and otherworldy creatures (mostly dead, which doesn't stop them) and another murder mystery for Toni to solve for her brother using her strange abilities.\n\nAnother great fun romp that marries paranormal romance with chick lit and cozy mysteries in much the same way the Dresden Files did for urban fantasy and crime noir. An exciting new series that will surely only keep getting better, and I'll certainly pick up book 3!\n\nI want to thank Rebellion Publishing and NetGalley for a free copy in exchange for an honest review; all opinions here expressed are my own.\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\nAfter Grave Secrets was released I spent a lot of time looking and waiting for he next book in this series and then sort of forgot about it whilst waiting, so it was with delight that I saw not 1 but 2 books in this wonderful series had been published. This book was absolutely worth the wait. Toni is a delightfully off beat character who dances to her own tune. This series is utterly unique in it's genre, set in small town rural England, vampires are 'out' but other supernaturals, like Toni's rare necromancer, not so much. This book sees Toni find out about her strengths and weaknesses, falling in and out of love in her quest for happiness and and realises she needs more to know more about herself. I loved the mystery (and how simply it was solved in the end) and her friendships with Braden and Paul were a delight. In fact the friendships are what make this books so readable, that and it's ability to make me laugh out loud. A great and wonderful treat is a book that does that.\n\nMay 26, 2023\n\nIf I am being honest, I did not think I would finish this book. It took probably until chapter 4 or 5 for me to start to become interested in what was happening. I was unaware that this was the second in a series, which might have made it easier for me to understand what was happening and/or who the characters way sooner in the book. I wasn't overly impressed with the main character, but I am in love with Benedict. The writing felt scattered - it seemed all over the place, and I almost got whiplash from how often Toni found herself in danger.\n\nI think the premise of the book is super interesting, and I enjoyed the book - I just didn't love it. I'm debating reading the first one, and seeing if that changes my review at all.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Rebellion Publishing for giving me the opportunity to read this ARC in exchange for my honest review.\n\nJune 6, 2023\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Rebellion Publishing for an ARC of this book!!\n\nI've got to be honest. I wanted so much more from this book. I was so excited to start this after reading the blurb, but the story didn't give me much to like.\n\nThe characters all felt very flat to me. The only one that I really enjoyed was Benedict, and the MC spends the majority of the story hating him. Meanwhile, the people she should have issues with (hello, Oscar), she still pines for and protects. Toni felt immature to me. You could've told me she was a teenager and I would absolutely believe you.\n\nThere was so much going on during this story, it was almost difficult to keep up with it. Everything felt scattered and all over the place, but I think the general idea was there. I can see why some people could adore this book. I wish I had.\n\nApril 19, 2023\n\nA thrilling and compelling five-star read. I simply adore the Lavington Windsor mysteries they just come to life on the page, much like Bredon does in the story. I really liked that Tori got a chance to really open her eyes this time and pull everyone together. You know there is so much more coming, and I simply loved the setting, it was so nice to hear about Staffordshire, as its not a place you get to hear about often and I love visualising the places, as its where my brother now lives so its nice to hear this and it’s not London, that’s rare when you are reading a story set in the UK. Alice James is fast becoming a go to author and one I really enjoy reading, I always get an excited squeak when I see anything new by them.\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\nSecond book in the series with the snark and humour I enjoyed from the first book - and I did appreciate some of the relationship changes made here, as let’s say I wasn’t wild about how controlling Oscar seemed to be. The subplot with Paul was nice to see, that someone could want to change their life and work to make it happen - I hope he sticks around (and a certain European return…). All in all, a very good follow up novel.\n\nI received a free ARC copy of this via NetGalley and the publishers in return for an unbiased review.\n\nMay 17, 2023\n\n3.5 stars. Much more interesting than Grave Secrets. Spoilers ahead. The whole Peter business is still confusing. As is the attraction to vampires that “play the field”. Peter is in love with someone else. And it’s a man. And a vampire. None of that sits well with me so I’m hopeful that story line is dead (pun intended). I like Benedict and I would love for Toni to give him a chance. And I would love it even more if they were a monogamous couple. Paul is a sweetheart as is Wills and Henry. Wish book 3 was available. Thank you to NetGalley for an ARC"
