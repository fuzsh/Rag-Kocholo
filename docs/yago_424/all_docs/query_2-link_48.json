We’ve had a great time seeing the positive reactions to the quirkiness and challenge of the game. It’s also been great seeing everyone play the game in order to learn how to make it even better!\n\nOne thing I can always tell somebody for certain about Grave Danger: it’s hard. Grave Danger must be mastered, and replayed to truly become the best. Speed running is totally a thing, as the game challenges you to get the fastest, most death-free run possible for each level! I thought it would be a good idea to continue to build on these ideas. So today, I reveal...\n\nGrave Danger 1.0.2!\n\nNEW FEATURE: Wanted: Dead AND Alive Posters. Collect all of the posters in each level for completion bonus!\n\nNEW ACHIEVEMENT “100% Innocent” : Collect all of the Wanted: Dead AND Alive posters.\n\nWe’ve strewn wanted posters throughout the world of Grave Danger. Now, you mustn’t just speed run a level to get the S+ ranking, now you can challenge yourself to make sure that Dante, Elliot, and Malice are 100% innocent!\n\nHere are a few other changes that have been made as well:\n\nRenamed Boss “Grimm”’s name to Boss “Francis”, clearing up the story and distinction between Malice the grim reaper and the antagonist.\n\nMalice's text box portrait now features his scythe!\n\nAdd better user feedback to ropes and chains that trigger events in levels.\n\nFix locations in multiple levels where characters or ghosts can get stuck.\n\nMany UI and font size changes.\n\nThanks for being part of this awesome game!\n\nHey everyone! I'm here to tell you about the small update that just went out for Grave Danger - version 1.0.1!\n\nAfter watching some gameplay videos and getting some feedback, here's the changes that have been made for this version:\n\nAdded a checkpoint graveyard behind Malice that appears after you rescue him.\n\nDante can now dash-jump off of ropes, ladders, and other climbable terrain.\n\nNew achievements “Participation Badge” and “Wall Meat”.\n\nReduce the difficulty of a jump in level 6, Deathpeak Peril\n\nEnemies now spawn much less frequently, taking 30 seconds longer to respawn than before.\n\nA robot now spawns facing a different way in level 7, making puzzle easier.\n\nFix multiple visual and collision issues.\n\nFix a bug where some sound effects could play more than once at the same time.\n\nFix a bug where a character will display the wrong key graphic before using it.\n\nFix a bug where you can drop dynamite at start of level on level 4.\n\nAs you can see, I'm keeping a close eye on all the things Grave Danger!\n\nHere are some other things that happened outside of development:\n\nGamespot listed our trailer.
