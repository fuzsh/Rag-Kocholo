        "text": "Ahead of Wednesday’s Preview Night at San Diego Comic-Con, Amazon’s digital comics platform ComiXology has unveiled a new original series in which paranormal threats to the planet face a new, almost-fearless line of defense…not to mention Grave Danger.\n\nGrave Danger is the name of a five-issue series available now on the ComiXology platform, created by the team behind Image Comics’ Revival, Tim Seeley and Mike Norton. As it turns out, the title is also the name of the lead character of the new series: an agent of the underground espionage organization known as Headstone, created to deal with supernatural threats. Danger is afraid of nothing…except ruining her new sneakers. And heights. And her own hidden past — but she’d rather no one brought that up.\n\n“This book is kind of different than our last book, Revival,” Norton told The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s our version of James Bond in a strange VHS-inspired genre movie. We’re getting weird with this one.”\n\nSeeley added that the new title is “a series that combines every kind of comic book I like to read and filtered it through the greatest hits of the kind of comics I love to make: The high-concept horror Hack/Slash mixed with the high-adventure hi-jinks of Grayson, starring a unique and charming character expertly illustrated by my Revival collaborator Mike Norton.”\n\nThe series is the first project from the new company Comix AF, founded by Hitman and Hitman: Agent 47 producer Daniel Alter and Jeff Forsyth. “We’re incredibly excited about the release of Grave Danger as our debut series,” Alter and Forsyth said in a joint statement. “We hope this is just the beginning for this property that we see transcending into other mediums as well.”\n\nGrave Danger is just one of a number of new titles announced Wednesday by ComiXology as part of its ComiXology Originals imprint and its second wave of creator-owned properties. (The first wave was announced at the start of June.) In addition to Grave Danger, titles available immediately include Goliath Girls, a five-issue miniseries by Sam Humphries and Alti Firmansvah about three best friends raising the next generation of Kaiju; the 120-page collected edition Hit Reblog: Comics that Caught Fire by Megan Kearny with edits from Hope Nicholson, which looks into the origins of a number of hit webcomics; and Magdalene Visaggio and Jen Vaughn’s Teenage Wasteland, a five-issue series about a group of teenagers who happen to be the first line of defense for planet Earth.\n\nThe upcoming titles include The Dark, an original graphic novel by Mark Sable and Kristian Donaldson about a post-technology world and the biological internet that emerges in it; Delver, by C. Spike Trotman, MK Reed and Tish Doolin, a five-issue fantasy series about a girl exploring a door to “a living dungeon”; and The Stone King, by Kel McDonald and Tyler Crook, a four-issue miniseries about a teen girl thief who accidentally provokes a giant into action."
