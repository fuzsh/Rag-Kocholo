It\n\nis currently the most popular show on American television,\n\nregularly attracting up to 30 million viewers. The Jerry Bruckheimer-\n\nproduced show is well-known especially for its unique visual style\n\nfeaturing strong colours and vivid effects sequences taking viewers\n\nup close to the evidence.\n\nThe original news item can be found here:\n\nCSI Files - Quentin Tarantino To Direct 'CSI' Episode?\n\nEads reportedly told the reporters this at the SAG awards…\n\nDavid Caruso is hilarious in that. He never puts any emotion in his voice and is like so serious, but at the end of every episode he comforts some grieving child or mentally disabled individual. Can you think of anyone scarier to comfort you?\n\nI really don’t like CSI, and so am upset that Tarantino is directing one. Perhaps he’s drawn to the blood and guts, I don’t know, because it certainly can’t be to the characters and drama. Each episode is so boring; someone’s died horribly, they gather the evidence, process it, and find out who did it, and the person confesses with no human interaction or mystery, at least in the ones I’ve seen.\n\nFrom Worldscreen:\n\n<LINK_TEXT text=“http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent. … csi411.htm”>http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=csi411.htm</LINK_TEXT>\n\nLOS ANGELES, April 11: Quentin Tarantino has begun filming the season five finale of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which is set to air on CBS and CTV on May 19.\n\nFilming began earlier this week at Santa Clarita Studios in California. The episode will also be shot on location in Las Vegas. Tarantino, whose credits include Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, came up with the idea for the episode, in which the life of one of the CSI team members is put in danger. The episode was penned by Anthony Zuiker, the creator/executive producer of CSI, Carol Mendelsohn, executive producer/showrunner, and Naren Shankar, executive producer.\n\nTarantino’s involvement came about after he met Zuiker at an awards show and expressed his love of the show. The CSI producers and cast then persuaded him to come on board for the finale.\n\n“When he came in to talk to us, he told us this story about how he felt he had discovered the show when it first came on the air and he was an instant fan,” said Mendelsohn. “I mean, there’s Quentin Tarantino in our writers’ room. And he loves television Ãƒâ€°. He’s watched every TV movie, every TV show and he pitched out the first idea and we said, ‘You don’t have to go any further. It’s a great idea.’”\n\nThe episode will have more bugs and blood than usual, and Shankar notes, “It is much more of a thriller than we normally do.”\n\nThis is not Tarantino’s first foray into TV. In 1995 he directed an episode of ER and in 2002 and 2004 he appeared as a guest on Alias.\n\nDunno if there are any CSI fans out there but I found this:\n\nTarantino CSI Begins Filming\n\nLOS ANGELES, April 11: Quentin Tarantino has begun filming the season five finale of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which is set to air on CBS and CTV on May 19.\n\nFilming began earlier this week at Santa Clarita Studios in California.

In 1995 he directed an episode of ER and in 2002 and 2004 he appeared as a guest on Alias.\n\nThe CSI franchise is co-owned and co-produced by Alliance Atlantis Communications Inc. and CBS Productions, in association with Jerry Bruckheimer Television.

By the time he wakes up again, he’s\n\ntrapped in a coffin, together with his loaded handgun and a tape recorder\n\nwith a message telling him it’s probably best to kill himself, as he’s\n\ngoing to die anyway. There’s also a webcam in the coffin, which transmits\n\nan image back to the CSI lab, allowing his colleagues to see him slowly\n\nsuffocate - but not providing any clues as to his whereabouts.\n\nIn a race against the clock, all CSI teams combine under the leadership\n\nof Gil Grissom to find Nick. When they try to hack into the webcam, it’s\n\nreplaced by a countdown timer telling them to bring ransom to a warehouse\n\nsomewhere in Vegas. Grissom goes in alone, and encounters Nick’s kidnapper.\n\nBut he soon realises the man has no intention of letting Nick go, and has\n\ninstead hatched an explosive plan to kill both Grissom and himself…\n\n‘Grave Danger’ was written by CSI showrunner Carol Mendelsohn, CSI creator\n\nAnthony Zuiker, and executive producer Naren Shankar, based on a story\n\nby Quentin Tarantino. The episode is scheduled to air on Wednesday the\n\n19th of May. More plot information can be found at the following URL:\n\nCSI Files - 'CSI' Season Finale Revealed"
