It focuses on a girl named Violet Veil trying to solve the murder of a boy who was presumed dead. It was released on January 21st 2021, by the publishing company HarperCollins.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nViolet Veil wants nothing more than to prove her worth and become her father's apprentice at Veil & Sons Undertakers. And one rain-soaked night she gets her chance when she meets a boy, Oliver, who is wandering around the graveyard. Only, the last time Violet saw Oliver, he was indoors and very much dead, waiting to be buried. Violet has just found her first case, and it doesn't get bigger than this: can she, with the help of her dog, Bones, help Oliver solve his own 'murder'?\n\nDedication[]\n\nFor Lyanna - I love you more than all the stars in the sky\n\nPlot[]\n\nViolet had just returned from picking apples in her family's orchard for apple pie for dinner that night when her father stormed in, asking if Violet knew where the files for the newest body had gone. Violet suggests that her brother may have taken them, so her father goes and interrogates him. During dinner time, Violet spots a shadow through the window, but it quickly disappears.\n\nLater that night, Violet can't sleep due to the shadow in the window. When she goes downstairs, she is shocked to discover that the body in the coffin is missing. Noticing footprints, she heads outside and discovers the body standing in the middle of the graveyard.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nViolet Veil\n\nBones\n\nEdgar Veil\n\nIris Veil\n\nThomas Veil\n\nOliver Oats\n\nTrivia[]\n\nA Case of Grave Danger was originally named The Undertaker's Daughter.[1][2]"
