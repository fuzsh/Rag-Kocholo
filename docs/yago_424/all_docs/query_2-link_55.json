Graveyards, zombies and werewolves don’t scare Ali MacGregor. Why should they? She’s a special effects whiz who creates them. Her ex-boyfriend Greg Austin is a detective with the LAPD, tracking down the serial killer known as the Slasher. But when the Slasher breaks into the studio where Ali works, she has to stop dealing with fake monsters and escape a real one. Enter Greg, who tracks the Slasher as far as the studio, but finds himself out of his element in the world of make-believe. Ali and Greg should never have broken up. They should be living life together, intertwined as a loving couple. But if they can’t put aside their differences and combine their talents, they may never get the chance to reconcile."
