        "text": "Although released in 2009, the film strangely has the look of a late '70s campy horror anthology. Maybe it's the low budget, maybe it's the treatment.. Whatever be the reason, viewers watching this sort of film are expected to know what they will be watching, so complaining is out of question.\n\nVic Martino rocked as Jeff - the over-bearing husband, and so did Bud Stafford, as the ventriloquist. Almost all the female leads in the film landed up naked at some point of time or the other. And because they were not too well-toned, or particularly picturesque, the prolonged nudity became an eyesore after a while. Debbie was masculine and expressionless, Kate was just a pretty face, with no figure to speak of, Ann Yoo was tall but quite obnoxious, and Kaitlin Owens, as Jenny, couldn't act for nuts. In fact, I was waiting for Cathy St. George (the therapist) to strip sooner or later, but all she showed was her ample, pumped up cleavage and wonky lips.\n\nThere is a lot of ambiguity in the film, as pointed out by other reviewers, right from the beginning till the end. In fact, the way the ventriloquist drives off in a chauffeur-driven limousine at the end, puts a question mark as to whether he was actually a pauper, or was it a huge charade? In fact, the whole movie seems to be a charade, as the people in it are not quite what they seem to be."
