        "text": "By Andy Mills, 29 Jan 2018\n\nFollowtopics\n\nAction-AdventureAndy Mills\n\nDeveloper Spotted Shark Studio released the original Grave Danger on PC right at the tail end of 2016. While the game launched to few reviews on Steam, probably because of the mid-December release date, those that did play the puzzle platformer all seemed to have a good time with it. Recently, the team launched Grave Danger: The Ultimate Edition on PC, adding new levels to the game. Now they've announced that said edition will be coming to consoles later this year.\n\nFor those of you that remember it, Grave Danger's closest analogue seems to be The Lost Vikings, made by Blizzard way back in 1992 long before their days of Starcraft, Diablo or Overwatch. Playable in single-player or co-op, players will switch between Elliot the wizard, Dante the cowboy and Malice the reaper, using their unique abilities to guide them to victory. You can see a little of what that looks like in the trailer for the game below.\n\nGrave Danger: The Ultimate Edition is currently scheduled to come to consoles in Q3 2018.\n\nWritten by Andy Mills\n\nJust one of the fine Newshounds on TrueAchievements.
