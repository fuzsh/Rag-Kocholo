        "text": "Hey LinkedIn!\n\nIt's been a very interesting time for me with my latest endeavor, running a small startup game studio out of Omaha, NE. I've produced two games for mobile marketplaces, employed great artists, and partnered with Make-A-Wish Nebraska on an app. Now, our latest effort is to produce games for the PC and console marketplaces.\n\nI'd like to present to you: Grave Danger\n\nGrave Danger is a 2D sidescrolling adventure game about utilizing unique characters to solve puzzles and stay alive. Run, jump, float, shoot, and scythe your way through puzzles involving teamwork and precision! Alternate between each hero: Dante the cowboy, Elliot the wizard, and Malice the reaper. Use their unique abilities to resolve different situations and make their way out of trouble.\n\nI'm often asked when and where Grave Danger is coming out and what to look out for. Well, here is our currently perceived timeline:\n\nGrave Danger Steam Greenlight - July 18th, 2106\n\nOn July 18th the Grave Danger Steam Greenlight page will go live. Here we hope to garner the Steam community's interest and eyeballs. The materials for the Greenlight page are currently being developed. We'll be listening to the feedback the Steam community gives us on the Greenlight page, and tapping into it as much as possible.\n\nGrave Danger Kickstarter - July 18th, 2016\n\nAt the same time, we'll be launching the Grave Danger 30-day Kickstarter. We're preparing our Kickstarter page and materials right now! This will be the first place for anyone interested to invest in Grave Danger and contribute to it's creation. Confirmed items for this Kickstarter include:\n\nEarly Bird Digital Copy of Grave Danger (PC, Mac, Linux)\n\nDigital Copy of Grave Danger (PC, Mac, Linux)\n\nDigital Copy of Grave Danger Soundtrack (MP3)\n\nDigital Copy of Grave Danger on Console of your choice (PS4, WiiU, Xbox One)\n\nLimited edition Grave Danger T-Shirt\n\nLimited Edition Grave Danger T-Shirt Fulfillment - September 16th, 2016\n\nThis is likely to be our first Kickstarter product fulfillment. After the Kickstarter finishes, we'll send out a survey to those backers who selected to get a limited edition T-Shirt, confirming shipping addresses. In August, we'll print the Grave Danger T-Shirts, confirm their quality, and start sending out the packages of indie game swag.\n\nHalloween Grave Danger PC / Mac / Linux Release - October 31st, 2016\n\nGrave Danger will launch on Steam and at least one other desktop gaming marketplaces. This will be our main Kickstarter backer fulfillment. As we launch the game for desktop gaming markets, we'll send out keys to our backers who selected tiers with digital copies.\n\nItch.io is largely where I imagine Grave Danger would end up. Do you agree with this? What other marketplace would you like to purchase Grave Danger on? GoG.com?\n\nGrave Danger Console Release - January 16th, 2017\n\nThis early 2017 date is our estimated release date for Grave Danger for digital download on console marketplaces for Xbox One, Wii U, and PS4.\n\nSo what is your feedback? Have any advice for us as we launch our first Steam Greenlight and Kickstarter? What kind of products would you like to see on the Kickstarter? What desktop gaming platform besides Steam should we release Grave Danger on?\n\nUntil next time!\n\n- Jeff (JB Gaming)\n\nSign up for our mailing list\n\nVisit the Grave Danger IndieDB Page\n\nFollow Grave Danger on Twitter\n\nFollow JB Gaming on Twitter\n\nLike Grave Danger on Facebook"
