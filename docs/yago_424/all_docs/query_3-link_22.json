        "text": "May 5, 2013\n\nI admit I like free shit. I also admit I‚Äôm not entirely rational in my thought process. For example, I happily hand over my Bouchercon and Left Coast Crime Conference fees and feel like I‚Äôve won the lottery when I receive a bag filled with books. Seriously, this ends up being one of the major highlights of these conferences. So in my continued pursuit of this high, minus the conference fees, I have decided to scour Amazon for the best free short stories and books available. With that being said, let‚Äôs get to the review.\n\nThis is one action-packed short story. Corpses and zombies and stuffed werewolves riddled with bullets plaster every page. Spider web props dangle from the rafters and drop at the most inopportune moments, creating one tangled mess. And without giving too much away, I‚Äôll probably never look at prop men the same way again.\n\nLet me just say Heather Graham knows romance. Greg and Ali have a complicated, passion filled relationship, and both end up being strong-willed, as well as strong-headed, in the end. It reminded me of an Old West duel where neither wanted to blink first.\n\nI did find the overzealous use of exclamation points a bit exhausting. Elmore Leonard would probably shake his head at the undead. GRAVE DANGER did, however, provide plenty of free entertainment in just over 24 pages, so I‚Äôd say it was time and money well spent.\n\nDecember 6, 2016\n\nHeather Graham is a must read author for me and she did not let me down in this short hair raising story of monsters and terror, that unfolded like a movie in my mind, with Prince Charming coming to the rescue and don‚Äôt we all want that?\n\nJanuary 16, 2016\n\nAwesome!\n\nTo be so short, but to be so scary is no easy task. Heather Graham pulls it off like it was easy though. You get pulled in deep, and at the end you are left wanting more but not cliffhanging.\n\nAli is cool but very naive. It gets used against her too often too. I knew loverboy was going to save her, it was a given, but there is a part of me that wish he hadn't. (LOL) Still, I'd like to read more about Ali and Greg. They are rather likable.\n\nA quick-paced thriller short story that lots of people will enjoy, including me!\n\nAugust 1, 2015\n\nThis actually started out pretty good. Then it was rushed, weird and senseless. It kind of is a good glimpse at this author's writing style. If this short story was expanded into a full book, it wouldn't be rushed, but still be weird and mildly senseless, but would understand characters and what is going on better. Which would make it an okay read. As a short story, this just doesn't work at all for me.\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 27, 2014\n\nI love Heather Graham!\n\nI've never written a review before, so here I go! This story catches your attention at the beginning and just keeps you locked in. I didn't want it to end! I love all her books!!!\n\nJuly 3, 2017\n\nOnly Heather Graham could pack a great story into so little of words. This is a must read for her fans.\n\nFebruary 17, 2019\n\nI know this was a short story, but...WOW!!! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!! I have been a big Heather Graham fan for many years and she never fails to entertain with each of her books. Wow!! This one would have been a GREAT full-length novel, but, I enjoyed it all the same. Keep em coming, Heather!!\n\nAugust 22, 2023\n\nDidn‚Äôt realize this was a short story. Clearly it said in the cover but I totally missed it lol üòÇ this was a good short spooky story. I enjoyed it and will probably read the others that follow this book.\n\nApril 26, 2018\n\nIt started out ok, but then was way too rushed. I understand it's a novella, but it could have been a handful of pages longer to help with some of the sensless parts, and made for a bit more detail.\n\nOctober 5, 2018\n\nThey weren't kidding when they said short story! But that's ok. Heather Graham is the ultimate storyteller!\n\nShe does not dissapoint!\n\nApril 3, 2020\n\nOh my goodness this story was short but perfect. üòç love it\n\nAugust 9, 2022\n\nGreat shirt story\n\nLove this short story from Heather Graham! Can not wait to read more from this awesome author! Heather Graham rocks!!!!\n\nFebruary 21, 2017\n\nNot the best short story. It wasn't anything like Heather Graham's usual stories. It started off great but then it seemed to shift scenes to a new character without warning.\n\nJune 15, 2015\n\nReview originally appeared on Books That Hook\n\n‚ÄúGrave Danger‚Äù is a short story I downloaded for free on Amazon. I just checked and it is still free if you want to give it a try.\n\nMy thoughts: It‚Äôs a quick, entertaining read. Ali works as a special effects artist. She‚Äôs working late one night and hears something. Meanwhile, her ex-boyfriend, a cop, is investigating a body in a graveyard on the set near where Ali is working. One he realizes that Ali is still there, he rushes to find her. Good thing he does because Ali is about to fall victim to a deranged killer.\n\nLike most short stories I have read, I was left with a lot of questions. I never fully understood why the killer murdered the man in the graveyard. There didn‚Äôt seem to be a motive for that, other than the killer was insane. I also didn‚Äôt understand the identity confusion regarding the victim.\n\nThere was a good amount of suspense. I definitely felt afraid for Ali. Graham does a great job of setting up the creepy atmosphere of the special effects studio.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed reading ‚ÄúGrave Danger.‚Äù It‚Äôs a great little read for the Halloween season.\n\nJanuary 14, 2014\n\nP≈ôedstavte si, ≈æe nastoup√≠te do letadla.

Enjoyed what it could have been with more time.\n\nOctober 25, 2013\n\nThis is another short story that should have been a full length novel. And if it were, it would have become more of a romance than anything else. There was too much back story to the two main characters that was tried to be pushed in and ended up leaving me wondering what had happened in their relationship before the story started. Additionally, the ending between the two left me even more confused. And then when you add in the murder, that confuses me even more. When I say confused, I knew what was going on while it was going on, but it left me needing more. There were so many details left out that would have made this whole story that much better. Still worth the read though.\n\nMay 7, 2014\n\nRATING: 1 1/2 STARS\n\nThis story had me up til the point where Ali and Greg come face to face with the killer. What followed was some of the most asinine dialogue. I mean I can see how being faced with certain death makes you realizes the stupid mistakes you made life and your true feelings for loved ones but it just seemed out of place. Don't get me started on the things the killer said.\n\nIn my opinion the premise of this book does not lend itself to short story form. Events need to be spread out, character backgrounds and relationships sometimes need to be flushed out in order for the reader i.e. me, to care about them.\n\nJanuary 9, 2018\n\nRead in Love Is Murder. It was an okay story for 24 pages. The dialogue wasn't too great. Actually at times it was silly. I didn't like the atmosphere the story was placed in. A creepy Hollywood monster studio and a grave yard?? Not a fan of any hint of the paranormal either.\n\nAugust 15, 2012\n\nShort, not so sweet.... this is a great story that was a little confusing in places, but fun anyway. Take a few minutes and enjoy this creepy little gem of a tale. Another way to raise your blood pressure!\n\nDid I say I love this woman and her creepy settings? She will wake you up! Beautiful locales, good people, creepy things that go bump in the night - what more would any ghost fan want or need?\n\nAugust 25, 2012\n\nThis book grabbed my interest from the start! The author really knows how to develop characters and a great plot to keep the reader on edge! This is the first time I have read any of the author's work but with this appetizer of a story I will definitely venture in reading her novels.\n\nI enjoyed the thrill of the suspense with a great mixture of love, danger, and horror!\n\nA MUST QUICK READ!!\n\nJanuary 9, 2013\n\nI normally enjoy books/stories by this author. This was a free kindle download back in the fall of 2012. That being said, I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it. This was more romance than mystery. Given the fact this is a short story, I still felt the story was rushed and I was doing a lot of mental eye-rolling. I'll stick to her full-length books from now on.\n\nApril 5, 2016\n\nAuthor Heather Graham is one of my favorite authors when I need something to make me get chills or think-outside-the-box. She combines suspense, drama, romance, horror and mystery perfectly in this very quick and very short read that will make you jump in surprise than in joy for Ali.\n\nFebruary 1, 2017\n\nI really liked this short story. It was exciting and made me seek out the anthology that it is a part of--the love is murder book. Anyway, I have never read a Heather Graham book before but would like to check in on some of her books because this story had a good mix of crime story, suspense and mystery and romance that I like in my reads. Very good.\n\nJanuary 17, 2013\n\nThis book was great. I love paranormal stuff in books. However, this book could have been amazing if it was a full length book. The story seemed over before it even began. But on a positive note. Heather Graham will be added to the list of authors I like to read."
