        "text": "J.L. Austin (born March 28, 1911, Lancaster, Lancashire, England—died February 8, 1960, Oxford) was a British philosopher best known for his individualistic analysis of human thought derived from detailed study of ordinary language.\n\nAfter receiving early education at Shrewsbury School and Balliol College, Oxford, he became a fellow at All Souls College (1933) and Magdalen College (1935), where he studied traditional Greco-Roman classics, which later influenced his thinking. After service in the British intelligence corps during World War II, he returned to Oxford and eventually became White’s professor of moral philosophy (1952–60) and an influential instructor of the ordinary-language movement.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPhilosophy 101\n\nAustin believed that linguistic analysis could provide many solutions to philosophical riddles, but he disapproved of the language of formal logic, believing it contrived and inadequate and often not as complex and subtle as ordinary language."
