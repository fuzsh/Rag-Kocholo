Moore, it is the identification and refutation, in his Principia Ethica of what he called the ?naturalistic facility?.? (A.N. Prior, Logic and the Basis of Ethics?, p.1) G.E. Moore is famous in the annals of moral philosophy for his coinage of the term ?naturalistic fallacy? as well as his twin theses of the indefinability and intuitiveness of ?good?. The present study examines Moore?s these and attempts to assess his influence on contemporary moral philosophers."
