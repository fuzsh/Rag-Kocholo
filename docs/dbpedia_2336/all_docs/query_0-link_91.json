        "text": "Battle of Biala PodlaskaPart of the French invasion of Russia\n\nAlbrecht Adam\n\nDate18 October 1812Location\n\nBiala Podlaska, Poland\n\nCoordinates:\n\n⧼validator-fatal-error⧽\n\nBelligerents French Empire Russian EmpireCommanders and leaders Jean Reynier von Essen\n\nThe Battle of Biala Podlaska was a battle fought on 18 August between Reynier and von Essen and the Russians were defeated.\n\nPrelude[edit]\n\nThe guerrilla actions of the Russians became increasingly aggressive. General Yefim Ignatiewitch Tshaplitz did a lot of damage within Lithuania, disturbing even the formation of the militia there. Tshemishev spread terror in the French rear areas, as far as Warsaw, Vengrov and Siedlice. He created so much destruction that Schwarzenberg was forced to attack von Essen, who had been sent forward to receive Tshemishev.\n\nBattle[edit]\n\nThe fight between Reynier and Essen on 18 October took place near Biala, in which the Russians were defeated. The Russians learnt by these raids that the Poles were no longer excited to fight for Napoleon as he did not support their national aspirations enough.\n\nAftermath[edit]\n\nOn the 26 October Tshaplitz was observing numerous campfires around Studienka and French scouting of the banks, obviously in search of a crossing site, and he reported this at once to Tshitshagov and Langeron.\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nRiehn, Richard K.
