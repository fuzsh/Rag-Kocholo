        "text": "Did you know that... the Fortress of Santa Engracia\n\nGuarding the access to Castilla, the ruins of the Fortress of Santa Engracia are located at the top of the Castillete peak, on one of the rocky walls that surround the Pancorbo gorge. Construction began in 1794 during the Convention War in order to block the passage of French revolutionary troops towards Castilla. The execution of the works was not without its difficulties, the haste with which they were carried out, the orography of the terrain, the inclement weather, the lack of money... Three years later, in 1797, the fortress was operational and finished. During the War of Independence in 1808 it was taken and occupied by Napoleon's troops, who remained there until 1813, when it was recovered by General O'Donnell in the battle known as the \"Siege of Pancorbo\". A decade later, in 1823, it was again the French troops, \"The Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis\", who, under the orders of the Duke of Angoulême, destroyed it in order to prevent the liberal troops fighting against the absolutist Ferdinand VII, they became strong here. Thus ended the short but intense wartime history of the Fortress of Santa Engracia, but its strategic location brought it back to life in the mid-19th century when its towers were used as position 32 of the Line of Castile, as part of the optical telegraph system.\n\nWhat to see in the Fortress of Santa Engracia?\n\nThe work to recover the architectural remains and the spectacular orography in which the ruins of the Fortress of Santa Engracia are located make it an ideal place to visit, enjoying, at the same time, nature and history in a setting that will not leave us impassive. Santa Engracia was a complex fortification made up of various bastions, the remains of which can be recreated today by following a network of paths and walkways and with the help of the information panels placed in situ. The entire defensive complex had a capacity for 3575 people. The fortress is distributed around a Parade Ground protected by a series of bastions: the Navas Front to the north, San Nicolás to the east, San Bernardo and San Sebastián to the south and San Carlos to the west. All of them were formed by different bastions and batteries. The San Bernardo front mainly housed the soldiers. The fortified complex also had all kinds of auxiliary facilities essential for daily life, cisterns and numerous caves that housed a bakery, kitchen, blacksmith's, hospital, food and ammunition stores, etc. As a culmination and complement to this entertaining visit, we can rest and entertain ourselves by watching the Losinos horses, native to the area and bred in semi-freedom. We can also follow the hiking route, Path of Pancorbo PRC BU89, which takes us from Pancorbo to this incredible Fortress of Santa Engracia.\n\nCuriosities\n\nIn the 18th century, troops were recruited by voluntary enlistment, by fifths, taking one man out of every five, or by levies (recruitment of people for service, generally soldiers, which was done especially of criminals and vagabonds to nourish the ranks of the army in war). The conditions required were to be between 16 and 40 years old, to be catholic-apostolic-roman, at least 1.40m tall, and not to be what was then called \" infamous extracion \", a mulatto, a gypsy, an executioner or a butcher.\n\nUseful information for visiting the Fortress of Santa Engracia\n\nThe ruins of the Fortress of Santa Engracia and its perimeter are areas of archaeological presumption that are protected.\n\nThe Fortress of Santa Engracia was declared an Asset of Cultural Interest in 1949.\n\nThe geographical environment in which it is located is part of the Montes Obarenes Natural Area, an ecosystem that has been protected since 1991.\n\nYour visit is on your own.\n\nAccess is signposted and there are information panels.\n\nIt is important to wear comfortable shoes, warm clothes, especially in winter, and in summer water and a hat or visor.\n\nThe Legend\n\nCome invasions that will crash; fear not Castilla, they will not pass; nor from Andalucía the fierce Moor, nor from the Pyrenees the great Napoleon; watch in Santa Engracia of Spain the lion (from the hymn to Pancorbo, lyrics by Don Teodoro de Izarra, 1940).\n\nOTHER PLANS AND EXCURSIONS IN BURGOS\n\n​\n\nSOME ROUTES NEAR THE FORTRESS OF SANTA ENGRACIA\n\nPancorbo Gorge\n\nWalk of the Molinar\n\nGorge of the Purón River\n\nMORE ROUTES AVAILABLE, DON'T MISS IT...\n\n​\n\nMORE PLACES TO VISIT IN BURGOS\n\nMonastery of San Pedro de Arlanza\n\nLobos River Canyon Natural Park\n\nMonastery of Santo Domingo de Silos\n\nMORE PLACES AVAILABLE, DON'T MISS IT...\n\n​\n\nCHARMING VILLAGES OF BURGOS\n\nWhat to see in Lerma\n\nWhat to see in Caleruega\n\nWhat to see in Aranda de Duero\n\nGet to Pancorbo by car\n\nThe town of Pancorbo is located in the middle of the N-1 road, colloquially known as the road to Irún, in the section between Miranda de Ebro and Briviesca.
