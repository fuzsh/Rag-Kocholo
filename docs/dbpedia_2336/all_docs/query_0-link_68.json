        "text": "[Nursing in the movies: its image during the Spanish Civil War].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSiles GonzÃ¡lez, J; GarcÃ­a HernÃ¡ndez, E; Cibanal Juan, L; Gallardo FrÃ­as, Y; Lillo Crespo, M\n\n1998-12-01\n\nThe cinema had carried out a determining role in the development of stereotypes and in a wide gamut of models related to real life situations. The objective of this analysis is to determine the influence cinema had on the image of nurses during the Spanish Civil War from 1936-1939. These are the initial hypotheses: the role of Spanish nurses during the civil war was reflected by both sides in their respective movie productions; and the image of nurses shown in these films, on both sides, presents a conflicting role concept for women in society. Following strategies developed by specialists in film analysis (Bondwell 1995, Uneso 1995, Carmona 1991) a total of 453 movie productions, 360 on the republican side and 93 on the national side, were reviewed. These films were listed in the Spanish National Films Library records. After analyzing the Spanish cinema productions during the Spanish Civil War, data relating to 453 films were identified. The genre included documents, news programs and fiction movies. 77 were produced in 1936, 235 in 1937, 102 in 1938 and 39 in 1939. A tremendous difference exists between the republican productions, 79% of the total, and the national productions. By genres, the types produced on the republican side were: in 1936, 53 documentals, 4 news programs and 9 fiction films; in 1937, 186 documentals, 5 news programs and 19 fiction films; in 1938, 72 documentals, 1 news programs and 2 fiction films; in 1939, 2 documentals and 2 fiction films. On the national side, their productions were: in 1936, 10 documentals and 1 fiction film; in 1937, 22 documentals, 2 news programs and 1 fiction film; in 1938, 19 documentals and 3 news programs; in 1939, 29 documentals and 6 fiction films. During the Spanish Civil War, movies produced by both sides made an effort to reflect their ideal woman as a stereotypical ideal nurse. This ideal nurse showed the values, ideas, aesthetics and prejudices each side held in the war.\n\nSacrifice and Commitment: American Volunteers in the Spanish Civil War\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnders Greenspan\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939 was the last European war before the start of World War II. The war, an ideological struggle between Francisco Franco and his nationalist supporters, aided by the Germans and Italians, sought to remove from power the Spanish Republic, which was aided by the Soviet Union. On both sides of the conflict were volunteers from many countries, including the United States of America. American volunteers fought on both sides of the war, yet more chose the side of the Republicans. Many, but not all, were motivated by political beliefs. Others wanted the perceived romance and excitement of battle, or the sense that they were being of help. The volunteers discussed in this study came from all of these categories, with the ones having political motivation the largest group. They detailed their experiences and their views of the war to their friends, families and comrades back home in the United States. These letters, which come from the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives at New York University, form the main part of the study and provide a deeper insight into what these men and women were thinking, as well as providing insight into their desire to fight in Spain. Through their eyes it is possible to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and their motivations. For many of them, their experiences in Spain formed an important part of their journey in life. Some of them remained loyal to the Communist ideology throughout their lives, while others changed their views as the ruthlessness of Stalin became better known. A modern audience can benefit from a chance to read their thoughts and ideas in an attempt to better understand the events that helped drive the world into the Second World War.\n\nSacrifice and Commitment: American Volunteers in the Spanish Civil War\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnders Greenspan\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939 was the last European war before the start of World War II.

There are currently over 2,000 known mass burial locations throughout Spain, but many more are unknown. Geophysics is a useful tool employed to help in the active attempts to document and improve knowledge about victims from this conflict. This paper details a non-invasive study of the Cementerio de El Salvador, in the city of Oviedo, Northern Spain. Part of the cemetery contains a known mass burial with approximately 1,300 individuals from the Spanish Civil War and post-war repression eras. Multi-frequency near-surface geophysical techniques were undertaken, after permission, to enhance knowledge about which, if any, techniques should be used to detect, delineate and analyse such mass graves. Multi-frequency (250MHz and 500MHz) ground-penetrating radar surveys were acquired together with 2D and 3D Electrical Resistivity Tomography datasets. The results have established the limits of the mass grave and improve the knowledge of the internal mass grave structure. The paper also shows the importance of considering the climatic conditions during data acquisition. This has important implications for the successful detection of recent historical mass burials using near-surface geophysics. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Madrid, the capital of Spain, was under food, water and milk rationing during that period. This situation led to conditions that showed the relationships between the nervous system and nutrition. The Madrilenian population was submitted to a real experiment of hyponutrition, similar to the one that may be reproduced at the laboratory. At the end of the war, the National Direction on Health and the Institute of Medical Investigations, with the collaboration of the Rockefeller Foundation, carried out a series of clinical and food consumption surveys among the Madrilenian population. There were three medical situations that were of particular relevance during the Civil War and after it: the pellagra epidemics, the onset of lathyrism, and the socalled Vallecas syndrome. The occurrence of pellagra cases was paramount because it allowed reconsidering all the unspecific symptoms observed from an already known vitamin deficiency. Pellagra became the most prevalent deficitrelated disease, and most clearly related to nutrition. Lathyrism is a chronic intoxication produced by the accumulation of neurotoxins. It is due to common intake of chickling peas (Lathyrus sativus). Chickling peas are toxic only if they represent more than 30% of the daily calories consumed for a prolonged period greater than two to three months. Lathyrism would reoccur in the Spanish population after the war, in 1941 and 1942, the so called \"famine years\", when due to the scarcity of foods chickling pea flour was again consumed in high amounts. Deficiency-related neuropathies observed in Madrid during the Civil War led to new and original clinical descriptions. In children from schools of the Vallecas neighborhood, a deficiency syndrome, likely related to vitamin B complex deficiency, was described, which\n\nOld and new memories of the Civil War\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nDominguez Prats, Pilar\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis article examines autobiographical narratives of the Spanish Civil War by way of war diaries, letters and memoirs which have been published between 2006 and 2013. Since the beginning of the war the trauma caused to Spanish society has led to a substantial number of personal narratives. These sources, based upon individual experiences, are of great value for constructing a multi-faceted history of the war itself. We examine memoirs and diaries which for various reasons have not been publis...\n\nTourism in Conflict Zones. The Promotion of Spanish Civil War Heritage in the Community of Madrid\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOscar Navajas Corral\n\n2017-05-01\n\nFull Text Available For more than a decade, the processes of patrimonialization of spaces and cultural assets of the Spanish Civil War have been strengthened. The Community of Madrid has not been, and is not, alien to this process. Since the creation of the Grupo de Estudios del Frente de Madrid (GEFREMA in 2002, associations whose objective is to investigate this historical period and its material legacy, research, and patrimonialisation processes in the region have continued to increase. Arganda del Rey, Morata de TajuÃ±a, Guadarrama, Buitrago de Lozoya, Madrid, etc., are some of the places where heritage is already available to citizens and is offered as a tourist resource. This article presents an investigation that analyzes the different spaces of the Spanish Civil War that have recovered in the region of Madrid. Based on the museological theories, which provides the communication and interpretation of the heritage, and the methodologies for the collection of quantitative and qualitative data, we have evaluated the different places in which this heritage has been valued in order to be able to Define its main variables and also be able to build proposals for its future and for future interventions elsewhere.\n\nPublic health and nutrition after the Spanish Civil War. An intervention by the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDel Cura, Isabel; Huertas, Rafael\n\n2009-10-01\n\nWe describe a nutritional intervention by the Rockefeller Foundation's International Health Division in Spain after the Spanish Civil War, delineating the relationships between the technicians sent by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Spanish health authorities. We analyze reports of the nutritional situation in Spain in the early 1940s and the design and outcomes of a nutrition survey conducted in a district of Madrid by American and Spanish nutritionists. This nutritional survey, which was based on food intake interviews and was complemented with anthropometric measurements, clinical examinations, and blood tests, found several symptoms and signs of malnutrition. The Rockefeller Foundation's nutritional research was an important historical precedent for later studies made in emergency situations or armed conflicts. Similar surveys have been carried out in the last several decades by distinguished academic departments of public health and epidemiology and by humanitarian aid agencies.\n\nArt of urgency. Contributions to the Critical Debate of the Spanish Civil War Propaganda art.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMiguel Ãngel Gamonal Torres\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The concept Â«arte de urgenciaÂ» defined, during the Spanish Civil War propaganda art, the artistic practice of agit-prop ofÂ Leninist inspiration. This article provides a critical review of the debate held by the artists and writers to the dissatisfactionÂ produced by this type of art. Authors of Marxist affiliation or linked to the Spanish Popular Front positions, took partÂ in the debate about Realism and the modern meanings of agitation (poster, photomontage, typography. This discussionÂ took place in some important press and literary ambience, reflects a common concern to the artistic environments of theÂ European left-wing parties and it had also a general objection from the anarchist positions.\n\nGuns, culture and moors : racial stereotypes and the cultural impact of the Moroccan participation in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nTuma, al A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe presence of tens of thousands of Moroccan soldiers in Spain during its Civil War was an encounter between two culturally different people.

It is surprising that theÂ media world considers it ânewsworthyâ and that it has an important presence on theÂ Internet â on blogs, websites, You Tube, and even social media platforms such asÂ Facebook and Twitter.Â This article examines all mention of the Civil War in online media. We start fromÂ the idea that the features of the online world allow for an extensive and multifacetedÂ production of media of content which is more cultural, more social, and moreÂ attuned to the passing of time.\n\nCivil War\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nChristopher Blattman; Edward Miguel\n\n2010-01-01\n\nMost nations have experienced an internal armed conflict since 1960. The past decade has witnessed an explosion of research into the causes and consequences of civil wars, belatedly bringing the topic into the economics mainstream. This article critically reviews this interdisciplinary literature and charts productive paths forward. Formal theory has focused on a central puzzle: why do civil wars occur at all when, given the high costs of war, groups have every incentive to reach an agreement...\n\nRepresentations of the Spanish Civil War in early Francoist history textbooks\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChristian ROITH\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Textbooks are effective tools to understand the idiosyncrasies of certain historical time periods as they allow us to examine the ideologies, concepts and values of the social groups in power. Those textbooks which were in use in the areas occupied by the Fascist National troops under the insurgent General Francisco Francoâs command and in all of Spain after his victory permit us to draw conclusions about the characteristics of the Francoist ideology. The analysis of original material collected and classified by the Spanish research project of textbooks (manes, as well as the review of theoretical studies demonstrates that Francoist schoolbooks to a large extent reproduced contents proceeding from the monarchic period before the Second Republic. The representations of the Civil War in these textbooks condense the most important doctrinal principles of the Franco dictatorship and reveal the existing ideological differences between different tendencies represented in the regime. Furthermore, the analysis of these texts shows that the ideological indoctrination through schoolbooks was an essential element of the totalitarian efforts of the Franco regime.\n\nCivil War and Inoperativity\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nFlohr, Mikkel\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis article analyses the penultimate publication in Giorgio Agambens Homo Sacer-series Stasis: Civil War as a Political Paradigm. It compares and contrasts the paradigm of civil war with the preceding paradigm of the exception, and identifies a significant displacement in the relationship between...... civil war and the sovereign state, in spite of Agambenâs insistence on their continuity. Agambenâs decoupling of civil war and the sovereign state facilitates novel political possibilities that unfortunately remain underdeveloped in the book. The article proceeds to develop Agambenâs brief intimations...... of inoperativity towards a concept of destituent power drawing on his other writings. It makes the argument for thinking civil war and inoperativity â stasis and stasis â together to derive a concept of destituent power as a form of revolution against the sovereign state, which does not constitute a new sovereign...\n\nThe Catholic Propaganda abroad two Spains during the Civil War\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJosÃ© Luis GONZÃLEZ GULLÃN\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available This research analyzes the propaganda abroad developed the priests Leocadio Lobo and Alberto Bonet during the Spanish Civil War, both the service of republican government and the insurgent coalition, respectively. This has been resorted to important documentary sources and texts of the time, which gives us a fairly detailed picture of the dialectic that generated intense fighting in various European countries the performance of the Spanish Church between 1936 and 1939.\n\nLegalisation of Civil Wars\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBuhl, Kenneth ÃhlenschlÃ¦ger\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis article is concerned with the legal challenges of regulating civil wars in international humanitarian law. Civil war is not a term used in international law; it falls however, withing the context of the legal term 'armed conflicts not of an international character', although the shorter 'non......-international armed conflict' is used here. Civil wars are usually limited to the territory of a state. Considering that international law is generally concerned with the legal relations between states â being a legal system based on the system of states with states as its subjects â the main question is how civil...... wars as internal conflicts have become subject to international humanitarian law....\n\nBetween Myth and Memory: Images of Spanish Civil War | Entre el mito y la memoria: imÃ¡genes de una guerra\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPedro PayÃ¡ LÃ³pez\n\n2007-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper examines the role of the cinema in forming the image of the Spanish civil war over the last seventy years, or, to put it another way, how this image has passed from myth to memory. We have taken the generational element into consideration, distinguishing three periods in the forming of the image of the civil war from the perspective of the cinema: that of the protagonists, covering films produced by both camps during the war, as well as those made during the forty years of the dictatorship; that of the Â«war babiesÂ» who carried out the political transition, a period that covers films produced during the last years of the Franco regime and up to the 1980s; that of the Â«grandchildren of the warÂ», who, with the change of century, have moved to vindicate the memory of the victims of the civil war and the Franco regime as a means of securing recognition. | El presente trabajo aborda el papel de las imÃ¡genes (cinematogrÃ¡ficas en la formaciÃ³n de la imagen (mental de la guerra civil espaÃ±ola durante los Ãºltimos setenta aÃ±os o, lo que es lo mismo, cÃ³mo estas imÃ¡genes han pasado del mito a la memoria. El anÃ¡lisis tiene en cuenta el componente generacional, de tal forma que distingue claramente tres periodos en la formaciÃ³n de la memoria cinematogrÃ¡fica de la guerra civil: el de los protagonistas, que comprende las producciones realizadas en ambos bandos durante el conflicto bÃ©lico, ademÃ¡s de las llevadas a cabo durante cuarenta aÃ±os de dictadura; el de los Â«hijos de la guerraÂ», que realizaron la transiciÃ³n polÃ­tica, etapa que abarca las producciones realizadas desde el tardo-franquismo hasta la dÃ©cada de los ochenta; y el de los Â«nietos de la guerraÂ», que con el cambio de siglo han reivindicado la recuperaciÃ³n de la memoria de las vÃ­ctimas de la guerra civil y la dictadura franquista en clave de reparaciÃ³n.\n\nThe heavy and shadowy burden of the Spanish Civil War in childrenâs narrative\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJosÃ© Belmonte\n\nFull Text Available Literature intended for adults âespecially in narrative-, which tackles with the Spanish Civil War in a deep and critical way, is also clearly and specifically reflected in those others books written for a younger Reading public. In this sub-category, two of the earliest and most outstanding works where this controversial topic is treated are Elena FortÃºnâs Celia en la revoluciÃ³n, written in 1943 but not published till 1987, and JosÃ© Luis Castillo-Pucheâs El perro loco, which appeared in 1965 and commendably got round the rigid censorship of the period. In these and later works (analysed here down to the present day, issues that are polemical even today, such as the violence perpetrated by both sides, childrenâs suffering, painful exile, the difficult reconciliation between victors and defeated, as well as the Francoist repression in postwar era.\n\nBetween Propaganda and Truth: changing patterns in the Polish historiography about the Civil War\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOlga GLONDYS\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available This article examines the transformation of public and historiographical discourse on the Spanish Civil War in Poland, exploring the post-Stalinist period and current democratic Poland. It explains how, during these two very different eras: the dictatorial, communist past and the capitalist, liberal-democratic present, historical discourse concerning the past has been transformed so as to meet the prevailing political needs and demands of today. The conclusions reached here point to a change of paradigm in historiographical discourse on the Civil War, and encourage reflection on the epistemological and methodological implications that historical processes raise for the historianâs task.\n\nAdvertising as a Communicative Phenomenon during the Spanish Civil War\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDra. Araceli RodrÃ­guez Mateos\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Advertising is a phenomenon that has helped to model societies during the last century. In order to know how it has participated in some change processes it is essential to analyse its communicative dimension. Within the theoretical framework of the History of Social Communication, this research studies the function of the commercial discourse during the Spanish Civil War. Results in three levels have been concluded with an analytic model focused on the messages spread in the press. First, the modern evolution of the advertising technique is confirmed. Second, the different alignment of advertising is compared with the propagandistic discourse of each faction, as well as with its ideological and commercial interests, and with the different relationship with consumers about events. Third, advertisements allow us to observe many details about current life better than the information censored does; specifically, the struggle to survive in the most damaged republican cities is clearly perceived. - TraducciÃ³n supervisada por la Dra.

We consider the e ect of variations in the Palmer Drought Severity Index (Palmer 1965) - a cumulative index that combines precipitation, temperature and the local characteristics of the soil - on the risk of civil war. While the recent, contentious debate on the link between climate and civil war has mainly focused on precipitation and temperature, without obtaining converging results, the Palmer index describes soci...\n\nThe Civil War Diet\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBrennan, Matthew Philip\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe soldierÃ¢ s diet in the Civil War has been known as poor, and a number of illnesses and disorders have been associated with it. However, a nutritional analysis placed within the context of mid-nineteenth century American nutrition has been lacking. Such an approach makes clear the connection between illness and diet during the war for the average soldier and defines the importance of nutritionÃ¢ s role in the war. It also provides a bridge from the American diet to the soldier diet, ou...\n\nClimate not to blame for African civil wars\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBuhaug, Halvard\n\n2010-01-01\n\nVocal actors within policy and practice contend that environmental variability and shocks, such as drought and prolonged heat waves, drive civil wars in Africa. Recently, a widely publicized scientific article appears to substantiate this claim. This paper investigates the empirical foundation for the claimed relationship in detail. Using a host of different model specifications and alternative measures of drought, heat, and civil war, the paper concludes that climate variability is a poor predictor of armed conflict. Instead, African civil wars can be explained by generic structural and contextual conditions: prevalent ethno-political exclusion, poor national economy, and the collapse of the Cold War system.

Instead, African civil wars can be explained by generic structural and contextual conditions: prevalent ethno-political exclusion, poor national economy, and the collapse of the Cold War system.\n\nThe Aftermath of Civil War\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nChen, Siyan; Loayza, Norman V.; Reynal-Querol, Marta\n\n2007-01-01\n\nUsing an event-study methodology, the article analyzes the aftermath of civil war in a cross-section of countries.

This article examines this apparent contradiction: it describes briefly the international context of contemporary conflicts and it refers to the just-war tradition in order to analyze both the position of the Charter of the United Nations and the justifications given by Western countries.

We present here four cases where signs of autopsy were observed in the remains recovered from mass graves and cemeteries of prisoners from the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), victims of extrajudicial executions, and of death in prison, respectively. With respect to the former, historical evidence indicate that during the first weeks after the coup, official removal of cadavers and autopsy procedures were carried out to the first victims of extrajudicial killings, whose corpses were found abandoned in the road. Once the civil war was established and systematic extrajudicial killings were systematic, official military orders were issued to stop standard forensic proceedings. Therefore, autopsy marks observed in the remains exhumed from mass graves located in cemeteries may be indicative of an earlier chronology of the killings, and this information proved to be relevant for the identification process in one of the cases presented. In a cemetery of political prisoners, autopsy signs were also observed in two skeletal remains and in the official records of two prisoners, a corroboration of information also relevant for the identification process. These findings indicate that autopsy marks can be found in the remains of victims of human rights violations exhumed from cemeteries. Skeletal and archival information could be useful for the identification process in other cases of large-scale violence, where the first victims of extrajudicial executions were buried unidentified in cemeteries after autopsy procedures.\n\nThe Civil War in Spain, 1936-1939 and the Image of Enemy in the British Fascist Press\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVera V. Malay\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The article deals with the analysis of publications of British Fascists newspapers 'Action' and 'The Blackshirt' during the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939. The main directions of image of enemy formation are studied on the example of these papers. Forms of presentation and ways of international problems interpreting by far-right publications are studied. The fascist newspaper Action, The Fascist Week and The Blackshirt spoke from the position of nationalism, Imperial identity, anti-liberalism, anti-Soviet and anti-Semitism. The concept of \"communism\" in the pages of the fascist press has accumulated the most precisely the image of enemy. Articles and notes shaped confusion between \"Soviet\", \"red\" and \"Communist\". The USSR seemed to be \"the warmonger\" and the \"architect of the Civil war in Spain\". The destructive role of Soviet Russia in the conflict was proved in the British fascist press. Soviet Union was accused of seeking to plunge Spain and Europe into anarchy. In British fascist publications trend towards stereotyping and myth-making were noticeable, they were opposed to \"Western\" civilization (as individualistic and \"Eastern\", \"Communist\" (oppressive, traditionalist.\n\nAPPROACHES TO CIVIL WARS: âHOW DO LEADERS LEAD, AND WHY DO FOLLOWERS FOLLOW?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPizwak Imtiaz\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper analyses the theories of civil wars as envisioned by three civil war theories presented by Stathis Kalivas (2000, 2009, Michael Brown (1996 and Fearon and Laitin (2003. The paper begins with the definitions and typology of civil wars, as envisioned by the three theories and highlights possible points of convergence among the three, in terms of the causes and process of civil war onset. Further, it comments upon individual nuances of the theories, and criticizes common aspects to present a comparative framework regarding theories of civil wars. The argument favours a systematic understanding of civil wars as presented by Stathis Kalyvas, through a thorough depiction of his structural and multifaceted understanding of the causes of civil war, based on the idea of violence. Although Brownâs contribution regarding the permissive and proximate causes of civil wars is critical towards distinguishing catalysts from underlying causes of civil wars, his reliance on elite-centred theories has been criticized. Fearon and Laitinâs empirical analysis although invaluable towards dispelling the centrality given to ethnic and religious diversity earlier, lacks in an understanding of what leads to actual violence. Towards the end, a more interpretative form of research is required to see how several factors cause internal conflict and are also endogenous and interconnected with the actors (government, insurgents, civilians, to understand the persistence of different forms of violence in civil wars.\n\nClimate change and the Syrian civil war revisited\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSelby, Jan; Dahi, Omar S; FrÃ¶hlich, Christiane; Hulme, Mike\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFor proponents of the view that anthropogenic climate change will become a âthreat multiplierâ for instability in the decades ahead, the Syrian civil war has become a recurring reference point, providing apparently compelling evidence that such conflict effects are already upon us.

We argue that the distinct modes of violent opposition are chosen by opposition groups...... in response to the strengths and weaknesses of the system they challenge. An empirical test of this hypothesis for 104 countries for 1992 to 2004 indeed shows that the socio-economic strength of a system positively correlates with the likelihood of terrorism, but negatively with the incidence of civil war....... Institutional quality and political participation of opponents reduce the risk of civil war, but do not affect the likelihood of terrorism. We also show that system stability reduces the likelihood of all forms of violent opposition....\n\nTowards a phenomenology of civil war: Hobbes meets Benjamin in Beirut.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDe Cauter, Lieven\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBased on interviews with Beirut intellectuals and architects, this essay endeavours to trace the contours for a phenomenology or anthropology of civil war. Thomas Hobbes serves as a guide, with his idea of civil war representing a relapse into the âstate of natureâ; as absence of sovereignty resulting in a âwar of everybody against everybodyâ. The effects of ever-latent civil war in Beirut are far-reaching: the fragmentation of urban space and the disappearance of public space, the loss of memory and the fragmentation of time, even the reification of language. In the collective imagination and in the arts, Beirut appears as a ghost town, a spectral city with a spectral civility. What we discover is a city, its inhabitants, its social behaviour, but also its art and literature, in the grip of post-traumatic stress syndrome. From all this, we take home two things: first, any city can (at least in principle) relapse into a similar state of nature â Beirut can become a paradigm of latent civil war; and second, the traumatic modernity of Beirut mirrors the traumatic artistic expressions of modernism â the shock of modernity is also always a modernity of shock.\n\nRhetoric of civil conflict management: United Nations Security Council debates over the Syrian civil war\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJuraj Medzihorsky\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper introduces a spatial model of civil conflict management rhetoric to explore how the emerging norm of responsibility to protect shapes major power rhetorical responses to civil war. Using framing theory, we argue that responsibility to protect functions like a prescriptive norm, such that representing a conflict as one of (1 human rights violations (problem definition, implies rhetorical support for (2 coercive outside intervention (solution identification. These dimensions reflect the problem-solution form of a prescriptive norm. Using dictionary scaling with a dynamic model, we analyze the positions of UN Security Council members in debates over the Syrian Civil War separately for each dimension. We find that the permanent members who emphasized human rights violations also used intervention rhetoric (UK, France, and the US, and those who did not used non-intervention rhetoric (Russia and China. We conclude that, while not a fully consolidated norm, responsibility to protect appears to have structured major power rhetorical responses to the Syrian Civil War.\n\nUnited States Foreign Policy and the Second Liberian Civil War ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nAfter about three years following the end of its first civil war in 1996, Liberia was again plunged into another civil war, when the Liberian United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), a group of rebels, attacked the country from neighbouring Guinea.

They argue that the economic and political factors highlighted in previous research on civil war are largely caused by underlying differences in pathogen intensity, and contend that disease proneness increases the risk of civil war through its effects on resource competition and xenophobia. They present empirical evidence that they interpret as consistent with their argument: a statistically significant correlation between pathogen intensity and civil war onset. In this comment, we raise concerns over their interpretation of the empirical evidence and their proposed causal mechanisms. We find that the data provide stronger evidence for the reverse causal relationship, namely that civil war causes disease to become more prevalent. This finding is consistent with the literatures on the public health effects of civil war as well as research on state capacity and public health. Â© 2011 The Authors.

It led to nearly two hundred thousand men and women executed or murdered extra-judicially or after dubious legal procedures. Nowadays, most of them remain unidentified or even buried in irretraceable mass graves across Spain. Here, we present the genetic identification of human remains found in 26 mass graves located in Northern Spain. A total of 252 post-mortem remains were analyzed and compared to 186 relatives, allowing the identification of 87 victims. Overall, a significant success of DNA profiling was reached, since informative profiles (â¥ 12 STRs and/or mitochondrial DNA profile) were obtained in 85.71% of the remains. This high performance in DNA profiling from challenging samples demonstrated the efficacy of DNA extraction and amplification methods used herein, given that only around 14.29% of the samples did not provide an informative genetic profile for the analysis performed, probably due to the presence of degraded and/or limited DNA in these remains. However, this study shows a partial identification success rate, which is clearly a consequence of the lack of both appropriate family members for genetic comparisons and accurate information about the victims' location. Hence, further perseverance in the exhumation of other intact graves as well as in the search of more alleged relatives is crucial in order to facilitate and increase the number of genetic identifications.

The victorious faction claimed that the ceasing of military operations put an end to the war, but the war did not finish then. For many years, the use of force was still alive, unilaterally, under the form of bloody repression and the long exile of the defeated. Many other facts consist in the imposed moral and psychological suffering, the cultural damage, the banishment and the repercussions of these imponderables on millions of homes. Economic and social afflictions caused to the individuals and to society as a whole are of great weight, In order to appreciate the slow and cruel way chosen by the franquist regime to liquidate the Spanish Civil War it is necessary to illustrate in detail some of the means used. Their failure shows the egoism and meanness of the dictatorial regime.\n\nAssessment of the perioperative period in civilians injured in the Syrian Civil War\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSedat Hakimoglu\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available BACKGROUND: wars and its challenges have historically afflicted humanity. In Syria, severe injuries occurred due to firearms and explosives used in the war between government forces and civilians for a period of over 2 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the study included 364 cases, who were admitted to Mustafa Kemal University Hospital, Medicine School (Hatay, Turkey, and underwent surgery. Survivors and non-survivors were compared regarding injury site, injury type and number of transfusions given. The mortality rate found in this study was also compared to those reported in other civil wars. RESULTS: the mean age was 29 (3-68 years. Major sites of injury included extremities (56.0%, head (20.1%, abdomen (16.2%, vascular structures (4.4% and thorax (3.3%. Injury types included firearm injury (64.4%, blast injury (34.4% and miscellaneous injuries (1.2%. Survival rate was 89.6% while mortality rate was 10.4%. A significant difference was observed between mortality rates in this study and those reported for the Bosnia and Lebanon civil wars; and the difference became extremely prominent when compared to mortality rates reported for Vietnam and Afghanistan civil wars. CONCLUSION: among injuries related to war, the highest rate of mortality was observed in head-neck, abdomen and vascular injuries. We believe that the higher mortality rate in the Syrian Civil War, compared to the Bosnia, Vietnam, Lebanon and Afghanistan wars, is due to seeing civilians as a direct target during war.\n\nMuseums, Memory, and the Just Nation in Post-Civil War El Salvador\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRobin DeLugan\n\n2015-07-01\n\nFull Text Available In 1992 El Salvador ended a 12-year civil war infamous in part for the high level of state violence against innocent civilians. A United Nations Truth Commission report, which detailed these and other excesses, recommended that state and society commemorate the war and its violence to advance the establishment of a more just nation. The postwar government did construct an impressive new National Museum of Anthropology to actively promote national culture, history, and identity. However, this important museum remains silent about the civil war. In contrast, new publicâthough not official - museums and monuments are finally bringing attention to the civil war and past state violence.

In Syria, severe injuries occurred due to firearms and explosives used in the war between government forces and civilians for a period of over 2 years. The study included 364 cases, who were admitted to Mustafa Kemal University Hospital, Medicine School (Hatay, Turkey), and underwent surgery. Survivors and non-survivors were compared regarding injury site, injury type and number of transfusions given. The mortality rate found in this study was also compared to those reported in other civil wars. The mean age was 29 (3-68) years. Major sites of injury included extremities (56.0%), head (20.1%), abdomen (16.2%), vascular structures (4.4%) and thorax (3.3%). Injury types included firearm injury (64.4%), blast injury (34.4%) and miscellaneous injuries (1.2%). Survival rate was 89.6% while mortality rate was 10.4%. A significant difference was observed between mortality rates in this study and those reported for the Bosnia and Lebanon civil wars; and the difference became extremely prominent when compared to mortality rates reported for Vietnam and Afghanistan civil wars. Among injuries related to war, the highest rate of mortality was observed in head-neck, abdomen and vascular injuries. We believe that the higher mortality rate in the Syrian Civil War, compared to the Bosnia, Vietnam, Lebanon and Afghanistan wars, is due to seeing civilians as a direct target during war.

In 1931, the Second Spanish Republic sent ever greater numbers of scholars to study in the United States and established a public health system along the lines of the administrative models for sanitation and technical units for investigation and control as proposed by the Foundation. The Spanish Civil War interrupted this process and Venezuela seized the moment to hire the exiled doctors and nurses and incorporate them into its new Ministry for Sanitation and Social Welfare, created in 1936.\n\nRebuilding after emergency: Revamping agricultural research in Sierra Leone after civil war\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nAsenso-Okyere, Kwadwo; Workneh, Sindu; Rhodes, Edward; Sutherland, John\n\n2009-01-01\n\n\"The civil war in Sierra Leone, caused by a mix of political, social, and economic factors, had a huge impact on the overall economy in general and on the performance of the agricultural sector in particular.

While only amounting to a brief period in American history in terms of years, this war has proved to be one of the central moments for defining the American nation since the second half of the nineteenth century. The facets of the Civil War, its protagonists, places, events, and political, social and cultural underpinnings seem to hold an ongoing fascination for both academic studies and fictional representations. Thus, it has been considered by many the most written-about war in the United States.\n\nAssessment of the perioperative period in civilians injured in the Syrian Civil War\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSedat Hakimoglu\n\n2015-11-01\n\nConclusion: among injuries related to war, the highest rate of mortality was observed in headâneck, abdomen and vascular injuries.

The author analyzes its historical significance in the international context, as well in the context of political, economical and social evolution of Spain. Spain was one of the few major European Powers that maintained its neutrality throughout the First World War. Although all Spanish governments during the conflict declared strict neutrality, it was, in actual fact, benevolent towards the Entente Powers, and by the end of hostilities Spain turned into \"neutral ally\" of Entente. This benevolence towards the future winners and a wide humanitarian campaign supported and headed by the King Alfonso XIII enabled Spain to improve her position in the postwar system of international relations; Spain became one of the non-permanent members of the League of Nations Council. Nevertheless the Spanish neutrality had a negative impact upon the social, political and economical evolution of Spain. The social stratification was increased, the public opinion was deeply divided and the social conflicts were aggravated, that considerably affected the further evolution of the Spanish society.\n\nSecuring the Peace After Civil War\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2009-03-01\n\ntransportation infrastructure has been destroyed.

In two-- Sierra Leone during 1991-2002, and Somalia from 1988 and continuing--adult HIV prevalence remained below 1%. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, HIV prevalence appears to have stabilised during post-1991 civil disorder and war. Limited information from Angola (civil war 1975 -2002) and Liberia (civil disorder and war from 1989 and continuing) suggests low HIV prevalence. Mozambique's HIV prevalence was near 1% after its 1975 - 1992 civil war, but increased dramatically in the first post-war decade. Across African countries with long-term wars, HIV seems to have spread more slowly than in most neighbouring countries at peace. This evidence contributes to the ongoing debate about the factors that explain differential epidemic trajectories, a debate which is crucial to the design of HIV prevention programmes. One possible explanation for slow epidemic growth in wartime is that unsterile health care accounts for an important proportion of HIV transmission during peacetime, but much less when wars disrupt health services. However, other explanations are also possible. The roles of sex and blood exposures in HIV epidemics in war and peace await empirical determination.\n\nAurora painting pays tribute to Civil War's end\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLove, Jeffrey J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis year marks the sesquicentennial anniversary of the end of the American Civil War, a conflict that Abraham Lincoln called a âmighty scourge.â It was one of the most poignant periods in U.S. history, laying bare political, economic, social, and moral divergence between Northern and Southern states.

Here we undertake the first comprehensive examination of the potential impact of global climate change on armed conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. We find strong historical linkages between civil war and temperature in Africa, with warmer years leading to significant increases in the likelihood of war. When combined with climate model projections of future temperature trends, this historical response to temperature suggests a roughly 54% increase in armed conflict incidence by 2030, or an additional 393,000 battle deaths if future wars are as deadly as recent wars. Our results suggest an urgent need to reform African governments' and foreign aid donors' policies to deal with rising temperatures.\n\n155 RETHINKING THE IMPACT OF NIGERIAN CIVIL WAR ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nUgo-Paschal\n\n2017-02-02\n\nFeb 2, 2017 ... cooperation. ... this, the independence of 1960 further promoted integration and ...

Most incendiary and all biological agents are excluded. The described proposals appeared primarily in periodicals or letters to government officials on both sides. The weapons were usually meant to temporarily disable enemy combatants, but some might have been lethal, and Civil War caregivers were ill-prepared to deal with the weapons' effects. Evidently, none of the proposed weapons were used. In only one instance was use against civilians mentioned. Among the agents most commonly proposed were cayenne pepper or other plant-based irritants such as black pepper, snuff, mustard, and veratria. Other suggested agents included chloroform, chlorine, hydrogen cyanide, arsenic compounds, sulfur, and acids. Proponents usually suggested that the chemicals be included in explosive artillery projectiles. Less commonly proposed vehicles of delivery included fire engines, kites, and manned balloons. Some of the proposed weapons have modern counterparts.\n\nThe Lauramann Howe Russell Papers: a Window into Critical Care Medicine during the American Civil War.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGorbaty, Benjamin\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe Civil War influenced all aspects of American society and culture, including the field of medicine and critical care. Union physician Lauramann Howe Russell's letter to his daughter, Ellen Howe, written on October 19, 1862, illustrates the changes in hospital construction, gender roles in healthcare and medical treatments which revolutionized healthcare during the Civil War. This letter offers a glimpse of the medical care of wounded soldiers during the early years of the Civil War. In describing his conversion hospital, he reveals the precursor to the new hospital construction which would greatly influence hospital design for decades to come. His description of women volunteers hints at the evolving role and growing importance of women in healthcare. Finally, the advancements in surgical and medical practice which developed during the Civil War are embodied in Russell's descriptions of his patients. His letter freezes a moment in medical history, bridging the gap between archaic medical practice and modern critical care. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

According to UNICEF, almost 2 million children have died in the wars took place in the last 10 years. In this study, we aimed to evaluate demographical data and injury characteristics of Syrian children who were wounded in Syria Civil War and died while being treated in Turkey. Postmortem examination and autopsy reports of 985 forensic deaths from Hatay -a Syrian neighborhood city of Turkey-between January 2012 and August 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. Among 763 Syrian people who were wounded in the war and died while being treated in Turkey, 140 cases (18.3%) who were younger than 18 years of age were taken into the scope of this study. Among those cases 77.9% (nÂ =Â 109) were male and 22.1% were female. Median ages of female cases are 14 (min-max: 2-18) and median age of female cases are 9 (min-max: 1-18). Frequency distribution is highest between 13 and 18 years of age (n: 71, 50.7%). In 70% (n: 98) of cases, cause of death is bombing and shrapnel injuries, 13.6% (19) of them were killed by gunshot wounds. According to injury sites most of the injuries were reported to be on multiple body parts (54.3%, n: 76) and only head and neck injuries (%30). Cause of death was intracranial bleeding and cerebral parenchymal injury in most of the cases (n: 66, %47.1) followed by vascular damage with external bleeding (n: 15, %10.7) and internal organ damage with internal bleeding (n: 15, %10.7). The cases had very high level Abbreviated Injury Scales and Injury Severity Sores. In conclusion, a lot of children have died in the Civil War of Syria. Their average abbreviated injury scale and injury severity score values reported very high. Children that we evaluated were mostly died of head and neck injuries predominantly caused by bombing attacks and Autopsies of them revealed fatal intracranial hemorrhages and parenchymal injuries.

This study reports the surgical outcomes of this war, in a tertiary centre in Turkey. 159 patients with civilian war injuries in Syria who were admitted to the General Surgery Department in the Research and Training Hospital of the Medical School of Mustafa Kemal University, Hatay, Turkey, between 2011 and 2012 were analysed regarding the age, sex, injury type, history of previous surgery for the injury, types of abdominal injuries (solid or luminal organ), the status of isolated abdominal injuries or multiple injuries, mortality, length of hospital stay and injury severity scoring. The median age of the patients was 30.05 (18-66â years) years. Most of the injuries were gunshot wounds (99 of 116 patients, 85.3%). Primary and previously operated patients were transferred to our clinic in a median time of 6.28Â±4.44â h and 58.11Â±44.08â h, respectively. Most of the patients had intestinal injuries; although a limited number of patients with colorectal injuries were treated with primary repair, stoma was the major surgical option due to the gross peritoneal contamination secondary to prolonged transport time. Two women and 21 men died. The major cause of death was multiorgan failure secondary to sepsis (18 patients). In the case of civil war in the bordering countries, it is recommended that precautions are taken, such as transformation of nearby civilian hospitals into military ones and employment of experienced trauma surgeons in these hospitals to provide effective medical care. Damage control procedures can avoid fatalities especially before the lethal triad of physiological demise occurs. Rapid transport of the wounded to the nearest medical centre is the key point in countries neighbouring a civil war. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This article contributes to the crime-conflict nexus literature by providing a consideration of the role of organised crime in the Syrian conflict. It provides an overview of pre- and post-war organised crime in Syria. The article then builds the argument that war provides opportunities for organised crime through the stateâs diminished law enforcement ability; the economic hardship which civilians face during war; and the abundance of armed groups who all need to generate revenue. Secondly, the paper argues that organised crime also affects the intensity and duration of war by enabling militants to reproduce themselves materially and to build institutions amongst the communities where they are active. The relationships between armed groups and local populations emerge as a central theme in understanding the crime-conflict nexus.\n\nStasis and Bellum Civile\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nLange, Carsten Hjort\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDavid Armitageâs new monograph Civil Wars: A History in Ideas (2017) will undoubtedly long remain a standard reference work.
