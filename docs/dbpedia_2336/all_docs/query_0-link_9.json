        "text": "What if the Spanish guerrillas and anti-Napoleonic regular armies had managed to properly defeat the French incursion into their homeland before the Peninsular War could escalate into a protracted, attrition-based conflict? I'm looking for a PoD that sees the Spanish defeat Napoleon's late 1808 intervention in the invasion after the armies of Junot in Portugal and Dupont in Andalusia are embarrassingly defeated. Perhaps by having Joaquin Blake be appointed general-in-chief before the decisive Battle of Tudela?\n\nWhat are the overall effects on the ongoing Napoleonic Wars, with Nap so quickly defeated in Spain?\n\nCould this embolden the Prussian people into thinking they, too, can ward off Napoleon? IOTL, there was an armed uprising by a disgruntled Prussian officer apparently inspired by Spain's struggle named Ferdinand Von Schill that sprung in 1809, could something similar happen here, except with more success?\n\nCould a scenario like this lead to French defeat in the War of the Fifth Coalition? What happens to the Spanish colonies?\n\nPrior to the Battle of Tudela Spanish commanders Castaños and Palafox had a serious argument regarding the planning of the battle. Castaños purposed the Spanish Army to march across the Ebre and face the French in another pitch battle like that of Bailén, while Palafox purposed a retreat behind the Queiles and Ebro rivers. Finally Palafox agreed to meet with Castaños in Tudela and trying to pressure him to push back across the Ebro and defend Aragon, to which Castaños replied \"Spain! We have to defend Spain!\". The two commanders kept arguing and swearing at each other for the whole day until Lanne's artillery stopped their infighting on the 23.\n\nJudging from the disposition of troops and Blake's defeat at Pancorbo (more like rout), Palafox's planning was probably right. If the French were forced to push towards the Ebro with the Spanish armies forming a straight angle formation between the two rivers we could see the French massacred by artillery crossfire. Judging from the battles of Wagram and Berezina, we can conclude that Napoleon is not the best commander when attempting to cross a river, much less in such a position. So let's assume Napoleon tries to break the Spanish and fails. He would likely continue the attacks until succeeding, which Spanish relief troops could block, so the French army ends up badly damaged in northern Spain and possibly outflanked by guerrilla forces or even Blake's Army of the North. If the Spanish react quicckly, they may even try to surround the French (Castaños was still hoping for a crushing victory by trapping the French. As Palafox insisted him many times IOTL \"This is not Bailén!\"). The best conclussion for the Spanish would be a complete victory even greater than that of Bailén 4 months ago, with maybe Napoleon himself in Spanish hands, thou he would probably scape with some kind of wound.\n\nSpanish morale was already high before Tudela with most of the population burning in a desire to slaughter the invaders and avenge Spain with some cases of mothers pushing their kids into the melee of 2nd of May uprising saying \"Go, fight the invader and die for the fatherland, your mother will avenge you!\" (pretty much a romanticist wank, but Spain is a weird country). We could see the Spanish Army cross the Pyrenees in a lighting strike and pillage and burn everything on their way. The French, specially Napoleon would urge for a rematch after this and the war would become very nasty. If Palafox keeps his upper hand over Castaños, he could push back to the Pyrenees and block the French offensive again (Palafox was that kind of man, no surrender, not a step back, he was the hand behind the brutal Siege of Saragossa after all). If Napoleon is defeated again, his Empire could start collapsing, with the Prussians rising up against the French, Austria re-entering the war, and the British landing in Walcheren."
