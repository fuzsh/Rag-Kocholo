        "text": "Although obscure today, medieval Navarra (Nafarro) was a regional power which had significant influence on European history. The kingdom extended along both sides of the modern border, between France and Spain, encompassing the western Pyrenees. It was thus located east of Cantabria, west of Aragon, south of Aquitaine, and northeast of Madrid.\n\nAs with any ethnic group, there is controversy over nomenclature. The inhabitants are most commonly referred to as Basques, although this is a French transliteration of the Latin Vascones, since the Roman ‘V’ was pronounced like the English ‘Bwuh’. Unfortunately, aside from Greco-Roman sources, few written records survive from antiquity. We don’t know how pre-Roman Vascones described themselves or their homeland. Modern inhabitants use the term Euskaldunak (those who speak our language). Instead of Navarra, they utilize Euzkadi (place of the sun). Therefore, from a perspective of cultural sensitivity, it might seem respectful to use these words. However, from a historian’s perspective, these are relatively new phrases associated with the Nineteenth Century. Indeed, medieval Basques saw themselves as inhabitants of Vasconum, Vasconia, and Navarra."
