I´m also not going to be able to walk till June, so I prefer to stay north.\n\nOne option is the Ruta del Ebro, but I´m also thinking about the Vasco Interior.\n\nI know jpflavin and Anniethenurse have walked this way, so for you two and any others with an opinion -- why did you take the Santo Domingo route? Do you know anything about the Burgos alternative in terms of terrain, etc?\n\nBuen camino, Laurie\n\nM\n\nmikevasey\n\nGuest\n\nOct 10, 2014\n\n#2\n\nI do not know much about it Laurie , but stayed in Vitoria for two nights when I took some time out from my recent Camino, it was a very relaxed and scenic place. When I jumped on the train to go to Leon and start the Salvador I realised that the train was going some of the Vasco way,the countryside looked spectacular a mix of openness and mountains.\n\nanniethenurse\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Frances.Vasco del Interior.Camino Finisterre& Muxia.

Camino Portugues. Ruta del Ebro.\n\nOct 10, 2014\n\n#6\n\nTo be honest I did not know about the route to Burgos when I started walking from Hendaye on the Vasco.\n\nIt was my first camino less walked and did not know how I would manage walking alone. Joe and i walked the same first 4 etapas to the Tunnel and down from the mountain. So I just followed my guide book.\n\nI remember taking a little break near the sign where you have to make your choice and I continued to Sto Domingo followed my original plans and walked to SDC on the Frances. It is about 800 km and took me 29 days in rain, snow and thunderstorms. So no Burgos because I had neither guide nor maps and it was before I was online on the camino.\n\nI walked Camino Vasco during the Easter Week the first week in April so there were some local pilgrims walking for a day or two.\n\nSo if there will be another camino in the Pays Basque it wil be the Camino via de Bayona or parts of it.\n\nLast edited: Oct 11, 2014\n\nFatmaG\n\nActive Member\n\nOct 24, 2014\n\n#7\n\nHello Laurie,\n\nI did, indeed.\n\n(Sorry, I am not very present nowadays here - quite busy with plenty of things)\n\nI admit it was hard to chose which way. But as I was (it was in 2010) in my mind in \"alternative way of an alternative way\" (I did not only chose to go to Burgos, but as well I chose from Irun to Zegama the Camino not following the valley but climbing over the mountains), I finally decided to follow Burgos - also out of curiosity.\n\nI just had very few information about these alternatives. (a German guide book not updated) and a kind of brochure from the Bask Tourist board.\n\nAs many camino experiences seen with distance, I am quite happy to have done it.\n\nI can find back more details, if you want so.\n\nThe normal way (from Puebla de Arganzon) was 5 stages, I did it in 3 (not the best decision, especially for the last day - nearly 50 km till Burgos).\n\nThe way marking was not always easy to understand/follow - but I always found my way.\n\nThere was some walking along a national road (with plenty truck traffic) which I hate. (objectively spoken, I don't think, it was so much - but it upset me a lot at that time)\n\nSome great parts: approaching Pancorbo. Or following the Roman road before Burgos.\n\nVery friendly people everywhere. A superb little town, Briviesca.\n\nAnd every where an albergue (sometimes quite simple) to sleep.\n\njprogers\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances 2005\n\nPtgse 2007 Norte 2009 Ingles 2011\n\nVasco del 2013 Ourense to SdC 2016\n\nInvierno? 2020\n\nOct 25, 2014\n\n#8\n\nHi laurie\n\nWe walked to Santo Domingo instead of Burgos in June 2013 mainly because we were not well prepared for the Burgos path stages (ie no guidebook) and our Spanish is not good. I think it would have been really interesting to do that. However the way we took was interesting too and not very much road walking that I can remember. There are some spectacular views coming over the mountain into la Riojas region (and the stop at Brinas as recommended by the guide was great value). . The guide book said that particular mountain was to be hard but we found the gradient quite good ...steep coming down but ok really. And it was 33 degrees when we did that bit. The map shows some interesting province boundaries in that part of Spain. Vitoria is a great city. By luck we happened to be in Vitoria when there were celebrations for the 200 year anniversary of the \"Battle of Vitoria\" and the orchestra in the main square..played Beethovens \"Battle of vitoria\". Cheers Jill\n\nOct 25, 2014\n\n#9\n\nThanks to you both. I guess I will leave this up in the air for now. I need to hold off on my 2015 Camino planning because it is a source of great fun to me during the freezing dark and dismal winter days I usually get to enjoy. But... this seems like a great possibility, as does the Lana and the Ebro. Decisions, decisions. Many thanks for all the feedback, sounds like either way on this route would be very nice. I've never been to Vitoria, so that would be a treat, too.\n\nBuen Camino, Laurie\n\nCliff175\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nApril / May Camino Frances 2013\n\nPortuguese Camino May of 2014\n\nSt. jean to pomplona, - Santander to Oviedo, SAN Salvador to Leon , to Santiago in 2015\n\n2017 March -- VDLP Seville to Santiago\n\nNov 1, 2014\n\n#10\n\nI am planning on Walking the Via Bayona to Burgos. , jprogers and fatmaG mention a guide book.
