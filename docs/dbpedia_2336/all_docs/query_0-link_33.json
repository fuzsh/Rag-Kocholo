Incorporated into Navarre in 1029 after the death of King of Castile García Sanchez, Pancorbo was reincorporated into Castile in 1054, following the Battle of Atapuerca, by King Ferdinand I.\n\nReconquerred by Navarre in 1068, the village was eventually incorporated to Castile in 1076 by Alfonso VI. On 8 March 1147, Alfonso VII granted a charter to Pancorbo, confirming its status of realengo (Royal domain) and allowing a weekly market. Once capital of the Bureba region, Pancorbo declined in the 14th century when the capital was transferred to Briviesca. The village was eventually granted to the Burgos Council in 1379 by John I.\n\nThe St. Engracia fort of Pancorbo was built at the end of the 18th century, after Spain had declared war to the French Republic in 1793; the fort, protected by 173 cannons, could cater 600 horses and 10,000 soldiers. Decommissioned in 1796 following the Spanish-French alliance, the fort was seized in 1808 by the French troops, who eventually surrendered in June 1813.\n\nIvan Sache, 23 March 2011\n\nSymbols of Pancorbo\n\nThe flag and arms of Pancorbo are prescribed by a Decree adopted on 4 June 1999 by the Burgos Provincial Government, signed on 15 June 1999 by the President of the Government, and published on 25 June 1999 in the official gazette of Castilla y León, No. 121, p. 6,840 (text).\n\nThe symbols are described as follows:\n\nFlag: Tricolor. Red in the central stripe, 0.50; yellow in the upper stripe, 0.25; and white in the lower stripe, 0.25; or, gules, or and argent.
