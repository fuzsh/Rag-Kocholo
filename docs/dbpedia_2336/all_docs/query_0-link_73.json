Necessarily this condensed narrative is based on Napier, the historian of the War, and on the Wellington Despatches. Southey and other English writers have been consulted, and references will be found in the text to the Memoirs of French soldiers who served in the campaigns, and to the observations of the Emperor himself at St Helena. Perhaps I may add that I had the advantage of talking over some of those ' Operations of War ' with the late Sir Edward Hamley, though, as I must trust to memory for the recollection of the conversations, he is not to be held responsible for opinions expressed.

Students who follow them intelli- gently are absorbed even more in the results of well- devised strategy or prompt decisions than in the swift vicissitudes of thrilling episodes or eventful situations. Moreover, combinations and events are always at the mercy of Chance, and, as Napier says, in war Fortune will assert her supremacy. It is true that in the wars of the past the catastrophe is foreknown, which eliminates the elements of suspense and expectation. But, on the other hand, the subject has been flooded with light from a host of historians, military and civil ; history has been as thoroughly revised as can be reasonably expected, and we have the feeling that we are dealing with actual facts and not with probabilities or hazardous presumptions. There is a remarkable variety of interests attaching to the Peninsular War, and it must always have a special attraction for Englishmen. It was the turning point of the fortunes of Napoleon, and the conqueror of Europe took the first step towards political suicide when he rashly decided to pass the Pyrenees. Britain was supreme on the seas' Buonaparte had made himself master of the Continent. After the peace of Tilsit, it is impossible to surmise how the map of Europe might have been re-cast A 2 Introduction had he been satisfied to rest on the maxim, quieta non movere. But his ambition was boundless as his self- confidence was not unreasonably overweening. He could feel himself neither satisfied nor safe so long as England was prosperous and consequently formidable. While circumstances gave her the monopoly of commerce, she could subsidise his unwilling tributaries, and encourage them to fresh efforts for independence. The fighting which began at Vimeiro and ended at Waterloo was really a prolonged battle for markets. The insurrections in Spain and Portugal were merely episodes which influenced the direction and course of operations. The decree of Berlin, followed by the decree of Milan in December 1807, had declared England in a state of blockade. The immediate response was the Orders in Council. France and the countries dependent on her were to be blockaded in turn. All vessels trading be- tween hostile or neutral ports, or under such a certificate as was required by the decree of Berlin, were declared liable to seizure ; and neutral ships, bound to or from any hostile port, were required to touch and pay duties at some port in Great Britain. Then the combatants found themselves face to face. Buonaparte could close the northern harbours, though smugglers and receivers drove a thriving trade, but the prohibited goods were poured into the Peninsula through the free port of Gibraltar, and notably through Portugal ; in fact, Portugal, as historians of the time have defined it, was but an out- lying province of our own. Portuguese independence must be suppressed if the continental system was to be effectively carried out. Hence the secret treaty of Fontainebleau, which tempted its author to the invasion of Spain. We are far from asserting that our country, and even our Cabinets, were not actuated by nobler Introduction 3 and more generous motives. They sympathised warmly with the revolt of the Peninsular nations against un- provoked invasion and intolerable oppression. They were indignant at the arbitrary pressure put on their ally, the Regent of Portugal, and shocked by the treachery which, having secured the Spanish fortresses under the guise of friendship, had ensnared the whole of the royal family at Bayonne. But free commerce was the very life-blood of the British Isles, and when they embarked the first detachment of troops for the Peninsula, they committed themselves to a death-struggle from which the will and the victories of Wellington made it difficult and well-nigh impossible to draw back. Buonaparte's motives for the conquest of Portugal were clear, and had he been content to stop there his schemes might have been successful. But his aggression on Spain was so ill-timed and ill-advised that it is difficult to reconcile it with the far-sighted sagacity of his genius. His warmest admirers have sought in vain to explain his reasons or defend his policy. He appears to have been drawn on, step by step, to take resolutions from which he could not recede without compromising his prestige and his reputation for infallibility. Warning after warning came to him in vain, sign after sign was disregarded. S6gur marvels at the blindness which failed to foresee that the rising of the 2d of May in Madrid was the spark which could only be extinguished beneath the ruins of his crumbling empire. Escoiquiz, the able though servile envoy of Ferdinand and the Council of Castille, summoned courage at the last to speak out like a sage and a patriot. With rare prescience he described all the difficulties and troubles which would beset the invaders ; he predicted the consequences of the inevitable interposition of the English, although he could 4 Introduction not foretell that they would be commanded by Welling- ton. But when he spoke it was towards the eleventh hour, and the autocrat refused to listen. Already Joseph had peremptory orders to exchange the crown of Naples for that of Spain, though Joseph knew he was being sacrificed to his brother's ambition, and would have refused had he possessed the nerve and wealth of his brother, the Prince of Canino. Had his statecraft not failed him for once, Na- poleon might have governed Spain, for a time at least, through the Bourbons, leaving Charles or Ferdinand a shadowy supremacy. When they called him in to arbitrate in the scandals of the palace, they had abdicated all free will and placed themselves absolutely at his disposition. The Prince of Peace, the all-powerful favourite, trembling for the consequences of his con- tumacy before the battle of Jena, was his obsequious tool, ready to sell his master and the liberties of the nation. Doubtless the prudent course was Napoleon's first idea. But with more familiar knowledge his con- tempt had increased for the senile king and the hereditary prince. He saw that the courtiers and aristocracy were corrupt to the core ; that the ministers and place-hunters were venal as Godoy, and would have been as base had they enjoyed Godoy's opportunities. It seemed well to get rid altogether of a dynasty, who might easily be intimidated but were never to be trusted. And it would be as gratifying to his ambition as to his pride to succeed where Louis the Grand had failed, to efface the Pyrenees and to annex another kingdom for the aggrandisement of the Buonapartes. He reckoned without the Spanish nation, and, strange to say, he seems to have taken slight account of the remarkable defensible capabilities of the country. He Introduction 5 told the Abb6 de Pradt that he would never undertake the venture, were it likely to cost him 80,000 men ; but that even if all Spain were to rise, the insurrection could be suppressed at a sacrifice of 12,000 soldiers. The Spaniards of the lower orders were ignorant and indolent, but they were warlike, careless of life, passionate for their independence, and vindictive as orientals. Sober and frugal, they could sustain long fasts and endure extreme privations. In their climate, through great part of the year, the shelter of a roof was matter of indifference. Living far away from the corruption of the Court, their loyalty was a deep traditional sentiment, unshaken by centuries of gross misgovernment. In short, the Spanish people were still of the same stuff which had recruited the armies of Cortez and Alva : and if anything was likely to fire their pride, it was insolent aggression by their formid- able neighbours. That Spain was an agglomeration of semi-independent kingdoms was a source at once of weakness and of .strength. The jealousies were detrimental to any broad scheme of regular warfare ; but, on the other hand, in a guerilla insurrection, the Peninsula was like a steamship built in compartments. One province might be swamped by the rush of invasion, but the next, behind its mountain barriers, was comparatively indifferent. The patriotism was provincial, not national. As for those barriers, the successive ridges of parallel sierras, traversed by few and difficult roads ; the rivers, rarely bridged and seldom fordable in flood ; the gorges through which those roads are carried, were so many fastnesses or almost impregnable lines of defence, assuming that they were held by resolute men. Nor were the cities, as a rule, less defensible, thought except on the northern frontiers, or on the borders of Portugal, few were regularly fortified. The stubborn, 6 Introduction resistance of Zaragoza through the siege showed what effective use might be made of the flat-roofed palaces and massive convents, mutually supporting each other, and only to be taken by sap or storm. The plazas were so many rallying centres, where troops could bivouac or deploy, and which, by simply barricading the issues, could be turned into entrenched camps. In Portugal, a small and narrow country, the isolated risings could be speedily crushed by rapid concentration. In Spain, which could only be comparatively weakly occupied, there were vast distances to be traversed from the several head- quarters, over barren mountains and inhospitable plains. The Juntas had leisure to drill their levies, or they could rally the fugitives after defeat in dehesas and depoblados, heaths and wastes, which were practically inaccessible. The first invasion, undertaken to escort Joseph to his capital, was planned on the assumption of the acquiescence of the nation, or at least in the belief that the French need deal with nothing more serious than local ^meutes, which could be easily put down. Napoleon relied with reason on the superiority of disciplined troops, under veteran leaders, over raw levies wretchedly commanded. Never- theless he knew that his own forces were chiefly composed of conscripts who fell easy victims to disease, or of foreigners pressed into the ranks and always ready to desert. His grand plans were worthy of his genius ; but he had reckoned without the Spanish temperament, and had forgotten to count with the chapter of accidents. His generals would seldom act in concert, and his first and best combinations were baffled by the unexpected disaster of Baylen. The usurper fled from his capital to the Ebro ; the army of invasion was standing on the defence ; the Emperor's schemes were to be entirely remodelled, Introduction 7 and the occupation was to be recommenced more methodic- ally and on an infinitely more formidable scale. That brings us to the point where the English ministers decided to assume the offensive on land. It was no light undertaking, nor is it wonderful that the Cabinet had hesitated. The difficulties were great and the cir- cumstances discouraging. The Emperor had put forth stupendous efforts. The numerical superiority of the French was overwhelming, for Portuguese and Spaniards were an undrilled rabble. Theirs was no longer an army of conscripts. Eighty thousand veterans, habitu- ated to victory, had been drawn from Germany, cele- brating the victories to come in a triumphal progress through France. In 1808 the conscription of 18 10 had been already anticipated, so behind these were practically inexhaustible reserves. The advance was securely based on the northern fortresses, where the magazines were being filled to repletion. Eight corps darm^e, each com- plete in its several parts, were under the command of eight distinguished generals ; above all, the Emperor was at headquarters in person, to overrule their rivalries and repair their mistakes. The French generals had been schooled in war ; their soldiers were flushed with conquest. The English Army was under a cloud since the treaty of Utrecht ; ill- planned expeditions, often under incompetent chiefs, had damaged its reputation ; the nation, ever susceptible to moods and fancies, had almost been brought to doubt its fighting qualities. There were no leaders who loomed large in the public eye like the French marshals, and the hero of Assaye, of subordinate rank, was slightingly spoken of as the Sepoy General. There was no master mind at the War Office or the Horse Guards — no organised plan. The contingents were at first sent out in driblets. As CHAPTER I INVASION OF PORTUGAL AND REVOLT OF MADRID, November 1806 — May 1808 We retrace our steps to give a summary of the events that led immediately to the great war. Effect had to be given in the Peninsula to the oppressive Berlin decree, and it was followed up by the treaty of Fontainebleau. The Spanish Court, submissive to servility, had invited the interposition of Napoleon in domestic affairs. There was a shameful unveiling of the scandalous secrets of the palace. The Prince of the Asturias had been charged with conspiring against the lives of his royal parents. His mother regarded him with undisguised malignity, and Godoy, the Prime Minister and all-powerful favourite, was his bitter enemy. Professing to believe his life in danger, as indeed it probably was, he appealed to Napoleon for protection. On his side, Godoy, Prince of the Peace, was eager now to make any terms with the French Emperor. By summoning the Spaniards to arms on the Prussian declaration of war, he had provoked an enemy apt to be implacable, and feared he had sinned beyond forgiveness. To be restored to favour, to secure his personal safety and have his ill-gotten fortune guaranteed, he was willing to consent to any sacrifice. Napoleon welcomed the opportunity of interposing as mediator, for it precisely forwarded his views. With that high-handed and flagitious treaty he began his course of spoliation and treachery. That it deprived the House of 9 lo Invasion of Portugal and Braganza of its ancestral dominions might be fair enough, for undoubtedly had the Regent of Portugal been free from French menaces and pressure he would have cast in his lot unreservedly with the English. But the Queen of Etruria, daughter of the Spanish King, was arbitrarily expelled from the Tuscan territory with her infant son, being promised compensation in Northern Portugal. As to the semi-tropical province of Algarve in the south, that was to be erected into a principality for Godoy. As Napoleon robbed the Tuscan Queen, so from the first he meant to befool his obsequious Spanish tool. It is as clear that Godoy was effectually deceived as that the autocrat had no intention of fulfilling his promises. With the promptitude to which he had hitherto owed his successes, the Emperor lost no time in carrying out his decision. Nine days before the treaty was signed the French had passed the frontier on their march to Lisbon. The command was confided to Junot — to console him for the loss of his position on the Imperial staff — a general as audacious as he was ambitious ; easily elated by the victories he was swift to follow up, and capable of admirable strategical combinations. But, as subsequent events were to show, he was depressed and paralysed by adverse circumstances. His march, after receiving his orders to leave Salamanca, was a brilliant military achievement. In a month to a day after leaving Bayonne his advance guard had entered Portugal. Over miserable roads, in late autumn and early winter, he pressed forward without giving his forces breathing time. If there was a certain number of seasoned soldiers, for the most part they were conscripts. Proclamations with fair promises were scattered broadcast, but the assurances were belied by pillage and rapine. The guns were brought forward, but the commissariat train fell Revolt of Madrid 1 1 behind, and the army supported itself precariously by living on the inhabitants. The natives who offered desultory resistance were easily disposed of, but fatigue and hunger had done their work, and the general struggled into the capital at the head of 2000 footsore and famished veterans, with their cartouche boxes in many cases as empty as their bellies. It was a rash venture, but he had a great prize in view. It was known that the royal family contemplated flight to their colony of Brazil : the object of the forced marches was to secure their persons, or at all events the treasure with which their vessels were to be freighted. In that latter purpose Junot partially succeeded, but he had the mortification of barely being in time to see the leading ships of the squadron standing across the bar of the Tagus. There was an English squadron off the mouth of the river, the city was filled with an excited population lamenting the departure of the Royal House, and there was a consider- able number of regular troops under arms. The people of Lisbon have been blamed for not rising on the French and annihilating the stragglers, as they might easily have done. But the accusation is unfair. Behind that feeble and exhausted advance guard was the whole strength of Napoleon's veteran hosts, with the terrible prestige of the conqueror who had never yet succumbed to defeat. So the Three Uhlans captured Rheims, because they repre- sented the armies of United Germany. Junot took advantage of the panic and surprise to occupy the posts of strength and make menacing dis- positions. As his regiments straggled in his position was assured. Possibly, had he possessed the humanity and self-restraint of his subordinate, Travot — almost a singular exception to the truculence of his confreres I — Junot might have reduced the Portuguese to acquiescence and 1 2 Invasion of Portugal and obedience. The French were present in irresistible force ; the Portuguese had no faith in effective succour from England, and the Spaniards were under the French colours as allies. Mild and generous government would have paid in every sense. Napoleon had chosen well when he sent that dashing leader to annex, but the choice proved singularly unfortunate when Junot came to administer. He carried the system of governing by terror — of making serfs instead of subjects of subjugated nations — to excess. He was the plunderer par excellence among predatory generals, compelled by their imperious master to live up to their opportunities, and almost con- strained to enrich themselves by pillage. Junot was resentfully denounced by the exile of St Helena, in the memoirs dictated to Las Casas, as ' a monster of rapacity.' The proof is that when he embarked after the Conven- tion of Cintra, he asked for five ships to carry his per- sonal baggage, and had actually emptied the stables of the Prince Regent of Portugal. His subordinates, detached in command of districts, emulously followed his example. The soldiers, in their degree, imitated their superiors. What with public contributions, private exactions, outrages on property, insults to women, and, above all, by the sacrileges which scandalised the pious and alienated the priests, the Portuguese passed from despondency into desperation, and were driven by despair into open insurrection. Isolated outbreaks might have been easily suppressed, and the reign of terror effectually established, had not the conflagration suddenly broken out in Spain. In Spain the policy of Napoleon in a very few months had turned a nation of cordial allies into deadly enemies. The warlike Spaniards had followed with admiration the achievements of the great captain. Among the more Revolt of Madrid 13 intelligent his name had become a household word, like that of the Cid. They sympathised in his hatred of the English. The occupation of Gibraltar was a perpetual outrage on the national pride, and more recent offence had been given by the questionable capture of their frigates. When Junot was sent on his mission of annexa- tion, considerable Spanish forces were engaged as his auxiliaries, and were well content to march under the tricolor. But in the early days of 1808 the nation began to take alarm. Under pretext of supporting the army of Portugal a stream of regiments continued to turn the western Pyrenees, and troops were even poured into Catalonia, remote as that province was from the scene of operations. A scheme, perfect from the military point of view, had been devised as a preliminary, by which the fortresses, which were the keys of Northern Spain, were to be transferred to French hands by infamous treachery. The commandants were generally patriotic, and their suspicions had been excited. But the orders of the Prime Minister were peremptory. The French were to be received everywhere as friends, and everything was to be done to gratify their wishes. At Pamplona, the strong capital of mountainous Navarre, the French by a trick were actually smuggled into the fortress in numbers sufficient to overpower the garrison. At Barcelona, Alvarez, who commanded in the almost impregnable fort of Monjuich, built originally to dominate the city, was a man of courage and determination, and would have taken measures to baffle the plot he had penetrated. But he knew that he would assuredly be disavowed by Godoy, and that successful resistance would have involved his disgrace, and probably be punished by death, unless he were prepared to break out in rebellion. Before the end of January the seizure of that northern chain of 1 4 Invasion of Portugal and strong places had given the invaders a secure base of operations, and the Pyrenees were lost as a line of defence. In February Napoleon could venture to throw off the mask with a demand for Spanish territory in exchange for compensation in Portugal. The violent ^meute of Aranjuez precipitated events. By his greed, his infamous morals and the influence he had vilely abused, Godoy had long been justly odious. To a great extent he had been hoodwinked by Napoleon's professions, but now he was generally accused of venal treason and the popular indignation was not to be controlled. The Court had prepared to leave Aranjuez for Seville ; it was believed that they meant to follow the example of the Braganza family, and, without the excuse of submitting to irresistible force, desert their subjects in this crisis of their fate. For Seville was on the road to Cadiz, whence they could embark for Vera Cruz. The mob burst into the precincts of the palace, cut the traces of the mule teams, and refused to let the sovereigns go. Nevertheless the veneration for the throne was profound ; it still respected degraded royalty, but the pent-up indignation vented itself on the Minister. Dragged from his hiding-place by the people, he was rescued by the royal guards. He found temporary safety in ignominious hiding; he was afterwards escorted out of the country under protection of the French, whose policy was never to abandon an instrument. But irre- trievably discredited, he had become useless for their purposes. Having no longer a supple agent at his ser- vice, who controlled the Court and governed the State, it was then that Napoleon took the fatal resolution of securing all the Bourbon family by threats or guile. Nothing was to be apprehended, in the meantime, from the impotent Charles who had abdicated in favour Revolt of Madrid 1 5 of his son. It was true that Ferdinand had been the first to appeal to Napoleon ; but now he represented the principle of royalty, already he was doubtless re- ceiving assurances of loyal devotion, for the execrated favourite had been his bitter enemy, and his temper might have changed with the altered circumstances. He had been proclaimed king. He was at Madrid, where the Council of Castille was sitting as the Central Junta, and it was impossible to tell what mischief might be brewing. Prompt action was necessary, and Murat was ordered to occupy the capital in force. The riots of Aranjuez accelerated his movements. He made his public entry on the 23d March, accompanied by Savary, Duke of Rovigo, perhaps the ablest and least scrupulous of the Emperor's counsellors. Beauharnais was already in residence as imperial envoy. Ten thou- sand soldiers were introduced into the city ; the rest of the army was encamped outside. Clouds of cavalry swept the surrounding country, cutting off all communi- cations with the provinces, and a detachment was sent forward to Aranjuez. As Junot had been an un- fortunate choice to effect the subjugation of Portugal, so Murat was the worst possible selection to carry out the crafty instructions of his master. Napoleon had no wish to precipitate matters. Already he had evi- dently come to realise that he was treading the crust of a volcano. In a remarkable despatch, he orders his impetuous brother-in-law to treat the Spaniards with consideration and leniency, ' so that they may not suspect the course I intend to pursue.' All manner of civility was to be shown to the old King, the Queen and Godoy ; above all. Napoleon was not to be committed to granting Ferdinand an interview within Spain. He added this prophetic warning, ' If war once MAP TO mUSTRATB THE CAMPAIGN IN PORTUGAL i:n August 1808. Revolt of Madrid 17 break out all is lost' But Murat was not the man to temporise. He believed in military force, and he was irritated by the sullen bearing of the citizens and their ill-devised attempts at futile resistance. Possessing the real power, absolutely controlling the situation, he put himself ostentatiously forward, in place of using Spanish statesmen as a screen. He was indiscreet enough to have himself elected a member of the Central Junta, thereby accepting gratuitous responsibility for the unpopular measures he meant to inspire. But perhaps still more significant of the diplomacy of the tactless and head- strong sabreur was his urging the surrender of the sword of Francis I., treasured as a national heirloom in memory of the victory of Pavia, for it was an idle provocation to Spanish vanity. At that time Murat had no fears for the future. His despatches are full of jubilant self-confidence ; but the unfortunate Ferdinand was in extreme perturbation. He had made his entry into the capital, and his re- ception by the people had been all he could desire. He came prepared to play the humiliating role of toadying the civil and military French chiefs, but his flatteries were wasted. The French Ambassador paid him no royal honours. Murat, when questioned, de- clared he could take no steps in the matter till he received further instructions. Nevertheless, both Beau- harnais and Savary were lavish of civilities in private. They posed as the friendly advisers of the young King, and their kindly advice was invariably the same — that he should seek an immediate interview with the Emperor. Then all would be well, and the Emperor would come to Burgos to meet him. Distracted between hopes and fears, Ferdinand was terrorised into his fatal decision, and on the nth April he set out for Burgos. At his B 1 8 Invasion of Portugal and own earnest request, Savary was the companion of his journey. The part assigned to the Duke, and he played it excellently, was to lull the victim into false security. Reaching Burgos, Ferdinand's fears got the upper hand, on learning that the Emperor was still at Bayonne. When he was reluctantly induced to proceed to Vittoria, it was too late to turn back. His Spanish counsellors, whose eyes were opened at last, tried hard to persuade him. As previously at Aranjuez, the popu- lace rose and cut the traces of the carriage. But S6gur, who was there and pitied him, and who unhesitatingly condemns the conduct of his master, explains how, in obedience to orders, the French had closed in behind him, preventing a retreat. Yet it is possible that even then he might have been suffered to pass back, in fear of the grave responsibility of a public scandal. But Savary, always at his elbow, felt it was no time for scruples. He solemnly pledged his personal honour to a safe-conduct. Whatever the result of an interview, which could not fail to be satisfactory, whether as King or Prince he should be received as an honoured guest — be free, at his pleasure, to return as he had come. Ferdin- and's eyes were finally opened to the fact of his captivity by the slights which he met with after cross- ing the Bidassoa. Betrayed and outraged, the prisoner proved less complaisant than the tyrant had hoped. Consequently orders were sent to Murat to transport the old King, the Queen and Godoy forthwith to Bayonne. The scenes that ensued in the stormy family meetings, where Napoleon sat as arbiter, were so scandalous as to appear almost incredible. It is said that the Queen, in a tempest of passion, told Ferdinand, in presence of her husband and the Emperor, that he was no son of Charles. The upshot was that Charles Revolt of Madrid 19 surrendered his crown into the hands of the Emperor, which was followed next day by the formal abdication of Ferdinand. As it had been determined that the Bourbons were to be deposed and interned in France, it became im- perative to secure all the members of the family. The Infante Carlos, next brother to Ferdinand, had preceded him to Bayonne. Fresh instructions had been sent to Murat, ordering him to forward the Queen of Etruria and her children, with Don Francisco, a boy of fourteen, the youngest son of Charles. They were under Murat's hand, for they were occupying the palace at Madrid. On the memorable 2nd of May, the travelling carriages drew up at the palace doors. The French have been falsely accused of provoking the troubles, as a pretext for making a bloody example, probably because they had made no adequate military preparations. The charge is false on the face of it, for they had left their hospitals unguarded. A great crowd had gathered on the spacious plateau before the palace. When they saw the weeping Queen and her children come forth, with the young Prince who was the sole remaining hope of the kingdom, then grief turned to frenzied indignation. The knives which all the Madrilenos of the lower orders carry flashed out ; the escort was overpowered in a simultaneous rush, and again the traces of the carriages were cut. The mob surged down into the city ; the insurrection spread through the crowded quarters ; the foreign garrison was taken unawares ; stragglers and detached parties were massacred, and the sick in the hospitals were ruthlessly butchered. The fiery Spaniards had been wrought up to frenzy, but never was revolt more insane. The French closed in on the city with guns and cavalry, and though the resistance was desperate, it was soon over. The 20 Invasion of Portugal slaughter was great, though it has been probably ex- aggerated, and next day there were summary executions of prisoners who were court-martialled and condemned on slight evidence. Napoleon's presage was to be ful- filled, for war had broken out. One of the immediate consequences was that Charles's brother, Don Antonio, who had hitherto presided over the Council of Castille, resolved to depart for Bayonne to share the fortunes of his family. Remonstrances were unavailing. Doubtless he felt that as prince and patriot his position had become intolerable, since a river of blood had flowed between his countrymen and the foreign invaders. CHAPTER II THE RISING IN SPAIN : THE CAPITULATION OF BAYLEN May— July, 1808 The trouble in Madrid precipitated the impending insurrection. The Spaniards had been already irritated by the betrayal of the royal family and the treacherous occupation of the fortresses. Friendship had changed to mistrust, and mistrust had given place to patriotic indig- nation. The Spanish blood was heated to fever point, and the fire broke out in a general conflagration. At first it was essentially a popular movement. The nobles and those who had anything to lose were naturally dis- inclined to risk everything in a cause which they con- sidered doubtful, if not desperate. The most experienced among their inexperienced generals realised the military strength of the French and were anxious to repress popular demonstrations. Some, like Cuesta, though sin- cerely patriotic, exerted themselves to avert a movement which seemed destined to be stifled in blood. Others who, like Solano, were suspected of truckling to the invaders, of being faint-hearted or lukewarm, fell victims to the popular fury. The flames of patriotism were fanned by truculent demagogues, and a reign of terror was established, to which the national leaders had to bow. Yet many prominent men were tempted to canvas for office by the prospects of pay, patronage and popu- larity ; the more cautious or far-sighted, who would gladly 2 2 The Rising in Spain have held back, were constrained to come forward under penalty of proscription. On the whole, the Juntas, which were formed every where, werecomposed of local notorieties. But the civilians with any knowledge of affairs were mere clerks or bureaucrats, and few of the soldiers had seen war. Nor either then or afterwards could there be unity of action. Spain is still an agglomeration of independent kingdoms. The Asturian has nothing in common with the Andalusian, and even near neighbours like the Ara- gonese and Catalans, separated only by the wall of the Sierras, cherish the memories of ancient feuds. To such an extent was local jealousy carried, that the Juntas of districts in the same province were often at dagger's drawn. No province would share ^foreign supplies or re- mittances with the next ; one army could never be relied upon to support another, and so a common scheme of operations was impracticable, even had there been a strategist capable of conceiving and directing it. On the other hand, although the French were com- paratively few in the first invasion, and for the most part raw levies, they were directed by the genius that, with what seemed superhuman prescience, foresaw and pro- vided for every contingency. Had Savary carried out Napoleon's ideas, and struck effectually before the revolt had gathered head, the result might have been very different. The plan was simple. Bayonne and Per- pignan were the bases of operation in France. The passes through the Pyrenees into Navarre and Aragon were relatively unimportant The line through Vittoria and Burgos, where there were to be great magazines and strong reserves, must be kept open at any cost, as on the eastern side Barcelona was of supreme import- ance. The Catalonian capital was the centre of a rugged country, teeming with a warlike peasantry, and could The Rising in Spain 2 3 communicate by sea with the English in Sicily and the Balearic Isles. But Madrid was to be the centre and pivot of operations. Thence corps were to be detached, in various directions, which should menace important cities in the south and sever the communications between the provinces. They should have been disposed so as to render mutual support and to crush any hostile efforts within their spheres by sudden converging movements. But Savary let his forces get out of hand and showed himself incapable of appreciating or adhering to the plan so ably traced out. Not one of the generals but was guilty of blundering, except Bessi^res, who took matters into his own hands and acted in the north-west with skill and energy. At the first outbreak he effectually scattered the forces opposed to him, but he had afterwards to face a more formidable combination. Cuesta, routed by him before, had assembled a second army, and was joined at Benevente by Blake with the levies raised in Gallicia. Of the two, Blake was the better general. But Cuesta's obstinacy was as great as his undeniable courage ; his seniority gave him a certain authority, and he was at the head of by far the larger contingent. Though weak in the cavalry arm, in which the French were always strong, he determined on advancing towards the plains of Castille and again offering battle. Bessieres, on his part, combined prudence with daring. He gradu- ally strengthened his force by withdrawing garrisons, though even then it barely numbered 15,000, and he waited to bring up some heavy guns. The Spaniards, who offered battle in a strong position, with 25,000 regulars and a mob of about 17,000 ill-armed peasants, were scattered with great slaughter. The killed and wounded amounted to 6000, and there were many prisoners. The Spaniards are said to have fought well, 24 The Rising in Spain yet the French reports returned only 50 killed. The loss of material of war was serious, for Cuesta had carried fatuity so far as to form his magazines in the plains instead of in the mountains. It is significant of the state of discipline among the patriots that Blake's strategy is supposed to have been influenced by the fact that his soldiers had just murdered their former leader, Filangieri. The importance of the seasonable victory could scarcely be overrated. It removed all danger from the French communications, leaving the road to Madrid open to Joseph, and it crushed the patriots of the north- western provinces who had taken the lead in the war of liberation. Zaragoza was only second in strategic importance to Barcelona. There, three out of the four routes from France to Madrid converged; separated from a suburb by the Ebro, which was navigable for gunboats, it was a centre for operations on either bank. It had been entered but immediately evacuated, as there was no citadel to overawe the city ; nor did the invaders desire needlessly to excite alarm by leaving an adequate garrison. They would have acted differently had they foreseen the future. Now General Lefebre-Desnouettes was detached from Pamplona to take possession. With 4000 men he forced the passage of the Ebro, as cruelly as impolitically shot the leaders he had made prisoners, dispersed 10,000 of the Spaniards who barred his way, and delivered an assault on a city with 50,000 inhabitants. It is asserted that had he followed up his first advantage he might have taken the place when the defenders were panic- stricken. Palafox, who has been exalted into the hero of the siege, had left by one gate — to seek for succour, as he said — as the French were forcing another. But it must be allowed that, according to the rules of war, and The Rising in Spain 25 looking at things by the light of subsequent events, Lefebre-Desnouettes would have been severely blamed for a disaster. Retiring after his first partial success, he fell back upon the siege in form, which was not raised till after the French reverses and retreat. In Catalonia, General Duhesme was in possession of Barcelona. He also held Figueras. But he had com- mitted the palpable and strange mistake of neglecting to secure the intervening fortresses of Gerona and Hostalrich, which effectually closed the high road from Perpignan. His tardy attempts to retrieve the error were unfortunate. The first assault on Gerona failed, chiefly owing to the shortness of the scaling ladders. The result of the second siege was still more mortifying. The French, advancing from Figueras on the one side, and from Barcelona on the other, found themselves severed from their respective bases by irregulars swarm- ing down from the mountain spurs and forming behind the rugged banks of the Llobregat, and by the fire of the British warships blockading Barcelona. The dashing though rash action of the Count Caldagues at the head of a relieving force had better fortune than it deserved, and Duhesme was driven to a hasty retreat, in which he abandoned his artillery and munitions. In Valencia, the veteran Marshal Moncey had no better luck, though he was guilty of nothing worse than an error in judg- ment. Considering his numerical weakness, it was no discredit to be repulsed from a city containing 80,000 people ; nor was it a necessary part of the plan that he should occupy it. But he seems to have believed that it had been sold to him by traitors within the walls, and that no serious opposition would be offered. Moreover, the Valencians were the reverse of the Catalans, for the Spanish proverb says the men are women and the 26 Capitulation of Baylen women nothing. Moncey withdrew in perfect order, and his corps again occupied the position assigned to it. But the coming calamity, which was to counterbalance Bessi^res' victory of Rio Seco, was Dupont's humiliating surrender at Baylen. When that general was ordered to occupy Andalusia, no serious opposition was anticipated. He passed the Sierra Morena, to find all the conditions changed. A patriotic junta at Seville had proclaimed war against France. He could no longer count on the Spanish and Swiss veterans assembled in the camp at San Roque as allies; on the contrary, Castanos who commanded, was in friendly communication with the English in Gibraltar. All Andalusia was up in arms, and, finally, the supports he expected from Portugal were returning to Lisbon. Probably Junot was by no means eager to assist him. Nevertheless he crossed the Guadal- quivir, routed as usual the undisciplined Spaniards who opposed him when he recrossed the river at Alcolea, defeated them again at Cordova, stormed the city and sacked it. The fugitives spread consternation in Seville. Castanos who had come up from San Roque and been appointed captain-general, was already embarking his artillery and stores with the intention of descending the river to Cadiz, and had Dupont followed up his success, Seville must have surrendered. He can hardly be blamed for not doing so, as he was in ignorance of the state of affairs. But he hesitatingly chose the middle course, which, notwithstanding the proverb, is often the most dangerous ; a good general of division, he was an execrable commander. He wrote urgently to Savary for reinforcements, and irresolutely loitered away ten precious days in Cordova. Then he decided to withdraw to Andujar, relieving by his retreat the apprehensions of Capitulation of Baylen 27 the Spaniards. Having once fallen back, it is incompre- hensible that he did not retire to Baylen, where he would have had his back to the ridges of the Sierra, and kept open the pass of Despenas Perros, through which he would receive the succours and supplies from La Mancha. In place of that he remained for a month at Andujar, leaving the enemy ample room to manoeuvre between his headquarters and his supports under General Vedel. That was precisely what the Spaniards did, when he had given them leisure to recover themselves and organise. Meantime his young soldiers, inactive and disheartened, were rapidly filling the hospitals. The enemy was closing around him, and then at the eleventh hour he resolved on further retreat. The march was disorderly, and the men were demoralised. He was taken between two fires, and at last he was forced into action. Seldom has a battle been fought under more singular conditions. He was attacked in the front by Castanos, in the rear by Reding, and Reding was interposed between him and Vedel, who had been marching aimlessly backwards and forwards. The comedy of strategical blunders ended in favour of the Spaniards. A comedy of blunders it was, for Dupont carefully made his dispositions to be beaten in detail ; the Spanish generals were too chivalrous to take advantage of his error, and Castanos, whose wish had been to fall back upon Cadiz, was spurred on to the battle and the victory by the civilian junta of Seville, profoundly ignorant of war. When his ammunition was exhausted and his troops were without food, Dupont was reluctantly persuaded to a capitulation. When the pen was in his hand, he had nearly thrown it down at the sound of the guns of Vedel, who was in full tide of success. Indeed, there is little doubt that had Vedel pursued his advantage he might have cut a way for his 28 Capitulation of Baylen chief through the obstructing forces. But the capitulation was so complete that it embraced not only the victorious division of Vedel, but the scattered supports in La Carolina and the villages of La Mancha. It has been said that Vedel should have repudiated it and saved his division, and indeed he hesitated ; but that would have been a rash course to adopt, for the Spaniards had threatened to massacre their prisoners in the event of the surrender not being according to stipulations, and in their temper there can be little question they would have kept their word. On their side they had conceded terms to the vanquished which the generals must have known they were powerless to keep, and they not only laid them- selves open to the reproach of treachery, but the soldiers covered themselves with disgrace by their atrocious brutality to the prisoners. It was the only victory won even nominally by the Spaniards in the war, and it was won chiefly by the Swiss mercenaries and the Walloons. By the irony of fate the battle was fought the very day on which Joseph entered Madrid in triumph, and on which Napoleon left Bayonne for Paris, expressing his conviction that the rebellion was stamped out. The news of Baylen, magnified by the national boasting and magnil6quence, put heart into the insurgents all over the country, yet it may be questioned whether it was of advantage to the cause in the end. For by inflating Spanish vanity and overweening self-confidence, it led to the most culpable neglect and temporarily crushing disasters. Meanwhile, when the intelligence reached King Joseph several days after it was common talk among the patriots, it decided him hastily to abandon the capital which he had entered in triumph ten days before. CHAPTER III ROLigA, VIMEIRO AND THE CONVENTJON OF CINTRA July, August, 1808 In the summer of 1808 the relations of Spain and Britain were peculiar. War had never been proclaimed, yet a state of hostilities existed. In the spring the Asturian deputies had been cordially welcomed ; assistance was promptly and liberally offered. Yet General Spenser was at sea with 5000 men intended for the capture of Ceuta on the Morocco coast. As has been said. Sir Hew Dalrymple, the Governor of Gibraltar, was on the most friendly terms with Castanos, actually supplying him with 2000 barrels of powder. Castanos had in- vited Spenser to disembark his forces at Cadiz, but the Junta under Morla were opposed to the measure, and ministers at home, from political considerations, hesitated to sanction our active interference in Andalusia. In the meantime, they contented themselves with sending agents to the Spani.sh juntas — the precursors of our present- day Intelligence Department — and they responded freely to even unreasonable appeals for money, arms and cloth- ing. The national feeling was running high then, and there was no surer road to popularity than supporting the Spanish revolt against Napoleon. The inevitable farther step was to render armed assistance. The revolt had altered circumstances to our advantage. The defection of the Spaniards under Junot's command had gravely compromised his position. Those in the north of Portu- 29 30 Rolifa, Vimeiro gal had retired across the frontier, after disarming their French comrades ; those in the south had been disarmed themselves, and the Frenchmen were mounting guard over them. The north, with Oporto for its centre and the bellicose bishop for its chief, was in open insurrection ; and the Portuguese, like the Asturians, were asking for aid. The opportunity seemed favourable, and it was decided to despatch an expedition. The chief of the English Cabinet was a mere figure-head, but Canning was Foreign Minister and Castlereagh Secretary-at-War. The former had a generous sympathy with Portuguese and Spaniards, and Castlereagh, although essentially an aristocrat, detesting and dreading measures originating with the democracy, was inveterately opposed to Napoleon's ambition. Unfortunately those brilliant statesmen may be said to have been personal enemies, which must go far to account for conflicting plans, diverg- ing counsels, the multiplication of envoys constantly at cross purposes, and the supersession of commanders in the hour of crisis. The English forces available for service were estimated at 80,000. It seemed obvious that anything effectual could only be achieved by con- centration, yet they were gratuitously squandered all over Europe. We had troops in Sicily; we sent Sir John Moore to place himself at the disposition of the insane King of Sweden. Spenser, with another contin- gent, went cruising in the Mediterranean, and finally mismanagement was to culminate in the disastrous Walcheren expedition, when the soldiers died like flies in the pestilential swamps of Zealand. After many delays, and with no little difficulty, 9000 men were embarked at Cork for the grand Peninsular ven- ture, which, with a force so manifestly inadequate, seemed a doubtful leap in the dark. For even then, Rolifa, Vimeiro 31 including those under Junot, there were 100,000 P'rench in the Peninsula, and behind them were all the legions of the Grand Army, from which they were to be rein- forced in the following year by 300,000 seasoned soldiers. Nor could anyone have realised then that the Titanic struggle between Britain's sea power and Napoleon's veterans was to be decided by the choice of the com- mander of that insignificant advance guard. Notwith- standing the distinction the General of Sepoys had won at Seringapatam and Assaye, he owed his appoint- ment chiefly to family influence, for his brother. Lord Wellesley, believed in him, and had much weight with the Cabinet. And a weaker man might well have re- signed, after the fashion in which he was treated by ministers, and the indifference with which they received his appeals. Sir Arthur left the fleet and sailed with Mr Stewart, the British envoy, in a swift frigate to Corunna. The Gallician Junta gave him no encouragement to land his troops there. They were urgent, as usual, for money and supplies, but declared that the patriots only needed equipments. They gave glowing reports of the strength and spirit of the Oporto insurgents, and, desirous to get rid of him, advised him to co-operate with them. At that time our generals were still in the dark as to the reliance to be placed on Peninsular assurances. The Bishop of Oporto had confirmed the Gallician reports by asking equipments for 40,000 infantry and 5000 cavalry, pledging his word that the English auxiliaries should be fed and supplied with ox-teams for the artillery and commissariat. Yet the mendacious pre- late had barely 5000 tatterdemalions under his orders ; and when the English general claimed fulfilment of his 32 Rolipa, Vimeiro pledges, neither food nor the draught animals were forthcoming. Ministers in England had formed no definite plan. Sir Arthur had, in fact, the responsibility of a roving commission, yet his discretion was limited, for the admiral had authority to control the land service. He might go to Cadiz if he pleased, but that idea was promptly dismissed, for political and other reasons. Ministers had suggested a landing at Lisbon. But it was clearly impracticable to force the Tagus, with a hostile Russian squadron lying in the river, and then to disembark under the fire of the batteries. Peniche was the only safe harbour to the north of Lisbon in that rock-bound and weather-beaten coast, but the anchorage was commanded by a fort, and the fort was strongly garrisoned. The next best alternative was landing in the estuary of the Mondego River, and, fortunately, the fort at the mouth had fallen shortly before to the dashing enterprise of some Portuguese students, and was now held by our marines. The landing commenced on the 1st August, but it was not completed till the 5th. A sudden gale would have brought the expedition to ship- wreck, but the weather was favourable, and by a happy chance General Spenser arrived at that critical moment. Thus the force at Sir Arthur's disposal was raised to 12,000 men, for a part of General Spenser's detach- ment was destined for Gibraltar. Even so, the enter- prise seemed daring to desperation : he had thrown himself into a country unknown to him and devastated by the invaders ; communication with the fleet was de- pendent on the weather, and possibly even Sir Arthur might have hesitated had he realised how delusive were the assurances of his Portuguese allies. He must feel his way with extreme circumspection, for he was lament- Roliga, Vhneiro 33 ably deficient in cavalry, and the few horses on board had suffered greatly from sea-sickness. Junot, on his side, was seriously embarrassed. His troops were dispersed or shut up in garrisons. Having passed from extreme self-confidence to depression, he exaggerated the strength of the patriots, but he knew that Lisbon was ready to rise ; that insurgents from Algarve were mustering on the south of the Tagus, waiting to answer a summons from the citizens. More- over, he had heard of the disasters in Andalusia. His dispositions have been blamed by capable critics ; it has been said that, scattering his forces, he had left them exposed to be beaten in detail, but it is hard to see how he could have acted differently. He promptly recalled Loison from Almeida, and Loison pressed forward with such forced marches that he was compelled to halt for two days in Leiria to get his men in fighting condition. The advance of the English had to be observed and obstructed, and Laborde, who handled an inadequate force with equal skill and courage, was detached for that purpose. Having taken every precaution for the security of Lisbon, Junot followed himself with two or three thousand men — all that could be spared to form the reserves. Even had Napoleon been in command, he must have assumed that the English would, in common prudence, act en masse and cling to the seaboard. Understanding the situation and the value of time, Sir Arthur pressed onwards rapidly, and Laborde was compelled to dispute the passage with his very inferior numbers. Had he marched eastward to join hands with Loison, or fallen back upon Junot and the reserves, the direct road to Lisbon would have been left unguarded. The first encounter of the hostile nations was at Roli9a, C 34 Rolipa, Vimeiro where he made the most of an exceptionally strong position, withdrawing in excellent order after a pro- tracted and bloody combat. Having disputed each inch of ground, and leaving three of his guns behind him, he made a night march to gain Montechique on the south-east, and thus the road leading to Torres Vedras was left open to the victors. The road to Torres Vedras was open, and Sir Arthur prepared to follow up his success. He had resolved to press the beaten army and prevent its rallying. Rolica had been decided in the afternoon of the 17th August. News had come that Loison was within five miles of his left flank, but he believed that, having rallied the troops of Laborde, the united forces would fall back upon Monte- chique and Junot. On the i8th he meant to march to Torres Vedras, the centre of the foremost of the moun- tain barriers crossing the peninsula formed by the sea and the Tagus, and situated on the road leading straight to Lisbon. Circumstances induced him to change his intention before nightfall. He learned that a fleet with reinforcements had arrived, and he resolved to see to their landing at the adjacent Bay of Maceira. The landing was safely effected, and on the i8th the English advanced to Lourinham by the more circuitous coast road, for Junot, who realised the importance of the commanding position which was the key to operations, had had time to win the race. Crossing the line of Laborde's retreat, having picked up Loison's corps on the way, he occupied Torres Vedras late on the same day. But Sir Arthur had a second plan in reserve, characterised by his habitual celerity of movement. It was to turn the position of Torres Vedras, so formidable that it could hardly be assailed from the front : to throw forward a strong ad- vance guard to Mafra, and, occupying the intervening Rolifa, Vimeiro 35 heights with his main body, to menace the French flank and the line of march to Montechique. Unfortunately at that critical moment came a frigate with Sir Henry Burrard. The victor of Roliga went on board to com- municate with his new superior, who was necessarily ignorant of everything. Before leaving the Mondego, Wellington had written to Sir Henry, recommending that Sir John Moore, who was expected with the army he had saved from Sweden, should land there, and that he should operate independently on the northern bank of the Upper Tagus. Thence he could cut the communi- cations between Lisbon and Almeida, and threaten the line of Junot's march, should that general retreat to Spain by way of Elvas. Burrard disapproved. Moore was off the coast, and should be directed to disembark at Maceira. Meanwhile the army must remain on the defensive in the positions it occupied, with Vimeiro for the pivot. But it was Junot's intent to force the fighting, and he was determined to bring on the inevitable battle. De- cisive it must be in any case. If the British were beaten, they must re-embark under the onslaughts of a triumphant enemy, with no such anchorage as Corunna, and no armed works to cover their escape. On the contrary, if the day went against Junot, there was nothing for him but capitu- lation or evacuation of the country. The British occupied positions on heights that were more or less commanding, and the precipitous mountain covering the left flank was further protected by a deep ravine, invisible to the enemy, which played an important part in the subsequent en- gagement. Junot had made a night march, intending to attack at daybreak, and the strength of his position at Torres Vedras is shown by the fact that the narrow defile by which any attack must have been delivered in his 36 Roliga, Vimeiro centre had delayed his advance for several hours. The combatants were not unequally matched in point of numbers, though the English had somewhat the superi- ority. But, on the other hand, whereas all the French were brought into action, but a part of the British were actively engaged. Junot showed great personal courage, but his dispositions were faulty. He formed up in two columns of attack, in place of concentrating his attack upon our left Sir Arthur had been halted in a situa- tion where he had never intended to offer battle. For several hours the road of retreat to Lourinham was inevitably left unguarded. Had Junot occupied it with the bulk of the French, the English must have been forced back upon the sea. As it was, his right column of attack, coming on the ravine that formed the ditch of the pre- cipitous mountain, gave the English time to strengthen the defence, and it was ultimately repulsed with heavy loss, leaving several guns behind. But the serious fighting was in the centre, and very desperate it was. The French scaled the heights, sweeping the English skirmishers before them, to face a crushing artillery fire, followed up by headlong bayonet charges. Driven down far faster than they had climbed, they rallied and returned gallantly to the attack. The copses, vineyards and ravines were filled with the dead and wounded. Guns were taken, retaken, and taken again. Finally Sir Arthur learned, to his relief, from the questioning of a general taken prisoner, that the enemy had brought his last man into action. Junot, on his side, realised that his attempt had failed ; but though his troops were beaten, they were, scarcely dis- organised, or, at least, they rallied at once under the pro- tection of the guns and cavalry. Moreover, the able and prudent dispositions of Kellerman, who commanded the reserves, induced Sir Arthur, dashing as he was, to decline Roliga, Vimeiro 37 to listen to heated advisers, who urged him to strike again and without an hour's delay. Yet it was his full intention to follow up his victory. It was barely noon, and the day was before him. But three of his eight brigades had borne the brunt of the battle ; the others had either suffered slightly or not been engaged at all. His original superiority in numbers had been considerably increased, and his scheme was to turn Junot upon either flank, forcing him back from Torres Vedras on the Tagus, and cutting him off from Lisbon. That it would have driven the French general to a more hurried and disastrous retreat than that of Sir John Moore can scarcely be doubted, the rather that he seems to have done nothing to guard his left and observe the coast road, which, turning the lofty Torres Vedras range, would have led the English to those natural lines of defence in his rear which stretched from Mafra to Montechique. But responsi- bility had devolved upon Burrard, and having generously left Wellesley all the credit of winning Vimeiro, now he rightly assumed the direction. It is needless to enter into the considerations which induced him to disapprove the pro posed strategy ; suffice it to say that they are admitted to have been weighty and were approved by the experienced officers of his staff. Yet he would have adopted Sir Arthur's proposals, though with hesitation, and when it was comparatively too late ; but by this time a third com- mander-in-chief had appeared on the scene. Sir Hew Dalrymple was an able general, if he had not the genius of Wellesley ; he had done much to foment the insurrec- tion in Andalusia and to equip Castafios for the victory of Baylen. But being profoundly ignorant of the position in Portugal, he had to wait to be instructed by his prede- cessors in command. Meantime Kellerman appeared at the outposts, under a flag of truce, with propositions from 38 The Convention of Cintra Junot. The result was the Convention — miscalled — of Cintra, for it was really arranged and signed at Torres Vedras. Briefly, the French army capitulated. It was to evacuate Portugal with the honours of war. It was to be transported to France in English shipping, with no restrictions as to serving again. The article by which the French were permitted to carry away their personal effects gave rise to serious trouble and many misunderstandings. Unquestionably it was grossly abused, and the pillagers secured the bulk of their plunder. But, in the circum- stances, exhaustive search was impracticable ; the tension in Lisbon was becoming unendurable ; and it was of para- mount importance to get rid of the still formidable in- vaders on any reasonable terms. The convention was virulently abused both in Portugal and England. The Portuguese authorities, who had done nothing for their auxiliaries except draw upon their stores and decline to act with them, indignantly protested that they had not been consulted. The populace of the capital complained, with better reason, that their oppressors had been let off too easily with their booty. And in England the malice of party, acting upon popular misapprehensions and irra- tional annoyance, secured the appointment of a parlia- mentary committee to investigate all the circumstances. Dalrymple, Burrard and Wellesley were summoned home to give evidence, or, in other words, to defend themselves ; the army was deprived of its chiefs ; Portugal, when seeth- ing with disturbances from one end to the other, lost the benefit of their local knowledge and experience. Yet the misfortune might have been greater had not the arrival of Moore placed a capable general in supreme command. As for the maligned convention, it was as cordially approved by Sir Arthur Wellesley as by Sir Hew Dal- rymple. Both from a military and political point of view. The Convention of Cintra 39 the gains were immense. Portugal was relieved from the firm hold of a formidable army, still strongly secured in a military sense. Not only the capital with its forts, but the frontier fortresses of Elvas and Almeida, facing Badajoz and Ciudad Rodrigo, were given over without bloodshed, and instead of Junot withdrawing to reinforce his compatriots in Spain, and transfer his energies to the ill-defended Andalusian, he was sent out of the way of doing immediate mischief Several thousand Spanish prisoners, confined in hulks on the Tagus, were set at liberty, and given a free passage to Spain, and, more- over, there was a surrender of the Russian squadron in the river, to be held in deposit till the conclusion of a peace. The moral effect both in Spain and Portugal was incalculable. Following Baylen, it gave another blow to the prestige of Napoleon and his hitherto invincible armies, and the effect throughout the Peninsula was the greater, that the Portuguese were pleased to claim no little of the credit. CHAPTER IV MOORE'S ADVANCE — HIS RETREAT AND THE BATTLE OF CORUNNA September iSo8 — January 1809 After the battle of Baylen, and the abandonment of the capital by the usurper, the Spaniards had a great opportunity, for there were no French to the south of the Ebro. It is needless to say that they did not avail themselves of it. There was energy or rather excitement enough, but the innumerable local juntas were acting independently of each other, and often at open enmity. It would be tedious to trace the history of these miserable squabbles, nor is it necessary. The upshot was that it became evident, even to the jealous Council of Seville, which would gladly have usurped supreme authority, that something in the nature of a parliament must be assembled, which might exercise some authority over the nation. Yet it was chiefly owing to the persistent representations of the British agents that a central junta was assembled at Madrid, composed of thirty-five members from the provinces. A very mixed assemblage it was, compris- ing patriots of spotless reputation, such as Florida-Blanca, the superannuated president, and some men of notoriously infamous character, like the envoys sent up by Seville. The practical wisdom of the proceedings is illustrated 40 Moore's Advance 41 by the proposal that they should raise half-a-million of infantry forthwith, besides 50,000 cavalry. Had the men been forthcoming, and probably there were never more than a foyrth of that number in the field, they had neither arms nor ammunition, nor clothing, and for filling the military chest they must trust to English liberality, Spaniard-like, while broaching these mag- nificent schemes, they did not make the most modest attempts at organisation. Throughout the course of the protracted war there never was any regular com- missariat, which explains why the armies of undisciplined men, though individually brave and animated by fervid detestation of the French, often were scattered from sheer starvation. The levies were unclad in the bitter winter cold, and had to go unshod in the snows unless they found themselves in sandals. A Carnot with a free hand would have been invaluable at Madrid, but there was neither organiser, general nor statesman. Sir John Moore and the British envoys lost no oppor- tunity of urging the necessity of appointing a general- in-chief The junta admitted the propriety of the measure, but could never come to a decision. Blake, like Cuesta, was discredited by defeat, yet the choice lay between Cuesta and Castanos. Cuesta, though the old man's indomitable courage won the affection of his soldiers, was arbitrary, impracticable, and what may be called cross-grained. He brooked no crossing of his will, and to offer a suggestion went far towards having it rejected. At that time he had outraged the dignity of the junta by the illegal arrest of one of its most honoured members, and he was not only under a cloud, but had been ordered into a kind of honourable captivity. Castaiios might possibly have obtained the post, and he had the advantage, although some con- 42 Moore^s Advance sidered it an objection, of being personally acceptable to the British. But he was unambitious and indolent, although it was taking a step in the right direction when he was gazetted Captain-General of Madrid. Meantime the Junta indulged in endless talk, issued inflated proclamations, and gave orders which were generally ignored. Each local leader did what seemed right in his own eyes, when he did not take instructions from his soldiers under pain of summary execution. And Napoleon, drawing veterans and even some of the Old Guard from Germany, was preparing to send 200,000 soldiers over the Pyrenees to reinforce the French already in Spain. The conscription of two years in advance, as we said, had been anticipated — evidence sufficient of his fixity of purpose — and Champigny, who conducted foreign affairs, had avowed in State papers that State policy was synonymous with justice, and that the end justified the means. But at that juncture, by an excellently-planned coup, Spain recovered some efficient defenders. According to Napoleon's system, when professing himself her ally he had drained her of the flower of the army to fight his battles elsewhere. One body was in Tuscany under O'Farrel, and there were 14,000 good soldiers in Denmark commanded by the Marquis of Romana. Thanks to British initiative and by the interposition of venturesome agents, the bulk of Romana's corps was embarked on British ships and transported from the Danish islands to the harbours of Gallicia. They were destined to co-operate with a Gallician force which was to make an effective diversion and to give the Spaniards fresh breathing time if they cared to avail themselves of it. The English Government had finally decided to follow up Vimeiro and the convention by an advance Moore s Advance 43 into Spain. Nor did the enterprise appear anything but hopeful. It is evident that they persistently under- rated the strength Napoleon could bring to bear, and, misled by the optimism of their subordinate agents, they still put faith in Spanish statistics and promises. On the 6th October a momentous despatch was received at Lisbon. It appointed Moore to the command of a nominal force of 30,000 infantry and 5000 cavalry. Ten thousand were to be sent from England, under Sir David Baird ; the rest, it was assumed, might be drawn from the depleted army in Portugal. In what manner Moore was to enter Spain was left to his own judg- ment. He might take the army by sea to the northern ports, or march through the interior. The former plan would effect an immediate junction with Baird's contin- gent, nevertheless he elected for the latter, chiefly because Sir Hew Dalrymple had already made some arrangements for a march on Almeida. Moore's hopes were never high, as were those of the Ministry ; as a soldier, he had a more lively appreciation of the French power, nor did he put implicit faith in the reports of the patriots. Still these reports were so circumstantial as to the support he would receive that he could not refuse them a certain cre- dence. At all events, his instructions were peremptory — the difficulty was to decide on the method of the advance. Wellesley had been guided by excellent maps when marching in the Torres Vedras peninsula, but north- east of the Tagus the country was virtually a terra incognita. All reports agreed that the roads over the mountains to Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo were im- practicable for artillery. As it proved, these reports were fallacious, but they induced Moore reluctantly to violate a fundamental rule of war, and, separating from his heavier guns and cavalry, send them by a southerly 44 Moore s Advance route, under Sir John Hope to Talavera. Thence, crossing the Guadarama, they were to meet him at Salamanca. He found the roads practicable for guns, but the difficulties otherwise had not been exaggerated. Though the army marched in three columns, it was hard to find means of bare subsistence ; the baggage had been cut down to a point engendering the discontent which afterwards culminated in mutinous indiscipline, yet it was impossible to procure sufficient transport animals. As Moore wrote bitterly, ' The army runs the risk of finding itself in front of the enemy with no more ammunition than the men carry in their pouches.' Everything had to be paid for in a friendly country, but the military chest was so low that it was with the utmost difficulty that ;^8ooo could be spared to Baird, who had landed pen- niless. By the way, he was detained on the transports for a full fortnight till the formalities insisted upon by our allies could be fulfilled. Yet when the British generals were in such dire financial straits, two millions of dollars were being landed at Corunna, consigned to the Gallician Junta. They were brought by Mr Frere, who had arrived with the fleet which disembarked Romana and his men. Mr Frere came to supersede Mr Stewart as plenipotentiary. He was a brilliant man of letters, the early friend of Canning, the admired familiar of Scott and Southey, yet the selection was unfortunate. Emo- tional, romantic and unpractical, he lost credit as a diplomatist ; his despatches on Peninsular affairs fostered the illusions of his superiors at home, and impractic- able suggestions in intemperate language aggravated the embarrassments of Moore when he had to come to prompt and critical decisions. But the advance of the army was happily timed, for it arrested the French in full swing of victory, and deranged Moore's Advance 45 the far-sighted calculations of the Emperor. Had he only had the Spaniards to deal with, the country would have been rapidly overrun, although the irrepressible guerrilla warfare would have gone on smouldering every- where. All along the line, from Biscay to the Catalonian coast, discipline and skilful combinations — notwithstand- ing some slight and trivial successes of the patriots — had triumphed over ignorant rashness and unregulated valour. Joseph's defence had been almost as feeble and ill-advised as the Spanish attack, but all changed when Napoleon in person came on the scene. His generals forgot their jealousies under the master's immediate eye. Eight corps were actively employed in concert. The battles of Espinosa and Gamonal, in which Blake again illustrated his incapacity, subjugated the north of Spain, and assured the French communications with Bayonne, while Burgos, in place of Vittoria, became the centre of offensive opera- tions. Thence the powerful cavalry could sweep the plains of Castille, driving back the broken bands of the patriots upon the mountains. Then Marshal Lannes inflicted a crushing defeat on the army of the Spanish centre at Tudela on the Ebro. He surprised it when the leaders were clamouring in discordant councils, much like the Covenanters at Bothwell Bridge. Castafios had been checked and overruled by the incompetent and vain- glorious Palafox. The rout was complete, yet the disaster would have been greater had not Ney been in one of the occasional fits of lethargy which sometimes palsied the indomitable energy that covered the retreat from Moscow. Castafios saved a portion of his troops, and a still more important result was that 15,000 of the fugitives under Palafox found their way to Zaragoza. Assuming that the news of his success would induce the English to retreat, Napoleon detached Lannes to 46 Moore's Retreat follow up Palafox and summon Zaragoza, while he him- self hurried forward to occupy the capital. The pivot of operations was to be advanced from Burgos to Madrid, for political as much as for military reasons. The short road lay over the Somosierra Pass, a formidable position at all seasons, virtually impregnable in the winter if re- solutely defended. And the Spaniards for once had made due preparation. The gorge and its surroundings were held by General St Juan with 12,000 men, a battery of sixteen pieces swept the precipitous ascent, and the more open ground, above and behind, was raked by the cross fire from redoubts and entrenchments. According to all principles of war, to assail the pass was to invite disaster. The French column of attack was flanked and preceded by skirmishers on either side; it was received with a warm, running fire of musketry, and the battery of guns was there in readiness to pour showers of grape on the head of the column. Napoleon rode up to survey the situation. At that moment his sight was obscured by a dense fog, thickened by the powder smoke hanging over the guns. He had one of those rare and original inspira- tions, which only come to leaders like himself and Wellington. He ordered his Polish lancers to take the battery. The gallant Poles charged up the pass, and the leading squadron went down almost to a man. They broke, fell back, rallied and charged again under cover of the fog and smoke. The gunners were slaughtered, the guns were seized, and in another moment the Spaniards were in headlong flight, throwing away their arms and abandoning their baggage. The French cavalry followed fast in pursuit : the bulk of the runaways fled to Talavera, and there they celebrated their safety by murdering their general. In six weeks Napoleon had scattered the Spanish armies. The stroke of brilliant audacity opened the way Moore s Retreat 47 to Madrid, and in a few days the French cavalry were before the capital. There was a fierce attack on the suburbs, and Napoleon menaced the city with a bombard- ment. But he had no mind to destroy his brother's capital, if indeed he did not for a time entertain the idea of superseding Joseph and administering Spain as a de- epndency of France. He still hoped that by an affectation of mildness he might induce the panic-stricken people to accept his supremacy. Threats were judiciously blended with promises, and the negotiations were not suffered to drag. Madrid was surrendered by the double-minded Morla and his vacillating colleagues. Doubtless Morla had already resolved to play the traitor ; but indeed the mis- cellaneous inhabitants of La Corte were not of the stuff to make determined resistance. The regular troops and the patriotic irregulars had time to withdraw, and on the 4th December the Emperor made his entry, to find him- self in undisputed possession. Whether the Spaniards gave him further trouble or no, he had assembled an imposing force to overawe the country. His corps darm^e, operating in concert, had each its allotted work. But his plans were upset by Moore and Zaragoza. He learned to his disappointment that Moore, in place of falling back on the report of his victories, was advancing on Salamanca and threatening his communications. Therefore, instead of prosecuting his designs on the south, he directed every available man against the British, and hurried westward himself to direct the movements in person. That Moore did not lack audacity, as his disparagers averred, is evident. Had the Spaniards arrested the progress of Napoleon, had they even avoided crushing defeat, he was prepared to detach himself from his base at Lisbon and throw himself into the heart of Spain. As it was, the advance from Salamanca towards Sahagun was 48 Moore's Retreat daring enough, for it must draw upon him all the available French forces. But his courage was largely tempered by prudence, and when his allies failed him in every respect, though his purpose was partially achieved, retreat could only be a question of time, routes and celerity. His des- pondency as to great results was too well grounded. Napoleon, with far superior strength, followed him up as far as Astorga. There the Emperor handed over the pursuit to Soult, chiefly because he was preoccupied by the intelligence from Austria, partly, perhaps, because he was disinclined to be present at a possible reverse in the passes of Gallicia. Moore's retreat was conducted under no ordinary difficulties. Some of the superior officers were disaffected and almost mutinous ; the rank and file were discontented when ordered to turn their backs on the enemy. There were no sufficient magazines to fall back upon. Unlike the Frenchman, who is a disciplined marauder, the English, when reduced to forage for them- selves, broke loose from discipline and refused to obey. The peasants drove their cattle to the hills, and the pinch of hunger became daily more severe. The wine vaults in the towns were an irresistible temptation. Villa Franca was found to be full of the rabble that was the bulk of Romana's broken army, though Moore had begged the Spaniard to avoid his line of march. Yet still, when danger pressed, the troops showed a bold front. The pursuers had a serious check at Benevente ; and at Lugo, having rallied the army on the heights, for two days Moore vainly offered battle. When the precipitate retreat was resumed, it degenerated into something like flight from sheer scarcity of food. When they entered the higher mountains, in the depth of a bitter winter, the men were thoroughly demoralised. The absurd provi- sions of the service had cumbered them with women and The Battle of Corunna 49 children. The transport animals gave out, and could not be replaced. Guns and ammunition waggons were abandoned ; barrels of dollars were broached and the contents started down the precipices, tempting the soldiers to fill their pockets and sacrifice their lives. All the time Soult warily followed, pressing hard on the retreat, but avoiding fighting. Moore had nothing to gain by insisting on a battle, since victory could have gained him nothing but a brief delay. Between Lugo and Betanzos disorder had come to a head, and the losses were great. After leaving the former town in a blinding tempest of rain and sleet, the landmarks were obscured, the guides lost their way, and two of the three divisions strayed from the main road. Many of the numerous stragglers never rejoined the ranks, and when the main body found shelter in Betanzos, it arrived in utter confusion. There Moore halted for a day, and when the march was resumed it was soldierlike and orderly. There were 14,000 infantry with the colours when the head of the column looked down upon Corunna. The general anxiously gazed out to sea, but no fleet was to be seen in the roadstead or the offing. Adverse winds had delayed the ships which were to come round from Vigo. That Soult would seize his last chance of strik- ing was certain, and all preparations were made for repelling the attack. Had the British force been suf- ficient, it might have occupied positions almost impreg- nable in the semi-circular heights enclosing the rocky arena in which the battle was to be fought. As it was, that advantage had to be abandoned to the French, and on these heights they formed the batteries which raked the plain with the lower eminences on which our battalions were posted. In men, guns and cavalry, and notably in the two latter arms, the French marshal D 5o The Battle of Corunna had an overwhelming superiority. Before the battle was engaged he had brought 20,000 combatants into line, and to face the fire of his heavy guns we had only a few light field-pieces. For when the fleet had at last come into the bay, the bulk of our artillery was embarked with the best of the few serviceable horses. On the other hand, thanks to Spanish negligence, our men had an unex- pected stroke of good fortune. The muskets, battered and rusted on the march, were replaced with new pieces found in the arsenal, and there was an ample sapply of the ammunition which happily was failing with- the enemy. At two in the afternoon of the i6th, Soult ordered a simultaneous advance. Moore's dispositions were imperatively dictated by the nature of the ground. The infantry was solidly aligned in a front stretching from Elvina on the right to the bank of the Mezo river. But Baird at Elvina was raked by the great battery on the ridge to his right front, and further to his right the French cavalry was out-flanking him. However, the horsemen, who could scarcely act on such ground, were also held in check by Eraser's division and Paget's reserve. Between Baird and the Mezo was Hope's divi- sion. The fighting was fiercest at Elvina, and there our losses were most severe. But at nightfall the doubtful contest there had been decided in our favour, though the gallant leader of the division had been seriously wounded. The attacks of the other French columns had equally failed. Foy on their right made but feeble resistance when Hope assumed the offensive, and on their left our skirmishers, followed closely by supports, were actually threatening to take in reverse the formid- able battery on the hill. The victory nobly retrieved the reputation of the army, somewhat imperilled by the disorders of the hurried The Battle of Corunna 5 1 retreat. But it was dearly bought by the death of Moore, struck from his horse by a cannon shot when watching the fight at Elvina. He was buried by torchlight in a bastion of the citadel, and the volley over the grave was fired by the guns of the enemy. The command devolved on Sir John Hope, who, resisting the temptation to com- plete Soult's discomfiture, wisely turned his attention at once to the embarkation. Ere daybreak two of the divi- sions were on board, while the third, which held the citadel and c xrried the operations on, quietly embarked in course of the afternoon. Up to a certain point it seems that Moore's general- ship was irreproachable. He could hardly have formed magazines on his line of retreat, from the difficulty of filling them. Yet, had his temperament been sanguine, the upshot might have been very different. In place of writing to Cradock for empty transports, he would rather have pressed for reinforcements. The victors of Corunna would have won a more decisive battle, and hurled Soult back into the Gallician defiles. With supplies pouring into Corunna and Ferrol from the sea, we should have held another position like Torres Vedras, and escaped a tem- porary eclipse of prestige and false imputations of timid faithlessness. But no soldier could have desired a nobler death than that of Moore, and his chivalrous opponent did him ample justice. Almost simultaneously with the battle of Corunna, nominal hostilities ceased between Britain and Spain, and a formal treaty of alliance was concluded with the Supreme Junta. CHAPTER V THE SIEGE OF ZARAGOZA AND AFFAIRS IN PORTUGAL December 1808 — May 1809 The heroic and obstinate defence of Zaragoza was the second obstacle which upset the French plans. Fifteen thousand fugitives from Tudela had sought refuge there, and had the victory been promptly followed up, possibly the place would have fallen. As it was, the reduction of that bulwark of the east was an object of supreme importance. Monccy began the siege operations, to be replaced by Mortier, who resigned the command to Junot finally superseded in turn by Lannes. On the 20th December the French began to close in. It was no light task they had undertaken. Thirty-five thousatTd men, exposed to incessant alarms from irregulars swarming in the mountains, were to contain a garrison half as numer- ous again and to storm a city exceptionallydefensible. The defence of Zaragoza continually reminds us of the siege of Jerusalem by Vespasian. There were the fanatics excited by the monks, corresponding to the Zealots. There were the armed peasants from the hills, answering to the Idum- eans of John of Gischala. There were the regular soldiers under Palafox and St Marc, and there were the citizens who fought manfully for their homes, but who were, nevertheless terrorised by their more desperate comrades. There were the same feats of reckless courage, similar ferocity, and the same indescribable horrors. Patriotism inspired the defence, but it was patriotism under a reign 52 The Siege of Zaragoza 53 of terror. St Marc was an excellent general,and St Genis an engineer of rarely adaptive genius. But it was monks of the lowest orders — men of the people — who coerced the constituted authorities, and directed the resistance. The French were in front and there were gibbets behind, daily garnished with fresh batches of suspects. For the faintest breath of suspicion was a death sentence, and the timid found it safer to fight than to flinch. The city was girdled on one side by the Ebro, and guarded on the other by ancient walls. But its real strength was in the massive solidity of its buildings, and in the stupendous convents and public edifices, which seemed to have been constructed with a view to this crisis. It would speedily have succumbed to the tremendous bom- bardment had it not been virtually fire-proof, and almost bomb-proof. Massive blocks of buildings were divided by broad thoroughfares, and each of these was raked by batteries. All the outer doors and lower windows of the houses were built up, the walls were loopholed and the roofs barricaded. So the siege resolved itself into a struggle of the engineers, and the Spaniards had found a Cohorn to confront the French Vauban. The talents of Lacoste had- been appreciated by Napoleon, but perhaps St Genis, a Zaragozan by birth, showed the higher qualities of inventive genius. For he adapted his plans to his means, and regulated his operations by circumstances. It was a dramatic climax to the protracted struggle in which they played the leading parts, that those great engineers fell almost simultaneously. Palafox has had the chief honours of the defence ; yet there are few characters in history as to whom we are more puzzled. Both French and English authorities are in absolute antagonism. Some present him as the chivalrous hero, others as a mere puppet and a cowardly sensualist. 54 The Siege of Zaragoza He is praised by the Frenchman Lejeune, and bitterly censured by Napier. Of course the truth lies between these extremes. Like all the chief Spanish commanders he was no general ; and his feebler will bent to the ferocious energy of Tio Gorge, and the fanatics who were the elect of the dregs of the populace. St Marc was the soul of the strategy and St Genis inspired the engineering. Yet had Palafox not been a patriot and a man of courage, he must have lost his place and probably his life. The weather fought at first against the Zaragozans. They had reckoned upon the winter frost and cold to carry death into the French lines. As it happened, the winter was one of the mildest on record, and the muggy fogs rising each morning from the river valley masked the operations of the sappers. So the siege they had hoped would have been raised went on, but the prolonged resistance had a double effect. On the one hand, like the victory of Baylen, it flattered the national vanity as it kept up the national spirit, and encouraged in England a delusive faith in Spanish determination. But calmer reflection led to depressing conclusions. Zaragoza and Gerona, which behaved almost more heroically, proved to be altogether exceptional instances. No serious efforts were made to succour either city, though each night the French were kept on the alert when they saw from their leaguer the signal bonfires blazing along the uplands. The trenches had been pushed forward ; the attack- ing columns had been alternately successful and repulsed ; all the outlying positions had been carried with the great convent of St Joseph, which projected from the walls like a Titanic bastion. On the loth of January the bombardment began, to go on uninterruptedly to the end. On the 23d Lannes took over the command, communicating his own fiery energy to the operations. The Siege of Zaragoza 55 After a contest for every foot of ground, the assailants mastered the ramparts, making them their first line of defence, yet even then their troubles were only beginning. Each house, with the ingress blocked, the stairs de- stroyed, and its own store of hand grenades and ammu- nition, had become a separate fortress. They were the flanking works of the convent"
