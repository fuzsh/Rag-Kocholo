Rap star Jay-Z announced yesterday (Thurs., Dec. 8) that he will perform two shows at New York’s Carnegie Hall in February to benefit the Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation and the United Way of New York City.

“Education is super important.” Jay-Z said. “For me to articulate, I had to have some form of schooling to articulate my thoughts.”

The concerts will take place on Feb. 6 and Feb. 7. Tickets in the private sale will range from $500 to $2500.

The Brooklyn-born performer said he’s excited to influence his community in ways outside of music.
