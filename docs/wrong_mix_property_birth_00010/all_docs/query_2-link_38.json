        "text": "The Carters are making their support for HBCUs loud and clear.\n\nFollowing the recent release of Beyoncé’s “Homecoming” documentary on Netflix, which served as a tribute to historically black colleges and universities, JAY-Z’s Shawn Carter Foundation has announced its plans to partner with Toyota for its annual black college bus tour.\n\nThe program, which began in 2007, grants high school students the opportunity to visit HBCUs throughout the country. This year, 125 high schools across New York and New Jersey were invited to participate in college prep workshops leading up to the week-long tour.\n\nThe program kicked off earlier this week with help from JAY’s mother, Gloria Carter, and will travel to HBCUs in Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta “in order to promote increased college attendance at these institutions of higher learning,” The Shawn Carter Foundation‘s official website reads. So far, students have reportedly visited Morehouse, Spellman, and North Carolina A&T State University.\n\nParticipants were carefully selected based upon their grade point average (a minimum GPA of 2.0) and commitment to community service. Other requirements to receive admission on the HBCU bus tour included a referral from a teacher, administrator, or principal and “strong interest, motivation and desire to go to college, particularly an HBCU,” the site explains.\n\nThe partnership is in line with the influential rapper’s recent investments into the youth. In August 2018, HOV and Queen Bey announced their alliance with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and gave away $1 million in scholarships to 10 deserving high schoolers during their “On the Run II” tour. Earlier that year, Beyoncé also announced the expansion of her own scholarship program to HBCUs only, for all genders."
