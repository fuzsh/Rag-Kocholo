        "text": "In his song “99 Problems,” Jay Z reimagines a real-life episode from his days as a cocaine dealer, when he and his friends were pulled over by a cop: “And I heard, ‘Son, do you know what I’m stopping you for?’ / ‘Cause I’m young and I’m black and my hat’s real low?’ ” In “Decoded,” Jay Z’s memoir, he elaborates: “ ‘Driving while black’ was usually a sufficient reason for the police to stop us. The first offense wasn’t the crack in the ride but the color of the driver.”\n\nNearly a decade after that track dropped, Jay Z has stayed relatively quiet about a new form of casual racial profiling: detaining and questioning black shoppers outside stores after they’ve paid for luxury purchases. In October, Trayon Christian, a nineteen-year-old from Brooklyn and a student at New York City College of Technology, claimed in a lawsuit that, after purchasing a three-hundred-and-ninety-dollar Ferragamo belt at the upscale retailer Barneys, in April, he was stopped by detectives, handcuffed, and held for two hours at a police station in Manhattan. Media coverage of the situation prompted Kayla Phillips, a twenty-one-year-old nursing student from Canarsie, to come forward with a similar story from February. She lodged her own racial-discrimination case against the police and Barneys. The Reverend Al Sharpton dubbed the practice “shop-and-frisk,” an allusion to the New York City Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practice, and the phrase stuck.\n\nFor Jay Z, the timing was awkward: Barneys had recently announced a special collection named partly after the artist; twenty-five per cent of sales would go to a nonprofit founded by him. “If you close your eyes and think about who best represents New York and stands for the city, you can’t help but think about Shawn Carter,” the Barneys C.E.O., Mark Lee, told Women’s Wear Daily.\n\nBarneys responded to the lawsuits by hiring the civil-rights consultant and U.S. Commission on Civil Rights member Michael Yaki to review the store’s practices and reach out to black community leaders. It has also increased the amount of the collection’s sales pledged to Jay Z’s scholarship foundation from twenty-five to a hundred per cent. And it is one of several stores that have agreed to post a “Customers’ Bill of Rights” in which they pledge to prevent racial profiling.\n\nJay Z went ahead with the partnership. If you need a pair of leather boxing shorts embellished with gold crosses ($2,590), a crocodile jacket designed by Rick Owens ($58,000), a Brooklyn snapback with a signature python brim by Just Don ($895), or a Lanvin vinyl-coated tie that merges camo and jacquard into one pattern ($560), look no further than the third-floor BNY SCC Gallery at the flagship store. (The initials are a mash-up of Barneys and Jay Z’s given name, Shawn Corey Carter.)\n\nJay Z’s sole public responses to the allegations of racial profiling were delivered as blog posts. In the first, from late October, he wrote, “I move and speak based on facts and not emotion. I haven’t made any comments because I am waiting on facts and the outcome of a meeting between community leaders and Barneys.” He added, “Making a decision prematurely to pull out of this project, wouldn’t hurt Barneys or Shawn Carter, but all the people that stand a chance at higher education.” In a second post, in mid-November, he wrote, “I have agreed to move forward with the launch of BNY SCC collection under the condition that I have a leadership role and seat on a council specifically convened to deal with the issue of racial profiling.”\n\nThat wasn’t enough for some critics, who felt that the measured statements came across as highly corporate—the response of someone balancing multiple stakeholders, including the people represented by his management company, Roc Nation. “Any African-American, male or female, with any consciousness of what has happened would not go into Barneys right now,” André Leon Talley, the former editor at large of Vogue, told the Times. Derick Bowers, a self-declared lifelong Jay Z fan, is selling T-shirts that say “Barneys New Slaves,” and has collected more than fifty-eight thousand signatures for an online petition demanding that Jay Z publicly disavow and end the Barneys partnership.\n\nPerhaps some of the disappointment stems from Jay Z’s outspokenness in the past about similar issues: he skipped the Grammys in 1999 and 2002, despite being nominated, because the awards recognized too few rappers, and he boycotted Cristal champagne in 2006, after an executive at Louis Roederer, the producer of Cristal, suggested in The Economist that hip-hop artists who drink his Champagne might consider Dom Perignon or Krug instead.\n\nThe beneficiary of the Barneys collaboration, the Shawn Carter Foundation, gives out scholarships to disadvantaged college students, a group that seem socioeconomically similar to Christian and Phillips, the shop-and-frisk accusers. At the time of the alleged incident, Christian said that he had bought his belt with work-study wages. In his suit against Barneys and the N.Y.P.D., he said the officers who questioned him after he left the store asked how he could afford a Ferragamo belt. Phillips told the Daily News that she used a tax refund from her part-time job at Home Depot to pay for a twenty-five-hundred-dollar suede Céline bag, using a temporary A.T.M. card. As in Christian’s case, the detectives were allegedly incredulous that she would have the funds to pay for it: “They kept asking how I could afford this expensive bag,” she told the paper.\n\n“Shopping has been important, especially to black men, since the birth of the black middle class in the nineteen-twenties,” Tonya Roberts, an analyst with the market-research firm Mintel, told me. “They couldn’t compete on where they lived, because of segregation, or where they worked, but they could take tremendous pride in this.” For younger consumers like Christian and Phillips, she described the empowerment of purchasing power. “It’s like a badge, a sense of entitlement, that ‘I’ve earned it, I’m successful.’ It is aspiration in a lot of ways, but it all ties back to self-image.”\n\nI visited Barneys in mid-December and was the only visitor browsing the BNY SCC Gallery. I fingered a six-hundred-and-ninety-five-dollar cashmere ski mask and spritzed myself from an atomizer of Gold Jay Z, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar limited edition of his new signature cologne. I asked a security guard, a black man, what he thought of the shop-and-frisk controversy, and what he made of the practice; like his employer, he blamed the N.Y.P.D. “We can’t do anything once a customer has left the store,” he said, “and you know they’re looking for someone who doesn’t look the part.”\n\nPhotograph: Andrew Burton/Getty"
