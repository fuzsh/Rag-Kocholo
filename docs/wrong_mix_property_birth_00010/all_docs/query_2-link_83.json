        "text": "Leading by example and pushing the culture forward are what this power couple seem to be about. Not just talking a good game, the Carters are blazing trails for others to be great too!\n\nIt’s no secret that Beyoncé Knowles-Carter and Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter are already well known for their philanthropy, especially as it pertains to contributing toward the higher education costs of college-bound students. They are continuing that legacy this year with another new scholarship program.\n\nEarlier this year, the Carters established separate scholarship funds through their individual foundations. After her iconic Coachella performance, Beyoncé established the Homecoming Scholars Award Program for students attending Xavier University, Wilberforce University, Tuskegee University and Bethune-Cookman University – all Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) through her BeyGOOD initiative.\n\nBeyonce New Scholarship Program For HBCU Students\n\nThrough his Shawn Carter Foundation, Jay-Z along with his mother, Gloria Carter created a scholarship that provides financial support to high school students as well as first-time undergraduate students who may not be eligible for other scholarships.\n\nEarlier this week, we learned that one of our favorite couples has grossed more than $150 million on their On The Run II tour. The show-stopping duo has announced that more than $1 million from their ticket sales will be awards to 11 students living in the cities part of the United States leg of the tour.\n\nOn Saturday, Parkwood Entertainment announced The Shawn Carter Foundation and BeyGOOD initiative will award $100,000 to 11 qualified students in Atlanta, Orlando, Miami, Arlington, New Orleans, Houston, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Clara, and Seattle. The awardees will be chosen by Boys and Girls Club of America branches in the above locations.\n\nOnce chosen, the $100,000 would be a dedicated university-based fund that would be used for the student’s expenses throughout their enrollment in college.\n\nI guess it’s good luck to all the students and may the best one win!"
