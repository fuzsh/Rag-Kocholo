Notable attendees included Jay-Z, his mother, Gloria Carter, and his wife, Beyoncé Knowles.\n\nThe star-studded event featured music artists DJ Khaled, Lil Uzi Vert, Meek Mill, Babyface, Miguel, Tinashe, A$AP Ferg, and Saint John, adding to the evening’s vibrant atmosphere.

Additionally, Twitter’s former CEO Jack Dorsey showed his support with a generous $2-million contribution, marking his annual donation to the cause.\n\nWith the recent success of its 20th Anniversary Gala, The Shawn Carter Foundation is now better positioned to continue making a positive impact, empowering individuals from diverse backgrounds to overcome obstacles and fulfill their educational aspirations.\n\nThrough the unwavering dedication of Jay-Z, Gloria Carter, and their esteemed partners, the foundation’s legacy shines as a beacon of hope and opportunity for countless young minds striving to create a brighter future."
