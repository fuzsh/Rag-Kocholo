        "text": "The name’s Z… Jay-Z.\n\nHip-hop legend Jay-Z will host a 007-themed party in Atlantic City this month to raise funds for his Reform Alliance, Page Six has exclusively learned.\n\nThe intimate all-star blackjack party will have a $1 million pot, and expected A-list guests include Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian, Tom Brady, Travis Scott and more.\n\nKevin Hart will emcee the intimate Casino Royale event that’s being limited to 300 guests.\n\nPlayers will pony up $100,000 as a buy-in to play in the blackjack games, while non-players will pay $50,000, we hear.\n\nThe bash on Sept. 30 at the Ocean Casino Resort, which is donating the jackpot, is being hosted with the Reform Alliance board, which includes Robert Kraft, Meek Mill and Michael Rubin.\n\nMultiple guests confirmed the party to us, and one said, “It was Jay’s idea to make a really small, incredibly exclusive event with the best people in the world.”\n\nJay and Bey also host one of the Oscars’ starriest private afterparties with their annual Gold Party in LA.\n\nWe hear Jay’s inspiration for the casino bash was Rubin’s annual Fourth of July white party.\n\nSaid an insider, “This is gold plus white, and it’ll be the same size and as exclusive as the white party, with a ton of performances.”\n\nOthers rumored to be in attendance include DJ Khaled, Emily Ratajkowski, Megan Thee Stallion and a host of NBA superstars, plus private equity players, hedge funders and top CEOs.\n\nWe hear Jay came up with the idea as an exclusive party for Reform Alliance’s first big event rather than a usual fundraising gala.\n\nTo date, the Reform board has committed more than $100 million to its cause, but this will be its first major event when those outside the board have been asked to contribute.\n\nThere will even be 10 to 15 helicopters flying guests back and forth from NYC for the extravaganza.\n\nWe hear that the goal for the event is to raise $20 million, and sources close to the charity tell us the org has already raised $15 million. Jay-Z’s Shawn Carter Foundation recently raised $20 million at its gala.\n\nReform Alliance aims to change probation and parole laws, and has helped pass 18 bills to date in 11 states while creating a pathway for over 700,000 people unfairly caught in the system.\n\nThe board also includes Nets co-owner Clara Wu Tsai, Robert Smith, Michael Novogratz and Laura Arnold.\n\nRumor has it some members of the board are approving all guests, one-by-one, for the event to maintain exclusivity. A casino insider said, “You can’t buy your way into this party.”"
