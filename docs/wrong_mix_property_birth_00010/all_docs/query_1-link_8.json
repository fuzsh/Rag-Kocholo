        "text": "This year marks the 40th anniversary of Def Jam Recordings, the New York label that made history in hip-hop, R&B, pop, and even thrash metal since its founding, and continues to do so today.\n\nA label that began out of an NYU dorm room in 1984 quickly became an artistic (and business) powerhouse. Early acts like LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys, and Public Enemy were raw, adventurous, and risk-taking. Def Jam's roster opened new pathways in a still-young genre, seemingly every few months.\n\nAfter that initial explosion, the label experienced a brief lull in the early 1990s when one label founder departed and the other expanded into fashion and comedy. Def Jam came roaring back beginning in 1994, and by 1998 the label was home to some of the most popular and influential artists in the game — including burgeoning megastars DMX and Jay-Z. To this day, Def Jam maintains a roster of both commercially successful and critically beloved artists in hip-hop, R&B, and pop.\n\nTo commemorate the anniversary of the label that gave us, well, pretty much everyone, here’s a list of 15 of Def Jam’s essential releases. While Def Jam brought audiences plenty of singles, EPs and remixes, this list primarily focuses on albums. Each project has a mix of artistic merit, popularity, influence and longevity, originality, and played a key role in the story of Def Jam as a whole. Think of it as a chronological run through the key albums that built one of the most lasting labels in modern music.\n\nAnd finally: it must be said that in recent years, a dark shadow has begun to loom over Def Jam’s legacy. Label co-founder Russell Simmons been accused over the past seven years of numerous instances of sexual assault, dating back decades. In spite of these accusations, the label (in which Simmons hasn’t been involved for a quarter-century) remains on top, safeguarding its valuable archive while looking forward to another four decade run as fruitful as the first one.\n\nT La Rock & Jazzy Jay - \"It’s Yours\" (1984)\n\nThe one single on this list is also the first piece of music ever released with the now-famous Def Jam logo. \"It’s Yours\" was a single produced by Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin — his very first hip-hop production. Instrumentally, it was perhaps only comparable to Larry Smith and Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons’ contemporaneous work with Run-D.M.C. Both \"It’s Yours\" and D.M.C.’s early work were severely stripped-down, consisting of a few drum sounds, an instrumental stab, and some scratches.\n\nLyrically, though, \"It’s Yours\" is worlds apart from \"Sucker M.C.’s\" — or pretty much anything else going on in hip-hop at the time. T La Rock, the brother of Treacherous Three member Special K, came from a family of educators, and he put every ounce of his erudition into the track. It begins, \"Commentating, illustrating/ Description giving, adjective expert\" and goes from there.\n\nLL Cool J - 'Radio' (1985)\n\nIn the early 1980s, the state of the hip-hop album was very grim. Only a few existed, and they almost exclusively consisted of a few singles mixed with often-confusing filler. Two things changed that. First, Run-D.M.C.’s 1984 self-titled debut, which GRAMMY.com examined in depth a few months ago. Second was LL Cool J’s debut album Radio, the very first full-length album Def Jam ever released.\n\nIn many ways, Radio kicked off hip-hop’s Golden Age. The record shows LL, then still in his teens, as a versatile artist who can be boastful, funny, aggressive, lyrical. The album shows many different sides of his personality, and helped set the template for what a rap album could be.\n\nRead more: 20 Iconic Hip-Hop Style Moments: From Run-D.M.C. To Runways\n\nBeastie Boys - 'Licensed to Ill' (1986)\n\nThe Beasties would release more complex and enlightened albums than Licensed to Ill, and one of the members would eventually apologize for some of its lyrics. But there’s no denying that it was a smash hit. It was the first rap album to ever top the Billboard 200, got the group onstage with Madonna, and would eventually sell over 10 million copies.\n\nWas some of that success due to their race? Sure. They were a credible group, signed to a hot rap label, at a time when it was still novel for white people to be performers in hip-hop. And yet, that’s not the whole story.\n\nLicensed to Ill is a catchy, unique, energetic album, and the group members show undeniable chemistry. To this day, shout-filled, guitar-heavy anthems like \"No Sleep till Brooklyn\" and the ubiquitous \"Fight for Your Right\" can still get the party started.\n\nRead more: The Beastie Boys Provide A License To Party\n\nPublic Enemy - 'It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back' (1988)\n\nThere’s not too much you can say about this album that hasn’t already been said in the years of books, conferences, academic papers, and deluxe re-issues. It has ended up at or near the top of many all-time best lists. Its abrasive, collage-like approach to composition was never equalled (and, in light of current laws and practices around sampling, can never even be approached). The comic stylings of Flavor Flav bring just the right amount of levity to balance Chuck D’s takes on life-and-death issues.\n\nDecades after its release, the album still sounds urgent. And sadly, in an America still roiled with tensions over race, incarceration, drugs, and the media, its concerns remain as relevant as ever.\n\nRead more: 5 Things We Learned At \"An Evening With Chuck D\" At The GRAMMY Museum\n\nSlick Rick - 'The Great Adventures of Slick Rick' (1988)\n\nSlick Rick is the ultimate rap storyteller, and his debut album is the best example of his artistry. \"I wrote them like an essay,\" Rick once said of creating the batch of songs that make up Great Adventures. He also compared it to doing stand-up. So you have exactly what those two reference points imply: stories that are well-constructed, and also frequently riotously funny.\n\nRick is the master of the telling detail (remember \"Dave, the dope fiend shooting dope/ Who don’t know the meaning of water nor soap\" from \"Children’s Story\"?), the humorous twist, the morality tale, the bedtime story, the character voice. His influence lives on in perhaps his most devoted protege, Ghostface Killah, as well as in any rapper who has tried to craft a song with a beginning, middle, and end.\n\nLearn more: Essential Hip-Hop Releases From The 1980s: Slick Rick, RUN-D.M.C., De La Soul & More\n\nWarren G - 'Regulate… G Funk Era'(1994)\n\nA bit of an edge case here, as technically the record was put out by Violator Records and Rush Associated Labels, the latter of which was a sort of umbrella organization Def Jam ran in the mid-1990s. Many albums that could have made this list, including projects by Redman, Onyx, Domino, and Nice & Smooth, were released under the RAL banner. But Warren G’s debut, a giant hit in an era where Def Jam really needed it, became inextricably associated with the label, to the point where an article about the album on Universal Music’s website mentions Def Jam five times in the first two paragraphs.\n\nRegulate is a pop-savvy take on the G-funk sound that was then ascendant. It was a huge success in a year that saw the introduction of tons of amazing rappers into the game. And Warren G being associated with Def Jam meant that the East Coast-centric label had expanded its geographic footprint.\n\nRead more: Warren G Revisits 'Regulate: The G-Funk Era': How The 1994 Album Paved The Way For West Coast Hip-Hop's Dominance\n\nFoxy Brown - 'Ill Na Na' (1996)\n\nDef Jam wasn’t always a friendly place for female artists (despite many of the most important employees being women, including one-time president Nana Ashhurst). In fact, the label didn’t release a rap album by a woman until Nikki D’s Daddy’s Little Girl in 1991. So Foxy Brown’s impact — on Def Jam and on the rap world as a whole — cannot be overstated. Ill Na Na was an album that changed everything for female rappers. It had songs for the clubs, the block, and the radio. Foxy’s sexuality, versatility, and first-class rhyming would have an influence on countless rappers, most famously her number one fan Nicki Minaj, who has been effusively praising Foxy for more than a decade.\n\nRead more: Ladies First: 10 Essential Albums By Female Rappers\n\nDMX - 'It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot' (1998)\n\nNo less an authority than Nas referred to 1998 as \"The year DMX took over the world.\" It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot is how he did it. The album set fire to Bad Boy’s so-called \"shiny suit era\" by embodying its polar opposite: a dark, grimy vision full of gothic synths; raspy, full-throated lyrics; and, sometimes, actual barks. Without DMX, there’s no NYC street rap return: no G-Unit mixtape run, no Diplomats.\n\nThe record is consistent and captivating from start to finish, and its thematic centerpiece comes, appropriately, about halfway through with \"Damien,\" which reminds all of us that the most difficult battles we fight are the ones with ourselves.\n\nJay-Z - 'Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life' (1998)\n\nJay-Z has made more critically beloved albums than Vol. 2 (Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint both fall in that category). He has made albums with bigger hits (The Blueprint 3 had a No. 1 hit with \"Empire State of Mind\"). But he has never made a more important LP.\n\nVol. 2 was the album that made Jay a superstar. Its Annie-sampling title track (produced by the late 45 King) sent him to the stratosphere — a process he actually documented on his follow-up album. But the record wasn’t just a commercial novelty. It showed Jay at the absolute top of his game: cocky, funny, and brilliant. Case in point: his novel approach to storytelling in \"Coming of Age (Da Sequel),\" where all the important action takes place in just a few seconds, inside the characters’ heads.\n\nRead more: Songbook: How Jay-Z Created The 'Blueprint' For Rap's Greatest Of All Time\n\nLudacris - 'Word of Mouf' (2001)\n\nAround the turn of the millennium, Def Jam had its sights set on conquering new territory. Specifically, the South. So they set up Def Jam South and hired Scarface to head it up. The entity’s biggest success came from an Atlanta DJ who went by Chris Luva Luva on the air, but began rapping as Ludacris.\n\nWord of Mouf was Luda’s second album, but it was the one that really cemented his stardom with songs like \"Rollout (My Business),\" \"Area Codes,\" and the immortal \"Move Bitch\" (the last of which has had an artist-approved second life as a protest chant). The album proved that the South was here to stay, and that Def Jam would have a role in determining its hip-hop future.\n\nLearn more: A Guide To Southern Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From The Dirty South\n\nScarface - 'The Fix' (2002)\n\nSpeaking of Scarface and Def Jam South, Face had no intention of dropping music while running the label. But, in his telling, Def Jam exec Lyor Cohen insisted on it, paying handsomely for the privilege.\n\n\"There were so many things working in my favor on that album,\" Scarface wrote in his memoir Diary of a Madman. \"For the first time, I was working on an album for a label that believed in me 100 percent and didn’t want anything from me except for me to make the dopest album I could possibly make. And they went out of their way to make that possible.\"\n\nDef Jam’s history of putting out classics inspired Face on The Fix, he writes in that book. And in the end, the album stands up there with any of them. It is one of only a small handful of rap records to earn a perfect five-mic rating from The Source, and it belongs in that rarified air with projects like Illmatic and Aquemini.\n\nKanye West - 'The College Dropout' (2004)\n\nYes, today Kanye West is the worst: a Hitler-loving, Trump-supporting, paranoid, antichoice, antisemite who stands accused of sexual harrassment. But two decades ago, the world met a Mr. West who at least seemed very different.\n\nThe College Dropout presented an artist who was already extremely well-known as a beatmaker. But Kanye’s carefully crafted persona as the bridge between mainstream rap and the underground — \"First n— with a Benz and a backpack,\" as he put it — meant that he appealed to pretty much everyone. The College Dropout wasn't West at the top of his rap game, but it did show his skill at developing song concepts, at beats, and at creating an artistic vision so powerful, and so relatable, that it captivated an entire generation.\n\nCam’ron - 'Purple Haze' (2004)\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Def Jam without discussing Roc-A-Fella. Jay-Z’s label hooked up with Def Jam in 1997, and had a years-long hot streak with artists like Kanye, Beanie Sigel, Freeway, the Young Gunz, and of course Cam’ron’s Diplomats crew — Cam, Juelz Santana, and the overall group all released projects there.\n\nPurple Haze came at the very tail end of Roc-a-fella’s golden age. It has Cam at the absolute peak of his absurdist rhyming powers, keeping computers ‘puting and knocking out eight-syllable multis about Paris Hilton like it was nothing. During the Purple Haze era, it was Cam’s world, and we were all just lucky to be living in it.\n\nRihanna - 'Good Girl Gone Bad' (2007)\n\nRihanna’s first two projects were full of Caribbean sounds and ballads. But when her third album came along, she needed a change. Riri wanted to go \"uptempo,\" and history shows that was the right choice. Good Girl Gone Bad began the singer’s transformation into the megastar we know today. It spawned five singles and two separate quickie tie-in albums (Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded and Good Girl Gone Bad: The Remixes).\n\n\"Umbrella\" was the way forward. Rihanna had a No. 1 record prior, but she’d never made a sensation like this. The song (with a guest verse by then-Def Jam president Jay-Z) not only made it to the top slot, it also won a GRAMMY and was undeniably the song of the summer. The album also contained the sensation \"Don’t Stop the Music,\" a track that kickstarted the EDM/pop hybrid that dominated the late aughts. Without Good Girl Gone Bad, it’s safe to say we’d be living in a very different, Fenty-less world.\n\nRead more: Songbook: The Ultimate Guide To Rihanna's Reign, From Her Record-Breaking Hits To Unforgettable Collabs\n\nFrank Ocean - 'Channel Orange' (2012)\n\nOne could fill a whole blurb about Channel Orange simply by quoting the extreme praise it received. \"A singular achievement in popular culture.\" \"Landed with the crash and curiousness of a meteor.\" Two days after its release, Pitchfork was already saying that it \"feels like a classic.\"\n\nAnd yet, somehow even that kind of acclaim doesn’t do the album justice. You really had to be there when it came out, when Frank looked into his soul and, in doing so, connected deeply with so many listeners\n\nRead more: Frank Ocean Essentials: 10 Songs That Embody The Elusive Icon's R&B Genius\n\n\"Channel Orange is the most concentrated version of 2012 in 2012 so far,\" wrote Sasha Frere-Jones at the time, in one of the most dead-on statements about the album. It expressed the contradictions we all lived in. Its fragmentation mirrored the social media that was beginning to take over all of our lives. Ocean left bits of his biography scattered throughout the album, but they almost didn’t matter. He was speaking for all of us, in the way only great artists can.\n\nA Guide To New York Hip-Hop: Unpacking The Sound Of Rap's Birthplace From The Bronx To Staten Island\n\nPRIDE & Black Music Month: Celebrating LGBTQIA+ & Black Voices\n\nIn a world of braggadocio lyrics, where weakness is often looked down upon, hip-hop can often seem far from a safe place to discuss mental health.\n\nBut underneath its rugged exterior, hip-hop culture and its artists have long been proponents of well-being and discussing the importance of taking care of one's mental health. Openness about these topics has grown in recent years, including a 2022 panel discussion around hip-hop and mental health, co-hosted by the GRAMMY Museum, the Recording Academy's Black Music Collective, and MusicCares in partnership with the Universal Hip-Hop Museum.\n\n\"Artists are in a fight-or-flight mode when it comes to being in this game,\" said Eric Brooks, former VP of Marketing & Promotions at Priority Records who worked with NWA and Dr. Dre. \"And there need to be strategies on how to deal with the inner battles that only happen in the mind and body.\"\n\nThe panel only scratched the surface of the many times hip-hop culture has illuminated critical mental health issues that often remain hidden or under-discussed in the music industry. In recognition of Mental Health Awareness Month, read on for 10 times hip-hop has shone a light on mental health.\n\nJ. Cole Apologized To Kendrick Lamar\n\nA long-simmering beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar was reignited in March 2024 when Metro Boomin' and Future released \"Like That.\" The track featured a scathing verse from Kendrick, where he took aim at Drake and J. Cole, and referenced the pair's collaborative song \"First Person Shooter.\"\n\nThe single begged for a response, and J. Cole, under what was presumably a significant amount of pressure, surprise-released his Might Delete Later. The album featured \"7 Minute Drill,\" in which Cole calls Kendrick's To Pimp, A Butterfly boring.\n\nBut the same week Cole's album came out, he apologized to Kendrick onstage at his Dreamville Fest, saying it didn't sit right with his spirit and that he \"felt terrible\" since it was released. Cole added that the song didn’t sit right with him spiritually and he was unable to sleep. Cole subsequently removed \"7 Minute Drill\" from streaming services.\n\nStrong debate followed about whether or not Cole should have removed the song. However, many heralded Cole’s maturity in the decision and said it was an important example of not doing things that don’t align with one's true emotions, and avoiding allowing others expectations of you weight down your own physical and mental health.\n\nSiR Spoke Candidly About Depression & Sobriety\n\nAlthough an R&B artist, TDE singer SiR is hip-hop adjacent, having collaborated with former labelmate Kendrick Lamar on tracks like \"D'Evils\" and \"Hair Down.\" SiR recently spoke with GRAMMY.com about the troubles that followed him after the release of his 2019 album Chasing Summer.\n\n\"I was a full-blown addict, and it started from a string of depression [and] relationship issues and issues at home that I wasn't dealing with,\" SiR says. After the Los Angeles-based singer had hit rock bottom, he found the spark he needed to do something about it. His initial rehab stint was the first step on the road to change.\n\n\"I was there for 21 days [in 2021]. [The] second time, I was there for two months and the third time wasn't technically rehab…I did personal therapy, and, man, [that] did wonders,\" he recalls.\n\nSiR also tackled the stigma many Black communities place on therapy and seeking help for mental health issues. \"I would've never done something like that if I was in any other position, so I'm thankful for my issues because they led me to a lot of self-reflection and forgiveness,\" SiR says.\n\nBig Sean Educated His Audience About Anxiety & Depression\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in addressing anxiety and depression is the feeling that those issues must be kept under wraps. In 2021, Big Sean and his mother released a series of videos in conjunction with Mental Health Awareness Month, in which the GRAMMY nominee opened up about his battles with depression and anxiety.\n\nIn one of those videos, Sean and his mother discussed the importance of sleep and circadian rhythms when managing depression and mental health issues. In an industry that prioritizes the grind, the hip-hop community often overlooks sleep — much to its detriment.\n\n\"Sleep is the most overlooked, disrespected aspect of our well-being,\" said Myra Anderson, Executive Director & President of the Sean Anderson Foundation and Big Sean's mother. \"Even one day without good sleep can mess up your hormones severely.\"\n\nAs a busy recording artist, Sean concurs that, for him, a lack of sleep contributes to challenges with anxiety. “If I’m not in the right mindset, I don’t get the right sleep,” says Sean in the mental health video series. “Then that anxiety rides high, and my thoughts are racing. I’m somebody that lives in my head.”\n\nG.Herbo's \"PTSD\" Addressed The Impact Of Street Violence\n\nEastside Chicago's G. Herbo is an artist vital to the city's drill music scene. On \"PTSD,\" the title track of his 2020 album, Herbo raps about his struggles coping with violence and loss.\n\n\"I can't sleep 'cause it's a war zone in my head / My killers good, they know I'm hands-on with the bread / A million dollars ahead, I'm still angry and seeing red / How the f*ck I'm 'posed to have fun? All my n— dead.\"\n\nThe lyrics echoed the realities of what G. Herbo grew up seeing in O-Block, considered by many to be one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Chicago. But it wasn't just a song title; G. Herbo was diagnosed with PTSD in 2019 and began therapy to manage it, showing that even rap's most hardened have opened themselves up to professional help.\n\n\"I'm so glad that I did go to therapy,\" G. Herbo told GRAMMY.com in July 2020. \"I'm glad that I did take that leap of faith to just go talk to somebody about my situation and just my thoughts and get 'em to a person with an unbiased opinion.\"\n\nJoe Budden Opens Up About His Darkest Times\n\nIn 2017, on the \"Grass Routes Podcast,\" rapper-turned-podcaster Joe Budden opened up about multiple suicide attempts and his lifelong battle with depression.\n\n\"For me, there have been times where I've actually attempted suicide,\" Budden shared. \"As open as I've been when it comes to mental health, it wasn't until retirement from rapping that I was able to dive into some of the things the fans have seen.\"\n\nNever one to shy away from rapping about his mental health struggles, Budden songs like \"Whatever It Takes\" peel back the layers on an artist fighting his demons: \"See, I'm depressed lately, but nobody understands / That I'm depressed lately, I'm sorta feelin repressed lately.\"\n\nBudden continued to be a champion for mental health that year, including on his former Complex show \"Everyday Struggle,\" where Budden broke down while discussing the suicide death of fellow rapper Styles P's daughter.\n\nIn recent years, Budden has uses his wildly popular \"The Joe Budden Podcast\" as a tool to discuss his own struggles and raise awareness of mental health issues.\n\nGrandmaster Flash & The Furious Five Broadcast A Serious \"Message\"\n\nHip-hop culture has long used rap as a tool to highlight mental health and the everyday struggles of its community. Released in 1982, Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five's \"The Message\" is an early, effective example of vulnerability in hip-hop.\n\n\"The Message\" described the mental health impacts of poverty and inner-city struggle, describing desperate feelings and calling for support in underserved communities: \"I can't take the smell, can't take the noise / Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice.\" Perhaps the most recognizable lyric comes from Melle Mel, who raps, \"Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge/I'm trying not to lose my head.\"\n\nEminem Got Honest About Depression While In Rehab\n\nOn \"Reaching Out,\" Queen and Paul Rodgers sing \"Lately I've been hard to reach / I've been too long on my own / everybody has a private world where they can be alone.\" These lyrics were sampled on the intro to Eminem's 2009 single \"Beautiful,\" a raw tale of the rapper's struggles with depression. Half of the song was written while Eminem was in rehab, including lyrics like \"I'm just so f—king depressed/I just can't seem to get out this slump.\"\n\nThe lyrics pierced the core of Eminem's audience, who were able to see the parallels between the struggles of a rap superstar and their own issues. The song reached the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for a Best Rap Solo Performance GRAMMY Award. In an interview with MTV about the song, Eminem said it was an important outlet for him at a challenging time.\n\nBut it was far from the first time Eminem has discussed mental health. One of the earliest examples was in his song \"Stan,\" where Eminem rapped from the perspective of an obsessed fan who ended up killing himself and his wife after Eminem failed to respond to his fan mail. In a 2000 interview, Eminem told MTV that he wrote the song to warn fans not to take his lyrics literally.\n\nLogic Sparked Change With A Number\n\nOne of the most impactful moments hip-hop has seen regarding mental health and sparking change was when Logic released his song \"1-800-273-8255\" in 2017. The record, named after the real National Suicide Lifeline Prevention phone number, which is now 988, hit the top three on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nFollowing the song's release, the British Medical Journal released a study sharing data that showed the song contributed to a 27 percent increase in calls to the prevention hotline that year and may have even contributed to an actual reduction in deaths by suicide.\n\nLogic's single further proved that rap music's impact extends well beyond charts and sales. \"1-800-273-8255\" highlighted the connection artists have with their fans, as well as the ways music can be a tool to cope with challenges like mental health and suicidal thoughts.\n\nKid Cudi Opened Up About Suicidal Urges\n\nCleveland's own Kid Cudi has never shied away from putting his emotions on record, rapping vividly throughout his career about his struggles with mental health. Cudi records, like the hit single \"Pursuit of Happiness,\" are brutally honest about trying to find happiness in a world filled with trials and tribulations.\n\nIn a 2022 interview with Esquire, Cudi recalled checking himself into rehab in 2016 for depression and suicidal urges. He had been using drugs to manage the weight of his stardom and even suffered a stroke while in rehab. \"Everything was f—ed,\" Cudi said.\n\nCudi took a break to develop stability, returning to the spotlight with the 2018 project Kids See Ghosts in collaboration with Kanye West.. Today, Cudi and his music remain pillars of strength for those facing similar challenges.\n\nJay-Z Detailed The Importance Of Therapy & Getting Out Of \"Survival Mode\"\n\nIn 2017, Jay-Z released his critically acclaimed thirteenth studio album. 4:44 was packed with lessons on family, mental health, and personal growth.\n\nAn interview with the New York Times, Jay-Z discussed how helpful therapy had been to him. Therapy helped the rap superstar in his interactions with other people — something that had been hardened growing up as a black man in Marcy Projects. \"I grew so much from the experience,\" he told the Times.\n\n\"I think the most important thing I got is that everything is connected. Every emotion is connected, and it comes from somewhere. I understand that, instead of reacting to that with anger, I can provide a softer landing and maybe, 'Aw, man, is you O.K.? You're in this space where you're hurting, and you think I see you, so you don't want me to look at you. And you don't want me to see you,'\" he said. \"You don't want me to see your pain.\"\n\nThe album also unpacked Jay-Z's infidelity. \"I'll f— up a good thing if you let me,\" he raps on \"Family Feud.\" In the same interview, Jay-Z shared that growing up in the hood put him into \"survival mode,\" impacting his abilities to be a good partner and husband earlier in life.\n\n\"You shut down all emotions. So even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you can't connect,\" he reflected. \"In my case, like it's, it's deep. And then all the things happen from there: infidelity.\"\n\n\"I Made My ADHD Into My Strength\": Understanding The Link Between Rap & Neurodivergence\n\nA chance meeting changed Rihanna's life.\n\nThe singer was just 15 years old when she met producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing with his wife in Barbados. Rogers recognized Rihanna's potential, and invited her to an audition in his hotel suite.\n\nShortly after her 16th birthday, Rihanna left her home country for the U.S. to record a demo, which included her breakthrough hit \"Pon de Replay.\" The demo found its way into Jay-Z's hands, and Hov signed the teen artist to Def Jam and the label expedited her 2005 debut album, aptly titled Music of the Sun.\n\n\"When I left Barbados, I didn't look back,\" Rihanna told Entertainment Weekly in 2007. \"I wanted to do what I had to do [to succeed], even if it meant moving to America.\"\n\nTwenty years later, Rihanna is a renowned entertainer-turned-mogul. She has sold over 40 million albums worldwide, garnered over 12 billion Spotify streams, achieved 14 Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers, and won nine GRAMMY Awards. Even her business ventures have been a massive success, as her Fenty Beauty brand is worth $2.8 billion.\n\nThough it's been close to a decade since Rihanna's last studio album, 2016's ANTI, she reminded the world of her reign with her 2023 Super Bowl halftime show — which also marked her first time taking the stage in five years. Performing hit after hit while unveiling a baby bump, her 13-minute set became one of the most-watched halftime shows of all time with over 121 million viewers.\n\nIn honor of Rihanna's 36th birthday on Feb. 20, GRAMMY.com is revisiting the monstrous hits, ambitious projects, brow-raising visuals, and iconic collabs that propelled her to international stardom — and why it's all put her in a league of her own.\n\nA New Island Girl In Town\n\nTrue to her Carribean heritage, Rihanna's dancehall-inspired debut single \"Pon de Replay\" earned the then 17-year-old Barbados native her first entry on the Hot 100 at an impressive No. 2. Her official introduction to the world also hit No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart; she boasts 33 on the tally, second behind only the Queen of Pop herself, Madonna.\n\nFollow-up single \"If It's Lovin' That You Want\" stalled at No. 36 on the Hot 100, but still whetted fans' appetite — as did her debut album, Music of the Sun, which is mostly comprised of dance-pop and dancehall tracks with hints of R&B (like \"Willing to Wait\"). Plus, her reimagining of Dawn Penn's 1994 reggae classic \"You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)\" is still so fun to listen to after all these years.\n\nA mere eight months later, Rihanna's sophomore effort, 2006's A Girl Like Me, arrived to an eager audience. Defying the sophomore slump, she celebrated her first No. 1 with the ubiquitous lead single \"SOS,\" which famously samples Soft Cell's 1981 hit, \"Tainted Love.\" While A Girl Like Me is filled with high-energy, danceable tracks (including the nostalgic \"Break It Off\" with Sean Paul), Rihanna's second single was the melodramatic ballad \"Unfaithful.\"\n\nPenned by then-labelmate Ne-Yo, \"Unfaithful\" peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100. More importantly, it showed a different side to Rihanna, proving that she could channel deep emotion when the performance calls for it. It also marked Rihanna's first time veering away from her \"girl next door\" image, as the song's subject matter deals with infidelity.\n\nA Girl Like Me contains many fan favorites, from the laid-back \"We Ride\" to standouts \"Dem Haters\" and \"Kisses Don't Lie.\" The latter is a reggae-rock hybrid that sounds like a catalyst for some of Rihanna's edgier tunes like \"Breakin' Dishes\" from 2007's Good Girl Gone Bad era. Touching ballads\"Final Goodbye\" and \"A Million Miles Away\" showcase her voice beautifully, foreshadowing later big-vocal numbers like \"Love on the Brain.\"\n\nAn Icon In The Making\n\nRihanna was a familiar face by 2007, but with the arrival of her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad, she graduated from cookie-cutter pop star to bonafide icon.\n\nProduced by Tricky Stewart, the LP's juggernaut lead single \"Umbrella\" featuring Jay-Z skyrocketed to No. 1 in 17 countries. Between striking images of Rihanna's silver-painted silhouette in the accompanying video and the now-iconic \"ella-ella, eh, eh, eh\" hook, \"Umbrella\" thrust the then 19-year-old into another stratosphere. Her confident delivery also commanded attention in a way fans and critics hadn't heard before.\n\nThe transformative era also birthed the gritty \"Shut Up and Drive,\" on which Rihanna channels her inner rock star. The next two singles cracked the top 10: an affectionate duet with Ne-Yo, \"Hate That I Love You,\" which showed off Rihanna's softer side, and the party-starting, Michael Jackson-sampling \"Don't Stop the Music,\" which cemented her place in the digital era.\n\nThe melancholy \"Rehab\" is a clever metaphor for lost love, co-written by Timbaland and Justin Timberlake. Despite being Good Girl Gone Bad's lowest-charting single, Timberlake heralded the song as \"the bridge for her to be accepted as an adult in the music industry.\"\n\nGood Girl Gone Bad remains Rihanna's best-selling album and marks her greatest reinvention as she adopted a more rebellious sound. She also won her first GRAMMY in 2008 (Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Umbrella\") and scored four other nominations, including Record Of The Year. The album's reissue spawned two more No. 1s: \"Take a Bow\" and \"Disturbia,\" the latter of which acts like a prelude to Rated R, which saw Rihanna exploring darker themes.\n\nNine months before the release of 2009's Rated R, Rihanna was assaulted by then-boyfriend Chris Brown. On the deeply personal album, she translated her pain into art. Through lead single \"Russian Roulette\" and bitingly catchy anthems \"Stupid in Love,\" \"Fire Bomb,\" \"Photographs,\" \"Cold Case Love,\" and \"The Last Song,\" Rihanna explored her angst and confusion.\n\nBut to focus solely on the domestic violence incident undermines Rihanna's artistic vision.\n\nFollowing three multi-platinum albums in a three-year span, Rihanna's rebranding as a rebel at heart reached its apex. The singer had grown in leaps and bounds while taking musical risks, even penning nine of Rated R's 13 tracks (she had no writing credits on Good Girl Gone Bad).\n\nThe road to Rihanna's most badass anthems — including \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" — can be traced back to Rated R. Case in point: Her bravado is loud and clear on \"Hard,\" \"Wait Your Turn,\" and \"G4L.\" On \"Rockstar 101,\" which features legendary rocker Slash, Rihanna declares her power: \"Six inch walker/ Big sh— talker/ I never play the victim/ I'd rather be a stalker.\"\n\nBadgal RiRi returned to her dancehall roots on her fifth No. 1 \"Rude Boy,\" which offsets the album's harrowing motif. Final single \"Te Amo\" didn't chart, but garnered a great deal of attention as the Latin-infused Stargate production depicts Rihanna being enticed by a female love interest.\n\nRated R showcased Rihanna's undeniable star power, and allowed her to shed her good-girl image once and for all.\n\nA Partygoer's Dream\n\nFollowing the career-pivoting Rated R, 2010's Loud offered a welcome return to the West Indian artist's earlier sound. The album feels like one big celebration of life, as evidenced by Rihanna's fire-engine red hair and No. 1 singles \"Only Girl (In the World)\" and \"What's My Name?\" (the latter of which was Rih's first collaboration with Drake).\n\nBest described as \"Don't Stop the Music\" 2.0, the effervescent \"Only Girl\" marked her eminent return to the dance floor and took home a GRAMMY for Best Dance Recording in 2011. While \"What's My Name?\" may not outshine Rih and Drizzy's other collabs — including 2011's \"Take Care\" or 2016's \"Work\" — the second she sings, \"Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me,\" it's impossible not to whine your waist to the riddim.\n\nEasily one of Rihanna's most overlooked hits, \"Cheers (Drink to That)\" is built around an unexpected sample of Avril Lavigne's 2002 hit \"I'm With You,\" but it works surprisingly well as a party anthem. That same carefree spirit can be heard in the feminist track \"Raining Men,\" which features Nicki Minaj — their first of two collabs, as they joined forces again for \"Fly,\" the final single off the rapper's iconic Pink Friday album.\n\nA playful ode to sadomasochism and bondage, \"S&M\" contains some of Rihanna's most provocative lyrics: \"Sticks and stones may break my bones/ But chains and whips excite me,\" she declares on the chorus.\n\nBanned in 11 countries upon its release, the accompanying video features Rihanna tied up in pink rope, dancing with a blowup doll, and donning a Playboy bunny-esque costume as damning newsreels about herself flash across the screen. But Rihanna's love of kink made her an even bigger star: \"S&M\" produced a remix with Britney Spears and earned Rihanna her 10th No. 1 single. With this feat, she became the youngest artist to attain the most chart-toppers in a five-year span.\n\nOn \"Man Down,\" Rihanna's patois is in full effect as she takes listeners through a gripping tale about murdering her abuser. \"What started out as a simple altercation/ Turned into a real sticky situation,\" she laments in the opening verse, amplified by siren noises in the background. There's something so satisfying about Rihanna's Bajan accent as she unfurls \"Rum-pum-pum-pum\" repeatedly over an intensifying reggae beat that would make Sister Nancy and Bob Marley proud.\n\nNominated for Album Of The Year at the 2021 GRAMMYs, Loud is Rihanna's second most commercially successful LP — and for good reason. It was especially refreshing to see Rihanna emerge from one of the darkest periods of her life as exuberant as ever.\n\nAn Unapologetic Queen\n\nSonically and thematically, Talk That Talk doesn't break new ground, but Rih's DGAF attitude is front and center with plenty of sexual innuendos: Songs like \"S&M\" and \"Rude Boy\" seem pretty tame next to \"Cockiness (Love It),\" which features longtime friend-turned-boyfriend A$AP Rocky on its remix. \"Suck my cockiness/ Lick my persuasion/ Eat my poison/ And swallow your pride down, down,\" she commands in the tantalizing chorus.\n\nAt just over a minute long, \"Birthday Cake\" leaves nothing to the imagination (\"It's not even my birthday, but he wanna lick the icing off\"). Rihanna controversially released a full-length version in the form of a remix with Chris Brown.\n\nOn an album that mostly sees Rihanna singing about her sexual fantasies, \"We All Want Love\" pulls back the curtain as it reveals her desire for true love: \"And some say love ain't worth the buck/ But I'll give my last dime/ To have what I've only been dreaming about.\"\n\nHer longing continues in \"Where Have You Been,\" which flaunts Rihanna's versatility, flipping Geoff Mack's 1959 country song \"I've Been Everywhere\" into an infectious EDM banger. Lead single \"We Found Love\" is undeniably the biggest hit to stem from the Talk That Talk era, spending 10 consecutive weeks atop the Hot 100.\n\nBoosting Calvin Harris' career, \"We Found Love\" presents one juxtaposition after the other: dark yet gleaming, euphoric yet sobering, fraught yet hopeful. Rihanna relies on more than just evocative lyrics to tell her story; accompanying synthesizers and alarm bells help to paint a picture as well. Met with controversy, its intense visuals portraying a drug-fueled, toxic relationship — and featuringwhat many speculated was a Chris Brown look-alike — earned RiRi a GRAMMY for Best Long Form Music Video in 2013.\n\nSeven years into an already extraordinary career, 2012's Unapologetic became Rihanna's first album to debut at No. 1 on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart. Its lead single \"Diamonds\" resonated in an equally major way, giving Rih her 12th No. 1 on the Hot 100.\n\nWritten by Sia, the power ballad kicked off another exciting era for the Barbadian singer, who unleashes an impassioned vocal performance. One of Rihanna's most precious offerings to date, \"Diamonds\" emerged as a self-love mantra due to its uplifting \"Shine bright like a diamond\" chant.\n\nVocally, Rihanna's strength lies in her ability to evoke raw emotion à la \"Stay.\" Featuring Mikky Ekko, the stripped-down, slow-burning piano ballad narrowly missed the top spot on the Hot 100 but gave Rihanna her 24th top 10 hit, surpassing Whitney Houston's record of 23 in 2013.\n\nHer swagger is boisterous in \"Phresh Out the Runway,\" \"Jump,\" and strip club anthem \"Pour It Up,\" but \"Nobody's Business\" really drives home the album's theme of being unbothered. Her decision to join forces with Chris Brown yet again perplexed fans and critics alike, though the track itself is an irresistible production that features a genius interpolation of Michael Jackson's \"The Way You Make Me Feel.\"\n\nFurther down the track list, \"Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary\" is as autobiographical as it gets, and further taps into Rihanna's emotionally vulnerable side. \"Mr. Jesus, I'd love to be a queen/ But I'm from the left side of an island/ Never thought this many people would even know my name,\" she pleads in the seven-minute two-parter.\n\nUnapologetic spawned fewer hit singles compared to Rihanna's previous efforts. Its win for Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 2014 GRAMMYs, however, proved that Rihanna's reign wasn't letting up anytime soon.\n\nWhile recording her then-forthcoming album, ANTI, Rihanna delivered what is arguably the single most unapologetic moment of her career: \"Bitch Better Have My Money.\" The backstory is almost inconceivable given Rihanna's awe-inspiring billionaire status, but in 2009, Rihanna faced bankruptcy due to her accountants mishandling her funds — and thus \"Bitch\" was born six years later in 2015.\n\nWith lyrics like \"Your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car\" over a cryptic-sounding trap beat and an accompanying video depicting kidnapping and torturing her debtors, \"Bitch\" is not for the faint-hearted. The one-off single is so quintessentially Rihanna that it notably kicked off her Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nAn In-Demand Collaborator\n\nWhile bestowing hit after hit on her own, Rihanna generously lent her distinct voice to some of her biggest peers. 2008 marks one of the earliest instances of her Midas touch: She flirts with funk in Maroon 5's underappreciated \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" before hopping on T.I.'s \"Live Your Life,\" which shot straight to No. 1 on the Hot 100.\n\nIn 2009, Rihanna joined Jay-Z and Kanye West for the militant \"Run This Town,\" sounding defiant as ever in the intro. She was called upon again for West's horn-laden \"All of the Lights,\" flying solo on the hook followed by a star-studded choir that included Alicia Keys, John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John. Both larger-than-life productions won GRAMMYs for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2010 and 2012, respectively.\n\nIn between joining forces with Hov and Ye, Rihanna assisted Eminem in \"Love the Way You Lie,\" which struck a nerve with many for its gut-wrenching lyrics shedding a light on abusive relationships. (Rih recorded an equally moving sequel for her Loud album.) Three years later, the two confronted their inner demons in \"The Monster,\" and their musical chemistry scored a GRAMMY in 2015 for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.\n\nAmid smash collabs, Rihanna and Coldplay's intricate \"Princess of China\" number gets lost in the shuffle, but it speaks to her charm as it's the band's first album (2011's Mylo Xyloto) to feature another artist. Another overlooked jam, her sultry \"Can't Remember to Forget You\" duet with Shakira sees both stars trade lines about struggling to let go of an undeserving lover.\n\nOn paper, a collaboration between Rihanna, Kanye West, and Sir Paul McCartney may seem strange, but the unlikely trio is further proof that opposites attract. Their \"FourFiveSeconds\" is a pop-folk hybrid with a universal message about carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders. It's yet another example of Rihanna's willingness to push past her comfort zone to create something unique.\n\nA year later, Rihanna got listeners on their feet by way of the Taylor Swift-penned \"This Is What You Came For\" with Calvin Harris. Understated compared to the duo's previous megahits (\"We Found Love\" and \"Where Have You Been\"), Harris' signature DJing style and Rih's ethereal vocals are a perfect match.\n\nIn 2017, Rih, DJ Khaled and Bryson Tiller dropped the song of the summer with \"Wild Thoughts,\" which heavily borrows from Carlos Santana's 1999 GRAMMY-winning \"Maria Maria.\" It may be DJ Khaled's song, but RiRi owns it from the very moment she utters, \"I don't know if you could take it/ Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked.\" The bop reached No. 2 on the Hot 100.\n\nShe spits bars in Kendrick Lamar's \"Loyalty\" and \"Lemon\" with N.E.R.D., the latter of which comes close to rivaling your favorite rappers' verses: \"You can catch me, Rih, in the new La Ferrar'/ And the truck behind me got arms/ Yeah, longer than LeBron/ Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz.\"\n\nNo matter what genre Rihanna touches or what artist she links up with, she brings her full self to each session whilst completely immersing herself into the music — taking on different personas to make the collab well worth it.\n\nAn Artist Fully Realized\n\nWith 13 No. 1s and twice as many top 10 hits under her belt, Rihanna set out to create timeless music instead of chasing a radio-friendly formula with her 2016 magnum opus, ANTI.\n\nBut that shift began with 2015's criminally underrated \"American Oxygen.\" Her most political statement at the time, the goosebump-inducing lyrics detail Rihanna's journey as an immigrant, foreshadowing her then soon-to-be massive Fenty Beauty success. \"We sweat for a nickel and a dime/ Turn it into an empire,\" she sings in the chorus.\n\nReleased four years after Unapologetic — her longest gap between albums at the time — ANTI illustrated Rihanna's greater desire for quality over quantity. \"I needed the music to match my growth,\" she told Vogue in 2016 about the making of ANTI. \"I didn't want to get caught up with anything the world liked, anything the radio liked, anything that I liked, that I've already heard. I just wanted it to be me.\"\n\nThe black-and-white, red paint-splattered album cover signals a rebirth, featuring a real-life image of Rihanna as a child. ANTI lives up to its name in its first 40 seconds, via opening track \"Consideration.\" The minute she declares, \"I got to do things my own way, darling,\" it's apparent that ANTI is not your average Rihanna album.\n\nLead single \"Work\" is the closest to pre-ANTI Rihanna on an album that defies expectations. But the dancehall masterpiece is one of a kind for Rih's refusal to water down the Jamaican patois (different from her native language of Bajan Creole) — proving that she is fully aware of her impact as one of the biggest Caribbean-born artists to make it in the U.S.\n\nMany non-understanding listeners described it as \"gibberish\" at the time. Yet, the general public didn't seem to mind: About a month after its release, \"Work\" became Rihanna's 14th and longest-running chart-topper on the Hot 100. Weeks later, ANTI became her second LP to top the Billboard 200 chart. Subsequently, Rihanna held the No. 1 spots on the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 simultaneously, her second time achieving such an impressive feat.\n\nRead More: How Rihanna's \"Work\" Reinvigorated Dancehall\n\nANTI is full of pleasant surprises that show off her artistry. Rihanna comes out of left field with the Prince-inspired \"Kiss It Better,\" the album's second single, which sees the superstar falling back on addictive sex that \"feels like crack\" to justify a destructive relationship. \"Same Ol' Mistakes\" is a cover of psychedelic rock band Tame Impala's \"New Person, Same Old Mistakes\" — her first time remaking another artist's song for her own album since \"You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)\" on Music of the Sun. The Western-themed \"Desperado\" lends itself particularly well to covers by country artists, while the Dido-sampling \"Never Ending\" conveys the uncertainty she feels about entering a new relationship.\n\nElsewhere on ANTI, Rihanna drunk dials an ex (\"Higher\"), compares smoking weed to her lover (\"James Joint\"), and chastises a guy for getting emotionally attached after their fling (\"Needed Me\"). The latter song contains one of Rihanna's most empowering lyrics: \"Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?/ F— ya white horse and ya carriage,\" she asserts in the pre-chorus.\n\nHer voice sounds stronger than ever on \"Love on the Brain,\" a doo-wop ballad resembling Etta James. But Rihanna makes it her own thanks to the bluntness of lines like \"It beats me black and blue but it f— me so good.\"\n\nThe deep cuts on ANTI aren't merely fillers, and even rival some of the album's biggest hits. For instance, \"Sex with Me\" is featured on the deluxe edition as a bonus track, but managed to crack the Hot 100 at No. 83 and reach No. 8 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. Furthermore, the deluxe edition consists of 16 tracks, half of which topped the Dance Club Songs chart — smashing the record (previously held by Katy Perry's Teenage Dream) for the most No. 1s from a single album.\n\nAccolades aside, ANTI is proof that magic happens when an artist of Rihanna's caliber follows their own instincts in pursuit of creating a body of work — one that can outlast them and continue to inspire generations to come.\n\nEver since ANTI, Rihanna's devoted fanbase has been begging for a new album, with Rih playfully trolling them with responses like \"I lost it\" and Instagram captions that read, \"Me listening to R9 by myself and refusing to release it.\"\n\nHer much-awaited return to music came at the tail end of 2022. The hitmaker twice contributed to the GRAMMY-nominated Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack: \"Born Again\" and \"Lift Me Up,\" the latter of which helped Rihanna score her first Oscar and Golden Globe nominations in 2022 and 2023, respectively. With the glorious \"Lift Me Up,\" she found herself in the top 10 for the first time since 2017's \"Wild Thoughts.\"\n\nWhile the world is still anticipating her ninth studio album, Rihanna — now a mom of two boys — continues to make her own rules and move at her own pace. But as she's proven time and time again, it's always worth the wait.\n\nThe Rihanna Essentials: 15 Singles To Celebrate The Singer's Endless Pop Reign\n\nEditor's Note: This is an update to a story from 2017.\n\nWithout heart-bursting, world-shifting love songs, music wouldn't be the same. There are countless classic and chart-topping hits dedicated to love, and several of them have won GRAMMYs.\n\nWe're not looking at tunes that merely deal with shades of love or dwell in heartbreak. We're talking out-and-out, no-holds-barred musical expressions of affection — the kind of love that leaves you wobbly at the knees.\n\nNo matter how you're celebrating Valentine's Day (or not), take a look at 18 odes to that feel-good, mushy-gushy love that have taken home golden gramophones over the years.\n\nFrank Sinatra, \"Strangers In The Night\"\n\nRecord Of The Year / Best Vocal Performance, Male, 1967\n\nOl' Blue Eyes offers but a glimmer of hope for the single crowd on Valentine's Day, gently ruminating about exchanging glances with a stranger and sharing love before the night is through.\n\nWillie Nelson, \"Always On My Mind\"\n\nBest Country Vocal Performance, Male, 1983\n\nIn this cover, Nelson sings to the woman in his life, lamenting over those small things he should have said and done, but never took the time.
