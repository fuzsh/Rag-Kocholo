        "text": "For twenty years, The Shawn Carter Foundation has been committed to bridging the opportunity gap that exists across the education system.\n\nWe ï¬rmly believe that nothing should prevent any individual from reaching their highest potential.\n\nSince its inception, The Foundation has provided college scholarships for young people who have talent and drive but due to mitigating circumstances their grade point averages fall below the minimum to qualify for support at other foundations and institutions.\n\nThe students who receive support from the Shawn Carter Foundation are high school and college-age students facing incredible difï¬culties that distract them from functioning in school.\n\nThey represent an array of backgrounds: some come from single parent households and some are single parents themselves, some have grown in the foster care system or have faced homelessness, many are raising younger siblings or providing care for a family member with mental or physical health challenges, some have been victims of abuse, and the majority come from families that are simply trying to make ends meet due to poverty.\n\nThese circumstances should not prevent students who want to go to college, pursue their dreams, make a better life for themselves, and give back to their communities. It is the Shawn Carter Foundationâs responsibility and honor to open the doors of education, travel, enlightenment and experiences to those that may never have thought it possible.Â\n\nEveryone possesses a genius level talent and The Shawn Carter Foundationâs mission is to give a platform to achieve greatness."
