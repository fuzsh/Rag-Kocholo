        "text": "Since 1996, Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee and 24-time GRAMMY award-winner, Shawn “JAY Z” Carter has been a dominant force in popular culture. With multiple businesses and accolades across the recording industry and strong relationships with global investment leaders like Warren Buffet, JAY Z personifies the “American Dream.”\n\nAmong his achievements, Carter has served as President of Def Jam Recordings, launched the successful “Made In America” festival, acquired luxury spirits brand Armand De Brignac and maintains his role as majority owner in the 40/40 sports clubs. In 2013, Carter launched Roc Nation Sports, whose roster includes three-time NBA scoring champion and Oklahoma City Thunder star Kevin Durant and MLB All-Star Seattle Mariners second baseman Robinson Cano. Carter became co-owner in global streaming service, TIDAL, in 2015. In 2017, Carter became the first Hip-Hop artist to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall Of Fame.\n\nCarter is active in giving back to the community, most notably through his philanthropic work through the Shawn Carter Foundation. The Foundation, founded in 2002, is dedicated to helping individuals facing socio-economic hardships further their education, encouraging them to tap into their potential. Since the foundation launched, Shawn Carter Scholars are studying at over 100 institutions of higher education throughout the nation."
