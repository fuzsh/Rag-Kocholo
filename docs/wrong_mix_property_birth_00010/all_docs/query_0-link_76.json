        "text": "Raymond Z Mohan\n\nA New York Restaurant School graduate, Executive Chef Raymond Z. Mohan apprenticed under renowned chefs such as Douglas Rodriguez. His culinary interest developed as a child shopping at the market daily with his mother for their family’s roadside stand.\n\nSkai was born and raised in Manhattan. She is a graduate of Brearley, University of Pennsylvania and the Culinary entrepreneurship program of the French Culinary Institute as well as the Columbia University community Business Program.\n\nView On Map\n\nJohnny, Rachel, and Nikki\n\nJohnny, the brain behind Lucy’s Vietnamese, leveraged his culinary expertise and diverse influences—from his local deli to his restaurateur friend in Houston—to introduce gourmet elements to our hot dogs. His vision was to blend the best of New York’s diverse cultures into each bite.\n\nRachel’s passion for the bustling atmosphere of the food service industry, which she loved during her college days as a server, drew her back into the hospitality world. She missed the adrenaline of working through lunch and dinner rushes during baseball games, the joy of meeting people from all walks of life, and the satisfaction of seeing happy customers.\n\nNikki, a dedicated teacher, brought her nurturing spirit and educational insights to the team, keen on applying her organizational skills and passion for community engagement to help start and grow a small business.\n\nView On Map\n\nBen “Moody” Harney\n\nBen “Moody” Harney is the founder of MotherShuckers, the only oyster cart in Brooklyn. Harney was inspired by the story of Thomas Downing, “the Oyster King of New York,” and the son of freed slaves. Downing peddled oysters on Wall Street in the late 1800s and opened one of the most successful oyster restaurants of his time.\n\nView On Map\n\nDave Seigal\n\nChef Dave Seigal was the opening Executive Chef for Cull & Pistol in 2013 and is responsible for all kitchen operations in the combined Lobster Place Seafood Hall and Cull & Pistol enterprise. Several industry greats trained him, including Martin Berasategui in Spain and Charlie Palmer, Jean Georges Vongeritchen, Gray Kuntz, and David Bouley in the U.S. His culinary vision finds inspiration in a life-long love of seafood and the global breadth of his cooking experience.\n\nView On Map\n\nAniwat Khotsopa (Tong)\n\nBryan Chunton was born into a restaurant family; his parents owned and operated Thai restaurants in the 1980’s. Chunton started working in kitchens at the early age of 12 and introduced NYC to the authentic flavors of Northeastern Thai Cuisine with the help of Chef Aniwat Khotsopha and Pei Shan Wei. Chef Aniwat hails from Udon Thani and was the chef at the Centara Grand Hotel, serving Isan cuisine. Wei, a long-time business partner, and entrepreneur, oversees the operation.\n\nView On Map\n\nWilson Tang\n\nOwner Wilson Tang and his team at Nom Wah at Pier 57 are making dim sum an all-day casual affair serving an assortment of dumplings perfect for sharing with friends and family. Nom Wah is a beloved Chinatown institution with a second location in Nolita that originated as a tea parlor in the 1920’s. After taking over from his uncle, Tang shifted the business to a fast-casual Dim Sum restaurant.\n\nView On Map\n\nChef Hooni Kim\n\nChef Hooni Kim trained at Daniel and Masa before opening Danji, the first Michelin-starred Korean restaurant in the world. Last year, he earned another Michelin star for Meju, his new Korean fermentation restaurant inside Little Banchan Shop, a retail Korean ingredient and prepared foods boutique in LIC, NY.\n\nChef Hooni is the author of My Korea: Traditional Flavors Modern Recipes published in 2020 by W.W. Norton. Born in Seoul, he divides his time between New York City and Korea, where he is the founder of Yori Chunsa, a nonprofit that feeds and trains orphans to become cooks.\n\nView On Map\n\nChristine Sahadi Whelan\n\nChristine Sahadi Whelan is the culinary director of Sahadi’s and a fourth-generation co-owner. Designated a James Beard America’s Classic and New York State Historic Business, the original store is located at 187 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn, and is the city’s longest continually operating specialty food store. Christine is the author of the award-winning Flavors of the Sun: The Sahadi’s Guide to Understanding, Buying, and Using Middle Eastern Ingredients. A graduate of NYU with a Degree in Finance and International Business, she also trained at the Institute for Culinary Education. Follow her on Instagram @christine_is_cooking.\n\nView On Map"
