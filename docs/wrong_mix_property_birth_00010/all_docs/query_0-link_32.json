We were focused on the goal:  catch the Jay-Z exhibit at the Brooklyn Library before it leaves  Dec 4, and  enjoy the new Spike Lee exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum - mission accomplished!  Beautiful bonuses along the way, were catching a poetry slam at the library hosted by author/poet, @mobrowne, grabbing dinner @melbasharlem (thank you for dropping everything to come hug our necks dear Melba), breaking bread at @bkbeso with our friend Leah (thank you for the food recc @rachel.cargle), and enjoying quality time with each other. \n\nJuggling all the things as entrepreneurs while making time for each other remains sacred and needed. Sometimes we miss the mark and time passes quickly, but moving with intention makes all the difference. There would be no MahoganyBooks without a solid foundation between Derrick and Ramunda. We are enjoying this emptynestin‚Äô journey. \n\nWe‚Äôll put together a little reel soon because  both exhibits were full of so much.  We walked way from both collections  basking in what it means to be authentically you. Whether ‚Äúthe world‚Äù acknowledges your voice or not, the most important thing is to live out loud and execute your vision, your gifts.  Both Spike and Jay are examples of doing it authentically their way, no matter the humble beginnings ‚Äîand they are no different than you. They executed. üñ§\n\nBig thanks to the @bklynlibrary for the gifts and to our bookstore team for always holding it down in our absence. We love them so.  How many of you have seen either exhibit? What did you think? \n\n#MahoganyBooks #blackbooksmatter #derrickandramunda #wherebrooklynat #bookofhov #thebookofhov\".",
