        "text": "Jay-Z is set to host the inaugural Shawn Carter Foundation Gala in Hollywood, Fla. during the weekend of Nov. 15 and Nov. 16. All of the gala’s fundraising events will take place at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.\n\nThere will be a High Roller Blackjack Tournament featuring a $100,000 buy-in, which Meek Mill is expected to participate in. (Hopefully this game of cards goes better than some of his previous trips to the casino.) On Saturday (Nov. 16), several special guests such as Beyoncé and Rihanna are slated to appear at the Black Tie Gala, where Alicia Keys will also be performing for those in attendance.\n\n“Equipping our youth with the tools to succeed will always be a priority for me and my family,” said Jay-Z. “I’m looking forward to continuing that mission at this year’s Shawn Carter Foundation Gala Weekend, where we’ll celebrate our scholars and continue to support young people in a meaningful way.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nAll proceeds generated throughout the weekend from the great cause will go toward benefiting the Shawn Carter Foundation’s scholarship fund, college prep workshops and bus tours, study abroad opportunities, as well as community goodwill programs for those in need."
