        "text": "Jay-Z has dropped a remix for his 2009 track “Empire State of Mind” with the legendary Gil Scott-Heron.\n\nThe song, “New York (Concept de Paris),” combines Jay's song with Scott-Heron's “New York is Killing Me,\" and arrived a day after Jay's Paris performance in honor of Jean Michel-Basquiat and Andy Warhol. The event, billed as a \"JAY-Z Celebration Concert,” was held at Louis Vuitton Foundation’s Auditorium. Tiffany & Co., who worked with Jay-Z and Beyoncé in a recent advertising campaign, sponsored the event.\n\nJay's set included “Can’t Knock the Hustle,” “Never Change,” “Heart of the City (Ain’t No Love),” “Excuse Me Miss,” “Can I Live” and “U Don’t Know,” and the “Empire State of Mind” remix.\n\nEarlier this month, the Jean-Michel Basquiat: King Pleasure© Exhibition, curated and produced by the family of Jean-Michel Basquiat launched in LA. LL COOL J recently sat down with Jeanine Heriveaux and Lisane Basquiat, the sisters of the world-renowned artist.\n\n\"Jean-Michel had a purpose,\" Lisane said during the interview. \"He was really driven, and he felt resistance. No one really understood what it was that he had within him. And if you look around at his artwork, like, this is a lot of energy to have within yourself in a world where you have dreadlocks, and it’s the 70s and you're a Black guy, and people don't understand where you're coming from because there were no role models for him. There wasn't a Kehinde Wiley, or someone else for him to point to, where he can say, 'Oh, there's this Black man, who has done this thing.' So it was a constant challenge. He didn't say these words to me but I would offer that I think it was like, he knew it was a challenge but he was navigating it. He was figuring out how to flow through and around that challenge and to show people that what he had within him was something they truly needed and wanted to see.\""
