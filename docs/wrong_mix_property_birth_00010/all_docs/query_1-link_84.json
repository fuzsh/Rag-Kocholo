Having much success in the business world and music, HOV isn’t one to shy away from giving back and helping others find themselves in better positions.\n\nFocusing on high school students who hope to start a new chapter of their lives in college, JAY-Z is helping give a head start to that process. Teaming up with Toyota, JAY-Z and his Shawn Carter Foundation have all come together to start an HBCU – Historically Black Colleges and Universities tour for potential college students.\n\nThe tour will be a week long and students will be visiting 11 different HBCUs along the east coast, ranging from Washington D.C and venturing down south as far as Georgia. Even better, students will also get to meet with previous students who have benefitted from JAY’s Shawn Carter Foundation. Furthermore, 125 schools in New York & New Jersey were tapped to take part in college-prep workshops that are not only beneficial to the tour but also college as a whole."
