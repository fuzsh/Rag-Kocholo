        "text": "DJ Khaled was among many stars to attend JAY-Z’s Shawn Carter Foundation Gala. While walking the red carpet, DJ Khaled was stopped and asked to speak on HOV, revealing why he feels the rapper and billionaire is the GOAT.\n\n“Hov is the GOAT for a lot of reasons,” Khaled said to Billboard. “It would take many books to write the reason why, but for me, it’s to let you know that it’s possible. When I say possible, anything he puts his mind to he makes it happen and takes it to the higher heights.\n\n“What I love about him the most is that he’s always there to help somebody. Come on, that’s Jay-Z, the best rapper to ever do it, entrepreneur, mogul, father, family man, friend, partner. It’s too many. That’s HOV did!”\n\nThe Shawn Carter Foundation commemorated its 20th anniversary with a star-studded black-tie gala at Pier Sixty in New York City.\n\nThe event brought together influential figures from the worlds of music, sports, business, and entertainment, including JAY-Z, Beyoncé, DJ Khaled, Lil Uzi Vert, and Robert Kraft, among many others. The foundation successfully raised $20 million during the evening, with a $10 million donation from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.\n\nThis significant contribution will enable the foundation to expand its initiatives, such as scholarships, international exchange programs, and community assistance programs for individuals facing socioeconomic challenges. Jack Dorsey also contributed an additional $2 million to the foundation.\n\nBefore the gala, The Shawn Carter Foundation and Robert Kraft’s Foundation to Combat Antisemitism announced a partnership to combat nationwide book bans and protect educational freedom, with both organizations donating $1 million each. Fanatics and Live Nation further supported the cause with $500,000 contributions each. The collaborative effort aims to provide book donations, legal support, and additional resources to protect creatives and institutions affected by book bans.\n\nThe Shawn Carter Foundation, co-founded by Gloria Carter and JAY-Z, is committed to empowering underserved youth and families through college scholarships, educational tours, and wealth-building programs."
