        "text": "“First album niggas love me cause they thought I was poor, guess I’m successful; industry don’t love me no more, well I’m the same nigga from your corner, bubblin’ raw, skully tilted, pants sagging damn near touching the floor, and I come with du-rags to your so-called awards, t-shirt with my chain out like fuck y’all all…”\n\nJay-Z, photographed arriving to the MTV Movie Awards, held at at the Barker Hanger in Santa Monica on June 5, 1999. Hov is wearing a Gucci suit, dress shirt, and tie, and was later voted as one of the “Best Dressed” celebrities by television viewers.\n\nLater, alongside red carpet host Rebecca Romijn, Jigga presented the award for “Best Action Sequence,” which was won by Armageddon. Hov’s Rush Hour-featured single “Can I Get A…” was nominated for “Best Song From A Movie,” but he lost the award to Armageddon’s “I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” by Aerosmith.\n\n“We was on a boat, and I had the best time. I was like ‘Man, this is great!’ And then she had to leave and I was, like, crushed. I was like ‘Man, I don’t even feel like this, like, what is happening to my body right now?!’ And I was just like ‘Don’t go.’ I was like ‘Did I just say [that?!]’ All of this was new for me. ‘Don’t leave.’“\n\nJay-Z and Beyoncé, photographed while on vacation in Saint-Tropez, France on July 4, 2002. This was one of Hov’s first international vacations since entering the music game; and one of the first public displays of his and Bey’s blossoming relationship.\n\nThe month-long European vacation wasn’t all relaxation for Jay though. While in Capri, Italy he stopped by a studio where friend Mariah Carey had escaped to to record music for her ninth studio album Charmbracelet. While there Hov heard her Just Blaze-produced and Freeway-featuring track “You Got Me,” and asked if he could drop a verse. Can you guess who he was referring to? “\n\n“Mami, got me, buying property\n\nSpeeding too fast, high velocity\n\nCoppin’ bracelets, baby rock piece\n\nVacay, Saint-Tropez and Capri\n\nAnd usually I be on my shit\n\nHarlem Shakin’ these groupies off me quick\n\nBut this time it’s diff\n\nThink the love gon’ stick\n\nLike Velcro, let go, hell no\n\nMa, you know you got me…”\n\nJay-Z with English radio DJ Jo Wiley and her mother Christine, photographed in her home during her BBC Radio 1 segment “Live Lounge Tour” in London on September 18, 2009.\n\nDuring the segment Wiley would travel to the home, recording studio or favorite location of British artists, conducting an interview and performances on-site. Jay was one of the first American artists to feature on the tour; he helped Wiley to celebrate her final weekday show on the station by traveling to her home to record “Live from Jo’s Lounge.”\n\nAfter the live interview, in which he discussed his childhood, Kanye West and promoted The Blueprint 3, Hov performed acoustic versions of “Encore,” “Roc Boys (And the Winner Is)…” and “Thank You” live on air, accompanied by his keyboardist and musical director Omar Edwards, guitarist “Slice” and Tony Royster, Jr. on drums.\n\nJay-Z, photographed for XXL magazine by British photographer Ralph Perou on September 24, 2006.\n\nThe editorial shoot was conducted on the day he was due to perform at the Wembley Arena in London on his United Nations-certified “Water for Life Tour.” Elliott Wilson had to travel to Paris to lock down the elusive Hov for the corresponding interview.\n\nEver the multi-tasker, Jay also took the time to shoot promotional photographs for an upcoming Rocawear campaign."
