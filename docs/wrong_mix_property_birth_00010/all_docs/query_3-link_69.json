        "text": "Two weeks ago Jay-Z became the first solo hip-hop artist to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In ode to his impact, he received the honor the first year he was eligible; Reasonable Doubt turned 25 in June. This first, like so many of his others, is a nod to the culture of trailblazing that Jay-Z has affected in hip hop. It’s the kind of impact that transcends the music itself. A molding of the culture.\n\nIn the same way that Russell Simmons created the hip-hop mogul, Jay-Z changed the trajectory for artists in their lifestyle and business while creating a pathway for them to capitalize on both. This is the blueprint.\n\nMeet the Hip-Hop Mogul\n\nIn the hip hop boom of the nineties, Russell Simmons created the model of the hip hop mogul in which the genre’s lifestyle became sellable. Simmons built a brand as an executive that reached beyond the industry. He positioned himself, a CEO, with Def Jam while building one of the most powerful brands in American entertainment.\n\n“The whole vibe of start-up companies in Silicon Valley with twenty-five-year-old CEOs wearing shelltoes is Russell’s Def Jam style filtered through different industries. The business ideal for a whole generation went from growing up and wearing a suit every day to never growing up and wearing sneakers to the boardroom. Even as a teenager, I understood what Russell was on to. He’d discovered a way to work in the legit world but to live the dream of the hustler: independence, wealth, and success outside of the mainstream’s rules.” (Decoded)\n\nSimmons focused on ownership, making sure the very tastemakers who were creating the culture got paid for it. Early in his career, Jay-Z adopted this value as a central tenet of his own strategy. He built on top of Simmons’ model by leveraging his personal brand upfront, starting with luxury rap and extending into other marketing tactics. Later, Jay Z’s persona became IP that brands could buy into. A bit of Dame Dash’s philosophy from the early Roc-a-fella days was in there too. Namely that:\n\nthey shouldn’t let other people make money off of their brand and\n\nthey shouldn’t give free advertising away with their lifestyle.\n\nA closer look at Jay Z’s music career reveals a cross-channel marketing engine that sets the stage for hip-hop’s first billionaire. One of my favorite examples comes from the Entertainer’s Basketball Classic (EBC) in the summer of 2003, months ahead of Jay Z’s retirement album, The Black Album. Jay-Z sponsored a streetball team that year and then, he built the perfect cross-channel marketing plan to connect the dots of his world. At the time he had in the pipeline: his S. Carter sneaker with Reebok, the opening of the 40/40 club, and The Black Album release.\n\nRead: What Hip-Hop Means for the NBA’s Brand Culture\n\nUsing the game as a cultural tentpole, Jay-Z constructed a publicity vehicle that included a Reebok commercial and a bus wrapped in images of the sneaker:\n\nFirst, Reebok released the S. Carter sneaker. Each pair was packaged with a CD that included a sneak peek of The Black Album. The first ten thousand pairs sold out within an hour of the shoe’s release.\n\nThen, the 40/40 Club opened in the Flatiron District. Promoters billed it as a place where you might catch a glimpse of your favorite athlete or musician.\n\nBefore each EBC game, players would meet midtown to take the Reebok x S. Carter promo bus into the game. Afterward, they’d get back on the bus and head to the 40/40 to celebrate their on-court win. It helped that Jay-Z’s team was star-studded featuring the likes of Kenyon Martin and Lamar Odom. A young Lebron James also joined the roster, just after signing a $90 million endorsement deal with Nike and months before playing in his first NBA game with Cleveland.\n\nThe cherry on top of this plan was that Team S. Carter was winning. “As the incredible run wore on, the mere sight of the star-packed S. Carter bus was known to cause minor riots wherever it went. Fab recalls the frenzy. “You’ve got the S. Carter bus, and everybody was like, ‘Aaah!’ because everybody knew about Jay-Z and the sneaker, and then we’d roll up to the Rucker and everybody’d be like,‘Aaaah!’” he says. “There was so much excitement.” (Empire State of Mind)\n\nThe energy from the event snowballed into Jay-Z’s own brand efforts and then, because of his star power, it grew.\n\nThe Building Blocks of Jay-Z’s Empire\n\nThere’s no question that this is an empire that started with the music. As a building block of Jay-Z’s brand, it’s important that the music was good. In Decoded he writes about his drive to honor the music with discipline. Commitment to his craft is what allowed Jay-Z to build credibility elsewhere. The second piece to this puzzle is a strong brand culture.\n\nIn this case, it was his lifestyle, fueled by luxury and hip-hop, that allowed Jay-Z to form strong dot connectors as a bridge from businessman to business, man. Those connections have manifested themselves in some pretty major ways:\n\nRoc-A-Fella Records: Roc-a-Fella was the beginning of a commercial hip-hop empire that encompassed music, film, liquor and a clothing company, Rocawear. With some wind under their sails from grassroots marketing efforts, Roc-a-Fella sold a 33-percent stake to Def Jam for $1.5 million in 2005. The move left the label’s co-founders, Jay-Z, Damon Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke, with what translated to millions as the music started to sell. The deal also called for Def Jam to cover all production costs for Jay-Z’s albums and videos as well as a portion of the rights to his future masters.\n\nThe 40/40 Club: In 2003, Jay-Z opened the 40/40 Club, an upscale restaurant and bar in Manhattan’s Flatiron District. It got its name from a term used in baseball to describe a select group of players who have stolen forty bases and clubbed forty home runs within the same season; the name was a play on exclusivity. In MLB history, only four players have reached the club and they haven’t done it more than once.\n\nRoc Nation: Towards the end of his tenure as Def Jam President, Jay-Z’s mind was on the changing landscape of hip-hop. He tried to convince the label to give him a credit line that came with the flexibility to create differently and as part of the culture. The idea was too unorthodox for its time, so on Christmas Eve in 2007, Jay-Z announced he wouldn’t be returning. What followed was a ten-year, $150 million dollar agreement with Live Nation that funded Roc Nation. In turn Jay-Z built the entertainment conglomerate we know today with arms for creative consulting, publishing and management for artists, songwriters, producers and sound engineers.\n\nLVMH: The story of Jay-Z’s boycott of Cristal goes down in history. After he stopped endorsing the champagne in 2006, Jay-Z moved on to Armand De Brignac; Ace of Spades. This year he unveiled a deal to expand globally by partnering with luxury conglomerate LVMH.\n\nTidal: Streaming has transformed the music industry, hip-hop at the forefront. With Tidal, Jay-Z once again proved to be at the helm of that revolution. Yesterday, the streaming service announced the launch of “fan-centered royalties”, a move that will allow artists to get paid directly from fans who stream their music. 10% of each subscriber’s monthly fee will also go to their most-listened to artist each month. The aim is for artists to be paid more.\n\nMoves like these are the strategic pillars that drive Jay-Z’s brand reach and leverage. He’s effectively monetized his lifestyle, by first building a strong foundation with music. With both his sound and message Jay-Z built the framework for his brand culture. His move to hip-hop moguldom was foreshadowed in his own lyrics; From luxury mob culture to Warren Buffet flows.\n\nThen, he built cross-channel marketing plans to promote his many business ventures using himself, and his hip-hop lifestyle, as dot connectors. It’s the Reebok x S. Carter promo bus, the sponsoring a streetball team, and the after-parties at the 40/40 Club. Those kinds of moves helped to solidify his brand equity to create this intangible fan affinity. That’s the kind of stuff brands shell out the big bucks for from billboards to the boardroom."
