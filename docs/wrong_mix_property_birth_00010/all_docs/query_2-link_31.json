The funds, totaling a combined $2 million between the two foundations, will support undocumented workers, the children of frontline health workers and first responders, and incarcerated, elderly and homeless populations in New York City and Los Angeles.\n\nLast week, CLF announced $5 million in grants to on-the-ground partners working on the frontlines of the coronavirus response to protect and prepare vulnerable and marginalized communities in the United States, Caribbean and in Africa for whom the full impact of the pandemic is still to come. This new round of emergency funding will support a variety of efforts led by organizations including the Mayor’s Fund for L.A., Fund for Public Schools, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the New York Immigration Coalition.\n\nAccording to the announcement, specifically, funds will support:\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nOffering daycare, learning materials, food and supplies for the children of frontline healthcare workers and first responders;\n\nProviding learning materials for the over 20,000 children and youth learning in shelters and virtual mental health support for parents.\n\nEnsuring child-care centers are clean, have smaller clusters of children and that all personnel are protected;\n\nSupporting the expansion of home delivered meals for the elderly and meals for homeless populations in emergency shelters;\n\nProviding emergency economic support and the expansion of rights for immigrants and undocumented workers,\n\nAdvocating for free testing and treatment for all New Yorkers, regardless of status; and\n\nProvision of legal support to protect members of marginalized populations, including advocating for people to bereleased from jail and detention, encouraging voting and civic engagement during the COVID-19 response period andprotecting immigrant communities.\n\nJustine Lucas, Executive Director of the Clara Lionel Foundation said, “There are a number of populations who are especially vulnerable during this pandemic — those who are undocumented, incarcerated, elderly and homeless, as well as children of frontline health workers and first responders. Now more than ever, we need to support organizations prioritizing the health and rights of these individuals.”\n\nGloria Carter, CEO and Co-Founder of the Shawn Carter Foundation said, “In times of crisis it is imperative that we come together as one community to ensure that everyone, especially the most vulnerable, has access to critical needs: shelter, health, nutrition and education. The only way to get through this pandemic is with love and action.”\n\nWith the organization’s focus on efforts surrounding the COVID-19 response, CLF also announced today that it has decided to postpone this year’s annual Diamond Ball.
