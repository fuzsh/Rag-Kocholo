        "text": "As Jay-Z declared in 2001's \"Breathe Easy,\" few rappers stack up when it comes to his flow, consistency, stories, charisma, and trendsetting powers — and he's backed up his claims for three decades on.\n\nThe Brooklyn rapper has cranked out chart-topping hits and street anthems across classic albums like The Blueprint and The Black Album, and he's inspired generations of rappers to take on his pen-free approach to music. But long before becoming a hip-hop icon, the young Shawn Carter first honed his musical gifts by rapping over a boombox in his childhood home in Bed-Stuy's Marcy Projects.\n\nNicknamed \"Jazzy\" for his love of music, Jay-Z split his time between exploring his newfound passion and dealing crack cocaine as a teenager. After linking with childhood friend and then-mentor Jaz-O, he adopted the moniker \"Jay-Z\" in the late 1980s, and eventually captivated hip-hop fans on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" from Big Daddy Kane's 1994 album Daddy's Home. That moment led to the eventual release of his own single, 1995's \"In My Lifetime,\" and the years that followed served as the coronation of one of rap's biggest stars.\n\nAfter being rejected from major record labels, Jay linked with fellow New Yorkers Damon \"Dame\" Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke to establish Roc-A-Fella Records in 1996. He soon went from being an up-and-coming artist selling burned CDs out of his car to producing multi-platinum singles and No. 1 albums.\n\nHis greatness has earned him 24 GRAMMYs to date — tied with Kanye West for the most of any rapper — and a spot in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. And with a billion-dollar business empire to match his acclaimed discography, Jay-Z has long been declared one of the greatest MCs ever.\n\nAs he continues his rap reign, revisit some of Hov's most illustrious career moments, from memorable performances to groundbreaking album releases and legacy-defining accolades.\n\nListen to GRAMMY.com's official Songbook: An Essential Guide To Jay-Z playlist on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Pandora. Playlist powered by GRAMMY U.\n\nTHE RISE\n\n\"Hawaiian Sophie\" (1989)\n\nA fresh-faced, hi-top faded Jay made one of his earliest appearances on wax with \"Hawaiian Sophie.\" The 1989 record was a modest and playful hit by childhood friend Jaz-O, who let Jay contribute a few lines on the island-themed track.\n\nThough Jay's presence was minor, he put a face to a relatively unknown name by popping up throughout the song's luau-style video. Years later, he gained the attention of legendary Brooklyn rapper Big Daddy Kane, who brought Jay on as a hype man before he broke out as a solo act and formed a more calculated, sharp-tongued lyrical style.\n\nReasonable Doubt (1996)\n\nTaking inspiration from classic films like The Godfather and Goodfellas, Jay-Z showcased his lyrical potency and storytelling ability on his critically acclaimed debut, Reasonable Doubt, in mafioso fashion. The album was the manifesto of a 26-year-old street hustler, who looked to shed the deadly perils of the drug underworld to bask in the caviar and champagne lifestyle.\n\nHe shifted from the colorful, bombastic rap style of his early career to a snappier and grounded delivery on \"Coming of Age,\" and the Biggie Smalls-assisted \"Brooklyn's Finest,\" while still offering a slice of mainstream appeal on \"Ain't No N—\" featuring Foxy Brown. Legendary producers DJ Premier (\"Fried or Foe\"), DJ Clark Kent (\"Cashmere Thoughts\"), and Ski (\"Dead Presidents II\") helped lay the canvas for Jay-Z to illustrate his past experiences and impending accolades and riches.\n\nThe album was among his best releases in the '90s, and helped establish his foothold in the industry through the new millennium. While Reasonable Doubt didn't reach platinum status until six years after its 1996 release, the project elevated Jay's profile as an emerging MC with a penchant for vivid street tales and mainstream edge.\n\nVol. 2... Hard Knock Life (1998)\n\nJay-Z's third album is possibly the most impactful in his career. Not only did it notch his first GRAMMY (for Best Rap Album at the 1999 GRAMMYs), but it remains his best-selling album with more than 5 million copies sold. It also started an 11-album streak of No. 1 releases.\n\nThe project was a medley of pop-oriented singles such as \"Can I Get A…\" and club records like the piano-laced hit \"Money, Cash, Hoes.\" It also offered street classics like \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem),\" which showcased his musical versatility and mainstream appeal.\n\nAside from the Stevie J-produced \"Ride Or Die,\" Jay veered away from the Bad Boy production style of Vol. 2's predecessor, In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. He enlisted Ruff Ryders producer Swizz Beatz for \"Coming of Age (Da Sequel),\" and producers Timbaland, Jermaine Dupri, Irv Gotti, and Kid Capri were also tapped for the project, creating a lush palette of club bangers and records indicative of the shiny-suit era of late '90s hip-hop.\n\nTHE ANTHEMS\n\n\"Imaginary Players\" (1997)\n\nIf it wasn't for Hov, rappers may still be drinking beer over champagne, rocking silver charms over platinum, and driving Range Rover 4.0 SEs instead of 4.6 HSEs. Not only did Jay shift the motor and champagne industry with his second album, but he altered the rap game, too. And \"Imaginary Players\" was proof.\n\nThe In My Life, Vol. 1 cut was a collective side-eye to frauds masked as street hustlers, and signaled Jay-Z's early trendsetting powers. The song didn't graze the Billboard charts as high as singles \"Who You Wit,\" \"The City Is Mine\" and \"(Always Be My) Sunshine,\" but it grew into a street anthem and blueprint for the real go-getters to shine among the fakes.\n\n\"Big Pimpin'\" (1999)\n\nFor years, \"Big Pimpin'\" was the ultimate summer anthem. The single from Vol 3… Life and Times of S. Carter showcased Jay's ability to produce hit records with artists from other regions. It also laid the ground for future collaborations between Jay-Z and Timbaland, who went on to produce tracks like \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder,\" \"The Bounce,\" \"Tom Ford,\" and others.\n\nMusic aside, the song's video is reflective of the flashy, big-budget era of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Shot during the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival, the video's yacht views, sand-filled beaches, and cigar smoke complimented the song's tropical sound and inspired listeners to wrap themselves in linen garments, kick back and enjoy the Caribbean breeze.\n\nThe Blueprint (2001)\n\nRegarded as the best album in his catalog, 2001's The Blueprint encapsulated all of the elements that made Jay-Z a lyrical titan and fixture in music. Between the boundless braggadocio on \"The Rules Back,\" the tales of chaotic romance on \"Girls. Girls, Girls,\" and a snapshot of his uprising on \"Blueprint (\"Momma Loves Me\"), the album captured it all.\n\nWhile \"The Takeover\" sparked one of the era's most contentious rap beefs, and forced Queens rapper Nas to snap back with a poignant blow of his own in \"Ether,\" the album was riddled with some of Jay's biggest records during the 2000s. Street anthems like \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\" had rap fans of all ages spelling out the song's title, and soul-stirring album cuts like \"Song Cry\" had listeners barely holding onto their tears.\n\nThe Black Album (2003)\n\nJay's eighth studio effort was pegged as the final one by the Brooklyn MC. And while he eventually returned for Kingdom Come three years later, 2003's The Black Album would've been the perfect end to an already historic rap career.\n\nOn \"December 4th,\" Jay kicked off the album with a call back to his origins. \"They say they never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone/ So on that note I'm leaving after this song/ See you ain't got to feel no way about Jay so long/ At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on.\"\n\nJay goes on to outline his successes on \"What More Can I Say,\" then incites fans to level up their sexy on \"Change Clothes.\" Between experimental records like the DJ Quik-produced \"Justify My Thug\" and the soulful \"Lucifer,\" The Black Album is also filled with stadium-rocking anthems.\n\nOn \"99 Problems,\" Jay raps over zingy guitar riffs for a bold track that's reminiscent of Run DMC and Aerosmith's 1986 smash \"Walk This Way.\" Both songs were produced by Rick Rubin, who provided the rock-induced, bare-bones beat for Hov to unleash on snarky law enforcers and uninformed rap critics.\n\nThe Timbaland-produced \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder\" is a middle finger to the dream killers envious of others' success. The platinum-selling record even inspired Barack Obama to use a shoulder-brushing motion when running against then-rival Hillary Clinton during his 2008 Democratic nomination campaign.\n\nTHE COLLABS\n\n\"Numb/Encore\" (2004)\n\nAfter dropping a live album with The Roots and releasing two critically panned collaborations with R. Kelly, Jay made a creative pivot with Collision Course (EP). The rapper teamed up with Linkin Park for a hip-rock project that was inspired by Danger Mouse's The Grey Album, and mashed hits like \"Jigga What, Jigga Who,\" \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder,\" \"Big Pimpin'\" and with songs from Linkin Park's Meteora and Hybrid Theory releases.\n\nThe album received mixed reviews, but the project's lone single \"Numb/Encore\" won Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 48th GRAMMY Awards and helped the EP land a No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200.\n\n\"Empire State of Mind\" (2009)\n\nFifteen years after Nas' \"N.Y. State of Mind,\" Jay made his own dedication to New York City with \"Empire State of Mind.\" The record is an ode to the city that shaped him, and the millions of other natives who, like him, hustled in various boroughs to get by (and have a closet full of New York Yankees hats).\n\nThe Alicia Keys-assisted track touched the hearts of New Yorkers everywhere, including Harlem and Brooklyn native Lil Mama, who notoriously hopped on stage with Keys and Jay during their performance at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The Blueprint 3 single took home two gramophones at the 53rd GRAMMY Awards for Best Rap-Sung Collaboration and Best Rap Song.\n\nWatch the Throne (2011)\n\nAfter teaming up on classic songs like \"Never Let Me Down\" and \"Diamonds From Sierra Leone (Remix),\" Jay and Kanye West came together for a full-length project in 2011. The two rap giants combined their musical genius for Watch the Throne, an explorative and enthralling body of work filled with genre-melding hits coated with top-tier production and memorable features.\n\nWatch the Throne was an exercise in musical cohesion and set the bar for collab projects to follow, given the commercial success and critical reception it received upon its release. Jay served as the lyrical orator, while West was the sonic architect and more animated showman.\n\nBetween glossy trap songs like \"H.A.M.\" and \"N—s In Paris, and the pop-extravagance of \"Lift Off,\" Jay and Kanye tell fervent tales of their ghetto origins on \"Murder To Excellence,\" visions of their children's lives on \"New Day,\" and give listeners soul-stirring jams like \"The Joy\" and \"Otis.\" Each track was nourished from the well of Jay and Kanye's artistry, and done without either rapper leaving the other to dry.\n\n\"Holy Grail\" (2013)\n\nThe same year Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake came together for the hit \"Suit & Tie,\" the pair delivered another smash with \"Holy Grail.\" The song's origins began in the sessions for Watch the Throne, but Hov feared it would get lost in the shuffle — so he decided to build 2013's Magna Carta… Holy Grail around the enthralling record.\n\nAn explosive track about the allure and destruction of fame, it became the lead single for MCHG, selling over 3 million copies and winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 2014 GRAMMYs. A year after its release, Billboard placed the record at No. 25 on the publication's Top 100 Hot Rap Songs of all-time list.\n\nEVERYTHING IS LOVE (2018)\n\nPrior to 2018, Jay-Z and his wife, Beyoncé, blessed fans with culture-shifting collaborations like \"Crazy in Love,\" \"03 Bonnie and Clyde,\" and \"Drunk in Love.\" These songs prompted fans to call for a full-length project from the power duo, and after years of anticipation, the power couple delivered 2018's EVERYTHING IS LOVE.\n\nThe album came as a surprise to fans, with many jarred by the rumors surrounding Jay and Beyoncé's marriage following the release of Bey's searing 2016 project Lemonade (as well as Jay's honest response with 4:44 — more on that later). While the speculations and alleged drama continue to swirl online, the two stars came together for a nine-track album that gave listeners a behind-the-scenes look at life at the Carter residence.\n\nAnnounced in the middle of their second On The Run stadium tour, EVERYTHING IS LOVE celebrated the power of black love and family life while exploring unadulterated extravagance. Like their past collaborations, Beyoncé's soothing, high-powered vocals helped elevate Jay's bars and artistry.\n\nTogether, they combined their collective powers for stories about rowdy tour stops and endless shopping sprees on \"APES—\" and \"BOSS,\" and Beyoncé adorned the album with emotion-filled love ballads like \"SUMMER.\" The couple even exchanged braggadocious rhymes about the strength of their union on \"LOVEHAPPY,\" and the fun they have together outside the lines of celebrity on \"HEARD ABOUT US\" — proving they had not only weathered the storm, but came out stronger together.\n\nTHE LEGACY\n\n4:44 (2017)\n\nArguably one of Jay's most complete and honest bodies of work, 4:44 is a vivid look at the artist's triumphs and failures as Shawn Carter the man. On the opening track \"Kill Jay Z,\" he sheds his ego-fueled moniker to reveal his early upbringing in Bed-Stuy on \"Marcy Me,\" the discovery of his mother's sexuality on \"Smile\" and the issues surrounding his marriage on the title track.\n\nWhile the late-career album was largely viewed as a response to Beyoncé's Lemonade album, 4:44 also painted a portrait of Black America, unveiled the pathway to generational wealth on \"The Story of O.J.,\" and the value of shared successes on \"Family Feud\" and \"Legacy.\"\n\nThe rapper veered from the commercial sound of Blueprint 3, and the gumbo of trap and luxury-soaked beats on Magna Carta… Holy Grail, to deliver deeply personal messages over No I.D.'s grounded, sample-heavy production.\n\nThe artist hasn't released another solo project since 4:44, but if it is in fact his last album, it's certainly a stellar way to close the door on a legendary music career. The 2017 release was praised by critics and garnered three nominations at the 60th GRAMMY Awards, including Song Of The Year and Album Of The Year.\n\n\"GOD DID\" (2022)\n\nThe GRAMMY-nominated song had plenty of star power thanks to John Legend, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Fridayy and producer DJ Khaled — but Jay-Z's verse tilted the hip-hop world on its axis.\n\nOn \"GOD DID,\" Jay spit one of the best verses in his catalog. \"I be speaking to the souls of men/ Those of them willing to die for the existence that this cold world has chose for them/ Kicking snow off a frozen Timb (woo)/ Back and forth on this turnpike, really took a toll on them.\" The MC detailed his journey across state lines to live out his street dreams, the drama and misfortunes that followed his tracks, and how he leveraged his powers to become one of the first rappers to reach billionaire status.\n\nHe encapsulated it all within a four-minute verse, closing out the track touching on his legacy — and proclaiming that he is in fact one of rap's all-time greats. \"I just got a million off a sync/ Without risking a million years tryna get it out the sink (woo)/ Hov big/ They said they don't know me internationally, n—s on the road did/ I see a lot of Hov in Giggs/ Me and Meek could never beef, I freed that n—a from a whole bid/ Hov did/ Next time we have a discussion who the GOAT, you donkeys know this.\"\n\nKiller Mike Says His New Album, 'Michael,' Is \"Like A Prodigal Son Coming Home\"\n\nThree months after OneRepublic began promoting their sixth album, Artificial Paradise, in February 2022, the band unexpectedly had their biggest release in nearly a decade. The pop-rock band's carefree jam, \"I Ain't Worried,\" soundtracked Top Gun: Maverick's most memeable scene and quickly became a global smash — ultimately delaying album plans in favor of promoting their latest hit.\n\nTwo years later, \"I Ain't Worried\" is one of 16 tracks on Artificial Paradise, which arrived July 12. It's a seamless blend of songs that will resonate with longtime and newer fans alike. From the layered production of \"Hurt,\" to the feel-good vibes of \"Serotonin,\" to the evocative lyrics of \"Last Holiday,\" Artificial Paradise shows that OneRepublic's sound is as dialed-in as it is ever-evolving.\n\nThe album also marks the end of an era for OneRepublic, as it's the last in their contract with Interscope Records. But for the group's singer, Ryan Tedder, that means the future is even more exciting than it's been in their entire 15-year career.\n\n\"I've never been more motivated to write the best material of my life than this very moment,\" he asserts. \"I'm taking it as a challenge. We've had a lot of fun, and a lot of uplifting records for the last seven or eight years, but I also want to tap back into some deeper material with the band.\"\n\nAs he's been prepping Artificial Paradise with his OneRepublic cohorts, Tedder has also been as busy as he's ever been working with other artists. His career as a songwriter/producer took off almost simultaneously with OneRepublic's 2007 breakthrough, \"Apologize\" (his first major behind-the-board hit was Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\"); to this day he's one of the go-to guys for pop's biggest names, from BLACKPINK to Tate McRae.\n\nTedder sat down with GRAMMY.com to share some of his most prominent memories of OneRepublic's biggest songs, as well as some of the hits he's written with Beyoncé, Adele, Taylor Swift and more.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Apologize,\" 'Dreaming Out Loud' (2007)\n\nI was producing and writing other songs for different artists on Epic and Atlantic — I was just cutting my teeth as a songwriter in L.A. This is like 2004. I was at my lowest mentally and financially. I was completely broke. Creditors chasing me, literally dodging the taxman and getting my car repoed, everything.\n\nI had that song in my back pocket for four years. A buddy of mine just reminded me last month, a songwriter from Nashville — Ashley Gorley, actually. We had a session last month, me, him and Amy Allen, and he brought it up. He was like, \"Is it true, the story about 'Apologize'? You were completely broke living in L.A. and Epic Records offered you like 100 grand or something just for the right to record the song on one of their artists?\"\n\nAnd that is true. It was, like, 20 [grand], then 50, then 100. And I was salivating. I was, like, I need this money so bad. And I give so many songs to other people, but with that song, I drew a line in the sand and said, \"No one will sing this song but me. I will die with this song.\"\n\nIt was my story, and I just didn't want anyone else to sing it. It was really that simple. It was a song about my past relationships, it was deeply personal. And it was also the song that — I spent two years trying to figure out what my sound was gonna be. I was a solo artist… and I wasn't landing on anything compelling. Then I landed on \"Apologize\" and a couple of other songs, and I was like, These songs make me think of a band, not solo artist material. So it was the song that led me to the sound of OneRepublic, and it also led me to the idea that I should start a band and not be a solo artist.\n\nWe do it every night. I'll never not do it. I've never gotten sick of it once. Every night that we do it, whether I'm in Houston or Hong Kong, I look out at the crowd and look at the band, and I'm like, Wow. This is the song that got us here.\n\nBeyoncé — \"Halo,\" 'I Am…Sacha Fierce' (2008)\n\nWe were halfway through promoting Dreaming Out Loud, our first album. I played basketball every day on tour, and I snapped my Achilles. The tour got canceled. The doctor told me not to even write. And I had this one sliver of an afternoon where my wife had to run an errand. And because I'm sadistic and crazy, I texted [songwriter] Evan Bogart, \"I got a three-hour window, race over here. Beyoncé called me and asked me to write her a song. I want to do it with you.\" He had just come off his huge Rihanna No. 1, and we had an Ashley Tisdale single together.\n\nWhen you write enough songs, not every day do the clouds part and God looks down on you and goes, \"Here.\" But that's what happened on that day. I turn on the keyboard, the first sound that I play is the opening sound of the song. Sounds like angels singing. And we wrote the song pretty quick, as I recall.\n\nI didn't get a response [from Beyoncé after sending \"Halo\" over], which I've now learned is very, very typical of her. I did Miley Cyrus and Beyoncé \"II MOST WANTED\" [from COWBOY CARTER] — I didn't know that was coming out 'til five days before it came out. And when I did \"XO\" [from 2013's Beyoncé], I found out that \"XO\" was coming out 12 hours before it came out. That's how she operates.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Good Life,\" 'Waking Up' (2009)\n\n[\"Good Life\"] was kind of a Hail Mary. We already knew that \"All the Right Moves\" would be the first single [from Waking Up]. We knew that \"Secrets\" was the second single. And in the 11th hour, our engineer at the time — who I ended up signing as a songwriter, Noel Zancanella — had this drum loop that he had made, and he played it for Brent [Kutzle] in our band. Brent said, \"You gotta hear this drum loop that Noel made. It's incredible.\"\n\nHe played it for me the next morning, and I was like, \"Yo throw some chords to this. I'm writing to this today.\" They threw some chords down, and the first thing out of my mouth was, [sings] \"Oh, this has gotta be the good life.\"\n\nIt's the perfect example of, oftentimes, the chord I've tried to strike with this band with some of our bigger records, [which] is happy sad. Where you feel nostalgic and kind of melancholic, but at the same time, euphoric. That's what those chords and that melody did for me.\n\nI was like, \"Hey guys, would it be weird if I made the hook a whistle?\" And everyone was like, \"No! Do not whistle!\" They're like, \"Name the last hit song that had a whistle.\" And the only one I could think of was, like, Scorpion from like, 1988. [Laughs.] So I thought, To hell with it, man, it's been long enough, who cares? Let's try it. And the whistle kind of made the record. It became such a signature thing.\n\nAdele — \"Rumour Has It,\" '21' (2011)\n\n\"Rumour Has It\" was the first song I did in probably a four year period, with any artist, that wasn't a ballad. All any artist ever wanted me to write with them or for them, was ballads, because of \"Halo,\" and \"Apologize\" and \"Bleeding Love.\"\n\nI begged [Adele] to do a [song with] tempo, because we did \"Turning Tables,\" another ballad. She was in a feisty mood [that day], so I was like, \"Okay, we're doing a tempo today!\"\n\nRick Rubin was originally producing the whole album. I was determined to produce Adele, not just write — because I wanted a shot to show her that I could, and to show myself. I stayed later after she left, and I remember thinking, What can I do in this record in this song that could be so difficult to reproduce that it might land me the gig?\n\nSo I intentionally muted the click track, changed the tempo, and [created that] whole piano bridge. I was making it up as I went. When she got in that morning. I said, \"I have a crazy idea for a bridge. It's a movie.\" She listens and she says, \"This is really different, I like this! How do we write to this?\"\n\nI mean, it was very difficult. [But] we finished the song. She recorded the entire song that day. She recorded the whole song in one take. I've never seen anyone do that in my life — before or since.\n\nThen I didn't hear from her for six months. Because I handed over the files, and Rick Rubin's doing it, so I don't need to check on it. I randomly check on the status of the song — and at this point, if you're a songwriter or producer, you're assuming that they're not keeping the songs. Her manager emails my manager, \"Hey, good news — she's keeping both songs they did, and she wants Ryan to finish 'Rumour Has It' production and mix it.\"\n\nWhen I finally asked her, months later — probably at the GRAMMYs — I said, \"Why didn't [Rick] do it?\" She said, \"Oh he did. It's that damn bridge! Nobody could figure out what the hell you were doing…It was so problematic that we just gave up on it.\"\n\nOneRepublic — \"Counting Stars,\" 'Native' (2013)\n\nI was in a Beyoncé camp in the Hamptons writing for the self-titled album. [There were] a bunch of people in the house — me, Greg Kurstin, Sia — it was a fun group of people. I had four days there, and every morning I'd get up an hour and a half before I had to leave, make a coffee, and start prepping for the day. On the third day, I got up, I'm in the basement of this house at like 7 in the morning, and I'm coming up with ideas. I stumble across that chord progression, the guitar and the melody. It was instant shivers up my spine.\n\n\"Lately I've been losing sleep, dreaming about the things that we could be\" is the only line that I had. [My] first thought was, I should play this for Beyoncé, and then I'm listening to it and going, This is not Beyoncé, not even remotely. It'd be a waste. So I tabled it, and I texted the guys in my band, \"Hey, I think I have a potentially really big record. I'm going to finish it when I get back to Denver.\"\n\nI got back the next week, started recording it, did four or five versions of the chorus, bouncing all the versions off my wife, and then eventually landed it. And when I played it for the band, they were like, \"This is our favorite song.\"\n\nTaylor Swift — \"Welcome to New York,\" '1989' (2014)\n\nIt was my second session with Taylor. The first one was [1989's] \"I Know Places,\" and she sent me a voice memo. I was looking for a house in Venice [California], because we were spending so much time in L.A. So that whole memory is attached to me migrating back to Los Angeles.\n\nBut I knew what she was talking about, because I lived in New York, and I remember the feeling — endless possibilities, all the different people and races and sexes and loves. That was her New York chapter. She was so excited to be there. If you never lived there, and especially if you get there and you've got a little money in the pocket, it is so exhilarating.\n\nIt was me just kind of witnessing her brilliant, fast-paced, lyrical wizardry. [Co-producer] Max [Martin] and I had a conversation nine months later at the GRAMMYs, when we had literally just won for 1989. He kind of laughed, he pointed to all the other producers on the album, and he's like, \"If she had, like, three more hours in the day, she would just figure out what we do and she would do it. And she wouldn't need any of us.\"\n\nAnd I still think that's true. Some people are just forces of nature in and among themselves, and she's one of them. She just blew me away. She's the most talented top liner I've ever been in a room with, bar none. If you're talking lyric and melody, I've never been in a room with anyone faster, more adept, knows more what they want to say, focused, efficient, and just talented.\n\nJonas Brothers — \"Sucker,\" 'Happiness Begins' (2019)\n\nI had gone through a pretty dry spell mentally, emotionally. I had just burned it at both ends and tapped out, call it end of 2016. So, really, all of 2017 for me was a blur and a wash. I did a bunch of sessions in the first three months of the year, and then I just couldn't get a song out. I kept having, song after song, artists telling me it's the first single, [then] the song was not even on the album. I had never experienced that in my career.\n\nI went six to nine months without finishing a song, which for me is unheard of. Andrew Watt kind of roped me back into working with him. We did \"Easier\" for 5 Seconds of Summer, and we did some Sam Smith and some Miley Cyrus, and right in that same window, I did this song \"Sucker.\" Two [or] three months later, Wendy Goldstein from Republic [Records] heard the record, I had sent it to her. She'd said, very quietly, \"We're relaunching the Jonas Brothers. They want you to be involved in a major way. Do you have anything?\"\n\nShe calls me, she goes, \"Ryan, do not play this for anybody else. This is their comeback single. It's a No. 1 record. Watch what we're gonna do.\" And she delivered.\n\nOneRepublic — \"I Ain't Worried,\" 'Top Gun: Maverick' Soundtrack (2022)\n\nMy memory is, being in lockdown in COVID, and just being like, Who knows when this is going to end, working out of my Airstream at my house. I had done a lot of songs for movies over the years, and [for] that particular [song] Randy Spendlove, who runs [music at] Paramount, called me.\n\nI end up Zooming with Tom Cruise [and Top Gun: Maverick director] Jerry Bruckheimer — everybody's in lockdown during post-production. The overarching memory was, Holy cow, I'm doing the scene, I'm doing the song for Top Gun. I can't believe this is happening. But the only way I knew how to approach it, rather than to, like, overreact and s— the bed, was, It's just another day.\n\nI do prescription songs for movies, TV, film all the time. I love a brief. It's so antithetical to most writers. I'm either uncontrollably lazy or the most productive person you've ever met. And the dividing line between the two is, if I'm chasing some directive, some motivation, some endpoint, then I can be wildly productive.\n\nI just thought, I'm going to do the absolute best thing I can do for this scene and serve the film. OneRepublic being the performing artist was not on the menu in my mind. I just told them, \"I think you need a cool indie band sounding, like, breakbeat.\" I used adjectives to describe what I heard when I saw the scene, and Tom got really ramped and excited.\n\nYou could argue [it's the biggest song] since the band started. The thing about it is, it's kind of become one of those every summer [hits]. And when it blew up, that's what Tom said. He said, \"Mark my words, dude. You're gonna have a hit with this every summer for, like, the next 20 years or more.\"\n\nAnd that's what happened. The moment Memorial Day happened, \"I Ain't Worried\" got defrosted and marched itself back into the top 100.\n\nTate McRae — \"Greedy,\" 'THINK LATER' (2023)\n\nWe had \"10:35\" [with Tiësto] the previous year that had been, like, a No. 1 in the UK and across Europe and Australia. So we were coming off the back of that, and the one thing she was clear about was, \"That is not the direction of what I want to do.\"\n\nIf my memory serves me correct, \"greedy\" was the next to last session we had. Everything we had done up to that point was kind of dark, midtempo, emotional. So \"greedy\" was the weirdo outlier. I kept pushing her to do a dance record. I was like, \"Tate, there's a lot of people that have great voices, and there's a lot of people who can write, but none of those people are professional dancers like you are. Your secret weapon is the thing you're not using. In this game and this career, you've got to use every asset that you have and exploit it.\"\n\nThere was a lot of cajoling. On that day, we did it, and I thought it was badass, and loved it. And she was like, \"Ugh, what do we just do? What is this?\"\n\nSo then it was just, like, months, months and months of me constantly bringing that song back up, and playing it for her, and annoying the s— out of her. And she came around on it.\n\nShe has very specific taste. So much of the music with Tate, it really is her steering. I'll do what I think is like a finished version of a song, and then she will push everyone for weeks, if not months, to extract every ounce of everything out of them, to push the song harder, further, edgier — 19 versions of a song, until finally she goes, \"Okay, this is the one.\" She's a perfectionist.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Last Holiday,\" 'Artificial Paradise' (2024)\n\nI love [our latest single] \"Hurt,\" but my favorite song on the album is called \"Last Holiday.\" I probably started the beginning of that lyric, I'm not joking, seven, eight years ago. But I didn't finish it 'til this past year.\n\nThe verses are little maxims and words of advice that I've been given throughout the years. It's almost cynical in a way, the song. When I wrote the chorus, I was definitely in kind of a down place. So the opening line is, \"So I don't believe in the stars anymore/ They never gave me what I wished for.\" And it's, obviously, a very not-so-slight reference to \"Counting Stars.\" But it's also hopeful — \"We've got some problems, okay, but this isn't our last holiday.\"\n\nIt's very simple sentiments. Press pause. Take some moments. Find God before it all ends. All these things with this big, soaring chorus. Musically and emotionally and sonically, that song — and \"Hurt,\" for sure — but \"Last Holiday\" is extremely us-sounding.\n\nThe biggest enemy that we've had over the course of 18 years, I'll be the first to volunteer, is, this ever-evolving, undulating sound. No one's gonna accuse me of making these super complex concept albums, because that's just not how my brain's wired. I grew up listening to the radio. I didn't grow up hanging out in the Bowery in CBGBs listening to Nick Cave. So for us, the downside to that, and for me doing all these songs for all these other people, is the constant push and pull of \"What is their sound? What genre is it?\"\n\nI couldn't put a pin in exactly what the sound is, but what I would say is, if you look at the last 18 years, a song like \"Last Holiday\" really encompasses, sonically, what this band is about. It's very moving, and emotional, and dynamic. It takes me to a place — that's the best way for me to put it. And hopefully the listener finds the same.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nEvery July, millions of Black people, specifically Black women, descend upon New Orleans for the Essence Festival of Culture (EFOC). Known for many years as the Essence Festival, the festival is a celebration of Black culture, community, and heritage. Since its inception in 1995 as a one-off event to commemorate the publication’s 25th anniversary, the festival has evolved into a diasporic jubilee, drawing in people of African descent from across the diaspora.\n\nIn addition to its global presence, the festival pours millions of dollars into the local New Orleans community, which has served as the festival's home for 30 years (with the exception of 2006, when the festival was held in Houston, because of Hurricane Katrina). In 2020, the festival was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, the annual festival continues to be one of the most sought-after and attended festivals in the United States.\n\nThis year’s Essence Festival of Culture will be held at the Superdome from July 4-7, replete with legendary and fast-rising talents. On July 5, Birdman & Friends will celebrate the 30th anniversary of Cash Money Records. The following day will feature a special performance by Charlie Wilson, while Usher will commemorate the 20th anniversary of Confessions.\n\nJanet Jackson and Victoria Monét will headline the festival's final night, while Frankie Beverly and Maze close out the festival with the return of All-White Night. Other performers include The Roots featuring Mickey Guyton, Ari Lennox and T-Pain, Busta Rhymes, Raphael Saadiq, D-Nice featuring Shelia E, Big Boi, and many more.\n\nRead more: Music Festivals 2024 Guide: Lineups & Dates For Lollapalooza, Coachella, Bonnaroo & Much More\n\nEFOC has been compared to SXSW, Coachella, Austin City Limits, and other notable festivals, yet it stands out for its empowerment-centered approach. It is not simply a festival, it is a family reunion. The one festival in the United States that does not pander to or take advantage of Black audiences, but truly celebrates them and their achievements. Although music has always been an integral part of the festival’s ethos — Aretha Franklin and B.B. King performed at the first iteration — the festival excels in its multi-generational and interdisciplinary programming. On any given day, attendees can attend sessions on Black entrepreneurship, politics, mental health, and literature, as well as seminars focused on issues impacting the Black community.\n\nThere’s a reason why the festival is referred to as the party with a purpose. For decades, it has operated as a celebratory convening place for Black people, Black families, and Black communities. Now, more than ever, spaces like EFOC are needed, as the Black community experiences an onslaught of changes — from Historically Black Colleges and Universities in North Carolina and Tennessee being subject to intense government oversight, to Black women-owned venture capital firms being targeted by conservatives, and Black voting rights becoming at risk during an election year.\n\nAhead of the festival’s 30th celebration, Michael Barclay, Executive Vice President of Experiential for ESSENCE Ventures and Barkue Tubman Zawolo, Chief of Staff, Talent and Diasporic Engagement for Essence Ventures, spoke to the Recording Academy about the history, legacy, and future of the Essence Festival of Culture.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nAre you part of the generation that grew up with the Essence Festival of Culture? If so, how does it feel to be a part of it?\n\nBarkue Tubman Zawolo: I'm originally from Liberia. And even being in Liberia, prior to my family moving to the U.S. in 1980, Essence was always a thing for my mom and my aunts. When we came here, fast forward to me, as an adult, [after] graduating college, I got into the music industry. I've managed artists that have gone through the Essence stages and pages in different ways.\n\nEssence Fest has always been something that we were familiar with. I have to say, I had not really experienced Essence Fest until 2019 when Essence was actually a client. One of the things that I was doing [at that point] was integrating the Diaspora and African creatives within the festival in fashion and music.\n\nTo be in the role that I'm in right now and to be on a team with people who have been a part of Essence for a long time…. Essence seems to be ingrained in all of our fabric. [What] started as a music festival now is the Super Bowl of Culture that is the Essence Festival of Culture. To be on the team that helps bring this to life for our community is a daunting but rewarding task all in the same.\n\nEssence is something that I don't think anybody in our community takes lightly. Even our partners understand the value of it. We certainly understand that we serve the Essence-inverse and, and we are in service to this community. It is a huge honor to be able to be a part of the team that brings this to life and, and, and constantly hear what it means to the community globally too.\n\nOne thing that I admired, especially about last year's festival, was GU Kickback — a music event hosted by Girls United, the publication’s Gen Z vertical. I saw a number of local artists from New Orleans, such as 504ICYGRL. ESSENCE just released a series of cover stories celebrating the 30 year relationship between the publication and New Orleans; how do you highlight the city and their history?\n\nMichael Barclay: As somebody who's worked in experiential, creating gatherings and experiences for almost 25 years now, the venue is always important when you're trying to set the box where you are creating for your community, for your audience. New Orleans has been that backdrop for us for almost 30 years now.\n\nNew Orleans is the convergence of our mission, our brand, in a city that is perfectly matched for that energy. New Orleans is as much a part of Essence Festival of Culture as Essence Magazine is to Essence Festival.\n\nIt is very much a partnership that has created this cultural movement. To be more inclusive, and highlight more of those local relationships and talent is very intentional. It has been something that we have put a lot of energy and effort into over the last couple of years.\n\nThis will be my third festival this year. I think Barkue, you started maybe a year or two before me. We're a fairly new crew that is working to help grow and reshape and solidify those relationships. Even with how we handle the management of the festival.\n\nOur VP of Essence Festival, Hakeem Holmes is a hometown boy from New Orleans. He's the pride and joy. They love to see him coming. He's always enlightening us on the things that we need to be focused on for the city and how we make the best partnership and make the best impact on the area.\n\nIt was intentional what you saw last year. It's intentional this year. We dedicated our entire festival edition of the magazine as a love letter to New Orleans. It's a symbiotic relationship that is one of the key reasons why this festival is the Super Bowl of Culture.\n\nI would love to hear about the talent aspect of the festival. Last year, Megan Thee Stallion headlined. In previous years, Beyoncé and Prince have served as headliners. What is the formula between balancing local talent, national talent and diasporic talent at the festival?\n\nZawolo: As we grow the festival, the intentionality becomes even more and more important. And, what we do in understanding where we are as a brand.\n\nWe're 30 years into the festival, the brand is 55 years. What's traditionally known as the Essence Woman is now bringing her daughter. It's multi-generational. We also know that the world is as big as your cell phone, so people are now exposed to different types of content and music.\n\nWe see the influence of Afrobeats and Caribbean music. We are intentional about making sure that every night really speaks to multiple generations, but it's anchored in a generation. It's like, who's bringing, who to the concert on Friday? Is it the daughter bringing her mama?\n\nIt's anchored in that younger demo, but we're going to make sure that they're going to have a collective good time there. Saturday is usually our heaviest night. We have our living legends that show up there; that really cuts across generations. This is anybody can bring anybody, but let me tell you, you're going to be able to teach each other, connect with each other with the different groupings of talent that we have.\n\nWe try to make sure that there is something that speaks to us, but that that connects with the diaspora on as many nights as possible. Sometimes it's not because they're from a different country, but because we know the music also resonates.\n\nIf you think of Janet Jackson, you can go anywhere in the world. She can check off that box, although she's not from there. You can create those ties, but we also are intentional about having Ayra Starr and Machel Montano. Last year we had Tems and Wizkid. The goal is to continue to grow what that looks like, because we are a global brand and that is our diasporic and global intent in connecting the global Black community is really important.\n\nWe are intentionally multi-generational. We intentionally lead into where a multitude of generational communities can come together and have fun together. There is something for everybody. We have a unique opportunity with Essence as the brand grows to be able to not only speak to what they want to call the aunties, I call the punties. I also think that this is where we get to educate the next generation on where we're coming from. We also get to learn from them on where they are and where they want to go.\n\nWhat a beautiful way to kind of tie all of these connections. Last year, the festival celebrated 50 years of hip-hop; this year you're celebrating the 30th anniversary of the festival. What is the intention behind this year’s music programming?\n\nZawolo: Paying homage to people who had done some historical things on our stages. We have Janet [Jackson] back. People are like, “Oh, we saw Janet two years ago,” but Janet is also one of the highest sellers in the festival's history.\n\nIf we're going to celebrate, let's celebrate, because we know Janet never disappoints. We also want to lean into some of the [older] talent, like Charlie Wilson, Uncle Charlie. He's graced that stage so many times, but yet it's still very relevant. Using this moment to reignite things that we've done in the past and bring them back to life that we know the audience missed.\n\nFrankie Beverly, who is going to come, this is probably going to really be his last performance. The passing of the torch. This year was about having to be intentional about what other milestones are happening that are important to this culture. Cash Money is also celebrating 30 years. Who better, right?\n\nEssence has been in New Orleans for 30 years. Cash Money and crew are from New Orleans. Juvenile just got the key to the city from the mayor. We want to honor and celebrate him, but we also want to recognize the influence that this group of very creative, entrepreneurial, rappers and artists have had on culture, because there was a time where we all were backing that ass up.\n\nMaking sure we highlighted milestones, connecting with people who have historically been a part of making history with us, introducing some new ones — that's what we have to do. We have to set up now for the next 30 years. We want to go to the soul of what appeals to our audience, and we're really all about good music.\n\nI think the 30th year just continues to do what we do. As we look to grow and connect demos, Megan Thee Stallion is a very viable option because again, the daughter now is going to bring the mama. Intergenerational diasporic and connecting demos, I think that only happens at the Superdome. That's also happening in the convention center, which I believe is honestly the soul of the festival.\n\nWhat are your hopes and aspirations for the next 30 years of the Essence Festival of Culture? Will Essence Fest always be in New Orleans? Are we going to have an Essence Fest in Lagos, Nigeria?\n\nBarclay: Being on this side of [EFOC], seeing the true impact of the festival and how it impacts the communities, how it impacts the folks that come to New Orleans, and now, because we've expanded to our virtual audience, the 1.7 million that are viewing around the world, my hope for the festival is that we continue to show up where our community needs us.\n\nWe're going to be in New Orleans. We're going to be in our official world as we call it. If you can't make it to New Orleans, you can tune into Essence.com and you can see what's going on there. We are creating virtual experiences, AR experiences, VR experiences, all those things, so really keeping up with the way that people continue to connect with each other, whether they're physically in the same place or halfway across the world.\n\nI think that type of innovation is what I want to continue to see us do and allow us to create that joy that we generate in New Orleans and wherever it's needed for our community.\n\nPRIDE & Black Music Month: Celebrating LGBTQIA+ & Black Voices\n\nWe’re fortunate enough to be living in the middle of a Missy Elliott resurgence — not that she ever went away.\n\nThree decades into her groundbreaking career, Missy is readying her very first headlining tour, which begins July 4 in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Out of This World Tour runs through August and features her longtime collaborators Timbaland, Busta Rhymes, and Ciara.\n\nThe fact that it is her first headlining tour may be surprising, given that she’s been on the scene since debuting with the group Sista in the mid-1990s, and has been a chart-topping star since becoming a solo artist in 1997.\n\nThe hip-hop icon released her last full-length album, The Cookbook, nearly two decades ago but time hasn’t diminished her influence at all. In fact, we’re all still catching up to the futuristic vision that Missy and Timbaland introduced to the world in the late 1990s in their songs and videos.\n\nMissy began her career as a member of Sista, which was a part of the Swing Mob, a musical collective working under Jodeci’s DeVanté Swing. That crew included a number of future world-changers, including Missy, Timbaland, Ginuwine, Tweet, Stevie J., and two legends who have since passed on, Magoo and Static Major. After Sista was dropped from their label, Missy, by all accounts, would have been perfectly happy to settle into a life as a songwriter and producer. But something bigger was beckoning.\n\nPersuaded by Elektra’s Sylvia Rhone with the promise of her own label, Missy agreed to turn in one album as a solo artist. That album, 1997’s Supa Dupa Fly, made Missy not just a star but an icon, and changed the course of her life. It began a career that, over a quarter-century later, found her inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame — she was the first female rapper ever to be nominated for the latter.\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning of the accolades. There are the four GRAMMY wins and head-spinning 22 nominations. She was also honored alongside Dr. Dre, Lil Wayne (who has not been shy about calling Missy his favorite rapper), and the woman who gave Missy her first solo record deal, Sylvia Rhone, at 2023’s Black Music Collective’s Recording Academy Honors event. Missy was also a key participant in the GRAMMYs tribute to a half-century of hip-hop that same year.\n\nThroughout it all, Missy has remained humble. When speaking to GRAMMY.com in 2022, she reflected on how she and longtime collaborator Timbaland had no idea of their impact at the time.\n\n\"We really just came out with a sound that we had been doing for some time, but we had no clue that it would be game changing, that we would change the cadence — the sound of what was happening at that time,\" she said. \"No clue!\"\n\n\"Her whole existence is based on moving us and influencing us,\" says her longtime manager Mona Scott-Young. \"She wants to be able to touch people.\"\n\nAnd that she has. To celebrate the Missy-aissance, GRAMMY.com spoke with Missy's colleagues and collaborators for an insider’s view on the course of her career and what makes the four-time GRAMMY winner unique.\n\nThe quotes and comments used in this feature were edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nMissy’s Impact Began With Her First Guest Verse\n\nThe first time many people took note of Missy Elliott was her verse on the 1996 remix of Gina Thompson’s \"That Thing You Do.\"\n\nGina Thompson (singer): I was in the process of completing my first album, Nobody Does It Better. Actually, it was complete. So what happened was, my A&R at the time, Bruce Carbone at Mercury Records, wanted to have Puffy do the remix.\n\nPuffy was like, \"We have this person that's really talented. Her name's Missy, and she used to be with the group Sista, and she's a phenomenal writer. She's working with a lot of other artists, she’s definitely the next big thing in the R&B/hip-hop world.\" We were like, cool.\n\nI believe we actually heard it over the speaker phone in Bruce’s office. I know that I said that I loved it, and I felt her style was unique and different. It grew on me in a great way. I just felt like it was a smash. She definitely had added a great touch to it. I was super-excited about it.\n\nMerlin Bobb (former Executive Vice President, Elektra Records): I was blown away by the simple fact that I knew she was a great songwriter. But when I heard her rhyming, I thought it was the most unique style that I had heard in some time.\n\nDigital Black (former member of Playa, part of the Swing Mob): A lot of people only knew her as a writer or an R&B artist, but when she came on that Gina Thompson record with that rap, it changed everything. It allowed her to be even more herself.\n\nMona Scott-Young (manager): Oh my God, have you heard that song? It’s her ability to use expression and evoke emotion without even using words. She said, \"He he he haw,\" and we all found a new way to bounce. There was something fun and magical and different that spoke to what we would come to know was this incredibly vivid imagination that would take us places sonically and visually that we didn’t even know we needed to be.\n\nRead more: 50 Artists Who Changed Rap: Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G., Dr. Dre, Nicki Minaj, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem & More\n\nShe Changed The Sound Of Hip-Hop With Her Debut LP\n\nMissy’s first solo album, Supa Dupa Fly, came out the following year. It gave new energy to a hip-hop scene that was still reeling from the deaths of 2Pac and Biggie.\n\nAnne Kristoff (former Vice President of PR, Elektra): She 100 percent did not want to be an artist. She's like, \"I'm not an artist. I want to be Diane Warren. I'm going to write the songs. I'm going to be behind the scenes.\"\n\nMerlin Bobb: I started talking to her regarding being an artist. She was totally against it. \"No, I want to be a songwriter.\" And also, just to be honest, [Sista] had been dropped from Elektra prior to my conversations with her, so she wasn't too eager, I think, to jump back aboard.\n\nIt took about six or seven months of us discussing ways to do this. I spoke to Sylvia [Rhone, then-head of Elektra], and I said, \"She's an incredible songwriter. Let's offer her a production deal or a label deal where she can not only just look at herself as an artist, but at the same time develop and nurture artists under her own banner.\" Sylvia thought it was a great idea.\n\nWe both talked to Missy about it, and she said, \"Okay, I'll do one album.\" I was ecstatic because she was writing some great songs, but she also gave us her first album, which was, needless to say, a classic.\n\nKathy Iandoli (author, \"God Save the Queens: The Essential History of Women in Hip-Hop and Baby Girl: Better Known as Aaliyah\"): In God Save the Queens, I referred to her as the Andy Warhol of hip-hop, in the sense that she took the art and the cultural aspect of it, and she just put this spin and interpretation of the art that no one had ever really done prior.\n\nWith Missy’s arrival around ‘97, we were at a point in time where hip-hop was in a complete state of confusion. We did not know where it was going to go. Missy made high art hip-hop that was commercially accessible. And for that, she changed the entire game.\n\nGina Thompson: When she had her first project with the whole vision — not only her sound, but her songwriting style, the look — everyone was like, \"This girl went out on edge. I'm gonna do a little bit of the same thing and not be so worried if I don't sound so average, what people are going to think. Because she's out on the edge doing it.\" And I promise you, ever since she came out, that you started hearing a lot more of female rappers tweaking their voices.\n\nLenny Holmes (guitarist): In hip-hop, everybody would think that it's a whole bunch of computer generated stuff. Missy Elliott does not approach it like that. She loves live instrumentation, but she likes to take bits and pieces of it. She simplifies it, and it is placed uniquely in the track at certain points. That's what makes up the structure of the song.\n\nMona Scott-Young: Everything from the way she looked to what she was talking about to the way she delivered that music and what she represented in terms of being nonconforming, not looking like the other female rappers of the day — I think all of those elements were the perfect lightning in a bottle. The way she rode that beat, both lyrically and with her delivery, was very, very different from everything else that we were hearing.\n\nRead more: Revisiting 'Supa Dupa Fly' At 25: Missy Elliott Is Still Inspired By Her Debut Record\n\nShe Reinvented The Music Video\n\nYou can’t think of Missy Elliott without picturing her iconic music videos, many done in collaboration with director Hype Williams.\n\nBrian Greenspoon (former International Publicist, Elektra): I mean, she came out of the gate wearing a garbage bag, and made it the coolest thing anyone had ever seen.\n\nMerlin Bobb: She said, if I put out this album — initially we were talking about a single deal, but we went into an album — there’s two things very important to me: the dance aspect and the visual aspect.\n\nKathy Iandoli: The thing that I really loved about Missy's music videos, she was a big budget music video person. She got the men's music video budget.\n\nAnne Kristoff: When you think about the \"Rain\" video — I'm just guessing, I don't want to put words in her mouth — but I think when she saw that the vision in her head could become real out in the world, that anything she could think of could happen, that maybe it made it a little more fun for her to be an artist. I hope.\n\nDigital Black: Missy is one of the funniest people you’ll ever meet. People maybe don't know. She loves joking. So that was just her being her.\n\nGina Thompson: You started seeing a lot of people doing certain robotic-type images or moves in their videos to almost mimic her \"Supa Dupa Fly.\" She’s the creator of that.\n\nEarl Baskerville (manager/producer): Missy would get with the director, and she would sit there and go over the whole treatment. A lot of the visuals came from her. She was very hands on. Today, you can shoot a video in four or five hours. But Missy’s video shoots was so long, I used to hate it. We would be there fifteen hours for a three minute video!\n\nShe Was Avant-Garde But Still Pop\n\nMissy’s musical and visual style was like nothing anyone had ever seen. Yet she still became a star. How did she manage to be both innovative and accessible?\n\nKathy Iandoli: You can't make something that the general public can't access, or speak over their heads.\n\nDigital Black: Even if you said it sounded weird, it still had some soulfulness to it. I think that was what allowed her to touch so many different people.\n\nMerlin Bobb: When you have an artist that stands out, but it doesn't go over your head musically, artistically, lyrically, then it works. People, when they heard and experienced something new and fresh that was easy to digest, but it was unique, they gravitated to it.\n\nBrian Greenspoon: How was it sold to a mass audience? I mean, the sound was breakthrough. What Timbaland was doing with drum sounds, and the way they were building these very sparse rhythms and sound beds, they were breaking ground. But the thing that worked is that they had these incredible songs that Missy was writing and that she had these incredible featured artists on.\n\nGina Thompson: To try to figure out what her brain is doing, I’ve been gave that up.\n\nEarl Baskerville: Nobody could figure out what we were doing, because they couldn’t understand the sound.\n\nLenny Holmes: Her rhythmic style of how she would do the vocals was just unheard of. Like, doubling up accents. The things that she started doing — you would hear a deejay do a scratch on a record. You would not hear a singer do it. I was like, What in the world?\n\nAnne Kristoff: She was doing these really creative things that no one else was doing visually. And the sound was different than whatever everyone else was doing. So it wasn't a hard sell for the press.\n\nShe Was A Master At Working With Other Artists\n\nMissy was far more than just a solo star. All throughout her career, she continued her first love: writing and producing for other artists — including Ciara, Aaliyah, Destiny’s Child, and Whitney Houston.\n\nLenny Holmes: Missy had a great relationship with singers and rappers, because she could do both. A lot of people don’t know, but Missy can sing. So when we worked with groups that had singing parts on them, a lot of times she would go ahead and lay down the guide track for the actual artist to sing.\n\nKathy Iandoli: Missy just really understood the artists that she worked with. She saw their strengths, and she helped them utilize them to the best of their capabilities.\n\nAngelique Miles (former music publishing executive): She was able to relate to the artist and express that artist. She was able to customize and express that artist's story. Whatever she wrote for 702 didn’t sound like what she wrote for Whitney Houston.\n\nDigital Black: She was good at listening to the artist, seeing what they do, and then, how can you enhance what they do well? Those are the best records. She was great at tailor-making records for people, just from her doing her due diligence on learning who the artist is. Not just going in, \"I’m Missy, I can write whatever.\" I'm gonna write something specifically for you that enhances what you’ve already done.\n\nMerlin Bobb: She would have made an incredible A&R person. I would have hired her back then. She was able to come up with lyrics and melodies and songs and chords and production that to me stood out. She worked with both male and female artists. She really knew how to get an artist not only to sing a great song, but to sing very uniquely and in their own way, because she was a great vocal production coach.\n\nMona Scott-Young: She's always listening beyond what we hear. Even if there's a song an artist has [that she’s not involved with], she'll say, \"Yeah, I would have done this thing differently with this artist. Because if you listen to what she did on this one part of the song, you can hear that there's more range there. But for some reason they didn't push her to go there.\" That to me is just one of the things that makes her such a great producer and star finder, because she always is looking for what more they can do and how they can challenge themselves to be better.\n\nEarl Baskerville: She had signed an artist that I used to manage named Mocha. And she told Mocha to go in there and just rap. I think Mocha might have did 30-something bars, 60 bars. know. Missy listened to all of the stuff she did, took it, and dissected it. She went in there and took eight bars, not from the beginning of the track — I don’t know where she found it, in the middle or something — and put it on the Nicole Wray record \"Make It Hot.\" When Mocha comes in, that’s actually the middle of the verse somewhere! That was crazy to me.\n\nHer First Love Was Always Songwriting\n\nThrough it all, Missy’s strength remained (and remains) her songwriting. But what makes her songs stand out, and stand the test of time?\n\nEarl Baskerville: Missy didn’t want to be an artist. She just wanted to be a songwriter.\n\nMerlin Bobb: Her songwriting was very soulful, but it also had great melodic edge to it. They’re very realistic lyrics to a young scene that was happening in R&B and hip-hop at the time. So it was somewhat of a fusion of R&B and hip-hop lyrically, and she just had a very strong sense of melody and great hook lines.\n\nMona Scott-Young: She wasn't talking about the same thing that we were hearing from a lot of the other females in the genre at the time — overt sexuality and material possessions and that kind of stuff. She was engaging, having a good time lyrically, and holding her own with her male counterparts.\n\nShe was giving us music that was great, and it didn't matter that it was coming from a female. She was kind of this androgynous being that was delivering great music. You listen to the song, you just want to party.\n\nRead more: Missy Elliott Makes History As First Female Rapper Nominated For Songwriters Hall Of Fame\n\nShe Changed The Artists Who Came After Her\n\nAs with all major innovations, it didn’t take long after Missy broke big for her influence to be felt.\n\nKathy Iandoli: The special relationship between Aaliyah, Missy, and Timbaland was the fact that together they all created a new sound that would set the standard of hip-hop and what we now define as alt-R&B. They invented a new subgenre. It was something that Missy was able to continue along and then create a sound on her own terms.\n\nGina Thompson: Many people were trying to emulate her whole different style.\n\nLenny Holmes: [Were people copying her?] Most definitely. But there's only one Missy. And I got to say, there’s only one Timbaland too. You hear that trademark voice or the trademark lick, and you just know that's them.\n\nBrian Greenspoon: I think she influenced just about everybody that came after her. The sound of hip-hop changed after her and Timbaland dropped that music. The way the people produced their drum sounds and their beats, the use of hi hats, it all changed based on Missy and Timbaland.\n\nMerlin Bobb: Most hip-hop/R&B collaborations at that time were hip-hop records with vocal hooks from R&B artists. She kind of flipped it, where she worked from the R&B side and made the vocals and the production more hip-hop friendly.\n\nMona Scott-Young: Her whole existence is based on moving us and influencing us. She wants to be able to touch people. So when we see artists who you can hear or see the influence, then you know that she's done her job.\n\nThere's so many artists — Flyana Boss, a little bit Cardi, a little bit Nicki. They all, I think, have been influenced by Missy, her look, her sound, in one way, shape or form. And that is the greatest compliment, to inspire a generation and see them take what you've done to another level. But then she's constantly also evolving and keeping everyone on their toes.\n\nLearn more: 8 Ways Aaliyah Empowered A Generation Of Female R&B Stars\n\nConsidering Missy And Her Legacy\n\nEveryone interviewed for this piece had so much love for Missy. Here’s a small sample.\n\nBrian Greenspoon: Missy is one of the most professional, talented, creative artists I've ever had the luck to work with. I'm happy to see that she is being recognized for being the icon that we all saw that she was becoming back then.\n\nLenny Holmes: Even today, in whatever we're doing, we use what we've learned from Missy Elliott. It’s mixed in whatever we do. It’s amazing what she has done for herself, but she has definitely helped people along the way, and we will forever be grateful to her.\n\nDigital Black: She's a one-of-one, God-given talent. She earned every award, every accolade, accomplishment. Her work ethic was phenomenal, and nothing was given. Big sis earned everything, and I just want to say I love her, and it's been a pleasure and an honor to be a part of her career.\n\nKathy Iandoli: There’s so much of the art that we have right now that we have to thank her for.\n\nMona Scott-Young: This has been an incredible journey. I always talk about being incredibly blessed to have had the opportunity to play a role when you have somebody like her who has touched so many people globally and whose music and entire presence hold this special place in fans’ hearts.\n\nEvery day it's just about, how do we continue to push forth, break boundaries, challenge ourselves to do things bigger and better than we did it the last go round.\n\nExplore The Artists Who Changed Hip-Hop"
