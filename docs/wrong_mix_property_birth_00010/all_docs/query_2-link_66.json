        "text": "NEW YORK\n\nJay-Z performed more than two dozen hits, including his latest hit \"Glory,\" about his 1-month-old daughter with Beyoncé, Blue Ivy Carter.\n\nThe Grammy-winning rapper was backed by an orchestra of 30-plus and a band. The audience was mostly men in suits or tuxedos, and women in conservative dresses. About 2,800 people filled the hall, including Beyoncé, Alicia Keys and Liza Minnelli\n\nThough some tickets were sold to the public, most were offered in a private sale, going for $500 to $2,500. Proceeds benefited the United Way of New York City and Jay-Z's own charity, the Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. Students from Jay-Z's foundation also attended the show.\n\nJay-Z is just the second hip-hop artist to perform at this historic venue. The last one was Wyclef Jean in 2001."
