        "text": "Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter will headline Carnegie Hall on Feb. 6 and 7, playing a pair of charity concerts benefitting the United Way of New York City and Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. Carter made the announcement at Carnegie Hall Thursday alongside key execs like Clive Gillinson, executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, Gordon Campbell, president-CEO of United Way of New York City and Dania Diaz, executive director of the Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation.\n\nPHOTOS: GQ’s Men of the Year Party\n\nTickets for the shows will begin with a private sale geared toward corporations and high net-worth individuals, ranging in price from $500 to $2,500 apiece. A public sale will tentatively kick off on Jan. 30 to minimize ticket scalping, with prices more in the range of a typical Jay-Z concert. “We’re gonna have some legendary nights, some loud music and it’s gonna be a fun, beautiful experience,” Jay-Z said.\n\nThe rapper could not confirm whether his current tour-mate Kanye West or any other guest would appear at the concerts just yet. “There’s no guests on the Watch The Throne tour, maybe no guests on this, but some time when there’s guests maybe you’ll be surprised,” he teased.\n\nThe concerts will mark some of the biggest fundraising efforts yet for the Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation, which was founded in 2002 by Jay-Z and his mother Gloria Carter. The organization’s mostly grassroots work has helped award $1.4 million in college scholarship money to over 750 low-income high school students, with a heavy concentration in the Marcy neighborhood of Brooklyn where Jay-Z grew up.\n\nPHOTOS: New York City Power List"
