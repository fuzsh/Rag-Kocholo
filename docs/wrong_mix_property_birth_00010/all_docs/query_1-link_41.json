        "text": "Huge props should definitely go out to the Carters for their altruism.\n\nLast month Beyoncé announced that she'd be offering new scholarship opportunities \"to encourage and support young women who are unafraid to think outside of the box,\" and now her husband is doing the same.\n\nAccording to Billboard, Jay Z's Shawn Carter Foundation, along with eBay for Charity, are teaming up to help underprivileged kids go to college. And they'll gather the needed funds through a series of auctions.\n\n\"Our goal is to touch as many people as we possibly can,\" Jay told Billboard. \"There are so many young people — a lot of whom are first generation students — that have the desire to attend college but don't have the funds. My mother and father taught us to pay it forward and give to the community. That was my inspiration for the foundation. It makes me feel so blessed to be put in a situation where I can help the next generation.\"\n\nThe 10-day campaign offers several ways to donate. For example, fans can join an auction to win access to a VIP lounge party at Hov's 40/40 Club in New York City. Plus, you could win special VIP passes to the Made in America Festival, and there's also a chance to meet CC Sabathia from the New York Yankees or Robinson Cano from the Seattle Mariners. But of course, that's just a small number of the prizes being offered.\n\nConversely, people can donate directly to the campaign and potentially win a day at the Roc Nation office for a sit-down with company execs. They'll also be allowed to host a listening session. On top of that, there's a Roc Nation photo shoot and dinner for two at 40/40.\n\nBut obviously the cool gifts aren't the main thing here, it's about helping kids reach higher through education, which eBay is happy to do.\n\n\"We are focusing on creating opportunity for all by enabling our users to support great causes when they buy or sell,\" said eBay's VP of Global Communications and Global Impact Claire Dixon. \"To date, the eBay for Charity platform has raised more than $725 million.\"\n\nThe auctions and the donation campaign starts today (May 15) and ends on May 24."
