        "text": "Every few months the general public and media seem to debate Jay-Z’s dedication to charity work. To me, Jay-Z channels the great Jewish philosopher Maimonides, who constructed the eight levels of charity. He believed the highest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous, and equates to a complete self-less offering. Hov in heavily invested in this idea and chooses to conduct his charity work privately and efficiently. But for those still wondering, here is a list of Shawn Carter’s charity work [that has been made public]:\n\nEvery year since the late 1990s Jay-Z has hosted the ‘Jay-Z Santa Claus Toy Drive, where he travels back to the Marcy Projects on Christmas Day with his family to donate presents to the children living there. He also provides for Thanksgiving turkey drives in his hometown borough of Bedford–Stuyvesant every year.\n\nJay-Z employs hundreds of people at his various companies, and he always endeavors to employ under-privileged young black women and men who are most in need of employment.\n\nApril 1999 – Jay-Z donated his proceeds from the Denver stop of the Hard Knock Life Tour to help the families of the victims of the Columbine tragedy.\n\nAugust 2000 – Hosted, commentated, and made a donation at a charity basketball game that benefited the Boys Harbor summer camp and T.H.A.N.K.U.

On The Blueprint album tour he donated proceeds from every ticket sold to the relief effort.\n\nOctober 2001 – Performed at ‘The Concert for New York City,’ a benefit concert for victims of the 9/11 tragedy. Hov also donated unique memorabilia that was later auctioned off to support the Robin Hood Foundation.\n\nNovember 2001 –Hosted and performed at the ‘Jay-Z’s Thanksgiving Give Back Concerts’ in New York.

They founded the charity on the belief that any motivated individual in need should have the opportunity to further his or her education. Since its formation the Foundation has donated over $1.5 million to more than 750 students who would have otherwise not been able to afford a college education.\n\n2003 – Since the first branch opened in 2003, each 40/40 Club has ensured that a percentage of profits is given to music and sport charities in deprived communities. The Club also gives first option on jobs to unemployed young people.\n\nNovember 2003 – All proceeds from his legendary ‘Fade to Black’ concert went to various charities.
