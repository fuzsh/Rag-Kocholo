The total was comprised of numerous donations including a $10 million contribution from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez as well as $2 million from Jack Dorsey.\n\nThe SCF also announced a joint partnership with Robert Kraft's Foundation to Combat Antisemitism in order to help stop book bans across the country. Both foundations contributed $1 million to protect free speech and intellectual learning. Fanatics and Live Nation also contributed an additional $500,000 each to support the cause. The funds will \"provide book donations, legal support, marketing assistance, publishing help and additional resources\" to help protect everyone who's been affected by the recent book bans.\n\nThe event happened just 24 hours after the grand opening of \"The Book of HOV\" exhibit at the Brooklyn Public Library.
