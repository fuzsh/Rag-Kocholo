Mayor Eric Adams famously demanded his paycheck be delivered in the cryptocurrency and subsequently lost $5,800 in value.\n\nClasses will be taught by Lamar Wilson, of Black Bitcoin Billionaire, and Najah J. Roberts, founder of Crypto Blockchain Plug, and will run from June 22 through Sept. 7.\n\nDinner will be served at evening in-person classes and those who participate will receive MiFi devices and a one-year limited data plan, plus smartphones if needed, according to the website.\n\n\"The vision for Bitcoin is that it doesn’t have barriers, but lack of access to financial education is a barrier,\" the website states. \"It’s still hard to use for everyday necessities. Plus, people need devices and data plans.\"\n\nResidents may keep the devices. There will also be a “Crypto Kids Camp” for Marcy kids and teens aged 5-17.\n\n\"Education is power,\" instructors said in the academy's mission statement. \"This program aims to provide education, and empower the community with knowledge.\"\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
