        "text": "Beyonc√© and Jay-Z have been together for over 20 years, and their relationship has produced more art than anyone could have anticipated. They've also created three children, Blue Ivy, who was born in 2012, and their twins Rumi and Sir, born in 2017.\n\nThe couple is very thoughtful about what they share from their marriage and family, but a lot of it comes through their music and their travels and tours across the world. Here's all the big moments from their long, loving relationship.\n\n2000\n\nBeyonc√© told Seventeen that she met Jay-Z when she was 18, but they began dating about a year and a half later, when she was 19 years old. The rapper is 12 years older than his wife.\n\n‚ÄúWe were friends first for a year and a half before we went on any dates,‚Äù the pop icon told Oprah Winfrey in an OWN interview. \"We were on the phone for a year and a half, and that foundation is so important for a relationship. Just to have someone who you just like is so important, and someone [who] is honest.\"\n\nNovember 2001\n\nThe couple are put on the cover of Vanity Fair's November 2001 music issue. Jay-Z later told the magazine that at the time of the cover they ‚Äúwere just beginning to try to date each other.‚Äù\n\nHe added, ‚ÄúWell, you know, you've got to try first. You got to dazzle... wine and dine...She's a charming Southern girl, you know, she's not impressed... But I would have definitely had to be this cool.‚Äù\n\nOctober 2002\n\nThe two collaborate on Jay-Z's track ‚Äú'03 Bonnie & Clyde‚Äù featuring Beyonc√©'s vocals and filming a music video together in Mexico.\n\nMay 2003\n\nThey do a switcheroo, and Beyonc√© releases the song ‚ÄúCrazy in Love‚Äù featuring Jay-Z. They win a Grammy for Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2004. At this point, their relationship still wasn't official, though fans and followers assume they're together.\n\nAugust 2004\n\nBeyonc√© and Jay-Z make their red carpet debut at the MTV VMAs in Miami, and each win an award.\n\nSeptember 2006\n\nBeyonc√© releases her B'Day album and Jay-Z is again her collaborator, appearing in ‚ÄúD√©j√† Vu‚Äù and ‚ÄúUpgrade U.‚Äù\n\nNovember 2006\n\nThe rapper releases Kingdom Come and Beyonc√© is heard on ‚ÄúHollywood.‚Äù\n\nApril 2008\n\nOn April 4, 2008, Beyonc√© and Jay-Z get married in very secretive and intimate ceremony.\n\n‚ÄúIt was a very emotional wedding‚Äîlots of crying‚Äîand really very spiritual,‚Äù a source told People at the time, saying it was held at the rapper's Manhattan penthouse, and they decorated the luxurious apartment with 70,000 dendrobium orchids flown in from Thailand for the event.\n\n‚ÄúThere was no rush‚Äîno one expected me to run off and get married,‚Äù Beyonc√© later told Seventeen of her big day. ‚ÄúI really don't believe that you will love the same thing when you're 20 as you do at 30. So that was my rule: Before the age of 25, I would never get married. I feel like you have to get to know yourself, know what you want, spend some time by yourself, and be proud of who you are before you can share that with someone else.‚Äù\n\nAugust 2008\n\nIn an interview with Vibe, Jay-Z finally confirmed their wedding ceremony.\n\n‚ÄúThat's ridiculous for me to confirm,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúI don't have ‚Ä¶ I'm gonna say, I think that was a ridiculous question. I just think it's really a part of your life that you gotta keep to yourself ‚Ä¶ You have to, or you'll go insane in this type of business. You have to have something that's sacred to you and the people around you ‚Ä¶ I shared so much of my life, my childhood, and my family, the death of my nephew with the world. I should have something to hold on to. You need something for your sanity to say, ‚ÄòOkay, I could chill out, and this is it.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nOctober 2008\n\nBeyonc√© and Jay-Z share that they have matching tattoos of the Roman numeral IV on their ring fingers, which is significant because Beyonc√© was born on September 4; Jay-Z on December 4; and they were married on April 4.\n\nNovember 2008:\n\nBeyonc√© tells Seventeen what she's learned from her relationship so far, saying, ‚ÄúI guess probably that we're all human. I don't care if you're picture-perfect on every magazine cover, and you're the most handsome, successful, coolest guy‚Äîyou still get sad, and you still get your feelings hurt, and you still get confused and vulnerable and nervous and scared. You have to find a person you can make it through the tough times with.‚Äù\n\nJanuary 2009\n\nThe couple were in attendance at the inauguration of President Obama's first term in the White House, and Beyonc√© contributed her talent to sing him in, starting with ‚ÄúAmerica the Beautiful‚Äù at his swearing-in ceremony followed by Etta James' ‚ÄúAt Last‚Äù as Barack and Michelle Obama shared their first dance at his inaugural ball.\n\nAugust 2011\n\nThe couple revealed that they're expecting at the MTV VMAs in Los Angeles. Beyonc√© wore an outfit revealing her baby bump. When she took to the stage to perform ‚ÄúLove on Top,‚Äù she told the audience, ‚ÄúI want you to stand up on your feet. I want you to feel the love that's growing inside me.‚Äù\n\nIn her 2013 HBO documentary Life Is But a Dream, she revealed that Blue Ivy was not her first pregnancy.\n\n‚ÄúAbout two years ago, I was pregnant for the first time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I heard the heartbeat, which was the most beautiful music I ever heard in my life ‚Ä¶ Being pregnant was very much like falling in love. You are so open. You are so overjoyed. There's no words that can express having a baby growing inside of you, so of course you want to scream it out and tell everyone.... I flew back to New York to get my check up‚Äîand no heartbeat. Literally the week before I went to the doctor, everything was fine, but there was no heartbeat.‚Äù\n\nJanuary 2012\n\nBlue Ivy Carter is born to the couple on January 7, 2012 in New York City.\n\nFebruary 2012\n\nBeyonc√© and Jay-Z share the first pics of Blue Ivy on Beyonc√©'s Tumblr, the popular mode of communication at the time.\n\n‚ÄúWe welcome you to share in our joy. Thank you for respecting our privacy during this beautiful time in our lives,‚Äù they wrote.\n\nJanuary 2013\n\nThe married couple are present for President Obama's second inauguration as well, where she sings ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner.‚Äù\n\nFebruary 2013\n\nBeyonc√©'s Life Is But a Dream documentary is released, sharing details of their life that haven't been seen before, like Beyonc√©'s early pregnancy days.\n\nJuly 2013\n\nMagna Carta Holy Grail is released, including the track ‚ÄúPart II (On the Run)‚Äù in which Jay-Z duets with his wife.\n\nDecember 2013\n\nBeyonc√©'s iconic self-titled album was released, making it a full visual album for all 14 songs, which included her massive hit ‚ÄúDrunk in Love‚Äù with Jay-Z.\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nThe couple perform ‚ÄúDrunk in Love‚Äù at the Grammy Awards, looking like they definitely are smitten.\n\nMay 2014\n\nThe silent fight that shook the world takes place: footage of Jay-Z, Beyonc√©, and her sister Solange on an elevator after the annual Met Gala shows Solange attacking Jay-Z following some sort of argument. No one from the family has ever confirmed what the instigating issue was, but tabloids reported it was over cheating rumors.\n\nThey did release a statement saying, ‚ÄúThere has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family. The reports of Solange being intoxicated or displaying erratic behavior throughout that evening are simply false. At the end of the day families have problems and we're no different. We love each other and above all we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.‚Äù\n\nJune 2014\n\nOn June 25, Jay-Z and Beyonc√© kick off their On the Run Tour in Miami that runs for 21 dates. That same summer, they are plagued by rumors of a split.\n\nAugust 2014\n\nOn August 24, Beyonc√© receives the MTV Video Vanguard Award, which is presented to her by her husband and their daughter Blue Ivy.\n\n‚ÄúThank you. I have nothing to say, but I'm thrilled with so much gratitude,‚Äú she said in her acceptance speech. ‚ÄúI just thank God for this moment. I love y'all so much,\" she tearfully told the crowd. \"My beloved, I love you. My fans, I love you. MTV, I love you. Good night!‚Äù\n\nIn her new remix of ‚Äú***Flawless‚Äù with Nicki Minaj, she says, ‚ÄúOf course sometimes sh*t go down when it's a billion dollars on the elevator,‚Äù seemingly referencing the incident from May.\n\nThat same month, Solange is asked about the fight in her Lucky cover story, calling it ‚Äúthat thing.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat's important is that my family and I are all good,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat we had to say collectively was in the statement that we put out, and we all feel at peace with that.‚Äù\n\nOctober 2014\n\nFor Halloween, Beyonc√© dresses up as Janet Jackson, and Blue Ivy is a little Michael Jackson.\n\nNovember 2014\n\nSolange marries her fianc√© Alan Ferguson on November 16 in New Orleans, and Beyonc√©, Jay-Z, and Blue Ivy all attend. A couple weeks later, Beyonc√© releases ‚ÄúRing Off,‚Äù which was about the end of her parents' marriage in 2009. It did seem to fuel rumors about a possible end to her marriage with Jay-Z.\n\nApril 2015\n\nIn an Instagram video that has long since been deleted along with his entire account, Jay-Z shared private footage of their vow exchange, which was shown once before at Miami‚Äôs Sun Life Stadium during the opening night of their ‚ÄúOn the Run‚Äù tour.\n\nMay 2015:\n\nOne year after ‚Äúthe incident,‚Äù Beyonc√©, Jay-Z, and Solange all attend the Met Gala in New York City together.\n\nFebruary 2016:\n\nBeyonc√© performs with Bruno Mars, Chris Martin, and the rest of Coldplay at the Super Bowl Halftime show.\n\nApril 2016\n\nOn April 23, Beyonc√© releases Lemonade album in conjunction with her HBO special of visuals. The album seems to be about her marriage, and the difficulties they've encountered after fifteen years together, including infidelity and her journey to forgiveness.\n\nOn April 27, Beyonc√© begins her Formation World Tour in Miami and dedicates her song ‚ÄúHalo‚Äù to her ‚Äúbeautiful husband.‚Äù\n\nBeyonc√©'s mom Tina Knowles Lawson said of Lemonade, saying, ‚ÄúIt could be about anyone's marriage. I think that everybody at one time or another has been betrayed and lied to and it's about the pain and it's about the healing process and it's about, ‚ÄòHow do you get past that and move on.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nMay 2016\n\nBeyonc√© attends the Met Gala solo, just over a week after the release of Lemonade. Shortly after that, Fat Joe and Remy Ma release a remix of ‚ÄúAll the Way Up‚Äù featuring Jay-Z.\n\nOn the track, he raps, ‚ÄúYou know you made it when the fact your marriage made it is worth millions / Lemonade is ‚Ä¶ a popular drink and it still is.‚Äù\n\nAugust 2016\n\nBeyonc√© performed at MTV VMAs solo, but accompanied by Blue Ivy. She won the Video of the Year award, along with seven others, and performed a medley from Lemonade. Jay-Z met up with his wife at an after-party, along with friends at the time, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.\n\nOctober 2016\n\nOn October 7, Jay-Z performs at the final show of Beyonc√©'s Formation World Tour in New Jersey.

We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. ‚Äì The Carters.‚Äù\n\nThey attended the Grammys later that month, where Beyonc√© performed pregnant once again.\n\nJune 2017\n\nBeyonc√© and Jay-Z welcome their twins in mid-June, Rumi and Sir. Later on, Jay-Z releases his 13th solo studio album, 4:44. In it, he raps about his relationships and past infidelities.\n\n‚ÄúI apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us,‚Äù he says in the lyrics. ‚ÄúAnd if my children knew, I don't even know what I would do / If they ain't look at me the same / I would prolly die with all the shame.‚Äù\n\nAugust 2017\n\nThe couple buy an $88 million Bel Air mansion and get cozy with their new family additions.\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nThe couple start the month in Philadelphia at the Made in America festival, and Jay-Z has the crowd sing ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù to Beyonc√© just before she turned 36.\n\nA few weeks later, they make their first red carpet appearance since the birth of their twins at pal Rihanna's Diamond Ball in New York at Cipriani.\n\nThat month they also take Blue Ivy to a Bruno Mars concert at Madison Square Garden, and purchase a home in the Hamptons on the beach for $26 million.\n\nOctober 2017\n\nJay-Z headlines his third annual Tidal x Brooklyn benefit concert, which raised money victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Beyonc√© was in the audience, but she did not perform.\n\nNovember 2017\n\nOn November 29, released an interview with Jay-Z in which he admitted to infidelity, and explained how he and Beyonc√© repaired their relationship, in some part through her music.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, most people walk away, and like divorce rate is like 50 percent or something 'cause most people can't see themselves,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe hardest thing is seeing pain on someone's face that you caused, and then have to deal with yourself. So, you know, most people don't want to do that. You don't want to look inside yourself. And so you walk away.‚Äù\n\nThe rapper said he went to therapy to help deal with some of these issues, and that both Lemonade and 4:44 are about their marital strife. He added that listening to those albums was ‚Äúvery, very uncomfortable,‚Äù but added, ‚ÄúWe were using our art almost like a therapy session.‚Äù\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nJay-Z was nominated for eight Grammys, and attended Clive Davis and the Recording Academy's annual pre-Grammys gala in New York. The rapper received the 2018 Salute to Industry Icons Award. At the Grammys that night, they were joined front row by Blue Ivy.\n\nBefore the event, Jay-Z sat down for an interview with CNN's Van Jones, where he again talked about cheating, saying that ‚Äúthe best apology is changed behavior,‚Äù and that the ‚Äúother side is beautiful‚Äîat least for us.‚Äù\n\nHe also shared more info about the twins, who were seven months old at the time.\n\n‚ÄúWe are in a beautiful time now because they are seven months and they can't move,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey can just coo ‚Ä¶ they just coo and you don't have to ‚Äòwait, wait, wait, wait.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ You know, they're not running anywhere yet. We are going to enjoy these couple of months until they start running, and then it's over.‚Äù\n\nMarch 2018\n\nThe couple collaborate again, this time appearing on ‚ÄúTop Off‚Äù by DJ Khaled.\n\nMid-month, they announce their On the Run II Tour, much to the excitement of fans.

I breastfed twins. I renewed my vows with my husband of ten years. I came back home to the stage to do Coachella, after pregnancy. Then my husband and I released our album together, Everything Is Love. And we‚Äôve been touring with our family around the world, and loving it. This year has been monumental for me. I thank God for everyone in my life. Thank you for all the positivity and for the beautiful birthday wishes.\n\nI‚Äôm looking forward to continuing to learn from my past, living in the present, and surrendering to the future.‚Äù\n\nFebruary 2019\n\nThe couple's album Everything Is Love won best urban contemporary album at the 2019 Grammy Awards.\n\nMarch 2019\n\nThe NAACP Image Awards honor both of them, with Beyonc√© receiving the entertainer of the year trophy, and Jay-Z taking home the president's award.\n\nApril 2019\n\nPeople reports that for their 11th wedding anniversary, the pair enjoyed a ‚Äúno-kids‚Äù trip in Mexico.\n\n‚ÄúRight after the tour ended, they took it easy,‚Äù a source said at the time. ‚ÄúThey were both beyond excited about how the tour went, but they were also tired.

Fans captured clips of the momentous occasion.\n\nJuly 2023\n\nJay-Z has been a supportive husband throughout Beyonc√©'s Renaissance world tour, traveling with her and attending her shows. But the support goes both ways: Beyonc√© shared photos of her and the couple's oldest daughter Blue Ivy Carter at the grand opening of Jay-Z's The Book of HOV exhibition at the Brooklyn Public Library. Naturally, Beyonc√© included a shot of the man of the hour alongside her in an elevator to boot.\n\nNovember 2023\n\nThursday, November 30, was the London premiere of Beyonc√© Renaissance film, and after the main event she spent the evening out with husband Jay-Z wearing a stunning diamond and pearl encrusted minidress with a massive sparkling breastplate.

In videos posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, the crowd goes wild as she speaks to them.\n\n‚ÄúI came because I love you so much,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt was very important to me to be here‚Äî right here in Bahia. The renaissance is about freedom. It‚Äôs about beauty, joy, resilience, everything that you are about. I‚Äôm so honored to be here and so happy to see your beautiful faces. I love you so much.‚Äù\n\nShe added, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nobody like y‚Äôall. You are one of one.

We love y‚Äôall, we love y‚Äôall, we want y‚Äôall to get it right. At least get it close to right. And obviously it‚Äôs subjective. Obviously it‚Äôs subjective because, you know, it‚Äôs music and it‚Äôs opinion-based. But some things, you know.‚Äù\n\nHe continued, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to embarrass this young lady [Beyonc√©], but she has more Grammys than everyone, and never won Album of the Year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn‚Äôt work. Think about that: the most Grammys, never won Album of the Year. That doesn‚Äôt work... Some of you gonna go home tonight and feel like you‚Äôve been robbed; some of you may get robbed. Some of you don‚Äôt belong in the category. No, when I get nervous, I tell the truth.‚Äù\n\nShe laughed from the audience.\n\nA few weeks later on February 20, Beyonc√© expanded her business enterprises with C√©cred, a hair product brand. In a rare interview with Essence Magazine, she talked about becoming a mother and how she cut off her hair in 2013.\n\n‚ÄúI remember the day I decided to just cut all my hair off,‚Äù Beyonc√© began. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a particular style in mind. It wasn‚Äôt an aesthetic choice, but it was a very big emotional transformation and metamorphosis that I was going through. So much of my identity as a performer has been connected to flowing hair. Cutting my hair off was me rebelling against being this woman that society thinks I‚Äôm supposed to be.‚Äù\n\nShe went on, ‚ÄúI was a new mother, and something about the liberation of becoming a mother made me want to just shed all of that. It was a physical representation of me shedding the expectations put upon me. I just wanted it off. Neal Farinah, my hairstylist and friend, was freaking out because it was really long, really thick and really healthy. I just got the scissors and chopped it off. It was very intentional. And it was what I needed to do. And after that, I became super brave. It was the first step to many more audacious decisions I made in my life and my career that have led to who I am now.‚Äù\n\nApril 2024\n\nBeyonc√© returned the tribute while accepting the Innovator Award at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards.\n\n‚ÄúMy husband. My rock. My best friend,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù\n\nShe added, ‚ÄúMy three beautiful children who continue to be my inspiration and my biggest blessing.‚Äù"
