        "text": "Jay Z’s mom, Gloria Carter, has a lot to be thankful this Mother’s Day.\n\nBetween the awaited birth of her twin grandchildren and a son who’s dedicated to making her dreams come to life, she says she’s “in awe everyday.”\n\n“I’m very excited about the new kids coming into the family,” she tells PEOPLE exclusively about Beyoncé and Jay Z’s twins, whose due date is fast approaching.\n\nWhile Carter may be well known as the grandmother of 5-year-old Blue Ivy, ever since 2003 she has also been working hard to help less-fortunate individuals facing socio-economic hardships further their education at post secondary institutions through the Shawn Carter Foundation (SCF).\n\nSince retiring from her job years ago, Carter spoke with her Grammy award-winning and platinum-selling son about taking her passions and putting them into a project to help the hardworking and “underserved children that weren’t being addressed” across the country.\n\n“He asked me what I wanted to do and I told him I wanted to start a foundation, so we started the foundation to address the underserved—children that have a desire to go to college but can’t get the funding. So that was the reason why I started the foundation,” she says of how the idea came to life.\n\n“There are so many young people who have a desire to continue their education and be all that they can be, but when you have that desire and you don’t have support or money, you can’t do it,” she continues. “For me, it became very important because there are so many people that don’t have it.”\n\nThe SCF is also partnering with eBay for Charity and Roc Nation to provide fans with the opportunity to donate and bid on unforgettable experiences and signed memorabilia from Roc Nation artists and athletes, such as signed guitars from Nick Jonas and DNCE, a VIP lounge party at the 40/40 Club in New York City and Made In America VIP passes.\n\nOne hundred percent of proceeds from these items will benefit Shawn Carter Foundation."
