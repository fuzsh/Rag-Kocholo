The occasion was marked by Carter himself, who visited the University Forum in Manhattanville for a conversation with Jelani Cobb, Ira A. Lipman Professor of Journalism. Their dialogue, and a lively Q + A session, touched on Carter’s music as well as his perspective—as an artist, activist, and philanthropist—on American life and culture.",

Their dialogue, and a lively Q + A session, touched on Carter’s music as well as his perspective—as an artist, activist, and philanthropist—on American life and culture.\n\nDrawing inspiration from Carter’s multimedia success, the series will aim to provide fresh perspectives on campus by spotlighting artists, musicians, dancers, writers, public intellectuals, and activists as well as scholars and other noteworthy contributors to African American and African Diaspora Studies."
