        "text": "GEOFF BENNETT: Right now in New York City, you can find the unlikely pairing of two Brooklyn icons, the Brooklyn Public Library, one of the largest library systems in the country, and hip-hop's elder statesman, Jay-Z.\n\nSpecial correspondent Christopher Booker reports on a timely exhibition as part of this year's 50th anniversary of the birth of hip-hop.\n\nIt's part of our arts and culture series, Canvas.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Wrapped around the outside of the Brooklyn Public Library's central branch, rap lyrics from the last 25 years, inside its grand lobby, the hands of the man who wrote them, Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter.\n\nThis hand gesture, in the shape of a diamond or rock, originally represented his Roc-A-Fella record label.\n\nIt's now synonymous with the rapper himself, says Desiree Perez, a longtime friend of Jay-Z's and CEO of his entertainment empire, Rock Nation.\n\nDESIREE PEREZ, CEO, Roc Nation: Anywhere you go in the world, any concert ever Jay's been at or places that he goes in this crowd, people know what that means.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Famed for his lyricism, Jay-Z is one of the world's bestselling artists, with over 140 million records sold.\n\nThe first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriter Hall of Fame, he's ranked by both \"Rolling Stone\" and Billboard magazine as one of the 100 greatest artists of all time.\n\nNow he's commemorated in a sprawling 40,000-square foot exhibition in this library, which continues to serve patrons.\n\nThis isn't exactly a normal experience inside a library.\n\nLINDA E. JOHNSON, President, Brooklyn Public Library: No, it's not.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: But the free exhibition, curated by Roc Nation, is entirely consistent with the Brooklyn Public Library's mission, says its president, Linda Johnson.\n\nLINDA E. JOHNSON: This is a career that was built on the written word.\n\nLiteracy is everything to us.\n\nJay-Z is a very important Brooklynite, and we like to honor our own, and we're proud to be affiliated with him.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: The project is called The Book of Hov.\n\nHov is short for J-Hova, a nickname Jay-Z explained to NPR's Terry Gross back in 2010.\n\nJAY-Z, Rapper: One time, I was recording in the studio, and I wasn't writing.\n\nAnd one of my friends was like: \"Man, this is like -- how are you doing that, man?\n\nGod must really love you.\n\nIt's like a religious experience, man.\"\n\nAnd then he was like, \"J-Hova.\"\n\nAnd then it started out as a joke, and then it just stuck.\n\nLINDA E. JOHNSON: This is all instruments, the whole thing, the accordion, the old victrola.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Featuring thousands of pieces of memorabilia, as well as music and art, spread across eight spaces, visitors can trace Jay-Z's journey, from his early days in a Brooklyn public housing complex, where he survived dealing drugs during the crack cocaine epidemic, to the world stage.\n\nLINDA E. JOHNSON: We're telling a story about people who don't necessarily think their stories will be found.\n\nAnd we're saying, come into the library and find your own story, whether it's in the exhibition that you're walking through, or whether it's in the books on our shelves.\n\nDESIREE PEREZ: '01, '02, '03.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: In the library's main atrium, covers of Jay-Z's 13 solo albums, from his self-released debut, \"Reasonable Doubt,\" to his most recent, \"4:44.\"\n\nCollectively, the work is an anthology of Jay-Z's life before and after superstardom.\n\nDESIREE PEREZ: He says that he's speaking for the people.\n\nHe speaks for the ghetto, for the voiceless.\n\nLINDA E. JOHNSON: Yes.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Through a side door... DESIREE PEREZ: This is the real equipment, by the way, that was used at the time.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: ... there's a full-scale replica of Manhattan's Baseline Studios, where Jay-Z wrote and recorded some of his seminal albums.\n\nThe space was made famous in his 2004 documentary, \"Fade to Black.\"\n\nMAN: Sometimes, you work with people because they legends.\n\nOther times, they just hot.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: But as hip-hop's first billionaire, the exhibition shows how Jay-Z's story is about more than music.\n\nAfter being rejected by all the major music labels, Jay-Z founded Roc-A-Fella Records.\n\nAnd as his music footprint expanded, so too did his business empire.\n\nJay-Z is both an artist and an entrepreneur, a businessperson and a writer.\n\nBut he seems to basically walk this unbelievable line.\n\nLINDA E. JOHNSON: I think that his career defies those kinds of definitions, as does the experience that you have here.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: The elaborate exhibition started with a phone call.\n\nJohnson wanted to commemorate the 50th anniversary of hip-hop by honoring Jay-Z at a Brooklyn Public Library gala and called Perez.\n\nLINDA E. JOHNSON: I started yammering away about all the reasons that the library was deserving.\n\nWe're the most democratic institution in our society.\n\nWe're free and open and accessible to everybody, blah, blah, blah.\n\nAnd all of a sudden, Desiree says: \"How many square feet is that building?\"\n\n(LAUGHTER) LINDA E. JOHNSON: And I said 350,000 square feet.\n\nAnd all of a sudden, the whole nature of the conversation changed.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Perez had spent years looking at different venues to showcase Jay-Z's vast collection of ephemera.\n\nDESIREE PEREZ: Nothing ever felt right.\n\nIt just didn't feel right.\n\nIt didn't feel like it belonged.\n\nAnd when I heard Linda speak, it just seemed like the perfect place that she was describing.\n\nAnd it's a public space and it lends itself to everyone.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: On the day we visited, visitors praised the space.\n\nRonald Fields was in town from Atlanta and came straight from the airport.\n\nRONALD FIELDS, Visitor: When I Googled it, I had to double-check.\n\nAnd I'm like, whoa, it's a library?\n\nSo, I didn't know that.\n\nBut it's really cool that it's here, actually.\n\nI wish we had something like this back at home.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Thomas Sorger has listened to the rapper for 20 years.\n\nTHOMAS SORGER, Visitor: I think the library is the premier institution for making accessible the finest examples of our country's culture.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Has the library ever done anything of this scale?\n\nLINDA E. JOHNSON: No, not even close.\n\n(LAUGHTER) LINDA E. JOHNSON: Our door count has tripled.\n\nOur new library card registrations have doubled.\n\nSo, everything has just been magnified.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: A limited edition line of Jay-Z library cards released at branches across the borough has become, in the words of The New York Times -- quote -- \"the merch of the moment.\"\n\nWhile Jay-Z is bringing more people into the library, he also continues to bring younger generations into the arts.\n\nKOTA THE FRIEND, Rapper: The first beat that I ever rapped over was a Jay-Z beat.\n\nHe gave me the template, and I just put in my words.\n\nAnd that's -- that was the beginning of it.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Thirty-year-old rapper Kota the Friend grew up in Brooklyn listening to his brother's Jay-Z C.D.s.\n\nKOTA THE FRIEND: It was like a real education.\n\nLike, I'm listening to the lyrics.\n\nI'm learning how to use my words.\n\nI'm learning how to say things without saying them, you know?\n\nLike, it taught me poetry.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Kota the Friend turned down record labels to stay independent.\n\nHe keeps all the profit from the millions who stream his music each month.\n\nHe also owns a fashion and entertainment brand.\n\nDo you think that was possible or was that even a path that you saw without Jay-Z?\n\nKOTA THE FRIEND: I think Jay-Z really gave us the confidence, you know?\n\nLike, it wasn't a big thing when he was coming up for people, for artists, especially hip-hop artists, to be independent and be doing their own thing.\n\nBecause he exists, we all exist.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Back at the library, Tanya Joyner (ph), a Brooklyn native, echoed that sentiment and quoted another legendary local rapper, the late Biggie Smalls.\n\nTANYA JOYNER, Visitor: I think the words are Biggie always, who would think hip-hop would make it this far?\n\nThat's definitely real, definitely real.\n\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: The exhibition has been extended until December 4.\n\nFor the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Christopher Booker in Brooklyn, New York."
