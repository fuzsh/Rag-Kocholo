        "text": "Jay-Z has helped raise a generous amount of money for future college students.\n\nOn Saturday (Nov. 16), the Shawn Carter Foundation held its inaugural gala at the newly renovated Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Fla. During the gala, Hov, his wife Beyonce and his mother Gloria Carter welcomed a slew of celebrities like Alicia Keys, Swizz Beatz, Meek Mill, DJ Khaled, Fabolous, Normani, Yo Gotti and more to the guitar-shaped hotel for a lavish night of fine dining with D'Usse-inspired cocktails. The gala raised a grand total of $6 million.\n\n“Equipping our youth with the tools to succeed will always be a priority for me and my family,\" Jay-Z said via the foundation's publicist. \"I’m looking forward to continuing that mission at this year’s Shawn Carter Foundation Gala Weekend, where we’ll celebrate our scholars and continue to support young people in a meaningful way.”\n\nRobin Roberts of ABC's Good Morning America served as the Master of Ceremonies for the evening while other celebrities from outside of the music world like Patriots owner Robert Kraft, clothing designer Dapper Dan, comedian Michael Blackson, Tyler Perry and more were in attendance at the gala.\n\nThe proceeds from the entire weekend, which also included a Black Jack tournament inside the casino, will benefit the non-profit organization's scholarship fund along with study aboard opportunities and other goodwill programs for underprivileged families in need.\n\nThe earnings from the weekend will also help fund college prep workshops and bus tours like the foundation's annual Black college bus tour. Earlier this year, the 12th installment of the program kicked off with a trip to Georgia-based Historically Black Colleges, Morehouse College and Spelman College.\n\nSince the tour was established in 2007, the Shawn Carter Foundation has helped teenagers from 125 schools in the New York/New Jersey area get into various college prep courses. The foundation has also given students the opportunity to speak with college counselors and past scholars who've participated in the program.\n\nCheck out photos from the Shawn Carter Foundation's inaugural gala and Black Jack tournament below."
