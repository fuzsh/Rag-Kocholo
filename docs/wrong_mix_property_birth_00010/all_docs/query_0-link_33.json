        "text": "Through his Shawn Carter Foundation inaugural gala, JAY-Z helped raise $6 million toward funding post-secondary education opportunities for future students. On Saturday (Nov. 16), Hov, his mother Gloria Carter and Beyoncé hosted a star-studded gala and blackjack tournament at the newly renovated Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, FL.\n\nAlicia Keys performed at the event, which saw the likes of Swizz Beatz, Meek Mill, DJ Khaled, Fabolous, Michael Blackson, Tyler Perry, Yo Gotti and more in attendance. Robin Roberts of ABC’s “Good Morning America” served as the weekend’s MC.\n\nThe blackjack tables, which required a $100,000 buy-in, were not too kind to Yo Gotti. DJ Akademiks shared a video on Instagram, where Yo Gotti can be seen losing half a million dollars in the game.\n\n“Oh my goodness!” Hov can be heard exclaiming.\n\nSprint Executive Chairman, Marcelo Claure, won the $500,000 blackjack grand prize, which the Shawn Carter Foundation tweeted he donated to the charity.\n\n“Thank you @marceloclaure for donating your grand prize back to charity!” the organization tweeted on Sunday (Nov. 17).\n\nThe proceeds from the weekend-long event and blackjack tournament benefitted JAY-Z’s Shawn Carter Foundation scholarship fund, college prep workshops and the organization’s Annual HBCU College Bus Tour.\n\n“Equipping our youth with the tools to succeed will always be a priority for me and my family,” JAY-Z previously said in a press statement about the gala. “I’m looking forward to continuing that mission at this year’s Shawn Carter Foundation Gala Weekend, where we’ll celebrate our scholars and continue to support young people in a meaningful way.”\n\nJAY-Z and his mother, Gloria Carter, launched the Shawn Carter Foundation back in 2003 to provide financial support and education opportunities to low-income students. The foundation has gone on to offer the Scholarship Fund, College Prep, International Exchange and Study Abroad, Community and Goodwill programs and the Annual HBCU Bus Tour."
