        "text": "Jay Z's 'old-school' mom stresses education, work ethic\n\nNEW YORK — \"My son says that if you can dream it, you can achieve it,\" says Gloria Carter, co-founder and CEO of the Shawn Carter Foundation. \"All you have to do is put the work in.\"\n\nCertainly, the career trajectory of Shawn Carter — better known to most of us as rapper/entrepreneur/cultural icon Jay Z — would seem to prove that theory. But Ms. Carter is well aware that her younger son's story is an exceptional one, and hardly represents the most practical model for success.\n\nThat's why, in 2003, she and Jay Z launched the foundation, a registered public charity that aims to give young people facing socioeconomic hardships access to institutions of higher learning.\n\n'Once you give them motivation, they need support'\n\n\"The underserved have so many problems,\" says Carter, sitting in her modest office at the Midtown headquarters for Roc Nation, Jay Z's entertainment company. \"Sometimes they need someone to give them a hand.\"\n\nTo that end, the foundation has provided more than $2.4 million to support initiatives such as its scholarship fund, annual college tours, counseling, study-abroad programs and holiday toy and meal drives.\n\nThe fund currently serves 176 students at 130 institutions across the country, according to executive director Dania Diaz. They're typically from low-income homes and often the first in their families to attend college, she says. \"We have kids who act as the moms and dads of their families, kids who are products of the foster care system, kids who were in prison. They still want to pursue a further education, whether it's at a four-year institution or a community college or vocational school.\"\n\nCarter says that instilling a sense of personal responsibility in the students is key. \"I'm an old-school person. I believe that you work for what you want — you don't sit around and wait for someone to give it to you,\" she says. \"But once you give them motivation, they need support.\"\n\nKnowing from experience\n\nCarter herself worked 30 years for the New York City comptroller, moving from clerk to investment analyst. After she and Jay Z's father separated, following 13 years of marriage, she essentially raised her four children — two sons and two daughters — on her own. (The foundation's scholarship recipients include single moms as well.) \"Sometimes I took on an extra job as a security guard to make ends meet,\" Carter says.\n\nShe continued working after Jay Z's career began taking off. \"Jay had a problem with that,\" Carter recalls, smiling gently. He and his siblings eventually arranged a meeting \"to talk to me about retiring.\" She was persuaded, but a year after doing so she started getting itchy. \"I was bored.\"\n\nThe spark for the foundation arrived when Carter was invited to attend the graduation of a young man she had mentored in a work-study program at the comptroller's office. \"He started speaking about this woman who had made an impact on his life. I didn't even realize that I had been a mentor — I was just trying to help this young man. After that, I realized there are so many people who need to be touched.\"\n\nThe public aspect of her role doesn't come naturally, Carter insists. \"People don't believe this, but I'm shy. I shy away from taking pictures, from giving speeches. But I'm learning to take steps to give us more exposure,\" she says.\n\nNot all of that exposure has been welcome. Last year, after Jay Z announced he would partner with Barneys New York on a holiday collection to raise funds for the foundation, two African Americans claimed they had been racially profiled while shopping at the luxury retailer's flagship store on Madison Avenue.\n\nJay Z came under criticism, and eventually released a statement indicating that he would continue with the collaboration \"under the condition that I have a leadership role and seat on a council specifically convened to deal with the issue of racial profiling.\" It was also announced that all sales from the collection, which grossed more than $1 million, would benefit the Shawn Carter Foundation.\n\nThe episode doesn't appear to have tainted the foundation's relationship with its partners, which include the Benjamin Gilman International Scholarship Program of the Institute of International Education. Allan Goodman, the IIE's president and CEO, notes that most of the young adults studying abroad as a result of supplemental funds provided to that program (administered by the IIE on behalf of the Department of State) by the Shawn Carter Foundation \"do volunteer or social community service, which sets a very powerful example in other countries.\"\n\nFamily first\n\nCarter also sees mentoring as part of her role as a grandmother — and not just to Blue Ivy, Jay Z and Beyoncé's 2-year-old daughter. She has eight grandchildren, and one great-grandchild, and keeps their parents as close to her New Jersey home as possible. (Carter's elder son, who lives in upstate New York, is the furthest away, geographically.)\n\n\"We're always together as a family — talking, eating,\" Carter says. She \"sneaks\" treats to the grandkids, but also is keen to stress to them \"the importance of having an education, and of being a good person. In order to get respect, you have to give it.\"\n\nCarter's sisters and mother live nearby as well, and she is also generally interested in the challenges faced by men and women in her own age group and older. She may eventually expand her philanthropic efforts to include them.\n\n\"As a retired senior citizen, you deal with Social Security, changes in your health care,\" Carter says. \"You can feel that you've been forgotten. I believed that the money I contributed to this system while I was working would be used to take care of me later, but you see senior citizens getting the short end of the stick.\"\n\nCarter has no immediate plans to form another foundation: \"Maybe in five or six years,\" she says. \"But it's another passion, definitely.\""
