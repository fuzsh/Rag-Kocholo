        "text": "As They Sleep is a technical death metal band that originated out of Detroit, Michigan in the United States. The band was formed in 2003 by Vocalist Aaron Bridgewater and two other members, with the two remaining members joining later.[1]\n\nHistory[]\n\nAs They Sleep began in 2003 between three members of the band, with the other two joining on soon thereafter, which rounded the lineup out with Vocalist Aaron Bridgewater, Guitarists Nick Morris, and Barry Gomez, Bassist Derek Kosiba, and Drummer Paul Burklett.[1][2] The band released a self-titled EP in 2005, independently.[2]\n\nFollowing the EP's release, the band signed with Morris' label, Luxor Records.[3] The band would record and release their debut album, Blacken the Sun via Luxor.[2] The album would become very successful and define their death metal style.[4] After the release of the album, the band would sign with Solid State Records.[5] Soon after signing with the label, the band released their sophomore album, Dynasty, which was also very well received.[6][7][8]\n\nThe band seemingly went on hiatus, being active enough to depart from Solid State and resigning with Luxor.
