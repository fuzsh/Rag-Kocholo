As Bain Capital was growing in prominence, Mitt returned to his old consulting firm, Bain & Company, as CEO.When Mitt was elected Governor of Massachusetts in 2002, the state was in severe disarray. Facing a state legislature dominated by Democrats, Mitt cast more than 800 vetoes as he brought conservative principles to state government. He cut red tape for small businesses, signed into law job-creating incentives, and fought hard to bring new businesses to the state. He eliminated a $3 billion deficit without borrowing or raising taxes. By 2007, at the end of Mitt's term, the state had accumulated a $2 billion rainy day fund in its coffers.This stringent fiscal discipline provided an essential backdrop for economic recovery. When Mitt came into office, the state was losing jobs every month. When he left office, the economy was generating new jobs by the thousands.
