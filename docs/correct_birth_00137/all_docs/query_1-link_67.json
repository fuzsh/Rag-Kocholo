        "text": "BELMONT — In a quiet development of luxury townhouses near McLean Hospital, Micah Dornfeld, a 20-year-old college sophomore taking classes at Harvard Extension School, parks her car with a bumper sticker supporting Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nIt would be unremarkable if not for Dornfeld's address – she lives down the block from Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann. Dornfeld's car – bumper sticker and all – was sniffed by Secret Service dogs on Election Day. \"The street's full of Democrats,\" Dornfeld said. \"I'm proud to have voted for Obama.\"\n\nIn losing his bid for the presidency, Romney did not only lose his home state, Massachusetts, by the largest margin of any presidential candidate, but he also lost his hometown of Belmont, getting 4,728 votes to Obama’s 9,108. Few Belmont residents were surprised, given the demographics in a town where there are nearly four times as many registered Democrats as Republicans.\n\nBelmont residents, like the rest of the country, weighed economic plans and social policy when casting their ballots. But Romney’s neighbors also faced unique consequences – the “coolness” factor of living in a president’s hometown versus the nuisance of road closures and curiosity-seekers.\n\n“It’s a nice little town,” said Kiril Sinkel, a Belmont retiree walking his dog on Monday. “It would have been too big a price to pay. There’s no reason to want to attract the traffic and security.”\n\nRomney has strong local ties. He moved to Belmont in 1971, raised his five sons there, and has been a leader in the local Mormon church. His son Tagg Romney lives with his family in Belmont. Three years ago, Mitt and Ann Romney sold their 6,400-square-foot home in Belmont and moved into a 1,700-square-foot townhouse in a development called The Woodlands at Belmont Hill (they also have a large home in La Jolla, Calif., which they started renovating before the campaign, and a vacation home in New Hampshire).\n\nTown residents said though Romney is often away, they do sometimes see him in the center of town. When Romney and his family dine at il Casale, an Italian restaurant, local high school kids run down to catch a glimpse, said Leslie Wolf, a saleswoman at Belmont Toys. Wolf’s colleague, Shelley MacDonald, said Romney’s wife and children have come into the toy store to buy toys for Romney’s grandchildren.\n\nBelmont has a population of around 25,000. Long-time residents say until the 1970s, the town was mostly conservative. But it has since become increasingly liberal, in line with bordering towns such as Cambridge, Arlington and Watertown – which are some of the more Democratic towns in Massachusetts. Belmont Realtor Dorothy O’Connor said the town attracts a lot of people in academia because of its proximity to Boston and its strong school system.\n\nO’Connor, who works for Lawndale Realty and lives in Belmont, said she thought a Romney win would have been good for the town. “It probably would have put it on the map,” she said. O’Connor said now, people simply refer to Belmont as a suburb of Boston, without recognizing its charm as a small town in its own right. “It’s always nice to see Belmont on TV, to hear people talk about it,” she said.\n\nO’Connor, like others, attributes Romney’s hometown loss to demographics. “It’s just a highly Democratic town. It would have been hard for him to have won,” she said.\n\nMany Belmont voters say they did not think about the hometown ramifications when casting their ballots. Belmont residents Lily Cudmore, 23, who works as support staff in a public school, and her sister Becky Cudmore, 27, who is in a doctoral program, both voted for Obama. Becky Cudmore dislikes Romney’s views on social issues like gay marriage and women’s rights; Lily Cudmore worried he would cut federal funding for national service programs.\n\n“If I were more on board with his politics, I would have been proud to have the president from our hometown,” Becky Cudmore said. But given Romney’s views, “I’m definitely not disappointed (in the results),” Lily Cudmore said.\n\nBob and Sheila Lunday are independent voters who supported Romney because of his views on jobs and the economy. Bob Lunday, 61, is a retired truck driver; Sheila Lunday, 65, is a nurse. The couple has lived in Belmont for 35 years. The two did not think about Belmont when casting their vote. But Bob Lunday said the only upside for him of an Obama victory is that the town will not have to deal with hosting a sitting president.\n\n“I just don’t want that hoopla in town,” he said. “Any time the president goes outside Washington, D.C. it’s very disruptive to people who live there.”\n\nSheila Lunday quickly added, “We would have rather him win and put up with that, right honey?”\n\nHer husband didn’t answer."
