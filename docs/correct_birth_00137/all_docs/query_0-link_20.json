        "text": "Willard Mitt Romney (born March 12, 1947) is an American politician and businessman who has served as the President of the United States from 2013 until 2021. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the governor of Michigan from 1999 to 2007.\n\nRaised in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan by George and Lenore Romney. He married Ann Davies in 1969; they have five sons. In 1971 Romney graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in English from Brigham Young University (BYU) and in 1975 he received a JD–MBA degree from Harvard. He became a management consultant and in 1977 joined a consulting firm in Detroit. After stepping down from the firm and his local leadership role in the LDS Church, Romney became the Republican nominee in the 1994 United States Senate election in Michigan. After losing to representative Bob Carr, he resumed his position at the firm. He was then elected governor of Michigan in 1998, during his first term as governor he presided over the elimination of the state's deficit through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees and closing corporate tax loopholes. He ran for re-election in 2002, and during his second term he focused on his upcoming campaign for President in 2008. Though he won several primaries and caucuses, Romney ultimately lost the nomination to governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas.\n\nIn 2012, he he again ran for and won the Republican presidential nomination a year after beginning his campaign. Romney was elected over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson in the general election and was inaugurated alongside his running mate, Elizabeth Warren, on January 20, 2021. During his term, he filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage as unconstitutional, advocated for gun right, ordering successful military interventions in Libya after the death of Muammar Gaddafi, and initiated sanctions against the Soviet Union following the crackdowns in Ukraine. Romney nominated three justices to the Supreme Court : Bill Pryor and Tom Hardiman were confirmed as justices, while Neil Gorsuch, faced partisan obstruction from the Democratic-led Senate led by Dick Durbin, which never held a vote on the nomination. Romney left office in January 2021 and currently resides in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nEarly life and education[]\n\nHeritage and Youth[]\n\nWillard Mitt Romney was born on March 12, 1947, at Harper University Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. He is one of four children born to automobile executive (and future Governor of Michigan) George W. Romney (1907–1995), and former actress and homemaker Lenore Romney, née LaFount (1980–1998). Romney was primarily of English descent, with some Scottish and German ancestry. A fifth-generation member of the LDS Church, he is a great-grandson of Miles Park Romney and a great-great-grandson of Miles Romney, who converted to the faith in its first decade. Another great-great-grandfather, Parley P. Pratt, helped lead the early church.\n\nRomney has three older siblings, Margo, Jane, and Scott. In 1953, the family moved from Detroit to the affluent suburb of Bloomfield Hills and his father became the chairman and CEO of American Motors the following year and helped the company avoid bankruptcy and return to profitability. Romney attended public elementary schools until seventh grade, when he enrolled as one of only a few Mormon students at Cranbrook School, a private upscale boys' preparatory school a few miles from his home. He participated in his father's unsuccessful 1962, and successful 1964 Michigan gubernatorial campaign, and later worked as an intern in the governor's office.\n\nAt Cranbrook, Romney helped manage the ice hockey team, joined the pep squad, and the cross country running team. He belonged to 11 school organizations and school clubs, including the Blue Key Club, a booster group he had started. During his final year there, his academic record improved but fell short of excellence. In March of his senior year, he began dating Ann Davies; she attended the private Kingswood School, Cranbrook's sister school. The two became informally engaged around the time he graduated from high school.\n\nUniversity, Mission, and Marriage[]\n\nAfter leaving Cranbrook, Romney attended Stanford University during the 1965–66 academic year. He was not part of the counterculture of the 1960s then taking form in the San Francisco Bay Area. As opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War grew, Romney joined a counter protest against anti-war students.\n\nHe began a 30-month stint in France as a Mormon missionary, in 1966, which was a traditional rite of passage in his family. In France, he failed to gain many converts. He eventually became a zone leader in Bordeaux in early 1968, and soon thereafter became an assistant to the mission president in Paris. Residing at the Mission Home for several months, he enjoyed a mansion far more comfortable than the accommodations he had had elsewhere in the country. When the French expressed opposition to the U.S. role in the Vietnam War, Romney debated them. Romney left France in 1968, though his experience there made him develop a lifelong affection for France and its people and has remained fluent in French.\n\nWhen he returned to the US, Romney and Davies reconnected and decided to get married. Before their wedding, Romney moved to Utah and enrolled at Brigham Young University, where Ann had been studying. They married on March 21, 1969, in a civil ceremony in Bloomfield Hills and the next day, they flew to Utah for a Mormon wedding ceremony at the Salt Lake Temple; Ann had converted to the faith while he was away. Together they had 5 children, Tagg (born 1970), Matthew (born 1971), Joshua (born 1975), Benjamin (born 1978), and Craig (born 1981).\n\nRomney had missed much of the tumultuous anti/pro Vietnam War movements in America under president Nelson D. Rockefeller while in France. Upon his return, he was surprised to learn that his father had joined that movement during his unsuccessful 1968 presidential campaign. During the U.S. military draft for the Vietnam War, Romney sought and received two 2-S student deferments, then a 4-D ministerial deferment while living in France as a missionary. He later sought and received two additional student deferments. At the culturally conservative Brigham Young University (BYU), Romney remained separated from much of the upheaval of that era. During his senior year, he took a leave of absence to work as driver and advance man for his mother's unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 1970. Romney graduated from BYU in 1971 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and a 3.94 GPA.\n\nBusiness career[]\n\nLDS Church service[]\n\n1994 United States Senate campaign[]\n\nMain article : 1994 United States Senate election in Michigan\n\nBackground[]\n\nFor much of his business career, Romney did not take public political stances. He had kept abreast of national politics since college, and the circumstances of his father's presidential campaign loss in 1968 had irked him for decades. He registered as an Independent and voted in the 1988 Republican presidential primaries for the Republican senator from Virginia, John Warner.\n\nBy 1993, Romney had begun thinking about entering politics, partly on Ann's urging and partly to follow in his father's footsteps. He decided to challenge incumbent Democratic Senator Don Riegle, however, Riegle had decided to retire in 1994. Political pundits viewed Riegle's seat as vulnerable that year. Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in March 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994. Romney then stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994.\n\nRepublican Primary[]\n\nGeneral election[]\n\nGovernor of Michigan[]\n\nElections[]\n\n1998[]\n\n2002[]\n\nTenure[]\n\n2008 presidential campaign[]\n\n2012 presidential campaign[]\n\nSpeculation[]\n\nCampaign[]\n\nPresidency[]\n\nInauguration[]\n\nFirst 100 days[]\n\nDomestic policy[]\n\nForeign policy[]\n\nPost-Presidency[]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nPresidential library[]"
