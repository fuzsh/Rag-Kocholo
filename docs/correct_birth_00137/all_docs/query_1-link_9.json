        "text": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\n\nA New Yorker Best Book of 2023\n\nAn NPR Best Book of 2023\n\n“Engrossing…one of the best political books I’ve read in years, and it provides key insights into how drastically the Republican Party has shifted in the decade since Romney was its presidential nominee.”\n\n—Scott Detrow, host of NPR’s All Things Considered\n\n“Revealing…Romney: A Reckoning is in many ways a straightforward biography, but it has the intimacy of a small subgenre of political confessions...throughout Coppins’s narrative Trump, the supposed billionaire, morphs from comic relief into devouring nemesis….While should-have-known-better Republican colleagues waffled…Romney kept his head above the fetid waters.”\n\n—Tom Mallon, New York Times\n\n“A scoop-rich biography…An especially clear window onto the forces that over the last decade have transformed the GOP….Coppins gained extraordinary access…The tell-all tales gush forth.”\n\n—Los Angeles Times\n\n“Rare access…a reminder that meritocratic success in business is not easily translatable into democratic politics. What lessons should one draw from a wealthy, talented and decent man who attempts to lead a political party in the throes of a populist revolt? Above all, take care not to sacrifice one’s family, faith, and integrity.”\n\n—Wall Street Journal\n\n“An astonishing, nearly unprecedented catalog of intraparty critique… it’s also, and maybe all the more importantly, a deft study of the capacity for rationalization…this is what makes this book so interesting, and also important.”\n\n—Politico\n\n“A rare feat in modern-day political reporting: an account in which the subject engages in actual introspection.”\n\n—New Yorker\n\n“The soon-to-be ex-senator shared a vast trove with biographer McKay Coppins for this book [which] has already scored in the marketplace of tittle-tattle, yielding several items worthy of Page Six, if not Page One. Coppins adds considerable value.”\n\n—Washington Post\n\n“A complex book about a complex man, one that provides an unusually revelatory look at a prominent political figure’s private views and inner conflicts.”\n\n—Boston Globe\n\n“[A] probing biography...a penetrating analysis of the ongoing Republican civil war through the eyes of one of its last embattled centrists.”\n\n—Publishers Weekly\n\n“A memorable distillation of a life in politics, of the tension between high principle and unseemly justification. It’s a tension Romney has navigated better than most, in part for his willingness to acknowledge its existence.”\n\n—Carlos Lozada, New York Times"
