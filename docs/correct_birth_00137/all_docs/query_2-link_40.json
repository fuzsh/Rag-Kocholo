In the Senate, I’ve been proud to cosponsor the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to prohibit abortions after the 20-week mark, the point at which evidence suggests an unborn child is able to feel pain. I also support the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would ensure that a child who survives an abortion receives necessary medical care, just like any other baby. When a child is born alive, there is no question that the child should be cared for.\n\nWhile most regulation of abortion takes place at the state level, I oppose abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother, and I support longstanding federal prohibitions on taxpayer funding for abortion."
