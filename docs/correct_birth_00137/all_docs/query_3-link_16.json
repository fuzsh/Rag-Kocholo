        "text": "Due to an expected capacity crowd for Governor Romney’s presentation today, please note that you can watch a live stream of the program from your computer or digital device.\n\nThe program, which will feature Romney in conversation with Law School faculty including Dean Nancy Staudt, Vice Provost Adrienne Davis, and Adam Rosenzweig, is also part of the law school’s Public Interest Law and Policy Speakers Series. The event is free and open to the public, although priority seating will be given to the campus community.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor’s degree from Brigham Young University and a joint MBA/JD degree from Harvard University, Romney conducted missionary work in France for the Mormon Church.\n\nBefore entering politics, he carved out a successful career in business, first working for the management consulting firm, Bain & Company before leaving to co-found the investment firm, Bain Capital in 1984. During his tenure as chief executive officer, Romney became known for his ability to restore financial health to failing companies.\n\nHis first foray into the political arena came a decade later, challenging the Democratic stronghold of Edward (Ted) Kennedy in Massachusetts for a seat in the U.S. Senate. After he was defeated, Romney rejoined Bain Capital.\n\nRomney gained national notoriety in 1999 when he took over as president of the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee. He was credited for rescuing the 2002 Winter Olympic Games from financial and ethical problems, which he detailed in his book, “Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership, and the Olympic Games.”\n\nOn the heels of that success, Romney returned to politics and was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2003. Hallmarks of his administration included the reduction of a $3 billion deficit, and the institution of a major health care reform initiative providing near-universal insurance coverage for Massachusetts citizens. The law, sometimes referred to as “Romneycare,” served as a model for the Obama Administration’s national health care overhaul.\n\nAt the end of his term, Romney made his first bid for the U.S. Presidency, but lost the nomination to Arizona Senator John McCain. He published his second book, “No Apology: The Case for American Greatness” before announcing his candidacy again in 2012. This time he secured the Republican nomination, but lost to Barack Obama.\n\nHis career trajectory mirrors that of his father, George Romney, who ran a large corporation (American Motors Company) until he was elected governor of Michigan. After losing a presidential bid to Richard Nixon, the elder Romney served as Nixon’s Secretary of Housing.\n\nSince 2012, Romney has not held public office but has remained a major figure in Republican politics, if not in the spotlight. That changed last November when it was announced that he was on President-elect Trump’s short list for Secretary of State."
