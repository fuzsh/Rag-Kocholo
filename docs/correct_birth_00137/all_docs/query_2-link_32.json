        "text": "Mitt Romney United States Senator from Utah Incumbent Assumed office:\n\nJanuary 3, 2019\n\nServing with Mike Lee Preceded by: Orrin Hatch 70th Governor of Massachusetts In office:\n\nJanuary 2, 2003 - January 6, 2011 Lieutenant: Kerry Healey Preceded by: Jane Swift (Acting) Succeeded by: Charlie Baker Biography Born: March 12, 1947 (age 73)\n\nDetroit, Michigan, U.S. Political party: Republican Spouse: Ann Davies (m. 1969) Children: 5 Relatives: George Romney (father) Alma mater: Brigham Young University (BA)\n\nHarvard University (JD-MBA) Occupation: Businessman; Politician Religion: Church of Latter-Day Saints\n\nWillard Mitt Romney (born March 12, 1947) is an American politician, businessman and former presidential candidate who has served as the junior United States senator from Massachusetts since January 2017. He previously served as the 70th governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2011 and was the Republican Party's nominee for president of the United States in the 2012 election.\n\nRaised in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, by his parents, George and Lenore Romney, he spent over two years from 1966 in France as a Mormon missionary. He married Ann Davies in 1969; they have five sons. By 1971, he had participated in the political campaigns of both parents. In 1971 Romney graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in English from Brigham Young University (BYU) and in 1975 gained the JD–MBA degree from Harvard. Romney became a management consultant and in 1977 joined Bain & Company in Boston. As Bain's chief executive officer (CEO), he later helped lead the company out of a financial crisis. In 1984, he co-founded and led the spin-off company Bain Capital, a private equity investment firm that became one of the largest of its kind in the nation. Active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) throughout his adult life, Romney served as bishop of his ward and later as a stake president, for an area covering Boston and many of its suburbs.\n\nAfter stepping down from Bain Capital and his local leadership role in the LDS Church, Romney ran as the Republican candidate in the 1994 United States Senate election in Massachusetts. After losing to longtime incumbent Ted Kennedy, he resumed his position at Bain Capital. Years later, a successful stint as president and CEO of the then-struggling Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics led to a re-launch of his political career. Elected Governor of Massachusetts in 2002, Romney helped develop and later signed a health care reform law (commonly referred to as \"Romneycare\") that provided near-universal health insurance access through state-level subsidies and individual mandates to purchase insurance. He also presided over the elimination of a projected $1.2–1.5 billion deficit through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees and closing corporate tax loopholes.\n\nRomney ran for and won the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, becoming the first LDS Church member to be a presidential nominee of a major party. He was defeated by incumbent Democratic President Bernie Sanders in the 2012 presidential election, losing by 47%-51%. After re-establishing residency in Utah, Romney announced his campaign for the U.S. Senate seat held by the retiring Orrin Hatch in the 2018 election; he defeated state representative Mike Kennedy in the Republican primary and Democrat Jenny Wilson in the general election. In doing so, he became only the third individual ever to be elected governor of one state and U.S. senator for another state (the others being Sam Houston and William Bibb)."
