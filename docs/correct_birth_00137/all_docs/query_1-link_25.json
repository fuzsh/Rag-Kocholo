        "text": "A senator choosing to leave public life isn't Earth-shattering news in Washington, but Mitt Romney's decision to forgo reelection next year is already being cast as a pivotal moment for the country, Congress and the Republican Party ahead of 2024.\n\nIn a video posted online, the Utah Republican expressed a skepticism that either party's current political leaders − namely Democratic President Joe Biden and former Republican President Donald Trump − can address eminent problems such as U.S. debt, foreign affairs and climate change.\n\n\"Political motivations too often impede the solutions that these challenges demand,\" he said. \"The next generation of leaders must take America to the next stage of global leadership.\"\n\nOn the same day Romney announced he wouldn't run again, excerpts of a forthcoming biography were released by The Atlantic, which explains what drove him to leave politics\n\nOverall it paints a bleak portrait of the Senate, where Romney was considered a rational moderate by today's standards. But it also describes a disturbingly cynical direction of American politics in general from a conservative who was once the national standard bearer for the GOP.\n\nHere are key takeaways from that article, and the fallout from his decision.\n\nRepublican senators can't stand Donald Trump, but they won't say so publicly\n\nRomney isn't shy about his dislike of Trump and where he has taken the GOP. The senator is the only Republican who twice voted to convict the former president in his two impeachments by House Democrats.\n\nThe new biography, entitled \"Romney: A Reckoning,\" says many Senate Republicans also loathed the former president, but were too chicken to say anything publicly. A senior senator in the book said Trump, \"has none of the qualities you would want in a president, and all of the qualities you wouldn’t,\" according to Romney.\n\nRomney also details a conversation with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who referred to Trump as \"an idiot\" for criticizing GOP members ahead of the impeachment trial.\n\n\"You’re lucky,\" McConnell said, according to Romney. \"You can say the things that we all think. You’re in a position to say things about him that we all agree with but can’t say.\"\n\nA McConnell spokesperson told the biographer, McKay Coppins, the GOP leader didn't remember this conversation.\n\nJan. 6 changed the fear from political to physical violence\n\nIn the book, Romney talks about how Republican lawmakers' fear of Trump was largely an anxiety about a backlash at the ballot box by the former president's fervent base.\n\nBut that alarm escalated after the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, which spawned \"a new, more existential brand of cowardice\" among GOP lawmakers according to the biographer.\n\nMultiple Republican lawmakers confided to Romney, the book says, that they wanted to vote to impeach Trump the second time for his role in the attack, but was worried about violent reprisals against their family.\n\nTrump remains the unquestionable top dog for the 2024 presidential nomination despite being smacked with multiple criminal and civil charges.\n\nAt a Wednesday press conference in his office, Romney told reporters he does not envision the GOP will move on from Trump in the near future, but the party will see leadership changes \"over the next decade or so.\"\n\nMcConnell ghosts Romney\n\nAt several points in the book, Romney talks about conversations with McConnell, and he was often left guessing where the Kentucky Republican actually stood on Trump.\n\nSometimes it seemed that McConnell would do whatever the former president asked in the pursuit of a policy goal and provided political cover publicly, but in private conversations the GOP leader would rip Trump to shreds.\n\nLeading up to the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, Romney texted McConnell about he had been told by Sen. Angus King, of Vermont, about how a senior official at the Pentagon reported seeing, \"very disturbing social media traffic regarding the protests planned on the 6th. There are calls to burn down your home, Mitch; to smuggle guns into DC, and to storm the Capitol.\"\n\nRomney told McConnell he hoped there were \"sufficient security plans are in place,\" but that he was concerned given Trump, who was the instigator, is the \"one who commands the reinforcements\" needed to protect the building and lawmakers.\n\nMcConnell never texted back.\n\n'Stop the stupid': Living in the Senate's shrinking center\n\nRomney was once the GOP's face when he won the nomination and challenged then-President Barack Obama during the 2012 presidential race. He holds a solid conservative voting record, but his departure from the Senate is notable as one of the last moderate voices on the right in the upper chamber.\n\nWhoever takes his place in Utah, which could be former Rep. Jason Chaffetz; Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson; or Riverton, Utah Mayor Trent Saggs, will likely be more Trump and MAGA-friendly.\n\nWhat remains of the political center in the Senate, and its overall usefulness, has been a subject of conversation largely on the left around Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who have angered progressives by pumping the brakes on ambitious parts of Biden's agenda.\n\nIn the upcoming biography, Romney deals with accepting that the GOP he once represented in 2012 is mostly gone and the pitfalls of navigating America's political center.\n\nAt one point he approached Manchin about creating a new political party with a \"Stop the stupid\" slogan, according to the biographer. Instead of long-shot bid for president, which the West Virginia Democrat has flirted with publicly, he argued it would be a better idea to herd like-minded donors towards a third party that will pledge support to whoever aligned with their agenda the most.\n\nRomney alludes to how age will matter in 2024\n\nThe ages of U.S. leaders remains a rising concern for voters, who have expressed worry about the health of liberal and conservative lawmakers who are in their 80s and 90s.\n\nThat topic will come into focus more as we get close to next year's presidential contest, given the Democratic and Republican frontrunners are the oldest candidates running in the 2024 race.\n\nThirty-seven percent of Democratic and independent voters said Biden being 80 years old makes them less likely to vote for him, according to a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll. Trump is right behind him at age 77.\n\nIn the upcoming biography, Romney jokes about how the Senate is a \"club for old men\" where many of the elder members need the job for stimulation to stay alive, in his view. He noted that if he ran for reelection next year he would be in his mid-80s during his second term, and that a new generation of leaders should take over.\n\n\"They are the ones who need to make the decisions that will shape the world they will be living in,\" Romney, who is 76, said during his announcement video."
