        "text": "Opinion: This Is What A Mandate Looks Like\n\nAfter two years and more than two billion dollars spent, President Obama was returned to Washington with a clear mandate on the economy and the direction of the country.\n\nSnyder Says Prop 1 Defeat Means 'Best Tool' To Help Cities Is Gone\n\n\"As a practical matter it does make it more difficult for the eight communities that are in emergency, we were on a very positive path, hopefully to start transitioning (them out of it.)\"\n\n2012 Presidential Election Projected To Be The Closest In 76 Years\n\nIt's finally here! We can finally cast our votes for who we would like to lead us as a nation for the next four years.\n\nMichigan Voters Line Up Outside Despite Cold Weather\n\nMichigan voters lined up early Tuesday at precincts around the state, bundled against temperatures in the 20s and 30s, to cast ballots in a host of local, state and national races.\n\nOpinion: Obama's Biggest Failure Has Been On Race Relations\n\nUnfortunately, political poll after political poll reveals that the presidential election of 2012 has much to do â€“ in fact, more to do â€“ with the race of the presidential candidate than most anything else.\n\nGOP Bus Tour Making Final Swing Through Michigan\n\nThe bus takes off after a morning rally in Saint Clair Shores, and will make a half dozen stops before arriving in Jackson, the birthplace of the GOP.\n\nOpinion: On Election Eve Major Concerns About Disenfranchisement\n\nFrom Florida and Ohio early vote disasters with long lines to power outages in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York there are doubts that some people will have the opportunity to participate in this election.\n\nOpinion: Romney's Desperation Showing In Final Days Of Campaign\n\nAs the campaign draws to a close it has become very apparent that Obama will return to the White House and that Harry Reid will lead a Democratic Senate.\n\nOpinion: Obamacare Should Win It For Mitt Romney\n\nIf you're still looking for a reason to decide on which candidate to vote for, think about Obamacare and the fact that one report after another clearly shows that it's going to cost the nation much, much more than originally stated by President Obama and his administration.\n\nOpinion: A Few Brave Newspapers Endorse Romney Fighting Tide Of Liberal Press\n\nThe newspapers that are not endorsing President Barack Obama are extremely brave. They are to be positively recognized for their courage to stand up against the onslaught of the liberal media which refuses to speak in the best interest of the country as the presidential election nears.\n\nOpinion: Obama And Christie Do The Right Thing Working Together As The Right Continues Attacks\n\nGovernor Christie went out of his way to praise the work that the President and his administration are doing, something that he got a lot of credit for...outside of the right-wing blogosphere.\n\nOpinion: Selectively Presidential: Obama Chooses To Be Presidential When It's Convenient\n\nWhen the storm and its headlines have passed, however, the questions about the Benghazi tragedy should continue full force as November 6 continues to near.

Romney replied that FEMA should \"absolutely\" be shut down. He was asked specifically if that included disaster relief. He replied that it was \"immoral\" to provide such relief in the face of \"larger debts\", emphasizing that \"it makes no sense at all\" to have such programs.\n\nOpinion: Benghazi-Gate: Obama's Unconscionable Actions\n\nBy now it's obvious that Obama and his administration did not handle the situation correctly. Rather than taking a presidential stance during the horrendous incident, Obama kept his mind and actions on his 2012 reelection campaign and tried to alter the obvious reasons for the deadly attack.\n\nOpinion: Auto Manufacturing Is Back In America. Obama Was Right, Romney Was Wrong.\n\nAuto manufacturing is back in America â€“ especially in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania because President Obama made the politically risky decision to bailout the auto industry after bailing out the banks. It was a decision that worked. Obama was right, Romney was wrong. So Romney is now in full lying mode. He is trying to retroactively re-write the wrongs in his writings.\n\nOpinion: The Auto Bailout Wasn't A Safe Financial Deal For America\n\nYes, it's great that all turned out well for the auto workers, but it is absolutely horrendous to know that the American taxpayers via President Obama's actions could have been left standing for billions of dollars â€“ and still might.\n\nDetroiters react to Biden dropping out of 2024 presidential race\n\nMany Detroit voters CBS News Detroit spoke with Sunday said they support President Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nMelvindale police officer fatally shot; authorities searching for suspect\n\nThe officer was shot in the 17000 block of Clarann Street in Melvindale while responding to a situation.\n\nKamala Harris says she intends to \"earn and win\" Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said in a statement that it is her \"intention is to earn and win\" the Democratic presidential nomination."
