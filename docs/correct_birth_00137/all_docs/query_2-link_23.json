He served one term and did not seek re-election in 2006; his term ended January 4, 2007.[1] Romney is a probable candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, and created a Presidential Campaign Exploratory Committee on January 3, 2007.[2]\n\nRomney is the former CEO of Bain & Company, a management consulting firm, and the co-founder of Bain Capital, a private equity investment firm. In 1994, Romney led an unsuccessful Senate campaign against Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy. He also served as the CEO and organizer of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nBiography[]\n\nMitt Romney was born March 12, 1947 in Detroit, Michigan. He is the son of Lenore Romney and former Michigan governor, Housing and Urban Development Secretary, American Motors chairman and presidential candidate George W. Romney. Romney has three siblings: Lynn, Jane, and G. Scott. He was named after hotel magnate J. Willard Marriott and Milton Romney, a relative who played football for the Chicago Bears.[3]\n\nRomney married his wife, Ann Romney, in 1969. They have five sons (Tagg, Matt, Josh, Ben and Craig) and ten grandchildren. Ann Romney was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1998.[4]\n\nEarly life and education[]\n\nRomney graduated from the Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills (now Cranbrook Kingswood School). He met his future wife, Ann Davies, when she was at the Kingswood School.\n\nAfter attending Stanford University for two quarters, Romney served for 30 months as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in France.[5] Upon returning from France he transferred to Brigham Young University, where he was valedictorian, earning his B.A. summa cum laude in 1971. In 1975, Romney graduated from a joint JD/MBA program coordinated between Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School, where he was named a Baker Scholar. He graduated cum laude from the law school and in the top 5 percent of his business school class.[6]\n\nBusiness career[]\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Business School, Romney went to work for the Boston Consulting Group, where he had interned during the summer of 1974.[7] From 1978 to 1984, Romney was a vice president of Bain & Company, Inc., a Boston-based management consulting firm. In 1984, Romney left the company to co-found Bain Capital, which quickly became a highly successful private equity investment firm.[8]\n\nIn 1990 Romney was asked to return to Bain & Company, which was facing financial collapse. As CEO, Romney managed an effort to restructure the firm's employee stock-ownership plan, real-estate deals and bank loans, while increasing fiscal transparency. Within a year, he had led Bain & Company through a highly successful turnaround and returned the firm to profitability without layoffs or partner defections.[9]\n\nFollowing his year at Bain & Company, Romney returned to Bain Capital. During the 14 years he headed the company, Bain Capital's average annual internal rate of return on realized investments was 113 percent.[9] During Romney's tenure, the firm founded, acquired or invested in hundreds of companies including Staples Inc., Bright Horizons Family Solutions, Brookstone, Domino's, Sealy Corporation and The Sports Authority. [1] Romney left Bain Capital in 1998 to head the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games Organizing Committee.\n\nCEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee[]\n\nRomney served as president and CEO of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games held in Salt Lake City. In 1999 the event was running $379 million short of its revenue benchmarks. Plans were being made to scale back the games in order to compensate for the fiscal crisis. The Games were also damaged by allegations of bribery involving top officials, including then Salt Lake Olympic Committee (SLOC) President and CEO Frank Joklik. Joklik and SLOC vice president Dave Johnson were forced to resign.[10]\n\nOn February 11, 1999 Romney was hired as the new president and CEO of the Salt Lake City Games.[11] Romney revamped the organization's leadership and policies, reduced budgets and boosted fundraising. He also worked to ensure the safety of the Games following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 by coordinating a $300 million security budget.[12] Despite the initial fiscal shortfall, the Games ended up clearing a profit of $100 million. Following the conclusion of the Games, President George W. Bush praised Romney's management.[13]\n\nRomney contributed $1 million to the Olympics, and donated the $825,000 salary he earned as President and CEO to charity.[14] He wrote a book about his experience called Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership and the Olympic Games. (ISBN:0895260840)\n\nMassachusetts political campaigns[]\n\nCampaign for United States Senate, 1994 election[]\n\nIn 1994, Romney won the Massachusetts Republican Party's nomination for U.S. Senate after defeating businessman John Lakian in the primary.[15] Some polls showed Romney only slightly behind Senator Ted Kennedy. One Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll taken after the September 20, 1994 primary showed Romney ahead 44 percent to 42 percent, within the poll's sampling margin of error.[16] According to figures in the 1996 Almanac of American Politics, which relies on official campaign finance reports, Romney spent over $7 million, with Kennedy spending over $10 million, mostly in the last weeks of the campaign. (This was the second-most expensive race of the 1994 election cycle, after the Dianne Feinstein vs. Michael Huffington Senate race in California.)Template:Citation needed Kennedy won the election with 58 percent of the vote to Romney's 41 percent. The 17-percentage point winning margin was the smallest in Kennedy's nine election contests for the Senate through 2006.[17]\n\nCampaign for Governor, 2002 election[]\n\nMain Article: Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2002\n\nIn 2002, Republican Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift was expected to campaign for the governor's office. Swift had served as acting governor after Republican Governor Paul Cellucci resigned upon being appointed U.S. Ambassador to Canada. Swift was viewed as an unpopular executive, and her administration was plagued by political missteps and personal scandals.[18] Many Republicans viewed her as a liability and considered her unable to win a general election against a Democrat.[19] Prominent GOP activists campaigned to persuade Romney to run for governor.[20] One poll taken at this time showed that Republicans favored Romney over Swift by more than 50 percentage points.[21] With growing speculation that Romney would challenge Swift in a bruising primary battle, Swift decided not to seek her party's nomination.\n\nMassachusetts Democratic Party officials claimed that Romney was ineligible to run for governor, citing residency issues. The Massachusetts Constitution requires seven consecutive years of residency prior to a run for office. Romney claimed residency in Utah from 1999 to 2002, during his time as president of the Salt Lake City Olympic Committee. In 1999 he listed himself as a part-time Massachusetts resident.[22] The Massachusetts Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission, which eventually ruled that Romney was eligible to run for office. The ruling was not challenged in court.[23]\n\nDuring the general election Romney ran on a reform platform; a major issue in the election was the state budget crisis. Supporters of Romney hailed his business record, especially his success with the 2002 Olympics, as that of one who would be able to bring in a new era of efficiency into Massachusetts politics.[24] Romney contributed $6.3 million to his own campaign during the election, at the time a state record.[25] Romney was elected Governor in November 2002 with 50 percent of the vote over Democratic candidate Shannon O'Brien, who received 45 percent.[26]\n\nGovernor of Massachusetts, 2003-2007[]\n\nMain Article: Governorship of Mitt Romney\n\nRomney served one term as governor. He was sworn in as the 70th governor of Massachusetts on January 2, 2003, along with Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey. On December 14, 2005, Romney announced that he would not seek re-election for a second term as governor, fueling speculation about a run for the White House in 2008.[27] Healey became the Republican nominee for the 2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial race and subsequently lost to Democrat Deval Patrick. Romney's term ended January 4, 2007. Romney filed papers to establish a formal exploratory presidential campaign committee the next to last day in office as governor.[28]\n\nCampaign for United States President, 2008 election[]\n\nMain Article: Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008\n\nSince 2004, Romney has been discussed as a potential 2008 presidential candidate.[29] On January 3, 2007, his next to last day in office as governor of Massachusetts, Romney filed to form a presidential exploratory committee with the Federal Election Commission.[2][30]\n\nElectoral history[]\n\n2002 Race for Governor, Massachusetts\n\nMitt Romney (R), 50%\n\nShannon O'Brien (D), 45%\n\nJill Stein (J), 3%\n\nCarla Howell (L), 1.%\n\nBarbara Johnson (U), 1%\n\n1994 Race for U.S. Senate, Massachusetts\n\nEdward Kennedy (D) (incumbent), 58%\n\nMitt Romney (R), 41%\n\nLauraleigh Dozier (L), 0.7%\n\nWilliam Ferguson, 0.2%\n\nNotes[]\n\n[]\n\nTemplate:Sisterlinks\n\nOfficial\n\nMitt Romney Presidential Exploratory Committee Website\n\nMitt Romney's Commonwealth PAC\n\nMassachusetts Press Releases\n\nOfficial Massachusetts Governor Biography\n\nSpeeches: Multimedia and transcripts\n\nC-Span Archives--Speeches in S.C., N.H., & Mich (RealPlayer required)\n\nInterview with C-Span Q&A Program (click \"watch\" on upper right of page)\n\nMIT Keynote Address\n\nHealthcare Reform Speech at the Heritage Foundation (click \"view event\" at top)\n\nGovernor Romney Speaks To Spartanburg SC Event Sound Quality is not the greatest, adjust your volume.\n\nText of Governor Mitt Romney Speeches\n\nInterviews\n\nCharlie Rose Interview Guest Host Judy Woodruff\n\nMarch 19, 2006 Edition of C-Span's Q&A Click under Program Details for the Video and the Transcript\n\nMitt Romney Discusses Iraq War, Reagan's Influence and Gay Marriage by Robert Bluey\n\nArticles about Mitt Romney\n\nWikia\n\nRomney Rides High The Wall Street Journal, September 25 2006\n\nMitt Romney's Problem The Economist, September 28 2006\n\nMighty Mitt Romney The American Spectator, March 2006\n\nYepsen: So far, Romney's been most impressive Republican Des Moines Register July 11 2006\n\nPolitical positions of Mitt Romney\n\nIs America ready for a Mormon president?
