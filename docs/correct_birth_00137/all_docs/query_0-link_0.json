He was the Republican Party’s presidential nominee in 2012.\n\nEarly life and business career\n\nThe youngest of four siblings, Romney was born into one of the most prominent families within the Mormon faith. His father, George Romney, was a successful business executive who managed American Motors from near bankruptcy to record profits and who later served as governor of Michigan (1963–69) and as secretary of housing and urban development (1969–72) in the cabinet of U.S. President Richard M. Nixon. The younger Romney attended Stanford University in California, but he interrupted his studies in 1966 to undertake a 30-month missionary campaign for the Mormon church in France. While there he was seriously injured in a car accident, and he returned to the United States a few months later. Romney graduated summa cum laude from Brigham Young University with a B.A. degree in English in 1971. He earned J.D. and M.B.A. degrees from Harvard University in 1975.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\n12 Quotes from U.S. Presidential Debates: A Quiz\n\nRomney then moved into the private sector as an investment consultant. He spent most of the next 20 years with the Boston-based consulting firm Bain & Company and its investment-focused spin-off, Bain Capital, which he cofounded in 1984 with Coleman Andrews and Eric Kriss. During his time at Bain, Romney acquired a multimillion-dollar fortune.\n\nGovernor of Massachusetts\n\nRomney made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in 1994 against Democratic incumbent Ted Kennedy. His successful turnaround of the scandal-plagued 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, chronicled by Romney in Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership, and the Olympic Games (2004), served as a springboard for his successful Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign in 2002.\n\nAfter taking office in 2003, Romney addressed the state’s budget problems, implemented universal health care for the uninsured, and created a scholarship program for lower- and middle-income students to attend Massachusetts universities. Romney sometimes took centrist positions early in his political career (e.g., during his 1994 campaign against Kennedy, he argued that homosexuals needed “more support from the Republican Party” and that “abortion should be safe and legal”), but later in his career he fashioned himself as a fiscal and social conservative, maintaining that his views on such issues had evolved. Romney was opposed to gay marriage, and, after the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in November 2003 that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples was unconstitutional, he tried unsuccessfully to have the issue placed on the ballot. He did not seek a second term as governor, and he left office in 2007.\n\nPresidential runs in 2008 and 2012\n\nRomney turned next to pursuing the Republican nomination for president in 2008. His campaign platform stressed his achievements as governor, as well as his business background, and suggested that his successes as governor could be repeated at the federal level. His campaign received a boost in August 2007 when he finished in first place in the Iowa straw poll. In January 2008, however, Romney placed a disappointing second in both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, losing to Mike Huckabee and John McCain, respectively. He won the relatively uncontested Wyoming caucuses and emerged from Super Tuesday (February 5, 2008) in second place, behind front-runner McCain. Acknowledging the gap that existed between the number of delegates that each candidate could claim, Romney suspended his campaign several days later.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In June 2011 he announced his decision to make a second run for the presidency. Romney began the campaign as the perceived front-runner for the Republican nomination. During the ensuing months, however, he struggled to draw support from social conservatives, who still viewed him as a moderate, and he placed second behind more-conservative candidates in important primaries, including Ohio’s. Nevertheless, he was able to rally most of the Republican Party around his candidacy and earned enough delegates after the Texas primary in May 2012 to secure the presidential nomination. In August Romney chose U.S. Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nHaving emphasized his conservative credentials in the primaries (he called himself “severely conservative”), Romney adopted a more-centrist position during the presidential campaign itself. Throughout the race, Romney sought to convince undecided voters that he could provide what the Democratic incumbent, President Barack Obama, had so far failed to deliver: a full recovery from the Great Recession of 2007–09. He vowed to repeal Obama’s health care reform law, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), calling it “job killer,” and to create 12 million new jobs in his first term by adopting business-friendly policies. Romney presented his own experience as a successful governor and businessman as evidence of his capacity to lead the country on the road to economic recovery and growth. Despite a strong campaign, Romney’s bid for the presidency was unsuccessful, and Obama was reelected.\n\nLater activities and U.S Senate\n\nAlthough there was speculation that Romney would stage a third presidential run, in 2015 he publicly stated that he was not entering the 2016 race. However, he was a notable presence during the campaign, becoming a vocal critic of Donald Trump, the eventual Republican nominee and winner. In February 2018 Romney announced that he was running for the U.S. Senate seat in Utah that was being vacated by the retiring Orrin Hatch. Despite their differences, Romney quickly received the endorsement of Trump. Although widely seen as the favourite candidate, Romney failed to secure his party’s nomination in a vote during the Utah Republican convention in April, necessitating a primary election. However, he easily won that contest two months later, and in November 2018 he was elected to the Senate. Shortly before taking office in January 2019, Romney wrote an op-ed in which he was harshly critical of Trump, alleging that the president “has not risen to the mantle of the office.” Later that year the House of Representatives impeached Trump over his actions involving Ukraine, charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in early 2020 the Senate held a trial. Trump was easily acquitted, but Romney made history by voting to convict Trump of abusing his power, thereby becoming the only U.S. senator to vote for the removal of a president from his own party. However, he acquitted Trump on the charge of obstructing Congress.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, Trump was defeated by Joe Biden, who had served as Obama’s vice president. Trump and various Republicans, however, challenged the results, alleging widespread voter fraud despite a lack of evidence. Romney condemned those claims as “reckless.” On January 6, 2021, he and other members of Congress met to certify Biden’s win, but the proceedings were temporarily halted when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. When Congress reconvened hours later, Romney gave a speech in which he accused Trump of inciting the deadly siege. On January 13, one week before the end of Trump’s presidency, the House of Representatives impeached Trump for “incitement of insurrection.” At the Senate trial the following month, Romney and six other Republicans joined with Democrats to vote for Trump’s conviction; the former president, however, was acquitted.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
