        "text": "Like a lot of people around here, I thought I knew a little something about presumed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Born in Detroit. Raised in the 'burbs. First name Willard. Right?\n\nWell, maybe not. These days, perhaps we should wonder: Is Mitt Romney really who he says he is?\n\nAnd if he is, then why won't he produce\n\n, hmm?\n\nRomney, who's the presumptive GOP presidential front-runner, has gone so far as to make jokes about it, appearing on David Letterman's show to crack, \"I have absolutely no idea where my birth certificate is.\" (Cue laugh track)\n\nWait, it's funny now? Where are the cries of outrage? Where are the breathless \"news\" reports, the wild-eyed suspicions, the debates over \"short form vs. long form,\" the unending parade of conspiracy theorists shuttling in and out of FOX studios questioning Romney's identity?\n\nWhy is Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey protecting Romney, what is he hiding?\n\nHow is it that Romney, whose own father was\n\n, has managed to escape criticism as some fifth columnist foreign national anti-colonialist anchor baby intent on subverting the Constitution and undermining the nation?\n\nSimple: Romney is a white man. And at its very root, the \"birther\" movement is a racist one.\n\nAnd so, Romney gets to address the \"birther\" position for the foolishness that it is, while\n\ncontinue to fan outright lies about the citizenship of the President of the United States.\n\nIt doesn't matter that Barack Obama has produced his birth certificate and that it's been verified by independent fact checkers. He's black. And so, even his very claim to citizenship is treated as if it's suspect, gets turned into the point of some phony controversy by people whose sole aim to continue to cast him as an \"other.\"\n\nAnd please don't start with the pointless red-herring counterarguments that \"it's not racist to criticize President Obama.\" Of course it's not.\n\nBut \"birther\" bile isn't about policy differences between conservatives and liberals or liberals and progressives. It's about continuing racist efforts to erode Obama's support by constantly trying to convince some voters that \"he's not one of us.\" (And it's about rival politicians who do indeed know better\n\n.)\n\nYes, he was born in Hawaii. Yes, his mother was white and from Kansas. But what does any of that mean when her black son now has his finger on the Button and Republicans across the land are fomenting fear? All that matters to these people is, \"I want my country back\"—as if it's \"theirs\" alone and as if it's gone anywhere—and so birthers and other bigots throw against the wall\n\n, praying that something,\n\n, sticks.\n\nMeanwhile, Romney openly jokes about not having a birth certificate to give reporters and nary a peep is raised.\n\nAnd really, why bother, right? To the racist knuckle-draggers who make up the birther movement, there's no question that Romney is an American. All they have to do is look at him."
