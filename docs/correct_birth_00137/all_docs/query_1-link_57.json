        "text": "US senator Mitt Romney has capped his roller-coaster political career by announcing his retirement, but not before trading one last barb at 2024 presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden.\n\nThe one-term senator said on Thursday he would not seek re-election in 2024.\n\nDuring his video statement, Mr Romney said age played into the decision, making a thinly veiled jibe to an ageing White House.\n\n\"At the end of another term I'd be in my mid-80s,\" he said.\n\n\"Frankly it's time for a new generation of leaders.\"\n\nMr Biden is currently 80, and Mr Trump is 77.\n\nThe 76-year-old senator also took the time to criticise his own Republican party in a subsequent interview with the Washington Post.\n\n“It’s pretty clear that the party is inclined to a populist demagogue message,” he said.\n\nFrom his highs and lows, let's take a look at the Utah senator's rise to fame.\n\nThe millionaire son of an ex-governor\n\nThe son of a former Michigan governor and 1968 Republican presidential candidate, Mr Romney was born into political aspirations.\n\nBut before he became a Massachusetts governor and prior to running for president in 2008, Mr Romney was a multimillionaire in the private equity business.\n\nThroughout his political career, his connections to firm Bain Capital would plague him.\n\nIn the 2012 election campaign, doubts were made about the length of Mr Romney's tenure at Bain Capital.\n\nMr Romney asserted he left in 1999 to be a part of the organising committee of the Salt Lake City Olympics, whereas The Boston Globe said his name appeared on Bain Capital documents until 2002.\n\nThe three-year discrepancy became an electoral talking point in light of the company's controversial decisions during that time, including the firing of employees.\n\nHis wealthy businessman image also hurt the perception Mr Romney could relate to average Americans.\n\nThis image was cemented when he was secretly recorded at a fundraiser, saying he didn't worry about winning the votes of \"47 per cent of Americans\" who \"believe they are victims\" and \"pay no income tax\".\n\nHe moved to Utah after his defeat in the 2012 presidency against Democrat Barack Obama.\n\nTwo-decade political career\n\nMr Romney became a household Republican name in the 2012 election.\n\nHe rose in popularity with Republicans through his criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the economy.\n\nDespite losing to Mr Obama, the second-time presidential defeat wasn't enough to deter Mr Romney from politics forever.\n\nHe reappeared in the 2014 US midterm elections, endorsing multiple US Senate Republican candidates.\n\nWhile Mr Romney appeared to have some renewed popularity in the lead-up to the 2016 election, he decided not to run and expressed clear disdain for all nominees.\n\nHe later revealed he voted for his wife Ann.\n\nAfter that, his attention turned to the vacated Utah Senate seat in 2018.\n\nMr Romney successfully won his bid, beating Democratic nominee Jenny Wilson with 62.6 per cent of the vote.\n\nThroughout his Senate career, Mr Romney said his role in negotiating bipartisan gun safety legislation and emergency COVID-19 relief funding were some of the highlights.\n\nStaunch opponent of Mr Trump\n\nPerhaps what Mr Romney will be most remembered for is being a rare Republican critic of Mr Trump.\n\nMr Romney was the only Republican senator to vote to convict Mr Trump at both of his Senate impeachment trials.\n\nHe was the first senator in history to vote to convict a president from their own party in the first impeachment trial, and was the only Republican to vote against Mr Trump.\n\nMr Trump was later acquitted by the Senate both times.\n\nIn 2016, he delivered a scathing speech in Utah denouncing Mr Trump as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud\" who was unfit for the White House.\n\nMr Romney accepted Mr Trump's endorsement for his 2018 Senate run but also pledged in an op-ed that year that he would \"continue to speak out when the president says or does something which is divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions\".\n\nMr Romney has narrowly avoided censure by the Utah Republican Party over his opposition to Mr Trump.\n\nBut his views saw him increasingly labelled an outsider in the party.\n\nIn 2021, was booed and heckled onstage at a state party convention.\n\n\"I understand that I have a few folks that don't like me terribly much, and I'm sorry about that,\" he told the crowd.\n\n\"But I express my mind as I believe is right and I follow my conscience as I believe is right.\"\n\nDuring an interview after his retirement, Mr Romney continued to show his contempt for Mr Trump.\n\n\"My wing of the party talks about policy and about issues that will make a difference in the lives of the American people,\" he said.\n\n\"The Trump wing of the party talks about resentments of various kinds and getting even and settling scores and revisiting the 2020 election.\"\n\nMr Trump has called the senator's retirement \"fantastic news for America, the great state of Utah and the Republican party\" on social media platform Truth Social.\n\nWhat's next for Mr Romney?\n\nMr Romney said his post-Senate life would focus on bringing young people into politics.\n\n\"My party is only going to be successful getting young people to vote for us if we're talking about the future,\" he said.\n\nHe said he wished both Mr Biden and Mr Trump would step back from their presidential campaigns and let younger candidates run.\n\nIn an April Reuters/Ipsos poll, 61 per cent of registered Democrats thought Mr Biden was too old to run for re-election.\n\nMeanwhile, 35 per cent of registered Republicans thought the same about Mr Trump.\n\n\"The times we're living in re-demand the next generation step up and express their point of view and to make the decisions that will shape American politics over the coming century,\" Mr Romney said.\n\nMr Romney's biography Romney: A Reckoning is also set to come out in October.\n\nHe is the sixth incumbent senator to announce plans to retire after the end of the term in 2025."
