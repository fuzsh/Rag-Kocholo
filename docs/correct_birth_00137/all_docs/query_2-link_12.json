        "text": "Mitt Romney, (born March 12, 1947, Detroit, Mich., U.S.), U.S. businessman and politician. He was born into one of the most prominent families within the Mormon faith. After graduating from Brigham Young University (B.A., 1971), he earned a master’s degree and a law degree from Harvard University (1975). He spent most of the next 20 years with the Boston-based consulting firm Bain & Company and with its investment-focused spin-off, Bain Capital. After his successful turnaround of the scandal-plagued 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Romney, a Republican, was elected governor of Massachusetts. After serving one term (2003–07), he unsuccessfully ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. Four years later Romney won the party’s nomination, but he was defeated in the election by Pres. Barack Obama. Romney later represented Utah in the U.S. Senate (2019– )."
