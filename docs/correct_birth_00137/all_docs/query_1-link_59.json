        "text": "Chris Christie (born September 6, 1962, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the governor of New Jersey (2010–18) and gained national prominence as a moderate voice in the Republican Party. He unsuccessfully ran for president in 2016 and again in 2024.\n\nThe son of a Korean War veteran, Christie majored in political science at the University of Delaware and graduated in 1984. He then embarked on the study of law and received a J.D. degree from Seton Hall University in 1987. Christie practiced law for more than a decade (1987–2001) at Dughi, Hewit and Palatucci (later Dughi, Hewit & Domalewski, P.C.) in Cranford, New Jersey, becoming a partner in 1993. During his time at that firm, Christie became involved in managing and fundraising for the campaigns of Republican candidates, most notably the 1992 reelection campaign of U.S. Pres. George H.W. Bush and in 1999 the successful first presidential campaign of his son George W. Bush. In 2001 the latter Bush appointed Christie U.S. attorney for the district of New Jersey. Christie received bipartisan accolades for clamping down on corruption during his nearly seven years in the position, prosecuting more than 130 public officials without losing a case.\n\nIn 2009 Christie campaigned as the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, and in November he defeated the Democratic incumbent, Jon S. Corzine, by a comfortable margin. Although a Republican candidate in a staunchly Democratic state, Christie connected with a wide spectrum of voters, in part because he projected the image of a regular middle-class man who could be seen as more approachable than Corzine, a multimillionaire and former Goldman Sachs CEO.\n\nAfter taking office in January 2010, Christie showed that he preferred pragmatism over ideological purity. That enabled him to appeal beyond the partisan base of the Republican Party, and he was soon considered by many to be a strong potential candidate for the 2012 and 2016 U.S. presidential elections. However, despite significant support among Republicans and positive polls, Christie decided not to run in the 2012 Republican primaries.\n\nChristie was widely praised for his leadership during and after Superstorm Sandy, which devastated parts of New Jersey in October 2012. Christie was also popular with conservatives for cutting governmental expenditures and fighting labour unions during efforts to reform pension plans in New Jersey. Christie endorsed Republican candidate Mitt Romney in the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign, but some of Romney’s supporters accused Christie of having torpedoed his campaign by praising Romney’s opponent, Pres. Barack Obama, during relief efforts following Superstorm Sandy. Yet Christie’s image as a uniting figure capable of transcending partisanship in times of crisis made him even more popular in New Jersey. In November 2013 he was reelected as governor, easily defeating his Democratic challenger, Barbara Buono.\n\nIn 2014 Christie became embroiled in controversy when communications between two of his aides surfaced indicating that they had participated in a scheme to close two of the three local lanes of traffic between the town of Fort Lee, New Jersey, and the George Washington Bridge, which connects New Jersey to New York City. The scheme caused major traffic problems and had been designed to punish the mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich, for not endorsing Christie’s reelection campaign. In the ensuing scandal, widely known as Bridgegate, Christie denied any involvement in or knowledge of the scheme, and he dismissed the two aides. In 2015 a former official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) pled guilty to conspiracy and other charges. A former Christie aide and a former executive at the PANYNJ, who had been appointed by the governor, were convicted of fraud in 2016 and sentenced to prison for their participation in the lane closings. However, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the convictions in 2020, ruling that the defendants’ actions did not meet the standard for fraud.\n\nIn June 2015 Christie announced that he was entering the U.S. presidential election race of 2016. However, in the crowded Republican field, he struggled to gain support. After poor showings in both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, Christie suspended his campaign in February 2016. He subsequently became a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, the eventual Republican nominee and winner of the presidential election. In 2017 Trump appointed Christie to serve as chair of the newly created President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. Christie continued to serve as governor until his second term ended in 2018; because of term limits, he was unable to run for reelection in 2017.\n\nIn the memoir Let Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey, and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics (2019), Christie focused on his role within Trump’s campaign and transition team. In addition to criticizing key advisers, Christie claimed that he had been considered for a number of government posts, including the vice presidency, though Mike Pence was ultimately selected as Trump’s running mate. In October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Christie announced that he had tested positive for the disease. He was hospitalized and recovered. In the 2020 presidential election, Christie supported Trump, but he distanced himself from the president after Trump, alleging voter fraud, refused to concede the election to Joe Biden. Christie was one of the few Republicans who were publicly critical of Trump’s unsubstantiated claims. In addition, after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Christie blamed the attack on Trump. Later that year Christie published Republican Rescue: Saving the Party from Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden.\n\nIn June 2023, more than seven years after he ended his first presidential bid, Christie announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican nomination. The former Trump acolyte emerged from the crowded Republican field as the candidate most likely to take on the former president, saying at his kickoff rally:\n\nDonald Trump made us smaller by dividing us even further and pitting one group against another."
