        "text": "\"[The house] has been bulldozed now, because it turned, I guess, into an eyesore or a place that drugs were being used. So they had to tear it down. It was a lovely home,\" he said, adding, \"How sad it is to see the city of Detroit suffering as it is now.\"\n\nBut on a Sunday night drive through the tony neighborhood, the large, well-kept homes — which are guarded by a private security guard who patrols the area — hardly looked at risk of descending into drug dens. Instead, what was most striking was the community's apparent indifference toward its ties to the Romney clan.\n\n\"It's sort of a historical accident,\" said Joel Pitcoff, who lives around the corner from Romney's old house. \"No one's ever said, 'Make sure while you're here that you drive by the house that George Romney used to live in.'\"\n\nThe subject did come up a few years ago when residents were trying to figure out what to do with the increasingly dumpy house. One neighbor said there was \"cocktail party speculation\" that Romney himself should buy and restore it \"as a statement on the importance of maintaining the viability of our cities.\" But no one ever reached out to him—and besides, said the neighbor, \"I don't think he had any real attachment to that house.\"\n\nMany local residents don’t even know that a leading presidential candidate was born here, said Pitcoff, who has been active in the homeowners association. He chalked up the lack of awareness to the fact that Michigan's supposed \"native son\" hasn't lived here in more than four decades.\n\n\"It's not really his home state,\" said Pitcoff. \"I mean he's got homes in so many states. He never worked here. He never went to college here.\" He added: \"George Romney was well-liked when he was governor, but... that was a long time ago.\"\n\nEven if Romney's birthplace was a source of pride to the community, Pitcoff said it's unlikely most of his neighbors would pull the lever for him.\n\n\"You drive through here at election time, you won't see two lawn signs for a Republican candidate,\" said Pitcoff. \"It's all Democrats.\"\n\nFor his part, Pitcoff, a moderate conservative, said he plans to vote for Romney on Tuesday \"just to vote against the other guys.\" But he's perfectly clear that the former Michigander isn't his first choice. Who would he like to see run?\n\n\"Joe Scarborough.\"\n\nOf course, there are plenty of Michiganders excited to see a Romney boy on the ticket — especially the local Mormons who knew George Romney not just as a governor, but as a religious leader.\n\nSister Jackson, a Michigan native who joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day in the late 1950s when the elder Romney was the church’s Stake President, spoke of him with a mix of familiarity and boredom, as though the Romneys were a subject that had gone stale.\n\nWhat was President Romney like?\n\n“Oh, he was a Stake President,” she responded impassively, before changing the subject.\n\nIt was a Sunday afternoon, and Jackson, who declined to give her first name, was standing outside the Romneys’ old Mormon chapel in Bloomfield Hills, an eccentric structure now sandwiched between an LDS temple on one side, and a Masonic temple on the other.\n\nJackson remembered watching Mitt grow up, and said he was always devoted to his father’s political career.\n\n“My husband was union at Chrysler, and so Mitt made him wear a button that said, ‘Union for George Romney,” she recalled, the memory prompting long, gasping laughs.\n\n“But really, we weren’t allowed to talk politics at church back then,” she said. “We still don’t talk politics that much.”\n\nThen she got a mischievous smile, and asked, “Want to see some history?”\n\nShe pulled out of her pocket a small, vintage George Romney campaign button, and held it out proudly.\n\nThe story was the same outside Cranbrook, the elite prep school in Bloomfield Hills that Romney started attending in seventh grade. Visitors are mostly kept off campus on weekdays, when students with prestigious last names scurry from one ivy-covered, red brick building to another. But the gates are opened on weekends, allowing joggers to take advantage of the paved paths and picturesque scenery.\n\nIt was here, more than 40 years ago, that Romney began dating his wife, Ann, who attended Kingswood, Cranbrook's all-girls sister school.\n\nLocals say the Romneys are sometimes mentioned in relation to the schools, but they're not the only famous alumni: they're joined by actress Selma Blair, former Senator Alan Simpson, and political commentator Michael Kinsley, among others.\n\nAnd while Romney's connection is surely known by most students and faculty at his alma matter — the politician gave a speech there in 2005, and accepted a distinguished alumni award — not everyone on campus is aware.\n\nOn Sunday, a young security guard struggled to recall if Romney was among the school's high-profile alumni—or even who Romney was.\n\n\"I think he went here, maybe?\" he said. \"I mean, don't quote me on that. I'm not sure. I really don't know.\"\n\nAsked whether he was a Cranbrook graduate, he guffawed: \"I don't have that kind of money.\"\n\nAccording to the school's website, tuition for a boarding student without a scholarship costs nearly $39,000 per year — \"more,\" the security guard noted, \"than most colleges.\"\n\nAs he’s campaigned throughout the state, Romney has spoken nostalgically—and convincingly—about Michigan’s former greatness.\n\n“When I grew up in Michigan, it was exciting to be here” he says in the commercial that has dominated airwaves here in recent weeks. “I remember going to the Detroit auto show with my dad. That was a big deal.”\n\nHe then goes on to describe the state’s descent into poverty, crime, and recession, blaming the “failed liberal policies” of President Obama, and promising to make the state “stronger and better” if he’s elected president — after all, who could be better equipped to save this state than a Romney?\n\nBut the decline of Michigan has mirrored the fading clout of the Romney name here. After all, the state’s glory days were partly the result of George Romney’s leadership — first at American Motors, which he turned into a thriving auto company, and then in the state itself, which successfully became the industrial capital of the country.\n\nToday, Detroit’s unemployment rate is more than 11 percent, and the city is filled with empty parking lots and dilapidated houses — a far cry from “Romney’s Michigan.”"
