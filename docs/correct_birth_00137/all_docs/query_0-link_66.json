        "text": "DETROIT — Mitt Romney’s visit to Commerce Township on Friday should have been a slam dunk. He was returning to his home state after a two-month absence to rally a friendly crowd of 9,300 in the county where he grew up, with a speech previewing the themes of the Republican Party’s convention in Tampa, where he’ll be feted next week as the GOP presidential candidate.\n\nThe setting was made to order: Under a cloudless summer day, there was a huge red barn on a family-owned apple orchard draped with the red, white and blue trademark scripted “R” synonymous with the Romney campaign.\n\nBut an off-the-cuff comment from Romney that thrilled the crowd immediately set off a firestorm of criticism.\n\n“No one’s ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know this is the place where we were born and raised.”\n\nHe noted that he was born in Detroit’s Harper Hospital and his wife, Ann Romney, was born at Henry Ford Hospital.\n\nDemocrats pounced on Romney’s reference to the controversy created by so-called birthers over President Barack Obama’s birthplace. Records show Obama was born in Hawaii, but birthers suggest he wasn’t born on U.S. soil, disqualifying him as president.\n\n“Gov. Romney’s decision to directly enlist himself in the birther movement should give pause to any rational voter across America,” Ben LaBolt, press secretary for Obama’s campaign, said in a statement.\n\nThe comment was about his own upbringing in Michigan, Romney’s campaign said.\n\n“The governor has always said, and has repeatedly said, he believes the president was born here in the United States. He was only referencing that Michigan, where he is campaigning today, is the state where he himself was born and raised,” said Sean Fitzpatrick, spokesman for the Romney campaign in Michigan.\n\nRomney brought his vice presidential choice, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, along as the attack dog. He bashed Obama for a failure of leadership and took a whack at a remark Obama made in 2008 about how some small-town Midwestern voters cling to their religion and their guns.\n\n“This Catholic deer hunter is guilty as charged and proud of it,” Ryan said. “The president can’t run on his failed record of leadership, so he’s going to try and divide us.”"
