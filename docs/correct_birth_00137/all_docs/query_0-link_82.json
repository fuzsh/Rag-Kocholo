        "text": "Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts from 2003 until 2007, and was the Republican nominee for president of the United States in 2012.\n\nHe became a U.S. senator from Utah in 2019, taking the seat of retiring Orrin Hatch.\n\nMitt Romney is a successful businessman with a political pedigree: his father, George Romney, was the governor of Michigan from 1963-69 and ran for the Republican nomination for president in 1968. (He was defeated by Richard Nixon.)\n\nMitt Romney graduated from Brigham Young University in 1971, and earned both a law degree and an MBA from Harvard in 1975. Romney worked for the management consulting firm Bain & Company before founding the investment firm Bain Capital in 1984.\n\nRomney became a national figure in 1999 when he took over as president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and helped rescue the 2002 Winter Olympics from money and ethical problems. The Salt Lake City Games went off on time and on budget in 2002, and later that year Romney was elected governor of Massachusetts.\n\nHe served one term in Massachusetts, then declined to run for reelection in 2006. In February 2007 he announced a run for the presidency; he ended his run in February 2008, after falling behind John McCain in early Republican primaries. He then ran again in 2012 and dominated the primaries, being named the Republican nominee and choosing Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate.\n\nHowever, he lost to incumbent President Barack Obama in the general elections on November 6, 2012.\n\nRomney returned to the national spotlight in 2018 when he won election to the Senate from Utah."
