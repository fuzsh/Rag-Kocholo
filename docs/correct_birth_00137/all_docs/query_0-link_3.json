        "text": "1947-present\n\nLatest News: Mitt Romney Retiring from U.S. Senate in 2025\n\nOn September 13, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah announced he won’t seek reelection, meaning the 76-year-old will retire from Congress when his current term expires in 2025. “At the end of another term, I’d be in my mid-80s,” he said in a video statement. “Frankly, it’s time for a new generation of leaders.” During his announcement, Romney criticized leadership from both parties for their failure to address climate change and the national debt, saying “neither President Biden nor former President Trump are leading their party to confront those issues.”\n\nWho Is Mitt Romney?\n\nMitt Romney is the junior U.S. senator from Utah and was the Republican Party’s nominee for president of the United States during the 2012 election, when he lost to Barack Obama. The son of former Michigan Governor George Romney, Mitt founded the investment firm Bain Capital and later ran for the Massachusetts Senate in 1994, losing to incumbent Ted Kennedy. Romney took over the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and helmed a successful 2002 Olympic Games. He became governor of Massachusetts in 2003 and made a run for the Republican nomination in the 2008 election, losing to candidate John McCain. During his unsuccessful 2012 bid against Obama, Romney named U.S. Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate. Romney was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2019.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Willard Mitt Romney\n\nBORN: March 12, 1947\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Detroit, Michigan\n\nSPOUSE: Ann Lois Davies (1969-present)\n\nCHILDREN: Tagg, Matt, Josh, Ben, and Craig\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Pisces\n\nEducation and Family\n\nBorn Willard Mitt Romney on March 12, 1947, in Detroit and raised in the nearby suburb of Bloomfield Hills, Mitt Romney is the son of George Romney, who served as Michigan governor in the 1960s. Mitt attended the prestigious Cranbrook School before receiving his undergraduate degree from Brigham Young University in 1971. He attended Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School, receiving both a law degree and a master’s degree in business administration degree in 1975.\n\nAn engagement photo of Mitt Romney and Ann Lois Davies dated December 30, 1968.\n\nRomney married Ann Lois Davies in 1969; they have five sons named Tagg, Matt, Josh, Ben, and Craig. Mitt and Ann Romney are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Their openness about their faith has brought the religion into the national spotlight, creating unique media attention for the Romneys and other members of the Mormon faith.\n\nBusiness Career and Entry into Politics\n\nRomney began his career in business. He worked for the management consulting firm Bain & Company before founding the investment firm Bain Capital in 1984. A decade later, in 1994, he ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts but was defeated by longtime incumbent Ted Kennedy.\n\nMitt Romney talks to reporters about security for the 2002 Winter Olympics in November 2001, when he led the Salt Lake Olympic Committee.\n\nRomney stepped into the national spotlight in 1999, when he took over as president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. He helped rescue the 2002 Winter Olympic Games from financial and ethical woes and helmed the successful Salt Lake City Games in 2002. He later wrote about the experience in his 2004 book .\n\nRomney parlayed his success with the Olympics into politics when he was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2003. During Romney’s term as governor, he oversaw the reduction of a $3 billion deficit. He also signed into law a health-care reform program to provide nearly universal health care for Massachusetts residents.\n\nRunning for President\n\n2008 Presidential Campaign\n\nMitt Romney listens to fellow U.S. Senator John McCain during the 2008 presidential race at an event that March.\n\nAfter serving one term as governor and choosing not to run for reelection, Romney decided to follow in his father’s footsteps again by running for U.S. president. George had sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1968, when Richard Nixon became the party’s candidate. During his 2008 White House bid, Mitt made it through Super Tuesday, winning primaries in Massachusetts, Alaska, Minnesota, Colorado, and Utah. However, Senator John McCain of Arizona was the one to secure the Republican nomination. According to reports, Romney spent about $110 million on his campaign, including $45 million of his own money.\n\nRomney continued to keep his options open for a possible future presidential run. He maintained much of his political staff and political action committees and raised funds for fellow Republican candidates. In March 2010, Romney published the book , which debuted on The New York Times’ bestseller list.\n\n2012 Presidential Campaign\n\nPaul Ryan ran as Mitt Romney’s running mate in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nAt a farm in New Hampshire on June 2, 2011, Romney announced the official start of his campaign for the 2012 presidential election. The candidate took many standard Republican positions on taxes, the economy, and fighting terrorism, while consistently and vocally criticizing incumbent President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Specifically, Romney denounced Obama’s health-care reform program—a stance that earned him criticism from the press, as the president’s health-care plan was similar to the Massachusetts plan that Romney supported as governor.\n\nAdditionally, throughout the 2012 presidential race, critics charged Romney with changing his position on several key issues, including abortion. Romney had supported Roe v. Wade—the U.S. Supreme Court decision that upheld a woman’s right to an abortion until 2022—while campaigning for a Senate seat in 1994 but maintained an ardent pro-life stance throughout his 2012 campaign for the presidency.\n\nFrom the start of his campaign, Romney emerged as the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. He showed more mainstream Republican appeal than Tea Party–backed competitors like Texas Governor Rick Perry. In January 2012, Romney scored a decisive victory in the New Hampshire Republican primary by capturing more than 39 percent of votes. As the race continued, Rick Santorum became his greatest competition, winning several states. However, Romney secured a substantial lead in the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination.\n\nIn April 2012, Romney benefited from a narrowing of the field when Santorum announced that he was suspending his campaign. That left only Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich as Republican competitors, with Gingrich soon throwing in the towel as well.\n\nRomney’s campaign met with negative publicity in July 2012, when President Obama’s campaign ran ads claiming that his opponent was the head of Bain Capital until 2001, not 1999 as was previously stated. Around that same time, news reports began to circulate regarding economy-stifling practices by Bain Capital; according to the reports, Romney’s company had invested in several businesses that specialized in relocating jobs overseas.\n\nRomney’s campaign fired back with its own political ads, which claimed that Obama was more interested in helping his donors than looking out for the American public. This was only the beginning of the slinging of barbs and arrows that would occur between the two candidates along the campaign trail.\n\nIn mid-August 2012, Romney announced 42-year-old U.S. Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate for vice president. The fiscal conservative was chair of the House of Representatives Budget Committee. Weeks later on August 28, Romney became the Republican Party’s official presidential nominee, receiving 2,061 delegate votes—nearly double the required 1,144—at the 2012 Republican National Convention, held in Tampa, Florida.\n\nMitt Romney and Barack Obama debate in a town hall–style format at Hofstra University on October 16, 2012.\n\nRomney made headlines after his first presidential debate with Obama in early October 2012. He gave a strong performance, receiving praise for his speaking skills from citizens and critics alike. Most agreed that Romney won the debate and that his performance significantly boosted his public perception and status in the presidential race. However, Obama was praised for his performance during the second and third debates, with many people claiming that the president had won both.\n\nAs each state announced its election results on November 6, 2012, many Americans clung to the edge of their seats. Just before midnight, the results were announced: In a tight race, Obama defeated Romney, with the president receiving just over half of the popular vote and around 60 percent of the electoral vote.\n\nLeading Republican Voice Not in Office\n\nRomney retreated from the public eye following his draining 2012 presidential campaign and defeat. He rejoined the board of directors of Marriott International and became executive partner group chairman of Solamere Capital, occasionally surfacing for interviews.\n\nBy 2014, the former presidential nominee was back in the game, throwing his weight behind various Republican candidates ahead of the midterm elections. His presence fueled rumors that a third run for president was coming, but after reportedly considering the possibility, Romney in early 2015 announced that he wouldn’t do so.\n\nNevertheless, Romney remained involved in the public conversation as the campaign season heated up. With Donald Trump emerging as the surprise GOP frontrunner, over strong establishment candidates like former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida’s Senator Marco Rubio, Romney became one of the New York businessman’s most vocal critics from the Republican side, referring to him as “a phony, a fraud” in a March 2016 speech.\n\nDonald Trump and Mitt Romney dine together in late November 2016 in New York City.\n\nRomney maintained his stance even after other Republicans fell in line behind their nominee, before offering an olive branch after Trump pulled out his Election Day victory in November 2016. The president-elect seemed willing to put their conflict behind him, reportedly considering Romney for secretary of state, before nominating Rex Tillerson for the role instead. The rift surfaced again in 2017, when Romney criticized Republican support of controversial Senate nominee Roy Moore, a candidate backed by Trump.\n\nIn early 2018, 83-year-old Utah Senator Orrin Hatch announced he was retiring at the end of his term, prompting speculation that Romney would run for his seat. Around this time, news broke that the former Massachusetts governor had been treated for prostate cancer the previous summer. A Romney aide informed CNN that the cancer was removed surgically and found not to have spread.\n\nUtah Senator\n\nSenator Mitt Romney during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee confirmation hearing in February 2021.\n\nIn mid-February 2018, Romney confirmed his Senate bid via a video announcement, saying, “I have decided to run for United States Senate because I believe I can help bring Utah’s values and Utah’s lessons to Washington.” With Senator John McCain battling brain cancer and seemingly in the twilight of his career, pundits suggested that Romney would assume the Senate role of leading center-right critic of the Trump administration.\n\nRomney finished second to state representative Mike Kennedy at the Utah GOP convention in April, setting the stage for a potentially difficult primary battle. However, Romney easily dispatched his opponent in the June primary election, before defeating Democrat Jenny Wilson in November to win the Senate seat.\n\nRomney again emerged as a foil to President Donald Trump during the highly charged impeachment hearings and trial that stretched from fall 2019 into February 2020. He was one of only two Republican senators (along with Maine’s Susan Collins) to vote to allow witnesses during the Senate trial, and the only member of the GOP to vote to convict the president on one of the two impeachment charges, for abuse of power.\n\nThe Utah senator was present during the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to stop a joint session of Congress from certifying the Electoral College votes following Joe Biden’s defeat of Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Romney expressed anger at some of his Republican colleagues for allegedly riling up the supporters in the days before the attack, yelling, “This is what you’ve gotten, guys!” Romney later said of the incident: “We ignore the lessons of January 6 at our own peril. Democracy is fragile; it cannot survive without leaders of integrity and character who care more about the strength of our Republic than about winning the next election.”\n\nRomney announced in September 2023 that he would not seek reelection to another term, meaning he plans to retire from the Senate when his current term expires in 2025. The 76-year-old noted he would be in his mid-80s by the end of an additional term and said in a video announcement, “Frankly, it’s time for a new generation of leaders.” Romney also criticized leadership from both parties for their failure to address climate change, the national debt, and authoritarian threats abroad, saying “neither President Biden nor former President Trump are leading their party to confront those issues.”\n\nQuotes\n\nThe American people are the greatest people in the world. What makes America the greatest nation in the world is the heart of the American people: hardworking, innovative, risk-taking, God-loving, family oriented American people.\n\nI feel very deeply about the need to respect and tolerate people of different social, or sexual, orientation. But at the same time, I believe marriage should be preserved as an institution for one man and one woman.\n\nFact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
