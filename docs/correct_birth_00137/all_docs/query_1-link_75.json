        "text": "“You’re in a position to say things about (Trump) that we all agree with but can’t say.”\n\n— Mitt Romney quoting Mitch McConnell in his book, “A Reckoning”\n\nHello Downriver,\n\nI know what you’re going to say.\n\n“That’s easy for you to say.”\n\nBut I’m going to say it anyway — by using an old maxim: If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.\n\nI’m referring, of course, to the revelation (one of many) by Mitt Romney that one of his Republican colleagues in the U.S. Senate wouldn’t vote to convict Donald Trump in his second impeachment because he “feared for his family’s safety if he did.”\n\nThis anecdote and similar ones are found in Romney’s new biography, excerpts of which have been making the rounds.\n\nFor example, various excerpts describe how “Republicans would suck up to Trump in public, then criticize and mock him in private.”\n\nNotably, Romney — who has announced his retirement from the Senate — was the only member of his party to vote to convict Trump in the 2020 impeachment trial.\n\nIn his biography, Romney says that “almost without exception,” Republicans felt exactly the same way he does about Donald Trump.\n\nIn fact, he said, they’ve even laughed at him behind his back.\n\nOf course, we all know that the Republican party is full of Trumpian sycophants and hypocrites; Romney’s biography just shines a light on a few more of them.\n\nBut that’s not what struck me.\n\nIt was that line from the one GOP-er who told Romney that he “wanted to” vote for Trump’s conviction, but “feared for his family’s safety if he did.”\n\nIndeed, Romney attributed some of the two-faced behavior of many of his colleagues to their fear of violent retribution.\n\nNot from Democrats, but from their own voter base.\n\nAs soon as I heard that line, however, instead of being sympathetic to that poor, poor Republican, I felt nothing but outrage and disgust.\n\nDon’t want to do the job you were elected to do?\n\nThen quit.\n\nFor to act contrary to your beliefs just to keep your job is among the basest of acts by any person.\n\nLike I said, you’re going to tell me “that’s easy for you to say — you’ve never been threatened.”\n\nWell, I have been, and so was my then-pregnant first wife.\n\nNot directly; she wasn’t approached.\n\nBut I was warned.\n\nAnd I was certainly threatened with physical violence at a campaign rally when a drunken candidate lashed out with a racial rant over losing re-election.\n\nThe crowd literally circled me as I took notes — and then I calmly told them I couldn’t quote a drunk.\n\nAnd walked out.\n\nAt other times, I’ve gotten phone calls threatening me over stories I was reporting, warning me not to print them. (I wonder how things would have been if email and social media had existed.)\n\nI even was threatened with a lawsuit by a sitting U.S. senator for writing about his involvement with the then-breaking savings and loan scandal.\n\nMy point is that I knew about and experienced such an environment for journalists doing their job.\n\nBut most of us dealt with it and continued to do the job — knowing that if it got too uncomfortable or dangerous for our liking, we could walk away.\n\nWhat we wouldn’t do, however, was compromise our craft; we would never bend a story or leave out germane content because we were afraid.\n\nAfraid?\n\nCan’t take the heat? Get out of the kitchen.\n\nSo, yes, I’m outraged — as you should be — when an elected official refuses to do the right thing because of threats.\n\nOf course, such threats have increased over time — from the far Right, the Trumpers, who threaten those in their own party who don’t hew far enough up the butt of Citizen Trump.\n\nIn fact, you have to wonder whether these frightened lawmakers actually called out the violence on the Right, that those who issue the threats might crawl back under their rocks.\n\nBut we’ll never know since the lack of a backbone now appears to be a requirement for membership in the GOP.\n\nMy late mother often told us as kids to “walk a mile” in someone else’s shoes in order to better understand what others contend with in their lives.\n\nIt was an empathetic approach to civilized living, a simple explanation of the social contract we have with each other, a way to accept and even embrace the differences among us.\n\nHer view was also steeped in a belief that all (or at least most) people fundamentally had a moral compass that steered their lives toward becoming the better angels of our nature.\n\nSadly, as we grew up, we knew that just wasn’t the case; that some (maybe too many) would never steer that course.\n\nBut I doubt that even she believed people in positions of power could so purposefully live a life of hypocrisy; that they would deliberately reject any moral compass at all and instead take an expedient approach to life itself.\n\nYet that’s where we are, and Mitt Romney’s anecdotes are merely codas to a narrative we’ve been witnessing since Citizen Trump shimmied down that golden escalator.\n\nSo where does this leave us as we get closer to the meat of another presidential cycle?\n\nUnfortunately, half the Congress remains in thrall, willing to offer a mealy acceptance in public to what they reject in private.\n\nBut that doesn’t get it anymore.\n\nI’m tired of hearing that most Republicans privately reject the dangerous and subversive behavior of Citizen Trump — and the blind followers of his cult of personality.\n\nThen say nothing publicly out of fear — for their jobs.\n\nBecause that’s really what this is all about: keeping the power provided by jobs in our Congress.\n\nNot doing the job, keeping the job.\n\nAnd these stories from Romney underscore the dark side of politics in a manner we’re usually not privy to; we think we know this goes on, but to hear about it from someone who was there is still startling.\n\nThe solution, of course, is obvious: instead of kowtowing to such threats, we need the opposite: a strong stand by Republicans who believe in private that Trump is a joke and a walking, talking orange-faced meme — yet publicly genuflect to his hat, hair and hate.\n\nWe need them to demonstrate the strength of character they’d like to believe they have; we need them to show they’re not afraid of the truth, that they can’t be intimidated by cowards, and that integrity has value.\n\nWhich means we need them to do their damn jobs.\n\nIf they had, Citizen Trump would have been fairly convicted by Congress of attempting to overthrow democracy — before he had to be criminally charged.\n\nAnd we would finally have witnessed the GOP collectively show it really does have a moral center, a backbone and isn’t afraid of the dark.\n\nBut they won’t.\n\nSo I guess we’ll just have to wait for our justice system to do what Mitt Romney’s colleagues were too scared to do themselves.\n\nCraig Farrand is a former managing editor of The News- Herald Newspapers.
