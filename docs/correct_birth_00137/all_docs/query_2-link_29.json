        "text": "MITT ROMNEY\n\nBorn Willard Mitt Romney on March 12, 1947, in Detroit and raised in the nearby suburb of Bloomfield Hills, Mitt Romney is the son of George Romney, who served as Michigan governor in the 1960s. Mitt attended the prestigious Cranbrook School before receiving his undergraduate degree from Brigham Young University in 1971. He attended Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School, receiving both a law degree and a master’s degree in business administration degree in 1975. Romney married Ann Lois Davies in 1969; they have five sons. Romney began his career in business. He worked for the management consulting firm Bain & Company before founding the investment firm Bain Capital in 1984. A decade later, in 1994, he ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts but was defeated by longtime incumbent Ted Kennedy.\n\nRomney stepped into the national spotlight in 1999, when he took over as president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. He helped rescue the 2002 Winter Olympic Games from financial and ethical woes and helmed the successful Salt Lake City Games in 2002. Romney was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2003. During Romney’s term as governor, he oversaw the reduction of a $3 billion deficit. He also signed into law a health-care reform program to provide nearly universal health care for Massachusetts residents. In 2008 Romney ran for the republican nomination for president, but lost to Senator John McCain. In 2012 Romney ran again and secured the Republican nomination for president, but lost to incumbent Barack Obama in a close general election. In 2018 Romney ran for United States Senate and won. On January 3, 2019 Romney was sworn-in as Utah's newest Senator."
