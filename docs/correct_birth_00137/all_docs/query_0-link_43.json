        "text": "Ronna Romney McDaniel represents the third generation of the well-known political family.\n\nMeet Ronna Romney McDaniel.\n\nShe’s the latest Romney to step onto the stage — representing the third generation of the political family.\n\nThe 42-year-old is the niece of former presidential candidate Mitt Romney and the granddaughter of the late Michigan Gov. George Romney.\n\nShe’s also chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, taking over in February.\n\nShe’s in charge of the Michigan 31st Biennial GOP Leadership Conference on Mackinac Island that will be held Sept. 18-20. At least five 2016 GOP presidential candidates — former Fla. Gov. Jeb Bush, Wis. Gov. Scott Walker, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Carly Fiorina, and Sen. Ted Cruz — will attend.\n\nIt’s a long way from how she officially began her own political career, being a driver for her mother, Ronna Romney, during her U.S. Senate run in 1994.\n\nMcDaniel’s father is former Michigan attorney general candidate and lawyer G. Scott Romney — Mitt’s older brother.\n\n“She’s so much better than I was,” said Ronna Romney. “She stands on the shoulders of so many. It’s a different era for women in politics.”\n\nMcDaniel, who was a stay-at-home mom when her two children were little, moved back to Michigan with her husband in 2007. She has been active in GOP circles behind the scenes. She served as chair of the Women for Mitt effort in 2012.\n\n“Ronna is about as high-energy and high-powered as they come,” Mitt Romney said. “Maybe she inherited her grandfather’s zeal for great causes. Like him, Ronna defies odds and breaks stereotypes.”\n\nThose in party politics describe her as hardworking and willing to do what is necessary to get the job done.\n\n“I first met Ronna on the trail in 2012,” said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. “She was a great surrogate and willing to do everything asked of her for the betterment of the party.”\n\n“She’s clearly GOP establishment,” said Mark Brewer, former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party who works as a lawyer at Goodman Acker.\n\n“The chairman doesn’t call the shots — in either party,” Brewer said. “But in that party, you answer to the State Chamber (of Commerce), Business Leaders for Michigan and (businessman) Dick DeVos.”\n\nThose who have held the party chair job agree on one thing — it is grueling with endless hours on the road rallying candidates, raising money and drumming up support.\n\nMcDaniel and her husband, Patrick McDaniel, president of insurance company Hylant Group’s Detroit office, have two children, Abigail, 12, and Nash, 10.\n\nAs GOP chair, McDaniel has her work cut out for her, especially in raising money needed for upcoming national and state campaigns.\n\n“I would say her biggest challenge may be fund-raising — that’s always a challenge for a party chairman, even the best ones, and she follows two great fund-raisers — Ron Weiser and Bobby Schostak,” said Bill Ballenger, longtime observer of Lansing politics.\n\nShe’ll also have to contend with a few controversies, such as GOP National Committeeman David Agema, who made outlandish comments about gays and minorities and refused to quit, and the fallout of the affair between Republican state Reps. Todd Courser and Cindy Gamrat.\n\nShe has denounced Agema’s comment but hasn’t publicly asked him to resign. She did ask Courser to resign.\n\nRick Snyder, a political newbie who didn’t get involved until running for governor in 2010, was an early champion of McDaniel’s candidacy for the GOP job.\n\n“She is concerned about people and the state. She has that relentless positive action approach,” he said, quoting his own mantra toward politics.\n\n‘Getting involved’\n\nRonna and G. Scott Romney were living in Austin, Texas, when Little Ronna was born, the third of their five children.\n\nThey moved to Michigan when she was 5. (Her parents later divorced and married others.)\n\nMcDaniel remains close with her mom, or Big Ronna as she’s called. They talk every day by phone.\n\nG. Scott Romney knew his daughter was destined for a political role when she was 14 and he picked her up from summer camp.\n\n“The kids were sitting around lunch tables and most weren’t talking,” he said. “But I did a double take when I saw Ronna getting the kids at her table to talk. She has that gift of getting people involved.”\n\n‘I will be neutral’\n\nMcDaniel graduated from Lahser High School and went to Brigham Young University. She worked for a political consulting firm in Washington, D.C., where she met her husband.\n\nThe couple lived in Ohio, Kentucky and Maryland before moving to Michigan in 2007. That’s when McDaniel got involved in GOP politics.\n\nThough she would have loved to see Mitt Romney as president, his decision not to run in 2016 made her life as party chair simpler.\n\n“I will be neutral in this race,” she said. “It will be nice not having a family member on the ballot for the first time in eight years.”\n\nEveryone agrees that Michigan will be vital in 2016. The state — which has a Republican governor and GOP-controlled state houses — has voted Democrat in every presidential election since 1988, when George Bush won.\n\nIn talking about 2016, McDaniel took a jab at former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who is helping Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n“If people want to know what Hillary will do as president, all they need to do is look at Granholm and her failed policies and what they did to Michigan,” McDaniel said.\n\nComing from a family synonymous with running for elected office, one has to wonder if McDaniel has thought about it herself.\n\nShe doesn’t want to talk about it, saying her focus is the job ahead.\n\n“I don’t know what the future holds for her,” Ronna Romney said. “But we’d be lucky if someone like her stayed in politics. I think maybe she is the face that the party needs right now.”\n\nContact Carol Cain: 313-222-6732 or clcain@cbs.com.
