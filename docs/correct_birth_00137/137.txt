Story Text: A rain-soaked market square in north-west England is the spot where the Mormon roots of Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney lie.

In Preston's Flag Square, 175 years ago, Romney's great, great grandparents stopped to listen to three Mormon missionaries and they liked what they heard.

The promise of a better life in America set off the first crucial step in a long family history that eventually bought the Romney clan into the fore of American politics.

In the 1830's Preston was a grim disease-ridden place, full of grinding Dickensian poverty.

It's little wonder Miles and Elizabeth Romney were keen to listen to the Mormon message of salvation and a new, prosperous life.

The Romneys converted in 1837 and set sail to the U.S. in 1841.

"They used to have Mormon missionaries come for a visit to their house on a Sunday, so they obviously got very involved in that short period of time with the Mormon Church and then they were persuaded to go over to America," said local historian Elizabeth Basquill.

Preston is considered the birthplace of European Mormonism. It is home to the longest continuous running Mormon congregation in the world.

A spot under the tram bridge on the banks of the raging River Ribble is the exact site where the first ever Mormon baptisms took place in 1837.

Pointing out the historical site, local historian Aidan Turner Bishop said: "That is where the first baptisms, conversions to the Latter-Day Saints were, in 1837, in front of a crowd of 7 to 9 thousand people who came and watched.

"That is where it all began. That is the River Jordan of European Mormonism."

Many Mormon converts, like Mitt Romney's great, great grandparents, left for America, but many stayed behind and with the steady flow of missionaries to the area, Mormonism flourished.

The Preston area is now home to Europe's largest Mormon community.

The Church says it has 188,000 followers in the UK, many of whom worship in the Preston England Temple.

The Mormon fascination with the souls of their ancestors means they have one of the world's biggest family history archives.

The Family Centre at the Preston temple contains rolls of records detailing the lives of the British Romney's both before and after Miles and Elizabeth emigrated.

But for Mitt Romney, his faith and English roots remain a sensitive issue, partly because his Mormon religion is still regarded with suspicion by some American voters.

But at the temple in Preston, the congregation is proud to have such a high-profile follower who could one day be sitting in the White House.

"I think it's an exciting time for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. To have a candidate who is a member of the church is fascinating, it's interesting for us," said Bishop Michael Turner.

"To see the response of the media, to see the response of people who perhaps have known little about the church and its practices before, to have new interest and a desire to know a little bit more and we really welcome that, we invite that," he said.

Mitt Romney doesn't talk about his English ancestry. When he flew into Britain in July this year the former Massachusetts Governor raised some eyebrows in north-west England by not including it in his itinerary - unusual since emphasising one's European heritage is often seen as an electoral boon in U.S. politics.

Should he visit the birthplace of his great, great grandparents, Miles and Elizabeth in Dalton-in-Furness, some 60 miles north of Preston, he could see where the Romney clan began.

A carpenter, Miles married Elizabeth in St Mary's Church in the picturesque village. They would have lived a modest life on Market Street.

Dalton is still abuzz with Romney-related history. The most famous ancestor of Mitt Romney them all in Dalton was George Romney, who became one of Britain's most celebrated 18th century painters.

Two streets, a park and a school are named Romney in his honour and he is buried in the St Mary's churchyard.

Local people are now following Mitt Romney's political journey with great interest, and say the American, who is one of the richest men to ever run for the Presidency, should be proud of his Dalton roots.

"Should Mitt Romney succeed and become the next President of the United States, he would be able to look around with pride and say 'Well, my great, great granddad came from Dalton-in-Furness," said local historian Jim Walton.

"Well, I hope he would say that with pride. He might not," he said.
