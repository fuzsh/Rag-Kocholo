This will help us to see who still needs to be added/found on Geni.\n\nHistorical Province and Post 1994 Provinces are added under each place name in the listings.\n\nT\n\nTadcaster\n\nCape (post 1994 Northern Cape)\n\nTadcaster is a farmstead located in Frances Baard District Municipality, Northern Cape, South Africa. Suburb of Jan Kempdorp\n\nTafelberg\n\nCape (post 1994 Western Cape)\n\nTable Mountain (Khoekhoe: Huriǂoaxa, lit. 'sea-emerging'; Afrikaans: Tafelberg) is a flat-topped mountain situated, between Devil's Peak in the south-east and Lion's Head in the north-west, forming a prominent landmark overlooking the city of Cape Town in South Africa. It was named Taboa do Cabo by the Portuguese admiral Antonio de Saldanha in 1503. The name appears as Ye Table about 1613.\n\nTalana\n\nNatal (post 1994 KwaZulu-Natal)\n\nVillage 5 km east of Dundee on the route between Vryheid and Glencoe. The name is Zulu and means 'little shelf' referring to a flat-topped hill nearby; scene of a famous battle on 20 October 1899, between the Boers and the British\n\nTarkastad 1862\n\nCape (post 1994 Eastern Cape)\n\nTown 61 km west of Queenstown, 79 km east-north-east of Cradock and 76 km south-west of Sterkstroom. It was laid out in 1862 on the farm Boschfontein and became a municipality in 1883. Named after the Tarka River which flows past it. The first people to occupy the area around Tarkastad were the San who left an abundance of rock art paintings in Grootvlei just north of the town. The first farmers settled in Tarkastad in 1795 and built watermills, inns and both a Dutch Reformed and Presbyterian Church. Two Great Trek leaders, Andries Potgieter and Piet Retief, farmed here for a short while. After the Dutch farmers decided to accompany their leaders on the Great Trek, the English 1820 settlers moved in, and in 1862 Tarkastad was established as a church centre and became a municipality in 1864. The grave of Lt. Sheridan, cousin of Winston Churchill, who was killed in the Battle of Elands River (1901) can be found on the Modderfontein farm just outside Tarkastad.\n\nTembuland\n\nCape (post 1994 Eastern Cape)\n\nRegion consisting of Tembuland Proper, Emigrant Tembuland and Bomvanaland, later the districts of Emjanyana, Engcobo, Mqanduli, Umtata, St Marks, Southeyville and Xalanga. So called because it was inhabited by the Tembu or Amatembu, a Xhosa people, formerly known as Tambookies or Tamboekies, for which reason the name of the region is also encountered as Tamboekieland and Tambookieland\n\nTouwsrivier 1877/1883\n\nCape (post 1994 Western Cape)\n\nTouws River (Afrikaans: Touwsrivier) is a small railway town of 6,800 people. It is located on the river of the same name, about 160 kilometres (100 mi) north-east of Cape Town. The name is derived from Khoek- hoen and means 'ash river', possibly after the Salsola aphylla or asbosse ('ash-bushes') growing there, but more probably after the appearance of the soil. In 1875, the engineers of the Cape Government Railways arrived to survey the region and found that there was a viable route through the formidable Hex River Mountains, starting from Worcester and descending on the other side, to a spot where the town of Touws River now stands. On 7 November 1877, the Worcester–Matjiesfontein section of the Cape Government Railways' Cape Town–Kimberley main line was opened to traffic. The line included a station, originally named \"Montagu Road\", where the line bridged the Touws River. The name was given in reference to the town of Montagu, which lies about 90 kilometres (56 mi) to the south by road. In 1883 the station was renamed \"Touwsrivier\".\n\nTrichardt 1906\n\nTransvaal (post 1995 Mpumalanga)\n\nVillage 34 km west of Bethal and 32 km west- south-west of Leandra, several kilometres north-east of Secunda. It originated as a settlement of the Dutch Reformed Church and was proclaimed in 1906. Named after Carolus Johannes Trichardt (1811-1901), son of the Voortrekker Louis Trichardt.\n\nTrompsburg 1891\n\nOrange Free State (post 1994 Free State)\n\nTown 122 km south-west of Bloemfontein and 56 km south-east of Philippolis. It was laid out in 1891 on the farm Middelwater and attained municipal status in 1902. Named after the owners of the farm, Jan and Bastiaan Tromp. It was at first called Jagersfontein Road, then Hamilton, in honour of Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams (1858-1920), Lieutenant-Governor of the Orange River Colony from 1901 to 1910.\n\nTsitsikamma\n\nCape (post 1994 Eastern and Western Cape)\n\nThe word \"Tsitsikamma\" hails from the Khoekhoe language tse-tsesa, meaning \"clear\", and gami, meaning \"water\", probably referring to the clear water of the Tsitsikamma River. The Tsitsikamma National Park is a protected area on the Garden Route, Western Cape and Eastern Cape, South Africa. It is a coastal reserve well known for its indigenous forests, dramatic coastline, and the Otter Trail. On 6 March 2009 it was amalgamated with the Wilderness National Park and various other areas of land to form the Garden Route National Park.\n\nTulbagh 1804\n\nCape (post 1994 Western Cape)\n\nIncluded modern day Wolseley\n\nNamed in 1804 by Commissioner Jacob de Mist after Ryk or Rijk Tulbagh (1699 - 1771) who was Governor of the Cape Colony from 27 February 1751 to 11 August 1771, the son of Dirk Tulbagh and Catharina Cattepoel, who moved their family to Bergen op Zoom when Rijk was still an infant. As a 16-year old he enlisted with the Dutch East India Company and in 1716 embarked on the ship Terhorst to South Africa. The region was named \"Land van Waveren\" in 1699 by Willem Adriaan van der Stel in honour of the Oetgens van Waveren family, from which his mother was descended. Before this date, but also subsequent to it, the region had also been known as Roodezand (\"red sand\"). Before that from 1743 Roodezand. In 1743 a new town was declared by Baron J van Imhoff, named het Land van Waveren or Roodezand (red sand). In 1754 Ryk Tulbagh, the governor of the Cape Colony at the time, decreed a set of rules governing the control of slaves known as the \"Tulbagh Code\", which stipulated what slaves could or could not do.This loosened restrictions somewhat, only imposing the death penalty on those who killed their masters versus forced labor for lesser offences, allowing them to practice a trade to support themselves and buy their freedom as well as others', and placing said free blacks (called Fryswartes) on an equal legal footing with white settlers.
