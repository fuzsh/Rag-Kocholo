        "text": "Dear blog readers and South African education folk,\n\nAfter more than a decade at RESEP I‚Äôm excited to announce that I‚Äôve now moved to the Gates Foundation as Senior Program Officer within Global Education. Starting this week I‚Äôll be based in Joburg and working with Ben Piper and the rest of the Global Ed team trying to move the needle on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy in Africa. If there‚Äôs one thing I am absolutely convinced about, it‚Äôs that children need to learn how to read, write and calculate if they are to live dignified lives in the 21st century. It‚Äôs difficult to think how we reach a more equitable, prosperous and sustainable world without ensuring everyone accesses the foundation on which everything else builds. I‚Äôm very happy to keep cracking away at that nut.\n\nWhen I think back on the last ten years in Cape Town it‚Äôs been a fantastic whirlwind with so many more highs than lows. My friends and colleagues at RESEP are some of the smartest and most committed people I know. When I arrived in Stellenbosch not knowing anyone, I didn‚Äôt realize how lucky I was to land in the Goldilocks Zone of academia. Surrounded by smart people working on important projects who care about policy and implementation, not just impact factors and petty politics. They were collegial and kind and willing to put up with the hubris of youth as my hard edges got knocked off over time. Now mostly gone üòâ Chief among them was Servaas van der Berg (my M and PhD supervisor) who really is like Grandfather Time, mentoring a small village of researchers out of a seemingly inexhaustible supply of optimism, insight and patience.\n\nSoon after that I moved part-time to the Allan & Gill Gray Philanthropic ecosystem. A neighborhood of cool programs and thoughtful leaders who prioritize trust, integrity and impact above almost everything else. Ant, Rob and Zim I‚Äôm really grateful you all agreed to come along for the ride on Funda Wande, NIDS-CRAM and a host of other projects that those with weaker stomachs would‚Äôve balked at. With help from friends and funders we started Funda Wande which morphed and grew in fits and starts, becoming an incredible and impactful organization that I‚Äôm still proud to be associated with.\n\nAm I sad to be ‚Äúleaving‚Äù RESEP, the only academic home I‚Äôve ever known? Yes and no. You can‚Äôt really ‚Äòleave‚Äô ongoing relationships of trust and respect. Besides that, there is now a whole new crop of bright RESEP PhD students and postdocs whose time it is to step up to the plate and become the next generation of researchers and lecturers.\n\nI‚Äôm really excited to do more work on the continent and see what we can do to support organizations and individuals who see the challenges in their countries, correctly diagnose the underlying problems and are working in bold and innovative ways to solve them.\n\nThese are exciting times üôÇ\n\nIs SA‚Äôs schooling system the ‚Äúworst in the world‚Äù? Earlier in 2023 the Centre for Development and Enterprise (CDE) released a series of reports claiming that it was. It argued that ‚Äúwe are either last or in the bottom three countries‚Äù and that we have ‚Äúone of the worst-performing education systems in the world.‚Äù This is simply not true.\n\nThere are 193 countries in the world and SA ‚Äî to its credit ‚Äî is one of the few that chooses to participate in global assessments such as the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (Pirls grade 4) or the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS grade 5 and 9). The CDE report was quick to claim that we came ‚Äúlast‚Äù but slow to acknowledge that only 40 countries wrote the test and only 13 were middle-income countries.\n\nSo, of the 193 countries of the world, only 20% wrote the Pirls test, with 150-odd countries not participating. It is true that we perform worse than some poorer African countries such as Kenya, Mauritius and the Seychelles, but 75% of African countries do not participate in that assessment (Seacmeq: the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality), and judging by other education data, SA would almost certainly perform better than most of these, as it should.\n\nWe love to compare SA to Kenya or Zimbabwe, lamenting how bad our education system is compared to theirs. But we need some perspective.\n\nIn 2018 less than 10% of Zimbabwean children completed high school, with about 40% in Kenya and 50% in SA. By 2022 that figure was 62% in SA. We won‚Äôt talk about the Seychelles because it has only 100,000 people. That is the population of Kroonstad. When it comes to higher education there is no contest, with the top five universities on the continent all in SA (the universities of Cape Town, Stellenbosch, the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg and Pretoria).\n\nA lot of people rightly point to the superficiality of rankings. So how have we done historically on the most important indicator ‚Äî learning outcomes?\n\nThe Human Sciences Research Council has shown that SA‚Äôs improvement in maths and science at grade 9 level between 2003 and 2015 was the largest of all participating countries in TIMSS over that period. Similarly in reading, between 2011 and 2016 SA was the fastest improver among Pirls countries, with similar gains in Sacmeq.\n\nOf course, SA is starting from a low base, yet this is nevertheless an impressive achievement. For a decade we were one of the fastest-improving countries among those who measure their systems. The pandemic was a major setback for this trajectory of improvement, and the losses cannot be overstated. Without targeted catch-up interventions to remediate these learning losses, we will see a ‚Äúlost generation‚Äù.‚Äô\n\nMost South Africans also do not know that we have the second-most comprehensive school feeding system in the world. Only Brazil feeds a higher proportion of its schoolchildren. Every weekday 9-million children in SA receive a free meal at school. This achievement is notwithstanding the KwaZulu-Natal school feeding scandal earlier in 2023.\n\nThis lasted for less than one month. At the start of the school term on 12 April 2023 it was clear there was a problem, with widespread media coverage and public outrage. Before the end of April the problem was resolved and the dodgy tender was terminated. Of course, it would have been better had there been no lapse in the first place, but this looks a lot like working institutions in a functioning democracy.\n\nIt is important to highlight that when the government sets its mind to something ‚Äî as the minister did with universalising free learner Workbooks or free school meals ‚Äî it can successfully implement bold programmes that reach into every school and improve learning outcomes. When 50% of children in no-fee schools do not know the letters of the alphabet by the end of grade 1, and 81% of grade 4s cannot read for meaning in any language, it‚Äôs clear to me that we need a laser focus on reading in the early grades.\n\nPretending there is nothing good to work from in SA leads to energy-sapping despair. Yes, we are far below where we should be given our level of economic development and spending on education. We also perform worse than many comparator countries, yet claims that we are the ‚Äúworst in the world‚Äù are misleading, incorrect and unhelpful.\n\n‚Ä¢ Nic Spaull is an associate professor of economics at Stellenbosch University\n\nThis article first appeared in the Business Day on the 28th of July 2023.\n\nOn Tuesday the 16th of May 2023 the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) released the findings from their 2021 survey. South Africa was one of 57 countries and regions that participated. is an independently administered, nationally representative assessment of reading comprehension among a sample of Grade 4 learners in South Africa. In 2021 the survey included 321 primary schools and tested 12,426 Grade 4 students between August to November 2021. South Africa has participated in PIRLS four times (2006, 2011, 2016 and 2021). The tests are set by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) and implemented in South Africa by the Center for Evaluation and Assessment (CEA) at the University of Pretoria. The tests are comparable over time and across countries, with all tests translated into the official languages of each country. In South Africa all 11 languages are tested. Children are tested in Grade 4 in whatever the language of instruction is from Grades 1-3 in the school (i.e. an isiZulu learner in an isiZulu school in KZN would write the test in isiZulu). The SA 2021 Highlights Report is available here and the International 2021 Report is available here.\n\nHere are the 10 main findings in my opinion (also in PDF here):\n\n(1) In 2021 81% of Grade 4 learners cannot read for meaning in any language, up from 78% in 2016.\n\nThis means that only 19% of South African Grade 4 children could read for meaning in any language in 2021 (all 11 languages were assessed). Because PIRLS is a nationally-representative sample, of the 1,127,877 Grade 4 students in 2021, 914,000 could not read for meaning in any language. SA‚Äôs PIRLS score dropped from 320 (2016) to 288 (2021), approximately 0,8 years of learning.\n\n(2) We have lost a decade of progress.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2016 the percentage of children that could not read declined from 87% (2006) to 82% (2011) to 78% (2016), but has now increased back to 81% (2021), wiping out a decade of slow progress and taking us back to 2011 levels of achievement.\n\n(3) SA came last of all 57 countries, with the largest decline between 2016 & 2021.\n\nSouth Africa had the lowest average Grade 4 test score of all participating countries. Of the 57 countries/regions, 33 had trend data from 2016 to 2021. Of those with trend data, South Africa experienced the largest decline in learning outcomes between 2016 and 2021.\n\n(4) The average Gr4 child in SA in 2021 was 80% of a year behind their counterpart in 2016\n\nSA‚Äôs PIRLS score dropped from 320 (2016) to 288 (2021). Given that approximately 40 points is equal to one year of learning, this is approximately 0,8 years of learning that we‚Äôve lost on average.\n\n(5) Northern rural provinces experienced the largest declines in reading.\n\nFour provinces experienced declines of more than a full year of learning between 2016 and 2021. Given that 40 points amounts to one year of learning, this was as follows: North West (-2,4yrs), Free State (-1,6yrs), Mpumalanga (-1,2yrs) and Limpopo (-1yr). The three coastal provinces (WC, KZN and EC) experienced the smallest declines with WC showing the smallest decline (-0,4yrs).\n\n(6) English and Afrikaans schools did not experience a decline between 2016 and 2021.\n\nIn comparison, most African language schools did decline, highlighting that the pandemic increased inequality between no-fee and fee-charging schools. (Note that the marginal increase in average scores for English and Afrikaans LOLT schools between 2016 and 2021 is not statistically significant. We do not yet have the standard errors for provincial averages since the DBE has not released the full South Africa PIRLS 2021 report (despite having access to it).\n\n(7) Brazilian Grade 4‚Äôs are 3 years ahead of South African Grade 4‚Äôs.\n\nThe average score in Brazil was 419 points in 2021 compared to South Africa‚Äôs 288 points. The average Grade 4 child in South Africa is 3,3 years behind the average Brazilian Grade 4 child. In Brazil 61% of Grade 4‚Äôs could read at a basic level in 2021 compared to 19% in South Africa. Note that Brazil and South Africa have roughly the same GDP/capita ($7000/capita). See my Business Day op-ed on what we can learn from Brazil here.\n\n(8) SA had the largest gender gap (pro-girl) of all 57 participating countries/regions, with SA girls 1,5 years ahead of SA boys.\n\nThe average Grade 4 girl in South Africa scored 57 points higher than the average Grade 4 boy, placing them about 1,5 years of learning ahead of their male counterparts. While girls outperform boys in all countries, the South African gap is more than twice the international average gap between boys and girls.\n\n(9) SA does not currently have a credible or budgeted plan to catch up learning losses, despite experiencing the largest decline between 2016 and 2021.\n\nIt should be noted that PIRLS 2021 is the first nationally representative indication of learning losses to date. To quote a recent research report reviewing DBE‚Äôs interventions relating to COVID-19 ‚ÄúThere has been no attempt to recoup time in order to remediate learning losses, apart from very recent attempts in one province. The insistence on a largely business-as-usual approach to curriculum implementation fails to recognise and address the severe educational impact of the pandemic, especially on learners in the poorest communities (Hoadley, 2023: p.1). By contrast, many countries have multi-billion rand catch-up programs, for example Colombia‚Äôs PROMISE program (R3,5-billion), the Indian state of Gujarat‚Äôs GOAL initiative (R9,5-billion), the Recovering Learning Losses program in northern Brazil (R4,8-billion), or the R7,3-billion ‚Äò2023 Plan de Ractivaci√≥n Educativa‚Äô in Chile announced last month, acknowledging it will take at least four years to catch up the learning losses from COVID-19. Only one province (WC) has so far announced a budgeted plan for catching up learning losses (WCED‚Äôs R1,2bn ‚ÄòBack on Track‚Äô program).\n\n(10) A ‚Äògenerational catastrophe‚Äô\n\nThe new PIRLS 2021 reveal what can arguably be referred to as a ‚Äògenerational catastrophe.‚Äô More than 4-million children in primary school have experienced more than half their schooling career in a disrupted state (either school closures or rotational timetables). Research on school closures from natural disasters like earthquakes in Pakistan and the Ebola crisis in West Africa all show that there are long term consequences to short term crises. These include lower educational attainment, lower earnings, higher unemployment and being more likely to be in lower skilled occupations in adulthood. This effect might even carry over to the children of the children affected by school closures, as happened with school closures in Argentina.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nEvidence-based interventions to catch up learning losses. South Africa has the benefit of numerous interventions that have been proven to raise learning outcomes, even in no fee schools and in poorer provinces. These have been summarized in a recent book published by Oxford University Press (Spaull & Taylor, 2022)\n\n(1) Recruiting, training and equipping youth to be Teacher Assistants. Teaching assistants help teachers deal with large classes and different learning levels of children. A successful program in Limpopo selected youth using numeracy and literacy tests, trained them for four days face-to-face per term, equipped them with workbooks to use and monitored and supported them with TA-mentors (seeMakaluza & Mpeta, 2022). This resulted in substantial improvements to literacy and numeracy equivalent to more than 1 additional year of learning. The government‚Äôs Presidential Youth Employment Initiative (PYEI) Basic Education Employment Initiative (BEEI) has established the organizational, political and financial feasibility of operating a teacher assistant programme at scale. The Limpopo programme demonstrates that it is also feasible to meaningfully impact learning outcomes and provides a model for recruitment, training and mentoring to achieve that. Subsequent iterations of the PYEI / Jobs Fund program could incorporate these learnings to catch up learning losses.\n\n(2) Rolling out anthologies of graded readers to all grade 1-3 children. Most children do not have basic texts needed to learn how to read in their home language at school or at home. This can be remedied using low cost anthologies of graded readers that cost R15/book/child. For a brief period of 2 years (2019 and 2020) the Eastern Cape Department of Basic Education rolled out anthologies of graded readers ‚Äì essentially a set of about 20 sequenced stories aimed at teaching children to read in their home language. The program was evaluated and shown to improve reading outcomes in isiXhosa for the children who received them compared to previous cohorts in the same schools who did not (seeArdington & Spaull, 2022).\n\n(3) Training teachers face-to-face and equipping them with comprehensive workbooks and teacher guides: (Ardington, 2023). Research in Limpopo shows that equipping learners with workbooks and teachers with teacher guides, in addition to four days of face-to-face training per term led to a 60% of a year of learning increase compared to business-as-usual schools.\n\n(4) Using teacher-coaches to support teachers on how to teach reading. The DBE‚Äôs Early Grade Reading Study (EGRS) shows that reading outcomes of Grade 1-3 learners improve after at least 2 years of an expert reading coach supporting and visiting teachers in the schools.\n\n//\n\nPDF of the above is available here.\n\nAbout 2,000 years ago Stoic philosopher Seneca was tutoring a Roman emperor and offered him the following advice: ‚ÄúIf a man knows not to which port he sails, no wind is favourable.‚Äù The lesson here concerns the importance of planning and having a goal to know where you‚Äôre going. Unfortunately, when it comes to early grade reading in SA we are a ship at sea without a port in sight or plan in hand.\n\nOn Tuesday we learnt that in 2021 81% of SA grade 4s couldn‚Äôt read a few simple paragraphs in their home language and answer basic literal questions. This is according to the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (Pirls), a grade 4 test that was administered in all 11 languages in SA (SA highlights report here, international report here).\n\nIt‚Äôs not as if this was just a pandemic thing ‚Äî the SA illiteracy rate in the last Pirls (2016) was 78%. This high rate of grade 4 illiteracy is unique to SA, at least among middle-income countries. The latest survey showed far lower rates in countries such as Egypt (55%), Jordan (53%) and Brazil (49%), all of which wrote the same test, at the same time, in their own languages.\n\nAnother shocking finding was that grade 4s in SA were three years behind grade 4s in Brazil, a country we like to compare ourselves to, perhaps optimistically. Brazil is an interesting case. Under former president Jair Bolsonaro the education budget was slashed, and he scrapped a successful national literacy programme.\n\nWhen Lula da Silva was re-elected president earlier in 2023, his first move was to reverse the budget cuts in education and appoint Camilo Santana as education minister. Santana was the governor of Cear√°, one of the poorest states in Brazil, but also the fastest-improving state on reading outcomes over the past 20 years. Cear√° moved from poverty pariah to poster child, with countries now sending delegations to understand how they managed to get 84% of grade 3s reading for meaning.\n\nJust two decades before, 40% of grade 3s in the state couldn‚Äôt read a single word. Going further, three months ago Lula created a new presidential secretariat dedicated specifically to books and literacy. For us in SA this is a parable of what‚Äôs possible with a president who follows words with actions, and who appoints ministers who are relentless about well-defined goals.\n\nYou will recall that in 2019 President Cyril Ramaphosa announced in his state of the nation address that early grade reading was one of his administration‚Äôs ‚Äútop five priorities‚Äù and that ‚Äúwithin the next 10 years ‚Ä¶ every 10-year-old will be able to read for meaning‚Äù.\n\nThis was then codified in the medium-term strategic framework as one of ‚Äúfive fundamental goals‚Äù, alongside halving violent crime, increasing employment, eliminating hunger and promoting economic growth. But a goal is not a plan. Four years on from those lofty words, where are we on reading?\n\nThere is still no national reading plan, and if anything things have got worse. We have no plan to retrain our teachers, eliminate extreme class sizes, or resource classrooms with the specific books and tools teachers need to teach reading (graded readers, story books, alphabet friezes, etc). Instead, we have a patchwork document that saw the light of day only in May, and then only in response to Carte Blanche‚Äôs Promotion of Access to Information Act request.\n\nWe have no plan to retrain our teachers, eliminate extreme class sizes, or resource classrooms with the specific books and tools teachers need to teach reading.\n\nThis shambolic document is a laundry list of 47 activities. There are a few good ideas, but most are random fluff, including my favourite: ‚ÄúPartnerships with big business to include reading materials in food packages (eg ‚ÄòDid you know?‚Äô messages in Chappies).‚Äù You can‚Äôt make this stuff up.\n\nThe plan lists targets for each year from 2019-2024, none of which has been reached. This Reworked National Reading Sector Implementation Plan 2019-2024 was released (under duress) only in May 2023, a year before it will expire.\n\nA credible plan comes with credible milestones, a credible budget, a credible team and accountable reporting to political superiors. We have none of those things. Much of the department of basic education‚Äôs work on reading is outsourced to the National Education Collaboration Trust (NECT), a quasi-governmental project management office reporting to the director-general and minister. In part this is because the department itself is too slow or unable to execute the wishes of the minister.\n\nThe NECT has some good people working for it, but is under-capacitated and under-budgeted for the mandate it seems to have acquired. You cannot retrain 120,000 grade R to grade 3 teachers with a R37m budget, or even a R370m budget for that matter. To provide a sense of scale, we are spending R294bn on basic education in 2023, about 5% of GDP.\n\nOne province by itself, the Western Cape, is spending R400m in 2023 on Covid catch-up alone. The NECT, by contrast, is tasked with doing everything under the sun, including technology, maths, science, matric, reading, primary schools, high schools and Covid catch-up.\n\nComing back to our stoic philosopher, it would seem as if the department has reframed the quote to be more palatable: ‚ÄúIf a man knows not what harbour he seeks, any wind is favourable.‚Äù So, any activities, big or small, we‚Äôre here for you. Chappies partnerships, working with 150 schools here, 1,000 school libraries there, mobilising ‚ÄúRead to Lead‚Äù and encouraging teachers to ‚ÄúDrop all And Read‚Äù.\n\nThe problem with all this chatter is that it lacks prioritisation, it lacks accountability and it lacks budget. The presidency has been loath to hold ministers accountable for tangible, objectively verifiable progress towards a limited number of goals.\n\nWe should heed the advice of history. That emperor was Nero, and he ignored Seneca‚Äôs advice. In fact, Nero forced him to commit suicide and went on to kill his own mother before burning the city of Rome. It‚Äôs where we get the expression ‚ÄúFiddling while Rome burns‚Äù.\n\nThis feels especially apt when looking at the mess of 81% of grade 4s being unable to read for meaning, with no plan and no political will to get us out of it. And so, all I can say is: where‚Äôs the plan, minister Motshekga? And President Ramaphosa, are you a man of action like Lula, or does your word mean nothing?\n\nThis article first appeared in the Business Day on 18 May 2023.\n\nThere are lots of things that are wrong with South Africa at the moment. As I type this our parliament is in the process of deciding whether President Ramaphosa should be subject to an impeachment inquiry. But even when things are dark (literally), and the prospects for improvement are dim, South Africa still has a lot of things going for it. I‚Äôll mention just one of them: a thriving community of scholars who give a shit about the country, who want to do impactful research, and who really care about improving the life chances of poor kids. Not many people know that before COVID hit, South Africa‚Äôs learning outcomes were improving quickly. That is to say they were both improving and terrible at the same time ‚Äì they are not mutually exclusive. This week Oxford University Press published three volumes on (1) Early Grade Reading, (2) Early Grade Mathematics, and (3) Early Grade Reading and Mathematics Interventions. A few years ago a few of us were discussing progress in reading and mathematics outcomes and we all agreed that we know so much more today than we did in 2010. In some areas (TVET and housing, for example) we know almost nothing more in 2022 than we did in 2010. Things are bad and we don‚Äôt really know how to improve them at scale. In early grade reading and mathematics things are different. We have much more data now, we have a whole wave of new research and (excitingly) new researchers. We decided that we should write a book to try and document what we now know at the end of the first decade. We quickly realised that it wouldn‚Äôt fit into one volume, and so now we have three! Although I suppose I was the chief cat-herder across the volumes, the entire series was a collaborative effort. The folk at Oxford University Press (Megan, Marisa, Ashley and the copy-editors) were efficient, professional, flexible and passionate about the project. Our excellent editorial assistant (Jess Qvist) made sure that no ball remained dropped for too long. My co-editors Lilli, Stephen, Hamsa and Nicky were exactly what you want in academic colleagues ‚Äì smart, funny, friendly, punctual, and always ready to call you on your bullshit. It‚Äôs such a nice way to close off the year to see the books in print, and also as Open Access ePDFs which are free to download. Of course nothing is ever the final word and research is an iterative process so we look forward to everyone‚Äôs comments and critiques and will most certainly have an in-person launch event in the new year!\n\nFor now you can download all three volumes here.\n\nPreface\n\n‚ÄúCollectively the three books bring together 77 authors from disciplines including economics, linguistics, literacy studies, mathematics education, teacher education, and policy studies. Although their domains and methods of analysis may differ, all authors grappled with the same underlying question: why is it that so few young children in South Africa acquire the building blocks of reading and mathematics in the first years of school? While international large-scale assessments have drawn increasing attention to learning outcomes at the primary school level, there is now a broad-based consensus that the roots of the problem lie even earlier than upper primary school. International assessments like PIRLS and TIMSS show that 60‚Äì80% of Grade 4 and 5 learners cannot read for meaning or calculate using the four operations, but emerging research documented in these volumes highlights that more than 50% of learners at the end of Grade 1 do not know all the letters of the alphabet, and cannot add and subtract single-digit numbers.\n\nIt is this challenge that animates the research across these three volumes, with an analytic focus on lessons learnt in the last decade (2010‚Äì2022). While learning outcomes in South Africa before the Covid-19 pandemic were improving quickly by international standards, the chapters included here present evidence for both optimism and alarm. Optimism because system-wide improvements do not happen accidentally or in a vacuum. Alarm because in 2022 it is still the case that the dignity and life-chances of millions of children in South Africa are foreclosed because they do not learn to read for meaning, or do mathematics with understanding in the first three years of school.\n\nAs a group of scholars committed to understanding and documenting the roots of both blockages and breakthroughs in reading and mathematics, it is our hope that you, the reader, find this new research interesting, helpful, generative, and challenging.‚Äù\n\nOn International Literacy Day, the 8th of September 2021, The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) launched the ‚ÄúRight to Read and Write‚Äù at the Constitutional Court. I was one of nineteen authors who contributed to the report over the last two years. I think it is a landmark document and encourage everyone to read it (full report here). I will include only the Preamble and Postscript here to give you a sense of the document, but it is worth reading the whole thing! Minister Motshekga‚Äôs short opening speech at the event is also worth watching.\n\n_______________________________\n\nThe Right to Read and Write\n\nPreamble\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nSouth African society has one supreme law that stands over and above all others: the Constitution. It is the body of fundamental principles that outlines the legal foundation for the existence of our republic and states the rights and duties of its citizens and those we elect to govern us. One of those fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution is that ‚ÄúEveryone has the right to a basic education‚Äù (Section 29(1)(a))\n\nIn many senses this particular right is a special right in the Constitution and different from many others since it is ‚Äòimmediately realizable.‚Äô Unlike the other socioeconomic rights in the Constitution ‚Äì such as the rights to housing, to healthcare, to food, water, security, and further education ‚Äì there is no qualification to the right to a basic education. There is nothing that says the state must work towards the ‚Äòprogressive realization‚Äô of the right to a basic education, or that the realization of the right to a basic education is ‚Äòsubject to available resources.‚Äô There are only two socioeconomic rights in the entire Constitution that are not subject to such limitations and progressive realization, and these are: (1) The right to a basic education (Section 29(1)(a)) and (2) Children‚Äôs core socioeconomic rights to ‚Äòbasic nutrition, shelter, basic health care services and social services‚Äô (Section 28(1)(c)) This was not an accident. In their wisdom, the drafters of the Constitution recognized that in addition to other necessary measures of redress, it was only through the systematic prioritization of the next generation that South Africa would be able to transcend the multifaceted and far-reaching consequences of apartheid.\n\nWhen the South African Constitution was being written, it was expressly noted and understood that education would hold a privileged place in the new democratic dispensation. Neither redress nor prosperity would be possible without it. The Constitution‚Äôs mandate to ‚Äòfree the potential of each person‚Äô was contingent on the realization of this right for all who live in the country. As Constitutional Court Justice Bess Nkabinde ruled:\n\n‚Äò‚ÄòThe significance of education, in particular basic education, for individual and societal development in our democratic dispensation in the light of the legacy of apartheid, cannot be overlooked‚Ä¶ [B]asic education is an important socioeconomic right directed, among other things, at promoting and developing a child‚Äòs personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to his or her fullest potential. Basic education also provides a foundation for a child‚Äòs lifetime learning and work opportunities‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Governing Body of the Juma Musjid Primary School v Essay.\n\nWhile the unqualified right to a basic education has not been legally contested, it is still not entirely clear what is (and is not) included when one speaks about a ‚Äòbasic education‚Äô. The Constitution itself does not provide an explication of this right which specifies how it is to be realized and what conditions would need to be met for this right to be said to have been realised or not.\n\nIn 2013 the Minister of Basic Education prescribed the Regulations Relating to Minimum Uniform Norms and Standards for Public School Infrastructure which set out the ‚Äònecessary resources‚Äô that form the minimum core of this right in terms of infrastructure. Subsequent court interpretations of these regulations demonstrate that South Africa now has a set of defined norms for basic physical infrastructure such as running water, electricity, sanitation, and a safe built-environment (Equal Education v Minister of Basic Education 2019 (1) SA 421, ECB), as well as basic educational materials such as one textbook per subject per child (Minister of Basic Education and Others v Basic Education for All and Others [2016] 1 All SA 369, SCA). This has gone some way to make explicit what the State‚Äôs minimum obligations are in the fulfilment of this right, at least in terms of infrastructure and textbooks. To that extent it has begun to explicate or ‚Äòunpack‚Äô the meaning of the right to a basic education by specifying its minimum content.\n\nHowever, what has been lacking in much of this unfolding process is the specification of minimum outcomes that must be met for the right to a basic education to be said to have been realized for an individual. What is the minimum set of knowledge, skills and dispositions that an individual must possess for their right to a basic education to be said to have been realized? Alternatively, are there certain specific measurable ‚Äòcore‚Äô outcomes that, if a child is unable to achieve them, one can say definitively that their right to a basic education (or at least some fundamental component of it) has been denied?\n\nIt is the contention of this background paper that one of these minimum ‚Äòcore‚Äô outcomes with respect to the right to a basic education, is that a child must be able to read and write with understanding at a basic level, in their home language, by the age of ten. Put differently, this fundamental skill is one of the tools by means of which the constitutional promise is to be fulfilled. Unless and until the child is educated to the requisite minimum level, the constitutional promise remains unfulfilled. The purpose of this document is to provide a clearly articulated, evidence-based, and measurable definition of what it means to ‚Äúread and write, with understanding, at a basic level.‚Äù In so doing it aims to operationalize this right by making one additional core component of the right to a basic education explicit. This component would be the ‚ÄúRight to Read and Write.‚Äù Whilst it is clear that the right to a basic education envisaged in the Constitution goes well beyond merely the ability to read and write, it is equally clear that if a child is denied this most basic skill (to read and write with understanding) they have at the same time, also been denied the right to a basic education.\n\nIn the same way that the government, the courts and civil society now have a shared understanding of the physical resources that are necessary for the realization of the right to a basic education (textbooks, toilets, teachers etc.), the intention of this document is to move towards a similarly shared understanding of the content of the right to a basic education with respect to outcomes, and to do so by providing a clearly articulated, defensible, measurable, and research-informed definition of what it means to read and write at a basic level.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nPostscript\n\nThe Constitution of South Africa was, and is, one of the landmark achievements of our young democracy. It sets out the rights and obligations of citizens and those we elect to govern us, as well as charting a course to a non-racial society founded on ‚Äòhuman dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms.‚Äô While the Constitution is clear and unequivocal ‚Äì everyone has the right to a basic education ‚Äì it is the ongoing task of civil society, government, legislature, and the judiciary to explicate what that means. Rights are not self-fulfilling, nor obligations self-evident.\n\nIt has been the aim of this document to put forward a defensible explication of one core component of the right to a basic education, and that is the ‚Äòright to read and write.‚Äô It is our contention here that no child can reach their full potential without being able to read and write for meaning and pleasure. We believe that if that is the case then the onus is on us to find a way to measure this right and whether it has been realized.\n\nBy drawing on a wealth of experience and research we have attempted to put forward an evidence-based argument for what it means to read and write at a basic level. It is the role of the Executive branch of government to decide whether it agrees with the above interpretation of this component of the right to a basic education. And it is the role of the Judiciary to adjudicate whether the Executive‚Äôs actions and interpretations of this right are in keeping with the text, spirit, and ethos of the Constitution.\n\nThe Right to Read and Write:\n\n‚ÄúEvery child in South Africa has the right to read at a basic level, in their home language, by the age of 10. That is to say, they can read and understand a short and simple text and answer 80% of the literal and straight-forward inferential questions they are asked that are based on that text. Approximately 60-80% of these questions should be classified as ‚ÄòVery easy‚Äô or ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô questions.\n\n‚ÄúEvery child has the right to write at a basic level, in their home language, by the age of 10. That is to say that they can express themselves in writing by using a collection of simple and related sentences with correct grammar and punctuation.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs that time of the year again! I‚Äôll be teaching my postgraduate Applied Economics of Education course at Stellenbosch University. The course runs from the 10th of August to the end of October 2021, with in-person lectures from 9:00-11:00 on Tuesdays and in-person STATA pracs from 11:00-13:00. The full syllabus can be found HERE doc. If you have a strong interest in the course and would like to apply to be an auditor please complete the Google Form which is inside the course outline. Every year there are a number of local and international auditors that enrich the course by their participation. Approved auditors can join in-person at Stellenbosch or electronically via Zoom. There are a limited number of spaces for auditors and those with a quantitative and/or postgraduate background will have preference. Note also that all auditors have to do the readings and hand in the weekly reading reflections as your price of entry!
