From the left: the first two roads were for the south, east, and westbound general freight (i.e. freshly sorted) departures, the next two were for north and southbound block-load engines and the next two were for the station and the north block-load yard - those two 23s would have been heading for the north block-load yard.\n\nThe foregoing brings to a close the coverage of the Running Shed. In the introduction we spoke about the difficulty SAR was having to find white crews in compliance with the Government's apartheid inspired 'Job Reservation' policy. By the end of the sixties it was already glaringly obvious that the policy was not only unfair but, more seriously given the country's booming economy, it was unworkable. The number of whites available to work on dirty old steam engines was declining faster than new jobs were being created. There were overseas enthusiasts willing to get their hands dirty but unfortunately for SAR their numbers were insufficient. Aussie enthusiast Tony Marsden was one of them and the following account of his time as a fireman at Bloemfontein paints a graphic picture of the seriousness of the situation.\n\nFIRING STEAM AT BLOEMFONTEIN, 1974 by TONY ‘ASHCAT’ MARSDEN\n\nI had seen an article in the Australian ‘The Enthusiast’ magazine written by South Australian Geoff Smith, who had gone to South Africa in 1971 and fired steam for a short time at Bloemfontein. Often I discussed with my best mate Paul McDonald about going over there to fire. I wrote to a steam author – Dusty Durrant – who was living in SA and he suggested coming over, as there was a severe shortage of firemen because of the long hours and hard work. It was a ‘reserved occupation’ – which meant only whites could be employed. Also the locos were very big for 3’6” gauge and ran long heavy trains. In 1973 we decided to go over and did so in December. Paul quit his job with a bank and I took ‘unofficial leave’ from my teaching diploma studies. Working at Bloemfontein was our aim, as the depot had over 100 locos allocated to it with four radiating lines, all of which saw steam.\n\nOn arrival we stayed with the extremely hospitable Dusty & Christine Durrant at their Springs residence. We were quickly introduced to the steam hauled Nigel services – mostly worked by 24 class. Cab rides were no problem with the friendly crews who all knew Dusty. These rides whetted our appetite to fire even more. At the time New South Welshman Mike Carter [1] was firing at the Springs depot and Englishmen Geoff Hall [2], John Gilberthorpe [3] and Peter Odell [4] were also firing at various depots. Thus we knew it was possible to get firing jobs. Paul and I caught a suburban train into Johannesburg where we fronted SAR Head Office to apply for jobs. The employment clerk immediately told us there were “no positions for non-South African residents.” Without giving names, we said we knew of non-South Africans who were employed as firemen. He denied this and demanded to know their names. We made a quick exit. Shattered, two downcast Aussies returned to Springs. Not even the magnificent ear splitting exhausts of the S class shunting at Germiston could bring us to smile.\n\nWe gave the devastating news to Dusty. He simply said “We are going to meet Charlie Lewis at Bloemfontein this weekend. He will get you jobs! Ahh – have a beer.” This was Dusty’s permanent answer to any abnormal situation. It was a holiday weekend and extra trains were running. Our introduction to mainline steam was an evening on Bosrand bank, just out of Kroonstad on the Bloemfontein line. In a 3 hour period there was a train up the bank every 15 minutes! A mix of single and double headed 23 class on both pass and goods confirmed our decision that this was the line we wanted to work.\n\nNext morning Dusty introduced us to Charlie at Karee Koppie, our phot spot for the morning. We explained our desire to fire. Charlie said, “You guys are mad. Firing full time won’t give you any time to go photting. You need to work as clerks by day and fire at night which will give you time to phot.” We explained that was not our wish and Charlie said he would make arrangements in early January. We arrived in Bloemfontein on our bash just after Christmas. After spending New Year’s Eve and Day photting with Charlie in the George area, Charlie kindly offered us overnight accommodation the night before fronting the employment office on the afternoon of January 3. It was the first of many times we enjoyed the Lewis family hospitality and Melly’s famous pumpkin soup.\n\nNext day we presented ourselves, full of hope, at the employment office. Charlie had given us his railway phone number in case we received a similar welcome a-la-Joburg. Once again, extremely quickly, we were refused jobs. We asked the clerk to use the phone to ring Charlie. He dutifully explained that as we were not railway employees, he could not allow us to use the railway phone. After some delicate negotiations we managed to get him to ring Charlie. There soon followed a series of “Ja Meneer [yes sir], nie meneer [no sir] and jammer Meneer [sorry sir]”. After he put the phone down, the clerk looked at us rather sheepishly and quietly said, “We have jobs for you - if you can pass the OTIS employment test, an interview and a medical tests.” All were easy. We signed contracts and were duly supplied with signed forms to present to the local immigration office in order to get work permits valid for 6 months. This process would take 6 weeks - in which time Paul and I toured the country seeking steam in areas from where it was soon to disappear in favour of diesel or electric traction.\n\nIn early February our work permits had arrived and the SAR employment office gave us a time to report to the depot foreman and authority to stay at the SAR Hostel. We became residents of the President Steyn Railway Hostel – about a kilometre walk to the depot. R40 a month gave a 3 metre by 2 metre room with a single bed, table, chair and wardrobe, all meals at any time of the day or night [including those when on shift] and laundry. It was a fantastic deal for someone whose worldly possessions fitted into one suitcase! We walked to the depot and were welcomed by the foreman, Mr Williams. [5] He was proud of his depot and even more proud of the diesels that worked the south line and that the line to Kroonstad was in the process being prepared for electric traction “which was the way of the future to replace obsolete steam locos.” We bit our tongues….. We were given notices of our first shifts. For the next 3 weeks I was to work as third man on stoker fired 15F 2968 - a local passenger link engine whose regular crew was driver Norman Krause and fireman Hermanus Steyn. Krause was a real grump but Hermanus was a fine fellow, even taking me to his home for a meal. He asked me to help his wife learn English as their young son had to take English lessons at school. She helped me learn some basic ‘loco’ Afrikaans – take water and clean fire. Those words came in very handy in the months to come. Paul went to the 19D link.\n\nOn most railways, one would begin a footplate career as an engine cleaner and progress to shed fireman, then fireman. At Bloemfontein it was ‘whites only’ on locos so there were no positions as engine cleaners. Thus I did 3 weeks as a 3rd man ‘trainee fireman’. My main tasks were to polish the brass, take water and wash out the ashpan at fire-cleaning stations. Hermanus taught me the finer points of stoker firing and fire cleaning. My soft student hands soon blistered and calloused! We worked ‘local’ passenger trains and workshops shunts. The passes were either to Thaba Nchu and Modderpoort on the Bethlehem line or Brandfort on the Kroonstad line. The shunts were Mechanical Hauler or scrap yards at the Mechanical Workshops or Carriage siding. It was thrilling to be able to fire under Hermanus’ watchful eye. I did much more firing than expected and even fired one whole shift on a shunt job. That was thrilling for me as 2968 was a great steamer. I also got to change tablets – more later. My arm got badly burned at the 3-week mark and I was booked off sick for 3 weeks by Dr Elsabe Barnard, sister of the famous heart transplant pioneer Christian Barnard. No way would SAR countenance paying for 3 weeks of no work, so for Paul and me it was 3 weeks of fireman’s college. This meant theory in the classroom learning safeworking rules and loco parts. The day started at 8 AM and finished at 4 PM with 30 minutes for lunch. It was very formal. Dress code was collar and tie and you had to stand beside your desk when answering questions. The classroom was next to the hump yard, so the glorious beats of the two 15Fs on the hump shunt [6] provided pleasant background noise and great vision at lunchtime. For the first few days, our instructor was JJ Boshoff who was normally Germiston based. He was in his 60s and relieving regular instructor Pete Erlank who was on leave. He was a very pleasant gentleman. Pete was also very pleasant but in his forties. He very much enjoyed his two Aussie pupils. This was because he didn’t have to repeat the same thing several times as he had to do for many of the young local lads who ‘were not the sharpest tools in the shed’. He made me Class Captain – quite an honour. With Pete’s permission we played many practical jokes on them which made the classes even more fun. The training notes were of very high quality. I really enjoyed learning the loco parts and their purpose. The classes finished with 3 hours of written exams. After passing them, I did 3 days as third man running 385/386 and 387/388 Zastron goods. This was on hand-fired 19D 2751 - the same loco as Paul - and he went to my 15F.\n\nWe were then considered qualified, so after 19 hours off (most spent photting at Glen with Charlie) on Sunday 17 March at 9 37 PM I signed on for Hump A shunt. What followed were a series of shunt jobs for 14 hours a day, seven days a week for 6 weeks. You then got one day off. Not the greatest of conditions for R1 an hour – which was then the same value as an Aussie dollar. [7] The shunts gave plenty of chance to learn how to fire without a lot of pressure. After a few months, I was paired with a regular driver doing mainline work. Those shifts could be any length but generally 18 hours. I did work two shifts over forty hours!!! The longest was 45 hours 47 minutes and that is a story in itself.\n\nIn the 1970’s Australia (and many other countries) had imposed sanctions on South Africa in an attempt to end Apartheid. South Africa did not have television and the general population relied on Government run radio and newspapers for world news. Very little was known about Australia other than that we had previously played cricket against South Africa and had kangaroos!!! A few times I was asked if I “had a kangaroo in my backyard?” My reply was, “No – do you have a lion in yours?” The underlying humour was mostly lost. Many crews could not understand why we came to South Africa whilst our Government had imposed sanctions on their country. When I took photos of the massive amount of steam spare parts at the workshops – something I’d never seen in Australia – the driver I was working with accused me of being a Communist collecting information for the Australian Government. I explained that Australia was dieselised and photos of steam spares were worthless to our Government. There was also further suspicion of our motives when we told them we could work on diesels in Australia for triple the pay [we earned $1 an hour in SA] and half the hours. They could not understand why we would leave our families and travel 16,500 kilometres and live in a primitive railway hostel to work on ‘dirty’ steam locos for poor wages and harsh conditions when we could have stayed home to work on ‘clean’ diesels with far better working conditions. Logically, their thinking made sense, however it did not consider the emotion that was an extreme passion for steam. That said, most of the crews were fine as Paul & I were ‘novelties’. Afrikaans was the language of the railways and we had to learn it. Bloemfontein was capital of the Orange Free State – total Afrikaner territory with very little English spoken.\n\nAfrikaans was the crew’s first language, with English a poor second, even though they did learn it in a very limited capacity at primary school. Many crews spoke poor English and did not want to work with us because of their lack of confidence. When they worked with us, we tried to speak Afrikaans and they appreciated that – even if they laughed at our attempts. I only ever had two drivers refuse to work with me because I could not speak Afrikaans. That didn’t bother me though as there were many drivers who were good. As the country was officially bi-lingual, they could not legally refuse to work with us. Paul and I both had regular drivers after a few months, as they wanted to work with us because we were interested in firing well. To many firemen it was the only job they could get – as blacks did all the other menial jobs - and they had no interest in doing the work well. There were not many South African railfans, but the few who were there loved that we were steam firemen. There were more overseas railfans than locals. [8] In April, an Australian railfan tour group visited and many of the guys cab-rode with me on a shunt job soon after I had started firing solo. That was a great time for all of us. It was lovely to speak English with someone other than Paul!! No disrespect to him though! Later on, both Warren Doubleday and the late George Bambery cabrode with me on the mainline to Kroonstad on separate occasions. They both loved it, as Australia never had so much big size steam on any gauge, let alone 3’6”.\n\nMy first shift was on Hump A shunt – ‘Boggel A rangeer’ in Afrikaans. Stoker fired 15F 3128 was the loco with driver Wally Sweeney who was absolutely fantastic. Wally explained he didn’t speak a great deal of English. I explained I didn’t speak a great deal of Afrikaans!! He would speak English then speak the same words in Afrikaans so that is how I learned basic loco Afrikaans! Wally brought home-made hot dogs to eat even though the hostel had supplied me food. The cab brass work was supershine and I enjoyed keeping it that way. There was great pride in having a clean cab even on a lowly shunt job. Visiting USA railfan Rob Allingham was at the depot that afternoon - he took my photo lighting a buffer beam paraffin lamp. He kindly sent me that shot which I treasure. He later fired at Springs for a short time. Our job was to push 2000 ton loads up the hump. They were loads made up of incoming trains and we pushed up at about 5 mph as the wagons went over the hump. This happened 24 hours a day, everyday of the week with two locos which showed the huge volume of traffic once moved by rail. Compare that with today. The hump is gone and the majority of freight goes by road.\n\nOf course our limited knowledge of Afrikaans opened up many opportunities for the locals to set up the ‘uitlanders’ [= foreigners] when in the sign on room with plenty of onlookers. Some examples were: You must not call your driver Johann but call him ‘oupa’. When asked “Why?” the answer was always “just do it.” Quickly, I would look up my Afrikaans/English dictionary to find that Oupa meant ‘grandpa’. Johann was only 30 but had shiny grey hair – hence oupa or grandpa. And “he is called ‘Rondom Lelik’ [= all round ugly]”. Not something to say to a senior driver. Naturally there was much disappointment when I wouldn’t take the bait. However there were times when I’d ask the recipient to play along, saying “Willem has asked me to say ‘xxx’” and they would do so. I asked Big Dave ‘couplers’ Smith (he had hands the size of auto couplers) to “soen my lank and soen my lekker” [= ‘kiss me long and kiss me nicely’]. Dave immediately went to hug me but instead turned to Willem and planted a kiss on his cheek. Much hilarity from the room as the joker became the joke. It was a lot of fun and we gained respect for being part of it.\n\nMy daily routine depended on the type of job. On some shunts, you just relieved a fireman on a loco already in the yards so there was no preparation. On other shunts and all mainline work one had to prepare a loco. The allowance was 45 minutes for tasks which took 1 hour 45 – so you worked an hour unpaid! After signing on – an hour before your driver – you got his keys and walked around the 12 road shed to find your loco. There were 80-plus locos on shed and there was no record with the roster clerk where each loco was placed. This could take 15 minutes – even more reason to sign on early. All the locos were in low steam and had banked fires which were ‘maintained’ by black labourers. The states of the fires varied markedly but steam pressure was always about 100 pounds with full pressure being between 180 and 225 pounds. I would then check the boiler water level by testing both water gauges. If it was a stoker fired loco I would increase the blower pressure and put on a fire after checking the jet settings – which distributed the coal over the firebox. This would help increase steam pressure. If it was your regular loco, the kit, oilcans and fire irons would be locked on the loco. If it was a ‘pool’ loco – not allocated to a driver - then you had to go to the kit store to get the kit. This was often 200 metres away from the loco and a black labourer would help wheel it in a dilapidated wheelbarrow to the loco. This was generally over unpaved ground that was a muddy mess if it had rained. You would also get your allocation of lubricating oils and grease. If it was a ‘pool’ hand-fired loco you could not put on a fire as the shovel was with the loco kit in the store. Once you had the kit, you would open all the steam valves for the ancillaries (brakes, turbo generator, stoker jets and stoker motor, injectors etc). After creating vacuum for the brakes, if the loco didn’t have a steam brake, I would release the handbrake. Next, I would move the loco to ‘spot’ it under the water column. With handbrake re-applied, I would then climb on the tender top and open the water column valve so water would slowly flow into the tender tank. You ran it slowly so you could then clean the fire at the same time. You would put the oilcans and grease guns near the boiler to warm them up for the driver. After steam pressure was near full you would put on an injector to fill the boiler with water. This would lower steam pressure which you would build up again. Whilst this was happening you would boil the billy in the firebox so the driver could have a cup of coffee when he arrived. If there wasn’t coffee the driver would not be happy and that would mean a hard day...... Then I would clean the fire. You would need some boiler water to flush the ashpan. With the fire cleaned you would hose out the ashpan and fill the boiler at the same time as filling the hydrostatic lubricator with oil – if the loco had one. Next job was to clean the cab roof inside and clean the boiler cladding in the cab. If this was not done it would mean another reason for an unhappy driver and you would pay the price. By this time the driver would have signed on. He would have a quick coffee and begin oiling and greasing the motion gear. Next I would finish filling the tender water. I would then wash the cab floor with the cab hose – which used water from the boiler. After the driver had oiled up, the windows would be washed and a bucket of clean hot water filled so you could both clean up before heading out to the yard to either shunt or attach to your train if it was a goods or to the station if you were to work a passenger train. Once shunting or running a train it was a matter of keeping the fire stoked to keep high steam pressure and adequate water in the boiler. [9]\n\nAt certain times you would clean fire and take water. On most shunts the fire would be cleaned every three hours. This was good because if you messed up, it wasn’t long before you could rectify the mistakes. It was great practice for the main line. If you are wondering how you could mess up a fire on a shunt job, the coal was terrible because of its high clinker content and variable grades. [10] The locos on the shunts worked very hard – very similar to be on a mainline turn. You could set the stoker jets correctly to get an even fire and all would be good – then the grade of coal would change because the 14 ton bunkers would not get the one grade of coal. Suddenly the grey haze you were keeping at the stack would become thick black clag. The coal would be piled on the throat plate at the front of the firebox which meant the loco would stop steaming well. Jets would have to be re-set. If you had a good driver he would work the loco even harder to chew the coal away from the front. The grates ranged from 36 to 63 sq ft. For mainline work, on a passenger train you were only allowed 11 minutes and 15 on a goods to clean fire– not easy so you really had to know your stuff. The shunts were the place to learn that. On the mainline you generally only cleaned fire and took water once before reaching your destination usually a distance of 90 kilometres. On hand fired locos it was more often after about 45 kilometres.\n\nI worked a variety of shunt jobs with many drivers, most of whom were good blokes. Hump A & Hump B, the west & north yards, carriage siding and coach siding were stoker fired 15Fs. Mechanical Hauler 1 & 2 (workshops), Scrap 1 and 2, Wagon 1 and 2 and Sidings were 12 class. The coal stage shunt was a 19D [10] and PNT sidings [wagon repairs] was a 19D or 24. Goods 1 and 2 were 23 class jobs and were day and night shifts. We travelled in the loco depot Kombi call van to get to the goods shed area which was about 2 km away from the departure yard. The work involved making up trains of 1500 tons and then taking them to the departure yard on a 2km trip. This was as close as one could get to mainline work on a shunt job and it was my favourite job [11].\n\nAnother job I particularly liked was called ‘Shops’ – a loco test job at the workshops . I worked it four times – twice two days in a row. Alas the first two days were non-events. 12A 1539 failed twice during the prep so no main line run. It was a 6:45 AM sign on, walk a km to the mechanical workshops and oil up a loco which had just had a major overhaul - replacement boiler, motion, tyres and ancillaries. Workshops staff lit up the fire. The loco would then run light loco to Van Tonder – 14 km on the north mainline to Kroonstad. The driver was always a loco inspector. A workshops foreman fitter rode in the cab and a fitter with his fitter’s mate rode on the front buffer beam beside the smokebox with ropes as safety belts because test speed had to be fast to ensure nothing ran hot. Certainly I was glad I wasn’t a fitter. The locos were both 15Fs 3138 and 2929 – neither had a brick arch fitted at that stage. After returning from Van Tonder, the fire was dropped and any repairs would be done in subsequent days and the brick arch put in. For me it was a walk back to the depot and sign off. One shift was 9½ hours and the other 11½.\n\nEarly on I was paired with Phillip Hibbers who was a hard task master. His opening remarks were “I am happy to speak English but no fireman lasts more than 3 days with me – my kit must be kept shining and firemen don’t like that.” I replied that it looked ‘mooi’ [beautiful] and I was more than happy to keep his kit shining. He thought I was being sarcastic and said, “You won’t last long.” After a week, Phil got the idea that I was indeed happy to keep his kit clean and we got along famously. When he saw me writing in a notebook he asked “Why?” My reply was I kept note of the stoker jet settings for each loco. Of course they varied with the coal but were a good starting point. Phil decided I was worth nurturing and began to give me a great many ways to set jets. He’d also show me how to do repairs in the run. Phil was a superb teacher and mentor. He also helped me learn to speak Afrikaans. Alas after two months he told me he was leaving SAR to work on diesels at a mine in Newcastle. Shorter shift hours, cleaner working conditions and better pay were the reasons. Phil’s parting words were, “it won’t be long til you are on the mainline” and I was very sorry to see him go. He was correct, as I was soon paired with mainline driver Ben Steyn. I had worked four shifts with Ben in early April doing mainline hauler jobs and we got on famously. After these shifts he said he would ask for me to be his regular mate. That took another while – more later.\n\nBefore I was permanently paired with Ben, I worked several noteworthy shunt shifts. After signing off at 6PM on a day shift, the roster clerk informed that I was being swapped from day shift to night shift, supposedly giving me a very welcome 24 hour break. I was having a very sound sleep when the call boy bashed on my door at 7:40 AM. “You are going to day relief at Modderpoort which was on the Bethlehem line and junction for the 10km long Ladybrand branch. It was an 8AM sign on and I would be picked up by the loco kombi call van in twenty minutes. Very quickly the kitchen staff packed my food and I was being chauffeured to loco. I was to travel ‘spare’ as a first class passenger to Modderpoort on train 71, the 9 AM Durban pass. After reporting to the Station Foreman it was shunt the yard, run 497/498 Ladybrand Mixeds, shunt and stable then return on 82 pass ex Durban to sign off about 5AM next day – a 22 hour shift. After signing on, I was told to find 25NC 3420 - the loco for 71 Pass - and ride with the crew to the station. I’d met Driver Greef a month earlier whilst motorcading the Bethlehem line. He greeted me with a big smile and friendly handshake. His fireman Willem gave me a cup of coffee – superb hospitality. They invited me to ride the cab all the way to Modderpoort. Knowing the length of the shift ahead, I asked if I could ride from Tweespruit which was the first water-stop, as I wanted to get some sleep. That was fine with them and I presented my travel voucher to the conductor who ushered me into a compartment that I had to myself. The beat of the NC lulled me to sleep. It was a 2-hour run.\n\nThen I had the pleasure of 90 minutes in the cab of the gently swaying NC hauling 15 cars for 450 ton. The NCs had only recently replaced 15Fs and the crew described their new steed as magnificent. Eight years later, I was able to find this out first hand when I fired at Beaconsfield depot Kimberley. 3420 exhibited raw power and rode very smoothly because of the four- wheel bogie truck under the cab. At Modderpoort I bade them farewell and reported to the Station Foreman around 12:45PM. He gave me a key to a crew rest room so I could change into my working clothes. Soon I was on 19D 2626 with driver L J Botha “only 2 years to pension [retirement]” and very proud of his 25-year accident free medal – not easily earned on SAR. He was a very affable chap and explained what the shift entailed. We were to make up number 497 Ladybrand mixed then clean fire before the 4 40PM departure. Our load was to be 435 tons which included two passenger cars – one for whites [empty] and one for ‘non-whites’ [overfull]. We began shunting and no matter how much I shovelled, the steam gauge stayed glued to 150 pounds – well short of the 200 pounds possible. Noting my concern, LJ said, “Don’t worry – it’s faulty. Give it a whack with the hammer.” This I did and suddenly had 195 pounds!! We whistled out on time and 2626 steamed well as we tackled the four kilometres of 1 in 40 grade. There was plenty of water as we topped the grade for the 6 km drift to Ladybrand where we arrived at 5 PM. Whilst there was a triangle to turn the loco, LJ explained there was not enough time to do that and make up the train – no need to take water or clean my fire which wasn’t too bad apart from a lump in the centre of the box. “No problem,” said LJ. “Just fire around it on the way back.” 498 was a 5:40 PM departure and the consist was 12 goods wagons and 2 passenger cars supposedly 387 tons. As I filled our water bottle from the platform tap, two young ladies gave me a cheerful greeting. LJ told me they were “2 of the Modderpoort Station Foreman’s 5 daughters” – all ‘good sports!!’. They had been in ‘town’ for an afternoon of shopping. He suggested I should extend my day relief to several!! The Foreman will arrange food for you! …. Tempting, but ‘No’ in such a small place. It was almost dusk as we got a green light from the guard. We departed on time with a full head of steam and full glass water – necessary when running tender first for 6 km of 1 in 40. Again 2626 steamed well and slogged steadily upgrade and a bit too slowly for my likings. Twenty minutes later we were back in Modderpoort. LJ kindly complemented my firing effort advising we were 20 ton over the full goods load for funnel first! That made me smile. After cleaning fire and taking water we shunted the train and yard. At 11:30PM I banked the fire and stabled the loco. LJ was very persuasive in trying to get me to stay but I said, “No,” advised the Station Foreman of my decision and retired to the very cold rest room to grab an hour’s kip before 82 Pass arrived. Again I travelled as a first class passenger. My solo compartment was 7 cars back from 3406 and I even had bedding!!! The bark of the NC upgrade soon had me asleep. A heavenly way to end a shift. We arrived at Bloemfontein on time at 4 20 AM and I rode 3406 to the depot and signed off at 5 AM giving a 21 hour shift. I also earned R3.28 in expenses. Bonus!!!\n\nMy next mainline shift was an accident. I was trying to get some Sunday time to increase my pay because Sundays were paid at time and half. The rest of the week was normal time and overtime rates began after 396 hours a month. I saw a vacancy on the 5 10PM carriage siding shunt. The loco was 15F 2968 with driver Norman Krause. His regular fireman Hermanus Steyn was doing driver-training theory at Essellen Park Training Centre near Johannesburg, so a replacement fireman was needed. Not much could go wrong on a shunt job I’d done before and on a loco I knew – or so I thought. Eight hours with grumpy old Norman couldn’t be too hard … How wrong I was!! After shunting, the job turned into 501, the 00:50 AM Thaba Nchu Pass, returning on 502 Pass. I’d done this shift when a trainee, however had totally forgotten it turned into a mainline run.\n\nAfter signing on (early of course), I prepared the loco. Being a regular-crew loco there was no need to get the kit from the store which saved much time. The oils and grease were all warming on the hob. The fire was clean, ashpan cleaned and water taken and a coffee ready for Norman on his arrival. He was not happy. “I don’t like working with an ‘Engelsman’ [Englishman]. You know we go to Thaba Nchu after the shunt?” My answer was a nod and I lied “Ja” [yes]. Excitement was mixed with apprehension. Certainly I’d done 3 months of firing, mainly stokers on the shunt, and felt I could handle it. Having been on 2968 during training and knowing how it steamed well gave me extra hope to be confident of doing a good job. After Norman had completed his prep, I went to the store to get our allocation of oils, grease, paraffin and cotton waste. After another coffee we departed loco and spent 3 hours shunting. The stoker jets were set to the same as Hermanus had them. There was not much conversation as it wasn’t necessary. After the shunting, we returned to the depot to take water and clean fire. Then it was back to the carriage siding to pick up a car consist we had made up earlier and shunt to the platform.\n\nWe departed on time. The Bethlehem line was token territory and Norman advised that he would be doing all the exchanges because it was mostly a non-stop run. That suited me fine as I had never exchanged a token at night, let alone at the speed of 50 kmph - which we would be doing. All went well and I called the signal aspects, in Afrikaans, as soon as I saw them as we approached stations. 2968 was steaming very well and the fire was the wedge shape it needed to be. The exhaust was the ‘grey haze’ which was the way to fire stoker equipped locos. There was no need for black clag whatsoever. The front of the firebox throat plate was clear of fire – which it needed to be for good steaming. If coal landed there, the loco would steam poorly. We steamed upgrade from Sannaspos with plenty of steam and water. It was very enjoyable as the loco exhaust was cracking and pleasant music to my ears in the cold, still night air. As we passed Sepane at 50 kmph, Norman failed to collect the tablet. He shut off and made an emergency brake application. The safeties lifted, so on with an injector. We stopped about 300 metres from the platform and I expected we would set back to collect the token. No way… Norman barked for me to go and get it. With torch in hand, I made my way back in the limited footway. The Station Foreman asked why we hadn’t set back? My reply was that Norman was not happy to be working with someone whose native language was not Afrikaans. The SF expressed his sorrow and wished me good luck – in English. All was quiet by the time I returned which took about 8 minutes. All Norman said was, “maak vinnig” – move faster. The injector was still going and water was well out of sight at the top of the glass. The fire was mostly grey as normally happens on stoker fired locos when no coal has been added. We took off straight away at a fast pace. I turned off the injector, opened the blow down to reduce the water level to avoid priming and put on a fire. Norman yelled to shut the blowdown. The grey haze at the funnel had become a black splodge. A quick look in the firebox showed coal on the throatplate. A check of the jet settings revealed they had been changed. Norman’s way of making life hard. I quickly re-set them and as Thaba Nchu was not far away, the fire could be cleaned so the throat plate build-up didn’t bother me too much. It was no use saying anything to Norm, as it would only make a difficult situation worse. If this was what being paired with him was like, I preferred the shunts!!\n\nAt Thaba Nchu, it was turn on the triangle, clean fire, take water and have 2 hours sleep. With the jets re-set and clean fire 2968 again steamed well on train 502, which stopped all stations. That allowed me to do all the token exchanges as our speed was slow. None were dropped!!! No chance for Norm to make mischief… We kept the timetable easily, arriving at Bloemfontein East 5 minutes early. It was a good run and I was happy with my efforts. After an on-time arrival in Bloemfontein the guard came forward and gave us the running sheet and complimented us on a ‘right time’ run. Then we cut off and ran to the depot, leaving the loco on the arrival roads near the coal stage. As 2968 was a link loco, it was lock the fire irons and tender lockers then sign off. The roster clerk, Young Willie, asked how I went? “Good” was my reply, also letting him know of Norm’s tricks. He then said that Norm had complained that “I didn’t know my job and that we were late arriving home and he didn’t want to work with me again.” Willie had checked our running sheet to find that we had in fact arrived on time and that Krause wanted an excuse to get rid of me. Being late on a passenger train was a great reason to dump a fireman. Willie then asked, “We know he doesn’t like to work with one not fluent in Afrikaans, however would you like to do the week with Krause on Thaba Nchu passenger trains?” “If he doesn’t want to work with me, then how can you roster me?” was my question. Willie said they were desperately short of firemen and they knew I was capable, so Krause would be over-ruled. Reluctantly I declined, as despite the great time had, the antagonism and unpleasant cab atmosphere sure took the shine off the run - all because Krause did not want to speak English.\n\nOn the Bethlehem, Aliwal North and Kimberley lines the Van Schoor system of safeworking was in place. This meant exchanging tokens – usually on the run from speeds between 20 and 50 kmph. There was quite an art to doing this. The Station Foreman would stand on a metre high raised platform and hold the token which was on a rubber covered steel hoop high in the air. As you neared him, you would throw the outgoing authority onto the platform then hold your arm parallel to the cab side and collect the incoming authority. Sometimes the buck and sway would mean a set of skun knuckles or dropped token. Neither were pleasant. I soon learned to wear a leather glove!!!\n\nBack to Ben Steyn. He was a fantastic guy and wanted to work with me to improve his English to help his son at high school. No Afrikaans lessons any more! Apart from being a consummate engineman, Ben was a prolific chef and used soleplates heated in the firebox to place on the steel cab floor. Pots would be placed on them with ingredients to cook a multitude of meals. Along with wors cooked on the loco, stews, pasta, melie pap along with tomatoes and onion sauce were some of his culinary delights.\n\nAlthough not a regular pass link driver, we worked passenger trains with 23 class to Kroonstad, Springfontein and Ladybrand often on locos whose regular crew was on leave so we had some beautifully well-cared for locos. We worked goods trains to Kroonstad, Allenridge and Kimberley with loads up to 1300 tons, again on 23 class. Aliwal North trains were on 19Ds with up to 600 tons . We had two ‘special’ jobs which I found very interesting. One was to deliver a 15F 3088 on hire to a mine at Lorraine near Welkom which meant running on the main line towards Kroonstad. It was a 6:50 AM sign on. Loco inspector Tom Van Zyl accompanied us with the paperwork. The cost to the mine was R500 a day. Once common to see 15F on that line, by mid 1974 it was rare. The highlight of the trip was to double head with a Kroonstad 23 3290 on 1619 Goods from Hennenman to Welkom. Here we loaded our kit onto the tender tray of 3290 and travelled home ‘spaar’ [=spare] by first catching 1618 Pass to Kroonstad at 1850. At Kroonstad depot we put our kit on to 23 class 3228, the loco for 333 Pass to Bloemfontein departing at 1 45 AM. First class with beds on an overnight passenger train hauled by a 23 class. Heaven!! - being paid to listen to that stack talk from a comfortable bed. There was also the chance to watch the fire glowing on the exhaust which I have absolutely loved ever since watching steam at night when I was young kid. We rode 3228 to the depot, unloaded our kit and signed off at 8:00 AM giving a 25 hour 10 minute shift.\n\nAnother job was to take a light loco 12AR 215 fresh from shops to Kimberley on 2233 Special Goods. We signed on at 9 50 AM and ran to Beaconsfield depot at Kimberley. I’d fired plenty of 12ARs on many shunts. They had a 42 sq ft firebox. Running light wasn’t too taxing. After stabling the loco, I loaded the kit onto the Bloemfontein 23 class which was to run 92 Pass from Kimberley. It was another travel home first class ‘spare’ by passenger job. Even so, we cabrode for two sections and I fired while the fireman chatted with Ben and his driver.\n\nRugby had a huge sporting interest – especially for the local team ‘The Bloemfontein Blues.’ Many crews had played rugby in their youth and they were very big, strong boys. Lots of crews always tried to have Saturday afternoon off - Ben was one of those. We signed on at noon one Friday to run 2150 Allenridge goods. Allenridge was in the middle of grain & mielie producing area and block trains ran there twice a day. You could do a round trip or book off. This time we booked off which meant after the 12.5 hour journey we could have rest up to 8 hours. Ben chose 6, which would mean a train departing around 8 AM Saturday morning. This gave a great chance to be home by game time. The load was around 1330 tons which loco 3267 handled perfectly. It was my favourite loco as it always steamed superbly. We headed off and ran at a cracking pace to join the main line at Hennenman. Fire cleaning would then be done at Vetrivier where water would be taken. Cleaning fire on the run was strictly forbidden but Ben did not want to take too long as we could be put behind the Orange Express and he would miss the rugby. As we passed through Theunissen Ben said, “Get ready to clean fire on the downhill run into Vetrivier.” Not one to disobey orders, as we began to drift, I prepared the fire irons. The 23 class had 63 square foot grates which were hand shaken. All other classes had steam shaker grates. I could never figure out why the biggest grate area never had steam shakers. I shook the grates until the clinker had broken and I could flip them. Ben had got an extra 12” added to his rake iron, so it only took 5 strokes to clean the throat plate instead of about 30! All the rubbish ash was ready over the dump grate. I turned on the ashpan flushers, opened the ashpan slides and then the dump grate. I could hear the ash dropping into the pan and hoped that most had dropped out with no lumps stuck. After closing the slides, I turned the flushers off then boiled the billy for coffee by holding a can of water in the firebox with the jet cleaning hookie short fire iron. All we had to do at Vetrivier was take water and go. That would only take 5 minutes. Ben said he would take water whilst I washed the two sides of the ashpan. As we approached the platform, I noticed a man in a khaki coat near the water column. “Hell Ben – there’s a loco inspector here – we’re in the shit.” “No WE aren’t – YOU are!!!” Ben said jokingly. He came over to my side and began laughing. “What’s so funny?” I asked. “We are in trouble.”\n\n“No, no, no. It’s Oom Tom,” said Ben. \"He was my regular driver for years. He came with us to Welkom. You know him – he likes you. He wants to get back for the rugby too!” As we stopped Oom Tom gave a big wave and called out “Hello Aussie. Tell Ben I’ve squared us to run ahead of the Orange. Let’s get going. I’ll make the coffee.” He climbed into the cab and did just that whilst I washed the ashpan and Ben took water. Within 5 minutes we were away and barking up grade at a cracking pace. With 400 more ton load than the Orange, we beat the Express times thanks to the superb 3267 – a magnificent loco. After leaving the load in the arrivals yard, we had the fastest run ever to the depot. Ben stopped near the car garages at the road entrance to loco. He and Oom Tom got off and left me to take the loco to the arrivals track near the coal stage. After taking the kit to the store, I made a fast entrance to the roster room and signed us both off and made a faster exit. What a fantastic run – all thanks to the love of rugby.\n\nHostel life was just shower, eat and sleep. There was a social room but there was no spare time to use it. Evening meals were: Sunday - roast lamb; Monday – forequarter lamb chops; Tuesday – mid loin lamb chops; Wednesday – curried lamb; Thursday – Chicken in some form; Friday – fish and chips; Saturday wors and pap. Food for trips varied on the length of shift but it always included leftovers from the previous evening placed in an aluminium pannikin which would be placed somewhere on the boiler to heat up. Often there would be a small piece of raw wors which would be cooked on the shovel. There would be one honey and one jam sandwich and a boiled egg. Containers for tea, coffee and powdered milk were always filled. The kitchen boys were a happy lot. Each week I’d give those I saw a 10 cent piece. This always assured me getting an extra sandwich or bigger piece of Wors. Getting to loco by public roads was a 1.5 km hike. Luckily someone had cut a hole in the back fence which gave easy access to the loco flyover which made the distance about a km.\n\nOn an average hand-fired loco on a shunt you would shovel about 10 ton of coal. On the Aliwal North run that would increase to 12. A 23 class would use about 14 ton on a run to Kroonstad , Kimberley or Allenridge. The tenders had slides which would be pulled forward as coal was used. The big 18 ton bunkers would hold various grades of coal so you always had to be watching the fire all the time. It was not all sit down and turn valves. Jets would generally be blown at 50 lbs with the stoker motor turning slowly. The theory was that a great percentage of the coal would burn in suspension. I well remember after a rough trip to Vetrivier I could not wait to clean fire to make things right. After pulling a slide we headed up hill with a lovely grey haze suddenly at the funnel. Suddenly it turned black. The coal was lighter and on the tube plate. In frustration I began to cry … Ben put a fatherly arm around me and said, “You take this firing far too seriously. Relax. I’ll fix it for you. He increased the cut off for a short while and the exhaust bark was incredible. He then took his wide rake fire iron and cleaned the throat plate. After cutting the jet pressure back all was good. He was fabulous to work with and yes I did take firing a bit too seriously.\n\nWorking at Bloem was a brilliant time and a life-changing experience. There are many more stories to tell however, alas, not enough room in one SOAR chapter for them. To the average railfan the fireman’s job is a glamour one. However it was bloody hard work mainly because of the poor quality coal. That said, I gained a huge amount of experience in a relatively short period. If Australia had still been using steam, it would have taken me three times as long to get the hours I did. My SAR experience has been invaluable to my volunteer work as a fireman and driver on Tourist railways in my home state of Victoria. Amazingly, forty-seven years late I now drive and fire a 24 class on the Q train which is a superb restaurant train running on the Bellarine railway at Queenscliff. [12] If you had told me that when I left Bloemfontein I would have said, “You have to be dreaming!” My association with SAR was renewed in 1982 when, again thanks to Charlie, I fired at Beaconsfield depot, Kimberley. However that is a whole chapter in itself.\n\nFinally a few comments on loco classes. The 15F’s were solid workhorses on shunts and the first locos I ever worked on and I have a soft spot for them. The 24 class were fine to fire as were the very powerful 12 class. My times on 19Ds were not great as most were due for shops and not in good nick, however it was possible to see how capable they were. The 24 class were a top loco – free steamers with a great turn of speed. The 23 class were superb on the mainline but there was a real art to firing them correctly. They needed a spot on fire. It was often said that ‘if you could fire a 23 class properly, then you could fire any class of loco’. I believe that is very true. I hope you have learned a little of what life was like as a fireman at Bloemfontein just before steam finished. Apart from the time on the footplate which was mostly superb, it was ably matched and exceeded by the hospitality of Melly, Charlie, Justin and Jessica Lewis to whom I give eternal thanks for making life bearable and being my second family. I must also pay tribute to Mike Carter, Geoff Hall, the late John Gilberthorpe, Peter Odell and Allan Johnstone who all had the guts to stick out the crap conditions to reach driving grade. Guys I salute you!\n\nThe following footnotes to Tony's wonderful account of life as a BFX fireman are by Charlie, please don't blame its author.\n\n[1] Mike is alive and well and now lives in Somerset West, near Cape Town\n\n[2] Geoff now lives in George, at the foot of what used to be Montagu Pass\n\n[3] Sadly we lost John, one of the best enginemen I was privileged to know, in 2018\n\n[4] Peter, founder and force behind 'Steamnet 2000'* now lives in Kamfersdam, just north of Kimberley\n\n[5] Williams was Gert Coetzee's successor at Bloemfontein. He was not a sentimental railwayman\n\n[6] This bears out that the S1s were retired late '73 or early '74\n\n[7] It now costs a Saffa R11 to buy an Aussie dollar\n\n[8] Our reporter got a bit carried away here.....\n\n[9] \"a fireman's life is awful hard\", said Alice\n\n[10] Until the early 1960s SAR used washed low-ash, high fusion coal (i.e. ash <10%; fusion > 1350°C). It was permitted to clean fires on the run on designated lengths of track.\n\n[11] This was the run that came right past my office (see picture 3)\n\n[12] Check Tony at the regulator of Ian Welch's 24cl 3620 here: https://youtu.be/vfovObqnGEI\n\nTHE END OF THE SHED\n\nThe final word from John Middleton on Bloemfontein's Running Shed - once upon a time it attracted enthusiasts from all over the world:\n\nThe shunts in Bloemfontein started going diesel from 23rd March 1988 when 6 duties changed over, further turns went over from 6th June leaving steam just working the Hamilton Yard shunt, the Mechanical Shops Hauler, Carriage Sidings shunt and the loco shed pilot. Bloemfontein shed closed to steam on 4th September 1988, the last loco on shed that day at 6 am being 25NC 3518. The shed did continue to see steam as locomotives arriving on workings from Kimberley continued to be serviced for a couple more years after that.\n\nMy eyes are moist."
