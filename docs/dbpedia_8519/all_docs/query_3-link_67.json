        "text": "My thanks are due to my friends listed above for their photos and text as well as to Bruno Martin for his beautiful map and John Middleton for additional photo material.\n\nThe “Witbank Line” generally referred to the very important rail link between the coal mines near Witbank and the Reef at Germiston.\n\nAlthough there was a local passenger service on the line from Johannesburg to Witbank, it was essentially a line to carry heavy coal trains bringing the “Black Diamonds” not only to the Witwatersrand Complex but also to destinations much further afield.\n\nCoal was needed by the SAR for their Steam Loco Depots all over the Country. This fossel fuel was also needed for coal-fired power stations all over the Country.\n\nThis resulted in an intensive service of coal trains running between the collieries in the greater Witbank area to the Reef and beyond.\n\nIt is not my intention to detail a history of SAR freight locomotives here but a brief synopsis would not be out of place.\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, the Central South African Railways employed massive Mallet locomotives to haul these heavy coal trains and this practice was continued by the SAR after 1910, culminating in the use of the very large class MH Mallets designed by Mr D A Hendrie – the SAR’s first Chief Mechanical Engineer.\n\nThese early years also saw the introduction of the classes 12 and 12A 4-8-2s for this heavy duty work. They worked alongside the Mallets for several years.\n\nCol F R Collins who had succeeded Hendrie, introduced a new locomotive type specifically for the Witbank line in 1927 that was known as the “Henschel Giant” – a 2-10-2 of pretty big proportions for the 3ft 6in gauge. Two of the “Giants” were built and were classified class 18. With more than 90 tons adhesion weight the class 18 ought to have been the ideal machine for coal-line service but it was not to be, for reasons outlined below.\n\nThere is a photograph in an issue of the SAR & H Magazine in 1930 which shows one of these class 18s hauling a test load of 20 Baldwin-built 70 ton coal hoppers on this line. The caption claims that this constituted a world record for a coal train hauled by a single locomotive on the 3ft 6in gauge at that time!\n\nUnfortunately, such early photographs have disappeared from the SAR Photographic Archive but I felt that a few photos of these locos from my private collection might not be out of place but first – an article on motive power by Peter Stow (I remind you that SAR generally gave tractive effort figures at 75% boiler pressure):\n\nLOCOMOTIVES USED ON THE GERMISTON –WITBANK SECTION\n\nBy Peter A. Stow\n\nOver and above my passion for railway carriages I have always been fascinated by the operating history of our locomotives. This includes their performance and the Systems or lines to which new locomotives were allocated and the redistribution of existing locomotives as new ones were placed in service or as lines were electrified or dieselized. This was always planned in the finest detail and from an early stage in the history of the SAR the advantage of concentrating as many of the same class at a particular depot or System was appreciated. Later, consideration was even given to keeping those of a class built by the same manufacturer together. Sometimes these plans were deviated from as traffic demands and circumstances changed but that is the nature of a plan. Proof of the implementation of a plan would be the dates that actual locomotives were transferred as planned.\n\nThe above also gives context to the pictures taken of trains over the various sections and why certain classes of locomotives were used from time to time.\n\nIt is not possible to cover all aspects of a line's operating history but where information is available it is highlighted so that even if we just get glimpses from the past, at least the effort is worthwhile.\n\n1. SAR No 935, class 11, photographed at Klerksdorp in the late sixties. When introduced in 1904 this CSAR machine, together with the passenger version designed by P A Hyde, CME of the CSAR, were right up with contemporary locomotive practice. 36 strong, the class survived intact for more than sixty years. When SAR had no further use for them after 1974 many were sold into industrial service, some reaching almost 100 years (two had been sold to ISCOR in the 1950s for industrial service and also survived into the 1970s). Peter and Charlie chased a pair of these hauling a freight from Noupoort to Bloemfontein on their delivery run to President Steyn Gold Mine in 1974. For mile after mile the 70 year-old veterans belied their age by cruising along at more than 60mph.\n\nThe CSAR used what was to become the SAR 2-8-2 class 11 on the Witbank line, later hauling loads of 900 tons instead 1,050 in order to reduce running times and then, in March 1910 placed in service a 2-6-6-2 Mallet for test purposes. This locomotive, which became SAR class MD No 1617, was not an outstanding success [mainly because it was not superheated] but nevertheless lasted until 1926.\n\nThe Witbank line was of such significant strategic importance that as new, more powerful locomotives were placed in service, these often started life on this line. This was particularly true during Chief Mechanical Engineer Mr. D.A. Hendrie’s term of office from just after Union in July 1910 to 1922, as will be seen below.\n\nAn extract from the General Manager’s Report for the year ending 31 December 1910 makes interesting reading:\n\n“The rolling stock programme now in hand provides for forty-six additional locomotives, some of which are already under order, while the remainder will be ordered shortly. The new stock will include sixteen engines of the 'Mallet' type.\n\nFor some years past the coal traffic between Witbank and Germiston has been worked by eleventh class engines running the double trip, i.e.80 miles in each direction. These engines have a tractive effort of 34,600 lb., and were given a load of 900 tons, instead of 1,050, in order to enable them to make quicker times. The increase in traffic between Witbank and Germiston, and the consequent congestion, caused considerable detention en-route, and imposed excessive hours of duty on the trainmen. The eleventh class engines are therefore being replaced by engines of the Mallet type of 48,100 lb. tractive effort, and the trainmen work the single trip of 80 miles only. Eleven of these engines are now at work, and it was found possible to haul loads of 1,600 tons gross regularly from Witbank to Germiston, at an average speed of 9 to 10 miles an hour. The ruling grade is 1 in 100, and in four places there are lengths of 3 to 5 miles of continuous up-grade. The loads hauled probably constitute a record for the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. With the introduction of mechanical stokers – and trials have proved the practicality of such a contrivance – there is no apparent reason why still more powerful engines should not be employed and considerably greater loads hauled. Even with the present engines, improvements in speed and in the general handling of the loads of 1,600 tons are taking place, and a test train of 1,800 tons was recently hauled between Witbank and Germiston under favourable conditions.\n\nIt has been stated that engines of the Mallet type damage the track more than engines of other types. This is not the case. Reports submitted show that in Natal the wheel flanges of the Mallet type of engine wear better than those of any other class, thus indicating that the friction between the flanges and the rail is less.”\n\nThe same General Managers report indicated that there were only 7 Mallets in service in December, 1910, the solitary class MA 2-6-6-0 and 5 similar of class MB in Natal and the single class MD mentioned above on the Witbank line. One can only assume that the reference to 11 engines working on the Witbank line refers to a period after December, 1910, as the report usually came out some time after the end of the financial year, and therefore included the 9 class MF’s and the single class MG placed in service in 1911 as mentioned below.\n\n5. The fat combustion-chambered Belpaire boiler of the 12A stands out in this portrait made at Germiston in the late 1960s.\n\nOn 3rd May 1921 the General Manager wrote to the CME Mr. Hendrie as follows: You will remember that it was originally arranged for the new 12A engines (15) to come to the Transvaal. At a later date – probably after one of your visits to Natal- it was understood that it was your wish that they should go to Natal, and they were scheduled, as a preliminary measure, accordingly. At a still later date, namely after the meeting in this office in November last, you definitely arranged that the engines should come to the Transvaal, Natal to get the new 12th class engines (20) instead. The final schedule has been prepared accordingly. Will you kindly say what influenced you in making the recommendation that the 12A’s should come to the Transvaal. It may be mentioned that Natal has all along pressed for the 12A’s, but the Assistant General Manager has been definitely informed of your latest decision.”\n\nMr. Hendrie’s reply on 10 May 1921 was kind, clear and concise. “The reason I recommended the 12A engines for the Transvaal was because they were designed for service in that Province.”\n\nAs if this was not clear enough, the General Manager, Sir William Hoy wrote to Mr. Hendrie on 13 May 1921 personally, thanking him for his letter and continued “but whilst agreeing with your ultimate recommendation in regard to the allocation of the new class 12A engines, I should like to be quite clear on the point at issue. Kindly say whether your letter is intended also to convey that the engines are not suitable for Natal: if so, please say in what respect they are unsuitable.\n\nNow that the new deviation is open, Natal requires heavy type engines, and no doubt Mr. Moore will press for the new 12A’s. It is therefore desirable that the reasons that influenced you in your latest decision should be placed on record: then if the question is asked at a later date as to why the heavier tractive power 12th class engine was not allocated to Natal, an answer can readily be given.\n\nKindly write further.”\n\nI am sure Mr. Hendrie’s patience was being tried and he allowed his blood pressure to drop a little before he replied on 26 May 1921:\n\n“I cannot say that the 12A class engines are unsuitable for working in Natal, but I consider it is to the interest of the Administration to have them working on the Witbank-Germiston section where the other twenty engines of this series are in service. I have represented to your office from time to time the advisability on economical grounds of keeping engines of one class in one Division and this applies to the 12A’s. The General Manager has written to me from Capetown (his spelling) on the question of the distribution of engines and calling attention to a complaint made by the Chief Railway Storekeeper in regard to the cost of keeping duplicate and triplicate spares where engines of one class are spread over the Union.\n\nThe new deviation between Clairwood and Cato Ridge is only partially opened for traffic- about nine trains a day, I understand, and until the road has become properly settled down I would certainly not advise the running of the 12A’s over this section nor over any portion of the old roads where 300 feet curves exist.\n\nThe arrival of the 12A’s in the Transvaal should release a certain number of 12th class to augment the number of these engines already in Natal.”\n\nSir William obviously had an interview with Mr. Hendrie as there then followed further correspondence on 5 July 1921 from him and I feel I must add it just to close this particular issue regarding the class 12A’s and to give our readers some insight into the issues of the day.\n\n“With reference to exchanged wires and to our conversation during your recent visit to Cape Town, my object in suggesting the temporary allocation of the class 12A engines to Natal was to assist that System to cope with a very heavy and increasing traffic.\n\nI had not seen your letter dated 26 May at the time of our interview and have only just been supplied with a copy thereof. In the opening sentence of that communication you state:-\n\n“I cannot say that the class 12A engines are unsuitable for working in Natal”\n\nAnd then you proceed to give your reasons why they should not be utilized in that Province. But, as explained at our interview, the position in Natal was such as to call for the exercise of every ready measure which would lend immediate assistance to a section of the line where traffic was offering in greater quantities than we could handle, and this at a time when the necessity for obtaining all the revenue possible was never more urgent.\n\nIn view of the critical position in Natal, the urgent necessity for providing ready and immediate means for getting the traffic through to the port and the need for improving our revenue position, I regret it was not possible to allocate these engines temporarily to Natal, especially as an assurance could have been obtained from the Assistant General Manager, Durban, that the locomotives would not be used on deviations or sections of the line likely to interfere with their proper working.\n\nThe question of keeping duplicate and triplicate spares all over the Union as referred to in your letter of 26 May is a matter which ordinarily might be cited as a reason for insisting on the retention of certain types to specified areas, but at the present time when the utmost must be got out of the available engine power, I think, while adhering to the general principle, we will have to sacrifice a little in getting traffic moved, which, after all, is the prime factor in the existence of Railways. And at the moment we must do everything to encourage traffic and thus obtain revenue.”\n\nAnd then followed a paragraph which almost made the above irrelevant.\n\n“While I still think that approval to the allocation temporarily of the 12A Class to Natal might have been given, I am glad the position was met by the transfer of a number of twelfth class engines from Pretoria shops and Germiston to Natal before the 12A Class were ready for service.\n\nI have, however, thought it well to set down my views on this matter.”\n\nThen followed a general comment regarding increasing demand for coal through Lourenco Marques possibly requiring additional engine power on Division 8 and that heavy maize traffic in the Free State had commenced.\n\n7. Class 18* was designed by Henschel in accordance with specifications provided by CME Collins. They had a 19-ton axleload and exerted more than 60,000 lbs starting tractive effort. Nevertheless, in spite of being constructed by one of the all-time most competent and reliable of locomotive manufactures, they were a huge disappointment. The reasons are many and complex, not least being that Col Collins was not a career locomotive man yet stubbornly insisted upon design features such as Gresley conjugated gear, an outdated cylinder design and lightweight motion and rods, all of which contributed to what turned out to be an uneconomical high-maintenance machine. The cylinder design was perhaps the most perplexing as Henschel would have been abreast of contemporary valve events and settings practice and advised SAR accordingly. Failure of the tried-and-trusted Krauss-Helmholtz flexible wheelbase arrangement to perform as expected was also a major issue as this caused excessive tyre wear and the Chief Civil Engineer became prejudiced against it, claiming increased rail wear.\n\nThe failure of the class 18s had far-reaching and expensive consequences for SAR. It resulted in a prejudice against ten-coupled locomotives that lasted until the end of steam.\n\n* The Prussian cross-shaped token was made of thin metal plate and painted bright red to warn that fitters were busy on the engine and that it may not be moved.\n\nThe Operating Department had problems and looked to the CME for solutions. This example is mentioned here because of its link to the Witbank line.\n\nOn 11 September 1933, the GM Mr T H Watermeyer wrote to the CME, Mr A G Watson, referring to an extract from the weekly letter dated 2 September 1933, submitted by the Acting System Manager, Johannesburg:\n\n“The question of engine power is at present under correspondence in connection with the new programme and full recommendations are being submitted to your office. An important matter I would like earnest consideration given to is the provision of large engines to convey South and West of Germiston a load equal to that arriving off the Witbank and Breyten sections. The incoming loads from Witbank average 1,450 tons whilst those West and South are 900/1000 and 1,250 respectively. Every train therefore, including those conveying traffic for other Systems, has to be reduced adding to the yard difficulties considerably. If we had a few engines at Germiston capable of taking 1,450 tons South or West the loads of up to 5 trains a day could run through by the engines only being changed. It is unfortunate that as in the case of the Witbank section a train is made up and after travelling 80 miles has to be put into a busy yard and broken up.”\n\nHow those Operating Officers would have enjoyed today's modern traction.\n\n10. A block-load of coal leaving Kendal behind one of the brand-new GMAMs introduced in 1956 to supplement existing motive power. As Peter Stow mentions above, this was an interim measure preparatory to electrification of the Witbank line. Initially, and as an indication of the prevailing desperate motive-power situation, they were run through from Witbank to Kroonstad (210 miles), a diagram that ended abruptly with the arrival of SAR's first road diesels, the DE1s, in mid-1958. The whistle boards were for a rather dangerous level crossing, since closed, on the curve approaching the station and which served the railway houses to the right in the picture.\n\nIn a letter dated 24 October 1956, the General Manager in writing to the CME, Johannesburg, stated “in regard to the final allocation of the new class GMA/M locomotives I have to inform you that a redistribution of locomotive power is now being planned in six monthly periods for the next four years and this will be published to all concerned as soon as it has been completed. Initially the GMA/M class engines on order will be employed on the Western Transvaal System releasing class 15F engines for strengthening the power on other Systems.\n\nAs electrification schemes on the Western Transvaal System are completed and electric units on order come into service further class 15F engines will be transferred so that the allocation of class GMA/M engines to other Systems will not commence until towards the end of 1958 or early in 1959. In the meantime, they will be used on the Witbank, Houtkop, Grootvlei, Klerksdorp and Kroonstad sections.”\n\nOn 1 November, 1957, a revised engine power programme was issued and therein it was mentioned that 60 class 5E locomotives were planned to be allocated to the Witbank section when electrification was to be completed in October, 1960. During the period October to December, 1960 the locomotives thus released were to be transferred as follows: 6 class 15F to the Cape Eastern System, 20 class GMAM to Natal and 10 class GMAM to the Eastern Transvaal System.\n\nOn 7 September 1961 the General Manager asked the CME, Johannesburg, amongst others, “if arrangements could be made for twelve class 32 diesel locomotives (six sets) to be despatched from Germiston in time to arrive at De Aar during the last week in September, 1961. These diesel locomotives are for use between De Aar and Beaufort West.” This quantity was later reduced to 10 (5 sets) of which 4 were to be continually in service and the fifth set functioning as relief to permit the return of each set fortnightly to Germiston for maintenance attention.\n\nThis was done to release 6 class 25 condensing locomotives from Beaufort West for Beaconsfield. The letter continued: “The twelve class 32 locomotives will work between De Aar and Beaufort West for approximately three months and towards the end of December 1961 they must be returned to Germiston to work on the Witbank electrified section to enable the Western Transvaal System to release 12 class 5E locomotives during early January 1962 for the Touwsrivier – Beaufort West section.”\n\nThere was a further chain reaction with the Cape Western System to transfer a further 14 class 25 condensing locomotives to Beaconsfield, the Cape Northern System releasing 18 class 23 to Bloemfontein, releasing 18 class 15F to Germiston for use on the Germiston-Volksrust section thus releasing class 31 diesel locomotives to work on the Witbank/Reef electrified sections thereby releasing a further number of class 5E electric locomotives for the Touwsrivier – Beaufort West section. The actual number involved was to be advised later. Clearly it was important to place electric locomotives on the Touwsrivier – Beaufort West section as quickly as possible, probably because of the water issues and the redeployment of the class 25 condensing steam locomotives operating there.\n\nBy December 1961 the plan was changed and although the eighteen class 23 locomotives were still to go to Bloemfontein, 8 class 15F’s were to be sent from Bloemfontein to Bethlehem to release 8 class 15AR’s for the Cape Eastern, thus releasing 2 class 12AR’s each for De Aar, Beaconsfield and Vandyksdrif (The transfer to Vandyksdrif was later cancelled-see below). Two class 15F were to go to from Vandyksdrif to Volksrust as well as four 15F’s from Bloemfontein to Volksrust.\n\nThis latter plan was amended again on 20 January 1962 and as it no longer affected the Germiston-Witbank line it is not detailed here.\n\nBibliography: “Steam Locomotives of the South African Railways” Volume 1 and 2 by D.F. Holland\n\nReports of the General Manager of the SAR\n\nVarious Files from the Office of the Chief Mechanical Engineer, South African Railways, housed in the South African National Archives in Pretoria.\n\nPhotographs of all this steam activity are few and far between. I for one, preferred to visit other lines for photography where one could see passenger and goods trains. I seldom visited the Witbank line but did go there on the odd occasion.\n\nFor this reason Charlie and I took a decision (in this instance) to overlook our basic cut-off point for SoAR which is 1990 – the end of the SAR/SATS era.\n\nFortunately, two friends have come to the rescue in providing post-SAR/SATS-era photos to add to my earlier images for this chapter of SoAR! They are Eugene Armer and Peter Stow – two well-known and accomplished photographers of trains in South Africa.\n\nTheir beautiful images are a credit not only to themselves but also to SoAR!

It is still one of Transnet's most important revenue generators.\n\nUntil the mid 1970’s most coal was consumed domestically by the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging industrial complex, local and provincial electric power stations countrywide, bunkering of the maritime industry (in earlier years) and of course the SAR, either directly in its locomotives or via power stations and overhead catenaries.\n\nAlthough initially linked to Johannesburg by the NZASM’s 1894 route to Lourenco Marques via Pretoria, the direct route from the Witbank coal fields to the mines of the Witwatersrand had to wait until 1906. The original Rand Tram followed the contours of the land via Rangeview to Apex, from where a branch took off due eastwards to Welgedag, then north eastwards to Witbank via Delmas and Ogies. The branch from Ogies to van Dyksdrift and Broodsnyersplaas was only constructed in 1950 and the branch from Delmas to the Hawerklip mine as late as 1965. The disused passenger platforms between Apex and Welgedag are explained by the timetables of the 1960’s which show not only morning and afternoon Witbank trains being routed this way but also some shorter workings to Delmas. Only later were Witbank passenger trains routed through Springs - the link being constructed in 1952. Ogies to Broodsnyersplaas trains provided passenger accommodation on goods trains which even after linking into the Coal Line was still referred to as “the branch”.\n\nIn addition to these two branches, numerous private sidings linked the coal mines to this important SAR trunk line.\n\n15. Classes 12AR No 1535+15CA No 2054 crossing one of the ill-fated steel trusses over the Wilge River near Argent on 26 November 1983. Destruction of the three trusses by the derailment referred to by Peter Micenko and Alistair Christison (see next paragraph) was complete so a concrete replacement using the original 1906 masonry abutments (see photo 35) was built for the Up and Down mains only - the third track bridge was not re-instated.\n\nWe are indebted to Transport Consultant Alistair Christison for this account of the derailment:\n\n\"From about 1984 onwards Railways ran a daily train from Sappi Ngodwana to Durban Maydon wharf routed via Geduld to drop off wagons and then carrying on down the Natcor.\n\nWe asked for this train to be called the Red Arrow and at one stage the new sliding hood wagons (well, converts anyway) were all named after lighthouses around the world since the product was going for export.\n\nIt was regrettably this train which derailed one day on the Wilge River bridge westbound.\n\nWagon 13 of a 38 wagon vacuum set suffered a broken axle on the approach to the bridge and the chassis slewed across the track sufficiently so that it no longer was able to pass through the truss bridge—which it promptly demolished.\n\nWagons 1 to 12 and the locos came to a very sudden stop—so much so that all of them decanted newsprint rolls sideways all over both tracks and the veld.\n\nWagons 14 to 38 piled into the wreckage on the bridge and took out both of the other bridges and the wagons plus contents and bridge bits all fell into the Wilge river.\n\nUnfortunately the last 6 wagons were tankers containing a foul liquid called Black Liquor which has a habit of de-oxygenating water—so to avoid pollution downstream it became necessary to temporarily dam the river just downstream of the bridge.\n\nAll returned to normal about 4 days later.\"\n\nIn a later derailment - also in the nineties (!) the original masonary abutments were also destroyed and were replaced by concrete ones.\n\nThere were no major bridges on the Hawerklip line as the route paralleled the Witbank main for several miles until all lines crossed a low bridge where the Hawerklip branch turned south and climbed the eastern side of the valley forming the headwaters of the Bronkhorstspruit. The Hawerklip line was laid with the original duo-block concrete sleepers - piles of these can be seen in various photos throughout the chapters of Soul of a Railway. Later the second generation monoblock concrete sleepers were adopted on more heavily trafficked lines. SAR was one of the leading concrete sleepered railways, with most N1 lines re-laid by the late 1970’s and duo blocks still in good condition being cascaded to lesser lines.\n\nThe branch from Vandyksdrift to Blinkpan was built in 1956 and remained steel sleepered with jointed track until the new deep cutting through the hill to the east of the station was constructed. Once that deviation was completed and linked into the existing double track heavy duty alignment at Blinkpan, the local perway gangs were able to sleep better at night - the old curvaceous steel-sleepered track being a notorious derailment section. A few deep valleys are crossed, the first at Bezuidenhoutsrus where the railway crosses aptly named Steenkoolspruit - originally by the traditional curvaceous approach and multiple steel girder spans but more recently by the third line on a straight alignment with a high prestressed-concrete bridge. After Bezuidenhoutsrus there is another significant bridge before Vandyksdrif. Originally this consisted of multispan plate girders like Bezuidenhoutsrus but more recently both have been replaced by modern concrete structures looking more like a motorway intersection on the M2 than a railway.\n\n· SIGNALLING\n\nI am indebted to Harry Ostrofsky for confirming my observations and clarifying details on this important and remunerative route. Thank you Harry, your assistance is very much appreciated. The following are observations made in the 1970’s and 1980’s and no doubt, applied earlier as well:\n\nStarting firstly with the easy bit. Springs - Welgedag was originally a single line worked with van Schoor train tokens. There was a crossing loop at Payneville that used van Schoor crossing tokens. Later it was converted to non-token operation when Welgedag CTC came into being.\n\nThe Dunswart-Apex-Welgedag-Blackhill- Witbank section was double tracked early in its history. For the purpose of describing the trains working, occasional mention will be made of Witbank although the system boundary was just east of Blackhill.\n\nAfter double track was introduced from 1915 and with manned stations all the way on the Dunswart- Apex-Welgedag- Ogies – Blackhill- Witbank line, the method of train control was SAR's version of Tyer's Double Line Absolute Lock & Block. On longer sections where headway was a problem, the blocks were split with an intermediate colour-light signal. It was called \"auxiliary block\". Eventually most of the lock-and-block sections were converted to axle-counter-block as well as the auxiliary-block sections.\n\nThe branch from Ogies to Broodsnyersplaas in Harry’s early days was double track to Vandyksdrif using Lock & Block. My observations from early 1982 were that the Ogies-Vandyksdrif section was CTC worked from Ogies and had bi-directional colour light signalling. This was much to the benefit of our track tamping as track access was dramatically facilitated.\n\nWelgedag – Blackhill – Witbank was double track and the CTC at Ogies was originally introduced to control from Kendal (excl) to Minnaar (excl) and Saaiwater (excl) while the coal line was being built. The plan was to control from Ogies to Broodsnyersplaas (incl) as this was the end of the Western Transvaal System/Southern Transvaal Region. The CTC was later extended to Witbank (excl). Only in the Transnet era was Sundra - Kendal added to Ogies CTC.\n\nThe original single track alignment around the hill east of Vandyksdrift (on the Broodsnyersplaas branch) was controlled using van Schoor train token. When the line was doubled the lock and block was extended and later when the Coal line came into use, it was put onto Ogies CTC.\n\nTo complicate things, Welgedag had a CTC control centre at the station. Ogies had a CTC centre for working the double track line to Saaiwater and onwards to Vandyksdrift. Here Van Schoor took over for the single track bottleneck around the mountain where CTC took over again at Blinkpan and Broodsnyerplaas. This latter section from Blinkpan eastwards being double track to modern standards.\n\nThe Hawerklip branch from Delmas was operated with a wooden staff. Neither of us can recall if paper tickets were used with the wooden staff. Today this line is worked with Track Warrant Control (TWC) from Sentrarand as there is a junction on this line to a newer coal mine and the traffic has increased.\n\nThis all illustrates that around this area it was possible to see most of the SAR’s different train control methods in just a few hours.\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nAlthough the Witbank line was a major mineral and goods conveyor it did carry several daily passenger trains each way. Not as frequent as Les experienced on the Vereeniging line but still full, convenient passenger trains. The branch to VanDyksdrift also had a reasonable passenger service although at times only with “accommodation provided on goods trains”. It did connect quite well, especially on weekends, with the Johannesburg - Witbank passenger trains.\n\n· WELGEDAG\n\nWelgedag was a very large marshalling yard complex on the city, or client, end of the route from the Coal Fields. Its main function was to make up rakes of empty wagons for dispatch to the various mines (or more correctly, to the numerous private siding exchange yards that were such a feature of the mine end of this part of the network). Similarly but to a lesser extent, general goods traffic was rearranged for various destinations. The result was much heavy shunting that kept many of Springs depot's engines busy. Also of note was the daily water train which took domestic water from Welgedag to the various stations such as Minnaar and Blackhill. The latter may seem strange but the coal fields, despite being located in one of the better rainfall areas of the country, actually had few supplies of potable water and regional water reticulation was still a long way off in the 1980’s. Even in the 1980’s on an otherwise very busy electrified line, this was a steam turn.\n\n17. Although the Welgedag-Blackhill-Witbank section and its branches were electrified by 1961, steam continued to potter around on haulers and shunts for almost another 30 years, as John's photo of rather grotty 15Fs at the Vandyksdrif sub-shed, taken on 23 April 1988, testifies.\n\nOne of the best things about \"Soul of A Railway\" is the contributions it draws from its readers. No sooner had Alistair given us the lowdown on the Wilge River derailment than Mike Carter sent this: \"The photograph of Vandyksdrif sub-shed brings back memories. During the time I fired at Springs we had to swap the engines there when they were due for a washout. In those days (1973 -74) classes 12R, 12A & 12AR were stationed there.\n\nOn one Saturday afternoon we arrived at Vandyksdrif to find that the crew of the engine we were due to return with had thrown out the fire and had gone home! Luckily the boiler was still warm, we rounded up some wood & waste and got the fire going again. Turned around in 90 minutes. Those were the days!\"\n\n· THE NEW THIRD LINE\n\nWhen the new coal export line was constructed in the early 1970’s it started from the end of Vandyksdrif's elderly branch line to Broodsnyersplaas and continued as a new build with modern alignment, formation and track standards to Ermelo, Vryheid and Richards Bay. It was soon found that after nearly a century of traffic the existing historical network in the coal fields was not capable of handling the increased axle loads and train sizes, so new track was constructed, generally paralleling the old double track from Blackhill westwards to Ogies and then south eastward to Broodsnyersplaas (the Regional boundary with Eastern Transvaal/Coal Line). This was built in accordance with modern geotechnical knowledge and soil mechanics design to better sustain the tonnages and loads the new line was expected to carry. In the process the existing and inadequate steel-sleepered alignments at Bezuidenhoutsrus (a huge double track horse shoe to cross a major stream) and Vandyksdrif (a sharply curved single track horseshoe around a ridge) were eliminated. They were bypassed by straight deviations - the former with a large concrete bridge and the latter through a deep cutting. A tunnel was proposed at Vandyksdrif, but it would have locked up too much mineable coal at a time before long-wall mining under operating railways had become common practice. In the process many mines linked directly into the new “Third Line” and 100-wagon unit coal trains ran into most mines, especially those equipped with modern high-speed load-outs and balloon tracks.\n\nThis little aside is marginally outside the scope of SoaR and is mentioned mainly for thoroughness and to indicate the changes in traffic directions that took place when export coal became the significant revenue generator. Focus was removed almost entirely from internal business - branch lines, private sidings and the small customer, to heavy-haul and the export coal and ore business. It could be argued that this was a mixed blessing, both for South Africa's railways and its economy.\n\nAlthough liquid fuel and conveyor-belt technology for feeding power stations direct from the mines have taken over for internal consumption, and a large proportion of the Nation’s income comes from export coal, this chapter covers an area not generally frequented by latter-day railway enthusiasts and which deserves recognition as the source of an energy supply that contributed so significantly to the development of South Africa.\n\nJust how strategic this region is is shown by the graves on the platform at Ogies of soldiers killed during the Anglo-Boer War, six years before the railway reached Ogies! Perhaps an interesting research project for local historians."
