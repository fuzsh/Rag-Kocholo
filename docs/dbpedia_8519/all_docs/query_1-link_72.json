        "text": "I did not know Rashakalimphani Frank Ratshitanga when he was an ANC MP and whip, a university graduate, or a delegate on Parliamentary and Provincial visits to Zimbabwe and Uganda, among his other activities from 1995 until his passing in November 2022. When I met him in 1984, he appeared to be the janitor of Venda University, a man with a Grade 10 qualification, and I was a newly appointed English lecturer and the single mom of three sons. I wish I could recall our first meeting and our first words, but all I know is that his wisdom and depth struck me at once, and we soon became friends. He told us to call him Frank, which we did at first, but later I knew him only as Rashaka.\n\nHis gentleness and his deep voice impressed me deeply. We did “speak politics” but we spoke at my level of knowledge, which was low. I fancied myself a broad-minded sympathiser with the oppressed people of my nation, but I was the product of the sheltered, privileged lives that white South Africans led, and that most still lead. At first, he told me about his poetry, and I was fascinated. In 1973 he had published an anthology called Tsengela Tsiwana, which (I found out later) means Speaker for the Needy, and he was still producing poems. He did not translate any into English for my benefit; he said he found that impossibly difficult. But he was open to the fact that I was receptive to ideas, and indeed I listened to his beautiful voice as he talked about the history of his people, and about the film he had made in the early 1980s, called Two Rivers. It was banned in South Africa, but today we can all listen to the story of the Venda people as he tells it, with his deep caring and poetic flair. This is the link to the film, preserved in the Internet Archive.\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/thetworivers/thetworiversreel1.mov\n\nHis call, at the end, for the streams of our country to start flowing together “as one mighty river” is still the great dream of my life, and I believe that he is one of the people that has made that day come closer.\n\nHe told me that a student at The University of the North was writing a dissertation on his poetry, and in 1983 a student by the name of Milubi at the University of Zululand wrote “The Poetry of RF Ratshitanga,” a critical evaluation of the poetry of protest.\n\nI knew very well that he was not the starry-eyed dreamer kind of poet, because the steely grit at the centre of the man was palpable in his bearing and his words. His uncompromising integrity is best illustrated by a story written in City Press by Mathata Tsedu after his passing:\n\n“The SA Council of Churches (SACC) had a division called Dependants Conference, which saw to the needs of dependants of detainees and political prisoners held in places such as Robben Island and Kroonstad, the latter was where women political prisoners were kept. The duty to approach the SACC fell on Rashakalimphani Ratshitanga.\n\n‘I went and met with John Rees, who was the secretary-general, in his office. I explained to him and he simply told me there was no money. I was very angry and stood up and grabbed him by the neck and pinned him against the wall, telling him he was going to give us the money or I would beat him up.\n\nHe realised I meant business and he gave us the money. It emerged later he was actually stealing some of the money for himself.’ “\n\nMathata Tsedu | SA loses another fighter | City Press (news24.com)\n\nOf course, just being in Venda was an education, because over the arbitrary border was “another country” – apartheid South Africa. From the beginning, I loved the lush green vegetation, although Rashaka told me how much land they had already lost, and that what was left was now overpopulated. I loved the language, which has no clicks, but is full of rolling ells and ems, somehow reflecting the landscape. I was told the paramount chief, who became President in 1979 on Venda’s pseudo-independence, Patrick Mphephu, was a popular man. When he died in 1988, there were persistent rumours that he had been poisoned, but one would never know, because the people who had been given power by the Nationalist Party and not by the people, would not investigate. I just became involved in my everyday life, and I feel I should digress a little to say something about what Venda was like for me and my three sons, Kurt, Julian and Philip, who were 14. 12 and 9.\n\nSome people asked me why I was willing to teach in a university that was part of the regime’s apartheid policy, and my answer was, “I teach real people.” Indeed, the students were hard-working and interesting, and we learned from one another. I prescribed African literature, which was a freedom I did not have working in the Education Departments at “home,” and more than once some reference could be explained by a student who had once worked say in Vereeniging, or someone who understood a linguistic reference that was opaque to me. I still have the lecture notes for the anthology edited by Wole Soyinka, Poems of Black Africa (Heinemann 1975). Mind you, student participation was won slowly. One day I asked if everyone understood some distinction I was talking about, and there was a loud communal gasp when one student dared to say no. How could he be so rude to the lecturer who was clearly trying her best? I happily tried to explain again, until he was satisfied. I heard later that he had studied in Johannesburg, where he saw that one could ask a teacher to clarify a point. Once, two or three students who had been very quiet explained to me that “trust is a big word.” They wanted to discuss the political aspect of a poem, but not in the open classroom. I managed to secure a one-year scholarship to UCT for one student, and another for a year in Canada for another student, a Mr Netshivera. They both told me afterwards that the experience had been life-altering.\n\nI learned a lot from Rashaka and his young son Mukoni when it came to classroom management. For one year, Rashaka was appointed as a Standard Two (now grade four) teacher at the local school, despite his lack of qualifications. I felt the authorities acknowledged by appointing him that he was indeed a teacher of his people. He described his first day in the classroom like this. He asked the children what the canes lying on the teacher’s table were for.\n\n“To cane us when we’re naughty,” they explained.\n\n“But what if I don’t want to cane anyone? What will we do if someone is naughty?”\n\n“I’ll cane him!” someone volunteered.\n\n“But there will be no hitting in my classroom,” said Rashaka.\n\nIn the end they negotiated the solution that if a student made it impossible for him to teach, the others would bundle him out of the classroom until he decided to cooperate. That year, Rashaka said, he had to remind them of that arrangement just once, and the situation was quickly resolved.\n\nMukoni told us how his teacher once caned all the children in the class because they had failed a Maths test. Mukoni then raised his hand, and the teacher said, “What?”\n\n“Sir, why did you cane me?”\n\n“Because you failed your Maths test!”\n\n“And now that you have caned me, do I know my Maths?”\n\nI found my friends among the staff members who did not subscribe to the founding ideology. My friend in Pretoria, Tertia Zaayman, Afrikaans lecturer, had prompted me to apply for the position. Stuart Emerson was an Englishman whose marriage to Mercy would have been illegal in South Africa proper, and there were lecturers that would have been classified in various categories in South Africa, with whom I was free to talk, dine and party. I became a member of the local church and was baptised in the Levuvhu River along with a younger Venda woman. I loved our services under a thorn tree, especially the singing and dancing. The head of the English department was Prof Roy Holland, whom I married in 1986, but that is another story. At first everyone knew me as Melanie Donald.\n\nNo, not everyone, actually. Many of the parents who lived not far from our new university houses called me “Mme-Philippi.” Philip, my youngest, was the most extravert, although all three of them made friends among the local boys. “Mme-Philippi” made it clear that it was for Philip that I was recognised in our neighbouring village, although the prefix is usually attached to the name of the eldest son. I remember going for a walk and acquiring en route at least 30 little followers who all saluted me as Mme-Philippi. When we got home, they would settle down to watch some kiddies’ program on TV. Occasionally their mothers would also come to watch something. One group of young boys firmly informed us that they were the good boys and my sons should play with them. I think they were the Christian children, and they actually got their wish, mainly because they chased the others away, and they spoke a little English. In any case, there were just too many children for an objection to make sense.\n\nVenda was hot, even in the rain, and the soil was reddish. When it rained that red soil stuck to your shoes like glue, and your feet grew bigger and bigger as you walked. So the boys often played outside in the rain, barefoot. The dirt road next to our houses was a perfect place to make a city in the mud. The children created buildings, roads and bridges for their miniature cars, and when a real car came along (which was not often) they moved out of the way for a bit and then checked to see how much of their architecture had survived. My neighbour was Prof. Piet Naude, head of the Theology department, and he remarked one day how delightful it was to watch little white and black boys playing together, who at the end of the day were all little red boys. They had to be hosed down in the garden before they came in for a bath.\n\nI invited the deacons of the church, seven men and their wives, to come to a braai at my house one evening. It became a good example of my education in cultural assumptions. I was told in passing by one of them that “there was great interest in my invitation,” so I ran to Rashaka to ask if that meant that I would have more than 14 guests. He smiled and explained that my guests would not think that some people could be excluded, and that I would have an unknown number of guests, but decidedly more than 14. He smiled again when he saw the little grid I had prepared, and started making a fire in the garden. Together, we scrutinised all my cookware and hauled out everything that could possibly be used to roast meat. I doubled up my efforts in preparing salads and buying bread and meat. Sure enough, that evening I had 30 guests if I had one. Rashaka excused himself as soon as he saw it was going to be okay, although I asked him to stay. I remember the beginning of the speech that one of the deacons made, “They speak of history being made…” We all enjoyed the steaks and boerewors served from pans, pots and even their lids, as they came off the fire. Everyone helped – the men with the braaiing and the women with the cleaning up, and I went to bed with a song in my heart.\n\nI saw that custom of open invitations in action again when Rashaka asked me to help him with a funeral he was responsible for organising; I think it was his uncle who had died. He had selected an ox and paid a local farmer for it, and we needed to fetch it on my bakkie and take it to his home. I was fascinated by the whole process – we drove to the farmer’s field, where an accurate marksman downed the ox. They had the hoist available, and sitting behind the steering wheel, I was rocked by the impact as the carcass was placed on the back with a thump. I needed to drive in the low gears along those rough dirt roads to Rashaka’s place, where the ox was unloaded while I got to talk to his wife, Tshililo. Rashaka explained that they had sent out word about the funeral, and that some guests would arrive the day before, others throughout the day itself, and a few even a day late, as their means of transport allowed. The ox would be roasted on a spit and the women would have the other food and drinks ready all the time. What flexible generosity! It made my invitation to just 14 people at a specific time look paltry and mean.\n\nThe bakkie was really useful on other occasions, too. For example, I was woken in the middle of one night because a little boy in the village had been bitten by a snake. His mother and I rushed him to the Sibasa Hospital, where he was successfully treated.\n\nWe organised an art exhibition at the university, and I bought this sculpture of a woman carrying water and a load by H Nekhofhe. I still love it.\n\nMy children’s schooling became an issue. Kurt was already at Pretoria Boys’ High School, and Venda was the place he came to for holidays, but Julian and Philip were transported to Makhado, called Louis Trichardt at the time, to attend a school during the week, and came home for weekends. They did not enjoy it, and I hated the content and the slant of the curriculum they were being taught. Julian once told me a racist joke, and I vetoed it angrily. After a while, what he learnt to tell me the jokes he heard as though they were about an Irishman instead of a black man, and I must confess, I laughed. Later, he confessed what he had done, and I took the lesson in selective prejudice. I owe Irish people an apology, although, of course, I didn’t take the jokes seriously. A number of other parents, and Rasahka, also wanted an independent, international school for their children. Rashaka and I, with Ian Raper and other academics, became deeply involved in founding Liivha School, which was free from the official South African departments of education.\n\nI really am not a woman who should have been caught by a dating site scammer, because I have never entered one! It happened like this.\n\nIn June, I got a FB message from Adriaan Jeffreys, saying he’d been searching for a friend with the same surname as mine, and saw my profile. He wondered if we could chat. I thought, well, why not? He certainly had a nice face.\n\nMostly, we exchanged WhatsApp messages. He did call me once, but he didn’t seem comfortable, so we went back to messages. What I found out was that he was an architect based in Stellenbosch. That appealed to me, because I love that pretty dorp. He said his mother had been an Afrikaner and his dad Belgian, which explained his accent. He asked me questions too. Among other things we exchanged pictures of food we had cooked, and when he saw my vegetable curry, he said, You will make that for me one day. Sure, I said.\n\nHe would greet me every morning and say good night without fail, which felt good for a while, until I started to feel checked up on. I decided to put him right off by telling him my age. I said there was no point in continuing to chat, because he was looking for a relationship. His reply was touching. He said he’d just turned 70 himself, and was just looking for an honest woman, because what we needed at our stage of life was love and care. So we went on WhatsApping and sometimes chatting via WhatsApp. He sent me songs to listen to, like Louis Armstrong’s Wonderful World, and You’re Beautiful by James Blunt. I heard about his family, and he sent me pictures of his son and daughter, with her little daughter, each one of them a beautiful human being. When I commented on that, he said My children are beautiful to me. That was nice. He sent me a copy of his South African ID card too, for some reason.\n\nAgain, I started feeling that this was artificial, and asked for a second Skype call, so we could see each other. After a bit of a delay, he did call, but soon made an excuse about his phone acting up. I wondered why an architect with such an impressive office (he’d sent me a pic) had a dicey phone. Also, there had been something jerky about the image of his face as he turned his head, which he seemed to do randomly for no reason. So I started to look at everything more critically. I also looked for architects online, but could not find his name on any list, in Stellenbosch or South Africa.\n\nI asked him about this and he said it was because he’d graduated in Belgium. He kept telling me when he was going to work, and on lunch, and going home again. One morning, he mentioned that he was taking his workers to their current site. Again I wondered – would an architect do that himself? I was feeling less tolerant of his grammar mistakes too. Surely a professional who had spent so much time in South Africa would have learned to speak English better?\n\nHe seemed excited because his daughter was coming to visit him for the first time in two years, He said he kept a car specially for her to use when she came, because he liked driving his bakkie. One day he showed me a picture of Asara wine farm, where he was eating. When I asked for a picture which included him, he sent one, but it looked as if he was sitting in a car. Oh well, that was possible, I supposed. I don’t think he picked up on my suspicion. He sent me a picture of him with his dog, but it did look awfully posed. I started listening to his accent more carefully, and thought it reminded me of the Korean English accent. It really didn’t seem to be French or Flemish. So I asked him which group his dad identified with, and he replied brightly, Both! That did it, because I have never met a Belgian who didn’t feel he was one or the other.\n\nThe few friends I’d mentioned him to thought it was sweet, or even very nice, but the minute I told my son and daughter-in-law, they asked me to block him immediately. Philip described what people could do on the dark net with “false faces.”\n\nI spoke to him one more time. He’d been saying that he’d like to come and fetch me to take me to a wine farm in Stellenbosch for lunch. When I said it was more sensible for me to drive there and meet him, he asked in a rather startled voice, How long would that take you?\n\nLess than an hour, I replied, wondering how it was that he didn’t know the distance from Cape Town.\n\nThat night I blocked him. The next morning I got a call from an unknown number, and it was Adriaan asking what was happening.\n\nI don’t want to talk to you anymore, because I don’t think you’re real, I replied, and blocked that number too. I was left wondering where I would have been taken if I had allowed him to pick me up in his bakkie – maybe some isolated and squalid place where I could cook for him while he emptied my bank account. That made me smile – how disappointed he would have been! And then what?\n\nWho is the handsome man whose picture he used? Is there an Adriaan Jeffreys somewhere? Is there an Asian or other gang carefully preying on lonely older women – of course there is! Be so careful…\n\ne\n\nWhen I was an English lecturer at the University of Venda, Prof Ralushai (Sociology) told me that there was no word for “opposition” in the Venda language. Colleagues from other parts of Africa said that the same was true of their languages. There is only the word “enemy.” Government and justice were conducted, they reminded me, on the basis of consensus among elders, who were a single body.\n\nEnter Western democracy, and things become complex. South Africa has a constitution to be proud of, but it is functioning on the African continent and here we will have to let it find its own character. We don’t have to choose between pure Westminster and a traditional indaba. We have the exciting opportunity to discover how the best of both worlds can express themselves as our young democracy evolves.\n\nWhen I bear this in mind, I find the ANC less baffling. It is a powerful custom to present a united front to the world, while working out differences internally. In fact, if they were not trying to do that – because they are not fooling anyone – we might have had a war instead of an enigma.\n\nAnd the main player is the enigmatic president, Cyril Ramaphosa. I believe we owe him more than we know. He was President Mandela’s first choice for a successor, but when the party favoured Thabo Mbeki, Mandela advised him to go into business and wait and watch. No one was better equipped to do that than Ramaphosa, brilliant strategist that he is. He has been playing the long game ever since. In the business world he succeeded spectacularly and when the party needed him again, he became Deputy President. What painful years those must have been for him! He saw the workers he had battled for as a Trade Union leader betrayed and indeed all South Africa’s poorest citizens neglected, at best, while the state coffers were plundered by multiple acts of fraud, cronyism and corruption. He and his wife, Dr Tshepo Motsepe quietly continued to donate hundreds of thousands of rands towards education, another field that was left to deteriorate.\n\nA cloud that threatened to darken his reputation was that, as a non-executive director of Lonmin, he had played a part in the shooting of protesting miners in 2014 when he said that they needed to take action. He resigned from Lonmin in February 2015, and the Marikana Commission of Inquiry cleared him of any personal responsibility for orders that had been given. In fact, all court actions that have been brought against him have failed. On the other hand, the state attorney is burdened with the problem of recovering R18.3 million in expenses for Zuma’s court appearances – and he is still eluding the big charges at present. How much rope does he need to hang himself? Yet it is smart to allow all his special pleas to be heard because no one will be able to say (with justification) that he has been denied any of his constitutional rights.\n\nRamaphosa has always known that to preserve peace and save lives, he had to operate within the ANC, and he had a strong enough following of loyal admirers and wily operators like the corrupt Ace Magashule, who was willing to bet on him, that he edged out Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in an election for the leader of the ANC in December 2017. Since that time, he has been walking a tightrope, steadily turning back the tide of corruption while keeping the ANC intact. If it breaks apart it will be because the corrupt elements decide to leave – he will not be responsible for destroying the organisation that liberated South Africa and that he has served since his youth, even when that meant incarceration.\n\nHis list of achievements is long. Imagine where these organisations might have been if it were not for the strategic appointments that have been made on his watch. Eskom, after all the mismanagement and neglect is now headed up by Andre de Ruyter; Moyane at SARS has been replaced by Edward Kieswetter; under Madoda Mxakwe the SABC has shown its first profit for years; Shamila Batohi is the head of the NPA and the days of the Zuma-appointed Public Protector, Busiswa Mchwelane, are clearly numbered. There are many more people of integrity taking up positions in the abused structures of the South African economy. Most of the appointments have happened according to precepts and protocols, and one sees in the background the steady hand of the President driving events.\n\nWe need a special reminder about Eskom. South Africa was on the verge of getting a ruinously expensive Russian nuclear power station, and what a relief it was in 2019 when the then finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, announced that the government had scrapped the idea. Now they are working on the long-term Integrated Resource Plan, which supports a diverse energy mix and focuses on renewable energy sources. If we do get another nuclear power station, it will be properly planned and commissioned and benefit only the general South African population. The plan is to decommission 24 coal power plants between 2030 and 2050. Unfortunately, it’s hard to get a battered population excited about such proper, careful, long-term planning.\n\nAnd battered we are, because on top of all the economic issues, we have had Covid-19. Just compare the two stages onto which Mandela and Ramaphosa made their entrances. Mandela was universally hailed as a hero and given goodwill and every opportunity to refashion South Africa. Ramaphosa entered a stage peppered with thugs who wanted to remain on the take, whom he nevertheless had to keep on board while an orderly clean-up began. I believe it has taken not only intelligence but enormous courage to tackle the challenge. He has to listen to impatient and unrealistic criticism and face false accusations, but he has never lost his vision. He said recently that history would prove him right, and I agree.\n\nRamaphosa has actually won the terrible battle he had to fight; there is no viable rival to him in the ANC now. This does not mean that he will suddenly start issuing executive orders because that just isn’t his way of operating. I have no doubt that he is keeping abreast of developments around the investigations into the looting, and for example, the case against Ace. I hope he will launch an investigation into the SAPS and why Cele was unwilling to arrest ex-Presidant Zuma when it was clearly his duty to do just that. The Police are not in good hands; indeed, they have recently dismissed one of their best men, Jeremy Verey, with a proven record of dealing with gangsterism on the Cape Flats. If the President deals with issues like these effectively, he will galvanise the country behind him. Most people are hungry for strong leadership.\n\nIn the meantime, let’s not be ungrateful. I believe that in time and with hindsight we will realize that this man was actually our sweetheart president.\n\nPS The letter by “Niemoller” that you can read on the link below has many specific recommendations for President Ramaphosa.\n\nhttps://www.biznews.com/news/2021/07/26/open-letter-ramaphosa\n\nWhen the corona virus named SARS-CoV-2, or Covid-19, hit South Africa, we all knew it would mushroom when it reached the townships from the privileged suburbs that imported it. So it did. Few of the people in these constricted settings had been able to build up reserves of strength and a robust immune system. In addition, regular handwashing with an inadequate water supply, and social distancing in overcrowded conditions were pipe dreams. In particular, I want to look at the case of Cape Town, where these neglected areas were soon the hotspots.\n\nWe inherited, after apartheid, a divided city, with and the poorer (and darker) citizens deliberately stuck on the outskirts in poorly serviced townships. When cities develop organically, the poorer citizens almost always end up in the inner city, but this was apartheid spatial planning. Today, those townships do mercifully have electricity, but they still exist – still on the outskirts and still locked in poverty – and now the electricity supply is being cut off regularly for load-shedding, which leaves vulnerable people literally in the dark. They are more overcrowded than ever, because urbanisation naturally continues (it had been artificially delayed by Apartheid), and many hopeful new arrivals find homes in backyard shacks. Also, the townships have not been developed or improved, so that more successful residents are not tempted to stay.\n\nThe City has often boasted about its administration and claimed to be a shining success. A successful city is one that cares for its people, provides the infrastructure for their needs and tries to improve their lot. In fact, to its shame, it created soulless drop-spots like Wolwerivier and Blikkiesdorp, at least as desolate as anything conjured up by the architects of apartheid. Most of the people dumped there were the children of indigenous groups, descendants of slaves, whose labour helped to create the city, while Cape Town was catering for newer types – with money. Families that had been established for generations were elbowed out of Woodstock, Newlands, Wynberg, and other suburbs. Yet, somehow land was always found for developers of new gated communities and high-rises, while service provision for the poor lagged disgracefully behind. In fact, Cedric Nunn has commented that the townships are now worse off than they were in his youth. He has said that unemployment is high, and most townships are flooded with drugs and a sense of hopelessness.\n\nIn the case of Masiphumele, or Site 5, for example, the city has strung the leaders along for decades, delaying, obfuscating, working with selected favourites, but not making a firm, fast commitment to house decently the 30 000 people who live there. A full 30% of the population of the far south is crammed into this small area. Instead of making it a priority to improve conditions and find more land, the City actually lied to leaders in Masi, saying that SANParks owned the land which they had in fact bought from them more than 10 years before! SANParks earmarked it for the development of Masiphumelele. The residents of Masi and other informal settlements once again suffered unbelievable hardship during the recent storms. The Council has made things worse for Masi by extending the road around the vlei without considering people already living in its path. They seem to want to choke Masi, and do not have the political will to extend it, but expand it must, or explode, because it is bursting at the seams. The housing and zoning processes are crippled by over-bureaucratisation.\n\nParticularly telling was the City’s reaction to the homeless at the beginning of the epidemic. They shunted them off to a camp that they erected in Strandfontein – suitably out of sight. Did this facilitate handwashing, social distancing and the wearing of masks? Quite the contrary. It was a give-away of their attitude: get the poor out of “our” city. The poor are Capetonians, the very people the city should be serving. As if more evidence of their motives were needed, they took the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to court when the SAHRC appointed monitors to track the City’s responses regarding homeless and vulnerable groups during the epidemic. The City criticised the monitors and alleged that they were trying to spread misinformation. Now that is a useful allegation when you disagree with what someone is saying, whether it is the truth or not, a point made by Mr Justice Siraj Desai himself during the virtual hearing. He also noted that it was unusual for an organ of state to seek an interdict against a constitutionally mandated guardian of democracy. The City seems to imagine it can operate as a law unto itself. With breath-taking arrogance, they were actually trying to circumscribe the core functions of the SAHRC! It became clear that they would have to provide proof of their allegations, and lo and behold, they withdrew the application they had so carefully, and expensively, drawn up. These points were made by Advocate Norman Arendse, for the SAHRC.\n\nOf course, Cape Town is not the only city that has been battling Covid-19 problems, but my point is that it claims to be a world-class city, ideal for tourists. Its beauty is spectacular, but it turns a blind eye to sections of the community. Recently, a primary school principal complained that he could not even get a fence erected around the school for the children’s safety, while other provincial schools were receiving far more elite deliveries. We are educating our children, all our children, for our future – this should absolutely not be done on a preferential basis.\n\nAccording to the government statistician, Johannesburg has made better use of the time since Apartheid ended, and is the most integrated city of South Africa’s six major metros. Here is what a chartered financial analyst, Tinyiko Ngwenya, wrote in Fin24 in May 2018, after returning to Johannesburg from Cape Town. He had enjoyed positive experiences, but, in the circumstances, he asked, “How do you convince a child in Khayelitsha that they, too, can achieve financial freedom? … I truly hope that my generation will be the last to experience what I felt while living in Cape Town, and that the city will transform to be a proudly South African city – one that is well integrated and diverse.”\n\nThe city needs long-term planning in favour of the working classes. The City owns huge tracts of inner city land that could be used to solve the problem of over-crowded shack towns. The people of Cape Town deserve more than rhetoric.\n\nWhat enlightened employers, I thought when I heard that their domestic worker lived in their house with them, and not in servant’s quarters. Now their parents were coming from overseas for a two-week holiday, so they were booking her into our Air BnB round the corner for that time. They forgot to mention her name.\n\nShe stepped out of her employers’ car on arrival, huge and stately, carrying herself with aplomb. Her hair was beautifully plaited and arranged mainly on one side of her head. In South Africa one needs to mention – none of them was white. When I stepped towards her, she touched my shoulder and inclined her head towards me. I felt an enormous need for acceptance, warmth. Her name was Grace.\n\nTwo days passed, and I didn’t see her. She was gone when I got up at 7, and came home after I’d taken Irang out for her last wee walk at 9pm. When she came home on the third day, still looking groomed, I mentioned that she was working hard. “Yes, my schedule is hectic,” she smiled, so dignified. Hectic? I thought. It’s exploitive, and now I know why they want you in the house. But I bit my tongue because I’m running the BnB for someone else. Don’t stir.\n\nThe next day Puseletso, our house helper two days a week, was scheduled to clean that room and change the sheets and towels. However, she came to me to announce, “I can’t clean that room. It’s too untidy. Clothes everywhere. And she’s only slept on the sheets for two nights, so she’s all right.” Now Puseletso is experienced and I’m a stand-in. Also, when I’m taken by surprise, I tend to react on the lenient side, a fact which my children exploited brilliantly. So I didn’t say, No it’s three nights, or Let me check with the owner. I said, “Oh. All right then.”\n\nThe next cleaning day was Thursday, which was Human Rights Day. Puseletso would not be working, of course, but of course Grace was. So I was on cleaning duty, and when I went into Grace’s room, I saw what Puselesto had meant. It looked as if a bomb had hit it, but I tackled it with determination. Pick up one tissue at a time, I thought. Fold the clothes and put them in piles on the desk – blouses, underwear, socks.. The really dirty clothes were in the laundry basket – it was full. I didn’t think about it. Too much to do. Ah, here’s the lid for that open jar of cream. Ah, this must be the net that keeps her gorgeous hair in place while she is sleeping. Another plastic shopping bag with left-over KFC. It was clear to me that she took all her rage out on her own body. I told myself not to judge. With hours like that, all she could do was eat take-aways for comfort and drop into bed to sleep at night.\n\nEventually the towels and linen were on the washing line and I could vacuum and dust. I brought the fresh sheets and made the bed; replaced the towels. Now that looks welcoming, I thought. She deserves it.\n\nThen my eye fell on the corner of the laundry basket sticking out from under the bed. Our policy is that guests may use the washing machine. We show them the ropes, and it’s over to them. That works well with vacationing Parisians, but when would I show her? When would she do it? I remembered my childhood – there was always a black woman to pick up after me, do our laundry, cook our dinners… Mom never expected them to work hours like Grace’s, and we were taught to be respectful and say please and thank you. Big deal. Where were her kids? I had never asked. And this was Human Rights Day.\n\nI took the basket to the scullery and put on another load of washing, hung it out and folded it neatly when it was dry. Thank you for the chance to pay it forward for one day. I hoped she wouldn’t be too grateful. I wanted her to be the madam – this was my Madam and Eve moment, I smiled to myself. It occurred to me that she would not know what usually happened at an Air BnB; how should she?\n\nIndeed, when I saw her that evening and mentioned, “I didn’t iron any of your laundry,” the queen could not have been more gracious. “Never mind, dear. I appreciate it.”\n\nThat weekend I was out for much of Saturday morning. When I got back, I heard Grace talking in the kitchen area; I thought she was on her phone. I’d been looking forward to a swim, so I put on my swimsuit, wrapped a towel around myself and headed through the dining room towards the pool. Around the dining room table were five people. Grace happily introduced me to her two sisters, brother-in-law and niece. We had a pleasant chat and I went for my swim. While I was swimming, I remembered that one of the house rules the owner had mentioned was No Visitors. I’m not suited to doing this job, I thought. Surprised again, and too lenient again, but what should I have said? Walking back, I exchanged pleasantries again and noticed the glasses of sugary cooldrink, KFC boxes and more all spread out for their little party. Back in my room I worried. Could Grace think the Air BnB services included this kind of cleaning up? If they did clean up themselves, would they use the recycling bin properly?\n\nI was still wondering how I would deal with the situation when I fell asleep. I woke up to a roar. Good heavens, that sounded like our vacuum cleaner. Yes, for sure, and it got so close to my door that Irang gave a protective yap. Grace must be vacuuming the entire house. She must have, like the pro she is, easily found the vacuum cleaner in the owner’s linen cupboard and taken it out to use. Wow! When I’d changed, I went to make a cup of tea. First, the dining room – oh great; spotless. The glass on the table shining without a smudge. What about the kitchen? Ditto. I opened the waste and recycling bins – nothing. The visitors had taken all the scraps and litter away with them. Bless their hearts. Grace is never going to hear from me that visitors are not allowed, I vowed. She had mentioned that they hadn’t had a chance to see one another for the longest time. I realised how ugly my thoughts had been, that she might not clean up when she had a chance. Shame on me.\n\nNext Thursday I will do her laundry again, although Puseletso will object. I am so grateful for the day that Grace came into my life and heart."
