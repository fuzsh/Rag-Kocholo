Template:Infobox Kibbutz

Ramot Menashe (Template:Lang-he, lit. Menashe Heights) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located on the Menashe plateau between the Carmel mountain range and the Jezreel Valley, it falls under the jurisdiction of Megiddo Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 468.

History[]

The kibbutz was established in 1948 on the ruins of Sabbarin, an abandoned Arab village. The founders were immigrants from Poland and Austria, some of whom were Holocaust survivors who had participated in ghetto uprisings against the Nazis. Throughout its existence, Ramot Menashe has received members from, among others, Argentina, Romania, Chile, Uruguay and Israel - all of which are, like the original founders, were members of the socialist Zionist movement Hashomer Hatzair.

Economy[]

The most important sources of income for the kibbutz are the production of water meters (which are manufactured in co-operation with neighbouring kibbutz Dalia), micro-encapsulated products, various crops such as mango, avocado and cotton, poultry, sheep and dairy farming. The kibbutz also runs a bed and breakfast and part of a nearby shopping mall.

Numerous facilities are available to the inhabitants of the kibbutz. These include the communal dining hall, children's daycare, a laundry service, two small shops stocking day-to-day necessaries, a swimming pool, an archaeological museum, a post office, a café and weekly film shows at kibbutz Ein HaShofet.

Ramot Menashe also has its own disco - Terminal. It is typically open three times a week - each time attracting guests from both in- and outside the kibbutz.
