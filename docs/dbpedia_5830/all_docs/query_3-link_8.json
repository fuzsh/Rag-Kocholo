        "text": "Location: Around 3 kilometers south of Ein HaShofet Junction, Route no. 672, between kilometer markers 15 and 16.\n\nCaution: Because of this road’s unbroken central line, the recreation area can be entered only from the south, i.e., from the direction of Galed, and it can be exited only in a northerly direction.\n\nCarpets of cyclamen: A great many cyclamens can be found among the eucalyptus trees there. To discover really impressive concentrations, walk northwards from the entrance to the forest, along the trail that accompanies Route no. 672. After about half a kilometer you will arrive at a stand of pine trees, and there you will find a large concentration of cyclamens.\n\nThis forest is dedicated to the memory of Joop Westerweel (1899-1944), a teacher from the Netherlands, a devout Christian and pacifist, who, together with his companions, founded during the Second World War the \"Zionist Pioneers\" pioneering Zionist resistance movement that used only non-violent means.\n\nUnder his aegis the movement conveyed about one hundred and fifty Jews from the Netherlands across the Belgian and French borders, and from there over the Pyrenees to Spain. While the war was still raging, a group of seventy pioneers arrived at the coast of the Land of Israel.\n\nMany members of the resistance movement, both Jews and Gentiles, paid with their lives for their struggle against the Nazis. Joop Westerweel was apprehended, and he was executed at the Vught concentration camp on August 11th, 1944. In 1947 KKL-JNF planted a forest in his honor at this site.\n\nThe forest contains monuments to the memory of Jewish and Christian Dutch Resistance activists who sacrificed their lives to save the pioneers. A path edged with curbstones leads between the memorials. At the end of the path, on a south-facing slope, stands the memorial to Joop Westerweel, at a point that offers a view of the upper reaches of Nahal Taninim, the hills of Ramot Menashe and the Samarian Hills.\n\nLocation: About 600 meters to the north of the entrance to Kibbutz Galed, Route no. 672, adjacent to kilometer marker 13. You can park in the large open area to the west of the road.\n\nTo reach Cyclamen Hill, carefully cross Route no. 672 in an easterly direction and walk along the marked trail towards the pine grove – a distance of about 150 meters. KKL-JNF has provided signposts on the hill and has constructed a circular trail that allows visitors to make their way round the site easily. The trail climbs up wooden steps at the edge of the planted forest before making its way into the woodland. The cyclamens peep out from every side, though not in such profusion as in the past. Further on, the trail crosses through the woodland and descends the hill on the other side. You can return to your vehicle along the dirt road at the foot of the hill.\n\nVisitors who find climbing difficult can miss out the section with the wooden steps and enjoy the sight of the cyclamen flowers from the dirt road at the foot of the hill.\n\nDeparture point: The dirt road that branches off to the east of Route no. 672, about 200 meters to the north of the Galed Cyclamen Hill parking lot.\n\nFinishing point: The Ein HaShofet to Mishmar HaEmek highway (Route no. 6953), near Joara.\n\nCaution: Part of the route passes through an IDF firing range. On Shabbat the road is open, and is safe to travel through.\n\nThis stretch of the scenic route can be negotiated in a private car even after rainfall, but great caution should be exercised. The route is indicated by green arrows marked on posts erected by KKL-JNF. After about 600 meters you will see on the left the monument that indicates the site where Kibbutz Galed was founded. Three and a half kilometers further on the trail passes close by Ein Kfar, a spring that flows all year round, providing water for the cattle that graze in the area. After another 2.2 kilometers the trail arrives at a junction where there is a right turn to the impressive memorial that commemorates fallen kibbutz members and overlooks the expanses of the Jezreel Valley and the surrounding hills. From the junction the trail continues northwards until it reaches Route no. 6953 beside Juara.\n\nThose who wish to continue further along the scenic route should cross the road and drive via Nahal Gahar to the Yokneam-Megiddo highway (Route no. 66). This route leads you through the landscapes of HaZorea Forest, one of the first forests planted by KKL-JNF, and meets up with the road slightly to the south of Kibbutz HaZorea."
