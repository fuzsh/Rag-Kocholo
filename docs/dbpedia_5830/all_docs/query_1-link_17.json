        "text": "9\n\nAmerican Jewish Settlement on Jewish National Fund Lands\n\nI was reminded of having sat on the floor in discussion with the youth of Hashomer Hatzair in such places as Brooklyn, The Bronx, Boston, Detroit, Montreal, and Toronto, when we talked with American young newcomers on the floor of a tent in Mishmar Ha’emek, and I had an opportunity to learn the traditional experiences of these young people from the Western world. They had now been here about a year. Young city dwellers had been changed by the training they had received into pioneer workers on the land; I recognized the transformation worked in their lives by the clear-cut purpose which they had made their own.\n\nNo longer pale city dwellers, their bronzed young faces glowed in the light of the single oil lamp hanging from the tent pole; their eyes shone with the inner light seemingly characteristic of all the halutzim of Palestine. They had fully accepted their rigorous discipline and training needed to reach their chosen goal, and were [as] intent on meeting the tests as any young Americans trying out for college baseball teams or Olympic trials.\n\nIrma Lindheim, Parallel Quest: A Search of a Person and a People\n\nAmerican Jewish settlement was not limited to privately owned lands. Certain groups received financial support through the Jewish National Fund (JNF, or Keren Kayemet L’Yisrael) in the form of land, and assistance for development of settlements through the Keren Hayesod (Palestine Foundation Fund). Under the Herut Plan, the JNF cultivated a program for the settlement of middle-class American Jews on JNF land with amelioration underwritten by the settlers themselves. In other cases, American Jews were settled on JNF land and received financial support for the settlement from such bodies as the Keren Hayesod. American groups involved in this development process included the Jewish Legionnaires and halutzim of Hashomer Hatzair, Habonim, and other pioneer organizations.\n\nMIDDLE-CLASS SETTLEMENT ON JEWISH NATIONAL FUND LANDS\n\nUnlike the ahuza societies and their offshoots, which were forms of private investment, the Jewish National Fund attempted to combine private and national capital. JNF land would be leased for forty-nine years to middle-class settlers; the agricultural company Yakhin would prepare the plots, planting orange groves for the settlers who would eventually immigrate to Palestine.\n\nAkiva Ettinger, as head of the Land Acquisition Department of the Jewish National Fund, proposed in September 1931 a scheme for settling American families in Emek Hefer. At this time, a growing number of Americans were interested in settling in Palestine, for the Great Depression induced the fear that whatever capital they possessed would be lost if it wasn’t invested carefully. Palestine was enjoying an economic boom, and the American dollar had greater buying power there than in the U.S. Ettinger apparently wanted to cash in on the available capital by directing it to the development of JNF lands and providing employment for Jewish workers. By 1931 the fund’s land reserve had expanded considerably through the Haifa Bay, Emek Hefer, and Tel Mond purchases. American capital should thus be used to replace some of the Keren Hayesod funding for the development of these lands. Ettinger’s proposal was forwarded to the Zionist Organization of America with a request that the scheme be adopted without investigation or delay. Nevertheless, there were doubts about the feasibility of Ettinger’s plan. Criticism was leveled on two planes, economic and social. The expert opinion of the president of the Farmers Union (Hitachdut Haikarim), Moshe Smilansky, was solicited, and he concluded that the plan was “far from being suitable.” He declared that fifteen, not eight dunams, were needed to support a family; the settlers’ inexperience would raise the planting costs; the production of export-quality citrus fruit was overestimated; and other expenses were underestimated. All in all, Smilansky estimated that £P2,000—not £P860 as Ettinger had proposed—would be required to settle an American family.1 Emanuel Mohl, an American engineer who had been involved in various development projects in Palestine for a decade, emphasized the very serious problem of malaria, for which there was no means of eradication. He also stressed the need for Americans to be fully prepared. Mohl recommended Pardes Hannah on the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association’s land as a preferable location for the settlement of middle-class American Jewish families. Similarly, when Yehoshua Hankin, Victor Cohen, and I. Rosenfeld of the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association, Harry Vitales, Robert D. Kesselman, Israel Shochat, Dr. A. I. Kastelianski, and Joseph Nahmani were asked for their opinions, not one of these experts lent his approval to the scheme.2\n\nAt the time Ettinger was advancing his proposal, the future of the citriculture was also being questioned. According to Revusky, some local experts had expressed grave concern regarding the ability of European markets to absorb a greatly increased citrus export, and they warned against further expansion of citrus plantations in Palestine. The most pessimistic among them even envisioned serious difficulty in marketing oranges and grapefruit once the already existing plantations reached full productivity. This view was explicitly communicated to the American Economic Committee for Palestine. In a memorandum to Rehabiah Lewin-Epstein, A. Barroway wrote: “We have had a number of conferences with Mr. Vitales about encouraging Americans to continue to plant new orange groves. … I need only tell you that Mr. Vitales and his associates are not optimistic about the prompt solution of the marketing difficulty and in view of this difficulty, they are hesitant about encouraging further cultivation of new orchards, especially where the investor will be dependent upon his income at an early date for a livelihood.”3\n\nBeyond the question of the profitability of orchards was the great amount of misleading information that traversed the Atlantic. Avraham Moshe Koller, the Yakhin representative in America, complained about the “disparity” between the expectations of the various cultivating organizations. The New York Achooza Aleph quoted a cultivation cost of £P40 per dunam, excluding initial land purchase and boring wells but including irrigation installation. This low figure made it impossible for Yakhin to compete effectively, for the public had been led to expect they could contract for labor at a much lower price than Yakhin set. Other confusing quotations existed in advertisements. Rabbi Yehuda Leib Zlotnick’s organization Boaz advertised in a Yiddish newspaper, the Montreal Adler, that for a mere Can$3,600 a family could settle happily on an orange grove in Palestine. Furthermore, a controversy was raging in the Yiddish newspapers as a result of Revusky’s article calling for regulation of activities. Koller had asked the American Economic Committee for Palestine to intervene in the controversy. The committee planned to make a public statement, based on a consensus of opinion, regarding costs, returns, and minimum requirements for an average American family.4 On this issue, Louis Brandeis had already explained to Ettinger:\n\nBrandeis concluded, “It is good to know also from you of the favorable economic conditions of Palestine, relative to the rest of the world. I trust this may continue, and draw from America many middle-class Jews who would be happier and useful in Palestine.”6\n\nYakhin subsequently developed its own scheme, known as the Herut Plan, for middle class settlement.\n\nThree settlements were organized under this scheme: in 1931, Herut Aleph (later Tzofit), consisting of twenty families; in 1932, Herut Bet (later Bet Herut), for sixty-five families; and in 1933, Herut Gimmel, which was to consist of fifty families. Herut Aleph and Bet provided ten dunams for each of the settlers; both communities had non-American as well as American members. Herut Gimmel, located adjacent to Herut Bet, was designed specifically for North Americans, with twenty dunams to be supplied for each holding.\n\nDespite the anticipated numbers, only fifty-nine North American Jewish families actually signed contracts for these three settlements. No Americans ever settled at Herut Gimmel. Only five or six American families settled in Herut Aleph (Tzofit).8 Molly Lyons Bar-David, resident in neighboring Gan Hasharon, developed strong social ties with the Americans in this colony and described their settlement: “Zofit planted a mile-long boulevard of magnolia, leading from the gate to the end of their holding where one day the graveyard would be. Right now the clinic at the front of the land was the busy place. The settlers were young and all the wives were pregnant, and they were receiving prenatal care from their co-operative medical service.”9 By contrast, however, an American who had settled at Bet Herut asserted that this venture was unsuccessful “primarily because the chaverim who joined the group did not come to settle in Israel.”10\n\nIn 1933, Herut Bet members in the United States held a meeting in Chelsea, Michigan, to discuss the future of their settlement. The groves had not yielded sufficiently to provide for their minimum needs. A majority of members were in favor of transforming the settlement into a moshav shitufi, but a minority prevented this change. It was decided instead that the members should deal directly with Yakhin. For this purpose, an office was opened in New York and a second in Minneapolis to serve the Midwest. A year later, a second conference at Cleveland approved the plan to change the settlement into a moshav shitufi, with two variations: families could construct houses according to their own specifications and finances, and two dunams adjacent to each house could be worked privately. This agreement represents a very early appearance of this type of settlement organization; the first moshav shitufi was founded at Kfar Hittim in the Lower Galilee in 1936.11\n\nA number of the children of Herut Bet members were sent to Palestine to train in agriculture. In 1939, along with some older members, they took on the responsibility of developing and administering the settlement for others in America. Before World War II, only six American families had settled in the colony. Following the war, however, the number increased to seventeen families.12 More Americans joined after Israel’s War of Independence, and in 1960 there were sixty members—half of whom were members of the American Habonim movement. Nibby Penn, an American settler, summarized the group’s achievement up to 1960: “Its story follows the pattern of a settlement that made its way in Israel to become one of the ‘showplaces.’ It has grown to a community with one thousand dunam of orange groves, two hundred and fifty of fishponds, one hundred of tropical fruits, four hundred dunam of field crops, vegetables, and grain, some thousands of turkeys and six thousand chickens, etc., with a large silk-screen printing plant and a woodworking factory.”13 The settlement was renamed Bet Herut, and today it has a population of 396.\n\nVarious groups in America hoped to receive some assistance for their settlement through Palestine national institutions. One such group from Chicago, calling itself the Chalutzim Organization, requested information from the Jewish National Fund in 1932. From the questions they asked, it appears that the group attempted to obtain JNF land and planned to use their own capital for its development. The basic concepts forwarded by this group for settlement appear similar to the Herat plan for middle-class American settlement, but with certain variations. The members of this group were interested in growing wheat, barley, and other field crops, and raising poultry and dairy cattle. They did not specify any interest in plantations. The questions show they were preoccupied with the quantity of land, its readiness for utilization, and its geographic location. Another deviation from the Herat plan was the fact that the membership of the Chalutzim Organization came from a single geographic area. Although this is similar to the ahuza plan, under the Herat plan members would come from throughout the North American continent. Not specified in the Chalutzim Organization’s proposals were details about using labor in Palestine for the amelioration of the land, and the period of time that would be needed to prepare the tracts.14\n\nThe Jewish National Fund responses to the Chalutzim group were favorable. Land for settlers with capital was available: “Such land is to be found in the region of the Haifa Bay which it is considered will be most suitable for your purposes. It is soil very favourable for growing cereals and vegetables and being in the vicinity of good communications, both by rail and road to the growing town of Haifa adds to its advantages.” The lands referred to were probably those the American Zion Commonwealth had sold to the JNF. As of 1932, the Haifa Bay area had been partially developed with only one settlement, Kiryat Haim. Land was thus available for additional colonies. However, members of the organization would have to fulfill certain conditions before they could be seriously considered: namely, they should have adequate financial resources and be qualified as agriculturalists.15 No further information has been found regarding the activities of this organization, nor indeed about any American group in the Haifa Bay area.\n\nJEWISH LEGIONNAIRE SETTLEMENT ON JEWISH NATIONAL FUND LAND\n\nThe story of the Jewish Legionnaire settlement is a decade-long saga about the establishment of these World War I veterans on the land. At the end of the war, various proposals were forwarded to facilitate the demobilization of American soldiers in Palestine. One avenue was through agricultural settlement, training those who possessed no previous experience and employing them as manual laborers in agricultural colonies, or directly settling Jewish Legionnaires who had farming experience. The Palestine Office negotiated with various kvutzot to accept demobilized Legionnaires into their ranks and give them agricultural training.16\n\nAmong the small-scale plans was one mentioned by American Legionnaire Samuel Levine. He explained to the Zionist Commission for Palestine his proposal for a small dairy near Jerusalem: “I have a small capital of $1,500 and 12 years of practical experience in dairy farming. I had some time ago a talk with Mr. Hershfield of Jerusalem about establishing a small dairy near Jerusalem by ex-soldiers of practical experience in dairying. He seemed to be interested himself in it and if conditions would be more favorable at present we might have had a chance right now.”17 However, current conditions were not appropriate for their scheme, and no information has been found as to whether Levine remained in Palestine and became engaged in dairy farming. Another failed attempt (described in chapter 6) was to find employment for one hundred Jewish Legionnaires, and possibly permanent settlement for them at Balfouria.\n\nIn February 1920, the Zionist Commission allocated £E4,800 for the maintenance of sixty ex-Legionnaires in the Upper Galilee for a period of eight months. Twenty veterans would go to Tel Hai, twenty to Kfar Giladi, and twenty to Hamara. The decision to send them to these particular settlements reflected a need to fill the political and military vacuum that had developed in that area. Britain and France had not agreed upon the demarcation line between their respective mandated territories. These three settlements were situated in no-man’s-land, and they were particularly vulnerable to attacks by local Arabs. Demobilized soldiers were deemed necessary for the defense of this area. Detailed information has not been found as to the national origin of the forces detached to these settlements, but among the defenders of Tel Hai were two American Legionnaires, Wolf (Zeev) Sharf and Jacob Toker, both of whom fell in battle on 1 March 1920.18\n\nSeveral large-scale plans for the agricultural settlement of Legionnaires were forwarded to the British authorities. Although these schemes were not specifically designed for Americans, it is likely that some would be part of any group of former soldiers. In 1919 and 1920 detachments of the Jewish Legion were camped at Rafiah and El Arish, and some dreamed of settling there. Shmuel Yavnieli designed a plan for settlement: “the founding of a new city on the coast at Rafiah, a large harbour beside it, road and rail connections to other cities.” When a request was made to settle there, the proponents were referred to other locations, as Rafiah and El Arish were not within the boundaries of the Palestine Mandate.19\n\nMore realistic proposals were forwarded as well. In June 1919 Akiva Ettinger penned a memorandum on the provision of land in Palestine for the settlement of Jewish ex-soldiers. He called on the British authorities to provide about 300,000 dunams to settle 1,000 ex-soldiers; the Zionist Organization would provide the capital for buildings and equipment. Ettinger justified this claim by pointing out that the provision of land for ex-servicemen had become policy in Great Britain and the Dominions—Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Without entering into great detail, he emphasized certain aspects of his plan. Colonies should have approximately 100 families each to allow for an economy of scale. He preferred that the colonies be established in close proximity to each other, and he particularly recommended southern Judaea as an area of settlement.20 Ettinger may have been concerned both to avoid isolated settlements that would be vulnerable to Arab attack and to create a contiguous zone of Jewish settlement.\n\nIn 1921 High Commissioner Sir Herbert Samuel promised to grant the demobilized soldiers government land in Palestine. Discussions were opened with the land commissioner in October. The inventory of government lands included 60,000 dunams in the Hula Valley, 600,000 in the Beit Shaan Valley, 60,000 in the vicinity of Jericho, 25,000 near Tel Arad, 36,000 around Beer Sheva, and 1,500,000 in other parts of the Negev. The Discharged and Demobilized Soldiers Association entered into negotiations for its membership of 2,000—although the actual number of would-be settlers was estimated to be between 200 and 300, a few of whom were Americans. (In the ranks of the 39th Battalion, for example, there were at least ten Americans with agricultural experience.21)\n\nLegionnaires and Jewish authorities preferred lands in either the north or the east, which were considered to have greater agricultural potential. Strategically, these areas would augment the defense of existing Jewish settlements in the vicinity against threats of attack from Syria and Trans-Jordan. The Land Commission clearly stated that it was prepared to lease certain government lands for settlement and intensive cultivation purposes, but only after a corporation would register and submit articles of association to the Legal Department for approval. It immediately ruled out the area of Beit Shaan because of the tenuous situation there: The government of Palestine was undergoing negotiations with sharecroppers over their rights to the land. In the end, discussions regarding the Jewish soldiers never led to any actual settlement. Among the problems were the choice of lands, financial backing for the project, and the procrastination of the British authorities. Ettinger’s plan, like many others, faded into oblivion.22\n\nAmong the Jewish Legionnaires were a number of graduates of the Baron de Hirsch Agricultural and Industrial School at Woodbine, New Jersey. Eight of them organized themselves, together with Eliezer Joffe and Melech Levine (already settled in Palestine), to form a colony.23 At a meeting held at the Mikveh Israel agricultural school in February 1919, discussion focused on the direction of the colony, including whether it should be a cooperative society. Eliezer Joffe, regarded as the initiator of the moshav ovdim concept, advocated his own viewpoint: “From my experience I can say that if each member will be compelled to be a partner, we will not succeed. Everyone must be independent, and when the need comes, if he wants to become a partner in the work, he can do so, but no compulsory partnership.”24 Melech Levine vehemently stated his opposition to the cooperative system based on his own previous experience: “Each and everyone individually will make a better success. It will be well to imitate the system of the American farmer.” He argued that cooperation or partnership bred jealousy and meanness and often led to the loss of initiative.25 Nonetheless, the four-point program that outlines the basic tenets of the group shows the influence of Joffe’s preference for a moshav ovdim:\n\n1. A modern diversified farm colony.\n\n2. The land should be bought by the Baron De Hirsch fund together with the [Jewish] National [F]und.\n\n3. The Colonies should operate the farms individually, but wherever co-operation is possible to do it on co-operative basis.\n\n4. The money for the purchase of the land should come from the Baron De Hirsch Fund and should be given on long term credit to be repaid with interest.26\n\nThe colonists hoped to attract fifty or more members.\n\nTheir appeals for financial assistance from the Baron de Hirsch Fund were not realized, however. They were told that since the deed of trust specifically earmarked monies for immigrants to America, trustees could not disperse funds for use outside American territory. Furthermore, it did not appear practical for the trustees to finance a project that was too far away to supervise.27 This decision brought an end to plans for the colony.\n\nNo agricultural settlement for the Jewish Legionnaires materialized during the first years following the war. Some of the demobilized soldiers found their way to existing settlements, while others were among the founders of new settlements. The ambition of some ex-Legionnaires was specifically to establish settlements similar to Pardes Hagdud (described in chapter 8). Various promises were made both in Palestine and the United States to assist in their colonization.\n\nIn America, two organizations were founded for this purpose: the Hagdud Haivri League and the American Palestine Settlers Association. The Hagdud Haivri League was incorporated under New York State law in November 1929, in reaction to the riots in Palestine a few months earlier. The League’s declared intention was:\n\nThe League further proposed the establishment of a Jewish self-defense system in Palestine. Their plans extended to a network of colonies in Palestine, possibly along the Jordan and Syrian frontiers. This would serve as a bulwark against Arab invasion across these frontiers and provide Palestine with a number of Jewish American pioneers engaged in constructive work.29 Apparently the organization did not receive the support to which it aspired. A Zionist leader in Wilmington, Delaware, Louis Topkis, shared his evaluation of the organization with Avraham Harzfeld: “I regret exceedingly to advise you that the American Ex Legionnaires Organization have no leadership and besides they cannot go out and raise $25,000, such as you state in your letter. In fact when I left America on July 15 I made arrangements with one of their men to go out to raise funds and up until the time that I came back they did not raise $1.00.”30\n\nThe American Palestine Settlers Association was established with a more specific purpose than the Hagdud Haivri League: the settlement of American Jews in Palestine. Turning to the Jewish Agency and the Jewish National Fund as well as to the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association, it looked for help in establishing two colonies. Each would consist of 100 members and be devoted to citrus growing. Furthermore, each member would receive 25 dunams, of which 10 were to be planted. The association anticipated that the JNF would provide the land, and it attempted to raise $1,000,000 through bonds or stocks, possibly under the rubric of the “Louis Marshall Colonization Fund,” to assist in financing the settlement. The colonists themselves would invest no less than 10 percent of the $1,000 cost of settling. To the dismay of the American Palestine Settlers Association, pledges collected in various American cities amounted to only $86,750. A questionnaire distributed among ex-Legionnaires revealed that 109 individuals desired to settle in Palestine: 72 in 1930, 22 in 1931, and 15 in 1932.\n\nAfter various delays, the first Jewish Legionnaire settlement was founded in 1933 (its name, Avihail [avi, “father”; and hail, “soldier”] reflected its population). In May 1930, the JNF had agreed in principle to grant a 2,000 dunam stretch of land in Emek Hefer to the association.31 However, it was not until August 1932 that the Jewish National Fund’s regional plan for Emek Hefer was completed. During the following months the land was surveyed and the exact boundaries of each settlement delineated. The plan allocated land for 100 settlers. However, problems in financing required gradual development of the colony: twenty families had settled by November 1933, another thirty were expected within a year-and-a-half, and the rest four years later.32 Although the land had been acquired from the Jewish National Fund, capital for the development of the tracts came from the settlers themselves. Those whose personal funds were insufficient were not eligible for assistance from the Keren Hayesod or the Jewish Agency. However, the Zionist Organization of America placed at the disposal of the Legionnaires $40,000 that had been bequeathed by Mrs. Rebecca Zundelowitz of Texas.33\n\nIn 1936 the population of Avihail reached 280. The 1,884 dunams received was divided into seventy-six farms. Since the tract was spread over areas with different soils, each farmer received land adjacent to his home, in the plantation zone, and in the field crop area. The colony was planted with 673 dunams of orchards, mainly citrus, and 350 dunams were cultivated with field crops. Not all the members resided in the colony. According to a list dated April 1936, there were at that time fifty-three families (fourteen of them North Americans) on the land at Avihail, and twenty-six families (seven of them North Americans) residing outside the settlement.34\n\nThe American Palestine Settlers Association had eighty-one members in 1938. Forty-four of them resided in Avihail, where they worked in agriculture and received loans from various national institutions. Thirty-seven lived outside Avihail in the city and earned their livelihoods from other enterprises; their land at Avihail was worked by others, and their property financed through private efforts. Eventually a dispute broke out between residents and nonresidents. In his description of the background to the dispute, Asher Sapir pointed out that the organization had not been founded on the basis of mutual interests. The only common denominator was service in the 38th, 39th, and 40th battalions of the Royal Fusilliers. As volunteers they had common moral and spiritual ideals. But there were significant discrepancies in economic, personal, and social standing among those who organized the cooperative agricultural endeavor and founded Avihail. While the organization’s members were attempting to obtain land and money for the development of the village, they worked together, more or less. Once their initial purpose was achieved and began to bear fruit, however, individuals became more interested in their private affairs, and thus disputes arose. These were resolved when the moshav’s institutions were reorganized, with one cooperative society for water and another for services—including security, education, health, and representation before the authorities. This agreement allowed those who had actually settled in Avihail to have greater control over its destiny.35\n\nThe Legionnaires’ struggles to develop an agricultural settlement in Palestine resulted not only in the establishment of Avihail, but also a private orchard colony, Pardes Hagdud, and a workers’ colony, Ein Haoved, which had also been established on JNF land. Eighteen workmen earned their livelihood in Pardes Hagdud, and in their spare time they tilled their own plots on the 350-dunam settlement of Ein Haoved.36 Avihail, Pardes Hagdud, and Ein Haoved were eventually integrated, and services available at Avihail were extended to the other two. Laborers from Ein Haoved were employed in the other two settlements. Two of the owners of Pardes Hagdud, Aaron Herr and Sam Friedlander, settled in Avihail. In 1946 the settlements of Avihail and Ein Haoved were united. Today, this moshav with 892 inhabitants is on the edge of the growing city of Netanya.\n\nSETTLEMENT OF HALUTZIM\n\nHalutzim represent a small proportion of the total American aliya, but they are a relatively well-documented group thanks to various histories and recorded recollections.37 In 1931 the Jewish Agency published statistical data for agricultural settlements to which it had given financial support in 1929. It listed the countries of origin of settlers and the types of settlement. Out of a total of 7,556 persons only fifteen (0.2 percent) were from America. (The term “America” probably included all of the Western Hemisphere, but mainly those from the United States.) The detailed information placed four Americans in cooperative groups (kvutzot) with a total population of 2,143; two in moshavim with a total population of 3,036; seven in supported settlements that comprised 849 people; none on girls’ farms, which housed 167 persons; none on Yemenite settlements, which had 1,255 inhabitants; two Americans among the ninety-three persons in various cooperative groups; and none among the thirteen at experimental stations.38 Both Americans’ absolute number and their proportion to the total population increased during the 1930s with the rise of the halutz movement in America.\n\nIn a 1944 article, Ben Halpern explained some of the background behind the concentration and spatial distribution of American halutzim:\n\nThe American halutzim came both individually and in groups. Those who arrived alone found various means of obtaining places in cooperative groups, although none of them was easy or simple. As is evident in the example of Lewis Jack Kamentzky and Morris Rosenstein, even the most ardent American settlers sometimes found it impossible to join a kibbutz: These two Americans reached Palestine in November 1925, and after four months, all their efforts ended in frustration.40 According to Saadia Gelb, an American halutz who later settled at Kfar Blum, 1929–39 was the decade of assimilation. The policy of the Young Poale Zion Alliance was “to go to Palestine and assimilate into the Yishuv. Going in groups was permissible but perpetuating a special American identity was not.” Some Americans were integrated into various kibbutzim, including Naan, Degania B, Ginnosar, Afikim, Ramat David, and Givat Brenner41 (see map 11).\n\nMost of the pioneers arrived in Palestine in groups. They had usually made arrangements beforehand, through affiliated organizations, to train or settle on a specific kibbutz. During World War I, American members of pioneer organizations reached Palestine as part of the Jewish Legion. Poale Zion members hoped to remain in Palestine after the war and play a part in developing Palestine, as members of either a collective or a kibbutz. As outlined earlier in this chapter, there was little support for the organized settlement of former Legionnaires, but some demobilized soldiers did join kibbutzim and moshavim.\n\nFollowing the war, entire groups of halutzim began to arrive. In July 1921, a group of twenty-two American Poale Zion members reached Palestine, among them Golda Meyersohn (Meir). She had hoped to join Kibbutz Merchavia because a friend from Milwaukee had gone there. Morris and Golda Meyersohn’s application was met with a curt response and deferred until September. The kibbutz twice voted against accepting them: “Not only because we were Americans, but because we were a married couple. The thirty-two men were all bachelors and they wanted single girls.”42 Other members of the Meyersohns’s group chose not to go to a collective settlement; they felt they were not prepared mentally or physically for such a change in lifestyle.\n\nThe first group of halutzim to undergo preparatory training in America was Kvutzat Gordonia from Philadelphia, founded in 1925. At the suggestion of Yosef Baratz of Degania A, nine members studied poultry farming for two years at Petaluma, California, in 1927. Five members migrated to Palestine in 1929 and remained together for two years as a kvutza. No information has been found as to where they eventually settled.43\n\nSubsequently other independent groups of halutzim left America for Palestine. One of these was the Detroit Kvutza, organized in 1927. During the first stage of preparation, the twelve members worked in their own trades; together they studied Hebrew as well as Zionist and Jewish history. In January 1930 they enrolled in a course at the Michigan State College of Agriculture at East Lansing. Their curriculum included general agriculture, poultry, dairy production and butter and cheese making, and farm engineering. From March until November 1930, the group trained at the Hightstown, New Jersey, farm operated by Hashomer Hatzair. Ten individuals departed for Palestine in December, and when they arrived, the Histadruth arranged for their entry into Kvutzat Hatzafon. A year later, upon receiving Jewish National Fund land in Emek Zevulun, the group from Detroit founded Kibbutz Ramat Yohanan.44 In 1932 another group, consisting of twenty-eight pioneers, set sail for Palestine; their destination was Degania B. Another group, seven members of Hechalutz Hatzair (the youth movement of Kibbutz Hameuchad), departed the following year, going first to Kinneret and then permanently settling at Afikim.45\n\nThe largest group of halutzim from America to settle in Palestine were from the ranks of the Hashomer Hatzair (see chapter 2). Its ideology stressed the necessity for members to establish themselves in collective settlements. The settlement process of American members of Hashomer Hatzair in Palestine was divided into three phases. First came absorption, training, and acclimatization in an established kibbutz. The second stage involved a period of waiting and consolidation on a small tract of land near an existing settlement—usually near colonies in the coastal plain that could provide employment for the kvutza members in orchards or in other jobs. The final phase was permanent settlement on Jewish National Fund land.\n\nIn 1931 a group of six American Hashomer Hatzair members reached Palestine and joined Kibbutz Aleph. The success of this group was considered extremely important for the future of the movement in America. Since they were small in number and too inexperienced to establish a kibbutz of their own, the group’s viability worried the Hashomer Hatzair Executive in Warsaw; it was suggested that they seek help from affiliated kibbutzim in absorption, training, and acclimatization. The group initially considered Mishmar Haemek, Karkur, and Merchavia, but as the first two were already engaged in the absorption of other groups, they were ruled out. Because Merchavia had considerable experience in absorbing new pioneers, it was deemed the most appropriate choice. The American group was divided, with four going to Mishmar Haemek and two proceeding with a kvutza from Mishmar Haemek to the Palestine Electric Corporation’s hydroelectric power plant at Naharaim.46\n\nThe following year the number of Americans at Mishmar Haemek increased to seventeen. Proposals were forwarded to allow this group to remain in the vicinity. Dr. Maurice Hexter, an American member of the Jewish Agency Executive, explored various avenues of increasing funding from the Colonization Department. At a 1932 meeting of the executive committee, he noted that “Each of the colonies receiving maintenance was more or less composed of homogeneous groups, most of whom had friends abroad who might be induced to grant them loans for the purpose of consolidation.” He continued, using the group of American halutzim at Mishmar Haemek as an example: “If they get a loan of say £6,000 we would be relieved of maintenance.” Chaim Arlosoroff, head of the Jewish Agency’s political department, opposed this “principle of Landsmanschaftliche assistance,” fearing that Diaspora communities would attempt to exercise too much control. Despite the opposition of Arlosoroff and Dr. Werner David Senator, “a decision was adopted by the Executive to accept Dr. Hexter’s suggestion and that he should be empowered to try and see what he could do in the way of getting such loans.”47 However, it appears that this system of financing colonization was not explored any further.\n\nBy 1933 there were thirty Americans at Mishmar Haemek, and the Hashomer Hatzair attempted to force the hand of various settlement bodies for the permanent establishment of its halutzim. It proposed that an amount raised above the yearly income of the JNF in the United States be used for that purpose. They suggested promoting increased donations to the JNF by using the slogan “Land for American Chalutzim” in fund-raising efforts. These extra funds would be used to purchase a 10,000-dunam strip of land between Mishmar Haemek and the archaeological site of Megiddo. (This tract appears to have been Khirbet El Mansi, later the site of the moshav Midrach Oz.) The site was attractive because of its potential for general and diversified farming, which suited the training that American halutzim had received. Furthermore, it was appropriate for the application of American methods and machinery.48 Irma Lindheim, a former president of American Hadassah and closely associated with the Hashomer Hatzair movement, was contacted to go to America to collect $100,000 for that purpose, but objections were raised to this fund-raising mission: “The principal objection is the fact that it represents an effort in behalf of one group in Zionist life. … Another objection … was that at the present time, when the situation of German Jewry is so urgent, every effort should be made for their settlement in Palestine.”49 Indeed, the fund-raising campaign was never conducted. Lindheim settled on kibbutz Mishmar Haemek and later became a member.\n\nIn 1934 the American halutzim left Mishmar Haemek for a 15-dunam tract of Jewish National Fund land near Hadera. This represented the second phase of the group’s settlement process. Together with a group from Poland, they worked as hired labor in the moshava of Hadera while they awaited their turn for land to be allocated to them for settlement. This period also served the additional purpose of consolidating the group. Over the years the number of Americans increased to fifty-three. They remained at Hadera until July 1937, when the first members established themselves at the settlement site of Juara in the Samaritan mountains, later known as Ein Hashofet.50 Its name (Heb. spring of the judge) was in honor of the American Zionist leader Judge Louis D. Brandeis. He had retained strong connections with the American settlers and personally provided them with financial assistance.\n\nWhile this group remained in Hadera, American Yiddish journalist Abraham Revusky held intimate talks with them. Revusky was “strongly impressed by the idealistic spirit of these young men and women, nearly all high school graduates or college students, who came to participate personally in the building of a new country under the still-trying conditions of Palestine.”51 In 1943 the population of Juara reached 299, with 4,500 dunams of land. By 1947, the kibbutz’s economy was based on mixed farming (cereals, fodder, vegetables, fruits, dairy, poultry, sheep, and bees) and contract trucking (six trucks for transportation between Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem); it also had shares in Hever—the Haifa urban and suburban bus cooperative.52 Today Ein Hashofet has 799 inhabitants.\n\nIn 1935 the second group of American Hashomer Hatzair members, fourteen in number, began their settlement process in Kibbutz Ein Shemer. Known as Kibbutz Bet, this group continued on to Hadar in the southern Sharon at the end of 1936 to join the Polish group Krit for a three-month trial period. The original intent of the American group was to achieve independent existence through reinforcements from America. However, in light of the difficulties in obtaining immigration certificates, it was deemed best by the group already in Palestine and the Vaad Hapoel of the Hashomer Hatzair movement that the American and Polish groups unite. Their temporary kibbutz in Hadar was founded on 8 dunams belonging to the Jewish National Fund, and an additional 30 dunams were leased. The period at Hadar consisted of work in the citrus plantations of adjacent colonies as well as in the carpentry workshop, in construction, transportation, on a small dairy farm, and other outside labor.53\n\nThe process of choosing a site for America-Krit began in 1938. Information regarding all the options considered and the decisions that led to the choice of the final location is incomplete. However, it appears that one possibility was at Hanita in the western Galilee. An expeditionary force of five members was sent to the place. They vied with other settlement organizations also interested in colonizing the land but did not succeed in receiving permission to remain. A second possibility was Um-es-Suf, a tract close to Kibbutz Ein Hashofet. Fifteen members were sent to secure the site, founding an outpost. Eight months were spent guarding the spot, while problems connected to ownership of the land obstructed settlement. The Palestine secretariat of Hashomer Hatzair hoped that the new kibbutz (which included the second American contingent) would be established near Ein Hashofet. They also hoped to influence Avraham Harzfeld to intervene in this direction, but to no avail.54\n\nAuthorities were eager to move the America-Krit group, if not near Ein Hashofet, then to the Beit Shaan Valley or near the Hula Basin. In 1939 American Jewish National Fund President Dr. Israel Goldstein explained, in a personal letter to Menachem Ussishkin, that the move “could give encouragement to this group of pioneers, who have proven their worth and who have a special significance as an American Kibbutz.” The lands of Khiam Walid, north of the Hula concession, and Rahania, northwest of Ein Hashofet, were also offered to the America-Krit group. But at the kibbutz meeting of 29 July 1939, a decision was made not to settle at either location.55\n\nFinally, with the failure of the Menachem Organization—a moshav in the southern Judaean foothills—lands were made available for the America-Krit kibbutz. This 3,650-dunam tract had been purchased in 1935. Two years later, a moshav was founded but was unable to sustain itself. On 6 December 1939, Kibbutz Kfar Menachem (named in honor of Menachem Ussishkin) was established as a tower and stockade colony with thirty-two Americans.56 In 1943 it had 245 inhabitants. Its economy was based on mixed farming (grains, vegetables, cattle, sheep, and poultry) and industry (carpentry shop and garage). Today Kfar Menachem has a population of 605.\n\nA third American Hashomer Hatzair group was organized in 1937, but its arrival in Palestine was delayed until after World War II. In the autumn of 1945,62 North American members of this group arrived in Palestine, joining a group of Palestinian and Bulgarian Jews to found Kibbutz Hatzor.57\n\nAmerican halutzim affiliated with Hechalutz, Habonim, and the Young Poale Zion Alliance arrived in Palestine in 1938 and 1939, and began their own venture toward settlement. The process included several months of training in existing kibbutzim—Ramat David and Afikim. These Americans joined together with an Anglo-Baltic group situated at Binyamina and waited to be assigned a site for permanent settlement. They worked at the farms at Binyamina, the quarry there, and the saltworks at Atlit. They also entered the timber industry, cutting planks and preparing firewood. In addition, they purchased machinery to produce clothes-pegs. In 1943, with money raised by the Jewish labor movement in America, the Jewish National Fund purchased the lands of Naame on behalf of this group. On 13 November 1943, the cornerstone was laid for the first building of the new kibbutz for the American and Anglo-Baltic groups. Named Kfar Blum, in honor of French Jewish Zionist Léon Blum, its initial population was 157, with 800 dunams of land. During its first year, the kibbutz raised cereals, vegetables, fodder, cattle, and sheep, later adding bees and poultry. The clothespin factory was transferred to the kibbutz, and its location on the banks of the Jordan north of the Hula swamp allowed for the development of fish ponds.58 Kfar Blum has grown to a settlement of 615 residents.\n\nHaluztiut, the pioneer spirit—an idea that motivated thousands from Eastern Europe to immigrate and build Palestine—likewise inspired a few hundred Americans. Immediately after World War I, the movement represented only a small volume, but it greatly increased in number during the 1930s. The magnitude of the population mass and their ideologies, coupled with the policies of various settlement organizations and movements, determined the spatial distribution of American pioneers. The involvement of American Zionist organizations in trying to facilitate the process for local constituents was unique in the settlement of Palestine. Beyond having an interest in the settlement of their halutzim, these organizations believed that their actions would be to their own benefit by encouraging fund-raising and local involvement. The founding of the first collective settlement to include an American group represented a turning point in the American pioneering effort. The ensuing publicity generated prestige and inspired greater activity. It is also important to note with regard to spatial distribution of American pioneers that while efforts were made to create a regional concentration of these settlers in the Carmel and Menashe hills, circumstances connected to the availability of Jewish National Fund land led to the dispersion of kibbutzim with American members throughout Palestine.\n\nMolly Lyons Bar-David has pointed to one significant contribution to the kibbutz movement by Americans:"
