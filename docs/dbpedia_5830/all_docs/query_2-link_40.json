Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has witnessed significant changes in its demographics. Formed as a homeland for the Jewish people, Israel has attracted Jewish immigrants from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.\n\nThe Israel Central Bureau of Statistics defines the population of Israel as including Jews living in all of the West Bank and Palestinians in East Jerusalem but excluding Palestinians anywhere in the rest of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and foreign workers anywhere in Israel. As of December 2023, this calculation stands at approximately 9,842,000 of whom:\n\n73.2% (about 7,208,000 people) are Jews, including about 503,000 living outside the self-defined borders of the State of Israel in the West Bank\n\n21.1% (around 2,080,000 people) are Israeli citizens classified as Arab, some identifying as Palestinian, and including Druze, Circassians, all other Muslims, Christian Arabs, Armenians (which Israel considers \"Arab\")[2]\n\nAn additional 5.7% (roughly 554,000 people) are classified as \"others\".

There is also a very high population growth rate among certain Jewish groups, especially adherents of Orthodox Judaism. The growth rate of the Arab population in Israel is 2.2%, while the growth rate of the Jewish population in Israel is 1.8%. The growth rate of the Arab population has slowed from 3.8% in 1999 to 2.2% in 2013, and for the Jewish population, the growth rate declined from 2.7% to its lowest rate of 1.4% in 2005. Due to a rise in fertility of the Jewish population since 1995 and immigration, the growth rate has since risen to 1.8%.[33]\n\nFertility\n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) of a population is the average number of children that an average woman would have, in her lifetime.\n\n3.01 children born/woman (2019)\n\nJewish total fertility rate increased by 10.2% during 1998–2009, and was recorded at 2.90 during 2009. During the same time period, Arab TFR decreased by 20.5%. Muslim TFR was measured at 3.73 for 2009, and 2.9 for 2022.[34]\n\nIn 2000, the Jewish and Arab TFRs in Jerusalem were 3.79 and 4.43 respectively. By 2009, the Jewish TFR in Jerusalem was measured higher than the Arab TFR (2010: 4.26 vs 3.85, 2009: 4.16 vs 3.87). As of 2021, the Jewish and Arab TFRs in Jerusalem were 4.4 and 3.1 respectively.[35] TFR for Arab residents in the West Bank was measured at 2.91 in 2013,[36] while that for the Jewish residents was reported at 5.10 children per woman.[37]\n\nThe ethnic group with highest recorded TFR is the Bedouin of Negev. Their TFR was reported at 10.06 in 1998, and 5.73 in 2009. TFR is also very high among Haredi Jews. For Ashkenazi Haredim, the TFR rose from 6.91 in 1980 to 8.51 in 1996. The figure for 2008 is estimated to be even higher. TFR for Sephardi/Mizrahi Haredim rose from 4.57 in 1980 to 6.57 in 1996.[38] In 2020 the overall Jewish TFR in Israel (3.00) was for the first time measured higher than Arab Muslim TFR (2.99).\n\nAs of 2022, the fertility rates in Israeli cities dominated by specific demographic groups were: Haredi 6.1, Bedouin 4.4, Jewish non-Haredi 2.4, Arab 2.2, Druze 1.8.[34]\n\nYear Jews Muslims Christians Druze Others Total 2000 2.66 4.74 2.55 3.07 2.95 2001 2.59 4.71 2.46 3.02 2.89 2002 2.64 4.58 2.29 2.77 2.89 2003 2.73 4.50 2.31 2.85 2.95 2004 2.71 4.36 2.13 2.66 1.47 2.90 2005 2.69 4.03 2.15 2.59 1.49 2.84 2006 2.75 3.97 2.14 2.64 1.55 2.88 2007 2.80 3.90 2.13 2.49 1.49 2.90 2008 2.88 3.84 2.11 2.49 1.57 2.96 2009 2.90 3.73 2.15 2.49 1.56 2.96 2010 2.97 3.75 2.14 2.48 1.64 3.03 2011 2.98 3.51 2.19 2.33 1.75 3.00 2012 3.04 3.54 2.17 2.26 1.68 3.05 2013 3.05 3.35 2.13 2.21 1.68 3.03 2014 3.11 3.35 2.27 2.20 1.72 3.08 2015 3.13 3.32 2.12 2.19 1.72 3.09 2016 3.16 3.29 2.05 2.21 1.64 3.11 2017 3.16 3.37 1.93 2.10 1.58 3.11 2018 3.17 3.20 2.06 2.16 1.54 3.09 2019 3.09 3.16 1.80 2.02 1.45 3.01 2020 3.00 2.99 1.85 1.94 1.35 2.90 2021 3.13 3.01 1.77 2.00 1.39 3.00 2022 3.03 2.91 1.68 1.85 1.26 2.89 Year Jews Muslims Christians Druze Others Total\n\nBirth rate\n\n2021 :\n\nTotal: 19.7 births/1,000 population\n\nJews and others: 19.1 births/1,000 population\n\nMuslims: 23.4 births/1,000 population\n\nChristians: 13.3 births/1,000 population\n\nDruze: 15.8 births/1,000 population\n\nBirths, in absolute numbers, by mother's religion[39]\n\nBirth rates of various Israeli peoples[40] Year Jewish Muslim Christian Druze others Total # % # % # % # % # % 1996 83,710\n\n69.0%\n\n30,802\n\n25.4%\n\n2,678\n\n2.2%\n\n2,682\n\n2.2%\n\n1,461\n\n1.2%\n\n121,333 2000 91,936\n\n67.4%\n\n35,740\n\n26.2%\n\n2,789\n\n2.0%\n\n2,708\n\n2.0%\n\n3,217\n\n2.4%\n\n136,390 2005 100,657\n\n69.9%\n\n34,217\n\n23.8%\n\n2,487\n\n1.7%\n\n2,533\n\n1.8%\n\n4,019\n\n2.8%\n\n143,913 2006 104,513\n\n70.5%\n\n34,337\n\n23.2%\n\n2,500\n\n1.7%\n\n2,601\n\n1.8%\n\n4,219\n\n2.9%\n\n148,170 2007 107,986\n\n71.2%\n\n34,572\n\n22.8%\n\n2,521\n\n1.7%\n\n2,510\n\n1.7%\n\n4,090\n\n2.7%\n\n151,679 2008 112,803\n\n71.9%\n\n34,860\n\n22.2%\n\n2,511\n\n1.6%\n\n2,534\n\n1.6%\n\n4,215\n\n2.7%\n\n156,923 2009 116,599\n\n72.4%\n\n35,253\n\n21.9%\n\n2,514\n\n1.6%\n\n2,517\n\n1.6%\n\n4,159\n\n2.6%\n\n161,042 2010 120,673\n\n72.58%\n\n36,221\n\n21.79%\n\n2,511\n\n1.51%\n\n2,535\n\n1.52%\n\n4,306\n\n2.59%\n\n166,255 2011 121,520\n\n73.07%\n\n35,247\n\n21.19%\n\n2,596\n\n1.56%\n\n2,469\n\n1.48%\n\n4,457\n\n2.68%\n\n166,296 2012 125,409\n\n73.36%\n\n36,041\n\n21.08%\n\n2,610\n\n1.53%\n\n2,371\n\n1.39%\n\n4,492\n\n2.63%\n\n170,940 2013 126,999\n\n74.07%\n\n34,927\n\n20.37%\n\n2,602\n\n1.52%\n\n2,350\n\n1.37%\n\n4,561\n\n2.66%\n\n171,444 2014 130,576\n\n74.01%\n\n35,965\n\n20.38%\n\n2,814\n\n1.59%\n\n2,366\n\n1.34%\n\n4,697\n\n2.66%\n\n176,427 2015 132,220\n\n73.98%\n\n36,659\n\n20.51%\n\n2,669\n\n1.49%\n\n2,376\n\n1.33%\n\n4,792\n\n2.68%\n\n178,723 2016 134,100\n\n73.92%\n\n37,592\n\n20.72%\n\n2,613\n\n1.44%\n\n2,446\n\n1.35%\n\n4,652\n\n2.56%\n\n181,405 2017 134,630\n\n73.31%\n\n39,550\n\n21.53%\n\n2,504\n\n1.36%\n\n2,350\n\n1.28%\n\n4,609\n\n2.51%\n\n183,648 2018 135,809\n\n73.66%\n\n38,757\n\n21.02%\n\n2,721\n\n1.47%\n\n2,434\n\n1.32%\n\n4,639\n\n2.52%\n\n184,370 2019 133,243\n\n73.20%\n\n39,525\n\n21.71%\n\n2,409\n\n1.32%\n\n2,298\n\n1.26%\n\n4,532\n\n2.49%\n\n182,016 2020 129,884\n\n73.25%\n\n38,388\n\n21.65%\n\n2,497\n\n1.41%\n\n2,239\n\n1.26%\n\n4,290\n\n2.42%\n\n177,307 2021 136,120\n\n73.56%\n\n39,703\n\n21.46%\n\n2,434\n\n1.32%\n\n2,339\n\n1.26%\n\n4,432\n\n2.39%\n\n185,040 2022 132,771\n\n73.24%\n\n39,717\n\n21.91%\n\n2,331\n\n1.29%\n\n2,186\n\n1.21%\n\n4,257\n\n2.35%\n\n181,269 2023 131,024\n\n73.42%\n\n39,114\n\n21.92%\n\n2,189\n\n1.23%\n\n2,088\n\n1.17%\n\n4,032\n\n2.25%\n\n178,454\n\nBirths by mother's religion in January–June Jewish Muslim Christian Druze others total # % # % # % # % # % 2023 63,912\n\n73.68%\n\n18,755\n\n21.62%\n\n1,079\n\n1.24%\n\n1,020\n\n1.18%\n\n1,970\n\n2.27%\n\n86,739 2024 64,569\n\n74.66%\n\n18,229\n\n21.08%\n\n991\n\n1.15%\n\n952\n\n1.10%\n\n1,740\n\n2.01%\n\n86,485\n\nBetween the mid-1980s and 2000, the fertility rate in the Muslim sector was stable at 4.6–4.7 children per woman; after 2001, a gradual decline became evident, reaching 3.51 children per woman in 2011.

follows:\n\nJews\n\nMain article: Israeli Jews\n\nAccording to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2008, of Israel's 7.3 million people, 75.6 percent were Jews of any background.[51] Among them, 70.3 percent were Sabras (born in Israel), mostly second- or third-generation Israelis, and the rest are olim (Jewish immigrants to Israel)—20.5 percent from Europe and the Americas, and 9.2 percent from Asia and Africa, including the Arab countries.[52]\n\nAccording to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, in April 2023, of Israel's 9.7 million people, 73.5 percent, or 7.145 million, were Jews of any background.[53]\n\nThere are no government statistics categorizing Israeli Jews as \"Ashkenazi\", \"Mizrahi\", etc, but studies and estimates have been conducted.[54][55] In a 2019 study, in a sample meant to be representative of the Israeli Jewish population, about 44.9% percent of Israel's Jewish population were categorized as Mizrahi (defined as having grandparents born in North Africa or Asia), 31.8% were categorized as Ashkenazi (defined as having grandparents born in Europe, the Americas, Oceania and South Africa), 12.4% as \"Soviet\" (defined as having progenitors who came from the ex-USSR in 1989 or later), about 3% as Beta Israel (Ethiopia) and 7.9% as a mix of these, or other Jewish groups.[56] Note that this methodology isn't exact: See, for example, Bulgarian or Greek Jews, who would be categorized as Ashkenazi according to this definition, although they are overwhelmingly Sephardic.\n\nThe paternal lineage of the Jewish population of Israel as of 2015 is as

Palestine that remained within Israel's borders following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and the establishment of the State of Israel. It is including those born within the state borders subsequent to this time, as well as those who had left during the establishment of the state (or their descendants), who have since re-entered by means accepted as lawful residence by the Israeli state (primarily family reunifications).\n\nIn 2019, the official number of Arab residents in Israel was 1,890,000 people, representing 21% of Israel's population.[58] This figure includes 209,000 Arabs (14% of the Israeli Arab population) in East Jerusalem, also counted in the Palestinian statistics, although 98 percent of East Jerusalem Palestinians have either Israeli residency or Israeli citizenship.[59]\n\nArab Muslims\n\nMost Arab citizens of Israel are Muslim, particularly of the Sunni branch of Islam. A small minority are Ahmadiyya sect and there are also some Alawites (affiliated with Shia Islam) in the northernmost village of Ghajar with Israeli citizenship. As of 2019, Arab citizens of Israel composed 21 percent of the country's total population.[58] About 82 percent of the Arab population in Israel are Sunni Muslims, a very small minority are Shia Muslims, another 9 percent are Druze, and around 9 percent are Christian (mostly Eastern Orthodox and Catholic denominations).\n\nBedouin\n\nMain article: Israeli Bedouin\n\nThe Arab Muslim citizens of Israel include also the Bedouins, who are divided into two main groups: the Bedouin in the north of Israel, who live in villages and towns for the most part, and the Bedouin in the Negev, who include half-nomadic and inhabitants of towns and Unrecognized villages. According to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as of 1999, 110,000 Bedouins live in the Negev, 50,000 in the Galilee and 10,000 in the central region of Israel.[60] The vast majority of Arab Bedouins of Israel practice Sunni Islam.\n\nAhmadiyya\n\nThe Ahmadiyya community was first established in the region in the 1920s, in what was then Mandatory Palestine. There is a large community in Kababir, a neighborhood on Mount Carmel in Haifa.[61][62] It is unknown how many Israeli Ahmadis there are, although it is estimated there are about 2,200 Ahmadis in Kababir alone.[63]\n\nArab Christians\n\nAs of December 2013, about 161,000 Israeli citizens practiced Christianity, together comprising about 2% of the total population.[64] The largest group consists of Melkites (about 60% of Israel's Christians), followed by the Greek Orthodox (about 30%), with the remaining ca. 10% spread between the Roman Catholic (Latin), Maronite, Anglican, Lutheran, Armenian, Syriac, Ethiopian, Coptic and other denominations.[64]\n\nDruze\n\nMain article: Druze in Israel\n\nThe Arab citizens of Israel include also the Druze, who numbered at an estimated 143,000 in April 2019.[65] All of the Druze living in what was then British Mandate Palestine became Israeli citizens after the declaration of the State of Israel. Druze serve prominently in the Israel Defense Forces, and are represented in mainstream Israeli politics and business as well, unlike Muslim or Christian Arabs who are not required to and generally choose not to serve in the Israeli army. Though a few individuals identify themselves as \"Palestinian Druze\",[66] the vast majority of Druze do not consider themselves to be 'Palestinian', and consider their Israeli identity stronger than their Arab identity. A 2017 Pew Research Center poll reported that the majority of the Israeli Druze identified as ethnically Arab.[67]\n\nSyriac Christians\n\nArameans\n\nMain articles: Arameans in Israel and Maronites in Israel\n\nIn 2014, Israel decided to recognize the Aramaic community within its borders as a national minority, allowing some of the Christians in Israel to be registered as \"Aramean\" instead of \"Arab\".[68] As of October 2014, some 600 Israelis requested to be registered as Arameans, with several thousand eligible for the status – mostly members of the Maronite community.\n\nThe Maronite Christian community in Israel of around 7,000 resides mostly in the Galilee, with a presence in Haifa, Nazareth and Jerusalem. It is largely composed of families that lived in Upper Galilee in villages such as Jish long before the establishment of Israel in 1948. In the year 2000, the community was joined by a group of Lebanese SLA militia members and their families, who fled Lebanon after 2000 withdrawal of IDF from South Lebanon.\n\nAssyrians\n\nMain article: Assyrians in Israel\n\nThere are around 1,000 Assyrians living in Israel, mostly in Jerusalem and Nazareth. Assyrians are an Aramaic speaking, Eastern Rite Christian minority who are descended from the ancient Mesopotamians. The old Syriac Orthodox monastery of Saint Mark lies in Jerusalem. Other than followers of the Syriac Orthodox Church, there are also followers of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church living in Israel.\n\nOther citizens\n\nCopts\n\nSome 1,000 Israeli citizens belong to the Coptic community, originating in Egypt.\n\nSamaritans\n\nMain article: Samaritans\n\nThe Samaritans are an ethnoreligious group of the Levant. Ancestrally, they claim descent from a group of Israelite inhabitants who have connections to ancient Samaria from the beginning of the Babylonian Exile up to the beginning of the Common Era. 2007 population estimates show that 712 Samaritans live half in Holon, Israel and half at Mount Gerizim in the West Bank. The Holon community holds Israeli citizenship, while the Gerizim community resides at an Israeli-controlled enclave, holding dual Israeli-Palestinian citizenship.\n\nArmenians\n\nMain article: Armenians in Israel\n\nAbout 4,000 Armenians reside in Israel mostly in Jerusalem (including in the Armenian Quarter), but also in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jaffa. Armenians have a Patriarchate in Jerusalem and churches in Jerusalem, Haifa and Jaffa. Although Armenians of Old Jerusalem have Israeli identity cards, they are officially holders of Jordanian passports.[69]\n\nCircassians\n\nMain article: Circassians in Israel\n\nIn Israel, there are also a few thousand Circassians, living mostly in Kfar Kama (2,000) and Reyhaniye (1,000).[70] These two villages were a part of a greater group of Circassian villages around the Golan Heights. The Circassians in Israel enjoy, like Druzes, a status aparte. Male Circassians (at their leader's request) are mandated for military service, while females are not.\n\nPeople from post-Soviet states\n\nEthnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians, immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who were eligible to emigrate due to having, or being married to somebody who has, at least one Jewish grandparent and thus qualified for Israeli citizenship under the revised Law of Return. A number of these immigrants also belong to various ethnic groups from the Former Soviet Union such as Armenians, Georgians, Azeris, Uzbeks, Moldovans, Tatars, among others. Some of them, having a Jewish father or grandfather, identify as Jews, but being non-Jewish by Orthodox Halakha (religious law), they are not recognized formally as Jews by the state. Most of them are in the mainstream of Israel culture and are called \"expanded Jewish population\". In addition, a certain number of former Soviet citizens, primarily women of Russian and Ukrainian ethnicity, emigrated to Israel, after marrying Muslim or Christian Arab citizens of Israel, who went to study in the former Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. 1,557,698 people from the current Russia and Ukraine live in Israel.[71]\n\nFinns\n\nAlthough most people of Finnish origin in Israel are Finnish Jews who immigrated to Israel, and their descendants, a small number of Finnish Christians moved to Israel in the 1940s before independence and gained citizenship following independence. For the most part, many of the original Finnish settlers intermarried with the other communities in the country, and therefore remain very small in number. A Moshav shitufi near Jerusalem named Yad HaShmona, meaning the \"Memorial for the Eight\", was established in 1971 by a group of Finnish Christian-Israelis, although today, most members are Israeli, and are predominantly Hebrew speakers, and the moshav has become a center of Messianic Jews.[72][73]\n\nBaháʼís\n\nThe population of followers of the Baháʼí Faith in Israel is almost entirely made up of volunteers serving at the Baháʼí World Centre. Bahá'u'lláh (1817–1892), the Faith's founder, was banished to Akka and died nearby where his shrine is located. During his lifetime he instructed his followers not to teach or convert those living in the area, and the Baháʼís descending from those original immigrants were later asked to leave and teach elsewhere. For nearly a century there has been a policy by Baháʼí leaders to not accept converts living in Israel. The 650 or so foreign national Baháʼís living in Israel are almost all on temporary duty serving at the shrines and administrative offices.[74][75][76]\n\nVietnamese\n\nThe number of Vietnamese people in Israel and their descendants is estimated at 150 to 200.[77] Most of them came to Israel in between 1976 and 1979, after prime minister Menachem Begin authorized their admission to Israel and granted them political asylum. The Vietnamese people living in Israel are Israeli citizens who also serve in the Israel Defense Forces. Today, the majority of the community lives in the Gush Dan area in the center of Tel Aviv, but also a few dozen Vietnamese-Israelis or Israelis of Vietnamese origin live in Haifa, Jerusalem, and Ofakim.\n\nAfrican Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem\n\nThe African Hebrew Israelite Nation of Jerusalem is a religious sect[78] of Black Americans, founded in 1960 by Ben Carter[79][80] a metal worker in Chicago. The members of this sect believe they are descended from the tribes of Judah driven from the Holy Land by the Romans during the First Jewish War (70 AD), and who reportedly emigrated to West Africa before being taken as slaves to the United States.[79][81] With a population of over 5,000, most members live in their own community in Dimona, Israel, with additional families in Arad, Mitzpe Ramon, and the Tiberias area. The group believes that the ancient Israelites are the ancestors of Black Americans and that the actual Jews are \"impostors\".[82] Some scholarship does consider them to be of subsaharan African origin, rather than Levantine.[83] Their ancestors were Black Americans who, after being expelled from Liberia, illegally immigrated to Israel in the late 1960s using tourist visas, requesting that Israel provide them legal citizenship status. Israel granted their requests.[84] The African Hebrew Israelites, like the Haredim and most Israeli Arabs, are not required to serve in the military; however, some do.\n\nNaturalized foreign workers\n\nSome naturalized foreign workers and their children born in Israel, predominantly from the Philippines, Nepal, Nigeria, Senegal, Romania, China, Cyprus, Thailand, and South America (mainly Colombia).\n\nNon-citizens\n\nAfrican migrants\n\nThe number and status of African migrants in Israel is disputed and controversial, but it is estimated that at least 70,000 refugees mainly from Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Ivory Coast reside and work in Israel. A count in late 2011 published in Ynet pointed out the number only in Tel Aviv is 40,000, which represents 10 percent of the city's population. The vast majority live in the southern parts of the city. There is a significant population in the southern Israeli cities of Eilat, Arad, and Beersheba.\n\nForeign workers\n\nThere are around 300,000 foreign workers, residing in Israel under temporary work visas, including Palestinians. Most of those foreign workers engage in agriculture and construction. The main groups of those foreign workers include the Chinese, Thai, Filipinos,[85] Nigerians, Romanians, and Latin Americans.\n\nOther refugees\n\nApproximately 100–200 refugees from Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraqi Kurdistan, and North Korea were absorbed in Israel as refugees. Most of them were also given Israeli resident status, and currently reside in Israel.[86] As of 2006, some 200 ethnic Kurdish refugees from Turkey resided in Israel as illegal immigrants, fleeing the Kurdish–Turkish conflict.[87]\n\nLanguages\n\nMain article: Languages of Israel\n\nDue to its immigrant nature, Israel is one of the most multicultural and multilingual societies in the world. Hebrew is the official language of the country, and Arabic is given special status, while English and Russian are the two most widely spoken non-official languages. A certain degree of English is spoken widely, and is the language of choice for many Israeli businesses. Hebrew and English language are mandatory subjects in the Israeli school system, and most schools offer either Arabic, French, Spanish, German, Italian, or Russian.\n\nReligion\n\nMain article: Religion in Israel\n\nAccording to a 2010 Israel Central Bureau of Statistics study[89] of Israelis aged over 18:\n\nWhile the ultra-Orthodox, or Haredim, represented only 5% of Israel's population in 1990,[90] they are expected to represent more than one-fifth of Israel's Jewish population by 2028.[91] By 2022, Haredim were 13.3% of the population and enumerated 1,280,000.[92][93]\n\nReligious makeup, 2019[94][95][58] Group Population % Jews 6,697,000\n\n74.2%\n\nMuslims 1,605,700\n\n17.8%\n\nChristians 180,400\n\n2.0%\n\nDruze 143,000\n\n1.6%\n\nOther/unknown 394,900\n\n4.4%\n\nEducation\n\nMain article: Education in Israel\n\nEducation between ages 5 and 15 is compulsory. It is not free, but it is subsidized by the government, individual organizations (such as the Beit Yaakov System), or a combination. Parents are expected to participate in courses as well. The school system is organized into kindergartens, 6-year primary schools, and either 6-year secondary schools or 3-year junior secondary schools + 3-year senior secondary schools (depending on region), after which a comprehensive examination is offered for university admissions.\n\nLiteracy\n\nAge 15 and over can read and write (2011 estimate):[96]\n\nTotal population: 97.8%\n\nMale: 98.7%\n\nFemale: 96.8%\n\nPolicy\n\nSee also: Demographic threat § Israel\n\nIsrael is the thirtieth-most-densely-crowded country in the world. In an academic article, Jewish National Fund Board member Daniel Orenstein, argues that, as elsewhere, overpopulation is a stressor on the environment in Israel; he shows that environmentalists have conspicuously failed to consider the impact of population on the environment, and argues that overpopulation in Israel has not been appropriately addressed for ideological reasons.[97][98]\n\nCitizenship and Entry Law\n\nThe Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order) 5763 was first passed on 31 July 2003, and has since been extended until 31 July 2008. The law places age restrictions for the automatic granting of Israeli citizenship and residency permits to spouses of Israeli citizens, such that spouses who are inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are ineligible. On 8 May 2005, the Israeli ministerial committee for issues of legislation once again amended the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, to restrict citizenship and residence in Israel only to Palestinian men over the age of 35, and Palestinian women over the age of 25. Those in favor of the law say the law not only limits the possibility of the entrance of terrorists into Israel, but, as Ze'ev Boim asserts, allows Israel \"to maintain the state's democratic nature, but also its Jewish nature\" (i. e., its Jewish demographic majority).[99] Critics, including the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,[100] say the law disproportionately affects Arab citizens of Israel, since Arabs in Israel are far more likely to have spouses from the West Bank and Gaza Strip than other Israeli citizens.[101]\n\nIn the constitutional challenges to the Citizenship and Entry to Israel Law, the state, represented by the Attorney General, insisted that security was the only objective behind the law. The state also added that even if the law was intended to achieve demographic objectives, it is still in conformity with Israel's Jewish and democratic definition, and thus constitutional. In a 2012 ruling by the Supreme Court on the issue, some of the judges on the panel discussed demography, and were inclined to accept that demography is a legitimate consideration in devising family reunification policies that violate the right to family life.[102]\n\nVital statistics\n\nBirth and death rates in Israel[103][104][105][106] Year Population Live births Deaths Natural increase Crude birth rate Crude death rate Rate of natural increase Crude migration rate TFR 1950 1,370,000 43,431 8,700 34,731 34.1 6.8 27.3 1951 1,578,000 50,542 9,866 40,676 34.3 6.7 27.6 104.2 1952 1,630,000 52,556 11,666 40,890 32.8 7.3 25.5 6.4 1953 1,669,000 52,552 10,916 41,636 31.9 6.6 25.3 -1.9 1954 1,718,000 48,951 11,328 37,623 28.9 6.7 22.2 6.3 1955 1,789,000 50,686 10,532 40,154 28.9 6.0 22.9 16.8 4.03 1956 1,872,000 52,287 12,025 40,262 28.6 6.6 22.0 22.3 1957 1,976,000 53,940 12,487 41,453 28.0 6.5 21.5 31.1 1958 2,032,000 52,649 11,615 41,034 26.3 5.8 20.5 7.8 1959 2,089,000 54,604 12,056 42,548 26.5 5.9 20.6 6.7 1960 2,150,000 56,002 12,053 43,949 26.4 5.7 20.7 7.7 1961 2,234,000 54,869 12,663 42,206 25.0 5.8 19.2 18.4 1962 2,332,000 56,356 13,701 42,655 24.7 6.0 18.7 23.3 1963 2,430,000 59,491 14,425 45,066 25.0 6.1 18.9 21.3 1964 2,526,000 63,544 15,491 48,053 25.6 6.3 19.3 18.7 1965 2,598,000 66,146 16,261 49,885 25.8 6.3 19.5 8.2 3.99 1966 2,657,000 67,148 16,582 50,566 25.6 6.3 19.3 2.9 1967 2,776,000 64,980 17,463 47,517 23.9 6.4 17.5 25.4 1968 2,841,000 69,911 18,689 51,222 24.9 6.7 18.2 4.7 1969 2,930,000 73,666 19,767 53,899 25.5 6.9 18.6 11.8 1970 3,022,000 80,843 21,234 59,609 27.2 7.1 20.1 10.3 1971 3,121,000 85,899 21,415 64,484 28.0 7.0 21.0 10.7 1972 3,225,000 85,544 22,719 62,825 27.0 7.2 19.8 12.4 1973 3,338,000 88,545 23,054 65,491 27.0 7.0 20.0 13.9 1974 3,422,000 93,166 24,135 69,031 27.6 7.1 20.5 4.0 1975 3,493,000 95,628 24,600 71,028 27.7 7.1 20.6 -0.3 3.68 1976 3,575,000 98,763 24,012 74,751 27.9 6.8 21.1 1.8 1977 3,653,000 95,315 24,951 70,364 26.4 6.9 19.5 1.9 1978 3,738,000 92,602 25,153 67,449 25.1 6.8 18.3 4.4 3.28 1979 3,836,000 93,710 25,700 68,010 24.7 6.8 17.9 7.6 3.21 1980 3,922,000 94,321 26,364 67,957 24.3 6.8 17.5 4.4 3.14 1981 3,978,000 93,308 26,085 67,223 23.6 6.6 17.0 -2.9 3.06 1982 4,064,000 96,695 27,780 68,915 24.0 6.9 17.1 4.1 3.12 1983 4,119,000 98,724 27,731 70,993 24.0 6.7 17.3 -3.9 3.14 1984 4,200,000 98,478 27,805 70,673 23.3 6.6 16.7 2.6 3.13 1985 4,266,000 99,376 28,093 71,283 23.1 6.5 16.6 -1.1 3.12 1986 4,331,000 99,341 29,415 69,926 22.7 6.7 16.0 -1.0 3.09 1987 4,407,000 99,022 29,244 69,778 22.2 6.6 15.6 1.6 3.05 1988 4,477,000 100,454 29,176 71,278 22.2 6.4 15.8 -0.2 3.06 1989 4,560,000 100,757 28,580 72,177 22.1 6.3 15.8 2.4 3.03 1990 4,822,000 103,349 28,734 74,615 22.0 6.1 15.9 38.4 3.02 1991 5,059,000 105,725 31,266 74,459 21.4 6.3 15.1 31.7 2.91 1992 5,196,000 110,062 33,327 76,735 21.5 6.5 15.0 11.4 2.93 1993 5,328,000 112,330 33,000 79,330 21.3 6.3 15.0 9.8 2.92 1994 5,472,000 114,543 33,535 81,008 21.2 6.2 15.0 11.3 2.90 1995 5,612,000 116,886 35,348 81,538 21.1 6.4 14.7 10.2 2.88 1996 5,758,000 121,333 34,664 86,669 21.3 6.1 15.2 10.2 2.94 1997 5,900,000 124,478 36,124 88,354 21.4 6.2 15.2 8.9 2.93 1998 6,041,000 130,080 36,955 93,125 21.8 6.2 15.6 7.7 2.98 1999 6,209,000 131,936 37,291 94,645 21.6 6.1 15.5 11.6 2.94 2000 6,369,000 136,390 37,688 98,702 21.7 6.0 15.7 9.4 2.95 2001 6,509,000 136,636 37,186 99,450 21.2 5.8 15.4 6.1 2.89 2002 6,631,000 139,535 38,415 101,120 21.2 5.8 15.4 3.0 2.89 2003 6,748,000 144,936 38,499 106,437 21.7 5.8 15.9 1.4 2.95 2004 6,870,000 145,207 37,938 107,269 21.3 5.6 15.7 2.1 2.90 2005 6,991,000 143,913 39,038 104,875 20.8 5.6 15.2 2.1 2.84 2006 7,117,000 148,170 38,765 109,405 21.0 5.5 15.5 2.2 2.88 2007 7,244,000 151,679 40,081 111,598 21.1 5.5 15.6 1.9 2.90 2008 7,419,000 156,923 39,484 117,439 21.5 5.4 16.1 7.5 2.96 2009 7,552,000 161,042 38,812 122,230 21.5 5.2 16.3 1.3 2.96 2010 7,695,000 166,255 39,613 126,642 21.8 5.2 16.6 2.0 3.03 2011 7,837,000 166,296 40,889 125,407 21.4 5.3 16.1 2.0 3.00 2012 7,984,000 170,940 42,100 128,840 21.6 5.3 16.3 2.1 3.05 2013 8,134,000 171,444 41,683 129,761 21.3 5.2 16.1 2.3 3.03 2014 8,297,000 176,427 42,457 133,970 21.5 5.2 16.3 3.3 3.08 2015 8,463,000 178,723 44,507 134,216 21.3 5.3 16.0 3.6 3.09 2016 8,629,000 181,405 44,244 137,161 21.2 5.2 16.0 3.2 3.11 2017 8,798,000 183,648 44,923 138,725 21.1 5.2 15.9 3.3 3.11 2018 8,883,000 184,370 44,850 139,520 20.8 5.0 15.7 -6.1 3.09 2019 9,054,000 182,016 46,328 135,688 20.1 5.1 15.0 3.9 3.01 2020 9,215,000 177,307 49,006 128,301 19.2 5.3 13.9 3.6 2.90 2021 9,400,000 185,040 50,984 134,056 19.7 5.4 14.3 5.4 3.00 2022 9,661,400 181,193 52,054 129,139 19.0 5.4 13.6 13.5 2.89 2023 178,724 49,910 128,814 18.3 5.1 13.2\n\nCurrent vital statistics\n\n[107]\n\nPeriod Live births Deaths Natural increase January -

Gold maintains that calculation of Jewish emigration has been a contentious issue, explaining, \"Since Zionism, the philosophy that underlies the existence of the Jewish state, calls for return home of the world's Jews, the opposite movement—Israelis leaving the Jewish state to reside elsewhere—clearly presents an ideological and demographic problem.\"[113]\n\nIn the past several decades, emigration (yerida) has seen a considerable increase. From 1990 to 2005, 230,000 Israelis left the country; a large proportion of these departures included people who initially immigrated to Israel and then reversed their course (48% of all post-1990 departures and even 60% of 2003 and 2004 departures were former immigrants to Israel). 8% of Jewish immigrants in the post-1990 period left Israel, while 15% of non-Jewish immigrants did. In 2005 alone, 21,500 Israelis left the country and had not yet returned at the end of 2006; among them 73% were Jews, 5% Arabs, and 22% \"Others\" (mostly non-Jewish immigrants, with Jewish ancestry, from USSR). At the same time, 10,500 Israelis came back to Israel after over one year abroad; 84% were Jews, 9% Others, and 7% Arabs.[114]\n\nAccording to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, as of 2005, 650,000 Israelis had left the country for over one year and not returned. Of them, 530,000 are still alive today. This number does not include the children born overseas. It should also be noted that Israeli law grants citizenship only to the first generation of children born to Israeli emigrants.\n\nHealth\n\nHIV/AIDS – adult prevalence rate\n\n0.2% (2009 est.)\n\nObesity – adult prevalence rate\n\n26% of women and 40% of men are overweight. In both genders, obesity rate is 15% (as of 2011).[115]\n\nFuture projections\n\nIn June 2013, the Central Bureau of Statistics released a demographic report, projecting that Israel's population would grow to 11.4 million by 2035, with the Jewish population numbering 8.3 million, or 73% of the population, and the Arab population at 2.6 million, or 23%. This includes some 2.3 million Muslims (20% of the population), 185,000 Druze, and 152,000 Christians. The report predicts that the Israeli population growth rate will decline to 1.4% annually, with growth in the Muslim population remaining higher than the Jewish population until 2035, at which point the Jewish population will begin growing the fastest.[118]\n\nIn 2017, the Central Bureau of Statistics projected that Israel's population would rise to about 18 million by 2059, including 14.4 million Jews and 3.6 million Arabs. Of the Jewish population, about 5.25 million would be Haredi. Overall, the forecast projected that 49% of the population would be either Haredi Jews (29%) or Arabs (20%).[119] It also projected a population of 20 million in 2065.[120] Jews and other non-Arabs are expected to compose 81% of the population in 2065, and Arabs 19%. About 32% of the population is expected to be Haredi.[121]\n\nOther forecasts project that Israel could have a population as high as 23 million, or even 36 million, by 2050.[122]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading"
