        "text": "Juara Junction\n\nApproximately three kilometers from the information booth, turn left (southward) to Juara. Before that, we recommend visiting HaShofet River and returning here only afterward. To that end, we will continue on the paved road.\n\nHaShofet River\n\nHaShofet River. Photos: Yoav Devir.\n\nThe road, which is well marked with signs, ascends to Mount Gahar and descends to HaShofet River. We cross the stream on the “Irish Bridge” which is suitable for all vehicles and proceed a short way to the Carob recreation area, where we recommend parking your car. Water flows in the streambed all year round. KKL-JNF has made the path wheelchair-accessible. Some sections of this wonderful path are paved with asphalt, while wooden boards provide the surface of others.\n\nThe trail is shaded by the trees usually found along riverbanks, such as the willow. A small waterfall and pool, which can be seen from a terrace lookout, are farther along the way. Several hoary elm trees grow here. The trail ends at Ein Hashrat (Ein Ami), a lovely spring that flows from a tunnel into a square pool hewn from white stone. From here, visitors may return to the Carob recreation area on a convenient dirt path.\n\nWalking time is approximately a half hour for those who walk quickly and up to an hour and a half for those who wish to linger. A detailed KKL-JNF information sheet is available for hikers in HaShofet River.\n\nReturning to Juara Junction\n\nAfter the hike to HaShofet River, we return to Juara Junction and turn southward. The park road now passes between a planted forest on the left and a cultivated field on the right. As we ascend the hill, we see the views of HaShofet River and the Carmel. Afterward, in the open area, the route takes advantage of the old “soling” road. This road, which was paved with stones during the British Mandate period and connects Yokneam with Juara, is suitable for all types of vehicles. Just drive slowly and enjoy the view.\n\nThe Mishmar HaEmek Road\n\nThis soling road ends at the road that descends to Mishmar HaEmek (Route 6953). Stop and check the traffic carefully. When the coast is clear, drive onto the highway and go a little to the left. After several meters, the park road branches off to the right, but before continuing there, we suggest driving approximately another hundred meters along the slope of the road and going up the hill to the right. This is Juara.\n\nJuara (The Haganah Museum)\n\nThe museum is open from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM Sunday through Thursday, and on Fridays until 2:00 PM. It is closed on Saturday. Tours are given by a local guide. Groups are requested to call in advance. Tel.: 04-959-7402.\n\nAlthough Juara now serves as a base for the Gadna youth battalions, it is best remembered for the army company commanders’ course that took place here. Juara produced commanders of the Haganah and the fledgling IDF. This is the place where Moshe Bar-Tikvah (Mundak Pasternak) produced the symbol of the sword with the olive branch that became the company commander’s pin, and to this day, it is awarded to those who complete the IDF officers’ course.\n\nProceed to the gate of the camp, park the car in the parking lot in front of the gate and tell the guard that you would like to visit the museum. Directly in front of you is the large stone building that KKL-JNF purchased in 1936. The first inhabitants of Ein HaShofet, who established a tower-and-stockade-style settlement, lived in this building for approximately a year.\n\nThis small, charming museum preserves Juara’s original character and tells its story. At the entrance, visitors stand in the military formation demanded of the course participants. A stand-in for the course commander presents the program using modern technology. The presentation on the top floor depicts daily life in Juara and the phases of the training program.\n\nAt the end of the visit to Juara, we will return to the scenic road and continue south.\n\nOn the Way to Kibbutzim Junction\n\nThe park trail continues southward from the Mishmar HaEmek highway. The trail passes through a small boulevard of cypress trees. Keep an eye out for the remnants of an olive press on the left side of the road. These remnants serve as a memorial to Shlomo Kortz and his grandson, members of Ein HaShofet, who perished during an archeological excavation of an ancient burial cave nearby.\n\nThe road descends straight into the Mishmar HaEmek Forest. Before reaching the forest, notice the “French Bridge,” which rises above the small channel on the way to the forest. “French Bridge” is a nickname for the passage built underground. It is made of two rows of large boulders with smaller stones between them (called “baklash” in the local jargon). A cover is placed tightly over it, which allows water to trickle under the “bridge” and keeps the road from being washed out by rain.\n\nOnce the road meets the Mishmar HaEmek Forest, it turns southward (to the right) and passes fairly close to Ein Shulamit, a spring whose waters flowed at one time into a concrete pool. Today, the water is pumped to Kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek. After approximately four kilometers, we reach Kibbutzim Junction, which is marked by several cypresses that grow inside a “plaza.” The park road continues right inside, but we will turn left here in order to visit the ruins of Beit Rosh and the Kibbutzim Forest.\n\nThe Ruins of Beit Rosh and the Kibbutzim Forest\n\nAfter approximately 200 meters, the road goes up to the ruins of Beit Rosh. Park on the roadside and climb to the top of the hill on one of the paths that lead from the road to the summit. The lookout point is marvelous. All you need to do is walk along the path that circles the summit.\n\nThe path, which is 360 meters long, provides a 360-degree view. From here we can see the Jezreel Valley, Mount Tabor, the mountains of Nazareth and Givat HaMorah – and, on a clear winter day, snow on Mount Hermon. On the other side, we can see the Carmel, Haifa Bay, the smokestacks of the power plant in Hadera and several communities in the Sharon region. Simply spectacular. The archaeological ruins here indicate settlement from the Roman period.\n\nReturn by car and continue on the road that circles the hill. Afterwards, descend to the road and continue northward through the lovely vistas of the Kibbutzim Forest until you see wooden structures that belong to the Scouts movement. This is a shomriya – a place where summer camps of the Hashomer Hatza’ir youth movement were once held. Near here, in the carob tree orchard recreation area there is a lovely view facing northward.\n\nReturn to Kibbutzim Junction and continue southward along the scenic road towards Taninim River. It is passable by any vehicle except during the rainy season, when it is passable only in a 4X4.\n\nEin Kfar\n\nThe road descends to the upper tributaries of Taninim River and climbs to the summit of the hill, which looks out over a small valley that contains two springs and the ruins of a village. Among the ruins are hedges of sabra cactus and orchard trees. These are the ruins of Ein Kufrin. In order to preserve the tranquility of the place, go down on foot. The large spring serves the cattle of Kibbutz Ein HaShofet.\n\nThe Cyclamen Forest\n\nReturn to the car and continue on the scenic road. The road passes the area that separates between Taninim River and Saflul River and leads to the Kibbutz Galed highway (Route 672) near the Cyclamen Forest. In winter, between December and March, the forested hill is covered with thousands of cyclamen blossoms. During this season, we recommend parking the car in the large parking area, crossing the road on foot and hiking up the hill.\n\nTaninim River"
