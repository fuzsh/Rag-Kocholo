        "text": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE) is an American multinational information technology provider.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) was founded in November 2015, following the split of Hewlett-Packard Company (HP). HPE was formed from the old HP’s Enterprise product and Business divisions, focusing on servers, storage, cloud, and software services.\n\nHPE, which specializes in the manufacturing and marketing of storage and server hardware, retained several occupation-related involvements through its fully-owned Israeli subsidiary Hewlett Packard (Israel) Ltd.\n\nThrough its fully owned Israeli subsidiary Hewlett Packard (Israel) Ltd., the company provides servers, software and services to the Israeli Police and the Israel Prison Service.\n\nServices to the Israeli Population Immigration and Borders Authority\n\nIsrael’s Population Registry – the Aviv System\n\nHPE is the sole supplier of Itanium servers for the Israeli Population Immigration and Borders Authority for the operation of the Israeli Population Registry, which contains information on Palestinians living in the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nSince 2017, HPE has been the sole supplier of Itanium servers for the Israeli Population Immigration and Borders Authority's \"Aviv System\", the computerization system of the Authority which was established based on Itanium servers manufactured by HPE.\n\nThe Israeli Population Registry includes information on Palestinians with Israeli citizenship and non-citizens Palestinian residents of occupied East Jerusalem, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, and Syrians in the occupied Syrian Golan. Through this registry, the Israeli authorities control the permits required for Palestinian workers who work within Israel and in Israeli settlements, as well as permits needed for Palestinians to cross the Green Line for medical needs, family visits, travel abroad, etc., as part of Israel's repressive permit regime. Since the Oslo Accords, the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA) keeps a copy of the Palestinian Population registry from the Palestinian Authority (PA), which includes personal information and addresses of all West Bank and Gaza residents. The registry is constantly updated by the Population and Immigration Authority’s unit in the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA), located in the settlement of Beit El in the occupied West Bank. The data on the Registry is systematically used by Israel for the implementation of discriminatory policies against Palestinians who are eligible for different rights under Israeli control, including discrimination in relation to freedom of movement, voting, family reunification and access to services. The Authority is also in charge of issuing permits for all international visitors to the West Bank.\n\nThe system also documents all of the crossings under Israeli control, including the Allenby Bridge Crossing, which is the only access for West Bank Palestinian residents to travel abroad; and previously Erez Checkpoint, which was the only crossing for the movement of people between the besieged Gaza and Israel and the West Bank – both controlled by and subjected to Israeli authorities.\n\nIn May 2023, Hewlett Packard (Israel) Ltd. was contracted by the Population and Immigration Authority to provide three Itanium servers for the Aviv System for NIS 3,829,410 from June 2023 until June 2026.\n\nIn 2017, Hewlett Packard (Israel) was contracted by the Population and Immigration Authority to provide and maintain the servers until 2020 for a total amount of USD 212,318.\n\nThe Aviv System previously contained a distinguished database that included information on Israeli citizens who live in settlements in the occupied West Bank, under the name “Yesha database” (Hebrew acronym for the West Bank and Gaza).\n\nServices to Israel Police\n\nHPE provides servers, software and maintenance services for the Israel Police.\n\nHPE provides many of the servers and software that serve most of the operational systems of the Israel Police and provides it with accompanying software for dedicated management of all its servers. HPE's servers with the police include Enclosures servers, Blade servers, and \"pizza\" servers. In addition, HPE senior systems engineers work with the police and operate dedicated support teams with the police for proactive services and ongoing troubleshooting.\n\nIn 2021, Hewlett Packard Israel was contracted by the Israel Police to provide Data Center Care services for NIS 4 million for three years until 2024. In January 2024, the Israel Police announced its intention to contract Hewlett Packard Israel for Data Center Care services as the sole supplier for an additional period of three years, until the end of December 2026, for an additional NIS 4 million.\n\nIn March 2021, HPE was contracted by the Israel Police, with an exemption from a tender, to provide proactive maintenance services for HPE-manufactured server systems until December 2023 for 4 million NIS. The contract is an extension of a similar contract from 2018 that expired in January 2021.\n\nIn 2017, HPE was contracted to maintain its Virtual Connect (VC) systems for the Israeli police for the amount of NIS 366,000.\n\nServices to Israel Prison Service\n\nHPE provides equipment produced by it and maintenance to the Israel Police Service's central server farm and the backup center, including 3 SAP HANA systems, 6 central SAN switches and a backup header directory.\n\nIn April 2024, Hewlett Packard Israel was contracted by the Israel Prison Service (IPS) as sole supplier to provide HPE equipment maintenance for NIS 364,075 for one year.\n\nIn February 2023, the company was contracted by the IPS (with an exemption from tender) to provide maintenance for HP equipment for NIS 371,856 until February 2024. According to the contract documents, HP equipment is installed in the IPS central server farm and in the backup server farm.\n\nSince 2015, HPE has been providing servers, data storage and data security services for Israel Prison Service. In 2020, the company was contracted to provide computer and communication maintenance for Israel Prison Service for 2021-2022 for the amount of over NIS 1 million.\n\nIsraeli Biometric Database\n\nIn 2019, HPE was contracted to provide servers, data storage and data security services for the Israeli Ministry of Interior Biometric database in the amount of $320,000. Also in 2019, HPE was contracted for equipment maintenance until 2021 for the Ministry of Interior’s Datacenter.\n\nIn 2016, HPE was contracted to continue to supply its services for Israel’s Biometric project, in the amount of over NIS 31 million.\n\nIn 2014, the contract with HP was extended until 2025 and since has already amounted to over NIS 223 million worth of contracts that were inherited by HPE and DXC.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE) is an American multinational information technology provider.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) was founded in November 2015, following the split of Hewlett-Packard Company (HP).
