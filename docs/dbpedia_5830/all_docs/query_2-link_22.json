He had a brother Chaim Shiff who was born in 1895. He had two sisters; Golda and Rashka. They were also some years younger then he. My father was forced to serve in the Russian army for many years before and during the First World War. When the war started the Russians ordered his younger brother Chaim to \"enroll\" in the army. My grandmother panicked, she could not let another son risk his life. The family quickly arranged for him a \"trip\" to Toronto where he settled and had two daughters.\n\nMy fathers sister Rashka had heart problems since her early childhood. Eventually she married Eliezer Levin and had a daughter named Lea. both of us were named for our grandmother who died shortly before I was born. When the daughter was still a very young child my aunt became very sick. The family did everything to find a cure for her, but she died Shortly after. Some years later Eliezer Levin married another woman. The family perished in the Holocaust. My cousin Lea was about fifteen years old when she perished. My grandfather died at age 81 in January 1940 shortly before we were deported by the Soviets to Kazachstan for my father being a successful businessman and owning a mill.\n\nMy father other sister Golda lived with my grandfather Avraham Moshe the first year that I lived with him in Volozhyn. I lived there because there were no schools in the village were I lived with my parents. Some times later my aunt married Mendel Alperovitz son of Shimon grandson of Meir from Kurenets. Our family visited them and I can still remember the train ride to Vileyka and the walk via the tree-lined road from Vileyka to Kurenets. They said that Catherine the great ordered to plant the trees when she spent a night there in the 1790s. Mendel lived next to his brother Zishka and I remember that Zishka had a son named Shimon. (He was killed as a partisan while fighting the Germans). During my school years in a Vilna high school my aunt Golda came there to receive some treatments since she was unable to conceive. She perished in Volozhin with her baby Shimon.\n\nMy mother was from the Kivilovitz family. She had four sisters and one brother. Her brother was Shneor Kivilovitz, he married Rachel nee Meltzer who was a teacher in the \"Tarbut\" school in Volozhin, and they had a son. Shneor was very involved with the Zionist organization in Volozhin. During the Holocaust Shneor was appointed as the second head of the Jodenrat in Volozhin. Pnina nee Potashnik wrote in the Volozhin Yizkor book;\n\n\"Sunday, May 10th, 1942, at five in the morning Shneur Kivelevitsh appeared in our home and told us that the ghetto is surrounded. He advised every one to hide \" Shneor was not able to save himself, he perished with his family.\n\nHis sister Sonia shared the same fate. she married Mordechai Berman and perished with her family. Berman Mordhay, his wife sonia Sara, their children; Monia, Moyshe\n\nMy mother other sisters came to Ertz Israel prior to the war; first came her sister Fanya in 1925. She married and had two sons, one died as still a young man the other changed his last name from Levizki to Landers and now lives in Mexico.\n\nMy mothers sister Fruma made \"Aliya\" in 1932. Her sister Lea came in 1936 she has family in Chavazelet Israel (Hotman family). My mothers mother died in 1939 a heart attach after hearing the news of the start of World war II. My grandfather died shortly after. (1940) at that point I moved back to Volozhin. ( In 1939 I was in Vilna sometimes after the Russians invaded the eastern part of Poland Vilna became part of Lithuania and Volozhin was on the Soviets side so I went to high school in Molodechno, the Town of my mothers mother from the Shrira family.\n\nLeas husband is from the Cherches family of Radoshkovichi (near Krasne). Her son is Ehud Nachshon ,a writer.\n\nMeir Shiff wrote a chapter in the Volozhin Yizkor book. For pictures of the family look at portraits and family portraits or paste;\n\nGolda nee Shiff Alperovitz;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/volozhin/vol_images/13001_2_b.gif\n\neliezer and rashka Levin with daughter Lea; http://eilatgordinlevitan.com/volozhin/vol_images/20401_4_b.gif\n\ngrandparents Avraham Moshe shiff born 1859 Lea was born 1865;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/volozhin/vol_images/20601_6_b.gif\n\nSima nee Shrira Kivilovitz;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/volozhin/vol_images/20201_6_b.gif\n\nSonia nee Kivilvitz Berman;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/volozhin/vol_images/20101_1_b.gif\n\nBaby Monia Berman;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/volozhin/vol_images/20601_20_b.gif\n\nRachel nee Meltzer Kivilovitz\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/volozhin/vol_images/20101_4_b.gif\n\nbaby Yigal Kivilovitz;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/volozhin/vol_images/20601_19_b.gif\n\nShneor Kivilovitz;\n\nhttp://eilatgordinlevitan.com/volozhin/vol_images/20801_12_b.gif\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDr. Yigal Shochat is related to our family. We are proud of the courage he exibited by sharing his thoughts with the Israeli public;\n\nHa'aretz - Article http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=118432&contrassID=2&subContrassID=14&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y\n\nTuesday, January 22, 2002 Shvat 9, 5762 Israel Time: 03:28 (GMT+2)\n\nRed line, Green Line, black flag\n\nDr. Yigal Shochat, a former fighter pilot and now a physician, calls on soldiers to refuse to serve in the territories and recommends that pilots refuse to bomb Palestinian cities. Following are some remarks he made during a debate on war crimes and security in Israel\n\nBy Yigal Shochat\n\nThe truth is that I don't yet have a fully formed opinion on the subject of sweeping refusal to serve in the IDF. I am in favor of the state, in favor of preserving its security, in favor of defending the state within its borders, and also in favor of the war against the terrorism - local and international - that threatens Israel.\n\nOn the other hand, though, I cannot abide the naturalness with which the occupation is continuing; the fact that one generation after another of soldiers is serving the occupation and that these soldiers are the ones who effectively give the successive governments the power to hold onto the territories and the settlements and to suppress the Palestinian population. Therefore, I find myself on the horns of a large dilemma. In the meantime, I have resolved it, for myself, by deciding that I am in favor of refusal to serve in the territories but not refusal to serve altogether. I know that this is a somewhat hypocritical position, because sometimes the soldier who is posted at General Staff headquarters can do more injustice than a soldier at a roadblock.\n\nStill, I think that refusing to serve in the occupied territories sends a sharper political and moral message. It says that you are ready to guard your country and fight for it, but that you are not willing to suppress another people indefinitely, when the security benefit for Israel is negative. In fact, serving in the occupied territories undermines the country's security while contributing to the security of the settlers. On that subject, I think we have across-the-board agreement by now.\n\nIn the case of pilots - pilots of warplanes, helicopter pilots, pilots in general - it makes no sense to talk about refusing to serve across the 1967 Green Line. Pilots do not serve at the place to which they are posted. In effect, they have to decide anew every day, and sometimes every hour, which operations are moral and legal and which are not. I am not naive: I am well aware that any pilot who will refuse to bomb Nablus or Ramallah once or twice will thereby bring his career to an end - and we are talking about a career. To fly is a way of life and a profession. It is never just the draft and reserve duty, which you do in order to get it over with and get back home in one piece. So, in the case of pilots, I think we need to expand the concept of the \"black flag.\"\n\n[Shochat is referring to the phrase used by Judge Binyamin Halevy in 1958 in the trial of the members of the Border Police who on October 29, 1956, shot dead 43 civilians - men and women - from the Arab village of Kafr Qasem in Israel, who were returning home from the fields and were unaware that their village and others in the area had been placed under curfew ahead of the Sinai War, which began that day. \"A black flag flies over a flagrantly illegal order,\" Halevy stated.]\n\nIn my opinion, pilots need to examine closely the order they get, ask a lot of questions about the goal, and refuse to obey any order they consider immoral. I am afraid that such questions do not occupy them, rather they compete among themselves over who will be assigned the next mission to liquidate someone in the center of Nablus, on the main street, or who will get to drop a bomb on a building in Ramallah. They probably return to the squadron happy when they score a bull's-eye and are sorry, to some extent, if civilians are killed. I remember this from my own experience. People want to excel in what they do, and they want action. That's why they are pilots in the first place.\n\nI think that F-16 pilots should refuse to bomb Palestinian cities. They have to think about what a bombing operation would be like in the city they live in. Let's say that [Palestinian leader Yasser] Arafat were to decide to level the police station on Dizengoff Boulevard using a warplane. (Let's say he had a warplane.) If Arafat were to conclude that this is how he could convince [Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon to withdraw from the territories, would we accept a bombing operation in the center of the city as a legitimate military act? After all, we call even an operation against an IDF outpost, like the one last week at Kerem Shalom, a \"terrorist\" attack.\n\nI can imagine what it was like in Ramallah when an F-16 bombed the police station there. I am not talking about the civilians who were killed there - cooks from Gaza, not troops. I am talking about bombing a densely populated city. I am talking about liquidating people on the main street, from a helicopter, with three passersby also killed. It's impossible today to say that this was \"collateral damage,\" that we didn't intend to kill civilians, because when a plane bombs a populated city, you take into account that civilians could get killed. Even in precision bombing. So I view this as the deliberate killing of civilians - a war crime. We have seen in the past few months what smart bombs can do, both here and in Afghanistan.\n\nI think that the goal is not important enough to pay that price, especially when we are confronting not an army but civilians. And more especially when we are wrong. Very wrong. In my view, neither the larger goal of this fighting is legitimate - because the occupation is not legitimate - nor the small goal of destroying a police station in order to pressure Arafat into stopping the use of terrorism. That, too, is not legitimate.\n\nIn 1996, I did not accept the legitimacy of \"Operation Grapes of Wrath,\" where the purpose was to force Lebanese civilians to flee by bombing them, thereby pressuring the government in Beirut to take action against Hezbollah. But it is not only pilots who are responsible for war crimes. I think that, in the final analysis, the pilots may be less responsible than other soldiers. I think that every driver of an army bulldozer has to refuse to obey an order to demolish homes with the aim of exposing an area for the convenience of the IDF.\n\nI read this week what the head of the Civil Administration, Brigadier General Dov Tzadka, said about the authorizations he gives to demolish houses and groves, and how the army then goes hyperactive and levels the area he authorized twice. By what right does he approve such an operation in the first place? I am constantly dumbfounded at how these people get up every morning and go to work: after all, we're not talking about kids of draft age, this is a brigadier general. What does he say to himself at the end of the day? \"Today I authorized the uprooting of 50 dunams [12.5 acres] of strawberry fields?\" What for? To preserve the country's security?\n\nI saw that this Brigadier General Tzadka is now worried that he may end up at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, because he knows full well what he did. But how can you both know and do? I think that to demolish civilian homes only because they are obstructing someone's field of vision constitutes a flagrantly immoral military act. I am not a legal expert and so I don't know what is legal and what isn't, but I assume that this is illegal as well as immoral. I know that the question of when the black flag flies over an order is a wholly personal one. One can't wait for the court to declare a certain operation flagrantly illegal, nor should one wait, because then it becomes a retroactive matter, as in the case of Ehud Yatom [who, according to the High Court of Justice, took part in the killing of two captured terrorists at the order of the head of the Shin Bet security service in 1984].\n\nThere are some people who never see a black flag, not even when it involves the murder of an Arab who is bound. There are people who only see a black flag when they get old, like me, because when I was a young pilot, I wasn't selective. I did what I was told to do. I am in favor of a broader use of the concept of the black flag, which means to refuse to obey an order that in your personal opinion is flagrantly illegal. But I know that draft-age soldiers, and even people in the career army, will not make much use of it. When you're inside, you see things differently.\n\nI think also that to stand at a roadblock and make a selection as to who will be allowed to proceed to a hospital or to a maternity ward and who will not, is also flagrantly illegal. Therefore, I think that every soldier who is assigned to serve at a roadblock should refuse the order and instead go to prison. If only the legality of the selection process at roadblocks were examined in court. I think that those who refuse to serve in the territories should not make do with going to jail; they should try to reach civil courts so that these things will be reviewed and given publicity. Let them go all the way to the High Court of Justice with their refusal. Those who go to jail quietly do not exert an influence.\n\nIt is out of the question to allow the army to set up roadblocks at every corner that prevent people from going about their lives, going to work, going to the doctor, and to accept this as though it is a divine decree. That constitutes collective punishment of civilians, which is illegal according to the Geneva Convention. I think that it's a shame that so few people refuse to serve in the territories, but I can't really complain, because I didn't do it either when I should have done it.\n\nNearly 20 years ago, I paid a visit to the late Prof. Yeshayahu Leibowitz. He asked me then - this was in 1983 - how it was possible that there weren't 500 officers who would refuse to serve in the territories. He said that in his opinion, if there were 500 officers like that, the occupation would end immediately. I think he was right. Soon we will not be able to refer to an \"occupation,\" because being present on the ground for so many years creates a new situation.\n\nPeople who served in the territories in their compulsory service return as reservists, and their children are also stationed in the same places. The new generation doesn't even know the Palestinians because of the lengthy closure, and to them, the territories are like Lebanon. Apartheid against the Palestinians is practiced by one generation to the next. And not only by the settlers - by all of us. If there are no terrorist attacks, we don't even remember that the Palestinians exist.\n\nI don't know whether every operation I took part in when I was an active fighter pilot was legal or moral. Probably not. Today, friends from that period who bombed targets with me complain to me that I remembered too late to be a bleeding heart and that it's no big deal to talk about refusal to obey orders when I am no longer involved and I will not be the one to go to jail. They say that as long as my promotion in the army was at stake I said nothing, but now that I have nothing to lose I am suddenly a hero. That is all true. I reached political and moral maturity very late.\n\nBut I can also say, roughly, that I always bombed military targets. When I bombed civilian neighborhoods, it was during a full-scale war, when planes and tanks and soldiers from both sides were locked in combat, and it was far from sure who would win. In general, in the wars in which I took part, our feeling was that Israel was in an inferior position and that we were fighting for our lives and our home, literally. As to the territories, as to this military struggle against the Palestinians, I simply don't see armies facing off and I don't see a war. In fact, I don't even know which side of the fence I'm on, because I am certainly not on the side of the settlers. What I see is an occupied population that has a few hundred rifles and mortars, which is trying to expel us, while we refuse to go because we have invested a few cents in unnecessary settlements.\n\nI am aware of the arguments against refusal. First of all, they say that in a democracy, it is the role of the elected political level to decide what constitutes a legitimate goal and what does not. I reject that. Precisely in a democracy, it is the right and the duty of every citizen to oppose illegitimate warfare. In totalitarian regimes, people who refuse to serve are shot, while here they are only sent to prison briefly. It is in a democracy that you have the option of not following the herd.\n\nThe second argument is that we need more humanists at the roadblocks in order to ease things for the Palestinians and that we must not leave the army to the nut cases on the right. I also deny the importance that is attributed to individual soldiers at a roadblock, because in the course of time, they all become insensitive to suffering. I think that the individual soldier carries the greatest weight when he refuses to serve.\n\nThe third argument is that if everyone were to decide which orders to obey, the time will come when the settlers will refuse to evacuate the settlements. To that I say: That's fine with me. For my part, the settlers can refuse to evacuate the settlements and we will do it for them. I, for example, would refuse to demolish the home of a Palestinian with a bulldozer, and at the same time, some soldier-settler would refuse to evacuate a settler family. That's fine with me. The important thing is for soldiers to retain their humanity and realize that they are confronting dilemmas.\n\nIn my opinion, all the IDF's operations in the territories are approaching the red line of the black flag. I cannot judge what is legal and what constitutes a war crime. At a time when the Americans kill 7,000 people in an attempt to find one person, it is difficult to talk about morality in war. Since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, following the Oslo accord, we have begun to treat it as a state even though it is not. That makes it easier for us to attack it with weapons, such as planes and tanks, that are intended for use against armies in war. My feeling is that we have crossed a line, and I am afraid that the day is not far off when we will bomb the Arabs in Israel the way we opened fire on them in the demonstrations of October 2000.\n\nThe day is not far off when the Israel Air Force will bomb Umm al-Fahm, in the same way that Saddam Hussein bombed his Kurdish citizens. I don't know if the air force pilots will refuse to obey such an order. There will be someone to persuade them that the operation is logical and essential, that the bombs are smart, that the only targets are city hall and the Islamic movement, and not innocent people. I don't see any great difference between that and bombing Ramallah.\n\n.\n\n-\n\nSubj: donors list\n\nDate: 1/21/02 1:55:26 PM Pacific Standard Time\n\nFrom: rubinlj@netvision.net.il (RUBIN LEON)\n\nTo: EilatGordn@aol.com (eilat gordn)\n\n21 of January 2002\n\nHere is an updated list of donors for the Dolhinov Cemetery Project:\n\n1.

Yanovich (1944-1994).\n\nA peculiar interest will be evoked by the Bernard Show's photos collection (1929-1930), most of which are the original ones.\n\nThe collection of ethnographer and historian A.K. Elsky (1839-1885), and the collection of I.I. and N.I. Grigoroviches (the 14th-19th centuries) can be useful for researchers of Russian social, scientific and religious life of the19th century.\n\nhttp://www.president.gov.by/gosarchives/EArh/E_lit_isk.htm\n\nclick here for the site\n\n-\n\nI called Michael Gibelman (Gable) in Florida.\n\nMichaels maternal grandfather was Velvel Alperovitz of kurenitz. Velvel had thirteen children (with more then one wife) most of his children came to the U.S c 1900 and settled in New York. Some if his children were:\n\n1. Motel  Morris Alperovitz who lived in New York and changed his last name to Alpert. He had two children.\n\n2. A daughter Chaya Zipa married .. Taryevitz. They had four children. Two of them never came to the U.S. Motka and Zalman lived in Gorki after the war..\n\n3. There was a daughter Ester Goss who lived in New York and had a son and a daughter.\n\n4. Another daughter was liza Dimond of New York\n\n5. Michaels mother was Gitel who was born c 1895. She married Chaim Gitelman and moved to Krivich to open a shoes manufacturing business. In Krivich Michael and his sisters were born. (Michael 1920?). Later the family returned to Kurenitz. From 1934- 1937 michael attended the \"Tarbut\" School in Dolhinov. In 1939 Michael left the Kurenitz area and lived in Gorki. During the war he was in the far southeast region of the Soviet Union. After the war ended he was in germany and tried to get papers to go to Israel but was not able to. During that time he found out that both his mother and his father had a large family in the U.S that was looking for any relatives who survived. In 1949 he came to the U.S. The only other relatives who survived were the Norman brothers (Tuvia and Reuven).Tuvias' and reuvens' Grandfather was;\n\n6. Meir Aharon Alperovitz, died in Kurenitz before the war. see end of next post for information about his family. Michael also told me that I should get in touch with Mike Silver who was born in Krivich.\n\n.\n\n-\n\nToday I called Shalom Norman in Israel. He told me that every year he attends the memorial meetings for the Jews who perished in Vileyka. The meetings are held during Purim since most of the residents of Vileyka and other Jews who worked there from near by shtetls, were killed during Purim of 1942. In 2002 the meeting will be held on the 28 of February.\n\nMost of Shaloms' family was able to escape from Vileyka by train to Russia during the first days of the German occupation. Shalom thinks that hundreds of people from Vileyka were able to escape by trains, and most of the towns Jews survived.\n\nFrom reading the Yizkor books of other communities in the area and talking to people I know that it is not so in other communities. At the most about 10% of the Jews survived and very few of them were able to escape during the first days. Most who tried were turned back when they reached the old Polish-Russian border. Many did not try because they had no idea of the coming horrors.\n\nIn 1939 when the Russian invaded they sent people to Siberia but did not kill any.\n\nSo most people in other communities were then under the impression that only the communist Jews would be in danger from the Germans and others, especially women and children would be safe.\n\nLater I called Reuven Norman in Israel. Reuven was about sixteen in 1941. I asked him if he knew if most of the Jews of Vileyka were saved. He said that hundreds escaped by taking trains and others (like him) later on, but more Jews from Vileyka perished then escaped. He said that he would try to find the numbers. He told me that hundreds escaped because Vileyka had a train station and two trains were able to go deep in to Russia during the first days of the occupation by Germany. I asked Reuven why his family did not try to escape. He told me that his father was a guard at the palace in St. Petersburg in 1914. At the start of World War I he was sent to the front and was captured by the Germans. He was a P.O.W for four years and felt that the Germans treated him very fairly during that time. He truly disliked the communists- and said \"The Germans are very civilized people as far as my experience goes- why would they be different now?\"\n\nThe family did not question his decision. At that time the father ruled.\n\nA few weeks later, some time in July of 1941 he immediately volunteered to work when the Germans gave an order to all the Jewish man to come.\n\nWith another about fifty Jewish men from Vileyka he was a taken to work. All day they dug holes in the ground and at the end of the day they were shot and fell in the holes they dug. Some local Christians, who watched it, later told their families about it.\n\nReuven told me that he was hiding in Kurenets with his grandfathers family during the first months of the war.\n\nHis mother was the daughter of Meir Aharon Alperovitz of Kurenitz. She was a sister to Yermiyau, herzel, Shlomo and Feyga Michla Shmukler. Meir Aharon had a sister who married an Eidelman in Krivichi and had a son Michael who now lives in Florida. Yermiyahu and Hertzel Alperovitz died in the Vileyka camp. Both were very helpful to the other people in the camp and hertzel was one of the organizers of the escape. Hertzels wife Leyka survived the escape, Her sister Liba was killed and her husband Mordechai and the two children survived. After the war Leyka married Mordechai Alperowitz (the father of Yeoash). The youngest brother Shlomo was a prisoner of war since 1939. (He was in the Polish army). The family received letters from him for two years until the Germans started the war with Russia. They do not know where he perished.\n\n.\n\n-\n\nDESCENDANTS of AIZIK-YECHEZKEL GELPERYN (HALPERIN?) and his wife - RESHKE:\n\n----OP$TAMIKE FUn 'aZIK-YhZK'L GELPERYn (HALPERYn?)

Wolfe, who had them translated into English by a friend.\n\nThe town of Swir, where we saw for the first time in our lives the rays of the sun: the town that first heard our childish delight; the town where our first tears dropped: the town in which we played and joked throughout our childhood; this was the town that became a part of ourselves like our own flesh and blood.\n\nA long street with two squares and a few small alleys actually made up the whole of Swir, and despite the description it was, in our eyes, the children of Swir, nicer than any other town. Truthfully speaking there were no brick houses in Swir. It was only one side wall and all the other parts of the house were built of wood. The roofs were covered either with shingles, metal or plain straw. Throughout our lifetime many houses grew old. There were houses which were practically sunken in the earth up to the windows. Some homes did not even have wooden floors.\n\nIt was a rarity to have plumbing in the town of Swir. Most of the water was derived from a well quite far away, and yet it seemed a wonder that no one hated this place. On the contrary, everyone was tied to this town with their very lives.\n\nAnywhere a person of Swir was to be found, be it in New York or Los Angeles, in Buenes Aires or in Cuba, in Paris or in Brazil, in London or Tel-Aviv, in that place the one same heart was beating. All of them are bound like brothers and sisters, their lives like one, and all this because of the forlorn little town in a section of Vilna.\n\nThe town was very friendly. Even the nature around us was a witness that our grandparents knew where to build their homes. From one side a stream, and from the other side a lake, and the stream actually flows out of the lake near the houses of the town. Around and around were forests, fields and small towns. The town was not dipped in milk and honey, rather in green fields and flowers and as far as the eye could see were various fruit trees. There were apple and pear trees, plum and cherry trees, and blueberries without end.\n\nDuring the summer the town was surrounded by ears of corn and stalks of wheat. In the winter is was covered with a big white blanket of snow. The Jews of Swir , therefore, lived a very contented life. In the old huts there lived good people and devoted friends. Everyone felt secure in their homes, like a bird in its nest, that is, until the wild barber came and the nest together with is birds was broken and destroyed. Woe! Woe unto the faithful and devoted birds of Swir! Woe! Woe unto their burned and destroyed nest.\n\nHighlights of the History of Swir\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of historical material and documentation is missing, thus making it difficult to relate the exact history of Swir. Not only was our whole city destroyed, but also our cultural and social life was uprooted. We were physically uprooted from our very origin, as well as geographically lost. The sources for further basic knowledge are lost to us today. Unfortunately, the generation that could have enriched us with its knowledge has perished. Yet we made an effort to relate the history of this town in a concise form.\n\nIt is clear that the town carries the name of the great Duke Swerski. His dynasty ruled for hundreds of years over all the surrounding areas. It is also said that on the peak of the mountain there stood a beautiful castle. In his honor not only was the town named after him, but also tens of families named themselves after the great Duke. It was extremely difficult for us to confirm with certainty if the families today named Swirski spread throughout the world originated from Swir.\n\nAccording to all estimations the Jewish community was is existence for hundreds of years. The old cemetery can be a witness to this as most graves are sunken in the earth. The few monuments whose engraving was still legible dated back one hundred and fifty years. The ledger that had all the deaths recorded on it, and their place of burial was passed from one generation to the next, and was an important historical document.\n\nMost Jews of the town wandered in from surrounding towns or close cities. It is difficult to know today whether they came of ther own free will or because of the decree from the Czarist regime that Jews must leave the towns. Therefore, many families who were forced to leave carried the name of their town. The Fuzileher, Shpialer, Dubnikirer according to the origin of their town, for example, the Kurgatkes originated from the town of Kureniaz, Miadler and Shuentzianer. The big fire that broke out at the end of the century practically wiped out the city. Therefore there are no old historical buildings or antiques left. The synagogue was rebuilt after the fire in a modern style.\n\nThe town endured many wars. Napoleon and his army reached there. There is a legend that the Swirer hills thinned out through him. Through the First World War the town practically remained unharmed because the fighting front was further away by several kilometers. Later however, by the Polish-Bolshevik War in 1920 there was a battle before the town was captured.\n\nThe stronghold of the Polish Army was on the hill of Swir, while the yet stronger Bolshevik Red Army was located at the other side of the river. During the fierce battle between the two armies which heavily destroyed many homes, the Jews escaped to the cemetery. The cemetery was in close proximity to the city. The day after the surrender of the Polish Army the Jews returned to their homes.\n\nThey later found out that it was a coincidence that they were saved because they all hid behind the trees of the cemetery. The Russian Army saw that there were large groups of people hiding there and mistook them for the Polish. They were prepared to fire with their artillery when they heard the cry of a child and the sound of animals. They realized then that they were only civilians. In that war an eleven year old boy was wounded. He was Velvel, the son of the Chassid.\n\nThe people who remained alive claimed that after the Second World War the greatest majority of the town was destroyed. The synagogue became level with the earth. The whole area was virtually uprooted. The Christian neighbors made the area into gardens. No vestige of Jewish life, as it was, remained. Most tragic of all, was that from approximately 200 families who lived there, remained only 100 survivors. These people were scattered all over the world, but the majority of them are in Israel.\n\nGeographical and Economic Situation\n\nEven from a distance of 5 to 6 kilometers the contours of the town are visible in the blue sky and extend long and narrow. Especially visible is the hill, the Swir Everest in the middle of the market place, and the Swirer skyscraper the Yedes wall.\n\nThe German occupation of the First World War extended the railroad to Constantine.\n\nSwir is geographically located in west White Russia. The neighboring towns and distances are as follows:\n\nKabilnik - 20 Kilometers\n\nMichlisbak - 21 Kilometers\n\nSventzion - 37 Kilometers\n\nKurenetz - 49 Kilometers\n\nSmargon - 42 Kilometers\n\nAside from the fact that the town was above sea level and the paths were cemented, it was still very muddy on rainy days.\n\nIn back of the town there were lots of mud puddles. The farmers used to go to town through the mud as a short cut. In a dry summer they picked up their pants to their knees and splashed through the mud. During the fall and Spring it was impossible to pass through the mud.\n\nOn the other side of town the ground was normal.\n\nThere were 1900 people in the town of Swir - 1100 Jews and 800 non Jews. Among the gentiles there were White Russians and Poles. It was difficult to differentiate who belonged to which nationality, because many rich people found it below their dignity to admit they belonged to the White Russian nationality. They broke their teeth in order to speak like Poles and claimed they belonged to the Polish nationality. They let these people have their way, in letting them think they were Polish.\n\nThe Jews lived in \"The Street of the Third of May\", which starts at the cloister and goes till the horse market, a length of about one kilometer. That marked the boundaries of the town. Many Jews also lived in smaller streets.\n\nThe people called Staravieren and tens of families built a village at the side of the river and called Sloboda.\n\nMost of the Jewish people in Swir were merchants. In front of every house on the main street where goods were sold, there were many different types of stands. There were textile, dry goods, hardware, building materials, bakeries, butcher and other stands as well. For many people these stands were not their only means of sustenance. In many families it was the job of the wives and daughters to take care of these stands.\n\nThe men were the dealers, and dealt in many different trades. Some dealt with wheat in large scale production. They used to purchase the wheat at the market and exported large quantities to Vilna. Another dealt in the same manner with potatoes, with fruit, with poultry, with eggs, with leather skins, with pig hair and many others. There were many merchants who were occupied only during certain seasons of the year, like fruit gardeners. Besides this, there were many peddlers, and those who worked with their hands like shoemakers and tailors. The Jews of Swir received the main financial help from the bank and the town's Jewish Charity Organization. According to a report from Vilna, there were a total of 140 members who belonged to the Jewish Charity Organization.\n\nThe greatest majority of the Jewish congregation lived very modestly, and yet they were very satisfied and happy. Unfortunately, when the Second World War broke out this contented life was utterly destroyed.\n\nto look ast beautiful pictures from Svir click here\n\n-\n\nThe \"Melamed from Krasne\" had his heder in a room in Reb Yehoshua Avraham Itche's house.

The Commander of the camp was Vladimir Kuznetsov, the Chief-of-Staff Misha Gribanov, and the Commissar Ivan Kosak. We found there about 20 mud huts, a kitchen and a slaughterhouse and we also built mud huts for ourselves. Here for the first time I met Jewish partisans who had lived through the horrors of the ghetto and had witnessed the massacres. There were Jews here from the small towns of Mir, Volozhin, Krosno and others. Here I met Jewish partisans from Mir-Harhas, Galimovskaya, the pharmacist Charny and others. The latter told me about the miraculous rescue of the 300 Jews of Mir by the Jew Oswald who had served there as a German policeman. (Oswald is Shmuel Rufeisen from Zivic in western Galicia, who is now the Catholic Brother Daniel at the Carmelite Mount Monastery on Mt. Carmel in Haifa. Sefer HaPartizanim HaYehudim  The Book of the Jewish Partisans, Part 1, page 469  N.B.)\n\nThe first action in which I took part was the attack on the garrison of the German Army and the police station in the little town of Horodok (Molodeczno district), which did not succeed. Together with another twenty-five Jews, mostly natives of the town and its surroundings, I also participated in the second attack on the town (which did not succeed either). Under the leadership of the commander of the Jewish company, Leizer Rogozin, I participated in blowing up a German train. At the beginning of March 1943 I had my first face-to-face encounter with the enemy when we stumbled on a German and Lithuanian ambush near the Mashany caves on our way to blow up the railroad. We left the Volozhin forests because of a quarrel between our company commanders over girls, and we headed for the Rudminsk Forest, to General Platoun's division of the Komsomoletsk Brigade, named after Kalinin. The Commander was Ratshinski, and his deputy, Moskalov. After a while Shimiyatovitch took over the command.\n\nOur main job consisted of sabotage, mining the railroads and blowing up trains. They agreed to let me participate in these actions only after my persistent insistence at headquarters. Ratshinski ended our angry conversation by saying to his deputy: 'Take him with you, let him be killed there.' At the end of March I took part in the blowing-up of a train near the Niegoreloye station, and in honor of the 1st of May I was allowed to participate in the mining of the Baranowicz-Minsk road, and the destruction of the German cars on it.\n\nOn our way to the various actions, I had a few bizarre encounters with Jewish women who tried to pass as Christians and might have had to pay for this with their lives. Once I met two Jewish women from Minsk who had been caught by partisans and accused of spying, and only after I had questioned them for a long time, because I suspected they were Jewish, did they admit their identity and thus were saved. On another occasion I met a Jewish girl, Leah Dinerstein who lived in one of the caves under the name of Lydka Baydak and behaved like a real anti-Semite to cover up. During those days I also had a surprising meeting with a girl from Pinsk, Batya Stolar  who had come to the town from the Lida Ghetto where she had been overtaken by the German Occupation and who lived in the family camp of Tuvya Belsky. As befitting a fellow townsman, I did my best to help her with food and clothing. One day I heard that she had gone to fetch her belongings from the Lida ghetto from where she did not return.\"\n\nIn the village of Klitaszcze I met a nine-year-old Jewish boy, Maxim Katsman (his father came from Bialystok), who worked as a cowherd for one of the peasants. I took him with me to our company. He remained with us until he fell ill at the beginning of 1944 and was taken to Moscow by plane. In June 1943 we tried to rescue twenty Jews from the little town of Iwie who had remained there after the extermination of the ghetto, as they had very useful occupations. The Jews resisted our advances for they did not want to endanger Jewish partisans. In later actions I took part in the blowing-up of the Gobia railway station and in the attack on a Polish company under the command of Miloshevski. This company had cruelly murdered Jews and thanks to our intervention, it was disbanded.\"\n\n.\n\n-\n\nLast week I received from Yad Vashem the copies that I request.

Simon was born in Dolhinov (near Krasne) in 1930, the third child to his parents. Simons' mother was from the katz family (her mother was Briena Katz who was known as the \"Grandma of the partisans\")\n\nSimon and his family were hiding with the Belorussian family of Haranin who lived in the woods near Dolhinov during the three acts of the ANNIHILATION of the Jews of dolhinov. In the summer of 1942 they left their hiding place and joined other survivors from Dolhinov who (with the help of some partisans) were going to walk hundreds of kilometers in enemy territory to cross the front line to Russia.\n\nA month passed and they were in the vicinity of Pleshntziz when the German surrounded them and starter shooting. Simon's grandmother; Breina Katz, was badly wounded, the rest of the family was able to escape with many other Jews.\n\nThe next day a group of Russian partisans found the badly wounded 74 years old Breina Katz. The leader of the partisans; Gregory Stephanos of Siberia ordered the troop the bring Breina with them to the camp. one of the partisans said \"what do you need an old wounded \"Yide\" for?\" Gregory Stephanos said; \"for such disrespect you will carry her on your back all the way to our camp. Breina survived and was with the partisan troop for the entire war, She would clean and cook for them and was known as \"Our Grandmother\". On July 3 1944 Breina Katz riding a horse at head of her partisan troops was the very first person to enter liberated Dolhinov. Breina Katz died years later in Kibbutz dafna , Israel she lived there with her children , grandchildren and greatgrandchildren.\n\nBack to 1942- the group from Dolhinov was able to reach the front with Russia- the were divided to smaller groups Simon with his sister Shifra and his youngst brother Jacob were amongst the first group. They were shot at and some of their group was killed - but they survived and were taken deep into Russia. Their older borther was with the second group. they crossed into Russia safely but when they arrived into Russia the brother was mistakenly told that the entire family was killed. He joined the red army and was killed in action.\n\nwhen the family heard in 1944 that Dolhinov was liberated they sent a letter to the Haranin family and found out that Breina survived. Teenage Simon immediately left Siberia for Dolhinov to see is beloved grandmother and to look for his oldest brother.\n\nIn 1990 Simon went to Belarus and found the daughters of the Haranin family who saved his life. Since then he goes to the area about every six weeks for a week. He opened a branch of his business in Molodechno (he stays with the sisters Haranin)\n\non Most visits to the area Simon also goes to the Dolhinow cemetery and cleans the graves and he put the fallen grave stones all up with his on hands. (once he was even yelled at by a jewish woman for disrespect for the dead by putting up the fallen grave stones, The Jewish woman , a native of Dolhinov, came to visit the graves with her family from Oshmieni)\n\nSimon's information; MONROE TWP, NJ USA (305)725-2899\n\nJACK CHEVLIN FOR SIMON CHEVLIN jackjc1931\n\n. <jackjc1931>\n\nUSA -\n\nSubj: Krasnoye nad Usza (Krasne)\n\nDate: 11/11/01 8:36:07 PM Pacific Standard Time\n\nFrom: jialpert@bellatlantic.net (Jason I Alpert)\n\nReply-to: jalperti@aol.com\n\nTo: eilatgordn@aol.com (Gordon-Levitan, Eilat)\n\nFile: FAMILY.PRN (49578 bytes)\n\nDL Time (42666 bps): < 1 minute\n\nEilat, thanks for phone-call today.

This mission\n\nhas continued in America in the decades since World War II. The YIVO\n\nArchives is one of the worldâs most important repositories for materials\n\ndocumenting many aspects of modern Jewish history and culture.\n\nThe approximately 1,400 collections (record groups) that make up the\n\nYIVO Archives occupy over 10,000 linear feet. These collections consist\n\nof manuscripts, correspondence, and printed materials.

The State Archives of Vileika Region was established in 1940. Since June 1941, the activities of the Archives had been temporarily stopped by the Nazi invasion. The archives were moved to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.\n\nIn July 1944, the State Archives started its work again in Vileika. The same year, the Vileika region was reorganized as Molodechno region.
