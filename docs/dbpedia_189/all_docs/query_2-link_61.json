A typical leaf spot is a rather definitely delimited necrotic lesion, often with a brown, sometimes white, center and a darker margin. When the spots are so numerous they grow together to form large dead areas, the disease becomes a blight, or perhaps a blotch, or scorch. Certain types of lesions are called anthracnose, spot anthracnose, blackspot. All of these have been segregated out in their different sections. What is left is a very large collection of names."
