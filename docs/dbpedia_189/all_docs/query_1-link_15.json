First, on older, outer, leaves - yellow spots with grey centres, up to 12mm diam., developing into a blight. Later, on the stalks. Spread by rain splash, on wind and on seed. Survival in crop debris and seed. Cultural control: seed treatment: hot water (48Â°C for 30 min), but only treat seedÂ <3 yearsâ old; in nursery, use pasteurised or soilless mixes; use wide spacing and raised beds to improve air circulation in field; use drip not overhead irrigation; plough in remains at harvest, or collect and burn. Chemical control: seed - thiram; field â chlorothalonil, mancozeb, copper; or those in strobilurin, DMI (demethylation inhibitor) groups of fungicides, alternating with the first any of the first three.",

        "text": "Common Name\n\nCelery early blight\n\nScientific Name\n\nCercospora apii\n\nDistribution\n\nWidespread. In North and South America, Asia, Australia. The disease has been recorded from Samoa.\n\nHosts\n\nCelery\n\nSymptoms & Life Cycle\n\nThe fungus develops on the older, outer leaves first. It produces small yellow spots (up to 12 mm diameter) on the leaves and these develop rapidly in wet weather, becoming irregular in shape with greyish centres (Photos 1-3). Spores are produced mostly on the underside of the spots. The affected areas become dry and papery. When conditions favour the disease, elongated spots also occur on the leaf stalks.\n\nThe fungus survives on crop remains, and also in seed. Spores are spread short distances in water-splash, on machinery and people; spores are spread long distances by wind, and also on seed.\n\nImpact\n\nIn Samoa, the disease has been recorded on celery throughout the year, and can be very damaging on the leaves.\n\nDetection & inspection\n\nLook for the small yellow spots, enlarging to irregularly rounded spots with greyish centres. Look for the infected areas that rapidly become dry, papery, and develop into a blight.\n\nManagement\n\nCULTURAL CONTROL\n\nBefore planting:\n\nTreat seed in hot water (48Â°C for 30 minutes). Do not treat old seed (>3 years); it is less able to withstand the treatment, and the fungus does not live on the seed for more than 3 years.\n\nGrow seedlings in soilless or pasteurized media in clean trays. Check regularly for signs of disease, and discard any plants with symptoms.\n\nDuring growth:\n\nUse wide plant spacing and raised beds to improve air circulation, so that the leaves dry out as rapidly as possible.\n\nIn commercial plantings, use drip irrigation. If using overhead irrigation, time it so that plants dry out rapidly after watering.\n\nAfter harvest:\n\nDig in remains of the plants immediately after harvest to encourage rapid breakdown in the soil; alternatively, remove the plant remains and burn, bury or compost them.\n\nCHEMICAL CONTROL\n\nSeed treatment: Treat seed with thiram fungicide. Treatment with thiram will also prevent seedling damping-off.\n\nIn the field: Fungicides are commonly used to control this disease, and both protectant (e.g., mancozeb, copper formulations and chlorothalonil), and systemic products (e.g., those in the strobilurin and demethylation-inhibiting groups) are used.\n\nThis fact sheet is a part of the app Pacific Pests, Pathogens & Weeds\n\nThe mobile application is available from the Google Play Store and Apple iTunes.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nCopyright Â© 2020.
