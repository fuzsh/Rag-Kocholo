Soybean aphid (Aphis glycines) reproduces in soybeans but not green or dry beans; however, this species can colonize, inflict feeding injury, and transmit viruses to green and dry beans. Soybean aphid is found on beans in New York and the Midwest, with higher pressure in hot, dry summers. This species has been less important in New England but could increase, especially in soybean production areas. The other aphid species are all present in New England. Viral diseases can be spread by aphids; however, using insecticides to control aphids is not effective in reducing these viruses. Generally, aphids in beans are controlled by natural enemies. Scout for aphids on the undersides of leaves or terminal shoots. Treat only if aphids are well distributed throughout the field (50% or more of terminals with 5 or more aphids), natural enemies are lacking, and the population is increasing. Use selective products for other pests to conserve natural enemies of aphids and to protect bees. Systemic insecticide may be used as a seed treatment or at planting. Avoid planting beans near alfalfa or soybean. See Peppers for more information about green peach aphid.\n\nacephate (Orthene 97): 0.5 to 1 lb/A; PHI 14d dried, 1d fresh lima, REI 24h, Bee: H, Group 1B.

For early-season protection from aphids. Use standard slurry seed treatment equipment which provides uniform coverage of seed.\n\nCutworms\n\nCutworm larvae may be dull gray, brown, or black and may be striped or spotted, depending on the species. Another distinguishing quality is their act of rolling into a tight C-shape if disturbed. The two major species are the variegated cutworm (Peridroma saucia), which feeds on lower leaves and petioles, and the black cutworm (Agrotis ipsilon), which largely feeds at the soil surface and below on roots and lower stems. The black cutworm will occasionally feed on leaves. Both are nocturnal feeders and take refuge under soil clumps, stones, vegetation, and other places during the day. Cutworms find weedy or minimum-tillage fields especially attractive sites to lay their eggs. Seedlings are most affected; look for cut stems or foliage feeding. Scout across the field, as injury may be limited to a few small areas. Control is warranted if overall plant stand or survival is threatened. Caterpillars hide under the soil surface adjacent to the plant stem during the day and feed on stems after dark. For best results, make insecticide applications between midnight and dawn while cutworms are feeding aboveground. See cutworms in the Pepper and Tomato (Outdoor) sections for more information on the black and variegated cutworms.\n\nacephate (Orthene 97): 0.5 to 1 lb/A; PHI 14d dry , 1d fresh lima, REI 24h, Bee: H, Group 1B.

Spread bait on soil around plants.\n\nzeta-cypermethrin (Mustang*): 1.28 to 4 oz/A; PHI 1d fresh, 21d dry, REI 12h, Bee: H, Group 3A.\n\nEuropean Corn Borer (Ostrinia nubilalis), Corn Earworm (Helicoverpa zea), and Cabbage Looper (Trichoplusiani)\n\nThese caterpillars are occasional pests of bean in New England. See Sweet Corn for more details on European corn borer (ECB) and corn earworm (CEW), and Cabbage and Other Brassica Crops for more information on cabbage looper (CL).\n\nIn beans, ECB eggs are laid under leaves, and larvae feed in stems and then bore into pods. The bloom period is most attractive for egg-laying. If a preferred host, such as corn, is not available, eggs will be laid in beans. This may occur where early beans are planted after a corn crop the previous year, or where late beans are near a maturing corn crop at the emergence of a second ECB generation. The most susceptible period in snap beans is from the bud stage (about 26 days before harvest) to pod formation (12 days before harvest), and in dry beans is for the 4 weeks preceding the onset of pod drying. Infestation depends on the synchrony of ECB flight and bean stage. The most effective timing for a single insecticide application is at bloom or pod formation. The most practical and effective control for ECB is to avoid planting early beans where corn was grown the previous year or late beans near corn where ECB may emerge. Monitor moth activity in corn using pheromone traps or refer to pest alert networks to detect peak or high flights. Scout if flights are high during the susceptible period of bean growth, looking for wilted or chewed trifoliate leaves, larvae, or pod injury. There is no set threshold for treatment.\n\nCEW or CL may lay eggs in beans when migratory flights are very high. CEW or CL caterpillars feed on leaves, buds, flowers, and pods, often damaging the beans. CEW and CL feeding holes may be larger than ECB entry holes. The impact of these caterpillars on overall plant growth and yield is minimal, but the tolerance for caterpillar infestation is extremely low in processing beans where larval contamination must be avoided.\n\nacephate (Orthene 97): 0.5 to 1 lb/A for CL; 0.75 to 1 lb/A for ECB and CEW; PHI 14d dry, 1d fresh lima, REI 24h, Bee: H, Group 1B.

These insects are important for decomposing dead plant matter. Occasionally, high populations feed on the leaves of seedlings, producing tiny pits in the leaf surfaces that resemble flea beetle damage. Plants may die of excessive water loss. Populations can be extreme in fields high in organic matter, with reduced-till systems, and with soils that crack when drying. Use clean cultivation and spot-treat areas where damage occurs. Most broad-spectrum insecticides registered for cutworms or leafhoppers will also control springtails.\n\nJapanese Beetles (Popillia japonica)\n\nBeetles migrate from turf or pastures starting in July and skeletonize leaves.\n\nbifenthrin (Brigade* 2EC): 2.1 to 6.4 oz/A; PHI 7d, REI 12h, Bee: H, Group 3A.\n\nIsaria fumosorosea Apopka Strain 97 (PFR-97 20% WDGOG): 1 to 2 lb/A (soil applications only); PHI 0d, REI 4h, Bee: M, Group UN.\n\npyrethrin (PyGanic EC5.0OG): 4.5 to 17 oz/A; 0.25 to 0.50 oz/gal, 3 gal/1000 sq ft in greenhouse for backpack sprayers; PHI 0d, REI 12h, Bee: M, Group 3A.\n\nMexican Bean Beetle (Epilachna varivestis)\n\nMexican bean beetles (MBB) most often grow to damaging populations where snap beans are grown in the same or adjacent fields over successive years. Lima beans and dry beans are also susceptible, and MBB may feed in dry and edible-pod soybeans but are less likely to thrive on this host. Adults are copper-colored, oval ladybeetles with black spots, 1/4-1/3\" long. Eggs are orange to yellow in color and laid on the underside of leaves in clusters of 40 to 50. Larvae are yellow with rows of branched, black-tipped spines. The pupa is attached to the leaf, lacks spines, and is yellow to yellow-orange. Adults spend the winter in hedgerows and move into fields in June. Adults and larvae skeletonize leaves and may cause pod damage if numbers are high. There are 1-3 generations per year in New England, with newly emerging adults moving to the next succession planting of snap beans. A life cycle may be completed in 30-40 days during the summer. Populations are usually less abundant on early plantings and may not build to damaging levels until August. Prompt destruction of crop residue after harvest helps lower overwintering populations. Avoid continuous production of beans in the same or adjacent fields year after year. Annual releases of the larval parasitoid Pediobius foveolatus, timed to coincide with egg hatch, can help control beetle larvae. The wasp will not survive our winters, so it must be re-released each year, but it reproduces throughout the summer and moves into later plantings. Parasitized larvae serve as pupal cases for the wasp, remaining on the leaf and turning brown. Scout for MBB by searching plants for adults, eggs and larvae, and assessing damage. Treat when defoliation exceeds 20% pre-bloom or 10% during pod development. The presence of adults, eggs, and larvae indicates the potential for further damage. Be sure to get coverage of the lower leaf surfaces.\n\nacephate (Orthene 97): 0.5 to 1 lb/A; PHI 14d dry, 1d fresh lima, REI 24h, Bee: H, Group 1B.

Adults lay eggs in stems, where nymphs hatch, feed, and pass through five instars before becoming adults. The presence of nymphs indicates an established population. Both adults and nymphs cause injury by injecting a toxin as they feed through piercing-sucking mouthparts. Potato leafhoppers (PLH) overwinter in Gulf states and move north with storm fronts into the central states and then into New England on winds from the west. Arrival time varies with year and location, ranging from late May to late June. Low levels of leafhopper feeding can severely damage plants, especially at the seedling stage. Signs of injury begin with leaf veins turning pale, followed by yellowing or browning of areas of the leaf or leaf tips, known as \"hopperburn\". Leaves become brown, curl up, and die. Plants and roots may be stunted and yields reduced or lost. This process may take less than a week. PLH may also vector many viruses. Scout using a sweep net or observing adults flying when plants are shaken. Nymphs can be counted on the undersides of leaves. Seedling beans should be treated if they have 2 adults per foot of row. From the 3rd trifoliate leaf to the bud stage, treat when PLH exceeds 1 nymph/leaflet or 5 adults per foot of row, and repeat application in 7-10 days, if necessary. Be sure to treat lower leaf surfaces. In fields where a systemic seed treatment was used (e.g. Cruiser), foliar treatment should not be needed before bloom.\n\nacephate (Orthene 97): 0.5 to 1 lb/A; PHI 14d dry, 1d fresh lima, REI 24h, Bee: H, Group 1B.

They are the first maggot flies to become active in spring, about one to two weeks earlier than onion or cabbage maggot. The adults look like small, gray houseflies with a slightly hump-backed shape. The seedcorn maggot larva is yellow-white, up to 1/4\" long, legless, and has a wedge-shaped head. Pupae are oblong, brown, and about 4-5mm long. The seedcorn maggot fly overwinters in the pupal stage, in the soil where they feed in the fall. In early spring, the adults emerge and lay eggs on the soil surface. Growing degree days, using a base temperature of 39°F (4°C), can be used to predict peak emergence of the first generation (360ºF GDD or 200ºC GDD). Flies are attracted to volatiles released from freshly tilled soil, as well as to buried cover crop residues, rotting manure, compost, organic surface residues (as is found in reduced till), and organic amendments such as fish, soybean or cottonseed meal. Previously injured or diseased plants may also attract egg-laying. The eggs hatch within 2-4 days at soil temperatures of 60°F and 7-9 days at 41 to 45°F. Larvae burrow downward in search of food and penetrate seeds as the seed coat splits open. Though there are 2-4 generations per year, it is the first generation that causes the most damage. The first symptoms are usually poor emergence of seeds or wilting of transplants that have lost their roots to feeding. Look for maggots and feeding tunnels inside seeds or stems to help distinguish damage from wireworm feeding or damping off. Crops that are planted in wet soil, or soil that is too cool to support quick germination and seedling growth, are especially susceptible to damage. Wait until soil conditions favor crop emergence and growth to help seeds and seedlings avoid or quickly recover from injury. Plant shallowly to promote rapid emergence. Where possible, incorporate cover crops, manure, or compost several weeks before seeding. Put earliest plantings in lighter, well-drained, sandy soils that warm up quickly. Among bean varieties, those with a dark seed coat sustain less injury than white varieties. Use row covers to exclude flies, except where flies may have fed in fall cover or vegetable crops and could emerge under the covers. Preventive chemical treatments include commercially applied systemic seed treatments and in-furrow applications of insecticides. Rescue treatments are not effective. If there is enough damage to warrant replanting, wait at least 5 days if maggots are a quarter inch long; if they are smaller than that, wait at least 10 days to make sure they have pupated and will not damage the new seeds.\n\nphorate (Thimet* 20-G): 4.5 to 7 oz/1000 ft of row; PHI 60d, REI 48h, Bee: H, Group 1B. Apply granules in band over row and lightly incorporate. DO NOT place granules in direct contact with seed. Granules must be incorporated into the soil.

Use standard slurry seed treatment equipment which provides uniform coverage of seed. For early-season protection from seedcorn maggot.\n\nSlugs\n\nDamage appears as shredded foliage or fruit holes. Look for silvery slime trails on leaves or turn over soil clods or debris to find slugs during daylight hours. Grow plants away from moist, shaded habitats, use clean cultivation, control weeds, hand pick or crush slugs, or scatter baits on the ground near infested plants. See the Cabbage section for more information on slugs.\n\niron phosphate (Sluggo: Slug and Snail BaitOG): 20 to 44 lb/A; PHI 0d, REI 0h, Bee: L, Group 9B.

Spider mites affect dry, lima, and snap beans. Infestations begin on the lower portions of the plant and move upward. Watch for white speckling and bronzing on the upper surface of leaves (veins may remain green) and grayish webbing on the undersurface around leaf veins. Use a 10X hand lens to see mites. Avoid early-season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests; use selective products whenever possible. Registered products for mites on beans may not provide complete control of the pest. With most miticides, use two applications approximately 5-7 days apart to help control immature mites that were in the egg stage and protected during the first application. Coverage of the lower surface of the leaves is important. If further applications are needed, switch to an alternate resistance group to help prevent or delay resistance. For more information on TSSM management, see the Eggplant section.\n\nabamectin (Agri-Mek SC): 1.75 to 3.5 oz/A; PHI 7d, REI 12h, Bee: H, Group 6.

In many cases, there are other products available with the same AI. Please see Table 27 and Insecticides Alphabetical Listing by Trade Name for more information on these insecticides.\n\nThe designation (Bee: L, M, or H) indicates a bee toxicity rating of low, moderate, or high. See the Protecting Honeybees and Native Pollinators section for more details.\n\nThe symbol * indicates a product is a restricted use pesticide. See Pesticide Safety and Use for more details.\n\nThe symbol OG indicates a product is listed by the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) as approved for use in organic production. See Organic Certification section for more details.\n\nA spreader-sticker should be used with insecticides on these crops as it will help provide better coverage and more insecticide persistence.\n\nCabbage Aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae)\n\nOnly crops and weeds in the brassica family are suitable hosts for cabbage aphids (CA). Cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts are most severely affected, but other crops may become infested. Aphids tend to be more of a problem in fall plantings. Both winged and wingless adults and nymphs are grayish green with a dark head and short, dark cornicles but appear more grayish white because the body is covered with a fine, white, powdery secretion. In fall, eggs are laid on the underside of leaves of the same crops or weeds that were fed on during the summer and survive the winter on brassica host plants. This differs from the life cycle of many aphid pests of vegetables, where eggs are laid and overwinter on alternate hosts outside the field. Eggs typically hatch in April. Nymphs feed and develop into reproductive females who produce live young without mating. Winged adults disperse with wind and infest new crops. There are multiple summer generations and potential for huge population growth, especially where long-season crops are infested early. CA prefers to feed on young leaves, flower buds, or seed stalks in the upper part of the plant but also feeds on developing Brussels sprout buds. Dense colonies may develop. Feeding injury includes wrinkled and downward-curling leaves, yellow leaves, reduced growth, contamination with aphid honeydew, and contamination of the marketable parts of the plant with aphids. CA can also transmit cauliflower mosaic and cabbage ring spot virus, among other viruses; transmission is non-persistent, with virus particles passed to new plants by probing. Natural enemies can suppress cabbage aphid populations but may not be able to prevent high densities that may occur in cool fall weather. Cultural controls include soil incorporation of crop residues immediately after harvest or, for overwintering brassicas, before eggs hatch in spring. Control brassica weeds in or near fields. Check transplants to be sure they are clean. Use reflective mulch to repel aphids. Use selective products when controlling other pests to conserve beneficial insects. If CA is a consistent problem, systemic insecticides used at planting or side-dress may eliminate early infestations. Scout weekly to determine % infested plants, starting before harvested portions of the plant form. Treat if >10% of the plants are infested with aphids, especially after heads or sprouts begin to form. Or select 10 leaves at 10 sites for 100 leaves per field, and treat if >20% have aphids. Coverage of all leaf surfaces, buds, and new growth is key. Waiting until heavy outbreaks occur or just before harvest makes it hard to prevent loss of marketable yield.\n\nGreen peach aphid (Myzus persicae) can also infest brassicas. For more information, see green peach aphid in the Pepper section\n\nacephate (Orthene 97): 0.5 to 1 lb/A; PHI 14d, REI 24h, Bee: H, Group 1B. For green peach aphid.

The wings are white, and the forewing has a dark border and 1-2 round black spots. Eggs, laid singly on leaves, are about 0.125 in. long, light green or yellow, and slightly elongated, standing upright. Imported cabbageworm caterpillars are gray-green with a thin yellow line down the back, slightly fuzzy, reach 1.25 in. long, and are sluggish when touched. Feeding and resting occur on the underside of leaves, and larvae feed more heavily in the center or head of cabbage or broccoli. Damage includes round or ragged feeding holes and deposits of wet, green or brownish frass. The overwintering stage is the chrysalis (pupa), which is green or brown, smooth, with 3 pointed ridges on its back. There are 3-4 generations per year, with adults first appearing in May.\n\nCabbage looper (CL) does not overwinter in New England but arrives on migratory flights from farther south. Generally, numbers are not significant until late July or August. Adult moths are mottled gray-brown, 0.75 in. long, with a distinct, round, silver-white mark on the wing. Bucket-type pheromone traps can be used to monitor moth flight. Eggs are globe-shaped, light green or yellow, and laid underneath the foliage. Caterpillars are light green, with wavy, white, or light yellow lines down the back and sides, reaching 1.5-2 inches when fully grown. Cabbage loopers of any size move like inchworms by raising the middle of their body in a characteristic \"loop\" shape. Feeding damage from older larvae consists of ragged, large holes in foliage on both frame leaves and heads.\n\nDiamondback moth (DBM) adults are small (<0.5 in.), light brown with a yellow diamond-shaped marking, and rest with their wings folded together like a tent. Adult moths are active at dusk and during the night. Caterpillars reach a length of 3/4 inch, are light green, and are segmented and pointed at both ends. When disturbed, they wiggle vigorously and may drop off the plant on a string of silk. Feeding causes small, round holes and tends to be spread across the foliage rather than concentrated in the head.\n\nIncorporate crop residues shortly after harvest to reduce movement to successive plantings and reduce overwintering populations. Populations are suppressed by a wide range of natural enemies, and several selective materials control caterpillars and have minimal non-target effects (e.g., Xentari, Dipel, Coragen, Intrepid). Parasitic wasps that attack caterpillars include Cotesia rubecula on ICW and Diadegma insulare on DBM; their small white cocoons may be found on leaves.\n\nScout fields by checking leaves (top and bottom) on 25 plants across the field. In the Northeast, there is generally no need to treat young plants unless weather conditions delay plant development, and at least 35% of them are infested with any of these pests. Treat plants between the start of heading and harvest if 20% or more of the plants are infested. The most critical time to scout and apply chemical controls is just before head formation. Use a 10-15% threshold for kale, collards, mustard, and other leafy greens throughout the season.\n\nDo not use less than 50 gal spray material/A; higher volumes provide better coverage. Better coverage of lower leaf surfaces can be achieved by using drop nozzles. Use a spreader-sticker. Use selective materials to spare beneficials that help control aphids and caterpillars. DBM has become resistant to many synthetic and microbial insecticides. Even if you are getting excellent control of this pest with the materials presently being used, you should alternate between effective materials to retard development of resistance. Newer materials and the aizawai strain of Bacillus thuringiensis will usually provide better control of resistant DBM than older products. Use transplants grown in New England to avoid importing DBM that have already developed resistance to one or more classes of insecticides.\n\nacephate (Orthene 97): 1 lb/A; PHI 14d, REI 24h, Bee: H, Group 1B.

The first flight in April and May damages early spring brassicas, and the third flight from mid-August into September primarily injures fall root crops. Flies overwinter as pupae near the roots of fall brassica crops and weeds. Adult flies become active at about 288 growing degrees days (GDD, base temperature 40°F), which occurs 1-2 weeks after forsythia starts to bloom and when yellow rocket (winter cress, Barbarea vulgaris) blooms. Fifty percent emergence (peak flight) occurs at about 450 GDD (base 40°F). Adult flies are delicate, hump-backed, gray-brown flies with long legs, about 5-7 mm long. Small (1.1mm), white, bullet-shaped eggs are laid singly or in clumps in the top 1-3 inches of soil, near the stem. Wet areas with heavy or rich soil are attractive for egg-laying. Maggots are white with black mouth hooks, feed on roots, and grow to 8 mm. The oval, brown pupae are found close to the roots. There are 2 to 3 generations per year in New England. Root damage causes plants to wilt, turn yellow or purple, become stunted or delayed, or die. Early infestation and large pest populations increase plant losses. Eggs are killed by exposure to soil temperatures above 95°F for several days in a row, especially in dry soil. Often, these conditions occur in late May or early June.\n\nIncorporate and disk brassica crop residues after harvest to expose and kill pupae, especially in the fall. Rotate spring crops to fields that were not planted with brassicas the previous fall. Avoid spring applications of manure or compost, which increase the attractiveness of the field for egg-laying. Avoid wet fields or sections of the field. Protect spring crops with spunbonded row covers, and use covers only on rotated fields, or the flies will emerge under the covers. When seeding or transplanting, place covers over the crop and seal the edges with soil. Time your seeding or transplanting to avoid exposing young plants to peak flight periods; delay spring crops until after peak flight and when soils warm up.\n\nMost labeled materials are labeled only for use pre-plant, at the time of planting or seeding—either in the seed furrow or as a transplant drench—or immediately after setting transplants. Use pre- or at-plant treatments only if damaging populations are expected, such as in fields with high organic matter or a history of infestations. Scout transplant trays before setting out plants in the field. Treat transplants if eggs are found in the tray, in transplant water, or as a post-plant drench, as labels allow. A pencil is a good tool to gently stir the soil at the base of the plant and look for eggs. Yellow sticky cards placed near brassicas capture adult flies and, along with GDD, are a good indicator of the onset of adult flight. Scout for eggs—in transplant trays and the field—as soon as flies are active. In the field, finding an average of 1 egg per plant can indicate a damaging population. Again, control options are limited once plants are in the field, but scouting to understand infestation levels can help inform management decisions in future plantings. Resistance to organophosphate (group 1B) insecticides has been documented; rotate among chemical classes where possible to retard the development of resistance.\n\nbifenthrin (Capture LFR): 3.4 to 6.8 oz/A; REI 12h, Bee: H, Group 3.

It has 2 to 3 generations per year and is most abundant on late-season plantings. Unlike the other major caterpillar pests on brassicas, the cross-striped cabbageworm (CSC) lays its eggs in batches (3-25) rather than singly, so caterpillars emerge in clusters. Egg batches are yellow, flattened, overlapping like fish scales, and attached to the lower leaf surfaces. Larvae grow to 3/4 inches long in 2-3 weeks. The caterpillars are light bluish-grey on top and green underneath, with numerous black bands across their backs and a yellow stripe down each side. Pupation takes place in the soil near the surface. Caterpillars produce small holes in leaves until only veins remain, target terminal buds and sprouts, or may burrow into heads. Plants with larvae present are often completely skeletonized, while adjacent plants may be left undamaged. Plow under debris after harvest and control wild mustard and Shepherd's purse to help reduce pest populations. Scout weekly for caterpillars and damage. Spray if 5% of the plants are infested with CSC.

These two species feed only on brassicas and attack all types of brassica crops and weeds. Adult beetles overwinter outside cropped fields, in the soil surface and decaying plant residue of shrubby or woody borders. They search for host crops from early May into June and feed on leaves and stems, leaving small round pits and holes. Beetles hop quickly off the plant when disturbed. Eggs are laid in the soil near the plant. Tiny white larvae feed on root hairs and pupate underground. New adults emerge from mid-July through early August and feed throughout August. Spring crops are damaged by over-wintered adults, while fall crops are damaged by summer adults, but it may be difficult to distinguish the generations when pressure is severe. Feeding generally declines in September as adults leave fields for overwintering. There may be a small second generation of adults, which emerges in late September. Heavy feeding can kill seedlings, and moderate damage can stunt growth, delay maturity, reduce yield, and make crops unmarketable. Crops with more waxy leaves (Brassica oleracea such as cabbage, broccoli, and kale) are less attractive, and feeding is more restricted to leaf margins, especially as the crop matures. Crops with glossy leaves (e.g., B. rapa, such as bok choy, Napa cabbage, or B. juncea, such as mustard) are highly attractive; the whole leaf is damaged, and the crop is susceptible until harvest.\n\nEscape peak adult activity and avoid the buildup of high populations by rotating spring crops as far as possible from last season's fall brassica crops, and planting late-season crops far from early brassicas. Where feasible, avoiding all early brassicas (until July) can be used to break the reproductive cycle. Incorporate and till crops immediately after harvest to expose and kill larvae and pupae. Provide adequate water and nutrients for crop growth. Avoid soil compaction. Floating row covers provide excellent crop protection if well secured with soil or bags around all edges immediately after seeding or transplanting. Remove and replace the same day for cultivation, as needed. Use attractive brassica types (B. rapa or B. juncea) on borders or within the field as a trap crop to draw beetles from less attractive types. Spray the trap crop to suppress beetles in the whole field, and to protect the trap crop for harvest. Scout across the field by counting beetles from above, then under the leaves, and estimating % leaf damage. Because brassica crops differ greatly in susceptibility and attractiveness, no fixed economic threshold applies to all crops and crop stages. A working threshold of 1 beetle per plant or >10% average leaf damage on 50% of the plants has proved effective in leafy greens and early stages of heading brassicas. Repeated applications may be needed if pressure is high.\n\nalpha-cypermethrin (Fastac* EC): 2.2 to 3.8 oz/A; PHI 1d, REI 12h, Bee: H, Group 3A.\n\nazadirachtin (Azatin OOG): 4 to 16 oz/A foliar or drench, 4 to 16 oz/100 gal in greenhouses; PHI 0d, REI 4h, Bee: L, Group UN.

Damage may also occur on leafy brassicas such as broccoli, kale, and collard, especially fall crops that are planted near a maturing onion crop. Thrips cause rough, golden, or brown scars to form on the underside of open leaves or produce scars and discolored layers within cabbage heads. Inspection with a 10X lens shows wounds to the epidermis from the rasping mouthparts and scars from wounds that healed over. Thrips damage can be confused with oedema, a physiological disorder. See onion thrips in the Onion section for more information on identification, life cycle, and management. Damage is most severe in hot, dry weather.\n\nTolerant varieties are the most cost-effective means of controlling thrips in cabbage. Varietal resistance is generally not available in other brassicas. Consult your seed suppliers and search recent research trials regarding thrips tolerance on new varieties.\n\nAvoid thrips by not planting cabbage or fall brassica crops near alliums (onion family) or field crops such as alfalfa, clover, wheat, or oat that can harbor large populations of thrips, which may migrate to brassicas when these crops are cut or harvested. Scout young plants for presence and feeding injury. Begin applications when damage is first noticed; in cabbage, apply foliar treatments before heads form. In fall brassicas, the need for thrips controls may coincide with sprays for flea beetles or caterpillars, and some insecticides control both. Repeat applications at 7- to 10-day intervals based on scouting. Use a shorter interval in hot, dry weather. Use spreader-sticker for better coverage. Apply in the early evening, using high pressure and 100 gal water/A for best results. Systemic insecticides applied as a side dress up to 4-6 weeks after transplanting may provide adequate control in long-season cabbage. Rotate between insecticide groups to help prevent or delay resistance.\n\nacetamiprid (Assail 30SG): 4 oz/A; PHI 7d, REI 12h, Bee: H, Group 4A.

They may be dark gray, black, yellow, or brown, covered with spots, and range from ¾ to nearly 4\" long. Eggs may be laid several times yearly, and slugs reach maturity in 3-6 months. They can become abundant in low- and no-till situations, in land that was recently fallow, along hedgerows, or wherever plant debris, mulches, stones or boards provide cover and daytime hiding places. Slugs usually feed at night but may also feed during the day during prolonged periods of cloudy, wet weather. They are attracted to succulent leaves in moist environments, such as cabbage, pak choi, and Chinese cabbage. They will also feed on fruiting crops such as tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Damage appears as shredded foliage or shallow fruit holes. They have a rasp-like tongue that wears a hole through the leaf instead of making a clean cut like a caterpillar or beetle. On some thick-leaved brassicas, such as cabbage, the hole will appear larger on one leaf surface and taper to a smaller hole on the opposite surface. Scout by looking for silvery slime trails on leaves or turn over soil clods or debris to find slugs during daylight hours, or scout plants after dusk. Slug populations can also be monitored with unbaited traps consisting of 6 inch deep holes covered with foil-covered shingles, which provide a cool hiding place during the day. To control slugs, use habitat and cultural management supplemented by handpicking or trapping (on a small scale), repellents, and toxic baits. Grow plants away from moist, shaded habitats, use clean cultivation, control weeds, and eliminate hiding places. Use trickle irrigation instead of overhead to reduce humidity and moist surfaces. On a small scale, handpick slugs after dusk using gloves and drop slugs in soapy water; repeat for several days. Baits should be applied to the ground near infested plants. It may be necessary to reapply after a rain or make multiple applications when populations are high.\n\niron phosphate (Sluggo: Snail and Slug BaitOG): 20 to 44 lb/A; PHI 0d, REI 0h, Bee: L, Group 9B. Apply around perimeter, scatter around base of plants, or band down rows. Apply to moist soil in the evening.\n\nmetaldehyde (Deadline Bullets): 25 lb/A; PHI 0d, REI 12h, Bee: L. Soil surface treatment broadcast pre-planting, or band treatment between rows after formation of edible parts. Apply to moist soil in the evening. Do not apply directly to or contaminate edible portions of plants.\n\nSwede Midge (Contarinia nasturtii)\n\nRecently introduced into North America, the Swede midge is established in northwestern Vermont and is expanding its range southward and eastward. Adults are tiny (1/16 in.), weak-flying, brown flies, while larvae are translucent maggots when small and turn yellow as they grow to 1/8 inch. They spend the winter as pupae in the top 2 in. of soil. Maggots infest the tissue near the growing tip and produce malformed plants with brown corky tissue, galls, no-heads, multi-heads, and twisted leaf petioles. Damage is most severe on broccoli, Chinese broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and brassica greens. There may be 3-4 generations each year. Scout young plants near field borders and tree lines before heading or at the pre-cupping stage. Avoid importing infested plants by using New England-grown transplants. Use a 3-year crop rotation. Plant spring brassicas at least 1/2 mile from fall brassica fields. Deep plowing destroys pupae. Spring plantings may avoid peak populations later in the season. If possible, plant away from tree lines that shelter weak-flying adults. Report and confirm infestations to a state IPM specialist or the diagnostic lab.\n\nacetamiprid (Assail 30SG): 4 oz/A; PHI 7d, REI 12h, Bee: H, Group 4.\n\nBurkholderia spp. strain A396 (Venerate XCOG): 2 to 4 qt/A; PHI 0d, REI 4h, Bee: M, Group UN.
