        "text": "The botanical name of celery is Apium graveolens and is also known as Karnauli. It is also known for its medicinal properties. Celery is used to cure joint pain, headache, nervousness, gout, weight loss, blood purification etc. It is rich in vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin B6, folate and potassium. It is an herbaceous plant with average height of stalk is about 10-14 inches and has white color flowers. Stems are light green in color having leaves attached with stem which is 7-18 cm long. Leaves bear flowers which is greenish white in color that bears fruit which later becomes seeds which are 1-2 mm in length and are greenish brown in color. It is used in making stews, salads and soups. It is found mainly in Mediterranean area, mountainous parts of Southern Asia, marshes of Europe and North Africa and in some parts of India. Ladhwa and Saharanpur districts of western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Jalandhar districts of Punjab are major Celery growing states in India.\n\nIt is grown in variety of soils ranging from Sandy loam to clay, black soil and red soil having proper drainage. It gives best result when grown under loamy soil rich in organic matter. Avoid cultivation in waterlogged soils, alkali and saline soils. It requires soil pH of more than 5.6 for its good growth.\n\nPunjab Celery 1: It is the first developed variety by Punjab Agriculture University. This variety has brown color seeds. The variety of flowers in March is ready after transplantation in 140-150 days. It gives average seed yield of 4.46 qtl/acre. It gives 20.1% of total oil content.\n\nRRL-85-1: Developed by Regional Research Laboratory, Jammu. It gives 2-3% of yellow volatile oil.\n\nStandard bearer: Developed by IARI, New Delhi. It is used for salad purposes.\n\nWright grove giant: Developed by IARI, New Delhi. It is used for salad purposes.\n\nFordhook Emperor: The variety matures late and the tender leaves of this variety are short, solid and are white thick.\n\nGiant Pascal: It grows best in winters. The height of this variety is 5-6 cm long.\n\nBefore sowing apply mixture of calcium ammonium nitrate and single superphosphate @150g on the raised beds. Sow celery seeds on raised beds of 8 m x 1.25 m and of convenient width. After sowing cover the seed beds with FYM and mix well in the soil. After sowing immediate water sprinkler is necessary.\n\n12-15 days after sowing germination of seed starts. When germination begins, application of calcium ammonium nitrate at fortnight to each bed is given. For good plant size application of calcium ammonium nitrate @100g is given to each bed at the interval of one month.\n\nSeedlings are ready for transplantation in 60-70 days after sowing. Before transplanting light irrigation is given to beds so that seedlings can be easily uprooted and be turgid at transplanting time. Transplanting is mainly done in the month of mid-November – end of December.\n\nFertilizer Requirement (kg/acre)\n\nUREA SSP MURIATE OF POTASH 90 35 #\n\nNutrient Requirement (kg/acre)\n\nNITROGEN PHOSPHORUS POTASH 40 16 #\n\nAt the time of land preparation, apply well rotten FYM or compost@15 cartloads/acre and mix well in the soil. Apply Nitrogen@40 kg, Phosphorus@16 kg in the form of Urea@90 kg, SSP@35 kg/acre. At the time of transplanting half dose of Nitrogen and full dose of phosphorus is given. Apply one-fourth dose of Nitrogen after 45 days of transplanting and then apply remaining dose of Nitrogen 75 days after transplantation.\n\nDo hand weeding and light hoeing to keep the field weed free. If weed left uncontrolled then it will reduce the crop yield. For effective weed control, application of Linuron @6 kg/acre is given. Mulching is also an effective way to control the weeds. Blanching of crop is also required to increase its flavour and to maintain its sensitivity.\n\nDisease and its control:\n\nCelery Mosaic Virus: It is virus which gets transmitted to other plants by aphids. The symptoms are vein clearing, vein mottling, leaves gets curled, twisted and has stunted growth.\n\nTreatment: Spraying of Rogor30 EC@3ml/ltr or Acephate @6-8gm/ltr of water is done at the time of flowering to get rid from celery mosaic virus.\n\nDowny mildew: It is a fungal disease which is caused by Peronospora umbellifarum. The symptoms are lesions which gets darker with the maturity of plant, yellow spots on the upper surface and white fluffy growth on the lower surface of leaves.\n\nTreatment: If infestation is observed drenching of Copper oxy chloride@400gm or M-45@400gm per acre in 150 ltr of water.\n\nFusarium yellows: It is a fungal disease which is caused by Fusarium oxysporum. The symptoms are stunted growth, brownish color roots and fainted color of vascular tissue. The disease mainly gets transfer by the use of contaminated agricultural equipment’s.\n\nTreatment: If infestation is observed drenching of Copper oxy chloride@400gm or M-45@400gm per acre in 150 ltr of water.\n\nHarvesting is mainly done 4-5 months after sowing. Harvesting of plant and seeds are to be done. Plants are cut just above the ground with the help of sharp knife. Seed harvesting is mainly done when most seeds turn light brown in color in umbel. Immediate harvesting is required as delay in harvesting results in seed loss."
