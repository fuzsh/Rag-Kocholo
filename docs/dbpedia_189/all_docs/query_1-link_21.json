Groenewald\n\n·\n\nPedro W Crous\n\nABSTRACT The genus Cercospora is one of the largest genera of hyphomycetes. Cercospora apii sensu lato is the oldest name for a large complex of morphologically indistinguishable Cercospora spp. occurring on a wide host range. There are currently 659 recognized Cercospora spp., and names of another 281 morphologically identical species are included in the synonymy of C. apii sensu lato. Two of the species that belong to the C. apii complex, C. apii and C. beticola, cause Cercospora leaf spot on Apium graveolens (celery) and Beta vulgaris (sugar beet), respectively. In the present study, multilocus sequence data, amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis, and cultural characteristics were used as additional features to characterize morphologically similar Cercospora strains occurring on celery and sugar beet. From the data obtained, it is shown that C. apii and C. beticola, although morphologically similar and able to cross-infect each others' hosts, are distinct functional species that should be retained as separate entities. Furthermore, a third, as yet undescribed species of Cercospora was detected in celery fields in Korea and Venezuela, suggesting that additional undescribed species also may be found to cause Cercospora leaf spot on celery. A polymerase chain reactionbased diagnostic protocol distinguishes all three Cercospora spp.\n\nView\n\nMounes Bakhshi\n\n·\n\nMahdi Arzanlou\n\n·\n\nAsadollah Babai-Ahari\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nPedro W Crous\n\nThe genus Cercospora includes many important plant pathogenic fungi associated with leaf spot diseases on a wide range of hosts. The mainland of Iran covers various climatic regions with a great biodiversity of vascular plants, and a correspondingly high diversity of cercosporoid fungi. However, most of the cercosporoid species found to date have been identified on the basis of morphological characteristics and there are no cultures that support these identifications. In this study the Consolidated Species Concept was applied to differentiate Cercospora species collected from Iran. A total of 161 Cercospora isolates recovered from 74 host species in northern Iran were studied by molecular phylogenetic analysis. Our results revealed a rich diversity of Cercospora species in northern Iran. Twenty species were identified based on sequence data of five genomic loci (ITS, TEF1-α, actin, calmodulin and histone H3), host, cultural and morphological data. Six novel species, viz. C. convolvulicola, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. cylindracea, C. iranica, C. pseudochenopodii and C. sorghicola, are introduced. The most common taxon was Cercospora cf. flagellaris, which remains an unresolved species complex with a wide host range. New hosts were recorded for previously known Cercospora species, including C. apii, C. armoraciae, C. beticola, C. cf. richardiicola, C. rumicis, Cercospora sp. G and C. zebrina.\n\nView\n\nMarizeth Groenewald\n\n·\n\nJ.Z.

Pethybridge\n\nCercospora beticola, the cause of Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) of sugar beet and table beet, has a broad range of potential alternative hosts. The role of these hosts as inoculum sources in the field is unclear and has had limited investigation since the advent of DNA-based pathogen identification. The presence of C. beticola on alternative hosts associated with table beet fields of New York was assessed in field surveys during 2016. Lesions were collected, and 71 cercosporoid conidia were isolated for phylogenetic comparison. C. beticola was identified from Solanum ptycanthum (n = 4), Chenopodium album (n = 2), and Spinacia oleracea (n = 1), whereas C. chenopodii was identified on Chenopodium album (n = 51). Artificial inoculation of 21 plants species demonstrated that C. beticola was pathogenic to Brassica kaber, Chenopodium album, Carthamus tinctorius, Rumex obtusifolius, and Spinacia oleracea. These results indicate that although C. beticola may be pathogenic to a range of plant species, the role of symptomatic tissue for inoculum production on alternative hosts in the field appears limited. Observations of C. beticola on necrotic and naturally senescent tissue suggest saprophytic survival on plant debris of a range of species, which has implications for CLS epidemics and disease management.\n\nView"
