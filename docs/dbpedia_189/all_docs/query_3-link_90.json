        "text": "The taxonomy and evolutionary species boundaries in a global collection of Cercospora isolates from Beta vulgaris was investigated based on sequences of six loci. Species boundaries were assessed using concatenated multi-locus phylogenies, Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC), Poisson Tree Processes (PTP), and Bayes factor delimitation (BFD) framework. Cercospora beticola was confirmed as the primary cause of Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) on B. vulgaris. Cercospora apii, C. cf. flagellaris, Cercospora sp. G, and C. zebrina were also identified in association with CLS on B. vulgaris. Cercospora apii and C. cf. flagellaris were pathogenic to table beet but Cercospora sp. G and C. zebrina did not cause disease. Genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition, GMYC and PTP methods failed to differentiate C. apii and C. beticola as separate species. On the other hand, multi-species coalescent analysis based on BFD supported separation of C. apii and C. beticola into distinct species; and provided evidence of evolutionary independent lineages within C. beticola. Extensive intra- and intergenic recombination, incomplete lineage sorting and dominance of clonal reproduction complicate evolutionary species recognition in the genus Cercospora. The results warrant morphological and phylogenetic studies to disentangle cryptic speciation within C. beticola."
