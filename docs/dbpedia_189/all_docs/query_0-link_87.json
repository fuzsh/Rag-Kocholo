        "text": "PMSP Workshop FAQs\n\nHow do I develop a PMSP?\n\nData regarding a specific crop/commodity is gathered prior to and during a PMSP workshop that is entered into the National IPM Database to generate the PMSP document. PMSP Guidelines are linked here. We provide guidance and examples throughout the development process.\n\nWhat is involved with a PMSP Workshop?\n\nPMSP Workshop Guidelines are linked here. We provide templates and support to guide you through the workshop process.\n\nHow much time will be needed?\n\nA full 8-hour day is typically needed. Please refer to the sample agenda template to give you an idea of what is involved.\n\nWhat is the specific ask of those growers in attendance?\n\nGoals for the workshop include, but are not limited to, identification of the current pests (i.e., insects, pathogens, weeds, nematodes, mites, and wildlife) specific to the commodity; controls (i.e., physical, biological, and chemical active ingredients) used for pest management and the efficacy of those controls; worker activities and production practices; timelines; and establishing priorities for research, extension, and regulation.\n\nOther workshop activities include reflecting on the grower priorities. Grower engagement will help ensure that priorities for all disciplines (insects, weeds, nematodes, etc.) are covered.\n\nWhat kind of preparation would be needed by the growers prior to attendance?\n\nOur in-house evaluator can help you create a survey (i.e., pests, practices, etc.) to send out to the attendees beforehand. Please find a sample survey linked here. The responses can be entered into the online system. It is helpful to have as much data entered into the system prior to the workshop in preparation. Data can be downloaded into spreadsheets to use during the workshop.\n\nWhat will the format be for the workshop?\n\nAn agenda template is provided here.\n\nAny special breakout sessions, etc.?\n\nNot typically, but you could choose to break it into groups by pest types. Each session would need coverage for note taking and leadership. Another option is to break down the final priority reviews into sessions by education/extension, regulatory, and research. There is educational and networking value in having one main meeting without breakout sessions.\n\nWho will attend the workshop?\n\nThe workshop contributors and participants representing the states with crop production may include the Project Lead, IPM Center representatives, editors, meeting scribes, Entomology, Plant Pathology, and Weed Specialists, Extension Specialists, representatives from grower associations, private industry, regulators (EPA, Federal and State Departments of Agriculture), IR-4 and other interested parties. It is a great opportunity for networking, sharing information, and learning.\n\nHow will the regions assist during the workshop?\n\nA representative from the regional centers will be in attendance to keep the workshop flowing and on time and to answer questions. We provide a guideline of what is needed while understanding that each PMSP workshop has a unique personality.\n\nWhat does a sample invitation look like?\n\nPlease see the sample invitation provided here.\n\nWhat other items would be helpful?\n\nA checklist of items that might be useful to have during the workshop is linked here.\n\nCan Regional IPM Centers assist with workshop costs?\n\nBy pre-arrangement, the Regional IPM Centers may help with selected workshop costs that may include meeting room rental, food and beverages, and hotel rooms for participants. Please check with your regional center to see if they are able to assist with workshop costs. SIPMC requires that the workshop registration form be completed to verify workshop participants. Attendees will need to sign in at the workshop. A sign-in sheet template is linked here.\n\nAlternatively, the SIPMC project lead can apply through the RFA process for up to $10,000 to support meeting costs including travel from SIPMC and other regions. The RFA can be found at each regional website.\n\nWhat happens after the workshop?\n\nThe project lead will finalize the document after the workshop and submit it to the regional director for review. Once approved, the final version will be published in the National IPM Database and announcements will be sent out."
