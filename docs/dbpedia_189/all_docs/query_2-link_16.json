They are small initially, but usually reach a size of 2-5 x 5-15 mm (Pitkethley, 1975; Odvody, 1986). The lesions have been described as a homogeneous reddish-brown (Pitkethley, 1975), or as dark purple to red with a tan or brown centre (Mulder and Holliday, 1974). Where heavy sporulation occurs a diffuse grey colour appears on both the upper and lower lesion surfaces (Pitkethley, 1975). Heavy sporulation has a velvety appearance. Scalariform lesions have been observed in Africa, South America, Central America and North America and may be caused by a Cercospora species other than C. sorghi (Odvody, 1986). Lesions caused by C. sorghi may coalesce to form longitudinal stripes or irregular blotches (Odvody, 1986). In severe cases, leaf blight may result.\n\nList of Symptoms/Signs\n\nPrevention and Control\n\nHost-Plant Resistance\n\nResistant or tolerant cultivars should be used in areas where C. sorghi causes significant crop losses. Frederiksen and Franklin (1980) indicate the pattern of inheritance of the resistance response. Of 725 sorghum lines tested during a grey leaf spot epiphytotic in Nigeria in 1977, 18 remained free from the disease (Tyagi, 1980). Of 2116 lines screened in the Philippines in 1978-79, 19 were highly resistant to C. sorghi (Dalmacio et al., 1980). Ideally, agronomically suitable lines should be screened for grey leaf spot and other diseases in the area where they are to be grown.\n\nCultural Control\n\nRemove alternative hosts, such as ratoon or self-seeded sorghum plants. Where possible, remove native or weed species in or near the field, which may act as sources of inoculum for C. sorghi. Although no specific data are available, reduced tillage cropping practices would be expected to favour survival of the pathogen in crop residues. This could be overcome by rotation with non-susceptible crops.\n\nImpact\n\nC. sorghi is usually considered a minor disease, except where susceptible cultivars are grown in areas where wet or humid and warm conditions prevail during the growing period of the crop.Economic impact is difficult to assess because the disease appears late in the crop, as it nears maturity and other foliar diseases are commonly present as well (Odvody, 1986). In Honduras, a loss of 20% of the sorghum crop was reported to be caused by C. sorghi (Wall et al., 1989). Tarr (1962) cites a report of crop loss of about 5% in grain sorghum in eastern China due to Cercospora sp.\n\nInformation & Authors\n\nInformation\n\nPublished In\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright Â© CABI.
