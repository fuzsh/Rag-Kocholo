JOSHI, P. BURLAKOTI & B. BABU\n\nPlant Health Laboratory, Plant and Animal Health Branch, B.C. Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Abbotsford Agriculture Centre, 1767 Angus Campbell Road, Abbotsford, BC V3G 2M3Telephone: (778) 666-0581; Facsimile: (604) 556-3010; E-mail: Vippen.Joshi@gov.bc.caWeb page: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/animals-and-crops/plant-health/plant-health-laboratory\n\nABSTRACT: The British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (BCMAFF) Plant Health Laboratory (PHL) provides diagnoses of diseases and disorders caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and insect pests of agricultural crops grown in British Columbia. The PHL also makes assessments of plant parasitic nematode damage and possible abiotic factors affecting plant health. Between January 1 and Nov. 15, 2021, the PHL received 1211 samples including cannabis, Christmas trees, field crops, greenhouse vegetable and floriculture crops, forest nursery seedlings, herbaceous and woody ornamentals, small fruits, tree fruits, nuts, turfgrass and specialty crops for diagnosis. The PHL started receiving cannabis samples for disease diagnoses in April 2021. The majority of cannabis samples were submitted for detection of Hop Latent Viroid which was detected in 18% of total (389) cannabis samples. Blueberry Fruit Drop-associated Virus was confirmed (PCR followed by sequencing) for the first time in the PHL.\n\nMETHODS: The BCMAFF Plant Health Laboratory provides diagnoses of diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and insect pests of agricultural crops grown in British Columbia. Samples are submitted to the laboratory by ministry staff, growers, agri-business representatives, crop insurance personnel, municipalities, and master gardeners. Diagnoses were accomplished by visual and microscopic examination, culturing onto microbial media, biochemical identification of bacteria using BIOLOG® and serological testing of viruses, fungi, and bacteria with micro-well and membrane based (Agdia’s ImmunoStrip test) enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). Molecular techniques (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- conventional and/or real time) were used for some genus level and species-specific diagnoses. General primer PCRs (for fungi, virus, and bacteria) were followed by sequencing to identify the organism involved. Some specimens were referred to other laboratories for identification or confirmation of the diagnosis.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Overall in 2020, British Columbia had mild winter weather conditions in January followed by mild temperatures and lots of rain. The long, mild, wet spring was normal for B.C., and was followed by a very dry summer starting in late June. Extreme heat with significant high temperatures was experienced for a couple of months. These conditions created a significant stress on plants, as even the night time temperatures hit above 20-250C. Many ornamentals and berry crops experienced drought-like conditions resulting in stressed plants, small berries, and poor-quality fruit. Fire blight incidence was higher than usually seen in tree fruit, as well as woody ornamental crops. Dry weather in August was followed by very wet conditions starting in September which continued late into November bringing atmospheric rivers resulting in widespread flood conditions in parts of the Fraser Valley and some tree fruit growing areas. Damage to the plants associated with excess moisture and flooded conditions is yet to be seen in the spring of 2022.\n\nSummaries of diseases and their causal/ associated agents diagnosed on crop samples submitted to the laboratory are presented in to , organized by crop category. Between January 1 and Nov. 15, 2021, the PHL received 1211 samples for diagnosis. Crop categories comprising most of the samples in 2021 included cannabis (32.17%), followed by field vegetables (14.47%), berry crops (13.48%), woody ornamentals (8.18%), and tree fruit and grape (6.69%). All other crop categories comprised a combined 25% of the total submissions. The PHL started receiving cannabis samples for disease diagnoses in April 2021. The majority (389) of cannabis samples were submitted for detection of Hop Latent Viroid (HLVd) which was detected in 18% of total cannabis samples (). Blueberry Fruit Drop-associated Virus (BFDaV) was confirmed (PCR followed by sequencing) in one sample submitted to the lab. BFDaV was first described in British Columbia in 2016 (Diaz-Lara and Martin), but this is the first sample confirmed in the PHL (). Diagnoses not listed include abiotic disorders caused by suspected nutritional stress, pH imbalance, water stress, drought stress, adverse growing/cultural conditions, genetic abnormalities, environmental and chemical stresses including damage from herbicides, fruit abortion due to lack of pollination, insect-related injury, or damage where no conclusive causal factor was identified. More than one disease-causing agent was identified on many samples and are listed under individual disease/symptom. The frequency of diseases diagnosed in the lab does not reflect their prevalence in the field in B.C.\n\nREFERENCE\n\nDiaz-Lara A, Martin RR. 2016.

F. ELMHIRST\n\nElmhirst Diagnostics & Research, 5727 Riverside St., Abbotsford, BC V4X 1T6 Telephone: 604-832-9495; E-mail: janice.elmhirst@shaw.ca\n\nABSTRACT: Diseases of ornamental nursery and landscape plants in south coastal British Columbia submitted to Elmhirst Diagnostics & Research in 2021 and identified causal agents are listed. Rainy weather throughout the months of May and June led to high levels of botrytis on many crops. This was followed by extreme heat and drought in July-August which damaged many crops and landscape plants. This is the first report of Myrothecium roridum causing leaf rot of Peperomia ferryrae and the first report in British Columbia of downy mildew of foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) caused by Peronospora digitalidis. The northern root knot nematode (Meloidogyne hapla) was found to be causing root galls on clematis.\n\nMETHODS: Elmhirst Diagnostics & Research (EDR) provides diagnosis of diseases of commercial horticultural crops in British Columbia caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, plant parasitic nematodes, arthropod and mite pests as well as abiotic factors. Laboratory diagnostic services are provided in conjunction with on-site diagnostic consultations. Diagnosis is performed primarily by association of known symptoms with the presence of a pathogen known to cause these symptoms and identified by microscopic examination. If further identification or confirmation is needed, fungal and bacterial pathogens are isolated in pure culture for further examination of morphological characteristics or plant tissue or cultured specimens are sent to other laboratories for identification by ELISA, PCR or DNA sequencing. Problems caused by abiotic factors such as nutrient or pH imbalance, water stress, physiological response to growing conditions, genetic abnormalities and environmental and chemical stresses including herbicide damage are not included. The frequency of diseases diagnosed does not reflect their prevalence in the field.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: A summary of disease diagnoses and causal or associated agents on ornamental nursery and landscape crops is presented in . Spring 2021 was cool and wet through to the end of June, resulting in a high level of botrytis blight on many crops. This was followed by extreme heat and drought in July-August which damaged many crops and landscape plants. This is the first report of Myrothecium roridum causing leaf and stem rot of Peperomia ferryrae, although it has been previously reported causing leaf and stem rot of other peperomia species in Korea and the United States (Han et al. Citation2014) and a leaf spot of impatiens in British Columbia in 2000 (Joshi Citation2001). This is the first report in British Columbia of downy mildew of foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) caused by Peronospora digitalidis, first reported in the U.S. (California) in 2002 (Tjosvold and Koike Citation2004), Oregon in 2017 (Wallace and Crouch Citation2018), and in the nursery and landscape in Washington State (Pacific Northwest Plant Disease Management Handbook Citation2021). Both M. roridum and P. digitalidis were identified by microscopic examination of pathogen morphology in comparison to published descriptions. The northern root knot nematode (Meloidogyne hapla) was found to be causing root galls on clematis.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFoxglove (Digitalis spp.)-Downy Mildew.

FENG\n\nAlberta Plant Health Lab, Alberta Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Economic Development, Edmonton, AB T5Y 6H3 Telephone: (780)-644-3436; E-mail: Jie.Feng@gov.ab.ca\n\nABSTRACT: The Alberta Plant Health Lab (APHL) provides plant pest diagnosis and expertise to Alberta’s agricultural industry. The lab accepts samples exclusively from agricultural fieldmen, academic institutions, applied research associations and municipal pest management departments, at no cost. A total of 375 samples were processed for diagnosis in year 2021. No Dutch elm disease was identified in elm tree samples this year. Needle cast pathogens still account for largest portion of the conifer samples received. No fusarium head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum was detected in cereals. Clubroot was found in turnip and canola samples. The fire blight pathogen, Erwinia amylovora, was detected on a crab apple sample.\n\nMETHODS: Samples were submitted to APHL by agricultural fieldsmen, academic institutions, applied research associations and municipal pest management departments. Diagnoses were based on a combination of visual examination of symptoms and signs, microscopic observation, culturing on artificial media, PCR/qPCR, DNA barcoding and use of commercial diagnostic kits. Fungal barcoding was performed by sequencing DNA fragments of internal transcribed spacers (ITS) (White et al. Citation1990) and/or elongation factor −1α (EF1) (Stielow et al. Citation2015) and/or β-tubulin (Stukenbrock et al. Citation2012). Bacteria were usually identified based on DNA sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene (Klindworth et al. Citation2013) and/or cpn60 (Links et al. Citation2012). The diagnosis of clubroot was done by qPCR according to Zahr et al. (Citation2021). PCR identification of Fusarium graminearum from submitted cultures was performed following methodology from Zuzak et al. (Citation2018). For identification of Fusarium species from plant tissues, protocols described by Demeke et al. (Citation2005) were used. Phytoplasma were detected by PCR using the primer pairs P1/Tint and R16MF2n/R16MR2n (Smart et al. Citation1996). Confirmation of late blight on potato and tomato was done using the Agdia ImmunoStrip kit for Phytophthora species (http://www.agdia.com). For diagnosis of all other diseases, when PCR techniques were used, quantitative PCR (qPCR) preceded conventional PCR and probe-based qPCR preceded SYBR Green based qPCR. The primers and protocols were chosen from the most recent literature and verified by APHL using positive and negative controls.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: A total of 373 samples were processed for disease diagnosis between January 1 and December 31, 2021. Pathogens associated with disease samples comprised fungi, oomycetes, protists, bacteria and viruses. More than one potential causal agent was identified in majority of samples. Summaries of symptoms and associated pathogens diagnosed are provided in to 7, by crop category.\n\nFusarium species were commonly isolated from various cereal crop samples (). However, no F. graminearum was isolated from any of the cereal samples. There was a substantial increase in cereal leaf samples diagnosed with bacterial infection associated with Xanthomonas translucens. Pythium arrhenomanes was found to be associated with one wheat root rot sample. In addition, a phytoplasma, the causal agent of aster yellows disease was detected in two barley samples.\n\nThirty-two canola samples were infected with the clubroot pathogen, Plasmodiophora brassicae (). Twenty samples tested positive for the blackleg pathogen, Leptosphaeria maculans. Root rots caused by Fusarium tricinctum, F. culmorum, F. avenaceum and a Phoma sp. were observed in one canola sample. No Verticillium sp. was detected in nine samples that showed wilt symptoms.\n\nAn increase in potato tuber samples with virus was detected this year (). Ten of the tuber samples were infected with Potato Mop Top Virus (PMTV) and three were infected with Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV). Powdery scab (Spongospora subterranea), common scab (Streptomyces acidiscabies, S. scabies and S. turgidiscabies), soft rot (Pectobacterium atrosepticum and P. carotovorum), dry rot (Neonectria candida, Fusarium avenaceum and F. sambucinum) and tuber rot (Erwinia atroseptica and F. sambucinum) were also identified in submitted tuber samples. Wilting caused by Colletotrichum coccodes, Globisporangium ultimum and Verticillium dahliae was observed in one potato sample.\n\nOnly three legume samples were received for disease diagnosis this year (). Two pea samples had root rot symptoms associated with Fusarium equiseti, F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. avenaceum. The pathogens Rhizoctonia sp., Globisporangium sp., F. avenaceum, F. redolens and F. solani were isolated from one dry bean root rot sample.\n\nSixteen elm samples were submitted for Dutch elm disease (DED) testing; however, none of them were positive (). Plenodomus tracheiphilus was identified from most of the diseased elm samples. Other pathogens isolated from elm samples were Cytospora sp., Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium spp., Cryptosphaeria sp., Didymella sp. and Alternaria sp. The fungus Sydowia polyspora, causal agent of needle cast and needle blight, was identified in nine spruce and three pine samples. Rhizosphaera kalkhoffii, the causal agent of rhizosphaera needle cast, was isolated from one of the spruce samples. Cytospora canker caused by Cytospora sp. was found on cotoneaster, crab apple, elm, lilac, maple, poplar and spruce samples. Fire blight was detected in one crab apple sample. Fusarium spp. were isolated from apple, elm, maple, poplar and strawberry samples.\n\nNineteen vegetable samples were received for disease diagnosis (). The clubroot pathogen, Plasmodiophora brassicae, was found in one turnip sample. Streptomyces scabies was found associated with scab of beet. Dickeya zeae, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas sp. caused soft rot of carrot. Two garlic samples tested positive for phytoplasma. Pathogens including Fusarium proliferatum, F. acuminatum, F. oxysporum, F. solani, Alternaria embellisia, Stemphylium vesicarium, Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas fluorescens were found associated with bulb rot of garlic. Botrytis aclada was found causing neck rot of onion.\n\nNeoascochyta exitialis and Pseudomonas coronafaciens were found associated with a leaf spot of timothy (). Fusarium sp. and Microdochium sp. were isolated from one brome leaf spot sample. Pseudomonas syringae caused discolouration of green foxtail in one sample.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nDemeke T, Clear RM, Patrick SK, Gaba D. 2005.

In 2021, 84 plant samples were submitted to the diagnostic laboratory for identification and management recommendations. The plant samples submitted had symptoms of infectious disease (71%), insect damage (7%) and abiotic disorders (22%).\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: In addition to the scouting and forecasting services provided by the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, the diagnostic laboratory at the Ontario Crops Research Centre – Bradford (OCRC-B), formerly the Muck Crops Research Station, provides diagnostic services and management recommendations for plant diseases, insect feeding damage, abiotic disorders and weeds to vegetable growers in and around the Holland Marsh. In 2021, plant samples were submitted to the OCRC-B diagnostic laboratory by growers, IPM scouts and industry representatives. Diagnosis of plant symptoms and issues involved visual and microscopic assessment and culturing of pathogens on growth media. These samples were analysed in addition to the regular identification and quantification of diseases and insect pests provided by the pest management scouts as part of the IPM program.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The diagnostic laboratory received 84 samples between May 14 and October 20, 2021. Of these, 70% were diagnosed with infectious diseases (59 samples), 6% with insect issues (5 samples) and 24% were diagnosed with an abiotic disorder (20 samples). The percentage of samples submitted comprising each crop is as follows: onion (42%), carrot (32%), celery (11%) and other crops (15%). The 2021 growing season began with fair weather conditions, some rain which delayed seeding, changing to high temperatures and dry conditions in May and June which resulted in some wind erosion and delayed crop emergence. Conditions changed to warmer temperatures and increased precipitation resulting in long leaf wetness periods in July and August which were conducive for the development of many diseases such as stemphylium leaf blight of onion. Onion downy mildew development was sporadic and there was no serious outbreak. Botrytis leaf blight was also identified but did not cause any serious damage. The Holland Marsh received large amount of rain in September which flooded the fields resulting in many carrots lost to waterlogging. The diseases and/or disorders diagnosed on crop samples submitted to the OCRC-B diagnostic laboratory in 2021 are presented in .\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Funding was provided in part by the Bradford Cooperative Storage Ltd., agrochemical companies and growers participating in the Ontario Crops Research Centre – Bradford IPM program.\n\nDISEASES DIAGNOSED ON PLANT SAMPLES SUBMITTED TO THE PLANT DISEASE CLINIC, UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH IN 2021\n\nCROPS: Commercial Crops - Diagnostic Laboratory Report LOCATION: Ontario NAMES AND AGENCY: M.

Samples included greenhouse vegetables, annual and perennial ornamental plants, field crops, berry crops, tree fruits, turfgrass and trees.\n\nMETHODS: The Plant Disease Clinic of the University of Guelph provides plant pest diagnostic services to growers, agri-businesses, provincial and federal governments and the general public across Canada. Services include plant disease diagnosis, plant parasitic nematode identification and enumeration, pathogen detection from soil and water, and insect identification. The following data are for samples received by the laboratory for disease diagnosis in 2021. Diagnoses were accomplished using microscopic examination, culturing on artificial media, biochemical identification of bacteria using BIOLOG®, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques including DNA multiscan®, PCR and RT-PCR, and DNA sequencing.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: In 2021, the Plant Disease Clinic received samples representing over 90 plant genera for disease diagnosis. Results are presented in to . For various reasons, the frequency of diseases diagnosed on samples submitted to the laboratory does not reflect the prevalence of diseases of various crops in the field. Problems caused by plant parasitic nematodes, insects and abiotic factors are not listed. Most diseases identified in 2021 are commonly diagnosed on the respective plant hosts.\n\nMALADIES ET PROBLÈMES ABIOTIQUES DIAGNOSTIQUÉS SUR LES ÉCHANTILLONS DE PLANTES REÇUS EN 2021 AU LABORATOIRE D’EXPERTISE ET DE DIAGNOSTIC EN PHYTOPROTECTION DU MINISTÈRE DE L’AGRICULTURE, DES PÊCHERIES ET DE L’ALIMENTATION DU QUÉBEC\n\nCULTURES: Échantillons reçus en 2021 au Laboratoire d’expertise et de diagnostic en phytoprotection (LEDP), regroupant de nombreuses cultures RÉGION: Québec NOMS ET ORGANISME: A.-M.

Du 1er janvier au 23 novembre 2021, 2631 échantillons ont été traités dans la section phytopathologie du LEDP. En ordre d’importance, les échantillons reçus comprennent des plantes maraîchères (serres et champs), des arbres et arbustes fruitiers, des petits fruits, des grandes cultures et céréales, des plantes à usage industriel, des plantes ornementales herbacées, des plantes fourragères, des arbres et arbustes ornementaux (serres et pépinières) ainsi que des plantes aromatiques et médicinales.\n\nMÉTHODES: Le laboratoire de phytopathologie du LEDP offre des services de diagnostic et de détection des maladies parasitaires aux conseillers agricoles, aux producteurs, aux particuliers et aux instances gouvernementales. Les données présentées ci-dessous concernent les maladies identifiées sur les échantillons de plantes reçus en 2021. Les échantillons reçus font d’abord l’objet d’un examen visuel, généralement suivi d’examens au stéréomicroscope et au microscope photonique. Selon les symptômes observés, un ou plusieurs tests diagnostiques sont réalisés dans le but de détecter ou d’identifier l’agent ou les agents phytopathogènes.\n\nVoici les principaux tests de laboratoire réalisés afin d’appuyer le diagnostic: les nématodes vermiformes sont extraits du sol et des tissus végétaux par la méthode de l’entonnoir de Baermann, tandis que les nématodes à kystes sont extraits du sol à l’aide d’un appareil de Fenwick. Leur identification (au genre et, lorsque possible, à l’espèce) est réalisée par un examen microscopique des caractères morphologiques et par des techniques de biologie moléculaire. Ditylenchus sp. est détecté dans la plante par réaction en chaîne par polymérase (PCR). Les champignons et oomycètes sont isolés sur des milieux de culture gélosés et identifiés selon leurs caractéristiques morphologiques et/ou par le séquençage de certains gènes. Plusieurs espèces sont détectées dans la plante par des outils de biologie moléculaire (PCR, qPCR). Les bactéries sont isolées sur des milieux de culture gélosés, puis identifiées à l’aide de tests biochimiques BiologR et/ou par le séquençage de certains gènes. Comme pour les nématodes et les champignons, certaines espèces de bactéries sont détectées dans la plante par des outils de biologie moléculaire (PCR, qPCR). Les phytoplasmes sont détectés par des techniques de biologie moléculaire (PCR nichée et séquençage d’ADN). Les virus, quant à eux, sont détectés par des tests sérologiques ELISA ou par RT-PCR, PCR ou RT-qPCR.\n\nRÉSULTATS ET DISCUSSIONS: Les présentent le sommaire des maladies identifiées sur les échantillons de plantes reçues, quelle que soit leur origine (champ, serre ou entrepôt). Notez que le nombre de maladies rapportées ne correspond pas au nombre d’échantillons réellement reçus et traités durant l’année puisque plus d’un problème peut être identifié sur un même échantillon (plante reçue) et que le diagnostic de certains cas n’a pas été inclus dans ce rapport. Cela concerne notamment les causes indéterminées, les causes incertaines ou hypothétiques, les détections négatives et les données potentiellement nominatives. Étant donné que les problèmes abiotiques (non parasitaires) diagnostiqués sur les échantillons sont, en majorité, de nature hypothétique, ils ont rarement été cités dans ce rapport; ces diagnostics sont établis en fonction de l’observation des symptômes, du résultat de certains tests de laboratoire et d’informations obtenues à la suite de discussions avec les clients.\n\nREMERCIEMENTS: Les auteurs remercient Marion Berrouard, Dominic Lafleur, Kariane Pouliot, Chantal Malenfant, Jaëlle Falardeau, Ludovic Jacques, Carolle Fortin et Annie-Pier Hachey pour leur assistance technique ainsi que les étudiants, Louis Robitaille, Paul-Émile Gareau, Carlos-Mario Jimenez et India-Jane Tremblay.\n\nDISEASES DIAGNOSED ON PLANT SAMPLES SUBMITTED TO THE NEW BRUNSWICK DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, AQUACULTURE AND FISHERIES PLANT DISEASE DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY IN 2021\n\nCROP: Diagnostic Laboratory Report LOCATION: New Brunswick NAME AND AGENCY: M.T.

In 2021, a total of 256 diagnoses were completed on a total of 135 samples processed. Among potato foliar diseases, brown spot and early blight were detected more frequently in 2021 than in the previous two seasons. No potato late blight was observed. Forty-five apple samples were submitted and diseases identified included black rot and sudden apple decline (SAD) which was associated with Cylindrocarpon sp., Fusarium sp., Phytophthora sp. and Pythium sp. Six samples tested for fire blight were negative. The fusarium head blight fungus, Fusarium graminearum, was detected in barley, Puccinia striiformis (stripe rust) was observed on winter wheat, and Plasmodiophora brassicae (clubroot) was isolated from canola roots.\n\nMETHODS: Samples for disease diagnosis are submitted to the PDD laboratory by agriculture extension staff, researchers, producers, greenhouse growers, agri-business representatives, crop insurance agents, and the general public. Diagnoses are based on a combination of investigative work, visual examination of symptoms, microscopic observations, and culturing onto artificial media. When additional confirmation is necessary, culture samples may be sent to other laboratories with producer’s consent for identification of associated pathogens by other means such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nRESULTS: A total of 256 diagnoses were completed on a total of 135 samples processed during the period of June 7 to October 29, 2021. A summary of the diseases and disorders diagnosed per crop on samples submitted in 2021 is provided in . The diagnoses reported do not necessarily reflect the major disease problems encountered in the field during the season, but rather those most prevalent within the samples submitted. Samples submitted to the diagnostic laboratory which were associated with insect damage are not included in this report. Categories of samples received were potatoes (49.83%), fruit crops (33.45%), cereal crops (5.57%), cole crops (4.88%) and other crops (6.27%).\n\nThe 2021 year had optimum growing conditions for various crops including potato, corn, cereals and fruit. No potato late blight infections were reported or identified since the level of inoculum was very low and growers continued to carry out improved management practices along with their spray regimes correlated with spore trapping surveillance. Among potato foliar diseases, brown spot and early blight were detected more frequently in 2021 than in the previous two seasons. The Fusarium oxysporum fungus was isolated more frequently from potato seed that were breaking down due to fusarium dry rot, and from plant stems with wilt infection. Other Fusaria isolates involved in seed piece decay included Fusarium solani, Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum. Potato blackleg infections continued to be observed this season and were found in ‘Russet Burbank’, ‘Satina’ and ‘Colomba’ varieties. Blackleg is primarily a seed-borne disease that is often associated with cool, wet soil conditions, but new strains can develop under dry conditions. The physiological disorder, pinkeye, was identified this season in the ‘Clearwater Russet’ and ‘Alverstone’ varieties. Pinkeye symptoms appear at or before the end of the harvest period and usually disappear in storage as the tuber dries up. However, this tissue is vulnerable to invasion by soft rot bacteria such as Pseudomonas sp. and Pectobacterium.\n\nA total of 45 apple samples were submitted to the PDD laboratory; diseases identified included black rot and sudden apple decline (SAD). Microorganisms involved in the SAD disease included Cylindrocarpon sp., Fusarium sp., Phytophthora sp. and Pythium sp. Six samples tested for fire blight were negative. The PEI PDD continues to be involved in a regional research survey project for SAD.\n\nFinally, in barley crops, the fusarium head blight fungus, Fusarium graminearum, was detected in glumes that had no typical salmon-coloured symptoms, the Puccinia striiformis (stripe rust) fungus was observed on leaves of winter wheat, and the clubroot organism, Plasmodiophora brassicae, was isolated from canola roots.\n\nDiagnoses were also completed this season on new crops such as luffa, turf grass, garlic, and watermelon.\n\nCEREALS/CÉRÉALESSURVEY OF CEREAL CROP DISEASES IN BRITISH COLUMBIA DURING THE 2020 AND 2021 GROWING SEASONS\n\nCROPS: Wheat and Barley LOCATION: British Columbia Peace River Region NAMES AND AGENCIES: V. FETTERLEY1, R.K. BAMRAH1, B. YADAV1, K. ULOTH2 & G.S. BRAR1\n\n1The University of British Columbia, 2357 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4 Telephone: (604) 827-5274; Facsimile: (604) 822-6394; E-mail: gurcharn.brar@ubc.ca 2BC Pest Monitoring Network, Dawson Creek, BC\n\nABSTRACT: Cereal crops were surveyed in the Peace River Region of British Columbia for foliar disease in July during the 2020 and 2021 growing season. In total, 22 fields were surveyed in 2020, and 43 in 2021 (). In both years, disease pressure was low. In 2021, the low disease pressure was likely attributable to the warm and dry weather experienced throughout the 2021 growing season in western Canada. Stripe rust was observed on wheat in 2020. Loose smut was observed on wheat in 2021, and on barley in the two years surveyed.\n\nLocation of fields surveyed in 2020 (red) and 2021 (blue), in the Peace River region of British Columbia.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: During the 2020 growing season, crops were surveyed on July 16 and 17. In total, three barley and 19 wheat fields were assessed for foliar diseases. In 2021, 15 barley and 28 wheat fields were surveyed. All the fields surveyed were selected at random around Fort St. John and Dawson Creek with an aim to cover the whole BC Peace Regional Agricultural District. Crops between the late booting and hard dough stage were assessed for foliar disease. A 5-category scale was used for stripe rust to assess disease severity in each field during the 2020 growing season: clean (no visible symptoms); trace (<3% leaf area affected); light (3-15%); moderate (>15-20%); and severe (>20%).\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Of the 15 barley fields surveyed in 2021, three were free of any disease. Scald was observed in trace amounts on lower leaves in seven fields. Low incidences of net blotch and loose smut were observed in three of the surveyed barley fields and one field had severe levels of loose smut. Signs of bacterial leaf streak were observed in two of the 15 surveyed barley fields and fusarium head blight (FHB) was observed on one spike. During the 2020 growing season, trace levels of leaf spot were observed in two fields of 2-row barley. The only 6-row barley field surveyed had a moderate to high severity of loose smut (10 smutted heads in 6 m of row). The same field had 0-5% incidence of barley scald on the flag and penultimate leaves.\n\nDuring the 2020 growing season, a total of 19 wheat fields were surveyed and 11 had no disease except trace levels of leaf spots on the lower canopy. Three fields surveyed showed light to moderate leaf spot severity on flag leaves and the lower canopy. Two wheat fields had trace to light levels of stripe rust.\n\nAmong the 28 wheat fields surveyed in 2021, 20 showed no signs of any disease. Loose smut was observed in three fields, but only one had severe levels. Silver heads, caused by the wheat stem maggot, were observed in five fields. Both years, stripe rust was observed on wild foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum) growing in and around two wheat fields, but no sign of rust was observed in cereal crops in the 2021 growing season.\n\nIn summary, more than 50% of the barley and wheat fields surveyed in Peace River region of British Columbia were free of disease in both years. In the 2021 growing season, diseases were generally found in trace amounts, although severe levels of loose smut were observed in one barley and one wheat field. The 2021 growing season was marked by very dry weather, explaining the low disease incidence observed. Wheat and barley plants at the booting stage were more affected by the drought and were shorter than crops past the anthesis stage. Although warmer weather tends to result in lower disease pressure on crops, such conditions can severely impact the yield of non-irrigated fields.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: We acknowledge the financial support provided by the BC Peace River Grain Industry Development Council (BC-GIDC), the Peace Region Forage Seed Association, as well as the BC Hydro Agricultural Compensation Fund.\n\nSTRIPE RUST OF CEREALS IN ALBERTA, 2021\n\nCROPS: Wheat, Barley LOCATION: Alberta NAMES AND AGENCY: B.

ABOUKHADDOUR\n\nLethbridge Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 5403 1st Avenue South, Lethbridge, AB T1J 4B1 Telephone: (403) 317-2222; Facsimile: (403) 382-3156; E-mail: reem.aboukhaddour@agr.gc.ca\n\nABSTRACT: During the 2021 growing season, a lack of stripe rust infection was remarkable in southern Alberta. In total, 28 cereal fields were surveyed for stripe rust and leaf spot incidence and severity. Data were collected from nine barley fields and 19 wheat fields comprising six spring wheat and 13 winter wheat fields. The survey area was bounded by Highway #522 in the north, Township Road 40 in the south, Highway 2 in the west and Range Road 145 in the east. Stripe rust was found in only one barley field at trace level, and no stripe rust infection was reported on wheat. Leaf spots were found in eight barley fields and 12 wheat fields. The most severe leaf spot infection was found in Lethbridge, with a severity rating of over 50%. High temperatures and record dry weather in spring and summer resulted in solar damage on several cereal fields and hindered development of stripe rust and leaf spot disease.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: Commercial cereal fields, including winter wheat, spring wheat and barley, were surveyed in southern Alberta from early July to early August, 2021. Data were collected from nine barley fields and 19 wheat fields comprising six spring and 13 winter wheat fields. The survey area was bounded by Highway #522 in the north, Township Road 40 in the south, Highway 2 in the west, and Range Road 145 in the east. Fields were evaluated for both disease incidence and severity in a ‘W’ pattern until 10 sites separated by approximately 25 m were assessed. Incidence was assessed as the number of diseased plants within 1-m2. The severity of leaf spot diseases was rated as the average percentage of the total flag leaf surface area covered with lesions. The severity of stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis Westend.) was evaluated as the average percentage of the total flag leaf surface area covered with stripes, per plant. Based on the disease severity level, fields were classified as clean (0%), trace (1-3%), light (3-5%), moderate (6-19%) or severe (20-100%).\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: In total, 28 commercial fields were surveyed, consisting of 19 wheat fields and nine barley fields (, ). Among the nine barley fields, one field was clean but with solar damage on leaves and the other eight fields were infected with leaf spots pathogens. Three infected barley fields were rated as severe, three as moderate, and one as a light disease level. One barley field was affected by a complex of foliar diseases, including leaf blotch, net blotch and stripe rust. Among the surveyed wheat fields, 10 fields were rated as having a severe infection level, consisting of four winter wheat and all six spring wheat fields. Two winter wheat fields were moderately affected by leaf spots. Seven winter wheat fields were clean. Solar damage on leaves was occasionally observed in two winter wheat fields. Hail damage was found in one spring wheat field in Spring Coulee. Due to the high temperatures and dry conditions this spring and summer, there was no stripe rust infection observed in Alberta and leaf spots were found less frequently compared to previous years.\n\nMap showing surveyed fields in 2020; blue pins indicate wheat fields and pink pins indicate barley fields.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAboukhaddour R, Gourlie R, Despins T, Harding M, Klein-Gebbinck HW, Feng J, McCallum B. 2021.

Foliar fungal diseases such as tan spot, speckled leaf blotch, and stagonospora leaf blotch were rated together as a leaf spot complex. Stripe rust, powdery mildew, bacterial leaf streak and wheat streak mosaic virus symptoms were also evaluated. Finally, other root and head diseases (take all, ergot, smut) were noted. Symptoms of leaf spots were reported in 91% of fields, however the hot, dry conditions that persisted across many regions of Alberta during the summer of 2021 prevented significant disease development. Overall, leaf spots were either absent, or had caused light severity in over 60% of fields, while stripe rust was not observed on wheat in Alberta in 2021.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: Foliar diseases on wheat can reduce yield and quality of grain due to the energy drain by the pathogen, and limiting photosynthetic capacity. Some infections can also cause rupturing of the leaf epidermis and subsequent moisture loss, while some leaf pathogens can directly affect the head and developing kernels.\n\nWheat fields were surveyed between the late milk and hard dough ages from June 20 to August 5, 2021. Seventy-nine fields in 21 counties were evaluated (). Disease severity and percent leaf area damaged (PLAD) were recorded. In-field assessments were performed at five points along a ‘diamond-shaped’ sampling pattern with the first point a minimum of 25 m into the field, and remaining points 25 m apart. Disease symptoms at each sampling point were rated for leaf spot severity using a 0-9 scale modified from Saari and Prescott (Citation1975), and stripe rust severity using a 0-100% scale (Chen [date unknown]). For other diseases (wheat streak mosaic, ergot, smut, bacterial leaf streak and take-all), a 0-3 rating (0=absent, 1=trace, 2=moderate, 3=severe) was recorded. Finally, 10 to 12 flag leaves were randomly collected into labelled paper bags at each of the five sampling points in 72 fields, and then air dried for 24-48 hours in a cool dry room and stored at 4°C. The collected leaves were assessed for percent leaf area damaged (PLAD), and will be used for determination of causal agents.\n\nWheat disease survey locations, and leaf spot severity categories, Alberta, 2021.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Fungal leaf spot symptoms were present in 91% of fields and generally at light to moderate severity (). The average severity of disease was 3.3 on the 0-9 scale and severity values ranged from 0 to 9. The average PLAD was 11.3% and ranged from 0% to 70% (). Stripe rust was not observed in any of the wheat fields surveyed in Alberta in 2021. Sixty of the fields were scored for the presence of five other diseases and bacterial leaf streak was reported in 16.7% fields at trace to moderate levels (). Fields with bacterial leaf streak were located almost exclusively in southern Alberta. Ergot was seen in 5% of fields at trace levels, while wheat streak mosaic and smut were observed at trace levels in one field each. Take-all symptoms were not reported in any of the fields surveyed.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nSaari EE, Prescott JM. 1975. A scale for appraising the foliar intensity of wheat diseases.

Disease assessments were typically done using two approaches, the first based on a 0-9 rating scale where 0 was no disease development in the lower, middle and upper canopy, and 9 was >50% leaf area diseased. The second approach for leaf spots involved rating penultimate leaf samples for percentage leaf area diseased. Ratings for other diseases were based on incidence and/or presence or absence, especially where only trace levels were found. Overall, leaf disease levels were much lower than in previous years due to the hot, dry growing conditions across the province. No stripe rust was observed in 2021, while loose smut was only noted in 15 fields, and suspected bacterial leaf streak was observed in one field.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: A survey to document diseases of barley was conducted in 71 fields across Alberta from July 20 – August 5, 2021, with evaluations being done at the late milk to soft dough stage. The fields were typically traversed in a diamond pattern starting at least 25 m in from the field edge, with visual assessments made at each of five locations at least 25 m apart. Disease symptoms at each sampling point were rated for leaf spot severity using a 0-9 scale modified from Saari and Prescott (Citation1975). A rating of 0 was no disease development in the lower, middle and upper canopy, and 9 was >50% leaf area diseased. In addition, penultimate leaves were collected from 54 fields and rated for the percentage leaf area diseased (PLAD) due to scald, net-form net blotch and other leaf spots (a combination of symptoms due to spot-form net blotch (Pyrenophora teres f. maculata), spot blotch (Cochliobolus sativus), and physiological leaf spotting). Other diseases (loose smut, stripe rust, bacterial leaf streak, and root rots where stunting and/or premature ripening of plants occurred and were associated with root or stem base symptoms) were rated based on incidence and/or presence or absence, especially where only trace levels were found. Following the survey, a representative tissue sub-sample of diseased plant parts collected at each location was cultured in the laboratory for pathogen isolation and identification.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Weather conditions across the region were generally hot and dry for the entire growing season. Survey results are presented in for 61 fields rated using the 0-9 rating scale. Based on the 0-9 assessments, scald (Rhynchosporium commune) was present in 30 of the 61 fields with 25 of those fields having low levels with ratings from >0-3, another five fields having levels of 4-6, while no fields had higher levels of 7-9 on a 0-9 rating scale (). Net-form net blotch (Pyrenophora teres f. teres) was found in 21 of the 61 fields, although some of these fields only had trace levels (). Sixteen fields had low levels with ratings from >0-3 and another five fields had levels of 4-6 on the 0-9 scale. Other leaf spots were found in 53 of the 61 fields with 35 of those fields having ratings from >0-3 and another 18 fields having ratings from 4-6 (0-9 scale).\n\nFor the penultimate leaves, there were a total of 71 fields sampled; however, in three fields the leaves were too senesced to rate, while in five fields only the 0-9 scale was used to rate disease. Finally, nine fields reported only ranges in incidence and severity. As a result, PLAD is reported for 54 fields (). Based on PLAD assessments, scald was absent in 21 fields, but was present in 33 of 54 fields, with 29 of those fields having low levels with ratings from >0-3 and another four fields having levels of 4-7 (). Net-form net blotch was found in 16 of 54 fields, with 12 of those fields having a low PLAD from >0-3, one field with 9.5 PLAD, and three fields with 14-37.5 PLAD. Other leaf spots were found in 47 of 54 fields, with 30 of those fields having a low PLAD from >0-3, 14 fields having 3-10.6 PLAD, and three fields having ≥20 PLAD. Overall, total leaf disease severity averaged 5.5 PLAD with 100% of fields with symptoms and a range of 0.02-38 PLAD (). These other leaf spots were identified in the laboratory and Cochliobolus sativus, the causal agent of spot blotch, was isolated from four of the 54 fields, while P. teres f. maculata (spot-form net blotch) was isolated from 10 of the 54 fields, and Septoria spp. were isolated from six fields. The saprophytic fungi Alternaria spp. and Epicoccum spp. were isolated from 38 and 13 of the 54 fields, respectively. The presence of these saprophytes is often associated with dead plant tissues resulting from physiological issues and/or disease-related damage.\n\nIn the nine fields where ranges were reported, the leaf spot complex (one or more of net-form net blotch, spot-form net blotch/spot blotch, scald) was present in most fields at low to moderate severities (percentage leaf area affected ranged from 0 to 60%), although one field without symptoms was suspected of having sun damage.\n\nLoose smut (Ustilago nuda) was found at trace levels in 15 of the 61 barley fields surveyed in 2021, while one field in Alberta had moderate levels.\n\nNo stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis) was found in any of the 61 commercial barley fields surveyed. Low levels of bacterial leaf streak were found in one field, while 27 fields had trace to moderate levels of root rot, and two fields had trace levels of ergot.\n\nOverall barley leaf disease levels in 2021 were much lower than in the previous year (Rauhala and Turkington Citation2021).\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: The authors would like to acknowledge the support of summer students, graduate students and technicians Avy Lamb, Kathleen McHugh, Lexie Herspiegel, Bohan Wei, and Jeremy Hodges.

These were kindly mailed by participating producers to the Lacombe Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC). Disease assessments were done by AAFC staff by rating the percentage area of the flag leaf that was diseased by the leaf spot complex. Overall, leaf disease levels were generally low and this was likely due to the hot, dry growing conditions across the province. No stripe or leaf rust were observed in the samples collected in 2021.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: A survey to document leaf diseases of wheat was conducted in 11 fields across Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba in August 2021, with leaf collections being done by volunteer producers at the late milk to soft dough stage. Participating farmers were each sent a kit with survey instructions and materials to randomly collect five flag leaves at each of five sampling sites along a ‘diamond-shaped’ sampling pattern, for a total of twenty-five leaves per field. In addition to the sampling kit, a questionnaire was included to collect cropping practice information related to rotation, tillage practices, variety, etc. Leaf samples, along with answers to the questionnaire, were returned to AAFC Lacombe by mail for rating, assessment of causal agents, and tabulation of questionnaire results. Leaf samples were rated for wheat leaf disease symptoms, including tan spot (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis), the septoria complex (Zymoseptoria tritici and Parastagonospora nodorum), spot blotch (Bipolaris sorokiniana) and physiological leaf spotting, and were checked for the presence of leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) and stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis). Each leaf was rated for percentage leaf area affected and averages were calculated for each field. Other issues, such as bacterial leaf streak, were also noted and rated if present. Representative leaf samples from each field were placed in moist chambers and incubated for up to 48-72 hours to promote pathogen sporulation. Causal agents and other saprophytic fungi were identified based on fruiting structures and/or spore morphology.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Sampling kits were prepared and producers contacted in late June/early July with kits being sent out to volunteer producers over the following weeks. Unfortunately, the summer of 2021 was challenging for wheat producers given the wide spread occurrence of hot dry weather conditions. This resulted in much more rapid crop development and as a consequence, in some cases, crops were too advanced for producers to sample. Based on our experience in 2021, the PBN will be contacting volunteer producers in late spring followed by distribution of kits before the end of June 2022.\n\nIn total, samples from 11 wheat fields were sent back for rating and tabulation of cropping information. Samples from single fields were submitted from Alberta (AB) and Saskatchewan (SK), and from a total of nine Manitoba (MB) fields. Overall, the average proportion of leaf area affected was 5.7%, with average values of 2.9%, 1.1%, and 6.6% for AB, SK, and MB, respectively (). No stripe rust or leaf rust was observed in the samples collected. Assessment of causal agents indicated that symptoms in four of 11 fields were associated with spot blotch (Bipolaris sorokiniana), while the causal agents of tan spot and the septoria complex were not observed in these fields. In one field, the causal agents of the septoria complex were noted, while the causal agents of tan spot and spot blotch were not observed. The causal agent of tan spot was not observed in any of these fields. Overall, the main fungi observed from all fields were the saprophytes Epicoccum spp. and Alternaria spp. It is suspected that a significant proportion of symptoms may have been due to stress responses, i.e., physiological leaf spotting, especially in fields where the causal agents of tan spot, the septoria complex and spot blotch were not observed. Saprophytes don’t cause damage to leaf tissue, but infect after the leaf has already been damaged due to a pathogen, or heat stress, drought, hail damage, etc. There was diversity in the varieties grown and sampled, which included AAC Brandon (2); AAC Elie (1); AAC Leroy (1); AAC Redberry (1); AAC Starbuck (2); AAC Wheatland (2); Cardale (1); and Prosper (1). Given the small number of samples it is challenging to associate and compare the disease levels observed with the cropping practices indicated.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: The authors would like to acknowledge the support of participating farmers and the assistance of the Manitoba Crop Alliance, Alberta Barley, and Saskatchewan Barley Commission with identifying potential collaborators.

Stagonospora avenae and Pyrenophora avenae were found in 26% of the oat crops surveyed. In barley, Pyrenophora teres f. teres was the most prevalent pathogen, found in 27% of the crop surveyed.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: In 2021, 30 oat fields and 30 barley fields were surveyed in Saskatchewan. Surveys were conducted by the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation between late July and early August. Samples were collected when crops were at early milk to soft dough stage. The overall severity of leaf spots in the upper canopy was assessed and rated as trace (1-2% leaf area affected), light (3-15%), moderate (16-40%), or severe (41-100%). Ten flag leaves were collected from each crop surveyed. Leaves were cut into 1 cm-long pieces for plating. Leaves were sterilized in 70% ethanol and triple rinsed with sterile distilled water, then dried before being plated onto acidified potato dextrose agar. Plates were incubated under light at room temperature and pathogens were identified after four days based on morphology (Zillinsky Citation1983). Kernels were harvested from 30 panicles of oats. Panicles were threshed and kernels sterilized in 5% bleach solution before triple rinsing with sterile water. Kernels were plated on acidified potato dextrose agar and left for five days under light at room temperature before pathogens were identified according to morphology (Zillinsky Citation1983, Leslie and Summerell Citation2006). Disease prevalence was defined as the percentage of fields affected by each disease out of all fields surveyed.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Oat leaf pathogens were identified in 57% of oat crops surveyed, which was higher than the previous year (29% in 2020). The overall disease severity in the upper leaf canopies was trace (1-2% leaf area affected) to light (3-15% leaf area affected). Pathogens detected in the oat leaf samples were Stagonospora avenae (cause of septoria blotch; 26% of the crops surveyed), Pyrenophora avenae (cause of leaf blotch; 26% of the crops surveyed) and Cochliobolus sativus (cause of spot blotch; 17% of the crops surveyed). The frequency of the individual pathogens expressed as a percentage of total pathogens isolated was 37%, 34% and 29%, respectively (). In addition to leaf pathogens, Alternaria spp. were detected in 100% of the crops surveyed and Epicoccum spp. were detected in 17% of the crops surveyed. In oat grain samples, four different Fusarium spp. (F. poae, F. avenaceum, F. graminearum and F. nivale) were identified, which are causal agents of fusarium head blight (FHB). Prevalence (% of fields surveyed with the pathogen) was 43%, 13%, 10% and 3%, respectively (), which was lower than last year. In 2020, prevalence of F. poae, F. avenaceum and F. graminearum was 76%, 41% and 16%, respectively.\n\nIn barley, trace to light levels of disease severity were observed in the upper leaf canopies. Leaf pathogens were identified in eight (27%) of the 30 crops surveyed. Only Pyrenophora teres f. teres (cause of net blotch) and Cochliobolus sativus (cause of spot blotch) were identified in leaf samples. Pyrenophora teres f. teres was the most frequently identified pathogen with a prevalence of 27% and frequency of 65%. The prevalence of Cochliobolus sativus was only 3% and the frequency was 35%. Two saprophytes, Alternaria spp. and Epicoccum spp. were also detected at a prevalence of 100% and 77%, respectively.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: This survey was supported by the leaf samples submitted by the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation.

Disease severity was compared in relation to wheat species, soil zone, crop district and cultivar. Mean LS severity was lower than in the previous three years, which was attributed to dry conditions throughout most of the province. The highest mean LS severity for common wheat was in the Black/Gray soil zone, while for durum wheat it was in the Brown soil zone. Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (tan spot) was the predominant LS pathogen.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: A survey for leaf spot (LS) diseases of common and durum wheat in Saskatchewan was conducted between the milk and dough growth stages in 2021. A total of 92 common and durum crops were sampled in 14 crop districts (CD) in the three soil zones (, ). Among the crops sampled, 59 were identified as common wheat and 33 as durum wheat. Information on the agronomic practices employed was obtained from the producers for most fields sampled.\n\nSoil zone map with common and durum wheat fields surveyed across Saskatchewan in 2021.\n\nIn each field, 50 flag leaves were collected at random and air-dried at room temperature. The percentage of leaf area affected by LS (severity) was recorded for each leaf, and a mean percentage leaf area with LS was calculated for each crop and CD. For crops with LS severity of ≥5%, 1 cm2 surface-disinfested leaf pieces were plated on water agar for identification and quantification of the causal LS pathogens.\n\nCultivars were identified in 24 of the common and 31 of the durum wheat samples. The most popular cultivars (grown in at least five fields) were ‘AAC Brandon’ (10) for common wheat, and ‘Transcend’ (13) and ‘AAC Stronghold’ (5) for durum wheat.\n\nFor common wheat, of the 46 samples with a crop rotation history, 28 had been preceded by an oilseed crop, 13 by a cereal, and 5 by a pulse; while the most frequently-grown crop two years previously was a cereal (21), an oilseed (8), or a pulse (3). For durum wheat, of the 35 samples with a crop rotation history, 10 had been preceded by an oilseed crop, 19 by a pulse, 3 by a cereal, and 2 by fallow; while the most frequently-grown crop two years previously was a cereal (24), a pulse (6) or an oilseed (3).\n\nTillage systems were classified as conventional-, minimum-, or zero-till. Of the samples with tillage information, for common wheat, 21 were under zero-till, 14 under minimum-till, and 12 under conventional-till, while for durum wheat, 14 were under zero-till, 7 under minimum-till, and 9 under conventional-till.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Most of the province experienced dry to very dry conditions in the spring of 2021, and summer was drier overall than in the previous few years (). Some of the samples collected were too dry to be properly evaluated for leaf spots. Assessed samples were from 23 fields in the Brown soil, 27 in the Dark Brown soil, and 42 in the Black/Grey soil zone (). LS symptoms were observed in 40 of the 59 common, and 23 of the 33 durum, wheat crops. In individual samples, percentage flag leaf area affected ranged from zero to 5% for common wheat, and zero to 7.5% for durum wheat. Samples with ≥5% of the flag leaf area affected constituted 0% of the common wheat, and 3% of the durum wheat samples. The overall mean percentage of spotting on the flag leaf was 0.8%, which was numerically lower than in the previous three years: 2018 at 1.9%, 2019 at 2.6%, and 2020 at 1.1% (Fernandez et al. Citation2019, Citation2020, Citation2021).\n\nPercent of average precipitation in the Canadian Prairies from early May to late July of 2021. Normal precipitation based on 1981-2010. (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Citation2021).\n\nMean LS severity was somewhat lower for common (0.7%) than durum (1.0%) wheat (). For common wheat, the highest mean LS severity was in the Black/Gray soil zone at 0.9%, with the highest values being observed in Crop Districts 1A (2.1%) and 8A (1.5%). For durum wheat, the Brown soil zone had the highest mean LS severity at 1.2%, with the highest value being observed in Crop Districts 3BS/3BN (3.1%). These LS severities were all lower than in the last few years.\n\nOverall, for the most frequently-grown cultivars, the mean LS for the common wheat ‘AAC Brandon’ was 1.2%, while for durum wheat it was 1.1% for ‘Transcend’ and 0.4% for ‘AAC Stronghold’.\n\nIn all affected samples, leaf spots were caused primarily by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (tan spot), followed, in common wheat, by the septoria leaf spot complex at around 10% of fungal isolations.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada. 2021.

Results of 1950 wheat, 922 durum, 814 barley, and 297 oat samples were reported in 2020. Compared to 2019, the combined frequency of F. graminearum-free samples increased to 66.5% and the mean percent infection rate was down slightly at 1.5%. Total Fusarium spp. frequency and severity decreased slightly compared to those reported in 2019.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: The results of 3983 tests from four commercial seed testing laboratories were acquired and combined. The tests were conducted from September of 2020 through May 2021 and are assumed to be from the 2020 crop. The tests were conducted by agar-plating or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. In the case of PCR tests, the presence or absence of DNA of all Fusarium spp. or of F. graminearum allowed calculation of percent infection. No attempt was made to select fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK) so the samples can be considered random. The percent frequency of all Fusarium spp. including F. graminearum (total Fusarium), and the percent frequency of F. graminearum alone, were calculated. The mean percent infection was calculated for both total Fusarium spp. and F. graminearum. Individual Fusarium spp. other than F. graminearum are not reported, as not all labs provided that information. The results of 1950 wheat, 922 durum, 814 barley, and 297 oat samples are reported by Saskatchewan crop district and provincial means determined.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: The 2020 crop year was characterized by moisture level concerns (Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture Citation2020). Most of the province received minimal or below average rainfall. Hot temperatures and drying winds were common throughout the growing season. This resulted in an early harvest of above average quality. By October 19, 99% of the crop was in the bin compared to the 5-year average of 88% harvested by this date.\n\nCereal yields were above 10-year averages (Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture Citation2020). The average wheat yield was 46 bu/acre compared to the 10-year average of 40 bu/acre. Durum yield was 39 bu/acre compared to the 10-year average of 38 bu/acre. Average barley yield was 67 bu/acre, greater than the 10-year average of 60 bu/acre. Oat yield was 86 bu/acre, up from the 10-year average of 81 bu/acre.\n\nA total of 1950 wheat, 922 durum, 814 barley and 297 oat samples were processed during the period covered by this report. This represented an increase in oat samples (24.3%) and a decrease in durum (10.5%), wheat (17.2%) and barley (9.2%) samples compared to 2019 (Olson et al. Citation2021).\n\nFusarium graminearum frequency and severity (mean % infection) was calculated for wheat, durum, barley, and oat individually and combined. Frequency and severity of total Fusarium spp. was calculated individually and combined as well (, , , and ). The frequency of F. graminearum in 2020 was 33.5%. This was significantly lower than the 40.6% reported in 2019 (Olsen et al. 2021) but above the 2018 level of 22.0% and the 2017 level of 23.1% (Olson et al. Citation2020a, Citationb). The severity of F. graminearum decreased to levels in line with 2018 and 2017 (). Total Fusarium frequency was 84.2%, which was similar to the previous year (). Total Fusarium severity was 4.2%, also similar to levels reported in 2019 ().\n\nThe combined total of Fusarium-free samples dropped slightly from 17.6% in 2019 to 15.8% in 2020 (). Combined mean infection rates remained low at 4.2%. Combined F. graminearum-free samples increased from 59.4% in 2019 to 66.5% in 2020 and the combined mean % infection rate was down slightly from 2019 at 1.5% ().\n\nWheat – The percentage of F. graminearum-free samples in 2020 was 65.0% (), up from the 56.1% reported in 2019 (Olson et al. Citation2021). The mean infection rate was 1.6%, down from the 1.8% reported in 2019. Total Fusarium spp.-free samples were 16.4% compared to 15.0% in 2019. The mean percent infection decreased from 2019 to 4.5%.\n\nDurum – Of the 922 samples, 64.4% were found to be F. graminearum-free. Mean percent infection was 1.8% (). In 2019, the frequency of F. graminearum-free samples was 52.0% and the mean percent infection was 2.2% (Olson et al. Citation2021). The total Fusarium spp.-free frequency was 18.8%, down from the 23.0% reported in 2019 and the mean percent infection was 3.4%, down from 3.8% in 2019.\n\nBarley – The percentage of F. graminearum-free samples was 68.8% in 2020, down from 69.9% in 2019 (Olson et al. Citation2021). Mean infection was 1.0% compared to 1.3% in 2019. Total Fusarium spp.-free samples were 14.1%, down from 19.7% in 2019. The total Fusarium spp. mean infection was 4.1%, up from 3.8% in 2019 ().\n\nOat – Of the 297 samples, 91.2% were found to be F. graminearum-free. This was higher than the 84.5% reported in 2019 (Olson et al. Citation2021). Mean infection was 0.6%, down slightly from 0.8% in 2019. Total Fusarium spp.-free samples were 5.3% down from 13.8% in 2019. The total Fusarium spp. mean infection was 7.5%, up from 6.2% in 2019 ().\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: We would like to acknowledge the cooperation of 20/20 Seed Labs Inc., Lendon Seed Lab, Prairie Diagnostic Seed Lab, and Discovery Seed Labs Ltd. in providing the seed testing results that made this report possible.

BEYENE, M. BANIK & X. WANG\n\nMorden Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 101 Route 100, Morden, MB R6M 1Y5 Telephone: (204) 822-7530; Facsimile: (204) 822-7507; E-mail: mitali.banik@agr.gc.ca\n\nABSTRACT: In 2021, 33 barley fields and 20 oat fields were assessed for leaf spot diseases in Manitoba. The severity of leaf spot diseases in barley and oat was low in 2021, partially due to dry weather conditions during the growing season, which were not very conducive to developing leaf spot pathogens. Cochliobolus sativus (spot blotch) and Pyrenophora teres (net blotch) were the principal pathogens found in barley, whereas Pyrenophora avenae was the predominant leaf spot pathogen isolated from commercial oat fields.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: In 2021, barley and oat leaf spot diseases in Manitoba were assessed by surveying 33 barley fields and 20 oat fields from July 18 to August 5, when most crops were at the early to soft-dough stages of growth (ZGS 79-82, Zadoks et al. Citation1974). Depending on crop availability, fields were sampled at regular intervals, approximately 20-25 km apart along survey routes. The areas sampled were bounded by Highways # 67, 16 to the north, 12 to the east, 3 to the south, 8 to the north and 83 to the west. To identify the causal agent(s) and disease(s), 10 surface-sterilized pieces of infected leaves were incubated on filter paper in moist chambers for 3-5 days to promote sporulation.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS:\n\nBarley – Cochliobolus sativus (causal agent of spot blotch) and Pyrenophora teres (net blotch) were the principal pathogens isolated from infected leaf tissues and caused the most damage in the fields surveyed. C. sativus was isolated from 17 fields (51.5% of fields), and P. teres was found in 10 fields (33.3% of fields) (). The disease level in 2021 was similar to that found in previous years (Banik et al. Citation2016, Citation2017, Citation2019).\n\nOat – Pyrenophora avenae, the causal agent of pyrenophora leaf blotch, was the most prevalent leaf pathogen in oat (). This pathogen was isolated from 60% of fields, similar to the levels reported in the last few years (Banik et al. Citation2016, Citation2017, Citation2019). C. sativus and S. avenae were isolated from 15.0% and 3.5% fields, respectively ().\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBanik M, Beyene M, Wang X. 2016. Barley and oat leaf spot diseases in 2015 in Manitoba.

KAMINSKI2, A. KIRK2, J. DOHERTY1, D. MIRANDA1 & O. GRUENKE1\n\n1Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Morden Research and Development Centre, 101 Route 100, Morden, MB R6M 1Y5 Telephone: (204) 822-7551; Facsimile: (204) 822-7507; E-mail: MariaAntonia.Henriquez@agr.gc.ca 2Manitoba Agriculture, 65-3rd Avenue NE, Carman, MB R0G 0J0\n\nABSTRACT: In 2021, fusarium head blight (FHB) incidence and severity were assessed in 113 spring wheat and 19 winter wheat fields in Manitoba. In spring and winter wheat the disease occurred in 12% and 5.3% of the wheat fields surveyed, respectively, with a provincial mean FHB severity (FHB Index) of 0.005% for spring wheat. The most prevalent Fusarium species in spring wheat were F. graminearum and F. poae.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: Spring wheat and winter wheat in Manitoba were surveyed for fusarium head blight (FHB) at 113 and 19 field locations, respectively. The survey for FHB was conducted from late July to late August for spring wheat, and July for winter wheat when most of the crops were at growth stage ZGS 73 – 85. In contrast to other disease surveys conducted in Manitoba, the fields were not surveyed at random. Instead, information on their location was obtained from producers. The proportion of infected spikes per field (incidence) and the proportion of infected spikelets in each spike (severity) were recorded from five heads (main stems) at 10 sites along a W-pattern in the field, while avoiding sampling tillers. An FHB Index (overall severity) was determined for each field surveyed by [(average % incidence X average % severity)/100].\n\nFifty spikes were processed for pathogen isolation and identification in the laboratory. Kernels from each field surveyed were surface-sterilized in a laminar flow bench and then placed on potato dextrose agar media plates (PDA, 25% strength + streptomycin). Identification of Fusarium species involved microscopic examination and morphological characterization using the criteria of Leslie and Summerell (Citation2006).\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: According to the Manitoba Agricultural Services Corporation’s Variety Market Share Report (MASC 2021), there were approximately 2,470,659 million acres of spring wheat seeded in Manitoba in 2021. The top five cultivars, based on seed acreage, were ‘AAC Brandon’ (51.6%), ‘AAC Starbuck’ (11.0%), ‘AAC Viewfield’ (8.3%), ‘AAC Wheatland’ (5.0%), ‘AAC Redberry’ (5.0%). ‘AAC Brandon’ was the predominant spring wheat cultivar grown in the fields sampled in this survey. FHB disease levels were lower in 2021 (0.005%) than the levels observed in 2020 (0.2%). Provincially, FHB was detected in 13 fields for a prevalence of 12%. The average incidence of the disease across all fields was 0.43%. The average severity (measured as the percentage of spikelets with infection) was 0.06% across all fields. The provincial mean FHB severity (FHB Index) was 0.005%.\n\nAccording to the Manitoba Agricultural Services Corporation’s Variety Market Share Report (MASC 2021), there were approximately 35,390 acres of commercial winter wheat seeded in Manitoba for 2021. The top cultivars, based on their seed acreage, were ‘Emerson’ (34.7%). ‘AAC Gateway’ (32.6%), and ‘AAC Elevate’ (15.5%). FHB disease levels were lower in 2021 than the levels observed in 2020. FHB was detected only one of the 19 fields surveyed for a prevalence of 5.3%. The average incidence of the disease across all fields was 2.0%. The average severity (measured as the percentage of spikelets with infection) was 0.15% across all fields.\n\nThe results from spring wheat kernels plated on 25% PDA + streptomycin media showed that Fusarium graminearum and F. poae were the most frequently isolated pathogen species, accounting for 33.3% of isolations for both species, followed by F. sporotrichioides at 27.8% ( and ). The frequency of Fusarium graminearum was lower in 2021 than in 2020 (66.1%), while F. poae was higher in 2021 than in 2020 (11.6%). Fusarium isolates from winter wheat were not identified to species.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: We gratefully acknowledge the participation of Manitoba Agriculture Farm Production Extension Specialists, as well as Dr. Henriquez’s summer students.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nHenriquez MA, Kaminski D, Doherty J, Miranda D, Gruenke O. 2021.
