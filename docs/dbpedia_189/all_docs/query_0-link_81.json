        "text": "Compositions comprising biological control agents and fungicides\n\nThe present application is a divisional application of an invention patent application having an application date of 29/5/2013, an application number of \"201380040576.4\", an invention name of \"a composition comprising a biocontrol agent and a fungicide selected from a lipid membrane synthesis inhibitor, a melanin biosynthesis inhibitor, a nucleic acid synthesis inhibitor or a signal transduction inhibitor\".\n\nThe present invention relates to a composition comprising synergistically effective amounts of at least one biological control agent selected from specific microorganisms and/or mutants of these strains having all the identifying characteristics of the respective strain, and/or metabolites produced by the respective strain which exhibit activity against insects, acarids, nematodes and/or plant pathogens, and at least one fungicide (I) selected from inhibitors of lipid membrane synthesis, melanin biosynthesis, nucleic acid synthesis, signal transduction and compounds capable of acting as uncouplers. Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of the composition, and to a method for reducing overall damage to plants and plant parts.\n\nSynthetic pesticides or fungicides are generally non-specific and therefore can act on organisms other than the target organism, including other naturally occurring beneficial organisms. Due to their chemical nature, they may also be toxic and non-biodegradable. Consumers worldwide are increasingly aware of potential environmental and health issues (particularly in the food sector) associated with residues of chemicals. This has led to increasing consumer pressure to reduce the use of, or at least reduce the amount of, chemical (i.e., synthetic) pesticides. Thus, there is a need to manage food chain requirements while still being able to effectively control pests.\n\nAnother problem caused by the use of synthetic insecticides or fungicides is: repeated and specific application of insecticides or fungicides often results in the selection of resistant microorganisms. Typically, such strains also develop cross-resistance to other active ingredients with the same mode of action. It is then no longer possible to use the active compounds for effective control of pathogens. However, it is difficult and expensive to develop active ingredients with new mechanisms of action.\n\nThe risk of developing resistance in pathogen populations and concerns about the environment and human health have led to interest in identifying alternatives to synthetic pesticides and fungicides for controlling plant diseases. The use of a Biological Control Agent (BCA) is an alternative. However, most BCAs are not at the same level of efficacy as conventional insecticides and fungicides, especially under severe infection pressure. Thus, the known biological control agents, mutants thereof and metabolites produced therefrom (in particular at low application rates) are not entirely satisfactory.\n\nThere is therefore a continuing need to develop new, alternative plant protection agents which in some areas at least help to meet the above requirements.\n\nExample 13 of WO 98/50422 discloses the synergistic effect of a mixture comprising Bacillus subtilis AQ713(NRRL accession No. B-21661) and azoxystrobin. However, due to the nature of the synergy, it is not possible to predict the effect of other biocontrol agents used in combination with other fungicides based on this particular example.\n\nIn view of this, it is an object of the present invention, in particular, to provide compositions exhibiting activity against insects, mites, nematodes and/or phytopathogens. In addition, it is a further particular object of the present invention to reduce the application rates and broaden the activity spectrum of biological control agents and fungicides, so as to provide compositions which have an increased activity against insects, mites, nematodes and/or phytopathogens, preferably at a reduced total amount of active compounds applied. In particular, it is another object of the present invention to provide a composition which, when applied to crops, results in a reduction of the residual amount in said crops, thereby reducing the risk of resistance formation, but which still provides effective disease control.\n\nIt was thus found that the compositions of the invention as defined below at least partially achieve these objects. The compositions of the present invention preferably meet the above-mentioned needs. It was surprisingly found that the application of the composition according to the invention on the plant, the plant part, the harvested fruit, the vegetables and/or the growth site of the plant in a simultaneous or sequential manner preferably enables a better control of insects, mites, nematodes and/or phytopathogens (synergistic mixtures) than the application of the strain, its mutants and/or the metabolites produced by the strain on the one hand and the application of the individual fungicides on the other hand alone. By applying the biological control agents and specific fungicides of the invention, the activity against insects, mites, nematodes and/or phytopathogens is preferably increased in a superadditive manner. Preferably, application of the composition of the invention induces an increase in the activity of the plant pathogen in a superadditive manner.\n\nThe compositions of the invention therefore preferably allow a reduction in the total amount of active compound to be used and, therefore, crops treated with the compositions preferably exhibit a reduced amount of residues in said crops. Thus, the risk of harmful microorganisms developing resistance is reduced.\n\nThe present invention relates to a composition comprising a synergistically effective amount of at least one biological control agent selected from: bacillus cuticulus (Bacillus subtilis) AQ746(NRRL accession number B-21618), Bacillus mycoides (Bacillus mycoides) AQ726(NRRL accession number B-21664), Bacillus pumilus (Bacillus pumilus) (NRRL accession number B-30087), Bacillus pumilus (Bacillus pumilus) AQ717(NRRL accession number B-21662), Bacillus sp (Bacillus sp.)

The invention also relates to the use of said composition as fungicide and/or insecticide. In addition, the present invention relates to the use of said composition for reducing the overall damage of plants and plant parts and the loss of harvested fruits or vegetables caused by insects, mites, nematodes and/or phytopathogens.\n\nIn addition, the present invention provides methods for reducing overall damage to plants and plant parts and loss of harvested fruits or vegetables caused by insects, mites, nematodes and/or plant pathogens.\n\nBiological control agent\n\nGenerally, \"pesticide-like\" means the ability of a substance to increase the mortality rate or inhibit the growth rate of a plant pest. The term is used herein to describe the property of a substance to exhibit activity against insects, mites, nematodes and/or phytopathogens. In the sense of the present invention, the term \"pests\" includes insects, mites, nematodes and/or phytopathogens.\n\nAs used herein, \"biological control\" is defined as the control of a pathogen and/or an insect and/or a mite and/or a nematode by the use of a second organism. Known biological control mechanisms include intestinal bacteria, which control root rot by competing and winning in the root surface space with fungi. Bacterial toxins (e.g., antibiotics) have been used to control pathogens. The toxin may be isolated and applied directly to the plant, or a bacterial species may be administered so that it produces the toxin in situ.\n\n\"insecticide\" and the term \"insecticidal\" refer to the ability of a substance to increase the mortality rate or inhibit the growth rate of an insect. The term \"insect\" as used herein includes all organisms in the class \"insects\". The term \"pre-adult\" insect refers to any form of organism prior to the adult stage, including, for example, eggs, larvae, and pupae.\n\n\"nematicide\" and \"nematicide\" refer to the ability of a substance to increase the mortality rate or inhibit the growth rate of a nematode. Generally, the term \"nematode\" includes eggs, larvae, juvenile types and adult types of the organism.\n\nBy \"acaricide\" and \"acaricidal\" is meant the ability of a substance to increase the mortality rate or inhibit the growth rate of ectoparasites belonging to the class arachnids, acaridae.\n\nThe term \"metabolite\" refers to any compound, substance, or byproduct of microbial fermentation that has pesticidal activity.\n\nThe term \"mutant\" refers to variants of a parent strain and methods for obtaining mutants or variants that express greater pesticidal activity than the parent strain. The \"parental strain\" is defined herein as the original strain prior to mutagenesis. To obtain such mutants, the parent strain may be treated with chemical agents (e.g., N-methyl-N' -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, ethyl methanesulfonate) or by using gamma radiation, x-rays or UV-radiation or by other methods well known to those skilled in the art.\n\nA \"variant\" is a strain having all the identifying characteristics of a NRRL or ATCC accession number as set forth herein, and which can be identified as having a genome that hybridizes under high stringency conditions to the genome of said NRRL or ATCC accession number.\n\n\"hybridization\" refers to a reaction in which one or more polynucleotides react to form a complex that is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the bases of nucleotide residues. The hydrogen bonds may be formed by Watson-Crick base pairing, Hoogstein binding, or in any other sequence specific manner. The complex may comprise two strands forming a double stranded structure, or more than three strands forming a multi-stranded complex, a single strand that is self-hybridizing, or any combination of the above. Hybridization reactions can be performed under different \"stringency\" conditions. Typically, low stringency hybridization reactions are performed in 10 XSSC or solutions of the same ionic strength/temperature at about 40 â. Moderately stringent hybridization is typically performed in 6 XSSC at about 50 â and highly stringent hybridization reactions are typically performed in1 XSSC at about 60 â.\n\nA variant of the indicated NRRL or ATCC accession number can also be defined as a strain whose genomic sequence has greater than 85%, more preferably greater than 90% or more preferably greater than 95% sequence identity to the genome of the indicated NRRL or ATCC accession number. A polynucleotide or polynucleotide region (or polypeptide region) has a certain percentage (e.g., 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95%) of sequence identity with another sequence, meaning that when aligned, the percentage of bases (or amino acids) are the same when comparing the two sequences. The alignment and the percentage homology or sequence identity can be determined using software programs known in the art (e.g., those described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (f.m. austral et al, eds.,1987) supplement 30, section 7.7.18, table 7.7.1).\n\nNRRL is an abbreviation for american type of agricultural research culture collection, an international authoritative depository for the collection of microbial strains under the budapest convention on the international recognition of microbial collection for patent procedures, and is addressed by 1815, north university street, the american agricultural research service center, national center for agricultural applications, zip code 61604, illinois, inc.\n\nATCC is an acronym for American type culture Collection, an International Authority for the preservation of microbial species under the Budapest convention for the International recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for patent procedures, and is assigned the American university of Manassas, Van.

described above, further comprising at least one auxiliary selected from the group consisting of: fillers, solvents, spontaneous accelerators, carriers, emulsifiers, dispersants, antifrosts, thickeners and adjuvants. Those compositions are referred to as formulations.\n\nIn one aspect of the invention, therefore, the formulations and the application forms prepared therefrom are provided as plant protection agents and/or pesticides, for example as irrigation, drip and spray solutions, which comprise the compositions according to the invention. The application forms may comprise further crop protection agents and/or pesticides, and/or adjuvants which enhance the activity, for example penetrants, examples of which are vegetable oils (such as rapeseed oil, sunflower seed oil), mineral oils (such as liquid paraffin), alkyl esters of vegetable fatty acids (such as rapeseed oil or soybean oil methyl ester), or alkanol alkoxylates, and/or spreading agents such as alkylsiloxanes and/or salts, examples being organic or inorganic ammonium or phosphonium salts (such as ammonium or diammonium sulphate), and/or retention promoters such as dioctyl sulphosuccinate or hydroxypropyl guar polymers, and/or humectants such as glycerol, and/or fertilizers such as ammonium, potassium or phosphate fertilizers.\n\nExamples of typical formulations include water-Soluble Liquids (SL), Emulsifiable Concentrates (EC), aqueous Emulsions (EW), suspension concentrates (SC, SE, FS, OD), water dispersible granules (WG), Granules (GR) and capsule Concentrates (CS); these and other possible types of formulations are described by the International Crop Life (Crop Life International) organization in the following documents: the technical proposal is that the pesticide specification, the development and use manual of the pesticide specification of the food and agriculture organization and the world health organization of the United nations, and the plant production and protection document 173 of the food and agriculture organization of the United nations (made by the United conference on the pesticide manual of the food and agriculture organization/the world health organization of the United nations, 2004, ISBN: 9251048576). The formulations may include active agrochemical compounds other than one or more of the active compounds of the present invention.\n\nThe formulations or application forms preferably comprise auxiliaries, such as fillers, solvents, spontaneous promoters, carriers, emulsifiers, dispersants, antifrosts, biocides, thickeners and/or further auxiliaries, such as adjuvants. In this context, an adjuvant is a component that enhances the biological effect of a formulation, but does not have a biological effect itself. Examples of adjuvants are agents that promote retention, diffusion, attachment to the leaf surface or penetration.\n\nThese formulations are prepared by known methods, for example by mixing the active compounds with auxiliaries (for example fillers, solvents and/or solid carriers and/or further auxiliaries, for example surfactants). The formulations are prepared in suitable equipment or before or during administration.\n\nSuitable as auxiliaries are substances which are suitable for imparting unique properties (for example certain physical, technical and/or biological properties) to the preparations of the active compounds or to the application forms prepared from these preparations (for example, to useful plant protection agents, for example sprays or seed coatings).\n\nSuitable extenders are, for example, water, polar or nonpolar organic chemical liquids, such as aromatic and nonaromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. paraffins, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, chlorobenzenes), alcohols and polyols (which, if appropriate, may also be substituted, etherified and/or esterified), ketones (e.g. acetone, cyclohexanone), esters (including fats and oils) and (poly) ethers, unsubstituted or substituted amines, amides, lactams (e.g. N-alkylpyrrolidones) and lactones, sulfones and sulfoxides (e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide).\n\nIf the filler used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Basically, suitable liquid solvents include: aromatic compounds, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes; chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, vinyl chloride or dichloromethane; aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions; mineral and vegetable oils; alcohols, such as butanol or ethylene glycol and ethers and esters thereof; ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone; strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and dimethylsulfoxide, and water. Preferred co-solvents are selected from acetone and N, N' -dimethylacetamide.\n\nIn principle, all suitable solvents can be used. Suitable solvents are, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes; chlorinated aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, vinyl chloride or dichloromethane; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, paraffin, petroleum fractions, mineral oils and vegetable oils; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol or ethylene glycol and ethers and esters thereof; ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone; and strongly polar solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide and water.\n\nIn principle, all suitable carriers can be used. Suitable carriers are, for example, in particular: ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolin, clay, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and natural or synthetic silicates, resins, waxes and/or solid fertilizers. Mixtures of the above carriers can likewise be used. Suitable carriers for forming the particles include the following: crushed and fractionated natural minerals such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic flours (scales), and granules of organic materials such as sawdust, paper, coconut shells, corn cobs and tobacco stalks.\n\nLiquefied gaseous fillers or solvents may also be used. Particularly suitable are those fillers or carriers which are gaseous at standard temperature and standard pressure, examples being aerosol propellants such as halogenated hydrocarbons, and also butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.\n\nExamples of emulsifiers and/or blowing agents, dispersants or wetting agents of ionic or nonionic nature, or mixtures of these surface-active substances are polyacrylic acids, lignosulphonates, salts of phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acids, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or fatty acids or fatty amines, substituted phenols (preferably alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (preferably alkyltaurines), phosphoric esters of polyoxyethylene alcohols or phenols, fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols, and derivatives of compounds containing salts of sulphuric, sulphonic and phosphoric acid, such as alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulfonates, alkylsulfates, arylsulfonates, protein hydrolysates, lignosulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose. The presence of surface-active substances is advantageous if one of the active compounds and/or one of the inert carriers is insoluble in water and if the application takes place in water. Preferred emulsifiers are alkylaryl polyglycol ethers.\n\nOther adjuvants which may be present in the formulation and in the application forms derived from it include: colorants are, for example, inorganic pigments, examples of which are iron oxide, titanium oxide, Prussian blue, and organic dyes, such as alizarin dyes, azo dyes, metal phthalocyanine dyes, and also nutrients and trace nutrients, such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.\n\nStabilizers (e.g., low temperature stabilizers), preservatives, antioxidants, light stabilizers, or other agents that improve chemical and/or physical stability may also be present. In addition, foaming agents or defoamers may also be present.\n\nIn addition, the formulations and the application forms derived therefrom may also comprise adhesives, for example carboxymethylcellulose; natural or synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate; and natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins; and synthetic phospholipids as further adjuvants. Other possible adjuvants include mineral and vegetable oils.\n\nThere may also be other adjuvants which may be present in the formulation and which derive from the form of application of the formulation. Examples of such additives include perfumes, protective colloids, adhesives, binders, thickeners, thixotropic substances, penetrants, retention promoters, stabilizers, chelating agents, complexing agents, humectants, and spreading agents. In general, the active compounds may be combined with any solid or liquid additive commonly used for the preparation of formulations.\n\nSuitable retention promoters include all those that reduce the dynamic surface tension (such as dioctyl sulfosuccinate), or all those that increase viscoelasticity (such as hydroxypropyl guar polymer).\n\nSuitable osmotic agents herein include all those materials commonly used to enhance the penetration of active agrochemical compounds into plants. An osmotic agent is defined herein as a substance that is capable of passing through the stratum corneum of a plant from a (usually aqueous) application liquid and/or from a spray coating, thus enhancing the migration of the active compound in the stratum corneum. This property can be determined by methods described in the literature (Baur et al, 1997, Pesticide Science 51, 131-. Examples include alcohol alkoxylates such as coconut fatty ethoxylate (10) or isotridecyl ethoxylate (12), fatty acid esters such as rapeseed oil methyl ester or soybean oil methyl ester, fatty amine alkoxylates such as tallow amine ethoxylate (15); or ammonium salts and/or phosphates, such as ammonium sulfate or diammonium hydrogen sulfate.\n\nThe formulations preferably comprise from 0.00000001 to 98% by weight of active compound or, particularly preferably, from 0.01 to 95% by weight of active compound, more preferably from 0.5 to 90% by weight of active compound, based on the weight of the formulation. The content of active compound is defined as the sum of at least one biological control agent and at least one fungicide (I).\n\nThe active compound content of the application forms (crop protection products) prepared from the formulations can be varied within a wide range. The active compound concentration of the application form can generally be from 0.00000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably from 0.00001 to 1% by weight, based on the weight of the application form. Administration is carried out in a conventional manner suitable for the form of administration.\n\nReagent kit\n\nFurther, in one aspect of the invention, there is provided a kit comprising a synergistically effective amount of at least one biocontrol agent selected from the group consisting of bacillus cuticulus AQ746(NRRL accession No. B-21618), bacillus mycoides AQ726(NRRL accession No. B-21664), bacillus pumilus (NRRL accession No. B-30087), bacillus pumilus AQ717(NRRL accession No. B-21662), bacillus AQ175(ATCC accession No. 55608), bacillus AQ177(ATCC accession No. 55609), bacillus AQ178(ATCC accession No. 53522), bacillus subtilis AQ743(NRRL accession No. B-21665), bacillus subtilis AQ713(NRRL accession No. B-21661), bacillus subtilis AQ153(ATCC accession No. 55614), bacillus thuringiensis #32(NRRL accession No. B-21530), and at least one fungicide (I) spatially separated from each other, Bacillus thuringiensis AQ52(NRRL accession No. B-21619), aerothrix albus 620(NRRL accession No. 30547), aerothrix pinicola A3-5(NRRL accession No. 30548), rhodococcus sphaeroides AQ719(NRRL accession No. B-21663), streptomyces fulvus (NRRL accession No. 30232), streptomyces (NRRL accession No. B-30145), bacillus thuringiensis coulter subspecies BMP123, bacillus subtilis AQ30002(NRRL accession No. B-50421), bacillus subtilis AQ30004(NRRL accession No. B-50455), and/or mutants of these strains having all the identifying characteristics of the respective strains, and/or metabolites produced by the respective strains that exhibit activity against nematodes, mites, and/or phytopathogens; the fungicide (I) is selected from the group consisting of lipid membrane synthesis inhibitors, melanin biosynthesis inhibitors, nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors, signal transduction inhibitors and compounds capable of acting as uncouplers.\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention, the above kit further comprises at least one additional fungicide (II), with the proviso that the biological control agent, fungicide (I) and fungicide (II) are not the same. Fungicide (II) can be present in the biocontrol agent component of the kit, or can be present in the fungicide (I) component of the kit, spatially separated, or can be present in both components. Preferably, fungicide (II) is present in fungicide (I) component.\n\nFurthermore, the kit of the invention may also comprise at least one auxiliary agent chosen from the group comprising: fillers, solvents, spontaneous accelerators, carriers, emulsifiers, dispersants, antifrosts, thickeners and adjuvants. The at least one auxiliary agent may be present in the biocontrol agent component of the kit, or may be present in the fungicide (I) component of the kit, spatially separated, or in both components.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, the composition as described above is used to reduce overall damage to plants and plant parts and loss of harvested fruits or vegetables caused by insects, mites, nematodes and/or plant pathogens.\n\nFurthermore, in another aspect of the present invention, the composition as described above improves the overall health of the plant.\n\nThe term \"plant health\" generally includes various improvements in plants not associated with pest control. For example, advantageous properties that may be mentioned are improved crop characteristics including: emergence, crop yield, protein content, oil content, starch content, more developed root systems, improved root growth, improved root size maintenance, improved root efficiency, improved stress tolerance (e.g., drought, heat, salt, UV, water, cold), ethylene reduction (yield reduction and/or acceptance inhibition), tillering increase, plant height increase, larger leaf blade, base dead leaf reduction, stronger tillers, greener leaf color, pigment content, photosynthetic activity, reduction in required inputs (e.g., fertilizer or water), reduction in required seeds, higher yielding tillers, early flowering, early grain maturity, reduction in plant lodging, accelerated bud growth, plant vigor, increased plant populations, earlier and better germination.\n\nFor the use according to the invention, improved plant health preferably means improved plant characteristics including: crop yield, more developed root system (improved root growth), improved root size maintenance, improved root efficiency, increased tillering, increased plant height, larger leaf blade, reduced dead leaf at the base, stronger tillers, greener leaf color, photosynthetic activity, higher yield tillers, more vigor of the plant and increased plant population.\n\nFor the purposes of the present invention, improved plant health particularly preferably means improved plant characteristics selected from the group consisting of: crop yield, more developed root system, improved root growth, improved root size maintenance, improved root efficiency, increased tillering and increased plant height.\n\nThe effect of the compositions of the present invention on plant health (as defined herein) can be determined by comparing plants grown under the same environmental conditions, wherein one part of the plants is treated with the composition of the present invention and another part of the plants is not treated with the composition of the present invention. In contrast, the other portion is not treated at all, or with a placebo (i.e., no composition of the invention is applied, e.g., no active ingredient is applied (i.e., no biological control agent as described herein and no fungicide as described herein), or no biological control agent as described herein, or no fungicide as described herein).\n\nThe compositions of the present invention may be applied in any desired manner, for example in the form of seed coatings, soil drenches, and/or direct application in furrow, and/or foliar sprays, and may be applied pre-, post-or simultaneously. In other words, the composition may be applied to seeds, plants or harvested fruits and vegetables, or to the soil (the growing locus of the plant) in which the plant is growing or in which it is desired to grow.\n\nReducing overall damage to plants and plant parts often results in healthier plants and/or increased plant vigor and yield.\n\nPreferably, the composition of the invention is used for treating conventional plants or transgenic plants or seeds thereof.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for reducing overall damage to plants and plant parts and loss of harvested fruit or vegetables by insects, mites, nematodes and/or phytopathogens comprising simultaneously or sequentially applying a synergistically effective amount of at least one selective biological control agent selected from the group consisting of bacillus keratospongius AQ746(NRRL accession No. B-21618), bacillus mycoides AQ726(NRRL accession No. B-21664), bacillus pumilus (NRRL accession No. B-30087), bacillus pumilus AQ717(NRRL accession No. B-21662), bacillus AQ175(ATCC accession No. 55608), bacillus AQ177(ATCC accession No. 55609), bacillus AQ178(ATCC accession No. 53522), bacillus subtilis AQ accession No. B-21665, and at least one fungicide (I), and a synergistic effective amount of at least one fungicide (I), Bacillus subtilis AQ713(NRRL accession No. B-21661), Bacillus subtilis AQ153(ATCC accession No. 55614), Bacillus thuringiensis BD #32(NRRL accession No. B-21530), Bacillus thuringiensis AQ52(NRRL accession No. B-21619), Aeromonas albus 620(NRRL accession No. 30547), Aeromonas pini A3-5(NRRL accession No. 30548), Rhodococcus sphaeroides AQ719(NRRL accession No. B-21663), Streptomyces galbana (NRRL accession No. 30232), Streptomyces (NRRL accession No. B-30145), Bacillus thuringiensis Kurstaki strain BMP123, Bacillus subtilis AQ30002(NRRL accession No. B-50421), Bacillus subtilis AQ30004(NRRL accession No. B-50455), and/or mutants of these strains having all the identifying characteristics of the respective strains and/or exhibiting insect resistance produced by the respective strains, Active metabolites of acarids, nematodes and/or plant pathogens, said fungicide (I) being selected from the group consisting of lipid membrane synthesis inhibitors, melanin biosynthesis inhibitors, nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors, signal transduction inhibitors and compounds capable of acting as uncouplers.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment of the present method, the at least one fungicide (I) is selected from the fungicides described above.\n\nIn another preferred embodiment of the present method, the composition further comprises at least one additional fungicide (II), with the proviso that the biological control agent, fungicide (I) and fungicide (II) are not the same.\n\nPreferably, the at least one additional fungicide (II) is a synthetic fungicide. More preferably, fungicide (II) is selected from the preferred fungicides (II) described above.\n\nThe methods of the present invention include methods of application in which both the aforementioned at least one biological control agent and at least one pesticide (I) can be formulated into a single, stable composition having an agriculturally acceptable shelf life (so-called \"single formulation\"), or combined prior to or at the time of use (referred to as a \"combined formulation\").\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the expression \"combination\" represents a plurality of combinations of said at least one biological control agent and said at least one fungicide (I), and optionally said at least one fungicide (II), in the following forms: the combined use of the individual active ingredients in a single formulation, in a single \"ready-to-mix\" form, in the form of a combined spray mixture (e.g. \"tank mix\") consisting of a single formulation, and in particular in sequential (i.e. one after the other within a reasonably short period of time, e.g. hours or days, such as 2 hours to 7 days). The order of application of the compositions of the invention is not critical to the practice of the invention. Thus, the term \"combination\" also comprises the at least one biological control agent and the at least one fungicide (I), and optionally the at least one fungicide (II), being present on or in the plant to be treated or its surroundings, growth environment or storage space, for example after the application of the at least one biological control agent and the at least one fungicide (I), and optionally the at least one fungicide (II), simultaneously or sequentially to the plant surroundings, growth environment or storage space.\n\nIf the at least one biological control agent and the at least one fungicide (I), and optionally the at least one fungicide (II), are applied or used sequentially, the plant or plant parts (including seeds and plants germinating from seeds), harvested fruits and vegetables are preferably treated according to the following method:firstly, the methodApplying the at least one fungicide (I) and optionally the at least one fungicide (II) to the plant or to the locus of the plant;second, it is used forApplying the biocontrol agent to the same plant or plant part. The time period between the first application and the second application in the (crop) growth cycle may vary and depends on the effect to be achieved. For example, a first application is carried out to prevent infection of the plant or plant part by insects, mites, nematodes and/or phytopathogens (especially in the case of treatment of seeds), or to combat infection by insects, mites, nematodes and/or phytopathogens (especially in the case of treatment of plants and plant parts) and a second application is carried out to prevent or control infection by insects, mites, nematodes and/or phytopathogens. Control in the present context means that the biological control agent is not capable of completely destroying the pests or phytopathogenic fungi, but is capable of keeping the infection at an acceptable level.\n\nFollowing the above steps, very low levels of residue of the at least one fungicide (I) and optionally the at least one fungicide (II) on the treated plants, plant parts and harvested fruits and vegetables can be achieved.\n\nUnless otherwise mentioned, plants, parts of plants (including seeds and plants germinating from seeds), harvested fruits and vegetables are treated with the compositions according to the invention by acting on their surroundings, growing environment or storage space, either directly or using conventional treatment methods (e.g. dipping, spraying, atomizing, irrigating, evaporating, dusting, fogging, scattering, foaming, coating, dispersing, watering (irrigating), drip irrigation), using the compositions according to the invention. It is also possible to apply the at least one biological control agent, the at least one fungicide (I) and optionally the at least one fungicide (II) as a single formulation or a combined formulation by the ultra-low volume method, or to inject the composition of the invention as a composition or as a single formulation into the soil (in-furrow).\n\nThe term \"plant to be treated\" includes every part of a plant comprising its root system and material (e.g. soil or nutrient substrate) within a radius of at least 10cm, 20cm, 30cm near or at least 10cm, 20cm, 30cm near the root system of the plant to be treated, respectively.\n\nThe amount of the biocontrol agent used or applied in combination with at least one fungicide (II), optionally in the presence of at least one fungicide (II), depends on the final formulation and on the size or type of the plant, plant part, seed, harvested fruit and vegetable to be treated. Typically, the biological control agent applied or used according to the invention is present in about 2% to about 80% (w/w), preferably about 5% to about 75% (w/w), more preferably about 10% to about 70% (w/w) of its single formulation or combined formulation with the at least one fungicide (I) and optionally the fungicide (II).\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the biocontrol agent or example is applied to a plant or plant part (e.g., seed, fruit, or vegetable)E.g. having a spore concentration of at least 10 in a single formulation or a combined formulation5Colony forming units per gram of preparation (e.g., cells per gram of preparation, spores per gram of preparation), e.g., 105-1012cfu/g, preferably 106-1011cfu/g, more preferably 107-1010cfu/g, most preferably 109-1010cfu/g. Furthermore, when discussing the ratio between the amount of the preparation of the at least one biocontrol agent and the amount of the fungicide (I), reference to the concentration of the biocontrol agent in the form of spores or cells is also made with reference to the point in time at which the biocontrol agent is applied to the plant or plant part (e.g., seed, fruit or vegetable).\n\nLikewise, the amount of the at least one fungicide (I) used or applied in combination with the biocontrol agent, optionally in the presence of one fungicide (II), depends on the final formulation, as well as the size or type of the plant, plant part, seed, harvested fruit and vegetable to be treated. Typically, the fungicide (I) applied or used according to the invention is present in about 0.1% to about 80% (weight/weight), preferably about 1% to about 60% (weight/weight), more preferably about 10% to about 50% (weight/weight) of its single formulation or of its combined formulation with the biological control agent and optionally the at least one fungicide (II).\n\nThe at least one biological control agent and the at least one fungicide (I), and, if present, the fungicide (II), are used or applied in a synergistic weight ratio. The skilled person is able to find the synergistic weight ratio for use in the present invention by conventional methods. The skilled person understands that these ratios refer to the ratio in the combined formulation and the calculated ratio of at least one biological control agent as described herein and said fungicide (I) when both components are applied as a single agent to the plants to be treated. Since the volume and the content of the biological control agent and fungicide (I) respectively in a single formulation are known to the skilled person, the skilled person can obtain this ratio by simple mathematical calculations.\n\nThe ratio can be calculated based on the following two values: the amount of at least one fungicide (I) at the point in time of application of the components of the inventive combination to a plant or plant part and the amount of a biocontrol agent at or shortly before the point in time of application of the components of the inventive combination to a plant or plant part (e.g. 48h, 24h, 12h, 6h, 2h, 1 h).\n\nThe at least one biocontrol agent and the at least one fungicide (I) can be applied to the plant or to the locus of the plant simultaneously or at different times, provided that both components are present on or in the plant after application. In the case where the biological control agent and fungicide (I) are applied at different times and fungicide (I) is applied significantly before the biological control agent, the concentration of fungicide (I) on or within the plant can be determined by one skilled in the art by chemical analysis methods known in the art at or shortly before the point in time at which the biological control agent is applied. Vice versa, when the biocontrol agent is first applied to a plant, the concentration of the biocontrol agent can be determined at or shortly before the point in time at which fungicide (I) is applied, using tests also known in the art.\n\nIn particular, in one embodiment, the synergistic weight ratio of the at least one biological control agent/spore formulation and the at least one fungicide (I) is in the range of from 1: 500 to 1000: 1, preferably in the range of from 1: 500 to 500: 1, more preferably in the range of from 1: 500 to 300: 1. It should be noted that these ratio ranges mean that the biological control agent/spore formulation (to be combined with the at least one fungicide (I) or the formulation of the at least one fungicide (I)) is about 1010Cells or spores per gram of the preparation of cells or spores. For example, a ratio of 100: 1 refers to 100 parts by weight having a cell/spore concentration of 1010Biological control agent/spore preparation of cells or spores/gram of preparation is combined with 1 part by weight of fungicide (I) (either as a single preparation, combined preparation, or separately applied to the plant to form a combination on the plant).\n\nIn another embodiment, the synergistic weight ratio of the at least one biological control agent/spore formulation and the fungicide (I) is in the range of from 1: 100 to 20.000: 1, preferably in the range of from 1: 50 to 10.000: 1, or even 1: 150 to 1000: 1. Likewise, the above ratio ranges refer to a concentration of biocontrol agent/spore formulation of biocontrol agent of about 1010A formulation of cells or spores per gram of the biocontrol agent. In particular, in this embodiment, the biocontrol agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of aerothrix albus 620(NRRL accession No. 30547) and aerothrix pinicola a3-5(NRRL accession No. 30548).\n\nIn another embodiment, the synergistic weight ratio of the at least one biological control agent/spore formulation and the fungicide (I) is in the range of from 1: 0.001 to 1: 5, preferably in the range of from 1: 0.01 to 1: 1, or even in the range of from 1: 0.1 to 1: 0.9. The ratio ranges described herein refer to the amount of BCA and fungicide in ppm, wherein the amount of biocontrol agent refers to the dried content of BCA solution. In particular, in this embodiment"
