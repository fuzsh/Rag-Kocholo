        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Background and Terms of Reference as provided by European Commission\n\n1.1.1 Background\n\nThe introduction of plants for planting of Solanaceae other than seeds into the European Union (EU) is prohibited from certain origins, including the countries that have requested this derogation, as they are listed in point 18 of Annex VI to Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. In August 2021, Germany sent a request for derogation to import unrooted cuttings of the genera Petunia and Calibrachoa produced under physical isolation in Costa Rica, Kenya, and Uganda, accompanied by an application describing the production methods and the pests associated with the plants in the different third countries. A similar request has also been received from Guatemala, accompanied by a technical dossier.\n\nIn support of the request, the dossier prepared by Germany and by Guatemala, with the identified pests and the details of the growing conditions is submitted with this request.\n\n1.1.2 Terms of Reference\n\nEuropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is requested, pursuant to Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, to provide scientific opinion(s) on the field of plant health.\n\nIn particular, EFSA is requested to assess the probability of entry of pests (likelihood of pest freedom at entry), including both, regulated (Union quarantine pests, the protected zone quarantine pests, and the Union regulated non-quarantine pests (RNQPs)) and non-regulated pests, associated with unrooted cuttings of the genera Petunia and Calibrachoa produced under physical isolation in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nThe assessment shall include all pests present in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Kenya, and Uganda that could be associated with the unrooted cuttings of the genera Petunia and Calibrachoa produced under physical isolation and could have an impact if they are introduced into the EU.\n\nIn this assessment, EFSA shall take into account the available scientific information, and in particular the scientific and technical information provided in the dossiers by Germany and Guatemala. If necessary to complete its assessment, EFSA may ask additional scientific and technical information or clarifications (e.g., regarding pests status, pests control, production sites and systems, processing and shipping) on unrooted cuttings of the genera Petunia and Calibrachoa produced under physical isolation in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Kenya and Uganda. Such information can be requested by EFSA to the National Plant Protection Organisations (NPPO's) of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Kenya, Uganda, or Germany as appropriate. Following the provision of such information, EFSA shall proceed with the assessment.\n\n1.2 Interpretation of the Terms of Reference\n\nThis opinion refers only to the Kenya dossier. The EFSA Panel on Plant Health (hereafter referred to as ‘the Panel’) conducted a commodity risk assessment of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. unrooted cuttings from Kenya following the Guidance on commodity risk assessment for the evaluation of high-risk plant dossiers (EFSA PLH Panel, 2019), taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by Kenya.\n\nFollowing an exchange with EC, the Panel was requested to broaden the scope of the assessment to Solanaceae host plants and to include RNQP species if they are relevant.\n\nThe EU quarantine pests that are regulated as a group in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 were considered and evaluated separately at species level.\n\nIn its evaluation the Panel:\n\nChecked whether the information in the technical dossier (hereafter referred to as ‘the Dossier’) provided by the applicant (Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (NPPO of Kenya)) was sufficient to conduct a commodity risk assessment. When necessary, additional information was requested from the applicant.\n\nConsidered the host status of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. as identical because they are very closely related genera.\n\nSelected the relevant Union quarantine pests (as specified in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072,1 hereafter referred to as ‘EU quarantine pests’), and the RNQPs regulated for Petunia spp., Calibrachoa spp. or for solanaceous crops and potentially associated with unrooted cuttings of the commodity species (Petunia and/or Calibrachoa), or to major solanaceous crops (tomato, pepper, potato and cultivated tobacco).\n\nIncluded in the assessment, pests with host plant records for Petunia spp. and/or Calibrachoa spp., as well as polyphagous pests with major solanaceous crops (tomato, pepper, potato and cultivated tobacco) and that were considered based, on expert judgement, likely to use Petunia spp. and/or Calibrachoa spp. as a host plant.\n\nAssessed the effectiveness of the measures described in the dossier for the selected relevant pests.\n\nThe risk assessment and its conclusions are based on the information provided in the submitted technical dossier (specific place and procedure of production) and refer to the production sites described in the same document.\n\nRisk management decisions are not within EFSA's remit. Therefore, the Panel provided a rating based on expert judgement regarding the likelihood of pest freedom for each relevant pest given the risk mitigation measures proposed by the NPPO of Kenya.\n\n2 DATA AND METHODOLOGIES\n\n2.1 Data provided by the NPPO of Kenya\n\nThe Panel considered all the data and information provided by the NPPO of Kenya in response to EFSA's request, which was received on 28 December 2022. Further additional information was submitted by the NPPO of Kenya in response to EFSA's request on 27 November 2023. The Dossier is managed by EFSA.\n\nThe structure and overview of the Dossier are shown in Table 1. The number of the relevant section is indicated in the opinion when referring to a specific part of the Dossier.\n\nDossier section Overview of contents Filename 1.0 Technical dossier on Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. Calibrachoa and Petunia technical, information for EFSA DEC 2022.pdf 2.0 Answers to request of additional information on Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. Calibrachoa technical information for EFSA 26 Nov 2023.pdf 3.0 Table with status of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. pests in Kenya Annex 2 – pest status specific requests to KenyaX.xlsx 4.0 Map of the nursery in Kenya intending to export Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. to the EU Company map Selecta Kenya Q1 2024.pdf\n\n2.2 Literature searches performed by the NPPO of Kenya\n\nThe data and supporting information provided by the NPPO of Kenya formed the basis of the commodity risk assessment.

Two searches were combined: (i) a general search to identify pests of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. in different databases, and (ii) a tailored search to identify whether these pests are present or not in Kenya and the EU. The searches were run between 30 May 2022 and 11 June 2022. No language, date or document type restrictions were applied in the search strategy. The Panel used the databases indicated in Table 3 to compile the list of pests associated with the genera Petunia and Calibrachoa. As for Web of Science, the literature search was performed using a specific, ad hoc, established search string (see Appendix B). The string was run in ‘All Databases’ with no range limits for time or language filters. This is further explained in Section 2.4.2 pest list from Benaki Phytopathological Institute (Athens, Greece).\n\nAdditional searches, limited to retrieve documents, were run when developing the opinion. The available scientific information, including previous EFSA opinions on the relevant pests and diseases (see pest data sheets in Appendix A) and the relevant literature and legislation (e.g. Regulation (EU) 2016/2031; Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) 2018/2019; (EU) 2018/2018 and (EU) 2019/2072) were taken into account.\n\n2.4 Methodology\n\nWhen developing the opinion, the Panel followed the EFSA Guidance on commodity risk assessment for the evaluation of high-risk plant dossiers (EFSA PLH Panel, 2019).\n\nIn the first step, pests potentially associated with the commodity in the country of origin (EU-regulated pests and other pests) that may require risk mitigation measures were identified. The EU non-regulated pests not known to occur in the EU were selected based on evidence of their potential impact in the EU. After the first step, all the relevant pests that may need risk mitigation measures were identified.\n\nIn the second step, the proposed risk mitigation measures for each relevant pest were evaluated in terms of efficacy or compliance with EU requirements, as explained in Section 1.2.\n\nA conclusion on the likelihood of the commodity being free from each of the relevant pest was determined, and uncertainties were identified using expert judgements.\n\nPest freedom was assessed by estimating the number of bags containing infested/infected unrooted cuttings out of 10,000 exported bags. Each bag contains 105 unrooted cuttings.\n\nThe information provided in some sections of the Opinion is the result of the Panel interpretation of the text of the applicant, Dossier.\n\n2.4.1 Commodity data\n\nBased on the information provided by the NPPO of Kenya, the characteristics of the commodity are summarised in Section 3.\n\n2.4.2 Identification of pests potentially associated with the commodity\n\nTo evaluate the pest risk associated with the importation of the commodity from Kenya, a pest list was compiled. The pest list is a compilation of all identified pests reported to be associated with all species of the genera Petunia and Calibrachoa, and the polyphagous pests associated with major Solanaceae plants reported to be present in Kenya based on information provided in the Dossier Sections 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and on searches performed by the Panel. All viruses and viroids infecting major solanaceous crops (tomato, pepper, potato and cultivated tobacco) retrieved from CABI and European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) databases (CABI, online; EPPO, online) and recent review articles on the subject were included.\n\nThe search strategy and search syntax were adapted to each of the databases listed in Table 3, according to the options and functionalities of the different databases and CABI keyword thesaurus.\n\nPlants of Petunia spp. are widely used in Plant Virology as experimental hosts. Therefore, many, if not most, available data concerning host status for plant viruses refer to laboratory tests in which Petunia spp. are reported either as a local host, where the virus is restricted to the inoculated leaf via cell-to-cell movement, or as a systemic host, where the virus spreads from the inoculated leaf to other parts of the plant via systemic/phloem movement. In this assessment, viruses recorded to infect Petunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. naturally were included for further evaluation. Viruses that are reported to infect Petunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. experimentally were included for further evaluation if (i) they infect Petunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. systemically or (ii) they infect Petunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. locally, and their biology (e.g. highly contagious viruses) or transmission mode/epidemiology (e.g. spread via mechanical spread in the field) would allow Petunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. to act as a virus source for further spread in the field.\n\nThe notifications of interceptions of EU member states were consulted for the Years 2009–2023 (EUROPHYT, online, from 2009 to 2020 and TRACES-NT, online, from May 2020 to March 2023, Accessed: January 12 2024). To check whether Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. can act as a pathway, all notifications (all origins) for Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. were evaluated. It should be noted that the import of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. from Kenya is prohibited. For each selected pest, it was also checked if there were notification records for Kenya (all commodities).\n\nThe evaluation of the compiled pest list was done in two steps: first, the relevance of the EU-regulated pests was evaluated (Section 4.1); second, the relevance of any other pest was evaluated (Section 4.2).\n\nPests for which limited information was available on one or more criteria used to identify them as relevant for this Opinion, for example on potential impact, are listed in Appendix C (list of pests that can potentially cause an effect, not further assessed).\n\nThe methodology used to establish pest presence depends in part on published literature. The limited number of publications from Kenya can lead to an underestimation of the number of pests present, particularly for viruses. A limited number of pest-specific surveys may increase the uncertainty of the pest status.\n\n2.4.3 Listing and evaluation of risk mitigation measures\n\nThe proposed risk mitigation measures were listed and evaluated. When evaluating the likelihood of pest freedom at origin, the following types of potential infection/infestation sources for Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. in nurseries and relevant risk mitigation measures were considered (Figure 1):\n\npest entry from surrounding areas,\n\npest entry with new plants/seeds,\n\npest spread within the nursery.\n\nInformation on the biology, estimates of the likelihood of entry of the pest into the nursery and spread within the nursery, and the effect of the measures on a specific pest are summarised in pest data sheets compiled for each pest selected for further evaluation (see Appendix A).\n\n2.4.4 Expert Knowledge Elicitation\n\nTo estimate the pest freedom of the commodities, an Expert Knowledge Elicitation (EKE) was performed following EFSA guidance (Annex B.8 of EFSA Scientific Committee, 2018).\n\nThe specific question for EKE was defined as follows: ‘Taking into account (i) the risk mitigation measures listed in the Dossier, and (ii) other relevant information (reported in the specific pest datasheets), how many of 10,000 bags of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. unrooted cuttings will be infested/infected with the relevant pest/pathogen when arriving in the EU?’\n\nThe risk assessment considers bags containing unrooted cuttings as the most suitable unit. Each bag contains 105 unrooted cuttings. The following reasoning is given:\n\nThere is no quantitative information available regarding the clustering of plants during production.\n\nFor the pests under consideration, a cross-infestation between bags during transport is not likely.\n\nBefore the elicitation, the pests were grouped if they had similar characteristics, such as: closely taxonomically related; biology/life history; behavioural ecology; effect of management measures (e.g. mesh size); plant/pathogen/vector (if applicable) interactions.\n\nFor the assessment of some pests/cluster of pests, the results of the previous commodity risk assessment of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. unrooted cuttings were also used (EFSA PLH Panel, 2024). In the case of similar pest species associated with the commodity in the different countries, a comparison was made of the: (1) production conditions, including applied risk mitigation measures; (2) climatic and environmental conditions; (3) pest status. When no major differences were identified, the results of the previous risk assessment were taken. When differences were identified, the EKE was based on the previous elicited values considering the necessary adaptations.\n\nThe uncertainties associated with the EKE were taken into account and quantified in the probability distribution applying the semi-formal method described in section 3.5.2 of the EFSA Panel on Plant Health Guidance on quantitative pest risk assessment (EFSA PLH Panel, 2018). Finally, the results were reported in terms of the likelihood of pest freedom. The lower 5% percentile of the uncertainty distribution reflects the opinion that pest freedom is, with 95% certainty, above this limit.\n\n3 COMMODITY DATA\n\n3.1 Description of the commodity\n\nThe commodities to be imported are unrooted cuttings (stem with leaves) of Petunia spp. (common name: petunia, garden petunia; family: Solanaceae) and/or Calibrachoa spp. (common name: calibrachoa, mini petunia; family: Solanaceae). These unrooted cuttings measure about 2–4 cm in length and possess 2–4 pairs of leaves (Figure 2). The cuttings are harvested from mother plants that are at least 7 weeks old (i.e. 7 weeks after cuttings to establish mother plants had been planted). The harvesting process spans until the plants reach 40 weeks of age, resulting in a total harvesting period of 33 weeks (Dossier sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\nAccording to International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures 36, ‘Integrated measures for plants for planting’ (FAO, 2019), the commodity can be classified as ‘unrooted cuttings’.\n\n3.2 Description of the production area\n\nThere are seven production sites spread across six counties in Kenya interested in exporting the unrooted cuttings of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. to the EU (Figure 3).\n\n3.3 Production and handling processes\n\n3.3.1 Source of planting material\n\nElite planting material (Naktuinbouw certified) in the form of tissue culture plantlets or unrooted cuttings is imported from facilities in Germany (2000 plantlets/cuttings per year), Portugal (1500 plantlets/cuttings per year), Spain (3500 plantlets/cuttings per year) and Israel (Danziger) (2000 tissue culture plantlets per year) (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nThere are four distinct types of planting material: candidate plant, nuclear stock, foundation stock and mother stock. The candidate plants are the breeder's material, usually few in number. The unrooted cuttings from these candidate plants are raised as nuclear stock by the breeders. This nuclear stock is maintained by the breeders in three EU countries and Israel. The unrooted cuttings or tissue culture plantlets derived from the nuclear stock are exported to Kenya, and these unrooted cuttings or tissue culture plantlets, when raised in Kenya, are classified as the foundation stock. Cuttings from the foundation stock are propagated as mother plants in Kenya. The unrooted cuttings that are exported from Kenya to the EU are obtained from the mother plants (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\nAs stated earlier, the unrooted cuttings or the tissue culture plantlets derived from the nuclear stock are exported to Kenya from the above three EU countries and Israel. Upon arrival in Kenya, they are held at the post entry quarantine facilities for 4 weeks. The NPPO samples and tests 10% of the planting material before lifting of the quarantine status imposed on the imports. NPPO tests the planting materials for tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV), alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), beet curly top virus (BCTV), tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), Arabis mosaic virus (ARMV), chilli pepper mild mottle virus (CPMMoV), turnip vein-clearing virus (TVCV), tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), potato virus Y (PVY), lettuce mosaic virus (LMV), potato virus A (PVA) and Calibrachoa mottle virus (CbMV). The planting material is approved for propagation by NPPO only if the test is negative for all the above-mentioned viruses and viroids. Thereafter, 3-week inspection interval is adopted by NPPO for plants in the propagation facility. Official testing is done using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\nFurthermore, the candidate plants, nuclear stock, foundation stock and mother plants after 3–4 weeks of planting are subjected to 100% sampling and testing for the above-mentioned viruses and viroids, such that individual plants are tested (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\n3.3.2 Production cycle and conditions\n\nPlants of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. are grown in certified production sites for plants for planting. From the three EU countries and Israel, unrooted cuttings from the nuclear stock are exported to Kenya, and these unrooted cuttings are raised as foundation stock (also called as increase blocks) in Kenya. The cuttings from this foundation stock are raised as mother stock (also called as production blocks/houses). The foundation stock and the mother stock producing greenhouses are separated from each other. Furthermore, cuttings from several other ornamentals are produced within the same production sites. These include perennials, bedding plants and succulents, which are for exporting mainly to the EU, but not for local markets. However, specific greenhouses are designated for the production of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. There is no mixing of solanaceous plants with other ornamental plants in the same greenhouse. All propagation materials for the cuttings are imported from EU member countries and Israel. No other crops are produced in these production sites, other than cuttings destined for export markets. Moreover, there are no other solanaceous crop production areas within the vicinity of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. production sites (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\nThe greenhouses are covered on top by polythene, and the sidewalls are fitted with thrips-proof netting. Plants are grown on the raised benches with height ranging from 0.6 m to 1.5 m above the ground. The floor of the greenhouses is covered by mypex (ground fabric cover), concrete or volcanic rock. The growing media used are sterilised volcanic pumice. For sterilisation, the growing media undergo steaming at 80 or 90°C for 1–2 h after all 10 sensors reach 80°C. Nurseries steam at different temperatures, with 80°C for a duration of 1 h being the minimum. New growing media are used every season, and the plants are planted in new polythene bags or sterilised pots every season. Light intensity inside the greenhouse is 5–10 M/J per day, with a temperature of 22–28°C during the day, and humidity ranging from 50% to 80% (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\nThere is only one production season per year. The main stages of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. production are:\n\nSticking of unrooted cuttings for build-up: Weeks 20–35.\n\nTransplanting: Weeks 26–40.\n\nHarvesting: Weeks 35–20 of the following year.\n\nPest monitoring during production: Plants are produced in insect proof greenhouses. All vents are closed by an insect proof net. Any torn areas on the insect net are repaired. There is a double door and an automated fan at the entrance to the greenhouse (Figure 4). Daily scouting is conducted by the nursery staff, and pest incidences are recorded. The traps (sticky, pheromone and light) assist the nurseries to enable pest monitoring and scouting, and they are replaced as needed. Yellow sticky traps are employed (1 trap for every 10 m2) to trap thrips and whiteflies. Pheromone traps are placed (1 trap for every 200 m2) to trap moths (commonly Duponchelia spp.). There is also a black light trap (at least one per greenhouse) to enhance monitoring of all types of moths (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\nDuring the active growth, routine testing of the mother plants is done throughout the production period at intervals, either weekly or biweekly depending on the growers. Also, the sampling intensity varies among the growers, but it is usually between 10% and 25%. Testing is done in EU-accredited laboratories such as Naktuinbouw, Elsner Pac, Biotek, among others. All test results are available to NPPO upon request. NPPO also conducts their own sampling and testing. There is also in-house testing by nurseries using ELISA and quick tests where applicable. In the nurseries, all plants are tested (100% sampling) for the above-mentioned viruses and viroids 3–4 weeks after planting. Further screening (10% sampling) is done at the age of 4–6 weeks, and then harvesting starts at 7–12 weeks and continues weekly for about 22–28 weeks. Any symptomatic samples observed during routine inspection are sampled and tested for an appropriate pathogen. In case any sample is tested positive for any of the pathogens, the place is quarantined and suspected plants are tagged, and then the NPPO is notified to collect samples for official confirmatory tests and pest reporting. If the samples are confirmed to be positive, infected plants, including the planting medium, are discarded by incineration or burying, and this is witnessed and documented by the NPPO, and a destruction report is issued. But if insect vectors like Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) or Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) are identified in a greenhouse, appropriate pesticides will be applied. Furthermore, exports from the greenhouse will be temporarily suspended, and 10% of the plants will be sampled for testing of begomoviruses or tospoviruses respectively. If tests are negative, exports of the plants will be recommended. Testing is done using molecular assays, conventional or real-time PCR. For both tospoviruses and begomoviruses, genus-specific assays are conducted, and for potyviruses, species-specific serological assays and molecular techniques are used. However, tests for tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), tomato leaf curl virus, TSWV and INSV are also conducted. So far, no samples have been tested positive during the routine testing for begomoviruses and tospoviruses. Growers use biological control agents such as the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and, Amblyseius spp. (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae), the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana, and chemical pesticides such as Spinosad, Flonicamid, Pyrethrins and Abamectin for managing whiteflies, thrips and aphids. In addition, benevia (cyantraniliprole) and neem oil are used to manage F. occidentalis. The plants are also tested at the end of the growing season before discarding to ensure that there was no contamination during the growing season (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\nOfficial inspection of plants for planting to the EU is conducted by NPPO at a 3-week interval. During such official inspections, NPPO inspectors check for the scouting records, and the crops including monitoring traps within and outside the production greenhouses. There are rarely incidences of thrips recorded in the scouting records or on the traps. Occasionally incidences of about 1–2 thrips in the entire greenhouse can be observed on the sticky traps. No incidence of aphids has ever been observed or documented. No samples of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. have resulted to be positive (based on the NPPO, grower or external laboratory test reports) for any of the pathogens tested (Dossier Section 2.0).\n\nIrrigation water source and testing: Water is mainly sourced from lakes or rivers. The water undergoes sedimentation, flocculation and filtration; thereafter, the water is chlorinated and passed through ultraviolet irradiation before used on the plants. The treated water is stored in tanks that are protected from contamination by soil. Quality Management System department established within the companies carry out periodic audits to confirm disinfection process. Records are kept, and these are checked by NPPO inspectors during inspections/audits. Water is tested weekly to check for any pathogens (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\nHygiene measures: Facilities have dedicated staff that handle solanaceous plants (Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp.). The growers have elaborated and documented hygiene protocols, and training undertaken for all workers on the protocol implementation. These hygiene protocols (Figure 4) include:\n\nUse of washable aprons, gumboots, head gears and gloves dedicated to each greenhouse.\n\nPruning tools are regularly disinfected and are dedicated to particular production benches. Maintenance and harvesting of crops/cuttings are done using knives. Ten knives are designated for use during the handling of plants per bed. Each knife is used on 10 plants and disinfected with an appropriate disinfectant for at least 20 mins.\n\nNursery staff enters the production facility in protective clothing. The protective clothing is kept within the double door entrance and disinfected after every use.\n\nAvailable disinfection at entrances using footbaths and hand wash areas using portable water and disinfectant.\n\nRegular training (biannual) of specific workers allocated to work in greenhouse holding solanaceous plants.\n\nTraceability protocols developed and implemented.\n\nThe production area in the greenhouse is kept weed free.\n\nThe production benches have a side cover to avoid direct contact of the workers clothing with the plants.\n\nPacking of harvested cuttings is done within the production greenhouses, and quality control is done to ensure the packaged cuttings meet the required specifications.\n\nIn case of any sample tested positive for any pathogen, facilities have decontamination procedures in place (quarantining the place and discarding the plant and the planting medium).\n\n3.3.3 Post-harvest processes and export procedure\n\nPeak weeks for export ranges between Weeks 48 and 13 of the following year. Expected volume from an individual nursery is around 10–60 M cuttings (both Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp.) shipped to EU in 1 year. The volumes vary from one facility to another. There are about seven facilities interested in exporting these commodities to the EU (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\nAll unrooted cuttings are harvested and packed within the production greenhouses, and quality control is done to ensure the packaged cuttings meet the required specifications. Packaging is done in perforated polythene bags. Labels with traceability information are included in the bag. The labels contain information of the commodity, variety, bed number from which harvesting was done, date of harvesting, harvester number/code, facility and customer. Each bag contains 105 cuttings. One hundred and fifty bags are placed in a box (Figure 5), hence about 15,000 cuttings per box. They are transported to cold store from greenhouse using cool boxes. Plants placed in cartons are transported in covered trucks that have a cooling system to the airport for shipping via air (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\n4 IDENTIFICATION OF PESTS POTENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMODITY\n\nThe search for potential pests associated with unrooted cuttings of Petunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. resulted in 463 species (see Microsoft Excel® file in Appendix D).\n\nThis list contains all the pests that were reported to infect/infest Petunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. based on thematic databases and systematic literature searches.\n\nAdditional relevant pests, with a broad host range, including solanaceous host plants, were included in the list, if there was evidence of presence in the country of export.\n\nAll viruses and viroids infecting major solanaceous crops (tomato, pepper, potato and cultivated tobacco) retrieved from CABI GD and recent review articles on the subject were included.\n\n4.1 Selection of relevant EU-regulated pests associated with the commodity\n\nThe EU listing of Union quarantine pests and protected zone (PZ) quarantine pests (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072) are based on assessments concluding that the pests can enter, establish, spread and have potential impact in the EU.\n\nFifty-three EU-regulated (QPs, RNQPs, emergency measures and PZ quarantine pests) species that are present in Kenya and reported to use Petunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. or major solanaceous hosts were evaluated for their relevance of being included in this opinion (Table 4 and Appendix D).\n\nNo.

Kenya;\n\nPetunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. are a potential host of the pest;\n\none or more life stages of the pest can be associated with the specified commodity.\n\nFor pests regulated as RNQPs, only the ones regulated for solanaceous crops were selected for further evaluation. In Table 4, an overview is given of the conclusion for the 53 EU-regulated pests that are known to use solanaceous host plants.\n\nOf the 53 EU-regulated pest species evaluated, 16 were selected for further evaluation.\n\n4.2 Selection of other relevant pests (non-regulated in the EU) associated with the commodity\n\nThe information provided by the NPPO of Kenya, integrated with the search EFSA performed, was evaluated in order to assess whether there are other relevant pests potentially associated with unrooted cuttings of Petunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. present in the country of export. For these potential pests that are not regulated in the EU, pest risk assessment information on the probability of introduction, establishment, spread and impact is usually lacking. Therefore, these non-regulated pests that are potentially associated with Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. were also evaluated to determine their relevance for this opinion based on evidence that:\n\nthe pest is present in Kenya.\n\nthe pest (i) is absent or (ii) has a limited distribution in the EU and it is under official control at least in one of the MSs where it is present;\n\nPetunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. are a potential host of the pest; one or more life stages of the pest can be associated with the specified commodity;\n\nthe pest may have an impact in the EU.\n\nPests that fulfilled all five criteria were selected for further evaluation.\n\nBased on the information collected, 137 potential pests not regulated in the EU, known to be associated with solanaceous host plants and potentially associated with Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. were evaluated for their relevance to this opinion. Details can be found in the Appendix D (Microsoft Excel® file). Of the evaluated EU non-regulated pests, six species were selected for further evaluation (Table 5).

A specific justification of the inclusion in this list is provided for each species in Appendix C.\n\n5 RISK MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nFor each selected pest for further evaluation, the Panel assessed the possibility that it could be present in nurseries producing Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp.\n\nThe information used in the evaluation of the efficacy of the risk mitigation measures is summarised in the pest data sheets (see Appendix A).\n\n5.1 Possibility of pest presence in the export nurseries\n\nFor each selected pest, the Panel evaluated the likelihood that the pest could be present in a Petunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. nursery by evaluating the possibility that Petunia spp. or Calibrachoa spp. plants in the export nursery are infested either by:\n\nintroduction of the pest from the environment surrounding the nursery,\n\nintroduction of the pest with new plants/seeds,\n\nspread of the pest within the nursery.\n\n5.2 Risk mitigation measures proposed\n\nWith the information provided by the NPPO of Kenya (Dossier sections 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0), the Panel summarised the risk mitigation measures (Table 7) that are currently applied in the production nursery.\n\nRisk mitigation measure Current measures in Kenya 1 Growing plants in isolation The unrooted cuttings are produced in dedicated greenhouses and isolated from other crops. The greenhouses are covered on top by polythene and the sidewalls are fitted with thrips-proof netting. The entrance of the greenhouse has a double door. The Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. are produced in the separate greenhouse units. There is no mixing of solanaceous plants with other ornamental plants in the same greenhouse 2 Dedicated hygiene measures\n\nFor accessing the greenhouse there is a double door system. Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. are produced in separate units. Plants are planted in new polythene bags or sterilised pots every season\n\nGrowers have elaborated and documented hygiene protocols, and training undertaken for all workers on the protocol implementation. These hygiene protocols include:\n\nUse of washable aprons, gumboots, head gears and gloves dedicated to each greenhouse.\n\nPruning tools are regularly disinfected and are dedicated to particular production benches.\n\nNursery staff enters the production facility in protective clothing. The protective clothing is kept within the double door entrance and disinfected after every use.\n\nAvailable disinfection at entrances using footbaths and hand wash areas using portable water and disinfectant.\n\nRegular training (biannual) of specific workers allocated to work in greenhouse holding solanaceous plants.\n\nTraceability protocols developed and implemented.\n\nThe production area in the greenhouse is kept weed free.\n\nThe production benches have a side cover to avoid direct contact of the workers clothing with the plants.\n\n3 Treatment of growing media New growing media are used every season. The media undergoes steaming at 80 or 90°C for 1–2 h after all 10 sensors reach 80°C. Farms steam at different temperatures with 80°C for a duration of 1 h being the minimum 4 Quality of source plant material The propagation material used for establishing mother plants originates from EU countries (Germany, Portugal, Spain) and non-EU countries (Israel). The imported planting material consists of tissue culture plantlets or unrooted cuttings and is certified as ‘Elite (Naktuinbouw)’ and tested for several viruses [tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV), alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), beet curly top virus (BCTV), tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), Arabis mosaic virus (ARMV), chilli pepper mild mottle virus (CPMMoV), turnip vein-clearing virus (TVCV), tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), potato virus Y (PVY), lettuce mosaic virus (LMV), potato virus A (PVA), Calibrachoa mottle virus (CbMV)] (Dossier section 1.0). Imported material is held in post entry quarantine facilities for 4 weeks and tested by the NPPO of Kenya for the above-mentioned viruses before being approved for further multiplication 5 Crop rotation No crop rotation takes place. Specific greenhouses units are used for producing Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. 6 Disinfection of irrigation water Water is mainly sourced from lakes or rivers. The water undergoes, sedimentation, flocculation and filtration; thereafter, the water is chlorinated and passed through ultraviolet irradiation before used on the plants. The treated water is stored in tanks that are well protected from contamination by soil. Quality Management System department established within the companies carry out periodic audits to confirm disinfection process. Records are kept and these are checked by NPPO inspectors during inspections/audits. Water is tested weekly to check for any pathogen 7 Treatment of crop during production Biological control agents used to manage insect pests include Phytoseiulus persimilis and Amblyseius spp. mites and Beauveria bassiana. The chemical pesticide sprays include Spinosad, Flonicamid, Pyrethrins and Abamectin. Furthermore, Benevia (cyantraniliprole) and neem oil are used to control Frankliniella occidentalis 8 Pest monitoring and inspections Daily scouting is conducted by nursery staff and pest incidents are recorded. Yellow and blue sticky traps are used to monitor the presence of whiteflies, aphids and thrips. Pheromone and light traps are used to monitor lepidopterans, in particular Duponchelia spp. Some sticky traps are placed outside the greenhouse to monitor the population of whiteflies in the environment 9 Sampling and testing\n\nThree to four weeks after planting, mother plants are tested at 100% sampling and testing for TSWV, PSTVd, INSV, AMV, CMV, BCTV, ToMV, TMV, TRSV, ARMV, CPMMoV, TVCV, ToBRFV, PVY, LMV, PVA, CbMV (Dossier section 1.0). During active growth, routine testing of mother plants (10%–25%) is done throughout the production period at intervals of between either weekly or biweekly. Sampling intensity varies among the growers, but it is usually between 10% and 25%. Testing is done in EU-accredited laboratories\n\nNo samples of Petunia spp. and Calibrochoa spp. have been tested positive (based on the NPPO, grower or external laboratory test reports) for any of the pathogens mentioned above (Dossier sections 1.0 and 2.0)\n\nIn the event of B. tabaci and F. occidentalis discovery, 10% of the plants are sampled and tested using molecular assays (conventional or real-time PCR): genus specific for begomoviruses and tospoviruses and species specific for TYLCV, TSWV and INSV. So far, no samples have been tested positive during routine testing for begomoviruses and tospoviruses. Potyviruses are tested using species-specific serological assays and molecular techniques\n\n10 Official Supervision by NPPO\n\nPlants are grown in certified production sites for plants for planting. Imported material are held in post entry quarantine facilities for 4 weeks and tested by the NPPO for several viruses before being approved for further multiplication\n\nOfficial inspections during the production are conducted every 3 weeks. If monitoring indicates that B. tabaci or F. occidentalis is present in a production facility, appropriate pesticides will be applied and 10% of the plants will be sampled for testing of begomoviruses or tospoviruses respectively. Furthermore, any potential incursion into the greenhouses once detected leads to suspension of the production facility in line with the EU regulations. If tests are negative, exports of the plants will be recommended\n\n11 Surveillance of production area Surveillance to detect the presence of insects is performed using sticky traps placed outside the greenhouse.

Given the wide host range of this pest it is possible that local populations of A. dispersus may be present in the neighbouring environment. Flying adults of A. dispersus and young first instar crawlers, can enter the nursery through defects in the insect proof screen or as hitchhikers on clothes of nursery staff from host plants that might be present in the surrounding environment.\n\nUncertainties:\n\nThe A. dispersus population pressure in the surrounding environment of the nursery.\n\nThe presence and distribution of host plants in the surroundings.\n\nThe presence of defects in the greenhouse structure.\n\nA.1.2.2 Possibility of entry with new plants/seeds\n\nThe probability that A. dispersus is present on the starting material is very low/negligible as the imported material is certified (elite) and is kept in the post-quarantine facility before released to the nursery.\n\nUncertainties: None.\n\nA.1.2.3 Possibility of spread within the nursery\n\nOther solanaceous and non-solanaceous host plants could be present in the same nursery. When present, flying adults searching for food sources can spread from infested host plants species within the nursery. Hitchhiking of whiteflies (adults) on human clothes is unlikely. Petunia spp. plants for export are produced in a separate unit with hygienic standards (thrips-proof netting, double doors, clean uniforms) with no mixing with the other ornamentals. It is unlikely that whiteflies can spread to the production unit of Petunia spp. plants if all hygienic standards are correctly applied.\n\nUncertainties: The specific host plants of A. dispersus other than Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. that are grown in the nursery and their official control measures.\n\nA.1.3 Information from interceptions\n\nThere are no interceptions of A. dispersus from Kenya on any imported commodity, or on Petunia spp./Calibrachoa spp. imports from all origins.\n\nA.1.4 Risk mitigation measures applied in the nurseries\n\nRisk reduction option Effect (Yes/No) Evaluation and uncertainties Growing plants in isolation Yes\n\nThe unrooted cuttings are produced in dedicated greenhouses and isolated from other crops.

These viruses and at least M. persicae, which is their most efficient vector, are present in Kenya (CABI, EPPO, online). Defect in the insect-proof structure of the production greenhouses could enable aphids to enter, as well as hitchhiking aphids on persons or materials entering the greenhouse. Therefore, the infestation of plants in the nursery with viruliferous aphids that acquire the virus is the main entry pathway of PVMV and PLRV in the nursery from the surrounding environment. However, PVMV is non-persistently transmitted; that is, aphids can only transmit for only very short period of time and therefore present a limited risk compared to the persistently transmitted PLRV.\n\nUncertainties:\n\nPresence of defects in the greenhouse structure.\n\nInfection (virus) and infestation (aphid vectors) pressure in the surroundings.\n\nPresence and distribution of host plants in the surroundings.\n\nA.2.2.2 Possibility of entry with new plants/seeds\n\nPlant material (cuttings) for Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. mother plants used for the production of unrooted cuttings originate from the Germany, Portugal, Spain and Israel. PVMV and non-EU isolates of PLRV are not present in the EU (EPPO GD) but the latter are present in Israel. From all countries ‘Elite planting material’ according to the Naktuinbouw certification programme is imported. The certification scheme in place for Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. does not include PVMV or PLRV. However, PVMV can still be detected as plants are tested with a generic test for potyviruses.\n\nOther solanaceous and non-solanaceous plants are produced in the same nursery, even though not in the same compartments. No data are provided for the identity, proportion, origin and phytosanitary status of plants other than Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. produced in the same nursery.\n\nUncertainties:\n\nThe origin, the host status for PVMV and PLRV and the phytosanitary status of other plant species (solanaceous, non-solanaceous) than Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. entering the same nursery.\n\nA.2.2.3 Possibility of spread within the nursery\n\nPetunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. are cultivated in compartments dedicated for their cultivation without mixing with other crop/plants (Dossier point 1.8). However, other plants (solanaceous and non-solanaceous) possible hosts of tospoviruses are cultivated and aphids could be present in other greenhouses/compartments of the nursery. M. persicae is the most efficient vector of all aphid-transmitted viruses occurring in greenhouses and a major pest of ornamentals (CABI, online). Viruliferous aphids could spread PYMV and PLRV between the different or within the same greenhouse/compartment. These viruses may also spread by vegetative propagation of infected mother plants. There are strict hygiene conditions inside the nursery that may prevent the spread of the aphids within the nursery compartments, while the probability of alate aphid infestation is low.\n\nUncertainties:\n\nThe presence and density of the PYMV, PLRV and aphids-vectors in the nursery.\n\nThe presence and the host status for PYMV and PLRV of other plant species (solanaceous, non-solanaceous) growing in the same nursery.\n\nThe level of physical separation (with thrips-proof netting) of the Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. production units with other production units\n\nA.2.3 Information from interceptions\n\nPVMV: There were no interceptions of pepper veinal mottle virus on different commodities imported into the EU from Kenya or from any other third country (EUROPHYT and TRACES, online [Accessed: 14 October 2023]).\n\nPLRV: There were no interceptions of potato leafroll virus on different commodities imported into the EU from Kenya\n\nA.2.4 Risk mitigation measures applied in the nurseries\n\nRisk reduction option Effect (Yes/No) Evaluation and uncertainties Growing plants in isolation Yes\n\nThe unrooted cuttings are produced in dedicated greenhouses and isolated from other crops. The greenhouses are covered on top by polythene and the sidewalls are fitted with thrips-proof netting. The entrance of the greenhouse has a double door. The Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. are produced in the separate greenhouse units. There is no mixing of solanaceous plants with other ornamental plants in the same greenhouse\n\nEvaluation: The insect proof netting prevents the introduction of insects from the surrounding environment. However, aphids may be introduced through defects in the greenhouse or as hitchhiking on workers\n\nUncertainties: Presence of unnoticed defects in the greenhouse structure\n\nDedicated hygiene measures Yes\n\nFor accessing the greenhouse there is a double door system. Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. are produced in separate units. Plants are planted in new polythene bags or sterilised pots every season\n\nGrowers have elaborated and documented hygiene protocols, and training undertaken for all workers on the protocol implementation. These hygiene protocols include:\n\nUse of washable aprons, gumboots, head gears and gloves dedicated to each greenhouse.\n\nPruning tools are regularly disinfected and are dedicated to particular production benches.\n\nNursery staff enters the production facility in protective clothing. The protective clothing is kept within the double door entrance and disinfected after every use.\n\nAvailable disinfection at entrances using footbaths and hand wash areas using portable water and disinfectant.\n\nRegular training (biannual) of specific workers allocated to work in greenhouse holding solanaceous plants.\n\nTraceability protocols developed and implemented.\n\nThe production area in the greenhouse is kept weed free.\n\nThe production benches have a side cover to avoid direct contact of the workers clothing with the plants.\n\nEvaluation: The double door system with the expeller fan at the door can be effective in preventing the entry of aphids via active flying and entry and spread of the aphid-transmitted viruses. The fact that potyviruses are not detected during monitoring of the crop indicates that the above-mentioned measures are efficiently applied\n\nUncertainties: The strictness of the measures applied\n\nTreatment of growing media No New growing media are used every season. The media undergoes steaming at 80 or 90°C for 1–2 h after all 10 sensors reach 80°C. Farms steam at different temperatures with 80°C for a duration of 1 h being the minimum Quality of source plant material Yes\n\nThe propagation material used for establishing mother plants originatesfrom EU countries (Germany, Portugal, Spain) and non- EU countries (Israel). The imported planting material consists of tissue culture plantlets or unrooted cuttings and is certified as ‘Elite (Naktuinbouw)’ and tested for several viruses [(tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV), alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), beet curly top virus (BCTV), tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), Arabis mosaic virus (ARMV), chilli pepper mild mottle virus (CPMMoV), turnip vein-clearing virus (TVCV), tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), potato virus Y (PVY), lettuce mosaic virus (LMV), potato virus A (PVA), Calibrachoa mottle virus (CbMV)] (Dossier section 1.0). Imported material is held in post entry quarantine facilities for 4 weeks and tested by the NPPO of Kenya for the above-mentioned viruses before being approved for further multiplication\n\nEvaluation: Although PYMV is not included in the certification scheme, it is expected to be detected with the use of potyvirus generic tests. PLRV is not included in the certification scheme applied; therefore, plants are not expected to be tested for PLRV\n\nUncertainties: none\n\nCrop rotation No\n\nNo crop rotation takes place. Specific greenhouses units are used for producing Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp.\n\nEvaluation: No crop rotation with non-host plants takes place. In case of introduction into the greenhouse, populations of aphid vectors may build up since the same unit is used for production of Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp.\n\nUncertainties: None\n\nDisinfection of irrigation water No Water is mainly sourced from lakes or rivers. The water undergoes, sedimentation, flocculation and filtration; thereafter, the water is chlorinated and passed through ultraviolet irradiation before used on the plants. The treated water is stored in tanks that are well protected from contamination by soil. Quality Management System department established within the companies carry out periodic audits to confirm disinfection process. Records are kept and these are checked by NPPO inspectors during inspections/audits. Water is tested weekly to check for any pathogen Treatment of crop during production Yes\n\nBiological control agents used to manage insect pests include Phytoseiulus persimilis, Beauveria bassiana and Amblyseius mites. The chemical pesticide sprays include Spinosad, Flonicamid, Pyrethrins and Abamectin. Furthermore, Benevia (cyantraniliprole) and neem oil are used to control Frankliniella occidentalis\n\nEvaluation: The products used are known to control a range of insect species (including whiteflies and aphids). Aphids are easier to control than other insect vectors\n\nUncertainties: The efficiency of the applied insecticides against aphid species that might have developed insecticide resistance\n\nPest monitoring and inspections Yes\n\nDaily scouting is conducted by nursery staff and pest incidences are recorded. Yellow and blue sticky traps are used to monitor for the presence of whiteflies, aphids and thrips. Pheromone and light traps are used to monitor lepidopterans, in particular Duponchelia spp. Some sticky traps are placed outside the greenhouse to monitor the population of whiteflies in the environment\n\nEvaluation: Yellow sticky traps are effective to detect the presence of alate aphids. Monitoring could detect virus-infected petunia plants. However, early infections cannot be detected due to the lack of symptoms\n\nUncertainties:\n\nThe efficiency of yellow sticky traps to detect early aphid infestations.\n\nThe efficiency of monitoring and inspection.\n\nThe symptoms on Petunia spp. and Calibrachoa spp. and the length of the latent period till the expression of symptoms.\n\nSampling and testing Yes\n\nThree to four weeks after planting, mother plants are tested at 100% sampling and testing for TSWV, PSTVd, INSV, AMV, CMV, BCTV, ToMV, TMV, TRSV, ARMV, CPMMoV, TVCV, ToBRFV, PVY, LMV, PVA, CbMV (Dossier section 1.0). During active growth, routine testing of mother plants (10%–25%) is done throughout the production period at intervals of between either weekly or biweekly. Sampling intensity varies among the growers, but it is usually between 10% and 25%. Testing is done in EU-accredited laboratories\n\nNo samples of Petunia spp. and Calibrochoa spp. have tested positive (based on the NPPO, grower or external laboratory test reports) for any of the pathogens mentioned above (Dossier sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\nIn the event of B. tabaci and F. occidentalis discovery, 10% of the plants are sampled and tested using molecular assays (conventional or real-time PCR): genus specific for begomoviruses and tospoviruses and species specific for TYLCV, TSWV and INSV. So far, no samples have been tested positive during routine testing for begomoviruses and tospoviruses. Potyviruses are tested using species-specific serological assays and molecular techniques\n\nEvaluation: Plants are tested for some potyviruses but not for PVMV and PLRV. However, no specific data are available (sampling scheme) for the evaluation of the efficacy of the sampling and testing. No samples of Petunia spp. and Calibrochoa spp. have been tested positive (based on the NPPO, grower or external laboratory test reports) for any of the pathogens mentioned in the dossier\n\nUncertainties: The efficiency of the sampling method and testing intensity to detect infections\n\nOfficial Supervision by NPPO Yes\n\nPlants are grown in certified production sites for plants for planting. Imported material are held in post entry quarantine facilities for 4 weeks and tested by the NPPO for several viruses before being approved for further multiplication\n\nOfficial inspections during the production are conducted every 3 weeks. If monitoring indicates that B. tabaci or F. occidentalis is present in a production facility, appropriate pesticides will be applied and 10% of the plants will be sampled for testing of begomoviruses or tospoviruses respectively. Furthermore, any potential incursion into the greenhouses once detected leads to suspension of the production facility in line with the EU regulations. If tests are negative, exports of the plants will be recommended\n\nEvaluation: No official measures present for aphid control in the production system\n\nUncertainties: The efficiency of detecting the early aphid infestations and virus presence, especially in low infection levels\n\nSurveillance of production area Yes\n\nSurveillance to detect the presence of insects is performed using sticky traps placed outside the greenhouse. No details are given for the surveillance of any other "
