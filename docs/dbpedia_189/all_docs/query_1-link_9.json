        "text": "Viola odorata L., also known as the sweet or garden violet, is native in Europe and Asia but has been naturalized worldwide and is broadly used as an ornamental plant and in the cosmetics industry. Cercospora viola is an economically important pathogen which causes leaf spotting and defoliation on violet. In late autumn 2013, symptoms resembling Cercospora leaf spot were observed on leaves of garden violets grown in several private gardens in the Belgrade district in Serbia. Lesions were circular to subcircular, more or less sunken, light brown at the edges, and darkening towards the center into a dark brown ring with caespituli. Conidiophores arising from the stromata formed dense fascicles (40-150 × 3-7 μm), and were simple and straight with distinctly thickened loci. Conidia were solitary, hyaline, cylindrical to obclavate or acicular (55-160 × 3-5 μm), 6 to 14 septate. Single conidia were isolated and cultivated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) to generate monosporic isolates. Mycelial plugs 5 mm in diameter were extracted from the PDA plates and placed upside down on the adaxial leaf surface of three-week old seedlings of garden violet. Control plants were inoculated with a sterile PDA plug. Two leaves per plant were disinfected with 70% ethanol and the epidermis was scratched with a sterile needle to promote infection before inoculation. A total of 10 plants were inoculated with mycelial plugs and 10 were used as control plants. Inoculated and control plants were kept in the moist chamber for 72 hours and then transferred into the greenhouse at 25 ± 2oC. After ten days, the first necrotic spots appeared on inoculated leaves, similar to symptoms manifested in the field, while control plants remained symptomless. The pathogen was re-isolated and its identity was verified based on morphological and molecular features. Three isolates (VL1-1, VL2-1, VL3) were subjected to molecular identification based on the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) using the ITS1/ITS4 universal primers, a calmodulin gene (CAL) using CAL-228F/CAL2Rd primers (Carbone and Kohn 1999; Groenewald et al. 2013) and histone gene (H3) using CYLH3F/CYLH3R primers (Crous et al. 2004). Sequences of the amplified regions were deposited in GenBank under Accession Numbers KP064304-12. BLAST analysis of the ITS sequences revealed a 100% identity with a number of Cercospora species. However, sequence comparison of the other two genes identified the pathogen infecting garden violet as Cercospora violae. Both CAL and H3 gene sequences showed a 100% identity with the reference sequences of C. violae (JX143005, JX143004, JX142760 and JX142759). Cercospora violae has been previously reported in Bulgaria, Romania and Poland (Farr and Rossman, 2015, Groenewald et al, 2006), however, this record, to our knowledge, represents the first report of Cercospora violae causing a leaf spot disease on the garden violet in Serbia.\n\nThe carrot (Daucus carota L. subsp. sativus [Hoffm.] Arcang.) is an important vegetable in Serbia, where it is grown on nearly 8,000 ha. In August 2012, approximately 1,500 ha of carrot fields were inspected in southern Bačka in North Serbia. In nearly 40% of the inspected fields, severe foliar and stem symptoms characteristic of Cercospora leaf spot of carrot, caused by Cercospora carotae (Pass.) Solheim (3), were observed. Lesions on stems were oblong, elliptical, and more or less sunken, while those on the leaves were amphigenous, subcircular, light brown in the center, and surrounded by a dark brown margin. Conidiophores emerging from the lesions formed very loose tufts but sometimes were solitary. Conidiophores were simple and straight to subflexuous with a bulbous base (dimensions of 17-37 × 3-5 µm). Conidia were 58-102 × 2-4 µm, solitary, cylindrical to narrowly-obclavate, and hyaline to subhyaline with 2 to 6 septa. To obtain monosporial isolates, the conidia from one lesion were placed on water agar plates at 25°C in the dark for 24 h, after which single germinated conidia were selected and each placed on a Petri dish containing potato dextrose agar (PDA). To confirm pathogenicity of three of the isolates, Koch's postulates were tested on carrot seedlings (3-true-leaf stage of growth) of a Nantes cultivar, SP-80, with 12 plants tested/isolate and 12 non-inoculated plants used as a control treatment. The leaves were atomized until run-off with the appropriate C. carotae spore suspension (1.0 × 104 conidia/ml sterilized water), while control plants were atomized similarly with sterilized water. All of the plants were then incubated in a dew chamber for 72 h, and subsequently transferred to a greenhouse set at 25 ± 2°C. After two weeks, characteristic symptoms resembling those observed in the field developed on all of the inoculated plants, while the control plants remained asymptomatic. The pathogen was re-isolated from all inoculated plants, and identity of the reisolated fungi confirmed morphologically as described above, as well as molecularly as described below. The pathogenicity test was repeated with no significant differences in shape and size of lesions, or dimensions of conidiophores and conidia among isolates. To verify the pathogen identity molecularly, the 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was amplified and sequenced using the V9G/LR5 primer set (2,4) as well as internal primers OR-A (5′-ATACCCGCTGAACTTAAGC-3′) and 2R-C (5′-AAGTACTTTGGAAAGAG-3′); the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA using the ITS1/ITS4 universal primers (5); and histone H3 gene (H3) using the CylH3F/CylH3R primers (1). The sequences for the three isolates were deposited in GenBank as Accession Numbers KF468808 to KF468810, KF941306 to KF941308, and KF941303 to KF941305 for the 28S rDNA, ITS and H3 regions, respectively. BLAST results for the ITS sequences indicated 94% similarity to the ITS sequence of an isolate of Pseudocercosporella capsellae (GU214662) and 92% similarity to the ITS sequence of an isolate of Cercospora capsici (HQ700354). The H3 sequences shared 91% similarity with that of several Cercospora species, e.g., C. apii (JX142548), C. beticola (AY752258), and C. capsici (JX142584), all of which shared the same amino acid sequence of the encoded H3 protein. Additionally, the 28S rDNA sequences had 99% similarity (identity of 318/319, with 0 gaps) with the single sequence of C. carotae available in GenBank (AY152628), which originated from Norway. This is, to our knowledge the first report of C. carotae on carrot crops in Serbia as well as southeastern Europe.\n\nHorseradish, Armoracia rusticana (P. Gaertn., B. Mey. & Scherb.), is a native or cultivated perennial plant that is grown worldwide and used for nutritional purposes or in alternative medicine (Agneta et al. 2013). Cercospora leaf spot, caused by Cercospora armoraciae (Sacc.), is a common fungal disease of horseradish (Walters and Wahle 2010). Production of horseradish in Serbia covers nearly 1,500 ha. Symptoms of Cercospora leaf spot were observed on leaves of horseradish in late autumn 2013 in the Braničevo district of Serbia. In total, 30 fields were inspected, with the incidence of symptoms ranging from 30 to 70%/field. Circular to subcircular, sunken lesions were observed with amphigenous caespituli and slight discoloration, from dark brown, tanned edges to a light brown zone in the center of each lesion. Conidiophores were cylindrical, solitary, or in loose to divergent fascicles, pale brown, simple and straight to strongly geniculate (60 to 120 μm × 4 to 6 μm). Conidia were solitary, hyaline, straight to mildly curved, cylindro-obclavate to acicular, distinctly thickened at the base, 4- to 9-septate, and obtuse at the apex (75 to 125 μm × 3 to 6 μm) (Groenewald et al. 2013). Single-spore isolates (n = 36) collected from affected fields, each derived from a germinated conidium from a different lesion, were established on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Isolates R5, R6, and R7 were chosen randomly to confirm pathogenicity using Koch's postulates. Colonized mycelial PDA plugs, each 5 mm in diameter, were placed mycelial side down in contact with the adaxial leaf surface of 5-week-old horseradish seedlings. Two leaves per plant were inoculated and slightly curved using garden wire to prevent the agar plugs from dislodging. Six plants were inoculated with colonized agar plugs, and six plants were used as non-inoculated control plants treated similarly but with sterilized, non-colonized PDA plugs. Seedlings were kept in a moist chamber for 72 h and then transferred into a greenhouse set at 25 ± 2oC. After two weeks, symptoms resembling those observed on the original plants in the field developed on all of the inoculated plants, while the control plants remained asymptomatic. The same fungal pathogen was re-isolated from inoculated, symptomatic leaves and identified to species morphologically, but not from the control plants. DNA was extracted from R5, R6, and R7 isolates, and PCR assays used to amplify: 1) a portion of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA, 2) the calmodulin gene (CAL), and 3) the histone gene (H3), using the primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), CAL-228F/CAL2Rd (Carbone and Kohn 1999; Groenewald et al. 2013), and CYLH3F/CYLH3R (Crous et al. 2004), respectively. Sequences of the CAL, H3, and ITS regions of R5, R6, and R7 isolates were deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. KP868780 to KP868788), respectively. BLAST analysis of the ITS sequences revealed 100% identity with ITS sequences of Cercospora armoraciae, C. nicotianae, C. malayensis, C. beticola, and C. citrullina. The CAL and H3 sequences were identical to reference sequences of C. armoraciae (CAL: JX142808, JX142809, and JX142810l; H3: JX142554, JX142556, and JX142560). This record, to our knowledge, represents the first report of C. armoraciae causing leaf spot on horseradish in Serbia.\n\nCarrot (Daucus carota L. subsp. sativus [Hoffm.] Arcang.) is an important vegetable in Serbia, grown on nearly 8,000 ha. In summer 2013, a black fungal mycelium was noticed on the surface of carrot roots stored in polyethylene bags. The symptoms are manifested as irregular black patches in random pattern, increasing in size to cover all carrot root surface. Disease development was more severe when carrots were washed prior to packing and stored at room temperature. These features are characteristic of Thielaviopsis thielavioides (Peyronel) Paulin, Harrington & McNew, (synonym Chalaropsis thielavioides (Peyronel)), as well as of closely related species T. basicola, causal agents of postharvest blackening of carrots (Paulin-Mahady et al. 2002). Aleurioconidia were single, thick, dark-walled, arisen from the tip of specialized hyphae. Dimensions were 8 to 18 × 9 to 14 µm. Phialoconidia were produced from terminal cells on large phialides produced on short, septate, aerial hyphae. Phialoconidia measured 10 to 21 × 4 to 10 µm. Based on the morphological features we identified the pathogen as Thielaviopsis thielavioides (Paulin-Mahady et al. 2002). Single-spore isolates were produced from aerial phialoconidia placed on water agar and incubated at 25°C in the dark and after 24h single germinated conidia were transferred to individual Petri plates containing PDA. Koch's postulates were performed on carrot roots to confirm the pathogenicity of three isolates (TT2, TT3, TT4). For each isolate, 10 roots of the commonly used 'Nantes SP-80' were inoculated with 10 non-inoculated carrots as a control. The roots were sprayed until runoff with a spore suspension of 1.0 × 104 conidia/ml in sterile water. Similarly, the control roots were sprayed with sterile water. All roots were incubated in a dew chamber for one week (t = 25°C; RH = 95% ± 3), when the same symptoms observed in the polyethylene bags developed on all inoculated roots. Control roots remained asymptomatic. The pathogen was re-isolated from all inoculated carrot roots. Identity of the re-isolated fungus was confirmed based on the morphological characteristics described above. The pathogenicity test was repeated with no important differences in symptoms, or dimensions of conidia among isolates. To further verify pathogen identity the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified using ITS1/ITS4 primers (White et al. 1990) and sequenced with an automated equipment (Macrogen Inc., Korea). Sequences for the three isolates were deposited in GenBank under Accession Numbers KP231218 to KP231220. BLAST analysis of ITS sequences indicated a 100% identity to the reference ITS sequence of Thielaviopsis thielavioides (HM031127) from Australia retrieved from the NCBI database. This represents the first report of T. thielavioides developing on carrots in Serbia."
