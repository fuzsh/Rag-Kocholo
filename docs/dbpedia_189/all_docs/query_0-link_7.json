        "text": "In October 2016, disease was observed on stems and branches of asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) in an organic crop at a fresh market farm in Ontario Co., NY. Lesions were small (<2 to 3 cm in length), generally oval and gray to tan with a reddish-brown margin. The disease was associated with defoliation on approximately 40% of plants. Conidiophores and conidia typical of Cercospora were observed within the lesions. Morphological characteristics of the fungus were consistent with descriptions of C. asparagi (Braun et al. 2014). Conidiomata were brown, consisting of dense conidiophores on a defined stroma (25 to 100 µm long × 2.5 to 4.5 µm wide). Conidia were solitary, hyaline, straight to curved, acicular, with hila at the base (40 to 90 µm long × 2.5 to 4 µm wide). Fifty microliters of T-water (0.06% v/v Tween-20 + 0.02% w/v ampicillin) were placed on individual sporulating lesions. The conidial suspension was transferred to water agar (+ 0.02% w/v ampicillin) and incubated at room temperature. Cultures arising from single conidia were transferred to clarified V8 juice agar (10% v/v clarified V8 juice, 0.5% CaCO3, 1.5% w/v agar) and incubated at room temperature. Two reference isolates, AS16-01 and AS16-02, were deposited at the International Collection of Microorganisms from Plants (ICMP), Landcare Research, Auckland, New Zealand, as accessions 21630 and 21631, respectively. Dried, diseased plant material was deposited at the Cornell Plant Pathology Herbarium (CUP-068247). Isolates were grown in clarified V8 broth (10% v/v clarified V8 juice, 0.5% w/v CaCO3) on a shaker at 100 rpm for 10 days at room temperature. Mycelia were harvested and lyophilized for DNA extraction using a QIAGEN DNeasy Plant Mini Kit. The internal transcribed spacer of the nrDNA (ITS), actin, histone H3, translation elongation factor-1α, and calmodulin genes were amplified and sequenced using the primers described by Groenewald et al. (2013). The large subunit (LSU) of the nrDNA was amplified and sequenced using primers LR0R (Rehner and Samuels 1994), LR5, and LR7 (Vilgalys and Hester 1990). The ITS sequences of both isolates were identical to C. asparagi reported in Japan (JX964995), and 99% similar to C. asparagi in the United States (AF297229). No other sequences of C. asparagi were available in the GenBank database but those of the remaining loci showed high similarity (>98%) to multiple Cercospora spp. GenBank accessions for isolates AS16-01 and AS16-02 are KY549099 and KY549100 (LSU), KY549097 and KY549098 (ITS), KY549091 and KY549092 (actin), KY549093 and KY549094 (calmodulin), KY549095 and KY549096 (histone H3), and KY549101 and KY549102 (translation elongation factor-1α). Pathogenicity tests were not performed since the association of asparagus-C. asparagi was already known. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Cercospora blight caused by C. asparagi on asparagus in NY. In the United States, Cercospora blight of asparagus may cause substantial losses in warm, humid environments similar to conditions in NY in late summer, and has been reported in CA, FL, HI, IL, NC, NE, NM, OK, and TX (Farr and Rossman 2017)."
