T., Trueman, C. L., Gossen, B. D., McKeown, A. W. et McDonald, M. R. 2014. Influence des engrais azotés et calciques sur le mildiou et le rendement du céleri. Can. J. Plant Sci. 94: 1391–1399. Le mildiou (Septoria apiicola) réduit à la fois le rendement et la qualité du céleri destiné au marché en frais et à la transformation. Les auteurs ont procédé à des essais sur le terrain pendant quatre années-sites afin d’évaluer les effets du taux d'application des engrais azotés (N) et des applications foliaires de calcium (Ca) sur l'apparition du mildiou et le rendement du céleri cultivé sur un sol tourbeux, riche en substances organiques. Ils ont inclus un traitement avec le fongicide de protection chlorothalonil afin de déterminer si on pourrait remplacer l'antiparasitaire par un engrais dans la culture du céleri. Chaque variable associée à la maladie et au rendement révèle une interaction cultivar×année-site. L'application répétitive de chlorothalonil atténue le mildiou et augmente de manière générale la hauteur des plants, leur poids et leur rendement commercialisable. Le taux d'application des engrais N a peu d'effet sur le mildiou, et cet effet varie avec les années-sites. La surface sous la courbe de développement de la maladie a diminué avec l'augmentation du taux d'application des engrais N aux deux sites, en 2008. De même, augmenter la quantité d'engrais N appliquée a entraîné une amélioration du rendement une année-site sur quatre. L'application de Ca n'a aucune incidence sur la gravité du mildiou et n'a accru le rendement que pour une année-site. La gravité du mildiou est négativement corrélée au rendement. La concentration de N dans les tissus varie avec le traitement aux sites relativement pauvres en matière organique, mais pas aux sites organiquement riches. Les traitements n'influent pas sur la teneur en Ca des tissus. L'application de N ou de Ca ne permet pas à elle seule de combattre adéquatement le mildiou, bien que la gravité de la maladie diminue légèrement avec la hausse du taux d'application des engrais N. L'application de N et de Ca améliore le rendement et concourt indirectement à rendre la lutte contre le mildiou plus facile quand s'y ajoute l'usage d'un fongicide et d'autres méthodes de lutte intégrée.\n\nCelery is a high-value, low-acreage crop that receives high rates of fertilizer and several fungicide sprays each production cycle. In Canada, celery is produced on about 900 ha with a farm gate value of about $12 million (Statistics Canada 2012) and the crop is mainly grown on muck (organic or histosol) soil. Celery is sensitive to nutrient balance (Tremblay and Parent 1994) and requires relatively high levels of soil nitrogen (N) to maximize yield (El-Sayed et al. 2011). Calcium deficiency results in a physiological disorder of celery called blackheart (Raid 2002) and several foliar applications of Ca may be required to prevent development of blackheart symptoms (Bouzo et al. 2007). Crop response to applied N varies among sites based on soil characteristics and irrigation management (Hartz et al. 2000). In addition to increasing crop growth and yield, fertilization can also influence the chemical composition of celery (Gurgul and Herman 1994), and so may influence taste, quality and nutritional value.\n\nQuality standards are very high for both fresh market and processing celery, and blemishes on the leaves and petioles are not accepted. Late blight of celery, which is caused by Septoria apiicola Speg., is one of the most important foliar diseases of celery (Sutton and Waterst 1966). Infection of leaves and petioles reduces quality and yield. In Ontario, recommendations for management of late blight include crop rotation, selection of resistant cultivars, avoidance of infected transplants, and application of fungicides, including chlorothalonil, copper-based fungicides, dithiocarbamates such as mancozeb, and pyraclostrobin, boscalid or trifloxystrobin [Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) 2012]. The protectant fungicide program starts before transplanting, when seedlings are 5 cm high, and continues after transplanting on a 7- to 10-d schedule when plants are one-third grown or as soon as the first symptoms are observed in the field (OMAFRA 2010). Although these management strategies are often effective in late blight management, incorporating cultural practices such as fertilizer application may have a role in reducing disease incidence and severity and thereby reduce the number of fungicide applications required.\n\nThe effect of N fertilization on disease expression and development differs in specific host-pathogen relationships. For example, the severity of leaf spot pathogens and yield of wheat (Olesen et al. 2003) and severity of powdery mildew and downy mildew in grape (Bavaresco and Eibach 1987) increased with increasing rates of N, but the incidence of tan spot [Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Died.) Drechs.] in wheat was reduced as N increased (Huber et al. 1987). Nitrogen fertilization tends to reduce disease severity on crops such as celery and carrots belonging to the family Apiaceae. For example, application of N fertilizers reduced early blight caused by Cercospora apii Fresen in celery (Burdine and Thayer 1960), and high rates of N reduced leaf blight caused by Alternaria dauci (Kühn) Groves and Skolko and C. carotae (Pass.) Solheim on carrot (Westerveld et al. 2008).\n\nCalcium has been associated with reductions in abiotic stress caused by freezing in onion and heat in potato (Palta 1996). There is evidence that Ca can affect the severity of biotic plant disease by improving cell structures or through surface salt effects, but the results are not consistent across studies. Bacterial soft rot of potato, caused by Erwinia carotovora pv. Stroseptica (van Hall) Dye, was reduced with increasing Ca concentration in tubers in storage, possibly due to improved cellular structure (McGuire and Kelman 1984). Also, foliar application of potassium chloride reduced the severity of leaf spot (Septoria tritici Rob. in Desm.) on wheat (Mann et al. 2004) and incidence and severity of white mould [Sclerotiania sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary] on dry bean (Jünior et al. 2009), but had no effect on yield. However, Ca application had no effect on reducing fruit rot in cranberry (Blodgett et al. 2002).\n\nThe objectives of this study were to assess the effect of increasing rates of N fertilization and repeated Ca fertilizer application on late blight severity and yield of celery grown in high organic matter (muck) soils.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nField trials were conducted at or near the University of Guelph Muck Crops Research Station, Holland Marsh, Ontario, Canada (lat. 44°5′N, long. 79°35′W) in 2004, 2005 and 2008. In 2004, the study was conducted at a site with pH 6.4 and organic matter (OM) of ∼60% (designated as High OM), and in 2005 at a site with pH 6.8 and OM of ∼40% (designated as Low OM, although in most soils, this would still be considered very high organic matter content). In 2008, the study was conducted at a site with pH 6.5 and OM ∼70% (High OM) and a second site with pH 7.2 and OM of ∼48% (Low OM). Each site was arranged in a split-plot design with four replicates. The main plot factor was fertilizer treatment and cultivar was the sub-plot factor. Each sub-plot consisted of three 5-m-long rows with 55 cm between rows. The fertilizer treatments consisted of combinations of N rate, foliar application of Ca, and foliar application of a recommended fungicide. These combinations were selected based on the recommended fertilization regime for the region, which consists of a preplant application of nitrogen (N) at 80 kg ha−1 plus 40 kg ha−1 side-dressed at 5 wk after transplanting, together with foliar application of calcium (Ca) at 1.9 kg ha−1 every week after transplanting to prevent blackheart (OMAFRA 2010). The N rate treatments, applied as 2/3 preplant and 1/3 side-dressed NH4NO3 (Alliance Agri-Turf Inc. Bolton, ON), were 0, 60, 120, 180 and 240 kg N ha−1. This range of rates represents 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200% of the recommended rate (OMAFRA 2010). Foliar Ca was applied to each of these treatments every week, starting 1 or 2 d prior to inoculation (described below) at 1.9 kg Ca ha−1 as CaCl2 (Dowflake Xtra, Dow Chemical Canada Inc., Sarnia, ON). Treatments of 0 and 120 kg N ha−1 without Ca application were also examined. Finally, one treatment consisting of application of chlorothalonil (Bravo® 500, 50% a.i., Syngenta Crop Protection Canada, Inc., Guelph, ON) at 1.5 L a.i. ha−1 at 7- to 10-d intervals, was assessed in combination with the recommended application rates of N and Ca (120 kg N ha−1+Ca every week). This represents the standard calendar fungicide program for the region (OMAFRA 2010). Foliar CaCl2 and the fungicide were applied using a tractor-drawn plot sprayer with TeeJet D-3 hollow-cone nozzles at 690 kPa in 500 L ha−1 of water, starting 1–2 d prior to inoculation. Five applications of fungicide and Ca were made in 2004 and 2008, and seven applications were made in 2005.\n\nThe processing celery cultivar ‘Sabroso’ and the fresh market cultivar ‘Florida 683’ were selected for the study. Seedlings were hand transplanted on 2004 Jun. 28, 2005 Jun. 22 and 2008 Jun. 26. In 2004, in-row plant spacing was 18 cm for ‘Florida 683’ and 22 cm for ‘Sabrosos’. In 2005 and 2008, the in-row spacing was 22 cm for ‘Florida 683’ and 18 cm for ‘Sabroso’ because the cultivars were mislabelled at seeding. Plant spacing in celery depends on the end use of the crop for either fresh market or processing. Fresh market cultivars are harvested, packed in containers and graded based on the number of plants (24s, 30s, and 48s) per container. Processing celery is harvested and chopped for processing products where taller and larger celery are desired and hence the need for wider spacing between plants.\n\nTo ensure the onset of disease, the trials were inoculated on 2004 Aug. 20, 2005 Aug. 11 and 2008 Aug. 11. Inoculum was prepared from celery plants with actively growing S. apiicola lesions by hand chopping fresh foliage into 1–3 cm3 pieces, mixing the pieces with well water, and soaking for 2 h to release the conidia (approximately one part foliage to three parts water). The tissue and water suspension was spread as evenly as possible between the outside rows of adjacent plots, so that one row of each subplot adjacent to the assessment rows was inoculated. Inoculation of the outside rows was designed to allow for natural spread of inoculum to the assessment rows, which were the middle row of each sub-plot. The study area was irrigated following inoculation in 2004 to promote disease development, but no irrigation was required in 2005 and 2008. Late blight developed in rows adjacent to inoculated rows following inoculation, and disease symptoms were observed in the assessment rows 2–3 wk after inoculation.\n\nLate blight severity was assessed using a 0–9 scale, where: 0=0%; 1<2% of foliar area with blight symptoms; 2=2–4%, 3=5–9%; 4=10–25%; 5=26–40%, 6=41–55%, 7=56–70%, 8=71–85% and 9>85% foliar area diseased. Each rating was a visual assessment of all the plants in the middle row of each replicate plot and was assessed one or two times per week following inoculation for 5 to 6 wk. These values were used to calculate the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) using the following equation:\n\nwhere y j is the late blight severity rating at day t j, y j+1 is the late blight severity rating at day t j+1 and (t j+1 – t j) is the number of days between two assessments (Shanner and Finney 1977).\n\nTo measure plant nutrient status, plant tissue samples consisting of the most recently mature leaf and petiole from five plants in each subplot were taken at harvest. The plant tissue was dried at 70–80°C and sent to A & L Laboratories Canada Inc. (London, ON) for nutritional analysis. At harvest, 12 plants from each replicate were weighed, then trimmed, and weighed again. The fresh market celery cv. ‘Florida 683’ was trimmed to 40 cm height and the processing type celery cv. ‘Sabroso’ was trimmed to 55 cm to reflect standard commercial production of these celery types. After trimming, the leaves were rated visually for late blight symptoms on a scale from 0 to 5: 0=no lesions on leaves, 1=<10% leaf area with symptoms 2=10–25%, 3=26–50%, 4=51–75%, and 5=>75% leaf area with symptoms. Also, 10 outer petioles from each of the 12 trimmed plants were removed and rated on a scale from 0–5 (as described above). A leaf blight index (LBI) and petiole disease severity index (DSI) were calculated from these ratings using the equation of Kobriger and Hagedorn (1983). To determine marketable yield, diseased petioles were removed and plants were weighed at both sites in 2008.\n\nA mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) for a split-plot design was performed using SAS (Proc Mixed. version 9.3, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) to assess the effect of the treatments: N rates Ca fertilization and fungicide, on late blight and yield of celery cultivars ‘Sabroso’ and ‘Florida 683’. Cultivar and fertilizer treatment (rate of N, application of Ca, and fungicide) were fixed factors, and site-year, block and their interactions were random factors. There was an interaction between site-year and cultivar, so the data were analysed separately for each site-year. Orthogonal single-degree-of-freedom contrasts in ANOVA were used to describe the pattern (linear, quadratic) of response to rate of N after the fungicide treatment and the treatments that received no Ca were removed from the analysis. Regression was used to quantify the relationships where the contrasts were significant (P≤0.05). Contrasts within ANOVA were also used to assess the impact of Ca (0 kg ha−1 N vs. 0 kg ha−1 N+1.9 kg ha−1 Ca); (120 kg ha−1 N vs. 120 kg ha−1 N+1.9 kg ha−1 Ca) and fungicide application (120 kg ha−1 N vs. 120 kg ha−1 N+fungicide). Correlation analysis was also used to assess the relationships between disease and yield parameters. The treatments of 120 kg ha−1 N+1.9 kg ha−1 Ca+fungicide, and 120 kg ha−1 N with no Ca were not included in regression and correlation analyses to avoid false significance related to fungicide effects or lack of calcium. Correlation analysis was also used to determine relationships between tissue concentrations of nutrients and disease and yield parameters.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSeptoria late blight developed each year on the assessment rows, beginning 2–3 wk after inoculation. Disease pressure was lower in 2005 than in 2004 or 2008 (Fig. 1). Late blight was slightly but consistently more severe on the fresh market cultivar ‘Florida 683’ than the processing cultivar ‘Sabroso’ for each disease response variable (Table 1). For example, mean DSI values on petioles across all 4 site-years were 49 DSI for ‘Florida 683’ and 45 DSI for ‘Sabroso’. There was a cultivar×site-year interaction for each of the disease response variables. However, the cultivars exhibited a similar response to treatment and there was no cultivar×fertilizer treatment interaction, so only mean values for cultivar are presented. Application of Ca did not affect late blight severity, based on contrasts in ANOVA of select N rates with and without Ca (data not shown). As expected, repeated application of chlorothalonil fungicide consistently reduced late blight severity on leaves and petioles (Table 2).\n\nFig. 1.\n\nTable 1.\n\nTable 2.\n\nThe rate of N occasionally had a small effect on late blight severity, but results varied across site-years. Late blight severity (LBI, AUDPC) declined slightly (linear response, Fig. 1) with increasing rate of N at the lower OM site in 2008, but had little or no effect in the other 3 site-years. There was a reduction in AUDPC as N rate increased in the high OM site in 2008, but the overall change in disease was very small. Although not significant, DSI on petioles exhibited a similar pattern of response to N rate.\n\nAs expected, plants of ‘Sabroso’ were generally taller than those of ‘Florida 683’ and yielded slightly more in 2004, but this pattern was not consistent across site-years, which was associated with the in-row spacing of the plants (Table 1). However, the cultivars exhibited a similar response to fertilizer treatment and there was no cultivar×fertilizer interaction, so only mean values for cultivar are presented. Application of Ca did not have an effect on yield, based on contrasts of N with and without Ca (data not shown). Little or no blackheart was observed in any treatments, which indicates that soil moisture was adequate in each the trials. Repeated application of chlorothalonil fungicide consistently increased harvest weight in 2005 and marketable yield, when it was measured in 2008 (Table 2).\n\nYield response to N rate was not consistent across site-years, which produced complex interactions for plant height, harvest weight and marketable yield (Fig. 2). Where present, the response was modest and quadratic (based on single-df contrasts in ANOVA). There was no response to added N at the High OM sites. Increasing rates of N resulted in an increase in plant height and harvest weight at the Low OM sites in both 2005 and 2008. In 2005, the lowest harvest weight was observed on treatments that did not receive Ca application, even when 100% of the recommended N rate was applied (1.06 kg vs. 1.43 kg plant−1). Marketable yield increased at both sites in 2008, but the maximum yield was achieved at 120 kg N ha−1at the High OM site and at 240 kg N ha−1at the Low OM site (Fig. 2C). Marketable yield was correlated to harvest weight at each site (r=0.7; P<0.01).\n\nFig. 2.\n\nThe relationship between yield and Septoria late blight was not consistent across site-years. Plant height and harvest weight were negatively correlated with AUDPC, DSI and LBI for both cultivars in 2004 and for ‘Sabroso’ at the Low OM site in 2008. Marketable yield was negatively correlated with AUDPC, DSI and LBI for both cultivars at the Low OM site in 2008 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3.\n\nTissue N concentrations varied among treatments in the Low OM sites but not in the High OM sites (Table 4). Application of N increased the N tissue concentration by 0.6–1.5%. The fertilizer treatments generally had no effect on tissue concentrations of Ca (mean of 1.6%). The Ca tissue concentration fell within the sufficiency range for newly matured leaves (0.6–3.0% Ca, Mills and Jones 1996) at each sampling date.\n\nTable 4.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that N application reduced the severity of leaf blight of carrots and early blight in celery (Burdine and Thayer 1960; Westerveld et al. 2008). In the current study, N application reduced Septoria late blight of celery at a muck soil site with relatively low organic matter (40–50%, Low OM) in 2008, but had little or no effect at sites with higher OM content (60–70%, High OM) in 2004 and 2008 or the low OM site in 2005. Tissue N concentrations varied among treatments in 2005 and at the Low OM site in 2008, but not in 2004 or at the High OM site in 2008. Mineral nutrients generally affect disease levels by moving the crop from nutrient deficiency to sufficiency (Huber and Haneklaus 2007), so that plants are able to respond more quickly and effectively to pathogen infection and colonization. The small, inconsistent effect of N application on Septoria late blight may be associated with the high constitutive N levels in these muck soils, since unfertilized crops in these rich soils do not experience substantial N deficiency. Celery height and yield were negatively correlated with Septoria late blight severity, primarily at the Low OM sites, which further supports the argument that plants with sufficient N can respond faster or more effectively to reduce the effects of infection. Disease severity varied slightly between the cultivars, but cultivar response to N rate was similar.\n\nAt the sites with a relatively low OM content, plant height and harvest weight and marketable yield (2008 only) increased slightly with increasing rates of N. This is consistent with previous reports of increases in quality and yield of celery with increased N (Masson et al. 1991; Evers et al. 1997; El-Sayed et al. 2011). At the High OM sites, increasing N had no effect on plant height or harvest weight, but increased marketable yield by 27% at rates up to 120 kg N ha−1. Plant height is an important yield parameter, especially for processing celery, where tall cultivars are preferred. The processing celery plants are trimmed to 55 cm height, which may have resulted in increased culls and reduced marketable yield if diseased plants were shorter than the standard trimming height. This indicates the need for N fertilization to sustain celery yield in fields with relatively lower OM content, even though the OM content of each of the soils assessed was much higher than for mineral soils. Soil tests to determine OM content could be a useful decision-making tool in determining the need to apply N fertilizer. This study confirmed that the recommended N rate for celery grown on muck soils (120 kg N ha−1, OMAFRA 2010) was sufficient to achieve high yield on High OM sites, but higher rates may be advantageous for Low OM sites. Nitrogen application rate had an effect on N tissue concentration at the Low OM sites, but not at the High OM sites. The lack of a response to N application at the High OM sites may have resulted from high constitutive soil N levels. Tissue concentration of N from treatments receiving N in the High OM sites did not differ from treatments where N was not applied. Nitrogen tissue concentrations were well above or in the sufficiency range of 2.5–3.5% for newly mature leaves (Mills and Jones 1996).\n\nApplication of foliar Ca fertilizer did not affect Septoria late blight severity in any site-year and increased harvest weight in only 1 of 4 site-years. This indicates that Ca application was not an important nutrient required for production of celery at these sites, as blackheart was not a problem in the trials. Application of foliar Ca fertilizer had no effect on the concentration of Ca in leaf tissue (data not shown). The lack of relationship between foliar Ca application and Ca tissue concentration may indicate that Ca was not absorbed into the leaf tissue from foliar application, and so had little or no effect on the nutrient status of the crop. Foliar application of Ca is only effective when the solution comes in direct contact with newly emerging leaf tissue (Padrossi et al. 1999). It was expected that the use of foliar Ca fertilizers for blackheart prevention (Buozo et al. 2007) may provide some disease management benefits when used in conjunction with a fungicide program. However, the fungitoxic effects of calcium on plant pathogens reported for other salts (McGuire and Kelman 1984; Mann et al. 2004) were not observed in this study.\n\nApplication of chlorothalonil fungicide consistently reduced Septoria late blight severity and increased marketable yield of celery and harvest weight (in only 1 of 4 site-years). Late blight lesions on the petioles of celery are not tolerated, so effective disease management is essential to produce a marketable crop. Fungicide application is required for management of late blight in most years.\n\nIn conclusion, tolerance for any level of disease on celery petioles is very low, and acceptable levels of disease management were not achieved using N and Ca fertilizers alone. Application of fertilizer did not replace fungicides for management of Septoria late blight. However, an increase in yield was observed with increasing rates of N application at the Low OM sites and with foliar Ca application in one season. Increasing rates of N application up to 120 kg ha−1 increased marketable yield at both a High OM site and a Low OM site.\n\nReferences\n\nBavaresco L. and Eibach R.
