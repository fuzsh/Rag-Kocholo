Therefore, this paper provides an update that <strong>in</strong>cludes synonyms, morphological descriptions, illustrations, host range, geographical distribution <strong>and</strong> literature related to the species. This will benefit mycologists, plant pathologists <strong>and</strong> quarant<strong>in</strong>e officials who need to study this group of fungi.

The genus is a destructive plant pathogen throughout the world. Members of this genus are nearly universally pathogenic, occurr<strong>in</strong>g on a wide range of hosts <strong>in</strong> almost all major families of dicotyledonous, most monocotyledonous fa- milies, some gymnosperms <strong>and</strong> ferns (Pollack, 1987). <strong>Cercospora</strong> species are commonly associated <strong>with</strong> leaf spots, but can also cause necrotic lesions on flowers, fruits, bracts, seeds <strong>and</strong> pedicels of numerous hosts <strong>in</strong> most climatic regions (Agrios 2005). In addition, several species of this genus are also known to be hyperparasites of other plant pathogenic fungi (Sh<strong>in</strong> & Kim 2001), <strong>and</strong> are employed as biocontrol agents of alien weeds (Morris & Crous 1994). 11"
