STRANDBERG, J. 0., and J. M. WHITE. 1978. Cercospora apii damage of celery-effects of plant spacing and growth on raised beds. Phytopathology 68:223-226. Damage caused by Cercospora apii on leaves and petioles acceptable disease control) average infection rates (r) ranged of celery (Apium graveolens var. dulce) was measured on from -0.13 to -0.15 throughout the fall season, and 0.17 to plants grown at different plant spacings on both flat soil and 0.23 in the spring season. Hours of leaf wetness and disease on raised beds under conditions that simulated those in damage measured as percent leaf area infected or as numbers commercial production. Infection rates of Cercospora apii of diseased petioles per plant requiring removal at harvest were not affected either by plant spacing or by growth on time did not differ significantly among plant-spacing or bedraised beds.

Scherm\n\nEnvironmental Science\n\nExperimental evidence for the effectiveness of increasing the space between plants in container-grown azalea for suppression of Rhizoctonia web blight is lacking, and daily overhead irrigation and compact plant form likely contributed to the lack of effect of spacing on disease development.\n\nEffects of Plant Spacing and Cultivar on Incidence of Botrytis Fruit Rot in Annual Strawberry.\n\nD. LegardC. XiaoJ. MertelyC. Chandler\n\nAgricultural and Food Sciences\n\nThe effects of within-row plant spacing and cultivar on the incidence of Botrytis fruit rot (Botrytis cinerea) and marketable yield of annual strawberry were evaluated during the 1997-98 and 1998-99…\n\nEffects of single and multiple stressors on communities of wheat and wild oats\n\nT. Pfleeger\n\nEnvironmental Science\n\napproved: Christopher C. Mundt Most plant toxicology tests developed in support of environmental laws use a single stress applied to an individual plant. While tests using individual species or…\n\nEffect of temperature, wetness duration, and planting density on olive anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp.\n\nJ. MoralJosé Jurado-BelloM. Isabel SánchezRodrígues de OliveiraA. Trapero\n\nAgricultural and Food Sciences, Environmental Science\n\nIn the field, anthracnose epidemics progressed faster in a super-high-density planting than in the high-density plantings and caused severe epidemics in the super- high- density planting even with the moderately resistant Arbequina.\n\nCelery Diseases and their Management\n\nR. Raid\n\nAgricultural and Food Sciences\n\nThe most widespread and significant diseases of celery are described, along with recommended control measures, and blackheart and cracked stem, two common physiological disorders of Celery are also described.\n\nWheat leaf rust severity as affected by plant density and species proportion in simple communities of wheat and wild oats.\n\nT. PfleegerC. Mundt\n\nBiology, Environmental Science\n\nRegression parameters describing Wheat leaf rust severity as a function of wheat seeding density did not differ significantly between pure wheat stands and wheat-wild oat mixtures and, thus, failed to support an effect of wild oats on wheat leaf rust other than through its competitive impact on wheat tiller density.\n\nHost Density as a Factor in Plant Disease Ecology\n\nJ. BurdonG. Chilvers\n\nEnvironmental Science, Biology\n\nFew attempts have been made to isolate and quantify host density as a factor in disease even though many pathologists accept the axiom that growing plants in dense stands contributes to the development of severe epidemics."
