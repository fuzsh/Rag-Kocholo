        "text": "Hop - Humulus lupulus (Cannabaceae) - is an important and ancient, herbaceous, temperate, perennial crop. It is a vine which, although having other uses, is cultivated predominantly for the brewing industry (Laws 2013). Cultivation of hops in Brazil is relatively new and has increased in the last twenty years. There is only one published record of a fungal disease affecting hop in Brazil - powdery mildew (Fagherazzi et al 2021). In January 2021, leaf spots appeared on all eight hops plants ithe collection maintained in the Infectarium, a disease demonstration garden on the campus of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV), Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil (https://www.infectario.ufv.br/). Symptoms were small, sub-circular to irregular spots, up to 5 mm, with a whitish to grayish center, surrounded by a dark brown necrotic margin, followed by a narrow yellowish outer margin. Older lesions became larger, grayish-brown, coalesced leading to extensive necrosis and stem dieback. A sample was collected, dried in a plant press, and deposited in the Herbarium of UFV (Acc. No VIC 47534). A dematiaceous fungus was found sporulating in the center of the lesions, when examined with a dissecting microscope. Fungal structures were scraped with a scalpel, mounted in lactoglycerol and observed with a light microscope (Olympus BX51). A pure culture was obtained after conidia were transferred onto PDA plates with a sterile fine-pointed needle. A representative isolate was deposited in the culture collection of the UFV (COAD 3368). The fungus had the following morphology: conidiophores cylindrical, geniculate, proliferating sympodially, 53 to 380 µm × 3 to 6.5 µm, 3 to 15-septate, smooth, with thickened and dark conidial scars, brown; conidia acicular to filiform, 47 to 210 µm × 2.5 to 5 µm, 3 to 17-septate, thin‑walled, smooth, with thickened and dark hila, hyaline. This combination is typical of Cercospora apii sensu lato, as described by Crous and Braun (2003). Genomic DNA was extracted from a 7-day-old culture of COAD 3368 and three loci were PCR amplified, namely: actin (ACT), with 512-F and 783-R primers; calmodulin (CAL), using the primers 228F and 2Rd; and histone H3 gene (HIS3), with the primers CYLH3F and CYLH3R. PCR products were sequenced by Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea) and the resulting sequences were deposited in GenBank (OM677624, OM677625 and OM677626, respectively). A multilocus Bayesian phylogenetic grouped COAD 3368 with Cercospora 'sp. Q' (Groenewald et al. 2013). This is a yet unresolved species complex within C. apii. Six 6‑month‑old healthy hop plants (cv. Cascade) were sprayed with a COAD 3368 conidial suspension (105 conidia/ mL) whereas another group of six plants was sprayed with sterile distilled water, serving as controls. Plants were placed in a dew chamber for 5 days and then transferred to a greenhouse bench, where they were observed daily. Thirty days after inoculation, symptoms similar to those observed in the field had developed on all inoculated plants, whereas control plants remained healthy. The fungus growing on inoculated hops produced typical Cercospora conidiophores and conidia. Upon reisolation, pure cultures with the same morphology of COAD 3368 were obtained. There are no previous records of Cercospora 'sp. Q' on hops worldwide. Fungi in Cercospora 'sp. Q' are known to have a broad host-range. A previous record of Cercospora 'sp. Q' leaf spots was published from its observation on Dioscorea cayennensis in the Infectarium (Torres et al. 2016). Damage to the hop plants was severe and it is possible that Cercospora leaf spot will become an emerging threat to commercial hop plantations in Brazil."
