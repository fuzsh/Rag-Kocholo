Recognize the problem

Cercospora leaf is a fungal disease that commonly affects celery in Trinidad and Tobago. The leaves and stems may become affected. Small, yellow, round to irregular spots first appear on the leaves and stem. These spots do not have a border. These spots enlarge rapidly, turn brown and dry. Leaves with many spots eventually wither and die.

Background

Cercospora leaf spot needs to be identified early for control to be successful. The disease develops more quickly in overcrowded fields (plants spaced too closely) that are hot and humid. The fungus is spread in the field by wind, rain splash, overhead irrigation and field workers. The disease can live in crop remains. Unhealthy plants are more easily affected by this disease. Some varieties can withstand the disease. Fungicides can be used to manage this disease.

Management

•

Use disease-free seedlings.

•

Avoid using overhead sprinklers. Use drip-irrigation

•

Avoid overcrowding in the field.

•

Remove and destroy infected leaves.

•

Use a mulch such as plastic.

•

After the celery crop, replant with another crop, not with celery,

•

Use a fungicide such as tebuconazole and triadimenol or boscalid and pyraclostrobin or fenamidone and propamocarb or carbendazim at recommended rates. Spray every seven to 14 days depending on how badly the crop is affected by the disease

•

Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for the safe period of applying these fungicides before harvesting.

When using a pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval.
