There was a point of acceptance for me that everything happening is reality. It is like the person I married, 80 per cent of the time, is no longer there.\n\n“But the thing is this: when he was there, he was an incredible father to his children and an amazing husband. He was practically my best friend.”\n\nSilva said despite her husband’s health challenge, she has not stopped loving him.\n\n“The husband I knew is no longer there for me.
