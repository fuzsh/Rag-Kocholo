        "text": "Navigating toxic family dynamics as you grow up is like living in a soap opera, but without the commercial breaks. Your narcissistic mother is always berating your father, your sister acts like a teenager stuck in an adult's body and gets her only validation from TikTok, and your brothers can't prioritize their physical health or attain true independence from your parents. Another sister prefers to ignore painful issues or sweep them under the rug, and everyone‚Äôs walking on eggshells around each other‚Äôs moods‚Äîit‚Äôs a family circus, and you‚Äôre the reluctant ringmaster. But wait, there‚Äôs more! Despite all the drama, your family members have their redeeming qualities. Your mother, for all her faults, is always offering advice and wanting to help. Your father accepts people where they are and is gentle and affectionate. Your brothers have great wisdom and insights, and your sisters will always have your back when it counts, finding humor in the chaos. Of course, I‚Äôll admit I have my own quirks. Like trying to fix everyone, which comes with its own set of toxic dynamics‚Äîhello, manipulation and emotional repression! Not to mention, not taking care of myself first because I‚Äôm so focused on everyone else. And, and, and...the list goes on. As you mature, you realize that trying to fix your family is a fool‚Äôs errand. You start setting boundaries like a bouncer at an exclusive club‚Äîno emotional vampires allowed! Accepting your family for the lovable trainwrecks they are becomes your new superpower. You empathize with their chaos without getting sucked into it. It‚Äôs all about meeting them where they are, with a smirk and a sigh, knowing you can now assert your boundaries and still care for them without losing your sanity. The best part? You find the sweet spot of respecting yourself while showing up for your family when it matters. It‚Äôs like watching a car crash in slow motion‚Äîyou can‚Äôt look away, but at least now you‚Äôre safely behind the barrier. So, Cheers to surviving the family circus and coming out with your sense of humor intact! üòâ\n\nGeorge Carlin's wife died early in 2008 and George (a comedian) followed her, dying in July 2008. I find it interesting a comedian could write something so very eloquent and on point. He said: The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness. We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things. We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less. These are the times of fast food and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete. Remember to spend some time with your loved ones, because they\n\nA shout to the family \"black sheep\" that didn't get the invite this year, or worse, got the invite and are unable to avoid it. Here's a checklist (from: https://lnkd.in/eVrsV6Hc ): Signs that you were made to play the role of the ‚Äòblack sheep‚Äô - Your parents treated you differently when compared to the way they treat your other siblings. - You were criticised for the way you are, and being name-called as ‚Äòthe drama queen‚Äô, ‚Äòthe cry baby‚Äô, ‚Äòweirdo‚Äô, ‚Äòoverly sensitive‚Äô etc. - Your mistakes were blown out of proportion and/or punished disproportionately. - Your parents did not intervene or take notice when you were being bullied by others. - You always have the feeling that you ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt fit in‚Äù with your family, and you did not develop strong connections with them. - When you thrive, get stronger and more independent, you sense your family members‚Äô intent on bringing you down or dismissing your achievements. - You were being bullied by your siblings, or that they ‚Äòjokingly‚Äô mock you for your idiosyncrasy. - Name-calling- you were always ‚Äòthe weird one‚Äô, the ‚Äòwild card‚Äô, or ‚Äòthe trouble‚Äô. - Your family didn‚Äôt know who you truly are beyond the superficial, and have shown little interest in doing so. - You were constantly being criticised for your natural attributes; such as your artistic or sensitive temperament. https://lnkd.in/eMDzAtFt\n\nSOMETHING TO PONDER: George Carlin George Carlin's wife died early in 2008 and George followed her, dying in July 2008. It is ironic George Carlin - comedian of the 70's and 80's - could write something so very eloquent and so very appropriate.

A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete. Remember to spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent. Remember, to say, 'I love you' to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you. Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak! And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. George Carlin\n\nYesterday, I went to my sister-in-law's wedding. It was beautiful. Food was fantastic. Music for the reception was old school 90's R&B. Everyone was just finishing their plates and talking among themselves, so the floor in front of them was empty. My wife was sitting beside me and said, \"I want to dance.\" My first thought was sure baby, let me slide out of your way...ohh you mean together! In front of everyone. My second thought was remembering when I was afraid of that kind of attention. I had social anxiety for most of my life. I remember not wanting to stand in front of the class to talk, let alone dance. Most of my dancing was at home in my room alone. My third thought... (All of this is happening in a couple seconds. It's amazing how fast we can think through things.) ...was wow, I remember when this used to scare me. I felt a brief compassion for the old me. Then I felt excited to create this experience with my wife. Sure, let's do it! - I took her hand. - Lead her to the dance floor. - We danced together as much as a pregnant woman and her husband could. - She looked absolutely gorgeous - I had a ton of fun. ________ How to dance in front of Everyone 1. You're safe. You don't need to blend in with the crowd to survive. 2. What experience do you want to create? 3. Focus on that. 4. Have some compassion for the old you. 5. Go have fun! _____________ Find my writing helpful? Follow me to become immune to anxiety without years of therapy. üîÅ Share this if it could be helpful for someone you know.\n\nA STORY FOR MOTHER'S DAY (from BAD CALL chapter \"I'm a Daddy\") \"HERE WE ARE. The cops are upstairs. There must be eight or nine people crammed into this tiny apartment. Is there more than one room. It doesn‚Äôt seem like it. Everyone is speaking in Spanish, all at the same time, and much too fast for me but not for Jose. He says they want to know if we‚Äôre going to take them to St. John‚Äôs or Elmhurst General. St. John‚Äôs. Good, they like that. If they‚Äôre happy, we‚Äôre happy. But for the moment, nobody‚Äôs going anywhere. This baby is ready to be born. The contractions are less than a minute apart, Mom is dilated more than ten centimeters, and now we cannot move her from the small sofa she‚Äôs on until it‚Äôs all over. --- It is suffocating in this apartment with everyone crowded around sweating and using up the air. But nobody wants to leave. It‚Äôs also really dark. There‚Äôs no light other than a single bulb in the center of the room. Who cares. This is an event. A blessed event, as they say. And who has the right to complain about anything anyway, when it‚Äôs the mother who‚Äôs doing all the work‚Äîand feeling every minute of it. Jose is asking Mom how many other ni√±os she has, and it turns out there are cuatro. He looks at me and winks. What does that mean. Does it mean he thinks this one should be easy. If he does, why not tell that to Mom. Somehow, I don‚Äôt think he will. We‚Äôre basically just standing by, with Jose occasionally coaching the mother with a few well-timed empujes and buenos. The baby is crowning. And here it comes. In the blink of an eye, out she pops. A little girl. Nobody has to tickle her feet to get her breathing. She‚Äôs yowling like a lion cub. --- Well, that‚Äôs that. Everything that is happening now is an anticlimax. Don‚Äôt misunderstand‚Äîit‚Äôs all good. Actually, terrific. But it has gone off without a bit of trouble, and that‚Äôs just the way you want it. The way everybody wants it, especially Mom. And Jose, of course. And me, too. I feel so good that it went so well. Hell, I feel great. After all the miserable, heartbreaking, stomach-turning calls I‚Äôve been on, finally a happy one. I‚Äôm riding in the back with Mom and her new little one and little one‚Äôs actual papa. Has she picked out a name for her girl. She has. Her name will be Luz. Luz. One of my favorite names but one that doesn‚Äôt literally translate into English. It means light, of course, and you can‚Äôt give a kid a name like Light, unless you‚Äôre a hippie. Maybe Lucy, but it‚Äôs not the same. Luz is LUZ. So here we are. Luz, born in the dark. Mom, exhausted but happy. Dad, proud as he can be. And Jose, beaming at me like he was my father. You want a cure for feeling numb. I think I‚Äôve just discovered it.\"\n\n\"This process has its own reality TV show, ‚ÄúThe Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning.‚Äù Inspired by a best-selling book by Margareta Magnusson, 89, three Swedes traveled across the Atlantic to help Americans clean house ‚Äî and face death. ‚ÄúA loved one wishes to inherit nice things from you,‚Äù admonishes Magnusson in her book. ‚ÄúNot all things from you.‚Äù \"If you‚Äôre lucky enough to meet your material needs, then letting go of some of your stuff, or not buying it in the first place, can bring immediate benefits. Clutter is linked to stress and anxiety, even depression. Prioritizing relationships and experience over possessions has been proven to elevate our happiness. \"D√∂st√§dning, or Swedish death cleaning, isn‚Äôt about clearing out closets. It‚Äôs about rethinking your relationship with things. Rather than making do with less, it‚Äôs about getting more from the things that make you happy. \"Death cleaning happens to agree with scientists‚Äô understanding of our relationship with things and why we‚Äôre loath to part with them. Decades of research have shown that we subconsciously see our possessions as physical extensions of ourselves. Losing them feels like an amputation because in our minds it is. ‚ÄúWe are attached to our belongings because we identify with them,‚Äù says Amber Cushing, a researcher at University College Dublin who studies the role of digital possessions in people‚Äôs lives. \"This can veer into pathology such as hoarding. Belongings become so fused with a sense of self that people lose the ability to differentiate between, say, the value of saving a wedding ring or a candy wrapper. Instead of our possessions offering ‚Äúa vital receptacle for our memories and identities,‚Äù researchers say they become ‚Äúfortresses,‚Äù physical barriers to ward off feelings of insecurity and loneliness.\""
