        "text": "Celebrity marriages can fail due to intense public scrutiny fueled by a highly engaged media audience, the demanding careers of the couple, and the volume of time spent apart due to work commitments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stakes are almost always high, with vested interests putting a strain on the relationship.\n\nFame can lead to a lack of privacy while the pressures of maintaining a public image create unrealistic expectations.\n\nThe hedonistic tendencies of famed individuals can contribute to infidelity and make it difficult to sustain a marriage in the spotlight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria, traditional expectations and family pressures often conflict with the western modernity that celebrities embrace.\n\nIssues such as polygamy, financial disparities, and extended family obligations can complicate relationships.\n\nThis makes it difficult for some celebrity marriages to thrive while others come crashing in no time\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable looks at some celebrity marriages in Nigeria that have beaten the odds to last over twenty years.\n\nOlu Jacobs and Joke Silva\n\nThis celebrity couple has set the standard for many marriages as they have been married for 35 years.\n\nIt is believed that the couple met in 1981 at the National Theatre in Lagos.\n\nThis is a period that coincided with Nigeria’s 21st independence anniversary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey would tie the knot eight years later in 1989 and have two children.\n\nJacobs and Silva founded and co-operated the Lufodo Group, a media corporation that consists of film production, distribution assets, and an academy of performing arts.\n\nIn November 2021, Silva disclosed that Jacobs was battling dementia.\n\nPictures showed her husband had lost weight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSilva, in an interview, would open up on his deteriorating health and her struggles taking care of him.\n\nThrough the thick and thin, however, their bond remains strong.\n\nTunde and Wunmi Obe\n\nThey are fondly called T.W.O. and got married in 1998.\n\nThe Nigerian show business, music, and entrepreneurs couple met as undergraduates at the university.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTunde and Wumi burst into the entertainment scene with their regular appearances on The Charly Boy show.\n\nThey gained massive traction after the release of ‘Sealed’, their debut studio album, in 1999.\n\nHaving been married for 26 years, the couple have had three children.\n\nRMD and Jumobi Adegbesan\n\nRichard Mofe-Damijo tied the knot with his partner Jumobi on December 20, 2000.\n\nThis was after May Ellen-Ezekiel, the actor’s first wife, passed away in 1996.\n\nRMD and Jumobi have had four children together.\n\nSince she tied the knot with RMD, Jumobi, a popular TV presenter, has been absent from the media.\n\nIn September 2023, RMD revealed why actors struggle to remain faithful in marriage.\n\n“It is hard to be faithful in marriage because of the line of work we are in,” he said.\n\n“Every one of us that is married, we are the target. Look at how women are. How can you escape it?”\n\nOmotola Jalade- Ekeinde and Matthew Ekeinde\n\nWhen Omotola and Matthew tied the knot in 1996, brows were raised and heads turned because the actress was 18.\n\nNow 28 years later, their union is still waxing strong and has produced four children: Princess, M.J., Meraiah, and Michael.\n\nTheir marriage was tested in 2021 when rumours started circulating that Omotola was having an affair with Adams Oshiomhole, the politician.\n\nThe actress however denied the claims and challenged those who insinuated the affair to provide proof for their allegations.\n\nGloria and Nobert Young\n\nGloria and Nobert‘s marriage is proof that celebrity marriages can work.\n\nThe couple, notable for their roles in different movies, has been married since 2002 and has three children.\n\nIn an interview with TheCable, Norbert opened up about his views on infidelity as an actor.\n\n“If you are not disciplined, you will fall easily into temptations,” he said.\n\n“There is temptation everywhere but your commitment to your job, marriage, and partner will help you to see it through.\n\n“You will be exposed to a lot of people in your everyday life.\n\n“If you are committed to your relationship, you will know how to handle yourself.”\n\nOmoni and Nnamdi Oboli\n\nThe 10-year age difference between the couple has not stopped their love from blossoming.\n\nTheir marriage is among those that have stood the test of time.\n\nOmoni and Nnamdi walked down the aisle on October 28, 2000.\n\nThey remain married almost 24 years later.\n\nThe union has been blessed with three children namely Gozi, Chizi, and Tobe.\n\nThe couple have also co-produced several hit movies together.\n\nThey include ‘Being Mrs Elliott’ and ‘Render to Ceasar’.\n\nTony and Ogo Umez\n\nThe ace Nollywood actor and his wife have been married since 1999 and have four children together.\n\nIt is believed that the couple met on the set of a movie.\n\nThey recently celebrated their 24th wedding anniversary while showering econium on each other and expressing their unwavering love for each other.\n\nPeju Ogunmola and Sunday Omobolanle (Papi Luwe)\n\nThe marriage between the two prominent Yoruba actors in 1989 caused quite a stir.\n\nThis was because Luwe was already married with three children and Peju was just 23 at the time.\n\nHowever, the celebrity couple remained married 35 years later.\n\nTope and Soji Alabi\n\nSoji and Tope tied the knot in 2000 and have remained steadfast in their love for each other.\n\nAlmost 24 years later, the couple have remained married and Soji also doubles as his wife’s manager and music producer.\n\nHe is the also chief executive of Gospel Vibes Limited, the management to which his wife is signed.\n\nFrancis and Adokiye Duru\n\nAce actor Francis Duru walked down the aisle with Adokiye, his wife, on May 31, 2003.\n\nThe couple met as undergraduates at the University of Port-Harcourt, Rivers state.\n\nAfter 21 years, their union is still strong.
