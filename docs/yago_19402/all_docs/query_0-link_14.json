        "text": "Olu Jacobs, a veteran movie actor, has turned 82, two weeks after he was reported dead on social media.\n\nHis actress wife, Ajoke Silva, took to the photo and video sharing platform to write a tribute to him in honor of the milestone.\n\nJoke Silva posted a video on Instagram in the early hours of Thursday, July 11, capturing her husband in both his youth as well as newer version. In the video, he is also seen admiring his housecoat.\n\nJoke Silva prayed ecstatically for her husband‚Äôs continued good health. She wrote this:\n\n‚Äú82 just like that. Agba ko ni nira l‚Äôagbara Jesu‚Ä¶Happy birthday and have an amazing year ahead me darling‚Ä¶ Sir J of life üòâ @_olujacobs (loving his customized house coat ‚Ä¶thanks a mill @thegardentheatre Tosin Otudeko).‚Äù\n\nOn June 30, Olu Jacobs was reported dead on social media.\n\nHowever, the family shared videos debunking the allegation.\n\nThat was the second time speculations regarding the death of the renowned Nigerian actor and film executive, whose true name is Oludotun Baiyewu Jacobs, circulated on social media.\n\nRumours circulated on social media in August 2022 that Olu Jacobs had died.\n\nIn response to the news, Silva turned to Instagram to refute such stories and falsehoods, stating that her husband is alive and well.\n\nShe went on to take legal action against those spreading fake news about Jacobs‚Äô death.\n\nOlu Jacobs has taken a break from the movie and public scene due to his rapidly deteriorating health. The actor is suffering from Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), also known as Lewy body dementia, which is one of the most common varieties of dementia, according to the UK NHS.\n\nOlu Jacobs, affectionately known as Uncle Olu by his colleagues and many admirers, has built a name for himself in Nigeria‚Äôs film industry."
