        "text": "Veteran Nollywood actor, Olu Jacobs, has refuted claims that he snatched his wife of many years, Joke Silva, from another man\n\nThe actor, while speaking with Sun, said he struggled to get his wife and never snatched her from anyone as claimed in some quarters.\n\nHe said, âThat is very wrong. I was invited to come and do a play in Nigeria by the National Theatre. I was living in England at that time. I was to play lead in Wole Soyinkaâs The Trials of Brother Jero. We were having the production when the door opened and this lady walked in and said sorry, we are ready.\n\n“When she walked in, âI said excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, this is the lady I am going to marry.â You know bodies can attract and bodies can repel. I saw her and I was attracted.\n\n“I am not an impulsive person. I did not just say come. I had to struggle to get her. She was stunned even though she gave me up and down.\n\nWhen asked on high rate of divorce in Nollwood, Olu Jacobs said it is not unique to the acting profession, adding that people tend to know more about actorsâ failed marriages because they are in the public.\n\nAccording to him, tenderness, patience, grace of God and friendship are the secrets to a successful marriage\n\nâNo, quite frankly, let me tell you what. I donât encourage people to think that way. It is virtually in all professions, in all offices wherever you have women and men together.\n\n“Even if you donât hear it, we have a lot of divorces in all other sectors. For the fact that you donât hear it in other sectors like banking or in the oil sector, as oily as it is, does not mean it is not happening. It is in all offices where we have men and women.\n\n“Tenderness, patience, grace of God and friendship are the secrets to a successful marriage,” he added"
