        "text": "Veteran nollywood actress, Joke Silva has surprised all who think her marriage to Olu Jacob has no challenges. Just recently, the amazing couple celebrated their 33rd wedding anniversary.\n\nIn her words; \"It happened a lot. I recall a particular incident that happened when we just had our first baby. It turned out to be a learning curve for me. Olu had just come back from set apparently what happened was that he was still in that character that he had just played on set.\n\nSo we were just talking and he just started shouting and I was like, “Is it me you are talking to? Do you think I don’t have a father?”\n\nSo I packed my clothes with the drawer and I dumped it in my car, carried my baby and I remember our landlady lived at the back of our compound. So, she came out and started shouting, “Joke, where are you going to?’’ I told her I was going to my father’s house.\n\nWhen I got home the first person I see is my mum and she said what are you doing here? I began ranting and she said you don’t have a house or a room here, you better pack your bags and go home.\n\nMy father sort of understood where I was coming from. Funnily, my husband called and asked, “When are you coming home?” That was the first time and I did it a couple of other times. #Gossip #Trending"
