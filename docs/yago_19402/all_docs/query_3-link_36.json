        "text": "Ace Nigerian actress, Joke Silva, says she has reached a “place of acceptance” with respect to the ailment Olu Jacobs, her husband, is battling.\n\nIn November 2021, the award-winning movie star revealed that Jacobs was battling dementia after pictures showed her husband had lost weight.\n\nThe ace actress also said Jacobs has been struggling with the ailment “for a couple of years” and “doesn’t understand what is going on.”\n\nIn the latest episode of Mercy’s Menu, Mercy Johnson asked Joke how she has been able to cope with her husband’s health condition.\n\nThe ace movie star told Mercy that at some point, she committed Jacobs’ health to God in prayers and also adopted traditional medicines but realised his symptoms were getting worse.\n\nShe added that the moment she accepted that “this is my new reality,” coping with Jacobs’ condition became “so much easier.”\n\n“I think for me, it was getting to the place of acceptance. Sometimes when a partner starts exhibiting some things, there will be the religious side… all these prayers and things,” she said.\n\n“There are also other sides that say if you use all these natural herbs and the natural this and the organic that, and you’re doing everything that you’re being told to do and there is no change. It is almost as if the patient is getting worse.\n\n“But when you get to the stage of acceptance that this is your new reality, honestly it is so much easier. You realize this is the new season, you’re walking with your partner and you meet them where they are. It’s so much easier.”\n\nJoke also debunked Jacobs’ death rumours on several occasions.\n\nWatch the video below:"
