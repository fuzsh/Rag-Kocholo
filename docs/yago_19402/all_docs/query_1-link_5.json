        "text": "Veteran Nollywood actress, Joke Silva and her husband, Olu Jacobs, have always been described as ‘Power Couples’ who have made many thespians and fans to gush and applaud them for how they have espoused good and worthy examples of celebrity couples.\n\nDecades down the line, ill health and rumours of death have been labelled at the veteran actor, Olu Jacobs who was one of the first Nigerian actors that featured in Hollywood / American production like ‘,Ashanti’\n\nIn a recent interview with another media personality and actress Nancy Isime, Nollywood veteran, Joke Silva spoke on the health challenges of her thespian husband, Olu Jacobs.\n\nJoke Silva gave an update on her husband’s health.\n\nRecall that the star actor, Olu Jacobs, has been battling dementia for some time.\n\nSilva spoke on the health challenges of her thespian husband in an interview with another media personality and actress Nancy Isime.\n\nShe said her husband’s poor health had changed him significantly, adding that Olu Jacobs is no longer the man she walked down the aisle with 37 years ago.\n\n“It hasn’t been easy. There was a point of acceptance for me that everything happening is reality. It is like the person I married, 80 per cent of the time, is no longer there.\n\n“But the thing is this: when he was there, he was an incredible father to his children and an amazing husband. He was practically my best friend.”\n\nSilva said despite her husband’s health challenge, she has not stopped loving him.\n\n“The husband I knew is no longer there for me. This man that is here is someone I still love, but love in a different way,” she said."
