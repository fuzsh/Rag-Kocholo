There was a point of acceptance for me that everything happening is reality and it is like the person I married, 80 percent of the time is no longer there.\n\nâBut the thing is this, when he was there, he was an incredible father to his children and an amazing husband, he was practically my best friend.\n\nâThe husband I knew is no longer there for me, but this man that is here is someone I still love.â"
