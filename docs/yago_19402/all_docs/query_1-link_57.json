Agba ko ni nira l’agbara Jesu. Happy birthday and have an amazing year ahead, my darling… Sir J of life, @olujacobs (loving his customized housecoat).”\n\nThe video showed Jacobs looking hale and hearty, debunking the previous rumours of his passing.\n\nThe post has since garnered congratulatory messages from celebrities and fans alike.\n\nOmotola Jalade-Ekeinde commented: “Happy birthday to a legend, a father to the industry, an outstanding actor, an incredible soul.”\n\nOsas Ighodaro wrote: “Happy Birthday, legend! God bless you immensely.” Chioma Akpotha also chimed in: “A living legend! Happy birthday, sir.
