        "text": "Nigerian actor (born 1942)\n\nOludotun Baiyewu Jacobs, Listenⓘ (born 11 July 1942), known professionally as Olu Jacobs, is a veteran Nigerian actor and film executive.[1] He began his career starring in several British television series and international films.[2] Vanguard described him as one of the \"godfathers of Nollywood\", along with Pete Edochie.[3][4][5] Trained at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, England, Olu Jacobs worked with various repertoire theatres in Britain and starred in some international movies.\n\nIn 2007, Jacobs won the Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.[6][7][8][9] He received the Industry Merit Award for outstanding achievements in acting at the 2013 Africa Magic Viewers' Choice Awards and the MAA Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nOludotun Baiyewu Jacobs was born to parents from Egba Alake. He spent his early childhood in Kano[10] and attended Holy Trinity School where he was a member of the debating and drama societies.[11] He was inspired to take a chance with acting when he attended one of Chief Hubert Ogunde's annual concert party at Colonial Hotel in Kano.[10] Afterwards, he secured a visa and travelled to England to study acting.[12]\n\nIn England, Jacobs trained at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. One of his earliest stage roles was to play the part of The Boy in 'A Taste of Honey' at the newly opened Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, in 1972. He then appeared in various British television shows and series in the 1970s (including The Goodies, Till Death Us Do Part, Barlow at Large, The Venturers, Angels, 1990, The Tomorrow People and The Professionals).[13] In 1978, he played the role of President Mageeba in Michael Codron's presentation of Sir Tom Stoppard's play Night and Day.\n\nIn the 1980s, Jacobs appeared in several international films, including John Irvin's war film The Dogs of War, Roman Polanski's adventure-comedy Pirates (1986) and the family-adventure film Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend (1985). On television, he was a cast member in TVS's The Witches and the Grinnygog.[14] In 1990, upon his return to Nigeria, he starred in the NTA detective series The Third Eye.[15]\n\nJacobs has subsequently starred in over 120 Nollywood films and is considered one of the top Nigerian Nollywood actors.[3] He has also appeared in television commercials for food companyRibena and electronic giant, Binatone.[16]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nJacobs has been married to fellow Nollywood actor Joke Silva since 1989. They have two children.[17] Asked why his wife still bears her maiden name, Jacobs answered: \"She is her own individual. When I met her, she was an actress known as Joke Silva; so why should marrying me now deny her and her audience her name. She is Miss Joke Silva who is Mrs. Joke Jacobs. It is as simple as that. People began to say what they like. They have even written that we are separated and all sorts of stuff. When she was working, she is Joke Silva and as well as Mrs. Joke Jacobs at home.\"[18] The couple founded and operate the Lufodo Group, a media corporation that consists of film production, distribution assets and the Lufodo Academy of Performing Arts.\n\nRumours that Jacob had died circulated in 2021, until he attended Afriff in November 2021 where he was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award.[19] His wife Silva later revealed in an interview with Chude Jideonwo that he is battling Dementia with Lewy bodies.[20]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nOlu Jacobs was honoured with the Industry Merit Award for outstanding achievements in acting at the 2013 Africa Magic Viewers' Choice Awards.[21]\n\nIn August 2022, he was presented an icon award and a membership certificate along with his wife by Audio-Visual Rights Society of Nigeria (AVRS) [22][23]\n\nStage (selected)\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Show Role Notes 1971 Murderous Angels: A Political Tragedy and Comedy in Black and White (play) Written by Conor Cruise O'Brien and performed at the Dublin Theatre Festival in 1971 1972 Richard's Cork Leg Royal Court Theatre, London 1974 Black Mans Country Father Zachary Azuka Gate Theatre 1977 Julius Caesar One of the augerers Royal National Theater 1977 presentation directed by John Schlesinger 1976 Bar Beach Prelude and Transistor Radio Two shorts play adapted from the works of Bode Sowande and Ken Saro Wiwa 1976 A Kind of Marriage Obi Centre Play 1977 Old Movies Chris Hunter (gendarmes) National Theatre presentation 1978 Night and Day President Mageeba Phoenix Theatre (London)\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1979 Ashanti Commissioner Batak [24] 1980 The Dogs of War Customs Officer [25] 1985 Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend Col.
