        "text": "Veteran Nollywood actress, Joke Silva has broken her silence on rumours going round on social media that her husband, Olu Jacobs is dead.\n\nThis is the second time rumours about the death of The ace Nigerian actor and film executive, whose real name is Oludotun Baiyewu Jacobs, will be making rounds on social media.\n\nSpeaking with TheNEWS and PMNEWS this evening, his wife, Joke, debunked the rumour, saying “her husband is alive and doing just fine.”\n\nAbout Olu Jacobs\n\nFondly called Uncle Olu by his colleagues and teeming admirers, Olu Jacobs has made his mark in the Nigeria’s movie industry.\n\nWith more than 40 years acting experience under his belt, Jacobs is seen as a bridge between the old and new breed of actors.\n\nTrained at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, England, Jacobs remains one of Africa’s creative gifts to the world, having worked with various repertoire theatres in Britain and starred in some international movies.\n\nIn 2007 he won the African Movie Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Olu Jacobs has distinguished himself as a godfather in Nollywood, paving a successful path for many emerging actors and actresses in the industry. His love for acting was inspired by the late legendary film maker, Hubert Ogunde’s annual concert party which held at Colonial Hotel in Kano.\n\nThereafter, he travelled to England where he studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. He has been described as ‘one of Nollywood’s finest actors, best role interpreter and the best manipulator of words’.\n\nFor his dedication to his acting career spanning over five decades, he was honoured with the Industry Merit Award for outstanding achievements in acting at the 2013 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards.’ Also, AMAA conferred its Lifetime Achievement Awards on him in 2016.\n\nOlu Jacobs is married to veteran actress Joke Silva. The couple founded and operate the Lufodo Group, a media corporation that consists of film production, distribution assets and the Lufodo Academy of Performing Arts.\n\nIn England, he trained at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.\n\nHe then starred in various British television shows and series in the 1970s (e.g. The Goodies, Till Death Do Us Part, Barlow at Large, The Venturers, Angels, 1990, The Tomorrow People, The Professionals). In 1978, he played the role of President Mageeba in Michael Codron’s presentation of Sir Tom Stoppard’s play Night and Day.\n\nIn the 1980s Jacobs starred in several international films some of which include John Irvin’s war film The Dogs of War, Roman Polanski’s adventure-comedy Pirates (1986) and the family-adventure film Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend (1985). On television he was a cast member in TVS’s The Witches and the Grinnygog.\n\nJacobs has subsequently starred in over 120 Nollywood films. He is considered one of the top Nigerian Nollywood actors.”"
