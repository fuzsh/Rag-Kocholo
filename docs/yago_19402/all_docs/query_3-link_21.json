        "text": "\"The first time it happened.\"\n\nIn the entirety of Nollywood, there are few if not no other celebrity couple that are as respected as Olu Jacobs and Joke Silva. Their love story has spanned 35 years and counting. In that amount of time, there surely had to be problems that came up, fights and quarrels that happened. But was there any time that it got too much and Joke just wanted to leave? Absolutely yes!\n\nI know, it’s very surprising. For such a highly praised and celebrated couple, even they go through rough patches and today, I’ll be sharing with you the story that Joke Silva told about the day she almost left her marriage as well as lessons she’s learned after years of being married to Olu Jacobs.\n\nAre you ready to read this story? Then let’s go!\n\n**Before reading on, please make sure to like and follow my Facebook page so you don't miss out on any new and interesting lists, articles, and stories that I post every single day. I have a really fun page. If you like my page, you will have fun too. So what's stopping you? Like my page and let's have fun together!\n\nPremium Times got in touch with actress Joke Silva to do an interview about her marriage as well as tips she can pass down to us and it was quite the interesting read, I just had to share it with you. Here are the highlights!\n\nWhen asked: How would you describe your marriage journey so far? Joke said:\n\nThe journey has been incredible and extremely interesting. It has also been one of learning. I don’t think anybody can ever prepare anyone for marriage. I had friends who were married until one partner died or death did them part and well over 40 years we’re each other’s friends. They had their challenges and they weathered the storm. Those were my role models. Knowing full well that there will be storm, I soon realized that my storms were totally different from their own storms. I wasn’t prepared for my own storms.\n\nJoke was then asked during the interview if there were any times she was ready to just give it all up, end the marriage, and not mind the consequences – and surprisingly, she said yes. In fact, she said it happened a couple of times. Speaking of the day it happened, Joke said:\n\nIt happened a lot. I recall a particular incident that happened when we just had our first a baby. It turned out to be a learning curve for me. Olu had just come back from set apparently what happened was that he was still in that character that he had just played on set. So we were just talking and he just started shouting and I was like, “Is it me you are talking to? Do you think I don’t have a father?” So I packed my clothes with the drawer and I dumped it in my car, carried my baby and I remember our landlady lived at the back of our compound. So, she came out and started shouting, “Joke, where are you going to?’’ I told her I was going to my father’s house. When I got home the first person I see is my mum and she said what are you doing here? I began ranting and she said you don’t have a house or a room here, you better pack your bags and go home. My father sort of understood where I was coming from. Funnily, my husband called and asked, “When are you coming home?” That was the first time and I did it a couple of other times.”\n\nFinally, Joke was asked to impart some wisdom on we young ones about tips and lessons she’s learnt from marriage. She said:\n\nWhen my own storms too came, it was also a learning curve for both sides (my husband and I), we both had to learn to forgive each other. I learnt that marriage is not a destination; it’s a continuous journey, and somehow, it seems like the enemy knows that, so he says, “So, you weathered this storm, let me throw another one, let me see whether you will weather this one.”\n\nBut, I think when you know the person you are married to, when you like the person you are in relationship with, when you do have respect for each other, you learn. At least for me, for my husband, he was always wanting what was best for me. I had to also learn what was best for him but I finally got. It differs from person to person and it all depends on what your background is.\n\nMarriage is something that scares me. I know I’m not alone in this, for a lot of young people, marriage is scary. Why? Because of the fear that you could marry the wrong person who’ll turn your life into a living hell. The radical change in lifestyle is also scary and the whole thing is a lot to handle. It’s reassuring to know that even people who’ve been married for over 30 years still sometimes face doubts and fears and worries but still find a way to work it out. As Aunty Joke said, I truly think communication is what is the major key as well as a real desire for the best for the other person. I really enjoyed this interview with Joke Silva and I truly hope you enjoyed it too.\n\nThat’s All.\n\nI hope you’ve had fun.
