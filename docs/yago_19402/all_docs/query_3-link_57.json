In her message, she wished her husband a lifetime of fantastic years ahead of him and expressed her deep affection for him.\n\nChef Smith should have consulted me before attempting his cook-a-thon â€“ Dr. UN\n\nShe gave thanks to God for keeping her husband alive and favoring him enough to live another year in spite of his dementia battle.\n\nIn her post, Silva shared a collage of photos and videos of Olu Jacobs which showed him in good condition.\n\nIn one of the videos, Olu Jacobs was seen adorned in a customised gifted bath robe with smiles on his face.\n\nThis is coming after there have been death rumours about Olu Jacobs which have since been debunked by Joke Silva."
