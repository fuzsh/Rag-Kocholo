        "text": "Veteran Nollywood actress, Joke Silva, has refuted rumors circulating on social media about the death of her husband, legendary actor Olu Jacobs. In a response to an inquiry by Vanguard, Silva confirmed that her husband is alive and doing fine.\n\nThis is the second time in recent times that rumors of Jacobs’ death have surfaced, only to be debunked by the family. A close source to the family also confirmed that the actor was in good spirits and had spoken with the President of the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN) earlier in the day.\n\nAdditionally, associate of the family, Betty Irabor, and a broadcast by Channels TV, which featured an interview with Jacobs himself, further confirmed that he is alive and well. In the interview, Jacobs mentioned that he was preparing to visit the Ikoyi Club that evening.\n\nThis development puts to rest the rumors and speculation surrounding Jacobs’ health, and his fans can breathe a sigh of relief."
