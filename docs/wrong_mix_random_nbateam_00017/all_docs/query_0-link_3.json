        "text": "I'm so grateful to have been a UI artist for The Last Broadcast last year, I learned a lot and had fun collaborating with such a talented team. Special thanks to Mason Sabharwal for his excellent and detailed art direction and Collette Q. for being a wonderful creative director and leader. Thank you to everyone who helped bring The Last Broadcast to life!!\n\nHello friends, I'm happy to share that I will be joining Google this summer as a STEP Intern! I'm grateful to Hannahleis Stone for her guidance throughout the recruiting process and to my interviewers, mentors, and friends who made this possible. I can't wait to learn and grow alongside such a talented team. I don't usually post art here, but I also wanted to share my most recent digital painting, \"Toy Dragon\"! As my semester became busier and tougher, I found myself needing to take a step back and slow down. Painting this was a great way for me to do that, and seeing the improvement from my original piece in 2020 was really encouraging. Lastly, I want to reflect on my most challenging semester so far at USC. I'm so grateful for the friends who supported me through algorithms homework struggles, life struggles, and late-night drama binges. Thank you for being a part of my journey. üôá‚ôÄÔ∏è Sincerely, Michaela #google #painting #internship #softwaredeveloper"
