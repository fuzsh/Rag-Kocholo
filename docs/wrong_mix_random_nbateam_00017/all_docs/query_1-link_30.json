Professor Yano is a Fellow of both INFORMS and the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (formerly Institute of Industrial Engineers).\n\nMartin Grötschel, born in 1948, studied mathematics at U Bochum (1969-1973), received his PhD in economics (1977) and his habilitation in Operations Research (1981) at U Bonn. He was professor of applied mathematics at U Augsburg 1982-1991, professor of information technology at TU Berlin and vice president/president of the Zuse Institute for Information Technology Berlin (ZIB) 1991-2015. Grötschel was the President of the German Mathematical Society (DMV) 1993-1994, Secretary General of the International Mathematical Union (IMU) 2007-2014, President of the Berlin Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW) 2015-2020 and chaired the DFG Research Center MATHEON “Mathematics for Key Technologies” 2002-2008. He has held numerous further science administration and advisory positions. Grötschel’s main areas of research are discrete mathematics, optimization, and operations research. He has made, e.g., contributions to polyhedral combinatorics and to the development of methods proving the polynomial time solvability of optimization problems. He has also focused on the design of practically efficient algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems appearing in practice, such as the travelling salesman, the max-cut, the linear ordering, and various connectivity problems. Cutting plane algorithms for integer programming are among his favorites. The application areas include telecommunications, chip design, energy, production planning and control, logistics, and public transport. He has been an open access and open science activist and is currently involved in fostering digital humanities. Grötschel’s scientific achievements were honored with several distinctions including the Cantor Medal, the Leibniz, the Beckurts, the Dantzig, the Fulkerson, and the John von Neumann Theory Prize. He holds four honorary degrees and is a member of seven scientific academies, including the US National Academy of Engineering.

She has always been interested in mathematical modelling which led her in the direction of pursuing combinatorial optimization research. Her PhD focused on scheduling and particularly on developing a general model for personnel rostering that would be applicable across a wide range of health care organizations. This subject provided the perfect opportunity to initiate cooperation with the University of Nottingham, where she spent a one-year research stay. In 2002, she obtained a PhD in Engineering Science (Ghent University). Greet Vanden Berghe was appointed as professor at KU Leuven, Department of Computer Science in October 2014. She is currently a member of research unit NUMA (Numerical Analysis and Applied Mathematics) and leads the CODeS research group located at KU Leuven-Gent. Operational research represents Greet Vanden Berghe's primary research interest. Within the broad domain of operational research she focuses on complex combinatorial optimization problems. Examples of such problems include personnel scheduling, vehicle routing and all sorts of logistic operations. Her fundamental research activities involve mathematical modelling and the development of intelligent search algorithms such as heuristics and decomposition methods. She has successfully developed many heuristic decomposition algorithms, smart ways of tightening objectives or relaxing constraints, heuristics based on lower and upper bounding, and general-purpose local search operators. These new algorithm components have helped achieve the best computational results in several international competitions and benchmarking challenges. When studying industrial combinatorial optimization problems, especially their complicated constraints and objectives, Greet Vanden Berghe's team experienced that theory almost always falls short when it comes to efectively solving real-world problems. These insights led to the development of completely new yet highly efficient models and algorithms for industrial problems. Interestingly, developments for industrial-scale optimization problems often result in new theoretical insights given the inevitable need to simplify reality when modelling. Indeed, these new modelling methodologies are competitive with and often better than state-of-the-art algorithms focused on theoretical problems. CODeS provides benchmarks for various international challenges involving problems such as pickup and delivery, vehicle routing and sports timetabling. Greet Vanden Berghe cooperates with industry within many applied research projects (supported by VLAIO or by the companies themselves). These projects target the internal use of optimization algorithms for real-world applications. Implementations of these algorithms are often deployed in more generally applicable decision support systems.\n\nRicardo Fukasawa is a Professor at the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo.

She is the leader of the INOCS research project team. INOCS works on the modeling and development of solution methods for optimization problems with complex structure. She has been working on the optimization of transportation systems for more than 25 years and in the energy domain for more than 10 years. Her interests include the study of bi-level pricing problems, equilibrium problems and stochastic optimization. More precisely she has a strong experience in modeling and solving optimization problems representing hierarchical decision processes. These problems involve two types of decision markers: a leader and a follower. The leader explicitly integrates the reaction of the follower into his decision making process. This paradigm leading to bilevel optimization problems, is well suited to model and solve incentive design problem like pricing problems. In this case the leader is the agent defining the prices taking into account into the model the reaction of the consumers. Luce Brotcorne has developed efficient solution methods to solve large instances of pricing problems in the context of revenue management or demand side management. Several papers have been published in the energy or transportation field. She is co-author of more than 25 scientific papers or book chapters and has given more than 70 presentations in national and international conferences. She is the Vice President of the EURO-Working Group in Pricing and Revenue Management. She is an associate editor for the International Transactions in Operational Research (ITOR). She has supervised more than 15 PhD students and Post-docs. She has been, and still is, involved in industrial projects in the field of transportation and energy including the FUI LUMD project on urban logistics, the PGMO project - conducted with EDF (R&D) - on tariff determination in the framework of \"Demand Side Management in energy\" and “electric cars charging station design and pricing”. She has been the leader of 2 ANR (French Reserch Agency) projects on the design of freight transport systems with a hub structure and on the design of co-modal transport chains. The industrial partner of these two projects was DHL. She has been and is involved bilateral contracts with companies like Colisweb or Urban hub to develop new tools for city logistics.\n\nElise del Rosario is currently Chief Finance Officer of her family’s One Small Step Forward Foundation which aims to equip elementary public-school children with after school training in mathematics.
