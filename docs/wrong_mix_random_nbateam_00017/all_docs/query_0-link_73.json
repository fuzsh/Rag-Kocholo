        "text": "GIGABYTE is now pleased to announce another new partnership with cooling technology provider Incooling, who has adopted GIGABYTE’s overclockable R161 Series server platform as the test-bed and prototype model for a new class of two-phase liquid-cooled overclockable servers designed for the high-frequency trading market.\n\nTrue Innovations Only Come Together with Truly Innovative Partners\n\n\"We are very excited to be able to collaborate with GIGABYTE because we know that true innovations only come together with truly innovative partners. GIGABYTE not only makes best in class products but are also able to push the boundaries on multiple technology frontiers. These capabilities come together in their R161 series server, sporting both a highly modular and flexible system design for easy customization as well as the excellent power delivery and custom overclocking BIOS capabilities that allow us to fully exploit the potential of phase change cooling\" said Rudie Verweij, CEO at Incooling.\n\n\"We are always looking into new cooling technologies that help our customers push the boundaries of performance and efficiency in their data centres. Incooling offers a unique solution, different from others in the marketplace, and we are looking forward to working with them to see what new possibilities we can achieve using our servers together with their cutting edge two-phase cooling technology\" said Mike Chang, Thermal R&D Manager at GIGABYTE.\n\nTurbocharged Cooling\n\nIncooling's technology is capable of pushing temperatures far below the traditional data centre air temperatures, unlocking a new class of turbocharged servers. It does this by leveraging specialized refrigerants using phase-change cooling, inside a pressure-controlled loop. This is a highly efficient method that allows the exchange of the heat from the chip with the datacenter air with far less thermal resistance. Coupled with the R161 overclockable server from GIGABYTE, Incooling’s solutions are able to push performance further than ever before. First system tests showed up to 20°C lower core temperatures contributing up to 10% increase in boost clock-speed whilst lowering total power draw by 200 watts.\n\nContinuous R&D efforts will further push these boundaries, but it's not all just about raw performance increase. Soon, Incooling plans to adopt their cooling technology for other types of GIGABYTE server systems such as its H-Series multi-node servers for high-performance computing and G-Series GPU servers for artificial intelligence. This will further reduce the currently excessively high energy consumption in servers that are using the highest-powered CPUs or GPUs.\n\nAbout GIGABYTE\n\nGIGABYTE is an engineer, visionary, and leader in the world of tech that uses its hardware expertise, patented innovations, and industry leadership to create, inspire and advance. Renowned for over 30 years of award-winning excellence, GIGABYTE is a cornerstone in the HPC community, providing businesses with server and data centre expertise to accelerate their success. At the forefront of evolving technology, GIGABYTE is devoted to inventing smart solutions that enable digitalization from edge to cloud, and allow customers to capture, analyze, and transform digital information into economic data that can benefit humanity and \"Upgrade Your Life\".\n\nAbout Incooling"
