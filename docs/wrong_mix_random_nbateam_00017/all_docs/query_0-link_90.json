        "text": "Nanofellowship Competition is CLOSED!\n\nAttracting the best and brightest from around the world\n\nThe Nanofellowships are awarded to top graduate students pursuing nanotechnology research at the University of Waterloo. These prestigious fellowships valued at $10,000 each are awarded to new graduate applicants and current MSc and PhD students at the University of Waterloo. The Nanofellowships supplement the research support provided by the supervising faculty member. Nanofellowships can be held simultaneously with other graduate awards subject to the requirements of other scholarships or awards.\n\nFocus areas in nanotechnology include:\n\nSmart and functional materials: This includes but not limited to fundamental condensed matter physics, soft matter, materials characterization, nanomaterials, graphene and other 2D materials, quantum materials, nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, DNA self-assembly, biomaterial and nanocellulose, new materials for additive manufacturing (i.e., 3D printing).\n\nConnected devices: This includes but not limited to sensors (quantum-, nano- and microsensors), MEMS/NEMS, flexible electronics, wearable devices, lab-on-chip, use of internet-of-things and artificial intelligence for sensors, human-machine interfaces, and other connected devices.\n\nNext generation energy systems: This includes but not limited to fundamental understanding of transport processes in energy devices, batteries, fuel cells, catalysis, low-carbon sustainable technologies, artificial photosynthesis.\n\nTheranostics and therapeutics: This includes but not limited to targeted drug delivery, tissue engineering, minimally invasive treatment of diseases, immunotherapy and medical imaging.\n\nSpecial consideration will be given to students intending to pursue projects involving cross-disciplinary collaboration in nanotechnology.\n\nIn 2015, all United Nations Member States adopted the Agenda for Sustainable Development for 2030, providing a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for the planet. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) were devised to improve global challenges – such as improving health and living conditions – leading to sustainable development, economic growth and environmental protection. WIN is directly in tune with these global challenges, seeking solutions to ensure good health, clean water, affordable energy, industry & innovation, and climate action among all others, leading to a just society.\n\nFor full details about the UNSDGs, visit their website.\n\nApplication Process\n\nThe Nanofellowships competition is held annually. Applicants must hold an active graduate status, with a minimum of two terms remaining in their program, at the University of Waterloo. Applicants must satisfy the general eligibility requirements for the University of Waterloo graduate scholarships.\n\nExisting Students are defined as a student who has been accepted to UWaterloo Graduate Studies, has made tuition arrangements and have started their program with courses and/or conducting research. In this case, you are to complete the form for EXISTING STUDENT Application for the WIN Nanofellowship Program 2024 to include your most recent and complete transcripts and make arrangements for two (2) letters of reference.\n\nProspective Students are defined as a student who has applied to graduate studies at the University of Waterloo and has not yet started their graduate program (not yet taking courses or started research, and tuition fees have not been arranged for that term). In this case, a student would fill out the PROSPECTIVE STUDENT Application for the WIN Nanofellowship Program 2024 and consent to allow the Nanofellowship Review Committee to view their application to UWaterloo Graduate Studies which includes transcripts, reference letters and supplemental information already submitted. To be eligible for the Nanofellowship, you must have already applied to or will apply to UWaterloo Graduate Studies before the February 1st deadline. If you have submitted your application to UWaterloo Graduate Studies eight (8) months or longer before the time of application to the Nanofellowship, your application may no longer be on file. Please check with the department to which you originally applied to ensure your application is still valid and on file.\n\nFor Existing Students, competition results are usually announced in July.\n\nFor Prospective Students, competition results are usually announced in March."
