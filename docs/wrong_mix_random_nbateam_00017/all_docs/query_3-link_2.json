        "text": "TU/e is not alone in considering Ruud van Sloun a promising researcher. In 2020, he was also included by Elsevier in their ‘30-under-30’ list because of his special applications of artificial intelligence in ultrasound scanning. His work at the department of Electrical Engineering to quickly determine whether someone’s lungs have been damaged was, of course, made all the more topical by the corona pandemic.\n\n“I’m working on applying AI in next-generation imaging for imaging systems (such as MRI, ultrasound and radar) that intelligently observe the world around them and respond to it to gather important information. For medical applications, this information could be diagnosis-related; for automotive radar, it’s all about safety.\n\nI believe that these imaging systems should include their own ‘imagination’. They should be able to envision what’s happening out there. The systems can then figure out hidden causes of the measurement data and oversee the consequences of their own actions (e.g., choosing what to measure). Only then can they optimally plan their own image processing strategies. For this, we use state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.”\n\nWinning this award means a lot to him. “Today’s fundraising and awarding processes are very competitive. Along with many other talented scientists, you are fighting for the same subsidies and funds. In this environment, anything you can do to stand out with your work matters. That’s why winning this award is really important for me and my team,” says Sloun.\n\nYet even for a talented scientist like Sloun, it was not always obvious that he would go into science. “I've always been curious and creative, and I used to question whether I wanted to continue in music or science. By the time I got my PhD in Electrical Engineering, the realization had arisen that creativity is also the key to success in science and that you need your creativity on a daily basis in order to move forward. That caused me decide to stay in science.”\n\nTom de Greef is an associate professor of synthetic biology in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the TU/e Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS). He specializes in synthetic biology and DNA nanotechnology, which he is applying in the development of a molecular computer. He has previously won special awards and is a member of the KNAW’s The Young Academy. This also leaves him feeling calm when it comes to winning this award. “It does confirm my conviction that we’re doing great research with our team. This award motivates us to continue doing so in the future,” says de Greef.\n\nHe has worked or studied at TU/e for most of his career, starting as a first-year student in 1998. “My group does research in the field of living technology, or technological products produced by or composed of living cells. We build cellular systems with non-natural components so that they can perform tasks that their all-natural counterparts cannot.\n\nConsider the detection of disease in the human body. In our second line of research, we use DNA to store information at the molecular level. DNA-based data storage is the perfect solution for archiving data storage because you don’t need environmentally unfriendly data centers that use a huge amount of energy for this.”\n\nAs a full professor at the Human Performance Management group, Eva Demerouti studies how people stay motivated at work. And with all the changes in working conditions in recent years, there is plenty to investigate. “I do research on work characteristics, such as people’s well-being and functioning in their work. I apply this subject to improve how employees adapt to (technological) changes.\n\nI also develop interventions to improve employee well-being and functioning, to increase inclusiveness and diversity in organizations and even to improve employee functioning during crises, such as COVID-19. In doing so, I strive to provide answers which are based on facts and evidence and to uncover clear answers to contemporary organizational problems related to these subjects,” says Demerouti.\n\nThe fact that Demerouti now works at TU/e and is very successful here was also the result of an unusual path for her. “I was asked by one of my current colleagues to apply for the position of professor at TU/e. I had seen the vacancy, but I hadn’t responded because I didn’t think I qualified. It did take some time to get used to the TU/e culture, coming from a general university, but now I’m very happy to be working at TU/e.”\n\nAnd that hope for the future only gets stronger through winning this award: “I hope that this will allow me to set up even more great collaborations with interesting people doing fascinating research.”"
