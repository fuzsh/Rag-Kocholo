        "text": "𝐄𝐈𝐑𝐄𝐒 𝐏𝐞𝐨𝐩𝐥𝐞 | We're happy to welcome Assistant Professor Lenneke Kuijer to the EIRES management team as of May 2024. Alongside Lisanne Havinga, MSc. PhD, she will lead the Energy Transition in the Built Environment focus area.👏 Lenneke's innovative approach integrates social science methods into energy research, aiming to better define problems and improve solution efficacy. Her journey, from her early fascination with technology to her work on sustainability, showcases her commitment to challenging conventional thinking. A highlight is her Veni-project on summer comfort, where she used speculative design to expand the design space. This led to BRYS, an interface design for thermostats that encourages natural temperature regulation. At EIRES, Lenneke aims to create a collaborative platform, bridging social sciences and engineering to address built environment challenges. Read the full interview here👉 https://lnkd.in/e8GnFR_T #EnergyTransition #Sustainability #SocialScience #Engineering #Innovation\n\nLast month, the researchers and principal investigators involved in the first nine projects of the BEHeaT program gathered for a pitch event to strengthen the interaction between and integration of the different projects. 🌍 The event promoted unique collaboration through an innovative approach - presenting each other's work. This method significantly enhanced mutual understanding and opened new avenues for interdisciplinary integration. Erik Matien, EIRES Senior Program Manager, emphasized the importance of collaboration from the research phase to achieve the energy transition in the built environment. The BEHeaT program, initiated in January 2023, aims to grow into a national initiative, with a focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7. 🚀 Read more here: https://lnkd.in/eJ-AjwEY #EnergyTransition #ResearchCollaboration #Sustainability\n\nWhich incentives are most effective in keeping our energy grid accessible? TU/e researchers have analyzed the most popular measures and come to a conclusion: a balanced set of different incentives works best! In their research, which they performed together with TNO, PhD students Bart van der Holst and Gijs Verhoeven analyzed financial measures for grid operators to better use the existing grid capacity. Their conclusion: a smart set of balanced measures is the best solution to keep the energy grid accessible in the short and the long term! Therefore, their supervisor, EIRES Professor Koen Kok, advises: \"The time to design solutions is now because we need to be better equipped to deal with the current and future net congestion.\" Read more👉https://lnkd.in/eN-mzZXH #netcongestion #energyresearch #energytransition\n\n𝗢𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗻𝗲𝘄𝘀𝗹𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗻𝗼𝘄 📢 Enjoy reading our bimonthly EIRES Energizer about our news, research and events: https://lnkd.in/gCQgZgjE In this June edition: • 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 | The pore network community & a BeHeat pitch event • 𝗙𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 | Build your own SolarBEAT • 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀 & 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 | Brabetech & Honors Academy's demo day • 𝗘𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗴𝘆 𝗗𝗲𝗯𝗮𝘁𝗲 | A discussion between Jos Brouwers and Auke Hoekstra, interview with Sustainability Ambassador Anna Wieczorek & PhD researchers Bart van der Holst and Gijs Verhoeven about net congestion mitigation • 𝗔𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀, 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘇𝗲𝘀 & 𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘁𝘀| Best Paper Award for Hailin Zheng, NWO OTP funding for Marc Geers & honory doctorate for Karen Scrivener • 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 | Lenneke Kuijer & Linda Zandt-Sloot • 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 | Serena Agnolin, George Rouwhorst & Aled Meulenbroek • 𝗣𝗮𝘀𝘁 & 𝗨𝗽𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 • 𝗣𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 | Third edition of EIRES’ annual magazine is out Stay informed about our news and sign up for the newsletter👉 https://lnkd.in/eqmeVarz #energy #news #events #renewableenergy\n\nWith the onset of summer, the temperature's rising, and the sun is out again in the Netherlands. It's time to think about keeping our living and working spaces cool. ❄️ EIRES principal scientist Lenneke Kuijer concluded her research to summer comfort this year by presenting a concept thermostat BRYS. BRYS will help you keep your home up to nine degrees Celsius cooler than the outside, and it will help you train your body's comfort range. This will help you to stay cool during the summer without using energy-intensive appliances and air conditioners. She did her research and design work with partners in the cooling and ventilation branche and housing associations, among others.

In various chemical processes, such as cement production, CO₂ is released. Therefore, several companies focus on capturing CO₂ from the air. They then store this in the ground, she outlines. But CO₂ can also be cleverly reused. That's why the students devised a bioreactor in which the captured CO₂ is converted into raw materials by cyanobacteria. Those materials can then be used again in various industries, such as the cement industry, thus establishing a circular model. \"This way, we have gains on two fronts,\" she said. Congratulations Cristina Jimenez Pelarda, Gabrielle Mathieu, Matylda Guz, and Raya Dimitrova! 👏 Read more about the TU/e contest: https://lnkd.in/ekZrtms5 📷 Bart van Overbeeke\n\n𝗘𝗜𝗥𝗘𝗦 𝗟𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗵 𝗟𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 with Professor Mark Huijben, University of Twente Join us live in Disruptor @ TU/e campus!

Current microbatteries suffer from limited performance and degradation, requiring major improvements. Key challenges include enhancing energy capacity, charging rate, safety, cycle life, and material availability. The main issue is poor reversibility at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces, leading to short battery life due to parasitic reactions and structural changes. Thin film epitaxial microbattery architectures enable precise control over materials and interfaces, offering insights into electrochemistry and structural ordering. Using pulsed laser deposition, researchers have created controlled 2D and 3D interfaces, advancing our understanding of battery performance. The latest research involves various thin film battery architectures with different cathodes, anodes, and solid electrolytes. This lunch lecture is organized by Mariadriana Creatore.
