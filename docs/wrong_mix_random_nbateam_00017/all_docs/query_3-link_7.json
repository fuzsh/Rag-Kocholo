The patented formula ensures that passwords are dynamically generated at login time. This means that passwords always meet all security requirements and static passwords that can be stolen are a thing of the past. üôè\n\nüîë MindYourPass‚Äôs unique technology can be used immediately on any website or online application. In addition, the technology is applicable much more broadly than just passwords. For example, it is also used to manage Passkeys without storing them anywhere.\n\n‚ÄúOur mission has always been to create a safer internet by eliminating the weak links in password security,‚Äù said MindYourPass CEO Merijn de Jonge. ‚ÄúWith this patent, we can offer our technology on a larger scale and protect users worldwide.‚Äù\n\nRead the full press release in the news section. of our website.\n\n#patent #cybersecurity #dataprotection #impact #innovation #startups\n\n@hightechxl\".",
