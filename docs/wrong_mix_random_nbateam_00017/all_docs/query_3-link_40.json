        "meta_description": "Purpose:  Established in 2008, this award recognizes outstanding accomplishments and leadership in the area of diesel engines. Two awards are given each year, one for Best Paper and the other, the Diesel Engine Research Medal, given to an individual for outstanding leadership in research and development in the field of diesel engines through a singular accomplishment or lifetime achievement.  The Best Paper award recognizes the authors of an original and outstanding technical paper presented at an SAE meeting about diesel engines in the on- or off-road industries.  The Medal recognizes an outstanding leader whose professional career has focused on advancing the field of diesel engines.&nbsp;  This award is funded through generous contributions from Dr. John H. Johnson, his colleagues and former students. Dr. Johnson is a Presidential Professor Emeritus with the Department of Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics at Michigan Technological University (MTU), and he is a fellow of SAE International and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He is an expert in the field of diesel engines and his experience spans a wide range of analysis and experimental work related to advanced engine concepts, emissions studies, fuel systems, engine simulation and exhaust after treatment.  Criteria:  Paper Award:    Preferably published in an SAE Journal.  Addresses research advancements in diesel engines regarding efficiency and low emissions achieved by innovative experimental and modeling research of the engine, fuel and/or after treatment systems.  Oral presentation scores must be above average.  If the lead author of the paper is a student, the material forming the subject matter must be based on personal work or a result of their thesis research.   The Medal:    Recognizes technical innovations through experimental studies and modeling research of the engine, fuel and/or after-treatment systems.  The nominee's contribution to SAE literature, activities and programs will be considered.   Eligibility:  Members of the Selection Committee are not eligible for this award while serving on the committee. Two years must pass before former members of the Selection Committee are eligible to receive the award.  Recognition:    Best Paper: The lead author of the best paper receives an honorarium and framed certificate; supporting authors receive framed certificates.  Medal: Winner receives the medal, a framed certificate, and an honorarium.
