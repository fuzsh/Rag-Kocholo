        "text": "The ALD Innovator award “For Original Work and Leadership in ALD” will be presented on Monday during the Plenary Lecture Session.\n\nStacey F. Bent\n\nStanford University, USA\n\nBiography: Stacey F. Bent is the Jagdeep and Roshni Singh Professor at Stanford University, where she is Professor of Chemical Engineering and Professor, by courtesy, of Chemistry, of Materials Science and Engineering, and of Electrical Engineering. Professor Bent obtained her B.S. degree in chemical engineering from UC Berkeley and her Ph.D. degree in chemistry from Stanford. After carrying out postdoctoral work at AT&T Bell Laboratories, she was on the faculty of the Chemistry Department at New York University before joining Stanford University in 1998. At Stanford, she currently serves as Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs. Stacey Bent’s research is focused on understanding surface chemistry and materials synthesis and applying this knowledge to a variety of problems in sustainable energy, semiconductor processing, and nanotechnology. Her research on atomic layer deposition (ALD) has ranged from fundamental mechanistic studies to applications in solar cells, fuel cells, catalysts and batteries. She and her group have been active in the development of area selective ALD. Professor Bent has published over 250 papers, presented over 300 invited talks, and supervised nearly 50 Ph.D. students and 20 postdoctoral scholars. She has been involved in the AVS and has participated in the organization of international conferences on ALD. She is a Fellow of the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the American Vacuum Society (AVS). She received the ACS Award in Surface Chemistry in 2018 and the SRC Technical Excellence Award in 2020. She was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Engineering in 2020.\n\nThe ALD Innovator award “For Original Work and Leadership in ALD” will be presented on Monday during the Plenary Lecture Session.\n\nMikko Ritala\n\nUniversity of Helsinki, Finland\n\nBiography: Mikko Ritala (born 1968 in Nokia, Finland) is a professor of inorganic materials chemistry at University of Helsinki. He received his M.Sc. degree in 1991 from University of Turku, and Ph.D. degree in 1994 from University of Helsinki, both in inorganic chemistry. During 1995 – 2003 he worked at University of Helsinki, first as a postdoctoral researcher and then as an academy research fellow, both posts granted by Academy of Finland. In 2003 he was nominated to his current position.\n\nAfter starting in 1991, Mikko Ritala has spent nearly 30 years in ALD research. His main research topic in ALD is development of new processes and precursors for thin films for microelectronics and other applications. Real time reaction mechanism studies form an important part of this research. Another research area is preparation of nanostructured materials by for example templating with ALD and electrodeposition, and electrospinning and electroblowing of nanofibres. Mikko Ritala has supervised 30 PhDs, published 500 papers (h-index = 70) and holds several key patents. In 2007 he was nominated as ISI Highly Cited Author in the field of materials science, and in 2010 he received Alfred Kordelin Foundation award. He has given numerous invited talks in international conferences. He started the American Vacuum Society’s short course on Atomic Layer Deposition and has given tutorials on the same topic also in other occasions. Mikko Ritala has participated in organization of numerous international conferences, including the AVS ALD conference series from its very beginning. He chaired the ALD 2004 meeting in Helsinki that combined the AVS-ALD and Baltic ALD (BALD) conferences, and he is prepared to repeat the same in 2024."
