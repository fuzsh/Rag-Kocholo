        "text": "To recognize an outstanding paper published in the IEEE Control Systems Letters.\n\nHistorical Background:\n\nEstablished in 2019.\n\nPrize:\n\nSingle annual award (at most 1 paper may be selected) with possibly additional recipients. A photo-engrave plaque for each recipient and, for one recipient, travel expenses to the CDC (round trip restricted minimal coach air fare), conference registration and up to 4 conference-rate hotel nights for a 3-day conference, and up to 5 conference-rate hotel nights for a 4-day conference).\n\nFunding:\n\nFunded by the IEEE Control Systems Society.\n\nPresentation:\n\nAt most one (1) award is presented annually at the Awards Ceremony of the IEEE Control Systems Society.\n\nBasis for Judging:\n\nOriginality, potential impact on the theoretical foundations of control, importance and practical significance in applications, and clarity.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPapers published in the IEEE Control Systems Letters during the two calendar years preceding the year of the award. The paper publication date is determined by the journal volume date (not the online publication date). The same paper cannot receive both the Roberto Tempo Best CDC Paper Award and the IEEE Control Systems Letters Outstanding Paper Award in the same year.\n\nNomination Details:\n\nNomination Deadline: May 15 of each year.\n\nNomination Forms\n\nNominations and reference letters are due by May 15 and must be submitted using the IEEE Control Systems Society Awards Nomination system at\n\ncss.paperplaza.net.\n\nNomination Form\n\nNomination Instructions\n\n*Footnote: Any paper presented at the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) during year N is eligible for the Roberto Tempo Best CDC Paper Award during year N+1. Any paper appeared in the IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS) during year N is eligible for the IEEE Control Systems Letters Outstanding Paper Award during years N+1 and N+2. A paper that is presented at the CDC in year N and appears in the L-CSS in year N cannot receive both the Roberto Tempo Best CDC Paper Award and the IEEE Control Systems Letters Outstanding Paper Award in year N+1. (But it can receive the Tempo award in year N+1 and the L-CSS award in year N+2.)"
