        "text": "Ten new winners\n\nDuring the sold-out Gerard & Anton Event, winners 81 through 90 received awards. They are:\n\nAntennex\n\nVivArt-X\n\nInteger Technologies\n\nMantispectra\n\nGrAI Matter Labs\n\nGilbert Technologies\n\nAlphabeats\n\nNeople\n\nTibo Energy\n\nFonontech\n\nThere was also a special prize for Pakt: this promising student team operating out of TU Delft and TU Eindhoven received the Golden Pear from Round One Ventures.\n\nNot just any award\n\nSince 2014, Gerard & Anton have been visible once a year. The many talents present in Brainport have been given a nice stage with these Awards for nine years. Research by Strategy Unit and Innovation Origins has also shown the success of that formula: where on average about ten to twenty to percent of start-ups are permanently successful, for the former winners of the Gerard and Anton Awards this is around 75 percent. An unprecedentedly high number.\n\nThe survey also made it clear that there are still ways to develop further. Most importantly: former award winners overwhelmingly asked for more ways to stay in touch. In other words, they asked for the creation of a Gerard & Anton Community. With support from the regular sponsors of the Gerard & Anton Award, that can now come about.\n\nFounders Dinner\n\nThe first activity is the G&A Founders Dinner, to which all 90 founders or CEOs who have ever won an award will be invited to the Philips Museum. This will be an opportunity to learn from each other and from figureheads from the world of High-Tech in an informal setting.\n\nSylvia van Es, President Philips Netherlands: \"It fits into our DNA that the experienced companies help them where necessary. In this way we try to further stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship in the region together. In the run-up to next year's Gerard & Anton anniversary edition, with the 100th winner, we will therefore start an annual Gerard & Anton dinner in our Philips Museum. In this way we want to continue to invest together in the unique strength of Brainport: a finely woven, almost invisible network of cooperating parties from industry, education and government. In doing so, together we will continue to contribute to this extraordinarily important breeding ground for new ideas that provide a fertile breeding ground for the innovative startups of today and tomorrow, so that together we can build on what once started at Gerard's.\"\n\nThe dinner is just the beginning. A regular newsletter will become part of the community, featuring the successes of community members, as well as their challenges and requests. The annual High Tech Peak Awards and monthly Drinks Pitches & Demos will have a place within Gerard & Anton. Other initiatives and activities will be determined by the members themselves.\n\nIO Next\n\nYou can read more about the Gerard and Antwon Award winners in the special edition of IO Next. This new magazine, produced by Innovation Origins, was christened during the Gerard & Anton Awards. The first copy is free to read: https://online.fliphtml5.com/lknoe/yclv/\n\nThe Gerard & Anton Awards are an initiative of Innovation Origins, platform for the story of innovation from across Europe. Besides Philips, Gerard & Anton also has High Tech Campus, EY, Kadans, Twice, Mikrocentrum, Holland Innovative, VO, Municipality of Eindhoven, Rabobank and Dispatches Europe as sponsors.\n\nLees gratis IO Next magazine"
