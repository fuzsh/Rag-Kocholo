TU Eindhoven Professor Sjoerd (Georges) Romme is the recipient of this year’s Distinguished Scholar-Practitioner career achievement award of the Academy of Management (AOM). He received the award last Sunday in Boston, at the AOM’s Annual Meeting. Romme is the first European scholar receiving this award.

The award is given annually in recognition of long-term, significant contributions to research that has affected the practice of management. Since its inception in 2003, the prize has been awarded to American scholars only, from institutions like MIT, Harvard and London Business School.

The award committee applauds Rommes’ “strong influence on the practice of management”, and his strong publishing record. “His influence has been used in the implementation activities of numerous firms and has also stimulated new research aimed at bridging the gap between theory and practice. The broad impact of his contributions as a scholar and practitioner has brought lasting and now multiplying benefits to the field. Additionally, he has taken on service roles to improve the rigour and relevance of university curricula, at multiple universities. ”

Romme, who is a professor of Entrepreneurship & Innovation at the Eindhoven University of Technology, focusses on research on technology entrepreneurship, innovation management, organization design, organizational renewal, and professional corporate governance. From 2007 to 2014, Romme also was the dean of the TU/e Industrial Engineering & Innovation Sciences department.

The Academy of Management is the preeminent professional association for management, organization and entrepreneurship scholars. It has more than 20,000 members in 120 countries around the world.
