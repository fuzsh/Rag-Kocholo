        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Jordan Poole had the ball in his hand and his heel on the logo as the shot clock wound down late in the third quarter Friday night. Bulls guard Ayo Dosunmu basically dared him to take the shot.\n\nPoole let it fly from 33 feet out.\n\nSwish.\n\nThe Warriors fourth-year guard celebrated his seventh 3-pointer of the night putting three fingers up on each hand and waving his tongue.\n\nPoole’s shooting has been streaky this season, but he was due for a night like Friday in the Warriors’ 119-111 win over the Chicago Bulls.\n\nPoole scored 14 first-quarter points, all after Stephen Curry checked out after picking up two fouls in the first six minutes, and finished with 30 total on 11 of 18 shooting in 23 minutes.\n\n“I’m just not going to stop shooting,” Poole said after picking up his third 30-point game this season and 14th of his career. “That is all it was. We had some good looks early. I’ve been doing the same thing the last couple of games. It felt good today, they just dropped.”\n\nPoole led the league in made 3-pointers in the last two months of the regular season this spring, but hasn’t been able to recreate the same magic on a consistent basis this season. He entered Friday shooting 41.5% from the field while making only 30.5% of his shots from deep. In his last five games, Poole has gone 8-for-40 from 3-point land before making 7 of 13 against the Bulls.\n\nPoole can’t quite put his finger on why that has been the case this season.\n\n“Sometimes they just don’t go in,” Poole said after taking a long pause. “If I had the answer I’d tell you… We play so many games and it’s just reps, over and over and over [and] sometimes they’re just not going to fall.”\n\nPoole has turned to Curry for advice. The Warriors superstar went through a stretch late last season when he shot well under his standard expectation.\n\n“It happens to the best of us, the great shooters of all time, I’m literally behind Steph and Klay” Thompson, who had a cold shooting streak to start the season but has started to turn it around. “It happens especially as a shooter,” Poole continued, “because if it was easy to shoot 3s, everybody would do it.”\n\nCoach Steve Kerr attributed some of Poole’s early-season struggles to the 23-year-old over dribbling and trying too hard. He also compared Poole’s situation to Thompson, who had tried to shoot his way out of a slump before Draymond Green pulled him aside and told him to be paitent and trust his teammates.\n\n“Jordan is in a hurry with his playmaking,” Kerr said. “As he slows down and simplifies his game, I think the same thing will happen for him as it did with Klay [Thompson] where the game got easier, the shots started to go, and I think that’s the next step for Jordan.”\n\nFriday was a move in the right direction for Poole, but the Warriors again found themselves in trouble after squandering a double figure lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nGolden State held an 18-point advantage before it dissolved late in the quarter. Zach LaVine, who finished with 21 points, hit a 3 at the 2:27 mark to pull the visitors within one. But Draymond Green made his second 3-pointer of the night — which Kerr called “the shot of the game” — that extinguished the Bulls’ momentum, and the Warriors held on from there.\n\nGreen finished with 14 points on an efficient 4 of 6 shooting. He also had 10 assists and nine rebounds. Thompson contributed 26 points and six assists, and Curry added 19 points and 11 rebounds for his sixth double-double this season.\n\nThe Warriors have now won nine straight games at Chase Center and improve to 12-11 overall. They’ll have a quick turnaround, hosting the Houston Rockets Saturday evening."
