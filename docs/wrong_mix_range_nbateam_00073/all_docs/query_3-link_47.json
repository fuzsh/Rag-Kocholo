        "text": "The Golden State Warriors are transitioning into a new era, as Klay Thompson has left for the Dallas Mavericks. With fellow Splash Brother Stephen Curry (and Draymond Green) left behind, the front office is doing all they can to surround him with pieces as their window with him gets narrower.\n\nThis summer, the Golden State Warriors have added Buddy Hield, De’Anthony Melton, and Kyle Anderson in free agency. And because Curry can become an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2026, Mike Dunleavy Jr. and co. will continue to have their work cut out for them in the next few months.\n\nMaking Stephen Curry happy is the utmost priority for the Golden State Warriors, as he is still one of the best players in the NBA. In the 2023-24 campaign, the four-time NBA champion averaged 26.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 5.1 assists on 45/41/92 shooting splits in 74 regular season games. However, that wasn’t enough because the Golden State Warriors didn’t make it to the postseason.\n\nStephen Curry will make roughly $55 million and $60 million in the next two seasons before his current deal runs out. He will be 38 years old at that time.\n\nGolden State Warriors GM provides an update on Stephen Curry’s extension\n\nStephen Curry would be eligible for a new extension next year. Golden State Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. expects the two-time league MVP to be with the franchise until he hangs up his sneakers for good, debunking the notion that he may switch teams in his final years.\n\n“We will talk about that too. I mean, look, that guy, whatever he wants. I’d say, pretty confident he’ll be a Warrior for life,” Dunleavy said about extension talks with Stephen Curry via The Athletic’s Anthony Slater.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Bobby Marks, Stephen Curry can receive a two-year, $130 million extension if he waits until next summer."
