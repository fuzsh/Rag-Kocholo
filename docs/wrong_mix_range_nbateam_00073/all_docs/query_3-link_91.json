        "text": "One fan recalls highlights from a quarter century of living in NBA oblivion\n\nBy Andrew J. Pridgen\n\nAs the lead crept past 30 during the early fourth quarter of the Warriors’ game 5 dismantling of the Houston Rockets last night my girlfriend felt around her area of the couch for the remote.\n\nShe was itching to scroll through the guide to find one of those shows where they knock a bunch of walls out, a wiring emergency requires a special phone call, a marble slab is thrown in the kitchen, an antique fan gets staged near some candles—and it all gets delivered on time and on budget. Maybe she didn’t want to wait for the confetti to drop as the Warriors would ultimately win and advance to the second round—but I give her credit, she’s sat through a lot of basketball this year. Enough so that when she looked up from her iPad in the second quarter during a time out, she said, “Sit down Steph—think about your knee.”\n\nIt was a proud moment for me, ebbed only by this follow-up inquisition from her: “How long exactly have you been a Warriors fan?”\n\nThere was a subtext in that question, and maybe it was deserved. A lot of folks have somehow migrated north with their N.B.A. fandom as the Warriors have risen from doormat to prominence. Everyone likes a winner and everyone likes a likeable hero. The present-day Warriors have both, and frankly are what the Lakers should be. But since Jerry Buss’s passing in 2013, it seems Golden State has not only inherited the blueprint and the mojo, but many of the surnames long associated with the purple and gold: West, Thompson, Walton, Nash—have relocated to the land of better wi-fi.\n\nAt least temporarily.\n\nAs one who’s lived in both Oakland and L.A.—and also happens to hella/hecka love both for very different reasons, I can see why there’s an I-5 connection of sorts between the two teams. And Laker fans who are waiting for their savior (*cough* Walton) to unify a young, talented but fractured squad—may not need to wait much longer.\n\nBut it’s still bizarre for me to find the Warriors on equal footing, if not currently venerated as the better franchise. Long-suffering Warrior fans have an awareness like a guy who punches up a notch or two dating someone discernibly more accomplished, nicer and better-looking. Your friends, the ones who know you best, will be happy for you and the fact that good fortune may have smiled on you at last—but they know it’s not permanent.\n\nI’ve been a Warrior fan long enough to feel that nervous twitch like they’re going to ghost me at any moment. And by that I mean my fandom stretches over two generations. My father was a fan, sure enough. Though he was never a season ticket holder, he would sit in the garage and listen to a good 70 of the 82 games a season on his radio. To me, there’s no better testament to fandom than that. I like watching basketball—especially live—the game, when played well, is fast, fluid and a little bit nerve wracking. But on the radio? You lose me there. Maybe it was through sheer boredom or maybe he was just pining away waiting for baseball season to start. No matter. My father used his imagination for every Mullin three, every Hardaway no-look, every buttery Mitch Richmond drive in the paint.\n\nIt was during the Run TMC era—that the Warriors first caught my eye. Specifically Richmond’s rookie year. When the speedy and physical guard garnered Rookie of the Year honors, you might as well have hung a banner in my room. That Richmond caricature shirt, the one where the cartoon him has a really big head driving for a layup, was worn so frequently my mother gently suggested maybe she buy a second so she could rotate it through the laundry.\n\nConsequently, it was the Richmond trade for Billy Owens on November 2, 1991 that cursed the franchise for the next quarter century. Beyond the chokings, both of the coach and on the court, the missteps drafting and grooming the most notoriously bad players and coaches is stuff of legend and too numerous to list. (That’s not entirely true. If you’d like the list it’s actually here).\n\nTwenty-five years is a long time for a dry spell—it’s actually more a prison sentence for doing something really, really bad—or, if you live in Texas, not doing anything at all. But there were so, so many highlights during that time, most of them personal to me, that when asked the question “How long, exactly, have you been a Warriors fan?” I can’t help but smile.\n\nThey are, in no particular order:\n\nNovember, 1997 all-you-can-eat-off: The Bulls were in town and second-year forward, 1996’s 11th overall pick (you know him as the man taken over Kobe) Todd Fuller was already a known threat to be out of the league within the year. My buddy Paul’s sister was engaged to a guy who’s dad, Neil Funk, did the Bulls play-by-play. Neil treated Paul and me to seats three rows up at the arena plus access to a sky box where we tried to eat as many hot dogs and pound as many beers as we could between quarters (it was all just laying out on a table and none of the guys in suits, no tie were touching it). I’m not sure how much they appreciated Joey Chestnut and Kobayashi coming in and owning the spread, which is why our credentials were checked numerous times—but we didn’t care. Fuller, for the record, scored 14 and Jordan was held to single digits.\n\n2000 All-Star Weekend: Jam Session. Me, Paul and another buddy, Chris, scored some tickets to the Rookie Game. Our plan was to stay and sneak in for the dunk contest but I think the same ushers that were watching us a few years earlier during the Bulls game saw what we were up to. Then-unknown pop star Pink played at the half of the rookie game and got boo’d and Paul wore a Ray Lewis jersey (this was like a week after Lewis stabbed a dude to death with a broken champagne bottle during a Super Bowl after party). Everyone was pointing to Paul’s jersey and saying, “One love.” Solidarity man.\n\nSimply the Best: This time it was just me and Chris who decided to meet up after work for a December, 2006 game against the Hornets. We bought nosebleeds with the intent to sneak down later but those who’ve sat under the turned up brim of the Oracle sombrero know there’s something hypnotic about being way up top—so we just kind of sat up there and shot the shit. Suddenly, during the third quarter Adonal Foyle grabs an offensive board and the lights go down like during intros. We thought maybe something bad was happening, but it turned out it was something magical. The PA guy in his best Michael Buffer said, “Con-grat-u-laaaations to Adonal Foyle, for becoming the Warriors’ all-time leading rebounder.” The game was stopped and some girl slacks and a lanyard came out and presented Foyle with like a $19 check and a trophy that looked like someone popped the BMX bike off the top and glued a basketball on. A bunch of the players shuffled around trying to stay loose and we could see Foyle blushing from the rafters. Oh, then they played Tina Turner, “Simply the Best” over the PA as a montage of Foyle rebounding highlights showed on the scoreboard.\n\nChris and I still tell this story when things are getting a little stagnant in group conversation and I know at least one guy who asks us to share this tale whenever we’re drinking beers. It usually ends with him clapping and laughing and saying, “Simply the Best—that’s the best.”\n\nBut my favorite Warrior memory:\n\n2002: Season-opening tailgater: Me, Chris and two other buddies (Dave and Brady) wanted to get together to commemorate the season’s tip-off. We decided to have a tailgater and barbecue for the home opener. Dutifully we showed up at the coliseum two hours before tip off and the parking lot looked like an elementary school on the Fourth of July. NOBODY was there. No smartphones meant someone had to go around and double-check the marquee. Yes, there was a game tonight. We unpacked and David started on the barbecue as daylight was scarce. It was delicious. About an hour in, a security guard came by in his little cart and asked us what we were doing. “Tailgating!” And would he like a hot dog? He garbled something into his mic and just before moving along. He said he’d seen a lot of things, but he’d never seen anyone tailgating for a Warriors game. Once inside, rookie Mike Dunleavy didn’t do much. Jason Richardson dunked. Earl Boykins turned over a couple off his foot while Gilbert Arenas gave him stinkface and Antawn Jamison looked like he’d have rather been tailgating too.\n\nThe Warriors lost, or maybe they won that night, but it didn’t matter. What mattered is we were there.\n\n…Last night just after my girlfriend asked me “How long exactly have you been a Warriors fan?” Dave sent a group text to me, Chris and Brady. It was a Warrior tweet about an actual tailgate (with bounce house/some fan experience thing) happening prior to the Houston game:\n\nHe recalled our original tailgater, there alone among the bums with the empty shopping carts, the off-duty BART cop snaking up a brew, the security guard’s reaction—and once in awhile getting hit in the face with swirling garbage.\n\nI turned to her and said, “Long enough.”\n\nThe Golden State Warriors, hoisters of their first Larry O’Brien trophy in 40 years Tuesday, advanced to the playoffs just eight times during the four-decade reign of futility and never came close to sniffing the jock of a finals berth. Whether through wasted lottery picks, ill-advised trades, bloated contracts or simply awful coaching and bungled front office management, the Warriors wrote volumes on fostering the culture of losing.\n\nBy Andrew Pridgen\n\nBelow, a list of the top 40 worst Warriors who personified the team’s doormat image from the 1976 to 2014 seasons. Please note, some of these players and staff were good guys, just bad for the organization. They rank lowest. As we climb closer to the best of the bad, the character issues mount.\n\n40) Eric Musselman (2002-2004) I really don’t have much against Musselman the coach but the Musselman-era gaffes of the front office taint my judgement, so he’s probably guilty by association. In his first year trolling the Dubs’ sideline, Musselman was runner-up to Gregg Popovich for the NBA Coach of the Year Award. That season, Golden State played .500 ball for the first time in more than a decade. Not 100 percent a players’ coach, both Gilbert Arenas (free agent opt-out) and Antwan Jamison (see: #36 Nick Van Exel) bounced out of the Bay under coach Eric’s watch. Musselman was fired in 2004 by incoming VP Chris Mullin.\n\n39) Ike Diogu (2005-07) I ain’t mad at Ike besides the fact that the Nigerian Nightsweats was a 9th overall pick and a power forward who couldn’t shoot, rebound or defend much. Later, the always nervous Diogu was shipped to Larry Bird’s Indiana Pacers along with Mike Dunleavy Jr., Troy Murphy and Keith McLeod in exchange for Stephen Jackson, Al Harrington, Sarunas Jasikevicius and Josh Powell. This was basically the NBA equivalent of when you say to the neighbor kid, “I’ll trade you this single rollerblade for that flat football that’s sunbleached on one side from sitting in your backyard for the last three years.”\n\n38) Joe Smith (1995-1998) College player of the year for Maryland. Number one overall pick. And then literally went on to become the NBA’s Becky. In 1998, Smith was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in a four-player blockbuster that brought forward Clarence Weatherspoon and guard Jim Jackson to Golden State. Boo Yeah! Smith went on to play for the Detroit Pistons, the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Milwaukee Bucks, the Denver Nuggets, the 76ers again, the Chicago Bulls, the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Atlanta Hawks, the New Jersey Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers. Smith is still enjoying his frequent flier miles.\n\n37) Popeye Jones (2003-2004) Brought on late in his career to help the Warriors to a 37-45 record, the endorsement deal with Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen never quite worked out and no spinach could kickstart the moribund Warriors while he started at power forward.\n\n36) Nick Van Exel (2003-2004) At the time, Van Exel was the headliner in the Warriors’ biggest most desperate trade in two decades. Van Exel was acquired on August 18, 2003 from the Mavericks along with Evan Eschmeyer, Avery Johnson, Popeye Jones and Antoine Rigaudeau in exchange for Antawn Jamison, Chris Mills, Danny Fortson and Jiri Welsch. Van Exel showed some small flourishes but basically took minutes from Speedy Claxton while bringing the culture of mediocrity he created with the Mavs in his carryon.\n\n35) Calbert Cheaney (2003-2006) Cheaney closed out his lackluster NBA career in Golden State stamping out Newports at the end of the bench. If you do a little digging, you can find his best work was off the court alongside Juwan Howard, Ben Wallace and Ashraf Amaya in Crystal Waters’ adult contemporary hit Say If You Feel Alright.\n\n34) Andris Biedriņš (2004-2011) Biedriņš (pronounced like ‘Goodrich’ with a B) used to give the BEST post-game interviews ever. He couldn’t hit a free throw with a pair of boxing gloves (11.1 percent in his final season as a Warrior), but the Latvian center used to “always like inside. I like inside.” The poster boy for the Chris Mullin administration, in 2008, Biedriņš agreed to a six-year, $62 million deal. Totes worth it. The ultimate redemption? On July 5, 2013, the Warriors traded Biedriņš to the Utah Jazz along with Brandon Rush and Richard Jefferson to clear cap space that led to the acquisition of 2015 NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala.\n\n33) Dean Oliver (2001-2003) Prior to the quasi-successful (in Warrior terms) Earl Boykins regime, Oliver was the bumbling back-up point guard to Gilbert Arenas. Think about choosing between Arenas’ sociopathic antics and a guy dribbling the ball off his foot for two years. The early ‘00s sucked.\n\n32) Troy Murphy (2001-2007) Murphy, it could be argued, was also probably one of the Warriors’ top-20 guys of the last four decades (if there are 20 to be had on that list). The problem here is the 14th overall pick never quite lived up to the expectation he set his first two seasons. After averaging a double-double and finishing second in the league’s Most Improved Player voting in 2003-2004, a series of mystery injuries limited Murphy to 28 games, with no starts the following season. He would show regular flashes after that—nailing threes in garbage time and pulling 10 boards/night—but was eventually shipped as a player-to-be-named-later type in the Pacers’ deal.\n\n31) Chris Mullin (front office only: 2004-2009) I’ll never argue against Mullin and his shorts as one of the top five Warrior greats of all time on the court, but as Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations, Mullin’s was a more painful four-year stint than his first three rehabs. The Mullin administration was marked with bad trades (Pacers), unmotivated coaches (Mike Montgomery, Don Nelson, Keith Smart) and underperforming draft picks (Patrick O’Bryant, Marco Belinelli and Anthony Randolph). On May 11, 2009, Mullin was replaced by Larry Riley as the Warriors’ GM. A month later, Riley drafted Steph Curry 7th overall.\n\n30) Vladimir Radmanovic (2009-2011) This guy. This 6’10” Bosnian forward was just here for the Costco dogs and the unlimited access to jeans. He loved to shoot from beyond the arc and not get down in time to defend. America, what a country!\n\n29-28) Don Nelson (1988-1995 and 2006-2010) No other coach in NBA history will ever win as many games without winning in the playoffs. Love him or hate him, his Nellieball combined with Mike D’Antoni’s uptempo style of the early 2000s is the direct predecessor of the Warriors’ current game. Nellie had a genius mind and a terrible record of execution in crunch time. Overall, it could be said his ego held back the potentially great teams of the early 1990s but helped create the blueprint for today’s winners starting in 2009.\n\n27) Adonal Foyle (1997-2007) Sorry Adonal. I know you STILL lead the franchise in rebounds all-time and you write children’s books, but for a decade you were simply the best depiction of the Warriors continuing to be the face of mediocre in professional sport. At least you banked that six-year, $42 million contract in 2004.\n\n26) Jason Richardson (2001-2007) Hard to hate on J-Rich: MSU alum, back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest winner (‘02-’03) and still in the league as a utility player for the 76ers. I also think he did double-duty as the über mascot Thunder (see: #6) during time outs. Maybe he never had the right set pieces around him. Whatever it is that held him back, the Urban Dictionary still has a picture of him doing a reverse windmill under “Unrealized Potential.”\n\n25) Mike Montgomery (2004-2006) After a coach alienates himself from a pair of local NCAA programs, he gets promoted to the NBA. Part of my disdain for Montgomery comes from him being hired, for no reason, to replace Musselman. Any confidence Musselman was building in the team was quickly lit in fire and set out to sea. Montgomery didn’t have the chops to coach in the pros and point guard Baron Davis called him on it…literally by calling different plays on the floor. Two lottery-pick-grabbing seasons in purgatory and Monty was mercifully let go.\n\n24) Jiri Welsch (2002-2003) In the same draft where the Warriors had the worst pick ever: Yao was number one, Jay Williams number two and then…Mike Dunleavy Jr. to the Dubs, Golden State tried to make up for it by trading a pair of future draft picks to acquire Welsch when they could’ve just traded down and gotten Amar’e Stoudemire at no. 9. Welsch couldn’t play defense, break to the basket or shoot—at all. After a year of garbage time, he was shipped to Dallas in the Antawn Jamison trade.\n\n23) Patrick O’Bryant (2006-2008) Nobody gets mad about Patrick O’Bryant because nobody remembers Patrick O’Bryant other than “wasn’t that the name of an Irish bar that used to be on College near 51st?” O’Bryant brought the Warriors the luck of nothing as the 9th overall pick in ‘06. Don Nelson benched him immediately which resulted in O’Bryant appearing in only 40 games during his professional tenure with Golden State.\n\n22) Vince Carter (1998) A Warrior for 10-minutes, not even enough time to get a jersey/hat photo op with David Stern. This future hall of famer, who made a cameo in the second round against the Warriors this year as a reserve for the Grizzlies, was immediately and inexplicably traded to Toronto on draft day 1998. Carter was initially drafted by the Dubs with the fifth overall pick, and then traded to the Raptors for Antawn Jamison, the fourth overall pick. Were the Raptors like, “Oh wait, just kidding, we got the wrong Tar Heel” and swapped? Either way, Canada was right.\n\n21) Todd Fuller (1996-1998) We all know Fuller was taken 11th overall in 1996 (two picks ahead of Kobe Bryant), but he also dropped 14 on Jordan in the first half one night in Oakland in ’97. I was at that game. It was beautiful. Still, this pick came at the 20-year mark—the halfway point of the Warriors’ inadequacy—and ushered in two more decades of the same.\n\n20) Joe Barry Carroll (1980-1984) The future of the franchise the franchise franchised its future for (see: #16 Robert Parish) left the Warriors to go play in Italy. Thanks bro.\n\n19) Bobby Humbles (1978) The Warriors’ 9th rounder that year. Never saw one minute. Just, why are you drafting a guy named Bobby Humbles?\n\n18) Brandon Wright (2007-2011) I think the Tar Heel the Warriors got in Harrison Barnes is the Tar Heel they thought they were getting in Brandon Wright. Four spotty and injury-filled seasons and Wright finished his time in blue and gold having played fewer than 100 games. He was the next Jason Richardson like Billy Owens was the next Mitch Richmond.\n\n17) Mickael Pietrus (2003-2008) 2003’s 11th overall pick was French.\n\n16) Robert Parish (1976-1980) Parish hated Golden State (fresh off a title win his rookie year) so much that he wanted to quit basketball after a handful of seasons on the West Coast. Enter Boston, which traded their 1980 first pick (see: #20 Joe Barry Carroll) and the 13th pick (Rickey Brown) in 1980 for Parish and the rights to the 3rd pick (Kevin McHale). Parish and McHale hung banners for the Celts in 1981, 1984 and 1986 and the trade is remembered as one of the worst in NBA history—made possible through Parish’s disgruntled repose.\n\n15) Michael McDonald (1995) The 55th overall pick of the 1995 draft played four minutes in the NBA and grabbed half a rebound. Oh, but you should see him live at Red Rocks.\n\n14) Monta Ellis (2005-2012) Scootergate notwithstanding, Ellis put in some real time during some real uncertain years in a Warriors uniform. That said, the Lanier High School grad never quite lived up to the superstar status his tattoos connote. Mercifully, on March 13, 2012, Ellis, Ekpe Udoh and Kwame Brown were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Andrew Bogut and Stephen Jackson—giving Monta’s ankle injury-prone understudy Steph Curry control of the team. Addition by subtraction is what lands Ellis at no. 14.\n\n13) Steve Logan (2002) 2002’s second rounder never located the Warriors’ practice facility on his GPS. Steve Logan, if you’re out there, let us know so we can send you some schwag.\n\n12) Al Harrington (2007-2008) Harrington was the Warriors’ most-coveted for years and once he was brought over from Indiana, finished the second half of the 2007 season looking like he and Monta could captain a winner. The quick courtship was over by early 2008 when Harrington sat himself because his back hurt. Harrington was sent to the Knicks shortly after for Jamal Crawford.\n\n10) Mike Dunleavy Jr. (2002-2007) With Yao Ming and Jay Williams plucked off the draft board, the Warriors took the willowy no. 3 with the NBA pedigree. After two disappointing seasons, the Dubs compounded the problem with a five-year, $44 million contract extension for MDJ in 2005. Dunleavy, soft and pasty on and off the floor, was later the marquee name in the Pacers trade…where he promptly found his physicality and stroke for Larry Bird.\n\n9) (9-way tie) Lewis Jackson, Steve Bartek, Scott McCollum, Tony Martin, Cliff Higgins, Paul Brozovich, Mitch Arnold, Tim Bell: Golden State’s third through tenth-round picks (back when the draft had 10 rounds) in 1984—all of whom combined for zero minutes, zero points, zero assists, zero rebounds…you get the picture.\n\n8) Derek Fisher (2004-2006) All I can say is: Fuck Derek Fisher. After starring at point for the Lakers, the Warriors signed Fisher to a six-year, $37 million deal in 2004. Instead of a free agent, it was like they’d signed a double agent. Fisher showed up, collected his paycheck and showed no flash (beyond exploring new and creative ways to brick threes, create turnovers or curb momentum). Fisher was then relegated to Salt Lake City where he came back with his final fuck you to the Dubs as his brilliance effectively ended the Warriors’ 2007 playoff run just 10 days after they dethroned the top-seeded Mavericks.\n\n7) Latrell Sprewell (1992-1999) In 1997, Sprewell choked Warriors’ head coach P.J. Carlesimo after P.J. yelled at Latrell to put a little mustard on his passes in practice. Practice. We talkin’ about practice. But Latrell went on to choke it up even more in the playoffs missing key shots in post-season appearances with the Dubs, Knicks and Timberwolves—the latter after creating the league’s best regular-season offense with KG then kowtowing to the Lakers in 2004’s Western Conference Championship.\n\n6) Thunder (1994-2006) The Warriors made the playoffs in 1993 and 2007 and that’s all you need to know about the spandex-clad pansexual flip-and-dunk mascot Thunder. RIP.\n\n5) Gilbert Arenas (2001-2003) The brilliant-but-psychotic Arenas doesn’t rank number one because he prematurely ran himself out of town. Do a quick Google search on Arenas and you get a grab-bag of Travis Bickle-type behavior. My favorite incident happened just this week. The WaPo’s headline says it all: Gilbert Arenas destroys own vehicle over lost Netflix password. Classic Arenas.\n\n4) Billy Owens (1991-1993) I wouldn’t be this mad at the former Orangeman if he wasn’t 1) traded for Mitch Richmond, exiling Richmond to Sacramento and 2) widely regarded by NBA scouts as the all-time gold standard for lazy fuck (in a league full of lazy fucks).\n\nAnd last but not least, A Tale of Three Chrises:\n\n3) Chris Webber (1993-1994) It’s not just that the Dubs franchised their future for the Fab 5’s frenzied leader plucking him from the Orlando Magic in exchange for Anfernee Hardaway PLUS three future first round draft picks—building the closest thing Orlando’s ever come to a dynasty—but after a year in Golden State, Webber opted out and the Dubs had to fire-sell the wayward Wolverine to the Washington Bullets. I don’t wish any man harm, but I also wasn’t sad when his Center Court with C-Webb restaurants in Sac went under in 2009. Call timeout again bro.\n\n2) Chris Cohan (1995-2010) Cohan doesn’t get enough credit for owning and maintaining the worst franchise in sports for 15 years then making a $400 million profit on it. The Warriors’ fortunes literally changed overnight when Cohan sold to Peter Guber and Joe Lacob for $450 million in July 2010 (not that those guys aren’t dickheads too—but at least they’re dickheads who like to win). The sale at least made Cohan liquid enough to go ahead and start paying off the $160 million in back taxes he owes the feds.\n\nAnd…\n\n1) Chris Gatling (1991-1995) Taken 16th overall, Gatling was supposed to be the muscle complement to the silky smooth Run TMC. Though he turned out to be a 10-point/seven rebound guy before being shipped to Miami along with Tim Hardaway and a churro, Shady Gatling was never a coach, teammate or fan favorite. Fast forward 20 years to him living in Arizona (tip-off number one) and being arrested in March as a kingpin of a giant illegal credit card and ID theft scam. Though Gatling faces living out the rest of Golden State’s current run behind bars, he can sleep soundly knowing that he is the worst Warrior of the last 40 years.\n\nSteve Kerr and David Blatt, both in their first year as head coaches, steered the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers to the most improbable NBA Finals match-up in league history. Now what?\n\nBy Andrew Pridgen\n\nThe most notable portion of ESPN’s confetti-soaked post-game after the Warriors got their (literal) heads on straight and dispatched of the irksome Houston Rockets Wednesday was a pan over to Draymond Green in a warm embrace with former coach and current color guy Mark Jackson. Jackson was welling up with tears as Green whispered in his free ear the code only pro athletes know.\n\nCo-commentator Mike Breen in a sticky moment tried to elicit a comment from Jackson. When asked how that embrace, and several others like it from members of his former team, made him feel, Jackson wiped a tear like a dad at graduation and said, “Proud.”\n\nHe meant it.\n\nFrom the onset, the Warriors front office, Bay Area scribes and the Dubs faithful tabbed Jackson with the label “player’s coach,” which translates to “not so hot with the dry erase board.” After the Warriors underachieved in last year’s playoff, bowing out to the Clippers in the first round, Kerr swapped spaces with Jackson, trading his headset for a pair of comfortable Men’s WareWearhouse loafers and a mouth full of pen cap.\n\nKerr not only led the one-year-wiser Warriors to their first NBA Finals since the Plymouth Gran Fury was rolling off the line but also gave the team—so rife with talent that its most-tenured All Star David Lee is easily spotted walking up and down the box seat rows handing out warm towels before the start of the fourth quarter—an identity.\n\nIt turns out the identity he found…was the one it already had.\n\nSteph Curry is the league’s reigning MVP. His daughter, Riley, is the league’s reigning press conference darling. Nice-guy Curry, once a candidate for early retirement with glass ankles, has spent six seasons toiling mostly in anonymity for the ersatz NBA franchise West whose mission was as ambiguous as the location its name suggests.\n\nSub-40-win seasons were the expectation for generations as the Golden State faithful considered the act of simply attending an NBA game revelatory. The players were similarly rewarded for showing up. I recall one particularly dire evening at Oracle in early 2004 when Adonal Foyle grabbed a rebound and the house lights went down. This was close enough to 9/11 that players and fans, figuring an inbound Southwest flight from Ontario was on its descent into the arena, stopped cold.\n\nSuddenly, the pre-game intro spotlight searched to locate the Warriors’ Ivy Patriot League-educated Canouan-born center like an escaped inmate in a Charles Bronson movie. Over the PA, the voice of Tina Turner singing “Simply the Best” echoed and the announcer came on and boomed: “Congratulations, Adonal. You are the Golden State Warriors’ all-time franchise leader for rebounds.”\n\nYes, they stopped the game.\n\nFoyle blushed, still frozen. A handful of his teammates smiled nervously as the opposition started to walk toward the visitors’ locker room hoping to get on standby. Pansexual team mascot Thunder violated his restraining order by rolling out on the court in his blue unitard, handing Foyle the game ball.\n\nIt was the middle of the first quarter.\n\nAnd that, friends, is what being a Warriors fan has been like since Tatum O’Neal took the hill for Chico’s Bail Bonds’ Bears.\n\nThe other half of this improbable finals equation is an even more unlikely story.\n\nIf Kerr has the championship pedigree and the schoolboy charm, the Cavs’ head cat-wrangler David Blatt is the Strongsville Subway franchise owner who couldn’t find his promo seats so took the empty one next to the scorer’s table. The Blatt hire seemed something of an interim move for a Cavaliers franchise whose hand was suddenly, without warning, forced by the return home of its prodigal son. There was no welcome mat ready much less a house to put behind it.\n\nA franchise that lost Akron’s remaining revenue-generating export just a presidential term earlier to the siren song of jorts and thongs in South Beach was in the midst of its own reclamation project. A trio of promising lottery picks and a still-eager fan base were the building blocks of a contender.\n\nLeBron’s re-emergence on the shores of the fiery Cuyahoga sped everything up. Suddenly, pretty boy power forward Kevin Love was suiting up next to the only man this side of David Blaine qualified to have “Chosen One” ink occupy the vastness between shoulder blades. Faster than a dying phone’s fade to black, the future former number one picks Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Bennett—once so eager on the Twitters to learn at the pleasure of the King—found themselves mired in Minnesota.\n\nThings didn’t go well at first. Though the joyful reunion was merely five months in the past, James and his handlers put word to the street that the King in his prime would pull the plug on The Forest City if things didn’t gel the right way right away.\n\nAfter a respectable but underwhelming 18-12 start, on Dec. 30 reports from Cavs beat writer Chris B. Haynes noted a lack of chemistry on the court (especially with Love). That, along with James feeling a little mortality on his 30th birthday, would result in 23 exercising his free agency opt-out after this season if things in the home state continued to slide into mediocrity, Haynes reported.\n\nCue jersey + lighter fluid.\n\nImmediately, the camera lights turned on Blatt—fomenting the notion that the Hebrew Hoosier was simply there to act as scapegoat should things not go well for LBJ II: On the Move. That Blatt, a Princeton grad who played professional hoops (in Israel) for nine years, is better suited for the Boys’ U12 head coach gig at the JCC of Greater Five Towns handing out orange slices garnished with capers and Dixie cups of Manischewitz at halftime.\n\nFrom the onset, Blatt seemed outmatched: unable to corral LeBron and unable to get the rest of the team to used to playing with LeBron. A task better suited for a new agey hoops guru like Phil Jackson; or maybe cause to dust off Pat Riley’s Brylcreem cannister for one more go-around.\n\nLeBron, in other words, still needed a mentor-coach. Someone who understood the trappings that went with coaching up your Magics and Michaels.\n\nThe difference is, and in every good way imaginable, LeBron is neither of those two. He’s the Radiohead to Jordan and Johnson’s Beatles. They got to write all the songs because the songs simply hadn’t been written yet. LeBron has had to carve out his own identity in the age of athleticism; forge a lasting legacy in the age of instant gratification; make Samsung viable in the age of Apple.\n\nMore than any of LeBron’s coaches to date, Blatt has stayed out of the way and let it happen. Stepping in only when necessary, like telling LeBron to put his headband back on. The timing started to click and the results have been dramatic. Cleveland gets a second chance to win its first-ever championship.\n\nJust as chef Curry has started to sprinkle in his own up-tempo offensive sets just east of Hegenberger, LeBron has coaxed deliciousness from his own sourced ingredients: Kyrie Irving, JR Smith, James Jones, Mike Miller and…Matthew Dellavedova (Love is injured and out for the finals). He’s turned also-rans into a winner built in his image: A passing-first mentality, stingy on defense and physical and smart—basically every sideline superlative in the basketball dictionary dumped out on the court.\n\nWhat you’re about to see in this NBA Finals—a pair of rookie coaches squaring off for a pair of franchises that aren’t used to being in contention after Halloween—has never happened before. This impossible matchup of two terminal losers has the potential to go down as the finest brand of professional basketball in this era.\n\nAnd maybe a David Blatt or a Steve Kerr will use this opportunity to springboard into the Jackson/Riley guru-o-sphere.\n\nIt could happen. After all, they’re being coached up by the best. And the best just happen to be on the floor."
