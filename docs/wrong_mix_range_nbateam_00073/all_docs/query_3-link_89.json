        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Andrew Wiggins won’t suit up for Monday night’s game against the Indiana Pacers while Jordan Poole’s availability remains up in the air.\n\nWiggins was downgraded to out Monday afternoon as he deals with right adductor (thigh) tightness. He was previously listed as questionable for the final game of this homestand along with Poole, who tweaked his ankle in the second half of Saturday’s win over the Houston Rockets. Poole is still listed as questionable for the game.\n\nAndre Iguodala will join Wiggins in street clothes for Monday’s game. The 38-year-old veteran has yet to play a game this season as the team’s training staff gradually ramps him up to game speed after he spent most of the season under the notion he was retired.\n\nIt’s unclear the severity of Wiggins’ injury. Coach Steve Kerr is scheduled to speak with the media at 5:15 p.m.\n\nWiggins and Poole combined for 57 points Saturday in what was their best combined offensive output of the season.\n\nWiggins tied a career high with eight 3s — five of which were drained during an explosive 17-point third quarter for the veteran wing who signed a four-year extension at the start of the season. He finished with a season-best 36 points as well as five rebounds, two assists and two steals. Meanwhile, Poole added 21 points, two rebounds, five assists and a steal.\n\nThe Warriors (13-11) have won two consecutive games and 10 straight at Chase Center. Meanwhile, the Pacers (12-11) are looking to snap a three-game losing skid. They are playing the second night of a back-to-back after falling to the Portland Trail Blazers 116-100 Sunday.\n\nAfter Monday’s game, the Warriors will hit the road to play the Utah Jazz Wednesday in Salt Lake City."
