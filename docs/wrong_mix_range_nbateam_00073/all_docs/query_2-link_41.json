        "text": "For the third time in nine years, FSU has knocked off a top-ranked Duke team that came to Tallahassee as the heavy favorites. Unlike 2002 when an undefeated Duke team led by Jason Williams, Mike Dunleavy Jr., and Carlos Boozer lost to a Seminole team that had lost to American just a few weeks earlier, or 2006 when a 27-1 Duke team led by J.J. Redick and Shelden Williams lost to a mediocre Seminole squad, this FSU team has the potential to be a solid team despite what their loss to Auburn last week might indicate.\n\nWhile most of the media will point to poor shooting nights by Kyle Singler and Nolan Smith and bemoan the continued absence of Kyrie Irving, when Coach K addresses his team his primary focus should be on the Blue Devilsâ complete lack of production on the inside. As Luke Winn astutely pointed out a month ago when Irving first went down, the distribution of the ball would change significantly, but even he failed to predict the precipitous decline in production that we are seeing from Mason Plumlee, who has only scored more than four points once in eight games since Irving was injured. The Blue Devils had so little on the inside tonight that they ended up taking 35 out of their 61 shots (57%) from beyond the arc, which would appear to indicate either a lack of a presence or confidence on the inside. To be fair to Plumlee, he was productive on the glass, grabbing 14 rebounds, and FSU is very tough to play against down low (ask Jared Sullinger who âonlyâ had 11 points and 13 rebounds earlier this year). Still, Duke needs him to step up and become a presence on the inside like he was earlier in the season (25 points and 12 rebounds against Marquette) if they expect to compete with Ohio State with Jared Sullinger or Kansas with Marcus and Markieff Morris while they wait/pray for Irving to come back.\n\nHaving said that, we need to congratulate Leonard Hamilton and the Seminoles. Derwin Kitchen was a load on the inside today, putting up 22 points and pulling 10 rebounds while Chris Singleton added 18 points to go along with his usual outstanding defense. We also want to tip our hats to their fans for a solid RTC at the end that was performed safely but effectively and in an appropriate setting. While we wait on video of tonightâs RTC to appear on the Internet we recommend you check out the last 20.5 seconds of FSUâs upset of Duke in 2002.\n\nOver the course of the next month until the NBA Draft on June 24, RTC will be rolling out comprehensive profiles of the 30-35 collegians we feel have the best chance to hear their names called by David Stern in the first round that night. There wonât be any particular order to the list, but you can scroll back through all the finished profiles by clicking here.\n\nPlayer Name: Daniel Orton\n\nSchool: Kentucky\n\nHeight/Weight: 6â10/255\n\nNBA Position: Power Forward/Center\n\nProjected Draft Range: Late First Round\n\nOverview: If you needed any further proof that the NBA Draft selects players on potential and not on actual past performance, look no further than Daniel Orton. Thatâs not to say that Orton didnât produce for Kentucky in his one season there. He certainly did everything that was expected of him, and did it well. But weâre talking about a player who averaged 3.4 points, 3.3 rebounds, and just 13.1 minutes a game. That said, Orton was excellent in his role as a backup to DeMarcus Cousins and Patrick Patterson as needed, excelling on defense, specifically shot-blocking, and showing enough raw offensive skills to have the scouts salivating. He only hit double-figures twice all season, but thatâs just because of the limited minutes. With talent like this, if heâd have gotten the time (or stayed in school longer) his numbers would have probably been about triple what they were.\n\nWill Translate to the NBA: Ortonâs body was NBA-ready by the time he played his first college game. He frequently uses that size to overpower defenders on his way to the basket and finish with confidence. Though it could stand a little more arch, his jumper is fairly solid at this early stage. He is physically imposing but actually has very nice touch on his shot after a post move and certainly as he gets right up to the rim. On the defensive side, heâs way ahead of the curve in terms of shot-blocking ability, and that skill is evident whether heâs guarding his man straight up or if heâs leaving his man and helping from the weak side.\n\nNeeds Work: Orton played so little compared to a lot of prospects, teams just donât have that much to go on. He had surgery on his left knee during his last year of high school, and while he never appeared to be favoring it, there were times when simple post moves or getting up the floor on a break seemed a little harder than one would think. Because heâs going to make his living down low, heâs going to be getting to the free throw line a lot, and raising his percentage up from the 52% he shot at Ketnucky (to be fair, that was also his field goal percentage) is required. Finally, it was a single incident, but the in-game sideline spat with coach John Calipari in the SEC Tournament was highly publicized, and Orton didnât help his image by actually leaving the bench and going back to the locker room, even if he was under orders. Heâll need to convince teams that his headâs in the right place and he wonât make a habit of openly questioning authority.\n\nComparison Players: Ortonâs use of his physique to do things like create space for shots, set screens, and out-muscle opponents for rebounds reminds us of Leon Powe of the Cleveland Cavaliers. If a Kentucky example is needed, his physique brings to mind the Rocketsâ Chuck Hayes; like Hayes, Ortonâs greatest value to an NBA team will come on defense. Hayes is a little quicker, but Orton actually has a higher offensive ceiling.\n\nBest Case Scenario: The key to Daniel Ortonâs success will be patience. He has the body and all the tools to carve out a very nice decade-long NBA career, if not longer. But because heâs being drafted largely on potential, the team that drafts him will need to see some of that potential become realized in practice and in limited game time before theyâll really unleash him. Thatâs not the easiest thing for young players to accept. If he can show off his defensive abilities enough through hard work in practice, heâll get more minutes in games, and then the offensive chances will come. If heâs satisfied with that, after a few seasons his game could be refined enough to where heâll find a niche on a team that needs a tough-nosed, hard-rebounding, âglue-guyâ type of player that the fans love, the type of player that embodies the hard work coaches would like to see out of their whole roster.\n\n2013 Projection: The process described above will still be happening after three seasons. We wouldnât be surprised to see him start to get increased minutes late in his third season and thereafter. Up to that point, weâd expect Orton to have made an early living as a rebounding and shot-blocking specialist while the full range of his offensive game continues to grow.\n\nBest NBA Fit: Orton will be taken almost right in the middle of the draft, and while Oklahoma City (21st and 26th pick) needs front line help in a major way â and itâs a pick that would land Orton back in his home state â the best fit for him as far as teams in that range is the Boston Celtics (19th pick). Despite their post-season success, Boston was one of the worst rebounding teams in the league (29th of 30) and averaged a -1.5 rebounding margin. If Kendrick Perkinsâ knee remains suspect and the retirement rumors about Rasheed Wallace are true, the Celtics would be left without a true center, and the third man on the depth chart at PF would be the unimpressive Shelden Williams. Plus, you could do a lot worse than to have Kevin Garnett as a teammate and mentor.\n\nOver the next two days in a series of separate posts, RTC will break down all 32 of the first round games using our best analytical efforts to understand these teams, the matchups and their individual strengths and weaknesses. Our hope is that youâll let us know in the comments where you agree, disagree or otherwise think weâve lost our collective minds. Here are the Friday evening games.\n\n7:10 pm â #8 Gonzaga vs. #9 Florida State (Buffalo pod)\n\nThis is a very tough game to call, so letâs start with what we know about it. The Zags, no stranger to cross-country travel, come into Buffalo after an 11-day layoff where St. Maryâs took Mark Fewâs team behind the woodshed and beat them handily in the WCC Tournament championship. Florida State comes in having dropped its quarterfinal game against NC State in an effort that had their fans shaking their heads in disgust. So needless to say, both teams are looking for a fresh start here. The Zags are always dangerous, and this yearâs squad led by Matt Bouldin and Elias Harris has the offensive firepower to score with just about anyone in America. Merely an ok three-point shooting team, they tend to rely on the drives of Harris and mid-range game of Bouldin to create offense. However, they donât tend to respond well to teams that crowd and push them around, but unfortunately, FSU is just such a team. The Seminoles enjoy the nationâs top defensive efficiency, and while they have the opposite problem of finding points, they should have no problem putting the clamps down on the Zag scoring options. The question here comes down to whether the FSU defense, anchored by 7â1 Solomon Alabi and 6â9 Chris Singletonâs combined four blocks per game, is better than the Gonzaga offense, and we think that it is. And as up/down as the Seminoles were in the ACC, they never came close to losing to the likes of Loyola Marymount and San Francisco, as Gonzaga did this year.\n\nThe Skinny: The Zags this year arenât quite as good as they usually are, and theyâre facing a team that will shut down their biggest strength. FSU wins this one by eight points to get a date with Syracuse.\n\n7:15 pm â #7 Oklahoma State vs. #10 Georgia Tech (Milwaukee pod)\n\nHereâs another one thatâs got people confused. For good reason, too. All year long weâve been waiting on Georgia Tech to do something with all that talent, and now theyâre playing better basketball, just in time. Oklahoma Stateâs showing against Kansas State in the Big 12 Tournament will cost them some support, but weâre going to excuse that performance. That was a tired basketball team, playing their third game in a six day span with K-State at the end of it â and the Wildcats were coming off of a five-day rest. Georgia Tech is going to go inside to Derrick Favors and Gani Lawal like crazy, but when the Yellow Jackets actually shoot the three, they shoot it well. Defending the three is a glaring OSU weakness, so it will be interesting to see how often Georgia Tech eschews their big men in favor of launching it from the arc, because those shots will be there. Soâ¦good outside shooting, great inside playersâ¦sounds pretty good for Tech, right? The question will be whether or not they can get to that point in their offense. Georgia Tech ranks in the bottom twenty of Division I teams in terms of turning the ball over. Can the Jackets, then, find a way to keep James Anderson from shredding them or Keiton Page from raining threes?\n\nThe Skinny: Oklahoma State wonât have to exert too much energy guarding the three, since Techâs propensity to turn the ball over will take care of some of that. The Cowboys have been getting more and more help from their role players, and we feel 9-7 in the Big 12 is better than 7-9 in the ACC this year. Itâll be a great first round game, but we like Oklahoma State in a close one.\n\nRead the rest of this entry Â»\n\nEd. Note: for all of the posts in the RTC 09-10 Class Schedule series, click here.\n\nThe ACC has been North Carolinaâs league for three straight seasons now. With four prolific stars departing from Roy Williams roster, this could be the year Duke re-claims supremacy in the most fabled conference in college basketball. The loss of athletic swingman Gerald Henderson early to the riches of the NBA hurts, but the late inclusion of a young point guard to compliment two potential blue-chip power forwards and the dynamic duo of Jon Scheyer and Kyle Singler means Duke has the goods to capture their first ACC regular season title since J.J. Redick and Shelden Williams manned the Cameron Indoor Stadium floor.\n\nLetâs face it: this program hasnât quite featured the mystique and aura that normally comes with Duke basketball since the heartbreaking loss to UConn in the 2004 Final Four. Dukeâs pinnacle has been the Sweet 16 since that crushing blow and critics are lining up over whether coach Mike Krzyzewskiâs Olympic conquests are hurting the program. Still, a top-two ACC finish and an Elite Eight seem like reasonable goals for this Duke team that only lost Henderson, transfer Elliot Williams, quarterback Greg Paulus and glue guy David McClure. Three top-50 recruits and four of the Blue Devilsâ top five scorers return for a squad looking to knock an inexperienced North Carolina team off the mantle.\n\nHow does everyoneâs favorite hoops team stack up schedule-wise? Letâs examine:\n\nNon-Conference Schedule Rank: 8. Duke normally doesnât back down from challenging their team in non-conference play, so their participation in the NIT Season Tip-Off and neutral/road games against Georgetown, Wisconsin, Gonzaga, Iowa State and St. Johnâs doesnât surprise me. The Blue Devils normally excel in November and their only formidable foe in the NIT tournament this year is Connecticut. Theyâd match up in the finals if Duke can slide past Coastal Carolina, Charlotte and most likely an Arizona State team that lost both James Harden and Jeff Pendergraph. A November 27 final against UConn at MSG would certainly not lack for entertainment. The ACC-Big Ten challenge pits Duke a difficult road game at the Kohl Center, a venue where Wisconsin rarely loses. Neutral floor games against Gonzaga in NYC and Iowa State in Chicago are included, along with a January 30 visit to Georgetown to face a Hoya team that could be a well-oiled machine at that point. Conference USA favorite Tulsa also makes a trip to Cameron in late February, which has the potential to be dangerous for Duke. The non-conference slate certainly presents challenges, and credit Coach K for agreeing to send Duke to places other than Durham for tests that will certainly benefit the Blue Devils come ACC play.\n\nCupcake City: Only six true cupcakes on the slate for Duke this season as UNC Greensboro, Coastal Carolina (part of the NIT), Radford, Gardner-Webb, Long Beach State and Penn travel to Durham (although I should count Charlotte the way they played last season). A program with Dukeâs stature doesnât have to schedule Gonzaga in NYC or travel to Chicago to play Iowa State, but they do anyway. Unlike Washington, Duke will be battle-tested for conference play and their computer numbers will give the Blue Devils a boost when it comes to seeding debates. Duke is usually in the top-ten in RPI every single season and thereâs a reason why.\n\nRead the rest of this entry Â»\n\nEd. Note: Check the category team of the 2000s for our other entries in this feature.\n\nAs we mentioned in our earlier âTeam of the 2000sâ posts, we felt that the top-tier programs fell into a few clear clusters. There was some debate amongst the RTC braintrust about where certain teams fell within those clusters so we can understand if you disagree with where a team is ranked (thatâs what the comment section is for). Teams in the top five either have made it to every NCAA tournament this decade (a sign of at least being respectable every season) or have a 2nd championship to bolster their case.\n\n#4 â Duke\n\nOverview. This will be the most controversial selection on the list because it is Duke. Love them or hate them (and Iâm pretty sure that most college basketball fans hate them), the Blue Devils remain the standard that other programs are judged against. That is not to say that they are the best program of the decade (there are still three teams ahead of them), but much like the New York Yankees, who are experiencing a similar title âdrought,â every fanbase judges their success against what the guys in Durham are doing. To be completely honest, I ranked Duke lower than any of the other voters, but in the end their consistency (particularly during the regular season) won out and put them ahead of some of the other elite programs. The case for Duke being ranked above the teams below it in our countdown: 82.6% (regular season winning percentageâGonzaga is the only other team to crack 80% and they donât play in the ACC); 7 post-season and 4 regular season ACC titles (just an absurd number when you are competing against UNC although UNCâs inconsistency helped inflate this); 10 NCAA tournament trips (look at the above summary to see how often many excellent programs have missed the NCAA tournament this decade); 8 Sweet 16 appearances (maybe Duke hasnât been that successful during the 2nd weekend, but they have gotten there more than anybody else); and 1 national title (more on this in a bit). The case against the Blue Devils? I alluded to it earlier, as Coach Kâs teams have struggled mightily in the NCAA second weekend making it to the Final 4 âjustâ two out of the eight times they made it to the Sweet 16. In addition, Dukeâs absence of a 2nd title prevents it from claiming a spot in the top 3. Out of the teamâs below it, Tom Izzoâs Michigan State Spartans have the best argument, but Dukeâs vastly superior winning percentage (82.6% vs. 72.1%) and huge edge in conference titles combined with playing in a better conference (the ACC may be down, but you never see an abomination like this come out of the ACC) and NCAA-best 8 trips to the Sweet 16 (versus 6 for the Spartans) are just enough to make up for Michigan Stateâs edge in Final 4 appearances (4-2 although both teams were only able to seal the deal once).\n\nPinnacle. As it is with any team that won a single title this decade, the choice here is simple: the 2001 title. After coming up just short with one of the most talented teams in recent history in 1999, Coach K reloaded with a class featuring Jason Williams, Mike Dunleavy Jr., and Carlos Boozer. Although not quite as dominant as the group that left just before they came in (Elton Brand, William Avery, and Corey Maggette â I know he was a year after the other two, but I wasnât going to include Chris Burgess in there), the former was able to do something the latter failed to do â win a title. Together with Shane Battier, who led the Blue Devils emotionally and in taking flops, this group made it to the Sweet 16 in 2000 before being upset by Florida. The following year the Blue Devils were able to give Coach K his 3rd title, but not before surviving three marginally tough games (vs. USC in the Elite 8, vs. Maryland in the national semifinals, and vs. Arizona in the championship game) to claim the title. The defining moment of that title game was Dunleavy Jr.âs 3-point barrage (three 3-pointers during an 11-2 run) that re-established Dukeâs control of the game. One thing that will stick with Blue Devil fans forever though is their four games against Maryland, which were some of the best college basketball games you will ever see, the most memorable being the 10-point comeback in the last minute at College Park (although we are willing to debate with someone who argues that the 22-point comeback in the national semifinals might be better).\n\n[Warning: Maryland fans may want to avoid this video.]\n\nTailspin. Other than the two UNC titles? The 2006-07 season. A rather mediocre Duke team went 22-11 in a season that included two separate four-game losing streaks. The latter of those losing streaks came to finish the season with the final insult coming courtesy of Eric Maynor and VCU. Much has been made on this site and others about the lack of elite talent in Durham lately, but fielding a team whose four best players were DeMarcus Nelson (junior), Josh McRoberts (sophomore), Greg Paulus (sophomore), and Jon Scheyer (freshman)â¦ you are in big trouble. The primary explanation for this was that outside of Shelden Williams and J.J. Redick, the Blue Devils had a long string of McDonaldâs All-American busts from 2002 on, with Shavlik Randolph, who left prior to that, being the most famous example.\n\nOutlook for the 2010s: Grade: B+. Duke is still Duke and can land 5-star recruits, but itâs not like it was at the end of the last decade when Duke had its choice of McDonaldâs All-Americans. Back then, one of the big controversies was if Coach K made the right choice taking Mike Dunleavy Jr. instead of Casey Jacobsen (for the younger generation of readers trust us when we say they were both actually very good college basketball players). Now it is a big deal when Duke lands the #3 shooting guard in next yearâs class instead of John Wall. Duke will still be able to get a couple of top-notch recruits every year because of their tradition (it goes back to before Coach K, youngsters), Notre Dame-like TV deal with ESPN, Coach Kâs stature, and the fact that itâs one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the country (mothers like to brag about the Duke degree even if it is for the infamous Sociology major). However, the Blue Devils have fallen a notch below UNC in the hearts and minds of elite recruits and that will only get worse when Coach K retires (gasp!) as their is no clear successor in line for his throne.\n\nWith the news Wednesday that Duke whiffed on PF Patrick Patterson (who opted for Kentucky over Duke and Florida), combined with yesterdayâs news that Roy Williams has extended his contract with UNC through the 2014-15 season, we started to wonder if weâre seeing an unusual blip in Durham, or if last season and the presumed immediate future signal a larger problem there.\n\nBe-Deviled?\n\nThe last time Duke had such a blip was in the mid-90s. In 1995, with Coach Kâs back hurting and Pete Gaudet at the helm for two-thirds of the season, Duke went 13-18 (2-14) and did not make the NCAA Tournament. There has been considerable harping over the years about whose record (Kâs or Gaudetâs) all those losses should fall on, but at the time, it wasnât a leap to see that even when Duke was 9-3 in early January 1995, a team led by the likes of Cherokee Parks and Jeff Capel (as opposed to Grant Hill, Bobby Hurley or Christian Laettner) was flawed. This was especially true in light of a stacked ACC that season (Each of Duncan, Wallace, Stackhouse, Childress and Joe Smith were all-americans in 1995).\n\nThe next season, when K was back on the bench, shows just how far the talent level at Duke had fallen. The 1995-96 team only performed five games better than its predecessor, going 18-13 (8-8) and losing both its first round ACC Tourney game and its first round NCAA game (by 15 pts) toâ¦ Eastern Michigan? The following year, 1996-97, Duke only got marginally back on track. The Devils finished with a 24-9 (12-4) record and won the ACC regular season, but they flamed out early again in the postseason, inexplicably losing to #8 seed NC State in the quarters of the ACC Tourney and barely scraping by Murray St. in the first round before losing to #10 seed Providence (by 11 pts) in the second round of the NCAAs. Does this sound familiar at all? It should, as Duke just finished its 2006-07 campaign with a 22-11 (8-8) record, culminating in a first round ACC Tourney loss and a first round NCAA loss toâ¦ VCU.\n\nIs there cause for concern among Devil faithful, or is last yearâs mediocre regular season and short-lived postseason just an anomaly?\n\nRead the rest of this entry Â»"
