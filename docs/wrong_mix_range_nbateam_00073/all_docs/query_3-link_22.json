Please include your name, mailing address, and phone number along with the copy and photo.\n\nWe also need a copy of the death certificate or name and number of the funeral home to verify death.\n\nHOUSTON — Chris Paul will come off the bench for the first time in his NBA career in the Warriors’ game against the Houston Rockets on Sunday.\n\nPaul, who is in his 19th season, will snap a streak of 1,365 games, including the playoffs — 1,216 regular season games — as a starter and come off the bench to make way for Draymond Green to start in his season debut.\n\nGreen returns from an ankle sprain sustained in the days before training camp began on Oct. 2. He missed all of training camp and the Warriors’ first two regular-season games against the Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings. Green, 33, has been working to get back into game shape and will be on a minutes restriction, head coach Steve Kerr said before the game.\n\nGreen will start alongside Golden State’s go-to starting lineup the last two seasons alongside Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins and Kevon Looney.\n\nPaul, 38, has played for five teams, including the Warriors, and came off the bench in one of their preseason games against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nOriginally Published: October 29, 2023 at 3:34 p.m."
