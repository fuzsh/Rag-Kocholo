        "text": "As a historically relevant NBA franchise in a major media market, no shortage of All-Stars have been linked to the New York Knicks. So much so that those rumors are a universe unto themselves. Half fantasy and half reality, the constant speculation of who’ll be joining the Knicks is only matched by questions of who’ll be going to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nJust this year, 20-time All-Star LeBron James was said to have interest in signing with the Big Apple ballers. Frankly, it’s a scenario that could very well play out if James decides that the Los Angeles Lakers don’t have what it takes to win a championship before he retires. It’s a long shot though.\n\nAmong the marquee players firmly in their prime, Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker is the most recent star supposedly hoping to make his way to New York.\n\nHere’s what ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith had to say on Monday:\n\n“From what I’m being told, and probably I don’t know if it’ll ever happen, but Devin Booker wants to be in New York,” Smith said. “That’s what I’m being told. Now, he might deny it, I haven’t spoken to him, but I’m just telling you, the scuttlebutt in the NBA circles is that brother wants to be in New York.”\n\nIt must be noted that Smith isn’t exactly known for precise reporting.\n\nDespite his stature within sports media, he’s been repeatedly called out by players for alleged inaccuracies. However, while professional athletes often have an superhero-like persona to sports fans, it doesn’t mean they’re above misleading people publicly or privately. That said, only the parties privy to the specific information that Smith claims to have access to will ever truly know what’s occurred.\n\nDevin Booker Has No Interest in Joining Knicks\n\nPer PHNX Sports’ Gerald Bourguet, a member of Booker’s camp wholeheartedly disputes Smith’s assertion that Booker wants to play for the Knicks.\n\n“According to that source, the Knicks have been interested in Booker dating back to Leon Rose’s instatement as team president back in 2020. Rose, a former CAA player agent prior to being hired by New York, once served as Booker’s representation, and other Knicks personnel with connections to the 27-year-old Suns star recently put out feelers about his potential interest in coming to New York.\n\nBourguet adds that the Knicks’ interest in Booker is “one-sided.”\n\nThe outline of New York’s history courting Booker lends credence to his report. A New York native, Smith could very well have spoken to Knicks personnel about the matter himself. If so, he must have come away with a different interpretation (or been presented with a different view) of those “feelers.”\n\nNonetheless, based on Bourguet’s report, it appears that Booker respects the Knicks. He just doesn’t want to leave a team he’s helped bring back to championship contention. While that could change down the line, it doesn’t make sense for him to make that move now. Not while he has 14-time All-Star Kevin Durant beside him. A two-time NBA champion with the 10th-most point all-time (28,924).\n\nOf course, it’s unlikely that Booker or Durant expected to be eliminated in the First Round. They were met by adversity in the form of an early season injury to Bradley Beal and questionable roster construction. Yet, there are seven All-Star selections between him and Beal. While Booker had his best season as a facilitator, Beal and Durant excelled at both ends.\n\nPast the Disappointment\n\nLooking past the sting of disappointment, their Big 3 now has a chemistry-building season under their belt. With that and the return of sharpshooter Grayson Allen alone, the Suns could fare better next year.\n\nPhoenix must add a low usage point guard or get more creative with their ball-movement. They could stand to add defenders in the second unit. They also need to figure out Frank Vogel’s future. Yet, they’re in a better position than many teams.\n\nEven the Knicks don’t have a bonafide future Hall of Famer on the roster."
