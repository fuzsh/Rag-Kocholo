        "text": "HOUSTON — A little more than a year ago, Warriors guard Nick Young watched the 2017 Western Conference finals from sports bar in Los Angeles with a singular thought on his mind.\n\n“Man, I wish I could play in one of these games.”\n\nNow, with his Warriors leading the Houston Rockets 1-0 in the Western Conference finals, Young is looking to salvage his season against one of the few teams he has had success against this year.\n\nYoung continued the trend Monday night, scoring nine first-half points on 3-of-5 3-point shooting. In a season when he produced career lows in scoring (7.3), field-goal attempts (6.1) and assists (0.5), he averaged 16.7 points on 69 percent from the field in three regular-season games against the Rockets.\n\n“It’s funny how it works,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “I always felt that way as a player. There were a few teams that I really liked to play against. There was a guy that I knew I could match up with defensively or maybe it was the style of defense they played. It’s a good matchup defensively, they have a lot of guys his size, P.J. (Tucker), (Trevor) Ariza, (Eric) Gordon, guys that he can match up well with.”\n\nYoung’s familiarity with the Rockets’ roster could explain his success. During the summer, Young participated in the Nike Drew League summer pro-am tournament in Los Angeles alongside Rockets guard James Harden. As a youth, Ariza was a classmate at Mark Twain Middle School in Los Angeles.\n\n“A lot of [those] guys I know from just being back in the neighborhood,” Young said. We all got some of the same friends.”\n\nYoung’s relationships have even evolved into friendly competitive banter. During the season, Young would pick up his phone to find messages from the Rockets’ Tarik Black, a former Los Angeles Lakers teammate, saying, “Y’all not ready, Y’all not the same team.”\n\nLast summer, Young entered free agency coming off a season in which he averaged 13.2 points per game while shooting a career-high 40 percent from 3-point range with the Lakers. He could have made more money signing with another team, but chose Golden State. During his Warriors’ recruiting pitch in Marina Del Ray, Kerr, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green, told Young that his role will be limited if he wanted a ring.\n\n“There are going to be games that you start and there are going to be games you do not play and everything in between. But in the end, you’re playing for a championship,” Kerr told Young. “It beats the hell out of anything you’ve experienced as a player and I think he’s taken advantage.”\n\n“I’ve always wanted to be on this stage,” Young added Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWhen Young was 15 years old, his older brother Terrell drove him to downtown Los Angeles to see the Lakers celebrate their 2000 NBA title. Young, a die-hard Lakers fan, was amazed to see the crowd of 250,000 that was there to catch a glimpse of his idol, Kobe Bryant, and Shaquille O’Neal.\n\nIf all goes to plan in the next month, Young will be the one on a championship parade float, riding along the shores of Lake Merritt.\n\n“Its nothing like these moments,” Young said. “That’s what I signed up for. I’m not at the bar watching the games, I’m not at home watching Finals parties, I’m in it.”"
