        "text": "Central Division\n\nCLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\n- Last season: 53-29, lost to Golden State 4-2 in NBA Finals.\n\n- Starting five: G Kyrie Irving (21.7 ppg, 5.2 apg, 3.2 rpg), G J.R. Smith (12.7 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.5 apg), F LeBron James (25.3 ppg, 7.4 apg, 6.0 apg), F Kevin Love (16.4 ppg, 9.7 rpg, 2.2 apg), C Timofey Mozgov (10.6 ppg. 6.9 rpg, 1.2 bpg).\n\n- Key additions: G Mo Williams (free agent, Hornets), F Richard Jefferson (free agent, Mavericks), C Sasha Kaun (free agent, Russia).\n\n- Key losses: F Shawn Marion (retired).\n\n- Coach: David Blatt, second season with Cavaliers and overall; 53-29.\n\n- Eyes on: Irving. He starts the season on the sideline as he continues to recover from a fractured kneecap sustained in Game 1 of the Finals. There's no timetable on his return, leaving Williams to help James run Cleveland's offense. Irving emerged as one of the league's elite point guards, though is dogged by injuries. The Cavs need him to drive and create shots -- for himself and others.\n\n- Outlook: As long as the peerless James stays healthy, the Cavs should win the Eastern Conference and return to the Finals. Blatt seems more comfortable in his second year and better prepared to handle everything that comes with the grind of an NBA season.\n\nCHICAGO BULLS\n\n- Last season: 50-32, lost to Cleveland Cavaliers 4-2 in second round.\n\n- Starting five: G Derrick Rose (17.7 ppg, 4.9 apg, 3.2 rpg), G Jimmy Butler (20 ppg, 3.3 apg, 5.8 rpg), F Mike Dunleavy Jr. (9.4 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 1.8 apg), F Pau Gasol (18.5 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 2.7 apg), C Joakim Noah (7.2 ppg, 9.6 rpg, 4.7 apg).\n\n- Key additions: F Bobby Portis (draft, No. 22).\n\n- Key losses: None.\n\n- Coach: Fred Hoiberg, first season with Bulls and overall.\n\n- Eyes on: Hoiberg. The Bulls hope Hoiberg and his fast-paced offense make all the difference after they fired Tom Thibodeau following a falling out with management. A former Chicago player, Hoiberg led his alma mater Iowa State to a 115-56 record and back-to-back Big 12 tournament titles.\n\n- Outlook: The Bulls' success still largely hinges on Rose's ability to stay healthy, and he's recovering from a broken orbital bone -- his latest of many issues. Noah struggled last season after knee surgery, Gibson had ankle surgery in June, and Dunleavy had back surgery in September.\n\nMILWAUKEE BUCKS\n\n- Last season: 41-41, lost to Chicago Bulls 4-2 in first round.\n\n- Starting five: G Michael Carter-Williams (14.6 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 6.7 apg), G Khris Middleton (13.4 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 2.3 apg), F Giannis Antetokounmpo (12.7 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 2.6 apg), F Jabari Parker (12.3 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 1.7 apg), C-F Greg Monroe (15.9 ppg, 10.2 rpg, 2.1 apg).\n\n- Key additions: F-C Monroe (free agent, Pistons), F Chris Copeland (free agent, Pacers), G Greivis Vasquez (trade, Raptors); G Rashad Vaughn (draft, No. 17).\n\n- Key losses: F Ersan Ilyasova (trade, Pistons), C Zaza Pachulia (trade, Pistons), F Jared Dudley (trade, Wizards).\n\n- Coach: Jason Kidd, second season with Bucks and third overall; 85-79.\n\n- Eyes on: Parker. The Bucks are proceeding with caution with the second overall pick of the 2014 draft after Parker tore his left ACL 25 games into his rookie season.\n\n- Outlook: After a 41-win season and surprise run to the playoffs in Kidd's first year as coach, the Bucks are poised for long-term success with an emerging core.\n\nINDIANA PACERS\n\n- Last season: 38-44, missed playoffs.\n\n- Starting five: G George Hill (16.1 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 5.1 apg), G Monta Ellis (18.9 ppg, 4.1 apg, 1.9 spg), F C.J. Miles (13.5 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 1.1 apg), F Paul George (8.8 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 1.0 apg), C Ian Mahinmi (4.3 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 0.8 bpg)\n\n- Key additions: G Ellis (free agent, Mavericks), F Jordan Hill (free agent, Lakers), F/C Myles Turner (draft, No. 11), F Chase Budinger (trade, Timberwolves), G Toney Douglas (free agent, Pelicans), G Joe Young (draft, No. 43).\n\n- Key losses: C Roy Hibbert (trade, Lakers), F David West (free agent, Spurs), F Luis Scola (free agent, Raptors), G C.J. Watson (free agent, Magic).\n\n- Coach: Frank Vogel, sixth season with Pacers and overall; 205-144.\n\n- Eyes on: George. After missing all but six games last season with a broken right leg, the two-time All-Star hopes to find his old form. When George returned late last season, he wasn't the same player. But a summer of work has given him confidence and George has looked good in the preseason.\n\n- Outlook: Larry Bird thinks he has at least three legitimate double-digit scorers in George, Ellis and Hill. If George is healthy, Hill is as aggressive as he was late last season and Ellis plays like himself, the Pacers could be in the playoff hunt.\n\nDETROIT PISTONS\n\n- Last season: 32-50, missed playoffs.\n\n- Starting five: G Reggie Jackson (14.5 ppg, 6.0 apg, 4.2 rpg), G Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (12.7 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 1.3 apg), F Marcus Morris (10.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.6 apg), F Ersan Ilyasova (11.5 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.0 apg), C Andre Drummond (13.8 ppg, 13.5 rpg, 0.7 apg).\n\n- Key additions: Morris (trade, Suns), Ilyasova (trade, Bucks), F Stanley Johnson (draft, No. 8).\n\n- Key losses: F Greg Monroe (free agent, Bucks).\n\n- Coach: Stan Van Gundy, second season with Pistons and 10th overall, 403-258.\n\n- Eyes on: Johnson. The Pistons have had a hard time acquiring any major help via free agency in recent years, so they need to make good on their lottery picks. Johnson could fill a need on the wing.\n\n- Outlook: The Pistons haven't made the playoffs since 2009, and although Van Gundy's track record is a successful one, taking over in Detroit was a major challenge. The loss of Monroe means Drummond will be under pressure to take another big step toward stardom.\n\nAtlantic Division\n\nTORONTO RAPTORS\n\n- Last season: 49-33, lost to Washington Wizards 4-0 in first round.\n\n- Starting five: G Kyle Lowry (17.8 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 6.8 apg), G DeMar DeRozan (20.1 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 3.5 apg), F DeMarre Carroll (12.6 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 1.7 apg with Atlanta), F Patrick Patterson (8.0 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 1.9 apg), C Jonas Valanciunas (12.0 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 0.5 apg, 1.19 bpg).\n\n- Key additions: F Anthony Bennett (free agent, Timberwolves), F Bismack Biyombo (free agent, Hornets), F Carroll (free agent, Hawks), G Cory Joseph (free agent, Spurs), F Luis Scola (free agent, Pacers), G Delon Wright (draft).\n\n- Key losses: F Tyler Hansbrough (free agent, Hornets), C Chuck Hayes (free agent, Clippers), (F Amir Johnson (free agent, Celtics), C Greg Stiemsma (free agent, Magic), G Greivis Vasquez (trade, Bucks), G Lou Williams (free agent, Lakers).\n\n- Coach: Dwane Casey, fifth season with Raptors, seventh overall; 207-227.\n\n- Eyes on: Valanciunas. The fourth-year big man signed a four-year, $64 million contract extension in August after a season in which he averaged a career-best 12.0 points per game.\n\n- Outlook: Carroll and Joseph should help shore up a shaky defense, with Carroll's strong outside shooting another helpful addition. Toronto will expect to compete for a third straight Atlantic Division title.\n\nBOSTON CELTICS\n\n- Last season: 40-42, lost to Cleveland Cavaliers 4-0 in first round.\n\n- Starting five: G Marcus Smart (7.8 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 3.1 apg), G Avery Bradley (13.9 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 1.8 apg), F Jae Crowder (7.7 ppg, 3.6 rpg), F David Lee (7.9 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 1.7 apg), C Tyler Zeller (10.2 ppg, 5.7 rpg).\n\n- Key additions: Lee (trade, Warriors), G R.J. Hunter (draft, No. 28), F Amir Johnson (free agent, Toronto), G Terry Rozier (draft, No. 16).\n\n- Key losses: F Brandon Bass (free agent, Lakers).\n\n- Coach: Brad Stevens, third season with Celtics and overall; 65-99.\n\n- Eyes on: Lee. After falling out of the starting lineup for the NBA-champion Warriors, Lee will attempt to return to the form that made him a two-time All-Star. On this roster, he should get plenty of minutes and plenty of shots.\n\n- Outlook: After winning 24 of their past 36 games to make a surprise trip to the playoffs -- as the No. 7 seed -- the Celtics are hoping to take the next step. And, at any point, GM Danny Ainge could package some of his 17 draft picks (through 2018) for a star that would turn Boston into a contender.\n\nNEW YORK KNICKS\n\n- Last season: 17-65, missed playoffs.\n\n- Starting five: G Jose Calderon (9.1 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 4.7 apg), G Arron Afflalo (13.3 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 1.7 apg), F Carmelo Anthony (24.2 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 3.1 apg), F Kristaps Porzingis (rookie), C Robin Lopez (9.6 rpg, 6.7 rpg, 1.4 bpg).\n\n- Key additions: Porzingis (draft, No. 4), G Jerian Grant (draft, No. 19 by Atlanta, then traded to Knicks), Lopez (free agent, Trail Blazers), Afflalo (free agent, Trail Blazers), F Kevin Seraphin (free agent, Wizards), F Kyle O'Quinn (free agent, Magic), F Derrick Williams (free agent, Kings).\n\n- Key losses: F Andrea Bargnani (free agent, Nets), F Jason Smith (free agent, Magic), G Tim Hardaway Jr. (trade, Hawks).\n\n- Coach: Derek Fisher, second season with Knicks and overall; 17-65.\n\n- Eyes on: Porzingis. There are high hopes for Phil Jackson's first first-round pick, a 20-year-old Latvian who the Knicks list at 7 feet 3 inches. But there's also the fear of the bust factor from a fan base that remembers the Knicks getting little or nothing from Europeans Frederic Weis and Bargnani.\n\n- Outlook: Didn't get enough with their offseason moves to make themselves championship contenders, but probably got enough to easily improve off the worst season in franchise history and perhaps compete for a playoff spot.\n\nBROOKLYN NETS\n\n- Last season: 38-44, lost to Atlanta Hawks 4-2 in first round.\n\n- Starting five: G Jarrett Jack (12.0 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 4.7 apg), G Bojan Bogdanovic (9.0 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 0.9 apg), F Joe Johnson (14.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 3.7 apg), F Thaddeus Young (14.1 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 2.3 apg), C Brook Lopez (17.4 ppg, 7.4 rpg, 1.8 bpg).\n\n- Key additions: F Thomas Robinson (free agent, 76ers), G Wayne Ellington (free agent, Lakers), F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (trade, No. 23 by Trail Blazers, then traded to Nets), G Shane Larkin (free agent, Knicks).\n\n- Key losses: G Deron Williams (bought out, signed with Mavericks), C Mason Plumlee (trade, Trail Blazers), F Mirza Teletovic (free agent, Suns).\n\n- Coach: Lionel Hollins, second season with Nets, ninth season overall; 252-245.\n\n- Eyes on: Robinson. The No. 5 pick in the 2012 draft is already on his fifth NBA team, and the Nets appear ready to be the first to give him a long enough look to see if he can ever reach his potential.\n\n- Outlook: Following years of splashy moves and huge payrolls, the Nets are younger, more fiscally responsible, and they hope still good enough to reach the postseason after doing so in all three seasons in Brooklyn.\n\nPHILADELPHIA 76ERS\n\n- Last season: 18-64, missed playoffs.\n\n- Starting five: G Tony Wroten (16.9 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 5.2 apg), G Hollis Thompson (8.8 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.0 apg), F Robert Covington (13.5 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.5 apg), F Nerlens Noel (9.9 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 1.7 apg), C Jahlil Okafor (rookie).\n\n- Key additions: G Nik Stauskas (trade, Sacramento); Okafor (draft, No. 3).\n\n- Key losses: G Thomas Robinson (free agent, Brooklyn), G Jason Richardson (retired), F Luc Mbah a Moute (free agent, Sacramento).\n\n- Coach: Brett Brown, third season with 76ers and overall; 37-127.\n\n- Eyes on: Okafor. Won an NCAA championship in his lone season at Duke and was the No. 3 overall draft pick.\n\n- Outlook: Grim: The 76ers are again primed to become one of the worst teams in the league.\n\nSoutheast Division\n\nMIAMI HEAT\n\n- Last season: 37-45, missed playoffs.\n\n- Starting five: G Goran Dragic (16.6 ppg, 5.3 apg, 3.4 rpg), G Dwyane Wade (21.5 ppg, 4.8 apg, 3.5 rpg), F Luol Deng (14.0 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 1.9 apg), F Chris Bosh (21.1 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 2.2 apg), C Hassan Whiteside (11.8 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 2.6 bpg).\n\n- Key additions: F Amar'e Stoudemire (free agent, Mavericks), F Justise Winslow (draft, No. 10), G Gerald Green (free agent, Suns), G Josh Richardson (draft, No. 40).\n\n- Key losses: G Shabazz Napier (trade, Magic), F Henry Walker (free agent, unsigned), F Michael Beasley (free agent, signed in China).\n\n- Coach: Erik Spoelstra, eighth season with Heat and overall; 351-207.\n\n- Eyes on: Wade. He missed 20 games last year with injuries, then thought about leaving before Miami kept him with a $20 million deal for this season.\n\n- Outlook: If healthy, Miami should challenge in the East. The Heat need Bosh to be his old self after blood clots ended his season early a year ago, need Wade on the floor and need Whiteside to keep emerging.\n\nATLANTA HAWKS\n\n- Last season: 60-22, lost to Cleveland Cavaliers 4-0 in Eastern Conference finals.\n\n- Starting five: G Jeff Teague (15.9 ppg, 7.0 apg, 2.5 rpg), G Kyle Korver (12.1 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 2.9 3pt), F Paul Millsap (16.7 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 3.1 apg), F Kent Bazemore (5.2 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 1.0 apg) or Thabo Sefolosha (5.3 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 1.4 apg ), C Al Horford (15.2 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 3.2 apg).\n\n- Key additions: F-C Tiago Splitter (trade, Spurs), G Tim Hardaway Jr. (trade, Knicks), G-F Justin Holiday (free agent, Warriors).\n\n- Key losses: F DeMarre Carroll (free agent, Raptors), C Pero Antic (free agent, Europe), F Elton Brand (free agent), G John Jenkins (free agent, Mavericks).\n\n- Coach: Mike Budenholzer, third season with Hawks and overall; 98-66.\n\n- Eyes on: Bazemore and Sefolosha. The Hawks appear set to take a committee approach in replacing Carroll at small forward.\n\n- Outlook: The Hawks re-signed Millsap, but Carroll is a significant loss on both ends of the floor. The Hawks can play big with Splitter, Horford and Millsap on their front line, but it will be difficult for them to match the first 60-win season in franchise history.\n\nWASHINGTON WIZARDS\n\n- Last season: 46-36, lost to Atlanta Hawks 4-2 in second round.\n\n- Starting five: G John Wall (17.6 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 10.0 apg), G Bradley Beal (15.3 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 3.1 apg), F Otto Porter (6.0 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 0.9 apg), F Jared Dudley (7.2 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 1.8 apg), C Marcin Gortat (12.2 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 1.3 bpg).\n\n- Key additions: Dudley (trade, Bucks), G/F Alan Anderson (free agent, Nets), G Gary Neal (free agent, Hornets), G Kelly Oubre Jr. (trade, Hawks; draft, No. 15).\n\n- Key losses: F Paul Pierce (free agent, Clippers), F-C Kevin Seraphin (free agent, Knicks).\n\n- Coach: Randy Wittman, fifth season with Wizards and 10th overall; 237-365.\n\n- Eyes on: Wall. An All-Star starter and second in the NBA in assists last season, he knows he needs to shoot better and score more if he's going to take the next step toward being elite.\n\n- Outlook: With a strong backcourt in Wall and Beal, and plans to play plenty of fast-paced \"small ball,\" the Wizards are aiming for a third consecutive trip to the playoffs.\n\nCHARLOTTE HORNETS\n\n- Last season: 33-49, missed playoffs.\n\n- Starting five: G Kemba Walker (17.3 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 5.1 apg), G Jeremy Lin (11.2 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 4.6 apg), F Nicolas Batum (9.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 5.9 apg), F Cody Zeller (7.6 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 0.8 bpg), C Al Jefferson (16.6 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 1.3 bpg).\n\n- Key additions: G-F Nicolas Batum (trade, Trail Blazers), Lin (free agent, Lakers), G Jeremy Lamb (free agent, Thunder), C Spencer Hawes (trade, Clippers), F Tyler Hansbrough (free agent, Raptors), C-F Frank Kaminsky (draft, No. 9).\n\n- Key losses: G Mo Williams (free agent, Cavaliers), C Bismack Biyombo (free agent, Raptors), Gerald Henderson (trade, Trail Blazers), F Noah Vonleh (trade, Trail Blazers).\n\n- Coach: Steve Clifford, third season with Hornets and overall; 76-88.\n\n- Eyes on: Batum. The Hornets are expecting him to be a key cog in the offense and one of the team's top three scorers along with Jefferson and Walker.\n\n- Outlook: The Hornets lost their best defensive player, small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, for six months to a shoulder injury.\n\nORLANDO MAGIC\n\n- Last season: 25-57, missed playoffs.\n\n- Starting five: G Elfrid Payton (8.9 ppg, 6.5 apg, 4.3 rpg), G Victor Oladipo (17.9 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 4.1 apg), F Tobias Harris (17.1 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 1.8 apg), F Channing Frye (7.3 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 1.3 apg), C Nik Vucevic (19.3 ppg, 10.9 rpg, 2.0 apg).\n\n- Key additions: G-F Mario Hezonja (draft, No. 5), G C.J. Watson (free agent, Pacers), C Jason Smith (free agent, Knicks), G Shabazz Napier (trade, Heat), F Melvin Ejim (free agent, Italy).\n\n- Key losses: F-C Kyle O'Quinn (free agent, Knicks), G Ben Gordon (waived), F Maurice Harkless (trade, Trail Blazers).\n\n- Coach: Scott Skiles, first season with Magic and 14th overall; 443-433.\n\n- Eyes on: Skiles. Orlando has turned to Skiles -- a former Magic player -- in hopes of making its first trip to the playoffs since the departure of former star Dwight Howard. Skiles has six playoff appearances as a coach, with past stops in Phoenix, Chicago and Milwaukee.\n\n- Outlook: The Magic whiffed on their attempts to sign All-Star forward Paul Millsap in free agency. But general manager Rob Hennigan did re-sign Harris and pick up a serviceable big man in Smith. If Skiles improves Orlando's defensive toughness, a better year is possible.\n\nNorthwest Division\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER\n\nLast season: 45-37, did not make playoffs.\n\nStarting five: G Russell Westbrook (28.1 ppg, 8.6 apg, 7.3 rpg, 2.1 spg), G Andre Roberson (3.4 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 0.8 spg), F Kevin Durant (25.4 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 4.1 apg), F Serge Ibaka (14.3 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 2.4 bpg), C Steven Adams (7.7 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 1.2 bpg).\n\nKey additions: G Cameron Payne (draft), Billy Donovan (coach).\n\nKey losses: Scott Brooks, coach.\n\nCoach: Billy Donovan, first season.\n\nEyes on: Durant and Ibaka. Durant, the 2013-14 MVP and scoring champion, played just 27 games last season because of a broken right foot. He is back and has looked like his normal self during the preseason. Ibaka, the team's defensive centerpiece, missed the final month of last season after having knee surgery. He is ready to go as well.\n\nOutlook: The Thunder ensured quality depth by signing center Enes Kanter to a 4-year, $70 million deal during the offseason. Kanter averaged 18.7 points and 11 rebounds for the Thunder last season after being moved from Utah at the trade deadline. Westbrook won the scoring title and made a run at the MVP award in Durant's absence. With Durant and Ibaka back, if Oklahoma City stays healthy and the players click with Donovan, a title is within reach.\n\n------\n\nUTAH JAZZ\n\nLast season: 38-44, did not make playoffs.\n\nStarting five: G Trey Burke (12.8 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 4.3 apg), G Alec Burks (13.9 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 3.0 apg), F Gordon Hayward (19.3 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 4.1 apg), F Derrick Favors (16.0 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 1.7 bpg), C Rudy Gobert (8.4 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 2.3 bpg).\n\nKey additions: F Trey Lyles (2015 draft), G Raul Neto (owned draft rights, signed from Universidad Catolica De Murcia), C Tibor Pleiss (owned draft rights, signed from FC Barcelona), C Jeff Withey (free agent, Hornets)\n\nKey losses: None.\n\nCoach: Quin Snyder, second season.\n\nEyes on: The big three. The Jazz have put their faith in Gordon Hayward, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert playing at an All-Star level. Hayward and Favors have entered their primes in their sixth years in the league and Gobert has star potential. They are the foundation the organization believes is strong enough to build a contending team around.\n\nOutlook: A playoff run is the next step for a rebuilding organization that posted the sixth-best win percentage (.655) in the NBA after the All-Star break last season. But the growth must come from within after the Jazz declined to add any significant veteran to the roster during the offseason and lost guard Dante Exum to a left knee injury.\n\n------\n\nMINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES\n\nLast season: 16-66, did not make playoffs.\n\nStarting five: G Ricky Rubio (10.3 ppg, 8.8 apg, 1.7 spg), G Zach LaVine (10.1 ppg, 3.6 apg, 2.4 rpg), F Andrew Wiggins (16.9 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 1.0 spg), F Kevin Garnett (7.6 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 19.6 mpg), C Karl-Anthony Towns (10.3 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 2.3 bpg at Kentucky).\n\nKey additions: F/C Towns (draft), PG Tyus Jones (draft), F Nemanja Bjelica (owned draft rights, signed from Turkey), PG Andre Miller (free agent, Kings).\n\nKey losses: G Gary Neal (free agent, Wizards), F Chase Budinger (trade, Pacers).\n\nCoach: Sam Mitchell (interim), first season.\n\nEyes on: Flip Saunders. The team president, minority owner and coach is on a leave of absence while being treated for cancer. Saunders has made several moves to restore some hope to one of the NBA's woebegone franchises, and now it is up to Mitchell and GM Milt Newton to carry that vision forward while Saunders tends to his health.\n\nOutlook: If they can stay healthy they should take a massive step forward with Wiggins in his second year, the No. 1 overall pick in Towns, Rubio returning and Garnett watching over the whole crew. Probably still a year away from contending for a playoff berth in the rugged West.\n\n------\n\nPORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS\n\nLast season: 51-31, lost to Memphis Grizzlies (4-1) in the first round.\n\nStarting five: G Damian Lillard (21.0 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 6.2 apg), G Gerald Henderson (12.1 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 2.6 apg), F Al-Farouq Aminu (5.6 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 0.8 apg), F Ed Davis (8.3 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 1.2 apg), C Mason Plumlee (8.7 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 0.77 bpg).\n\nKey additions: G Henderson (trade, Hornets), C Plumlee (trade, Knicks), F Aminu (free agent, Mavericks), F Davis (free agent, Lakers), F Maurice Harkless (trade, Magic), F Noah Vonleh (trade, Hornets).\n\nKey losses: F LaMarcus Aldridge (free agent, Spurs), G Wesley Matthews (free agent, Mavericks), F Nicolas Batum (trade, Hornets), C Robin Lopez (free agent, Knicks).\n\nCoach: Terry Stotts, fourth season.\n\nEyes on: Lillard. The All-Star guard, entering his fourth season, is the last starter remaining from last season's team. He will be counted on to lead a squad which, in the preseason, ranked the third-youngest in the NBA, in the midst of a major rebuilding project. The Blazers have faith in him as the face of the franchise: He signed a five-year, $120 million contract in the offseason.\n\nOutlook: The Blazers are not expected to make the playoffs this season, and they'll likely win fewer than 30 games, but they could be fun to watch with several young up-and-comers. Two players to watch are CJ McCollum, who is expected to back up Lillard at point guard, and Meyers Leonard, a 7-foot-1 center who showed his athleticism and an accurate 3-point shot late last season.\n\n------\n\nDENVER NUGGETS\n\nLast season: 30-52, did not make playoffs.\n\nStarting five: PG Emmanuel Mudiay (18 ppg, 5.9 apg in 12 games for professional team in China), G Gary Harris (3.3 ppg, 1.2 rpg), F Danilo Gallinari (12.4 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 1.4 apg), F Kenneth Faried (12.6 ppg, 8.9 rpb, 1.2 apg), C Joffrey Lauvergne (3.9 ppg, 3.2 rpb).\n\nKey additions: Michael Malone (coach), Mudiay (No. 7 pick in draft), C Nikola Jokic (41st pick in 2014 draft pick), F Mike Miller (free agent, Cavaliers).\n\nKey losses: G Ty Lawson (trade, Rockets).\n\nCoach: Malone, first season.\n\nEyes on: Mudiay. He will run the offense in place of Lawson, who was traded after several alcohol-related run-ins with authorities. Gallinari said that Mudiay could be a strong rookie of the year candidate. Mudiay, who played pro ball in China last season, is working on developing a more consistent jumper.\n\nOutlook: The Nuggets finished 19-22 at Pepsi Center last season, their first losing mark at home since 2002-03. Malone vows to run more to take advantage of the elevation advantage in Denver. To draw the team closer, backup guard Jameer Nelson held a get-together in Philadelphia before training camp, with the team bonding over paint ball, hoops and video games.\n\nSouthwest Division\n\nSAN ANTONIO SPURS\n\nLast season: 55-27, lost to Los Angeles Clippers in first round.\n\nStarting five: G Tony Parker (14.4 ppg, 4.9 apg, 1.9 rpg), G Danny Green (11.7 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 2.0 apg), F Kawhi Leonard (16.5 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 2.5 apg), F LaMarcus Aldridge (23.4 ppg, 10.2 rpg, 1.7 apg with Portland), C Tim Duncan (13.9 ppg, 9.1 rpg, 2.0 bpg).\n\nKey additions: Aldridge (free agent, Trail Blazers); F David West (free agent, Pacers).\n\nKey losses: G Marco Belinelli (free agent, Kings); G Cory Joseph (free agent, Raptors); C Tiago Splitter (trade, Hawks).\n\nCoach: Gregg Popovich, 20th season.\n\nEyes on: Aldridge. He's joined an elite team that is good enough to win an NBA title, but how the Spurs ultimately fare this season is likely going to be determined by how he meshes with a San Antonio core that's been together for years.\n\nOutlook: Without question, a championship contender. Popovich is masterful at managing minutes, which will be even more important this year with a roster that keeps getting older but still isn't slowing down.\n\n------\n\nHOUSTON ROCKETS\n\nLast season: 56-26, lost to Warriors in third round.\n\nStarting five: G James Harden (27.4 ppg, 7 apg, 5.7 rpg, 1.9 spg), G Patrick Beverley (10.1 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 3.4 apg) or G Ty Lawson (15.2 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 9.6 apg), F Trevor Ariza (12.8 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 2.5 apg), F Terrence Jones (11.7 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 1.8 bpg), C Dwight Howard (15.8 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 1.3 bpg).\n\nKey additions: Lawson (trade), F Sam Dekker (draft), F Montrezl Harrell (draft).\n\nKey losses: F Josh Smith (free agent, Clippers).\n\nCoach: Kevin McHale, fifth season,\n\nEyes on: Lawson. He was acquired in a July trade with Denver while in a 30-day residential treatment program following his second DUI arrest. He was out in time for the start of Rockets camp and the team has been encouraged by his work and focus. They're excited about what he can bring to the team, particularly in taking some pressure off Harden, if he stays on track.\n\nOutlook: If Harden builds on what he did last season, Lawson doesn't have any more problems and Howard remains healthy, the Rockets should be one of the top teams in the Western Conference again a year after reaching the conference finals for the first time since 1997.\n\n------\n\nMEMPHIS GRIZZLIES\n\nLast season: 55-27, lost to Warriors in second round.\n\nStarting five: G Michael Conley (15.8 ppg, 5.8 apg, 3.0 rpg), G Courtney Lee (10.1 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.0 apg), G/F Tony Allen (8.6 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 1.4 apg), F Zach Randolph (16.1 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 2.2 apg), C Marc Gasol (17.4 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 3.8 apg).\n\nKey additions: F Matt Barnes (trade, Bobcats), F Brandan Wright (free agent, Suns), F Jarell Martin (draft).\n\nKey losses: C Kosta Koufos (free agent, Kings), G Nick Calathes (free agent, Greece), F Jon Leuer (trade, Suns).\n\nCoach: Dave Joerger, third season.\n\nEyes on: Conley. The Grizzlies are a much better team with their point guard on the floor distributing the ball, a fact driven home in the playoffs when he tried to play through broken bones in his left cheek against the Warriors. Injuries limited Conley to 70 games last season, but he is in the final year of his current contract this season.\n\nOutlook: The Grizzlies had a quiet offseason for a change after front office changes in 2014 and a coaching change in 2013. Their biggest move came by keeping Marc Gasol off the free agent market, but the franchise built on \"Grit 'n' Grind\" got even more defensive signing Barnes. Missing a chance to go up 3-1 over the eventual champion Warriors when injuries took a toll has the Grizzlies more determined than ever to chase a championship.\n\n------\n\nNEW ORLEANS PELICANS\n\nLast season: 45-37, lost to Golden State in first round.\n\nStarting five: G Tyreke Evans (16.6 ppg, 6.6 apg, 5.3 rpg, 1.3 spg), G Eric Gordon (13.4 ppg, 3.8 apg, 2.6 rpg), F Quincy Pondexter (9.0 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 1.5 apg), F Anthony Davis (24.4 ppg, 10.2 rpg, 2.9 bpg), C Omer Asik (7.3 ppg, 9.8 rpg, 0.7 bpg).\n\nKey additions: C Kendrick Perkins (free agent).\n\nKey losses: None.\n\nCoach: Alvin Gentry, first season.\n\nEyes on: Gentry, who is tasked with getting more out of virtually the same roster that last season's coach, Monty Williams, had. Williams was fired following a first-round exit from the playoffs, even though it was New Orleans' first postseason appearance since 2011. Gentry was a lead assistant last season with Golden State, the team that eliminated New Orleans en route to an NBA title. Gentry brings the type of up-tempo, free-flowing scheme the Warriors employ, contrasting sharply from Williams' methodical approach that limited the overall number of possessions in a game.\n\nOutlook: The Pelicans have a handful of talented scorers in their prime, led by Davis, already an emerging superstar at age 22. Gentry contends this type of roster best fits his coaching style because there is the youth and depth to push the tempo relentlessly. A second straight playoff appearance is expected as Davis continues his ascension.\n\n------\n\nDALLAS MAVERICKS\n\nLast season: 50-32, lost to Houston Rockets in first round.\n\nStarting five: G Deron Williams (13.0 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 6.6 apg), G Wesley Matthews (15.9 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 2.3 apg), F Chandler Parsons (15.7 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 2.4 apg), F Dirk Nowitzki (17.3 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 1.9 apg), C Zaza Pachulia (8.3 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 2.4 apg).\n\nKey additions: Williams (free agent, Nets), Matthews (free agent, Trail Blazers), Pachulia (trade, Bucks), C JaVale McGee (free agent, 76ers), G Justin Anderson (draft).\n\nKey losses: G Monta Ellis (free agent, Pacers), C Tyson Chandler (free agent, Suns), G Rajon Rondo (free agent, Kings), F Al-Farouq Aminu (free agent, Trail Blazers), F Richard Jefferson (free agent, Cavaliers).\n\nCoach: Rick Carlisle, ninth season.\n\nEyes on: Williams. His three years under a max deal in Brooklyn were marred by injuries, unhappiness and issues with his confidence. While playing for the hometown Mavericks could help, he's already having injury woes. Williams is likely to miss the start of the regular season because of a right calf strain.\n\nOutlook: Losing DeAndre Jordan in free agency when he reneged on an oral commitment to the Mavericks could hang over the franchise for some time. It's likely that the Mavericks will start the season without Williams, Matthews (Achilles surgery) and Parsons (knee surgery). By the time everybody is healthy and comfortable playing together, Dallas might be too far behind in the difficult Western Conference.\n\nPacific Division\n\nGOLDEN STATE WARRIORS\n\nLast season: 67-15, NBA champions.\n\nStarting five: G Stephen Curry (23.8 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 7.7 apg), G Klay Thompson (21.7 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 2.9 apg), F Harrison Barnes (10.1 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 1.4 apg), F Draymond Green (11.7 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 3.7 apg), C Andrew Bogut (6.3 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 2.7 apg).\n\nKey additions: F Jason Thompson (trade, 76ers).\n\nKey losses: F David Lee (trade, Celtics).\n\nCoach: Steve Kerr, second season.\n\nEyes on: Kerr. He missed training camp after complications from offseason back surgery and the Warriors don't know when their coach will be back. Untested Luke Walton is running the team in Kerr's absence but the Warriors will need Kerr healthy to be at their best.\n\nOutlook: The Warriors bring back the nine players who played the most minutes last year on the team that brought the team its first title in 40 years. With four of the five starters age 27 or younger, Golden State feels its best is still to come. Winning 67 games again might not be realistic but the Warriors should be one of the leading contenders for the championship come playoff time.\n\n------\n\nLOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\nLast season: 56-26, lost to Houston 4-3 in Western Conference semifinals.\n\nStarting five: G Chris Paul (19.1 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 10.2 apg), G J.J. Redick (16.4 ppg, 2.1 rpg, 1.8 apg), F Blake Griffin (21.9 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 5.3 apg), F Wesley Johnson (9.9 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 1.6 apg), C DeAndre Jordan (11.5 ppg, 15.0 rpg, 2.2 bpg).\n\nKey additions: F Paul Pierce (free agent, Washington), F Josh Smith (free agent, Houston), G/F Lance Stephenson (trade, Hornets), F Luc Mbah a Moute (free agent, Philadelphia), C/F Chuck Hayes (free agent, Toronto), F Branden Dawson (draft), C Cole Aldrich (free agent, New York), Wesley Johnson (free agent, Lakers), G Pablo Prigioni (free agent, Denver).\n\nKey losses: F Matt Barnes (trade, New Orleans), C Spencer Hawes (trade, New Orleans), Glen Davis (free agent), F Jordan Hamilton (waived), G Lester Hudson (waived), G Dahntay Jones (free agent, Brooklyn), F Hedo Turkoglu (free agent), F Ekpe Udoh (free agent, Turkey).\n\nCoach: Doc Rivers, third season.\n\nEyes on: Pierce. The 10-time All-Star and former NBA Finals MVP, returns to his hometown to close out his career in a reunion with Rivers. How well the 38-year-old veteran integrates with longtime locker room leaders Griffin and Paul will be a key. Smith and Stephenson have a chance to restore their reputations.\n\nOutlook: Rivers, as president of basketball operations, brought in nine new players over the summer, while retaining Jordan and his son Austin. Managing minutes while keeping everyone happy will be a challenge. The Clippers' deeper bench should give their starters valuable rest, but this team has to learn how to close out games.\n\n------\n\nSACRAMENTO KINGS\n\nLast season: 29-53, did not make playoffs.\n\nStarting five: G Rajon Rondo (8.9 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 7.9 apg), G Ben McLemore (12.1 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 1.7 apg), F Rudy Gay (21.1 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 3.7 apg), PF Kosta Koufos (5.2 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 0.5 apg), C DeMarcus Cousins (24.1 ppg, 12.7 rpg, 3.6 apg).\n\nKey additions: Rondo (free agent, Mavericks), Koufos (free agent, Grizzlies), G Marco Belinelli (free agent, Spurs), F Caron Butler (free agent, Pistons), C Willie Cauley-Stein (draft).\n\nKey losses: F Jason Thompson (trade, 76ers), F Carl Landry (trade, 76ers), G Nik Stauskas (trade, 76ers).\n\nCoach: George Karl, second season.\n\nEyes on: Rondo. After wearing out his welcome in Boston and Dallas last year, Rondo is looking for a fresh start after signing a one-year deal with the Kings. At his best, Rondo could be the good distributor and defensive point guard the Kings dearly need. At his worst, he can be disengaged and could add to the turmoil between Karl and Cousins.\n\nOutlook: The Kings are looking to end a nine-year playoff drought in their final year before moving to a new downtown arena. After a whirlwind offseason that featured public disputes between Karl and Cousins, the Kings hope the offseason additions can lead to needed improvement.\n\n------\n\nPHOENIX SUNS\n\nLast season: 39-43, missed playoffs\n\nStarting five: G Eric Bledsoe (17 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 6.1 apg), G Brandon Knight (17 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 5.2 apg), F Markieff Morris (15.3 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 2.3 apg), F P.J. Tucker (9.1 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 1.5 apg) or T.J. Warren (6.1 ppg, 2.1 rpg, 0.6 apg), C Tyson Chandler (10.3 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 1.1 apg).\n\nKey additions: Chandler (free agent, Mavericks), G Devin Booker (draft), F Jon Leuer (trade, Grizzlies), F Mirza Teletovic (free agent, Nets), G/F Sonny Weems (free agent, CSKA Moscow), C Henry Sims (free agent, 76ers).\n\nKey losses: G Gerald Green (free agent, Heat), F Marcus Morris (trade, Pistons), F Brandan Wright (free agent, Grizzlies).\n\nCoach: Jeff Hornacek, third season.\n\nEyes on: Markieff Morris. He was unhappy, to say the least, when his twin brother Marcus was traded to Detroit. Markieff issued a series of blistering tweets, saying there was no way he would be with the Suns this season. But he showed up for media day, said he was committed to playing for the team and winning for Hornacek.\n\nOutlook: The Suns' big free agent acquisition was Chandler, and he figures prominently both as an inside presence on the court and a veteran leader in the locker room. Phoenix overhauled its bench and could go nine or 10 deep in the rotation. The team is sticking with its two-point guard philosophy and how well Bledsoe and Knight mesh will go a long way toward determining whether the Suns can break their five-year playoff drought.\n\n------\n\nLOS ANGELES LAKERS\n\nLast season: 21-61, did not make playoffs.\n\nStarting five: G Jordan Clarkson (11.0 ppg, 3.5 apg, 3.2 rpg), G D'Angelo Russell (19.3 ppg, 5.0 apg, 5.7 rpg at Ohio State), F Kobe Bryant (22.3 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 5.6 apg), F Julius Randle (15.0 ppg, 10.4 rpg, 1.4 apg at Kentucky in 2013-14), C Roy Hibbert (10.6 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 1.6 bpg at Pacers).\n\nKey additions: G Russell (draft), C Hibbert (trade), F Brandon Bass (free agent, Celtics), G Lou Williams (free agent, Raptors), F Metta World Peace (free agent), G Marcelo Huertas (free agent, FC Barcelona).\n\nKey losses: F Wesley Johnson (free agent, Clippers), F-C Jordan Hill (free agent, Pacers), F Carlos Boozer (free agent), F Ed Davis (free agent, Trail Blazers).\n\nCoach: Byron Scott, second season.\n\nEyes on: Russell. The second overall pick in last summer's draft is a gifted playmaker and a potential franchise player, but he's also a 19-year-old getting used to living in the Lakers' enormous spotlight. Bryant has vowed to watch out for Russell as he matures into what the Lakers really hope is their next big star.\n\nOutlook: For his 20th NBA season, Bryant is teamed with a motley collection of raw talent and veteran spare parts. Coming off the worst season in franchise history, hardly anyone expects the Lakers to end their two-year playoff drought, but a three-year skid would be the longest in franchise history."
