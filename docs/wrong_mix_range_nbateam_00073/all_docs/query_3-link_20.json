        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. — Just a dozen or so hours after hearing his name called in the 2023 NBA Draft, former Indiana star Trayce Jackson was in California on Friday night, meeting with the local media after being introduced as a Golden State Warriors draft pick.\n\nJackson-Davis, the No. 3 all-time leading scorer at Indiana and the school's top shot blocker and rebounder, was picked No. 57 overall in the second round of the 2023 NBA Draft. The Warriors traded with the Washington Wizards for Jackson-Davis after the pick was made.\n\nJackson-Davis and first-round pick Brandin Podziemski were introduced by new Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr.\n\nThere were several questions about Jackson-Davis' future with the Warriors, a team that has won four NBA titles in the past decade, but there were also plenty of questions about his time at Indiana, which was mentioned as a ''blueblood program.''\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n— on what he learned from Mike Woodson, his coach at Indiana and a former NBA player and coach himself\n\n\"For me, having a coach like Coach Woodson come in with his NBA experience and helping me be the best player that I can possibly be. It's a blessing to leave my small mark on that program and I really enjoyed my four years there. He told me to just enjoy it, because you only get to go through this one time. He told me to be in the best shape of my life and compete.\n\n— on the differences between Woodson and Archie Miller, who coached Jackson-Davis for two years at Indiana before getting fired\n\n\"They both brought different values, and they both coached a different way. Coach Woodson was more of a talker and explainer, and Coach Miller liked to yell, which, honestly, I feel like I'm really coachable, so either of those ways are good with me. Just learning new things. Coming into college and Coach Miller starting me as a freshman and learning through mistakes was huge. And Coach Woodson letting me bring the ball up the court and make passes and expand my game was huge. I got key things from both of them.''\n\n— on having a chip on his shoulder after being overlooked in the draft\n\n\"I think the biggest thing for me, I always play with a chip on my shoulder. Even coming out of high school going to a school like Indiana, a lot of people doubted my abilities. After four years and what I was able to accomplish there, it was above and beyond what everyone thought and this is the next step in my journey and I know I have to work. I believe in my abilities and we'll let God handle the rest. Last night, watching picks going and going, I just basically said I'm fired up and I'm ready to go, honestly.''\n\n— on interest from the Warriors from the beginning of the draft process\n\n\"I had them in the beginning of the draft process. We did an interview in Chicago, and then they came and watched me in LA and then I came up here the next day to workout. We built a very strong relationship and it does help that Mike's brother (James Dunleavy) is my agent, so that's a good thing.\n\n— on fit with the Warriors\n\n\"They like to play in space and we both like to pass the ball. We're unselfish. I saw that Steph (Curry) followed me on Instagram, so that's pretty cool. I get to pass the ball to open shooters, the best shooters in the world, so this is a really good fit for me.\n\n— on the whirlwind the past few days\n\nIt was crazy. I think about 15 hours ago I was sitting out there waiting for my name to get called. I got about three hour's sleep and then was hopping on a plane out coming out here. It's been a blessing and a great experience.\n\n— on improving as a passer\n\n\"I credit that to Coach Woodson and myself for watching film. At the end of they, being older, there's still parts of my game I can improve on and unlock here.''\n\n— on playing so aggressively\n\n\"It's just how I am, and having a switch. When you're between the lines, I feel like I'm a different person. I'm a competitor, and when I'm out there, I just want to rip the rim off, honestly.''\n\nJackson-Davis, who will wear No. 32 with the Warriors, appeared at the press conference along with his agent Max Lipsett. He was joined by Warriors first-round pick Brandon Podziemski.\n\nDunleavy said he was thrilled to land both players, making draft night a big success.\n\n\"We're really excited to have these guys and add them to the mix for us. Last night was a really successful evening,'' Dunleavy said. \"They were really productive college players and have a proven track record in terms of what they've done. To bring that into the mix for us, hat's something we really value. You can talk about their competitive and skill level, but most importantly, it's their character. We've been really impressed with them throughout this evaluation process.''\n\nJackson-Davis will get right to work in California as the Warriors prepare for summer-league action. They will play two games in Sacramento on July 1 (Kings )and July 3 (Charlotte Hornets) and then head to Las Vegas for the 30-team summer league that runs for 10 days.\n\nGolden State’s first summer-league game is Friday, July 7 against the Los Angeles Lakers, where Jackson-Davis will be reunited with former Indiana teammate Jalen Hood-Schifino, who was the Lakers' first-round pick. They will also play the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, July 9, the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, July 12 and the Houston Rockets on Thursday, July 13\n\nHow the Warriors fare in those four games will determine when their fifth game is played and against whom. The top four teams in pool play will advance to the playoff bracket. The semifinals and finals are July 16-17.\n\nWatch the full interview here\n\nTo watch the Golden State Warriors' introductory press conference with draft picks Trayce Jackson-Davis and Brandin Podziemski on YouTube, CLICK HERE\n\nRelated stories on Indiana basketball"
