        "text": "With the 2024 NBA Finals on the verge of wrapping up in the next few days. As a result of that the eyes of basketball media, fans, and others turns to the offseason. Usually, an active time in the summer, it should be even more active with a number of contenders having money to spend. Additionally, an added wrinkle to this offseason will be what teams do now that the new Collective Bargaining Agreement is in effect. With it teams have to offload contracts instead of hoarding them to build a ready-made contender.\n\nMost Active Teams Heading Into The NBA Offseason.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: Need to go Big Man Shopping\n\nOne of the most surprising teams of the 2023-24 NBA regular season was the Oklahoma City Thunder. In addition, they were the number one seed in the Western Conference. Also, they had their season ended by the Dallas Mavericks in the second round of the 2024 NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe biggest weakness of their team was they were not big enough at the center position. To deal with the bigger teams in the NBA. In addition, OKC will have 35.6 million dollars in cap space this offseason. That makes them the fifth-ranked team with money to spend this summer. With that much money to spend, they will need to go shopping for a center. Additionally, OKC will need to find someone who has a flexible game to combine with the talents of Chet Holmgren and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\nOne of the players that has been associated with the Thunder is Isaiah Hartenstein. The Knicks starting big man is a free agent this offseason. As a result of his performance in the postseason, he earned himself a lot of money heading into the offseason. Hartenstein would be perfect playing next to Holmgren and would free him up to show more of his game. In search of a big man and more role players who can complement their talented young duo, the Thunder should be one of the most active teams in the 2024 off-season.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: Superstar Shopping\n\nAnother team that is looking to take advantage of having a lot of money to spend is the Philadelphia 76ers. In addition, Philly should have about $65-million dollars to spend this offseason. That makes them the second-ranked team with money to spend. Heading into the 2024 offseason the Sixers are looking for a third piece to team up with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. Additionally, they will be looking to either keep a portion of their role players or add more who can play defense and make three-pointers."
