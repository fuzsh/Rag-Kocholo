        "text": "OAKLAND — The main topic of conversation following the Warriors’ 104-100 Game 1 win over the Rockets Sunday isn’t Golden State’s gutsy effort on short rest.\n\nIt isn’t Kevin Durant’s dominant offensive run — he scored 35 points Sunday and is averaging 40 per game over his last five — either.\n\nNo, the conversation is all about the referees.\n\nThen again, we shouldn’t expect anything else following a game featuring this Houston team.\n\nThat’s because these Rockets aren’t interested in playing Golden State straight-up — they know they’ll lose that way. So instead they’ve devised a clever way to make the game more balanced: they deliberately bring the referees into the fray.\n\nThe Rockets are not so much playing basketball as they are attempting to exploit the game’s rules and the fallibility of the officials to their advantage. It’s a gameplan rooted in obsession, devised by lawyers, and seeping in righteous indignation. It’s pathetic.\n\nAnd if this catches on — if this nonsense works and becomes the way basketball is played in the NBA moving forward, then the league has a massive problem.\n\nFor 48 minutes Sunday, Houston hunted for fouls. Yes, their version of a floppy action looks a lot different than the Warriors’, and after 87 games of practice, they were flagrant in its execution in Game 1.\n\nOftentimes, the strategy worked — the Warriors fouled Houston 24 times, putting them at the line for 29 free-throw attempts.\n\nBut there were a few times — including on the last shot of the game — where Houston’s unsporting tactics and general histrionics didn’t bring about the result they desire on every possession: a whistle.\n\nAnd then, of course, they claimed that they were jobbed out of a win by the referees.\n\n“I just want a fair chance, man,” a shameless James Harden said after the game. “Call the game how it’s supposed to be called.”\n\nNo, that’s not a joke, the guy who is initiating contact with defenders on nearly every possession actually said that.\n\n“We could have easily gone to the line another 20 times during the game,” Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni said, giving away his team’s gameplan in the process.\n\nI have a better idea for Harden and the Rockets: how about you play the game the way it’s supposed to be played?\n\nHarden is one of the most gifted scorers in NBA history, but he’s not using his incredible skills for good. Instead, he’s become a master of the dark arts, and an entitled one, as well, crying wolf all game and then wondering why the referees don’t give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI guarantee you this: If the referees weren’t on the court — if the NBA decided to let the players police the game themselves, Harden and the Rockets would drop their act in seconds.\n\nBut the refs exist, so the Rockets are trying to game them and, in turn, the system.\n\nPerhaps it’s on the NBA to change the system.\n\nBecause if they don’t, and nonsense like what we saw Sunday — the most extreme version yet of what we’ve seen so often for the last four years — is rewarded and celebrated, the league is going to feel a harsh rebuke from those who don’t have a blind loyalty for a team or the game.\n\nThe Warriors are not excluded from this criticism, by the way — this is a complaint that transcends this rivalry and the ridiculous tribalism that powers the conversation around it.\n\nHarden might be the most blatant offender, but Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry were hunting fouls on Sunday, too. That’s because Rockets were able to dictate the terms of engagement for Game 1, and left the Warriors with a choice — they could lose the right way or win with the wrong one. They unsurprisingly chose the latter — the stakes of Game 1 were too high.\n\nDurant attempted more free throws in Sunday’s game than Harden, and all came in the second half — he used the Rockets guard’s patented rip-through move again and again to beat Houston at their own game.\n\nFor fans of the Warriors and Rockets, the ends will always justify the means, but let’s step out of the bubble for a moment and remember that professional sports are nothing more than an elaborate reality TV show.\n\nHow did casual fans — the ones that drive the billion-dollar TV deals — view Game 1?\n\nI’m talking about the people who don’t spend all game commenting on #NBATwitter. The ones that don’t wear a jersey while watching. The people who don’t have NBA League Pass and just want to flip on a nationally televised game on a Sunday afternoon and be entertained.\n\nWhat was entertaining about 48 minutes of flopping?\n\nYes, I doubt many would be interested in tuning in for a second helping come Tuesday.\n\nThe NBA changes rules every year, but they’re simply not keeping up with the cleverness, brazenness, and skill of the players.\n\nThe league instituted the “Zaza Pachulia rule” to stop defenders from standing in the landing spot of shooters. Fair enough.\n\nBut the Rockets — and Warriors and plenty of other enterprising teams — kick their legs out on nearly every 3-point attempt, oftentimes initiating contact with the defender in an effort to get three free throws, making a mockery of the spirit of the rule in the process.\n\nThe NBA also instituted new freedom of movement rules for offensive players this season — a blatant attempt to increase scoring as to help with those TV ratings. It did that, but we’re also seeing more trips to the line, killing the flow and energy of games.\n\nThere will always be fouls in basketball — it’s a chaotic, physical game — but those fouls should be accidents, errors in execution.\n\nInstead, they’ve become an integral part of the game plan for one of the NBA’s most successful teams.\n\nThis is the kind of soulless, analytical strategy that’s killing baseball’s popularity. It’s mechanical to the point of eye rolls, and if commissioner Adam Silver and the league don’t address the issue this offseason and this kind of play proliferates, the NBA can expect the same fate as the “national pastime” in due time.\n\nI don’t expect anything to change in this series, though. The Rockets didn’t waste a moment to start politicking for a “fairer” whistle following Game 1. They’re not going to change a damn thing.\n\nSo every 3-pointer will include a flail; every drive, a flop. The only hope we have for watchable basketball is for the Warriors to stop turning the ball over and to get out and run a bit more — a challenge when you’re playing this Rockets team, for sure. Maybe then, this series won’t be an insufferable slog.\n\nI don’t know who will win it in the end, but if Game 1 is the way this series is going to be played moving forward, don’t be surprised if people tune out."
