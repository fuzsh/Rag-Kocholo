        "text": "Draymond Green is under heavy fire after he punched Jusuf Nurkic from the Phoneix Suns earlier in the week, marking yet another suspension for the Golden State Warriors power forward, but this time is different.\n\nSeveral reports say that the NBA hit Green with an indefinite suspension, as he will be off the court until the league sees that the Warriors player has improved his behavior from now on, as this is the third time that he has been suspended by the league this season.\n\nHow many games will Draymond miss?\n\nHowever, according to ESPN's insider, Adrian Wojnarowski, sources within the Golden State Warriors told him that Draymond Green will be out for at least 9 games, meaning that he will not probably play until 2024.\n\nAlso, he will have to follow the league's guidelines upon his return, as he is expected to see a counselor and other things to decrease his aggressiveness on the court, but still in a competitive manner.\n\nDraymond's reaction\n\nDespite the uncertain timeline, Green appears to be handling the situation with an understanding of the gravity of the incident according to the Warriors' general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr.\n\nAccording to press reports, Dunleavy has stated that Green will remain connected to the team throughout the suspension and that the team will not look to send the player off, but rather offer any help he needs to avoid further incidents in the future."
