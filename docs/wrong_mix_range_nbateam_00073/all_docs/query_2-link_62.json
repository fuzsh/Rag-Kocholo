        "text": "JD & Silver reconvene after a tumultuous free agency period for the Golden State Warriors, in which they had to bid farewell to Klay Thompson, and welcome new faces in Buddy Hield, Kyle Anderson, and DeAnthony Melton. The two assess how the Warriors offseason moves have impacted the team thus far and dive into the 2024-2025 season both with and without Lauri Markkanen being a member of the roster. Plus, Jonathan Kuminga's increased expectations for next season, and how the Dubs stack up in a (still) loaded Western Conference.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nWe bring the YouTube show to the air to take your calls and reactions to Klay Thompson's departure from the Golden State Warriors. Thompson has yet to decide on his next team.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nThe free agency nightmare continues in the Bay Area, as Shams Charania reported that Klay Thompson will depart from the Golden State Warriors after 13 seasons. JD & Silver react to the news and discuss the Warriors Plan A, B, C, and where they go from here in this offseason. The Warriors also waived Chris Paul, which eliminates them having to pay $30 million, but also means that they cannot use him to bring another player back.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nJD & Silver react to a rough Saturday for Dub Nation. After Paul George declined his $48.7M option and entered free agency, it essentially ended all possibilities of George ending up in the Bay Area. Shortly after, The Athletic's Shams Charania and Anthony Slater reported that the Warriors are preparing to part ways with Klay Thompson, who will enter free agency and pursue offers from teams like the Dallas Mavericks, Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers, and possibly others. Hear the guys' initial thoughts on an impromptu \"Just Dubs\" for The Sports Leader.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nJD & Silver are back LIVE on YouTube, Twitch, and X for night 1 of the NBA Draft. While the 2024 draft doesn't hold the same shine and excitement as many years past, the NBA offseason is heating up, and there is plenty to unpack. First, they dive into the reports around the Warriors pursuing the Clippers' Paul George and why the Warriors have to be willing to take risks. Later on, the show moves into news from the draft, Klay Thompson's stalled contract negotiations, and reacting to sound from Mike Dunleavy Jr.'s press conference.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nJD & Silver (masters of the show off the air) react to some NBA news and reports and discuss what they might mean for Klay Thompson's free agency market. Does Malik Monk intending to re-sign with the Kings indicate that Klay's market is higher or lower elsewhere? How do various factors within the Warriors organization, including Gary Payton II opting into his $9.1 million player option, impact the Warriors plans for roster construction next season? If Klay Thompson were to stay with Golden State, what role would the Dubs have for him? We break it all down on The Sports Leader.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nJD (fatigued by Draymond in the media) & Silver (calls the Celtics great but generationally dysfunctional) recap a busy night in which the Celtics took a 3-0 lead over the Mavericks and are one win away from an NBA title. Pivoting to the Warriors side of things, they dive deeper into Klay Thompson's emotions amid contract negotiations and some future possibilities for Kevon Looney. Last but not least, they remember the great life of Jerry West, who passed away yesterday at the age of 86.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nJD & Silver (current podcast cohosts with a player/coach relationship on the horizon) reconnect for the start of the NBA Finals between the Celtics and Mavericks and point out some items to look for over the next couple of weeks. They also address the idea of the Warriors showing interest in Jimmy Butler and the sacrifices that would make a move worth it. To round things out, they take some questions given to them by you the listeners to spark another forward-thinking offseason discussion for Dub Nation.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nJD & Silver revisit reports of possible trade negotiations between the Warriors and Cavaliers this offseason and how there could be a path toward a move without it being the move of the summer. They also remember the great Bill Walton, who passed away Monday morning, and his ties to not only the Warriors organization but sports, music, and American culture. The final third of the episode goes into what documentary cameras in the building could mean for next season, and one big possibility to look out for with the WNBA's Golden State Valkyries in 2025.See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."
