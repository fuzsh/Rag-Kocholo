        "text": "Making it to the NBA is difficult, but some families are born to play basketball. Father and son duos aren't uncommon in the association, and while many stayed under the radar during their career, others have made a significant impact on the sport.\n\nDell and Stephen Curry are pretty much legends when it comes to three-pointers, while Doc Rivers is the first man to coach his son at the professional level. Keep scrolling; the apple doesn't fall far from the tree with these father-son duos.\n\nBill Walton And Luke Walton\n\nBill Walton was the overall number one pick in the 1974 NBA draft, selected by the Portland Trail Blazers. A few years later, Walter helped his team win the 1977 NBA finals, receiving the MVP Award in the process.\n\nHe won the championship one more time with the Celtics, before retiring in 1990. But that doesn't mean the name Walton was left in the dust. His son, Luke, was drafted to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2003 and is currently coaching the Sacramento Kings."
