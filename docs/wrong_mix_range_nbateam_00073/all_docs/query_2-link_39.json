        "text": "With 10 minutes to go in the third quarter of Game 2, the Los Angeles Lakers led the Denver Nuggets by 20 points. They would go on to lose by two, on a spectacular buzzer-beater by Jamal Murray.\n\nThis loss marks Los Angeles’ 10th consecutive loss to Denver, and has them staring at a 0-2 series deficit.\n\nLakers Stars Sound off Following Game 2 Loss to Nuggets\n\nFrustration was evident in the Lakers locker room and postgame interviews, including LeBron James storming out of his press conference.\n\nD’Angelo Russell and Anthony Davis also shared their opinions on what wrong for the Lakers in Game 2.\n\nLakers’ Russell on Team Performance Against Nuggets and Officiating\n\nRussell was one of the main contributors for the Lakers, pouring in 23 points on 7-11 shooting from deep. The point guard appeared rather optimistic when discussing his team’s performance.\n\n“We just missed a few shots down that stretch when they were throwing haymakers. Simple as that. I like where we were at, I like the chance we gave ourselves…We did a lot of good things that gave us an opportunity to win all night. I like our fight.”\n\nThe 28 year-old did share his frustrations with the officiating, including Denver’s Michael Porter Jr.‘s foul in the third quarter being overturned.\n\n“A few questionable calls that really dictated a lot of movements forward. It is what it is, we all saw it…It came down to some things we couldn’t really control.”\n\nRussell later took to social media to continue to plead his case.\n\nLakers’ Davis Postgame on Offensive Rhythm and Game 3\n\nDavis was a dominant force for much of the game, scoring 32 points on 14-19 shooting from the field. However, the Lakers big man’s last points came with 7:15 left in the third quarter.\n\nDavis cut a frustrated figure in his postgame press conference when asked about why the team went away from the game plan that he was thriving on.\n\n“We had something working. Just trying to put [Nikola] Jokić in the pick and roll, and Michael Porter[Jr.]. [We] had some success doing so, and that’s what we went to in the second half.”\n\nDavis offered a glimpse into the Lakers mindset as they return home to host the Nuggets for the next two games.\n\n“Just got to focus on Game 3. We’ve shown that we’re more than capable. We have stretches where we don’t know what we’re doing on both ends of the floor, and those are the ones that cost us. We’ve got two days to get it right and come ready to win Game 3 on Thursday.”\n\nThe nine-time NBA All-Star cut his press conference short, visibly annoyed at a question regarding his defense on Murray’s game-winning shot."
