        "text": "For the better part of this decade, Bob Myers has been the franchise face of some of the most Warriors-friendly deals in history, either drafting, retaining or signing the group of legends who will come to define this era. He’s the general manager, president and architect of a sports behemoth.\n\nBut in the decade before, he was on the other side of one of those negotiating wins that always went against the Warriors, keeping them in a perpetual place of NBA irrelevance. He was part of the agency representing Mike Dunleavy Jr.\n\nThere were more detrimental deals than Dunleavy’s, wayyyyyyy more detrimental — $50 million for a declining Corey Maggette, $35 million for Jason Caffey, anyone? — but the five-year, $44 million extension Dunleavy got in November 2005 proved a bit of a Warriors’ overpay, serving as a further agitiation for Dunleavy’s rocky relationship with a booing, frustrated fanbase.\n\nThat’s one of the pitfalls in sports: You want to be drafted high. You want to sign a nice contract. But once you achieve those goals, those labels follow and sometimes haunt you. Yeah, you may be a good player, but are you third-overall-pick good? Yeah, you might produce nice numbers, but is it $9-million-per-season level output?\n\nThe Warriors lost 61 games during the 2001-02 season. So did the Bulls. They tied for the worst record in basketball, giving them equal odds — 22.5 percent — to win the lottery. Yao Ming was the prize. The Warriors and their fans, knowing what kind of player and marketing opportunity Yao represented, desperately wanted to win the lottery.\n\nThey didn’t. The Rockets, with an 8.9 percent chance, did. They got Yao. The Bulls, drafting second, got Jay Williams. The Warriors, drafting third, got Dunleavy. He went on to have a better careers than Drew Gooden or Nikoloz Tskitishvili or Dajuan Wagner, the three guys drafted right after him.\n\nBut Warriors fans weren’t concerned with the alternatives. They saw Yao, an immediate star in Houston, and Dunleavy, a steady role player with an obvious long-term ceiling below the All-Star floor. The team kept losing because of much bigger issues. The organization had more harmful problems. But Dunleavy often felt the brunt of the Oracle Arena boos because of that third overall pick label and then the price tag on his extension.\n\n“Looking back on it, I probably didn’t have the right mindset to be the third pick,” Dunleavy said Wednesday. “You gotta go out and put up numbers and I was probably too team oriented and interested in getting the team better, playing together with my teammates. I probably should’ve been more aggressive, should’ve launched, done all that stuff.”\n\nDunleavy was traded as part of a package to the Pacers in January 2007, proving to be a useful chip. The return included Stephen Jackson and Al Harrington. Dunleavy went on to have a solid career. The Warriors — after making the playoffs immediately after acquiring Jackson and Harrington and then collapsing again for several years — eventually exited the abyss directly into utopia. All turned out great for both sides, even if the original partnership left some bitterness.\n\nBut the circle of life has presented an opportunity for relationship mending. Dunleavy is back with the Warriors. Through Myers, his agent turned friend, Dunleavy, now retired, has signed on to become a pro scout. He will live in New York, sending Eastern Conference intel back to the front office, but this week he has been in Oakland attending Warriors training camp.\n\nHe got a bit nostalgic with reporters on Wednesday, saying the building looks much the same as he left it, except for the “three things over there that are new,” pointing to the NBA title banners. Then he recalled a story from his third training camp, already on his second coach, when things weren’t quite as rosy.\n\n“When you come in the NBA, I had a certain perspective growing up around it, my dad being a coach,” Dunleavy said of his father, Mike Sr. “So you have these expectations of what it’s going to be. Then those first couple years, it just wasn’t that here, for many reasons.\n\n“I’ll just never forget when Coach (Mike) Montgomery took over, I think it was my third year. He had come from college, I think he had expectations of what the NBA was all about. And first day of practice, we’re doing layup drills and Eduardo Najera is shooting layups off the shot clock. And Mike Montgomery is just spinning, can’t believe it: ‘This is what I signed up for?’ Eddy was a great guy, a great teammate, but it was, yeah, this is kinda how things are going around here. For the team, for the organization, this is it, man.”\n\nHe recognizes the change now. It’s impossible not to. The building looks the same. The inhabitants are much different.\n\n“It really is,” Dunleavy said. “When I was here, I felt pretty confident that we had a strength in two areas. Our two best things were our equipment guy (Eric Housen) and our PR guy (Raymond Ridder). Ironically, those are the two things that have stayed. Everything else has changed and everything else has taken off. They got some really good players in here finally, a great coach, ownership on down has done an amazing job.”\n\nAfter Dunleavy was done meeting with reporters, The Athletic sat down with Myers to discuss his history with Dunleavy and the importance of Dunleavy’s new role with the Warriors. Here’s the transcript.\n\nSo you and Mike go way back.\n\nYeah. What year was he drafted?\n\nThe Yao Ming draft, 2002.\n\nYeah, met him then. Arn (Tellem, then Myers’ boss) represented him. Yeah, he was here. Was (Antawn) Jamison gone then? I think he was gone. Jamison (another Myers client) was here before. But I knew Mike’s father. His father was coaching the Clippers. His little brother’s an agent, his other brother coaches basketball. So I’ve known his family. They lived pretty close to where I lived.\n\nSo you have an even more unique perspective on it because not only were you his longtime agent, you were a Warriors fan growing up in the area. How do you remember his career here? Obviously, a lot of pressure coming in as the third pick.\n\nI don’t know that it was specific to him, but this organization had so much volatility. How many coaches did he have here? He had (Eric) Musselman. Who else did he have?\n\nMike Montgomery.\n\nYeah, Montgomery. Then (Don) Nelson. Did he have Nelson? There was just so much turnover, no stability.\n\nYeah, he had Nelson at the end. That’s when they traded him to Indiana.\n\nYeah, so he had three coaches in four years, five years. Two new coaches in Musselman and Montgomery. It’s tough for young players to have that many coaches early. Then the organization was still trying to find his footing. Young players, in my experience, need a solid foundation. You enter the league, Mike or anyone else, it’s important to have a culture that’s existed, some experience winning.\n\nBut the organization was trying to figure it out. I think he was good (with the Warriors). The fans, obviously our fans, the Warriors fans, they care to such a high level. So they’re not apathetic. I don’t know what he’d say, but he probably left thinking there was some unfinished business.\n\nWell, you have the third-overall-pick tag that you walk into. Then he signs that good deal here, but you know how it works. Once it’s signed, then the deal is your story, that weight you carry around.\n\nYeah, right. But again, Mike, I look at Mike as a player who could be a guy on a championship team. Knows how to play, has size, skill, shooting. But I think the league was still trying to figure it out. He might be a (power forward) now. I don’t know. But he could handle, pass, shoot, knew the game, was pretty athletic coming out.\n\nSo it’s one of those things, where, if they expected him to be the man, that’s not what he was supposed to be. But I guess you’re right, when you’re picked that high, that label comes with it sometimes.\n\nHe mentioned that in his later years, there was some talk about him coming here as a vet on some of these more recent teams. How close was that?\n\nYeah, a guy like that, you’re always exploring it. Now we’re at the point where Steph (Curry), Klay (Thompson), Draymond (Green), Kevin (Durant), those are our veterans. But for awhile, they weren’t. Steph, Klay and Draymond were young, Shaun (Livingston) and Andre (Iguodala) were older, but not a lot older. So we were looking for vets.\n\nYou always want guys who are professional. One thing that anybody who worked with Mike — played with him, coached him, for me, it was represented him — he was professional. His father was a coach. Played in a lot of different situations, but always did his work, maintained his professionalism. You always want guys like that.\n\nI’ve chatted with some people who believe he’s going to be very good at this front-office, player-evaluation type role. What do you see, why is he appealing for this job?\n\nWell, that’s nice to hear. Probably, one, relationships. He knows quite a few people. I asked him yesterday, ‘Who do you know here?’ He said, ‘Well, Shaun, my dad drafted him’ and then, ‘Klay, he used to come over to our house in Portland.’ Hung out with Mike’s little brother, James, who is an agent now.\n\nThis business, as you know, is so much about relationships. Elton Brand is the GM of the Sixers. Well, Mike knows Elton Brand (from Duke). Shane Battier’s down in Miami working for the Heat. He played at Duke with Battier. They’re friends.\n\nThe thing that I think is hardest to cultivate in this business if you’re new is relationships. It takes time. It takes years. Well, he walks in and knows this guy, played with that guy, played for that guy.\n\nSo I think he’s going to be good, one, because he has those relationships, but, two, because he’s been around the game so long. His whole life, really. He’s watched it evolve. His dad coached the Trail Blazers and Clippers. Those things help you.\n\nHow about just as a straight-up talent evaluator? Sounds like you guys felt you were light on that role.\n\nI value his opinion. He’s respected. If he were to walk over to Steve Kerr right now and give an opinion on practice, Steve would listen to him. He has that kind of regard. So I think he’ll be a good evaluator because playing the game at a high level, playing with players, playing for different coaches, gives you a different lens into this.\n\nThen the other thing, we make all these big decisions, big signings, big trades where I felt like we didn’t have enough coverage. There’s no substitute for watching something live. That’s why we scout.\n\nWe scout a lot of college. We have two college scouts. We didn’t have a dedicated pro guy. Travis Schlenk used to do some pro work for us. He’d go to NBA games separate from ours. I don’t have time to go to our games, college games, other NBA games.\n\nSo my best example, fast-forward to 2019, we’re looking for a wing player, a point guard, a big guy: ‘Hey, Mike, what do you think about this guy? He played in the Eastern Conference.’ Mike’s gonna be based out of New York. Maybe he’ll say, ‘OK, let me look at my notes. I saw him play six times. This is what I thought of him.’\n\nWhereas me, Player X came into Oracle and had 25 points. That’s my only recollection of him. And I’m like, ‘Hey, this guy’s great!’ Then he goes, ‘Well, I saw him a lot more than that and I’m not so sure.’\n\nHe’s also at the games watching players warm up, watching guys work, watching how they interact with their coaches. ‘This guy, I saw his interaction with coaches, doesn’t look like he wants to work.’ That’s important. It’s probably becoming more commonplace in the league, I don’t know, but the pro scouting position is something I think every team has one guy doing, if not more.\n\n(Top photo: Stephen Gosling/NBAE via Getty Images)"
