        "text": "On Friday, USC wing Bronny James announced that he’ll declare for the 2024 NBA Draft. However, he’ll remain in the transfer portal. Maintaining his college eligibility by refusing to sign an agent, James is now free to explore all his options after underperforming as a freshman.\n\nIf he should transfer, James has been linked to the Duquesne Dukes.\n\nBronny James Linked to Dru Joyce, Duquesne After Declaring for Draft\n\nPer ESPN insider Adrian Wojnarowski, Duquesne “is expected to be among his prominent considerations.”\n\nMeanwhile, according to 247 Sports director of scouting Adam Finkelstein, “the other variable to note (in James’ future outlook) is that [LeBron James’] very close friend Dru Joyce was just named the new head coach at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, where LeBron’s high school coach Keith Dambrot just announced his retirement.”\n\n“If for some reason, the NBA and the (Los Angeles) Lakers are not an option,” Finkelstein continues, “does Duquesne become something that a month ago or two months ago, the James Family was not willing to consider but now may be willing to send him there to play a more highlighted role and show people what he’s capable of doing?”\n\nNotably, James is the person who broke the news of his high school teammate’s hire.\n\nDuquesne has won at least 20 games in their last two seasons. This season, they earned their first NCAA Tournament berth in 50 years.\n\nHowever, per On3, they have no commits in the Class of 2024. Furthermore, all of their current players were unranked high school recruits. James would be their most highly-touted prospect.\n\nWith fifth-year seniors Dae Dae Grant and Jimmy Carter —their only players to average double-figures in scoring —set to graduate, he has an even greater chance to have a major role. It’s a much different situation than at USC. The Trojans had a crowded backcourt and 2023’s top high school recruit, Isaiah Collier.\n\nThe presence of Joyce underscores all of this. The 39-year-old will do everything in his power to help James reach his potential. To that point, former USC head coach Andy Enfield largely limited James to an off-ball role. Joyce may empower him as an on-ball playmaker.\n\nBronny to the Lakers?\n\nAs for his NBA future, James was once projected to be a first-round pick in the 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nThose dreams may not have dissipated. However, they’re more fantasy than reality after James averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 0.8 steals in 19.3 points per game at USC. Furthermore, though considered a 3-and-D prospect, James shot just 26.7 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Lakers, who employ father LeBron, have been linked to the 19-year-old. Bringing father and son together could entice the elder James to stay in L.A. and jump-start the career of his firstborn. The Lakers likely care far more about the former than the latter. Nonetheless, the logic is sound regardless of their position on the younger James.\n\nTo that point, any franchise interested in acquiring the 20-time All-Star will likely consider drafting his son."
