I had that honor and pleasure to be friends with him even though we did not play together,\" Danilovic said at a formal commemoration for Milojevi ć on Saturday.\n\nMarko Keelj, of Serbia's Ministry of Sports and a former basketball player, said the sport was Milojevi ć 's life.\n\n\"With his positive energy. he brought out the best in us,\" Keelj said. \"He motivated us to be better in every way, as people and as players. Deki was a friend, mentor, he was a leader.\"\n\nMilojevi ć was in his third season with the Warriors. He previously coached in Serbia -- where he once worked with a young Jokic before the current Denver Nuggets star came to the United States -- along with Montenegro, and had been an assistant coach for the Serbian national team alongside current Hawks assistant Igor Kokokov.\n\nMilojevi ć worked closely with Jokic, Clippers center Ivica Zubac, Magic center Goga Bitadze and Rockets center Boban Marjanovic, among others, during his time as a coach in Europe.\n\nMORE:Warriors honor assistant coach Dejan Milojevi ć in 1st game back since his passing\n\nMilojevi ć won three consecutive MVP awards in the Adriatic League, which comprises teams from former Yugoslavia, taking those trophies in 2004, 2005 and 2006 when the 6-foot-7, 240-pound power forward was at the peak of his playing career. Jokic was MVP of that league in 2015.\n\nBefore joining the Warriors, Milojevi ć had NBA experience through summer league assistant-coaching stints with Atlanta, San Antonio and Houston.\n\nMORE: Doctors give essentials for heart health, recommend special scan after Warriors coach dies\n\nKerr and the Warriors' other representative will not return in time for Monday's game against the Utah Jazz. Assistant coach Kenny Atkinson will act as head coach for Monday's game.\n\nMilojevi ć is survived by his wife, Nataa, and their children, Nikola and Maa."
