        "text": "The Coach\n\nQuinnipiac Playbook - Baker Dunleavy by Bryan Applin only $10\n\nBaker Dunleavy, who was the associate head coach for a national-title winning team at Villanova in 2016, enters his third season as the head coach of the Quinnipiac men's basketball program in 2019-20.Dunleavy was named head coach for Quinnipiac University's men's basketball program on March 28, 2017, becoming its seventh head coach in Quinnipiac's 67-year basketball history, and the third in its 19 years at the Division I level. He has led the Bobcats to the MAAC Semifinals in his first season in 2017-18, then guided Quinnipiac to a postseason appearance (CIT) for just the fifth time in program history in 2018-19.\n\nIn his debut season, Dunleavy helped Quinnipiac to a seventh-place finish in the regular season and a strong run through the MAAC Tournament. The Bobcats had a big win over Siena in the opening round, and then knocked off the No. 2 seed and co-regular season champion Canisius in the quarterfinal round. His rookie campaign on the Quinnipiac sideline also saw him help develop Cameron Young, who did not score in six games played the year prior, into a second-team All-MAAC selection who broke the school's Division I record for points in a season (622).\n\nA member of a well-known basketball family, Dunleavy's older brother, Mike Dunleavy Jr., won a national championship as a player at Duke and recently completed his 15th NBA season with the Atlanta Hawks. Their father, Mike Dunleavy Sr., also played 10 years in the NBA and served as head coach for four NBA franchises (Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers, Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Clippers)."
