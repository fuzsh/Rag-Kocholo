        "text": "The Warriors have endured a trying offseason so far. In the aftermath of a brutal defeat in the play-in tournament, they knew changes had to be made. The first order of business was making a choice on Klay Thompson, who ended up leaving the Warriors for the first time in his career. As a Maverick now, Thompson's stint alongside Curry is officially at an end and many have been wondering what it means for the future of Steph and Draymond.\n\nFor Green, his role as the defensive anchor of the team is likely what will keep him in a Warriors jersey for now -- and his ability to play every position makes him a unique and versatile weapon on the floor. After causing trouble in the locker room and sowing division among the players, many thought he had played his last games with the franchise. But without a proper haul in return, the Warriors are better off keeping their enforcer and hoping that he still has enough left in the tank to lead the Warriors' defense.\n\nOf course, the most important thing for the Warriors is Curry. The 2x MVP is not only a legend of the NBA, he's the savior of the Warriors franchise and the one responsible for their status as a modern-day NBA dynasty. The 10x All-Star turned 26 in March, but he hasn't yet lost a step on the court with averages of 26.4 points, 5.1 assists, and 4.5 rebounds per game on 45.0% shooting last season.\n\nDrafted 7th overall in 2009, Curry started on the Warriors when they were just a blip on the radar in the West but over time, he transformed them into one of the most recognized and valuable teams in all of the major sports. Today, 15 years and four championships later, he's still going strong and the Warriors are determined to surround him with as much help as possible until the end.\n\nWith two years and $114 million left on his deal, Curry is locked in until 2026 but he is expected to sign an extension with the Warriors that will keep him on the payroll until the end of his career. After everything he's done for the franchise, it makes sense that they'd want him to stay in their uniform for the entirety of his career.\n\nThe task of returning back to title contention, however, is not nearly as easy. Even with Steph, Draymond, Andrew Wiggins, and championship coach Steve Kerr, the Warriors finished 10th in the West and would be underdogs to advance in any series against the elites like squads like the Timberwolves, Nuggets, Mavericks, and Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nAfter Klay's departure, there will be a major hole that needs to be filled but the promise of playing with Curry could be enough to lure reinforcements and help the legendary franchise return to their status as one of the best in the West."
