        "text": "Caron Butler Receives First Long Term Extension\n\nOne long-standing strength of the Miami Heat is its respected and experienced coaching staff. Miami also presents a common theme running through their assistant coaching ranks—four of them are former Heat players. Chris Quinn, Malik Allen, and Wayne Ellington are three of them. The fourth? Caron Butler.\n\nThe 16-year NBA player and four-year assistant coach with the Heat has re-upped on a four-year extension, according to top ESPN analyst and NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nButler’s Coaching Experience Is Backed By His Respected Playing Career\n\nButler spent much of his NBA career as a solid defender and rebounder, winning a championship in 2011 with the Dallas Mavericks. He played for nine teams in his long career and earned much respect and admiration. Butler joined the Miami Heat coaching staff with no prior NBA coaching experience. Yet, since joining the bench four years ago, he has been a stable coaching cornerstone behind Miami head coach Erik Spoelstra, alongside fellow assistant coach Chris Quinn.\n\nThis contract extension is a clear indication of the value that Miami Heat President Pat Riley and Erik Spoelstra place on Butler. It’s evident that Butler is not just a coach, but one of Spoelstra’s most trusted partners. Last year, Miami’s front office tasked Butler with the responsibility of leading the Heat’s G-League squad, the Sioux Falls Skyforce, as their head coach in Summer League. However, Butler’s influence and reputation extend far beyond the borders of Miami.\n\nButler Was Respected By One Of the Greats\n\nThe great Kobe Bryant‘s reputation hardly ever included being an open teammate. However, that wasn’t the case with Butler. The two played together for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2005, and Kobe later stated that he and Butler became close friends. The Black Mamba further mentioned that Butler was one of his favorite teammates he ever played with.\n\n“When that happens, it makes the season better. It doesn’t always happen. It’s not something that I need to happen, but there are certain players that I just automatically get along with. You gravitate to each other because you are eye to eye on things, and you get along extremely well. And Caron was one of those players.”\n\nExtensions For Other Miami Assistants\n\nIn January, Miami extended Erik Spoelstra to an eight-year contract. Assistant coaches Chris Quinn and Malik Allen are also earning extensions, according to AP Sports writer Tim Reynolds.\n\nInvesting In Miami Heat’s Coaches Is Part Of the Blueprint\n\nMiami’s success starts with The Godfather, Pat Riley, and trickles down the pipes to the floor. Undoubtedly one of, if not the top NBA coaching staffs the league boasts, Miami’s perpetuate to unveil the epitome of coaching and leadership carries on. Butler’s extension is one of a few vital Miami Heat coaching extensions that have taken place this year. It is well deserved, as the Heat continue investing in their culture and coaches."
