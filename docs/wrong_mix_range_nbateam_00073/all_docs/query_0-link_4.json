        "text": "RENO, Nev. – When the Houston Rockets unofficially won the offseason by landing big man Dwight Howard as a free agent in July, they had every reason to think their winning ways would continue from there.\n\nYet this upgraded operation hasn't been quite as potent as they'd hoped, with injuries largely to blame but good, old-fashioned underachieving playing as big a part as any. Entering Thursday, Houston has lost eight of its last 18 games and fallen to fifth place in the Western Conference. So it is, then, that a safe assumption can be made about this Rockets team that has been rebuilt by one of the league's most aggressive executives in general manager Daryl Morey: With the Feb. 20 trade deadline nearing, they're not done dealing yet.\n\nThis goes beyond the widely known desire to grant the trade request of disgruntled center Omer Asik – although for anyone wondering, it now appears more likely that he'll remain with the Rockets past the deadline than it does he'll be dealt. This is about Morey canvassing the league for the sort of talent that can help his team fulfill its own lofty expectations. As is stands, this much is clear: The Rockets are on the lookout for more help on the perimeter, with a focus on finding someone who can provide more punch behind overburdened shooting guard James Harden (he's second in the league in minutes per game at 38.7).\n\nAccording to a person with knowledge of the Rockets' thinking, Chicago Bulls small forward Mike Dunleavy is high on their wish list as the deadline nears. The person spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because a team's plans aren't typically discussed publicly. The Rockets haven't acted on this impulse just yet, as a person with knowledge of the Bulls' dealings said Houston has yet to call to discuss a possible deal. And while Chicago's trade of Luol Deng to Cleveland this week had rival executives wondering if the Bulls would now continue breaking up their band, Dunleavy – who signed as a free agent last summer – is held in extremely high regard by his current bosses and there will certainly be a hefty price to pay for anyone who comes calling.\n\nDunleavy has one of the more-efficient contracts in the NBA, as he is earning $3 million both this season and next while averaging 10.7 points (45.5% shooting overall, 39% from three-point range) 3.7 rebounds and 28.2 minutes per game. Rockets wingman Francisco Garcia has been playing the role that would presumably become Dunleavy's if they could find a way to do this deal, and a peek at his production is evidence enough as to why they are on the lookout here: he's averaging 6.4 points (39.5% shooting overall and 34.3% from three-point range) while playing 20.8 minutes per game.\n\nThe Rockets clearly realize they're not elite just yet, that more moves might be needed to put them where they want to be come playoff time. If the season ended today, the home-court playoff advantage that was on their short list of goals entering the season would not be theirs. Howard has played well (17.8 points, 12.9 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game), but adding the three-time Defensive Player of the Year has had no discernible impact on the Rockets' defense.\n\nAfter ranking 16th in points allowed per 100 possessions last season (103.5), they're ranked 16th this season at 102.9. The offense, meanwhile, is even more elite than before: they were sixth in points per 100 possessions last season at 106.7, and are third this season at 107.5. Getting Dunleavy or some other perimeter player may not fix all that ails them, but it would help.\n\nThere's an end game here that no one has forgotten, and least of all Morey. Landing Howard meant the revamped Rockets were now considered legitimate contenders, but they look like anything but at the moment. Time, and perhaps a move or two, will tell this tale."
