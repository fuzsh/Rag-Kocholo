        "text": "So how exactly were they able to land Jackson-Davis with the 57th pick? Contracts are not guaranteed for second-rounders. Teams will often use those picks to draft-and-stash an international prospect or, more recently, find someone that they can give a two-way contract. Jackson-Davis was a victim of that newer strategy. He’d later learn that right around the 35th pick, almost every team began calling his agency — led by James Dunleavy, the brother of Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy — indicating a desire to draft Jackson-Davis. But they wanted Jackson-Davis to accept a two-way contract, not a guaranteed roster spot. That’s a team-friendly, restrictive contractual starting point for a rookie. Jackson-Davis wanted a guaranteed deal. So his agency kept nudging him away from inquiring teams unwilling to guarantee a deal. A second-round tumble began. Jackson-Davis, in frustration, tweeted: “Y’all will regret it. I promise you.”\n\nTrayce Jackson-Davis to sign three-year deal with Warriors\n\nTrayce Jackson-Davis plans to sign a three-year deal with a team option in Year 3, a league source told Fieldhouse Files. And new Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr., a former Pacer, said Jackson-Davis will be part of the 15-man roster right away. That’s important because most players selected after about 40 are headed either for a two-way deal or non-guaranteed contract. Oh, and Jackson-Davis’ agent? That’s James Dunleavy — Mike’s brother."
