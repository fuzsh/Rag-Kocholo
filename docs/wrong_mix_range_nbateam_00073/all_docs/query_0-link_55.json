        "text": "Chuck Hayes played 11 seasons in the NBA and is currently listed as a \"Pro Personnel Scout\" for the Houston Rockets.\n\nOn Friday, Michael Scotto of HoopsHype reported that Hayes will likely join the Golden State Warriors front office.\n\nVia Scotto: \"The Golden State Warriors plan to hire Chuck Hayes for a front office position with the team, league sources told @hoopshype.\"\n\nThe Warriors had a significant change in their front office this summer when Bob Myers stepped down as the President of Basketball Operations.\n\nHe was a two-time Executive of The Year and was with the franchise since 2011, when he was initially the assistant general manager.\n\nMyers became the general manager in 2012 and helped build a team that made the NBA Finals six times (and won four titles) from 2015-22.\n\nMike Dunleavy Jr. officially replaced Myers last month and was named as the team's new general manager.\n\nAs for Hayes, he played for the Houston Rockets, Sacramento Kings and Toronto Raptors over his 11 seasons in the league.\n\nThe former Kentucky star had career averages of 3.7 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.2 assists per contest while shooting 49.8% from the field in 644 regular season games (he also appeared in 31 NBA playoff games).\n\nHe is currently 40 years old and has been retired since the 2016 season.\n\nMeanwhile, the Warriors are coming off a year where they were the sixth seed in the Western Conference and had a 44-38 record.\n\nThey lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the second round of the NBA playoffs."
