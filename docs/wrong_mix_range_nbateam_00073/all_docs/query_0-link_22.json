How ready is Dunleavy for Lacob’s call/text/talk-all-night mania? Well, Lacob said with a big smile, it was actually Dunleavy who called Lacob early that morning with an idea.\n\nLacob, of course, embraced the wired energy of it all. But you could tell that Lacob also liked the idea and that he was thinking about it. That it struck a chord. That there was something creative going on here.\n\nI’m not saying that I know this was when Dunleavy proposed the surprising Jordan Poole-for-Chris Paul trade with the Wizards. It could’ve been something entirely different. Dunleavy sure gave every indication at the presser that he supported Poole and his contract extension and said, “We plan on having him four more years at least.”\n\nBut that was the day I started hearing rumblings that the Warriors were interested in Paul, that they believed he could fit in with old rivals Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson and that they were hoping to check in with Paul in the wake of his reported trade from the Suns to the Wizards.\n\nRead more here.\n\n(Photo: Jed Jacobsohn / Getty Images)\n\nWhat came first for the Warriors: The idea about landing Chris Paul or the desire to unload Jordan Poole?\n\nThat’s not the only question surrounding last week’s big trade, which sent Poole, Patrick Baldwin Jr. and Ryan Rollins to the Wizards and rerouted Paul to the Warriors on his way out of Phoenix. When a talented 24-year-old and two 20-year-olds get traded for a 38-year-old point guard on a team that is not lacking 30-somethings, actuarial-table questions absolutely should be raised.\n\nBut right now, I’m focused on the thought process and the priority order of this trade, because if you can figure those out, you can understand almost everything the Warriors are thinking about themselves right now as the Mike Dunleavy Jr. era begins. You can identify how the Warriors are preparing for the future. You can see what might come next.\n\nWhat’s clear to me after a few days of checking around is that this all began when the Warriors decided that Poole was an extraneous and inefficient member of their roster. That was the precipitating issue. The Warriors wanted out of the $123 million deal they gave Poole only eight months earlier because his play last season didn’t meet that value, especially given their extreme luxury-tax pressures. They knew he wanted a bigger role and they knew that almost certainly wouldn’t happen as long as Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson were on the team.\n\nThe Warriors weren’t going to give Poole away, but they were ready to move on if the right deal came along.\n\nRead more here.\n\n(Photo: Christian Petersen / Getty Images)\n\nNBA superteams can form quickly, suddenly. When, in the summer of 2010, LeBron James announced his decision to take his talents to South Beach, Heat center Joel Anthony didn’t see it coming.\n\nAnthony was in his Miami apartment, a couple of blocks from what was then American Airlines Arena, just off Biscayne Boulevard. The Heat already had enjoyed a strong offseason, getting franchise star Dwyane Wade to re-sign and working a trade for All-Star forward Chris Bosh. Anthony didn’t think there was a chance LeBron would join them.\n\nAnd then, making the announcement on national television, he did.\n\nAnthony walked over to his apartment window. He always kept his blinds open so he could see the water in the distance. This time he saw fireworks exploding over downtown Miami. His phone started blowing up with text messages. “Congratulations! You’re going to be a champion!”\n\n“It was crazy,” Anthony said recently.\n\nNBA “superteams” have been around since the days of Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West. Some have grown organically, but most have been formed through trade or free agency. Once viewed as a shortcut to a championship, it’s now common practice. Stars want to play together. Stars want to win. The Phoenix Suns have joined the championship-or-bust discussion.\n\nThe recent trade for Bradley Beal gives new head coach Frank Vogel three of the league’s most lethal scorers. Kevin Durant has captured four league scoring titles. Beal has twice averaged more than 30 points per game over a season. Devin Booker has put up 25-plus for most of his eight-year career. The Suns could be an offensive machine.\n\n“Nobody can fault Phoenix for doing this,” said former NBA coach Randy Wittman, who coached Beal for four years with the Washington Wizards. “It’s an opportunity that doesn’t always come around when you can add somebody like Bradley Beal, who’s still in the prime of his career, to try and take a run at winning it all.”\n\nBut the superteam fireworks are just the opening chapter. A “Big 3” provides excitement and attention but guarantees little else. Winning a title requires more. The Athletic talked with players and coaches from previous superteams to get a better understanding of what the Suns will need to do to make this work.\n\nRead more here.\n\n(Photo: Barry Gossage / Getty Images)\n\nChris Paul is a Warrior.\n\nThat reality alone is enough to question whether we’ve transported to another universe. But it gets even more trippy.\n\nChris Paul is possibly coming off the bench for the Steph Curry-led Warriors, and certainly embracing a role as Curry’s co-star. Ten years ago, this would be blasphemous. Five years ago, unlikely. A day ago, I would’ve said no way.\n\nLooks like Curry was right. He said “this ain’t 2014 no mo” and he wasn’t lying.\n\nChris Paul is a Warrior.\n\nThis is like Green Goblin joining forces with Spider-Man. Mentor and friend turned rival — turned ally again. Next, Diddy will join Death Row Records.\n\nThere is some poetry to this Golden State bombshell, some intrigue in this plot twist. But it’s set up to be a heartwarming punctuation to the relationship of Curry and Paul. One that’s at least 15 years deep.\n\nThere is something noble about both of them doing this, Paul for humbling himself and Curry for respecting an OG. Warriors fans won’t like it, having spent the better part of a decade rooting against Paul in the name of Curry. But Curry doesn’t seem to mind.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors have agreed to a draft-day blockbuster, sending Jordan Poole to the Washington Wizards for Chris Paul in Mike Dunleavy Jr.’s first major move as the new general manager of the Warriors. Let’s sort through the initial shockwaves.\n\nWhat is this trade about for the Warriors?\n\nThe Warriors are intent on maximizing Steph Curry’s fading title window. There is an internal belief that Chris Paul, who will turn 39 during next year’s playoffs, will better serve that 2024 goal as the team’s third guard than Jordan Poole, who turned 24 this week.\n\nNeither is coming off a great end to the season. Poole struggled relentlessly in the playoffs and Paul was injured again. But there also is the financial factor. Poole was stepping into a four-year, $123 million extension beginning next season. Paul has $30.8 million on his deal this upcoming season and then a non-guaranteed $30 million the following season, giving the Warriors far more flexibility as they intend to duck under the second tax apron and the subsequent penalties in the newest CBA.\n\nRead more here.\n\nStop the presses! The Washington Wizards have traded for a first-round pick. And more importantly, Chris Paul will be headed to help an old thorn in his side, the Golden State Warriors. The Athletic’s Shams Charania is reporting the Warriors are sending Jordan Poole, a protected 2030 first-round pick and a 2027 second-round pick to Washington in exchange for Paul.\n\nFor years on the court, Steph Curry and the Warriors terrorized Paul, who was consistently thwarted when he was with the LA Clippers and the Houston Rockets. Now, he’ll try to help this core of players win their fifth NBA championship and finally get his first title. For the Wizards, the exodus continues as they seem to make a trade every day in the Michael Winger front-office era, but this time some long-term tangible assets are coming back to them.\n\nLet’s bust out the red pen and slap some grades on this trade.\n\nThe wee hours of Wednesday night packed more drama than the Celtics would have anticipated. They appeared to be closing in on a three-team trade to land Kristaps Porziņģis earlier in the day, but the initial framework of that deal fell apart, leaving the Boston front office scrambling to stitch the idea back together. Shortly before midnight, the Celtics netted Porziņģis but did so in a far different deal than the one they initially agreed upon.\n\nAs part of a three-team trade, league sources said, the Celtics will send out Marcus Smart to Memphis plus Danilo Gallinari, Mike Muscala and the 35th pick in Thursday night’s draft to Washington. The Celtics will acquire Porziņģis from the Wizards, plus the 25th pick in this year’s draft and the Golden State Warriors’ first-round pick in next year’s draft from Memphis. The Grizzlies will send Tyus Jones to Washington in the deal, which will go down as a Celtics stunner.\n\nThey salvaged the deal after all? They acquired Porziņģis and still picked up two additional first-round selections? And they gave up Smart, Mr. Celtic, who spent the first nine seasons of his career in Boston without once missing the playoffs?\n\nRead more here.\n\n(Photo: Patrick Smith / Getty Images)\n\nWe had ourselves a normal one, huh?\n\nFor all the wheeling and dealing that happened in the three days before the NBA Draft, and all the talk that lottery picks would be in play on the trade market, nobody did anything truly wild and crazy on draft night. Sure, there were one or two reaches, one big slide and the usual mystery Euro at the end of the night. But all in all, this was one of the chalkiest drafts I can remember. By and large, the vast majority of players went within a few spots of where they were projected.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the draft was uneventful, though. In particular, several things happened that will set the stage for the upcoming free-agency frenzy this weekend at 6 p.m. ET June 30, when teams can start negotiating with other teams’ free agents.\n\nRead more here.\n\n(Photo: Jeff Haynes / Getty Images)\n\nTalent is a prerequisite. In the NBA, if you are going to win — and win big — you must be one of the league’s most skilled, cohesive teams. To reach the highest level of competition, to truly be in championship contention, you have to stack awesome player atop awesome player. And then, you must make it fit.\n\nIn the lead-up to and the aftermath of the Raptors’ 2019 NBA championship, then-coach Nick Nurse made reference to his group of “special players.” Kawhi Leonard, when healthy, is an all-timer. Kyle Lowry is probably heading for the Hall of Fame, and Marc Gasol has a 50-50 chance of joining him there. Fred VanVleet and Pascal Siakam were third-year players who went on to sign their next contracts for a combined $222 million. Norman Powell’s next contract earned him $20 million per year. Serge Ibaka was a three-time First-Team All-Defensive selection who accepted a lesser role, while Danny Green is one of the great glue guys in modern league history. The 2018-19 Raptors weren’t the happiest NBA team of all-time, but they liked each other enough to win when it mattered. A year later, even with Leonard and Green gone, they were among the best teams in the league — and, yes, also the happiest.\n\nAssembling that much talent is very, very difficult and requires a whole bunch of work and luck. If you don’t want to get too excited about the prospect of watching the 2023-24 Raptors because they are likely to look a lot like the 2022-23 Raptors, strictly from a reading-the-roster perspective, that’s fair. This team won 48 games two years ago and just 41 last year. The starting point guard and centre are free agents, each possible flight risks with no obvious Plan B for either. The Raptors will have to pay full freight to keep VanVleet and Jakob Poeltl.\n\nRead more here.\n\n(Photo: Vaughn Ridley / Getty Images)\n\nI’ve never done draft grades before at The Athletic. I think they’re a bit reactive and silly, and they’re a great way to look incredibly stupid a few years down the road when undoubtedly some of my evaluations will be wrong.\n\nBut everyone gets stuff wrong when evaluating players. And ultimately, grades are a great way to talk about how each team handled the NBA Draft and take a bigger-picture look at their roster-building goals and the overall process.\n\nBelow, I’ll break down all 30 teams, explaining what I liked, didn’t like and thought was interesting in regard to how they decided to proceed at the draft. Teams are in letter-grade order, and I tiered them into how I’d evaluate them. I didn’t spend a ton of time parsing through how to order each team within the same grade, so I wouldn’t say I “ranked” them. But I did dive deep into my thought process on the draft and the week leading up to it with any deal that involved picks.\n\nHere are my 2023 NBA Draft grades, and for a deeper look at this year’s group of prospects and how I had them ranked, check out our NBA Draft Guide from mid-June.\n\nRead more here.\n\n(Photo: Fernando Medina / Getty Images)"
