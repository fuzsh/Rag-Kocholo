        "text": "One of my earliest memories of being a fan of the NBA was tuning into the All-Star Weekend to watch some of the local pro guys lock up with some of the best in a series of different tasks the night before the actual All-Star game.\n\nYou might see former King forward Peja Stojaković be absolutely filthy from behind the perimeter, or watch a celebrity join a collective group of basketball players from the past. However, my attention drew differently.\n\nI was ecstatic for the NBA’s Slam Dunk Contest.\n\nI remember, sitting in the room with my brothers and my dad, a ten-year-old kid mesmerized by the physical feats made from former Warrior Jason Richardson or ex-King Gerald Wallace in that final round. I never knew humans can bring that much style and intensity onto a basketball hoop.\n\nFor the next 14 to 16 seasons, the feats being accomplished in this competition never ceased to amaze. Whether it was Blake Griffin dunking over a Kia in 2011 or Dwight Howard putting on the Superman suit and leaping from far distances in 2012, the creativity continued to skyrocket.\n\nWhen did that creativity fizzle out? For me it was the 2016 Slam Dunk Contest.\n\nAt the time, we watched Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon go to war for the crown, and they awed the entire world in their competition. According to a USA TODAY article, in the 15-minute-time frame of the night, it averaged 7 million viewers. It really was a war of attrition.\n\nAfter this insane contest completed with a sudden death, where Lavine won the competition by just three points over Gordon. I feel like that was the last time I turned off the TV and absolutely stunned by the competition. My interest, ultimately dissipated since then.\n\nThis year’s dunk contest just was tough to watch. While I was out covering other events in Solano County, my Twitter feed was blowing up about the dunk contest — and not in a good way.\n\nThere was a multitude of missed dunks, a lack of creativity and ultimately, disappointment. However, a fan of maintaining perspective, one Tweet that stuck out to me came from Houston Rockets Forbes writer Rahat Huq.\n\n“Society has evolved past the need for a dunk contest. It’s just ruining my childhood memories at this point. Get rid of it. Institute a one-on-one tournament. Stars won’t participate, but I’d gladly tune in to watch backup NBA guards go up against one another.”\n\nThough I never would want to see this competition go away, Huq made some valid points.\n\nStars in the league that we know can throw it down choose to remain completely out of the competition. How cool would it be if we at least would of seen once Lebron James compete in this some time in the past near two decades? Or even see Giannis Antetokounmpo land a dunk with that 7-3 wingspan?\n\nThough a hot commodity for younger talent in the league to gather some hardware, established stars often enjoy the festivities or compete in less strenuous parts of the All-Star weekend.\n\nI enjoy dunks where the physicality remains the forefront of the dunk. I enjoyed the moments where players pay homage to players of the past, or even when Warriors forward Juan Toscano-Anderson paid homage to his Mexican heritage with the design on his jersey resembling the Mexican Flag in the font. I really love those elements.\n\nThis competition, however continues to be a water down version of itself from it’s past.\n\nThough I may be critical of it now, I am hopeful that it can pick up again here in the future. I recognize that dunks continue to get surpassed as each year progresses, making it harder for those that do compete.\n\nWhat I am hopeful for is we see more established stars express potential interest in competing and a new age of dunkers brings back the excitement.\n\nI want to feel that same excitement I felt when I saw Richardson first take flight nearly two decades ago."
