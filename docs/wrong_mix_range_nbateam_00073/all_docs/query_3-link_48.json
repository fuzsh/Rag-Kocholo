        "text": "The wait, my NBA friends, is over.\n\nThe Damian Lillard finally came to a close, when he was sent to the Milwaukee Bucks in a three-team deal that will pair him with Giannis Antetokounmpo to form one of the league's most fearsome duos. The Phoenix Suns also jumped into the deal, snagging Jusuf Nurkic, Grayson Allen and a couple more young pieces while parting ways with former No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton after a tumultuous tenure.\n\nNot to be outdone, the Celtics pounced on the jettisoned Jrue Holiday, keeping up with Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference arms race by acquiring their former player. Savage.\n\nThe deals obviously change the landscape of the NBA, and bring to an end the most pressing story of the summer. There is another one, however, that has yet to be resolved.\n\nJames Harden has said plenty about his own trade request -- calling Philadelphia 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey \"a liar\" and saying that he'll never play for an organization that employs him. So that leaves a giant question mark hanging over the offseason of Philadelphia and any team(s) that might be involved in a potential deal.\n\nWith that in mind, we went through all 30 NBA teams to assess who's in and who's out, and then we slapped a grade on their entire offseason, including the draft, trades, free agency and contract extensions. It's not easy to collect all that info, so a massive shout out to both NBA.com and HoopsHype, who keep meticulously detailed lists for us to mine.\n\nHere are offseason grades for every NBA team entering the 2023-24 season.\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nWho's in:\n\nDejounte Murray (contract extension)\n\nKobe Bufkin (drafted No. 15)\n\nWesley Matthews (free agent)\n\nPatty Mills (traded from Thunder)\n\nMouhamed Gueye (drafted No. 39)\n\nSeth Lundy (drafted No. 46)\n\nTrent Forrest (re-signed)\n\nMiles Norris (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nJohn Collins (traded to Jazz)\n\nAaron Holiday (signed with Rockets)\n\nVit Krejci (waived)\n\nDonovan Williams (waived)\n\nHey, the Hawks finally traded John Collins! Unfortunately for Atlanta fans, they were unable to net a significant return after years of more lucrative reported possibilities. C'est la vie. Murray's extension is large (four years, $120 million), but well worth the investment after what he showed last season. Bufkin is an intriguing combo guard who could compete for bench minutes, and Mills is the type of vet the Hawks need to bring some stability (if they decide to keep him). Overall, nothing overwhelming for the Hawks this offseason, but they finally made a decision about Collins and locked up Murray. Solid. Grade: B\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nWho's in:\n\nJrue Holiday (traded from Portland)\n\nJaylen Brown (contract extension)\n\nKristaps Porzingis (traded from Wizards)\n\nWenyen Gabriel (free agent)\n\nJordan Walsh (drafted No. 38)\n\nLamar Stevens (free agent)\n\nDalano Banton (free agent)\n\nOshae Brissett (free agent)\n\nSvi Mykhailiuk (free agent)\n\nNeemias Queta (free agent)\n\nJD Davison (re-signed)\n\nDJ Steward (free agent)\n\nJay Scrubb (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nMarcus Smart (traded to Grizzlies)\n\nGrant Williams (traded to Mavericks)\n\nRobert Williams III (traded to Trail Blazers)\n\nMalcolm Brogdon (traded to Trail Blazers)\n\nDanilo Gallinari (traded to Wizards)\n\nMike Muscala (traded to Wizards)\n\nJustin Champagnie (signed with Heat)\n\nMfiondu Kabengele (signed with AEK Athens)\n\nBoston significantly improved its offseason with the late acquisition of Holiday, a nominal replacement (upgrade?) for Smart. He and Derrick White form one of the most fearsome defensive backcourts in the NBA, and Holiday brings the championship experience the Celtics otherwise lack. Porzingis is an interesting experiment, and he'll be tasked with much more defensive responsibility with the departure of both Williamses. On the other end, his 3-point shooting will bring an intriguing element to Joe Mazzulla's offense. Grade: A-\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\nWho's in:\n\nCameron Johnson (re-signed)\n\nDarius Bazley (free agent)\n\nDennis Smith Jr. (free agent)\n\nLonnie Walker IV (free agent)\n\nTrendon Watford (free agent)\n\nNoah Clowney (drafted No. 21)\n\nDariq Whitehead (drafted No. 22)\n\nJalen Wilson (drafted No. 51)\n\nPatrick Gardner (free agent)\n\nArmoni Brooks (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nSeth Curry (signed with Mavericks)\n\nJoe Harris (traded to Pistons)\n\nDru Smith (signed with Heat)\n\nEdmond Sumner (waived)\n\nYuta Watanabe (signed with Suns)\n\nMoses Brown (signed with Trail Blazers)\n\nWe're not quite sure which direction the Nets are headed, but bringing the sharpshooting Johnson along for the ride was essential. Other than that, the Nets signed a lot of young players and rookies (Clowney and Whitehead) that could work themselves into more prominent roles, but right now most appear to be on the fringes. It will be interesting to watch how Brooklyn operates over the next couple of seasons. Grade: B\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\nWho's in:\n\nLaMelo Ball (contract extension)\n\nMiles Bridges (re-signed)\n\nBrandon Miller (drafted No. 2)\n\nPJ Washington (re-signed)\n\nTheo Maledon (re-signed)\n\nNick Smith Jr. (drafted No. 27)\n\nJames Nnaji (drafted No. 31)\n\nAmari Bailey (drafted No. 41)\n\nFrank Ntilikina (free agent)\n\nEdmond Sumner (free agent)\n\nRJ Hunter (free agent)\n\nTre Scott (free agent)\n\nLeaky Black (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nKelly Oubre Jr. (signed with 76ers)\n\nDennis Smith Jr. (signed with Nets)\n\nSvi Mykhailiuk (signed with Celtics)\n\nXavier Sneed (waived)\n\nKobi Simmons (waived)\n\nMitch Kupchak made a gutsy call by taking Miller over Scoot Henderson -- one of those moves that we could be talking about in 10 years for all the wrong reasons. But they were convinced that Miller's shooting ability and premium position on the wing would be their best bet moving forward alongside the newly extended Ball. We'll see what happens with Bridges, but bringing back Washington was essential for floor spacing. Grade: B\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nWho's in:\n\nNikola Vucevic (contract extension)\n\nJevon Carter (free agent)\n\nTorrey Craig (free agent)\n\nCoby White (re-signed)\n\nAyo Dosunmu (re-signed)\n\nTerry Taylor (re-signed)\n\nJulian Phillips (drafted No. 35)\n\nOnuralp Bitim (free agent)\n\nAdama Sanogo (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nPatrick Beverley (signed with 76ers)\n\nDerrick Jones Jr. (signed with Mavericks)\n\nMarko Simonovic (signed with Crvena Zvedzda)\n\n*Stuck in the middle with you ...* While Carter is a solid signing who will bring defensive toughness and some 3-point shooting, ultimately the Bulls decided to basically run it back with a 40-win roster. There was talk about potentially trading Zach LaVine or DeMar DeRozan, but that hasn't happened. They're fine, but it's just hard to get excited about this team right now. Grade: C\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nWho's in:\n\nMax Strus (sign-and-trade from Heat)\n\nCaris LeVert (re-signed)\n\nGeorges Niang (free agent)\n\nDamian Jones (traded from Jazz)\n\nTy Jerome (free agent)\n\nEmoni Bates (drafted No. 49)\n\nTristan Thompson (free agent)\n\nIsaiah Mobley (re-signed)\n\nCraig Porter (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nRobin Lopez (signed with Bucks)\n\nCedi Osman (traded to Spurs)\n\nLamar Stevens (traded to Spurs)\n\nDylan Windler (signed with Knicks)\n\nThe Cavs desperately needed a consistent shooter to fill the wing around their young core, and Strus certainly fits the bill. They also added even more shooting, and some attitude, with Niang coming over from Philly. Cleveland hopes that the reinforcements will help put that ugly playoff loss behind them. Grade: A\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nWho's in:\n\nKyrie Irving (re-signed)\n\nGrant Williams (sign-and-trade from Celtics)\n\nSeth Curry (free agent)\n\nDereck Lively II (drafted No. 12)\n\nOlivier-Maxence Prosper (drafted No. 24)\n\nDwight Powell (re-signed)\n\nMarkieff Morris (re-signed)\n\nDante Exum (free agent)\n\nDerrick Jones Jr. (free agent)\n\nRichaun Holmes (traded from Kings)\n\nGreg Brown (free agent)\n\nJoe Wieskamp (free agent)\n\nJordan Walker (free agent)\n\nMike Miles (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nChristian Wood (signed with Lakers)\n\nReggie Bullock (traded to Spurs)\n\nJaVale McGee (signed with Kings)\n\nDavis Bertans (traded to Thunder)\n\nJustin Holiday (signed with Nuggets)\n\nFrank Ntilikina (signed with Hornets)\n\nMcKinley Wright (signed with Buducnost)\n\nHitching your wagon to Irving is a dangerous practice, but the Mavs didn't have many other options. You can argue about the three-year, $120 million figure (with a player option) and say that the Mavs were bidding against themselves -- which they might have been -- but this is just the way it works with players of Irving's caliber, regardless of his past. Outside of Irving, the Mavs had an impressive offseason, adding shooting with Curry, defensive versatility with Williams and considerable upside with rookies Lively and Prosper. It seems that Luka Doncic has some solid pieces around him for Dallas to make a leap this season. Grade: A-\n\nDenver Nuggets\n\nWho's in:\n\nJustin Holiday (free agent)\n\nReggie Jackson (re-signed)\n\nDeAndre Jordan (re-signed)\n\nCollin Gillespie (re-signed)\n\nJulian Strawther (drafted No. 29)\n\nJalen Pickett (drafted No. 32)\n\nHunter Tyson (drafted No. 37)\n\nJay Huff (free agent)\n\nSouley Boum (free agent)\n\nArmaan Franklin (free agent)\n\nAndrew Funk (free agent)\n\nBraxton Key (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nBruce Brown (signed with Pacers)\n\nThomas Bryant (signed with Heat)\n\nJeff Green (signed with Rockets)\n\nJack White (signed with Thunder)\n\nSuch is life when you're at the top. The champions lost two of their eight rotation players from last season, leaving them with hopes that youngsters like Christian Braun and Peyton Watson can step into consistent roles. Holiday is a sneaky addition, who should vie for a spot in Malone's tight rotation right away, but the signing of Jackson -- who played a total of 18 postseason minutes -- to the full taxpayer mid-level was a true head-scratcher. Ultimately the loss of Brown hurts tremendously, but Denver simply couldn't afford to keep him. Grade: C+\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nWho's in:\n\nAusar Thompson (drafted No. 5)\n\nJoe Harris (traded from Nets)\n\nMonte Morris (traded from Wizards)\n\nMarcus Sasser (drafted No. 25)\n\nBuddy Boeheim (re-signed)\n\nJared Rhoden (re-signed)\n\nZavier Simpson (free agent)\n\nStanley Umude (free agent)\n\nTosan Evbuomwan (free agent)\n\nMalcolm Cazalon (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nCory Joseph (signed with Warriors)\n\nEugene Omoruyi (signed with Wizards)\n\nAusar Thompson may not have been as ballyhooed as his brother, Amen, but his explosive athleticism should fit nicely on the wing next to Cade Cunningham and Jaden Ivey. Detroit also added another shooter in Harris and a rock-solid point guard in Morris. That said, the biggest addition to the Pistons is the return of Cunningham, who will be eager to show his talent after missing essentially the entire 2022-23 season. Grade: A-\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nWho's in:\n\nChris Paul (trade from Wizards)\n\nDraymond Green (re-signed)\n\nCory Joseph (free agent)\n\nDario Saric (free agent)\n\nBrandin Podziemski (drafted No. 19)\n\nTrayce Jackson-Davis (drafted No. 57)\n\nRudy Gay (free agent)\n\nRodney McGruder (free agent)\n\nLester Quiñones (re-signed)\n\nUsman Garuba (free agent)\n\nJayce Johnson (free agent)\n\nJerome Robinson (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nJordan Poole (traded to Wizards)\n\nDonte DiVincenzo (signed with Knicks)\n\nPatrick Baldwin Jr. (traded to Wizards)\n\nTy Jerome (signed with Cavaliers)\n\nRyan Rollins (traded to Wizards)\n\nThe Chris Paul trade caught everyone off guard, and it's still unclear what role he will play. What was clear, however, is that new Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavey Jr. wanted out of the Jordan Poole business, and bringing in Paul -- on paper -- seems like an excellent swap. Losing DiVincenzo hurts, but they simply couldn't afford to pay him what he commanded, and Joseph is the type of reliable veteran that Steve Kerr loves. Poole's postseason was cringeworthy, to say the least, but during the regular season he averaged 20 points and played all 82 games. Even the most optimistic prognosticators can't possibly see Paul matching that, so where does that production come from? That's the question we're waiting to see answered. Grade: B\n\nHouston Rockets\n\nWho's in:\n\nAmen Thompson (drafted No. 4)\n\nFred VanVleet (free agent)\n\nDillon Brooks (sign-and-trade from Grizzlies)\n\nCam Whitmore (drafted No. 20)\n\nJeff Green (free agent)\n\nAaron Holiday (free agent)\n\nJock Landale (free agent)\n\nBoban Marjanovic (re-signed)\n\nDarius Days (re-signed)\n\nTrevor Hudgins (re-signed)\n\nNate Hinton (free agent)\n\nJeenathan Williams (free agent)\n\nMatthew Mayer (free agent)\n\nJoshua Obiesie (free agent)\n\nJermaine Samuels (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nJosh Christopher (traded to Grizzlies)\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. (traded to Clippers)\n\nDaishen Nix (waived)\n\nWillie Cauley-Stein (signed with Varese)\n\nFrank Kaminsky (signed with Partizan)\n\nUsman Garuba (traded to Hawks)\n\nTyTy Washington (traded to Hawks)\n\nNew coach. New point guard. New attitude (we're looking at you, Dillon).\n\nHoping to be a doormat no more, the Rockets brought in a no-nonsense leader in Ime Udoka and gritty players like VanVleet and Brooks to lead a veritable cornucopia of young, electrifying talent. Houston reportedly went hard at Brook Lopez, who would have provided a much-needed defensive anchor in the middle, but the Rockets still made huge strides this offseason while bringing in potential future stars in Thompson and Whitmore. The Kevin Porter Jr. situation must be navigated seriously and carefully, but Houston has enough talent to make a leap even if the two sides end up parting ways. Grade: A-\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nWho's in:\n\nTyrese Haliburton (contract extension)\n\nBruce Brown (free agent)\n\nObi Toppin (traded from Knicks)\n\nJarace Walker (drafted No. 8)\n\nBen Sheppard (drafted No. 26)\n\nMojave King (drafted No. 47) -- will play overseas\n\nIsaiah Wong (drafted No. 55)\n\nKendall Brown (re-signed)\n\nOscar Tshiebwe (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nChris Duarte (traded to Kings)\n\nOshae Brissett (signed with Celtics)\n\nThe Pacers opened the checkbook (Venmo account?) for Brown, adding a secondary playmaker and defensive Swiss Army knife to a team that desperately needed both. Locking up Haliburton was the easiest decision Kevin Pritchard ever made, and bringing in Toppin to run and fly alongside Haliburton is the stuff goosebumps are made of. Walker was excellent in Summer League, showcasing adept playmaking skills to go along with his tremendous defensive upside. Love it all. Grade: A\n\nLA Clippers\n\nWho's in:\n\nRussell Westbrook (re-signed)\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. (traded from Rockets)\n\nMason Plumlee (re-signed)\n\nKobe Brown (drafted No. 30)\n\nJordan Miller (drafted No. 48)\n\nJosh Primo (free agent)\n\nMoussa Diabate (re-signed)\n\nWho's out:\n\nEric Gordon (waived)\n\nWestbrook earned another shot with the Clippers during an excellent playoff run, but that was their only significant move this offseason. They've been linked to James Harden as the only team he wants to play for, though you'd have to think a deal already would have been made if they were truly keen on bringing him aboard. Waiving Gordon was curious, given that they surrendered Luke Kennard and the No. 20 pick in the draft (they swapped to No. 30 and took Brown) to bring him aboard. Martin showed some flashes in Houston and will add some much-needed athleticism, but the path to minutes isn't obvious. It looks like the Clippers are going to run it back, once again crossing their fingers that Kawhi Leonard and Paul George can make it through the postseason intact. Grade: C\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nWho's in:\n\nAnthony Davis (contract extension)\n\nAustin Reaves (re-signed)\n\nD'Angelo Russell (re-signed)\n\nRui Hachimura (re-signed)\n\nGabe Vincent (free agent)\n\nJarred Vanderbilt (contract extension)\n\nChristian Wood (free agent)\n\nTaurean Prince (free agent)\n\nJaxson Hayes (free agent)\n\nCam Reddish (free agent)\n\nJalen Hood-Schifino (drafted No. 17)\n\nMaxwell Lewis (drafted No. 40)\n\nColin Castleton (free agent)\n\nAlex Fudge (free agent)\n\nD'Moi Hodge (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nDennis Schroder (signed with Raptors)\n\nLonnie Walker IV (signed with Nets)\n\nMalik Beasley (signed with Bucks)\n\nTroy Brown Jr. (signed with Timberwolves)\n\nMo Bamba (waived)\n\nWenyen Gabriel (signed with Celtics)\n\nCole Swider (signed with Heat)\n\nShaquille Harrison (waived)\n\nThe Lakers hope that whatever was clicking so well for them toward the end of last season and into the playoffs will continue, as they've brought back pretty much the entire rotation. Getting Reaves for four years, $56 million is borderline criminal, especially considering a cap space team could have presented him with a $100 million offer sheet. Vincent is a strong addition and a Darvin Ham-style player, while Hood-Schifino could work his way into playing time if and when injuries hit. Overall, a strong offseason for the Lakers, who had limited maneuverability and still have the potential to make in-season deals to bolster their championship chances. Grade: A\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\nWho's in:\n\nDesmond Bane (contract extension)\n\nMarcus Smart (traded from Celtics)\n\nDerrick Rose (free agent)\n\nJosh Christopher (traded from Rockets)\n\nIsaiah Todd (traded from Suns)\n\nGregory Jackson II (drafted No. 45)\n\nTarik Biberovic (drafted No. 56) -- will play overseas\n\nWho's out:\n\nDillon Brooks (sign-and-trade to Rockets)\n\nTyus Jones (traded to Wizards)\n\nIt was clear that Brooks wasn't coming back, and bringing in Smart to replace him is a huge win. Extending Bane was a given, but losing super-sub Jones is significant, particularly with Ja Morant being suspended for the first 25 games of the season. Grade: B\n\nMiami Heat\n\nWho's in:\n\nKevin Love (re-signed)\n\nJaime Jaquez Jr. (drafted No. 18)\n\nJosh Richardson (free agent)\n\nThomas Bryant (free agent)\n\nOrlando Robinson (re-signed)\n\nJamal Cain (re-signed)\n\nJustin Champagnie (free agent)\n\nCole Swider (free agent)\n\nAlondes Williams (free agent)\n\nDrew Peterson (free agent)\n\nDru Smith (free agent)\n\nR.J. Hampton (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nMax Strus (sign-and-trade to Cavaliers)\n\nGabe Vincent (signed with Lakers)\n\nUdonis Haslem (retired)\n\nVictor Oladipo (traded to Thunder)\n\nCody Zeller (signed with Pelicans)\n\nOmer Yurtseven (signed with Jazz)\n\nJamaree Bouyea (waived)\n\nWell, it looks like the Heat are out of options ... at least for now. They missed out on Damian Lillard and Jrue Holiday, and they lost two playoff starters in Strus and Vincent. Not ideal, especially considering Lillard and Holiday both went to conference rivals. A lot of people are excited about Jaquez, but rookies don't have a great track record of impacting winning, particularly in Miami. It seems like the Heat got markedly worse this offseason, so we'll just have to wait for Pat Riley, Erik Spoelstra and Jimmy Butler to prove us wrong once again. Grade: C-\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\nWho's in:\n\nDamian Lillard (traded from Trail Blazers)\n\nKhris Middleton (re-signed)\n\nBrook Lopez (re-signed)\n\nJae Crowder (re-signed)\n\nRobin Lopez (free agent)\n\nCameron Payne (free agent)\n\nThanasis Antetokounmpo (re-signed)\n\nAJ Green (re-signed)\n\nMalik Beasley (free agent)\n\nAndre Jackson Jr. (drafted No. 36)\n\nChris Livingston (drafted No. 58)\n\nTyTy Washington (free agent)\n\nJazian Gortman (free agent)\n\nOmari Moore (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nJrue Holiday (traded to Trail Blazers)\n\nGrayson Allen (traded to Suns)\n\nJevon Carter (signed with Bulls)\n\nJoe Ingles (signed with Magic)\n\nWesley Matthews (signed with Hawks)\n\nThe Bucks already had a solid offseason grade for bringing back Middleton and Lopez, the latter of which was pursued relentlessly by the Rockets. But now, with the addition of Lillard, this an absolute grand slam for Milwaukee. If you could design a perfect offensive complement to Giannis Antetokounmpo, it would be Lillard -- one of the best 3-point shooters in NBA history with limitless range and playmaking skills to boot. There will be defensive questions with Holiday's departure, but Lopez will do a lot to hide those flaws while new head coach Adrian Griffin figures things out. The Bucks became the clear Eastern Conference favorites this offseason. Grade: A+\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nWho's in:\n\nAnthony Edwards (contract extension)\n\nNaz Reid (contract extension)\n\nNickeil Alexander-Walker (re-signed)\n\nShake Milton (free agent)\n\nTroy Brown Jr. (free agent)\n\nLeonard Miller (drafted No. 33)\n\nJaylen Clark (drafted No. 53)\n\nLuka Garza (re-signed)\n\nMatt Ryan (re-signed)\n\nTyrese Martin (free agent)\n\nDaishen Nix (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nTaurean Prince (waived)\n\nNathan Knight (signed with Knicks)\n\nThe No. 1 priority this offseason was locking up Edwards, who was a no-brainer for the full rookie max extension that could be worth up to $260 million. Getting Reid back was a big win, as the backup center reportedly had many suitors, but Minnesota didn't really bring in any significant talent to help push them up the Western Conference standings. Grade: B-\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n\nWho's in:\n\nJordan Hawkins (drafted No. 14)\n\nHerbert Jones (re-signed)\n\nCody Zeller (free agent)\n\nKaiser Gates (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nJaxson Hayes (signed with Lakers)\n\nJosh Richardson (signed with Heat)\n\nGarrett Temple (waived)\n\nWilly Hernangomez (signed with FC Barcelona)\n\nNot much activity for the Pels this offseason, but Hawkins is a knock-down shooter who should play well off of their talented scorers. Also, getting Jones on a four-year, $54 million deal could look like an absolute steal if the All-Defense candidate continues to grow offensively. Grade: A-\n\nNew York Knicks\n\nWho's in:\n\nDonte DiVincenzo (free agent)\n\nJosh Hart (contract extension)\n\nDuane Washington Jr. (re-signed)\n\nNathan Knight (free agent)\n\nDylan Windler (free agent)\n\nJacob Toppin (free agent)\n\nJaylen Martin (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nObi Toppin (traded to Pacers)\n\nDerrick Rose (signed with Grizzlies)\n\nWildcats, assemble! With Jalen Brunson already anchoring the Knicks, the Villanova reunion continued with the extension of Hart and the addition of DiVincenzo -- both hard-nosed, smart, winning players. Outside of those two, the only other semi-major move was sending Toppin to the Pacers. You hate to see the talent go out the door, but he clearly wasn't finding his way into significant playing time under Tom Thibodeau. Grade: B\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nWho's in:\n\nCason Wallace (drafted No. 10)\n\nKeyontae Johnson (drafted No. 50)\n\nDavis Bertans (traded from Mavericks)\n\nVictor Oladipo (traded from Heat)\n\nOlivier Sarr (re-signed)\n\nLindy Waters III (re-signed)\n\nVasilije Micic (free agent)\n\nJack White (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nJared Butler (signed with Wizards)\n\nDario Saric (signed with Warriors)\n\nOKC traded up to get its man, Wallace, at No. 10, and he'll join one of the league's most exciting young rosters led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Josh Giddey, Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren. Sam Presti didn't add much more talent, but he continues to serve as a dumping ground for unwanted contracts, picking up asset after asset for his troubles. Grade: A-\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nWho's in:\n\nAnthony Black (drafted No. 6)\n\nJett Howard (drafted No. 11)\n\nMoritz Wagner (re-signed)\n\nJoe Ingles (free agent)\n\nMac McClung (free agent)\n\nAdmiral Schofield (re-signed)\n\nMiye Oni (free agent)\n\nTrevelin Queen (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nBol Bol (waived)\n\nYou would have like to have seen the Magic pickup an elite shooter at No. 6 in the draft, but Black fits their mold of long, versatile playmakers. They then elected to go for shooting at No. 11, with Howard being considered a bit of a reach by most analysts. Either way, Orlando is poised to continued its upward ascent, and a veteran like Ingles is exactly what they need as they continue to learn and grow. Grade: B+\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nWho's in:\n\nKelly Oubre Jr. (free agent)\n\nPatrick Beverley (free agent)\n\nPaul Reed (re-signed)\n\nMontrezl Harrell (re-signed)\n\nMo Bamba (free agent)\n\nDanny Green (free agent)\n\nJavonte Smart (free agent)\n\nFilip Petrusev (free agent)\n\nRicky Council (free agent)\n\nTerquavion Smith (free agent)\n\nAzuolas Tubelis (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nJalen McDaniels (signed with Raptors)\n\nShake Milton (signed with Timberwolves)\n\nGeorges Niang (signed with Cavaliers)\n\nMac McClung (signed with Magic)\n\nQuiet, peaceful summer for the 76ers, as usual. The grade obviously can't truly be fleshed out until we see what happens with James Harden, but so far Philly hasn't made any moves that significantly improve the team, and the loss of Niang and Milton could hurt more than casual fans might think. They added no shooting outside of the aging Green, plus three backup centers (one of which -- Harrell -- has a torn ACL and meniscus), so let's hope they have something cooking with Harden -- or else they could be in big trouble. Grade: Incomplete\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nWho's in:\n\nBradley Beal (traded from Wizards)\n\nJusuf Nurkic (traded from Trail Blazers)\n\nGrayson Allen (traded from Bucks)\n\nNassir Little (traded from Trail Blazers)\n\nKeon Johnson (traded from Trail Blazers)\n\nJosh Okogie (re-signed)\n\nDamion Lee (re-signed)\n\nSaben Lee (re-signed)\n\nEric Gordon (free agent)\n\nYuta Watanabe (free agent)\n\nDrew Eubanks (free agent)\n\nKeita Bates-Diop (free agent)\n\nChimeze Metu (free agent)\n\nBol Bol (free agent)\n\nUdoka Azubuike (free agent)\n\nJordan Goodwin (traded from Wizards)\n\nWho's out:\n\nChris Paul (traded to Wizards)\n\nDeandre Ayton (traded to Trail Blazers)\n\nCameron Payne (traded to Spurs)\n\nLandry Shamet (traded to Wizards)\n\nTorrey Craig (signed with Bulls)\n\nDarius Bazley (signed with Nets)\n\nJock Landale (signed with Rockets)\n\nToumani Camara (traded to Trail Blazers)\n\nThere are big swings, and then there's Mat Ishbia. The Suns saw that Kevin Durant and Devin Booker plus a bunch of minimum contracts couldn't get it done in the playoffs, so how about Durant, Booker and Beal? In order to add some established starter-quality talent, the Suns ended their tumultuous relationship with Ayton, receiving Nurkic and Allen in return, plus a couple of intriguing young players in Little and Johnson. Something clearly wasn't working last season, and the reload looks promising on paper. Grade: B+\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n\nWho's in:\n\nScoot Henderson (drafted No. 3)\n\nDeandre Ayton (traded from Suns)\n\nRobert Williams III (traded from Celtics)\n\nMalcolm Brogdon (traded from Celtics)\n\nJerami Grant (re-signed)\n\nMatisse Thybulle (re-signed)\n\nKris Murray (drafted No. 23)\n\nRayan Rupert (drafted No. 43)\n\nSkylar Mays (re-signed)\n\nMoses Brown (free agent)\n\nJohn Butler Jr. (re-signed)\n\nIbou Badji (re-signed)\n\nAshton Hagans (free agent)\n\nToumani Camara (traded from Suns)\n\nWho's out:\n\nDamian Lillard (traded to Bucks)\n\nNassir Little (traded to Suns)\n\nKeon Johnson (traded to Suns)\n\nDrew Eubanks (singed with Suns)\n\nCam Reddish (signed with Lakers)\n\nTrendon Watford (waived)\n\nJeenathan Williams (waived)\n\nThe people of Portland can finally exhale, knowing that the rebuild has officially begun with Lillard now in Milwaukee and young building blocks Henderson, Ayton, Anfernee Simons and Shaedon Sharpe in tow. Joe Cronin worked further magic by flipping Jrue Holiday for another potential cornerstone in Williams and a veteran guard in Brogdon who can either be kept or traded for more assets. For the overall haul Cronin was able to swing given the lack of leverage he had in the Lillard situation, Portland certainly earned its offseason mark. They might also be better than you think this season. Grade: A\n\nSacramento Kings\n\nWho's in:\n\nDomantas Sabonis (contract extension)\n\nChris Duarte (traded from Pacers)\n\nSasha Vezenkov (free agent)\n\nJaVale McGee (free agent)\n\nTrey Lyles (re-signed)\n\nAlex Len (re-signed)\n\nKeon Ellis (re-signed)\n\nColby Jones (drafted No. 34)\n\nJalen Slawson (drafted No. 54)\n\nJordan Ford (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nPJ Dozier (waived)\n\nChimeze Metu (signed with Suns)\n\nRichaun Holmes (traded to Mavericks)\n\nMatthew Delavedova (signed with Melbourne United)\n\nNeemias Queta (signed with Celtics)\n\nThe Kings didn't want to mess with a good thing, and you can't really blame them. Sabonis' number ($217 million over five seasons) may look a bit large, but that's the price of doing business if you want to contend. Duarte is a sneaky pickup, another movement shooter in the mold of a Kevin Huerter Lite, and EuroLeague MVP Vezenkov -- another sharpshooter -- has been billed as a potential quality rotation player. But largely, Sacramento chose to get their young, up-and-coming band back together. Grade: B+\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nWho's in:\n\nVictor Wembanyama (drafted No. 1)\n\nTre Jones (re-signed)\n\nSidy Cissoko (drafted No. 44)\n\nCedi Osman (traded from Cavaliers)\n\nJulian Champagnie (re-signed)\n\nSandro Mamukelashvili (re-signed)\n\nSetric Millner Jr. (free agent)\n\nDominick Barlow (re-signed)\n\nSir'Jabari Rice (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nKeita Bates-Diop (signed with Suns)\n\nWhen the best NBA prospect since LeBron James walks through your doors, you've won the offseason. The Spurs front office also deserves credit for displaying noble restraint, electing to slow-play Wembanyama's development rather than rushing to use cap space to try to contend right away. They'll continue to be a dumping ground for unwanted contracts as they collect assets and wait for the right time to strike. Grade: A+\n\nToronto Raptors\n\nWho's in:\n\nJakob Poeltl (re-signed)\n\nGradey Dick (drafted No. 13)\n\nDennis Schroder (free agent)\n\nJalen McDaniels (free agent)\n\nGarrett Temple (free agent)\n\nMouhamadou Gueye (free agent)\n\nKevin Obanor (free agent)\n\nJavon Freeman-Liberty (free agent)\n\nMarquis Nowell (free agent)\n\nJeff Dowtin Jr. (re-signed)\n\nRon Harper Jr. (re-signed)\n\nWho's out:\n\nFred VanVleet (signed with Rockets)\n\nDalano Banton (signed with Celtics)\n\nJoe Wieskamp (signed with Mavericks)\n\nThe Raptors continued their infamous trend of losing star players for nothing, as they watched VanVleet jet off to Houston and dished out $26 million over two years to Schroder as a stopgap replacement. Dick will hopefully provide some necessary shooting, but outside of that Toronto has been left in limbo with a mediocre team and two players (Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby) whose clocks are ticking to potentially be the next stars who eventually walk without compensation. Grade: C\n\nUtah Jazz\n\nWho's in:\n\nJohn Collins (traded from Hawks)\n\nJordan Clarkson (contract extension)\n\nTaylor Hendricks (drafted No. 9)\n\nKeyonte George (drafted No. 16)\n\nBrice Sensabaugh (drafted No. 28)\n\nOmer Yurtseven (free agent)\n\nJohnny Juzang (re-signed)\n\nJoey Hauser (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nRudy Gay (traded to Hawks)\n\nDamian Jones (traded to Cavaliers)\n\nUdoka Azubuike (signed with Suns)\n\nVernon Carey Jr. (waived)\n\nAfter an unexpectedly successful 2022-23 campaign, the Jazz continued to load their coffers with valuable assets, acquiring Collins for practically nothing and making wise selections with their three first-round picks (Hendricks, George and Sensabaugh). While he hasn't acquired a game-changing talent this offseason (yet?), Danny Ainge has still worked wonders in his short stint at Utah's helm. Grade: A-\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nWho's in:\n\nKyle Kuzma (re-signed)\n\nJordan Poole (traded from Warriors)\n\nBilal Coulibaly (drafted No. 7)\n\nTyus Jones (traded from Grizzlies)\n\nLandry Shamet (traded from Suns)\n\nMike Muscala (traded from Celtics)\n\nDanilo Gallinari (traded from Celtics)\n\nPatrick Baldwin Jr. (traded from Warriors)\n\nRyan Rollins (traded from Warriors)\n\nTaj Gibson (re-signed)\n\nTristan Vukcevic (drafted No. 42)\n\nJared Butler (free agent)\n\nEugene Omoruyi (free agent)\n\nDejan Vasiljevic (free agent)\n\nWho's out:\n\nBradley Beal (traded to Suns)\n\nKristaps Porzingis (traded to Celtics)\n\nMonte Morris (traded to Pistons)\n\nJordan Goodwin (traded to Suns)\n\nJay Huff (signed with Nuggets)\n\nIsaiah Todd (traded to Suns)"
