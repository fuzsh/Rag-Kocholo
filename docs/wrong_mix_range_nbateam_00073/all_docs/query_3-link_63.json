        "text": "We’re now just days away from one of the most highly anticipated drafts in recent memory, as French sensation Victor Wembanyama is all but certainly headed to San Antonio. But what happens after the generational talent is picked? There’s major debate at No. 2 with Charlotte needing to decide between G League Ignite guard Scoot Henderson and Alabama wing Brandon Miller. The Overtime Elite twins — Amen and Ausar Thompson — are among the most polarizing prospects in the class and also could move up boards in the final hours.\n\nThe Athletic’s NBA writers got together and made selections for the entire first round, with no trades allowed. Here’s how it all transpired. (Note: Ages listed are as of draft night; heights listed are without shoes, as measured at NBA Draft Combine and elsewhere.)\n\n1. San Antonio Spurs\n\nVictor Wembanyama | 7-4 center | 19 years old | Metropolitans 92\n\nThe easiest No. 1 pick in a generation. There are NBA Draft prospects, and there is Wembanyama. By now everything that could possibly be said about him probably already has been said. It seems that, despite his size, there is nothing that he can’t do. He’ll enter the NBA with as much hype and expectation as any teenager since LeBron James. The Spurs can build around him, and if he is as good as he is projected to be, then it might not be long until they have an All-Star in their midst. — Mike Vorkunov\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nSan Antonio Spurs landed their centerpiece. How will Victor Wembanyama fit?\n\n2. Charlotte Hornets\n\nBrandon Miller | 6-8 wing | 20 years old | Alabama\n\nIf Charlotte makes this pick, and I am not sold (at all) that it will, I am not buying Scoot here. The Hornets have a great point guard. They need a reliable wing, and Gordon Hayward has not been that. Charlotte is a prime candidate to trade out of No. 2, but in the event the Hornets don’t, this is a case where need/fit trumps best player available. — Joe Vardon\n\n3. Portland Trail Blazers\n\nScoot Henderson | 6-2 lead guard | 19 years old | G League Ignite\n\nFollowing a series of backflips and high fives after seeing Charlotte pass on Henderson, the Blazers jump to draft the dynamic guard. Even with a talented stable of guards, and likely some tempting trade proposals, the Blazers elect to keep a talent that most years would be a no-brainer top overall pick. All the questions about where and how Henderson fits, and what it means for Damian Lillard’s timeline, can be addressed later. For now, the Blazers will celebrate landing a talent who makes other teams envious. — Jason Quick\n\n4. Houston Rockets\n\nAmen Thompson | 6-6 lead guard | 20 years old | Overtime Elite\n\nThe “Cam Whitmore has entered the chat” angle is legitimate, and heading into Thursday, the Rockets’ draft prep throng will continue to deliberate. But once the dust settles, Thompson should have his name called here. We can talk about his shooting struggles until we’re blue in the face — he’ll be locked in a room with assistant Ben Sullivan and won’t emerge until his mechanics are smoothed out. But explosive guards at this size with quality playmaking and defensive versatility don’t come around that often. Thompson will fit like a glove with Jalen Green and Jabari Smith Jr., and new coach Ime Udoka will love his intensity and demeanor. Make the pick and pivot toward free agency for the real team deficiencies. — Kelly Iko\n\n5. Detroit Pistons\n\nAusar Thompson | 6-6 wing | 20 years old | Overtime Elite\n\nThompson is the name that has made it to my airwaves most in the days leading up to draft week — and that could mean everything or nothing. Thompson has fans in the Pistons’ front office, and he does fill a void on the current roster as an athletic wing. He’s electric in transition and defends at a high level. Like his brother, Ausar processes the game well and has real secondary or tertiary playmaking upside. Defensively, given his length, athleticism and compete level is where the biggest upside lies with Thompson.\n\nThe jump shot has a ways to go, I have questions about how his game will translate right away in a half-court setting — his knack for cutting is impressive, though — and projecting Overtime Elite prospects, particularly ones on the older side, like Amen and Ausar are, isn’t easy. However, Thompson has a lot of qualities coveted by Pistons general manager Troy Weaver, and the idea of what Thompson might look like if everything clicks could be too much to pass up for a franchise trying to “restore” through the draft. — James Edwards III\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nZach Harper's NBA Mock Draft: Picks, biggest needs, trade expectations\n\n6. Orlando Magic\n\nCam Whitmore | 6-6 wing | 18 years old | Villanova\n\nFor a team on the Magic’s trajectory — on the rise, coming off a 35-win season, flush with at least two long-term foundational players in Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner — the goal still should be to find the best player available, not draft for positional need. But if the best player available also happens to play a position of need, then that’s the ideal situation. And in this scenario, Whitmore is the best player available, ranked third on our draft guru Sam Vecenie’s final big board. He also happens to be someone the Magic could pair with Wagner on the wing.\n\nDrafting Whitmore is an upside play, someone who can be projected as a future All-NBA player. The biggest knock on Whitmore is that he’s a ball-stopper on offense. OK, that’s one of the reasons coaches exist. In this case, I think the Magic front office would bet on Jamahl Mosley and Mosley’s coaching staff to teach Whitmore how to play within a team concept and hold him accountable to that standard. — Josh Robbins\n\n7. Indiana Pacers\n\nTaylor Hendricks | 6-8 forward | 19 years old | UCF\n\nThe Pacers have three first-round picks, and my guess is they won’t use all of them. But with No. 7, there is a rare instance of high-level talent who happens to fit a need. Hendricks would be a fantastic addition to a defense that was 26th overall last season. An excellent shot blocker, Hendricks plays with little fear defending around the basket and not only challenges dunkers, but often blocks them. While his offensive game doesn’t jump off the film quite the same as his defense, he is an excellent catch-and-shoot 3-point shooter and can finish a lob. Anything more than straight-line drives could be a challenge initially, but one can envision an immediate role for Hendricks in Indy. — Dave DuFour\n\n8. Washington Wizards\n\nAnthony Black | 6-6 guard/wing | 19 years old | Arkansas\n\nI think the Wizards would be ecstatic if Black is available here. He has an off-the-charts feel for the game and elite positional size for a point guard, which also happens to be a long-term position of need for Washington. He’s a superb defender at the point of attack. It’s true that his jumper needs work. But if he makes improvements in that area, selecting him here could be remembered as a great pick. — Robbins\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nHow will the Washington Wizards will approach the 2023 NBA Draft?\n\n9. Utah Jazz\n\nJarace Walker | 6-7 forward | 19 years old | Houston\n\nIn some ways, Utah’s job is pretty easy. There are nine players in this draft who have relatively separated themselves. As the team with the No. 9 pick, the Jazz can simply just take the one who’s available. And since they don’t have fit issues with this roster, position won’t be a problem. Walker reminds some of a young Paul Millsap, with his defensive versatility, ability to protect the rim and play on the perimeter, as well as his offensive versatility. But he has upside for even more than a Millsap if he hits his best-case ceiling. Either way, he and Walker Kessler could create a monster defensive frontcourt in time, and pairing that with Lauri Markkanen could make them one of the better overall frontcourts in the league in a few years. — Tony Jones\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nVecenie's NBA Mock Draft: Wembanyama No. 1 (obviously), but questions begin after that\n\n10. Dallas Mavericks\n\nJalen Hood-Schifino | 6-4 wing | 20 years old | Indiana\n\nEvery mock draft is finding it difficult to predict Dallas’ pick, because it’s probably not going to be Dallas picking. The Mavericks are known to be most interested in trading No. 10 for a ready-now veteran. If Hendricks, Black or Walker falls, I believe Dallas shouldn’t overthink this and take one of them. But Hood-Schifino is a ready-now prospect — at least readier than most players available — who fills roster needs even if No. 10 is awfully high to take him. If Dallas trades down, he might also be a target at, say, No. 15. — Tim Cato\n\n11. Orlando Magic\n\nBilal Coulibaly | 6-6 wing | 18 years old | Metropolitans 92\n\nSelecting Coulibaly is not the safe pick here. Choosing Kansas’ Gradey Dick would be the safe pick since Dick would give Orlando a floor spacer the team needs. Drafting Coulibaly would be an upside play; he’s a risk since he’s a raw player who might fizzle out. But the potential rewards of drafting Coulibaly are significant. The Magic have hit — and hit pretty darn big — on their two most recent first-round picks in Banchero and Wagner. (Yes, I know Wagner and Jalen Suggs were chosen in the same draft, but Wagner was selected later in the first round than Suggs was.) In this mock draft, the Magic have chosen Whitmore, and I think they can afford to take another big swing and attempt to develop Coulibaly slowly. Orlando still needs more floor spacing, but floor spacers can be found in free agency or trades. — Robbins\n\n12. Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nKobe Bufkin | 6-4 guard | 19 years old | Michigan\n\nThe Thunder are looking for high upside swings and players with feel on the offensive end. Black, Walker and Coulibaly are off the board, so snagging Bufkin makes sense. The main thing with Bufkin is he doesn’t take much off the table. He is a good shooter, passer and ballhandler. He also is a good defender for his size. Bufkin is surely slotted into a bench role right away for the Thunder behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey, but Bufkin provides a steady presence off the bench that could pay dividends down the line. He is a dynamic scorer who shot 35 percent from 3 and shot 71.1 percent at the rim last season. He will need some time to fill out his thin frame, but the Thunder have time on their side. Adding a capable shooter who also has feel with the ball in his hands fits what the Thunder need. — Andrew Schlecht\n\n13. Toronto Raptors\n\nCason Wallace | 6-3 guard | 19 years old | Kentucky\n\nI’m prepared to be very wrong about this, but I’ve come down to the Raptors having four guys who make the most sense for them at this spot: Hood-Schifino, Bufkin, Dick and Wallace. There are cases for all of them, but in this scenario, I’m going with a guy who scratches two itches at once: perimeter defense and stand-still shooting. No, he won’t provide the gravity with his shot like Dick would, but he is capable and can get better with time. Meanwhile, he provides some of the best on-ball defense from guards in this class, and new coach Darko Rajaković mentioned protecting the paint as a defensive priority in his introductory news conference last week. Add in some secondary playmaking skills, and Wallace gets the slight edge. — Eric Koreen\n\n14. New Orleans Pelicans\n\nGradey Dick | 6-6 wing | 19 years old | Kansas\n\nI must admit I’m somewhat surprised Dick made it this far. This would be a huge win for the Pels if he’s still on the board at No. 14. The former Kansas star provides two of this team’s biggest needs going into the offseason: size on the perimeter and outside shooting. There’s an argument to be made that he’s the best shooter in this draft at any position. But adding a wing who is nearly 6-8 in shoes and can knock down shots the way Dick can would add some positional flexibility the Pels have been lacking since Willie Green became head coach. It’s also important to add someone who can flourish off the ball with Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram and CJ McCollum leading the way on offense. Dick checks all those boxes and more. — Will Guillory\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nZion Williamson probably won't be traded, but growing tensions, rumors say a lot\n\n15. Atlanta Hawks\n\nKris Murray | 6-8 forward | 22 years old | Iowa\n\nThe difficulty in picking a player for the Hawks is they can go multiple ways this offseason trying to find ways to pare their payroll — they are currently in the luxury tax with only 10 players under contract for next season — and so it’s hard to determine thin areas on the roster. But Murray, the twin brother of Sacramento rookie Keegan Murray, seems the safest pick here. He averaged 20.8 points as a junior, taking a leap after two years on the bench, and projects as a solid 3-and-D wing. He has the athleticism to play small forward and the strength to play at power forward. He made only 33.5 percent of his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, but he showed strong finishing skills at the rim. His 7-foot wingspan also should pay dividends at both ends of the court. – Jeff Schultz\n\n16. Utah Jazz (via MIN)\n\nJordan Hawkins | 6-4 wing | 21 years old | Connecticut\n\nThe Jazz want to leave this draft with a lead guard and are smitten with Bufkin and also very interested in Wallace and Hood-Schifino. But with both of them off the board, the Jazz also want best player available. In this spot, that comes down to Hawkins or Keyonte George. I’m personally going to go Hawkins here because he’s the best shooter in the draft.\n\nHe’s the very definition of a weapon shooter who can bend a defense with his gravity alone. He shoots it on the move. He’s terrific off the catch. He can shoot it off the dribble. He shoots it coming off screens. Once you get to the 16th pick of the draft, value comes in a guy having a singular elite NBA skill, and Hawkins has the ability to one day be the best shooter in the NBA. The Jazz need a point guard. They also need more shooting on their roster. At No. 16, if you can find someone who’s the best player in a draft at a major skill, that’s a win. — Jones\n\n17. Los Angeles Lakers\n\nDereck Lively II | 7-1 center| 19 years old | Duke\n\nAssuming the Lakers keep their pick — there is an increasing likelihood they trade it Thursday — landing a lottery-level talent like Lively would be the best-case scenario. Lively is No. 10 on Sam Vecenie’s final big board and was projected to go No. 14 in his latest mock draft; getting him with the No. 17 pick would be a theft for Los Angeles. The 7-foot-1 center uses his 7-foot-7 wingspan and elite athleticism and mobility well on the defensive end, emerging as one of college basketball’s best rim protectors and defenders in the second half of last season.\n\nOffensively, he’s a monster lob-threat and solid rim runner. Most importantly, the 19-year-old possesses the type of relentless motor that has come to define the most successful Lakers role players during the LeBron James-Anthony Davis era. Under Davis’ tutelage, Lively could eventually develop into a DeAndre Jordan-type with better shooting range and more defensive upside. He would be a steal. — Jovan Buha\n\n18. Miami Heat\n\nNick Smith Jr. | 6-4 combo guard | 19 years old | Arkansas\n\nThere’s a chance Miami ends up including this pick in any deal it tries to make this offseason as the Heat look for one more veteran scorer to put around Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. If Miami keeps the pick, this feels like a good landing spot for Smith, who was held to 17 games in his only season at Arkansas due to injury. When healthy, Smith proved to be a capable shot creator with soft touch around the basket. His slim build will make him a bit of a target on defense early in his career, but he has the potential to be an explosive scorer at the next level. Playing on a veteran team will also give him the time he needs to mature as a decision-maker at the point of attack. He can step in early and provide some instant offense off the bench for a Heat squad that finished 25th in offensive rating last season. — Guillory\n\n19. Golden State Warriors\n\nJaime Jaquez Jr. | 6-6 guard | UCLA\n\nThis would be considered a reach at No. 19 and makes more sense in a trade down scenario, adding an extra asset and lowering his rookie salary (which matters exponentially in the repeater tax world). But that isn’t offered in this exercise. So it’s Jaquez here mostly because of his polish and perceived readiness as a winning role player. Here is what new general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. said at his introductory news conference on Monday: “You could make the argument that last year we were too young in some ways. Sure.”\n\nThe Warriors drafted five teenagers the last three drafts. That roster imbalance hurt the back end of a thinned out rotation last season. This is a team trying to contend. Ryan Rollins and Patrick Baldwin Jr. weren’t ready to contribute and may not be again. If they use the 19th pick, it should be somebody they believe can provide 20 legit rotation minutes as a rookie, if needed. Jaquez profiles as such and plays a style conducive to Steve Kerr’s system. They had him into the facility for a workout and interview on the same day Bob Myers stepped down as GM. — Anthony Slater\n\n20. Houston Rockets (via LAC)\n\nJett Howard | 6-7 wing | 19 years old | Michigan\n\nRockets officials are weighing the prospect of trading this pick, but if they hold on to it, they should add an outside threat. Udoka has privately and publicly stressed the burning need for an injection of shooting on a Rockets team that finished bottom of the barrel in 3-point percentage last season. Howard steps in as a fluid 6-foot-7 sniper who showed he was more than a standstill spacer at Michigan, able to run off screens and different actions to get open. That’s a skill desperately needed in Houston. Defensively, he has a long way to go physically and schematically, but at that size and with a head coach who lives and breathes by it, Howard’s upside outweighs his shortcomings. — Iko\n\n21. Brooklyn Nets (via PHX)\n\nKeyonte George | 6-4 guard | 19 years old| Baylor\n\nAs deep as the Nets are on the wing, they need help in the backcourt. Seth Curry is a free agent this summer. Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris each have one year left on their contracts. Cam Thomas, despite a few big scoring outbursts, has yet to settle into a full-time rotation player. George was a top-10 player in his high school class who played capably as a freshman in the Big 12. He gives the Nets a young, talented guard prospect with a strong pedigree who could develop into a possible backcourt starter. — Vorkunov\n\n22. Brooklyn Nets\n\nDariq Whitehead | 6-6 wing | 18 years old| Duke\n\nWe’ll see if the Nets use both of their first-round picks this week, but if they do, then taking a lottery ticket with their second one seems like a worthwhile pursuit. Whitehead was the No. 1 player in his high school class, according to the consensus rankings, and is a prototype wing who can really shoot and has a 6-foot-10 wingspan. He struggled during his one year at Duke, but that was after August surgery on the fifth metatarsal bone in his right foot that forced him out of the preseason and Duke’s first three games. He had a second surgery this month, so he has a significant injury history, but that will be balanced against his dominant high school career and physical traits. — Vorkunov\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nHow will Dariq Whitehead's injury-filled season impact his draft stock?\n\n23. Portland Trail Blazers (via NY)\n\nLeonard Miller | 6-9 forward | 19 years old | G League Ignite\n\nThis pick came down between Miller and Alabama forward Noah Clowney but ultimately went the way of Miller with the thought that he is closer to being ready. It also helped that Miller has some familiarity and chemistry with Henderson, the Blazers’ pick at No. 3, with whom he will once again team up. The Miller pick addresses the Blazers’ long-term need for length, while providing a dynamic player who can score at all three levels. — Quick\n\n24. Sacramento Kings\n\nMaxwell Lewis | 6-6 wing | 20 years old | Pepperdine\n\nThe Kings need retooling on the wing, and while Lewis is likely a bit of a project, his upside is too high to pass on. He shot 34.8 percent from 3 last season, but connected on 44.1 percent of his catch-and-shoot 3s, per Synergy Sports. Lewis also seems comfortable with dribble handoffs, a staple of Sacramento’s offense, where he made defenders pay if they went under screens.\n\nHe’s shown defensive potential but was inconsistent. Lewis’ athleticism and frame coupled with Mike Brown’s defensive demands make me optimistic he’ll come around on that end. In time, I can see Lewis rounding out to become a reliable three-level scorer capable of fitting in with Brown’s offense or creating for himself and others. — Hunter Patterson\n\n25. Memphis Grizzlies\n\nOlivier-Maxence Prosper | 6-7 wing | 20 years old | Marquette\n\nThis is a fun pick for me because I have personally interviewed Prosper and found him to be a thoughtful, engaging young man. He’ll be good in Memphis, and he does have some the skill sets the Grizzlies need in a Dillon Brooks replacement. He can’t turn into a clown, and he has to knock down an occasional outside shot. I’m confident in the no clowning part, and I’ll leave it to Taylor Jenkins and his staff to figure out the rest. – Vardon\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nGrizzlies inform Dillon Brooks he will not be brought back: Sources\n\n26. Indiana Pacers (via CLE)\n\nBrice Sensabaugh | 6-6 wing | 19 years old | Ohio State\n\nThings are going to be wild at the back end of the first round, but if the Pacers hang onto the 26th pick, they will still want the best available player. Sensabaugh can score. One of the best freshman in the country last year, Sensabaugh shot it at a 48/40/83 split on tough, self-created shots. He showcased NBA range and elite touch from the midrange. He comes into the NBA with a real NBA body at 6-foot-6, 230 pounds, and he knows how to use it, often abusing smaller guards last season. Big scoring guards have proven invaluable come playoff time, and I think Sensabaugh has the potential to be a real steal at this point. – DuFour\n\n27. Charlotte Hornets (via DEN)\n\nColby Jones | 6-5 wing | 21 years old | Xavier\n\nThis was part of the deal to sell the team. The Hornets had to draft a wing here as the Hayward experiment is almost over. He is in the last year of his $120 million contract, and in the old days, he would be a prime candidate for a trade to a team looking to clear cap space, or, if he were to somehow stay healthy, as a rental to a contender. Both of those scenarios are possible, I suppose, but in any case, he won’t be here much longer. This is a league where wing is maybe the most important position. Take a flier on Jones, who is perhaps undersized but is an older, more experienced college player who may be mentally ready for the next step. – Vardon\n\n28. Utah Jazz (via PHI)\n\nAndre Jackson | 6-6 wing | 21 years old | Connecticut\n\nWith the Jazz wanting to get long and athletic, Jackson makes a lot of sense here. He can’t shoot a lick at this stage. But he does almost everything else at a high level. He’s a terrific playmaker, passer and defender. He is competitive and makes the right reads. He’s a high-level athlete who affects the game substantially with how hard he plays. If the Jazz can develop the shooting part, and that’s huge for Jackson, you are looking at an NBA rotation-level player. — Jones\n\n29. Indiana Pacers (via BOS)\n\nJames Nnaji | 6-11 big | 18 years old | Barcelona\n\nIf you’re the Pacers picking here, you’ve already nailed your first two picks thanks to a genius front office in this mock draft. Why not swing on a development guy? Nnaji is a 6-foot-11, 250-pound big man who is a true project. Only playing 38 games in his two seasons at Barcelona, he did flash excellent athleticism on both ends. Offensively, while not a shooter or anything resembling dangerous with the ball in his hands, he is effective as a lob catcher or put-back guy. On the defensive end, he projects to be a plus rim protector and won’t get beaten badly on the perimeter. Nnaji is raw but well worth a look in this scenario. – DuFour\n\n30. LA Clippers (via MIL)\n\nNoah Clowney | 6-10 forward | 18 years old | Alabama\n\nThe Clippers are in best available player mode, but they’ve needed an upgrade in athletic size during Tyronn Lue’s entire tenure as head coach. Getting a prospect like Clowney, without even trading up, would be an incredible result considering how Clowney will be considered by teams as soon as the lottery ends. I wouldn’t expect him to be ready to contribute to next season’s Clippers team. He graduated from high school a year ago, had subpar percentages for a big shooter and averaged less than 1.0 assists, steals and blocks last season.\n\nBut the one thing I know he could do right now is rebound, especially on the offensive glass. That is an area of weakness for the Clippers. And Clowney played his role next to a traditional center in Charles Bediako and held up for a 31-6 team, displaying enough developmental skill to possibly play the power forward spot at the next level. He has the right mindset to fit the long-term goals of a Clippers team that needs prospects in this spot to start popping. — Law Murray\n\nRelated reading\n\nHollinger: My Top 75 prospects in this year’s class\n\nAldridge: NBA Draft Confidential — guards | forwards | bigs\n\nDavis: Scouts offer candid views on this year’s class\n\nWant basketball content delivered to your inbox for free?
