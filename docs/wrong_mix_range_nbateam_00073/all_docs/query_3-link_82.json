        "text": "Losing to the Rockets would be a crushing blow for the Warriors, but what if they also wound up losing Klay Thompson?\n\nESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Monday there’s a chance the Warriors’ five-time All-Star could leave in free agency and potentially sign with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThompson, who is from Southern California, has repeatedly said he wants to finish his career with the Warriors. And, should the Warriors offer Thompson a max deal as they’ve indicated in the past they would, he’ll gladly sign the contract.\n\nBut, as Wojnarowski reported, offering Thompson anything short of a max deal opens up the possibility of Golden State’s other Splash Brother leaving for L.A. — but not for the Lakers, who have been rumored to be eyeing him.\n\n“If they come with a five-year, $190 million max deal for Klay Thompson, that’s done on July 1, he’s going into the new building with Steph Curry,” Wojnarowski said on ESPN’s “Get Up!” “If they try to do anything less than that, you can expect Klay Thompson to be out in free agency.\n\n“Watch not for the Lakers, then, but the Clippers.”\n\nThe speculation could be much ado about nothing considering offering Thompson anything less than a max deal wouldn’t give the Warriors salary cap room to pursue free agents. Plus, they wouldn’t seem to want to risk insulting Thompson and possibly losing him with a less-than-max offer. In the Warriors’ perfect scenario, both Thompson and Kevin Durant would return on new max contracts.\n\nThe Warriors are already repeat luxury tax payers and will keep doing so for the foreseeable future without hesitation. After all, they’ll also be seeing a sharp increase in revenue with the move to Chase Center next season.\n\nThus, Thompson’s free agency that begins on July 1 shouldn’t be a concern for the Warriors at all.\n\nNow, about those Rockets …"
