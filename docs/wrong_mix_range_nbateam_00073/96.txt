After cathing an elbow just above the right eye from Chandler Parsons, a bloody Mike Dunleavy Jr was forced to leave the game in the second quarter and the Bulls said his return was questionable. Being the gangster that he is, Lilâ€™ Dun shrugged off the nasty cut to score 21 second half points and grab 7 rebounds, leading Chicago to an impressive 111-87 win against the Houston Rockets.
