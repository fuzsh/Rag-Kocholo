Last season, the Golden State Warriors signed Anderson Varejao after the rival Cleveland Cavaliers waived him. Now, the Warriors may be eyeing a similar strategy with a different player – recently-traded sharpshooting wing Mike Dunleavy Jr. This report comes from ESPN’s Chris Haynes:

As Haynes points out in his tweet, Dunleavy would first need to have his contract bought out by the Hawks – an idea that Dunleavy is reportedly keen on. The Hawks may be less excited about the buyout, though.

The Houston Rockets are also interested in acquiring Dunleavy, reports ESPN’s Calvin Watkins:

However, despite the interest, Watkins reports that Dunleavy is unlikely to land in Houston:

The Rockets and Warriors are both elite shooting teams, and adding Dunleavy – a career 37.6 percent three-point shooter – would give either team even more shooting depth on the wing.
