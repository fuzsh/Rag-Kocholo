        "text": "After 31 years of doing business as Diskeeper, the disk defragmentation company announced today that it has changed its name to Condusiv Technologies and is working to reshape its product image.\n\nCondusiv still offers disk defragmentation software, but the company will focus its marketing efforts on caching software for flash memory and a new version of its Undelete product.\n\n“The company walked and talked like a disk defragmentation company,” Condusiv CEO Jerry Baldwin said. “I had to take and change a market leading company that had gotten set in its ways and wasn’t looking at the outside world or paying attention to its customers.”\n\n“I guess I’d have to say I redid everything … to reposition its technology prowess and its direction in the marketplace,” added Baldwin, who was appointed Diskeeper’s CEO in September.\n\nBaldwin said the company’s ExpressCache software product, which is used in conjunction with solid state drives (SSD) to cache the most frequently used data on Windows 7 systems, is being used in the products made by five of the top seven PC system manufacturers. And, it will soon be in the products of the top nine PC manufacturers.\n\n“The only major manufacturer we’re not working with is IBM,” he said.\n\nThe company is not just pushing its ExpressCache software. It also launched a new version of its Undelete software.\n\nUndelete replaces a Windows recycle bin with a catch-all Recovery Bin that intercepts all deleted files, no matter how they were deleted or who deleted them, and saves them for later retrieval.\n\nUndelete version 10 has a new user interface and functionality tailored to serve consumers and corporate users with a one-touch method of undeleting files. The Server, Professional and Client editions of Undelete let you see the contents of Recovery Bins on remote computers like file servers, allowing IT shops or users to recover their deleted files across the network with a single click of a button.\n\n“We saw IT administrators spending a lot of time when users accidentally deleted files and they called IT managers to recover them,” said Gary Quan, CTO of Diskeeper. “Well, the Windows Recovery Bin doesn’t catch all deleted files. It only catches files deleted from Windows Explorer.”\n\nWith Undelete 10, it’s no longer necessary to search backup tapes or Windows Shadow copies when a user accidentally deletes a file from the server,” Quan said.\n\n“Many times users don’t remember the name of a file or where it was deleted from,” Quan said.\n\nUndelete can also restore files previously purged from the Recycle Bin or the Undelete Recovery Bin, even if they were deleted before Undelete was installed, Baldwin said.\n\nJust as with previous versions of Undelete, version 10 automatically captures deleted files and stores them in the Undelete Recovery Bin. Undelete 10 captures all the files the Windows Recycle Bin misses, such as those deleted from shared network folders, deleted from commonly used applications, deleted by the Windows command prompt, or replaced when newer versions of a file are saved.\n\nLike Time Machine on Apple OS X, Undelete v10 also has versioning, meaning it can capture modified files several times between a backup or shadow copy. With Undelete, each file version will be saved and is recoverable.\n\nIn the coming months, Balwin said Consusiv will be making additional product announcements in line with its new direction.\n\n“Condusiv is a more modern and dynamic expression of the company’s new marketplace position as a leader providing software optimization and performance solutions that can swiftly help to bridge economic recovery with restored economic growth for customers,” Baldwin said.\n\nLucas Mearian covers storage, disaster recovery and business continuity, financial services infrastructure and health care IT for Computerworld.
