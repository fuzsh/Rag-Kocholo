        "text": "<strong>Executive</strong> <strong>Summary</strong> This document describes test procedures for Diskeeper® 2011 evaluation. Specifically, the tests described in this document are intended to achieve the following objectives: 1. Evaluate the effectiveness of Diskeeper 2011 in preventing and removing disk fragmentation. 2. Evaluate system performance improvement from using Diskeeper 2011. 3. Evaluate impact of Diskeeper 2011 on system resources while defragmenting disks. 4. Evaluating the effectiveness of Diskeeper 2011 in making systems more energy efficient. Note that Diskeeper 2011 offers the revolutionary Instant Defrag technology, which immediately eliminates any fragmentation not proactively prevented by IntelliWrite® fragmentation prevention. Virtually any task performed on the system will benefit from the combination of these two features. The first test documents are an example of an IntelliWrite & Instant Defrag test. Diskeeper 2011 also introduces Efficient Mode, a method of automatic defragmentation that ensures maximum disk optimization with minimum resource overhead. <strong>Methodology</strong> ReadFile is employed to evaluate the system performance improvement from using Diskeeper 2011. ReadFile.exe, a file access time measurement tool, measures the length of time taken to open, read all of the clusters allocated to the targeted file, and then close it. Results are expressed in milliseconds (msec), and it also calculates the Transfer Rate as expressed in Kb/sec. Futuremark’s PC Mark Vantage benchmark tool is used to measure the impact Diskeeper has on system resources while defragmenting disks. PCMark Vantage uses a proprietary scoring system that measures computer performance across a variety of common tasks such as viewing and editing documents, photos, video, music and other media, gaming, communications, productivity and security (higher scores are better). Specifically, the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) test suite is used to evaluate disk system performance. The tool, as well as relevant documentation, can be obtained from the following location. http://www.futuremark.com/benchmarks/pcmarkvantage © 2011 Diskeeper Corporation. All Rights Reserved."
