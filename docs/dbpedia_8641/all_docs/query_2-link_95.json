        "text": "There are decisions I made with this novel that were lead by my heart and not using my business-brain and I was well aware of that. If I don’t release a book now and then for the joy of it with everything the way I want it to be, I mean, what’s the point?\n\nEven though this was a passion book, I wanted it to have some modicum of success. Even though my standard book release hits around 500~2,000 in the entire store, my goal for ranking today was 10,000 just to be realistic.\n\nI checked at 8PM and had a heavy heart that I’d hit the 13,000s, I’d been hoping for better. But then an hour later I checked again and apparently, Amazon hadn’t updated the charts yet, because it shot to the 3,000s! I was so happy!\n\nI was afraid this book would be so off-market that I’d lose money on it, but editing and covers have already been paid for, so I’m excited about that! There’s also a tidy profit, which I was hoping for but not counting on, so it gives me the go-ahead to keep writing this series sooner rather than later.\n\nI’m accustomed to better book releases, but I call this one a win. Especially after the positive reviews. I’ve never received a review like this and a review has never made me cry, until now.\n\nI’ve never met you Katie, but thank you for encouraging me. Thank you for noticing the passion I put into this book. It makes me so happy that I listened to my heart and wrote the story I wanted to write and that I gained a fan like you."
