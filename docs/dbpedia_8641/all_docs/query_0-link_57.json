I watched her on the Brunei news via the link posted for Aug 29th, and I realised that she probably doesn't speak Malay at home! Her Malay is melodious, but there is a very distinct English accent, and the general intonation indicates that she doesn't use Malay as an everyday language. Anyway countries like Brunei and Singapore where the Malays speak English more fluently than Malay is nothing uncommon.\n\nDang, she's just so sweet!\n\nHumera\n\nModerator Emeritus\n\nJoined\n\nNov 9, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n7,805\n\nCountry\n\nCanada\n\nI agree.
