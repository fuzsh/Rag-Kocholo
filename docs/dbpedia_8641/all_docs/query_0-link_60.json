Read on to see all that’s coming this year!\n\nFollow us on Twitter (@MacmillanLib) for all book-related news, on Instagram (@Macmillan_Lib) for pretty pictures of books, and read our “Day’s YA” reviews of upcoming YA titles.\n\nClick here to view to view the Edelweiss catalog of these titles.\n\nWinter 2024\n\nA FRAGILE ENCHANTMENT by Allison Saft\n\n9781250892836\n\nAvailable now | 1/2/2024\n\nWednesday Books\n\nAges 13-18\n\nIn this romantic fantasy of manners, a magical dressmaker commissioned for a royal wedding finds herself embroiled in scandal when a gossip columnist draws attention to her undeniable chemistry with the groom.\n\n“Saft breathes enchanting life into this Regency-influenced fantasy world, and the intricate worldbuilding and class politics never come at the cost of the romantic leads’ titillating chemistry or the riveting plot that drives the action forward.”\n\nPublishers Weekly, starred review\n\n“Fans of Regency romances will revel in this fantastical affair.” Kirkus Reviews\n\nARYA KHANNA’S BOLLYWOOD MOMENT by Arushi Avachat\n\nHC: 9781250895110 | TP: 9781250895134\n\nAvailable now | 1/9/2024\n\nWednesday Books\n\nAges 13-18\n\nA YA romance where a teen girl navigates her older sister’s wedding, family and friend conflict, and a rivalry with the attractive student body president.
