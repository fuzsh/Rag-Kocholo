        "text": "Mar. 2015. 272p. Bloomsbury, hardcover, $17.99 (9781619634855). Grades 5-8.\n\nREVIEW. First published October 1, 2014 (Booklist).\n\nOn the day that Miri is to return to her beloved Mount Eskel, she is summoned by King Bjorn of Danland, requesting her to travel to outer territorial Lesser Alva, where she is to tutor three royal sisters. If the King of Stora chooses one to marry, war will be prevented, and it’s up to Miri to succeed. Unhappy but duty-bound, Miri accepts the task, only to meet three wild girls who spend their days wrestling on the floor and hunting and fishing in the swamp. They are dirty, unkempt, and uneducated. Eventually, however, Miri—armed with only the three books she brought and no money—cleverly weaves her lessons into daily life. When war does come to Danland and approaches Lesser Alva, Miri must figure a way to keep the peace while her almost-betrothed, Peder, sneaks the four girls into the royal city of Asland. When they at last find Queen Sabet, a terrible secret is revealed that could change everything. Action-packed and well paced, the story’s depth incorporates artful negotiation, the importance of education, and citizens’ equality and rights. This final installment of the Princess Academy trilogy certainly leaves room for more books if Hale were so inclined. Won’t she reconsider? Jeanne Fredriksen"
