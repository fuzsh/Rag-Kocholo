        "text": "Our month-by-month exploration of Jane Austen’s life, letters, and novels continues now as we take a look at August in Jane Austen’s world. If you’re new to the series, you can find previous articles here: January, February, March, April, May, June, and July.\n\nDuring the lovely summer months in the Hampshire countryside, we know Jane loved to walk and write and visit with friends and family. Sometimes the days are hot, but most of the time, it’s sunny and warm–usually with a chance of showers, which is what helps keep things so pretty and green. If you visit Chawton House Gardens or Jane Austen’s House this time of year, there is plenty to see!\n\nAusten in Stitches\n\nThis summer, Chawton House Museum is hosting the “Chawton in Stitches” exhibit, which showcases “the work of award-winning graduate of the Royal School of Needlework Emily Barnett, whose degree project took inspiration from the gardens and collection at Chawton House. Her final showstopping piece comprises three beautifully embroidered panels, focusing on the Orchard and the Knight family cookbook, the Rose Garden and Elizabeth Blackwell’s Curious Herbal, and the Library Terrace and the women’s writing collection.”\n\nYou can read more about it HERE.\n\nAusten Fountain Pens\n\nThe Jane Austen House Museum is proud to announce a beautiful new set of pens from Montblanc: “Historic luxury pen manufacturer Montblanc releases four exquisite limited edition writing instruments, celebrating Jane Austen and inspired by Jane Austen’s House.”\n\n“The Montblanc Writers Edition Homage to Jane Austen pays tribute to Jane Austen as one of Britain’s most celebrated novelists with four limited edition pens. Each writing instrument in the collection represents a passion in Jane Austen’s life, including the countryside, this very House, travel and the ball, illustrating the many facets of her life and works. Details in the craftsmanship of each pen seamlessly reflect aspects of Jane Austen’s life and writing.”\n\nAugust in Jane Austen’s Letters\n\nJane tends to write about the weather at some point in her letters, and her August letters are no different:\n\nCork Street, August 1796\n\n“We reached Staines yesterday, I do not (know) when, without suffering so much from the heat as I had hoped to do. We set off again this morning at seven o’clock, and had a very pleasant drive, as the morning was cloudy and perfectly cool. I came all the way in the chaise from Hertford Bridge.”\n\nShe also writes about Henry’s lovely new home in Hans Place, about her own room, the gardens, and the downstairs room that seems to be where she writes in the morning.\n\n23 Hans Place, August 1814\n\n“It is a delightful place,—more than answers my expectation. Having got rid of my unreasonable ideas, I find more space and comfort in the rooms than I had supposed, and the garden is quite a love. I am in the front attic, which is the bedchamber to be preferred.”\n\n“I live in [Henry’s] room downstairs; it is particularly pleasant from opening upon the garden. I go and refresh myself every now and then, and then come back to solitary coolness.”\n\n“Now I have breakfasted and have the room to myself again. It is likely to be a fine day. How do you all do?”\n\nFrom Vic: “In 1814, Henry moved from his rooms above his bank to a house he purchased in Hans Place in Knightsbridge. The area was situated near his old quarters on Sloane Street.” You can read more about Hans Place in Vic’s detailed article, “Jane Austen’s Visits to London.”\n\nAugust in Jane Austen’s Novels\n\nPride and Prejudice\n\nMr. Gardiner writes to Mr. Bennet in August (Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2). Elizabeth reads the letter:\n\n“My dear Brother, At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet. It is enough to know they are discovered: I have seen them both——”\n\n“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane: “they are married!”\n\nElizabeth reads on: “I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum…”\n\nMansfield Park\n\nTom Bertram arrives home: “Sir Thomas was to return in November, and his eldest son had duties to call him earlier home. The approach of September brought tidings of Mr. Bertram, first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter to Edmund; and by the end of August he arrived himself, to be gay, agreeable, and gallant again as occasion served, or Miss Crawford demanded; to tell of races and Weymouth, and parties and friends, to which she might have listened six weeks before with some interest, and altogether to give her the fullest conviction, by the power of actual comparison, of her preferring his younger brother.”\n\nSir Thomas arrives home earlier than expected: “Julia, appearing at it, with a face all aghast, exclaimed, ‘My father is come! He is in the hall at this moment.’ How is the consternation of the party to be described? To the greater number it was a moment of absolute horror. Sir Thomas in the house! All felt the instantaneous conviction. Not a hope of imposition or mistake was harboured anywhere. Julia’s looks were an evidence of the fact that made it indisputable; and after the first starts and exclamations, not a word was spoken for half a minute: each with an altered countenance was looking at some other, and almost each was feeling it a stroke the most unwelcome, most ill-timed, most appalling! Mr. Yates might consider it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening, and Mr. Rushworth might imagine it a blessing; but every other heart was sinking under some degree of self-condemnation or undefined alarm, every other heart was suggesting, ‘What will become of us? what is to be done now?’ It was a terrible pause; and terrible to every ear were the corroborating sounds of opening doors and passing footsteps.”\n\nEmma\n\nAugust is when Jane Fairfax will leave Highbury: “Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother’s; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton’s activity in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will.”\n\nEmma’s sisters Isabella plans to visit in August (and will keep Harriet with them until then): “Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back.”\n\nPersuasion\n\nAnne Elliot’s birthday: Anne, born August 9, 1787.\n\nCaptain Wentworth goes to stay with Captain Benwick in August in order to break the news of Fanny Harville’s (his fiancée’s) death: “Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape, just made into the Grappler. I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him; he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth. There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm. Nobody could do it, but that good fellow (pointing to Captain Wentworth). The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her being sent to sea again. He stood his chance for the rest; wrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week. That’s what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James. You may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!”\n\nAugust Dates of Importance\n\nThis brings us now to several important August dates that relate to Jane and her family:\n\nFamily News:\n\n26 August 1766: George Austen (Jane’s brother) born at Deane.\n\nJuly-August 1768: Austen family moves to Steventon, Hampshire.\n\nHistoric Dates:\n\n1 August 1798: Horatio Nelson’s victory over Napoleon’s fleet at the Battle of the Nile.\n\nWriting:\n\nAugust 1797: Austen finishes “First Impressions.”\n\n8 August 1815: Austen begins Persuasion.\n\nAugust 1816: Persuasion revised and finished.\n\nSorrows:\n\n9 August 1798: Lady Williams (Jane Cooper, one of Austen’s lifelong friends), dies in a tragic carriage accident on the Isle of Wight at the age of 27.\n\nSummer Wanes\n\nAs the summer heat slowly diminishes in Jane Austen’s England, we can look forward to the first breaths of autumn next month when we return to examine September in Jane Austen’s World.

Cox\n\nA few days ago I reviewed Collins Hemingway’s fascinating new book on the development of Austen’s writing techniques, Jane Austen and the Creation of Modern Fiction: Six Novels in “a Style Entirely New.” Today we meet with the author to get his perspectives on the book.\n\nI asked Collins Hemingway to tell us more about Jane Austen and the Creation of Modern Fiction.\n\nJAW: What led you to write this book, Collins?\n\nCollins: I’ve read Austen all my life, but I did not read much commentary during my 25-year high-tech career. When I came back to Austen fulltime, I read a ton of Austen scholarship from the last 20 years. I noticed that there wasn’t much about her writing, as writing. Scholars would mention a technique and use it as a launch point for broader criticism. With rare exceptions, they would not analyze the technique itself or how it affected the reader. I saw this as an area in which I could add something new.\n\nJAW: You have, of course, written a fiction series, The Marriage of Miss Jane Austen. How did your experiences writing fiction about Austen feed into your development of Jane Austen and the Creation of Modern Fiction?\n\nCollins: Writing the novels led directly to this book, though it took several years of hard reading, notetaking, and writing to flesh out the meat over the bones. I have shared that story on my blog.\n\nJAW: The book is full of great insights. For you, what was one of the most helpful, something that helped you see Austen’s novels in a new way?\n\nCollins: After completing the fiction trilogy, I went a step further, going through each of Austen’s six novels line by line, noting everything of interest to a writer. I ended up with 20 to 30 pages of handwritten notes on each one. Then I began to consolidate various topics. For instance, I ended up with five pages of notes just on description, collated from all her books, including the juvenilia. Then I examined the patterns in different aspects of writing and tried to understand how the patterns fit within and between each book.\n\nAs the patterns began to organize themselves, I realized that there was a distinct trend from early to late. In each book, Austen learned something, then applied it in the succeeding books. Like Virginia Woolf examining the early works and the unfinished works, I began to see the internal structures of each book. (As my wife would caution—in my opinion.) I could see how Austen was feeling her way along in the early works, then painting like a master in the later ones.\n\nJAW: You’ve pointed out the strengths and weaknesses of each of Austen’s novels. It appears that you see Emma as the most “perfect” novel, as other commentators do. But for you personally, which novel do you tend to enjoy re-reading the most, and why?\n\nCollins: Depends on my mood. P&P for its sheer energy, and for Liz bowing to no one, ever. Emma for its magnificence, page by page. Persuasion for the depth of Anne’s feeling. MP, though it is in no way my favorite, when I just want to admire the structural purity and the work she put into it.\n\nJAW: You talk about many techniques of modern fiction that Jane Austen helped to develop and show how they developed in her novels over time. Could you briefly list for us some of those techniques, so readers can see some of the treats they have in store?\n\nCollins: She was a master of dialogue probably from the day she first picked up a quill pen. Description. Behavior. Character motivation and interaction. Complex plots (without castles, brigands, or shipwrecks.) Ever deeper and subtler ways to get into her characters’ minds.\n\nJAW: What is one takeaway that you want readers to have when they finish reading your book?\n\nCollins: What Austen accomplished would make any author proud. But the fact that she learned all that she did on her own, away from other writers, pulling the best from a small number of others (such as Richardson, in a very specific way), building on a few good things from tradition, figuring out the rest on her own—it’s astonishing. And she did it in her too short 41.5 years of life!\n\nJAW: What was the most fun part of the book to write?\n\nCollins: My breakthrough in really understanding the internals came through descriptions. They unlocked the issues in NA and S&S, showed how radically different P&P was from the earlier two, and became miraculously mature in MP. This was the most fun. Especially when I realized the difference in the way Austen treated Lady Russell and Anne as they entered Bath in Persuasion. It took my breath away to see what Austen had done.\n\nYou may want to read my review if you missed it earlier. This is a fascinating book if you want to better understand Jane Austen’s modern writing techniques and how she developed them herself. Jane Austen and the Creation of Modern Fiction is available from Amazon and from Jane Austen Books. Jane Austen Books is currently offering it at a substantial discount.\n\nBrenda S. Cox is the author of Fashionable Goodness: Christianity in Jane Austen’s England. She also blogs at Faith, Science, Joy, and Jane Austen.\n\nBy Brenda S. Cox\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed Jane Austen and the Creation of Modern Fiction: Six Novels in “a Style Entirely New,” by Collins Hemingway. As a fiction writer himself, Hemingway examines Austen’s novels, in the order she wrote them, to analyze the techniques she pioneered. He observes her abilities growing from novel to novel, as she experiments and succeeds in creating the worlds and characters we so love.\n\nA New Style?\n\nDid Jane Austen develop a new style of novel-writing? Her contemporary reviewers thought so. They felt compelled to give long contrasts between the previous style of novel-writing, full of intensity and improbability, with Jane Austen’s new realistic style. Sir Walter Scott in his 1815 review of Emma said Austen “draws the characters and incidents introduced more immediately from the current of everyday life.” Rev. Richard Whately wrote in his 1821 review of Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, “A new style of novel has arisen. . . . The substitute for these excitements [of unlikely adventures] . . . was the art of copying from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life.” Both these reviews are worth reading (follow the links above) to see how Austen’s contemporaries struggled to describe what she was, and wasn’t, doing in her novels.\n\nThe third volume of Austen’s Juvenilia includes a penciled note inside the front cover, “Effusions of Fancy by a very Young Lady consisting of Tales in a Style entirely new.” Peter Sabor says this inscription is written in Jane’s father’s handwriting, though others have speculated that it may have been written by Cassandra or even by Jane herself, tongue-in-cheek.\n\nAuthor Collins Hemingway told me, “The epigram seems most likely to me to be from her father. . . . To me, the quotation is Mr. Austen enjoying and encouraging Jane’s raw power and comedy, her sheer audacity in sending up the pulp fiction of the day with her various teenage writings. I saw a strong parallel to her adult fiction. Her juvenilia showed that she understood that traditional fiction didn’t cut it. Her adult fiction shows that she learned how to write good novels—something new at the time.”\n\nJane Austen Learning (or Inventing) the Craft of Writing Fiction\n\nJane Austen and the Creation of Modern Fiction starts out with a preface for more academic readers (feel free to skip it if that’s not you), then an introduction for us all, which begins:\n\n“I wrote this book so that people can read Jane Austen with fresh eyes. I wanted booklovers to view her not as a literary or cultural icon but as a writer, someone who puts words to paper to try to touch another person’s heart. I wanted people to see her as a human being who struggled to master her craft as anyone in any field, regardless of talent, must do. . . . As both a student of literature and a writer, I wanted to know how Austen affects readers. I wanted to know how she created remarkably real people interacting in remarkably realistic situations. This is what writers care about, and what readers respond to.”\n\nYes.\n\nHemingway starts with an exploration of the context of Austen’s writing, how she “straddled the old and new literary order, ultimately pivoting the novel from improbable adventures to deep penetration of the minds of her heroines.” (These early chapters are necessarily a bit more difficult, as they compare Austen with her contemporaries, who most of us have not read—and here we can see why Austen is so much more accessible than other writers of her time!)\n\nThen he brings us deep into our beloved Austen–following her development of description in her earliest novels, Northanger Abbey and Sense and Sensibility. In Pride and Prejudice, she continues to develop “pocket descriptions,” which are “pithy, telling details.” For example, Elizabeth Bennet’s jumping over stiles and puddles and arriving at Netherfield with “weary ancles” and “dirty stockings” is a pocket description that shows us a lot about Elizabeth.\n\nSense and Sensibility was originally written in the popular “epistolary” form, as a series of letters. Letters give a sense of distance, as the character is writing about events that have already happened, rather than the author drawing readers directly into events. A chapter analyzes how Austen made the transition from letters into narrative. For example, Edward Ferrars is a “blurry” presence in the early chapters, which are closer to the letter format. By the end of the novel, though, Austen has added vivid, immediate scenes. So, in the final proposal scene, we see Edward as “the very real and anguished presence of a human being.”\n\nMy favorite chapter is the one on “The Marvelous Complexity of Mansfield Park.” Hemingway’s discussion helps readers appreciate its elaborate scenes, complex characters, and interconnected plotlines. He particularly explores the depths of Fanny Price’s thoughts and feelings.\n\nFanny’s “responses, which for the most part only the reader observes, show her to be by far the most complex individual Austen ever creates. Outwardly, she is a saint. Inwardly, she is as confused and angry as any person who is regularly embarrassed or put down. Her raw feelings sometimes overpower her Christian charity and patience.” Austen even uses the furnishings of Fanny’s room to show her interior life. Fanny constantly examines her own motives, trying to find the right path.\n\nEvery chapter includes new insights into Austen’s novels, her writing techniques, and her development as an author.\n\nPersuasion\n\nOne area of the book that Janeites might find a little uncomfortable is the section on Persuasion. Collins Hemingway discusses the revision process—authors generally rewrite their books multiple times. He points out several areas in Persuasion that could be considered imperfect. For example, Mrs. Smith is not quite consistent. Why does she encourage Anne to marry Mr. Elliot, then reveal how horrible he is? And why does Lady Russell mostly disappear from the second half of the book?\n\nAusten might have fixed these issues with a major rewrite. (I suggest she also might have changed Charles Hayter’s name, so we wouldn’t have two adult characters named Charles, besides Charles Musgrove’s son Little Charles.) But Hemingway suggests that perhaps her health was failing already, and she did not have the time and energy for major revision. She had already replaced the original ending with the beautiful one we know and love. And, in “the quiet passion of Anne Elliot,” she had already given readers “a depth of character never seen before.”\n\nIf Austen had begun another revision to fix smaller structural issues, she might not have had a publishable version available when she died. So, Hemingway persuades us that Austen wrapped up the work, as it stood, to give the world another work of art and to help provide for her mother and sister after her death. As Hemingway states, “Like Emma, Jane is faultless despite her faults.”\n\nAny lover of Austen will learn a lot from Jane Austen and the Creation of Modern Fiction. I particularly recommend it to writers (like myself), who will enjoy seeing Austen’s techniques and their development. Any of you who love digging deeper into Austen’s novels will find new delights here.\n\nOn Monday, we’ll interview the author to get his perspectives on the book.\n\nJane Austen and the Creation of Modern Fiction is available from Amazon and from Jane Austen Books. Jane Austen Books is currently offering it at a substantial discount.\n\nGentle readers, what aspect of Austen’s writing do you most admire? Her settings, characters, plots, style, humor, or something else?\n\nBrenda S. Cox is the author of Fashionable Goodness: Christianity in Jane Austen’s England. She also blogs at Faith, Science, Joy, and Jane Austen.\n\nAs the summer months continue in our month-by-month exploration of Jane Austen’s life, letters, and novels, we turn our attention to July in Jane Austen’s world. If you’re new to the series, you can find previous articles in this series here: January, February, March, April, May, and June.\n\nLast month, we enjoyed the June roses at Chawton House Gardens. Let’s take a look at our monthly view for July! Can you imagine exploring the walled gardens on a warm summer day? I know two kids who did explore the gardens and the apple orchard (with permission) at Chawton House a few years ago!\n\nJuly in Hampshire\n\nJuly in Hampshire brings sporadic heat waves, overcast days, sunny days, and frequent rain showers. The Austen women moved to Chawton in July 1809:\n\n“On this day (7 July) in 1809 Jane Austen moved to Chawton to live in this house. It was here, in this inspiring cottage, that Jane’s genius flourished and where she wrote, revised, and had published all six of her globally beloved novels.” (Jane Austen’s House Museum)\n\nJuly in Jane Austen’s Letters\n\nWe don’t have as many of Jane’s letters from the month of July on record, though there is one funny aside that caught my attention as I searched through her letters. After complaining earlier to Cassandra about a few days of “cold disagreeable weather,” “fires every day,” and use of her “kerseymere spencer” for evening walks, Jane wrote the following on 1 July 1808: “The weather is mended, which I attribute to my writing about it…”\n\nThe fact is, however, that two of the most important letters we have from the month of July are not from Jane herself but from her sister Cassandra. And those, as many of you well know, are the letters Cassandra wrote to her niece Fanny Knight after Jane’s passing in July 1817.\n\nCassandra’s Letters\n\nCassandra’s letters, which many of you have read, are some of the most beautiful letters we have on record. Jane was Cassandra’s younger sister, but she was also her lifelong companion and best friend. Cassandra’s sorrow at losing one so dear is obvious in her writings.\n\nIn her first letter (18 July 1817), Cassandra tells Fanny about Jane’s last days and hours with delicacy, reverence, and love:\n\nI have lost a treasure, such a sister, such a friend as never can have been surpassed. She was the sun of my life, the gilder of every pleasure, the soother of every sorrow; I had not a thought concealed from her, and it is as if I had lost a part of myself. I loved her only too well,—not better than she deserved, but I am conscious that my affection for her made me sometimes unjust to and negligent of others; and I can acknowledge, more than as a general principle, the justice of the Hand which has struck this blow.\n\nYou know me too well to be at all afraid that I should suffer materially from my feelings; I am perfectly conscious of the extent of my irreparable loss, but I am not at all overpowered and very little indisposed,—nothing but what a short time, with rest and change of air, will remove. I thank God that I was enabled to attend her to the last, and amongst my many causes of self-reproach I have not to add any wilful neglect of her comfort.\n\nIn her second letter (29 July 1817), Cassandra expresses to Fanny that she often thinks of Jane in Heaven and hopes she will one day be reunited with her there:\n\nIf I think of her less as on earth, God grant that I may never cease to reflect on her as inhabiting heaven, and never cease my humble endeavors (when it shall please God) to join her there.\n\nAs a lifelong lover of Jane Austen, I treasure Cassandra’s letters deeply, as I’m sure many of you do too. If you have not read her letters in a while, or if you wish to read them for the first time, you can find them HERE.\n\nJuly in Jane Austen’s Novels\n\nPride and Prejudice\n\nJuly is when Elizabeth travels with Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner: “The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.”\n\nMansfield Park\n\nMr. and Miss Crawford come on the scene: “Such was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had just reached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village received an addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss Crawford, the children of her mother by a second marriage. They were young people of fortune. The son had a good estate in Norfolk, the daughter twenty thousand pounds.”\n\nEmma\n\nThe night before Mr. Knightley returns from London, Emma spends a miserable evening wondering what will come of Harriet’s feelings (and her own feelings) toward Mr. Knightley: “The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield. The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights the longer visible.”\n\nEmma’s thoughts that evening regarding the loss of Mr. Knightley, if he were to marry Harriet: “All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!—No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change his own home for theirs!—How was it to be endured?”\n\nPersuasion\n\nSir Walter Elliot’s wedding day: “Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth, daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, born June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.”\n\nThe letter Mrs. Smith produces from Mr. Elliot, written to “Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,” dated July 1803, reads as follows:\n\n“Dear Smith,\n\n“I have received yours. Your kindness almost overpowers me. I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it. At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being in cash again. Give me joy: I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss. They are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them this summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer. The baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he is quite fool enough. If he does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion. He is worse than last year.\n\n“I wish I had any name but Elliot. I am sick of it. The name of Walter I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be only yours truly,\n\n“WM. ELLIOT.”\n\nJuly Dates of Importance\n\nThis brings us now to several important July dates that relate to Jane and her family:\n\nFamily News:\n\nJuly–August 1768: The Austen family moves to Steventon, Hampshire.\n\n3 July 1779: James Austen matriculates at St. John’s College, Oxford (BA 1783, MA 1788).\n\n1 July 1788: Henry Austen matriculates at St. John’s College, Oxford (BA 1792, MA 1796).\n\n2 July 1806: Mrs. Austen and her daughters leave Bath.\n\n24 July 1806: Francis Austen marries Mary Gibson.\n\n7 July 1809: Austen women and Martha Lloyd move to Chawton Cottage.\n\nHistoric Dates:\n\n14 July 1789: Storming of the Bastille in Paris.\n\nJuly 1793: Beginning of the Reign of Terror in France.\n\nWriting:\n\nJuly 1813: Austen (most likely) finishes Mansfield Park.\n\n18 July 1816: Austen completes first draft of Persuasion.\n\nSorrows:\n\n18 July 1817: Jane Austen dies, early in the morning, attended by her sister Cassandra.\n\n24 July 1817: Jane Austen is buried in Winchester Cathedral.\n\nJuly Beginnings and Endings\n\nIt’s interesting to note that Jane Austen moved to Chawton in July 1809 and passed away (in Winchester) in July 1817. Her years at Chawton Cottage are some of the most fruitful of all her writing career. From Jane Austen’s House Museum:\n\n1811: Sense and Sensibility published.\n\n1813: Pride and Prejudice published.\n\n1814: Mansfield Park published.\n\n1816: Emma published (December 1815).\n\n1815 – 1816: Jane writes The Elliots (later published as Persuasion).\n\nJanuary 1817: Jane begins The Brothers (later published as Sanditon), but she only completes the first twelve chapters.\n\nThough we wish Austen could have lived much longer, enjoyed her wonderful family, and written many more novels, it’s incredible to think that she was able to accomplish so much in just a few short years. I’m thankful that Austen enjoyed a season of joy and creativity at Chawton Cottage. She wrote happily there in the beloved Hampshire countryside of her youth.\n\nRACHEL DODGE teaches college English classes, gives talks at libraries, teas, and book clubs, and writes for Jane Austen’s World blog.

The tour was a rite of passage from the 17th through 19th centuries for the sons (and in a few cases, the daughters) of aristocrats, the wealthy gentry, and rising merchant classes. Some of the travelers were accompanied by their tutors for serious study, others led merry, somewhat debauched lives with friends. Most returned to their homeland 3 – 5 years later with a sense of continental sophistication. Perfecting their French was an accomplishment absolutely expected of the sophisticated, well-traveled Englishman or woman.\n\nIn her review of Masculinity and Danger on the Eighteenth-Century Grand Tour (2*), Michele Cohen mentions Stephen Conway’s reasoning – that the tour:\n\n“Encouraged a ‘specifically European outlook’, which included polish and refinement, appreciation of classical art and architecture, theatre, and music as well as continental cuisine, wine and fashion.”\n\nAusten’s connection to the grand tour was her brother Edward Austen Knight, who took several extended journeys. He wrote his memories in private journals. (The Grand Tour in the 18th & 19th Century | Jane Austen’s World.)\n\nCopies and molds of ancient gems that visitors collected and brought back:\n\nThroughout history, the marvelous gems and cameos cut in Ancient Greece and Rome were admired by collectors for their beauty and perfection. Many visitors who returned from their Grand Tour brought back fabulous paintings, sculptures, and a collection of impressions and casts made from those gems. Others, who were not as flush in the pocket, returned with more modest, portable souvenirs, such as trinkets, fans, and a few impressions and casts.\n\nTourists in Italy commissioned intaglios and cameos from numerous workshops as souvenirs of their travels:\n\n“…the demand was chiefly for technically accomplished, accurate copies, often difficult to distinguish from the originals, a feat made possible because the engravers had at hand collections of casts from well-known gems which made copying easy. Such casts, produced in quantity by moulding in materials such as wax and plaster of various kinds, had been circulating among connoisseurs and collectors for centuries in mid-i8th century Rome. Their manufacture in hard-wearing, red-dyed sulphur or white gesso became a major industry…” – The Grand Tourist’s favourite souvenirs: cameos and intaglios, Gertrud Seidmann (*3).\n\nMadame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV of France, was an influential patron of the arts and helped revive the ancient art of gem carving. She hired the best gem carver to live at Versailles and provided him with the finest tools. Then she asked him to teach her how to carve gems. (National Galleries Scotland.) In this portrait she “is depicted surrounded by a garland of flowers supported by three putti. Scattered at the base of the design are the symbolic attributes of the arts she so enthusiastically supported – painting, drawing, sculpture, architecture, writing and music.” – Google Arts and Culture\n\nThe following pair of casts are made in sulfur and sealing wax and are from a private 19th C collection. They are part of a much larger collection. (*1)\n\n“During the sixteenth century, ancient gems and cameos circulated widely among collectors, directly or by means of impressions and metal casts.” (*1, p120.)\n\nShared Knowledge\n\nAncient Carved Art Gems in 18th-Century Europe:\n\n“During the 18th century, the arts of Rome and Greece were discovered anew. With their simple linear grace, ancient carved gems in particular inspired artists, scholars, and collectors. Long part of royal or aristocratic collections, these tiny but enduring fragments of the distant past now sparked a popular craze…” – From an explanation near an art display of an Oak Cabinet, at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n“The 18th century saw the standardization and sharing of all kinds of knowledge…This oak cabinet is part of the same movement. Its carefully lettered drawers contain thousands of numbered red sulphur wax impressions or casts of ancient and modern carved gems created in the London shop of Scotsman James Tassie (1735-99)…[and] copied from collections around Europe, was the most comprehensive of its kind, numbering about 20,000 casts at the time of his death.” – From a wall plaque near an oak cabinet displaying James Tassie impressions and casts at the Walters Art Museum.\n\nClick on this link to see a Drawer of Gem Impressions and read a description about it. Their arrangement is typical of the thousands of gems that rest inside the drawers.\n\n[The] carved gems fall into two categories: intaglios and cameos. With intaglios, the design is carved down into the selected material, whereas with cameos, material is carved away so that the design projects upward from the surface. Glass paste copies of carved gems made by Tassie could be used as costume jewelry, seals, or mounted into frames to create innovative window displays.\n\nJames Tassie, 1735 – 1799. Sculptor and gem engraver | National Galleries of Scotland. Interestingly, Tassie and Allen went to art school together and later shared a house in London. Tassie then invented vitreous glass paste and used it to create small portrait medallions and reproductions of antique gems and cameos. His fame spread, and Catherine the Great became his most important patron. Listen to the Talk | by Liz Louis – The life and work of James Tassie on the National Galleries of Scotland site.\n\nSmaller collections in smaller cabinets\n\nNot all of the copies were made for large and elaborate collections, as shown in this Portrait of a Lady, painted in oil. (Walters Art Museum, 37.394, Acquired by Henry Walters.)\n\n“On the table in this portrait is a smaller cabinet of impressions of ancient carved gems than the larger cabinet. The unknown woman seems lost in thought…and is presented as scholarly (literate and interested in the Classical past), but also ladylike (fashionably dressed and bonded to a male relative or lover-shown by the miniature portrait pinned to her dress). The portrait can be dated to after 1793, as this is the year that saw the publication of the sheet music, seen rolled on the table, for Peter von Winter’s duet “Con quell occhietto languido non mi” (“With that little languid eye, not to me”).\n\nThe objects included in this portrait tell a story about the interests of the woman portrayed…”\n\n– Plaque near the portrait in the North Flanking Gallery, Walters Museum of Art.\n\nAbout the exhibit at the Walters Art Museum described in this post:\n\nThis exhibit in the north flanking galleries was taken down on July 3rd, 2024, and is no longer in view. In its place, a new installation, entitled Art of the Americas, will open in 2025. Some galleries featuring 19th C. art objects, mostly the Walter’s sevres porecelain collection, will still be available .\n\nFortuitously, I had made photos of the art objects and the wall signs, which are now taken down but are quoted in full. I’ve also linked directly to the museum’s website for a different description to provide you with a more rounded story.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n“Returning with a gem on one’s finger or with a precious collection, shipping back cabinets of casts – the later collections often miscellanies of Roman monuments, sculptures and paintings intermingled with gems, almost equivalent to modern photograph albums – was an inevitable part of the scene for the grandest as well as humbler visitors to Italy.” – (*3.)\n\nSources:\n\n*1 – The Grand Tour of Europe, (2023) Editor Franco Maria Ricci, 167 p.

Cox\n\n“In 1775, Cassandra Austen gave birth to her second daughter whom she named Jane. The same year Captain James Cook was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, in recognition of his achievements in reaching Botany Bay, claiming New South Wales for the British Government and landing on the islands of New Zealand. Cassandra and George Austen, gazing fondly at their new baby, could never have dreamed that one day their little girl’s name would be familiar and admired in those new British territories on the other side of the world.”—Jane Austen: Antipodean Views, by Susannah Fullerton and Anne Harbers Amazon UK link\n\nAntipodean Views goes on to tell us that Jane Austen certainly knew about Australia. Her brother mentioned Botany Bay in one of his published articles, and her aunt almost got transported there when she was accused of theft. The Exeter Exchange in London had a kangaroo, which Jane’s sister Cassandra probably saw. Austen never mentions Australia in her novels, but many “down under” love Jane today.\n\nWhen Susannah Fullerton, president of the Jane Austen Society of Australia, invited me to come speak to the JASA in Sydney, I thought, “It’s just too far!” From where I live in the eastern United States, it is quite a distance. Traveling from Atlanta to Sydney takes at least 20 hours, and can be more than 40 hours, depending on stops and layovers. The time change is 14 hours. (So noon on Monday in Atlanta is 2 AM on Tuesday in Sydney.) You cross the international dateline both going and coming back, so you lose a day going, and get it back when you return. So it’s a big commitment to go that far.\n\nI met Susannah at the 2022 AGM in Victoria, Canada, where she gave a wonderful talk on “The Many Duels of Sense and Sensibility,” even after she had traveled halfway around the world. (My favorite part was her discussion of Elinor and Lucy’s verbal duels.) Susannah also leads literary tours, taking groups from Australia (and elsewhere) to England, Europe, and North America. So I thought if she could do all that travel and still talk coherently, I could attempt it as well. I decided to take this wonderful opportunity to see a new part of the world.\n\nJane Austen enthusiasts down under are part of a network of Janeites stretching around the world. The JASNA (US and Canada) website lists Jane Austen Societies in the U.K., Australia (including groups in Adelaide and Melbourne as well as the main JASA), Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Chile, the Czech Republic, Denmark, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, and Spain. That list touches on five of the seven continents. (Any Jane Austen societies in Africa or Antarctica? Or other countries not listed here? Tell us!)\n\nTravels in Australia: Melbourne\n\nOn my recent trip, I got to meet with delightful Jane Austen lovers in both Australia and New Zealand. It was complicated coordinating with all their schedules. But in the end I had opportunities to share my talk, “Why Mr Collins?: The Church and Clergy in Jane Austen’s Novels,” with enthusiastic groups in five cities.\n\nMy husband and I started in Melbourne, where Dr. Alida Sewell and her husband kindly hosted us in their home for a week, giving us a chance to start getting over jetlag. Alida edits the bimonthly Newsletter of the Jane Austen Society of Melbourne, which includes book reviews and Austen-related news from around the world. Alida and I got in contact when she reviewed my book, Fashionable Goodness: Christianity in Jane Austen’s England, back in February of 2023, and she also encouraged me to visit.\n\nThe Jane Austen Society of Melbourne was founded more than thirty years ago, in 1993. On the day I spoke to the Melbourne group, we had a lovely lunch with the committee members before I got to share with 25 or so participants about Mr. Collins. After a lively discussion, some members took home signed copies of my book.\n\nIn every place we visited, my husband I went to see some of the unique wildlife of the country. Near Melbourne, we had the delightful experience of seeing hundreds of little penguins, blue and white penguins only 16 inches tall, waddling in from the sea in the evening. Alida also took us to the Moonlit Animal Sanctuary, where we could pet wallabies and kangaroos. We also met gorgeous Australian birds like the pink cockatoo, with its sunset colored crest , and the well-camouflaged tawny frogmouth.\n\nTravels in Australia: Brisbane\n\nFrom Melbourne we headed to Brisbane, where Barbara O’Rourke, a member of the local Jane Austen Society committee, generously ferried us around. I got to pet a koala bear at the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. We also saw lovely opals, the national gemstone of Australia, at the Brisbane Opal Museum. Australia still produces 95% of the world’s precious opals.\n\nI spoke to around 70 keen Janeites in Brisbane, and got to order extra books for them beyond the ones I had brought to sell (as I also did in Sydney and Wellington later on! I loved their enthusiasm). This is the twenty-second year of the Brisbane group, which has around a hundred members total. A committee of seven people lead them, each of those seven “doing what they do best,” so that all roles are covered.\n\nAt meetings the Brisbane branch of the Jane Austen Society of Australia offers a Regency Fair table. I saw a wide range of interesting-looking materials there. Members bring in Austen-related books and magazines they are finished reading. These are offered for sale at a low, nominal price, which goes to benefit the Society. Books may be donated back later, making it similar to a rotating library, but without anyone needing to keep track of loans and returns. Conversations often start up around the table, giving members opportunities to interact. I love this idea: recycling, networking, and giving everyone a chance to learn and enjoy more of Jane Austen!\n\nThe next week we visited friends on the “Sunshine Coast” north of Brisbane, enjoying more birds and wildlife, as well as a ginger factory where we learned about the production of ginger and honey.\n\nTravels in Australia: Sydney and Southern Highlands\n\nFinally we made it to Sydney, where the Taronga Zoo gave us a fantastic final look at Australia’s very special animals and birds, ranging from platypus and potoroo to giant emus and bright honeyeaters.\n\nFrom Sydney, Susannah Fullerton took us out to the Southern Highlands, where we saw a bit of Australia’s frontier culture, then met with another keen group of about twenty Janeites for lunch and my talk.\n\nJane Austen Society of Australia Day Conference on Jane Austen and the Church\n\nThat Saturday the JASA hosted an all-day conference on “Mr. Collins’ Profession: Jane Austen and the Church.” We began with my talk on Mr. Collins, which explores why Austen, a devout Anglican Christian, chose to portray Mr. Collins as she did, and what his life and challenges were as a clergyman at this time. Then we got to hear about other aspects of the church in Austen’s time, from excellent speakers.\n\nAnne Harbers, writer and art historian, showed us images of clergy from the time, and explained what those images show us. One that fascinated me was Rev. Humphry Gainsborough, the artist Gainsborough’s brother. He was the pastor of an Independent Chapel as well as an engineer and inventor. You may have one of his inventions on your front door—a lock with a chain, that allows the door to be partially opened. Rev. Gainsborough invented that type of lock for the gate of his parsonage in Henley, England.\n\nRoslyn Russell then told us about sermons and devotional literature in Austen’s novels, contrasting her perspective with later authors Anthony Trollope and Barbara Pym. I especially enjoyed meeting Roslyn since I enjoyed her novel, Maria Returns: Barbados to Mansfield Park, which gives Maria Bertram her own happy ending.\n\nWe got even deeper with Scott Stephens’ fascinating talk, “‘How could you be so unfeeling?’: Moral Encounter and its Counterfeits in Jane Austen’s Later Fiction.” He talked about moral encounters, and where deep ones occur in Austen’s novels (for example, on the tops of hills, or in letters), and where shallow counterfeits occur (such as in Bath).\n\nI had the privilege of finishing off a great day by giving a brief talk on “‘Her Parish and Her Poultry’: The Lives of Clergymen’s Wives in Austen’s World.” We explored the similarities and differences between the lives of clergymen’s wives and of gentry wives in the English countryside of Austen’s time.\n\nThe Jane Austen Society of Australia, founded in 1989, has over 500 members. Its regular meetings (not AGMs) are the largest of any Jane Austen Society in the world, averaging around 130 people per meeting. Participants at the Day Conference came from Sydney (where the meeting was held), Melbourne, Canberra, Queensland, and all over New South Wales.\n\nJASA publishes a yearly Chronicle of news and reports, twice-yearly newsheets called Practicalities, and a yearly journal of scholarly papers called Sensibilities. This year’s Sensibilities will include articles based on the talks at the Day Conference, among others. I look forward to reading them, since there’s so much more I could glean!\n\nOn Sunday we got to see a bit of Sydney, worshiping at lovely St. Andrew’s Anglican Cathedral, founded in 1819, soon after Austen’s death. Building on its long history, the church seems to be vibrant and lively today. Placards around the church gave summaries of the Christian message in many languages, for this multicultural city.\n\nAfter lunch and birdwatching in the park, we visited the Hyde Park Barracks, which originally held transported convicts, then women immigrants. The museum gave us impressions of some of Australia’s tumultuous history, including the tragic impact on Aboriginal communities.\n\nTravels in New Zealand: Wellington and Beyond\n\nThe next day we flew to New Zealand, which is not as close as one might imagine! We saw yellow-eyed penguins, a blue whale, and royal albatrosses in Dunedin, a city with a Scottish flavor on New Zealand’s South Island. On the North Island we visited hobbit homes in Hobbiton (definitely a highlight of the trip); saw amazing geothermal formations and baby kiwis in Rotorua, and toured a Maori village; and marveled at a cave full of glowworms in Waitomo.\n\nOur Jane Austen encounter was in Wellington, New Zealand. We could see Wellington’s literary and cultural associations immediately. The airport has statues of Gandalf on an eagle, a dragon, and a Doctor Who police box! Frances Duncan, who founded and runs the Jane Austen Society of New Zealand, met us at the airport with Sian Farr, who kindly hosted us in her home and showed us some sights.\n\nIn Wellington, an eager group of Janeites met with me to discuss Mr. Collins, Jane Austen, and the church. We had a delicious tea, and afterwards they asked great questions. Frances Duncan started the Jane Austen Society of Aotearoa New Zealand just ten years ago, and it has been growing. About 25 people attended the meeting. I hope it spreads to many corners of the beautiful country of New Zealand, across the mountains and along the sea. Contact Frances through their website if you want to start up a Jane Austen group elsewhere in the country.\n\nWe enjoyed many of the fascinating birds of New Zealand. My favorite place in Wellington was Zealandia. This nature preserve in the city has specially designed fences to keep out the many non-native predators which have decimated the country’s unique native birds. Now kiwi and other birds are thriving in the preserve and surrounding areas.\n\nI was impressed by the extensive environmental efforts in both Australia and New Zealand, and the strides they are making toward preserving their incomparable native creatures.\n\nWhat would Jane Austen have thought about bird and animal conservation, if she lived today? We don’t know, of course. But she does mention animals in her novels, and, as a country clergyman’s daughter, she essentially lived on a farm. Her brother James wrote a poem praising clergyman Gilbert White, who lived near Chawton. White is considered the father of modern ecology because of his book, The Natural History of Selborne.\n\nSo I’d like to think Jane Austen would have enjoyed a journey like ours, enjoying the natural world. And I hope our great discussions of her novels and the church in her world would have met her approval as well! I certainly loved meeting so many wonderful people who love Jane Austen as I do.\n\nAre you a Janeite living “down under”? Tell us where you live, and how you celebrate Jane Austen! And if you are looking for kindred spirits, contact the JASA to find other regional groups.\n\nBrenda S. Cox is the author of Fashionable Goodness: Christianity in Jane Austen’s England. She also blogs at Faith, Science, Joy, and Jane Austen.\n\nFrom her birth in 1775 until her family moved to Bath in 1801, Jane Austen spent most of her time in a small triangle of villages: Steventon, Ashe, and Deane. Her father was rector of both Steventon and Deane, leading services and preaching at both parish churches, and serving the people of both communities.\n\nDeane Parsonage and Living\n\nGeorge and Cassandra Austen lived in the Deane parsonage until 1768 when the Steventon parsonage was ready. Their first three children, James, George, and Edward, were born there. Mrs. Austen’s widowed mother, Jane Leigh, also lived with them at Deane, though she died shortly after the move to Steventon.\n\nThe Steventon living was worth only about £100 a year, including about three acres of glebe farmland. So Mr. Knight also let George Austen farm the 200-acre Cheesedown Farm for more income. Still, the Austens found the income too low to support their rapidly growing family. George’s great-uncle Francis of Sevenoaks in Kent bought the options on two nearby livings, Ashe and Deane, for George’s benefit.\n\nThe rector of Deane died before the rector of Ashe, so George Austen took the living for the parish of Deane, and Francis sold the other option to another relative, who later installed the Lefroys at Ashe. In 1773, Mr. Austen became rector of Deane, another small parish of “about two dozen families of farm labourers . . . worth £110” per year (Le Faye, 25). He also began taking in boys as students, to further supplement his income.\n\nThe Deane parsonage now belonged to George Austen, as part of the living. From 1786-1788, Madam Lefroy’s younger brother, Egerton Brydges, rented it from him and lived there. In 1789, George advertised the parsonage for rent, as “a neat brick dwelling-house with four living-rooms and four bedrooms, as well as all the necessary store rooms and servants’ quarter, plus a large garden, coach-house and stabling for six horses” (Le Faye, 68), making it sound more desirable than it had been. The next tenants were a clergyman’s widow, Mrs. Lloyd, and her daughters Martha and Mary. (Good Bible names for sisters; see John 11.) Martha and Mary soon became close friends of Jane and her sister Cassandra. Eventually both Lloyd sisters married into the Austen family.\n\nIn 1792, Jane’s eldest brother James and his wife Anne took over Deane parsonage, spending £200 to refurnish it, more than they could actually afford. James became his father’s curate at Deane, also serving two other small parishes. Their daughter Anna (Jane Anna Elizabeth Austen) was born in the Deane parsonage in 1793, with the help of her grandmother. “Mrs. Austen rose from her bed in the middle of the night, and walked by the light of a lantern a mile and a half of muddy country lane to attend her [daughter-in-law], and to usher into the world a new grandchild” (Le Faye, 84).\n\nJames’s wife Anne died in 1795, and Mary Lloyd returned to Deane parsonage as James’s second wife in 1797. In 1801, James and his family moved to the Steventon parsonage when George Austen retired to Bath. James served as curate of Steventon until his father died in 1805, when James became rector of Steventon.\n\nJane Austen’s Connections with Deane\n\nJane Austen mentions Deane in 27 of her existing letters. She also includes it in one of her juvenile pieces, “Memoirs of Mr. Clifford.” Mr. Clifford’s “first Day’s Journey carried him only to Dean Gate where he remained a few Days and found himself much benefited by the change of Air.” She is referring to the Deane Gate Inn, where men of the Austen family would catch the stagecoach. It is now a restaurant, the Palm Brasserie.\n\nJane often visited the parsonage at Deane, first when the Lloyds were living there, then when her brother and his family were there. Dampness and flooding were still an issue. On Oct. 27, 1798, she wrote:\n\n“There has been a great deal of rain here for this last fortnight, much more than in Kent, and indeed we found the roads all the way from Staines most disgracefully dirty. Steventon lane has its full share of it, and I don’t know when I shall be able to get to Deane.”\n\nIn November and December she again talks about visits to her sister-in-law Mary at Deane, who gave birth to James Edward (who became Jane Austen’s first biographer) on Nov. 17:\n\nI went to Deane with my father two days ago to see Mary, who is still plagued with the rheumatism, which she would be very glad to get rid of, and still more glad to get rid of her child, of whom she is heartily tired. Her nurse is come and has no particular charm either of person or manner; but as all the Hurstbourne world pronounce her to be the best nurse that ever was, Mary expects her attachment to increase. . . . Sunday. — I have just received a note from James to say that Mary was brought to bed last night, at eleven o’clock, of a fine little boy, and that everything is going on very well. My mother had desired to know nothing of it before it should be all over, and we were clever enough to prevent her having any suspicion of it”—Nov. 17-18, 1798\n\nJane continued to visit Mary every few days, reporting on her health. She even visited when ice covered the ground:\n\n“I enjoyed the hard black Frosts of last week very much, & one day while they lasted walked to Deane by myself.–I do not know that I ever did such a thing in my life before. . . . Mary went to Church on Sunday, & had the weather been smiling, we would have seen her here before this time”—Dec. 18, 1798. This may have been when Mary was “churched,” a ceremony celebrating the safety of a mother after childbirth.\n\nThe main families of Deane, Steventon, and Ashe all visited each other and went to balls together. Jane danced at the Harwoods’ ball, in Deane, on Jan. 8, 1796. She often mentions John Harwood in her letters; for example:\n\n“This morning has been made very gay to us, by visits from our two lively Neighbours, Mr. Holder and Mr. John Harwood.”—Dec. 18, 1798\n\nAll Saints Church at Deane, Then and Now\n\nIn July, 1818, the Norman-era church at Deane was “in so Dangerous a state of Ruin as to be unsafe for the congregation.” So the patron, Wither Bramston of Oakley Hall, got approval from the Bishop of Winchester to rebuild it at his own cost, about £8000. It was consecrated two years later.\n\nAll Saints at Deane is considered “one of the most complete and successful” 19th century Gothic churches (Tanner). It is also renowned for its eight bells, which are rung regularly, and an 1820 Gothic chancel screen. The church today is a grade II listed building, but is not the same as the medieval church building where George and James Austen ministered. Some monuments from their time are on the walls of the current church, however.\n\nThe church could seat 146 people in 1851. On Census Sunday, 94 parishioners attended in the morning and 124 in the evening. Leading up to World War I, the rector offered daily Communion in the church, and in 1917, he reported twenty people in the choir for Evensong. However, the population dropped, and in 2011, Deane included only an estimated 55 inhabitants, with an average age of over 60.\n\nNow there are about 25 houses in the village, and about 8-10 people attend Sunday morning services twice a month. For a larger service, like the Christmas carol service, they may have about 40 attendees. Weddings are held there occasionally, and special services like pet blessings. All Saints is part of the United Benefice of North Waltham, Steventon, Ashe, and Deane.\n\nOur guide to the church, Sue Hebeler, said she loves this church since it is her local church and her husband is buried there. She appreciates the traditional, old-fashioned services. If you’re in the vicinity, you may also enjoy a visit to this lovely, peaceful church.\n\nAll images in this post ©Brenda S.

Though Jenner’s books can be read as stand-alone stories, they each tie to the others.\n\nThis time, we follow actress and playwright Vivien Lowry, one of the original (fictional) members of the Jane Austen Society, to 1950s, post-war Italy to pursue her film career.\n\nBook Details\n\nThe bestselling author of The Jane Austen Society and Bloomsbury Girls returns with a brilliant novel of love and art, of grief and memory, of confronting the past and facing the future.\n\nIn 1955, Vivien Lowry is facing the greatest challenge of her life. Her latest play, the only female-authored play on the London stage that season, has opened in the West End to rapturous applause from the audience. The reviewers, however, are not as impressed as the playgoers and their savage notices not only shut down the play but ruin Lowry’s last chance for a dramatic career.\n\nWith her future in London not looking bright, at the suggestion of her friend, Peggy Guggenheim, Vivien takes a job in as a script doctor on a major film shooting in Rome’s Cinecitta Studios. There she finds a vibrant movie making scene filled with rising stars, acclaimed directors, and famous actors in a country that is torn between its past and its potentially bright future, between the liberation of the post-war cinema and the restrictions of the Catholic Church that permeates the very soul of Italy.\n\nAs Vivien tries to forge a new future for herself, she also must face the long-buried truth of the recent World War and the mystery of what really happened to her deceased fiancé. Every Time We Say Goodbye is a brilliant exploration of trauma and tragedy, hope and renewal, filled with dazzling characters both real and imaginary, from the incomparable author who charmed the world with her novels The Jane Austen Society and Bloomsbury Girls.\n\nAudiobook\n\nIf you prefer listening to your historical fiction, BAFTA Award-winning actress Juliet Aubrey has narrated the audiobook of Every Time We Say Goodbye.\n\n“Aubrey won the BAFTA for her performance as the quintessential Dorothea Brooke in the BBC’s 1994 production of Middlemarch and has appeared in dozens of television, film, stage, and radio programs over her impressive career, most recently winning the BBC Audio Drama Award for Best Actress in 2022.

Cox\n\n“Madam” Anne Lefroy\n\nAnne Lefroy, a dear friend of young Jane Austen, lived about two and a half miles north of Steventon, in the village of Ashe. Wealthy Benjamin Langlois was patron of the parish church, and he gave the living of Ashe to his nephew, Reverend Isaac Peter George Lefroy (called George) in 1783, when Jane was eight years old. At that time the church was called St. Andrew’s, and Ashe was spelled Ash.\n\nRev. Lefroy’s wife was Anne Lefroy, cultured, educated, and hospitable. She wrote poetry, and had two witty poems published before her marriage. Because of her sophistication and hospitality, in the neighbourhood she was “known affectionately and respectfully” as Madam Lefroy. Mrs. Lefroy was 25 years older than Jane. So how did they become friends? According to information sheets at the church,\n\n“Anne Lefroy and Jane Austen, despite their age difference, formed a close friendship that started when the Lefroys invited the 11-year-old Jane to play with their 7-year-old daughter. Due to a mutual love of literature, Anne and Jane are believed to have had long literary discussions. Jane was allowed access to the extensive library of the Ashe rectory. Jane may also have shared her writing with Anne who, some have suggested, acted as a surrogate parent. This must have acted as an important source of support for Jane in her early years of writing.”\n\nThis is speculative. But Mrs. Lefroy is often mentioned in Jane Austen’s letters. Jane frequently visited the Lefroys’ parsonage and attended dances and parties there and at the local squire’s house, Ashe Park.\n\nTom Lefroy\n\nFamously, Jane danced and flirted with George Lefroy’s nephew from Ireland, Tom Lefroy, when he came for a visit in 1796. She wrote to Cassandra, “Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together” (Jan. 9, 1796). A week later, on January 15, she wrote, “At length the Day is come on which I am to flirt my last with Tom Lefroy. . . . My tears flow as I write, at the melancholy idea.” She immediately starts another topic and we don’t know if she was joking or serious. She may have hoped to marry Tom, but a proposal never came.\n\nIt’s been speculated that Rev. and Mrs. Lefroy sent him away, since he needed to marry someone with more money than the Austens had. Or Tom himself may have decided to leave, and the Lefroys were disappointed in him for flirting and not following through. Jane said Tom was “laughed at” at Ashe because of her, so it might have all been teasing, not serious. In any case, Jane does not seem to have held the outcome against Tom or against Mrs. Lefroy. After all, as she wrote in Pride and Prejudice, “Handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”\n\n(Tom Lefroy, by the way, pursued a legal career and became a chief justice of Ireland. His son Jeffrey became a churchman, dean of Dromore Cathedral in Ireland, and Tom’s grandson George Alfred Lefroy became an Anglican clergyman and a missionary to India, then Bishop of Lahore and Calcutta. He is remembered for opposing western racism toward Indians.)\n\nMrs. Lefroy apparently tried to set Jane up later with another friend, the Reverend Samual Blackall, who Jane later called “a piece of . . . noisy perfection . . . which I always recollect with regard.” But nothing came of that, either.\n\nJane Austen’s Poem\n\nThe strongest testimony of Jane’s attachment to Mrs. Lefroy is a poem Jane wrote to her in 1808. Four years earlier, Mrs. Lefroy had been thrown from her horse and died on Jane’s birthday, December 16.\n\nIn the poem, Jane calls Mrs. Lefroy “beloved friend,” and says the reminder of her death is a “bitter pang of torturing Memory.” She describes her:\n\nAngelic Woman! past my power to praise\n\nIn Language meet, thy Talents, Temper, Mind.\n\nThy solid Worth, thy captivating Grace! –\n\nThou friend and ornament of Humankind! –\n\nShe says Mrs. Lefroy was unequalled, angelic, “with all her smiles benign, Her looks of eager Love, her accents sweet.” She spoke with “sense, . . . Genius, Taste, & Tenderness of soul.”\n\nJane also praises Mrs. Lefroy’s religious principles:\n\n“She speaks; ’tis Eloquence–that grace of Tongue\n\nSo rare, so lovely! – Never misapplied\n\nBy her to palliate Vice, or deck a Wrong,\n\nShe speaks and reasons but on Virtue’s side.\n\nHers is the Energy of Soul sincere.\n\nHer Christian Spirit, ignorant to feign,\n\nSeeks but to comfort, heal, enlighten, chear,\n\nConfer a pleasure, or prevent a pain. –\n\nCan ought enhance such Goodness? – Yes, to me,\n\nHer partial favour from my earliest years\n\nConsummates all. – Ah! Give me yet to see\n\nHer smile of Love. – the Vision disappears.\n\nAnd Jane says she hopes to meet her again in heaven.\n\nMrs. Lefroy as a Clergyman’s Wife\n\nInterestingly, Jane’s tribute is similar to Mrs. Lefroy’s obituary. One section says:\n\n“Her religion predominated over all her excellencies, and influenced and exalted every expression and action of her life. How amiable and angelic she was in the domestic duties of daughter, wife, mother, and sister, . . . She has left a chasm in society. . . . Above all, the poor will receive this afflicting dispensation of Providence with the keenest sorrow and lamentation: she fed, she cloathed, she instructed them, with daily and never-ceasing attention; in grief she soothed them by her conversation and her kind looks; and in sickness, she comforted them by medicines and advice. . . .”\n\nMrs. Lefroy was very attached to her children, as we see in her letters to her son Christopher Edward. They have been published by the Jane Austen Society. Mrs. Lefroy ran a school from her home. She said teaching other children helped her to not miss her own children so much when they were away at school. She taught poor children to read and write and gave them practical skills to help them support themselves.\n\nLike most clergy wives, she was also involved in medicating her parish as needed, but she took that a huge step further. Smallpox was a great killer in those days. When Mrs. Lefroy learned about the brand-new system of vaccination, she investigated and determined it was beneficial. Then she learned to do it herself, and vaccinated her own family and over 800 poor people, giving them protection from smallpox. The obituary concludes, “Thus she seemed like a ministering Angel, going about to dispense unmingled good in the world.”\n\nAshe Church Memorials to the Lefroy Family\n\nWhile most of the Ashe church is Victorian, a number of memorials remain from Austen’s time. Her Lefroy friends are all buried there.\n\nThe memorial to George and Anne Lefroy is very hard to read now, but a page in the church gives the text. The facts of their deaths are followed by:\n\n“Reader: The characters here recorded need no laboured panegyric; prompted by the elevate dictates of Christianity, of whose glorious truths they are most firm believers, they were alike exemplary in the performance of every duty, and amicable in every relationship of life; to their fervent piety their strict integrity, their active and comprehensive charity, and in short to the lovely and useful tenor of their whole lives and conversations those amongst us who they lived, and especially the inhabitants of this parish, will bear ample and ready testimony, after a union of 26 years, having been separated by death scarcely more than 12 months, their earthy remains are together deposited in peace near this marble. Together be raised. We humbly trust in glory when the grave shall give up her dead, and death itself be swallowed up in Victory\n\nRev. 14 v. 13\n\nBlessed are the dead, which die in the Lord, even so saith the spirit for they rest from their labours.”\n\nWilliam Thomas Lefroy was only three years old when he “Died Alas!” as the plaque says. His brother Anthony Brydges Lefroy was fifteen when he died of an enlarged heart; they speculated it was the result of him falling from a horse two years earlier and not being bled by the doctor. Anne may have written the poem commemorating her son: “Such patient sweetness, such untainted youth, such early piety, and spotless truth; were lent a few short years to point the way; to heaven’s blessed courts, realms of endless day.” The plaque also commemorates their brother Christopher Edward, recipient of Anne’s letters, who lived to the ripe age of 71.\n\nThe memorial to their son John Henry, the next rector of Ashe, focuses a great deal on his parents, George and Anne, who apparently taught him well: [brackets added]\n\n“Heir to the same glorious hopes, he pursued with undeviating fidelity the example of his parents, whose characters are recorded on the adjacent marble. Distrustful alike of clamourous profession [religious ‘enthusiasm’] and philosophical liberality [Deism], he daily sought, with anxious singleness of eye [focus], amidst the tumult of religious opinions, the narrow practical way of Christianity. Imbued from his infancy with the deepest reverence for the benignant [kind, good] character and divine authority of Christ, the spirit of Christianity pervaded his whole walk and conversation; in all the relations of son, brother, husband, father, as a minister, a magistrate, a man, his constant affection, his earnest benevolence, his scrupulous integrity were equally conspicuous; utterly rejecting at the same time, all presumptuous dependence on his own merits, his humble and only confidence in death, as through life, was in the one full perfect, and sufficient sacrifice of his saviour upon the cross, for the sins of the whole world. Having, thus, maintained through life, his parents character, and died in his parents faith, here, at the early age of forty one, he reposes in his parents grave, having left a widow and eleven children to cultivate the memory of his excellence, exert themselves to follow his footsteps, and deplore their irreparable loss.”\n\nWow! I don’t know who wrote that, but this was an impressive family.\n\nJohn Henry’s brother Benjamin Lefroy married Jane’s beloved niece Anna Austen (daughter of Jane’s clergyman brother James). Benjamin followed John Henry as the next rector, for only four more years until he died in 1829, age 38. A poem recalling Christ’s resurrection commemorates Ben Lefroy’s life, and the life of his wife Anna, who died near Reading in 1872, age 79.\n\n“When by a good man’s grave I muse alone,\n\nMethinks an angel sits upon the stone;\n\nLike those of old on that thrice-hallowed night.\n\nWho sate and watched in raiment heavenly bright,\n\nAnd, with a voice inspiring joy, not fear,\n\nSays, pointing upward, that he is not here.”\n\nHoly Trinity and St. Andrew’s Church, Ashe, Today\n\nThere has been a church in Ashe since Norman times. In 1851, during the only Religious Census taken in England, the church had a seating capacity of 140. Their attendance at the morning service that Sunday was 98, and at the afternoon service, 120.\n\nHowever, like many English rural parishes today, the area is now mostly farmland with only about 100 residents in the parish. About 10-15 people attend the church’s Sunday services twice a month. Of course they can attend other churches nearby on the alternate Sundays. Ashe is in a combined benefice with Steventon, Deane, and North Waltham, and they sometimes combine events with the adjoining benefice of Overton. Special services bring in more people; Ashe may fill the church with 140 worshipers at Christmas. They occasionally host weddings; special services, including one for blessing pets; and other events.\n\nFiona Price, our guide to the church, said she and her young grandson love the peace and tranquility of the place. Holy Trinity and St. Andrew’s Church at Ashe is an interesting church to visit, near Steventon. It would have been about an hour’s walk away for Jane Austen.\n\nAll images in this post ©Brenda S.

Samuel Cooke\n\nInquiring Readers, In early March, I reviewed Gillian Dooley’s book, She played and sang: Jane Austen and music, published by Manchester University Press. While I knew some information about the Austen family’s collection of music books from the Internet Archive and several JASNA articles, none were as comprehensive as Dr. Dooley’s book. Her book now sits proudly on my library shelves in the Jane Austen section, where It will be used often as reference material. I still had a few questions, which Dr. Dooley was kind enough to answer.\n\nQ & A With Dr Gillian Dooley:\n\nQuestion #1:\n\nFirst, I want to thank you for writing this highly informative book. Almost all of the information contained in it is new to me. It’s obvious in Austen’s letters and novels that she loved music. I’m not a musician and sing off key, but I do love listening to classical music, especially from the late 18th and early 19th centuries– Haydn, Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven– and attending music concerts. I’ve read that the Austen family, like so many of their peers, read books out loud to each other when families gathered in the evening. They also played music and sang at home, with Austen playing the piano for her younger nieces and nephews as they danced. In her day, what were the connections, if any, between the music Austen collected and the stories in her novels?\n\nDooley:\n\nThanks for your interest in my book! I do discuss some possible links between her music collection and her writings, specifically in the juvenilia – where she often parodies the sentimental love songs of the time – and in Sense and Sensibility, where the plot has some structural similarities with a ballad named ‘Colin and Lucy’, of which she owned a copy. I don’t think that there are many direct or obvious connections, though. She rarely refers to an identifiable piece of music – ‘Robin Adair’ in Emma is the only explicit allusion and there are interesting emblematic resonances between that song and the plot. There are some other allusions to song texts in the novels that her contemporary readers might have noticed, but most of those songs are not in her music collection. I think they would have been common knowledge at the time, but we don’t necessarily recognize them now.\n\nOn the other hand, it would be possible to take almost any love song and find parallels in her novels, mainly because the narrative of most love stories includes roughly the same series of events: a meeting, getting acquainted, facing difficulties, and finally the happy ending. I guess what I’m saying is that what’s enduring and engaging about Austen’s novels is not their plots, but her use of language, her narrative voice, and her depiction of character. And I do think these aspects might be influenced by the fact that she was a musician. The rhythm of her language can be very musical, and in the songs she sang she would often have been acting the part of a character, or, in a way, embodying a character who might be quite different to herself.\n\nQuestion #2:\n\nCan you describe some of the pieces she copied that were her favorites? I’m struck at how few of the composers in Appendix 2 are familiar to me.\n\nDooley:\n\nAppendix 2 of my book lists the pieces of music that Austen copied herself by hand. She also owned some printed scores that she might have bought or been given. Her music collection includes both piano music and songs. I spend some time in my book surveying the handwritten pieces because it seems to make sense that, having invested the time in making copies, they might the ones she liked most. But that’s only a guess and isn’t supported by her niece Caroline’s memories of hearing her sing in her last years ‘when she had nearly left off singing’: only one of the four songs she mentions is among the manuscripts.\n\nThese four songs are all in their way love songs. Two are Scottish songs, ‘Their Groves of Sweet Myrtle’ – which has words by Robert Burns – and ‘The Yellow-Haired Laddie’. Another song, in French, tells a sad story about swallows being separated and dying of love. And the fourth is from the English theatre – quite a sardonic song in its way, about a wife whose husband is leaving her. So though they share a sense of drama, they are all different in mood and character, and the singer has to interpret the songs through the character.\n\nAnd as you say, not many of the composers are well known today. I have discovered several new favourite composers in the course of my research, including Stephen Storace, Giovanni Paisiello, François Devienne, and James Hook.\n\nQuestion #3\n\nI attend performances monthly given by our local chamber orchestra. The next performance will include Mozart’s Violin Concerto No 1 in B-Flat Major K. 207 (1773), written before Austen’s birth. It is divided into three movements– Allegro moderato, Adagio, and Presto. I understand that these three tempos indicate mood and expression. I’m struck that Austen’s novels are written in three parts. How do the divisions in music tempo relate to the pacing of her stories, or am I off base?\n\nDooley:\n\nThat’s an interesting thought! Form is important in any work of art, and especially in that era, most artists worked within various standard forms. For example, in music there is the da capo aria, and sonata form (made up of exposition – development – recapitulation), or theme and variations, or rondo – and, as you say, on a more macro level the 3-movement concerto or sonata. In poetry there were various standard metres and verse forms, e.g. the sonnet. Novels were usually in three volumes.\n\nThe Romantic movement pushed against some of these forms but they were remarkably persistent for a long time. Mozart and Haydn wrote amazing and idiosyncratic music, but it stayed mostly within these constraints. And Austen worked mainly within the form of the comic novel. There’s a very interesting book by Robert K. Wallace, Jane Austen and Mozart: Classical Equilibrium in Fiction and Music (Georgia UP, 1983), that compares Austen’s novels and Mozart’s concertos in detail.\n\nI think there is an enduring rhetorical significance in the number three. And if you think of the way a novel like Pride and Prejudice divides into three parts, an argument could probably be made that the moods and tempi of the classical musical forms map approximately onto the structure of the novel. But only approximately.\n\nThank you so much for this informative discussion! Please feel free to add any information you’d like our readers to know.\n\nDooley:\n\nMy book is based on the Austen Family Music Books, which is a collection of about 20 albums of music, printed and manuscript, that belonged to various members of the Austen family circle – all female – around the time of Jane Austen’s life, from her teacher, Ann Cawley, to some of her nieces. I concentrated mainly on the books that belonged to her, especially the ones in her own handwriting, but I also look at her relationships with the owners of the other books. They contain a variety of music, both instrumental and vocal, and give an interesting snapshot of the music that was popular at the time for playing at home. There’s more information, including links to collection online, plus some scores I have transcribed and some live recordings I’ve done over the years, at my Jane Austen’s Music website .\n\nAdditional information:\n\nFlinders University: Find Dr Dooley’s university profile on this page.\n\nThe University of Edinburgh –\n\nJane Austen and Scottish Music – “Jane Austen’s surviving music collection includes many songs that are either genuinely Scottish or reflect the fashion for Scottish music in England in her time. In this program a selection of these melodies is presented, either as songs or piano variations, and some links with her novels are suggested.” (Note: Tickets are on sale for a July 22 concert. Gillian Dooley (soprano) and Judith Gore (piano) present ‘Scotch’ and ‘Irish’ Airs from Jane Austen’s collection.)\n\nProject Title: Music culture in Britain in the late Georgian period (1770-1820) as reflected in Jane Austen’s writings and music collection of the Austen family.\n\nSynopsis of project proposal:\n\nIn my forthcoming book “She Played and Sang: Jane Austen and Music” (Manchester University Press), I include a survey of British song in Austen’s surviving music collection, digitized by Southampton University Library, and in her fiction. So-called ‘Scotch airs’ were enormously popular during Austen’s lifetime. Given Austen’s well-known Jacobite sympathies, it is not surprising that she felt no impulse to resist this musical tide from the north. Her music collection shows that she was drawn to Scottish music, and two of the four songs her young relatives remember her singing in her later years were Scottish: ‘Their groves of sweet myrtle’ and ‘The yellow-haired laddie’ – the other two being respectively French, and English (by an Irish composer). Roger Fiske proposes that one of the reasons for the popularity of Scottish songs was ‘the piquancy of their Scots characteristics’. Other political or ideological reasons might be adduced, but these characteristics do set them apart from the common run of pastoral love songs and help to explain their attraction for Austen. – Enter the site to read the rest of the project description\n\nListen to/See the Music:\n\nSOUNDCLOUD\n\nGillian Dooley: 75 tracks, that include:\n\nAngels ever bright and fair – Handel\n\nIf grief has any power to kill – Henry Purcell\n\nColin and Lucy – Tommaso Giordani\n\nJane Austen – The French Connection\n\nAnd more!\n\nGillian Dooley’s YouTube Channel\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjjtLkqzNMbet3nQ0bgLaHQ\n\nJane Austen: 13 videos in this folder\n\n.\n\nTheir Groves of Sweet Myrtle\n\nThe Yellow Haired Laddie, instrumental\n\nWords to the song\n\nBook Reviews and the author’s published articles\n\nMusic and Class in Jane Austen » JASNA\n\nJane Austen: The Musician as Author, MDPI\n\nReviews of She Played and Sang\n\nInterlude: Review of She Played and Sang – Jane Austen and Music, By Gillian Dooley, Frances Wilson, March 7, 2024\n\nGoodReads Review – 5 stars\n\nIn Addition:\n\nThe Edinburgh Companion to Jane Austen and the Arts, Edited by Joe Bray, Hannah Moss, Edinburgh University Press\n\nA Review by Brenda S. Cox\n\nThe idea suddenly came to Mrs. Breckyn Wood that JASNA needed a podcast. Breckyn says,\n\n“My main goal is to attract a whole new generation of JASNA members–younger Jane Austen fans who maybe have read a book or two or seen one of the adaptations, but who didn’t know there was a whole organization dedicated to Austen. I had already been to a few meetings of my local Georgia Region and was blown away by the talent and intelligence of its members, so I knew JASNA would have a huge pool of potential podcast guests from which to draw.”\n\nBeing a young lady of ingenuity and determination, she came up with a plan and presented it to the leaders of JASNA, who gave their complete support for Austen Chat. This delightful podcast began in July, 2023, with new episodes released on the first Thursday of each month. As the Austen Chat website says:\n\n“JASNA’s mission is at the heart of Austen Chat—to further the study, appreciation, and understanding of Jane Austen’s works, life, and genius. There is always more to learn and enjoy about Jane, and we invite you to join us for the ride! Each month we talk with scholars, authors, and subject experts on a wide variety of Austen-related topics. We think you’ll have fun and learn something new from every episode—whether you are a lifelong reader, an Austen newbie, a seasoned Austen scholar, or somewhere in between. Tune in each month to enjoy the company of clever, well-informed guests, who have a great deal of conversation!”\n\nI have listened to the first nine episodes (through March 7, 2024) and loved them all. I learned new things from each expert, despite my years of studying Austen.\n\nIn each instalment, Breckyn interviews someone in the Austen world about their specialty. Then we have news for the JASNA community about upcoming events and resources. Finally, a Janeite shares one of his or her favorite quotes from Austen, and tells why they love it. So be sure to listen all the way to the end!\n\nHere’s what we’ve gotten to enjoy so far:\n\nEpisode 1, Jane Austen & Her House: A Visit with Lizzie Dunford, brings us right to the Jane Austen House in Chawton. We learn about its background, the changes that have been going on, and the treasures on display in this Mecca for Janeites.\n\nEpisode 2, Jane Austen & Goodness: A Visit with Brenda Cox, is my own discussion with Breckyn about how Austen’s faith and the Church of England are reflected in Austen’s novels, including some hidden “faith words” used with religious meanings, women church leaders of Austen’s time, and the differences between rectors, vicars, and curates.\n\nEpisode 3, Jane Austen & Her Wardrobe: A Visit with Hilary Davidson, is a fun discussion of the clothes Jane Austen is known to have worn. I learned that Austen kept up with the latest fashions. Davidson tells us that in general it was easy to find relevant pictures of the types of clothing Austen mentioned in her letters, since they were what was popularly worn in those years.\n\nEpisode 4, Jane Austen & Her Endings: A Visit with Inger Brodey, gives some surprising insights into the endings of Austen’s books. She talks about whether the novels end happily or not, the different kinds of happiness, and how Austen’s endings were unusual for her time.\n\nEpisode 5, Jane Austen & Divorce: A Visit with James Nagle, tells us some suprising facts about ways people got divorced or separated in Austen’s time, including the practice of selling wives, which he says was often to the wife’s lover.\n\nEpisode 6, Jane Austen & Mr. Wickham, A Visit with Adrian Lukis, explores Lukis’s experiences in portraying Wickham in the 1995 Pride and Prejudice movie, then what led him to write his current hit, Being Mr. Wickham, and his thoughts on Lydia and Wickham’s later lives.\n\nEpisode 7, Jane Austen & Dido Belle, A Visit with Renata Dennis, gives us some insights from the head of JASNA’s Diversity Committee about mixed-race Dido Belle, her life, family, and connections with Jane Austen and Sanditon.\n\nEpisode 8, Jane Austen & Food: A Visit with Julienne Gehrer, discusses Martha Lloyd, the friend who lived with Jane, Cassandra, and Mrs. Austen, and her Commonplace Book and recipes.\n\nEpisode 9, Jane Austen & Her Genius: A Visit with Juliet McMaster, explores some facets of Austen’s brilliance in each of the novels and the Juvenilia. For example, McMaster compares Henry Tilney to Henry Higgins; both taught the heroine a new “language.” And she considers which heroes learned from the heroines, as well as which heroine learned from the hero. Juliet McMaster, a founding member of JASNA and “grande dame of Austen scholarship,” also talks about the early days of JASNA.\n\nThis is a great array of topics, all of which I enjoyed. I don’t know what’s coming next, but I’m sure it will be fun!\n\nEpisodes begin with a “desert island” question for the interviewee. Either:\n\nIf you were stranded on a desert island and could only have one Austen book, which one would it be? Or,\n\nIf you were stranded on a desert island and could have one penpal from among Austen’s characters, who would it be?\n\nGentle reader, what is your answer? And if you want to add your favorite Austen quote, please do!\n\nBrenda S. Cox is the author of Fashionable Goodness: Christianity in Jane Austen’s England. She also blogs at Faith, Science, Joy, and Jane Austen.\n\nFor years, I’ve loved the Penguin Random House “Puffin in Bloom” editions of Anne of Green Gables, Heidi, Little Women, and A Little Princess. I typically purchase these gorgeous books as gifts for my bookish friends and their daughters.\n\nNow, the Puffin in Bloom line has expanded to include three of Jane Austen’s novels as well!\n\nDelectable Classic Covers\n\nThe Puffin in Bloom line started with four classic, coming-of-age novels: Anne of Green Gables, Heidi, Little Women, and A Little Princess. These hardcover classics feature floral cover illustrations by Anna Bond, the creative director and artistic inspiration behind the global stationery phenomenon Rifle Paper Co. Puffin in Bloom became an instant success and the original foursome continues to fly off the shelves. Classics novels with such beautiful covers do not disappoint!\n\nEach book can be purchased individually or as a boxed set in a beautiful keepsake box. These hardcover books don’t just boast a pretty cover; they look and feel great in your hands. They are just the right size and they read well. I am very particular about the feel of a book in my hands, and these are a joy to hold and read. You can easily slip them into a purse or tote to take with you, too!\n\nAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland\n\nTo commemorate the 150th anniversary of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderful by Lewis Carroll, Puffin Books added to the Puffin in Bloom line and released a deluxe, hardcover gift edition of the famous novel. Once again, the talented Anna Bond created the cover illustration, and she also provided full-color illustrations inside. The result is exquisite!\n\n“In this beautiful edition, Alice’s story comes to life for a whole new generation of readers through the colorful, whimsical artwork of Anna Bond, best known as the creative director and artistic inspiration behind the worldwide stationery and gift brand Rifle Paper Co.”\n\nJane Austen in Bloom\n\nAfter years of waiting and wondering (and wishing), I was overjoyed when Penguin announced last year that they were planning to expand the Puffin in Bloom line to include other classics as well. Again, they chose Anna Bond to create new cover art with her signature style. But best of all, they chose our Jane’s cherished novels for this new endeavor!!\n\nThis first installment (I truly hope there will be more) includes Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma. Let’s take a closer look:\n\nPride and Prejudice\n\nThough her sisters are keen on finding men to marry, Elizabeth Bennet would rather wait for someone she loves – certainly not someone like Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, whom she finds to be smug and judgmental, in contrast to the charming George Wickham. But soon Elizabeth learns that her first impressions may not have been correct, and the quiet, genteel Mr. Darcy might be her true love after all. You can view and purchase HERE.\n\nSense and Sensibility\n\nBook Description: “Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willoughby, she ignores her sister Elinor‘s warning that her impulsive behavior leaves her open to gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experienc"
