        "text": "Every Father’s Day, we ask our young readers to tell us about the men in their lives — and they never disappoint us. This year, they blew us away with some of the warmest, wisest writings we’ve ever been privileged to print.\n\nKids from all over the tri-state area told us about their personal supermen — guys who, after a long week’s work, wake up early to make waffles, coach soccer or simply sit by their sick child’s bedside, reading a Harry Potter book till they go hoarse. Nor were these men necessarily fathers by birth: As 12-year-old Amari Washington writes, “Even though Eric isn’t my biological father, I love him like he is.” Let these excellent essays and those online at nypost.com inspire you to thank the supermen in your life.\n\nShake gone, the love lingers\n\nThe victim and the milkshake marauder are in the children’s ward of the hospital. The victim — me, age 7 — looks like Medusa, with hundreds of electrical wires glued to my head. I am in a hospital bed, in the midst of a 48-hour test recording my brain wave activity. The criminal is my father, who sits on the edge of the bed reading the newly released “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.” We are four hours in and my father’s voice is starting to falter.\n\nMy mom enters the room with the chocolate shake I’ve requested, but my appetite is absent. The drink is stowed in the hospital fridge. Or so I think. The following morning, I ask for my milkshake. “I thought you didn’t want it!” my father stutters. “I drank it.”\n\nI’ve forgotten the tests that confirmed my brain was perfectly fine, despite two seizures. I’ve forgotten my dad’s restless nights in the hospital, his battle to purchase the newest Harry Potter novel and his animated reading. I just remember when he accidently drank my milkshake. Kids forget — or even don’t recognize — how much their parents do for them. I hope my dad gets a fraction of the recognition he deserves this Father’s Day.\n\n— Rachel Troy, 16, Greenwich, Conn.\n\nHe’s heroic!\n\nMy dad travels around the world to work for me and my family, and though he is away a lot, he somehow is the most involved dad I ever met. He is so devoted to his four kids — once he got off a 14-hour plane ride and went straight to my school just to participate in an assembly. When I had surgery last year, he stopped traveling just to be with me and he never left my side. He cares about less fortunate people and teaches me to do the same. Every Saturday, instead of sleeping late or going to work, he wakes up early to make waffles. He’s not only my dad — he’s my hero.\n\n— Avital Mintz, 10, Manhattan\n\nCook, eat, love\n\nMy dad doesn’t speak English very well, and when we do talk, we do so in Chinese. My dad isn’t even very talkative to begin with. But I know that he loves me. I can taste it. He works at a restaurant and whenever I’m hungry I can call him and I know that he will always feed me. My friends tell me how much they hate vegetables, but I’ve always loved them; probably because my dad makes the best bok choy, asparagus and kale ever. Whenever I take that rare day off from school because I’m sick, my dad will always rush home from work a few times a day to bring me healthy food that will make me better. Even if he could speak English better than anyone else, I would still rather he tell me everything through his cooking.\n\n— William Chan, 16, Manhattan\n\nHe makes even bedtime fun!\n\nMy dad is very fun. Before I go to bed, he does the “motorcycle” — when I go on his back and he runs, spins, then drops me on the bed. He makes cool Lego sets for me and my brother. He is a very good soccer player and he is my coach.\n\n— Diego Parga, 8, Brooklyn\n\nMy dad, if not by name\n\nMy dad’s name is Eric and he is the BEST dad ever! He lets me paint his nails and do his hair — the little bit that he has, lol — just because he knows it’s what I like to do. When I was too scared to get an X-ray he made everything better. Even though Eric isn’t my biological father, I love him like he is. I’m his princess and he’s MY DAD.\n\n— Amari Washington, 12, Queens\n\nMy father, my friend\n\nBy the time most people get to my age, they want to distance themselves from their parents. But as I’ve gotten older, my father and I have connected even more. Why? Because my dad, at age 48, is still one big kid. In the summer, he wakes up at 6 a.m. every day to surf the Ditch Plains waves in Montauk. He sold his NYC-based business in 2005 to stay home and have a greater influence on the lives of my brother and me. Without him, I don’t know how I would have transported myself to baseball tournaments or had someone to complain to about the Mets’ bullpen woes.\n\nThe main reason I’m writing this is that he has instilled in me the need to treat others with respect … It’s for his personality that I’m happy to call him my best friend. It is for what he has taught me that I am happy to call him my dad. Fortunately, I can call him both.\n\n— Lukas Manthey, 15, Montclair, NJ\n\nHe knows how to live!\n\nI think my dad is incredible. He loves us so much that he tries his hardest to make our home happy and exciting. He once built a zip line in my backyard, and a kids’ playhouse. We slept in it that night (even though it was cold and my mom thought he was crazy). One time when we went to a lake, he encouraged me to jump off a big rock even though I was scared. I did it and I was so proud of myself. He always says, “You have one life — so you’ve gotta live it.” And he really does!\n\n— Lielle Grunstein, 8, Teaneck, NJ\n\nA window into his soul\n\nMy dad and I are Yankee fans, so whenever there is a game on late on a school night, he always has an excuse ready for my mom so I can watch. Then he answers my many questions with patience … You know how windows are unique? It may seem that there are tons of windows all the same but look closely — each is one of a kind, and so is he. He is sweet, helpful, hard working and just plain fun! He makes me laugh and even though his cooking is just OK, you would be happy and pleased to hear his laughter. So I say to all of you reading this, take a moment and celebrate your father. Make him feel proud that he has a kid who really appreciates him.\n\n— Wen Trott-Herdrich, 11, Manhattan\n\nMy father, my rock\n\nThere’s always that one person in life that becomes your rock. The one you lean on when times get rough. To me, that person is my father, my best friend, my Goosey. People always used to tell me that I was my father’s child. I wouldn’t go to anyone but him. It didn’t take long for me to start saying the word “Da-da.” When my parents went through a divorce, I was 5. I remember grabbing onto my dad’s legs with all my might, begging him not to go. That moment we shared symbolizes the tight bond that me and my dad will always have.\n\n— Mariyann Soulemane, 16, Norwalk, Conn.\n\nHis priority? Making her happy\n\nDear Dad, I love everything about you! There are so many things you do for me that I couldn’t explain how much you mean to me. First, you are always nice, loving and caring. Next, when I am sad you always make it a priority to make me happy. Finally, due to being a first responder on 9/11, you have been diagnosed with restrictive lung disease, and even though it slows you down, you still manage to play basketball and other sports with my brothers and me.\n\nI wouldn’t know what to do without you. I am so proud to call you my dad.\n\n— Nicole Ryan, 12, LI\n\nHand in hand, always\n\nMy dad, there since Day 1, holding my hand, guiding me through life. Whether I was going out on stage for a dance recital at age 4, or seeing him up at the fields watching me play softball, he is always there. He’s always there to help me whatever it may be — a homework question or how to turn a double play quicker. He’s my dad and I love him. I don’t know how I would ever live without him. Happy Father’s Day, Daddy!\n\n— Maria Kozdroy, 16, North Haven, Conn.\n\nThe best kind of alarm clock\n\nEvery morning my dad is the first to wake me up. He wakes me up for school at least three times, and he usually doesn’t get angry until the fifth time. When I was younger he used to pick me up out of bed and carry me upstairs.\n\nNow he picks the puppy that sleeps at the end of my bed and carries him upstairs instead. When I was younger, my dad would make me breakfast and always make the egg all wrong. Now he packs my lunch and cuts my sandwich all wrong. Every morning I leave the apartment with my dad as he carries the dog out for a walk. He’s always the first one ready and waiting whenever we plan to go anywhere. I know that no matter what, my dad won’t leave without me.\n\n— Anna Trott-Herdrich, 17, Manhattan\n\nFrom Uzbekistan with love\n\nTo me, an ideal father is someone who takes responsibility for his kids, raises them properly and never abandons them. Emanuel certainly exceeded that definition. He may not be my biological father, but as far as I’m concerned, he is the greatest dad in the world.\n\nI was born in Uzbekistan, but I would have never been able to emigrate to America if it wasn’t for him. Although he lived thousands of miles away in New York, Emanuel was able to reunite with my mother by chance after not seeing each other when they themselves were childhood friends. He spent a lot of money on plane tickets to visit us five more times before deciding that we should move to America for a better life. Ever since, he has accepted me as his own son, and in turn I have accepted him as my father …\n\nMany people warned Manny that getting married to a woman with two kids might not work out. We didn’t know any English at the time nor had any idea what America was like, but he refused to listen, and out of love for us he took what possibly was the greatest risk of his life. To me that is one of the finest examples of true love and care in addition to a daring act.\n\nI owe him everything I have and I hope to someday make him proud and return the favor.\n\n— Vlad Makarov, 19, Queens\n\nMy one and only\n\nSince it’s Father’s Day, let’s get right to it: I am giving thanks to my one and only father, Michael Gumbs. Everybody says I look like you, so I have to be your daughter. You take me where I need to be all the time and never try to miss out on what I have planned. You taught me how to play soccer and got me my first phone. Even though you can be hard on me sometimes, I just want to say thank you for everything you have done for me. Happy Father’s Day. I love you!\n\n— Kyanna Gumbs, 11, Brooklyn\n\nNothing less than a princess\n\nMy father can’t fly or walk on water, but he’s my Superman. He’d rather listen to me complain all day rather than not being able to listen to me at all. It’s really something to be eager to be around your father just because around him you’re nothing less than a princess. And although I’m growing up and things are changing, I’ll always be my father’s greatest creation. I’m so grateful to have you in my life, my Superman.\n\n— Kana Danzey, 17, Norwalk, Conn.\n\nHe bounces back like a boomerang!\n\nMy dad is no athlete, rock star or president, but he sure is famous in my heart. He always has a positive attitude and a big, bright smile. I should also mention that he has a corny sense of humor and spoils me to death!\n\nWhether I’m sick in bed, need help studying for an exam or having a problem in school, he’s always ready to assist me in any way possible. Most dads like to sleep in late when they can, but my dad wakes up at 5:30 every morning to make sure I always have a hearty breakfast. Sometimes my dad has a bad day, but like a boomerang, he constantly bounces back, ready to meet my needs.\n\nAlthough my dad may not excel at everything he does, when it comes to me, he sure is one heck of a guy! Wow, am I lucky to have him!\n\n— Jasmin Mia Francis, 12, LI\n\nMaking time for Thomas\n\nMy daddy is my best buddy! No matter what mood he is in, he makes time to play with me — even if I want to play Thomas the Train for the millionth time. We always laugh together, and he makes me and my mommy feel safe and loved. He makes me so happy!\n\n— Cole Freilich, 3, Hampstead, NH\n\nHe makes up songs!\n\nOur dad is a very creative dad. He lets us sleep on our roof deck in a tent, he helps us make forts in our room and brings us skiing during school breaks. He comes into our classrooms and does fun stuff — once he had our class make snow globes.\n\nHe plays the guitar and makes up very funny songs with us. One of the funniest songs he made up was called “Red Hot Marshmallows.” He also helps us with our homework, and sometimes for breakfast he makes us healthy shakes. He is the best daddy in the whole entire universe.\n\n— Adeline Mai Smith, 8, and Charlotte Xuan Dao Smith, 6, Brooklyn\n\nI do it for him\n\nI live every day with the goal of making him proud. He wanted the best opportunities for me and encouraged me to start softball and gymnastics as soon as I could walk. He would always make me feel special because he knew his time was limited until cancer got the best of him.\n\nThe seven years I spent with him were short but I am so lucky I was able to call him my father.\n\n— Cassidy Curnyn, 18, Norwalk, Conn.\n\nTwo girls means twice the fun\n\nAt 13 years old, we still like hanging out with dear old Dad! We watch TV with him on Friday nights and sometimes, if it’s a nice day, we’ll go outside and pass the soccer ball. We always joke that we’ll die of embarrassment if someone in our grade walks by and sees us, but in reality, it’s fun hanging out with him. He always knows what to say to our friends and, in general, keeps his cool … When we think about our dad, we think of someone we can depend on to always be there for us. We love him from here to the end of the universe and back.\n\n— Sarah and Rachel Billings, 13, Westchester, NY\n\nSilly things mean great moments\n\nMy dad does silly things that most people wouldn’t do. He decided to spray a frog with a water hose one day. He thought this was so funny until 12 other frogs showed up ready to attack. I guess you can say he learned a lesson that day. I cherish moments like this with my dad because some children do not have father figures in their life. I appreciate everything my dad has done for me over these past 17 years. I might just always be daddy’s little girl.\n\n— Ajanique Fullard, 17, Norwalk, Conn.\n\nWhat he does for love\n\nThere is absolutely nothing my dad wouldn’t do for me, my younger brother and my older sister. Since this is his first Father’s Day without his own father, I wanted him to know that no matter what, he has a family who loves him. He is definitely the man of the household and keeps it together since my mother has multiple sclerosis and it isn’t easy for her to do things. But he’s always kept a roof over our heads, and one thing he always taught us was “A family that plays together, stays together,” which is something a lot of people admire about us.\n\nFrom my first time at the Puerto Rican Day Parade to him going with me to my first Chris Brown concert, I’m very lucky to call this man, Jose Sanchez, my father.\n\n— Bianka Sanchez, 20, Staten Island\n\nHis daily routine was my adventure\n\nI will always remember as a little girl constantly asking, “Can I go to work with Daddy today?” As a little girl, going to work with my dad at his pizza place was fascinating. I loved to see what he did each day, and I would feel just as important when he would assign me simple tasks. It was his everyday routine, but for me it was an adventure … I know that I can go to my dad for anything, whether it’s advice about a problem or even just for a comforting hug. Happy Father’s Day!\n\n— Christina DeBlasi, 17, Norwalk, Conn.\n\nBloody wonderful!\n\nI would like to tell you something my father did that was daring. I was playing outside and I tripped! I was gushing blood and was in so much pain! My father had his best white shirt on, but said, “I will pick you up anyway!” His shirt was all bloody and stained for good. I was 6 ¹/₂. My father always says he is so rich because he has me, my brother and my sister. He only cared about carrying me home, so that $80 shirt went to waste. That is the story of how I felt loved and cared for by my father.\n\n— Elana Leeder, 9, Brooklyn\n\nAll that love, and a penguin!\n\nMy dad is nice when he drives to my baseball practice and games. He is also nice to me when he takes me and my family out to dinner. I will never forget when we went to Canada with him on his business trip even though we were not supposed to. I really liked when we went to a shop and Dad bought me a stone penguin. I love my Dad.\n\n— Joey Zeppieri, 9, Glastonbury, Conn.\n\nHe’s in the stands, cheering\n\nMy dad makes me feel important when he comes to my baseball games. He isn’t the cheering type of person, but he sits in the stands and claps up a storm. I can tell from the expression on his face that he is involved in the game, and I’m sure he loves watching it.\n\n— Will D. Zeppieri, 12, Glastonbury, Conn.\n\n‘My Extraordinary Dad’\n\nI have a confession that I must admit\n\nAfter 19 long years the realization has finally hit,\n\nMy enlightenment is referring to you dad and the fact that you never quit.\n\nAn intelligent, empowered woman I am today\n\nAnd it is you who I have to thank for making me this way.\n\nStruggling on the inside while smiling on the out\n\nYou have given me the life every girl dreams of, I have no doubts.\n\nI hope you know the sacrifices you have made will never fade\n\nI strive to repay you by doing great things\n\nThings incomparable to a billion golden rings.\n\nI love you tremendously, for you have given me the world\n\nAnd for that I will always be daddy’s little girl\n\n— Lauren McMahon, 19, New Rochelle"
