But we had other lunch plans on our minds .\n\nA busker with a pretty voice drew us to listen to her and record a quick video as people passed between the camera and the singer .\n\nC2304.MP4\n\nIt was the first hit for David Bowie , Space Oddity which came out about the same time as the Tull Album Stand up. Here's the original video which the rights belong to the artist .\n\nThe singers name was Serena Kaos and as I was buying one of her CD's she explained that her next song was from the Fleetwood Mac Album that came about the time when my wife and I had just met . Unlike the song that is a breakup song , we have been together since 1976 .\n\nThe Fleetwood Mac song is called Dreams and I think that she sings it better than the original singer .\n\nC2305.MP4\n\nEdited August 1 by scubacruiserx2\n\n3 hours ago, Justpackingmybags said:\n\nThe guard is not from the Lifeguards or the Blues and Royals, who are the regiments with the plumed helmets and polished breastplates. She is from the King’s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, and that is their full dress uniform. They are the unit who provide the 21 gun salutes.\n\nsadly, the panic button has become necessary to bring police officers over to get rid of idiots who think it’s fun to go and try and provoke responses from the soldiers and their horses. These idiots can be very aggressive.\n\nThank you for Minding my knowledge gap and supplying answers to some unasked questions dancing around in my mind . Very informative ! We've seen some of the knuckleheads on video that you are talking about trying to get their special photos with the mounted guards and their mounts . The guards have a lot more patience and discipline then I currently have .\n\nWe also love the Tate Britain in London and have a dear friend from Manchester who paints in the style of the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood .\n\nOphelia - John Everett Millais\n\nChrist in the house of his Parents - John Everett Millais\n\nI also fancy the works of William Blake but not many were on display this trip , so here's a couple of older ones from our trip with our grandson there in 2016 .\n\nHe also wrote the song Jerusalem preformed here at the proms in the Royal Albert Hall and in the movie Chariots of Fire , which took the movie tittle from a lyric in the song ( and in the Bible ) . We had tickets for the Proms our last night in London .\n\nAfter lunch we wanted a dessert but on the way we saw the Oxfam used book store . There was a book on the Queen that the Big Smile company will not stock so we tried there . Nope . A William Blake art photo book was next , nope . But Pat found a nice like new book that we liked for 3 GBP !\n\nWe found Baclava at The Greek Life shop a couple of stores down but Pat wanted something cool and the worker told her about a Gelato stand which she was allowed to get and eat with me inside . Afterwards I asked if I could use the wash room to get the honey off my hands and she allowed me to use the employees Loo . All was fine - until the lights went out . Maybe they forgot to pay their electric bill . But as I moved , they came back on - duh , motion activated ! 😅\n\nAfter a cab ride to the hotel a food coma nap was accomplished . We had the Phantom in the evening and the food and prices at the hotel looked good as the Garden dining was open .\n\nCarrot and Coriander Soup was good as well as the shrimps app.\n\nThe Cauliflower Steak was much better than it sounded\n\nSome demanding high rollers ( better dressed ) dropped in for a drink before the theater and our lone server was hopping with other folks so we decided to card him to prompt his memory that we were guests .\n\nHe instantly recognized the issue and we told him that we were going also but left our proper clothes upstairs to avoid soiling them . He did over to buy us a drink after the show .\n\nDessert decision and the proper people and the phone people . We still don't understand constantly being on the phone while dining out .\n\nWe wish that we could afford fencing like this for our yard\n\nAfter changing out after dinner , we headed out to our taxi for about a half mile ride to His Majesty's Theatre . It's about a half miles walk over uneven surfaces and the Taxi rides , our 4th this day , cost about 10 GBP with about a 2.5 GBP tip it ran about 50 GBP for the 4 trips that day . We think that the London Taxi rides and drivers are the best that we have used .\n\nWe were seated in the Royal Circle Center in the first 2 aisle seats on the left at E 28 and 27 . We were told not to record but many people we taking selfies in Row A before the show .\n\nThe seats were steep steps and we ordered a drink to be brought after intermission . The show began at about 1930 and was the 2nd time that we had seen it there . Our friend and her sons had seen it the night before and said that it was HOT . The seats are skinny without much leg room unless you are under 5' 3\" which Pat is . I'm almost a foot taller . I tried slumping in my seat but the girls behind us kept crossing their legs and boots at my head level on my seat . I did ask them not to several times without success . So I just set up straight allowing their boot to massage my back instead of my head . The tickets were 130 GBP each and the white bubbly was 70 GBP .\n\nThe show was good but a few changes were updated in the show that we didn't care for . The taxi driver had told us to walk a long block and turn left to find cabs after the show . We were herded out of the theatre ASAP to \" Set up for the next show \" . After a comfort stop 1200 people we herded outside under the small covered area into a pouring rain . We spied a Pedicab and jumped into it without agreeing on a price . Rookie mistake . After a wet 5 minute ride to the hotel the driver demanded a 125 GBP ! We told him that we had only paid 50 for four rides that day but he remained firm . We suggested to discuss it under the hotel cover and got out . The doorman and porters heard the discussion and joined in speaking to him in Spanish and Arabic . He got the message and told us to give him what it was worth to us . We didn't but gave him 50 and told him to get a couple of other suckers somewhere else . We did change and let the Waiter at the Bar know that the drinks we appreciated , but not necessary . We slept well and was ready for the ride to Southampton at 0900 the next morning .\n\nOur takeaway is to rent the 2004 movie on your big screen for $3.99 like we did last night .\n\n29 minutes ago, Jazzbo said:\n\nMy Mum was from Liverpool. She and my Dad met and married in Liverpool while he was stationed at an Air Force base near there. They had been married about 2 1/2 years and I was 6 months old when my Dad was transferred back to the States and my Dad’s family met my Mum for the first time. My Dad and my Uncle Tony planned to go deer hunting and were leaving early in the morning. The night before my Mum said to my uncle, “knock me up in the morning before you leave, Tony.” Needless to say, that became part of our family lore! Thank you for reminding me and making me smile. 😊\n\nYou're welcome , and that you for making us smile this morning . A nice way to start a new day .\n\nI sometimes tell people that I'm bilingual . I speak both English and American . I became fascinated with English and it's slang after the Beatles A Hard days Night and the British Invasion of the early 60's - the music of the Baby Boomers . And Spinal Tap didn't hurt as much as I thought it would . Once in the good old days BP ( Before Putin , not British Petroleum ) , we were flying to and staying in Saint Petersburg and I was seated next to a coach of a British kids fencing team going to compete in St. Pete . He was about our son's age and we traded music with each other's device . The subject of Spinal Tap came up since he believed that they were a real group from my generation . He couldn't believe that they were not British as their accents were so good , but rather American actors including Micheal Mc Kean who played Lenny on Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley .\n\nWe thought that we were fully packed and met our driver from Transzitt promptly at 0915 for our transfer to the CB . The driver owned a black Mercedes van that seated 6 and luggage . About half of the time was spent in the city and half on the motorway . The CB was tied up in a different place than we have always used before on Celebrity . We watched to safety drill and checked in at the appointed place before having lunch at the Coral dining room . On the road Pat was a little sick with sinus issues . Boarding into Suite R 409 was a snap .\n\nAndrii our waiter is from the Ukraine but I spoke to him in conversational Russian which we speak better than Spanish . He was very nice and a great person . Of course we highly approve of the defense of their nation and refuse to support their invaders even though we have friends in Russia who don't support their President's actions . But we have had some lemons also that we don't approve of their actions either .\n\nWe have spent more time in Cozumel than anywhere outside of our county for SCUBA diving there . We were seated in front of a painting of Cozumel that shows mountains . It must have been painted by someone from Hollywood with a good imagination since it looks more like Hawaii than Cozumel .\n\nEdited August 3 by scubacruiserx2"
