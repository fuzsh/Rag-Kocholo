Have an account? .\n\nPrince William, The Duke of Cambridge is celebrating his 40th birthday.\n\nWilliam is second in line to the British throne and the future king of the United Kingdom.\n\nInsider has gathered the best photo from every year of his remarkable life so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1982: Prince William was born at St Mary's Hospital to parents Prince Charles and Princess Diana on June 21. The couple posed outside the Lindo Wing maternity ward after the birth, marking a new royal tradition that would later be followed by William with his own children.\n\n1983: William was just nine months old when he joined his parents on a tour of Australia and New Zealand. In this photo, the family are greeted by fans at Alice Spring Airport in Australia on March 20.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1984: Prince William's brother Harry was born on September 15. It wasn't long after that William got to meet him, as his nanny Barbara Barnes was pictured taking him to visit him in the hospital.\n\n1985: Charles and Diana raised the boys at Kensington Palace in London, where William now resides with his own family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1986: Family vacations were regular. In this photo, William, Harry, Charles, and Diana are joined by the Spanish royal family for a holiday in Mallorca.\n\n1987: William was exposed to royal life from an early age. In this photo, he shares a carriage ride with the Queen Mother at a parade at Buckingham Palace on June 13.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1988: The following year, he joined his mother and Prince Harry on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping the Colour.\n\n1989: Despite being part of one of the most famous families in the world, they still took part in regular activities, like cycling. This photo was taken in Tresco, one of the Scilly Isles, in June.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1990: Prince William, top right, helped family friends bury Diana's legs in the sand during a trip to Necker Island.\n\n1991: At just 9 years old, the young prince was already a hit with royal family fans. This photo was taken outside St. James Cathedral during a trip to Toronto, Canada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1992: Family days out were a must. Here he is leaving London's Natural History Museum with Harry and Diana in April.\n\n1993: As a child, it wasn't unusual for William to be taken on long breaks outside of London to get away from the waiting press. Here he is at St Kitts in the Caribbean with Diana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1994: As the future king, William got to attend his fair share of high profile events, including Wimbledon. He watched the Ladies' Tennis Championship in July.\n\n1995: At the age of 13, he started his first day of classes at Eton College on September 7. Eton is an all-boys boarding school in Berkshire, England.
