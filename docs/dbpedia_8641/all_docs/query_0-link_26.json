[et al.]. München, Germany : C.H. Beck ; Oxford, United Kingdom ; Portland, Ore. : Hart ; Baden-Baden, Germany : Nomos, c2012. The major instrument for international arbitration is the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention) of June 10, 1958, which entered into force one year after. The New York Convention is labeled the Magna Carta of international arbitration and has been ratified by 144 States, including all of the important trading nations. The courts of any contracting State are required \"to give effect to an agreement to arbitrate when seized of an action in a matter covered by an arbitration agreement and also to recognize and enforce awards made in other States, subject to specific limited exceptions\" (UNCITRAL). In this book, the 16 articles of the Convention are dealt with in an article-by-article analysis, following a clear structure which swiftly guides the reader to the issue that he or she is engaged with.\n\nEU Public Procurement Law\n\nOutside the EU procurement directives -- inside the Treaty? / Roberto Caranta & Dacian Dragos (eds.). Publication Information Copenhagen : DJØF Publishing, 2012. Distribution Information Portland, USA : International Specialized Book Services. / Most procurement contracts passed in the European Union escape the full rigor of the application of the 2004 directives, since they are either below the threshold or concern non-priority services. However, the Court of Justice has held that the general principles of non-discrimination and transparency apply to contracts which - because of their subject matter, value, or other characteristics - present a cross-border interest. EU Member States and procuring entities have been given some guidance - by the case law and the Commission - on what is needed to comply with the said principles, but for the most part they themselves have to fill in the blank spaces in the regulatory framework. This book provides information on how a number of relevant jurisdictions in the EU have responded to the call by the Court of Justice, highlighting both best practices and areas of uncertainties. A chapter on the EU legal framework and a number of comparative chapters help in understanding both the requirements imposed by the EU case law as well as the developing trends at the national level, which are to influence the next generation of procurement directives.

This study demonstrates the extensive protection that international law provides to human rights even in the most serious of emergencies when they are particularly vulnerable. Based on a meticulous analysis of preparatory works and practice under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the American and European Conventions on Human Rights, and with a special chapter on the International Labour Organisation's approach to international labour standards and emergencies, this book shows that respect for the rule of law and the concept of a democratic society are controlling parameters in any valid limitation on the enjoyment of human rights. It further shows that respect for human rights and the operation of institutions such as the Legislature and Judiciary are crucial to enabling societies to address and eventually remedy the root causes of emergency situations. The study recommends possible directions for the development of case law and suggests some practical means to help ensure that international legal requirements are in fact respected in emergencies.\n\nThe Laws of War - A Comprehensive Collection of Primary Documents on International Laws Governing Armed Conflict\n\nOn the Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in case of War on Land.
