The world was fascinated when William and Kate first went public with their romance almost twenty years ago.\n\nThe couple has now come to symbolize the stability that Queen Elizabeth II once provided while also adapting to the ideals and values of the modern day, making them symbols of the British royal family.\n\nFrom their picture-perfect wedding to their current idyllic family of five, William and Kate's romantic romance seems to have followed a somewhat fairytale path. Here's a look back at Prince William and Kate Middleton’s relationship timeline!\n\n2001: Kate Middleton and Prince William meet at college\n\nIt was while attending St. Andrews University in Scotland that Prince William and Kate Middleton first met. They both studied art history although William eventually switched to geography as his major. According to reports, William was won over by Kate after he saw her in a charity student fashion show (where he allegedly paid £200 for a front row seat).\n\nKate claims that because she was shy at first, it took them some time to get to know one another. But after that, the two grew to be extremely close friends. The prince claimed that as they spent more time together, they discovered similarities.\n\nOctober 2002: Kate Middleton and Prince William move in together with friends\n\nKate and William moved into a four-bedroom, two-story townhouse off campus with friends Fergus Boyd and Olivia Bleasdale to begin their second year at St Andrews.
