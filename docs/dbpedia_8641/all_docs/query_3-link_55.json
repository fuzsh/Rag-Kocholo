        "text": "Book Review : Princess Academy by Shannon Hale\n\nSpoiler Alert!\n\nMount Eskel is home to a small village who quarries the precious linder stone for the lowlands. Miri is small and feels useless since her father won’t even allow her to enter the quarry. One day an official from the palace announces that the priests have determined that the bride for Prince Steffan will be found from the province of Mount Eskel. Traditionally the eligible girls will attend the Princess Academy to prepare themselves to meet the Prince. All the young women from 13 – 17 years old attend the school where they learn important subjects like reading, poise and conversation. No one could have guessed everything else these girls will learn in a year. One thing is certain, Miri and her village will never be the same again.\n\nAdult Point of View\n\nPrincess Academy is possibly my favorite Shannon Hale book. I re-read this novel to prepare myself for the sequel and found that I was thoroughly enchanted. I love the quarry-speech, the singing and the quaint holding of hands.\n\nThe setting feels like an old fable, but the story is actually so much more. I love how the education of these mountain girls makes it possible for them to change their lives by understanding commerce. I love the thirst the girls have for learning and wanting to teach others. I love seeing a sense of justice. The themes of friendship, family, forgiveness, hard work and personal worth are by far stronger than the initial desire the girls have of becoming the princess. Miri experiences the most growth, originally she is unsure of herself and becomes confident, brave and compassionate.\n\nThis is a perfect novel for tweens who are good readers and for young teens. I am giving it a high rating because of the values it exhibits, the beautiful writing and because Miri deserves it.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\n– the Mother\n\nTeen Point of View\n\nI think it is a good book for people younger than me, but it has a very unique idea. I wish it had been more exciting.\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\n– the Daughter\n\n(Please note the teen is almost 15 years old and Princess Academy is a little younger audience.)"
