They had tea and made presentations on the lawn at Saumarez park before touring the West Coast and St Saviours on their way to the new Princess Elizabeth Hospital which the Princess officially opened with a silver key. They had dinner at the Old Government House Hotel before departing later that evening on HMS Anson.\n\n1957, July 26 - HM The Queen and HRH Prince Philip\n\nThe first visit to the Island since being crowned, the Queen and Prince Philip were presented with gifts for both Prince Charles and Princess Anne at Cambridge Park where over 6,000 schoolchildren had gathered to welcome them. There was a busy itinerary including a visit to St Georges Hall for a meeting of the Chief Pleas. The day ended with a firework display over Castle Cornet.\n\n1978, June 27 - HM The Queen and HRH Prince Philip\n\nThe day started with the Royal couple taking a walk through St Peter Port including the old Guernsey Market. After a formal lunch at the Royal Hotel they travelled out to St Peters Village and once again met the crowds who had gathered to see them. They then moved on to Cambridge Park stopping en route at a tomato vinery. After greeting the thousands of children who had gathered at the port the Queen returned to the Royal Yacht while Prince Philip went to St Peter Port School to meet some young people involved in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme. There was a reception and dinner on HMS Britannia that evening and the following day, the Queen & Prince Philip also visited Alderney and Sark.\n\n1989, May - HM The Queen and HRH Prince Philip\n\nThe Queen and Prince Phillip's primary reason for visiting the Bailiwick on this occasion was to open the new Queen Elizabeth II Marina. The Queen arrived on HMS Britannia and was joined by Prince Philip who had flown to the Island from the Azores. They first met local dignitaries at Beau Sejour and then visited the Bailiff's Chambers and walked around St Peter Port before declaring the new marina open. They had lunch at the Royal Hotel before meeting parish officials and more crowds of people in St Sampson. Their busy schedule then took them on a visit to Saumarez Park and in the evening they hosted a gala reception on HMS Britannia. The following day the Royal couple visited Sark where the Queen opened a new medical centre and then they moved on to Alderney for a formal reception at the Island Hall."
