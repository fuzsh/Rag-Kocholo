        "text": "Lionel Richie is ready to say \"hello\" to his new American Idol colleague: Carrie Underwood.\n\nDays after the \"Before He Cheats\" singer—who won season four of the ABC competition series in 2005—confirmed she's replacing Katy Perry at the judges' table, Lionel is weighing in on his new costar.\n\n\"It makes a lot of sense,\" he told E! News Aug. 5 while attending the Grammy Museum's screening of The Greatest Night in Pop. \"It's not someone we have to get used to. And the fact that she has a great story, she came from American Idol.\" (For more from Lionel, watch E! News Aug. 6 at 11 p.m.)\n\n\"What a great judge,\" Lionel continued, \"now we don't have to explain anymore, 'We know how you feel.' As artists, we know how you feel, but we've never been in that oval that says, 'American Idol.' She's been there, done that.\"\n\nLionel also hopes Carrie has a great sense of humor as she sits alongside him and fellow judge Luke Bryan.\n\n\"Just be a ham sandwich like the two of us,\" he said with a laugh. \"Welcome to the ham sandwich squad.\""
