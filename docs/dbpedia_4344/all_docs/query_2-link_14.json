        "text": "In 1922 Newcastle West represented the County in the Munster championship. They played Clare, Kerry and Tipperary in 1922, 1923 and 1924.\n\nThe game lapsed for a period and was revived in 1932 with Nora Foley and Mary Cussen as Secretaries. Other officials were Miss Daly, Ballingarry, Miss J. Cagney, Newcastle West, Miss J. Stokes and Bridie O’Connor Templeglantine. Clubs that affiliated were Adare, Ardagh, Askeaton, Ballingarry, Ballysteen, Croagh, Foynes, Kildimo, Killoughteen, Monegea, Newcastle West, Pallaskenry, Attyfin, Shountrade, Templeglantine, Tournafulla and Glin. In the East with Miss Coll as secretary, Ballylanders, Bruree, Fedamore, Pallasgreen, Castleconnell, Kilteely, Doon and Kilmallock were prominent.\n\nIn 1937, Limerick had 13 affiliated clubs. They did not compete at inter-county level. In 1939, Limerick affiliated to Ard Chomhairle. Camogie almost came to a standstill during World War 2. In 1947, Mary O’Halloran and Kathleen O’Leary from Antrim, held a meeting at the National Hotel, Limerick to re-organise the game in the county. Sean O’Duffy, general organiser and Sheila McAnulty Monsignor Hamilton, Jack O’Connell and Mickey Fitzgibbon, County Board GAA and many other interested were in attendance. This was the start of the Limerick Camogie Association as it is today.\n\nThe game declined in the early fifties but in 1953 the game again gained in strength. Limerick entered the provincial championship. County players of note in the fifties were: Anne Shanny, Carry Gillane, Mary Kennedy, A. Butler, Margie Moroney, J. Murphy, P. Stokes, M. Whelan, A Houlihan, C. Hanley, P. Stokes, S. Moran, Teresa Quaid, Bunty Shire, T. Hannon, M. O’Connor, Bridie Giltenane, B. Sheehy, A. O’Neill, R. Fitzgerald, A Houlihan, M. McMahon, S. Gallaher, E. Hanly, M. Hartnett, M. Riordan, M. Cotter, E. Neville, and M. McDonagh.\n\nThe game again went into decline in 1958 and 1959 but in 1960/61 the County Board was again reformed due to the efforts of Chris Ni Chonaill, Carrie Gillane and Eithne Neville. While progress was slow at the start, due mainly to lack of transport, poor communication, little finance, but also due to the lack of encouragement given to females to take part in such games. Thankfully this attitude has changed very much for the better. Now Camogie is on a strong footing, and the County Board has continued without interruption since those days in the early 60s. It has very able administrators, and parents, schools and the general public are all now more involved. More girls play the game and are well catered for in all the competitions being held as follows: Under 12, 14, 16, 18, 21 Leagues and Championships, Junior, Intermediate and Senior Leagues & Championships, Feile na nGael and Schools Competitions."
