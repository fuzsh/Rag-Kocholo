        "text": "Body\n\nIn 1938 Dublin won the Liam McCarthy cup with victory over Waterford in the final. Having defeated Laois in the provincial final, the Dublin minors went down 7-2 to 5-4 against Cork in the All-Ireland Final on the day Christy Ring won his first All-Ireland medal. Three Crokes players played for Dublin, C McCarthy, F Flynn and Christy Jenkinson.\n\nC McCarthy\n\nThe first mention of a C McCarthy is winning a minor Hurling League medal with Crokes in 1935. Also on that team was a T McCarthy, possibly a brother, who was one of eight Crokes players on that years Dublin Minor Hurling panel. C McCarthy played on the Crokes second adult (Junior) team in 1937 and also for the Dublin minors that year. In 1938 he was on the Crokes senior panel. When Dublin went down by 7-2 to 5-4 to Cork in the 1938 All-Ireland Minor Final McCarthy was in goal.\n\nF Flynn\n\nThe first record we have of F Flynn as a Crokes player is as a member of the Crokes panel that went down 7-8 to 4-3 to Army Metro in a game to decide who would face Faughs in the 1938 Senior Hurling League Final. He was at centre back in the 1938 All-Ireland Minor Hurling Final.\n\nChristy Jenkinson\n\nBrothers Christy and Tom Jenkinson (for more detail click HERE ), from Lusk, played for Crokes in the 1930’s. The latter won an All-Ireland Junior Hurling medal as a substitute, with Dublin in 1937, one of six Crokes players on the panel. The duo came in contact with the club through attendance at O’Connell Schools. Both brothers are listed in the Crokes panel that went down 7-8 to 4-3 to Army Metro in a game to decide who would face Faughs in the 1938 Senior Hurling League Final and for the senior championship game of 1939 against New Ireland. Christy was at full forward for the 1938 All-Ireland Minor Hurling Final against Cork.\n\nTom seems to have been the older and had the longer Crokes career, representing the club on the Dublin minor hurling panel of 1935, before transferring to then powerful Eohan Ruadh club in 1941. This followed the clubs reversion to Junior ranks in 1940 which, according to Tom Jenkinson, was one of the reasons Crokes players “scattered a bit”. Like many of his Crokes compatriots Tom Jenkinson played football for O’Tooles."
