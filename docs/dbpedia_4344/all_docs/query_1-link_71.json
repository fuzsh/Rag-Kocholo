        "text": "ALL-IRELAND SENIOR HURLING CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL\n\nWhen the tectonic plates of hurling giants collide, the force of nature created between these powers is something to be marvelled, it is unique, unrivalled and incomparable. The energy released, particularly where the plates meet, causes supporters to erupt into a frenzy of excitement and giddiness as they are transposed onto a new plateau full of hope and expectation, while they await their hero's arrival on the hallowed plain of Croke Park.\n\nSunday next, August 18th, will be no different as Tipperary and Kilkenny collide at 3:30pm in the molten heat of battle before a sell-out attendance in Croke Park. This is the pinnacle of the hurling year, nowhere else would players or supporters want to be, as the coveted prize of a Celtic Cross awaits the side that unleashes the greatest force causing the other to crumble and buckle. Hopefully, that force come Sunday, will be blue and gold to the core and with it the dream of seeing the Liam MacCarthy Cup raised high to a volcanic Premier roar.\n\nThere have been 27 previous championship meetings between these great rivals, with Tipperary winning 14 of those to Kilkenny's 12 and there was one draw. Of more acute and current interest is the match-up between opposing managers with the score settled on one apiece in All-Ireland Final showdown. Tipp manager Liam Sheedy will be going for two in a row on Sunday, albeit with a nine year time span. He has the passion, determination and the players to deliver; Sunday will be the ultimate examination when pitted against the most successful manager of all time in Brian Cody.\n\nSo as well look forward to the 132nd staging of the All-Ireland Hurling final, the following are details of the 27 Tipperary/Kilkenny clashes throughout the illustrious championship, all are All Ireland finals, except where stated;\n\n27/101887, at Urlingford, Tipperary (Thurles) 4-7 Kilkenny (Tullaroan) 0-0, semi-final;\n\n15/3/1896, at Jones' Road, Tipperary (Tubberadora) 6-8 Kilkenny (Tullaroan) 1-0 (1895 final);\n\n25/3/1900, at Jones Road, Tipperary (Tubberadora) 7-13 Kilkenny (Threecastles) 3-10 (1898 final);\n\n29/6/1902, at Carrick on Suir, Tipperary (Two Mile Borris) 1-11 Mooncoin 1-8, (1900 Semi-final);\n\n12/12/1909, at Cork, Kilkenny (Mooncoin) 4-6 Tipperary (Thurles) 0-12;\n\n28/7/1912, at Dungarvan, Kilkenny (Tullaroan) 3-3 Tipperary (Thurles) 1-2 (Unofficial 1911 final, after Limerick withdrew and Tipp were nominated to replace them);\n\n2/11/1913 at Croke Park, Kilkenny (Mooncoin) 2-4 Tipperary (Toomevara) 1-2;\n\n21/1/1917, at Croke Park, Tipperary (Boherlahan) 5-4 Kilkenny (Tullaroan) 3-2 (1916 final);\n\n9/9/1923 at Croke Park, Kilkenny 4-2 Tipperary 2-6;\n\n5/9/1937 at Killarney, Tipperary 3-11 Kilkenny 0-3;\n\n2/9/1945, at Croke Park, Tipperary 5-6 Kilkenny 3-6;\n\n3/9/1950, at Croke Park, Tipperary 1-9 Kilkenny 1-8;\n\n10/8/1958 at Croke Park, Tipperary 1-13 Kilkenny 1-8, semi-final;\n\n6/9/1964 at Croke Park, Tipperary 5-13 Kilkenny 2-8;\n\n3/9/1967, at Croke Park, Kilkenny 3-8 Tipperary 2-7;\n\n5/9/1971 at Croke Park, Tipperary 5-17 Kilkenny 5-14;\n\n1/9/1991, at Croke Park, Tipperary 1-16 Kilkenny 0-15;\n\n18/8/2002 at Croke Park, Kilkenny 1-20 Tipperary 1-16, semi-final;\n\n17/8/2003, at Croke Park, Kilkenny 3-18 Tipperary 0-15, semi-final;\n\n6/9/2009 at Croke Park, Kilkenny 2-22 Tipperary 0-23;\n\n5/9/2010, at Croke Park, Tipperary 4-17 Kilkenny 1-18;\n\n4/9/2011 at Croke Park, Kilkenny 2-17 Tipperary 1-16;\n\n19/8/2012, at Croke Park, Kilkenny 4-24 Tipperary 1-15, semi-final;\n\n6/7/2013, at Nowlan Park, Kilkenny 0-20 Tipperary 1-14, Qualifier;\n\n7/9/2014 at Croke Park, Tipperary 1-28 Kilkenny 3-22, Draw:\n\n27/8/2014 at Croke Park, Kilkenny 2-17 Tipperary 2-14, Replay;\n\n5/9/2016, at Croke Park, Tipperary 2-29 Kilkenny 2-20\n\nThe record attendance for a Tipperary v Kilkenny championship meeting was set on September 7th, 2014, when the teams played a first ever championship draw, which was in the All-Ireland final, at Croke Park. Tipperary scored 1-28 and Kilkenny 3-22 when 82,179 patrons were present to witness that epic final, as Hawk Eye sent the game to a replay, by ruling John 'Bubbles' O'Dwyer had struck a long range free narrowly wide of the target. In 2009, there were 82,106 people present to witness Kilkenny winning their fourth title in a row. The third highest attendance of 82,016 saw Tipperary win the 2016 decider; on a day that, current captain, Seamus Callanan scored 0-13 in a man of the match performance.\n\nTipperary's nine championship wins against Kilkenny over the past 100 years has seen two forwards captaining the winning team. Sean Kenny wore No. 12 in 1950 and Eoin Kelly at No. 13 was the man in 2010. The seven other successful captains were Jim Lanigan (No. 4, 1937), John Maher (No. 6, 1945), Tony Wall (No. 6, 1958), Michael Murphy (No. 7, 1964), Tadhg O'Connor (No. 5, 1971), Declan Carr (No. 8, 1991) and Brendan Maher (No. 8, 2016).\n\nThere have only been two previous occasions in which neither of the All-Ireland finalists had won their provincial title, Cork and Kilkenny was the first such clash in 2004, while Clare v Cork in 2013 was the other.\n\nTipperary dethroned All-Ireland champions Kilkenny on four occasions in 1958, 1964, 2010 and 2016, while Kilkenny dethroned Tipperary in 1909, 2002 and 2011.\n\nSince the introduction of the initial second chance championship in 1997, only three counties have come back from a provincial final defeat, to win the All-Ireland title. The feat was first achieved by Offaly (1998), Cork (2004) and Kilkenny (2012). Whatever the result on Sunday, this statistic will be added to by whichever captain lifts the Liam MacCarthy Cup, all of Tipperary hopes that Seamus Callanan will be the man.\n\nAnd finally as we close out the short review of history between the sides, the only previous game played on August 18th, was the classic 2002 semi-final.\n\nSo, heading into the remaining days leading up to this weekend, it's time to get the flags, bunting and colours out and adorn every parish of the county from top to bottom with blue and gold in support of our men and ladies who have prepared long and hard for their matches this weekend.\n\nTo Seamus Callanan and the panel, Liam Sheedy and his management team we send our very best wishes and support to all as we get ready for road to Croke Park.\n\nThe referee on Sunday will be James Owens (Wexford) who also refereed last year's final. This will be his third final in charge having also previously overseen the 2015 final.\n\nALL-IRELAND FINAL DAY TRADITION\n\nBefore the big game on Sunday, Tipperary will keep a tradition alive that began on the 9th of September 1923. On that occasion, Johnny Leahy, captain of the Tipperary hurling team playing against Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final, brought his players before the game to pray at the spot in Talbot Street where Sean Treacy of Soloheadbeg the renowned freedom fighter was fatally wounded in action in the War of Independence by British crown forces on October 14th 1920.\n\nSo at noon on Sunday next, Tipperary folk up for the All-Ireland hurling final will assemble in Talbot Street to pray and remember that heroic figure of the War of Independence. The speaker on this occasion will be Aogán Ó Fearghail Iar-Uachtaráin Cumann Lúthcleas Gael. All are welcome to attend.\n\nBGE U20 ALL-IRELAND HURLING CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL\n\nIn what will be a hugely anticipated repeat of this year's Bord Gáis Energy Munster U20 Hurling Final, Tipperary and Cork will meet in the All-Ireland decider in the LIT Gaelic Grounds on Saturday week, 24th August with a 6.00pm throw-in and extra time will be played in the event of a draw\n\nCAMOGIE\n\nWhile the main focus of attention this weekend will be centred on the All-Ireland hurling final, there all two hugely important games for Tipperary camogie and ladies football this Saturday, both of which have the potential to define the respective campaigns.\n\nWith that in mind we send best wishes to the Tipperary senior camogie team who Kilkenny in the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship semi-final in LIT Gaelic Grounds this Saturday August 17th where throw in is at 5:30pm.\n\nLADIES GAELIC FOOTBALL\n\nBest wishes as well to the Tipperary ladies football team that will contest the TG4 All-Ireland Intermediate Ladies Football Championship semi-final against Sligo in Nowlan Park, Kilkenny at 3pm also this Saturday, August 17th.\n\nAll support for our Ladies in both of these games on Saturday would be hugely appreciated.\n\nALL IRELAND HURLING FINAL GOLF CLASSIC\n\nTo start off a busy weekend the Tipperary Supporters Club is hosting a Golf Classic at Castlewarden Golf Course, Co Kildare on Friday 16th August 2019, two days before the All-Ireland Finals. Any individual, group or company that would like to enter a team or sponsor a tee / green should contact John Tierney 087 6821398 or by email to johntierney105@gmail.com\n\nKELLOGG'S CÚL CAMPS\n\nBest wishes to all clubs running Kellogg’s GAA Cúl Camps this week in the following venues - Aherlow, Carrick Davins, Durlas Óg, Golden-Kilfeacle, Grangemockler-Ballyneale, Moyle Rovers, Newport and Thurles Sarsfields Ladies.\n\nThe Tipperary Cúl Camp ambassadors for this season are Jason Forde and Michael Breen.\n\nSYMPATHY\n\nWe express our sympathy to the family of John Coffey (Boherlahan-Dualla) who passed away over the weekend. John who celebrated his 100th birthday early last year was the last surviving member of the 1945 All-Ireland winning Tipperary team. He also won a Munster title with Tipperary in ’45 when they defeated Limerick in the final. Previously at minor level, John won an All-Ireland with Tipperary in 1934.\n\nAt club level, he won a county championship with his native parish in 1941 lining out with his brothers Jerry and Flor.\n\nJohn is pictured right when celebrating his 100th birthday where he shared the occasion with his relations at Elm Green Nursing Home in Blanchardstown.\n\nJohn's remains reposed at Elm Green Nursing home on Tuesday with removal this morning Wednesday to St. Peter’s Church, Phibsboro arriving for 10:30am Requiem Mass, with burial afterwards in Donabate Cemetery.\n\nMay he rest in peace.\n\nLEGENDS HURLING MATCH\n\nThe Alzheimer Society of Ireland are hosting a unique fundraising initiative, which was launched by two leading Munster dementia advocates, Kevin Quaid and Kathy Ryan, who both have a dementia diagnosis, at Semple Stadium in June, will be held on Saturday, September 7th at Nenagh Éire Óg grounds (5.00pm Throw-In).\n\nThe Tipperary legends who have signed up to support the initiative are Michael Ryan, Michael Cleary, Brendan Cummins, Colm Bonnar, Declan O’Meara, Kevin Tucker, Eddie Tucker and Brian Gaynor.
