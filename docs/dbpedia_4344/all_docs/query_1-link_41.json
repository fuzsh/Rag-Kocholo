        "text": "Seán Óg Murphy Cup – Senior Hurling Championship\n\nA native of Cork city, Sean Og Murphy (1897-1956) played hurling for Blackrock and football for Nils. With Nils he won junior football titles in 1913 and 1914, while with his beloved Blackrock hurling team he won county titles in 1913, 1920, 1924, 1925 and 1927. The last three wins featured Murphy as captain of the side. He won three All-Ireland medals with Cork (1919, 1926 and 1928), along with six Munster medals. Murphy also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province as captain in the inaugural year of the Railway Cup competition in 1927, however, Leinster were the victors on that occasion. Murphy served as captain again in 1928 and 1929 as he collected two Railway Cup winners’ medals. Murphy also served as a selector on various Cork hurling teams over a period of four decades. While still a player he was a selector on the Cork teams that won the All-Ireland title sunder his captaincy in 1926 and 1928. Even though an injury brought his hurling career to an end Murphy served as a selector as Cork won two more All-Ireland titles in 1929 and 1931. He was a key member of the backroom team again as Cork won six more All-Ireland titles in 1941, 1943, 1944, 1952, 1953 and 1954. He served as secretary of Cork County Board from 1929 until his death in 1956, and in 2000 was named as full-back on the Cork Hurling Team of the Century.\n\nSeamus Long Cup – Premier Intermediate Hurling Championship\n\nA Founder member of the Ballinora GAA club , Seamus Long and his family were steeped in the GAA and have been credited with the setting up of Divisional Boards. He was Principal of Ballinora school from 1913 to 1951 and elected secretary of Ballincollig club in 1914. He was the first secretary of the Muskerry Board in 1924, the founding Chairman of the Ballinora club in the same year , was Vice-Chairman of Cork County Board from from 1940 to 1946 and was Munster Cuncil Delegate from 1949 until his death in 1953.\n\nPaddy Walsh Cup – Intermediate Hurling Championship\n\nPaddy Walsh was a native of Castlemartyr in East Cork and gave great service to the GAA over many years until his death in 2001. The GAA grounds in Castlemartyr are named in his honour. He played with Mogeely and Castlemartyr for many years and, in fact, in 1952, he captained Mogeely in an East Cork final against Castlemartyr.He also went on to represent Imokilly at County Championship level.\n\nBut it was an administrator that Paddy became best known, not only at local level, but throughout the county. He occupied very position in the club during his days, from Club President, Club Chairman for many years, field administrator, selector, team manager, East-Cork Board delegate, County Board delegate, developer of dressing rooms, guardian of the fields, pursuer of players, in fact, every job, no matter how difficult that was needed to be done to keep a small rural club simply afloat and also, at times, unbelievably successful.\n\nFor Paddy Walsh’s obituary, see http://www.castlemartyrgaa.com/pages/articles/article_paddy_walsh_tribute.asp\n\nJohn Quirke Cup – Junior A Hurling Championship\n\nA Blackrock clubman, Johnny Quirke (1911-1983) played for Cork during the 1930/40s and was part of the great four-in-a-row team. Regarded as one of the best hurlers Cork ever produced, He served as a Cork selector for many years and was deeply involved with his beloved Blackrock. He played hurling with his local club Blackrock and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county team from 1932 until 1946. Quirke’s selection on the Cork Hurling Team of the Century cements his reputation as one of his county’s greatest-ever players. Dan Hoare Cup – Junior B Inter-Division Hurling Championship\n\nThis cup commemorates Dan Hoare a former County Board President, Vice-President and Treasurer. Dan Hoare, was President of the Board at the time of his death in Jan 2016.\n\nA native of Conna in East Cork, he devoted all his life to his club St. Catherine’s, and while his club was one of the main elements of his life, he was also a County Board delegate and a member of the GPC (General Purposes Committee) before being elected Treasurer of the County Board for a nine-year period.\n\nHe served in this position from 1987 to 1996, subsequently serving served as Munster Council treasurer from 2001 to 2005 and on national committees in Croke Park.\n\nJunior B Hurling Championship – No name\n\nThis cup was first presented in 1984, and Kilbree were the inaugural winners.\n\nDick Barrett Cup – U21 Premier 1 Hurling Championship formerly known as Premier (2016-2017) and U21A (2016-1973)\n\nThis cup was presented to Cork County Board by the Dick Barrett Memorial Committee in 1974. Dick Barrett was born in 1889 in Hollyhill, near Ballineen. He qualified as a schoolteacher and when he got a teaching post in Upton, he became involved with the local GAA club there, Knockavilla. In fact, he was club secretary for a time, and was a staunch supporter of the idea that Knockavilla should retain its autonomy and not amalgamate with its parish neighbours, Valley Rovers. He was a member of the IRB and fought on the anti-Treaty side in the Civil War, meeting his death by execution in 1922. Jim Sarsfields – U21 A Hurling Championship\n\nJim Sarsfield a native of Watergrasshill gave his whole life to the GAA and his passing in Oct 2013 ended a lifetime of service to his club Watergrasshill. Jim Played with his beloved Watergrasshill and along with his brother Felix kept the club going in tough times. Jim held all the officerships in the club and at the time of his death he was club president.\n\nA man of deeply-held beliefs, he wasn’t one to compromise on his convictions and at East Cork and County Board he was never afraid to speak his mind. Jim had many proud days as his club rose from Junior B to Junior A and winning the county Junior A Hurling championship in 1974 was a career highlight for the Jim Sarsfield and he celebrated that win for many a day. Jim was extremely proud too when the clubs pitch was named after his brother Felix who like Jim gave everything to his club. Jim s contribution to Watergrasshill GAA will never be fully quantified, buts it is safe to say he will never be forgotten and today’s trophy in his honour, is a fitting tribute to a man who gave so much and asked for nothing in return. We at county board are delighted to honour a very special man with a cup bearing his name that his family has presented to the County Board and will be presented to the winners of the u21 A County Hurling County Champions in the years ahead. Inniscarra were the first winners of the cup in Nov 2017. Gene Fitzgerald Cup – U21 B HurlingPresented by the Fitzgerald family in 2010, this cup commemorates former County Board Vice-President and Treasurer Gene Fitzgerald, who died in 2007.

The Gene Fitzgerald Cup was first won by Castlelyons.\n\nAndy Scannell Cup – Senior Football Championship\n\nAndy Scannell, native of Ballingeary former NT at Clondulane NS outside Fermoy, played with Fermoy and was Secretary of the club between 1936 & 1939, Chairman from 1940 to 45. He took the Chair of the Avondhu division in 1946 & held it until 1952. Andy played with Cork Junior Hurlers & Footballers and was a selector with Cork teams at various levels including SH & SF. which included the 1945 All Irl SF winning team and the All Irl SH teams of 53 & 54.

He was a central Council delegate in the years 57 & 58.Andy died suddenly in Jan 1959.\n\nKevin McTernan Cup – Senior A Football Championship\n\nIn October 2018, St Finbarr’s victory over Duhallow led to highly emotional scenes. After finally reclaiming the Andy Scannell cup, celebrating the end of a 33 years, 8 finals losing streak the tears were mainly of joy. However, there was also inevitably turning to two great goalkeepers, stars of both losing finals, both lost at a young age.\n\nKevin McTernan was a proud servant of the great southside club. Part of the 1985 Feile winning team, he won three consecutive U21 hurling medals between 1988 and 1990. Football however was Kevin’s first love. At the age of 30 he finally made the Barr’s number 1 jersey his own. In 2008-2010 he played in 3 consecutive County finals, winning the intermediate in 2008 but suffering narrow defeats to Clonakilty and Nemo in the 2009/2010 finals.\n\nAfter the 2010 final, at the age of 39, Kevin retired from playing. However, there was no change in his dedication and service to the club, serving as selector with the U21 and U16 County football winning teams, Minor football selector and vice-chairman of the Minor committee. He was also a selector of the senior football team before his terminal illness.\n\nBilly Long Cup – Premier Intermediate Football Championship\n\nBilly Long was involved with Lees in the 1940s and 50s.

John was part of the Beara U21 teams that won back-to-back U21 titles in 1996 and 1997, and was part of the Beara panel that won the county Senior Football title in 1997. John played for the Cork U21 team in 1997 and for the Cork Juniors in 2002. A gifted sports person, in August 2002 John was part of the Ireland Aussie Rules team that won the inaugural Australian Rules World Cup competition, defeating Papua New Guinea in the final. He won many honours with his beloved club Adrigole, and it was fitting that it was for Adrigole that John played his last game in the County Junior Football semi-final on November 10th 2002 in Bantry, against Tadhg MacCarthaigh. With the game tied at 10 points each in injury time, John kicked the winning score to secure a famous win for Adrigole. Tragically it was the last time he was to kick a ball in an Adrigole jersey, as just 9 days later, on November 19th 2002, John died suddenly. Donal O’Sullivan Cup – Junior A Football Championship\n\nA Native of Ardgroom in the Beara Peninsula, Donal O’Sullivan played with St Vincent’s, Glanmire and Imokilly before he joined Lees in 1950. He was picked to play centre back on the Cork JF team of 1953 and went on to captain the Cork Seniors to National League glory in 1956. He captained Lees to County Senior success in 1955. Donal represented Lees on the Cork County Board and was the Board’s Vice Chairman from 1970 to 75. He was elected Chairman in 1976, a position he held for 77 and 78, a period in which Cork completed a three -in-a-row of All Ireland Senior Hurling Championships. He was Chairman of Munster Council from 1980 to 83. Donal died in 2001.\n\nJim Cronin Cup – Junior B Inter-Division Football Championship\n\nMr. Cronin was a lifelong member of the Millstreet club and represented the club as County Board delegate for many years.\n\nA renowned author and GAA historian, he published a number of books now regarded as priceless reference points by fans, quizmasters and statisticians, including A Rebel Hundred – Cork’s 100 All-Irelands and Cork GAA History 1886-1986.\n\nHe was elected County PRO in 1994 and went on to serve as Board Vice-Chairman (1997-1999) and County Board Chairman from 2000-2002. At the time of his death he was Honorary Vice-President, Cork County Board.\n\nJunior B Football Championship – No name\n\nThis cup was first presented in 1984.\n\nJunior C Football Championship – No name\n\nThis cup was first presented in 2016.\n\nPádraig A. Ó Murchú Cup – U21 A Football Championship\n\nThis cup commemorates the legendary Patrick Aloyius “Weeshie” Murphy of Bere Island, who served the GAA for many years, both as a player and an administrator. He played at full back for Cork on the 1945 All-Ireland Football winning team, and also played club football for Bere Island, Beara and Lees. He won three Railway Cup medals (1946, 48 and 49) and was selected at full back on the Cork Millenium Team. He served as Chairman of Cork County Board from 1955 to 1965, and was Chairman of the Munster Council at the time of his death in 1973. Weeshie’s son is Dr. Con Murphy, team doctor to the Cork Inter-County teams since 1976.\n\nSeán Ó Crualaoí Cup – U21 B Football Championship\n\nPresented in 2010 by the Crowley family in memory of the late Seán Crowley of Bandon, who was a Vice-President of the County Board up until his death in 2009. Bandon GAA was the sporting love of his life, followed by love for his division Carbery, Cork and Munster in that order.\n\nHe was Bandon’s representative on the Carbery Board and also spent many years as Bandon’s and Carbery’s representative on the Cork County Board. He served as Chairman of the Carbery Board for a number of years and was also a selector for many years on Carbery Hurling and Football teams. He also acted as selector on the Cork Football All Ireland winning team of 1973 and on the successful Munster Railway Cup team of 1972, both successes which came after many years in the doldrums for both teams.\n\nIt is significant that the U-21 B Football Cup is presented in his name. For Sean the local club was the hearbeat of the GAA, and he was always strong in his support for the smaller rural club in particular. The Cup was first won by Erin’s Own.\n\nMick Dolan Cup – U21 C Football Championship\n\nHe was an absolute true gentleman,a great servant of Cork GAA and his club Fermoy, a true GAA man and a great character and a friend of everyone who knew him\n\nHe was elected Development Officer in 1999-2001 and went on to serve as Board County Vice-Chairman (2003-2005) and County Board Chairman from 2006-2008. He also served on various other committees for the County Board, such as hearings and appeals committees .\n\nHe was instrumental in ensuring the history of Cork GAA was recorded, and in the publication of the Cork GAA history book 1987-2011 gave Mick much pleasure (Pic below)\n\nMick gave a lifetime of service to his beloved Fermoy as a player and administrator. He served in various capacities in the club including Chairman. He was much loved and this was clearly evident at huge turnout at his funeral in Fermoy.\n\nThe Mick Dolan Cup donated by his family is a fitting tribute to his contribution and we are certain Mick would say to the captain “have a drink out of that tonight oul’d stock.” Denis Conroy Cup – Senior Hurling League\n\nThe Conroy Cup commemorates the late Denis Conroy of Carrigtwohill, who served as Registrar, Vice-Chairman and Chairman of the County Board. The Cork Convention at the end of 1987 witnessed the realisation of Denis Conroy’s dream. Forty-eight years after he first presented himself for election at the county board he achieved the office of chairman. He was 76 years old when the honour fell to him and had suffered a stroke that autumn but Conroy stood his ground against infirmity, as he did against everything else.\n\nDuring Conroy’s three years as chairman Cork won seven All Ireland titles but the double of 1990 conferred a unique distinction on him. Cork had won the double in 1890 and Tipperary had achieved it ten years later, but neither double had been done in the same calendar year and neither had been done under the same chairman.\n\nIn St Colman’s College Fermoy, he captained the Dr Harty Cup team and went on to play Fitzgibbon Cup for UCC. He also played in the senior championship for UCC in the days when students were bound to play for the college. He scored two goals on his senior championship debut for Carrig in 1937 and later that summer his goal was Carrig’s only score in the county ï¬nal against Glen Rovers.\n\nHe was Munster Council representative for 25 years and a Central Council delegate, was a member of GPC and a Congress delegate, did a stint as county board registrar and was made a vice-chairman of the board two years before he became chairman.

He was a member of the club Committee for thirty years, a delegate to the East Cork Board for more than twenty years, had been involved as a selector at various levels in the club, and had rarely missed a game, whether it was U12 or Premier Intermediate. He was a constant presence at Ahavine when the club was hosting a game and will be remembered for his involvement in the preparation of the playing field and the raising of the club flag, a flag of which he was so proud, and kept at his family home, where he also repaired hurleys for players of all ages.\n\nHaulie saw the club go through poor times, reaching numerous East Cork finals but failing to win and wondering whether he would ever see O’ Neill’s making the breakthrough. Haulie witnessed this breakthrough in 1996 when Dick O’ Neill raised the Jamsey Kelleher cup in Killeagh in what was the first of many firsts for the club. There was no prouder man the following Wednesday night at the East Cork Board meeting where it was and still is customary for the winners to address their fellow board delegates and representatives of the other clubs in the division. Haulie’s speech that night still rates as the most passionate speech ever at a board meeting. Ten years later, in 2006, even though having retired as a delegate, the club honoured Haulie by asking him to bring the All-Ireland Junior Hurling cup to the fortnightly board meeting. These would have been two of his proudest moments as a member of the club.\n\nAfter many years of involvement, Haulie was Vice-President of Fr. O’Neill’s club at the time of his death, August 6th 2010. He is survived by his wife Mary, daughter Carmel, and sons John and Gerard, who presented this cup to the County Board in 2012.\n\nGer O’Donovan Cup – Division 2 Hurling\n\nGer played hurling and football with Bandon and St Brogan’s College, Bandon, winning many honours in both jerseys.
