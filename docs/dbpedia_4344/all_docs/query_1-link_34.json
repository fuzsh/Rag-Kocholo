The championship ran from May to September of that year, culminating with the All-Ireland final, held at FitzGerald Stadium, Killarney on 5 September. The match was contested by Tipperary and Kilkenny, with Tipperary taking the title by 3-11 to 0-3. The prize for the winning team was the Liam McCarthy Cup.\n\nFormat\n\nThe All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship was run on a provincial basis as usual. All games were played on a knockout basis whereby once a team lost they were eliminated from the championship. The format for the All-Ireland series of games ran as follows:\n\n* The winners of the Munster Championship advanced directly to the All-Ireland final.\n\n* The winners of the Leinster Championship advanced directly to a lone All-Ireland semi-final.\n\n* Galway, a team who faced no competition in the Connacht Championship, entered the championship at the All-Ireland semi-final stage where they played the Leinster champions.\n\n* There were no representatives from the Ulster Championship in the All-Ireland series.\n\nAll-Ireland final\n\ntatistics\n\nfootballbox\n\ndate=1937-09-05\n\n15:15 BST\n\nteam1=Tipperary\n\nscore=3-11 &ndash; 0-3\n\nteam2=Kilkenny\n\nreport=\n\ngoals1=\n\ngoals2=\n\nstadium=FitzGerald Stadium, Killarney\n\nattendance=43,638\n\nreferee= J.
