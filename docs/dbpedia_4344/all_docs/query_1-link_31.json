Congratulations to all the winners who were lucky enough to be drawn out on the night.\n\n________________________________________\n\nSympathies\n\nIt was with sadness that we learned of the passing of former Tipperary player John Kelly last week. John wore the number 3 jersey when the Premier County defeated Kilkenny in the 1971 All-Ireland SHC final. He had previously won an Under 21 medal in 1967.\n\nJohn also won both a Fitzgibbon Cup medal and a Cork senior championship medal with UCC. A member of the Cappawhite club, he wrote his club’s history some years ago. John was a secondary teacher, and was very highly regarded all over Tipperary and beyond for his contribution both as a hurler, teacher and community worker.\n\nWe extend our sympathies to John’s wife Mary, sons Denis and Daniel, daughters Maureen, Margaret and Catherine, brothers Dick and Denis Martin and his sister Meta. May he Rest in Peace.\n\n________________________________________\n\nGAA Oral History – Jimmy Butler Coffey\n\nIn the next of our oral history features, we listen to Jimmy Coffey was a hurler for Tipperary minor team and then senior team from 1926 to 1947. In this interview, he explains the highlights and lowlights of being a county player at the time. He recalls some great stories of his time as a player and mentions Tipperary best successes in the 1930s such as the 1930 All-Ireland finals against Cork and the 1937 All-Ireland final against Kilkenny. He discusses the differences between hurling now and hurling in his childhood when he was playing with a crooked stick instead of a hurl. He also mentions playing against some of the best hurlers of that time like the Mackey brothers from Limerick and Paddy Phelan from Kilkenny. He also refers to events in Irish History, such as the Civil War and the Foot and Mouth outbreak of 1941, and how it had an impact on the county hurling team. The interview ends with Jimmy discussing his family involvement in the GAA.\n\nYou can listen to the full interview via the following link: https://www.gaa.ie/the-gaa/oral-history/jimmy-butler-coffey/\n\n________________________________________\n\nDermot Earley Youth Leadership Initiative\n\nThe GAA is currently seeking applications for the Dermot Earley Youth Leadership Initiative, which, in partnership with Foróige and The University of Galway, seeks to empower GAA members aged 15 to 18 years-old to make a positive difference in their club, county, and communities through values-based leadership.\n\nDuring the programme the young GAA members gain aptitudes in essential leadership skills in a safe and supportive environment.
