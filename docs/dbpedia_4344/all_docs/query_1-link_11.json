        "text": "üóìÔ∏è 1904\n\nCamogie Association was founded in Dublin on 25 February 1904.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1911\n\nCamogie Association was reconstituted as ‚ÄòCualacht Luithchleas na mBan Gaedheal‚Äò or Gaelic Athletic Company of Women.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1923\n\nCamogie Association was revived nationally in 1923.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1932\n\nFirst All-Ireland Camogie Championship took place in 1932 (Longford not involved).\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1934\n\nLongford‚Äôs first Camogie club was formed at a meeting in Temperance Hall in Longford town on 15th January 1934. The club was initially called St. Brigids (later changed to St. Itas) and first practice was announced for the Gaelic Grounds on 15th February. By the start of February a Camogie club had been established in Granard. Efforts ongoing in May to establish a Camogie club in Colmcille but the club was not formed until 1935.\n\nThe first recorded Camogie match in the County was Longford v Cavan at the Granard Sports day at Robinstown on 20th May. A Camogie club was established in Mullinalaghta in May and competed against Mullahoran that month. St. Itas (formerly St. Brigids) played their first game on 10th June against Carrick-on-Shannon, ending 1-0 each. The first inter-club game in Longford took place on 15th July (Mullinalaghta v St. Itas).\n\nThe first Camogie tournament in Longford was played on 30th September and hosted by the St. Itas club in Longford town and involved St. Itas, Mullinalaghta, Athlone and Carrick-on-Shannon. In the first game St. Itas lost to Carrick by 1-0 to nil and in the second game Athlone beat Mullinalaghta by 1-0 to nil. Carrick-on-Shannon won the final and the silver cup by 3-0 to nil.\n\nIn December, Longford Technical Schools team drew with Athlone in a friendly game.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1935\n\nLongford‚Äôs Camogie Board was formed in 1935 with M Brady (later Mrs. Twohig) as Chairperson and Val Hourican as Secretary. It is worth noting that Mrs. Val Hourican was later appointed Secretary of the Leinster Camogie Council towards the end of the 1930‚Äôs and held that position until 1941. She was also referee for inter-county Camogie games including a match at Croke Park.\n\nThe first Camogie game played in Edgeworthstown took place in April when the recently formed St. Kierans (Edgeworthstown) club played a friendly game against St. Itas (Longford). That same month Clonbroney played St. Itas in a friendly in Edgeworthstown which Clonbroney win 5-0 to nil. A Camogie tournament was played in Granard on 5th May involving St. Itas, Mullinalaghta, Clonbroney and the Technical Schools team with Mullinalaghta emerging as winners beating St. Itas in the final by 2-1 to 2-0 on 19th May. In July the St. Mels Camogie club was formed in Colmcille with the following committee elected: Captain: Bridie Mulooley, Vice Captain: Bride Martin, Treasurer: J.A. O‚ÄôHalloran and Secretary: Margaret Feeney.\n\nThese clubs are recorded in Senior Championship in 1935:\n\nClonbroney\n\nKillashee\n\nLanesboro\n\nMullinalaghta\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh)\n\nSt. Finians (Bracklin)\n\nSt. Itas (Longford)\n\nSt. Kierans (Edgeworthstown)\n\nSt. Mels (Colmcille)\n\nThe inaugural Longford Senior Championship began on Sunday 28th July 1935. The first round ties included Lanesboro v Killashee, St. Brigids v Clonbroney, Mullinalaghta v St. Mels and St. Kierans v St. Itas. On August 24th second round games were reported as follows: St. Brigids v Lanesboro, St. Itas v St. Finians, Mullinalaghta v Granard and Clonbroney v St. Mels. Clonbroney won their tie by 2-1 to 1-0, while St. Brigids v Lanesboro was not played due to rain. St. Itas beat St. Finians in the first Camogie match played at the Gaelic Grounds in Longford (now Pearse Park) to progress to the semi-finals. Mullinalaghta got a walk-over from Granard to progress to the semi-finals. Semi-final line-up was St. Itas vs Mullinalaghta and St. Brigids v Lanesboro. St. Ita‚Äôs beat Mullinalaghta by 1-0 to 0-0 while St. Brigids beat Lanesboro by 3-0 to 0-0.\n\nSt. Itas (Longford) won the üèÜ 1935 Senior Championship on Sunday 6th October, defeating St. Brigids (Ardagh) in the final by 2-1 to 0-0. The winning team included: T Magan (Captain), L Balfe, C Cameron, V Casey, M Brad, J Reilly, J Kelly, E Farrell, J Farrell, T Leonard, A O‚ÄôConnor and A Dollard. The losing team included: M McLoughlin (Captain), B McLoughlin, M Carney, B Carney, J Carney, M Cummins, K Cummins, A Ward, M.E. Casey, R Dalton, A Yorke and B Fallon.\n\nBallymahon Camogie club was formed in November (as part of the formation of a Gaelic Football and Camogie club in Ballymahon). During 1934 Mullinalaghta won the Granard Tournament while Technical Schools won the Feis Tournament. Worth noting that there were two Camogie clubs in the parish of Clonbroney, namely Clonbroney and Ballinalee.\n\nOn the County scene, Longford formed a County team in May 1935 to play inter-county friendly games ahead of playing Kilkenny in the Leinster Championship that year. The team was formed from the four affiliated clubs at the time, namely St. Itas, Technical Schools, Mullinalaghta and Clonbroney. Kilkenny were unable to field a team and Longford receive a walkover in the first round in June and pushed on to meet Dublin in the second round at Cusack Park, but suffered a heavy defeat. Longford played and beat Leitrim by 5 goals to 1 at the Aeridheacht in Cloone on 7th July.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1936\n\nConvention was held in January in Temperance Hall in Longford and attended by representatives from Edgeworthstown, St. Brigids (Ardagh), Clonbroney, St. Mels (Colmcille), St. Itas (Longford), Ballymahon, Technical Schools and St. Finians (Bracklin) clubs. The convention noted a credit balance of ¬£8. The following executive officers were elected: Chairperson: May Masterson, Vice-Chair: R Kiernan, Secretary: Val Casey, Treasurer: Nano Brady, Leinster Delegate: R Kiernan.\n\nA new Senior League competition was introduced in addition to the existing Senior Championship in 1936. One of the more interesting ties was Ballinalee vs Clonbroney in the first round in March 1936, both clubs from the same parish!\n\nThese 10 clubs are recorded in Senior competition in 1936:\n\nBallinalee\n\nBallymahon Tech\n\nCarrickedmond\n\nClonbroney\n\nKillashee\n\nMullinalaghta\n\nLanesboro (Rathcline)\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh)\n\nSt. Finians (Bracklin)\n\nSt. Itas (Longford)\n\nSt. Mels (Colmcille)\n\nTechnical Schools (Longford)\n\nCarrickedmond (Sionnacs) was formed during the year and competed in Championship but not League. Similarly Ballymahon Tech competed in Championship but not in League. In August 1936 the Ballinalee and Clonbroney clubs united to form a single Camogie Club called Se√°n Connollys, while St. Endas (Rathcline) was newly affiliated to become the second Camogie club in the parish of Rathcline. Mullinalaghta won the Granard Sports Tournament in September 1936 with 1-0 to nil victory over Clonbroney. Killashee wore colours of Saxe blue and white. Drumlish and Killoe formed Camogie clubs later in 1936, and both entered competition for the first time in 1937.\n\nSt. Finians (Bracklin) won the üèÜ 1936 Senior Championship with 3-1 to nil win over St. Endas (Rathcline) on 4th October.\n\nSt. Finians (Bracklin) won the üèÜ 1936 Senior League in the delayed decider which was eventually played on 21st February with St. Finians (Bracklin) beating St. Itas (Longford) by 3-0 to 1-0 at Bracklin. Referee: Martin Cummins (St. Brigids Ardagh). Both sides had ended the League on the same points, hence the deciding game was required to determine the destination of the League title.\n\nOn the County scene, Longford lost to Laois by 2-4 to nil in the Leinster Championship in Portlaoise on 19th April, while Longford played Westmeath in a friendly in Mullingar on Easter Monday losing by 3-1 to nil. Longford County team played in St. Itas colours and was represented by: L Martin (St. Mels), A Callaghan (St. Finians), T Leonard (Tech Schools), M Mullooly (Lanesboro), E Reilly (Mullinalaghta), B Reilly (Mullinalaghta), C Cameron (St. Itas), J Kelly (St. Itas), T Magan (St. Itas), B Carney (St. Brigids), B Dolan (Clonbroney).\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1937\n\nA new perpetual cup was presented to the Camogie Board by Mr. Se√°n Grogan of Technical Schools in Longford, to be used for the Senior League winner, and the club winning it for three consecutive seasons would be entitled to keep it. It was named the ‚ÄòGaelic Cup‚Äô.\n\nSt. Theresa‚Äôs (Carrickedmond) joined the list of Camogie clubs in Longford in February 1937 (in addition to Sionnacs club from the same parish). In Rathcline the St. Endas and Lanesboro clubs united to form St. Marys (Rathcline). The Granard club was revived in 1937 and competed in the 1937 Senior Championship along with Killoe, St. Itas (Longford), St. Finians (Bracklin), Sionnacs (Carrickedmond), St. Brigids (Ardagh), St. Theresas (Carrickedmond), Drumlish and St. Marys (Rathcline).\n\nThese clubs are recorded in Senior competition in 1937:\n\nDrumlish\n\nGranard\n\nKilloe\n\nSe√°n Connollys *\n\nSionnacs (Carrickedmond)\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh)\n\nSt. Finians (Bracklin)\n\nSt. Itas (Longford)\n\nSt. Marys (Rathcline)\n\nSt. Mels (Colmcille) *\n\nSt. Theresas (Carrickedmond)\n\n* Took part in Senior League only.\n\nSt. Finians (Bracklin) retained the üèÜ Senior Championship in 1937 with 2-0 to 0-0 win over St. Marys (Rathcline) on 3rd October at Pearse Park. The winning team was: A Callaghan (Captain), Margaret Farrelly, M Farrell, Mollie Farrelly, A McLoughlin, B Dolan, R Farrelly, C Cullen, M Rice, L Victory, M Victory, M.J. Hughes, A Farrell and T McCormack.\n\nSt. Itas (Longford) won the üèÜ 1937 Senior League (Gaelic Cup) beating St. Brigids (Ardagh) by 2-0 to 1-0 on 26th October and became the first holders of the new Gaelic Cup presented earlier in the year by Mr. Se√°n Grogan.\n\nThe County Convention was held in Bannon Memorial Hall on 12th December. Elected officers included: Chairperson: M Brady, Vice-Chairperson: Teresa Kenny, Secretary: Val Casey, Treasurer: Kathleen Timmins.\n\nA story which was attributed to the 1937 season was that of Paddy O‚ÄôShaughnessy, former member of Westmeath County Council, who had worked for a time as a barman in J.V. Donohoe‚Äôs in Granard and later married Mary Sheridan from Granard. Paddy was apparently approached to help make up the numbers (in disguise) for Mullinalaghta in a Camogie final. He duly took his place, played a great game and went home with a winners medal! While this had been assumed to be a Longford County Final, Mullinalaghta did not reach either a Championship or League final in the 1930‚Äôs. This was more likely a tournament final.\n\nOn the County scene, Longford played Meath in the opening round of the Leinster Championship, losing by 8-1 to 1-0 at Oldcastle.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1938\n\nThese clubs are recorded in Senior competition in 1938:\n\nDrumlish\n\nGranard\n\nKilloe\n\nSionnacs (Carrickedmond)\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh)\n\nSt. Finians (Bracklin)\n\nSt. Itas (Longford)\n\nSt. Mels (Colmcille)\n\nSt. Finians (Bracklin) won the üèÜ Senior Championship for the third year in a row in 1938, beating Sionnacs (Carrickedmond) by 3-0 to 0-0 on 9th October. Referee: Dympna McGlynn. On the same weekend Longford played Louth in an inter-county friendly with Louth winning 6-6 to 1-0.\n\nSionnacs (Carrickedmond) won the üèÜ 1938 Senior League (Gaelic Cup), beating St. Mels (Colmcille) by 2-0 to 1-0 in the final on 20th November. Sionnacs (Carrickedmond) had topped the South Division while St. Mels (Colmcille) topped the North Division, thus both contested the League final.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1939\n\nThe Camogie Association was reconstituted as Cumann Camogaiochta na nGael.\n\nSionnacs (Carrickedmond) won the üèÜ 1939 Senior Championship final the first time with 5-0 to 1-0 victory over St. Finians (Bracklin) in the final on 8th October at Pearse Park. Referee: Val Casey.\n\nSt. Itas (Longford) won the üèÜ 1939 Senior League title (Gaelic Cup) beating Killoe in the final by 4-2 to 4-0. The League final was played at Pearse Park during the Feis Naomh Mel on Sunday 24th June. Worth noting that St. Itas entered two teams (A and B) in the Senior League in 1939.\n\nOn the County scene, Longford lost to All-Ireland holders Dublin by 6-4 to 1-1 in the first round of the Leinster Championship on 7th May at Pearse Park and Dubln went on to retain the Leinster Championship, beating Kildare in the final by 3-2 to 2-2. The losing Longford team was: Joan Farrell (St. Itas), Tess Leonard (St. Itas), Phoebe McCormack (Sionnacs), Margaret Thompson (Sionnacs), Annie Yorke (St. Brigids), Dympna McGlynn (St. Itas), Ciss Dolan (Sionnacs), Margaret Leonard (St. Itas), Nellie Yorke (St. Brigids), Annie McLoughlin (St. Finians), Josie Reilly (St. Itas), Celia Kenny (Sionnacs). Subs: Margaret Farrell (St. Finians), Tot Magan (St. Itas), Bridget Leonard (St. Itas, 1-1), Janie Quinn (Killoe) and M Victory (St. Finians). The losers of the first round games competed in a Runner-up competition in which Longford played and beat Westmeath by 3-1 to 1-0 at Cusack Park on 16th July to progress in Leinster for the first time. Longford‚Äôs goals come from Josie Reilly (St. Itas), Annie McLoughlin (St. Finians) and Tot Magan (St. Itas) while Bridget Leonard scores Longford‚Äôs sole point. Ciss Dolan, Dympna McGlynn and Margaret Leonard were prominent for Longford in this historic first win in Leinster. Longford lost out to Meath by 3-0 to 1-1 in the next round on 17th September at Pearse Park. The match report cited how difficult it was to play Camogie on the long (uncut) grass and bemoans the lack of spectators which represented a major concern for the long-term success of the game in Longford.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1940\n\nThese clubs are recorded in Senior competition in 1940:\n\nKillashee\n\nKilloe\n\nSionnacs (Carrickedmond)\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh)\n\nSt. Itas (Longford)\n\nKillashee were awarded the üèÜ 1940 Senior Championship following an objection. Sionnacs (Carrickedmond) seemed to have retained their Senior Championship title, beating Killashee by 2-1 to 0-1 in the final on 23rd November. Referee: Mylo Brennan. Killashee then raised an objection on the basis that Sionnacs were late coming onto the field. In December that objection was upheld with referee report stating that Sionnacs were indeed 10 minutes late fielding. Hence the result was overturned. Sionnacs gave notice of their intention to appeal to the Leinster Council, but that was later withdrawn.\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh) were declared the üèÜ 1940 Senior League (Gaelic Cup). The 1940 League involved four teams: Killoe, Sionnacs, St. Brigids and St. Itas. The League final was due to be played on 15th December between St. Brigids (Ardagh) and Sionnacs (Carrickedmond), however no record found of the final being played. At the County Convention in March 1941 St. Brigids (Ardagh) were declared 1940 Senior League winners.\n\nOn the County scene, Longford lost to Westmeath by 6-0 to nil in the Leinster Championship on 26th May, having struggled to field a team after some players failed to show up. The Longford team wore a combination of St. Itas and St. Brigids colours.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1941\n\nAt the County Convention in March 1941, the following executive was elected: Chairperson: M Brady, Vice-Chair: Celia Kenny, Secretary: Val Hourican, Treasurer: Dympna McGlynn. The Convention also declared St. Brigids (Ardagh) as winners of the 1940 Senior League. Convention report mentioned that clubs such as Bracklin, Mullinalaghta and Rathcline were no longer active, while Drumlish and Tarmon clubs are mentioned in July 1941 (both asked to send delegates to County Board meeting) but no sign of either in competition. St. Brigids (Ardagh) were referred to in some reports as St. Patricks Ardagh, but this was likely a mix-up with the men‚Äôs team.\n\nThese clubs are recorded in Senior competition in 1941:\n\nKillashee\n\nKilloe\n\nSionnacs (Carrickedmond)\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh)\n\nSt. Itas (Longford)\n\nFixtures in late September 1941 showed St. Itas v Killoe (Referee: M Brennan) in the Senior Championship semi-final, and County Final scheduled for 12th October at Pearse Park with M Brennan as referee. In the semi-final Killoe were unable to field against St. Itas and the Killoe club folds soon thereafter.\n\nKillashee won the üèÜ 1941 Senior Championship, beating St. Itas (Longford) by 6-1 to 0-0 on Sunday 19th October.\n\nSt. Itas (Longford) won the üèÜ 1941 Senior League (Gaelic Cup), finishing the season unbeaten and top of the table with 16 points in mid October, ahead of Killashee (10), St. Brigids (6), Killoe (6) and Sionnacs (2). The Sionnacs club announced at the end of the League campaign that they would no longer be taking part in Camogie activity.\n\nNo record of any Leinster Championship activity for Longford in 1941.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1942\n\nStruggle to keep Camogie going in Longford in 1942 with petrol rationing made it impossible to fulfil fixtures.\n\nThese clubs are recorded as active in early 1942:\n\nKillashee\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh)\n\nSt. Itas (Longford)\n\nTarmon\n\nCompetition does not get underway and Camogie ceased in Longford and remained dormant until 1950‚Äôs.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1954\n\nFirst signs of a revival in Camogie in Longford in 1954.\n\nMarian Camogie club was formed in Ballinalee in April 1954 with blue and white colours.\n\nTeresa Davis of Our Lady‚Äôs Grammar School in Lurgan (later St. Michaels Grammar School and now St. Ronans College) was elected Chair of the Ulster Camogie Council. She was the niece of Miss C Leahy who was N.T. in Killashee at the time. Miss Davis was secretary and treasurer of the Armagh Camogie Board and her appointment meant she automatically became Vice-President of the Camogie Association. She lived in Legan for a while and received her primary education at the local Lenamore National School. At the same time that she was Chairperson of the Ulster Camogie Council, the Chairman of Ulster GAA was Rev Fr. Joseph Pettit whose father J Pettit (N.T.) resided in Lanesboro at the time.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1955\n\nBy December 1955 the Marian Camogie club in Ballinalee is noted has the only Camogie club in Longford that year.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1956\n\nThe County Board was re-established on 24th June 1956 for the first time since 1942, with representatives from Ardagh, Ballinalee, Killoe, Colmcille, Longford and Killashee. Executive officers: Chairperson: Val Hourican, Vice-Chair: A Farrell (Killoe), Secretary: Nora Mannix (Ballinalee) and Treasurer: Rose Donlon (St. Itas). Also in attendance as guests of honour are Miss Gaynor (Leinster Council), Miss Meade (Kildare Camogie) and Mr. Se√°n O‚ÄôDuffy (Camogie Organiser ‚Äì Leinster Council).\n\nThese clubs are recorded in Senior League in 1956:\n\nColmcille\n\nKilloe\n\nRathcline\n\nMarian (Ballinalee)\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh)\n\nSt. Itas (Longford)\n\nSt. Patricks (Killashee)\n\nMost of these clubs were revived having previously competed in 1930‚Äôs and early 1940‚Äôs, while Marian (Ballinalee) club was formed in 1954 and St. Patricks (Killashee) was formed in 1956. Carrickedmond and Kenagh also formed clubs during the year, but did not participate in competition.\n\nSt. Itas (Longford) won the üèÜ 1956 Senior League title by topping the table at the end of the season on 28th October with 10 points, ahead of Killoe (9), St. Patricks (9), Rathcline (7), St. Brigids (5) and Marian (3). Colmcille withdrew from the League in September after three rounds, due to lack of available players when the schools reopened. The winning St. Itas team included Ann Fitzmaurice, Marina McNulty, Pauline Gaffney, Kathleen Leavy, Annie Jo Farrell, Mary Rosehill, May Taughran, Ann Slowey, Ester Reehill (Captain), Mary Farrell, Celine Clarke, Maura Levinge, Dolores Clarke, Maeve Marsden, Sally Connolly, Margaret Marsden, Sally Connolly, Margaret Marsden, Mary Slowey, Shiela Keegan and Una Mitchell. Team trainer was Dick Eivers.\n\nThere is no record of any Longford Senior Championship taking place in 1956.\n\nKilloe hosted a tournament at Rhyne in October & November with St. Patricks (Killashee) beating Killoe in the final by 2-0 to 1-0. Referee: Se√°n McGoey. Tournaments were also hosted by St. Brigids (Ardagh) and St. Itas (Longford) clubs during 1956.\n\nThe Camogie Ashbourne Cup (equivalent of Fitzgibbon Cup) was won by UCG in 1956, captained by Rose McGrath from Longford.\n\nüóìÔ∏è 1957\n\nThe County Convention is held in December 1956 and the following executive officers are elected for 1957: Chairperson: Val Hourican, Vice-Chair: A Farrell (Killoe), Secretary: Nora Mannix (Ballinalee) and Treasurer: Rose Donlon (St. Itas). The St. Judes Camogie Club is formed in Clonguish during 1957 by Syl Murphy and Jim Brady. The club is first referenced in local media on 4th May as planning to enter a team in 1957 competition. St. Judes wore light brown gym-slips and saffron blouses.\n\nThese clubs are recorded in Senior competition in 1957:\n\nKenagh\n\nKilloe\n\nMarian (Ballinalee)\n\nRathcline\n\nSionnacs (Carrickedmond)\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh)\n\nSt. Itas (Longford)\n\nSt. Judes (Clonguish)\n\nSt. Patricks (Killashee)\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh) won the üèÜ 1957 Senior Championship, beating Sionnacs (Carrickedmond) by 6-0 to 0-0 in the final on 25th September. Scorers for Ardagh were K McKenna (2-0), Kathleen Farrell (1-0), F. Mulhaul (1-0), Mai Cox (1-0) and Kathleen Trautt (1-0). Others who were prominent for the winners were Anna Mae Keenan, Marie Keenan and Anna Mae Cahill. The McGrath and McNamara sisters as well as O Reilly and K McCormack, were best for Carrickedmond.\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh) appear to have won the üèÜ 1957 Senior League by topping the table at the end of the season. It was noted on 26th October that St. Brigids had recently registered their 21st consecutive win that season and were unbeaten during 1957. The League completed shortly thereafter.\n\nSt. Brigids (Ardagh) defeated Killoe in the Rathowen F√©is in June. St. Brigids (Ardagh) beat St. Judes (Clonguish) by 0-1 to 0-0 in the Ardagh Tournament final in September.
