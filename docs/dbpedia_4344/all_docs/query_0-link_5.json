For Gaelic football (women), see All-Ireland Senior Ladies' Football Championship.\n\nQuick facts for kids\n\nAll-Ireland Senior Football Championship Current season or competition:\n\n2024 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship\n\nLogo\n\nIrish Craobh Shinsir Peile na hÉireann Code Gaelic football Founded 1887; 137 years ago ( ) Region Ireland (31 teams)\n\nEngland (1 team)\n\nUnited States (1 team) (GAA) Trophy Sam Maguire Cup No. of teams 33 Title holders Armagh (2nd title) Most titles Kerry (38 titles) Sponsors Supervalu\n\nAllied Irish Bank\n\nAllianz TV partner(s) RTÉ, BBC Northern Ireland, Premier Sports, TG4\n\nThe All-Ireland Senior Football Championship (SFC) (Irish: Craobh Shinsir Peile na hÉireann) is the premier inter-county competition in Gaelic football. County teams compete against each other and the winner is declared All-Ireland Champions.\n\nOrganised by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), the championship has been contested every year except one since 1887.\n\nThe final is played by the 35th Sunday of the year at Croke Park in Dublin, with the winning team receiving the Sam Maguire Cup. For the majority of its existence, the All-Ireland Championship has been played on a straight knockout basis whereby once a team loses they are eliminated from the championship. In more recent years, the qualification procedures for the championship have changed several times. Currently, qualification is limited to teams competing in 6 feeder competitions; the finalists of the 4 provincial championships: Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster, the Tailteann Cup holders and the best non-qualified National Football League teams to make the 16 team group stage.\n\nThirty three teams currently participate in the All-Ireland Championship, with Kerry, Dublin, Galway and Cavan being the most successful teams in their respective provinces.\n\nThe title has been won by 19 different counties, 17 of whom have won the title more than once. The all-time record-holders are Kerry, who have won the championship on 38 occasions. Armagh are the current title holders, defeating Galway by 1–11 to 0–13 in the 2024 final.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first Championship to be held featured club teams who represented their respective counties after their county championship. The 21 a-side final was between Commercials of Limerick and Young Irelands of Louth. The final was played in Beech Hill, Donnybrook (not Bird Avenue) on 29 April 1888 with Commercials winning by 1–4 to 0–3. Unlike later All-Ireland competitions, there were no provincial championships, and the result was an open draw.\n\nThe second Championship was unfinished owing to the American Invasion Tour. The 1888 provincial championships had been completed (Tipperary, Kilkenny and Monaghan winning them; no Connacht teams entered) but after the Invasion tour returned, the All-Ireland semi-final and final were not played. English team London reached the final four times in the early years of the competition (1900–1903).\n\nIn 1892, inter-county teams were introduced to the All-Ireland Championship. Congress granted permission for the winning club to use players from other clubs in the county, thus the inter-county teams came into being. The rules of hurling and football were also altered: goals were made equal to five points, and teams were reduced from 21 to 17 a-side.\n\nThe 1903 Championship brought Kerry's first All-Ireland title. They went on to become the most successful football team in the history of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.\n\nUnlike in other European countries, such as neighbouring England, where annual sports events were cancelled during the twentieth century due to the First and Second World Wars, the All-Ireland Championship has been running continuously since 1887, with the final running since 1889 (the 1888 competition was played but no final was held due to the Invasion mentioned above). The competition continued even in spite of the effects on the country of the Civil War and the Second World War (the National Football League was not held during the latter). In 1941, the All-Ireland Championship was disrupted by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease but the postponed Leinster final were later rescheduled.\n\nThe duration of certain championship matches increased from 60 to 80 minutes during the 1970s. They were settled at 70 minutes after five seasons of this in 1975. This applied only to the provincial finals, All-Ireland semi-finals and finals.\n\nThe first half of the twentieth century brought the rise of several teams who won two or more All-Ireland titles in that period, such as Kildare, Mayo, Cavan, Wexford and Roscommon. In the 1990s, a significant sea change took place, as the All-Ireland was claimed by an Ulster team in four consecutive years (1991–1994). Since then Ulster has produced more All-Ireland winning teams than any other province.\n\nThe All-Ireland Qualifiers were introduced in 2001. Later that year, the 2001 final brought victory for Galway who became the first football team to win an All-Ireland by springing through \"the back door.\" In 2013, Hawk-Eye was introduced for Championship matches at Croke Park. It was first used to confirm that Offaly substitute Peter Cunningham's attempted point had gone wide 10 minutes into the second half of a game against Kildare. 2013 also brought the first Friday night game in the history of the Championship – a first round qualifier between Carlow and Laois.\n\nIn recent years further changes have been made to the structure of the championship. In 2018 the Super 8s were introduced, where the four provincial champions and the four-round 4 qualifier winners would be split into two groups of four teams. Each team plays their group rivals once, with the top two teams progressing to the All-Ireland Semi-Finals. In 2022 a two-tier format will be adopted for the championship. Division 3 and 4 teams from the National Football League that fail to reach a provincial final will not proceed to the All-Ireland qualifiers and will instead play in the Tailteann Cup.\n\nFormat history\n\nHistoric format (1888–2000)\n\nFor the first All-Ireland championship in 1887, the competition was played on an open draw knockout basis. From 1888, the provincial system was introduced, whereby the counties in each of Ireland's four provinces would play each other on a knockout basis to find provincial champions. These four champions would meet in the All-Ireland semi-finals. The structure outlined above was adopted in 2001 to allow more games to be played, but still retain provincial championships and the knockout structure, resulting in every game continuing to be a meaningful fixture, with no dead-rubber league format matches being played out.\n\nQuarter-finals format (2001–2017)\n\nFrom 2001 to 2017, the Championship was played using the Quarter-finals format. Under this format, Provincial matches would take place during the months of May, June and July. The winners of each of the four Provincial Championships would earn a place in the All-Ireland Quarter-Finals, which would take place in the month of August. Replays would be played for all drawn matches, not just drawn Provincial Finals and drawn All-Ireland Finals. Extra-time would only be used for Replays and Qualifier Matches. If the teams were still level after extra time, the qualifier match would go to a replay or in the case of replays, another replay would take place.\n\nThe qualifiers series (also referred to as the \"back door\") for teams that did not win their provincial championships would take place in the months of June and July with the winning four teams of Round 4 playing the four Provincial Champions in the All-Ireland Quarter Finals.\n\nAll-Ireland Quarter-Finals: The four Provincial Champions would be drawn against the winning four teams from Round 4 of the All-Ireland Qualifiers. If a match finished with both teams level, a replay would take place. The four winning teams qualify for the All-Ireland Semi-Finals.\n\nAll-Ireland Semi-Finals: The All-Ireland Semi-Finals would take place in August and be contested by the four winners of the All-Ireland Quarter Finals. If a match ended with both teams level, a replay would take place. The two winning teams qualify for the All-Ireland Final.\n\nAll-Ireland Final: The two remaining teams would meet in the All-Ireland Final, usually on the third Sunday in September. The winning team is crowned All-Ireland Champions.\n\nSingle-tier championship format (2018–2019)\n\nThis championship was identical to the format above, though with no second-tier championship all teams who failed to win their provincial final were eligible to play in the qualifiers. The qualifiers took place over four rounds rather than two, and the four winners of the fourth round proceeded to the All-Ireland Super 8s. As in the format above, the further a team progressed in their provincial championships the later the round they entered the qualifiers. The All-Ireland Super 8s were a round-robin group stage, featuring four teams placed into two groups. The two-highest ranked teams from each group were drawn into an All-Ireland Semi-final, which was followed by the All-Ireland Final.\n\nReturn to single-elimination format (2020–2022)\n\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 and 2021 championships returned to the historic single-elimination format. Teams that were eliminated in their provincial championships did not access the qualifiers, which were cancelled, and the \"Super 8's\" were removed in favour of a straight-knockout semi-final and final. In 2022 a smaller back door system took place then Knockout (2001–2017) or Super 8 (2018–2019).\n\nIntegration with the league and Tailteann Cup (2023–)\n\nIn 2023, the format of the championship was again altered. Under this system, approved at a Special Congress of the GAA in February 2022, the results in the National Football League (held in January through to March of each year) would have an impact on counties' progression in the championship. After the conclusion of the four provincial championships, whose structures remain unaltered, there would be a round-robin competition for 16 teams, split evenly into four. The groups would be made up of the four provincial champions and four runners-up, joined by a further eight teams based on their overall ranking from the league. The four group winners would automatically qualify for the All-Ireland Quarter Finals, and the four remaining spots in the quarter-finals are determined by playoff-matches between the second and third placed teams. The quarter finals, semi-finals and final are then played under the traditional single-elimination format. Furthermore, the 16 teams that fail to qualify for the round-robin stage would compete in the second-tier Tailteann Cup, which is also played via round-robin groups and single-elimination finals.\n\nFormat\n\nCounties\n\nSee also: County (Gaelic games)\n\nThe county is a geographical region in Ireland, and each of the thirty-two counties in Ireland organise their own Gaelic games affairs through a County Board. The county teams play in their respective Provincial Championships (reflective of the four Irish provinces) in Connacht (which also includes teams from London and New York), Leinster, Munster, and Ulster. Kilkenny is currently unique among the 32 Irish county associations in not participating in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. The Provincial Championships operate through a knock-out cup competition format.\n\nProvincial championships\n\nConnacht Championship (Seven teams)\n\nQuarter-finals (3 matches): These are three matches between the first six teams drawn – the other team receive a bye.

Championship finals\n\nTypically, over the four Sundays of September, All-Ireland Finals in men's football, ladies' football, hurling and camogie take place at Croke Park, the national stadium of the GAA. Two grades are played on each final day, the senior team and the minor team (consisting of younger players, under the age of 18, who have participated in that year's All-Ireland Minor Football Championship). Guests who attend these events include the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach and other important dignitaries. The football final is considered the pinnacle event of this period.\n\nThe final game of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship takes place on the third Sunday of September. The men's decider regularly attracts crowds of over 80,000. The winning team captain receives the Sam Maguire Cup. The current champions are Kerry.\n\nDue to COVID-19 and the related State restrictions, the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final was staged on Saturday, 19 December, two weeks after the semi-finals.\n\nFor the first time since 2000, the football championship was a sudden-death scenario, while the hurling championship – completed on Sunday, 13 December – contained a backdoor format.\n\nRoll of Honour\n\nMain article: All-Ireland Senior Football Championship records and statistics\n\nPerformance by county\n\nCounty Title(s) Runners-up Winning years Losing years Kerry 38 24 1903, 1904, 1909, 1913, 1914, 1924, 1926, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1937, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1946, 1953, 1955, 1959, 1962, 1969, 1970, 1975, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2014, 2022 1892, 1905, 1910, 1915, 1923, 1927, 1938, 1944, 1947, 1954, 1960, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1982, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2015, 2019, 2023 Dublin 31 13 1891, 1892, 1894, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1901, 1902, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1942, 1958, 1963, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1983, 1995, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2023 1896, 1904, 1920, 1924, 1934, 1955, 1975, 1978, 1979, 1984, 1985, 1992, 1994 Galway 9 15 1925, 1934, 1938, 1956, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1998, 2001, 1919, 1922, 1933, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1959, 1963, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1983, 2000, 2022, 2024 Cork 7 16 1890, 1911, 1945, 1973, 1989, 1990, 2010 1891, 1893, 1894, 1897, 1899, 1906, 1907, 1956, 1957, 1967, 1987, 1988, 1993, 1999, 2007, 2009 Meath 7 9 1949, 1954, 1967, 1987, 1988, 1996, 1999 1895, 1939, 1951, 1952, 1966, 1970, 1990, 1991, 2001 Cavan 5 6 1933, 1935, 1947, 1948, 1952 1925, 1928, 1937, 1943, 1945, 1949 Wexford 5 3 1893, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918 1890, 1913, 1914 Down 5 1 1960, 1961, 1968, 1991, 1994 2010 Kildare 4 5 1905, 1919, 1927, 1928 1926, 1929, 1931, 1935, 1998 Tyrone 4 3 2003, 2005, 2008, 2021 1986, 1995, 2018 Tipperary 4 1 1889, 1895, 1900, 1920 1918 Mayo 3 15 1936, 1950, 1951 1916, 1921, 1932, 1948, 1989, 1996, 1997, 2004, 2006, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2020, 2021 Offaly 3 3 1971, 1972, 1982 1961, 1969, 1981 Louth 3 3 1910, 1912, 1957 1887, 1909, 1950 Roscommon 2 3 1943, 1944 1946, 1962, 1980 Armagh 2 3 2002, 2024 1953, 1977, 2003 Donegal 2 1 1992, 2012 2014 Limerick 2 0 1887, 1896 – Derry 1 1 1993 1958 London 0 5 – 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1908 Laois 0 2 – 1889, 1936 Antrim 0 2 – 1911, 1912 Waterford 0 1 – 1898 Clare 0 1 – 1917 Monaghan 0 1 – 1930\n\na.

As of 2023, Kerry has won the competition on 38 occasions, winning in four consecutive years twice (1929–1932 and 1978–1981) and also for three consecutive years twice (1939–1941 and 1984–1986). Dublin follows Kerry on the competition roll of honour with 31 wins, although up to the 1950s much of the success of Dublin teams was based on teams who had many non-Dublin born players playing.\n\nDublin joined the four in a row club in 2018 by winning the competition consecutively since 2015. As of 2019, Dublin became the first team to win the competition five times in a row. And in 2020, Dublin won a sixth consecutive title. Galway were the first team from the western province of Connacht to win an All-Ireland title, doing so in 1925. The 1933 final brought victory for Cavan, who became the first team from the northern province of Ulster to win an All-Ireland title.\n\nTwo teams have won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship as part of a double with that year's All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, namely Cork (1890 and 1990) and Tipperary (1895 and 1900). The championship has never been won by a team from outside Ireland, though London have played in five finals.\n\nArmagh are the reigning champions, winning their second ever title, having defeated Galway in the 2024 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final.\n\nTeam records and statistics\n\nMain article: All-Ireland Senior Football Championship records and statistics\n\nTeam results (since the introduction of Tailteann Cup)\n\nLegend\n\n1st – Champions\n\n2nd – Runners-up\n\nSF – Semi-finals\n\nQF/PQF – Quarter-finals/Preliminary quarter-finals\n\nR2/R1/GS – Round 2/Round 1/Group stage\n\nTC – Tailteann Cup\n\nFor each year, the number of teams (in brackets) are shown.\n\nTeam 2022 (16) 2023 (16) 2024 (16) Years Armagh QF QF 3 Cavan TC TC GS 1 Clare QF GS GS 3 Cork QF QF PQF 3 Derry SF SF QF 3 Donegal R2 PQF SF 3 Dublin SF 1st QF 3 Galway 2nd PQF 3 Kerry 1st 2nd SF 3 Kildare R2 PQF TC 2 Limerick R2 TC TC 1 Louth R1 GS QF 3 Mayo QF QF PQF 3 Meath R1 TC GS 2 Monaghan R1 SF PQF 3 Roscommon R2 PQF QF 3 Sligo TC GS TC 1 Tyrone R1 QF PQF 3 Westmeath TC GS GS 2\n\nDebut of counties\n\nYear Debutants Total 1887 Clare, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Louth, Meath, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow 12 1888 Cavan, Kildare, Laois, Monaghan 4 1889 Kerry 1 1890 Antrim, Armagh, Tyrone, Westmeath 4 1891 None 0 1892 Roscommon 1 1893–1895 None 0 1896 Offaly 1 1897 Carlow 1 1898–1899 None 0 1900 London 1 1901 Mayo 1 1902 None 0 1903 Fermanagh, Longford 2 1904 Derry, Down 2 1905 Sligo 1 1906 Donegal, Leitrim 2 1907–1998 None 0 1999 New York 1 2000–present None 0 Total 34\n\nPlayer records\n\nMain article: All-Ireland Senior Football Championship records and statistics\n\nPlayer of the year\n\nYear Player County 2023 David Clifford Kerry 2022 David Clifford Kerry 2021 Kieran McGeary Tyrone 2020 Brian Fenton Dublin 2019 Stephen Cluxton Dublin 2018 Brian Fenton Dublin 2017 Andy Moran Mayo 2016 Lee Keegan Mayo 2015 Jack McCaffrey Dublin 2014 James O'Donoghue Kerry\n\nAll-time appearances\n\nRank Player Team Appearances Year 1 Stephen Cluxton Dublin 111 2001–present 2 Seán Cavanagh Tyrone 89 2002–2017 3 Marc Ó Sé Kerry 88 2002–2015 4 Tomás Ó Sé Kerry 88 1998–2013 5 Colm Cooper Kerry 85 2002–2016 6 Andy Moran Mayo 84 2004–2019 7 Darragh Ó Sé Kerry 81 1997–2010 8 Ross Munnelly Laois 79 2003–2022 9 Aidan O'Shea Mayo 78 2009–present 10 Tom O'Sullivan Kerry 76 2000–2011\n\nChampionship Tiers\n\nTitle Holders\n\nCompetition Year Champions Title Runners-up Next edition All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 2024 Armagh 2nd Galway 2025 Connacht Senior Football Championship 2024 Galway 50th Mayo 2025 Leinster Senior Football Championship 2024 Dublin 63rd Louth 2025 Munster Senior Football Championship 2024 Kerry 85th Clare 2025 Ulster Senior Football Championship 2024 Donegal 11th Armagh 2025 Tailteann Cup 2024 Down 1st Laois 2025 All-Ireland Junior Football Championship 2024 New York 2nd London 2025\n\n2024 Tiers\n\nChampionship County team Province All-Ireland SFC Armagh Ulster Cavan Ulster Clare Munster Cork Munster Derry Ulster Donegal Ulster Down Ulster Dublin Leinster Galway Connacht Kerry Munster Kildare Leinster Louth Leinster Mayo Connacht Meath Leinster Monaghan Ulster Offaly Leinster Roscommon Connacht Tyrone Ulster Westmeath Leinster Tailteann Cup Antrim Ulster Carlow Leinster Fermanagh Ulster Laois Leinster Leitrim Connacht Limerick Munster London Britain Longford Leinster New York North America Sligo Connacht Tipperary Munster Waterford Munster Wexford Leinster Wicklow Leinster All-Ireland JFC Gloucestershire Britain Hertfordshire Britain Kilkenny Leinster Lancashire Britain London (2nd team) Britain New York (2nd Team) North America Scotland Britain USGAA North America Warwickshire Britain Yorkshire Britain\n\nSee also\n\nIn Spanish: All-Ireland Football Championship para niños"
