        "text": "Junior Football Championship began in 1905 with Longford competing from 1906. Longford conceded the 1909 tie and did not compete in 1910 or 1912 or 1916. Junior grade was discontinued from 1917 to 1920 with Longford competing at Senior grade during those years. In 1921 Longford was not permitted to enter competition but was back in Leinster JFC from 1922. In 1926 Longford did not compete in JFC due to being expelled from the organisation following a dispute. There was no competition from 1943-1945. Longford did not compete in 1973 and there was no competition from 1974 to 1989. In 1994 Central Council issued a ruling preventing the use of the county’s second-best team in JFC competition, hence Longford did not compete from 1994-2001. Longford also did not compete from 2003-2008. Longford last competed in Junior Football Championship in 2019. There was no competition in 2020 or 2021 due to Covid-19. At GAA Congress in 2021, a motion was passed to change the structure of the Junior Football Championship to that of a mostly ‘overseas’ competition along with just one Irish county, Kilkenny. Today’s Junior Football Championship includes Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire, Kilkenny, Lancashire, London B, New York B, Scotland, Warwickshire & Yorkshire.\n\nLongford played 130 games in Junior Football Championship, Won 53 (41%), Drew 7 (5%) and Lost 70 (54%).\n\nDateJunior Football Championship Details 04/02/1906Leinster JFC -
