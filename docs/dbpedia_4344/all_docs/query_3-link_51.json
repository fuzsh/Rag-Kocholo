        "text": "The Belfast team dominated for several years. Gaedhil Uladh, Deirdre and St Teresa's flew the South Antrim flag. In 1946 Dunloy brought the coveted 'O'Duffy cup' to the Glens, with neighbouring rivals, Loughgiel claiming their first crown in 1947.\n\nA new Senior Open Draw format appeared in 1948 when Ahoghill overturned the previous years final defeat by the Shamrock club.\n\nIt changed hands again going back to Dunloy in ' 49 only to be eclipsed for four years in a row by the girls next door taking home three and St. Teresa's claiming the famous title for South Antrim.\n\nA new name on the cup came in 1954 and ' 55 with St Malachy's who defeated Dunloy in both County finals.\n\nThe roles were reversed in ' 56 with the first of a hat trick for the Cuchcullainn club. North Antrim claimed the laurals once more with Loughgiel breaking the monopoly...if only temperarily in 1959 only to relinquish the title to the big two of the time as Dunloy and St Malachy's claiming a title a piece in 1960 and ' 61.\n\nDEIRDRE DOMINATE 7-IN-A-ROW!\n\nDeirdre re-emerged in 1962 in devastating fashion and for seven years on the trot, took Antrim's top accolade reigning supreme until 1968.\n\nDuring this period the Ulster Club Championship came into play. Deirdre etched their name on the cup in it's inaugural year in 1964...a title they won for five unbroken seasons.\n\nIn 1969 Ahoghill put the defending champions out in the first round, going on to win their second Antrim club title bridging a gap of twenty-one years.\n\n1969 was also the beginning of one of the darkest periods in Ulsters political turmoil as ' The Troubles' tore at the heart of a community and clubs folded never to return.\n\nAn example of the time was the Sean Treacy's club. Three players were interned, one ( Dorothy Maguire) was shot dead by British Troops and the families of countless others were forced to flee across the Boarder.\n\nPORTGLENONE...PRIDE OF THE BANN\n\nNot surprisingly then, as battles raged in Belfast, the next thirteen years were dominated by the country based clubs.\n\nPortglenone emerged a dominant force winning nine titles with Creggan winning four in 1970,1973, 1976 and 1980.\n\nLoughgiel broke the big two hold in 1975.\n\nThe Shamrocks returned to the top with a double in 1984 and ' 85 and in the following two years Cushendall and then Ardoyne after their fourth final appearance were crowned for the first time...Senior Champions.\n\nThe Bannsiders were back in 1988 after which the legendary Mairead McAtamney bowed out of competitive camogie.\n\nThe beginning of an historic club hat-trick awaited Loughgiel in 1989 and Portglenone claimed the last of their eleven titles in 1992."
