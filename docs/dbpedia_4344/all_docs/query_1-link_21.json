        "text": "Clare defeated Cork by 3-29 to 1-34 after extra time in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final on Sunday July 21st at Croke Park.\n\nMatch Highlights\n\nAll-Ireland SHC Final: Clare win epic encounter\n\nClare 3-29 Cork 1-34\n\nReport By Cian O’Connell for GAA.ie\n\nOne of the greatest ever All-Ireland SHC deciders, eventually concluded with Tony Kelly climbing the Hogan Stand steps to collect the Liam MacCarthy Cup.\n\nA compelling contest, that raged with intensity from first whistle until last, ended in a Clare triumph. Defiant until the bitter end, Brian Lohan’s charges prevailed.\n\nCork brought similar industry and passion, but Clare, inspired by the brilliance of captain Kelly, triumphed.\n\nKelly’s 1-4 was crucial for Clare, who overcame a shaky start to earn a first All-Ireland since 2013. Eleven years ago against the same opposition Kelly starred, and on this occasion some of his imaginative interventions decided a game for the ages.\n\nWhere do you start? Cork’s blistering opening? Clare’s gritty revival? Kelly’s genius? Patrick Horgan’s ice cool composure? John Conlon’s leadership? Those were only some of the issues peppering the conversations before extra-time. Then further drama unfolded.\n\nA burst of four points without reply in the second period of extra-time carried significant weight. It was sufficient to get Clare over the line. Just about because Cork posed questions in the dying embers themselves. Clare stayed resourceful and resilient.\n\nInitially, everything was going so smoothly for Cork. Inside 15 minutes Cork had struck nine shots, accumulating 1-8. It was razor sharp stuff from Pat Ryan’s team, who led 1-8 to 0-4 following Mark Coleman’s splendid point.\n\nThe goal, a sensational effort, from Rob Downey had arrived in the 12th minute. Downey gathered a Clare puck out before embarking on a mammoth run from deep, the finish was equally sweet.\n\nCork’s blistering beginning was reflected on the scoreboard, 1-7 to 0-3. Aidan McCarthy and Coleman traded scores, and it was subsequently Clare’s turn to enjoy a productive spell.\n\nClare’s mission was boosted by a 17th minute McCarthy major following inventive work by Shane O’Donnell, who manufactured space. O’Donnell rifled over a couple of points and David Fitzgerald trimmed the deficit to the minimum 1-8 to 1-7 in the 22nd minute.\n\nHorgan drilled over a couple of frees as Cork pulled three clear again, but Clare were gutsy. McCarthy, Rodgers, and David Reidy all nailed points to edge the Banner in front on the cusp of half-time.\n\nDarragh Fitzgibbon mustered a reply to ensure the teams departed deadlocked, 1-12 each at the interval. Gripping it most certainly was.\n\nAfter the restart it remained keenly contested and thrilling, in equal measure. A gorgeous Tim O’Mahony point steered Cork 1-15 to 1-14 ahead, but then Clare pounced.\n\nMark Rodgers’ supplied a splendid 40th minute goal, but Cork were back trading on terms, 2-14 to 1-17, as Alan Connolly and O’Mahony struck points.\n\nReidy and Horgan swapped scores ensuring the teams were level again, 2-15 to 1-18, when Kelly returned to centre stage. Kelly’s third goal was a perfect cocktail of skill and speed in the 51st minute.\n\nFour of the next five points were scored by Cork with Séamus Harnedy restoring parity on 58, but it ebbed and flowed. Fitzgerald, Rodgers, substitute Ryan Taylor, and Diarmuid Ryan contributed scores for Clare, who were 3-20 to 1-23 clear with six minutes of normal time left.\n\nHorgan (free) and Coleman trimmed the deficit once more. With the issue delicately poised, Horgan slotted over a pressure free. It continued to blaze, though, as Kelly fired over a remarkable over the shoulder point to nudge Clare one to the good. Cork needed a response with Horgan clipping the equaliser, 3-21 to 1-27 meaning extra-time was necessary.\n\nReinforcements were required with substitutes Ian Galvin and Shane Kingston swapping points. Aidan McCarthy, who returned to the fray for Clare, put Clare ahead, but Coleman and Kingston replied. It was that sort of encounter with the teams deadlocked, 3-25 to 1-31 at the end of the first period of extra-time.\n\nRobbie O’Flynn guided Cork into the lead, but then a crucial spell occurred. McCarthy (2), Kelly, and Shane Meehan thumped over vital points for Clare. During that stint O’Flynn had a goal attempt thwarted by Eibhear Quilligan too.\n\nIn the closing seconds Horgan rifled over two frees, and O’Flynn sent a last gasp effort narrowly wide as Clare, with Conor Leen effective, held out for an immensely satisfying success. Within seconds Lohan was being chaired by members of his backroom. It is an image Clare supporters will cherish forever.\n\nCup Presentation to Clare Captain Tony Kelly\n\nScorers for Clare: Aidan McCarthy 1-7 (3fs, 1 65), Tony Kelly 1-4, Mark Rodgers 1-3, Diarmuid Ryan and David Fitzgerald 0-3 each, Shane O’Donnell, David Reidy and Peter Duggan (1 sideline) 0-2 each, Shane Meehan, Ian Galvin, and Ryan Taylor 0-1 each.\n\nScorers for Cork: Patrick Horgan 0-12 (10fs), Séamus Harnedy 0-4, Rob Downey 1-0, Mark Coleman and Tim O’Mahony 0-3 each, Shane Barrett, Darragh Fitzgibbon Brian Hayes, and Shane Kingston 0-2 each, Robbie O’Flynn, Eoin Downey, Ciarán Joyce, and Alan Connolly 0-1 each.\n\nClare: Eibhear Quilligan; Conor Leen, Adam Hogan, Conor Cleary; Diarmuid Ryan, John Conlon, David McInerney; Tony Kelly, Cathal Malone; Peter Duggan, Shane O’Donnell, David Fitzgerald; Mark Rodgers, Aidan McCarthy, David Reidy.\n\nSubs: Darragh Lohan for Malone (37-38), Ryan Taylor for McCarthy (55), Ian Galvin for Reidy (59), Aron Shanagher for Duggan (66), Darragh Lohan for Cleary (70+1), Robin Mounsey for Rodgers (70+3), Aidan McCarthy for Mounsey (ET), Cian Galvin for Ryan (80), Shane Meehan for O’Donnell (80), Seadna Morey for Malone (87).\n\nCork: Patrick Collins; Niall O’Leary, Eoin Downey, Seán O’Donoghue; Mark Coleman, Ciarán Joyce, Rob Downey; Tim O’Mahony, Darragh Fitzgibbon; Declan Dalton, Shane Barrett, Séamus Harnedy; Brian Hayes, Alan Connolly, Patrick Horgan.\n\nSubs: Shane Kingston for Hayes (43-47), Ethan Twomey for Dalton (48), Jack O’Connor for Connolly (64), Shane Kingston for Barrett (66), Robbie O’Flynn for Harnedy (68), Tommy O’Connell for R Downey (70+4), Ger Mellerick for O’Donoghue (79), Damien Cahalane for O’Leary (HT, ET), Luke Meade for O’Mahony (85).\n\nReferee: Johnny Murphy (Limerick).\n\nTeam News\n\nCork: Patrick Collins; Niall O’Leary, Eoin Downey, Seán O’Donoghue; Ciarán Joyce, Robert Downey, Mark Coleman; Tim O’Mahony, Darragh Fitzgibbon; Declan Dalton, Shane Barrett, Séamus Harnedy; Patrick Horgan, Alan Connolly, Brian Hayes.\n\nSubs: Brion Saunderson, Damien Cahalane, Ger Millerick, Tommy O’Connell, Luke Meade, Ethan Twomey, Conor Lehane, Jack O’Connor, Shane Kingston, Padraig Power, Robbie O’Flynn.\n\nClare: Eibhear Quilligan; Adam Hogan, Conor Cleary, Conor Leen; Diarmuid Ryan, John Conlon, David McInerney; David Fitzgerald, Cathal Malone; Tony Kelly, Mark Rodgers, Peter Duggan; Aidan McCarthy, Shane O’Donnell, David Reidy.\n\nSubs: Cian Broderick, Rory Hayes, Paul Flanagan, Cian Galvin, Darragh Lohan, Ryan Taylor, Seadna Morey, Aron Shanagher, Ian Galvin, Shane Meehan, Robin Mounsey.\n\nSouvenir Match Programme\n\nALL SET FOR SHOWPIECE GAME OF BRILLIANT HURLING SEASON\n\nAfter thirty-three games over fourteen drama-filled weeks, it’s down to the last two in the GAA hurling All-Ireland champi-onships. Step forward, Clare and Cork for an All-Ireland final that promises to provide a fitting climax to what has been an outstanding season. It throws in at 3.30 in Croke Park on Sunday and will be refereed by Johnny Murphy (Limerick).\n\nCork and Clare last met in the All-Ireland final in 2013 when the Banner boys won a replay. That was also the last time that neither the Leinster nor Munster champions reached the final. Clare reached this year’s Munster final, losing to Limerick; Cork finished third in the Munster round robin. Cork are bidding for their 31st All-Ireland win while Clare will attempt to win their fifth crown. This will be the eighth time that a team that didn’t win a provincial title went on to win the All-Ireland title later in the season. The previous winners through this route were Offaly 1998, Cork 2004, Tipperary 2010, Kilkenny 2012, Clare 2013, Limerick 2018, Tipperary 2019.\n\nHOW THEY REACHED THE FINAL\n\nCLARE\n\nLimerick 3-15 Clare 1-18 (Munster round robin)\n\nClare 3-26 Cork 3-24 (Munster round robin)\n\nClare 4-21 Waterford 2-26 (Munster round robin)\n\nClare 1-24 Tipperary 0-24 (Munster round robin)\n\nLimerick 1-26 Clare 1-20 (Munster final)\n\nClare 2-28 Wexford 1-19 (All-Ireland quarter-final)\n\nClare 0-24 Kilkenny 2-16 (All-Ireland semi-final)\n\nWon 5, Lost 2\n\nTOP SCORERS\n\nA McCarthy……..1-53 (0-41 frees, 0-1 ‘65’))\n\nM Rodgers……….2-23 (0-11 frees, 0-1 ‘65’, 0-1 s/l)\n\nD Fitzgerald………2-18\n\nS O’Donnell………2-13\n\nT Kelly………………1-16 (0-3 frees)\n\nP Duggan………….1-7\n\nD Ryan……………..1-7\n\nCORK\n\nWaterford 2-25 Cork 1-25 (Munster round robin) Clare 3-26 Cork 3-24 (Munster round robin) Cork 3-28 Limerick 3-26 (Munster round robin) Cork 4-30 Tipperary 1-21 (Munster round robin)\n\nCork 4-25 Offaly 3-19 (All-Ireland preliminary quarter-final)\n\nCork 0-26 Dublin 0-21 (All-Ireland quarter-final)\n\nCork 1-28 Limerick 0-29 (All-Ireland semi-final)\n\nWon 5, Lost 2\n\nTOP SCORERS\n\nP Horgan……4-62 (1-46 frees, 1-0 pen, 0-4 ‘65s’)\n\nA Connolly…..4-12 (0-2 frees)\n\nD Fitzgibbon…0-22\n\nS Barrett………2-16\n\nD Dalton……….0-21 (0-11 frees)\n\nS Harnedy……..1-16\n\nB Hayes………….2-11\n\nLAST TEN CHAMPIONSHIP MEETINGS\n\n2024: Clare 3-26 Cork 3-24 (Munster round robin)\n\n2023: Clare 2-22 Cork 3-18 (Munster round robin)\n\n2022: Clare 0-28 Cork 2-20 (Munster round robin)\n\n2021: Cork 3-19 Clare 1-23 (All-Ireland qualifiers)\n\n2019: Clare 2-23 Cork 2-18 (Munster ‘round robin)\n\n2018: Cork 2-23 Clare 1-21 (Munster ‘round robin’)\n\n2017: Cork 1-25 Clare 1-20 (Munster final)\n\n2015: Cork 0-20 Clare 0-17 (All-Ireland qualifier)\n\n2014: Cork 2-23 Clare 2-18 (Munster semi-final)\n\n2013: Clare 5-16 Cork 3-16 (All-Ireland final) Replay\n\nClare 5 Cork 5\n\n*This will be the 62nd championship meeting between the counties, with Cork leading 40-16 in wins while there have been five draws in the previous 61.\n\n*Clare and Cork have met 18 times in the championship since 2000.
