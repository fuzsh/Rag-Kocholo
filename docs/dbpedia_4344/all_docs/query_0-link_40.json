        "text": "Kerry crush Tipperary to cruise into Munster semis\n\nReport from the GAA.ie web site\n\nMunster GAA Football Championship Quarter-Final: Kerry 2-19 Tipperary 0-8\n\nKerry matched the weekend performance of their great rivals Cork on Sunday, by hammering Tipperary and cruising into the Munster Championship semi-finals. Cork were 18-point winners over Limerick at the Gaelic Grounds on Saturday evening, and Kerry were equally dominant against Tipperary, cruising to a 17-point win at a sedate Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney. Kerry led by seven at the break, and following James O’Donoghue’s superb goal 30 seconds after the restart, the lead was 10. The sending-off of Tipperary forward Barry Grogan in the second half opened the door for further Kerry supremacy, and they racked up an impressive final tally of 2-19. Kerry will now play Waterford in the Munster semi-final next Saturday evening.\n\nKerry led 0-11 to 0-4 at half-time, and thoroughly deserved the seven-point lead after a very dominant opening 35 minutes. They powered out of the blocks, and had four points on the board within eight minutes. Colm Cooper, who was very influential throughout from the forty, got the first, and it was followed by efforts from Johnny Buckley (free), O’Donoghue and Donnacha Walsh. Kerry eased off a tad in the middle third of the first half, and Tipperary were closer to them on the scoreboard than they should have been after 25 minutes, trailing 0-6 to 0-3, with all three of the Tipperary points coming from placed balls from Barry Grogan. Once Kerry realised that complacency had set in a bit, they upped their game significantly for the remainder of the half, and crucially made it count on the scoreboard.\n\nThey kicked five points in an eight minute spell towards the end of the half, and what was most encouraging for manager Éamonn Fitzmaurice was the way the scoring was spread throughout their team, and almost exclusively from play. Anthony Maher, Kieran Donaghy, Tomás Ó Sé and Paul Galvin (2) all got in on the scoring act before the break, and all of those points were well-taken efforts efficiently finished at the end of intelligent Kerry moves. Tipperary failed to score from play in the first half, a fitting reflection of the evident gulf in class between the two teams, one who played in Division I this year, and the other in Division IV.\n\nAny prospect of a Tipperary comeback, faint at best, was instantly extinguished after the restart by a brilliant Kerry goal. It started with a superb pass from Walsh to Cooper, who fed the ball inside to O’Donoghue. O’Donoghue, who was excellent in the first half, showed how sharp he was by turning his marker and storming in on goal. He then finished beautifully to the net past Paul Fitzgerald in the Tipperary goal, placing the ball expertly in the top right hand corner of the net.\n\nThat made it 1-11 to 0-4, but Tipperary finally got their first scores from play shortly after this, with points from Philip Austin and Ciarán McDonald following a free from Conor Sweeney to make it 1-11 to 0-7. Those scores gave Tipperary some momentum, but it was shattered on 48 minutes when Grogan was sent off after picking up his second yellow. He had been one of Tipperary’s most important players, and Kerry resumed domination in his absence, with a wonderful individual score from Cooper ending the Premier County’s scoring run. Kerry emptied their bench, Darran O’Sullivan and Bryan Sheehan among those coming on, and the Kingdom continued to exploit the increasing amounts of space, with Cooper their tormentor-in-chief. The seven-time All Star kicked some beautiful points from play in the closing stages, including one excellent score with his right foot after a trademark sidestep. Donaghy had been kept relatively quiet throughout, but he had one significant final say, flicking a long ball into the path of substitute Darran O’Sullivan, who palmed to the net for Kerry’s second goal.\n\nScorers for Kerry: J O’Donoghue 1-3, C Cooper 0-5 (1f), J Buckley 0-3 (2f), Darran O’Sullivan 1-0, P Galvin 0-2, D Walsh 0-1, A Maher 0-1, K Donaghy 0-1, T Ó Sé 0-1, Declan O’Sullivan 0-1, B Sheehan 0-1 (1 45′)\n\nScorers for Tipperary: B Grogan 0-3 (2f, 1 45′), C Sweeney 0-3 (3f), P Austin 0-1, C McDonald 0-1\n\nKerry: B Kealy; M Ó Sé, A O’Mahony, F Fitzgerald; T Ó Sé, K Young, P Crowley; A Maher, J Buckley; P Galvin, C Cooper, D Walsh; Declan O’Sullivan, K Donaghy, J O’Donoghue.\n\nSubs: Darran O’Sullivan for D Walsh (50), B Sheehan for P Galvin (56), M Griffin for M Ó Sé (60), K O’Leary for Declan O’Sullivan (62), B Maguire for T Ó Sé (63).\n\nTipperary: P Fitzgerald; J Coghlan, P Codd, C McDonald; R Kiely, D Leahy, A Campbell; G Hannigan, R Costigan; C Sweeney, I Fahey, P Acheson; A Maloney, B Grogan, P Austin.\n\nSubs: Shane Leahy for Alan Campbell (35), Brian Mulvihill for Robbie Kiely (HT), Aldo Matassa for Alan Maloney (HT), L Egan for G Hannigan (59), H Coghlan for I Fahey (63).\n\nReferee – Conor Lane (Cork)\n\nNext Round – the winners play Waterford in the Munster Semi-Final on Saturday June 1st at 7:00pm.\n\nTeam News\n\nThe Tipperary senior football team to play Kerry in the Munster quarter-final at Fitzgerald Stadium, Killarney on Sunday is as follows:\n\n1.
