The All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship of 1937 was the 51st edition of Irelandâ€™s premier hurling knockout competition. The championship ran from May to September of that year, culminating with the All-Ireland final, held at FitzGerald Stadium, Killarney on 5 September. The match was contested by Tipperary and Kilkenny, with Tipperary taking the title by 3-11 to 0-3. The prize for the winning team was the Liam McCarthy Cup.

Format

The All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship was run on a provincial basis as usual. All games were played on a knockout basis whereby once a team lost they were eliminated from the championship. The format for the All-Ireland series of games ran as follows:

* The winners of the Munster Championship advanced directly to the All-Ireland final.

* The winners of the Leinster Championship advanced directly to a lone All-Ireland semi-final.

* Galway, a team who faced no competition in the Connacht Championship, entered the championship at the All-Ireland semi-final stage where they played the Leinster champions.

* There were no representatives from the Ulster Championship in the All-Ireland series.
