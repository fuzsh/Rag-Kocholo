        "text": "Organizational Forms\n\nThere is a single legal form available for registered, not-for-profit organizations in Iraq: the Non-Governmental Organization (NGO). An NGO is defined as “a group of natural or legal persons that have registered and obtained legal personality according to the terms of this Law to pursue not‐for‐profit purposes” (Article 1(First) of Law 12 of 2010). A foreign NGO is defined as “a branch of an NGO that has been established according to the laws of another country” (Article 1(Second) of Law 12 of 2010).\n\nPublic Benefit Status\n\nNGOs are free to pursue any not-for-profit purposes. NGOs seeking to “achieve a public interest” can apply for “public utility” status (Article 17 of Law 12 of 2010). If granted, such NGOs “shall be exempted from income tax, VAT, customs duties, and sales tax” (Article 17 of Law 12 of 2010). Public utility status is granted by “a decision of the Council of Ministers based on a proposal by the Secretary General of the Council of Ministers” (Article 17 of Law 12 of 2010).\n\nPublic Participation\n\nIn general, public participation rights are not institutionalized. In most of Iraq, there is neither a compact (a cooperation policy document) nor a right to access information. While there have been drafts of compacts and a draft access to information law, they have never been approved by the government or parliament.\n\nHowever, Iraqi Kurdistan does have some mechanisms for and protection of public participation and access to information. Since 2013, there has been a a cooperation policy document called “The Compact on Partnership and Development between Public Authorities and Non- Governmental Organizations in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.” This document “is based on the understanding that for a developing and permanent democratic system, the public sector must involve its citizens and non-governmental organizations in the decision-making process.” In addition, the Kurdistan region has had a Right to Access to Information Law since 2013. Despite these legal protections, awareness on the right to public participation is very low.\n\nBarriers to Entry\n\nWhile Law 12 of 2010 does not contain any significant barriers to entry, the Implementing Regulation passed by the Council of Ministers contains a requirement of mandatory registration for all NGOs. ICNL understands that a coalition of Iraqi NGOs are planning to challenge the provision in court. Further, Iraq’s NGO Directorate now requires all aspiring organizations to obtain approval from the Supreme National Commission for Accountability and Justice, before they may register. Branches of foreign NGOs that seek to register in Iraq must provide a copy of the Iraqi nationality certificates and civil status identity cards of their Iraqi staff as well as copies of the passports and residence documents of their foreign staff (Article 25 of Law 12 of 2010). This provision has been criticized as a barrier to the registration of foreign NGOs, which may have concerns about the security of their staff if their identification information is required to be shared. In Kurdistan, for its part, the NGO Department requires foreign organizations to renew their registration every year.\n\nBarriers to Operational Activity\n\nNone.\n\nBarriers to Speech / Advocacy\n\nHuman Rights Watch reported on April 22, 2021 that “A court in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq sentenced three journalists and two activists to six years in prison on February 16, 2021, in deeply flawed proceedings. The authorities continue to hold two other people despite a court ruling that there was insufficient evidence to try them.” These latter two activists were known to “frequently criticize government practices and call for reforms.” Human Rights Watch noted that these cases represented a “worsening” trend.\n\nIn addition, on April 3, 2020, Iraq revoked Reuters news agency’s reporting license for three months after the agency reported that the number of new coronavirus cases in the country was in the thousands–much higher than official figures. Besides temporarily revoking Reuters’s licence, Iraq said it would impose a fine of around $21,000 and asked Reuters to issue an apology for a report that “put social security at risk.”\n\nMore recently, in January and February 2023, a judge at the Third Investigative Court in al-Karkh, who specializes in media and publishing, announced that the courts had charged 14 people for publishing “indecent” or “immoral” content on social media and had already sentenced six of those individuals to prison terms ranging between six months to two years.\n\nBarriers to International Contact\n\nNone.\n\nBarriers to Resources\n\nNone.\n\nBarriers to Assembly\n\nThe Constitution of Iraq provides in Article 38 that “[t]he State shall guarantee in a way that does not violate public order and morality… freedom of assembly and peaceful demonstration, and this shall be regulated by law.” Provisional Order 19 of 2003, adopted by the Coalition Provisional Authority, provides a framework regulation for public assemblies and demonstrations. In addition, the Interior Ministry has issued a number of regulations to restrict assemblies in specific circumstances; for instance, an order circulated in April 2011, that banned street protests and allowed demonstrations to take place only in certain football stadiums. Finally, as discussed above, in May 2011 Iraq’s Council of Ministers approved a draft Law on the Freedom of Expression, Assembly, and Peaceful Demonstration. The draft law subsequently stalled and at the time of this writing has not been formally approved by Iraq’s Parliament; as such, it appears that CPA Order 19, as amended, remains the primary law regulating demonstrations and assemblies in Iraq.\n\nAdvanced Notification. Article 4 of Order 19 prohibits “any march, assembly, meeting or gathering on roadways, public thoroughfares or public places unless an Approving Authority has been given notice in writing of the location, the maximum number of persons participating, and the names and addresses of the organizers of any such march, assembly, meeting or gathering, its route, and its time of inception and duration at least 24 hours before such inception.” The Order does not provide specific grounds on which authorities may reject the notice, as such they appear to have broad discretion to do so. Article 9 of Order 100 of 2004, which amended parts of Order 19, granted the right for organizers to appeal to a federal court if denied the opportunity to assemble, and if such denial is “arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law.”\n\nTime and Place Restrictions. Article 3 of Order 19 includes constraints on the timing, duration, and location of assemblies. It provides, for instance, that assemblies cannot be held in public places for more than four hours; cannot be held during peak traffic hours – i.e. from 7:30-9am and 4:30-6pm on business days – unless approved by authorities beforehand; and cannot be cannot be closer than 500 meters to embassies and their regional offices. The Order also prohibits assemblies on roadways unless they are limited to a size that “will not unreasonably obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic,” as determined by authorities. The Order provides that in such a case, within 12 hours of receiving notice of the planned assembly, authorities will inform the applicant group of the maximum number of authorized participants. Finally, the Order prohibits groups from holding public assemblies or marches in more than one location or municipality, on the same day, unless authorized beforehand. The authorities thus appear to have broad discretion in limiting the location, timing, and size of assemblies.\n\nCriminal Penalties. Article 7 of Order 19 stipulates “that any individual violating this Order may be detained, arrested, prosecuted and, if convicted, sentenced to up to one year in prison.” Accordingly, any person who organizes or participates in an unauthorized assembly may be liable to imprisonment for up to one year. Enforcement. In recent years, security forces in both Iraq and Kurdistan have frequently used violent force in responding to and suppressing protests. During anti-government demonstrations across the country in February 2011, for instance, security forces killed at least 12 protestors and injured over 100. Unarmed journalists were included among those injured. In the same week, security forces in Kurdistan likewise responded to opposition protests with violence, resulting in the deaths of more than ten people and injuring more than 250. In April 2013, Iraqi military forces clashed with anti-government protesters conducting a peaceful sit-in near the city of Hawija, killing more than 40 people and injuring hundreds with live ammunition and tear gas.\n\nCOVID-19 Restrictions. On February 26, 2020, Iraq’s Ministry of Health issued an order imposing a 14-day ban on all public gatherings to combat the spread of coronavirus. At least eight journalists were also arrested in Iraqi Kurdistan while covering a protest by public school teachers and government employees who were demanding their salaries be paid. Kurdish officials stated that the journalists and 11 protesters were detained for violating the ban on mass gatherings that was imposed due to COVID-19."
