        "text": "Proscription criteria\n\nWhat is a proscribed organisation?\n\nUnder the Terrorism Act 2000, the Home Secretary may proscribe an organisation if they believe it is concerned in terrorism, and it is proportionate to do. For the purposes of the act, this means that the organisation:\n\ncommits or participates in acts of terrorism\n\nprepares for terrorism\n\npromotes or encourages terrorism (including the unlawful glorification of terrorism)\n\nis otherwise concerned in terrorism\n\nWhat is meant by ‘terrorism’ in the proscription context?\n\n“Terrorism” as defined in the act, means the use or threat of action which: involves serious violence against a person; involves serious damage to property; endangers a person’s life (other than that of the person committing the act); creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or section of the public or is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system.\n\nThe use or threat of such action must be designed to influence the government or an international governmental organisation or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and must be undertaken for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause.\n\nWhat determines whether proscription is proportionate?\n\nIf the statutory test is met, the Home Secretary will consider whether to exercise their discretion to proscribe the organisation. In considering whether to exercise this discretion, the Home Secretary will take into account other factors, including:\n\nthe nature and scale of an organisation’s activities\n\nthe specific threat that it poses to the UK\n\nthe specific threat that it poses to British nationals overseas\n\nthe extent of the organisation’s presence in the UK\n\nthe need to support other members of the international community in the global fight against terrorism.\n\nAliases\n\nSection 3(6) of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows the Home Secretary to specify by order that an alternative name or alias is to be treated as another name for a proscribed organisation listed in Schedule 2 to the act. The Home Secretary can make an order where they believe the proscribed organisation is operating under that alternative name or that an organisation operating under a name not included in Schedule 2 is for all practical purposes the same as the proscribed organisation.\n\nThe use of an alternative name which has not been formally recognised in an order does not prevent the police and Crown Prosecution Service from taking action against an individual for proscription offences. For a successful prosecution, it is necessary to demonstrate that (1) the organisation in question, whatever name it professes to be operating under, is for all practical purposes the same as the proscribed organisation listed in Schedule 2; and (2) that the person in question has committed one of the proscription offences in relation to that organisation.\n\nProscription offences\n\nProscription makes it a criminal offence to:\n\nbelong, or profess to belong, to a proscribed organisation in the UK or overseas (section 11 of the act)\n\ninvite support for a proscribed organisation (the support invited need not be material support, such as the provision of money or other property, and can also include moral support or approval) (section 12(1))\n\nexpress an opinion or belief that is supportive of a proscribed organisation, reckless as to whether a person to whom the expression is directed will be encouraged to support a proscribed organisation (section 12(1A))\n\narrange, manage or assist in arranging or managing a meeting in the knowledge that the meeting is to support or further the activities of a proscribed organisation, or is to be addressed by a person who belongs or professes to belong to a proscribed organisation (section 12(2)); or to address a meeting if the purpose of the address is to encourage support for, or further the activities of, a proscribed organisation (section 12(3))\n\nwear clothing or carry or display articles in public in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion that the individual is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation (section 13)\n\npublish an image of an item of clothing or other article, such as a flag or logo, in the same circumstances (section 13(1A))\n\nWhat are the penalties for a proscription offence?\n\nThe penalties for proscription offences under sections 11 and 12 are a maximum of 14 years in prison and/or a fine. The maximum penalty for a section 13 offence is 6 months in prison and/or a fine not exceeding £5,000.\n\nDo the proscription offences apply to all designated and proscribed organisations?\n\nNo, the proscription offences set out in sections 11 to 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (as amended by the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019) apply in relation to proscribed organisations i.e. those specified in Schedule 2 to the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences do not apply in relation to groups subject to other designation or sanction regimes such as an asset freeze in the UK as a result of a UN Al Qa’ida, EU CP 931 or UK domestic, asset freeze unless that entity is also proscribed in the UK.\n\nHow does proscription help disrupt terrorism?\n\nIn addition to the proscription offences, proscription can support other disruptive activity including the use of immigration powers such as exclusion, prosecution for other offences, encouraging removal of on-line material, messaging and EU asset freezes. The resources of a proscribed organisation are terrorist property and are, therefore, liable to be seized.\n\nDo the offences relating to a proscribed organisation apply overseas?\n\nYes. The section 11 offence of membership of a proscribed organisation has had extra-territorial jurisdiction since 2006. From 12 April 2019, the section 12 and 13 offences of inviting or recklessly expressing support for a proscribed organisation, and the offences of displaying or publishing articles, also have extra-territorial jurisdiction for British nationals and UK residents. The offences do not prevent non-governmental organisations interacting with proscribed organisations overseas.\n\nIs it an offence to arrange or manage a meeting relating to a proscribed organisation?\n\nSection 12(2) of the Terrorism Act 2000 provides that it is an offence to arrange or manage (or assist in the arrangement or management) of a meeting in the knowledge that it is to support a proscribed organisation, to further the activities of a proscribed organisation, or is to be addressed by a person who belongs or professes to belong to a proscribed organisation. It is also an offence under section 12(3) to address a meeting if the purpose of the address is to encourage support for a proscribed organisation or to further its activities. However, section 12(4) provides a defence, in the case of a private meeting addressed by a member of a proscribed organisation, if a person can prove that they had no reasonable cause to believe that the address would support the proscribed organisation or advance its terrorist activities.\n\nFurther, the explanatory notes to the Terrorism Act 2000 (which are designed to provide clarification of the legislation’s intent and can be taken into account by the prosecuting authorities when considering whether prosecution is in the public interest and by courts in interpreting Parliament’s intentions) explain that the defence in section 12(4) is intended to permit the arrangement of ‘genuinely benign’ meetings. A ‘genuinely benign’ meeting is interpreted as a meeting at which the terrorist activities of the group are not promoted or encouraged, for example, a meeting designed to encourage a designated group to engage in a peace process or facilitate delivery of humanitarian aid where this does not involve knowingly transferring assets to a designated organisation.\n\nDeproscription\n\nThe Home Secretary will consider deproscription on application only. Section 4 of the Terrorism Act 2000 provides that the organisation or any person affected by a proscription can submit a signed, written application to the Home Secretary requesting that they consider whether a specified organisation should be removed from the list of proscribed organisations. Proscription decisions in relation to Northern Ireland are a matter for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, therefore deproscription applications for Northern Ireland related groups should be made to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The application must set out the grounds on which it is made. The precise requirements are contained in the Proscribed Organisations (Applications for Deproscription etc) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/2299).\n\nThe Home Secretary or Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is required to determine the application within 90 days from the day after it is received. If the deproscription application is refused the applicant may appeal to the Proscribed Organisations Appeals Commission (POAC). The Commission will allow an appeal if it considers that the decision to refuse deproscription was flawed, applying judicial review principles. Either party can seek leave to appeal the POAC’s decision at the Court of Appeal.\n\nIf the Home Secretary or Secretary of State for Northern Ireland agrees to deproscribe the organisation, or following a successful appeal POAC orders the Secretary of State to lay an order before Parliament for the organisation to be deproscribed it voted into force, the organisation will be removed from the list of proscribed organisations. The Order is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure so must be agreed by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\n\nSection 10 of the Terrorism Act 2000 provides that evidence of anything done in relation to a deproscription application is not admissible as evidence in proceedings against an individual for an offence under that act.\n\nMujaheddin e Khalq (MeK)\n\nThe MEK, also known as the Peoples’ Mujaheddin of Iran (PMOI), was removed from the list of proscribed groups in June 2008 as a result of judgments of the POAC and the Court of Appeal.\n\nInternational Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF)\n\nISYF was removed from the list of proscribed groups in March 2016 following receipt of an application to deproscribe the organisation.\n\nHezb-e Islami Gulbuddin (HIG)\n\nHIG was removed from the list of proscribed groups in December 2017 following receipt of an application to deproscribe the organisation.\n\nLibyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG)\n\nLIFG was removed from the list of proscribed groups in November 2019 following receipt of an application to deproscribe the organisation.\n\nAsset freezing\n\nThere are also domestic and international financial asset freezing sanctions regimes that involve the listing of terrorist organisations and individuals. The current consolidated list of asset freeze targets designated by the United Nations, European Union and United Kingdom, under current financial sanctions regimes is available on GOV.UK.\n\nList of proscribed international terrorist groups\n\n81 terrorist organisations are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000\n\n14 organisations in Northern Ireland that were proscribed under previous legislation\n\nThe information about the groups’ aims was given to Parliament when they were proscribed.\n\nUsers should bear in mind that there is no universal standard for transliterating Arabic and other languages into Latin characters. Therefore, the spelling of the names of proscribed organisations appearing in other publications may differ slightly from that given in this list.\n\n17 November Revolutionary Organisation (N17) - Proscribed March 2001\n\nAims to highlight and protest at what it deems to be imperialist and corrupt actions, using violence. Formed in 1974 to oppose the Greek military Junta, its stance was initially anti-Junta and anti-US, which it blamed for supporting the Junta.\n\nAbdallah Azzam Brigades, including the Ziyad al-Jarrah Battalions (AAB) - Proscribed June 2014\n\nAAB is an Islamist militant group aligned with Al Qa’ida and the global jihad movement, currently fighting in Syria and Lebanon.

Ajnad Misr has stated that it seeks to protect Egyptian Muslims and avenge alleged abuse against them by the Egyptian security services.\n\nAjnad Misr is believed to have been active since 20 November 2013, when it attacked an Egyptian checkpoint. It announced its establishment on 23 January 2014 and has claimed responsibility a number of attacks on Egyptian security forces in a military campaign. The claims were made in three communiqués posted on its Facebook and Twitter accounts on 23 January, 24 January, and 31 January. On the jihadi forum al-Fida’, Ansar Bayt al Maqdis, referred to Ajnad Misr in a communiqué issued on January 28, expressing support for the group and identifying it as being responsible for two attacks in Greater Cairo in January.

Some members also want the removal of Western influence from the Arab world.\n\nAl Ghurabaa - Proscribed July 2006\n\nAl Ghurabaa / The Saved Sect is an Islamist group which seeks to establish an Islamic Caliphate ruled by Shariah law. The group first emerged as Al Muhajiroun in the UK, in 1996, led by Omar Bakri Muhammed, who then publicly disbanded the organisation in 2004. The organisation reformed in 2004 under the names Al Ghurabaa and the Saved Sect. While the Group has some links to groups overseas, it is based and operates within the UK.\n\nThe government laid Orders, in January 2010 and November 2011, which provide that “Al Muhajiroun”, “Islam4UK”, “Call to Submission”, “Islamic Path”, “London School of Sharia” and “Muslims Against Crusades” should be treated as alternative names for the organisation which is already proscribed under the names Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect.\n\nThe government laid an Order, in June 2014 recognising “Need4Khilafah”, the “Shariah Project” and the “Islamic Dawah Association” as the same as the organisation proscribed as Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect, which is also known as “Al Muhajiroun”.\n\nAl Ittihad Al Islamia (AIAI) - Proscribed October 2005\n\nThe main aims of AIAI are to establish a radical Sunni Islamic state in Somalia, and to regain the Ogaden region of Ethiopia as Somali territory via an insurgent campaign.

The merger was announced in a public statement in August 2013.\n\nAl Murabitun aspires to unite Muslims from “the Nile to the Atlantic” and has affirmed its loyalty to al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and the emir of the Afghan Taleban, Mullah Omar.\n\nAs at 3 April 2014, the group has not claimed responsibility for any terrorist attacks since the merger but both precursor groups have participated in a number of terrorist attacks and kidnapping for ransom during the past 13 months. Belmokhtar’s group was responsible for the attack against the In Amenas gas facility in January 2013 that resulted in the death of over thirty people including Britons. In May 2013 the two groups targeted a military barracks in Agadez, Niger and a uranium mine in Arlit which supplies French nuclear reactors. The suicide attack in Agadez resulted in the deaths of at least twenty people.\n\nDespite previously separating themselves from AQM, citing leadership issues and the desire to expand their control, both precursor groups continued to cooperate and fight alongside AQM fighters in Mali and other regions of West Africa. This activity has continued since the merger.\n\nAl-Mukhtar Brigades including Saraya al-Mukhtar - Proscribed December 2017\n\nThe group is a Shia militant organisation that was established during 2013.

He also confirmed AAS-B had demolished and desecrated Sufi shrines in Benghazi, which the group regard as idolatrous.\n\nAAS-B used its online presence to denounce the 2013 capture and removal from Libya of al Qa’ida operative Abu Anas al-Libi, by American military forces. In August 2013, Ahmed Abu Khattala, a senior leader of the group, was charged with playing a significant role in last year’s attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.\n\nAAS-B continues to pose a threat to Libya and Western interests and is alleged to have links to proscribed organisation Ansar al-Sharia-Tunisia and Al Qa’ida.\n\nThe US designated AAS-B as a terrorist organisation in January 2014 and the UN listed AAS-B on 19 November\n\nAnsar Al Sharia-Tunisia (AAS-T) - Proscribed April 2014\n\nAnsar Al Sharia-Tunisia (AAS-T) is a radical Islamist group founded in April 2011.

The group is said to recruit within Egypt and abroad and aims to create an Egyptian state ruled by Sharia law.\n\nABM is assessed to be responsible for a number of attacks on security forces in Egypt since 2011. The attacks appear to have increased since the overthrow of the Morsi government in July 2013. The group’s reach goes beyond the Sinai, with the group claiming responsibility for a number of attacks in Cairo and cross-border attacks against Israel. ABM has undertaken attacks using vehicle borne improvised explosive devices and surface-to-air missiles. Examples of attacks that the group has claimed responsibility for include:\n\nin September 2013 an attack on the Egyptian Interior Minister in which a UK national was seriously injured\n\nthe attack on a police compound in Mansoura on 24 December 2013, killing at least 16 people, including 14 police officers\n\nan attack on a tourist bus in which three South Koreans and their Egyptian driver died on 16 January 2014\n\nAnsaroul Islam also known as Ansar ul Islam and Ansaroul Islam Lil Irchad Wal Jihad - Proscribed March 2019\n\nAnsaroul Islam’s overarching aim is to establish dominance over the historic Fulani - kingdom of Djelgoodji (northern Burkina Faso and central Mali) and the implementation of its own strict Salafi Sharia. The group announced its existence on 16 December 2016 and claimed responsibility for an attack on an army outpost in Nassoumboa (Burkina Faso) which killed at least 12 soldiers.\n\nAnsaroul Islam seeks to eradicate Burkinabe state presence from the country’s northern regions. Doing so, through attacks on government interests, including on: police stations, schools and civic officials; catalysing the departure of others from the region. Typical methodologies include small arms fire and IEDs. Further, the predominantly Fulani Ansaroul Islam frequently target other ethnic groups leading to substantial internal displacement of persons. Ansaroul Islam is highly likely supported by the federation of Al Qa’ida groups in Mali, Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam Wal-Muslimin (JNIM). Ansaroul Islam is designated as a terrorist group by the US.\n\nAnsarul Muslimina Fi Biladis Sudan (Vanguard for the protection of Muslims in Black Africa) (Ansaru) - Proscribed November 2012\n\nAnsaru is an Islamist terrorist organisation based in Nigeria.

AWD celebrates a collection of essays which advocate the use of violence in order to bring about a fascist, white ethno-state by initiating the collapse of modern society by means of a ‘race war’. This ideology has become known as ‘accelerationism’. AWD’s online propaganda has encouraged and promoted terrorist acts and this content likely remains influential among accelerationist terrorist groups. AWD has inspired, at least in part, several loosely affiliated franchise groups abroad, including Feuerkrieg Division, which was proscribed in July 2020.\n\nIn March 2020, AWD claimed that it had disbanded following pressure from US law enforcement agencies. In July 2020, National Socialist Order (NSO) announced itself online as AWD’s ‘successor’. AWD is almost certainly now operating under the name NSO in the United States. NSO adheres to the same ideology and has similar accelerationist aims as it did when it was called AWD. Under the name NSO, the organisation has publicly dedicated itself to bringing about ‘white power’ governments ‘by any means necessary’ and it is almost certain that ‘any means necessary’ is intended to be understood as endorsing violence.\n\nBabbar Khalsa (BK) - Proscribed March 2001\n\nBK is a Sikh movement that aims to establish an independent Khalistan within the Punjab region of India.\n\nBasque Homeland and Liberty (Euskadi ta Askatasuna) (ETA) - Proscribed March 2001\n\nETA seeks the creation of an independent state comprising the Basque regions of both Spain and France.\n\nBaluchistan Liberation Army (BLA) - Proscribed July 2006\n\nBLA are comprised of tribal groups based in the Baluchistan area of Eastern Pakistan, which aims to establish an independent nation encompassing the Baluch dominated areas of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran.\n\nBoko Haram (Jama’atu Ahli Sunna Lidda Awati Wal Jihad) (BH) - Proscribed July 2013\n\nBoko Haram is a terrorist organisation, based in Nigeria that aspires to establish Islamic law in Nigeria and has carried out a number of terrorist attacks that have targeted all sections of Nigerian society.\n\nEgyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) - Proscribed March 2001\n\nThe main aim of the EIJ is to overthrow the Egyptian government and replace it with an Islamic state. However, since September 1998, the leadership of the group has also allied itself to the ‘global Jihad’ ideology expounded by Usama Bin Laden and has threatened Western interests.\n\nFeuerkrieg Division (FKD) - Proscribed July 2020\n\nFKD is a white supremacist group founded in late 2018 that has an international footprint, with members across North America and Europe. The group celebrates the concepts promoted in a collection of essays which advocate the use of violence and mass murder in pursuit of an apocalyptic race war.\n\nWhilst the bulk of FKD’s activity is online, members have engaged in distributing violent, racist and anti-Semitic propaganda. In mid-2019 the group reportedly called for the deaths of a European Parliament politician and YouTube’s chief executive officer.\n\nFKD’s members have been arrested on terrorism charges both in the UK and overseas. In 2019, US authorities charged several individuals with a variety of offences, including weapons charges, plotting to bomb a synagogue and attack members of the LGBTQ community, plotting to bomb a major news network, and distributing information related to explosives and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn September 2019, UK police apprehended a 16-year-old on suspicion of the commission, preparation, and instigation of acts of terrorism. As a result, the group distributed among its members a list of police buildings and an image of the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, with a gun to his head and the words “Race Traitor” across his eyes, urging members to carry out attacks in retaliation for the arrest of one of its followers. In October 2019, a 21-year-old appeared in court in London charged with terror offences relating to his purported support for FKD. He allegedly encouraged the mass murder of members of the Jewish and LGBTQ communities.\n\nFKD members have condoned and glorified acts of terrorism. This includes the Charleston church shooting; the Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh; the Oklahoma City bombing; and the Christchurch shooting.\n\nOn 8 February 2020 FKD announced on its Telegram channel that it would be dissolving. However, no reason was given for the group’s dissolution and it is assessed that the group and its members remain active through other channels.\n\nGlobal Islamic Media Front (GIMF) including GIMF Banlga Team also known as Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) and Ansar-al Islam – Proscribed July 2016\n\nGIMF is an Islamist extremist propaganda organisation associated with Al Qa’ida (AQ) and other extremist groups around the world. Its activities include propagating a jihadist ideology, producing and disseminating training manuals to guide terror attacks and publishing jihadi news casts. GIMF releases products in a number of languages including Arabic, Urdu, Bengali, English, German and French.\n\nOn 31 December 2015, the GIMF announced the merger of ABT into its ranks, renaming it GIMF Bangla Team. Prior to the merger, using the names ABT and Ansar-al Islam, the group claimed responsibility for the prominent murders and attacks of secular bloggers from 2013 to 2015: including Bangladeshi-American Avijit Roy; Niladri Chatterji Niloy; Ahmed Rajib Haider; Asif Mohiuddin; Oyasiqur Rahman; Ananta Bijoy; Das and AKM Shafiul Islam. The group have been linked to a number of hit lists of bloggers, writers and activists around the world (including nine individuals based in Britain, seven in Germany and two in America, one in Canada and one in Sweden) in 2015.\n\nOn 7 January 2016 GIMF Bangla Team published an infographic chronicling attacks carried out against “blasphemers in Bangladesh” from January 2013 to October 2015. The graphic contained names and locations of 13 attacks, eight of which were celebrated as successful assassinations. Bangladesh banned ABT in May 2015.\n\nGroupe Islamique Combattant Marocain (GICM) - Proscribed October 2005\n\nThe traditional primary objective of the GICM has been the installation of a governing system of the caliphate to replace the governing Moroccan monarchy. The group also has an Al Qa’ida-inspired global extremist agenda.\n\nHarakat al-Muqawamah al-Islamiyyah (Hamas) – Proscription extended November 2021\n\nHamas is a militant Islamist movement that was established in 1987, following the first Palestinian intifada. Its ideology is related to that of the Muslim Brotherhood combined with Palestinian nationalism. Its main aims are to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation, the establishment of an Islamic state under Sharia law and the destruction of Israel (although Hamas no longer demands the destruction of Israel in its Covenant). The group operates in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Hamas formally established Hamas IDQ in 1992. Hamas IDQ was proscribed by the UK in March 2001. At the time it was HM government’s assessment that there was a sufficient distinction between the so called political and military wings of Hamas, such that they should be treated as different organisations, and that only the military wing was concerned in terrorism. The government now assess that the approach of distinguishing between the various parts of Hamas is artificial. Hamas is a complex but single terrorist organisation.\n\nHamas commits and participates in terrorism. Hamas has used indiscriminate rocket or mortar attacks, and raids against Israeli targets. During the May 2021 conflict, over 4,000 rockets were fired indiscriminately into Israel. Civilians, including 2 Israeli children, were killed as a result. Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas, frequently use incendiary balloons to launch attacks from Gaza into southern Israel. There was a spate of incendiary balloon attacks from Gaza during June and July 2021, causing fires in communities in southern Israel that resulted in serious damage to property.\n\nHamas also prepares for acts of terrorism. One incident of preparatory activity is that Hamas recently launched summer camps in Gaza which focus on training groups, including minors, to fight. This is evidence of Hamas being responsible for running terrorist training camps in the region. In a press statement, Hamas described the aim of these camps as to “ignite the embers of Jihad in the liberation generation, cultivate Islamic values and prepare the expected victory army to liberate Palestine”.\n\nHarakat-Ul-Jihad-Ul-Islami (HUJI) - Proscribed October 2005\n\nThe aim of HUJI is to achieve though violent means accession of Kashmir to Pakistan, and to spread terror throughout India. HUJI has targeted Indian security positions in Kashmir and conducted operations in India proper.\n\nHarakat-Ul-Jihad-Ul-Islami (Bangladesh) (HUJI-B) - Proscribed October 2005\n\nThe main aim of HUJI-B is the creation of an Islamic regime in Bangladesh modelled on the former Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Harakat-Ul-Mujahideen/Alami (HuM/A) and Jundallah - Proscribed October 2005\n\nThe aim of both HuM/A and Jundallah is the rejection of democracy of even the most Islamic-oriented style, and to establish a caliphate based on Sharia law, in addition to achieving accession of all Kashmir to Pakistan. HuM/A has a broad anti-Western and anti-President Musharraf agenda.\n\nHarakat Mujahideen (HM) - Proscribed March 2001\n\nHM, previously known as Harakat Ul Ansar (HuA) seeks independence for Indian-administered Kashmir. The HM leadership was also a signatory to Usama Bin Laden’s 1998 fatwa, which called for worldwide attacks against US and Western interests.\n\nHaqqani Network (HQN) - Proscribed March 2015\n\nThe Haqqani Network (HQN) is an Islamist, nationalist group seeking to establish sharia law and control territory in Afghanistan. It is ideologically aligned with the Taleban, and aims to eradicate Western influence, disrupt the Western military and political efforts in Afghanistan. The group is demanding that US and Coalition Forces withdraw from Afghanistan. The group is led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin.\n\nHQN has links with a number of terrorist groups in the region including proscribed Central Asian group Islamic Jihad Union (IJU). HQN also have long established links with Al Qa’ida (AQ) that were strengthened after the removal of the Taleban by the US when AQ leader Osama bin Laden was probably sheltered by Jalaluddin in North Waziristan (NWA).\n\nHQN continues to play an active and influential role in the Afghan insurgency in the East of the country and is seeking to expand its influence in to other areas of Afghanistan. While it can be difficult to identify specific HQN responsibility for attacks, given the Taleban practice of claiming attacks on behalf of the insurgency as a whole, the group believed to have been responsible for the recent attack against the British Embassy vehicle in November 2014 which killed six people including a UK national and an Afghan member of UK Embassy staff and injuring more than 30 people.\n\nIt is likely that HQN will continue to view Kabul as a key target location due to the concentration of UK and Western interests in the capital.\n\nHQN has been banned as a terrorist group by the USA since September 2012, Canada since May 2013 and the UN since November 2012.\n\nHasam including Harakat Sawa’d Misr, Harakat Hasm and Hasm - Proscribed December 2017\n\nThe group is an extremist group using violent tactics against the Egyptian security forces, and the Egyptian regime. The group announced its creation on 16 July 2016 following an attack in Fayoum Governate, Egypt. In September 2016 the group claimed responsibility for the attempted assassination of Assistant Prosecutor General Zakaria Abdel-Aziz. On 5 August 2016 the group also claimed responsibility for the attempted assassination of the former Grand Mufti of Egypt Ali Gomaa.\n\nThe group have claimed responsibility for over 15 attacks including:\n\n8 March 2017 - Small arms fire in Cairo\n\n26 March 2017 - IED attack in Cairo\n\n1 May 2017 - Small arms fire in Cairo\n\n18 June 2017 – IED attack in Cairo\n\n7 July 2017 - Small arms fire in Cairo\n\n20 July 2017 - Small arms fire in Fayoum Governate\n\n30 September 2017 – IED explosion close to the Myanmar Embassy Cairo\n\nHizballah (Party of God) - Proscribed March 2019\n\nHizballah is committed to armed resistance to the state of Israel and aims to seize all Palestinian territories and Jerusalem from Israel. It supports terrorism in Iraq and the Palestinian territories.\n\nHizballah was established during the Lebanese civil war and in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Hizballah is committed to armed resistance to the state of Israel and aims to seize all Palestinian territories and Jerusalem from Israel. It supports terrorism in Iraq and the Palestinian territories. Hizballah continues to amass an arsenal of weapons in Lebanon, in direct contravention of UN Security Council Resolutions 1701 and 1559, putting the security of the region at risk. Its involvement in the Syrian civil war, since 2012, continues to prolong the conflict and the regime’s brutal and violent repression of the Syrian people - violating the Lebanese government’s policy of disassociation from regional conflicts, increasingly destabilising the region’s long-term stability.\n\nHizballah, as a political entity in Lebanon has won votes in legitimate elections and forms part of the Lebanese government. It has the largest non-state military force in the country.\n\nThe UK government proscribed Hizballah’s External Security Organisation in 2001. In 2008, the proscription was extended to include the whole of Hizballah’s military apparatus, namely the Jihad Council and all the units reporting to it.\n\nHizballah itself has publicly denied a distinction between its military and political wings. The group in its entirety is assessed to be concerned in terrorism.\n\nThe US, Canada, the Netherlands, Israel, the Gulf Co-operation Council and Bahrain also designate the group in its entirety as a terrorist organisation\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir - Proscribed January 2024\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir is an international Sunni Islamist political organisation which was founded in Jerusalem in 1953 by Sheikh Taquiddin an-Nabhani. Hizb ut-Tahrir has a footprint in at least 32 countries, with its headquarters and Central Media Office (CMO) based in Beirut, Lebanon. The CMO runs Hizb ut-Tahrir’s central propaganda website hizb-ut-tahrir.info.\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir’s stated long-term goal is to unify Muslims worldwide and establish a Caliphate ruled under Islamic (Shari’a) law. Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain is the official branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir in the UK and was established in the UK in the 1980s. The UK government assess that Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain is a component branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir but is afforded autonomy to interpret and approach Hizb ut-Tahrir’s global strategy according to its local environment.\n\nThe UK government assess that Hizb ut-Tahrir, including its national branches, is currently concerned in terrorism, and meets the ‘promotes and encourages’ limb of the statutory test. A number of articles were posted online on Hizb ut-Tahrir’s central media website (and third party websites), attributed to several of Hizb ut-Tahrir’s branches, which celebrated and praised the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas and associated events. The content of these articles, many of which refer to Hamas as ‘heroes’ and encourage further terrorist activity, constitute the promotion and encouragement of terrorism.\n\nImarat Kavkaz (IK) also known as the Caucasus Emirate - Proscribed December 2013\n\nImarat Kavkaz seeks a Sharia-based Caliphate across the North Caucasus. It regularly uses terrorist tactics and has carried out attacks against both Russian state and civilian targets. The organisation claimed responsibility for the attack on Domedodevo airport in Moscow in January 2011, that killed 35 including one British national and a suicide attack on the Moscow Metro in March 2010 that killed 39. Since then there has been continued activity by Imarat Kavkaz, including renewed threats of terrorist activity in Russia.\n\nIndian Mujahideen (IM) - Proscribed July 2012\n\nIM aims to establish an Islamic state and implement Sharia law in India using violent means.\n\nIslamic Army of Aden (IAA) - Proscribed March 2001\n\nThe IAA’s aims are the overthrow of the current Yemeni government and the establishment of an Islamic State following Sharia Law.\n\nIslamic Jihad Union (IJU) - Proscribed July 2005\n\nThe primary strategic goal of the IJU is the elimination of the current Uzbek regime.

The group adheres to a global jihadist ideology, following an extreme interpretation of Islam, which is anti-Western and promotes sectarian violence. ISIL aims to establish an Islamic State governed by Sharia law in the region and impose their rule on people using violence and extortion.\n\nISIL was previously proscribed as part of Al Qa’ida (AQ). However, on 2 February 2014, AQ senior leadership issued a statement officially severing ties with ISIL. This prompted consideration of the case to proscribe ISIL in its own right.\n\nISIL not only poses a threat from within Syria but has made significant advances in Iraq. The threat from ISIL in Iraq and Syria is very serious and shows clearly the importance of taking a strong stand against the extremists.\n\nWe are aware that a number of British nationals have travelled to Syria and some of these will inevitably be fighting with ISIL. It appears that ISIL is treating Iraq and Syria as one theatre of conflict and its potential ability to operate across the border must be a cause of concern for the whole international community.\n\nIn April 2014, ISIL claimed responsibility for a series of blasts targeting a Shia election rally in Baghdad. These attacks are reported to have killed at least 31 people. Thousands of Iraqi civilians lost their lives to sectarian violence in 2013, and attacks carried out by ISIL will have accounted for a large proportion of these deaths.\n\nISIL has reportedly detained dozens of foreign journalists and aid workers. In September 2013, members of the group kidnapped and killed the commander of Ahrar ash-Sham after he intervened to protect members of a Malaysian Islamic charity.\n\nIn January 2014, ISIL captured the Al-Anbar cities of Ramadi and Fallujah and is engaged in ongoing fighting with the Iraqi security forces. The group also claimed responsibility for a car bomb attack that killed four people and wounded dozens in the southern Beirut suburb of Haret Hreik.\n\nISIL has a strong presence in northern and eastern Syria where it has instituted strict Sharia law in the towns under its control. The group is responsible for numerous attacks and a vast number of deaths. The group is believed to attract foreign fighters, including Westerners, to the region.\n\nThe group has maintained control of various towns on the Syrian/Turkish border allowing the group to control who crosses and ISIL’s presence there has interfered with the free flow of humanitarian aid.\n\nThe government laid an Order in August 2014 which provides that “Islamic State (Dawlat al Islamiya)” should be treated as another name for the organisation which is already proscribed as ISIL. The UK does not recognise ISIL’s claims of a ‘restored’ Caliphate or a new Islamic State. The government laid an Order in February 2019, which provides that “Jaysh Khalid Bin Walid (JKbW) (JKW)” “Jaysh Khalid bin al-Walid (KBW)” and “Khalid ibn-Walid Army (KBWA)” should be treated as alternative names for the organisation which is already proscribed as ISIL.\n\nJaish e Mohammed (JeM) and splinter group Khuddam Ul-Islam (Kul) – JeM proscribed March 2001and KuI proscribed October 2005\n\nJeM and KuI seek the ‘liberation’ of Kashmir from Indian control as well as the ‘destruction’ of America and India.

JNIM’s area of operations encompasses northern and central Mali, northern Burkina Faso and western Niger (the western Sahel region). JNIM aims to eradicate state and Western presence from these areas, and to institute governance in accordance with a strict Salafist interpretation of Sharia law. Attacks on Western interests in the region and across wider West Africa are one means by which JNIM seeks to achieve these goals. Kidnap of Western nationals for ransom purposes remains a lucrative source of income for the group.\n\nJNIM attacks are typically claimed via az-Zallaqa the group’s media foundation, examples include:\n\n18 June 2017 - firearms and IED attack on Le Campement Resort in Bamako, in which three civilians and two military personnel were killed;\n\n2 March 2018 - VBIED and firearms attack on the French Embassy and Burkinabe Chief of Defence HQ in Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso;\n\n14 April 2018 - VBIED and firearms attack on Barkhane and United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (Minusma) camp in Timbuktu, Mali;\n\n22 April 2018 - indirect fire attack on Barkhane and Minusma camp in Timbuktu, Mali;\n\n28 June 2018 - VBIED attack on the G5 Sahel Force HQ at Sevare, Mopti region, Sahel; and\n\n29 July 2018 - VBIED attack on the Malian Army and BARKHANE convoy in the Gao region, Mali on fire attack on Barkhane and Minusma camp at Aguelhok, Kidal region, Mali.\n\nThe US and UN also designate the group as a terrorist organisation.\n\nJamaat ul-Ahrar (JuA) - Proscribed March 2015\n\nJuA is a militant Islamist group that split away from Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in August 2014.

The organisation reformed in 2004 under the names Al Ghurabaa and the Saved Sect. While the Group has some links to groups overseas, it is based and operates within the UK.\n\nThe government laid Orders in January 2010 and November 2011, which provides that “Al Muhajiroun”, “Islam4UK”, “Call to Submission”, “Islamic Path”, “London School of Sharia” and “Muslims Against Crusades” should be treated as alternative names for the organisation which is already proscribed under the names Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect.\n\nThe government laid an Order in June 2014 recognising “Need4Khilafah”, the “Shariah Project” and the “Islamic Dawah Association” as the same as the organisation proscribed as Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect, which is also known as “Al Muhajiroun”.\n\nSipah-e Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) (Aka Millat-e Islami Pakistan (MIP) - SSP was renamed MIP in April 2003 but is still referred to as SSP) and splinter group Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ) - Proscribed March 2001\n\nThe aim of both SSP and LeJ is to transform Pakistan by violent means into a Sunni state under the total control of Sharia law. Another objective is to have all Shia declared Kafirs and to participate in the destruction of other religions, notably Judaism, Christianity and Hinduism.\n\nKafirs means non-believers: literally, one who refused to see the truth. LeJ does not consider members of the Shia sect to be Muslim, so concludes they can be considered a ‘legitimate’ target.\n\nThe government laid an Order in October 2013 which provides that “Ahle Sunnat wal Jamaat (ASWJ)” should be treated as another name for the organisation which is already proscribed as Sipah-e Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) and Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ).\n\nSonnenkrieg Division (SKD) - Proscribed February 2020\n\nSKD is a white supremacist group that was established in March 2018 as a splinter group of System Resistance Network (an alias of the proscribed group National Action). Members of the group were convicted of encouraging terrorism and possession of documents useful to a terrorist in June 2019. The group has encouraged and glorified acts of terrorism via its posts and images. This includes an image depicting the Duke of Sussex being shot as part of their campaign against ‘race traitors’ following his marriage to the Duchess of Sussex; and home-made propaganda using Nazi imagery calling for attacks on minorities. The images can reasonably be taken as inferring that these acts should be emulated and therefore amount to the unlawful glorification of terrorism.\n\nTehrik Nefaz-e Shari’at Muhammadi (TNSM) - Proscribed July 2007\n\nTNSM regularly attacks coalition and Afghan government forces in Afghanistan and provides direct support to Al Qa’ida and the Taliban. One faction of the group claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on an army training compound on 8 November 2007 in Dargai, Pakistan, in which 42 soldiers were killed.\n\nTehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) – Proscribed January 2011\n\nTehrik-e Taliban Pakistan has carried out a high number of mass casualty attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan since 2007.

It draws influence from a collection of essays by prominent National Socialist, James Mason, which advocate the use of violence to initiate the collapse of modern society through a ‘race war’ and the subsequent creation of a white ethno-state. This ideology is known as ‘accelerationism’.\n\nThe Base has links with other internationally based National Socialist groups, such as Atomwaffen Division which was proscribed by the UK in April 2021, and individuals. It seeks to provide terrorist training, guidance and networking.\n\nThe Base almost certainly prepares for terrorism. While it outwardly seeks to promote itself as a “self-defence and survivalist” group and refutes any claims of its involvement in terrorist activity, the training it provides is highly likely paramilitary in nature and preparatory for offensive action. This training would almost certainly enhance both the intent and capability of trainees to conduct terrorist acts. Members of The Base have engaged in weapons and explosives training.\n\nThe Base has also almost certainly promoted or encouraged acts of terrorism and elements of its membership will almost certainly continue to do so. In late 2017, the group’s founder released a series of videos covering topics such as “lone wolf” activity, leaderless resistance and advocating guerrilla warfare.\n\nThe Terrorgram collective - Proscribed April 2024\n\nThe Terrorgram collective is an online transnational network of extreme right-wing terrorists who produce and disseminate violent propaganda with the aim of radicalising readers and encouraging individuals to commit acts of terrorism. The aim of the Terrorgram collective is to bring about the collapse of Western democracy and a ‘race war’ by encouraging others to engage in violent acts of terrorism.\n\nThe government assesses that the Terrorgram collective operates as an organisation in accordance with the guidance provided by section 121 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Its core leadership provides direction to the preparation of propaganda campaigns and coordinates activity between participants to disseminate terrorist content to advance accelerationist ideology.\n\nThe UK government assesses that the Terrorgram collective is an organisation which is concerned in terrorism. The UK government assesses that the Terrorgram collective is involved in preparing for terrorism through the inclusion of instructional material in their propaganda. The UK government assesses that the Terrorgram collective promotes or encourages terrorism. Their publications present a violent narrative and contain material which glorifies previous extreme right-wing terrorist attackers and encourages consumers to commit similar actions.\n\nTurkestan Islamic Party (TIP) also known as East Turkestan Islamic Party (ETIP), East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and Hizb al-Islami al-Turkistani (HAAT) – Proscribed July 2016\n\nTIP is an Islamic terrorist and separatist organisation founded in 1989 by Uighur militants in western China.
