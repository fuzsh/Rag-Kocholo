        "text": "Omran Gangdost was 2 when he lost seven family members in the gas attack on Sardasht. He constantly requires his own oxygen supply (Courtesy Photo) PRAGUE, December 1, 2006 (RFE/RL) -- The head of a center for Iran's disabled war veterans announced on November 26 that Iraq's former Ba'athist regime used chemical weapons against civilians and soldiers some 300 times in the 1980s.\n\nTwo decades later, still suffering the long-term effects of chemical agents, many of the 100,000 Iranian survivors of Iraqi gas attacks continue to seek justice as they follow the trial of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.\n\nThey are described by many as forgotten victims of Saddam Hussein. In many cases, they are soldiers who fought in the bloody Iran-Iraq war in 1980-88. But many others were noncombatants.\n\nIranian authorities have registered more than 50,000 victims of chemical weapons requiring special medical care. But it is thought that about 1 million Iranians were exposed to mustard or nerve gas during the war.\n\nHossein Mohammadian, a resident of Sardasht in Iran's Kurdistan, is among those victims.\n\n'A Special Smell'\n\nSardasht came under chemical attack months before the March 1988 attack on the Iraqi Kurdish town of Halabja, which became a symbol of Saddam Hussein's brutality. But Sardasht received scant media coverage, and was soon forgotten by many.\n\nBut Mohammadian has vivid memories of that hot afternoon in late-June 1987.\n\n\"Even 20 years later, those who at the time of the attack were not seriously injured are slowly developing health problems.\"\n\n\"It was not the first time Sardasht was being attacked, but the difference was -- and it became clear later -- that it was a chemical attack,\" he says. \"Some of the bombs fell only a few meters from me. I thought our house was destroyed and my parents were under the rubble. I started running toward the house, when I realized there was thick smoke in the air and a special smell.\"\n\nSeveral mustard bombs were dropped on the city, contaminating some 4,500 people. More than 100 people died in the first month after exposure.\n\nMohammadian says neighbors began coughing and suffering from blisters. Some vomited, while others could barely open their burning eyes.\n\nEleven members of his family were seriously contaminated. Mohammadian was in such a critical state that he was transferred to a hospital in Tehran, and then Madrid, for treatment. He learned of his father's death only two months after the attack.\n\nLifetime Of Pain\n\nMohammadian, now 46, is a senior member of a nongovernmental group that tries to help Sardasht's victims of chemical weapons. He tells RFE/RL that the city still bears the scars of that attack nearly 20 years ago.\n\n\"Many people have problems, including respiratory difficulties and weak nerves -- their immune systems have become weak,\" Mohammadian says. \"The reality is that [scientists] have not yet found a guaranteed cure for these victims.\"\n\nMany have died of collapsed lungs over the years, and others remain disabled.\n\nShahryar Khateri is a physician who has spent time researching the effects of chemical agents on Iranians. He says many survivors suffer from psychological symptoms, including depression and anxiety.\n\nKhateri was 14 years old when he joined the war to repel the Iraqi invasion, and spent three years on the front lines. There, he witnessed several chemical attacks.\n\n\"In one of them, nerve gas was used -- but we had atropine cyanide injections and, fortunately, because of that our contamination was not very serious,\" Khateri says. \"In another mustard-gas attack, we were some distance from where the bombs fell and we used masks.\"\n\nNo Forgetting\n\nAfter the war, Khateri finished his medical studies and got involved in drawing attention to the plight of victims of chemical warfare.\n\nHe says many survivors have developed chronic lung, eye, or skin diseases.\n\n\"This is one reason why we believe [chemical weapons] are much more destructive than conventional weapons -- because even 20 years later, those who at the time of the attack were not seriously injured are slowly developing health problems,\" Khateri says.\n\nKhateri is now the director of international relations at Iran's Society for Chemical Weapons Victims Support (SCWVS). His nonprofit group helps victims and is also active in peace exchanges and efforts to eliminate unconventional weapons.\n\nKhateri tells RFE/RL that Iran's victims of chemical weapons feel the world has forgotten about them.\n\n\"There is talk of [Saddam Hussein's] crimes everywhere, but there is not a word about the crimes he committed against Iranians,\" Khateri says. \"Sardasht is the first city in the world to have been attacked with chemical weapons. When it comes to Iran, this issue has been affected -- maybe because [Tehran] does not have good political relations with some countries.\"\n\nKhateri says many victims are glad to see Iraq's former leader finally facing justice, but there is also disappointment.\n\n\"I -- and also many other survivors of the war whom I've talked to -- are happy that [Saddam Hussein] is facing trial,\" he says. \"But we are disappointed that the attack against Iran and the use of chemical weapons [against Iranians] have been ignored. I feel this trial is not fair.\"\n\nUnanswered Question\n\nIn Sardasht, Hossein Mohammadian holds out hope that Saddam Hussein -- who has already been sentenced to death for the mass killing of Iraqi civilians -- will also face prosecution for the use of chemical weapons against Iranians:\n\nKhateri wants to know as well: \"Before his [death] sentence is carried out, I would like him to answer a question: Why did he order the use of chemical weapons, especially against the defenseless people of Sardasht?\"\n\nIn the minds of the tens or hundreds of thousands of Iranians whose lives have been wracked by pain and suffering since those chemical attacks, that question deserves an answer.\n\nIraq And Iran\n\nIraq And Iran\n\nIranian Shi'a protesting the Golden Mosque Bombing in Iraq on February 24\n\nWHAT IS GOING ON? On March 8, RFE/RL's Washington office hosted a roundtable discussion on relations between Iraq and Iran. Although most analysts agree that Iran has been actively involved in Iraq since the U.S.-led military operation to oust former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, they continue to debate the nature, extent, and intent of that involvement.\n\nThe RFE/RL briefing featured WAYNE WHITE, former deputy director of the U.S. State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research's Office of Analysis for the Near East and South Asia, and A. WILLIAM SAMII, RFE/RL's regional analyst for Iran and editor of the \"RFE/RL Iran Report.\"\n\nLISTEN\n\nListen to the complete RFE/RL briefing (about 75 minutes):\n\nReal AudioWindows Media\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nIran/Iraq: Bilateral Ties Improving Despite U.S. Worries\n\nRenewed Speculation About Tehran And Instability In Iraq\n\nIran/Iraq: Neighbors Mending Ties, But Outstanding Issues Remain\n\nARCHIVE\n\nRFE/RL's coverage of Iran. RFE/RL's coverage of Iraq.\n\nThe homes of several Afghan migrants in the southern Iranian city of Khur have reportedly been set on fire in apparent retaliation for the killing of an Iranian man allegedly by an Afghan national.\n\nHosna, an Afghan who lives in Khur, told RFE/RL’s Radio Azadi on July 19 that he moved his family from Khur to Shiraz in Fars Province out of fear for their safety.\n\n\"People in the region are very angry and set homes of several Afghans on fire,\" he claimed.\n\nHosna and others who spoke to Radio Azadi attributed the anger to the July 3 killing of a 62-year-old restaurant owner in the town of Khenj by his 17-year-old apprentice. Iranian media have not identified the nationality of the suspected killer, but Hosna said the suspect was an Afghan citizen.\n\n\"The people of the region have sworn not to sell 1 kilogram of meat, or even a piece of bread, to Afghan nationals,\" Hosna said. \"So, many were forced to flee to Shiraz.\"\n\nAnti-Afghan sentiment in Iran has been on the rise in recent years, especially after a mass influx of migrants following the Taliban's return to power in August 2021.\n\nOccasionally, a hashtag that describes the expulsion of Afghan migrants as a \"national demand\" becomes a top trend on X, formerly Twitter, often boosted by anonymous accounts.\n\nLast week, an unsubstantiated claim on social media blamed Afghan migrants for an alleged rise in leprosy cases in Iran.\n\nThe UN’s refugee agency says Iran hosts around 780,000 Afghan refugees, in addition to some 2.6 million undocumented Afghan migrants. But Iran claimed last year that the number of illegal Afghan immigrants was closer to 5 million.\n\nThe authorities have vowed to deport illegal refugees and hundreds of Afghan migrants are sent back to Afghanistan every day. They are also banned from living or working in half of Iran's 31 provinces.\n\nAfghans living in Iran have complained to Radio Azadi about rising harassment, even during deportation.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:04:13 0:00\n\nTehran has for years maintained that it does not receive sufficient financial aid from international organizations to handle the number of refugees on its soil.\n\nTehran is upping the ante in its effort to go after Iranian Kurds abroad it deems \"terrorists,\" demanding that Baghdad extradite leaders and members of Iranian-Kurdish opposition groups based in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region.\n\n\"A list of nearly 120 terrorists who identify themselves as noble Kurds has been sent to Iraq for extradition and their trial will be held soon,\" Iranian judiciary official Kazem Gharibabadi said on July 13.\n\nGharibabadi did not reveal the names on the list. But he said that preparations had been made for the trial of \"leaders and members\" of a \"terrorist group.\"\n\nKurdish and Iraqi media have reported that the list contains the names of some 120 leaders and members of Iranian-Kurdish groups opposed to Tehran.\n\nMany of these groups were armed, with some demanding autonomy within Iran and others fighting for secession from the Islamic republic. Kurds make up around 10 percent of Iran's population of some 88 million and primarily live in the country's west along the border with Iraq.\n\nGharibabadi cast the move as part of a broader effort to fight terrorism, saying that similar extradition requests would be sent to \"relevant foreign countries.\"\n\nBut the move follows backlash to Iran's strong-armed approach in Iraqi Kurdistan, including deadly air strikes that have targeted Iranian-Kurdish opposition groups as well as alleged Israeli targets.\n\nMembers of Kurdish opposition parties cast the pressure by Iran, which follows the signing last year of a security pact between Tehran and Baghdad, as misguided cover for undermining the Kurdish independence movement.\n\nMany Iranian-Kurdish political parties and factions opposed to the Islamic Republic of Iran are based in Iraq's Kurdistan region. That includes the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the most prominent exile opposition faction; Komala, a leftist group; and Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PJAK), the Iranian offshoot of Turkey's Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and designated by Washington as a terrorist group.\n\nTehran has long accused unspecified Kurdish opposition groups, without providing evidence, of coordinating with Israel, its archfoe, to stage attacks on Iran from Iraqi Kurdistan. Kurdish opposition groups deny the allegation.\n\nCross-Border Strikes\n\nIn a security pact agreed between Tehran and Iraq's central government in March 2023, Baghdad agreed to secure Iraqi Kurdistan's lengthy eastern border with Iran, as well as to disarm and relocate Iranian-Kurdish opposition groups based in the region.\n\nMany offices of Kurdish parties that oppose Tehran have since been shut down.\n\nBaghdad's dealings with Iran have been fraught with controversy. Multiple strikes have been carried out by Iran in the Kurdistan region, including a missile attack on the headquarters of the PDKI in the Kuisanjaq district in 2018 that killed 15 members of the party's leadership as well as Peshmerga forces.\n\nIn 2022, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps again targeted the PDKI, as well as Komala, with missile and drone strikes in the regional capital, Irbil, and the city of Sulaymaniyah in the east of the Kurdistan region.\n\nLast year, protests broke out in Iraqi Kurdistan over the construction of a security fence along the region's border with Iran. And tensions rose significantly between Iraq's central government and Tehran after Iran carried out missile strikes in January against what it said were Israeli targets, killing four people in Irbil.\n\nAfter Tehran reached out to resolve its differences with Baghdad, the head of the semiautonomous region, Nechirvan Barzani, visited Iran in May and met with top officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nBarzani gave a commitment in writing that Irbil would work to disarm \"terrorist groups\" and ensure their removal from the Kurdistan region.\n\nWhile Iran claims the alleged anti-Iranian activities of such groups to be a key security challenge, representatives of Iranian-Kurdish factions who spoke to RFE/RL's Radio Farda denied that assertion and suggested that Tehran had ulterior motives.\n\nReza Kaabi, secretary-general of Komala, said that Iran had focused its pressure on Kurdish parties by targeting them with \"missiles, drones, and long-range weapons.\"\n\nBut in reality, he said, \"the Islamic republic has actually targeted the Kurdish people's liberation movement.\"\n\nFears Of Kurdish Independence\n\nIraq's Kurdistan region held an independence referendum in 2017 that was overwhelmingly approved by voters with more than 92 percent in favor.\n\nKurdish leaders suggested the vote, which was opposed by Baghdad, would not lead immediately to independence. But neighboring states like Iran, Syria, and Turkey -- which have large ethnic Kurdish populations -- saw the referendum as a troubling sign of possible secession.\n\nAfter the referendum, the Iraqi military took control of Irbil and the oil-rich city of Kirkuk from Peshmerga forces, prompting the government in Iraqi Kurdistan to renounce the referendum and to negotiate with Baghdad.\n\nThe regional government later announced that it was \"committed to responsible behavior in order to prevent further violence and conflicts.\"\n\nSami Rikani, an independent political activist who resides in the Kurdistan region, says that in the aftermath, pressure from Iran and Turkey increased.\n\n\"Especially after the referendum on the independence of the Kurdistan region of Iraq in 2017, Iran and Turkey came to the conclusion that they should start the process of confronting the Kurdish groups,\" Rikani said.\n\nThe recent demand by Tehran for Baghdad to expel leaders and members of Iranian-Kurdish groups is in keeping with this strategy as well as a security agreement signed between Iraq and Turkey in 2016, Rikani adds.\n\nTurkey has also recently increased its military measures and operations in the Kurdistan region of Iraq with the aim of \"combating the Kurdish groups opposed to the Ankara government,\" according to Ankara.\n\nThe question now, considering Iraq's subsequent security pact inked with Iran last year, is whether Baghdad will acquiesce to Tehran's demand.\n\nNeither Iraq's central government nor the government of the Kurdistan region immediately responded to the extradition request.\n\nWritten by Michael Scollon based on reporting by Iliya Jazaeri of RFE/RL's Radio Farda\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump has been in Tehran's crosshairs ever since he ordered the killing of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in neighboring Iraq in 2020.\n\nTehran has repeatedly vowed to avenge Soleimani, and many officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have alluded to killing Trump and other senior members of his administration on U.S. soil.\n\n“We will prepare the ground to exact vengeance on the Americans from within their homes, using their companions,” Esmail Qaani, who succeeded Soleimani as the commander of the Quds Force, the overseas arm of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), said in January 2022.\n\nWATCH: An animated video posted on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's website that envisions a drone strike on Donald Trump:\n\nAnimation On Khamenei’s Website Showcasing Trump Drone Strike\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:47 0:00\n\nU.S. media reported on July 16 that the Secret Service had enhanced Trump’s security detail after receiving intelligence in recent weeks that Iran was plotting to assassinate him. Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee in the November 5 presidential election.\n\nThe alleged plot appeared to be unrelated to the failed attempt on Trump’s life on July 13, the reports said.\n\n“Plotting to kill a foreign leader, particularly an American presidential candidate, marks a significant leap in the crassness and risk-tolerance of the clerical regime,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.\n\nIran has long been accused of carrying out assassinations, including of Iranian dissidents, on foreign soil, although it has always denied responsibility.\n\nOne of the most high-profile incidents was the 1991 killing of Shapur Bakhtiar, the last prime minister of Iran before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Bakhtiar was shot dead in his home in France, in a killing that was widely blamed on Tehran.\n\n“Iran has not been successful in such endeavors in recent years, and its activities tend to aim at disruption rather than assassinating former or potential heads of state,” said Gregory Brew, an Iran analyst at the U.S.-based Eurasia Group.\n\nHe said while it was “unclear whether Iran's intelligence services are up to the task,” Trump’s close call on July 13 brings “into question any confidence that the Secret Service can keep him totally safe from harm.”\n\nTaleblu said it would therefore be a mistake to dismiss Iran’s threats.\n\nThe Secret Service has been criticized since a 20-year-old gunman shot at Trump at a rally in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, grazing the former president’s ear and killing a member of the crowd.\n\n'Legal Route' To Avenge Soleimani\n\nDespite public declarations by senior Iranian figures about the desire to avenge Soleimani by killing Trump, Iranian diplomats have dismissed reports linking Tehran to plots to assassinate the former president.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said on July 16 thatTehran was “determined to prosecute Trump” while the Iranian mission to the UN insisted that the Islamic republic had “chosen the legal route” to hold him accountable.\n\nSeparately, Acting Foreign Minister Ali Baqeri Kani said Iran “will resort to legal and judicial procedures…at the domestic and international level.”\n\nTaleblu said the comments by Iranian officials were in line with the “standard division of labor” in Tehran’s security policy.\n\n“The Foreign Ministry tries to nullify threats through changes in style, while the IRGC and others are able to press ahead with the same sort of terror and destabilization in substance,” he added.\n\nIn December, a Tehran court ordered the U.S. government to pay nearly $50 billion in damages for assassinating Soleimani. The court convicted Trump and 41 other U.S. officials over the assassination.\n\nSaid Mahmoudi, professor of international law at Stockholm University, told RFE/RL’s Radio Farda that Iranian court cases against Trump were only for show and lacked credibility.\n\n“It is very, very unusual for a [foreign] country…to prosecute Trump. Only international courts are equipped to do this,” he said, adding that international law does not allow domestic courts to prosecute current and former heads of state based on local laws.\n\nPotential Impact on Tehran-Washington Ties\n\nTrump is currently leading President Joe Biden in most opinion polls ahead of the November election and some argue the assassination attempt could, at least temporarily, provide a boost to his chances.\n\nReports of an alleged Iranian plot against Trump’s life could torpedo attempts by reformist President-elect Masud Pezeshkian to tone down Iran’s anti-West rhetoric, Damon Golriz, a lecturer at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, told Radio Farda.\n\nBrew said Trump might be “even more hostile towards Iran” if elected but noted that the hostility is mutual.\n\n“It should temper any expectations of forward progress, on the nuclear issue or any other policy area, in the event Trump wins November's election,” he added.\n\nWith reporting by Reza Jamali and Hooman Askary of RFE/RL’s Radio Farda.\n\nThe chief of police in Iran's Alborz Province said on July 17 that women who took part in an Ashura procession in the city of Karaj without hijabs have been \"identified and summoned.\"\n\nA video posted on Instagram shows a number of young women, most wearing dark clothing but no head scarves, walking in the street in observance of Ashura, a commemoration of the martyrdom of Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, which is marked mainly by Shi'ite Muslims.\n\nTo mourn his death, Shi’a wear black during Ashura processions in which many participants beat their backs with chains in a symbolic expression of regret for not being able to help Hussein before his death.\n\nThe video of the procession in Karaj on July 16 has been met with widespread reactions on social media.\n\nHamid Hadavand, the chief of police in Alborz Province, claimed that the publication of the video and others like it had led to \"hurting the feelings of Hossein's mourners\" throughout the country.\n\nHadavand accused the individuals seen in the videos of \"desecration,\" adding that all of them \"have been summoned to the Alborz Province police after being identified.\"\n\nHe did not say how many people were summoned or how they were identified.\n\nIn addition, the head of the Organization of Religious Boards and Organizations revoked the permission granted to the organization that held the Ashura procession in which the young women took part without hijabs.\n\nMajid Babakhani also announced that the head of the organization had been \"summoned\" with the help of the police and said that he would be dealt with legally.\n\nAshura is marked on the 10th day of Muharram, the first month of the Muslim calendar. Last year Muharram was also marked by reports of the identification and detention of women without compulsory hijabs across Iran.\n\nAuthorities have stepped up confrontations with people who oppose the mandatory hijab law since protests that followed the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran's morality police in September 2022 for allegedly improperly wearing her hijab, and there have been frequent reports of violence against detainees.\n\nIn recent months, the police again started a security crackdown on women flaunting the compulsory hijab law by reimplementing the Plan Noor initiative under which the morality police strictly enforce dress codes. This has led to several incidents of violence against women challenging the mandatory head scarf.\n\nBefore the reimplementation of the Plan Noor initiative the city of Tehran and the Interior Ministry prior employed hijab guards in some subway stations. The interior minister and the mayor of Tehran denied playing any role in this.\n\nDespite these measures, the presence of women and girls without compulsory hijabs in public in Iran has not stopped over the past two years.\n\nIran is set to swear in moderate reformist Masud Pezeshkian as president early next month. Pezeshkian has said that while the hijab law should be observed, \"there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behavior toward women.\"\n\nKiana and Ali Rahmani were only 8 years old when they left Iran to reunite with their father, Taqi Rahmani, who had fled the country as the Iranian authorities sought to arrest him.\n\nTheir mother, activist Narges Mohammadi, could only imagine the scene from her jail cell as her children would be taken from her for an \"unknown\" period of time and endure a \"separation that would make me a stranger to my children and them unfamiliar to me.\"\n\n“I haven’t seen my mom in nine years. I have become used to growing up without a mother,” Kiana, now 17, told Roya Maleki of RFE/RL’s Radio Farda as she marked another anniversary of separation from her mother on July 16.\n\n“My father is a good dad; he has been both a father and a mother,” she added.\n\nIn a statement posted on her website on July 16, Mohammadi recalled staying awake through the night in her prison cell on July 16, 2015, knowing her children would be on a plane to France soon.\n\nThe separation, she said, “felt like vanishing into a misty void of lost connections, tearing a mother and her children apart, leaving us in an indescribable abyss of heartache and longing.”\n\n\"A separation that would turn me into an unfamiliar woman to my children, bearing the name ‘mother’ in a ‘misplaced’ manner,\" she added.\n\nMohammadi, 52, has been campaigning for human rights in Iran for decades and has been in and out of prison in the last 20 years. She has been convicted five times since March 2021 and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence.\n\nShe is currently in jail for “spreading propaganda” against the Islamic republic.\n\nKiana recalls that it was “difficult” going through adolescence as a young girl without her mother, forcing her to turn to her friends and other women for advice.\n\n“I had to learn things that a mother should teach her daughter. I had to ask my friends or their mothers whenever I had a question because I did not have a mother,” she said.\n\nDespite remaining behind bars for so long, Mohammadi has remained at the forefront of Iran's women's rights movement.\n\nHer efforts were honored last October when she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Her children accepted the award on her behalf in December.\n\nKiana said the award raised her mother’s spirits but worsened her conditions in prison because it led to further restrictions, such as limited visiting privileges and phone calls.\n\nDespite not seeing their mother for half of their lives, Ali said they had learned from their mother to “defend our brothers and sisters” from the Middle East.\n\n“We come from a place where there is little freedom and war is constant,” he added.\n\nIn her statement, Mohammadi bemoaned that not seeing her children for so long would make her a “stranger” to them.\n\n“I hope my children understand that I, like all imprisoned mothers…was a loving mother whose heart still aches with overwhelming sorrow for her children,” she wrote.\n\nWritten by Kian Sharifi based on an interview by Roya Maleki of RFE/RL’s Radio Farda.\n\nAn unsubstantiated claim on social media linking an alleged rise in leprosy cases in Iran to the country’s Afghan community has resulted in renewed calls for the expulsion of Afghan migrants.\n\nIranian media have cited the Health Ministry as reporting nine new cases of leprosy over the past year. The reports said three of those afflicted were Afghans.\n\nThe same day, a freelance Iranian journalist who advocates for the expulsion of Afghan refugees alleged without evidence that “Afghan migrants” were responsible for spreading leprosy in Iran.\n\nHe incorrectly charged that “no cases of leprosy had been seen in Iran in years” -- a claim that is easily debunked by data available on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) website.\n\nOn July 9, another journalist who often writes in support of expelling Afghan migrants went as far as calling the alleged rise in leprosy cases “bioterrorism” and demanded that the incoming government of President-elect Masud Pezeshkian “start deporting Afghans.”\n\n“Afghans are bringing and spreading the leprosy virus,” he wrote without offering evidence, falsely claiming that leprosy, which is caused by bacteria, is a viral disease.\n\nBoth posts on the social media platform X have received nearly half a million views, been shared more than 1,000 times, and liked by over 7,000 accounts.\n\nWhat Does The Data Say?\n\nLeprosy in Iran has never been eliminated, but it has declined sharply since 2005, dropping from 79 to six in 2022, according to WHO data. No certified health authority has ever declared leprosy an epidemic in Iran or Afghanistan.\n\nLeprosy is a chronic bacterial infectious disease that mainly affects the skin and peripheral nerves. It is curable but leaving it untreated may cause permanent disabilities.\n\nThe disease spreads via droplets from the nose and mouth through close and frequent contact with untreated individuals.\n\nRising Anti-Afghan Sentiment\n\nAfghans fleeing the Soviet invasion in the 1980s were welcomed in Iran, thanks in large part to the anti-Soviet views of the recently established Islamic republic. But animosity toward the growing Afghan community has only worsened since.\n\nIn recent years -- especially after an influx of migrants following the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021 -- there have been more frequent displays of anti-Afghan sentiment.\n\nOver the past several months, a Persian hashtag that calls the “expulsion of Afghans” a “national demand” has been trending, often boosted by anonymous accounts.\n\nThe UNHCR, the United Nations’ refugee agency, says Iran hosts 780,000 Afghan refugees, in addition to 2.6 million undocumented Afghan nationals.\n\nBut the authorities in Tehran claimed last year that 5 million Afghans were living in Iran illegally, and vowed to deport them. Afghan migrants were later banned from living or working in half of the country’s 31 provinces.\n\nIn recent months, Afghan migrants in Iran have complained to RFE/RL's Radio Azadi about rising harassment, even during deportation.\n\nIran has long said that it does not receive enough financial assistance from international bodies to deal with the number of refugees on its soil.\n\nThe world has long been aware of the scourge of apartheid -- the systemic segregation or discrimination of people based on their race. But what about the institutionalized practice of singling people out for ill-treatment due to their gender?\n\nThe push to recognize \"gender apartheid\" under international law is gaining steam, with oppression against women and girls in Afghanistan and Iran fueling calls for immediate action, but tremendous obstacles remain.\n\nWhat Do They Want?\n\nAdvocates want to clearly define gender apartheid as a crime under international law. Currently, only \"persecution\" on the basis of gender is recognized as a crime against humanity. But rights groups and activists say the concept of persecution does not fully capture the scope of the abuses committed under a system of institutionalized gender apartheid.\n\nThe goal is for the United Nations to make up for this gap by legally shielding women and girls from systemic abuse and violence.\n\nAfghan women's rights defenders are credited with being the first to articulate the concept of gender apartheid in the 1990s, during the Taliban's first regime.\n\nSince the Taliban returned to power in 2021, the hard-line Islamist group has reimposed its oppressive policies against women and girls, including severe restrictions on their appearances, freedom of movement, and right to work and study.\n\nHoda Khamosh, an Afghan women's rights activist, says the recognition of gender apartheid would greatly benefit women's rights in the country.\n\n\"We would be able to hold accountable the authorities and perpetrators of gender-based violence and discrimination against women,\" Khamosh told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian women’s rights activists have said the institutionalized discrimination against women in the Islamic republic amounts to gender apartheid.\n\nUN experts have said the violent enforcement of the hijab law and punishments on women and girls who fail to wear the head scarf could be described as a form of gender apartheid.\n\nWhen Do They Want It?\n\nToday. The United Nations has been considering the adoption of a major treaty that would unite signatories against crimes against humanity.\n\nDozens of rights groups and hundreds of individuals signed a statement in March calling for gender apartheid to be included on the draft list of such crimes.\n\nThe hope is that the UN General Assembly will adopt procedures to begin negotiations on the treaty when it next meets in September.\n\nTough Going\n\nWhile the concept of gender apartheid has increasingly been used by the United Nations and international organizations, particularly in connection with abuses against women and girls in Afghanistan and Iran, there have also been missed opportunities.\n\nDuring UN-hosted talks in Doha with the Taliban in early July, for example, women did not have a seat at the table.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:46 0:00\n\nRights activists calling for the recognition of gender apartheid and for sanctions to be imposed on those responsible accused the UN of giving legitimacy to the Taliban's rule and of betraying its commitment to women's rights.\n\n\"The international community has a moral obligation to ensure the protection of Afghan women’s rights and uphold the principles of justice and equality in any engagement with the Taliban,\" Sima Samar, former chairperson of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), told CIVICUS, a global alliance of civil society organizations.\n\nImprisonment And Death In Iran\n\nLike the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran's clerical regime has been labeled a \"gender apartheid regime\" by rights watchdogs.\n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights activist who lives in exile, is among the key signatories of a global effort to End Gender Apartheid Today.\n\nThe movement, highlighting the international community's successful effort to end apartheid in South Africa decades ago, noted that women in Iran are banned from many fields of study, sporting events, and from obtaining a passport or traveling outside the country without their husband's consent.\n\nThe Iranian authorities' goal is to maintain women's subjugation to men and the state through a system of laws, the movement said. Violations can lead to \"violence, imprisonment, and death.\"\n\n\"The situations in the Islamic Republic of Iran and under the Taliban in Afghanistan are not simply cases of gender discrimination,\" the movement concluded in its call for support.\n\n\"Rather, these systems are perpetuating a more extreme, systematic, and structural war against women designed to dehumanize and repress them for purposes of entrenching power.”\n\nWritten by Michael Scollon with reporting by RFE/RL's Radio Azadi\n\nA group of female Iranian prisoners has warned of a possible wave of executions, pointing to the recent \"shameless and disgraceful\" death sentence handed down to labor activist Sharifeh Mohammadi.\n\nThe group of 16 women said in a letter that prior to last week's presidential election, authorities had slowed down the pace of executions \"to the maximum extent possible before the electoral show.\"\n\n\"However, it will now accelerate the issuance and execution of death sentences and will suppress the families of the victims more than before,\" the letter, which demands the canceling of Mohammadi's punishment, added.\n\nEarlier this month, the Revolutionary Court in the northern city of Rasht said Mohammadi had been convicted on charges of \"armed rebellion against the state\" and included as evidence her membership in an independent labor organization.\n\nShe was also accused of being a member of the banned Komala Kurdish separatist party, which her family denied.\n\n\"[The authorities] want to suppress the voice of protest and demands...of women who are louder now than before in the arena of justice,\" the letter says.\n\nMohammadi’s cousin, Vida Mohammadi, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda that her niece was tortured in prison following her arrest on December 5 and that she had spent several months in solitary confinement.*\n\nVida Mohammadi said Sharifeh Mohammadi was not affiliated with any political organization inside or outside the country.\n\nThe Hengaw rights watchdog has said Mohammadi \"endured mental and physical torture at the hands of Iranian Intelligence interrogators...who sought to extract a forced confession from her.\"\n\nThe U.S.-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, which focuses on Iranian issues, said the death sentence was linked to \"her involvement with an independent labor union.\"\n\n\"This extreme ruling highlights the harsh crackdown on dissent within Iran, particularly against labor activists amid economic turmoil,\" it said.\n\nMajor protests erupted in Gilan Province and throughout the country in 2022 following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish-Iranian woman who had been detained for allegedly flouting Iran's strict dress code for women.\n\nMore than 500 protesters were killed nationwide and thousands arrested during months of unrest.\n\nDomestic and international rights activists have accused Tehran of using the death penalty to intimidate protesters and others following the mass demonstrations.\n\n*CORRECTION: A previous version of this story identified Vida Mohammadi as Sharifeh Mohammadi's aunt. She is a cousin.\n\nIn the early morning of July 9, 1999, students at Tehran University were sleeping off a long day of demonstrating for reforms in Iran when they were awakened to brutal reality.\n\nPlainclothes police and paramilitary volunteers stormed into dormitories, kicking in doors and beating students in their rooms. Some were thrown from windows and at least one student was killed, while hundreds were injured.\n\nWhat had begun as relatively low-level demonstrations against the closure days earlier of a reformist newspaper wouldquickly spread from the capital to other major cities.\n\nOver the course of a few days, at least five protesters would be left dead, hundreds injured, and thousands more detained in what would stand for a decade as the largest antiestablishment protests in Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.\n\nLooking back at the events 25 years later, a former student who unwittingly became the face of the demonstrations against the clerical establishment says the protesters truly believed they could help usher in societal and structural reforms promoted by the reformist political camp.\n\n\"We thought reforms represented a new paradigm, driven by individuals genuinely different and committed to change,\" Ahmad Batebi told RFE/RL's Radio Farda.\n\nThat the violent crackdown came during the presidency of the country's last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami -- who was elected in 1997 on promises of strengthening the rule of law and greater social freedoms -- no longer comes as a surprise.\n\n\"Time has shown that the reformists were not fundamentally different from those entrenched in power, [they were] just simply another facet of the Islamic republic,\" he said.\n\nBatebi was one of thousands of reform-minded Iranian students who took to the streets after the dormitory raid in open defiance of the establishment.\n\nWhen the cover of the British magazine The Economist showed him holding up the blood-stained shirt of a fellow protester who had been shot by security forces in Tehran, it awakened the outside world to the demonstrations.\n\nBut the now-iconic photo also attracted the attention of the Iranian authorities. Batebi was arrested and sentenced to death for his alleged involvement in \"street unrest.\"\n\nNamed a prisoner of conscience by rights groups, Batebi's sentence was eventually reduced to 15 years due to international pressure. He served nine years before fleeing to neighboring Iraq while on medical leave to treat the many ailments he suffered in prison and eventually moved to the United States.\n\nBatebi said that the Islamic republic relied on violent repression from its beginning, pointing to the mass executions of political prisoners in the 1980s and deadly crackdowns against protests in the cities of Mashhad, Qazvin, and Eslamshahr in the 1990s.\n\n\"The Islamic republic habitually employed such methods of suppression, recognizing no other approach,\" Batebi said.\n\nThe harsh response to the student protests of 1999 was \"not unusual,\" Batebi added, because \"the government was accustomed to and prepared for such actions, and knew no other way to operate.\"\n\nThose events simply foreshadowed the establishment's method of dealing with subsequent antiestablishment protests, including student demonstrations in 2003, mass demonstrations against the results of the disputed 2009 presidential election and the suppression of the Green Movement.\n\n\"This is the inherent nature of the Islamic republic and it will continue to operate in this manner,\" Batebi said.\n\nHe also addressed more recent protests, including the 2019-20 protests fueled by water shortages and economic woes, and the Women, Life, Freedom protests of 2022.\n\nAs many as 1,500 demonstrators were reportedly killed during the nationwide protests that broke out in 2019. More than 550 demonstrators were killed in the crackdown against the 2022 protests, which followed the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini and lasted for months.\n\nHuman rights watchdogs say the response was marked by a litany of atrocities carried out by the state, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and rape.\n\nBatebi said the level of suppression to which the state will go has \"surpassed what was experienced at the university dormitories\" in 1999, which was by far eclipsed in scale and in violence by the 2009, 2019, and 2022 protests.\n\nBut so too has the involvement of the general population, he added.\n\n\"Initially, the student movement was at the forefront of social protests, making their suppression highly visible,\" Batebi said. \"However, over the past decade, every segment of society, from teachers to workers and nurses, has been involved.\"\n\nThe former student protester said he saw a \"significant maturity and sophistication among today's activists\" in Iran. But he laments that the reforms the students of his era fought for, including greater political and social freedoms, are essentially dead.\n\n\"From the reform movement that once sought structural changes, only a name remains,\" he said. \"The reforms we see today are vastly different from those initial aspirations and are, in fact, part of the government, deviating slightly from its authoritarian segment while attempting to realign with the long-standing governmental ideals.\"\n\nThe recent victory of Masud Pezeshkian -- who cast himself as a reformist during Iran's snap presidential election after ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May -- will make no real difference, according to Batebi.\n\nBatebi expressed doubt over Pezeshkian's \"reformist\" credentials, but pondered for argument's sake what could happen if he deviated from his alignment with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei or from Raisi's policies.\n\nEven if he Pezeshkian was a \"true democrat, genuinely modern, and eager to implement changes in Iran, how would he achieve this?\" Batebi asked. \"The tools for change are lacking in Iran. There are no institutions outside the supreme leader's control.\"\n\nThis includes the judiciary, media, security forces and military, the Intelligence Ministry, and all influential government bodies \"that could obstruct presidential initiatives\" in domestic and foreign policy.\n\n\"The situation is clear,\" Batebi concluded. \"Regardless of an individual's democratic intentions or transformative aspirations, without the necessary instruments for change, substantial reform is unattainable. Therefore, in my view, the potential for change is virtually nonexistent.\"\n\nWritten by Michael Scollon based on an interview by Nasrin Afshar of RFE/RL's Radio Farda"
