        "text": "Chapter One: Integrity versus Lies and Deceit\n\nThe true value of a community, a nation or a business evolves from the integrity of its members, from their ability to distinguish between right and wrong and to adhere to moral principles. Integrity is learned from the teachings and examples of oneâ€™s parents, teachers, associates and leaders, and from the give and take of life experiences. Integrity is protected by a society that practices justice through law.\n\nOver the years the United States of America has benefited from citizens of integrity who built a society that became the envy of most of the world. Now, however, as we begin the twenty-first century, America is suffering from a disastrous loss of integrity at the highest levels, in both government and business. Of special concern is the lying and deceit that currently plague our White House and Congress. The right-wing Republicans who now lead those institutions have abandoned the truth, representing as true what is known to be false and doing it so effectively that what is false is widely accepted as being true. In so doing they are seriously transforming the choice way of life Americans created over many decades.\n\nIt is time for American patriots to stand up and fight for their cherished way of life."
