They provide us with the online e-commerce platform through which we transact with you.\n\nYour data is stored through Hostinger’s data storage, databases and the general Hostinger application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.\n\nPayment:\n\nIf you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then PrepMebuddy stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.\n\nAll direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.\n\nPCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.\n\nFor more insight, you may also want to read PrepMebuddy’s Terms of Service here or Privacy Statement here.\n\nIn general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.\n\nHowever, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.\n\nFor these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.\n\nIn particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.\n\nAs an example, if you are located in India and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.\n\nOnce you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.\n\nLinks\n\nWhen you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.\n\nChanges and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on the website. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.\n\nIf our company is acquired or merged with another company, your information may be transferred to the new owners so that we may continue to sell products and/or services to you."
