        "text": "High School College Either an IEP or a Section 504 plan drives all accommodations and services, involves the teachers and counselors, and always requires a parent’s signature for students under age 18. No educational plan, and instructors are not contacted except by the student. Parents often may not receive a student’s grades without written permission from the student. Students qualify for public education simply because they are the appropriate age and because they have a disability Otherwise qualified means that a student must meet all entrance and academic requirements, whether or not they receive accommodations. Under IDEA, children with disabilities are entitled to a “Free and Appropriate Public Education.” Students have civil rights for which they must advocate to ensure equal access to higher education. No one is entitled to anything. Public schools are responsible for appropriate assessment of students’ disabilities. Colleges are not required to assess students, but can expect students to provide proof of disabilities within accepted guidelines. Student placement is determined by the child’s team and outlined in the IEP or 504 Plan. Placement must, by law, be in the least restrictive environment. Students are integrated in the college community, and the environment may be adjusted through accommodations. Colleges do not deliberate to select an environment in advance. Common Knowledge: everyone knows about a student’s placement, often times before the student even enters the classroom. Everyone involved in a student’s placement usually signs the educational plan. Need to Know: students must give express permission for college professors to be notified of any disabilities. Students must initiate all actions toward receiving accommodations with each individual professor, for each course, for each semester. Students have the civil right to refuse accommodations they do not want or need. Assessment, physical therapy, speech and language services, personal care and/or any other therapy is provided by the school while the student is in school. College students are responsible for any and all personal services, such as personal or medical care, just as if they were living independently and not attending college."
