        "text": "This is especially important in light of research showing that HIV-negative black men who have sex with men have negative perceptions about taking HIV medication (Int J STD AIDS.?2015;26:1040-1048), and that the fear of being stigmatized lowers the likelihood that they will accept or adhere to PrEP (Health Educ Behav.?2016;43:217-225).\n\nSocial media plays a key role in community engagement, and navigators use everything from Facebook and Twitter, to dating apps (such as Jack’d and Grindr), to the?program website, to the PrEPme smartphone app.\n\nThe peer navigators guide individuals to PrEP providers, try to reduce the associated stigma, and provide information on a wide range of services, such as insurance, dental care, housing, transportation, food services, and trans-friendly resources.\n\n“We’re not just narrowly focused on PrEP,” Sacamano explained. “We’re also linking people to other kinds of support they need” because many of them face inequities that are barriers to PrEP.\n\nSacamano and his colleagues assessed the effectiveness of the outreach efforts in their observational analysis conducted from March 2016 to October 2017.\n\nOf the 4359 contacts made with people in the high-risk population, 612 expressed an interest in follow-up contact and 194 followed through on that.\n\nOf the people who followed through, 58 (30%) were referred for a PrEP consultation, 47 (24%) scheduled an appointment, and 24 (12%) completed intake.\n\nSacamano said he is not surprised by the low intake rate in Baltimore, “given the barriers related to housing, transportation, and employment needs, as well as medical mistrust and the stigma around HIV and sex.”\n\n“These are social determinants and systemic issues that cannot be resolved in a single interaction with a peer navigator,” he explained.\n\nOutreach efforts need to close the gap between awareness and willingness to initiate prevention. “We need to focus on barriers to willingness to initiate PrEP in those at high risk,” said Sacamano.\n\nThe stigma around PrEP services could be eliminated if they were integrated into primary care, rather than being available only in infectious disease, STI, or HIV clinics, he suggested.\n\nThe increased comfort patients feel when they can access PrEP at the primary care level was underscored in a presentation by a pair of nurses from Country Doctor Community Health Centers in Seattle.\n\n“Providing sexual healthcare in a primary care setting reduces the barrier of having to walk into an HIV or STI clinic,” said Claire Siegel, RN, PrEP coordinator.\n\n“We’re able to integrate many things into our PrEP visit, including STI screening, hypertension management, smoking cessation, and vaccinations, so we can really improve the opportunity to educate and advocate for our patients,” she said.\n\nCountry Doctor, which operates two primary care clinics and one urgent care clinic, treats patients regardless of their ability to pay, said copresenter Haley Barker, RN, who founded the center’s nurse-led PrEP program.\n\nPatients at the clinic have proven to be highly effective peer resources. “Our MSM population really tends to self-refer, and many will come in and bring all of their friends,” Barker reported.\n\nMutual support within the community of men who have sex with men has been key to spreading the word, she told?Medscape Medical News. “MSM in our community have strong social networks, and since we do not have the capacity for outreach services, they serve as our best link to those that may be at risk in our community,” she explained.\n\n“Community members having conversations about sexual health and risk-reduction strategies helps reduce the stigma around sex and HIV and will hopefully help bring at-risk individuals out of the shadows to get tested and on PrEP, if appropriate,” Barker added.\n\nThe outreach campaign is part of the Initiative to Maximize Prevention, Access to Care, and Treatment (IMPACT), a program funded by a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the Baltimore City Health Department. Mr Sacamano, Ms Siegel, and Ms Barker have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.\n\nAssociation of Nurses in AIDS Care (ANAC) 2017. Presented November?3, 2017."
