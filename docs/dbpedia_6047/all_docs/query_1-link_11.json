After careful consideration and listening to your valuable feedback, we've decided to pivot PrepMe in a new direction. The current meeting preparation and networking insights product will no longer be available on December 31st, and we're shifting our focus to career and personal transformation. We've noticed a strong interest in topics like learning frameworks, growth in your careers, and transformational experiences. As a result, we're excited to bring you more content and resources to help you thrive in your growth journey. We express our deepest gratitude for your ongoing support and thank each and every one of you who has used PrepMe and followed our growth. Your engagement has been invaluable to us. As we embark on this new chapter focused on your growth journey, we invite you to explore our future projects at prepme.ai, where we'll be sharing insights, blog posts, and our monthly newsletter. Your continued interest means the world to us, and we can't wait to bring you more valuable content in the days ahead. Thank you for being a part of the PrepMe community. We look forward to continuing this journey with you. With Appreciation and Gratitude, Luve Sanghvi"
