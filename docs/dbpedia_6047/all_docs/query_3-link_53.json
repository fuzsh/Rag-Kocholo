        "text": "Jason Farley, PhD, MPH, ANP-BC, FAAN, FAANP, AACRN, longtime Johns Hopkins School of Nursing (JHSON) faculty, professor, and researcher, has been appointed inaugural Leadership and Innovation Endowed Chair.\n\nFunded anonymously, the chair will support the school’s Diversity Signature Initiative to recognize exemplary nurse scholars from racial, ethnic, and gender minority groups, bolster a diverse workforce, and improve health outcomes among underrepresented communities and populations.\n\n“Dr. Jason Farley has led a successful career defined by leadership in diversity and representation for vulnerable communities, locally to globally,” says Sarah Szanton, PhD, RN, FAAN, dean of the School of Nursing. “His research in HIV and other infectious diseases has been groundbreaking. He is a dedicated leader whose skills, knowledge, and expertise will move our school and the work of this chair forward in many ways.”\n\nAs an infectious disease trained epidemiologist and nurse practitioner in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Division of Infectious Disease, Farley has made a world-renowned career providing care for persons at risk or living with HIV, and other infectious diseases including tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections. Globally, and through his adjunct faculty positions at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa and the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia, Farley spent much of his early career investigating strains of antimicrobial resistant MRSA, TB and developing both behavioral and technology-based interventions against multi-drug resistant TB and HIV coinfection.\n\nIn South Africa, Farley’s work has led to sweeping policy changes on the management of drug-resistant TB. Most notably, nurses can now diagnose and manage drug-resistant TB in primary care settings based on his research and collaboration with the National Department of Health in South Africa.\n\nIn the U.S., Farley is founder of the newly formed Center for Infectious Disease and Nursing Innovation (CIDNI), which grew from the school’s longstanding REACH Initiative. REACH provides clinical services to Baltimore City residents living with and at risk for HIV and associated co-infections. He is developer of an app called PrEPme that offers increased patient access to HIV prevention services across Maryland. He designed and implemented www.prepmaryland.org, which serves as the state’s main web portal for helping Marylanders access PrEP.\n\nFarley is Regional Director of the AIDS Education and Training Center, where his focus is on providing clinical capacity building, evidence-based practice, and dismantling stigma that often comes with the diagnosis of HIV or other infectious diseases. He is a Co-Director of the Clinical Core of the Johns Hopkins Center for AIDS Research.\n\nMost recently, Farley has been on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic testing patients, setting up testing facilities, developing innovative personal protective equipment, participating in vaccine clinical trials, and educating the public about prevention strategies such as masking and social distancing. He is also helping to lead a tri-school initiative with the Johns Hopkins Schools of Nursing, Medicine, and Public Health to conduct a comparative effectiveness trial of COVID-19 testing in Baltimore residents during the pandemic and to evaluate the social, mental, and economic impact the pandemic has had among families.\n\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for nurses trained in infectious disease to double our efforts to improve access to care, testing, treatment and adherence to both clinical and public health measures to prevent infection,” says Farley. “As the nations most trusted profession, nurses, and those trained in infectious disease, are an essential part of our health system and public health response. This endowment will help fulfill a long term vision of helping to end HIV in Baltimore and developing the science to address the causes of infectious disease morbidity and mortality among people across the globe.”\n\nYou can watch Farley be formally inducted at the installation ceremony on Thursday, Oct. 14 at 4pm using the following link: https://nursing.jhu.edu/news-events/events/endowed-chairs-ceremony/Leadership-and-Innovation/index.html.\n\n***\n\nLocated in Baltimore, the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing is a globally-recognized leader in nursing education, research, and practice. In U.S. News & World Report rankings, the school is No. 1 nationally for its master’s programs, and No. 2 for DNP programs and its online MSN Healthcare Organizational Leadership options. JHSON is ranked No. 1 for total NIH funding among schools of nursing for fiscal year 2020. In addition, the school is ranked by QS World University as the No. 3 nursing school in the world, No.1 by College Choice for its master’s program, and No. 1 by NursingSchoolHub.com for its DNP program.
