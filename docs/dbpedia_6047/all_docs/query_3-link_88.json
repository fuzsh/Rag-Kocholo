        "text": "What is PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis)?\n\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is an oral medication taken by HIV-negative people to protect them from contracting HIV.\n\nWhen taken daily, or on-demand under the advice of a doctor, PrEP is up to 99% effective at preventing HIV.\n\nVideo courtesy Thorne Harbour Health\n\nWhen to take PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis)\n\nCurrently approved PrEP is a single tablet that contains 2 HIV antiretroviral (ART) medications used to treat HIV. It is usually taken daily.\n\nPrEP can also be taken when you need it (known as PrEP on-demand). It is important to see a GP for guidance on how to follow the strict dosage instructions for protection against HIV.\n\nRemember, PrEP isn’t for everyone and there are other HIV prevention options available.\n\nWhat PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is used for\n\nPrEP is for HIV-negative people at risk of HIV infection. This includes:\n\nMen who have sex with men without using a condom.\n\nHaving a sexual partner who has HIV and is not on treatment, or are at high risk of getting HIV.\n\nPeople who are sexually active and inconsistently use condoms.\n\nYour circumstances and your risk of being exposed to HIV should all play a role in deciding whether PrEP is right for you.\n\nSpeak with your doctor to see if PrEP is your best option to prevent HIV.\n\nWhere to get PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis)\n\nPrEP medication is on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).\n\nAll GPs (doctors) in Australia can prescribe PrEP. If you have a MedicareExternal Link card, it can be purchased at a subsidised cost from pharmacies, with a valid prescription. (Some pharmacies may need to order the medication in, which may take a few days.)\n\nIf you do not have a Medicare card, or cannot afford the subsidised cost, PrEP can be imported through online pharmacies. More information is available from PAN (PrEP Access Now) or the Victorian PrEP Service at the Alfred Hospital (PrEPME Clinic) on 1800 889 887.\n\nIf your doctor is unfamiliar with PrEP or what’s involved in prescribing it, they can call the Victorian PrEP Service at Alfred Hospital, on 1800 889 887.\n\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) effectiveness\n\nStudies show that PrEP is highly effective in preventing HIV when taken consistently as prescribed. It can reduce the risk of getting HIV by up to 99%.\n\nPossible PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) side effects\n\nMost people who take PrEP don’t experience side effects. Some may have mild effects that usually usually disappear within the first month. These include:\n\nnausea\n\nloss of appetite\n\nheadaches.\n\nA small proportion of people on PrEP may develop kidney damage. So it is very important to have kidney tests every 6 months when taking PrEP.\n\nIf you have any concerns about side effects, see your doctor.\n\nImportant things to know about PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis)\n\nAt your first appointment and before starting PrEP, your doctor will check your health and organise some tests including:\n\nan HIV test\n\na full sexually transmissible infection (STI) test\n\nkidney and liver function tests.\n\nYou will also receive information about how to reduce your risk of HIV infection.\n\nPrEP must be taken as prescribed for maximum effective protection.\n\nVisit your doctor every 3 months while on PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis)\n\nSee your GP every 3 months for repeat HIV and STI tests and for a new PrEP prescription.\n\nPrEP can have some side effects, so work with your doctor to monitor your general health.\n\nPrEP does not protect against other sexually transmissible infections (STIs) such as – syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia.\n\nCondoms and lubricant can provide protection against and reduce the risk of spreading an STI.\n\nIt is important to have a sexual health test every 3 months while on PrEP, even if you have no symptoms.\n\nPrEP Access NowExternal Link has more information on where to get PrEP and how much it costs.\n\nHow long to take PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis)\n\nThe length of time people need to be on PrEP medication depends on their personal circumstances.\n\nPeople may stop taking PrEP if:\n\nTheir risk of HIV infection becomes low because of lifestyle changes.\n\nThey don't want to take medication every day or often forget to take their medication. Other ways of preventing HIV infection may work better for you.\n\nMedication side effects are interfering with their life.\n\nBlood tests show the body is reacting to PrEP medication in unsafe ways.\n\nYour doctor may decide there are other options.\n\nStopping PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis)\n\nTalk with your doctor if you are having trouble remembering to take your medication or if you want to stop PrEP.\n\nIt is important to make sure that you continue taking PrEP for 28 days after your last potential exposure to HIV before ceasing it.\n\nOther HIV prevention options\n\nThere are many easy and effective ways to prevent HIV. Other than PrEP, HIV transmission can also be prevented by:\n\nUsing condoms (including female or internal condoms) with water or silicone-based lubricant during anal or vaginal sex.\n\nAlthough there is a low risk of HIV transmission during oral sex, using external condoms on penises or dental dams on vulvas and anuses. This can also help to reduce the risk of other STIs from being passed on.\n\nUsing clean, sterile injecting equipment.\n\nAchieving and maintaining “undetectable” HIV viral loads (U=U) if you have HIV by taking HIV antiretroviral treatment (ART) as prescribed.\n\nGetting regular sexual health checks.\n\nTaking post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) – if you think you have been exposed to HIV.\n\nDepending on your risk factors and lifestyle, you may be more suited to other HIV prevention methods. It is important to find the right prevention method (or combination of methods) that works for you and your sexual partners.\n\nSpeak to your GP or sexual health clinician for more information.\n\nThorne Harbour HealthExternal Link (formerly the Victorian AIDS Council) and PrEP Access Now has more information on PrEP.\n\nWhere to get help"
