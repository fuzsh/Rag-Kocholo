        "text": "Project Description\n\nThis web application was created with two other members in a group. It is an application that helps the user find different ways on how to prepare a fruit. All animations and illustrations are through illustrator by the two designers that I was partnered with. For this application, I mostly used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it fully functional and responsive. For the fruit information, I used JSON data structure. Overall, it was a fun project and it made me realize how much time and effort has to be put into a small app. It taught me how to work better with other people, collaborating our ideas together and taking each others inputs.\n\nRelated Projects"
