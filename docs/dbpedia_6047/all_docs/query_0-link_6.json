        "text": "Kaplan and Princeton Review use one standardized method for teaching their students. PrepMe, instead, uses many. Students communicate online with tutors from top universities such as Harvard, Stanford, and the University of Chicago. PrepMe constantly customizes the program based on the students strengths and weaknesses. Participants raised their SAT scores an average of 305 points, which is twice the average point increase from a Princeton Review or Kaplan course, at 1/3 the price of competing programs. In addition to standardized test preparation, PrepMe offers college application support and tools, many of which are free of charge. PrepMe recently surpassed the 44,000 student mark, and has drawn participants from all over the U.S. and five continents. PrepMe is expanding its test prep to general college prep—reading, writing, and math from the ninth grade on, partnering with its customers and interacting with them constantly."
