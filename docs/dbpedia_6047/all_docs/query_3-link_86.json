        "text": "PrEP is for HIV-negative people who may be at risk of HIV. Many things influence risk, including:\n\nWhether and how often you use condoms;\n\nWhether you know the HIV status of your sexual partners;\n\nWhether your HIV-positive partners are undetectable;\n\nWhether you are having sex with casual partners;\n\nThe types of sex you have (anal, vaginal, oral, front hole etc);\n\nWhether you inject drugs or use methamphetamines during sex.\n\nIt is important to understand what is involved in taking PrEP and to make sure that you can take the medication as prescribed. Your circumstances and your risk of being exposed to HIV should all play a role in deciding whether PrEP is right for you.\n\nIf you decide to take PrEP, you do not need to take it for the rest of your life. There are ways to safely stop using PrEP at any time. Speak with a doctor about what’s best for your circumstances.\n\nWhen a person not on PrEP is exposed to HIV, the virus attaches itself to immune cells and uses them to make more HIV. The newly made HIV then spreads and attaches to more immune cells until they can no longer fight off illnesses and infections. PrEP stops this process before it starts, preventing HIV from making more copies of itself and, therefore, preventing HIV infection.\n\nTo be effective, there has to be enough PrEP in your body to prevent HIV. If there isn’t enough of the drug in your body, then there’s a chance that HIV can enter into the cells within the body.\n\nVery few people experience side effects from using PrEP. For those who do, side effects may include headaches, nausea, or fatigue. Most side effects are usually mild and tend to pass quickly.\n\nIn a handful of people with pre-existing medical conditions, PrEP may lead to a loss of mineral bone density or a decrease in kidney function. These side effects are not problematic in and of themselves, but you must visit your doctor every three months to have your levels checked. If your bone density and kidney function are affected, these levels return to normal after discontinuing PrEP.\n\nIf you experience any side effects you are concerned about, speak with your doctor before stopping PrEP.\n\nAustralian guidelines for taking PrEP have been created by experts in the field of HIV prevention. Currently, only two ways of taking PrEP are recommended; daily PrEP and on-demand PrEP.\n\nDaily PrEP\n\nDaily PrEP involves taking a PrEP pill every day and is the most common way that PrEP is taken.\n\nIf you miss a dose when taking daily PrEP, take it as soon as possible. However, if you’re close to taking your next regular dose, it’s fine to wait. There is no need to take two pills to make up for the missed dose.\n\nIf you miss more than two doses a week, you should speak with your GP or use these simple tips to help remind you to take it daily. You can use a pillbox, keep them next to your bedside table or next to your toothbrush as a daily reminder, take the pill at the same time every day to start a routine or set a smart phone reminder.\n\nOn-Demand PrEP\n\nOn-demand PrEP is a different way of taking PrEP and is extremely effective in preventing HIV. It involves taking two pills 2 to 24 hours before sex, a single pill 24 hours after the double dose, and then another single pill 48 hours after the double dose.\n\nIf you have sex over several days, simply extend your on-demand PrEP by taking one PrEP pill a day until you have two sex-free days where you have taken PrEP.\n\nIt is important that when using on-demand PrEP that you adhere strictly to the dosing regimen to provide the greatest level of protection against HIV. If you miss or are unable to take any of the pills involved, get access to PEP within 72 hours of sex.\n\nAt this stage, there is only clear evidence to support on-demand PrEP for cis-gendered men who have sex with men. If you are a woman (cis or trans), trans man, or heterosexual male, there is no evidence that using on-demand PrEP is effective at preventing HIV. Therefore, it is recommended that you take daily PrEP.\n\nNo matter how you take PrEP, checking in with a doctor every three months for routine tests is part of the PrEP program."
