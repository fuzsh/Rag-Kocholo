        "text": "Support the Center\n\nAccording to the Ohio Suicide Prevention Plan, the LGBTQ+ Community Center of Darke County is exactly what’s needed to intervene in Ohio’s suicide and mental health crisis – It’s needed now more than ever. As importantly, according to a study from the Trevor Project, rates of suicide in LGBTQ+ youth decrease significantly when they access to an affirming space. In January of 2024, our board got together with a goal in mind – Open a safe, supportive, inclusive and welcoming space for LGBTQ+ and allied residents of Darke County and surrounding areas. In March of 2024, we launched our Inaugural Fundraising Campaign, and thanks to the amazing support of our community, partners and sponsors, we were able to secure our 501(c)3 status, insurance, and put down the 1st month’s rent and deposit. The Center was able to officially open its doors on May 1, 2024, and saw upwards of 150 people come through in the first two weeks alone! Today, we continue to raise funds so that we can pay our rent, provide programs and services, and ensure the Center is sustainable for years to come! There are lots of ways to support the Center! We hope you find one that works best for you!"
