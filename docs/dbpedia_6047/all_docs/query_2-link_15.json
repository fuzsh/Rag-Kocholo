        "text": "The Difference Between UK and US Personal Statement\n\nIn one of our last blog posts, we talked about the Common App essay prompts. However, those of you who also wish to apply to universities in the UK need to follow different instructions when writing your personal statements for those universities. Here's why...\n\nWhen you apply to universities in the UK, you need to specify a subject/area you are applying to. That will serve as a basis for your personal statement. While the word limit for the Common App essay is 650 words, the UK Personal Statement has a limit of 4000 characters and 47 lines.\n\nThe structure of your essay will also differ. Here are the questions you need to answer on your UK personal statement:\n\nWhy are you applying to your chosen course(s)?\n\nWhy does this subject interest you?\n\nWhy do you think you're suitable for this course(s)?\n\nDo your current or previous studies relate to the chosen course(s)?\n\nHave you taken part in any other activities that demonstrate your interest in the course(s)?\n\nUniversities like to know the skills you have that will help you on the course, or generally with life at university. List these skills here and any supporting evidence to back up why you are so excited about the courses you have chosen.\n\nInclude any other achievements you’re proud of, positions of responsibility that you hold or have held both in and out of school, and attributes that make you interesting, special or unique.\n\nInclude details of jobs, placements, work experience or voluntary work, particularly if it's relevant to your chosen course(s). Try to link any experience to skills or qualities related to the course\n\nIf you know what you’d like to do after completing the course, explain how you want to use the knowledge and experience that you gain.\n\nInternational Students: Why do you want to study in the UK?"
