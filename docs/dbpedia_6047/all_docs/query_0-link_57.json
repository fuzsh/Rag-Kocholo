        "text": "PleasePrEPMe.org is your home for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP and PEP) access! PrEP is an effective HIV prevention strategy in which an individual who is not living with HIV takes a daily pill to protect themselves from HIV. PrEP is over 90% effective when taken as prescribed. PEP, on the other hand, is a course of medication that can be taken up to 72 hours after a potential exposure to HIV.\n\nBoth PrEP and PEP are helping people take charge of their sex lives as two more effective tools in the HIV prevention toolbox.\n\nPleasePrEPMe.org helps break down barriers to PrEP and PEP access through:\n\nPleasePrEPMe:Directory allows users across the nation to search for providers in their areas on their own, in collaboration with PrEPLocator.org.\n\nPleasePrEPMe:Resources provides local HIV-prevention resources in English and Spanish for patients and providers in all 50 states.\n\nPleasePrEPMe:Connect helps Californians find PrEP/PEP services in their area through live chat, text, and telephone with experienced navigators.

If this sounds like you, you may find these resources useful:\n\nPrEP training from GetSFCBA.org or www.PAETC.org.\n\nChat with us: patients, providers, staff, or anyone else can chat with an experienced PrEP navigator by going to our website: org\n\nCheck out this video we created for front desk staff at your clinic\n\nCheck out our resource pages\n\nPrEP has revolutionized HIV prevention and sexual health for thousands of people across the country and increasingly across the globe.
