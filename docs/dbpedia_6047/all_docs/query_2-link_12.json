Obviously he wants a class, so he doesn’t want quizes to take on his own. he wants to learn and be taught, not figure it out on his own. Taking tests online is so dumb anyways, how does that simulate real testing at all? I don’t know about you, but I don’t take the SAT online.</p>\n\n<p>I know they are, which I why I have the blue book, and I do have a paid subscription to the CB Online course. But I have also beta-tested a private online course, and I learned more there than I did in CB. CB is not the best for learning, but obviously it will have the most real questions.</p>\n\n<p>I totally agree with you, GeorgeS. To start with, college board offers 4 additional practice tests, tons of quizzes, AND explanations for all 12 tests and all quizzes. In fact, tonight I counted up the questions for math between the practice quizzes and the 12 tests they offer and we have close to 1000 practice questions, just for math! Oh, and I have a laser printer so I have printed out the entire course…:\n\n4 tests\n\nthe explanations for all 4 additional tests\n\nexplanations for the 8 tests in the book\n\nall the quizzes explanations – they post the question above the explanation.\n\nmost of it is 2 sided and their are 4 pages on each sheet and side of paper, so I have 8 pages on one sheet of paper… thank god for better than 20/20 vision! I recommend the course</p>\n\n<p>Bigred I know you were hoping for some more, but I gig a google search about prepme, and they have been getting alot of press. </p>\n\n<p>Here is a link to another chicago tribune article:\n\n<a href=“http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/content/education/chi-gve1qqmn6.2mar13,1,3638135.story?coll=chi-education-utl[/url]”>http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/content/education/chi-gve1qqmn6.2mar13,1,3638135.story?coll=chi-education-utl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n<p>It said:\n\n\"One of the newer firms is PrepMe Corp., founded three years ago by Karan Goel, who is chief executive officer and a student at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, where the company has its headquarters. In 2004 Goel was named Small Business Entrepreneur of the Year by the U.S. Small Business Administration.</p>\n\n<p>PrepMe offers online SAT test prep. The company is developing an adaptive electronic learning program that tailors itself to a student’s performance as the student goes through the course, said company spokesman Michael Dworecki, an economics major in the U. of C. Graduate School of Business.</p>\n\n<p>Joe Jewell, a Rhodes Scholar, is PrepMe’s vice president of test administration. In 2001, while still in high school, he wrote “Up Your Score, the Underground Guide to the SAT,” which has sold more than 1 million copies, according to Dworecki.</p>\n\n<p>“Our view is that SAT courses should be written by students who have done well on the SAT and know what it covers,” Dworecki said.</p>\n\n<p>The course costs $500 and allows students to work at their own pace, Dworecki said.\"</p>\n\n<p>I am going to look around some more and see what I can dig up</p>\n\n<p>I don’t endorse online test prep, I prefer books, whic i have over $500 worth of. My favorites are Grammatix, TestMasters, RocketReview. Get those and screw the online courses. I said the course I tested, I learned MORE, not A LOT, lol. I would never pay for an online course, but that is just me, although I did pay for the CB one, I do not consider it is a course, I paid for it to get the solutions that they provide for their blue book.</p>\n\n<p>GeorgeS, you said that you have never learned any tricks from anything besides taking tests, but I have read Grammatix cover to cover twice, and that is the book out of all that have helped me the most. I am not saying that I learned all my stuff from a book, because I did not, but I did learn from from Grammatix, so to say they are all for advertising does not go with my beliefs. I dunno what books you own, but I own most of them, and some have good stuff.</p>"
