It’s a pill you take once a day to help prevent HIV infection.\n\nIf you are HIV negative and want to go on PrEP, you’ll have to get tested to confirm your status along with other lab tests. You must also commit to taking the medication every day and to visit your medical provider every 3 months for follow-up HIV tests and prescription refills.\n\nFind out if you qualify to get PrEP for free or at a lower cost.\n\nFor information and referrals statewide:\n\nPhone or Email Care Directions (602) 241-6100 preppep@aaaphx.org Online Please Prep Me https://www.pleaseprepme.org/\n\nWant help navigating PrEP or just have more question?
