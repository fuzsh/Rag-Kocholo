        "text": "Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a way for people who do not have HIV to help prevent HIV infection by taking a pill every day. When used consistently, PrEP has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at substantial risk.\n\nPrEP is a powerful HIV prevention tool, and can be combined with condoms and other prevention methods to provide even greater protection than when used alone. People who use PrEP must commit to taking the drug daily and seeing their health care provider every 3 months for HIV testing and other follow-up.\n\nWhat is PrEP?\n\nPrEP is short for PrE-Exposure Prophylaxis. It is medicine that can prevent people who may be at-risk for HIV from getting HIV. PrEP can come in two forms: oral medication or an injectable.\n\nTruvada was the first drug approved for use as PrEP for both men and women by the Food & Drug Administration in 2012. In 2019, a second drug, Descovy, was approved by the FDA for use by men. In 2021, the FDA approved of the first ever PrEP injection, called Apretude.\n\nAll forms of PrEP are highly effective when taken as prescribed.\n\nCDC, HIV Basics, PrEP. October 2019.\n\nFDA, FDA Approves Second Drug to Prevent HIV Infection as Part of Ongoing Efforts to End the HIV Epidemic. October 2019.\n\nOral PrEP – Truvada vs. Descovy\n\nTruvada:\n\nApproved for ALL genders\n\nApproved and studied on people who inject drugs.\n\nCan be taken daily, or as needed if taken based on correct 2-1-1 dosing schedule.\n\nA generic version is available, and some insurance companies prefer it because it’s cheaper than brand-named Truvada.\n\nSide effects:\n\nHeadache (7%) and/or abdominal discomfort (3%).\n\nSmall decrease in kidney function, which can improve upon discontinuation. If this is an issue, your provider may recommend Descovy or Apretude.\n\nSlight decrease in bone density, but no increased fractures.\n\nDescovy:\n\nOnly approved for gay & bisexual cisgender men and transgender women.\n\nNot approved for people assigned female at birth who are at risk for HIV through receptive vaginal sex.\n\nMust be taken daily, no as-needed method has been studied.\n\nNo generic version available.\n\nSafe to take with existing kidney issues or a strong family history of kidney disease.\n\nSide effects:\n\nAbdominal discomfort and headaches.\n\nSmall increase in cholesterol.\n\nSlight increase in body weight, but no different than the average yearly amount of weight gain.\n\nMay cause worsening of Hepatitis B.\n\nWhat is On-demand PrEP?\n\nOn-demand PrEP has only been studied with Truvada and is not approved by the FDA.\n\nOnly been studied and recommended for cisgender men and transgender women.\n\nHas not been studied on people assigned female at birth and people who inject drugs.\n\nOn-demand PrEP may be recommended for men who:\n\nExperience bouts of sexual inactivity.\n\nHave impaired kidney function.\n\nDon’t always use a condom.\n\n2-1-1 dosing schedule:\n\nTake 2 pills 2-24 hours before sex (closer to 24 is ideal).\n\nContinue taking one pill every 24 hours for as long as individual is having sexual encounters.\n\nOnce a person stops having encounters, take 2 final doses 24 hours apart.\n\nIf sex occurs again during this interval, the daily dosing should continue with 1 tablet taken daily until 48 hours has passed since last encounter.\n\nWhat about PrEP Injection – Apretude?\n\nApretude injections may be appropriate for:\n\nPeople with significant renal disease.\n\nThose who have had difficult adherence to oral PrEP.\n\nThose who prefer injections and labs every 2-months over a daily pill.\n\nHIV.gov, https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/using-hiv-medication-to-reduce-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis/. January 2022\n\nFDA, https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-second-drug-prevent-hiv-infection-part-ongoing-efforts-end-hiv-epidemic. October 2019\n\nFDA, https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-injectable-treatment-hiv-pre-exposure-prevention. December 2021\n\nHow Effective is PrEP\n\nPrEP pills, Truvada and Descovy can reduce the risk of HIV through sex by about 99% when taken as prescribed. It can prevent HIV through injection drug use by about 74% when taken as prescribed.\n\nFor injectable PrEP, please see the clinical studies on the Apretude website, listed at the link down below.\n\nWhile PrEP is highly effective in preventing HIV, it does not protect against other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs).\n\nCDC, https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep/prep-effectiveness.html. June 2022\n\nApretude website, https://gskpro.com/content/dam/global/hcpportal/en_US/Prescribing_Information/Apretude/pdf/APRETUDE-PI-PIL-IFU.PDF#page=36. February 2023\n\nHow quickly does PrEP start working?\n\nFor receptive anal sex (bottoming), PrEP pills reach maximum protection from HIV after 7 days of daily use.\n\nFor receptive vaginal sex and injection drug use, PrEP pills reach maximum protection at about 21 days of daily use.\n\nNo data is available for insertive anal sex (topping) or insertive vaginal sex.\n\nWe don’t know how long it takes for the PrEP injection to reach maximum protection from sex. To research all information available, please refer to the Apretude website.\n\nCDC, https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep/prep-effectiveness.html. June 2022\n\nApretude website, https://gskpro.com/content/dam/global/hcpportal/en_US/Prescribing_Information/Apretude/pdf/APRETUDE-PI-PIL-IFU.PDF#page=36. February 2023\n\nOnce I start PrEP, can I stop?\n\nFor oral PrEP medication, you can go on and off PrEP at different times in your life, but should do so under the guidance of a health care provider. If you do not take PrEP as prescribed, there may not be enough medicine in your bloodstream to block the virus.\n\nBefore restarting oral PrEP medication, you will need to get tested again for HIV and renew your prescription.\n\nFor the PrEP injection, it’s important to come in for injections and HIV testing every 2 months. To research all information available, please refer to the Apretude website.\n\nCDC, https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep/continuing-prep.html. June 2022\n\nApretude website, https://gskpro.com/content/dam/global/hcpportal/en_US/Prescribing_Information/Apretude/pdf/APRETUDE-PI-PIL-IFU.PDF#page=36. February 2023\n\nWho is PrEP for?\n\nPrEP can help protect you if you don’t have HIV and any of the following apply to you:\n\nYou have had anal or vaginal sex in the pasty six months and you:\n\nHave a sexual partner with HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).\n\nDon’t always use a condom consistently.\n\nHave been diagnosed with a STD in the past 6 months.\n\nYou inject drugs and you:\n\nHave an injection partner with HIV.\n\nShare needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment (for example, cookers).\n\nYou have been prescribed PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) and you:\n\nHave used multiple courses of PEP.\n\nPrEP is for anyone who wants added protection against HIV. Your health care provider can help you decide if PrEP is a good fit for you. You may still choose to take PrEP, even if the behaviors listed above don’t apply to you.\n\nIf you are considering getting pregnant and concerned about HIV, talk to your health care provider about PrEP. PrEP may be an option to help protect you and your baby from getting HIV while you try to get pregnant, during pregnancy, or breastfeeding.\n\nCDC, https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep/prep-decision.html. July 2022\n\nHow much does PrEP cost?\n\nOral PrEP medication is covered by all insurance plans, including Medicaid and Medicare. If you do not have insurance, or have insurance but need help with out-of-pocket costs, there are financial assistance programs that may be able to help.\n\nInjectable PrEP medication is covered by most insurance plans, including Medicaid and Medicare. If you have insurance but need help with out-of-pocket costs, there is an Apretude Savings Program that can help you with these costs. Please refer to the Apretude website for further information. There are currently no programs available for full coverage of the PrEP injection for those with no insurance.\n\nReady, Set, PrEP, https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/ending-the-hiv-epidemic/prep-program. March 2022\n\nGilead Advancing Access, https://www.gileadadvancingaccess.com. 2023\n\nApretude Savings Program, https://apretude.com/apretude-cost. December 2022\n\nHow do I get PrEP?\n\nAny medical professional can prescribe medications. Even if a provider doesn’t prescribe PrEP in particular, they can send a referral to the appropriate location. Look for a provider nearest to you!\n\nWhat about condoms?\n\nPrEP provides protection from HIV, but does not protect against other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs). Condoms are an easily accessible, highly effective means of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV. Condoms are also the only method of protection that prevents both pregnancy and disease. To be effective, condoms must be used correctly and consistently.\n\nFor more information about using external condoms (sometimes called a male condom) and an internal condom (sometimes called a female condom), please refer to the CDC website.\n\nCDC, https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/hiv-prevention/condoms.html. May 2021\n\nWhat is PEP?\n\nPEP is short for Post-Exposure Prophylaxis. It is a medication to be taken in emergency situations to protect against HIV after exposure. It is not intended to be used as a substitute for regular HIV prevention. If you are at an ongoing risk for HIV, ask your health care provider about PrEP.\n\nPEP must be taken within 72 hours of possible HIV exposure. If you are prescribed PEP, you will need to take it daily for 28 days.\n\nTalk immediately to your health care provider, an emergency room provider, or urgent care provider about PEP if you think you may have been exposed to HIV:\n\nDuring sex (for example, if the condom broke).\n\nThrough sharing needles, syringes, or other equipment to inject drugs (for example, cookers).\n\nYou have been sexually assaulted.\n\nCDC, https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/pep/about-pep.html. July 2022\n\nI don’t have insurance, can I still get PrEP?\n\nIf you don’t have insurance, there are resources available that can help pay for PrEP.\n\nThese resources are only for PrEP pills: Truvada & Descovy.
