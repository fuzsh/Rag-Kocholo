We are here to guide, counsel, challenge, suggest and inform. We work with students as individuals to understand who they are beyond the classroom and help them find the \"right fit.\"\n\nThe college counselors meet with students individually and in groups to establish goals and develop four-year high school graduation plans. Each year, the college counseling office hosts college admission advisor visits, seminars, and parent meetings, all designed to give every student and family the information needed to maximize their high school academic experience and navigate the college admission and financial aid process.\n\nCollege Presentations on Campus"
