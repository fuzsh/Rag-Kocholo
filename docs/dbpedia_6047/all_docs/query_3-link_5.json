        "text": "Naviance Family Connection is the web-based college counseling system used by Darlington students to research colleges, assess their choices, and gather data for their application process. Every Upper School student at Darlington has access to free online SAT test prep through our Naviance Family Connection system. The test prep software is called PrepMe. (Darlington has purchased this software for our students’ use. If students were to purchase PrepMe individually, the cost would be $299 per student.)\n\n“PrepMe has built an impressive adaptive learning platform that can deliver academic content based on the needs of each individual student. By emphasizing those areas where students need assistance rather than reviewing areas students have already mastered, learning is more efficient. By focusing on individual needs, students are more engaged, and learning is more effective,“ says Stephen K. Smith, the president of Hobsons K-12. “Our experience shows that when test prep is presented within Naviance Family Connection, students use it more frequently and more intentionally than when it is yet another program available to them.”\n\nPrepMe asks students to take an initial test to determine areas of strength and weakness. Using these results, PrepMe customizes a course for each student, using interactive lessons, quizzes, and full-length tests to create a path to success."
