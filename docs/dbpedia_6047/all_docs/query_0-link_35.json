The website provides national and state-based PrEP resources for the public, press, and other medical providers. PrEP selected Hook 42 for a new site rebuild and migration for their custom Angular site to an SEO, content editor friendly Drupal 8 migration project.\n\nWe audited their custom Angular / MySQL site implementation and estimated the effort to migrate it to Drupal 8. We provided a scalable content strategy, Drupal 8 architecture and implementation, custom feed creation, a progressively decoupled React / Drupal / Google Maps integration, and backend and frontend development. Hook 42 performed manual content migration, developed automated content migrations, and ran device and browser testing of the systems. The team ran SEO and accessibility health checks, Drupal 8 migration scripts, and ran the launch support process for site cutover.\n\nWe continued to work with the PrEP team by providing training to their internal staff, ongoing Drupal 8 development maintenance and support, and feature enhancements."
