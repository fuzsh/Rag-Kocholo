        "text": "What is PrEP?\n\nPrEP is a tablet that is taken by people who are at risk of HIV. PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV by up to 99%.\n\nWhere can I access PrEP?\n\nAll GPs in Australia are able to prescribe PrEP. However PrEP is relatively new in Australia and your GP may not yet be familiar with prescribing it. If you have any difficulty with obtaining a PrEP prescription from your GP get in touch with us. We will help you find a GP in your area who is already familiar with prescribing PrEP so that you don’t have to wait. We will also talk with your GP and offer to provide some education so that they feel confident to prescribe PrEP in the future.\n\nThe Alfred has several PrEP clinics throughout the week, and we can see you here to start you on PrEP. Get in touch to make an appointment.\n\nPAN and PrEP’d websites for Change have a list of GPs that are familiar with prescribing PrEP. See the links below.\n\nHow much does PrEP cost?\n\nThere is a standard PBS co-payment for each script/month of PrEP."
