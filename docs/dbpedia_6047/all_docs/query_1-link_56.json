        "text": "PrEP is an important tool for preventing HIV. However, it’s fairly common to face issues getting insurance and prescription plans to pay for PrEP. Following is information about your insurance rights and expansive resources and tools for getting on PrEP and getting it paid for.\n\nDo you know your PrEP insurance rights?\n\nDid you know that most private health plans must cover PrEP at zero costs to you? In 2021, the US government issued guidelines that most private health plans and Medicaid expansion plans must cover PrEP, because the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave PrEP a Grade A recommendation. For you, this means that you are required to pay ZERO co-pays, co-insurance, or deductibles for your:\n\nMedication,\n\nPrEP provider visits,\n\nLabs,\n\nHIV & STI screenings,\n\nAdherence counseling, and\n\nPregnancy tests.\n\nWhat resources do I need to get on PrEP and get it covered?\n\nThe resources below identify ways to pay for PrEP (including the requirement for zero-cost co-pays), resources to help consumers advocate for their rights, and billing guides for providers to ensure paperwork is coded correctly so insurance plans approve and cover PrEP costs. Additional information on patient assistance programs is available on the Covering the Costs of PrEP and PEP page.\n\nRead about the USPSTF recommendations and learn how to advocate for yourself and your PrEP!"
