        "text": "elc\n\nThis “for students, by students” tutoring program provides peer support for required engineering courses. Structured weekly sessions are led by students who succeeded in each course. A typical session includes instruction, study techniques, and supplementary test preparation.\n\nView the current tutoring schedule on Sharepoint (available by login to the UIC community) or in PDF (available to all).\n\nMSLC\n\nThe Math and Science Learning Center (MSLC) is a welcoming learning environment that provides diverse forms of free academic support to students enrolled in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics introductory courses at UIC.\n\nThrough the MSLC, you will find a friendly team of supporters (Peer Leaders/ Learning Assistants, Faculty, Teaching Assistants, Staff) who are here to help you learn as much as you can during your time at UIC and to help you take the next step in your academic career. Our Peer Leaders and Learning Assistants are familiar with the curriculum each semester as they have direct connections with the courses and work together with Faculty. Please bring questions from your classes, homework problem sets, lab reports, and projects to receive personalized support and to learn, together with your instructors and classmates.\n\nNo appointment is necessary, so please drop-in to our scheduled sessions.\n\nPlease reach out to us if you have any questions, as we are always here for support! Please contact our team by email (mslc@uic.edu) or Live Chat.\n\nprepme\n\nEach summer, the Preparation for Majoring in Engineering (PREP-ME) program creates a positive, motivating, welcoming classroom environment for incoming freshmen while priming them for the challenges of engineering.\n\nParticipants in this five-week session receive a refresher in pre-calculus, learn fundamental concepts in engineering, and interact with corporate partners. They become familiar with the faculty and staff who will support them during their time at UIC Engineering, as well as with the technical and academic resources they will need to excel in their classes.\n\nPreparation for Majoring in Engineering is offered at no cost to all incoming College of Engineering freshmen. Find additional information and registration procedures on the website of UIC Summer College, of which this program is a part.\n\nSWE\n\nThe Society of Women Engineers (SWE) coordinates many events throughout the academic year, ranging from attending conferences to conducting outreach events for elementary school students. They focus on academic and professional development to prepare students for graduate school and/or the workforce. They also strive to provide members with many resources to strengthen their leadership and communication skills vital to any career.\n\nFor more information about SWE at UIC, including membership and upcoming events, visit https://swe.students.uic.edu/ or https://www.instagram.com/sweatuic/."
