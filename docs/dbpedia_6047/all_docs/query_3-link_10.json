        "text": "Building on its efforts to encourage HISD high school students’ success on SAT testing, the district is now providing for free a proven online coaching course that would ordinarily cost a family up to $500 to buy.\n\nPrepMe, a personalized PSAT/SAT test-preparation program, is available to all district students in grades 9–11. On average, PrepMe increases test scores dramatically, with some students reporting increases of more than 200 points.\n\nStudents access PrepMe by logging into their Naviance Family Connection account and clicking the “PrepMe” link under the Resources column on the left-hand side of the page. A brief diagnostic for each section of the SAT gauges the student’s strengths and weaknesses and creates a personalized week-by-week study plan. Practice and personalization are the keys to success on these standardized tests, and PrepMe focuses instruction where each individual needs it most. PrepMe has more than 60 hours of online multimedia lessons, as well as quizzes and full-length practice tests. Rather than teaching tricks or shortcuts, PrepMe focuses on true learning and content mastery.\n\n“We want to give all our students the opportunity to be successful on the PSAT and SAT,” said Assistant Superintendent of College Readiness Rick Cruz. “If they can get online, they can access the PrepMe lesson plans and practice exams.”\n\nStudents at HISD PowerUp schools can use their laptops to work through the course at their own pace. HISD’s Teacher Development Specialists are in the process of training teachers on PrepMe so that they can assist students as needed.\n\nSince 2010, all HISD students in grades 9-11 have had the opportunity to take the PSAT test for free, and since March 2012, every HISD junior has taken the SAT exam during regular class time for free. The SAT will be administered at all HISD high school campuses at no cost on April 16, which gives students two months of coaching time with the new course.\n\nPrepMe is fully integrated with Naviance, HISD’s college and career readiness platform. Naviance helps students, families, and counselors develop roadmaps for student success that include individualized course plans for students and help with the college-application process. Naviance also reports and tracks outcomes for each individual student.\n\nHISD students in 11th grade can also access the College Board’s Official SAT Online Course through their College Access Coordinator or Counselor. Although this course also has interactive lessons and official practice tests, it is not personalized or adapted to each individual student."
