The authors would like to acknowledge the following funding sources: Gilead, Inc; Baltimore City Health Department Early Intervention Services (EIS) Grant Supported by the Ryan White Program; Health Department Demonstration Projects to Reduce HIV Infections and Improve Health Outcomes for Men Who Have Sex with Men of Color at Risk for and Living with HIV Infection (Baltimore City Health Department Grant #PS15-1506); and ViiV Healthcare.

This paper evaluates the impact of outreach activities led by nurse supervised community healthcare workers (CHWs) on the PrEP care cascade. Methods: This is an observational programmatic evaluation of LGBTQ + community outreach between March 1, 2016, to March 31, 2020, as part of a public health initiative. Descriptive statistics are used to characterize the data by outreach type. Results: 2,465 participants were reached. Overall, a PrEP appointment was scheduled for 94 (3.8%) with 70 (2.8%) confirmed to have completed a PrEP visit. Success for each type of community outreach activity was evaluated with virtual models outperforming face-to-face. Face-to-face outreach identified nine persons among 2,188 contacts (0.41%) completing an initial PrEP visit. The website prepmaryland.org identified 4 among 24 contacts (16.7%) and the PrEP telephone/text warm-line identified 18 among 60 contacts (30%). The PrEPme smartphone application identified 39 among 168 contacts (23.2%). Conclusions: Face-to-face community outreach efforts reached a large number of participants, yet had a lower yield in follow-up and confirmed PrEP visits. All virtual platforms reached lower total numbers, but had greater success in attendance at PrEP visits, suggesting enhanced linkage to care.\n\nAB - Purpose: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) prevents HIV yet uptake remains suboptimal across the United States.
