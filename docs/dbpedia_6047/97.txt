PleasePrEPMe.org is your home for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP and PEP) access! PrEP is an effective HIV prevention strategy in which an individual who is not living with HIV takes a daily pill to protect themselves from HIV. PrEP is over 90% effective when taken as prescribed. PEP, on the other hand, is a course of medication that can be taken up to 72 hours after a potential exposure to HIV.

Both PrEP and PEP are helping people take charge of their sex lives as two more effective tools in the HIV prevention toolbox.

PleasePrEPMe.org helps break down barriers to PrEP and PEP access through:

PleasePrEPMe:Directory allows users across the nation to search for providers in their areas on their own, in collaboration with PrEPLocator.org.

PleasePrEPMe:Resources provides local HIV-prevention resources in English and Spanish for patients and providers in all 50 states.

PleasePrEPMe:Connect helps Californians find PrEP/PEP services in their area through live chat, text, and telephone with experienced navigators. In English and Spanish.

PleasePrEPME is excited to assist people in better understanding whether PrEP is right for them, helping them find a PrEP or PEP-friendly provider, and answer questions about navigating insurance coverage.

They also provide support to providers who are already prescribing PrEP or who are interested in doing so. If this sounds like you, you may find these resources useful:
