What’s PrEP?

It’s Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). It’s a pill you take once a day to help prevent HIV infection.

If you are HIV negative and want to go on PrEP, you’ll have to get tested to confirm your status along with other lab tests. You must also commit to taking the medication every day and to visit your medical provider every 3 months for follow-up HIV tests and prescription refills.

Find out if you qualify to get PrEP for free or at a lower cost.
