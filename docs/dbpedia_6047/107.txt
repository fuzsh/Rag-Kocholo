PleasePrEPMe.org, the searchable, location-based California PrEP provider directory, has been launched! Included are 188 PrEP providers in half of the counties across the state of California. This statewide directory was born out of the original Bay Area PrEP Provider list, a collaboration between HIVE and City Clinic. Please take a look at the website at www.pleaseprepme.org, which features local PrEP s/heroes; and see the press release below for more info.

The launch of the new website coincides with open enrollment season. It will be a valuable resource for consumers who are currently looking to find or switch PrEP providers in California.

#PleasePrEPMe to join the conversation online.
