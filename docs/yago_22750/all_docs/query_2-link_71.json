        "text": "Um enfoque antropolÃ³gico para o ensino de astronomia no nÃ­vel mÃ©dio\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCosta, G. B.; Jafelice, L. C.\n\n2003-08-01\n\nHÃ¡ uma enorme carÃªncia de materiais didÃ¡tico-pedagÃ³gicos em astronomia para professores do ensino mÃ©dio, sobretudo materiais que explorem tambÃ©m aspectos humanÃ­sticos. A origem do Universo Ã© um bom exemplo desta constataÃ§Ã£o central. Embora tal origem teve explicaÃ§Ãµes culturais diversas, os professores nÃ£o tÃªm informaÃ§Ãµes sobre isso e muito menos material que trabalhe diferentes visÃµes de mundo e treinamento que os capacite a abordÃ¡-las devidamente. ConseqÃ¼entemente o ensino de astronomia costuma ser tecnicista e dissociado do aspecto humano que alimenta o grande interesse e curiosidade que esses temas despertam. Aqui apresentamos propostas visando contribuir para reverter esse quadro e trabalhamos distintas visÃµes de Universo: espontÃ¢neas, autÃ³ctones e cientÃ­ficas. Desenvolvemos prÃ¡ticas, materiais instrucionais e textos para viabilizar a adoÃ§Ã£o de um enfoque antropolÃ³gico para o ensino de astronomia no nÃ­vel mÃ©dio, no qual as culturas humanÃ­stica e cientÃ­fica sejam integradas de uma maneira contextualizada e eficaz para aquele ensino. Estas propostas foram aplicadas em um curso de treinamento para professores da rede pÃºblica de diferentes disciplinas. A receptividade dos professores Ã abordagem proposta e os resultados alcanÃ§ados foram muito estimulantes. Destes, destacamos: produÃ§Ã£o de roteiros de atividades; desenvolvimento de prÃ¡ticas didÃ¡tico-pedagÃ³gicas especÃ­ficas (e.g., encenaÃ§Ã£o de mitos; danÃ§a primordial guarani; \"criaÃ§Ã£o\" de constelaÃ§Ãµes e interpretaÃ§Ãµes pluriculturais; etc.); e sugestÃµes concretas para a efetiva realizaÃ§Ã£o de um ensino interdisciplinar contextualizado, onde questÃµes cosmogÃ´nicas servem de mote para iniciar tal ensino. Discutimos estes resultados e como o enfoque adotado pode instrumentalizar os professores para leituras de mundo que incluem naturalmente aspectos culturais, sociais e histÃ³ricos associados aos temas estudados.

S.; Ferreira, J. L.\n\n2003-08-01\n\nUma das partes mais importantes de um satÃ©lite Ã© o controle de atitude do mesmo. E se tratando de um satÃ©lite cientÃ­fico, a atenÃ§Ã£o para este sistema deve ser redobrada. Uma possibilidade atraente para executar esta tarefa Ã© a propulsÃ£o elÃ©trica. Aqui, mostraremos resultados obtidos pelo propulsor Ã plasma PHALL-01, desenvolvido na Universidade de BrasÃ­lia entre 2000 e 2003. Este Ã© derivado do propulsor russo SPT-100 (Stationary Plasma Thruster), mas com o emprego inovador de um arranjo de imÃ£s permanentes como fonte do campo magnÃ©tico, este Ãºltimo o agente da aceleraÃ§Ã£o do plasma. Esta alteraÃ§Ã£o foi motivada pelo objetivo de que o mesmo operasse com o mÃ­nimo de potÃªncia elÃ©trica. A partir da formulaÃ§Ã£o teÃ³rica do mecanismo de aceleraÃ§Ã£o, tendo como base as equaÃ§Ãµes da magnetohidrodinÃ¢mica, pode-se obter vÃ­nculos sob os quais o propulsor pudesse ser construÃ­do. O mais forte destes Ã© o que dita a topologia do campo magnÃ©tico. Sendo assim, foram realizadas simulaÃ§Ãµes computacionais, que definiram a geometria do propulsor. ApÃ³s construÃ­do, este foi diagnosticado usando-se sondas de Langmuir e analisadores de energia. Como resultados, obtivemos a distribuiÃ§Ã£o espacial da temperatura, densidade e potencial do plasma, bem como a distribuiÃ§Ã£o angular do feixe produzido pelo mesmo em vÃ¡rios regimes de operaÃ§Ã£o. O espectro de energia do feixe de plasma tambÃ©m foi medido, indicando Ã­ons de atÃ© 560eV. Combinando estes resultados, calculou-se o empuxo do propulsor: 84mN; e o impulso especÃ­fico: 1083s. Estes demonstram que o mesmo estarÃ¡ qualificado, num futuro prÃ³ximo, para o emprego no controle de atitude de satÃ©lites cientÃ­ficos, ou atÃ© mesmo como parte do conjunto propulsor primÃ¡rio, responsÃ¡veis pela transferÃªncia de Ã³rbitas.\n\nRespostas religiosas Ã aids no Brasil: impressÃµes de pesquisa acerca da Pastoral de DST/Aids da Igreja CatÃ³lica1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSeffner, Fernando; Silva, Cristiane GonÃ§alves Meireles da; Maksud, Ãvia; Garcia, Jonathan; Rios, LuÃ­s Felipe; Natividade, Marcelo; Borges, Priscila Rodrigues; Parker, Richard; Terto, Veriano\n\n2009-01-01\n\nO texto encontra-se estruturado em quatro partes.

Se auscultaron las practicas educativas que utilizan maestras consideradas constructivistas y la correspondencia de sus practicas educativas con los elementos esenciales de la didactica que proponen los teoricos de los planteamientos constructivistas. Se ausculto, ademas, a que vision del enfoque constructivista responden las expresiones de las maestras acerca de su practica educativa y como compara con su quehacer, a la luz de los elementos esenciales de las visiones constructivistas piagetiana, social y radical. Se utilizo el diseno de estudio descriptivo de caso multiple. El estudio se baso en entrevistas a profundidad, revision de documentos y observacion no participativa a la sala de clases. El contexto fueron tres escuelas publicas de la Region Educativa de San Juan, una elemental, una intermedia y una superior. Los resultados confirmaron que la transicion hacia el enfoque constructivista es un proceso que toma tiempo, dedicacion y la participacion en adiestramientos y readiestramientos acerca del nuevo enfoque. Las maestras coinciden en la mayoria de las practicas educativas que utilizan para implantar el enfoque constructivista de ensenanza y difieren en algunas debido, probablemente, a que han tenido que adaptarlas a los correspondientes niveles de ensenanza: elemental, intermedio y superior. Dos de las maestras planifican por conceptos generadores, mientras que una de ellas planifica siguiendo la guia que recibe del Departamento de Educacion. Difieren ademas, en el enfasis que confieren al inquirir cientifico. Con relacion a la correspondencia entre la vision manifestada por las maestras a la luz de las visiones piagetiana, social y radical, aparentemente, las preguntas del protocolo de entrevistas no lograron evocar la informacion con suficiente profundidad, por lo que la investigadora tuvo que inferir las visiones de las\n\nUm Breve BalanÃ§o dos Estudos em Astronomia e EducaÃ§Ã£o no Brasil no PerÃ­odo de 2010 a 2013\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGoncalves, Erica de Oliveira; Kern, C.\n\n2014-10-01\n\nNo Brasil, as pesquisas em ensino de astronomia para a EducaÃ§Ã£o BÃ¡sica vem ganhando destaque.

Some assessments including anthropometric assessment, casual blood pressure measurement, and ankle-brachial index have an established clinical application while others including pulse wave velocity, heart rate variability, and carotid intima-media thickness have no established application and do not have reference values for healthy Brazilian population but may be important predictors of cardiovascular outcomes. Blood pressure measurement following postural change maneuver was included in the ELSA-Brasil because it has not been much tested in epidemiological studies. Innovative approaches were developed for assessing the ankle-brachial index using an automatic device instead of the mercury column to measure blood pressure and for assessing the anterior-posterior diameter of the right lobe of the liver by ultrasound for quantitative assessment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. All ELSA-Brasil subjects were younger (35 years or more) than those included in other cohorts studying subclinical atherosclerosis. The inclusion of younger individuals and a variety of assessments make the ELSA-Brasil a relevant epidemiology study nationwide and worldwide.\n\nPhysical activity in Brazil: lessons from ELSA-Brasil. Narrative review.\n\nPubMed\n\nPitanga, Francisco JosÃ© Gondim; Almeida, Maria ConceiÃ§Ã£o Chagas; Queiroz, Ciro Oliveira; Aquino, Estela Maria LeÃ£o de; Matos, Sheila Maria Alvim\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) was conducted among civil servants at six higher education institutions located in six Brazilian state capitals. The objective of this review was to identify the publications produced within the scope of ELSA-Brasil that analyzed the participants' physical activity. Review study using baseline data from ELSA-Brasil. Narrative review of Brazilian studies on physical activity produced using data from ELSA-Brasil participants. The prevalence of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) among ELSA-Brasil participants was low (44.1% among men and 33.8% among women). The main factors associated were social (higher schooling and family income), environmental (living in places with conditions and opportunities for physical activity) and individual (not being obese, being retired, not smoking and positive perception of body image). The perception of facilities for walking in the neighborhood was positively associated with both LTPA and commuting-related physical activity. An active lifestyle was a protective factor against several cardiometa-bolic variables (hypertension, diabetes, lipid abnormalities and cardiovascular risk over the next 10 years). Comparison between LTPA and commuting-related physical activity showed that only LTPA had a protective effect against arterial hypertension. The prevalence of physical activity among ELSA-Brasil participants was low. The main determinants were social, environmental and personal. LTPA had a greater protective efect on cardio-metabolic outcomes than did commuting-related physical activity.\n\nCarotid intima-media thickness in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil): a narrative review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantos, Eduardo Henrique Sena; Santos Neto, Pedro JosÃ© Dos; Santos, Itamar de Souza\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCarotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), as measured by ultrasound, has been used in large studies as a non-invasive marker for subclinical atherosclerosis. The Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) is a cohort of 15,105 civil servants in six Brazilian cities that included CIMT evaluation in its baseline assessment. The aim of the present narrative review was to provide an overview of ELSA-Brasil CIMT articles published up to July 31, 2017. Narrative review of ELSA-Brasil CIMT studies using baseline assessment data. We searched PubMed for the terms \"ELSA-Brasil\" and \"intima-media\". This search yielded 21 published articles using CIMT data from the ELSA-Brasil baseline assessment, which were included in this review. We also present information about intima-media thickness assessment from ongoing onsite reevaluations of the study participants. Most published studies focused on the association with traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors. Studies also presented information about the ELSA-Brasil CIMT protocol at baseline and CIMT value distribution in this large sample. Analyses on the ELSA-Brasil data led to important insights on CIMT interpretation and physiology. Besides the highlighted contributions which have already been made in this field, new data gathered during the ongoing third onsite assessment will enable investigation of substantially new research questions.\n\nImproving weather modeling in South America through IDD-Brasil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChagas, G. O.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nThe IDD-Brasil constitutes of an international collaboration among Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (LPM/UFRJ), Centro de PrevisÃ£o de Tempo e Estudos ClimÃ¡ticos (CPTEC/INPE) and the Unidata Program Center (Unidata/UCAR), which connects several universities and research centers across the Americas in a network to share real-time hydro meteorological data. Using this network as a new path to deliver and acquire observational data, IDD-Brazil participants are capable of receiving observational data from GTS (Global Telecommunication System), locally ingested data from several automatic weather stations networks (mesonets) from INPE, the entire array of METAR and SYNOP observations, and several model outputs and satellite imagery. During recent years Numerical Models have been used constantly, especially in mesoscale research, but the lack of a dense observational network in South America leads to several constraints during the data assimilation and model validation. Since the IDD-Brasil offers an improved and simple method to have new datasets readily accessible, it has been used continuously as a new manner to distribute surface observations that are not currently available in GTS, such as several mesonets in Brazil that account for an increase in data density. Through the usage of data ingested in IDD-Brasil as guess fields it is possible to study how the assimilation in several global models frequently used as initial conditions for mesoscale simulations can be affected, since in certain areas in Brazil the density of data nearly doubles if compared to GTS. Therefore it is also possible to better validate the results generated in mesoscale simulations, in view of the fact that the network has an improved spatial distribution. It is expected that the increase of locally held numerical model output from South American institutions in IDD- Brasil leads to an increased awareness of the need to constantly validate these results with observational data, thus\n\n[Design and implementation of the ELSA-Brasil biobank: a prospective study in a Brazilian population].\n\nPubMed\n\nPereira, Alexandre C; Bensenor, Isabela M; Fedeli, Ligia M; Castilhos, Cristina; Vidigal, Pedro G; Maniero, Viviane; Leite, Claudia M; Pimentel, Robercia A; Duncan, Bruce B; Mill, Jose Geraldo; Lotufo, Paulo A\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe Brazilian Longitudinal Study for Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) is a multicenter prospective cohort of civil servants designed to assess the determinants of chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. The present article describes the main design and implementation points of the ELSA-Brasil biobank project. Economic, political, logistical and technological aspects of this study are characterized. Additionally, it discusses the final biorepository protocol and the facilities implemented to achieve this objective. The design and implementation process of the ELSA-Brasil biobank took three years to be performed. Both the central and local biobanks were built according to the best biorepository techniques, using different technological solutions for the distinct needs expected in this study.\n\n[ELSA-Brasil strategies for outcome identification, investigation and ascertainment].\n\nPubMed\n\nBarreto, Sandhi Maria; Ladeira, Roberto Marini; Bastos, Maria do Socorro Castelo Branco de Oliveira; Diniz, Maria de FÃ¡tima Haueisen Sander; Jesus, Elcimara Amorim de; Kelles, Silvana MÃ¡rcia Bruschi; Luft, Vivian Cristine; Melo, Enirtes Caetano Prates; Oliveira, Elizabete Regina AraÃºjo de\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe article describes the strategies adopted by the Brazilian Longitudinal Study for Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) for participation and retention of subjects. This is key to ensure internal validity of longitudinal studies, and to identify, investigate, and ascertain outcomes of interest. The follow-up strategies include annual telephone contacts with new assessments and interviews every three to four years this approach aims to identify transient outcomes (reversible or not), permanent outcomes as well as complications related to the progression of major diseases--cardiovascular diseases and diabetes--to be studied. Telephone interviews are designed to monitor subjects' health status and to identify potential health-related events such as hospital admissions, medical visits or pre-selected medical procedures. Subjects are also encouraged to report to the ELSA-Brasil team any new health-related events. When a potential event is identified, a thorough investigation is carried out to collect relevant information about that event from medical records. All data are blinded and reviewed and analyzed by a medical expert committee. Incident outcome ascertainment follows well-established international criteria to ensure data comparability and avoid misclassification. In addition to these strategies, the occurrence of health-related events is also investigated through linkage of secondary databases, such as national mortality and hospital admission databases. Accurate identification of outcomes will allow to estimating their incidence in the study cohort and to investigate the effect of the exposures studied in the ELSA-Brasil at baseline and at its subsequent waves.\n\nParylene supported 20um*20um uncooled thermoelectric infrared detector with high fill factor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nModarres-Zadeh, Mohammad J.; Carpenter, Zachary S.; Rockley, Mark G.; Abdolvand, Reza\n\n2012-06-01\n\nPresented is a novel design for an uncooled surface-micromachined thermoelectric (TE) infrared (IR) detector. The detector features a P-doped polysilicon/Nichrome (Cr20-Ni80) thermocouple, which is embedded into a thin layer of Parylene-N to provide structural support. The low thermal conductivity (~0.1W/m.K), chemical resistance, and ease of deposition/patterning of Parylene-N make it an excellent choice of material for use in MEMS thermal detectors. This detector also features an umbrella-like IR absorber composed of a three layer stack of NiCr/SiN/NiCr to optimize IR absorption. The total device area is 20 um * 20 um per pixel with an absorber area of ~19 um * 19 um resulting in a fill factor of 90%. At room temperature, a DC responsivity of ~170V/W with a rise time of less than 8 ms is measured from the fabricated devices in vacuum when viewing a 500K blackbody without any concentrating optics. The dominant source of noise in thermoelectric IR detectors is typically Johnson noise when the detectors are operating in an open circuit condition. The fabricated detectors have resistances about 85KOhm which results in Johnson noise of about 38nV/Hz^0.5. The D* is calculated to be 9 * 106 cm*Hz0.5/ W. Preliminary finite element analysis indicates that the thermal conduction from the hot junction to the substrate through the TE wires is dominant ( GTE >> Gparylene) considering the fabricated dimensions of the parylene film and the TE wires. Thus, by further reducing the size of the TE wires, GTE can be decreased and hence, responsivity can be improved while the parylene film sustains the structural integrity of the cell.\n\nGenome analysis of Daldinia eschscholtzii strains UM 1400 and UM 1020, wood-decaying fungi isolated from human hosts\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChan, Chai Ling; Yew, Su Mei; Ngeow, Yun Fong\n\nBackground: Daldinia eschscholtzii is a wood-inhabiting fungus that causes wood decay under certain conditions. It has a broad host range and produces a large repertoire of potentially bioactive compounds. However, there is no extensive genome analysis on this fungal species. Results: Two fungal isolates (UM 1400 and UM 1020) from human specimens were identified as Daldinia eschscholtzii by morphological features and ITS-based phylogenetic analysis. Both genomes were similar in size with 10,822 predicted genes in UM 1400 (35.8 Mb) and 11,120 predicted genes in UM 1020 (35.5 Mb). A total of 751 gene families were shared among both UM isolates,moreÂ Â» including gene families associated with fungus-host interactions. In the CAZyme comparative analysis, both genomes were found to contain arrays of CAZyme related to plant cell wall degradation. Genes encoding secreted peptidases were found in the genomes, which encode for the peptidases involved in the degradation of structural proteins in plant cell wall. In addition, arrays of secondary metabolite backbone genes were identified in both genomes, indicating of their potential to produce bioactive secondary metabolites. Both genomes also contained an abundance of gene encoding signaling components, with three proposed MAPK cascades involved in cell wall integrity, osmoregulation, and mating/filamentation. Besides genomic evidence for degrading capability, both isolates also harbored an array of genes encoding stress response proteins that are potentially significant for adaptation to living in the hostile environments. In conclusion: Our genomic studies provide further information for the biological understanding of the D. eschscholtzii and suggest that these wood-decaying fungi are also equipped for adaptation to adverse environments in the human host.Â«Â less\n\nGenome analysis of Daldinia eschscholtzii strains UM 1400 and UM 1020, wood-decaying fungi isolated from human hosts\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nChan, Chai Ling; Yew, Su Mei; Ngeow, Yun Fong; ...\n\n2015-11-18\n\nBackground: Daldinia eschscholtzii is a wood-inhabiting fungus that causes wood decay under certain conditions.

S.; Megid Neto, J.\n\n2003-08-01\n\nNeste trabalho sÃ£o apresentados os resultados de uma pesquisa do tipo estado da arte sobre teses e dissertaÃ§Ãµes defendidas no Brasil e relativas ao ensino de Astronomia. Teve por objetivo identificar essa produÃ§Ã£o e conhecer as principais tendÃªncias da pesquisa nesse campo. O procedimento inicial consistiu de um levantamento bibliogrÃ¡fico junto ao Centro de DocumentaÃ§Ã£o em Ensino de CiÃªncias (CEDOC) da Faculdade de EducaÃ§Ã£o da UNICAMP e ao Banco de Teses da CAPES disponÃ­vel na Internet. Foram localizadas 13 dissertaÃ§Ãµes de mestrado e 3 teses de doutorado, as quais foram estudadas em funÃ§Ã£o dos seguintes aspectos: instituiÃ§Ã£o, ano de defesa, nÃ­vel escolar abrangido no estudo, foco temÃ¡tico do estudo e gÃªnero de trabalho acadÃªmico. Deste conjunto de pesquisas, 13 (81,3%) delas foram defendidas a partir da segunda metade dos anos 90, indicando uma preocupaÃ§Ã£o mais recente com temas relativos ao ensino de Astronomia no conjunto da produÃ§Ã£o acadÃªmica em programas de pÃ³s-graduaÃ§Ã£o no Brasil. Verificou-se que 43,7% dos trabalhos foram produzidas na USP e 18,8% na UNICAMP. Quanto ao nÃ­vel escolar abrangido nos estudos, predominaram os estudos direcionados ao Ensino Fundamental de 5a a 8a sÃ©ries (62,5%). No que diz respeito ao foco temÃ¡tico das pesquisas, as principais tendÃªncias voltaram-se: 56,3% para ConteÃºdo e MÃ©todo; 43,8% para ConcepÃ§Ãµes do Professor; 37,5% para CurrÃ­culo e Programas; 37,5% para Recursos DidÃ¡ticos. Quanto ao gÃªnero de trabalho acadÃªmico, verificou-se que 43,8% sÃ£o de Pesquisa Experimental e 31,3% de Pesquisa de AnÃ¡lise de ConteÃºdo. Estudos de revisÃ£o bibliogrÃ¡fica como este visam colaborar com a divulgaÃ§Ã£o ampla da produÃ§Ã£o acadÃªmica em determinada Ã¡rea, traÃ§ando algumas de suas tendÃªncias.

This device provided volume data for each urine void from multiple crewmembers and allowed samples of each to be taken and returned to Earth for post-flight analysis. There were a number of design flaws in the original instrument including the presence of liquid carry-over producing invalid \"actual\" micturition volumes and cross-contamination between successive users from residual urine in \"dead\" spots\". Additionally, high or low volume voids could not be accurately measured, the on-orbit calibration and nominal use sequence was time intensive, and the unit had to be returned and disassembled to retrieve the volume data. These problems have been resolved in a new version, the International Space Station (ISS) UMS, that has been designed to provide real-time in-flight volume data with accuracy and precision equivalent to measurements made on Earth and the ability to provide urine samples that are unadulterated by the device. Originally conceived to be interfaced with a U.S.-built Waste Collection System (WCS), the unit now has been modified to interface with the Russian-supplied Sanitary Hygiene Device (ASY). The ISS UMS provides significant advantages over the current method of collecting urine samples into Urine Collection Devices (UCDs), from which samples are removed and returned to Earth for analyses. A significant future advantage of the UMS is that it can provide an interface to analytical instrumentation that will allow real-time measurement of urine bioanalytes allowing monitoring of crewmember health status during flight and the ability to provide medical interventions based on the results of these measurements. Currently, the ISS UMS is scheduled to launch along with Node-3 on STS-130 (20A) in December 2009. UMS will be installed and scientific/functional verification\n\nRecovery Act: Novel Kerf-Free PV Wafering that provides a low-cost approach to generate wafers from 150um to 50um in thickness\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFong, Theodore E.\n\n2013-05-06\n\nThe technical paper summarizes the project work conducted in the development of Kerf-Free silicon wafering equipment for silicon solar wafering. This new PolyMax technology uses a two step process of implantation and cleaving to exfoliate 50um to 120um wafers with thicknesses ranging from 50um to 120um from a 125mm or 156mm pseudo-squared silicon ingot. No kerf is generated using this method of wafering. This method of wafering contrasts with the current method of making silicon solar wafers using the industry standard wire saw equipment. The report summarizes the activity conducted by Silicon Genesis Corporation in working to develop this technologymoreÂ Â» further and to define the roadmap specifications for the first commercial proto-type equipment for high volume solar wafer manufacturing using the PolyMax technology.Â«Â less\n\nSyndemics among individuals enrolled in the PrEP Brasil Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Boni, Raquel B; Machado, Iona K; De Vasconcellos, Mauricio T L; Hoagland, Brenda; Kallas, Esper G; Madruga, JosÃ© Valdez; Fernandes, Nilo M; Cerqueira, Natalia B; Moreira, Ronaldo I; Goulart, Silvia P; Veloso, Valdilea G; Grinsztejn, Beatriz; Luz, Paula M\n\n2018-04-01\n\nConcurrent psychosocial problems may synergistically increase the risk of HIV infection (syndemics), representing a challenge for prevention. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and associated factors of syndemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) enrolled in the Brazilian pre-exposure prophylaxis demonstration study (PrEP Brasil Study). Secondary cross-sectional analysis of the PrEP Brasil Study was performed. Of 450 HIV-seronegative MSM/TGW enrolled in the PrEP Brasil Study- conducted at Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil- 421 participants with complete data were included in the present analysis. Syndemics was defined as occurrence of â¥2 of the following conditions: polysubstance (â¥2) use, binge drinking, positive depression screen, compulsive sexual behavior, and intimate partner violence (IPV). The prevalence of recent polysubstance use was 22.8%, binge drinking 51.1%, positive depression screening 5.2%, compulsive sexual behavior 7.1%, and IPV 7.3%. Syndemics prevalence was 24.2%, and associated factors were younger age (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 0.95, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) 0.92-0.98 per year increase), TGW vs. MSM (aOR 3.09, 95% CI: 1.2-8.0), some college education or more vs. less than college (aOR 2.49, 95% CI: 1.31-4.75), and multiple male sexual partners in prior 3 months (aOR 1.69, 95% CI: 0.92-3.14). Given the high prevalence of syndemics, particularly of polysubstance use and binge drinking, PrEP delivery offers an opportunity to diagnose and intervene in mental and social well-being.

The sample consisted of 330 nursing professionals, of whom 86 participated in the retest phase. of the 330 participants, 39.7% were aides, 33% technicians, 20.9% nurses, and 6.4% nurses with administrative roles. Confirmatory factorial analysis demonstrated that the Brazilian Portuguese version of the instrument is adequately adjusted to the dimensional structure the scale authors originally proposed. The correlation between \"satisfaction with position/role\" and \"satisfaction with teamwork\" and the survey's missed care variables was moderate (Spearman's coefficient =0.35; p<0.001). The results of the Student's t-test indicated known-group validity. Professionals from closed units reported lower levels of missed care in comparison with the other units. The reliability showed a strong correlation, with the exception of \"institutional management/leadership style\" (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.15; p=0.04). The internal consistency was adequate (Cronbach's alpha was greater than 0.70). the MISSCARE-BRASIL was valid and reliable in the group studied. The application of the MISSCARE-BRASIL can contribute to identifying solutions for missed nursing care.\n\nUh and um revisited: are they interjections for signaling delay?\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Connell, Daniel C; Kowal, Sabine\n\n2005-11-01\n\nClark and Fox Tree (2002) have presented empirical evidence, based primarily on the London-Lund corpus (LL; Svartvik & Quirk, 1980), that the fillers uh and um are conventional English words that signal a speaker's intention to initiate a minor and a major delay, respectively. We present here empirical analyses of uh and um and of silent pauses (delays) immediately following them in six media interviews of Hillary Clinton. Our evidence indicates that uh and um cannot serve as signals of upcoming delay, let alone signal it differentially: In most cases, both uh and um were not followed by a silent pause, that is, there was no delay at all; the silent pauses that did occur after um were too short to be counted as major delays; finally, the distributions of durations of silent pauses after uh and um were almost entirely overlapping and could therefore not have served as reliable predictors for a listener. The discrepancies between Clark and Fox Tree's findings and ours are largely a consequence of the fact that their LL analyses reflect the perceptions of professional coders, whereas our data were analyzed by means of acoustic measurements with the PRAAT software (www.praat.org). A comparison of our findings with those of O'Connell, Kowal, and Ageneau (2005) did not corroborate the hypothesis of Clark and Fox Tree that uh and um are interjections: Fillers occurred typically in initial, interjections in medial positions; fillers did not constitute an integral turn by themselves, whereas interjections did; fillers never initiated cited speech, whereas interjections did; and fillers did not signal emotion, whereas interjections did. Clark and Fox Tree's analyses were embedded within a theory of ideal delivery that we find inappropriate for the explication of these phenomena.\n\nSpitzer/IRS spectroscopy of the 12um Seyferts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, Yanling; Charmandaris, V.; Huang, J.; Houck, J.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe extended 12um galaxy sample is a flux-limited sample of 893 galaxies selected from the IRAS Faint Source Catalog 2. A total of 118 objects from this sample have been classified optically as Seyfert galaxies, providing one of the largest infrared selected unbiased sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We present our prelimary results from our analysis of mid-infrared Spitzer/IRS spectra of 102 12um Seyferts (that is 86 % of the 12um Seyfert sample) which have been observed by various Spitzer programs and are available in the Spitzer archive. A number of mid-infared diagnostics have been developed to study the nature of nuclear dust enshrouded emission from AGNs, in order to disentangle the starburst-AGN connection. Since PAH emission is a tracer of star formation activity we have measured the 11.3um PAH feature for our Seyfert sample. We find that as the strength of the radiation field in AGNs increases the PAH molecules are destroyed, while the PAH EWs increase with the IRAS f60/f25 ratios of the host galaxies. We further probe this warm/cold color diagnostic, by contrasting our findings with those of we starbust galaxies, ULIRGs, as well as blue compact dwarf galaxies.\n\nNursing care by telehealth: what is the influence of distance on communication?\n\nPubMed\n\nBarbosa, Ingrid de Almeida; Silva, Maria JÃºlia Paes da\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEvaluate the perception of nurses regarding interpersonal communication while providing care via telehealth. Qualitative research realized with seven nurses working in telehealth in Brazil, the sample was determined by data saturation. A questionnaire with open questions was applied and then content analysis of the dialogues was conducted, focusing on thematic analysis. Four categories emerged from the dialogues: Understanding the importance of communication; the interpersonal relationship interfering with communication; Communicating via technology; and Learning the communication process. The perception of nurses working in telehealth in Brazil is that technology has facilitated their professional practice; however, in relation to the communication process, they believe it is harder to communicate by telehealth, mainly due to difficulty in perceiving nonverbal signals. To overcome these difficulties, they agreed that interpersonal communication is a skill that must be acquired during their professional training.

Buscamos cuantificar la manera en que los efectos socioeconÃ³micos, demogrÃ¡ficos, geogrÃ¡ficos y de atenciÃ³n de salud explican las disparidades raciales en las tasas de bajo peso al nacer y prematuridad en Brasil. MÃ©todos. Utilizamos una muestra de 8â949 niÃ±os nacidos entre 1995 y el 2009 en 15 ciudades y 7 provincias de Brasil. Nos centramos en las disparidades en la prevalencia de bajo peso al nacer (< 2â500 g) y prematuridad (< 37 semanas de gestaciÃ³n) en reciÃ©n nacidos de ascendencia solo africana o mezclada con otras ascendencias y de ascendencia solo europea. Usamos un modelo de descomposiciÃ³n para cuantificar la contribuciÃ³n de los factores conceptualmente pertinentes a esas disparidades. Resultados. El modelo permitiÃ³ explicar entre 45% y 94% de las disparidades en cuanto al bajo peso al nacer y entre 64% y 94% de las disparidades en cuanto a la prematuridad entre los grupos de ascendencia africana y de ascendencia europea. Las diferencias en el uso de atenciÃ³n prenatal y en la ubicaciÃ³n geogrÃ¡fica fueron los factores mÃ¡s importantes, seguidos por las diferencias socioeconÃ³micas. El modelo permitiÃ³ explicar la mayorÃ­a de las disparidades en los reciÃ©n nacidos de ascendencia africana mezclada y parte de las disparidades en los de ascendencia solo africana. Conclusiones. En las polÃ­ticas pÃºblicas para mejorar la salud infantil se deben abordar las diferencias en cuanto a la atenciÃ³n prenatal y la ubicaciÃ³n geogrÃ¡fica a fin de reducir las disparidades en materia de salud entre los reciÃ©n nacidos de ascendencia africana y los de ascendencia europea en Brasil.\n\nUnit 5, STA. 50+00+RB, Orner Building, First U.M.

The UM-PRS provides a reasoning system that represents robotic applications even in unpredictable domains, such as the robotic reconnaissance task domain outlined here. UM-PRS incorporates a changing context, rather than relying solely on a prearranged plan. The UM-PRS here provides representation important in the reasoning and interface between a mission plan and the executable map of an outdoor vehicle that changes its behavior based on what it comes in contact with in its environment. PRS is thus used in the dynamic control of such a vehicle, providing the basis for coordinating the joint task of multiple robotic vehicles by the their individual observations and representation.\n\nVizieR Online Data Catalog: Draco nebula Herschel 250um map (Miville-Deschenes+, 2017)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiville-Deschenes, M.-A.; Salome, Q.; Martin, P.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an ultramicronized preparation of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA-um(Â®)), an endogenous fatty acid amide, in mice subjected to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was induced in male mice by a single intratracheal administration of saline with bleomycin sulphate (1mg/kg body weight) in a volume of 100Î¼L. PEA-um(Â®) was injected intraperitoneally at 1, 3 or 10mg/kg 1h after bleomycin instillation and daily thereafter. Animals were sacrificed after 7 and 21days by pentobarbitone overdose. One cohort of mice was sacrificed after seven days of bleomycin administration, followed by bronchoalveloar lavage and determination of myeloperoxidase activity, lung edema and histopathology features. In the 21-day cohort, mortality was assessed daily, and surviving mice were sacrificed followed by the above analyses together with immunohistochemical localization of CD8, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, CD4, interleukin-1Î², transforming growth factor-Î², inducible nitric oxide synthase and basic fibroblast growth factor. Compared to bleomycin-treated mice, animals that received also PEA-um(Â®) (3 or 10mg/kg) had significantly decreased weight loss, mortality, inflammation, lung damage at the histological level, and lung fibrosis at 7 and 21days. PEA-um(Â®) (1mg/kg) did not significantly inhibit the inflammation response and lung fibrosis. This study demonstrates that PEA-um(Â®) (3 and 10mg/kg) reduces the extent of lung inflammation in a mouse model of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our aim was to investigate whether psychopathological symptoms were associated with CAC in a cross-sectional analysis of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) baseline. We analyzed data from 4,279 ELSA-Brasil subjects (aged 35 to 74Â years) from the SÃ£o Paulo site without previous cardiovascular disease who underwent CAC score assessment at baseline. Prevalent CAC was defined as a CAC score >0. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R). We built binary logistic regression models to determine whether CIS-R scores, anxiety, or depression were associated with prevalent CAC. Prevalent CAC was found in 1,211 subjects (28.3%). After adjustment for age and gender, a direct association between CIS-R scores and prevalent CAC was revealed (odds ratio for 1-SD increase: 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.22). This association persisted after multivariate adjustment (odds ratio for 1-SD increase 1.11; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20). No independent associations were found for specific diagnoses of anxiety or depression and prevalent CAC. In post hoc models, a significant interaction term (pÂ = 0.019) suggested a stronger association in older subjects. In conclusion, psychopathological symptoms were directly associated with coronary atherosclerosis in the ELSA-Brasil baseline in adjusted models, and this association seems to be stronger in older subjects.

A test-retest design including 19 adults (38 knee images) was conducted. Feasibility of the radiographic protocol was assessed by image quality parameters and presence of radioanatomic alignment according to intermargin distance (IMD) values. Repeatability was assessed for IMD and joint space width (JSW) measured at three different locations. Approximately 90% of knee images presented excellent quality. Frequencies of nearly perfect radioanatomic alignment (IMD â¤1mm) ranged from 29% to 50%, and satisfactory alignment was found in up to 71% and 76% of the images (IMD â¤1.5mm and â¤1.7mm, respectively). Repeatability analyses yielded the following results: IMD [SD of mean difference=1.08; coefficient of variation (%CV)=54.68%; intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (95%CI)=0.59 (0.34-0.77)]; JSW [SD of mean difference=0.34-0.61; %CV=4.48%-9.80%; ICC (95%CI)=0.74 (0.55-0.85)-0.94 (0.87-0.97)]. Adequately reproducible measurements of IMD and JSW were found in 68% and 87% of the images, respectively. Despite the difficulty in achieving consistent radioanatomic alignment between subsequent radiographs in terms of IMD, the protocol produced highly repeatable JSW measurements when these were taken at midpoint and 10mm from the medial extremity of the medial tibial plateau. Therefore, measurements of JSW at these locations can be considered adequate for the assessment of knee OA in ELSA-Brasil MSK. Copyright Â© 2016.

Restore blood flow is the first intervention help against heart attack. However, reperfusion of the arteries leads to ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R). The fatty acid amide palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous compound widely present in living organisms, with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. The present study evaluated the effect of ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide (PEA-um) treatment on the inflammatory process associated with myocardial I/R. Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury was induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30âmin followed by 2âh of reperfusion. PEA-um, was administered (10âmg/kg) 15âmin after ischemia and 1âh after reperfusion. In this study, we demonstrated that PEA-um treatment reduces myocardial tissue injury, neutrophil infiltration, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, P-selectin) expression, proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î²) production, nitrotyrosine and PAR formation, nuclear factor kB expression, and apoptosis (Fas-L, Bcl-2) activation. In addition to study whether the protective effect of PEA-um on myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury is also related to the activation of PPAR-Î±, in a separate set of experiments it has been performed myocardial I/R in PPARÎ± mice. Genetic ablation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-Î± in PPAR-Î±KO mice exacerbated Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury when compared with PPAR-Î±WT mice. PEA-um induced cardioprotection in PPAR-Î± wild-type mice, but the same effect cannot be observed in PPAR-Î±KO mice. Our results have clearly shown a modulation of the inflammatory process, associated with myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, following administration of PEA-um.\n\nGender and psychosocial factors associated with healthy lifestyle in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) cohort: a cross-sectional study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPatrÃ£o, Ana LuÃ­sa; Almeida, Maria da ConceiÃ§Ã£o; Matos, Sheila Maria Alvim; Chor, Dora; Aquino, Estela M. L.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjectives It has been estimated that over 50% of the premature deaths occurring in Western countries can be attributed to causes rooted in lifestyle. In turn, leading a healthy lifestyle has also been associated with a wide range of psychosocial factors. Today, it is known that these differ among men and women. The present article aimed to identify, from a gender-based perspective, the psychosocial factors associated with healthy lifestyles in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) cohort, the largest study concerning adult health conducted in Latin America to date. Design This cross-sectional study was conducted using ELSA-Brasil baseline data, collected between 2008 and 2010. Setting Six Brazilian public higher education and research institutions. Participants The ELSA-Brasil cohort consists of approximately 15â000 employees (8218 women and 6887 men), both currently working and retired. Main outcome measures The lifestyle indicator was constructed by summing the scores attributed to four different behaviours. Results The women of the ELSA-Brasil cohort have healthier lifestyles than men. In women, strong associations were found between a healthy lifestyle and age 60 years or older, Asian race and university level of education or higher. In men, being 60 years or older, of Asian or Caucasian race, having a high-school equivalent level of education or higher, being retired, having a housekeeper, having a good or very good self-perception of health and being satisfied with body image were the psychosocial factors associated with leading a healthy lifestyle. Conclusions The factors that influenced healthy lifestyles were found to differ among men and women, a fact that must be addressed when developing programmes designed to promote health.

The ELSA-Brasil cohort consists of approximately 15â000 employees (8218 women and 6887 men), both currently working and retired. The lifestyle indicator was constructed by summing the scores attributed to four different behaviours. The women of the ELSA-Brasil cohort have healthier lifestyles than men. In women, strong associations were found between a healthy lifestyle and age 60 years or older, Asian race and university level of education or higher. In men, being 60 years or older, of Asian or Caucasian race, having a high-school equivalent level of education or higher, being retired, having a housekeeper, having a good or very good self-perception of health and being satisfied with body image were the psychosocial factors associated with leading a healthy lifestyle. The factors that influenced healthy lifestyles were found to differ among men and women, a fact that must be addressed when developing programmes designed to promote health.

We aimed to investigate the association of subclinical atherosclerosis and migraine with or without aura compared to a non-migraine subgroup (reference) in a large Brazilian multicentric cohort study, the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Migraine diagnostic was based on International Headache Society criteria, and aura symptoms were validated by a medical doctor in a sub-sample of the ELSA-Brasil, who also underwent coronary artery calcium score (CAC) and carotid intima-media thickness (C-IMT) evaluations. Subclinical atherosclerosis indexes (CAC and C-IMT) were analyzed as dependent variables and migraine (all, with aura, without aura) as an independent variable in the linear and multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for possible confounders. Of 3217 ELSA participants free from CVD at baseline, we found a migraine frequency of 11.9% (5.1% with aura and 6.8% without aura). Overall, migraineurs were mostly women, younger and had lower frequency of CV risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and low HDL-cholesterol, compared to non-migraineurs. The strongest inverse correlation between migraine and subclinical atherosclerosis was verified with CAC score. However, all associations lost their significance after multivariate adjustment. In this cross-sectional evaluation of the ELSA study, migraine was not associated with subclinical atherosclerosis, regardless of aura symptoms.

This development has not been accompanied by an improvement in the legal-institutional framework, thus hindering the development of research projects, including equipment importation activities. The present study aimed to analyze the equipment importation process for the Brazilian Longitudinal Study for Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). A case study was performed with data collected from internal ELSA-Brasil documents in five Investigation Centers and their respective supporting foundations. The following importation documents were analyzed: pulse wave velocity, bioimaging and retinography. Additionally, non-structured interviews with researchers and key informers were conducted in the foundations. Data were treated and organized into three stages: administrative-operational, exchange rate, and fiscal. Lengths of duration of these stages were calculated comparatively among centers. The need to standardize equipment in a multicenter study required a joint action of implementing institutions and foundations. Of all pieces of equipment analyzed, the first stage was administrative-operational, with a varying duration (minimum of eight, maximum of 101, and mean of 55 days) which was longer when legal opinions were included. The second stage was the exchange rate, which was longer than the former and did not pose any obstacles to the process (minimum of 11, maximum of 381, and mean of 196 days). The third stage was fiscal, which was the longest one (minimum of 43, maximum of 388, and mean of 215.5 days), due to the release of equipment without registration into the country. There were other factors that posed obstacles: inexperience of investigation centers and institutions in networking; inadequacy of the national legislation on scientific research particularities; and the lack of specialized professionals in scientific project management.

Yet, current data on this association are inconsistent. Our objective is to investigate the relation of microvascular endothelial function to cognitive performance in the ELSA-Brasil cohort study. A total of 1521 participants from ELSA-Brasil free of dementia underwent peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) to quantify microvascular endothelial function (PAT-ratio and mean baseline pulse amplitude (BPA)) and cognitive tests that covered the domains of memory, verbal fluency, and executive function at baseline. Cognitive tests in participants aged 55 years old and above were repeated during the second examination (mean follow-up: 3.5 (0.3) years). Linear regression and generalized linear models were used to evaluate the association between endothelial function, global cognitive performance, and performance on specific cognitive domains. In unadjusted cross-sectional analyses, we found that BPA and PAT-ratio were associated with worse global cognitive performance (mean difference for BPA: -0.07, 95% CI: -0.11; -0.03, p<0.01; mean difference for PAT-ratio: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01; 0.20, p=0.02), worse performance on learning, recall, and word recognition tests (BPA: -0.87, 95% CI: -1.21; -0.52, p<0.01; PAT-ratio: 1.58, 95% CI: 0.80; 2.36, p<0.01), and only BPA was associated with worse performance in verbal fluency tests (-0.70, 95% CI: -1.19; -0.21, p<0.01). Adjustments for age, sex, and level of education rendered the associations statistically non-significant. Longitudinally, there was no association between microvascular endothelial and cognitive functions. The associations between microvascular endothelial function and cognition are explained by age, sex, and educational level. Measures of microvascular endothelial function may be of limited value with regard to preclinical cognitive deficits.\n\nVariability of the broad absorption lines in the QSO UM 232\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarlow, Thomas A.; Junkkarinen, Vesa T.; Burbidge, E. Margaret\n\n1989-01-01\n\nLow-resolution spectra of UM 232 taken in 1978, 1979, and 1988 at Lick Observatory are presented. Large changes in the Si IV lambda 1397, CIV lambda 1549, and Al III lambda 1857 broad absorption lines are apparent. The decrease in column density in all three ions and an observed brightening of the QSO suggests that these changes are due to an increase in the ionization level driven by an increase in the central source luminosity. This mechanism has been proposed by Smith and Penston to explain small changes in the absorption spectrum of the QSO 1246-057. The spectra of UM 232 show that the fractional decrease in optical depth is smaller at higher outflow velocies. The structure of the broad absorption-line region (BALR) is investigted by estimating an ionization parameter for each ion species as a function of velocity.\n\nElectrocardiographic Findings in Brazilian Adults without Heart Disease: ELSA-Brasil.\n\nPubMed\n\nPinto, Marcelo Martins; Brant, Luisa C C; Padilha-da-Silva, JosÃ© Luiz; Foppa, Murilo; Lotufo, Paulo A; Mill, JosÃ© Geraldo; Vasconcelo-Silva, Paulo R; Almeida, Maria da ConceiÃ§Ã£o C; Barreto, Sandhi Maria; Ribeiro, AntÃ´nio Luiz Pinho\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used in population-based studies.

Expression and function of the UM4D4/CDw60 antigen.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFox, D A; Millard, J A; Kan, L; Zeldes, W S; Davis, W; Higgs, J; Emmrich, F; Kinne, R W\n\n1990-01-01\n\nAccumulating evidence implicates a central role for synovial T cells in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, but the activation pathways that drive proliferation and effector function of these cells are not known. We have recently generated a novel monoclonal antibody against a rheumatoid synovial T cell line that recognizes an antigen termed UM4D4 (CDw60). This antigen is expressed on a minority of peripheral blood T cells, and represents the surface component of a distinct pathway of human T cell activation. The current studies were performed to examine the expression and function of UM4D4 on T cells obtained from synovial fluid and synovial membranes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of inflammatory joint disease. The UM4D4 antigen is expressed at high surface density on about three-fourths of synovial fluid T cells and on a small subset of synovial fluid natural killer cells; in synovial tissue it is present on more than 90% of T cells in lymphoid aggregates, and on approximately 50% of T cells in stromal infiltrates In addition, UM4D4 is expressed in synovial tissue on a previously undescribed population of HLA-DR/DP-negative non-T cells with a dendritic morphology. Anti-UM4D4 was co-mitogenic for both RA and non-RA synovial fluid mononuclear cells, and induced IL-2 receptor expression. The UM4D4/CDw60 antigen may represent a functional activation pathway for synovial compartment T cells, which could play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis.

Com a descoberta de flutuaÃ§Ãµes de temperatura na RCFM, da ordem de uma parte em 105, pelo COBE (1992), uma nova era teve inÃ­cio. Nos Ãºltimos onze anos, diversos instrumentos fizeram novas medidas de alta precisÃ£o, refinando os resultados apresentados pelo COBE, culminando com os resultados recentes do satÃ©lite WMAP. A anÃ¡lise de dados da RCFM, especialmente no caso de experimentos com pequena cobertura do cÃ©u, apresenta uma sÃ©rie de dificuldades devido a emissÃµes de contaminantes externos, tais como a emissÃ£o da GalÃ¡xia e de fontes pontuais, e de ruÃ­dos intrÃ­nsecos tanto ao sistema de detecÃ§Ã£o quanto Ã estratÃ©gia de observaÃ§Ã£o do cÃ©u.

No caso de experimentos que utilizam detectores HEMT, essa combinaÃ§Ã£o de filtros remove, satisfatoriamente, ruÃ­dos do tipo 1/f gerados pela instabilidade no ganho do detector acoplado ao movimento do instrumento, definido pela estratÃ©gia de observaÃ§Ã£o.

H.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAtypical pragmatic language is often present in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), along with delays or deficits in structural language. This study investigated the use of the âfillersâ uh and um by children ages 4â8 during the autism diagnostic observation schedule. Fillers reflect speakersâ difficulties with planning and delivering speech, but they also serve communicative purposes, such as negotiating control of the floor or conveying uncertainty. We hypothesized that children with ASD would use different patterns of fillers compared to peers with typical development or with specific language impairment (SLI), reflecting differences in social ability and communicative intent. Regression analyses revealed that children in the ASD group were much less likely to use um than children in the other two groups. Filler use is an easy-to-quantify feature of behavior that, in concert with other observations, may help to distinguish ASD from SLI.

G.; Barlow, M. J.; Walsh, J. R.; Westmoquette, M. S.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nUsing Very Large Telescope/Fibre Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph optical integral field unit observations, we present a detailed study of UM 448, a nearby blue compact galaxy (BCG) previously reported to have an anomalously high N/O abundance ratio. New Technology Telescope/Superb-Seeing Imager images reveal a morphology suggestive of a merger of two systems of contrasting colour, whilst our HÎ± emission maps resolve UM 448 into three separate regions that do not coincide with the stellar continuum peaks. UM 448 exhibits complex emission line profiles, with most lines consisting of a narrow [full width at half-maximum (FWHM) â² 100 km s-1], central component, an underlying broad component (FWHM Ë 150-300 km s-1) and a third, narrow blueshifted component. Radial velocity maps of all three components show signs of solid body rotation across UM 448, with a projected rotation axis that correlates with the continuum morphology of the galaxy. A spatially resolved, chemodynamical analysis, based on the [O iii] Î»Î»4363, 4959, [N ii] Î»6584, [S ii] Î»Î»6716, 6731 and [Ne iii] Î»3868 line maps, is presented. Whilst the eastern tail of UM 448 has electron temperatures (Te) that are typical of BCGs, we find a region within the main body of the galaxy where the narrow and broad [O iii] Î»4363 line components trace temperatures differing by 5000 K and oxygen abundances differing by 0.4 dex. We measure spatially resolved and integrated ionic and elemental abundances for O, N, S and Ne throughout UM 448, and find that they do not agree, possibly due the flux weighting of Te from the integrated spectrum. This has significant implications for abundances derived from long-slit and integrated spectra of star-forming galaxies in the nearby and distant universe. A region of enhanced N/O ratio is indeed found, extended over a Ë0.6 kpc2 region within the main body of the galaxy.

Objective To assess the validity of the potassium and sodium intake estimated using the Food Frequency Questionnaire ELSA-Brasil. Subjects/Methods A subsample of participants in the ELSA-Brasil cohort was included in this study in 2009. Sodium and potassium intake were estimated using three methods: Semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, 12-hour nocturnal urinary excretion and three 24-hour food records. Correlation coefficients were calculated between the methods, and the validity coefficient was calculated using the method of triads. The 95% confidence intervals for the validity coefficient were estimated using bootstrap sampling.

We analyzed data from the cross-sectional baseline assessment of the ELSA-Brasil, a cohort study of 15,105 civil servants from six Brazilian cities. The Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) was used to investigate the presence of CMD, with a score â¥ 12 indicating a current CMD (last week). Specific diagnostic algorithms for each disorder were based on the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. Prevalence ratios (PR) of the association between CMD and sociodemographic characteristics were estimated by Poisson regression. CMD (CIS-R score â¥ 12) was found in 26.8% (95% confidence intervals [95%CI] 26.1-27.5). The highest burden occurred among women (PR 1.9; 95%CI 1.8-2.0), the youngest (PR 1.7; 95%CI 1.5-1.9), non-white individuals, and those without a university degree. The most frequent diagnostic category was anxiety disorders (16.2%), followed by depressive episodes (4.2%). The burden of CMD was high, particularly among the more socially vulnerable groups.

In turn, arterial hypertension is the main attributable risk factor premature life lost years and disability. Objective To investigate the relationship between alcohol consumption and high blood pressure in participants of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Methodology A baseline data of total of 7,655 participants volunteers between 35 and 74 years of age, of both genders, in six educational and research institutions of three different regions of the country were interviewed between 2008â2010. Socioeconomic, haemodynamic, anthropometric and health data were collected in the research centers of ELSA-Brasil. The presence of high blood pressure was identified when the systolic blood pressure was â¥140 mm Hg and/or the diastolic was â¥90 mm Hg. Alcohol consumption was estimated and categorized regarding consumption and pattern of ingestion. The Studentâs t-test, chi-squared and logistic regression tests were used for analysis, including potential co-variables of the model, and a 5% significance level was adopted. Results A dose-response relation was observed for the consumption of alcohol (g/week) in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. Alcohol consumption was associated with high blood pressure in men who reported moderate (OR = 1.69; 95%CI 1.35â2.11) and excessive (OR = 2.70; 95%CI 2.04â3.59) consumption. Women have nearly three times more chance of presenting elevated blood pressure when presenting excessive consumption (OR = 2.86, 95%CI 1.77â4.63), and binge drinkers who drink more than 2 to 3 times a month have approximately 70% more chance of presenting with elevated blood pressure, after adjusting for consumption of drinks with meals. Conclusion The consumption of alcohol beverages increases the odds of elevated blood pressure, especially among excessive drinkers. Therefore alcohol consumption needs\n\nConsumption of alcohol and blood pressure: Results of the ELSA-Brasil study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantana, NathÃ¡lia Miguel Teixeira; Mill, JosÃ© Geraldo; Velasquez-Melendez, Gustavo; Moreira, Alexandra Dias; Barreto, Sandhi Maria; Viana, Maria Carmen; Molina, Maria Del Carmen Bisi\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPrevention and reduction of excessive use of alcohol represents damages to society in general.

Based on David Ausubel's Meaningful Learning Theory, we have sought to develop a proposal following a didactic model which simulates the phases of the Moon, as based on the previous conceptions of the students. The signs of learning were evidenced by means of memory registries of the activity. From the obtained results we believe that the proposal achieved its goals, since the students were able to identify, differentiate and transfer the phenomenon of the moon phases to new contexts. Thus, it is concluded that a methodology focused on a meaningful content for the students is fundamental to the construction and genuine grasping of what is being learned. Neste artigo, relata-se uma experiÃªncia didÃ¡tica de estudo das fases da Lua com uma turma do 6Â° ano do Ensino Fundamental, de uma escola privada do municÃ­pio de Passo Fundo, RS. Tendo como fundamentaÃ§Ã£o teÃ³rica a Teoria da Aprendizagem Significativa de David Ausubel, buscou-se desenvolver a proposta a partir de um modelo didÃ¡tico que simula as fases da Lua e com base nas concepÃ§Ãµes prÃ©vias dos estudantes. Os indÃ­cios da aprendizagem foram constatados atravÃ©s de registros de memÃ³rias da atividade. Pelos resultados apresentados, acredita-se que a proposta alcanÃ§ou seus objetivos, uma vez que os estudantes conseguiram identificar, diferenciar e transferir o fenÃ´meno das fases da Lua para novos contextos. Assim, conclui-se que uma metodologia com enfoque em um conteÃºdo significativo ao estudante Ã© fundamental para a construÃ§Ã£o e compreensÃ£o genuÃ­na do que estÃ¡ sendo aprendido.
