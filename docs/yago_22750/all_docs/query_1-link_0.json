        "text": "Ferdinand I (born Oct. 31, 1345, Lisbon, Port.—died Oct. 22, 1383) was the ninth king of Portugal (1367–83), whose reign was marked by three wars with Castile and by the growth of the Portuguese economy.\n\nThe son of Peter I of Portugal, Ferdinand became a contender for the Castilian throne after the assassination (1369) of Peter the Cruel of Castile, thus initiating the first (1369–71) of the unsuccessful wars with Castile. After Ferdinand allied himself in 1372 with John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, there ensued a second war with Castile (1372–73), in which Castilian troops invaded Portugal, surrounded Lisbon (1373), and obliged Ferdinand to repudiate the English alliance and to accept the conditions of Henry II of Castile.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nThe period of peace that followed was taken up with successive, and sometimes contradictory, diplomatic negotiations—with England, Castile, Aragon, and France—but the Anglo-Portuguese treaty of June 16, 1373, continued to form a basis of alliance between the two countries. The confirmation of the English treaties in 1380 gave rise to a third war with Castile (1381–82), which, like the earlier conflicts, was characterized by the lack of success of Portugal’s military operations, in spite of forces sent from England under Edmund of Langley. Compelled once more to sign a peace treaty (August 1382) and to abandon his allies, Ferdinand obtained from the king of Castile the ships for repatriation of the English troops."
