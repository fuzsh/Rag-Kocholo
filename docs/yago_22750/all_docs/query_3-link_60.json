I give Afonso Vasques de Sousa as Vasco Martins' son, due to patronymic and chronology. Also the Sousa Chichorro line is descended from him through his son (not brother) Martim Afonso de Sousa III, attested at Ceuta in 1415. Later I learned that Luiz de Bivar Guerra had made the same corrections in the 60s.\n\nBest,\n\nChico Doria\n\nFrancisco Antonio Doria\n\nPrix Caumont-La Force 1995\n\n(Conféderation Internationale de Généalogie et d'Héraldique.)\n\nfad...@rio.com.br\n\nAll material posted is copyrighted.
