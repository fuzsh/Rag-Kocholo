Infanta de Castilla, reina consorte de Navarra, desde 1403, e hija de Enrique II el de las Mercedes y de la infanta Juana Manuel.\n\nA la muerte su padre heredó un importante señorío entre Roa y Sepúlveda, lo que le proporcionó un importante poderío. Fracasó un plan para casarse con Fernando I de Portugal en 1371, y en 1373 fue prometida al futuro Carlos III de Navarra, el Noble. Se casaron el 27 de mayo de 1375. En febrero de 1388 se separaron, tornando a la corte castellana. Tras varias negociaciones para que volviera en las que Leonor refería que en Navarra sufría malos tratos, Carlos III consiguió la entrega de su hija mayor Juana, para ser educada y jurada como heredera.\n\nDe esta unión nacieron:\n\nJuana (1383 - julio 1413), casada con Juan III, conde de Foix.\n\nBlanca (1385 - Santa Maria de Nieva, 3 de abril de 1441), sucesora de su padre como reina de Navarra.\n\nMaría (1388 - antes del 8 de septiembre de 1425).\n\nMargarita (1390 - 1403/25),\n\nBeatriz (1392 - 1415), casada con Jaime II, conde de la Marche.\n\nIsabel (1395 - después del 31 de agosto de 1435), casada con Juan IV, conde de Armagnac.\n\nCarlos (Pamplona, 15 de agosto de 1397 - 12 de agosto de 1402), Príncipe de Viana.\n\nLuis (Olite, 1402 - 14 de octubre de 1402), Príncipe de Viana.\n\nLeonor participó de forma activa en las intrigas en Castilla cuando su sobrino Enrique III el Doliente era menor de edad. Cuando llegó a la mayoría de edad, y dado que los enfrentamientos eran más intensos, fue devuelta a Navarra en marzo de 1395. A partir de entonces la relación de los esposos fue buena, siendo coronada en Pamplona en 1403, participando en el gobierno en ausencia de su esposo y colaborando en el entendimiento entre el reino de Navarra y la Corona de Castilla.\n\nPredecesor:\n\nJuana de Valois Reina Consorte de Navarra\n\n1387-1415 Sucesor:\n\nJuan II de Aragón\n\nin: Wikipedia, La enciclopedia libre (http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonor_de_Trast%C3%A1mara : accessed 07 Mar 2013)\n\nEleanor of Castile, Queen of Navarre\n\nEleanor of Castile (after 1363 – 27 February 1416) was an infanta of Castile and the Queen consort of Navarre.\n\nShe was the daughter of King Henry II of Castile and his wife, Juana Manuel of Castile, from a cadet branch of the Castilian royal house. Eleanor was a member of the House of Trastámara.\n\nLife\n\nEleanor was subject to marriage plans with Ferdinand I of Portugal in 1371 however, the King refused the match as he had secretly married noblewoman Leonor Telles de Menezes. [1]\n\nA betrothal took place in 1373 in Burgos with Prince Charles, heir to his father Charles II of Navarre. The couple were married at Soria in May 1375. [2] A testament dated at Burgos on 29 May 1374, shows that King Henry II bequeathed property to his daughter Eleanor as a part of her marriage plans. [3]\n\nBetween the royal couple, however, was considerable marital disputes. In 1388 Eleanor asked at a meeting between her husband and her brother, John I of Castile, for permission to retire for some time to her homeland of Castile, to recover from an illness in the local climate, which she had seized better. She took her young daughters, whom she bore her husband, and resided in Valladolid (by 1390 she bore two more). Two years later, she was demanded by her husband to return, because they needed to be crowned King and Queen of Navarre as her father-in-law King Charles had died. Eleanor's brother King John supported the request of Charles III. Eleanor did not contend, claiming she was ill-treated in Navarre and believed members of the Navarrese nobility wished to poison her; therefore, Eleanor remained in Castile, while her husband was crowned in February 1390 in Pamplona. By 1390, Eleanor had given her husband six daughters, all surviving infancy but no sons, for this reason, Eleanor handed her oldest daughter Joanna over to her husband as she was heiress.\n\n0n 9 October 1390, Eleanor's brother John died and was succeeded by his minor son Henry. Charles then again requested Eleanor's return to Navarre however she refused. However, Eleanor opposed her nephew's accession and she formed the League of Lillo along with her illegitimate half-brother Fadrique and her cousin Pedro. King Henry opposed the League, he besieged Eleanor in her castle at Roa around mid-1394 and obliged her to return to her husband in February 1395. [4]\n\nEleanor then returned to her husband was very involved in the political life of Navarre. Her relationship with her husband improved and she bore him further children, including two sons Charles and Louis however, they died young. On 3 June 1403 her coronation as queen of Navarre took place in Pamplona. Upon several occasions when Charles stayed in France, Eleanor took to the role as regent. She also helped to maintain good relations between Navarre and Castile, and much noble Castilians including the Duke of Benavente and members of powerful families Dávalos, Mendoza and Zuñiga settled in Navarre.\n\nUpon the couple's absences, their daughter Joanna acted as regent as she was heiress however, she died in 1413 without issue and in the lifetime of both her parents therefore the succession turned to their second daughter Blanche was succeeded as Queen of Navarre upon Charles death.\n\nThere is confusion surrounding Eleanor's death. She is believed to have died at Olite on 27 February 1415 or at Pamplona 5 March 1416. [5] Her husband died in 1425 and they were buried together at Pamplona in the Cathedral of Santa María la Real.\n\nIssue\n\nEleanor and Charles had eight children, five of their daughters lived to adulthood:\n\nJoanna (1382–1413), married John I, Count of Foix, no issue\n\nBlanche (1385/91-1441), married John II of Aragon, became Queen of Navarre and had issue\n\nIsabella (1395–1435), married in 1419 to John IV of Armagnac, had issue and they were great great grandparents of Henry IV of France\n\nBeatrice (1392–1412), married to James II, Count of La Marche and had issue\n\nMaria (1388–1425), died unmarried and childless\n\nMargaret (1390–1403), died young\n\nCharles (1397–1402), Prince of Viana, but died young\n\nLouis (1402), Prince of Viana, but died young\n\nin: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Castile,_Queen_of_Navarre : accessed 07 Mar 2013)\n\nJohn fitz Geoffrey, entry in the database Medieval Lands: A prosopography of medieval European noble and royal families by Charles Cawley © Foundation for Medieval Genealogy, 2000-2017."
