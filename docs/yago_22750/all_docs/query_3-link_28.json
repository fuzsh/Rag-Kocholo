        "text": "Dona Leonor (Elionor) Telles (Teles) de Menezes (Meneses) (1350 - April 27, 1386), called by the people at her time \"a Aleivosa\" (\"The Treacherous\"), was queen consort of Portugal during the 14th century. Born in Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, she served as queen consort from 1372 to 1383 and as regent from 1383 to 1384.\n\nMarried at a young age to a courtier named Dom João Lourenço da Cunha, 3rd Senhor de Pombeiro, with whom she had a son, Dom Álvaro da Cunha, she would be seduced by Ferdinand I of Portugal when he was a prince. This would occur while Leonor was visiting her sister Maria Telles, lady-in-waiting to Ferdinand's half-sister Infanta Beatrice of Portugal.\n\nFerdinand managed to annul her first marriage to João Lourenço da Cunha on grounds of consanguinity and on May 5, 1372 secretly married Leonor Telles de Menezes.\n\nUpon the death of Ferdinand (1383), Leonor was nominated regent in the name of her daughter Beatrice (Beatriz). From 1383 onwards, Leonor ruled with her lover, João Fernandes Andeiro, 2nd Conde de Ourém, called \"Conde Andeiro\", which angered the nobility and the lower classes. Beatrice's marriage to the Castilian king John I led to the expulsion of both mother and daughter.\n\nThe loss of independence had been unthinkable for the majority of Portuguese nobles. A rebellion led by the Master of the Order of Aviz, future João I of Portugal, started in that year, leading to the 1383-1385 Crisis."
