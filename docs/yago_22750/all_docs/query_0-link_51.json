The elaboration of the genealogical trees synthesises genealogical transcriptions that are even more tedious, and makes it easier to see which families were a part of Colón-Zarco’s life. Such family relations show also that Columbus did not create a complex cabalistic siglum merely to show that he was son of Prince Fernando and maternal grandson of the discoverer of Madeira."
