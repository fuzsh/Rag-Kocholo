The Grand Duke and the Grand Duchess paid a first state visit to Portugal in September 2010.

After the military honours and the playing of the national anthems, the Luxembourg Head of State reviewed the guard of honour. Afterwards, the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess, accompanied by the ministerial delegation, went to the Church of Saint Mary in the Hieronymites Monastery to lay a wreath in front of the tomb of Luís Vaz de Camões, Portugal's most famous poet. A visit to the church and cloister of the Hieronymites monastery, emblem of the city of Lisbon and monumental testimony to the richness of Portuguese discoveries throughout the world, in the presence of the director, Dalila Rodrigues, and Canon José Manuel Dos Santos Ferreira, parish priest of the Church of Saint Mary of Belém, was also on the programme.\n\nEscorted by the Republican National Guard on horseback, the Luxembourg head of state and his wife were taken to the Belém Palace, the official residence of the President of the Portuguese Republic.

This was Minister Asselborn's first meeting with his new colleagues since they took office in March. After highlighting the historical and close relations that have linked the two countries for decades, Ministers Asselborn and Cravinho and Secretary of State Antunes discussed ways to further strengthen these relations in the future, especially in the economic field.\n\nIn addition to bilateral relations, the agenda of the discussion also included the main current European and international issues, including the war in Ukraine, sanctions against Russia, energy-related issues, the Conference on the Future of Europe and migration. In this context, the very broad convergence of views between Luxembourg and Portugal on many subjects was reconfirmed.\n\nAfterwards, the Grand Ducal couple and Ministers Jean Asselborn, Corinne Cahen, Franz Fayot and Yuriko Backes went to the São Bento Palace, seat of the Portuguese Parliament, where they were received by the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Portuguese Republic, Augusto Santos Silva.

Focusing on major future-oriented topics: digital economy, space, sustainable construction and tourism, these seminars aim to intensify economic relations between the two countries, on the one hand by promoting Luxembourg companies seeking to integrate the Portuguese market, and on the other hand by facilitating new relations with Portuguese companies. This forum was marked by the presence of the Grand Ducal couple and the President of the Republic.

The visit was attended by the curators of the exhibition, Margarida De Magalhães Ramalho and Luisa Pacheco, as well as by the artists who have contributed to the success of this important project, which reveals the deep bilateral relations that have marked the history of the two countries.\n\nThey then went to the Casa Santa Maria, the home of the Grand Ducal family at the time. It was in June 1940, after the German invasion, that Grand Duchess Charlotte stayed in Cascais for several weeks with Prince Felix and their six children as well as members of the government before going into exile in London. The Grand Ducal couple, in the presence of Minister Corinne Cahen, will lay a wreath of flowers next to the bust of H.R.H.
