Deforested land is used predominantly to produce meat for distal consumption either through cattle ranching or soya bean for livestock feed. Deforestation declined dramatically in the latter part of the decade through a combination of market forces, policies, enforcement and improved monitoring. This study assesses how representative the national-level drivers underlying Mato Grosso's export-oriented deforestation are in other tropical forest countries based on agricultural exports, commercial agriculture and urbanization. We also assess how pervasive the governance and technical monitoring capacity that enabled Mato Grosso's decline in deforestation is in other countries. We find that between 41 and 54 per cent of 2000-2005 deforestation in tropical forest countries (other than Brazil) occurred in countries with drivers similar to Brazil. Very few countries had national-level governance and capacity similar to Brazil. Results suggest that the ecological, hydrological and social consequences of land-use change for export-oriented agriculture as discussed in this Theme Issue were applicable in about one-third of all tropical forest countries in 2000-2005. However, the feasibility of replicating Mato Grosso's success with controlling deforestation is more limited. Production landscapes to support distal consumption similar to Mato Grosso are likely to become more prevalent and are unlikely to follow a land-use transition model with increasing forest cover.\n\nExport-oriented deforestation in Mato Grosso: harbinger or exception for other tropical forests?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDeFries, Ruth; Herold, Martin; Verchot, Louis; Macedo, Marcia N.; Shimabukuro, Yosio\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Brazilian state of Mato Grosso was a global deforestation hotspot in the early 2000s.

R.\n\n2012-07-01\n\nEvaluation of the MODIS Crop Detection Algorithm (MCDA) procedure for estimating historical planted soybean crop areas was done on fields in Mato Grosso State, Brazil. MCDA is based on temporal profiles of EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) derived from satellite data of the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imager, and was previously developed for soybean area estimation in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. According to the MCDA approach, in Mato Grosso soybean area estimates can be provided in December (1st forecast), using images from the sowing period, and in February (2nd forecast), using images from sowing and maximum crop development period. The results obtained by the MCDA were compared with Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) official estimates of soybean area at municipal level. Coefficients of determination were between 0.93 and 0.98, indicating a good agreement, and also the suitability of MCDA to estimations performed in Mato Grosso State. On average, the MCDA results explained 96% of the variation of the data estimated by the IBGE. In this way, MCDA calibration was able to provide annual thematic soybean maps, forecasting the planted area in the State, with results which are comparable to the official agricultural statistics.\n\nEvaluation of preventative and control measures for congenital syphilis in State of Mato Grosso.\n\nPubMed\n\nOliveira, Leila Regina de; Costa, Maria da ConceiÃ§Ã£o Nascimento; Barreto, Florisneide Rodrigues; Pereira, Susan Martins; Dourado, InÃªs; Teixeira, Maria GlÃ³ria\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCongenital syphilis is an important health problem in Brazil. This study assessed measures aimed at the prevention and control of syphilis in the State of Mato Grosso and its capital, CuiabÃ¡. A descriptive study cross-sectional and of time trends assessing the congenital syphilis was performed in CuiabÃ¡ and Mato Grosso between 2001 and 2011. We compared maternal sociodemographic characteristics and health care utilization related to cases of congenital syphilis during the periods from 2001 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2011. We assessed the temporal trends in this disease's incidence using a simple linear regression. Between 2001 and 2006 in Mato Grosso, 86.8% of the mothers who had live births with congenital syphilis received prenatal care, 90.6% presented with a nontreponemal test reagent at delivery, 96.2% had no information regarding a treponemal confirmatory test at delivery, and 77.6% received inadequate treatment for syphilis; additionally, 75.8% of their partners were not treated. There was a statistically significant reduction in prenatal visits (p = 0.004) and an increase in the proportion of mothers reactive to nontreponemal tests at delivery (p = 0.031) between the two periods. No other variables were found to differ significantly between the periods. In CuiabÃ¡, we observed a similar distribution of variables. In the state and in the capital, the increasing trend of congenital syphilis was not statistically significant. The high incidence of congenital syphilis in Mato Grosso and the low levels of health care indicators for pregnant women with syphilis suggest the need to improve the coverage and quality of prenatal care.\n\n[International migration, health, and work: an analysis of Haitians in Mato Grosso State, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nLeÃ£o, LuÃ­s Henrique da Costa; Muraro, Ana Paula; Palos, CÃ¡ssia Carraco; Martins, Maria Angela C; Borges, Fabiano Tonaco\n\n2017-07-27\n\nThis article addresses the relations between immigration, health, and work in Haitian immigrants in CuiabÃ¡ and VÃ¡rzea Grande, Mato Grosso State, Brazil, emphasizing their work conditions. This was an exploratory study based on primary data collected through a survey of the Haitian population in CuiabÃ¡ in 2014-2015. A total of 452 Haitians were interviewed, living in CuiabÃ¡ and VÃ¡rzea Grande (373 men and 79 women), and the findings point to the precarious social situation of Haitian immigrants in Mato Grosso State, marked by high unemployment. Of the immigrants interviewed, 52.7% were currently working and 26.5% reported a workweek greater than 48 hours. The two main occupations for Haitian immigrants in CuiabÃ¡ were construction and services, and most were working below their original level of training, skills sets, and job experience in Haiti. The main risks identified in these two sectors were physical (53.2% and 63.4%, respectively) and accidents (23.4% and 17.1%, respectively), in addition to reports of physical and psychosocial distress. The study points to the precarious social, economic, and labor conditions of the Haitian population in the capital of Mato Grosso.\n\nRanching modernization in tropical Brazil: foreign investment and environment in Mato Grosso, 1900-1950.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilcox, Robert W\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAccompanying the expansion of modern beef production in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were technologies and methods that proponents assumed were applicable to all ecosystems. successes in Europe, the United States, and Argentina convinced ranchers, investors, and animal scientists that these could be applied in the tropical Americas with ease. This assumption contributed to a wave of foreign ranching investment in semi-tropical Mato Grosso, Brazil, beginning in the early twentieth century. However, such a view failed to consider the specific characteristics of such environments and led to difficulties for several ventures and a re-evaluation of the relationship between ecosystems and the type of ranching appropriate to them. Ultimately, local Brazilian practice and experimentation proved more successful in tropical and semi-tropical Brazil, forcing foreign ranching concerns to adapt their techniques. Following the logic of earlier decades, more recently cattle-raising practices developed in Mato Grosso and similar regions have been applied in the tropical Amazon, resulting in widespread ecological devastation. The uneven experiences of foreign entrepreneurs in Mato Grosso offer valuable lessons for understanding the application of modernization technologies to diverse ecosystems; such knowledge can lead to a more sustainable approach to meat production.\n\nGenetic characterization of an X-STR decaplex system in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil: distribution, forensic efficiency and population structure.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartins, Joyce A; Martins, Denise P; Oliveira-Brancati, Camila I F; Martinez, Juliana; Cicarelli, Regina M B; Souza, DorotÃ©ia R S\n\n2017-11-01\n\nStudies with X-STR loci show population genetic substructure, which makes necessary the characterization of such markers in the different geographical and/or ethnic populations. Therefore, this study assessed the distribution and forensic efficiency of an X-STR decaplex system in the population of the State of Mato Grosso, as well as analysed the population structure of this State based on the aforementioned system. All X-STR markers were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium, and the DXS6809 was the most informative marker. The power of discrimination value in females and males was 0.99999999995 and 0.9999994, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance indicated 1.10% (pÂ <Â 0.00001) of heterogeneity among Europeans, Africans, Brazilians and other Latin Americans, and in relation to such groups, the population of the State of Mato Grosso showed lower genetic variation when compared with the Brazilian group (-0.10%, pÂ =Â 0.67327). The genetic distance analysis showed lower values of F ST (0.0004Â â¤Â F ST Â â¤Â 0.00331), with non-significant p value (pÂ >Â 0.00024), between the populations of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, ParanÃ¡ and the Southeast region of Brazil (except for one sample of Rio de Janeiro). F ST values with significant p values (pÂ â¤Â 0.00024) were obtained between the population of Mato Grosso and Iberian, African and some Latin American populations. The X-STR decaplex system proved to be extremely useful in the population of the State of Mato Grosso, and the data obtained does not show the need for a specific forensic database for this State in relation to the Brazilian populations compared in this study, except for population of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nUnderreporting of gestational, congenital and acquired syphilis among indigenous peoples in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, 2011-2014.\n\nPubMed\n\nTiago, Zuleica da Silva; Picoli, Renata PalÃ³poli; Graeff, Samara Vilas-Boas; Cunha, Rivaldo VenÃ¢ncio da; Arantes, Rui\n\n2017-01-01\n\nto describe the distribution, incidence, and underreporting of syphilis among indigenous peoples from Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. descriptive study performed with secondary data of the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (Sinan) and of the Special Indigenous Sanitary District of Mato Grosso do Sul (DSEI-MS), from 2011 to 2014; the data from both sources were compared to identify underreporting. the highest incidence rates of syphilis in pregnant women were observed in 2014 (41.1/1,000 live births) and of congenital syphilis, in 2013 (10.7/1,000 live births); the highest numbers of underreporting of cases were for syphilis in pregnant women on Sinan (45/79), of congenital syphilis at DSEI-MS (8/17) in 2014, and of acquired syphilis on Sinan in 2011 and 2013 (5/9 and 10/18, respectively). syphilis has a high incidence; underreporting hides the extent of the disease in indigenous peoples from Mato Grosso do Sul.\n\nLand use effects on green water fluxes from agricultural production in Mato Grosso, Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLathuilliere, M. J.; Johnson, M. S.; Donner, S. D.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe blue water/green water paradigm is increasingly used to differentiate between subsequent routing of precipitation once it reaches the soil. âBlueâ water is that which infiltrates deep in the soil to become streams and aquifers, while âgreenâ water is that which remains in the soil and is either evaporated (non-productive green water) or transpired by plants (productive green water). This differentiation in the fate of precipitation has provided a new way of thinking about water resources, especially in agriculture for which better use of productive green water may help to relieve stresses from irrigation (blue water). The state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, presents a unique case for the study of green water fluxes due to an expanding agricultural land base planted primarily to soybean, maize, sugar cane, and cotton. These products are highly dependent on green water resources in Mato Grosso where crops are almost entirely rain-fed. We estimate the change in green water fluxes from agricultural expansion for the 2000-2008 period in the state of Mato Grosso based on agricultural production data from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e EstatÃ­sticas and a modified Penman-Monteith equation. Initial results for seven municipalities suggest an increase in agricultural green water fluxes, ranging from 1-10% per year, due primarily to increases in cropped areas. Further research is underway to elucidate the role of green water flux variations from land use practices on the regional water cycle.\n\nSpatial analysis of American Visceral Leishmaniasis in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Central Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nCorrea Antonialli, Suely Aparecida; Torres, Thais Gisele; Paranhos Filho, Antonio ConceiÃ§Ã£o; Tolezano, JosÃ© Eduardo\n\n2007-05-01\n\nTo map American Visceral Leishmaniasis (AVL) in Mato Grosso do Sul State (Central Brazil). The distribution of AVL was mapped, using the Geographic Information System. The disease was endemic to the CorumbÃ¡ Region from 1913 to 1998. Spatial and temporal analysis indicated that the expansion route and dissemination through the State of the disease has been from west to east, coinciding with three different human interventions; two of them, a federal highway and a rail-road, were constructed in the early twentieth century, from east to west, from Bauru city, in SÃ£o Paulo State, to CorumbÃ¡ city, in Mato Grosso do Sul State. The third anthropogenic intervention was the construction of a gas pipeline that started in 1998, and attracted thousands of workers. This construction route has the same direction, west to east, and timescale as the observed expansion and dissemination of AVL. The results relate the expansion of the disease to intense human traffic along the route of spread.\n\n[Demographic characteristics and mortality among indigenous peoples in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nFerreira, Maria Evanir Vicente; Matsuo, Tiemi; Souza, Regina Kazue Tanno de\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe present study aimed to assess mortality rates and related demographic factors among indigenous peoples in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Central-West Brazil, compared to the State's general population. Mortality rates were estimated based on data obtained from the Health Care Database for Indigenous Peoples and monthly patient care records as well as demographic data from the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) and mortality data from the SUS Mortality Database. Compared to the overall population, among indigenous peoples there were proportionally more individuals under 15 years of age and fewer elderly, besides higher mortality rates at early ages and from infectious and parasitic diseases. Indigenous men showed significantly higher mortality rates from external causes and respiratory and infectious diseases, while among women the mortality rates from external causes and infectious diseases were higher. Suicide rates among young indigenous individuals were also particularly alarming. Indigenous people's health conditions are worse than those of the general population in Mato Grosso do Sul.\n\n[Indigenous peoples' access to health services in CuiabÃ¡, Mato Grosso State, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nGomes, Silvana Cardoso; EsperidiÃ£o, Monique Azevedo\n\n2017-06-12\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate indigenous peoples' access to medium and high-complexity health services in the municipality of CuiabÃ¡, Mato Grosso State, Brazil, through the Casa de SaÃºde IndÃ­gena or Indigenous Peoples' Clinic (CASAI CuiabÃ¡). A single case study with a qualitative approach was conducted at CASAI CuiabÃ¡. Data were obtained from observation of the work routines at CASAI CuiabÃ¡, semi-structured interviews with health professionals and administrators from the CuiabÃ¡ Special Indigenous Health District (DSEI) and CASAI CuiabÃ¡, and document analysis. Data analysis used a matrix derived from the theoretical and logical model of accessibility, validated by the Delphi method with a group of experts on indigenous peoples' health. Despite advances achieved by CASAI in improving indigenous peoples' access, there are persistent social, organizational, cultural, and geographic barriers in access to medium and high-complexity health services in CuiabÃ¡. The study highlights the need for specific strategies to improve access to health services by indigenous peoples in Mato Grosso State.\n\nDeforestation control in Mato Grosso: a new model for slowing the loss of Brazil's Amazon forest.\n\nPubMed\n\nFearnside, Philip M\n\n2003-08-01\n\nControlling deforestation in Brazil's Amazon region has long been illusive despite repeated efforts of government authorities to slow the process. From 1997 to 2000, deforestation rates in Brazil's 9-state \"Legal Amazon\" region continually crept upward. Now, a licensing and enforcement program for clearing by large farmers and ranchers in the state of Mato Grosso appears to be having an effect. The deforestation rate in Mato Grosso was already beginning to slacken before initiation of the program in 1999, but examination of county-level data suggests that deforestation in already heavily cleared areas was falling due to lack of suitable uncleared land, while little-cleared areas were experiencing rapid deforestation. Following initiation of the program, the clearing rates declined in the recent frontiers. Areas with greater enforcement effort also appear to have experienced greater declines. Demonstration of government ability to enforce regulations and influence trends is important to domestic and international debates regarding use of avoided deforestation to mitigate global warming.\n\nVerification and completion of a soil data base for process based erosion model applications in Mato Grosso/Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchindewolf, Marcus; Schultze, Nico; SchÃ¶nke, Daniela; Amorim, Ricardo S. S.; Schmidt, JÃ¼rgen\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe study area of central Mato Grosso is subjected to severe soil erosion. Continuous erosion leads to massive losses of top soil and related organic carbon. Consequently agricultural soil soils suffer a drop in soil fertility which only can be balanced by mineral fertilization. In order to control soil degradation and organic carbon losses of Mato Grosso cropland soils a process based soil loss and deposition model is used. Applying the model it will be possible to: - identify the main areas affected by soil erosion or deposition in different scales under present and future climate and socio-economic conditions - estimate the related nutrient and organic carbon losses/yields - figure out site-related causes of soil mobilization/deposition - locate sediment and sediment related nutrient and organic matter pass over points into surface water bodies - estimate the impacts of climate and land use changes on the losses of top soil, sediment bound nutrients and organic carbon. Model input parameters include digital elevation data, precipitation characteristics and standard soil properties as particle size distribution, total organic carbon (TOC) and bulk density. The effects of different types of land use and agricultural management practices are accounted for by varying site-specific parameters predominantly related to soil surface properties such as erosional resistance, hydraulic roughness and percentage ground cover. In this context the existing EROSION 3D soil parameter data base deducted from large scale rainfall simulations in Germany is verified for application in the study area, using small scale disc type rainfall simulator with an additional runoff reflux approach. Thus it's possible to enlarge virtual plot length up to at least 10 m. Experimental plots are located in CuiabÃ¡ region of central Mato Grosso in order to cover the most relevant land use variants and tillage practices in the region. Results show that derived model parameters are highly influenced\n\n[Triatoma vandae sp.n. of the oliveirai complex from the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae)].\n\nPubMed\n\nCarcavallo, Rodolfo U; Jurberg, JosÃ©; Rocha, Dayse da Silva; Galvao, Cleber; Noireau, FranÃ§ois; Lent, Herman\n\n2002-07-01\n\nThere are several specific complexes belonging to the genus Triatoma Laporte, 1832, which are generally associated to specific geographic areas. Recent publications have linked the oliveirai complex to ecosystems of Mato Grosso, which are also present in other Brazilian states and even in other bordering countries as eastern Paraguay. The study of the abundant material collected during the last years allowed the description of several new species of the oliveirai complex: T. jurbergi Carcavallo, GalvÃ£o Lent, 1998; T. baratai Carcavallo Jurberg, 2000 and T. klugi Carcavallo, Jurberg, Lent GalvÃ£o, 2001. Another new species belonging to the same complex is described here as T. vandae sp.n. It originates from the state of Mato Grosso, and has been reared in the insectary of the LaboratÃ³rio Nacional e Internacional de ReferÃªncia em Taxonomia de TriatomÃ­neos, Departamento de Entomologia, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAssessment of the current state of biodiversity data for butterflies and skippers in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil (Lepidoptera, Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nQueiroz-Santos, Luziany; Dias, Fernando Maia Silva; DellâErba, Rafael; Casagrande, Mirna Martins; Mielke, Olaf Hermann Hendrik\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract Lepidoptera is one of the four megadiverse insect orders, comprising butterflies and moths. In Brazil, the bulk of knowledge about the butterfly fauna is restricted to some areas in the southeast of the country, with large gaps of knowledge in other areas. The state of Mato Grosso is one of the largest states in Brazil, and holds three of the main Brazilian biomes: Amazon rain forest, Cerrado and Pantanal. However, knowledge about Mato Grosso butterflies is fragmented and restricted to a few localities, and information is scattered in various sources. The aim of this study is to assemble the biodiversity information of the butterfly fauna of the state of Mato Grosso based on historical and recent literature data and collections carried out in the southwest of the state from 2007â2009. Records without precise locality data or taxonomic information were not included. Species identification was based on literature and comparison with specimens in collections; higher and species-level taxonomy were updated based on the Neotropical Checklist of Hesperioidea and Papilionoidea and recent phylogenetic and revisionary taxonomic works. In total, 901 species were recorded in 2,820 occurrence records. This represents 148 species of Hesperiidae, 29 Papilionidae, 28 Pieridae, 77 Lycaenidae, 238 Riodinidae, and 381 Nymphalidae. Of these, 207 species records are from the type specimens of species described in the state. Based on the results and literature records for other Brazilian states and biomes, probably the figures for Mato Grosso are underestimated, particularly in the families Hesperiidae, Lycaenidae and Riodinidae, in that order. Future collecting efforts should be directed towards certain areas of the state, especially in less sampled areas and biomes, as the north of the state and Pantanal.

Descriptive study with trend analysis of leprosy indicators in individuals under the age of fifteen registered in the Mato Grosso's System for Notifiable Diseases between 2001 and 2013. We used the Prais-Winsten procedure for analyzing generalized linear regression at a significance level of 5%. We considered as increasing time series when the annual percent change was positive, decreasing when negative and stationary when there was no significant difference between its value and zero. We analyzed 2455 cases of leprosy and the average detection rate in individuals under the age of fifteen was 22.7 per 100 thousand inhabitants. The trend of the general coefficient of incidence was decreasing, with an average annual rate of -5.5% (95%CI -7.5--3.5). Increasing trend was observed with an increase of 6.7% (95%CI 2.7-10.8) in the proportion of multibacillary cases, 9.4% (95%CI 4.4-14.7) of cases diagnosed with dimorphic clinical form and 14% (95%CI 7.9-20.4) of cases with physical disability level 2 at the time of diagnosis. There was an increasing trend in the average proportion of examined contacts, with a growth of 4.1% (95%CI 1.2-7.1) and average proportion of healing was precarious (39.7%), with stationary trend. The historical trend of leprosy cases in individuals under the age of fifteen proved to be decreasing in the period, however the trends of epidemiological indicators such as the proportion of multibacillary cases, physical disability level 2 and healing, indicate late diagnosis with stay sources of transmission and consequent worsening of the disease in the state of Mato Grosso.

Fonseca reported severe deforestation on the banks of the river Paraguay and advocated for protectionist measures from the state government. He set out a vision for Mato Grosso's development that involved better use of the state's natural resources, raw materials exports, and regional industrialization support. The methodology created an interface between environmental history and history of the sciences.\n\nMolecular identification of Hepatozoon canis in dogs from Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamos, Carlos Alberto do Nascimento; Babo-Terra, VerÃ´nica Jorge; Pedroso, Thatianna Camillo; Souza Filho, AntÃ´nio Francisco; de AraÃºjo, FlÃ¡bio Ribeiro; Cleveland, Herbert Patric Kellermann\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of Hepatozoon species infecting dogs in the municipality of Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Brazil, using blood samples (n = 165) drawn from dogs. The species Hepatozoon canis was identified in 3.63% of the tested animals using molecular tools. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical relevance of this infection and the main arthropod vectors involved in its transmission.\n\nUnrevealing the leaf frogs Cerrado diversity: A new species of Pithecopus (Anura, Arboranae, Phyllomedusidae) from the Mato Grosso state, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaga, Isabelle Aquemi; Andrade, Felipe Silva de; Bruschi, Daniel Pacheco; Recco-Pimentel, Shirlei Maria; Giaretta, Ariovaldo Antonio\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Neotropical frog genus Pithecopus comprises currently 10 species. A recent molecular phylogeny suggested the existence of two subclades within it, one of them including P. palliatus, P. azureus, P. hypochondrialis, and P. nordestinus (lowland species). Herein we describe a new species of this subclade from Pontal do Araguaia, in the Brazilian Cerrado in the Mato Grosso state. Recognition of the new species is supported by adult morphology, advertisement call and molecular data. The new species differs from Pithecopus highland species by its smaller head width and lack of the reticulate pattern on flanks. From lowland species, the new form differs by being significantly smaller in snout vent-length, advertisement call with the greatest number of pulses, and high genetic distance. Interestingly, we also report on occurrence of P. hypochondrialis (its sister species) at an adjacent site (about 3km). Also, we report on the occurrence of the new species in the Chapada dos GuimarÃ£es and Santa Terezinha, both also in the Mato Grosso state.\n\n[Family Health Program implementation in municipalities in Mato Grosso State, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nCanesqui, Ana Maria; Spinelli, Maria AngÃ©lica do Santos\n\n2008-04-01\n\nThis article analysis some key aspects in the implementation of the Family Health Program (FHP): results; conditions; and institutional mechanisms; flow and regularity of funding; organizational structures; and human resources availability and training. The study was conducted in seven municipalities (counties) in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, and used secondary data as well as primary data from interviews with different stakeholders. The research design was evaluative, using a quantitative/qualitative analysis. The results showed: varying stages in the implementation process, different FHP models, and adaptation of organizational structures; high level of human resources availability, except for nurse assistants; availability of financial resources, with some difficulties in their flow; and other institutional factors that hinder or facilitate the micro-implementation process in the municipalities.\n\nOccurrence of lace bug Vatiga illudens and Vatiga manihotae (Hemiptera: Tingidae) in Mato Grosso do Sul, midwestern Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nBellon, PatrÃ­cia P; Wengrat, Ana P G S; Kassab, Samir O; Pietrowski, Vanda; Loureiro, ElisÃ¢ngela S\n\n2012-09-01\n\nNymphs and adults of the lace bug (Hemiptera: Tingidae) have been found in cassava crops (Manihot esculenta) in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil. The insects were collected in the field and taken to the laboratory where they were identified based on some morphological traits of the species Vatiga manihotae (Drake) and V. illudens (Drake), which are first reported in the aforementioned state.\n\nUse of LANDSAT images to study cerrado vegetation. [Mato Grosso Sul, Brazil\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParada, N. D. J. (Principal Investigator); Filho, P. H.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nChannel 5 and 7 LANDSAT imagery at the scale of 1:250,000 made during passes in the dry and rainy seasons were used to select the optimal season for cerrado characterization in Mato Grosso do Sul State. The study area is located around the cities of Campo Grande and Tres Lagoas, a region being used for reforestation and rangeland activities. Imagery acquired during the dry season permitted a good discrimination between \"cerrado\" (woodsy pasture) vegetation and reforestation. In relation to the altered areas, only the recently modified area presented good discrimination of cerrado vegetation. Imagery of the rainy season did not provide a reasonable separation between cerrado and reforestation areas but the altered area could be easily discriminated.\n\n[Congenital defects in the cities with high use of pesticides in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nOliveira, Noemi Pereira; Moi, Gisele Pedroso; Atanaka-Santos, Marina; Silva, Ageo MÃ¡rio Candido; Pignati, Wanderlei AntÃ´nio\n\n2014-10-01\n\nMato Grosso is the largest agricultural producer and the largest national consumer of pesticides in Brazil. Maternal exposure to pesticides in the periconceptional period has been associated with increased risk of congenital malformations. This article aims to analyze the association between the use of pesticides and congenital malformations in cities with highest exposure to pesticides in Mato Grosso. It was a case-control study conducted with 219 live births with congenital malformations and 862 live births. The average use of pesticides was estimated in the prior and subsequent trimester to the date of fertilization and throughout the periconceptional period per city, month and year of use. Subsequently, these measures were quartilized and transformed into indicator-type (dummy) variables, attributing an exposure level for each interquartile interval. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted. Significant associations were observed (p < 0.05) in the third (OR = 1.66, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.79) and fourth quartile (OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.24) of the post-fertilization period and the fourth quartile (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.56) throughout the periconceptional period. Maternal exposure to pesticides was associated with higher incidence of congenital malformations.\n\nUnrevealing the leaf frogs Cerrado diversity: A new species of Pithecopus (Anura, Arboranae, Phyllomedusidae) from the Mato Grosso state, Brazil\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBruschi, Daniel Pacheco; Recco-Pimentel, Shirlei Maria; Giaretta, Ariovaldo Antonio\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Neotropical frog genus Pithecopus comprises currently 10 species. A recent molecular phylogeny suggested the existence of two subclades within it, one of them including P. palliatus, P. azureus, P. hypochondrialis, and P. nordestinus (lowland species). Herein we describe a new species of this subclade from Pontal do Araguaia, in the Brazilian Cerrado in the Mato Grosso state. Recognition of the new species is supported by adult morphology, advertisement call and molecular data. The new species differs from Pithecopus highland species by its smaller head width and lack of the reticulate pattern on flanks. From lowland species, the new form differs by being significantly smaller in snout vent-length, advertisement call with the greatest number of pulses, and high genetic distance. Interestingly, we also report on occurrence of P. hypochondrialis (its sister species) at an adjacent site (about 3km). Also, we report on the occurrence of the new species in the Chapada dos GuimarÃ£es and Santa Terezinha, both also in the Mato Grosso state.

Source Data Uncertainties\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMorton, Douglas C.; Sales, Marcio H.; Souza, Carlos M., Jr.; Griscom, Bronson\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHistoric carbon emissions are an important foundation for proposed efforts to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance forest carbon stocks through conservation and sustainable forest management (REDD+). The level of uncertainty in historic carbon emissions estimates is also critical for REDD+, since high uncertainties could limit climate benefits from mitigation actions. Here, we analyzed source data uncertainties based on the range of available deforestation, forest degradation, and forest carbon stock estimates for the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso during 1990-2008. Results: Deforestation estimates showed good agreement for multi-year trends of increasing and decreasing deforestation during the study period. However, annual deforestation rates differed by >20% in more than half of the years between 1997-2008, even for products based on similar input data. Tier 2 estimates of average forest carbon stocks varied between 99-192 Mg C/ha, with greatest differences in northwest Mato Grosso. Carbon stocks in deforested areas increased over the study period, yet this increasing trend in deforested biomass was smaller than the difference among carbon stock datasets for these areas. Conclusions: Patterns of spatial and temporal disagreement among available data products provide a roadmap for future efforts to reduce source data uncertainties for estimates of historic forest carbon emissions. Specifically, regions with large discrepancies in available estimates of both deforestation and forest carbon stocks are priority areas for evaluating and improving existing estimates. Full carbon accounting for REDD+ will also require filling data gaps, including forest degradation and secondary forest, with annual data on all forest transitions.\n\nSoybean development: the impact of a decade of agricultural change on urban and economic growth in Mato Grosso, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nRichards, Peter; Pellegrina, Heitor; VanWey, Leah; Spera, Stephanie\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this research we consider the impact of export-driven, soybean agriculture in Mato Grosso on regional economic growth. Here we argue that the soybean sector has served as a motor to the state's economy by increasing the demand for services, housing, and goods, and by providing a source of investment capital to the non-agricultural sector. Specifically, we show that each square kilometer of soybean production supports 2.5 formal sector jobs outside of agriculture, and the equivalent of approximately 150,000US in annual, non-agricultural GDP. We also show that annual gains in non-agricultural employment and GDP are closely tied to soybean profitability, and thus vary from year to year. However, while this article highlights the potential of the agricultural sector as a driver of regional economic growth, it also acknowledges that this growth has been sustained by profits determined by externally set prices and the rate of exchange, and that future growth trajectories will be susceptible to potential currency of market shocks. We also show that while Mato Grosso's economic growth has come at a significant cost to the environment, value added by the agriculture sector, directly and indirectly, has surpassed the value of the CO2-e emitted through land clearings.\n\nAssessing the MODIS crop detection algorithm for soybean crop area mapping and expansion in the Mato Grosso state, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nGusso, Anibal; Arvor, Damien; Ducati, Jorge Ricardo; Veronez, Mauricio Roberto; da Silveira, Luiz Gonzaga\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEstimations of crop area were made based on the temporal profiles of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Evaluation of the ability of the MODIS crop detection algorithm (MCDA) to estimate soybean crop areas was performed for fields in the Mato Grosso state, Brazil. Using the MCDA approach, soybean crop area estimations can be provided for December (first forecast) using images from the sowing period and for February (second forecast) using images from the sowing period and the maximum crop development period. The area estimates were compared to official agricultural statistics from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and from the National Company of Food Supply (CONAB) at different crop levels from 2000/2001 to 2010/2011. At the municipality level, the estimates were highly correlated, with R (2) = 0.97 and RMSD = 13,142 ha. The MCDA was validated using field campaign data from the 2006/2007 crop year. The overall map accuracy was 88.25%, and the Kappa Index of Agreement was 0.765. By using pre-defined parameters, MCDA is able to provide the evolution of annual soybean maps, forecast of soybean cropping areas, and the crop area expansion in the Mato Grosso state.\n\nEndoparasites infecting the semiaquatic coral snake Micrurus surinamensis (Squamata: Elapidae) in the southern Amazonian region, Mato Grosso state, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nÃvila, R W; Morais, D H; Anjos, L A; Almeida, W O; Silva, R J\n\n2013-08-01\n\nA parasitological survey was conducted in specimens of the semiaquatic coral snake Micrurus surinamensis, a poorly known South American elapid. Four specimens collected at the southern Amazon region in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso were analyzed for endoparasites. Three parasite species were recovered from the snake hosts: the pentastomid Sebekia oxycephala, the nematode Physaloptera sp. and the trematode Opisthogonimus lecithonotus. This represents new locality and host record for S. oxycephala and O. lecithonotus.\n\nHistoric emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in Mato Grosso, Brazil: 1) source data uncertainties\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Historic carbon emissions are an important foundation for proposed efforts to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance forest carbon stocks through conservation and sustainable forest management (REDD+).

The frequency of these findings seems to vary among different places and reports. There is a lack of information about this issue in Brazil. OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of cutaneous findings affecting HBV or HCV carriers from a reference outpatient unit in Mato Grosso. METHODS A cross-sectional observational study. RESULTS 108 patients were studied. 88.9% presented some cutaneous findings but must of them were nonrelated to chronic viral infection. Four patients had cutaneous or autoimmune syndromes that may be HBV or HCV related. CONCLUSION In our study we found no statistical association between viral hepatitis and skin diseases.

The new species can be distinguished from congeners by having the body intensely yellowish in life (v. silvery, reddish or lightly yellow) and by morphometric and meristics traits. Astyanax dolinae n. sp. cannot be assigned to any of the Astyanax species complex currently recognized for the genus.

Samples were collected along 30 transects of 250 m in length in a 5Ã5 km grid (25 km2). Five pitfalls baited with human feces were placed in each transect. A total of 1692 individuals in 19 species were captured, the majority in the subfamily Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae. Assemblages were influenced by the duration of flooding and leaf litter volume. None of the other habitat variables was correlated with species richness. Cultivated pastures with exotic grasses were unimportant for composition of the assemblages of beetles. These results indicate that duration of flooding is the most important regulating force in this community.\n\nDENGUE OUTBREAK IN MATO GROSSO STATE, MIDWESTERN BRAZIL\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHEINEN, LetÃ­cia Borges da Silva; ZUCHI, Nayara; CARDOSO, Belgath Fernandes; dos SANTOS, Marcelo Adriano Mendes; NOGUEIRA, Mauricio Lacerda; DEZENGRINI-SLHESSARENKO, Renata\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDengue virus (DENV) is the most frequent arbovirus worldwide. In this study, we report a large outbreak in Mato Grosso State (MT). Serum samples from 604 patients with acute febrile illness for less than five days were inoculated in C6/36 cells, then infected cells were subjected to an indirect immunofluorescence test for DENV serotypes and yellow fever virus. Serum samples were submitted to a multiplex-semi-nested-RT-PCR for 11 flaviviruses. DENV-4 was isolated in 150/604 (24.8%) and DENV-1 in 19/604 (3.1%) specimens. By RT-PCR, 331 (54.8%) samples tested positive for DENV; 321 had single infections (DENV-4 n = 305; DENV-1 n = 15; DENV-3 n = 1), nine had co-infections of DENV-1/DENV-4, and one of DENV-2/DENV-4. DENV-4 was detected in 315/331 (95.2%) positive patients from 17 municipalities, and DENV-1 in 24/331 (7.2%) patients from five cities in north-central MT and the city of Cuiaba. The incidence of infection was higher in patients aged 20-39 (142/331; 42.9%). The NS5 partial nucleotide sequence of DENV-1 was most similar to that of genotype V, DENV-2 to Southeast Asian/American, DENV-3 to genotype III, and DENV-4 to genotype II strains, considered the most frequent strains in Brazil. This outbreak coincided with the introduction of DENV-4 in the state. Cuiaba was hyperendemic for the four DENV serotypes, highlighting the necessity for arbovirus surveillance in MT.

Recent studies found 20% of households were infested by triatomines, 18% of insects captured in the community were infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, and 22.7% of dogs presented T. cruzi antibodies. The low prevalence of Chagas disease observed in humans in Mato Grosso do Sul State is attributed to its arrival via colonist migration and subsequent transplacental transmission. In order to gain a better understanding of the T. cruzi cycle in residents of the study community, serological and molecular tests were carried out to diagnose Chagas disease. In the present study, 175 residents between 2 and 80 years old were included. A total of 175 participants were interviewed and 170 provided blood samples, which were tested for T. cruzi antibodies with serological tests. Molecular diagnosis was performed in 167 participants by PCR (KDNA) and NPCR (satellite DNA) tests. One of the 170 samples tested positive for all serological tests performed.

Descriptive study of reported tuberculosis cases in the Brazilian Case Registry Database. We included only those cases in which M. tuberculosis culture was positive and sensitivity to drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, streptomycin and ethambutol) was tested. LÃ¶wenstein-Jensen and Ogawa-Kudoh solid media were used for cultures, as was an automated liquid medium system. Sensitivity tests were based on the proportion method. Among the 783 cases evaluated, males predominated (69.7%), as did patients in the 20-49 year age bracket (70%), a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (94.4%) and positive HIV serology (8.6%); 645 (82.4%) were new cases, and 138 (17.6%) had previously been treated. Resistance to at least one drug was found in 143 cases (18.3%). The primary resistance (PR) rate was, respectively, 8.1%, 1.6%, 2.8% and 12.4%, for monoresistance, multidrug resistance (MDR), other patterns of resistance and resistance to at least one drug, whereas the acquired resistance (AR) rate was 14.5%, 20.3%, 10.9% and 45.7%, respectively, and the combined resistance (CR) rate was 9.2%, 4.9%, 4.2% and 18.3%, respectively. In PR, streptomycin was the most common drug, whereas isoniazid was the most common in AR and CR (7.2% and 3.7%, respectively). These high levels of resistance undermine the efforts for tuberculosis control in Mato Grosso do Sul. Acquired MDR was 12.7 times more common than was primary MDR, demonstrating that the previous use of drug therapy is an indicator of resistance. These levels reflect the poor quality of the health care provided to these patients, showing the importance of using the directly observed treatment, short course strategy, as well as the need to perform cultures and sensitivity tests for the early diagnosis of drug resistance.\n\n[Managerial performance in public health services: a case study in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nBarbieri, Ana Rita; Hortale, Virginia Alonso\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis paper presents part of a doctoral dissertation that developed a theoretical model capable of identifying managerial performance in various administrative levels of a Municipal Health Secretariat. The methodology was a case study of the Municipal Health Secretariat in Campo Grande, capital of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The theoretical model was based on recent debates emphasizing the need to modernize public administration, with an emphasis on efficacy and efficiency in the organizations as a whole. Some 31 interviews were conducted with the objective of identifying the managers' performance, through questions based on their daily practices in planning, organization, direction, and control. Managers from higher hierarchical levels obtained better results, while those in basic health units generally developed activities and complied with decisions passed down by imposition, with limited capacity to plan, organize, or control activities pertaining to their management sphere. These results stem partially from the charismatic leadership and centralizing administration of the current management in the municipal health system.\n\n[The magic universe of cures: the role of magic practices and witchcraft in the universe of 17th century Mato Grosso].\n\nPubMed\n\nSÃ¡, Mario\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe article analyzes the role of healing agents played by practitioners of magic and witchcraft in Mato Grosso society during the 17th century. It observes that magic and witchcraft were developed as competitors, alternatives or associated with other forms of healing (official and lay). It points out how such roles contributed to the process of subjugating its practitioners, especially Africans, Indians and their descendents, and were appropriated as an opportunity for survival in the colonial slave society. The pastoral visit made by Bruno Pinna in 1785 to CuiabÃ¡ and nearby areas served as the principal source of knowledge regarding the practices and practitioners of magic and witchcraft.\n\nDetermining the rate of forest conversion in Mato Grosso, Brazil, using Landsat MSS and AVHRR data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNelson, Ross; Horning, Ned; Stone, Thomas A.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nAVHRR-LAC thermal data and Landsat MSS and TM spectral data were used to estimate the rate of forest clearing in Mato Grosso, Brazil, between 1981 and 1984. The Brazilian state was stratified into forest and nonforest. A list sampling procedure was used in the forest stratum to select Landsat MSS scenes for processing based on estimates of fire activity in the scenes. Fire activity in 1984 was estimated using AVHRR-LAC thermal data. State-wide estimates of forest conversion indicate that between 1981 and 1984, 353,966 ha + or - 77,000 ha (0.4 percent of the state area) were converted per year. No evidence of reforestation was found in this digital sample. The relationship between forest clearing rate (based on MSS-TM analysis) and fire activity (estimated using AVHRR data) was noisy (R-squared = 0.41). The results suggest that AVHRR data may be put to better use as a stratification tool than as a subsidiary variable in list sampling.\n\nSoybean Development: The Impact of a Decade of Agricultural Change on Urban and Economic Growth in Mato Grosso, Brazil\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRichards, Peter; Pellegrina, Heitor; VanWey, Leah; Spera, Stephanie\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this research we consider the impact of export-driven, soybean agriculture in Mato Grosso on regional economic growth. Here we argue that the soybean sector has served as a motor to the stateâs economy by increasing the demand for services, housing, and goods, and by providing a source of investment capital to the non-agricultural sector. Specifically, we show that each square kilometer of soybean production supports 2.5 formal sector jobs outside of agriculture, and the equivalent of approximately 150,000US in annual, non-agricultural GDP. We also show that annual gains in non-agricultural employment and GDP are closely tied to soybean profitability, and thus vary from year to year. However, while this article highlights the potential of the agricultural sector as a driver of regional economic growth, it also acknowledges that this growth has been sustained by profits determined by externally set prices and the rate of exchange, and that future growth trajectories will be susceptible to potential currency of market shocks. We also show that while Mato Grossoâs economic growth has come at a significant cost to the environment, value added by the agriculture sector, directly and indirectly, has surpassed the value of the CO2-e emitted through land clearings.

Biological samples were collected, in addition to clinical, epidemiological, and sociodemographic data. Stool analyzes were based on sedimentation by centrifugation and on spontaneous sedimentation. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine vitamin A and C levels. ELISA was employed to quantify interleukins. Intestinal parasites were found in 29 of the 66 subjects assessed (43.9%). Endolimax nana (22.7%), Entamoeba coli (21.1%), Giardia lamblia (6.1%), Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar (4.5%), and Ascaris lumbricoides (4.5%) were the most prevalent species. Pathogenic parasites were detected in 11 individuals (16.7%). Hypovitaminoses A and C were detected in 19.6% (13/66) and 98.4% (65/66) of subjects, respectively. IL-5 and IL-10 production was observed in 21 (31.8%) and 32 (48.4%) subjects, respectively. Infection with pathogenic intestinal parasites was not a cause of vitamin A and C deficiency or IL-5 and IL-10 production among these workers.

E.; Marquardt, K.; Howell, D.; Schreiber, A.; O'Reilly, S. Y.; Griffin, W. L.; Kaminsky, F. V.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nA unique set of diamonds with a 'milky' optical appearance from the Rio Soriso placer deposit in the Juina area, Mato Grosso, Brazil was studied by combined transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The main characteristics of the studied samples are large numbers of randomly distributed {111}-faceted octahedral defect nanostructures. The dislocation densities of the focused ion beam (FIB) foils are generally low. Dislocation loops are observed only around larger inclusions. The inclusion size shows a bimodal distribution and spreads around values of 20 and 200 nm. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy mapping of both subsets yield high nitrogen contents for all sealed inclusions. In cases where the nanoinclusions touch the surface of the FIB section no nitrogen signal could be detected, indicating the loss of a fluid or gas phase as the carrier of nitrogen. FTIR mapping of the same regions showed a strong correlation between structurally bound nitrogen, hydrogen and the abundance of nanoinclusions. We propose that the most likely phase included in these nanoinclusions is NH3. These nanoinclusions could be the result of a high-temperature episode or of long residence times at shallower depths and lower temperatures. Thus they might represent the last stage of the nitrogen aggregation, or they may be syngenetic trapped NH-bearing source fluids.\n\nSAINT LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS IN MATO GROSSO, CENTRAL-WESTERN BRAZIL.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeinen, LetÃ­cia Borges da Silva; Zuchi, Nayara; Serra, OtacÃ­lia Pereira; Cardoso, Belgath Fernandes; Gondim, Breno Herman Ferreira; Dos Santos, Marcelo Adriano Mendes; Souto, Francisco JosÃ© Dutra; Paula, Daphine Ariadne Jesus de; Dutra, ValÃ©ria; Dezengrini-Slhessarenko, Renata\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe dengue virus (DENV), which is frequently involved in large epidemics, and the yellow fever virus (YFV), which is responsible for sporadic sylvatic outbreaks, are considered the most important flaviviruses circulating in Brazil. Because of that, laboratorial diagnosis of acute undifferentiated febrile illness during epidemic periods is frequently directed towards these viruses, which may eventually hinder the detection of other circulating flaviviruses, including the Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), which is widely dispersed across the Americas. The aim of this study was to conduct a molecular investigation of 11 flaviviruses using 604 serum samples obtained from patients during a large dengue fever outbreak in the state of Mato Grosso (MT) between 2011 and 2012. Simultaneously, 3,433 female Culex spp. collected with Nasci aspirators in the city of CuiabÃ¡, MT, in 2013, and allocated to 409 pools containing 1-10 mosquitoes, were also tested by multiplex semi-nested reverse transcription PCR for the same flaviviruses. SLEV was detected in three patients co-infected with DENV-4 from the cities of CuiabÃ¡ and VÃ¡rzea Grande. One of them was a triple co-infection with DENV-1. None of them mentioned recent travel or access to sylvatic/rural regions, indicating that transmission might have occurred within the metropolitan area. Regarding mosquito samples, one pool containing one Culex quinquefasciatus female was positive for SLEV, with a minimum infection rate (MIR) of 0.29 per 1000 specimens of this species. Phylogenetic analysis indicates both human and mosquito SLEV cluster, with isolates from genotype V-A obtained from animals in the Amazon region, in the state of ParÃ¡.

The aim of this study was to rescue genetic variability in the genus Capsicum in the southwest region of Mato Grosso, and to characterize and estimate the genetic diversity of accessions based on morphoagronomic descriptors and inter-simple sequence repeat molecular markers. Data were obtained following the criteria of the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute, renamed Bioversity International for Capsicum. Data were analyzed using different multivariate statistical techniques. An array of binary data was used to analyze molecular data, and the arithmetic complement of the Jaccard index was used to estimate the genetic dissimilarity among accessions. Six well-defined groups were formed based on the morphological characterization. The most divergent accessions were 142 and 126, with 125 and 126 being the most similar. The groups formed following agronomic characterization differed from those formed by morphological characterization, and there was a need to subdivide the groups for better distinction of accessions. Based on molecular analysis, accessions were divided into two groups, and there was also a need to subdivide the groups. Based on joint analysis (morphological + agronomic + molecular), six groups were formed with no duplicates. For all groups, the cophenetic correlation coefficient was higher than 0.8. These results provide useful information for the better management of the work collection. All correlations between the combined distance matrix were significant by the Mantel test.\n\nSAINT LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS IN MATO GROSSO, CENTRAL-WESTERN BRAZIL\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHEINEN, LetÃ­cia Borges da Silva; ZUCHI, Nayara; SERRA, OtacÃ­lia Pereira; CARDOSO, Belgath Fernandes; GONDIM, Breno Herman Ferreira; dos SANTOS, Marcelo Adriano Mendes; SOUTO, Francisco JosÃ© Dutra; de PAULA, Daphine Ariadne Jesus; DUTRA, ValÃ©ria; DEZENGRINI-SLHESSARENKO, Renata\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe dengue virus (DENV), which is frequently involved in large epidemics, and the yellow fever virus (YFV), which is responsible for sporadic sylvatic outbreaks, are considered the most important flaviviruses circulating in Brazil.

Teixeira, AntÃ´nio H.; Victoria, Daniel C.; Andrade, Ricardo G.; Leivas, Janice F.; Bolfe, Edson L.; Cruz, Caroline R.\n\n2014-10-01\n\nMato Grosso state, Central West Brazil, has been highlighted by the grain production, mainly soybean and corn, as first (November-March) and second (April-August) harvest crops, respectively. For water productivity (WP) analyses, MODIS products together with a net of weather stations were used. Evapotranspiration (ET) and biomass production (BIO) were acquired during the year 2012 and WP was considered as the ratio of BIO to ET. The SAFER (Simple Algorithm For Evapotranspiration Retrieving) for ET and the Monteith's radiation model for BIO were applied together, considering a mask which separated the crops from other surface types. In relation to the first harvest crop ET, BIO and WP values above of those for other surface types, happened only from November to January with incremental values reaching to 1.2 mm day-1; 67 kg ha-1 day-1; and 0.7 kg m-3, respectively; and between March and May for the second harvest crops, with incremental values attaining 0.5 mm day-1; 27 kg ha-1 day-1; and 0.3 kg m-3, respectively. In both cases, during the growing seasons, the highest WP parameters in cropped areas corresponded, in general, to the blooming to grain filling transition. Considering corn crop, which nowadays is increasing in terms of cultivated areas in the Brazilian Central West region, and crop water productivity (CWP) the ratio of yield to the amount of water consumed, the main growing regions North, Southeast and Northeast were analyzed. Southeast presented the highest annual pixel averages for ET, BIO and CWP (1.7 mm day-1, 78 kg ha-1 day-1 and 2.2 kg m-3, respectively); while for Northeast they were the lowest ones (1.2 mm day-1, 52 kg ha-1 dia-1 and 1.9 kg m-3). Throughout a soil moisture indicator, the ratio of precipitation (P) to ET, it was indeed noted that rainfall was enough for a good grain yield, with P/ET lower than 1.00 only outside the crop growing seasons. The combination of MODIS images and weather stations proved to be useful for monitoring\n\nSpatial and temporal abundance of three sylvatic yellow fever vectors in the influence area of the Manso hydroelectric power plant, Mato Grosso, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nRibeiro, A L M; Miyazaki, R D; Silva, M; Zeilhofer, P\n\n2012-01-01\n\nHuman biting catches of sylvatic yellow fever (SYF) vectors were conducted at eight stations in the influence area of the Manso hydroelectric power plant (Central Brazil) in sampling campaigns every 2 mo from July 2000 to November 2001. In total, 206 individuals were captured and classified as one of three species important for the transmission of SYF in Mato Grosso state: Haemagogus (Haemagogus) janthinomys (Dyar, 1921); Haemagogus (Conopostegus) leucocelaenus (Dyar & Shannon, 1924); and Sabethes (Sabethoides) chloropterus (Humboldt, 1819). The highest vector abundance was observed during the rainy season (November through March) and SYF vectors were present in all sampling points throughout the year, mainly in riparian and shadowed transitional forests at shadowed ramps.\n\nComparison of sampling designs for estimating deforestation from landsat TM and MODIS imagery: a case study in Mato Grosso, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Shanyou; Zhang, Hailong; Liu, Ronggao; Cao, Yun; Zhang, Guixin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSampling designs are commonly used to estimate deforestation over large areas, but comparisons between different sampling strategies are required.

The MODIS-derived deforestation is used to assist in sampling and extrapolation. Three sampling designs are compared according to the estimated deforestation of the entire study area based on simple extrapolation and linear regression models. The results show that stratified sampling for strata construction and sample allocation using the MODIS-derived deforestation hotspots provided more precise estimations than simple random and systematic sampling.

A cross-sectional study was conducted with 866 construction and heavy construction workers. Participants responded to an epidemiological survey subdivided in: identification data, sociodemographic data; lifestyle; work environment characteristics; occupational exposure factors; hearing protection measures; and hearing handicap inventory to quantify the psychosocial consequences of work-related hearing loss. The prevalence of hearing impairment among workers in the construction sector was 14.43% (n = 125). There were 311 emotional and social complaints related to hearing problems. Hearing handicap was associated with: 60 or over age group (PR = 1.94, 95%CI 1.01 - 3.71); alcohol consumption (PR = 1.94, 95%CI 1.38 - 2.73); direct exposure to noise (PR = 1.75; 95%CI 1.03 - 2.97); exposure to dust (PR = 1.59, 95%CI 1.13 - 2.24); non-use of earplugs (PR = 1.39, 95%CI 1.00 - 1.93); and non-use of neck flap cap (PR = 1.52, 95%CI 1.09 - 2.13). We observed a high prevalence of hearing impairment among workers in the construction sector associated with: individuals aged 60 years or older; alcoholism; exposure to noise and dust; non-use of earplugs; and non-use of neck flap cap. Therefore, it is necessary to implement policies aimed at preserving the hearing health of construction and heavy construction workers.\n\nIndividual tree detection in intact forest and degraded forest areas in the north region of Mato Grosso State, Brazilian Amazon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSantos, E. G.; Jorge, A.; Shimabukuro, Y. E.; Gasparini, K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe State of Mato Grosso - MT has the second largest area with degraded forest among the states of the Brazilian Legal Amazon. Land use and land cover change processes that occur in this region cause the loss of forest biomass, releasing greenhouse gases that contribute to the increase of temperature on earth. These degraded forest areas lose biomass according to the intensity and magnitude of the degradation type. The estimate of forest biomass, commonly performed by forest inventory through sample plots, shows high variance in degraded forest areas. Due to this variance and complexity of tropical forests, the aim of this work was to estimate forest biomass using LiDAR point clouds in three distinct forest areas: one degraded by fire, another by selective logging and one area of intact forest. The approach applied in these areas was the Individual Tree Detection (ITD). To isolate the trees, we generated Canopy Height Models (CHM) images, which are obtained by subtracting the Digital Elevation Model (MDE) and the Digital Terrain Model (MDT), created by the cloud of LiDAR points. The trees in the CHM images are isolated by an algorithm provided by the Quantitative Ecology research group at the School of Forestry at Northern Arizona University (SILVA, 2015). With these points, metrics were calculated for some areas, which were used in the model of biomass estimation. The methodology used in this work was expected to reduce the error in biomass estimate in the study area. The cloud points of the most representative trees were analyzed, and thus field data was correlated with the individual trees found by the proposed algorithm. In a pilot study, the proposed methodology was applied generating the individual tree metrics: total height and area of the crown. When correlating 339 isolated trees, an unsatisfactory RÂ² was obtained, as heights found by the algorithm were lower than those obtained in the field, with an average difference of 2.43 m. This shows that the\n\nMorphometric Analysis of Longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae) Complex Populations in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantos, Mirella F C; Andrade Filho, JosÃ© D; Fernandes, Carlos E S; Mateus, NathÃ¡lia L F; Eguchi, Gabriel U; Fernandes, Wedson D; Brazil, Reginaldo P; Oliveira, Everton F; Oliveira, Alessandra G\n\n2015-05-01\n\nOwing to the existence of cryptic species that are difficult to distinguish morphologically, the search for new taxonomic characters and methods for identifying and classifying sand flies continues. Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva, 1912) and Lutzomyia cruzi (Mangabeira, 1938) (Diptera: Psychodidae) are two such species that occur in sympatry in some regions of Mato Grosso do Sul State (MS). Twenty females and twenty males from each of the five populations of Lu. longipalpis and one population of Lu. cruzi from MS were examined. An outlying population of Lu. longipalpis from Estrela de Alagoas, State of Alagoas, was used to compare the degree of divergence among the groups in MS. Specimens were cleared, mounted on slides, identified, and measured using LAS-Leica. The principal component analysis of morphometric characters showed a high degree of variation among females, while males varied to a lower degree. The populations of Alagoas and Miranda demonstrated the greatest variation. The first region, Alagoas, is geographically distant from the others and occurs under distinctly different ecological conditions, which likely accounts for the variation. Further studies should be made to elucidate the factors that contribute to the differences found between the populations of MS. Â© The Authors 2015.

This study aimed to identify and document species of medicinal plants used by local experts from riverine communities in the North Araguaia microregion in Mato Grosso State, and to further chemical and pharmacological studies on species selected based on searches in the relevant literature. This is a cross-sectional ethnobotanical study, with non-probabilistic sampling (n =60), that applied the snowball method to select local riverine experts who understand medicinal plant use. Socio-demographic, ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological data (vernacular name, uses, geographical origin, habit, method of preparation and part used) on medicinal plants were collected during semi-structured interviews. The results were analyzed by descriptive and quantitative means: indices of use-report (UR) were used to select plant species with therapeutic potential. In total, 309 plant species belonging to 86 botanical families were cited; 73% were native to Brazil, and Fabaceae was the most representative family (11.3%). Arboreal was the predominant life form (37.2%). The leaf was the most used part (28.9%). Infusion was the most commonly reported method of preparation (31.3%). The plants reported in the survey were indicated for 18 of the 22 ICD-10 disease categories. The disease categories most commonly cited were the infectious and parasitic diseases (IPD, 718 UR), digestive system diseases (DSD, 565 UR) and respiratory system diseases (RSD, 504 UR), representing 16.6%, 13.1% and 11.7%, respectively of the total UR.

In the border region, the incidence rate (49.1/100,000 inhabitants), mortality rate (4.0/100,000 inhabitants), and treatment dropout rate (11.3%) were 1.6, 1.8, and 1.5 times higher than in the non-border region. Among indigenous individuals in the border region, the rates for incidence (253.4/100,000 inhabitants), mortality (11.6/100,000 inhabitants), and HIV/TB co-infection (1.9/100,000 inhabitants) were 6.4, 3.2, and 1.9 times higher than in non-indigenous individuals in this region. Living in the border regions was inversely associated with HIV/TB co-infection. Indigenous ethnicity was associated statistically with not abandoning TB treatment. The study concludes that the population residing in these municipalities along the border is exposed to high risk of pulmonary TB and TB mortality and treatment dropout, thus requiring special health surveillance interventions.\n\nEconomic analysis of vaccination to control bovine brucellosis in the States of Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlves, A J S; Rocha, F; Amaku, M; Ferreira, F; Telles, E O; Grisi Filho, J H H; Ferreira Neto, J S; Zylbersztajn, D; Dias, R A\n\n2015-03-01\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic disease that causes important economic losses in Brazil, and the country has therefore established a national program for its control and eradication. Using data generated in the last national brucellosis survey, we conducted an economic analysis in two Brazilian States with different brucellosis status, Mato Grosso (with high prevalence) and Sao Paulo (with low prevalence). The economic analysis was based on the calculation of the additional benefits and costs of controlling bovine brucellosis through the vaccination of heifers aged between 3 and 8 months with S19 vaccine, considering maximal and minimal impacts of the disease. The analysis showed that vaccinating 90% of the replacement heifers aged 3-8 months of age offers the best economic performance in a vaccination program against bovine brucellosis if compared to vaccination rates of 70% and 80%. Moreover, regions with higher prevalences of bovine brucellosis would experience significant economic advantages when implementing a vaccination strategy to control the disease. This economic analysis will allow decision makers to plan more economically effective vaccination programs. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In a fish farm in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, we examined 192 oligochaetes and found that two (1%) released Aurantiactinomyxon type actinospores. We identified infected oligochaetes by morphology: both were Pristina synclites, from family Naididae. This is the first report of the involvement of this species in the life cycle of myxozoans. Small-subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of Aurantiactinomyxon type 1 (1882Â nt) and Aurantiactinomyxon type 2 (1900Â nt) did not match any previously sequenced myxozoan in the NCBI database, with the highest BLAST search similarities of 83% with Myxobolus batalhensis MF361090 and 93% with Henneguya maculosus KF296344, respectively, and the two aurantiactinomyxons were only 75% similar to each other (over ~â1900 bases). Phylogenetic analyses showed that Aurantiactinomyxon type 1 had closest affinities with myxozoans from fish hosts in Order Characiformes, and Aurantiactinomyxon type 2 had affinities with myxozoans from fish of Order Siluriformes.\n\nRelation of the activities of the IPDF/INPE project (reforestation subproject) during the year 1979.

For visual analysis, a preliminary interpretation key and a legend of 6 groups were derived. Based on these six groups, three final classes were defined for analysis: (1) area prepared for reforestation; (2) area reforested with Eucalyptus spp.; and (3) area reforested with Pinus spp. For automatic interpretation the area along the highway from Ribas do Rio Pardo to Agua Clara was classified into the following classes: eucalytus, bare soil, plowed soil, pine and \"cerrado\". The results of visual analysis show that 67% of the reforested farms have relative differences in area estimate below 5%, 22%, between 5% and 10%; and 11% between 10% and 20%. The reforested eucalyptus area is 17 times greater than the area of reforested pine. Automatic classification of eucalyptus ranged from 73.03% to 92.30% in the training areas.\n\nEpidemiological study on leishmaniasis in an area of environmental tourism and ecotourism, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, 2006-2007.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndrade, Ana Rachel Oliveira de; Nunes, VÃ¢nia LÃºcia BrandÃ£o; Galati, Eunice Aparecida Bianchi; de Arruda, Carla Cardozo Pinto; Santos, Mirella Ferreira da Cunha; Rocca, Maria Elizabeth Gizi; Aquino, Ricardo Braga\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe aims of this study were to carry out a serological survey of canine leishmaniasis and identify the phlebotomine fauna in the urban area of Bonito, Mato Grosso do Sul. The serological survey was conducted on a sample of 303 dogs, by means of the indirect immunofluorescence test. Phlebotomines were captured using automated light traps. The serological survey found that 30% of the dogs were seropositive, both from the center and from all districts of the town. A total of 2,772 specimens of phlebotomines were caught and the species most found was Lutzomyia longipalpis (90.4%), which corroborated its role as the vector of for canine visceral leishmaniasis in the region. Phlebotomines of the species Bichromomyia flaviscutellata (the main vector for Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis) and Nyssomyia whitmani (the vector for Leishmania (Viannia) brasiliensis) were also caught. The findings indicate the need for continuous epidemiological surveillance, with attention towards diminishing the vector breeding sites and the transmission of these diseases in that region.\n\nMorphological diversity of cassava accessions of the south-central mesoregion of the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nZago, B W; Barelli, M A A; Hoogerheide, E S S; CorrÃªa, C L; Delforno, G I S; da Silva, C J\n\n2017-08-17\n\nGenetic variability of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in Brazil is wide, being this the result of natural and cultural selection during pre- and post-domestication of the species in different environments. Given the number of species of the genus found in the region (38 of a total of 98 species), the central region of Brazil was defined as the primary center of cassava diversity. Therefore, genetic diversity characterization of cassava accessions is fundamental, both for farmers and for plant breeders, because it allows the organization of genetic resources and better utilization of available genetic diversity. This research aims to assess genetic divergence of cassava accessions from the south-central region of the State of Mato Grosso, based on multi-categorical morphological traits. For this purpose, 38 qualitative and quantitative morphological descriptors were used. Genetic diversity was expressed by the genetic similarity index, with subsequent clustering of accessions by the modified Tocher's procedure and UPGMA. Of 38 descriptors, only growth habit of stem showed no variability. Tocher and UPGMA methods were efficient and corroborated on group composition. Both methods were able to group accessions of different localities in distinct group consistency.\n\nInsects galls of Pantanal areas in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil: characterization and occurrence.\n\nPubMed\n\nAscendino, Sharlene; Maia, ValÃ©ria C\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTwo Pantanal areas were investigated in CorumbÃ¡, Mato Grosso do Sul. The field works were carried out in five trails, in August and December/2011 and April/2012. Seventy-six gall morphotypes were found in 52 host plants, 22 of them were identified at species level and 30 at genus. Fabaceae, Myrtaceae and Sapindaceae were the plant families with the greatest richness of gall. Leaves were the plant organ with the greatest gall richness. Six gall shapes were found - globoid, lenticular, fusiform, cylindrical, conical, and marginal roll. The three first were the most common. Five colors were observed - green, brown, red, yellow, and black. Green and brown predominated. Most were glabrous and one-chambered. These features have been indicated in several Brazilian biomes. Diptera (Cecidomyiidae) were the most frequent gallers. The associated fauna comprised parasitoids (Eulophidae, Braconidae, Eupelmidae, Eurytomidae, Platygastridae, and Pteromalidae), inquilines (Cecidomyiidae: Trotteria Kieffer, 1902, Hymenoptera: Tanaostigmoides Ashmead, 1896, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera and Thysanoptera) and predators (Pseudoscorpionida: Olpiolum medium Beier, 1931, Cecidomyiidae: Lestodiplosini and Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Parasitoids were the most frequent. Multiparatism was observed. Our data represent the first contribution to the knowledge of the associated fauna in the Pantanal.\n\nNatural infection of gastrointestinal nematodes in long-nosed armadillos Dasypus novemcinctus Linnaeus, 1758 from Pantanal wetlands, Aquidauana sub-region, Mato Grosso do Sul State, with the description of Hadrostrongylus speciosum n. gen. et n. sp.
