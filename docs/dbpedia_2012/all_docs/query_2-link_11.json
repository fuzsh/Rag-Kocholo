        "text": "Aleksandrovsk Municipal History and Literature Museum \"A.P. Chekhov and Sakhalin\" (55 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nIvan Nikolaevich Krasnov's Views of Sakhalin Island (55 items)\n\nSakhalin Island was used by imperial Russia as a penal colony and place of exile for criminals and political prisoners. Between 1869 and 1906, more than 30,000 inmates and exiles endured the difficult conditions of the forced-labor colony on the island. This collection, consisting of an album and individual photographs, is preserved in the Aleksandrovsk Municipal History and Literature Museum \"A.P. Chekhov and Sakhalin\" in Alekandrovsk-Sakhalinskiy, Sakhalin Island (off Russia’s southeast coast). The photographs were taken on the island during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and provide rare glimpses of its settlements, prisons, and inhabitants. Most of the photographs in the collection were taken by Sakhalin artist Ivan Nikolaevich Krasnov, although some are unattributed. The collection depicts public life and institutions in the town of Aleksandrovsk Post, convicts working under harsh conditions or in chains, and political prisoners. The photographs also show the daily life both of the Nivkh people, indigenous to the northern part of the island, and the Russian settler population. The predecessor of the Aleksandrovsk Municipal History and Literature Museum \"A.P. Chekhov and Sakhalin\" appears in some of the photographs. The name of the museum refers to a trip taken to Sakhalin Island by the Russian writer and medical doctor Anton Chekhov in 1890, during which Chekhov researched the plight of island’s prisoners and native populations. The publication of his Sakhalin Island in 1895 highlighted the depravity of the situation in this remote corner of Russia and led to public protests that helped bring about the closure of the penal colony.\n\nView the collection\n\nAltai State Regional Studies Museum (221 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nPhotographs by the Topographer G. I. Ivanov, Gornaia Shoria, 1913 (109 items)\n\nThis collection consists of 109 photographs taken by G. I. Ivanov (1876-192?) during a 1913 topographic expedition to the Gornaia Shoria in the Altai region. That same year, Ivanov participated in another topographic expedition--to the Mrasskii region, Kuznetskii District (central part of the Gornaia Shoria). The photographs reflect both expedition activities and the life of the people in this region. The negatives were transferred to the Altai State Museum of Regional History and Folklife in the 1920s; prints were made and sets from both expeditions were added to the museum’s collections.\n\nView the collection\n\nSergei Ivanovich Borisov's Color Photo-Cards of the Altai Mountains (52 items)\n\nA collection of color postcards made from negatives taken by photographer Sergei Ivanovich Borisov (1859–1935) in the Altay, or Altai, Mountains region of southern Siberia early in the 20th century. Borisov was born into a family of serfs in Simbirsk (present-day Ulyanovsk) and was forced to work from an early age. In the late 1880s he moved to the city of Barnaul in Altayskiy Kray, where in 1894 he opened a photography studio. This studio later became the largest and most popular in the city. In 1907, Borisov began his expedition in the Altay Mountains, which lasted until 1911. He took around 1,500 photographs during this expedition, which, upon his return to Barnaul, he presented to the public through the use of a magic lantern. The photographs depict views of nature in remote corners of the Altay Mountains and the Altay and Kazakh peoples indigenous to this region. Borisov offered the photographs to various European publishers for the production of postcards. The collection includes two series of color postcards. The first series was issued by the Swedish printing company Granberg Society in Stockholm, but it is not known where the second series was published.\n\nView the collection\n\nV.V. Sapozhnikov. Photo Materials from Expeditions in the Southern Altai Region, 1895-1899 (60 items)\n\nA collection of 60 photos by V.V. Sapozhnikov (1861‒1924), a geographer, botanist, ethnographer, and professor at Tomsk State University (the first institution of higher education established in Siberia), who made significant contributions to the study of the South Siberian region. The photographs were taken by Sapozhnikov during his expeditions to the Altai Mountains in 1895‒99 and later reproduced from his negatives for the Altai State Regional Studies Museum in Barnaul. The explorer gave his photograph collection and related materials from his expeditions to the museum in 1904. Each photograph is accompanied by an annotation with a geographic reference written by Sapozhnikov. The collection is unique for its complex and spectacular views, covering a variety of geographic features of the South Siberian region. In many of the photos, Sapozhnikov or other members of the expeditions are shown, struggling with difficult terrain and swollen rivers. Sapozhnikov's scientific activity was closely connected with the Russian Geographical Society, to which he was elected in 1898.\n\nView the collection\n\nAmur Oblast Museum of Regional History and Folklife (101 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nInvestigations of the Zeya River in 1907-1909 (101 items)\n\nIzyskaniia reki Zei v 1907-1909 gg. (Investigations of the Zeya River in 1907-1909) is a unique integrated collection of documentary photographs that presents a vivid picture of the state of the Amur region up to 1909. The album was prepared in 1909‒10 by the mechanical engineer Vladimir I. Fedorov (1876‒1956) on the instructions of the waterways administration of the Amur basin. Its 100 photographs show natural scenes, indigenous peoples, settlers, river transport, and Russian surveyors at work. The photographs are captioned. The Zeya River is one of the most important tributaries of the Amur River. It rises in the Stanovoy range in the Russian Far East and runs southward and slightly to the west for 1,242 kilometers before joining the Amur near Blagoveshchensk.\n\nView the collection\n\nBerdsk Historical Art Museum (153 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nBerdsk in Siberia During the 19th and 20th Centuries (153 items)\n\nA collection of 153 photographs and documents held in the Berdsk Historical Art Museum, drawn from the personal archives of people who lived in the town of Berdsk in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The collection offers glimpses into everyday life, the atmosphere, and the activities in Berdsk, a major center of grain processing at that time. The photographs show groups of students and teachers, local mills, people at work in agriculture and industry, soldiers, and children and youth. Most appear to date from the early Soviet era. The documents include tickets, ration cards, membership cards, and other items relating to farming, trade, crafts, mining, and so forth. Berdsk is located in Novosibirsk Oblast in central Russia, along the Novosibirsk Reservoir just south of Novosibirsk city. Founded at the beginning of the 18th century as a fortress, it became a city in 1944.\n\nView the collection\n\nCenter for Documentation of Tomsk Oblast Recent History (101 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nTomsk Regional Committee Documents Regarding Deported Baltic Peoples (101 items)\n\nA collection of 101 documents from the archives of the Tomsk Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union relating to the mass deportation to Siberia of Baltic peoples from Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The documents, which date from the period 1941–60, are nearly all stamped \"Secret.\" They shed light on such aspects of the deportations as the numbers of people involved, how the reception of deported peoples was organized, the resettlement and placement of deportees, material support, methods of ideological control and the assessment of the communist authorities of the ideological and political influences on the deportees, and the eventual lifting of legal restrictions on these population groups. The Soviet Union invaded the Baltic countries in the summer of 1940 and the deportations of Baltic peoples were carried out the following year, just before the Germany invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. Estimates of the numbers of deported citizens of the Baltic countries vary, but probably about 50,000 were sent to camps in Siberia in this period. The deportations were aimed out eliminating resistance to communist rule and targeted the political and intellectual elites in the Baltic countries. Deportations were halted following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, but a second mass deportation of Baltic peoples to Siberia occurred after World War II, in March 1949, as the authorities sought to stamp out continued resistance to Soviet rule.\n\nView the collection\n\nIgarka Museum of Permafrost (82 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nDead Road: Construction Project 503 (82 items)\n\nA collection of materials related to the Salekhard‒Igarka Railway, an unfinished Soviet railroad sometimes called the “Dead Road.” This railroad was intended to unite European Russia with the northern regions of Siberia and to facilitate the export of minerals from the industrial city of Noril’sk. Construction began in 1949 but was abandoned in 1953 after Stalin’s death. Stalin had ordered the construction of the railroad without heeding the advice of specialists, who knew that a railroad built on permafrost would be difficult to maintain. Stalin considered the railroad strategically necessary to facilitate the defense of Russia’s northern coast; however, actual demand for the railway was low. Construction was divided into two projects, number 501 and number 503, and was carried out by prisoners of the infamous gulag system. According to eyewitness accounts, conditions in the camps of these projects and in Yermakovo, the central settlement of construction project 503, were better than in most parts of the gulag system. This collection consists of photographs, documents, maps, letters, and memoirs housed in the Igarka Museum of Permafrost. Photographs depict daily life in Yermakovo, a settlement near Igarka, abandoned buildings and railroad equipment, and musicians and actors of the projects’ cultural and educational divisions. Many of the photographs were taken by Walter Ruge (1915–2011) and depict his wife Irina Andreevna Alferova. Ruge completed a ten-year sentence as a political prisoner in 1951 before he was released to live as an exile in Yermakovo, where he met Alferova, a fellow exile. The collection’s documents and maps provide information about the planning and construction of the railroad and the administration of the camps, while the memoirs and letters describe the experiences of prisoners, exiles, and civilian residents of Yermakovo and the camps.\n\nView the collection\n\nInstitute for the Study of Buddhism, Mongol, and Tibetan Culture of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (95 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nAlbazinskii Prison. Materials of Archaeological Research (95 items)\n\nA collection of 95 drawings, color photographs, and slides documenting the results of the archaeological excavations at the fortress of Albazin, the first Russian settlement on the Amur River (at the present-day village of Albazino in the Amurskaya Oblast). The Russians established the fort at Albazin in 1651, and it soon became the largest fortified settlement of Russian pioneers in the Amur region. In 1686, after a long siege by Manchu troops, Russian Cossack troops surrendered the fortress. Under the terms of the Treaty of Nerchinsk, concluded in 1689 to establish peace between Russia and China, the fortress was demolished and the territory around it transferred to China. The photographs, slides, and drawings in the collection show views of the remains of the towers, walls, residential buildings, and household items discovered during the excavations. They offer insight into the economic activities, construction methods, and armament of the Russian soldiers and settlers of the 16th century.\n\nView the collection\n\nInstitute of History of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (405 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nPhotographs from Archeographic Expeditions to the Schismatic Monasteries on the Upper Malyi Enisei River (Tuva, 1966-75) (43 items)\n\nThe schismatic monasteries along the headwaters of the Little Yenisey River came into being in February 1917, when one of the splinter groups of the well-known monastery of Father Nifont moved to the Tuva (or Tyva) area, near the Mongolian-Russian border, from the Ural region. The Tuva copy of the Genealogy of the Schismatic Sect, composed by Father Nifont between 1887 and 1890, contains an appendix by Father Palladii, the head of monasteries in Tuva, laying out this succession of 20th-century monastic fathers-superior in Tuva: Nifont, Sergii, Ignatii and Palladii. Father Ignatii died in prison before World War II; shortly thereafter, Father Palladii’s brother committed suicide while under arrest by jumping into the frigid rapids of the Little Yenisey. Father Palladii was arrested three times, but he was able to escape (from exile in Krasnoyarsk and then from the camp near Vladivostok where the poet Osip Mandel’shtam is known to have perished). Toward the end of his life, Father Palladii was director of the Tuva monasteries, having gained the consent of the authorities to assume this position by promising that he no longer would object to military service for Old Believers. Father Palladii was a skilled transcriber and binder of manuscripts and early printed books who owned a large library of these materials. In 1966 he acquainted Novosibirsk archeographers with previously unknown and unstudied literary works composed in the Urals and Siberia from the 17th to the 20th centuries by Old Believer schismatic writers. The residents of these monasteries refuse to be photographed. They explain this refusal in the following way: upon christening, a person acquires an invisible aura around the head and, after death, this aura serves as a pass into heaven; the aura is diminished each time the person sins, and it is further weakened by photography. Outside monasteries, however, this prohibition is not enforced nearly as strictly, even in the families of spiritual teachers.\n\nView the collection\n\nPhotographs from Archeological Expeditions to Old Believer Monasteries (Rudnyi Altai, Headwaters of the Uba River, 1970-71) (42 items)\n\nThe monasteries of the Pomorskie Sect of Old Believers, visited by archeographers from Novosibirsk, were the successors to the Pokrovskii women’s monastery built there at the very beginning of the twentieth century with the financial support of Savva Morozov, a well-known textile mill owner who belonged to the Pomorskie Sect. (During this same period he was also financing underground Bolshevik-Leninist organizations.) Old photographs of the nuns at this monastery have been preserved.This monastery traditionally maintained close religious and economic ties with the local peasantry and the wealthy farming families of Old Believers in the Altai. The prosperous Altai peasantry offered stiff resistance (including armed resistance) to Soviet rule and the policy of “war communism” and collectivization. The harsh repression of this resistance took a toll on the Altai Old Believer communities and their book collections. For example, on the northern slopes of the Altai, in Uimon Valley, and on the Koksa River, where the richest Old Believer farms were devastated, a large collection of manuscripts and early printed books also was destroyed. A few miraculously spared sixteenth-century volumes were among the most valuable discoveries of the expeditions by the specialists from the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. When Siberian archeographers began travelling to the Altai Old Believer communities in the late 1960s and early 1970s, they found that the former prosperity was long gone, and the other valleys that had flourished before 1917 had become nearly depopulated. This was an ideal location for the secretive settlements of hermits, many of whom had once been nuns of the Pokrovskii monastery, while others had come from all parts of the country, e.g., Kuban’, which had maintained intensive correspondence with the Pomorskie Sect.In their way of life, the adherents of the Pomorskie Sect in Altai were less closed than, for example, the Tuva schismatics. Many of the monastery residents were quite willing to be photographed. The photograph taken of the superior of the main monastery, Mother Afanasiia, was placed alongside the icons in the chapel after her death.\n\nView the collection\n\nPhotographs from the Trial of the Dubches Hermits (6 items)\n\nA collection documenting the trial in the early 1950s of the Dubches hermits. The hermits were associated with Old Believer monasteries persecuted by the communist authorities in what was then the Soviet Union. In 1937‒40 these monasteries were secretly relocated from the Ural Mountains to the left bank of the Lower Yenisey River and the Dubches River and its tributaries. Playing a large role in this effort was the men’s monastery of Father Simeon, whose writings traced the history of the monastery beginning in the 18th century, when it was led by the famed Hegumen (father superior) Maksim, the author of numerous polemic works. Along with the monastery of Father Simeon, nuns from the Permskii convent (on the Sylva River) and Sungul’skii convent (near the city of Kasli, Southern Urals) also relocated to the Dubches region. This secret move took several years. At the new site, the taiga (coniferous evergreen forests) was cleared for buildings and vegetable gardens. Several families of peasant adherents who migrated with the monasteries helped to erect a chapel, along with a building to house a rich collection of old books (more than 500 volumes, including a parchment manuscript and some 16th-century printed books). In 1951 the monasteries were spotted from the air by the Soviet authorities and subsequently demolished by a punitive detachment. The hermits associated with the monasteries and the peasants who had supported them were arrested, and all the buildings, icons, and books were burned. The Krasnoyarsk Office of the Ministry of State Security conducted an investigation and put 33 persons on trial. All those indicted were convicted under Articles 58-10 part 2 and 58-11 of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic criminal code and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 10 to 25 years. Alexandr Isaevich Solzhenitsyn wrote about these events in his classic Gulag Archipelago. Two of those arrested perished in Soviet concentration camps: Father Simeon and Mother Margarita. After the death in 1953 of the dictator Joseph Stalin, the others were granted amnesty on November 12, 1954.\n\nView the collection\n\nSpecial Settlers in West Siberia in the 1930s (311 items)\n\nThe commemorative album “Soviet Narym: Opening of the West-Siberian North by Labor Settlers, 1930-36” contains statistical, narrative, cartographic, and illustrated materials relating to the people who were forcibly settled in the Narym region by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s. The album, compiled in 1936 by the secret police of West Siberia as the result of a government investigation, sought to document for Moscow the opening of the Narym region by labor settlers. Housed for a time in police archives, the album later fell into private hands during a “purge” of these archives, but since 2002 has been in the custody of the Sector on the History of Sociocultural Development, Institute of History, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nView the collection\n\nIrkutsk Municipal History Museum (572 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nMaterials from the Ethnographic Expedition of P.P. Khoroshikh in 1927 (257 items)\n\nPresented here is an album of 167 photographs and 89 drawings made during the 1927 expedition in the Balagansk District of the Irkutsk region by the famous Siberian ethnographer and archaeologist Pavel Khoroshikh and local history specialist Petr Trebukhovskii. The materials in the album detail the different aspects of the economic activities of the Russian and Buriat population, types of houses and farm buildings, tools and daily activities, and various aspects of children's upbringing. Together, these illustrations are the richest source of material for studying the life of the peasant population of the region before the kholkhoz (collective farm) period of the Soviet era; forced collectivization began in 1928. The Balagansk District is located in the south-central part of Irkutsk Oblast, on the left bank of the Angara River. It was settled by Russians from 1655 onward, and has long been inhabited by the Bulagat, a Buriat tribe whose name derives from the Buriat word for sable hunter.\n\nView the collection\n\nPhotography in Irkutsk (136 items)\n\nThis collection contains 136 photographs of Irkutsk from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The album belonged to Isaiah Aronovich Shinkman, a physician and member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, who was incarcerated at Akatuy from 1906 to 1911. The prison was located at the Akatuy silver mine in Nerchinsk okrug (district) in the Transbaikal Territory of Siberia. Thousands of political prisoners were exiled to Siberia from European Russia and from Poland, Finland, Latvia, and Estonia (all then part of the Russian Empire) following the repression of the Russian Revolution of 1905. Criminal labor convicts and political prisoners had long been sent to Nerchinsk to work in extracting lead-silver ores in the region’s mines. The American explorer and journalist George Kennan (1845–1924) visited Akatuy in 1885, and wrote about his experience in his book Siberia and the Exile System (1891), a scathing critique of the system of prisons and prison camps in Russia. The album is held by the Irkutsk State University in Irkutsk and was digitized for the Meeting of Frontiers digital library project in the early 2000s. The photographs it contains offer glimpses into the day-to-day existence and activities of the political prisoners in Siberia in the years before World War I and the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nView the collection\n\nViews of the Trans-Baikal and Irkutsk, a Photo Album by N.

It was organized by American workers, who took on the obligation of inviting from the United States and Western Europe some eight thousand skilled workers and specialists to industrialize the Kuzbass. The Soviet government turned over to the colonists a number of Kemerovo mine shafts and an unfinished coking plant. To recruit volunteers to work in Siberia, a “Kuzbass Bureau” was opened in the middle of New York City, and an information bulletin began to be published in the United States. Between January 1922 and December 1923, however, only 566 persons arrived for work in the Kuzbass. The colonists included emigrants from America, Canada, the Netherlands, France, Australia, Jamaica, Indonesia, and other countries as well.\n\nView the collection\n\nKrasnoiarsk Krai Museum of Regional History and Folklife (501 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nEveryday Life of Yenisei Province, Late Nineteenth-Early Twentieth Centuries\n\nThis collection includes more than four hundred photographs of daily life in Yenisei Province in the late tsarist period.

The letters were written from places of hard labor and settlements in Siberia and are addressed to Iakov Dmitrievich Kazimirskii, a manager at the Petrovskii Factory. The writers include I.I. Pushchin, V.L. Davydov, A.I. Iakubovich, A.Z. Muraviev, N.A. Bestuzhev, V.V. Vadkovskii, A.P and M.K Iushnevskii, I.S. Povalo-Shveikovskii, E.I. Trubetskaia, S.G. Volkonskii, I.I. Gorbachevskii, M.F. Mit’kov, and E.P. Obolensky. The Decembrists were a group of Russian revolutionaries who led an unsuccessful uprising against tsarist authority in December 1825. They were primarily members of the upper classes with military backgrounds. After the suppression of the uprising, 289 Decembrists were put on trial. Five–the leaders –were executed; 31 were imprisoned; and the rest exiled to Siberia. Many wives of the Decembrists accompanied their husbands into banishment in Siberia. The collection is held in the Krasnoyarskskiy Krai Museum of Regional History and Folklife. The letters came to the museum in the 1930s from the Krasnoyarsk Regional Library as part of a collection of documents assembled by the famous bibliophile-merchant Gennadii Vasil’evich Iudin. Most of the letters were published in the book Sibirskie pis’ma dekabristov: 1838-1850 (Siberian letters of the Decembrists: 1838-1850), compiled by T.S. Komarova and published by the Krasnoyarsk Book Publishing House in 1987.\n\nView the collection\n\nM. N.

Kolyma is a northeastern region that takes its name from the Kolyma River and includes parts of the present-day Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and present-day Magadan Oblast. This region contained deposits of gold and platinum and was home to Sevvostlag (Northeastern Corrective Labor Camps), one of the Soviet Union’s most infamous labor camp systems, which was administered by a government agency known as Dalstroy (Far North Construction Trust). These materials were collected by the Yagodnoye District public historical and educational organization “Search for the Unlawfully Repressed.” This organization was founded in 1990 with the goal of locating former prisoners of the Kolyma camps. It corresponds with more than 500 former prisoners and their relatives, publishes prisoners’ memoirs, conducts local history research, and carries out expeditions to the remains of camps. The materials collected by Search for the Unlawfully Repressed became the basis for the collections of the Memory of Kolyma Museum, where this collection is housed. The collection’s photographs depict ruins of camp buildings, daily life in Kolyma, and journalists traveling in the region. Other materials of the collection include a map of Kolyma’s camps, newspapers from the region, certificates, letters, records of criminal cases, and personal files.\n\nView the collection\n\nMuseum of the History of the Norilsk Industrial Region (212 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nThe Last Archipelago: Investigation of Severnaya Zemlya in 1930-1932 (212 items)\n\nA collection of materials, including manuscripts, photographs, and a photograph album, from the N.N. Urantsev Foundation devoted to the last major geographical discovery on earth: the exploration of Severnaya Zemlya in the expedition of 1930‒32 expedition under the leadership of G.A. Ushakov (1901‒63) and N.N. Urvantsev (1893‒1985). The manuscripts and photographs offer new and previously unknown information about the harsh conditions and limited plant and animal life of Severnaya Zemlya and document the history of the expedition. As characterized by N.N. Urvantsev, this was the last polar expedition of the Nansen-Amundsen era, in which success was achieved through human endurance and perseverance in pursuing a goal using a minimum of technical and material resources. Severnaya Zemlya (meaning “northern land” in Russian) is an archipelago of four large and many smaller islands located in the Arctic Ocean, immediately north of Cape Chelyuskin, the most northerly point in Siberia. Much of the territory is covered by ice and snow. The archipelago was first discovered only in 1913 and was not explored until the two-year Ushakov-Urvantsev expedition mapped and surveyed the territory.\n\nView the collection\n\nNational Research Tomsk State University (101 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nDrawings and Paintings by Pavel Mikhailovich Kosharov (143 items)\n\nThe Research Library of Tomsk State University and the Tomsk Oblast Museum of Regional History and Folk Life hold a collection of about 150 works by the famous Siberian artist, teacher, and public educator Pavel Mikhailovich Kosharov (1824–1902).

Along the way he created a series of drawings and watercolors of the people and places he encountered. Best known as a portraitist, Smirnov focused on the faces of the men and women he met, who included exiles, prisoners, settlers from Ukraine and western Russia, local military and civilian officials, peasants and merchants. His works from this period also include a handful of drawings of houses and landscapes. The sketches were made in the Ural Mountains, Irkutsk, Omsk, Krasnoyarsk, and in villages along the route. The details of Smirnov’s journey are sketchy. Some accounts say that he traveled along the Great Siberian Road as a volunteer on the way to the front in the Russo-Japanese War. Other accounts say that he was an exile, possibly sent to Siberia for refusing to be conscripted into the army. The Great Siberian Road, depicted in several of Smirnov’s drawings, was the route from Moscow to China via Siberia. Smirnov’s collection of 99 graphic items is preserved in the Novosibirsk State Museum of Regional History and Folklife. The collection was acquired by the museum from the artist in 1950.\n\nView the collection\n\nEthnographic Artists' Sketches from the 1920s and 1930s (96 items)\n\nThe graphics collection of the Novosibirsk State Museum of Regional History and Folklife includes the works of such famous Siberian painters as Dmitrii Inokent’evich Karatanov, Natal’ia Nikolaevna Nagorskaia, Aleksei Vasil’evich Voshchakin, and Grigorii Gustavovich Likman.

The albums date from 1906–8 and 1909. The Russian state paid for the construction of roads, such as those depicted in the albums in order to connect settlers with a railroad line, a navigable river, or commercial-industrial centers. The overall purpose of the road-building program was to promote the colonization of the taiga (moist coniferous forest regions) of Siberia. The albums show the construction of roads in the region between the main line of the Trans-Siberian Railroad and the Chet’ and Kandat Rivers in Tomsk gubernia (governorate), a distance of 170 versts (about 182 kilometers).\n\nView the collection\n\nOmsk State Museum of Regional History and Folklife (371 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nThe First Western Siberian Agricultural, Forestry, and Commerical-Industrial Exhibition in Omsk, 1911 (157 items)\n\nA collection of photographs documenting the First West Siberian Agricultural, Forestry, and Industrial Trade Exhibition, which took place in Omsk in 1911. The exhibition was held from June 15 to August 1 of that year, and was a significant event in the life of the Siberian region. Nothing on this scale or this level of ambition had ever been staged in Siberia. The collection includes photographs of the exhibition organizers, general views, and images of pavilions, exhibits, prize-winning livestock, crowds at a musical event, and even an aviator and his airplane.

These albums were created for and exhibited at the First West Siberian Agricultural, Forestry, and Commercial-Industrial Exhibition in Omsk in 1911. The albums were part of a collection of photographs assembled between 1891 and 1918 by the museum of the West Siberian Branch of the Imperial Russian Geographic Society in Omsk. The photographs in the albums were taken in 1909 by N.G. Katanaev (son of Colonel G.E. Katanaev) during a journey to Cossack settlements in Stepnoi krai (later the oblasts of Ural’sk, Turgai, Akmola, and Semipalatinsk). The Cossacks began serving in garrisons in fortified Siberian towns from the late 16th century onward. In 1808 the Cossacks in these outposts were organized as the Siberian Cossack Host, a military force of mainly cavalry regiments that subsequently took part in the Russian conquest of Central Asia as well as in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‒5 and in World War I. Omsk was the administrative center for the host, which was headed by an ataman appointed by the tsarist authorities. The host was abolished by the Soviet authorities in 1920.\n\nView the collection\n\nPhototext Foundation (196 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nMaterials of the Ethno-Photo Expedition: People on the Frontier (196 items)\n\nThis collection contains photographs from the international photographic expedition, “People on the Frontier,” to the Saian-Altai region from June 12 to July 4, 2002.

The Russian Far East encompasses a large geographical area that borders the Pacific Ocean and stretches from the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the northeast to Primorsky Krai in the southeast, along the borders with China and North Korea. The collection includes several photographs by the famed researcher and photographer Vitalii Aleksandrovich Nikolaenko (1938–2003), who spent more than 30 years observing and studying the brown bears of the Kamchatka Peninsula and was eventually killed by a bear while carrying out his work. Also included are photographs of Sakhalin Island by Moscow-based photographer Aleksandr Vladimirovich Sorin, of Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands by Aleksandr Mikhailovich Bermant, of Primorsky Krai by Vladimir Mikhailovich Kobzar’, and of Kamchatka by Irina Vladimirovna Stakhanova. The photographs depict the varied natural landscapes of the Russian Far East, including the geysers and volcanoes of Kamchatka and the coastlines of Russia’s Pacific islands. The collection also captures the work of the region’s fishermen, daily life and recreation in its settlements, and its wildlife, including Kamchatka bears and Amur tigers. The collection was gathered for the Meeting of Frontiers digital library project in the early 2000s.\n\nView the collection\n\nTimeless Chukotka (82 items)\n\nThis collection entitled “Timeless Chukotka,” which was created by Moscow photographer Aleksandr Vladimirovich Sorin (born 1965) and Novosibirsk journalist Artem Gotlib. In June and July of 2003, Sorin and Gotlib undertook an expedition to the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, the most northeasterly region of the Russian Federation. Chukotka is characterized by a low population density, an untouched and mostly mountainous natural landscape, and a harsh Arctic climate. About half of the region’s territory lies north of the Arctic Circle. Transportation by airplane is more efficient and more widespread than travel on the region’s few roads. Sorin and Gotlib initially planned to travel by barge along the Anadyr’ River, but the complications of transportation in Chukotka led them to alter their plans. Their eventual route took them from Anadyr’, the administrative center of the region, to the tundra settlement of Ust’-Belaya, and on to the settlements of Bukhta Provideniya, Sireniki, and Novoye Chaplino on the shores of the Bering Sea. Sorin and Gotlib concluded that conventional concepts of time and punctuality have little meaning in Chukotka, which explains the word “timeless” that they used in naming their collection. The photographs depict the daily lives of the people of Chukotka, as well as its settlements, coastlines, and natural landscapes. The collection was gathered for the Meeting of Frontiers digital library project in the early 2000s.\n\nView the collection\n\nState Archives of Novosibirsk Oblast (130 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nConstruction and Views of the Circumbaikal Railroad. 1900-1904 (58 items)\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Russia underwent a period of extensive rail development that culminated in the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Akin to the great railroads to the Pacific in both the United States and Canada, Russia's transcontinental line was intended to supply and populate Siberia as well as deliver raw materials to the rapidly developing industries west of the Urals. Working against an ambitious timetable and under severe conditions of climate and terrain, the Russians effectively united the European and Asian parts of the empire by completing this herculean project. The engineering plans provided for the sequential construction of six basic segments. The fourth of these was the Circum-Baikal Railroad from Irkutsk to the eastern side of Lake Baikal.

I. Surikov Museum of Art in Krasnoiarsk (321 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nWorks of D. I. Karatanov, A. G. Vargin, and A. P. Lekarenko from their Expeditions to Siberia (321 items)\n\nThis collection presents sketches, drawings, watercolors, and paintings by three well-known Krasnoiarsk artists, Dmitri Innokent’evich Karatanov, A. G. Vargin, and Andrei Prokofievich Lekarenko, produced during their expeditions to Siberia in the 1910s and 1920s. These works are located at two institutions: V. I. Surikov Museum of Art in Krasnoiarsk and Krasnoiarsk Krai Museum of Regional History and Folklife. Karatanov (1872-1952) studied at the St. Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts but left the Academy in 1896 before finishing his course of study to return to Krasnoiarsk. He began teaching at the High School of Arts in Krasnoiarsk in 1910; many well-known local artists studied under him. The main theme of his work was the Siberian landscape. He was named an “Honored Artist of the RSFSR (Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic)” in 1948. Very little is known about Vargin. The 110 drawings that he made during his trip to Siberia with A. A. Savel’ev are his only surviving works. Lekarenko (1895-1974) studied under Karatanov and V. A. Favorskii, and was one of the founders of the local artists union “New Siberia.” He also taught at the High School of the Arts in Krasnoiarsk as well as at the Surikov Academy of Arts in that city. In 1967 Lekarenko was awarded the “Order of Honor” and named “Honored Artist of the RSFSR” for his dedication to educational work.\n\nView the collection\n\nV.A.

Charushin (1851–1937) and by N. Petrov. Charushin began serving a hard labor sentence in the Transbaikal Territory in 1878. The materials in the collection illustrate aspects of Transbaikal history in this period, with a particular emphasis on the tea trade with China, which at that time was one of the main branches of the economy of the region. The photographs show various technological processes of growing and preparing tea, sections of trade routes, as well as views of China, Mongolia, Buryatia, and various towns and villages of Transbaikal, as well as images of local people of different ethnicities and nationalities. Several of the photographs, including one of the large and imposing Russian consulate, were taken in Urga, at that time the capital of Outer Mongolia (and known today as Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia).\n\nView the collection\n\nV.K. Arseniev Primorsky Regional Unified Museum (267 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nPhoto Archive of Geologist Mikhail Alekseevich Pavlov (125 items)\n\nA collection from the family archive of prominent geologist Mikhail Alekseevich Pavlov (1884–1938). Pavlov was born near Ekaterinburg and completed his schooling at the Nikolai Gymnasium in Tsarskoe Selo (present-day Pushkin) in 1905. He went on to study geology at Saint Petersburg University and participated in many field expeditions. While still a student, Pavlov took part in the attempted expedition to the North Pole in 1912‒14, which was led by the Arctic explorer Georgii Iakovlevich Sedov (1877–1914). Along with his school and university friend Vladimir Iul’evich Vize (1886–1954), who served as the expedition’s geographer, Pavlov collected a large body of scientific data on the northern archipelago of Novaya Zemlya. After finishing his education, Pavlov worked as a geologist and teacher of geology. He devoted most of his career to the geology of the Far East, working as an employee of the Far East Geological Committee (Dal’geolkom) in 1919–31. Pavlov was arrested in 1931 and in 1938 was executed after exhaustion prevented him from reporting for work in the labor camp where he was a prisoner. Such a fate was typical for representatives of the Russian intelligentsia in Stalinist Russia. Many photographs in this collection were taken by Pavlov himself, while others are unattributed. The photographs date from approximately 1875–1929. They depict Pavlov’s geological expeditions in Siberia and the Far East, expedition participants, views of nature, Pavlov during his school and university years, and his family members in various years.\n\nView the collection\n\nPhotographs of Georgii Iakovlevich Sedov's Expedition to the North Pole (59 items)\n\nSenior Lieutenant Georgii Iakovlevich Sedov (1877–1914) was a hydrographer and surveyor who devoted much of his career to exploration of the Northern Sea Route north of Siberia. The son of a poor fisherman, Sedov succeeded in becoming an officer of the Imperial Russian Navy, an unprecedented achievement for someone of his modest origins. This collection, consisting of an album and individual photographs from the family archive of geologist Mikhail Alekseevich Pavlov (1884–1938), depicts the expedition undertaken by Sedov in the years 1912–14. The members of the expedition departed from Arkhangelsk in August of 1912 on the sailing vessel Saint Martyr Foka, intending to travel to Zemlya Frantsa Iosifa, from where they would attempt to reach the North Pole by dog sled. The expedition relied on private means, which contributed to the shortages of fuel and food that led to its failure. Sedov, whose health was already failing when he set out for the pole by sled in early 1914, died before reaching his objective. The members of the expedition nonetheless carried out extensive surveying and scientific observations while wintering on Novaya Zemlya in 1912–13 and made significant contributions to knowledge of northern geography. Many photographs in the collection were taken by Nikolaj Vasil’evich Pinegin (1883–1940), the artist and photographer of the expedition. Other photographs are attributed to Pavlov, the expedition’s geologist, who over the course of his career conducted a great deal of geological research in Siberia and the Russian Far East. The photographs show the expedition’s departure from Arkhangelsk, the members of the expedition on the Saint Martyr Foka, the harsh conditions endured by the expedition in winter, and views of the Arctic.\n\nView the collection\n\nThe Family of Yul Brynner Photo Album (83 items)\n\nA collection of 82 photos from the archive of Yul Brynner (1920–85), the famous Hollywood actor, Academy Award winner, and Vladivostok native, preserved in the V.K. Arseniev Primorsky Regional Unified Museum in Vladivostok. Yul Brynner, whose real name was Iulii Borisovich Briner, was the grandson of the Vladivostok businessman and public figure of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries Iulii Ivanovich Briner (1849–1920), the owner of the lead and zinc mines in Tetiukh (present-day Dalnegorsk) and the shipping company and ship-repair shops in Vladivostok. Iulii Ivanovich had six children: Leonid, Boris, Felix, Margarita, Maria, and Nina. Boris Iul’evich (1889–1949), the father of the future Oscar-winner Yul Brynner, continued his father's business. Most of the Briner family emigrated from Primor’e (the Primorskiy region) in 1931 and lived subsequently in China, France, and the United States. The collection dates from 1923 and the photographs, from different years, depict Yul Brynner himself and his numerous relatives.\n\nView the collection\n\nYakutsk State Museum of the History and Culture of Northern Peoples (123 items)\n\nView all items from this institution\n\nYakut Material Culture in Ethnographic Sketches of the 1920s-1940s (123 items)\n\nA collection of ethnographic sketches created in the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic during the 1930s–1940s. The Yakut ASSR—informally referred to as Yakutia and known today as the Sakha Republic—covered a large region in eastern Siberia. It is the historical home of the Yakut (Sakha) people, a Turkic people who arrived in the region around the 13th century and still make up almost half of its population. This collection of sketches was created by Ivan Vasil’evich Popov (1874‒1945), an artist and teacher who was born near Yakutsk and received his education in Yakutsk and Saint Petersburg. Popov was born into a family of priests who had been among the first to give sermons in the Yakut language and had taken part in the writing of a Yakut dictionary. Accordingly, some of his first works of art were icons that he painted as a seminary student. Although Popov had to work as a teacher throughout his adult life, unable to support his family through his artistic activities alone, he made a significant contribution to the documentation of Yakut material culture. In addition to recording Yakut culture in his drawings and paintings, Popov documented Yakut life in photographs and contributed to the recording of oral history and folklore. This collection of Popov’s drawings depicts Yakut material culture of the 17th‒20th centuries. Featured items include furniture, interiors and exteriors of dwellings, grave monuments, hats, footwear, tools, and hunting equipment."
