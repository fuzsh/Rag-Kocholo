I hope to see more such projects in the future and will keep directing students to SRAS programs!\n\nJulia ChadagaVisiting Assistant ProfessorMacalester College\n\nAt Stetson, we’ve used SRAS to arrange all of our student study abroad trips for the past five or six years. During that time we’ve sent dozens of students on summer- and semester-long programs in Moscow, St Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Irkutsk. In every interaction I’ve had with them, SRAS has been prompt, reliable, knowledgable, courteous and quick to lend a hand when needed.\n\nDr. Michael A.
