In the Kemerovo and Sverdlovsk regions, it grew by more than 10% over the year.\n\nPhoto: Viktor Bartenev / Interpress / TASS\n\nBased on the statistics provided by regional statistics services, RBC calculated which Federation subjects became the leaders in 2018 in the number of deaths from HIV. Officially, Rosstat and the Ministry of Health do not disclose this data yet.\n\nThe leader in mortality from human immunodeficiency virus has become the Kemerovo Region. A total of 38,200 people died there in 2018, of which 1,750 died from HIV, RBC was told at the territorial office of the Federal Service for State Statistics in the Kemerovo Region.\n\nThe death rate from HIV is 65.1 cases per 100 thousand inhabitants of the region – this is more than from all alcohol poisoning, suicides, murders, drowning and accidents combined. For comparison, according to WHO data for 2017, in Zimbabwe and South Africa – the countries with the highest mortality from the virus – this figure was 133 and 190 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants, respectively."
