        "text": "THE PRINCESS OF SIBERIA\n\nThe Story of Maria Volkonsky and the Decembrist Exiles. By Christine Sutherland. Illustrated. 340 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $17.95.\n\nALTHOUGH the 19th century demanded female selflessness, it rarely found examples of self- sacrifice to match that of the women who left Russia to follow their men to Siberia. Dostoyevsky paid homage in fiction to Sonya's devotion to Raskolnikov, a thief and ax-murderer. But how much greater was the prestige of those innocent women who suffered for the criminals, when the crime was the pursuit of liberty, equality, fraternity.\n\nAmong the most famous female martyrs in Russia were the heroic wives (and occasionally lovers) of the Decembrists, named for an abortive military revolt of December 1825. Czar Nicholas I was threatened less by this poorly organized mutiny than by the secret discussion groups from which it sprang (schemes for freeing the serfs and introducing parliamentary democracy were intolerable to the new absolute monarch). With the severity that became his dubious hallmark, he sentenced 120 idealistic young men to death or hard labor, exile and the loss of property and titles. Reluctantly, he eventually allowed their wives to join them in frigid climes, provided they too gave up their positions in Russian society.\n\nOne of the first to leave St. Petersburg was an attractive young noblewoman whose husband had never told her about his liberal friends and their dangerous conversations. When her father, Gen. Nicholas Raevsky, a hero of the war against Napoleon, had asked his daughter Maria in the autumn of 1824 to wed Sergei Volkonsky, a fellow military man almost 20 years her senior whom she hardly knew, she had meekly acquiesced. So it was rather a shock to her family when she violated the injunction of both her father and brother, refused to divorce the political criminal (as the law allowed), left her infant behind and prepared to follow Volkonsky east, to Siberia.\n\nWhat transformed Maria Raevsky Volkonsky into a full-scale heroine? Christine Sutherland, her biographer, has a clever answer: Byron. Having spent only three months of her first year of marriage with her husband because of his military postings, Maria could easily confuse him with a Byronic hero who fights for liberty. In fact, her sister, who had found her reading ''Mazeppa,'' suspected that life was about to imitate art. This particular youthful fantasy of revolutionary heroism would be put to the test, however, for wives were permitted to go past Irkutsk only after having renounced their right to return to European Russia, even in the event of their husbands' death.\n\nOf course, each sacrifice demanded by the Czar only added to the cult surrounding the Decembrists' wives. The images of once-privileged ladies washing floors, mending their husbands' linen and eating only kasha and black bread - for the first time in their lives - became a model of strength and self-abnegation for a later generation of more militant Russian women. Disdainful of the female revolutionaries who came along in the 1870's and 80's, Miss Sutherland is careful to distinguish her heroine from them; unfortunately, in so doing, she divorces the Decembrists' wives from Russia's radical tradition and the movement for women's liberation, in which they (or rather their idealized portraits) were to play an inspirational role.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
