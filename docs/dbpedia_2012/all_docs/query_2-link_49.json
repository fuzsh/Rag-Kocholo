        "text": "SUEZ has signed a contract for a large wastewater treatment project and has been awarded an associated 10-year service agreement with Irkutsk Polymer Plant of Irkutsk Oil Company, one of the largest independent oil and gas producers located in Russia building a new, modern polymer plant in the Eastern Siberia region of the country. Through its Water Technologies & Solutions business, SUEZ will supply critical water technology for the new plant and will guarantee performance and membrane replacements for the duration of the service agreement.\n\nSelected for its experience with similar projects in Russia that face harsh weather conditions and winter temperatures consistently well below freezing, SUEZ will treat all wastewater from the new plant using 3 main technologies; membrane bioreactor (MBR), electrodialysis reversal (EDR) and thermal vapor recompression (TVR). The combination of technologies will enable the plant to reach near-zero liquid discharge and implement water reuse, thereby limiting the plant’s impact on the local environment.\n\n“This project demonstrates the value of our broad portfolio and how the right combination of advanced technologies can help a customer reach their unique goals,” said Kevin Cassidy, executive vice president engineered systems for SUEZ – Water Technologies & Solutions. “Because of our global expertise and local experience, we have the honor to help Irkutsk Polymer Plant reuse up to 98% of their wastewater.”\n\nFor the remaining effluent stream, the treatment process will enable the Irkutsk Polymer Plant to meet strict government regulations for discharge, including the fishery body standards of the Russian Federation for discharged water, which are among the strictest on the globe.\n\nOnce commissioned, the wastewater treatment plant will treat a total maximum design flow of 400 m3/hr. The plant is expected to be commissioned in 2024.\n\n“During the construction and further operation of the plant, advanced technologies and equipment from the world's leading manufacturers will be involved,” said Egor Fomin, director of the Irkutsk Polymer Plant. “Thanks to our partners, including SUEZ, we intend to create in Eastern Siberia a high-tech safe production for the deep processing of hydrocarbons.”"
