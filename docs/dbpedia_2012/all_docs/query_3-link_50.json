        "meta_description": "WASHINGTON — Last week, G7 Leaders reaffirmed their support for an independent, democratic Ukraine within is internationally recognized borders. Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), is implementing the commitments made by G7 Leaders by taking action against third-country actors who materially support Russia’s war; targeting Russian military procurement networks and those who help Russia acquire machine tools, equipment, and key inputs; and further curtailing Russia’s use of the international financial system to further its war in Ukraine. “The Kremlin has steadily turned Russia into a wartime economy, but Putin’s war machine cannot survive on domestic production alone,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Our sanctions today continue to tighten the vise on willing third-country suppliers and networks providing Russia the inputs it desperately needs to ramp up and sustain its military-industrial base.”Concurrently, the Department of State is imposing sanctions on over 100 entities and individuals, including those engaged in sanctions evasion in numerous third countries, complicit in furthering Russia’s ability to wage its war against Ukraine, and responsible for bolstering Russia’s future energy production and export capacity.THIRD-COUNTRY SUPPLIERS AND PROCUREMENT NETWORKSTreasury continues to take action to identify and disrupt third-country individuals, entities, and networks that facilitate, arrange, and enable the transfer of key technology, equipment, and inputs to Russian military-industrial base end-users. Many of these items have been identified by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, alongside the European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom, as “common high priority items” because Russia seeks to procure them for its weapons programs. Today’s action once again underscores Russia’s utilization of Türkiye, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the People’s Republic of China (PRC), as well as the use of complex transnational networks and third-country cut-outs, to acquire much-needed technology and equipment for its war economy.Multinational Weapons and Technology Procurement NetworkOFAC is designating a network of four entities and nine individuals based in the PRC, the Russian Federation, Hong Kong, and Pakistan involved in the facilitation and procurement of Chinese-manufactured weapons and technologies to Russia. Chinese national Hu Xiaoxun (Hu) has utilized his PRC-based private defense company Jarvis HK Co., Ltd. (Jarvis) and a network of associates to coordinate the sale of Chinese-manufactured weapons and technologies to Russia.Hu’s network has worked to structure deals circumventing United States sanctions and Chinese controls on the export of military-related materials, including for conventional weapons and electronic components with Russian customers ranging from thousands of dollars for ammunition, to hundreds of thousands of dollars for loitering munitions, to millions of dollars for semiconductor microchip manufacturing equipment. Hu and his associates have attempted to mask the identities of his customers by obfuscating the end-user of PRC-manufactured products, including by coordinating shipments through third-party countries and organizing shipments through intermediary company PJSC Vysochaishy (Vysochaishy) and its Chairman Sergey Vladimirovich Dokuchaev (Dokuchaev).Hu’s network has facilitated the procurement of Chinese-manufactured military materials and technology, including UAVs and related components, for various Russian customers and intermediaries, including Technology 5 Co., Limited (Technology 5) and its General Director Vladimir Vladimirovich Gugnin (Gugnin), Limited Liability Company Yuna Engineering (Yuna) and its General Director Andrei Denisovich Zalevskii (Zalevskii), Roman Aleksandrovich Kotekin (Kotekin) of U.S.-designated FGUP NPP Istok, and Russian intermediary Boris Olegovich Bernikov (Bernikov). Hu has worked with Pakistani associates and weapons dealers Syed Asadullah (Asadullah) and Nur Khabib Shakh (Shakh), as well as Russian associate Vladimir Krylov (Krylov), to coordinate sale and business proposals, structure plans for Russian domestic production of military goods, and procure various Chinese weapons and technologies on behalf of the Russian military and defense sector.Hu was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy. Jarvis was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Hu. Technology 5 was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Hu.Gugnin was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Technology 5. Yuna was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the technology sector of the Russian Federation economy.Zalevskii was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Yuna.Kotekin, Bernikov, Vysochaishy, and Krylov were designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy. Dokuchaev was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Vysochaishy. Asadullah and Shakh were designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Hu.Türkiye-based EntitiesBosfor Avrasya Ic Ve Dis Ticaret Limited Sirketi (Bosfor Avrasya) has sent hundreds of shipments of common high priority items to Russia-based manufacturers, including shipments of ball or roller bearings. Egetir Otomotiv Sanayi Ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi (Egetir Otomotiv) has sent over 150 shipments to Russia-based manufacturers, with the majority of the shipments including common high priority items such as ball or roller bearings.Globus Turkey Lojistik Dis Ticaret Limited Sirketi (Globus Turkey) has sent common high priority items to Russia-based end-users, including tantalum capacitors. Kartal Exim Dis Ticaret Limited Sirketi (Kartal Exim) supplies technological equipment from Europe, Asia, the United States, and Canada.

These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior.

        "text": "WASHINGTON — Last week, G7 Leaders reaffirmed their support for an independent, democratic Ukraine within is internationally recognized borders. Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), is implementing the commitments made by G7 Leaders by taking action against third-country actors who materially support Russia’s war; targeting Russian military procurement networks and those who help Russia acquire machine tools, equipment, and key inputs; and further curtailing Russia’s use of the international financial system to further its war in Ukraine.\n\n“The Kremlin has steadily turned Russia into a wartime economy, but Putin’s war machine cannot survive on domestic production alone,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Our sanctions today continue to tighten the vise on willing third-country suppliers and networks providing Russia the inputs it desperately needs to ramp up and sustain its military-industrial base.”\n\nConcurrently, the Department of State is imposing sanctions on over 100 entities and individuals, including those engaged in sanctions evasion in numerous third countries, complicit in furthering Russia’s ability to wage its war against Ukraine, and responsible for bolstering Russia’s future energy production and export capacity.\n\nTHIRD-COUNTRY SUPPLIERS AND PROCUREMENT NETWORKS\n\nTreasury continues to take action to identify and disrupt third-country individuals, entities, and networks that facilitate, arrange, and enable the transfer of key technology, equipment, and inputs to Russian military-industrial base end-users. Many of these items have been identified by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, alongside the European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom, as “common high priority items” because Russia seeks to procure them for its weapons programs.\n\nToday’s action once again underscores Russia’s utilization of Türkiye, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the People’s Republic of China (PRC), as well as the use of complex transnational networks and third-country cut-outs, to acquire much-needed technology and equipment for its war economy.\n\nMultinational Weapons and Technology Procurement Network\n\nOFAC is designating a network of four entities and nine individuals based in the PRC, the Russian Federation, Hong Kong, and Pakistan involved in the facilitation and procurement of Chinese-manufactured weapons and technologies to Russia. Chinese national Hu Xiaoxun (Hu) has utilized his PRC-based private defense company Jarvis HK Co., Ltd. (Jarvis) and a network of associates to coordinate the sale of Chinese-manufactured weapons and technologies to Russia.\n\nHu’s network has worked to structure deals circumventing United States sanctions and Chinese controls on the export of military-related materials, including for conventional weapons and electronic components with Russian customers ranging from thousands of dollars for ammunition, to hundreds of thousands of dollars for loitering munitions, to millions of dollars for semiconductor microchip manufacturing equipment. Hu and his associates have attempted to mask the identities of his customers by obfuscating the end-user of PRC-manufactured products, including by coordinating shipments through third-party countries and organizing shipments through intermediary company PJSC Vysochaishy (Vysochaishy) and its Chairman Sergey Vladimirovich Dokuchaev (Dokuchaev).\n\nHu’s network has facilitated the procurement of Chinese-manufactured military materials and technology, including UAVs and related components, for various Russian customers and intermediaries, including Technology 5 Co., Limited (Technology 5) and its General Director Vladimir Vladimirovich Gugnin (Gugnin), Limited Liability Company Yuna Engineering (Yuna) and its General Director Andrei Denisovich Zalevskii (Zalevskii), Roman Aleksandrovich Kotekin (Kotekin) of U.S.-designated FGUP NPP Istok, and Russian intermediary Boris Olegovich Bernikov (Bernikov).\n\nHu has worked with Pakistani associates and weapons dealers Syed Asadullah (Asadullah) and Nur Khabib Shakh (Shakh), as well as Russian associate Vladimir Krylov (Krylov), to coordinate sale and business proposals, structure plans for Russian domestic production of military goods, and procure various Chinese weapons and technologies on behalf of the Russian military and defense sector.\n\nHu was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy.\n\nJarvis was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Hu.\n\nTechnology 5 was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Hu.\n\nGugnin was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Technology 5.\n\nYuna was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the technology sector of the Russian Federation economy.\n\nZalevskii was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Yuna.\n\nKotekin, Bernikov, Vysochaishy, and Krylov were designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy.\n\nDokuchaev was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Vysochaishy.\n\nAsadullah and Shakh were designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Hu.\n\nTürkiye-based Entities\n\nBosfor Avrasya Ic Ve Dis Ticaret Limited Sirketi (Bosfor Avrasya) has sent hundreds of shipments of common high priority items to Russia-based manufacturers, including shipments of ball or roller bearings.\n\nEgetir Otomotiv Sanayi Ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi (Egetir Otomotiv) has sent over 150 shipments to Russia-based manufacturers, with the majority of the shipments including common high priority items such as ball or roller bearings.\n\nGlobus Turkey Lojistik Dis Ticaret Limited Sirketi (Globus Turkey) has sent common high priority items to Russia-based end-users, including tantalum capacitors.\n\nKartal Exim Dis Ticaret Limited Sirketi (Kartal Exim) supplies technological equipment from Europe, Asia, the United States, and Canada.

In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt. These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here.
