        "text": "INTERACTION OF NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES IN SOLVING PROBLEMS OF THE LAKE BAIKAL REGION\n\nV.V.Dryukker\n\nLimnological Institute, Irkutsk\n\nThe UN Conference on Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992) has proclaimed the concept of sustainable development as a basis for a new paradigm of future development of our civilization and has adopted a program of actions when entering the twenty-first century (The Agenda for the Twenty-First Century). Principle 4 of the adopted Declaration states: “In order to achieve sustainable development, environmental protection shall constitute an integral part of the development process and cannot be considered in isolation from it.”\n\nThe Lake Baikal region is an example of a territory that has not only national, but also international importance. It has an eternal value not only for Russians, but also for the whole of mankind. Lake Baikal is the most ancient lake on the planet. Its age is about 25–30 million years. It is the deepest lake, with a depth of 1,637 meters. It contains a tremendous volume of water—23,000 cubic kilometers or 23 percent of the world’s resources of pure fresh water. It is also one of the largest in areal expanse.\n\nAccording to present-day data, the genetic diversity of Baikal includes 2,565 species and subspecies of aquatic fauna and 1,000 species and subspecies of aquatic plants, of which two-thirds are endemic, meaning they are found nowhere else. To this number one should add many hundreds of species of water and bottom micro-organisms as well as viruses and microbes that have been little investigated. Thus, the diversity of Baikal has no equal in the world, and Lake Baikal is included in the UNESCO World Nature Heritage List of 1996.\n\nWhat is the Baikal region? This is a region directly connected with the internationally known Lake Baikal and located in the center of Asia on the\n\nterritory of two states, Russia and Mongolia. The territory of the Baikal region stretches from south to north for 1300 km, and from west to east for 1,000 km. Its total area is 800,000 sq. km. The unique combination of various landscapes in the center of Asia—from mountain-tundra and mountain-taiga to steppe and semi-desert along with the largest and most ancient freshwater reservoir—is of special significance and value in the biosphere structure of the planet as a whole.\n\nThe Baikal watershed occupies territory in the southeast of Siberia and the northern part of Mongolia. The largest part is located in Russia, where it has been divided without taking into account the lake’s area over several administrative and territorial entities of the Russian Federation: Republic of Buryatia-73 percent, Chita Oblast-21 percent, Irkutsk Oblast-6 percent. The Baikal ecosystem has become better known just as its protection and rational use have become more complicated. New territories located outside the bounds of the lake’s watershed have been included in the Baikal region, including that part of Irkutsk Oblast that adjoins the northwest boundary of the Baikal watershed. It is up to 200 km. wide and regarded as a zone from which atmospheric emissions of industrial installations may reach the watershed.\n\nAt present in accordance with the Law of the Russian Federation “On Protection of Lake Baikal,” the Baikal region is divided into three zones:\n\nCentral ecological zone (“the core”)—territory that includes Lake Baikal and islands, a water protection zone adjacent to Lake Baikal, and protected natural territories adjacent to Lake Baikal;\n\nBuffer ecological zone—territory outside the central ecological zone that includes the watershed of Lake Baikal within the bounds of the Russian Federation;\n\nEcological zone of atmospheric effect—territory outside the watershed of Lake Baikal within the bounds of the Russian Federation up to 200 km. wide to the north and northwest of the watershed where there are economic units with activity that has a negative influence on Lake Baikal.\n\nSuch a division of the Baikal region is an important condition for preservation of Baikal as a part of the World Nature Heritage.\n\nAt the same time, the Baikal region is characterized by considerable development of industry and agriculture, which cannot avoid affecting the condition of the lake. Therefore, the question of a balanced solution of ecological and socio-economic problems is especially acute here.\n\nThe following ecological problems of the Baikal region are priority issues:\n\nThe natural conditions of the geosystem components\n\nPreservation of a large amount of biological diversity\n\nConsequences of industrial and agricultural development\n\nUse of reliable ecological information\n\nThe natural conditions of the Baikal region require accurate methods of investigations for measuring the parameters of water and ground ecosystems and the air basin. For the most part the region is still not polluted.\n\nWhile solving the questions of environmental protection in the Baikal region, particular attention must be paid to preservation of biological diversity which means, according to the Convention on Biological Diversity, variability of living organisms from all sources including soil, sea, and other water ecosystems as well as ecological complexes including these components.\n\nFor addressing the questions of preservation of the Baikal region, the normative-legal basis includes both international documents and the laws of the Russian Federation:\n\nConvention on Biological Diversity, Rio de Janeiro, 1992.\n\nConvention on Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, 1972.\n\nAll-European Strategy of Preservation of Biological and Landscape Biodiversity, Sofia, 1995.\n\nConvention on Assessment of Environmental Effects in a Transboundary Context, 1991.\n\nFederal law “On Natural Environment Preservation,” 1991.\n\nFederal law “On Ecological Examination,” 1995.\n\nFederal law “On Especially Protected Territories,” 1990.\n\nFederal law “On Protection of Lake Baikal,” 1999.\n\nWater Code of the Russian Federation.\n\nForest Code of the Russian Federation.\n\n“On State Strategy of the Russian Federation Regarding Environmental Protection and Ensuring Sustainable Development,” the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation of February 4, 1994, # 236.\n\n“Conception of Transition of the Russian Federation to Sustainable Development,” the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation of April 1, 1996, #440.\n\n“National Plan of Action for Environmental Protection of the Russian Federation in 1999–2001.” Approved at the meeting of the Government of the Russian Federation on November 12, 1998.\n\n“Strategy of Sustainable Development of the Russian Federation.” Approved at the meeting of the Government of the Russian Federation in December 1997.\n\nThus, in the Russian Federation there are a number of strategic planning documents in the field of environmental protection and Sustainable development that have not yet been put in a strict hierarchical order due to the fact that the legislation in this field is relatively new. However these documents can already be used as a legislative basis.\n\nIn the Baikal region a number of attempts have been made by state structures and public organizations to implement programs aimed at preservation. The state documents on Baikal preservation are as follows:\n\nResolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the USSR Council of Ministers of April 13, 1987, # 434, “On Arrangements to Ensure Protection and Rational Use of Natural Resources of the Lake Baikal Basin in 1987–1995.”\n\n“Territorial Integrated Scheme of Protection of Nature in the Lake Baikal Basin,” approved on April 14, 1990, by the Resolution of the Presidium of the Russian Federation Council of Ministers.\n\n“Integrated Federal Program of Ensuring Lake Baikal Preservation and Rational Use of Natural Resources of Its Basin,” 1994.\n\nThe role of nongovernmental public organizations in implementing the above decisions is difficult to overestimate. The destiny of “the sacred sea,” as people living on the banks of Baikal call the lake, has worried both children and old people. This is evident from signatures for preservation of the unique Baikal, demonstrations, appearances on television, and unauthorized signs reading “Let us preserve Baikal” on the chimneys of the Baikal Pulp and Paper Plant. The most active supporters of environmental protection in the Baikal region are the following public organizations:\n\nBaikal Ecological Wave, which has organized regular publication of the ecological magazine Wave.\n\nBaikal Ecological Parliament, with prominent scientists from Irkutsk as its members.\n\nRevival of the Land of Siberia.\n\nGreenpeace.\n\nThe above public organizations are in continuous contact with local government institutions. They participate in all ecological decisions without exception. In particular, they put forward the idea of instituting Baikal Day, which since 1999 has been routinely conducted at the end of August-beginning of September in the form of various actions for the protection of the lake, thereby joining the efforts of local governing institutions and various ecological movements.\n\nIn March 1998, the Limnological Institute in Irkutsk and the Baikal Institute of Nature Management in Ulan-Ude, with the support of ecological organizations of Irkutsk Oblast and the Republic of Buryatia, started implementation of a TACIS project “Assistance in Gaining Ecological Information and Its Dissemination among the Population of the Baikal Region.” The financial support was provided by the European Union and the technical\n\nsupport by the Society of Technical Assistance (Germany). The aim of the project is to distribute information among the population and organizations responsible for decision-making in the field of environmental protection. As a result of the joint work conducted by a large number of state and public ecological organization as well as institutions of basic and additional education, the Baikal Ecological Information Network has been established. Its participants are located in 12 towns of Irkutsk Oblast alone.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Baikal region realize that they are responsible to the whole of mankind and future generations for preservation of the world pearl, Lake Baikal. The ecological conditions in our region are very tense and complicated. Thus, realizing their personal responsibility, more and more people are standing up for environmental protection.\n\nPeople also realize that nothing will change if the way of thinking remains unchanged. But it can be changed only if there is reliable information. Ecological workers understand the importance and necessity of ecological education; but very often they have no possibility to obtain the information they need, even though such information is available at research institutes situated in the Baikal region. In Irkutsk alone there are nine institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences conducting research on nature management. The organizers and those implementing the above mentioned project have identified the following problems:\n\nTo collect and process ecological information and make it accessible to all those who need it.\n\nTo establish a standing network of ecological organizations of Irkutsk Oblast and the Republic of Buryatia, including consumers and distributors of this information.\n\nThe project participants have defined the concept of providing the population of the Baikal region with information as a strategy of collecting, processing, and presenting data about natural resources of the territory based on the principles of integration and legal responsibility, using up-to-date information technologies to make well-grounded decisions regarding nature management in the region. Now the important tasks for teachers, ecologists, and progressive groups of the population are not only the ecological orientation of the public and providing the population with information, but also the task of promoting civic positions and stimulating social activities for democratization of ecological knowledge.\n\nThe implementation of this large-scale TACIS project has resulted in:\n\nEstablishing the Baikal Ecological Information Network.\n\nObtaining a large number of computers.\n\nMethodological miscalculations, in particular, not taking into account the integrated ecological approach.\n\nUnreasonable “centralization” and lack of orientation towards priorities of the concerned parties and users of the results of activities under the programs.\n\nWith regard to resource potential, this region has all the necessary qualities to be chosen as a “model” when elaborating the concept of sustainable development from the position of the Agenda for the Twenty-First Century. A rather well-preserved environment of the region, a huge resource potential, and a unique natural object—Lake Baikal with the surrounding landscapes—form a natural basis for the sustainable development process.\n\nOn the other hand, the ecological fragility of the natural landscape system of the region, especially the ecosystem of Lake Baikal, will determine the high requirements for social and economic development processes, including the ethics and aesthetics of nature management oriented toward the future. Lake Baikal and the whole Baikal region should become an area for international cooperation of intellectual, financial, material, and human efforts aimed at solving the integrated problems of the survival of mankind and the preservation of the biosphere.\n\nPROJECT OF BIODIVERSITY PRESERVATION IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION\n\nTABLE 1 Fauna of the Most Ancient Lakes\n\nLake\n\nNumber of animal species and subspecies\n\nReference\n\nBaikal\n\n2565\n\nTimoshkin and others, 1997\n\nTanganyika (Africa)\n\n1248\n\nCoulter, 1991\n\nBiwa (Japan)\n\n595\n\nMori, Miura, 1990\n\nCaspian Sea\n\n542\n\nKosarev, Yablonskaya, 1990\n\nOhrid (Macedonia)\n\n430\n\nStancovic, 1960; Salemmaa, 1985; Kenk, 1978\n\nHubsugul (Mongolia)\n\n285\n\nVarikhanova, 1989; Kozhova and others, 1997\n\nTiticaca (South America)\n\n200\n\nDejoux, 1992"
