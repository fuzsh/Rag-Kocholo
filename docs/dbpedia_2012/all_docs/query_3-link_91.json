Identification of social economic structures of the Siberian regions, including in health sector, is necessary for successful management of their development. Non-profit organizations are one of their essential components.\n\nPurpose. To review non-profit organizations in the health sector of the Irkutsk region.\n\nMaterials and methods. The research is based on data of the Unified State Register of Legal Entities presented at the websites of the Ministry of Justice and Federal Tax Service, and data at the websites of the Government of the Irkutsk region and websites of non-profit organizations. The authors used the descriptive method.\n\nResults. The total number of non-profit organizations in the health sector adds up to about 100 organizations of 9 legal organizational forms. Autonomous nonprofit organizations (37%), public organizations (29%), and institutions (16%) prevail. Most of the non-profit organizations in the health sector are located in the cities, in Irkutsk mainly. Their activities generally cover the entire Irkutsk region, and their members are persons of many settlements.\n\nThe authors have outlined all types of activities of non-profit organizations in the health sector of all legal organizational forms. According to the Russian National Classifier of Types of Economic Activity main types of economic activities of the majority of autonomous non-profit organizations and institutions fall into different groups and classes of the \"Activity in the field of Health Care and Social Services\" section. The majority of social organizations are represented by the group of \"Activity of other social organizations which are not included in other groups\", including all their activities, except for policy. Major activity types of only two social organizations fall in the group of \"Activity of the professional member organizations\". Their activities are focused in specific spheres.\n\nThe study shows that functioning of many non-profit organizations in the health sector is not transparent.\n\nConclusions. Activities of many non-profit organizations in the health sector, mainly of all social organizations, are focused on consolidating medical community. Their contribution in care delivery, diagnostics and prevention is essential. Often organizations with different legal organizational forms implement identical types of activities.\n\nScope of application. The obtained results can be used by administrative structures of the healthcare system.\n\nKeywords: health care; Irkutsk region; non-profit organization; social organization; health workers; legal forms of the organizations; activity; OKVED (All-Russian Classifier of Types of Economic Activity).\n\nReferences\n\nBaranov A.A., Al'bitskiy V.Yu., Sher S.A.
