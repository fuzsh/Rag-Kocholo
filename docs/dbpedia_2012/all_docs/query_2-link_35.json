        "text": "Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor has blocked Facebook, the world’s largest social-media platform by number of users, in the latest broadside against freedom of information in the country as the Kremlin seeks to control the narrative about its war in Ukraine.\n\n\"This is part of their effort...to cut off a range of information from their public,\" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on March 4, referring to the cutoff of Facebook. \"We are deeply concerned about this and concerned about the threat on freedom of speech in the country.\"\n\nRussian citizens confirmed to RFE/RL that they were experiencing problems with Facebook access.\n\nRoskomnadzar based its decision on claims that Facebook was discriminating against Russian media and information resources such as RT, RIA Novosti, and Sputnik.\n\nWATCH: Many Russians are being fed a daily media diet of Kremlin propaganda that hides the terrible destruction and human cost of their country's invasion of Ukraine. So how did ordinary Russians in Perm and Vladivostok react when Current Time reporters showed them some images?\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:32 0:00\n\nRoskomnadzor said the decision blocked Facebook in Russia and that there had been \"26 instances of discrimination toward Russian media\" by Facebook since October 2020.\n\nRoskomnadzor said earlier that it had \"limited\" access to independent media websites as the authorities stepped up an apparent effort to prevent Russian speakers from getting access to outside information amid the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMultiple RFE/RL websites and the Russian sites of the BBC and Deutsche Welle, along with Facebook, Twitter, and Apple and Google's app stores were all blocked overnight on March 3-4, according to monitoring group GlobalCheck and other indicators.\n\nRoskomnadzor said later on March 4 that it had \"restricted access\" to Twitter. Access was restricted on the basis of a request by the Prosecutor-General's Office from February 24, according to the Interfax and RIA Novosti news agencies.\n\nFacebook and Twitter have circulated videos of the Kremlin's war on Ukraine that contradict the official narrative of a successful \"special operation.\" The videos include captured and killed Russian soldiers and destroyed Ukrainian cities.\n\nSome of the sites sites were still available to Rostelecom subscribers, GlobalCheck said.\n\nThe blockages are preventing Russian access to the Russian Service of RFE/RL.\n\nRFE/RL's regional Russian-language North.Realities and Siberia.Realities sites, the websites of the Tatar-Bashkir service, Azatliq.org and Idelreal.org, and the Caucasus.Realities site run by its North Caucasus Service, are also blocked in Russia.\n\nThe website of Current Time, the Russian-language network led by RFE/RL in cooperation with VOA, has been blocked by Russian authorities since February 28, although the service has published methods to bypass the block.\n\n\"Putin is feeding Russians a steady diet of lies about the scope and costs of the war in Ukraine,\" RFE/RL President Jamie Fly said on March 4. \"RFE/RL refuses to censor our content at this critical moment for our Russian audiences. They deserve the truth and we will continue to provide them with factual information about their government’s actions and the consequences that they must now endure.\"\n\nJournalists at the Latvian-based Russian- and English-language news outlet Meduza also said that \"everything looks like Meduza's site is blocked in Russia,\" adding: \"These times will pass. We continue our work.\"\n\nThe editorial offices of RFE/RL's Russian Service received six notifications from Roskomnadzor late on March 2 in which the Russian media-monitoring agency threatened to block the service's website amid ongoing coverage of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe service reported that Roskomnadzor said it would use its powers to block news on Svoboda.org about the shelling of Kharkiv, in Ukraine, as well as the hacking of some Russian websites by cyber-actors sympathetic to Ukraine and material about social media reactions to the hostilities.\n\nThe media regulator said the materials \"delivered deliberately false socially significant information about Russia's alleged attack on the territory of Ukraine\" in ways that could \"create panic among people.\"\n\nThe regulator's move to block Facebook, which has more than 2.9 billion monthly active users globally, including tens of million in Russia, further isolates the country from the rest of the world.\n\nWestern governments have largely cut Russia off from their financial systems since its invasion of Ukraine, while dozens of Western firms have announced they are withdrawing from the country.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters\n\nPRAGUE -- The European Union’s special envoy for efforts to normalize relations between Serbia and its former province Kosovo has warned of the danger of “outbursts of instability” for years to come if those Balkan neighbors can’t overcome their current impasse and unilateral actions continue.\n\nIn an extended interview with RFE/RL’s Kosovo Service at the Globsec security conference in Prague on August 30, Miroslav Lajcak said the clear task for both sides is to implement their commitments from last year’s so-called Ohrid Agreement within the decade-old “dialogue” to avoid “hostile or even violent” actions and responses.\n\nHe lamented a lack of momentum on EU enlargement in the past but also repeated Brussels’ stance that a lack of progress on normalization directly hinders Serbia’s and Kosovo’s respective EU membership bids.\n\n“[W]e either have normalization, which will bring stabilization, open the way for regional cooperation, which is struggling right now,\" Lajcak said, \"or we will continue with the actions which are not coordinated, with prompt reaction which is again not coordinated, and could become hostile or even violent, and we might be kept busy for years with this repetition of, I would say, outburst[s] of instability. And this obviously prevents the region from progressing on the European path.”\n\nHe suggested Serbian and Kosovar societies “are not ready for normalization” but said the unresolved problem of Serbian-Kosovar relations goes well beyond those two countries and is “very much a regional and European issue.”\n\nSerbia does not acknowledge the independence of its predominantly ethnic Albanian former province since Pristina declared sovereignty in 2008, a move officially recognized by more than 100 countries but not by Russia, China, or a handful of EU member states. A bitter ethnic war punctuated by NATO intervention in 1999 preceded UN interim administration ahead of Kosovo’s independence.\n\nDuring two leadership stints since 2020, Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti’s government has conducted a mounting campaign of “reciprocal” measures to pressure Belgrade to recognize Kosovo’s statehood and official institutions.\n\nThe Serbian and Kosovar sides reached agreement in the resort town of Ohrid on normalization steps in early 2023, but key elements of the deal remain unfulfilled, including Pristina’s pledge dating back to 2013 to establish a legal foundation for an association to represent majority-Serb municipalities in Kosovo.\n\nBut two subsequent flareups of violence in northern Kosovo – unrest that injured dozens of NATO KFOR peacekeepers in May 2023 and the killing of a Kosovar police officer by a group of commando-like Serbs at an Orthodox monastery in September 2023 -- alarmed the international community and lent urgency to the dialogue.\n\nMore recently, Pristina has clamped down on the use of Serbian currency at banks and postal outlets, as well as other aspects of daily life for thousands of Serbs who resist Kosovar central authority, prompting the United States and the European Union to urge against “unilateral” and “uncoordinated” steps by either side.\n\nKurti says Kosovar authorities are establishing rule of law and public order.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandr Vucic has accused Kosovo’s government of trying to terrorize and intimidate the local Serb population.\n\n“If you ask me, the problem is that the two societies are not ready for normalization,” Lajcak told RFE/RL. He said his four-year term “has been probably more dedicated to crisis management than to promoting of normalization.”\n\nIn July, the EU Council extended Lajcak’s mandate by five months, to January 2025, at the request of outgoing EU foreign policy head Josep Borrell.\n\nLajcak downplayed suggestions that Borrell’s successor, former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, would do without such an envoy to the delicate Serbia-Kosovo dialogue.\n\n“The job is not done and, therefore, the job must continue,” Lajcak said. “And I believe that there should be an [EU special representative] assisting the high representative until the Ohrid Agreement is implemented.\n\n“But one important element that I will, of course, stress also to my successor and to the new high representative is that this process must be visibly and directly linked to the European integration.”\n\nSerbia was awarded EU candidate status along with other hopefuls in 2012, while Kosovo remains a “potential candidate” with its participation in other multinational organizations, including the UN, blocked by its partial recognition.\n\nLajcak said the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine had sparked an “awakening” within the European Union of the risks of stalled enlargement since Croatia’s accession in 2013, and he insisted the “dynamic has changed already.”\n\n“Paradoxically, this awakening came as a consequence of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's aggression against Ukraine when the European Union also decided to invite Ukraine and Moldova to join,” Lajcak said. “So this is a huge new opportunity for the Balkans. The door that has been closed for 10 years is now open.”\n\nThe Kremlin on August 30 said it is not concerned about President Vladimir Putin's visit to Mongolia on September 3, despite an arrest warrant that the International Criminal Court (ICC) says Mongolia is obligated to act on.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters during his daily conference call on August 30 that the Kremlin has “no worries” about the upcoming trip, adding that Russia has “a wonderful dialogue with our friends from Mongolia.”\n\nThe trip will be Putin’s first to a country that is a member of the ICC since the arrest warrant was issued in March 2023 over suspected war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nICC members are bound to detain suspects for whom the court has issued an arrest warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no enforcement mechanism. Mongolia signed the Rome Statute, the court’s founding treaty, in 2000 and ratified it in 2002.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Ministry said earlier on August 30 that it hoped that the Mongolian government “will realize the fact that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal” and called on the Mongolian authorities to comply with the international arrest warrant and hand Putin over to the ICC.\n\nICC spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah underscored in a statement quoted by the AP on August 30 that Mongolia “is a State Party to the ICC Rome Statute” and thus has the obligation to cooperate with the court.\n\nThe ICC relies on its state parties and other partners to execute its decisions, including arrest warrants, El Abdallah said in the statement.\n\nThe ICC accused Putin in March 2023 of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. Maria Lvova-Belova, Moscow’s commissioner for children's rights, is also named in the warrant, which alleges they committed war crimes in connection with the deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children.\n\nRussia is not a member of the ICC and refuses to hand over suspects. Russian officials have dismissed the warrants as “null and void.”\n\nPutin will travel to Mongolia at the invitation of President Ukhnaa Khurelsukh to participate in ceremonies marking the 85th anniversary of the joint victory of the Soviet and Mongolian armies over Japan on the Khalkhin Gol River, a Kremlin statement said.\n\nPutin will also hold talks with Khurelsukh and other top Mongolian officials, the statement said.\n\nWith reporting by AP\n\nUkraine needs \"strong decisions\" from its partners to stop the terror that Russia is perpetrating in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on August 30 after a Russian air strike on Kharkiv hit a high-rise residential building and playground, killing six people.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

A blow that would not have happened if our defense forces had the ability to destroy Russian military aircraft where they are based. We need strong solutions from our partners to stop this terror. This is an absolutely fair need. And there is no rational reason to limit Ukraine in defense. We need long-range capabilities,\" Zelenskiy said on Telegram.\n\nZelenskiy's message was accompanied by a video showing cars in a parking lot on fire and smoke streaming out of the middle and upper floors of an adjacent building.\n\nHe also again emphasized that agreements Ukraine has made with its partners on providing air-defense systems must be fulfilled.\n\nThe air strike on Kharkiv hit the entrance of a 12-story building in the industrial district of the city, local authorities reported. Four other districts of the city were shelled. One of the six people killed was a 14-year-old girl, regional Governor Oleh Synyehubov said. He said the overall number of injured was 47. He previously reported that about 20 of the injured were in serious condition.\n\nIt was not possible to independently verify the claims.\n\nKharkiv has been the focus of heavy Russian bombing in the past, but there had been a drop in intensity in recent weeks.\n\nElsewhere on the battlefield, Russian forces are conducting \"two key tactical operations\" as part of their offensive to capture the strategic city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on August 29.\n\nThe first is along the Novogrodivka-Hrodivka line east of Pokrovsk with the aim of advancing to the outskirts of the city. The second is along the Selydove-Ukrayinsk-Hirnyk line to the southeast with the aim of \"eliminating vulnerabilities to Ukrainian counterattacks.\"\n\nThe operations are seen by the Russian military as key to an \"intensified offensive effort against Pokrovsk itself,\" ISW wrote.\n\nThe General Staff of the Ukrainian military said there had been 109 combat clashes during the day, and most of the fighting took place in the Pokrovsk area in the Donetsk region.\n\nThere was also fighting in the areas near Kupyansk and Lyman, the General Staff said in its late afternoon assessment on August 30. In total, Russian troops advanced in 11 directions, it said.\n\nZelenskiy said in his evening address on August 29 that the battlefield situation was \"extremely difficult\" in Pokrovsk and other areas in the Donetsk region.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nA petition has been launched urging Azerbaijani authorities to immediately release political analyst Bahruz Samadov and other scholars arrested by the South Caucasus nation's authorities in recent months.\n\nAs of August 30, the online petition had been signed by almost 150 scholars from Azerbaijan and other nations. Samadov, a doctoral student at Charles University in Prague, was detained last week on a treason charge that he rejects.\n\n\"Samadov's doctoral research at Charles University focuses on authoritarianism and political discourses in Azerbaijan. He has been known for his critical and timely analyses of Azerbaijani current affairs, including developments surrounding the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, which have appeared on various international media outlets,\" the petition says, adding that Samadov has advocated for peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe petition also says that the tightly controlled former Soviet republic’s government has intensified a crackdown on media, activists, and scholars whose thoughts do not coincide with those of the authorities after Baku won the 44-day war with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh in November 2020, and managed to regain control over the region last September.\n\nSince last November, more than a dozen journalists working for independent media outlets -- including Abzas Media, Kanal 13, and Toplum TV -- have been arrested on charges that they, their employers, and rights groups have called politically motivated.\n\nAmong the arrested Azerbaijani scholars, the petition mentioned economists Qubad Ibadoglu, Fazil Qasimov, and Farid Mehralizade, and ethnographer Iqbal Abilov.\n\n\"The arbitrary arrest and detention of members of the academic community is incompatible with Azerbaijan’s international commitments and it is a durable stain on the country’s reputation,\" the petitions says.\n\n\"We believe in the value of producing independent research on Azerbaijan and do not want to see the country become a blank spot on the global knowledge map. We stand in solidarity with Bahruz Samadov and other Azerbaijani scholars who were unjustly detained simply in light of their academic activities.\"\n\nThe petition also calls on European Union officials, entities, and the academic community to raise awareness of the situation faced by Samadov and other Azerbaijani scholars and demand their release.\n\nCritics of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev's government say authorities in the oil-rich Caspian Sea state frequently seek to silence dissent by jailing opposition activists, journalists, and civil society advocates on trumped-up charges.\n\nAliyev has ruled Azerbaijan with an iron fist since 2003, taking over from his father, Heydar Aliyev, who served as president for a decade.\n\nJudge Rizvan Yusupov of Tatarstan's Supreme Court, who upheld the extension of the pretrial arrest of RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva in June, may lose his position after he confirmed reports that his children have U.S. citizenship.\n\nYusupov confirmed to the Regnum news agency on August 30 that his children are dual Russian-American citizens, hours after the Mash Telegram channel, which is close to Russia's law enforcement structures, said the judge hid the information about his daughter and son, who were born in the United States after his wife traveled there to give birth.\n\nThe couple reportedly claimed that the births were home deliveries in Kazan and then arranged for their citizenships through the U.S. Consulate, without informing Russian authorities.\n\nYusupov confirmed that a probe has been launched into his children's U.S. passports but insisted that he had provided Russian authorities with information about the dual citizenships.\n\n\"A criminal case was launched against [Yusupov's] wife, Elvira, and her 19-year-old son Gayaz on a charge of hiding the information about another country's passport. It is known that the judge's elder daughter Nailya resides in the Netherlands,\" Mash reported.\n\nKurmasheva, a dual Russian-U.S. citizen who was released in early August in a major prisoner swap between Russia and the West, was detained in June last year while waiting for her return flight to Prague from Kazan. Authorities confiscated both of her passports and her phone. She was released but barred from leaving the country.\n\nAfter five months of waiting for a decision in her case, Kurmasheva was fined 10,000 rubles ($109) for failing to register her U.S. passport with Russian authorities.\n\nUnable to leave Russia without her travel documents, Kurmasheva in October was arrested, jailed, and charged with being an undeclared \"foreign agent.\" Two months later, she was charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military.\n\nIn July, a court in Tatarstan’s capital, Kazan, sentenced Kurmasheva to 6 1/2 years in prison.\n\nOn August 1, she was released along with two other U.S. citizens -- Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan.\n\nPRAGUE -- European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on August 30 for a greater European commitment to security and overcoming past unwillingness to provide for its own defense, repeatedly citing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as evidence the bloc must shed “illusions” and “think about our union as intrinsically a security project.”\n\nSpeaking in the Czech capital to attendees of the annual Globsec security conference, the returning head of the European Union’s executive arm laid out a staunch case for European solidarity against Russian and other threats and a “systemic overhaul of European defense,” warning that the next half of the decade would be “high risk.”\n\n“If we want true peace, we must fundamentally rethink the foundations of Europe’s security architecture,” von der Leyen said. “Russia’s invasion has been an eye-opener for Europe.”\n\nThe 65-year-old German von der Leyen, who was endorsed for a fresh five-year term in July, vowed to appoint the bloc’s first “full-fledged defense commissioner” to the incoming European Commission, whose respective nominations from each of the 27 member states are ongoing.\n\nSubscribe To RFE/RL's 'The Rundown'\n\nGet a curated digest of all our essential news, features, and analysis, plus our best visual journalism, in your inbox every day.

The answer to when it’s time for talks, she said, is “first and foremost up to our Ukrainian friends.”\n\nRussian forces currently control about one-fifth of Ukrainian territory, but Ukrainian troops now claim to control more than 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory since a surprise Ukrainian incursion in Kursk began last month.\n\nWhile she specifically cited “many outside Europe” for urging immediate talks, it also appeared to be a swipe at EU member Hungary, whose President Viktor Orban’s self-styled and uncoordinated “peace mission” to Kyiv, Moscow, and Beijing immediately after Budapest took up the rotating European Council Presidency in July infuriated Brussels.\n\n“We want the war to stop as soon as possible,” von der Leyen said. But, she added, “My position is that peace is not simply the absence of war. Peace is a settlement that makes war impossible and unnecessary. Therefore, we must put Ukraine in the condition of negotiating such peace.”\n\nInvoking bitter Cold War memories, von der Leyen warned against blaming Kyiv for Russia’s unprovoked invasion. She asked whether Hungary or then-Czechoslovakia could be blamed for invasions of those countries by Soviet and Warsaw Pact troops in 1956 and 1968.\n\n“And the answer to this question is very clear,” she said. “The Kremlin’s behavior was illegal and atrocious back then, and the Kremlin’s behavior is illegal and atrocious today.”\n\nVon der Leyen said that Europeans have many different histories and speak in many languages, “But in no language is peace synonymous with surrender; in no language is sovereignty synonymous with occupation.”\n\n“So those who argue to stop support for Ukraine do not argue for peace,” she said, “they argue for appeasement and subjugation of Ukraine.”\n\nVon der Leyen said one of the lessons of Russia’s attack on Ukraine and its international response was that “Europe has overcome its long-standing unwillingness to spend enough on its own defense.”\n\nShe emphasized the strength and importance of U.S. support and transatlantic cooperation but said “protecting Europe is first and foremost Europe’s duty.”\n\nVon der Leyen said EU member states’ collective defense spending had shot up “from just over 200 billion euros before the war to almost 300 billion [euros] this year.”\n\nShe said aim must be “to build a continent-sized defense output” and “a systemic overhaul of Europe’s defense.”\n\n“We Europeans must be on guard,” von der Leyen said. “We must refocus our attention on the security dimension of everything we do. We must think about our union as intrinsically a security project.\"\n\nAt the same conference, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service that “we have a duty to remind people what is at stake…[and] what can happen if a just peace is not achieved, if the war ends with Russia’s victory not Ukraine’s.”\n\nHe noted Russia’s actions in its lightning war in Georgia in 2008, leaving it effectively occupying about one-fifth of Georgian territory, and the invasion of Crimea in 2014 that ushered in a slow-boiling war that exploded into full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nAsked whether the European Union has learned from such past mistakes, Landsbergis said: “It can happen, yes. That chapter is not yet written.”\n\nVon der Leyen welcomed the chance to speak in the Czech capital, praising Central Europe’s competitiveness and “impressive strength” and noting the region’s past concerns about Russian actions.\n\n“Since Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, you have become the beating heart of solidarity,” von der Leyen said of the region.\n\nThe three-day Globsec security conference, which has been held in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, for the past 18 years, brings together European and global leaders and other senior officials and continues in Prague through September 1.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) on August 29 condemned the decision by the Kyrgyz Supreme Court to reject an appeal by the independent investigative website Kloop of a lower court ruling to liquidate the media outlet.\n\nThe initial decision by a court in Bishkek ordering the closure of the Kloop Media Public Foundation was made in early February. The court said then that the group's website was distributing \"false information aimed at damaging the reputation of Kyrgyz officials.\"\n\n\"The forced shuttering of international award-winning investigative outlet Kloop is a shameful episode in the history of modern Kyrgyzstan -- a country long viewed as a haven for press freedom in Central Asia -- and is a clear indication that under President [Sadyr] Japarov this reputation no longer holds,\" Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, said.\n\n\"Kyrgyz authorities should immediately reverse their repressive course against the media and allow Kloop and all other independent outlets to work freely.\"\n\nThe CPJ's statement came hours after Kloop reported that its staff learned last week that the Supreme Court on July 16 had upheld a lower court's ruling to shut down the outlet. Kloop has now exhausted its chance of appeal.\n\nKloop's co-founder, Rinat Tukhvatshin, said the investigative group will continue to publish \"the deepest investigations, the most balanced news, and the sharpest analyses.\"\n\nSince the initial court ruling in February, the case has wound its way through Kyrgyzstan's judicial circuit.\n\nIn March, the Bishkek Administrative Court canceled the ministry's move to block Kloop's Russian-language site, after which the ministry appealed the ruling to the Bishkek City Court.\n\nIn early June, the Bishkek City Court ruled that a move by Kyrgyzstan's Culture Ministry to shut down Kloop was legitimate.\n\nSeparately, Kloop's Kyrgyz-language website was blocked in November amid a government campaign to pressure the Kloop Media Public Foundation.\n\nThe ministry said it disrupted the sites after the State Committee for National Security (UKMK) claimed that Kloop had distributed false information.\n\nThe claim referred to a report that appeared on Kloop's website in September about jailed opposition politician Ravshan Jeenbekov and a statement he made about being tortured while in custody.\n\nThe ministry demanded Kloop remove an article about the alleged torture of Jeenbekov from its Russian-language website or face being blocked.\n\nKloop refused to remove the material, saying the story in question attributed all information about the situation faced by Jeenbekov while in custody to actual individuals and sources.\n\nKloop said at the time that it was officially informed of the lawsuit against it and that the move was taken after an audit by the UKMK determined its \"published materials are aimed at sharply criticizing the policies of the current government\" and that \"most of the published materials are purely negative, aimed at discrediting representatives of state and municipal bodies.\"\n\nEstablished in June 2007, Kloop is a Kyrgyz news website whose main contributors are students and graduates of the Kloop Media Public Foundation School of Journalism.\n\nAs an independent media entity, it is known for publishing reports on corruption within various governmental bodies and for providing training to Central Asian journalists in fact-checking and investigative techniques.\n\nPRAGUE -- Czech President Petr Pavel on August 30 joined a growing EU chorus urging allies to lift all restrictions on Ukraine’s use of Western-supplied weapons as Kyiv continues its defense against Russia’s full-scale invasion of its much smaller post-Soviet neighbor.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nSpeaking to RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service after the opening of the three-day Globsec security conference in Prague, Pavel, a retired general who also held a senior NATO post, said Ukrainians deserved a freer hand to defend their country.\n\n“I think that what we need is to enable Ukraine to use fully the potential of weapons that Western countries are providing,” Pavel said. “What I mean is not supposing any restrictions on the use of aircraft, missiles, and so on, because Ukraine needs to use them to be successful in self-defense.”\n\nThe 62-year-old Pavel, a former chairman of the Czech General Staff, has been among the most outspoken of EU member state leaders in favor of military and other support for Ukraine since becoming president of his country of around 10 million people in March 2023.\n\nPavel's statements echoed a similar and nearly simultaneous call by the EU’s outgoing foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, to an informal meeting of the bloc’s defense ministers in Brussels. Borrell said Kyiv has the right to target the places from which it is attacked.\n\n\"No one wants\" a war with Russia, he said on August 30 as he headed into the second day of the meeting. \"But put yourself in the shoes of the Ukrainians: The Russians are bombing you from a place you cannot reach. You would like to fight as equals,\" Borrell said, adding that it is \"absurd\" to say allowing targeting on the territory of Russia means waging war directly against Moscow.\n\nUkrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, have repeatedly called on Ukraine's global allies to take \"decisive action\" and allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-provided weapons.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukraine launched an incursion into Russian territory with Zelenskiy saying Russia \"must feel what it has done.\" Russia has responded in recent days with some of its fiercest barrages of missile and drone attacks aimed at cities and critical civilian infrastructure across Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian officials say that despite deliveries of new weapons that are helping bolster the fight, their armed forces are still at a disadvantage because the West's restrictions keeping Ukraine from using long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russian territory.\n\n\"Long-term security for Europe begins with short-term, bold decisions for Ukraine,\" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told journalists in Brussels before a meeting of EU foreign ministers on August 29.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:09 0:00\n\nThe United States and other major suppliers of Ukraine’s war effort have been reluctant to allow the use of longer-range weapons, including portable rocket launchers, in situations that could provoke Russia into a major escalation.\n\nUnder growing pressure from other NATO countries that signaled openness to wider latitude for Kyiv, U.S. officials said in May that President Joe Biden had given Ukraine the go-ahead to use U.S. weapons to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending the eastern city of Kharkiv.\n\nOther similar moves have followed and coincided with the activation of Western-provided F-16s with Western-trained Ukrainian pilots.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told a gathering of NATO foreign ministers on May 30 that allies should consider lifting restrictions on the use of NATO weapons by Ukraine to hit targets on Russian territory.\n\nEarlier this year, with Kyiv complaining of delays in supplies of weapons and ammunition, the Czech Republic led an initiative with Pavel’s vocal support to supply up to 1.5 million pieces of artillery ammunition. Fifteen countries joined the ongoing initiative.\n\nPavel, who chaired the NATO Military Committee, a main policy and strategy advisory body to the alliance’s secretary-general, from 2015-18, said at Globsec that he believed Russia’s reportedly rapid recent advance near the strategic Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk was not linked to Ukraine's use of thousands of troops to launch an incursion last month into Russia’s southern Kursk region. He said any Russian success there was more likely a result of favorable weather.\n\nKyiv has suggested it controls more than 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory and that it could be a bargaining chip in future peace negotiations.\n\nGermany has followed through on its announcement that it would deport \"criminal\" Afghan refugees and asylum seekers back to Afghanistan despite not having formal relations with the Taliban’s de-facto government.\n\nA plane carrying 28 Afghan men convicted of crimes in Germany took off from Leipzig/Halle Airport for Kabul early on August 30, according to German officials. The men had been transported from across the country to Leipzig for the flight, which was arranged by the Interior Ministry.\n\nA senior official from the Taliban's Transportation and Civil Aviation Ministry, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed to Radio Azadi that they had given approval for a plane flying from Leipzig to land at Kabul International Airport. The official declined to provide any details regarding the passengers onboard the aircraft, which was expected to arrive in Kabul in the evening.\n\nAll of the deportees aboard the chartered Qatar Airways flight were \"convicted offenders who had no right to stay in Germany and against whom deportation orders had been issued,\" government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said in a statement.\n\nHebestreit said Berlin had \"asked key regional partners for support in order to facilitate the deportations,\" without providing further details.\n\nA spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry said on August 30 that Germany had no intention of normalizing its relations with the Taliban.\n\n\"As long as the general conditions are as they are and the Taliban behave the way they do, there will be no effort to normalize relations with the Taliban,\" the spokesperson said. \"There are contacts on a technical level, especially through our representative office in Doha.\"\n\nGermany's Der Spiegel magazine said the operation followed two months of \"secret negotiations\" in which Qatar, which has sustainable contacts with the Taliban authorities, served as an intermediary between Germany and the Taliban-led government.\n\nThe controversial development comes after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced in June that Germany would restart deportations of dangerous criminals and terror suspects to Afghanistan and Syria.\n\nScholz's announcement came after an Afghan refugee was charged in a deadly knife attack in the city of Mannheim in May. This week, after a Syrian refugee suspected of killing three people in Solingen was taken into custody, Scholz vowed to speed up deportations.\n\nThe issue has also become a major topic of debate ahead of regional elections on September 1 in the Saxony and Thuringia regions, where anti-immigration parties are expected to do well.\n\nGermany emerged as a major destination for Afghans fleeing insecurity and poverty at home and, after the Taliban retook power after nearly 20 years of war against a U.S.-led coalition, the prospect of persecution by the hard-line Islamist group.\n\nFollowing the Taliban takeover in 2021, Germany halted deportations to Afghanistan and, like all countries, has refused to recognize the Taliban-led government and has no formal relations with it.\n\nGermany is also a major destination for Syrians seeking to escape that country's civil war and rule under leader Bashar al-Assad. Syrians are the largest refugee group in Germany, with hundreds of thousands allowed into the country since 2015.\n\nIn 2020, Germany allowed a ban on deportations to Syria that had been in place since 2012 to expire.\n\nThe backlash against refugees and asylum-seekers rose significantly among conservative and hard-right politicians after a 25-year-old Afghan was accused of stabbing a German police officer to death and injuring five others in May.\n\nIn June, Scholz met with leaders of Germany’s 16 states in Berlin to discuss restarting deportations of Afghan and Syrian immigrants convicted of serious crimes.\n\nMichael Stuebgen, the interior minister of the eastern state of Brandenburg, argued that Germany could engage in talks with the Taliban and that parts of Syria are secure enough to allow the returns of refugees.\n\nIn lieu of relations with the Taliban, Interior Ministry officials reportedly considered the possibility of routing Afghan deportees through third countries such as Uzbekistan and also discussed ways of conducting asylum proceedings in third countries.\n\nOpponents argue that deportations of Afghans and Syrian refugees would go against the German Constitution and commitments under international law and that the outsourcing of asylum procedures would violate asylum-seekers' human rights.\n\nAmnesty International Germany on August 30 harshly criticized the resumption of deportations.\n\n\"The rule of law also means adhering to international law,\" the rights watchdog said on X. \"Extrajudicial executions, disappearances, and torture are the order of the day in Afghanistan. No one is safe there. If the German government deports people anyway it risks becoming an accomplice of the Taliban.\"\n\nAs the issue heated up in recent months, the Interior Ministry stressed that the deportations would affect only a small number of people.\n\nThe German government did not provide details on the crimes for which the 28 Afghans deported on August 30 had been convicted. However, AFP quoted the Justice Ministry of the Baden-Wuerttemberg state reportedly said one was convicted of participating in a gang rape of a 14-year old girl and another had more than 160 criminal convictions.\n\nFollowing news that the deportation of Afghans had resumed, Green party co-leader Omid Nouripour was quoted as saying he welcomed the effort to expel serious criminals but said it did not signal the start of large-scale deportations.\n\n\"Law-abiding people, especially families and children who have fled from radical Islamists,\" are protected in Germany, he said.\n\nWith reporting by AP and AFP\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on August 29 that he stands fully behind the decision to grant citizenship to Pavel Durov, a day after the Telegram co-founder and CEO was indicted in Paris on charges of failing to control illegal content on the popular messaging app.\n\nMacron, speaking in Belgrade at the start of a two-day state visit, said granting Durov citizenship was part of a strategy to enable star athletes, performers, and other foreigners who learned French to become French citizens.\n\n“I granted citizenship to Durov, who learned French, just as I did for some athletes and artists, and I think that's something good for our country. I will continue to do that every time,” Macron said.\n\nDurov, 39, was detained at Le Bourget airport outside Paris over the weekend and he was charged on August 28 with several crimes related to alleged illicit activity on the messaging app.\n\nFrench prosecutors accuse Durov of complicity in allowing drug trafficking and the sharing of sexual images of children on Telegram, and of refusing to share documents demanded by authorities investigating illegal activity on the app.\n\nThe Russian-born Durov, who also has citizenship in Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Caribbean archipelago of St. Kitts and Nevis, was granted conditional release on a bail of 5 million euros ($5.5 million) and on the condition that he report to a police station twice a week as well as remain in France, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement.\n\nThe French president said he didn’t know Durov was coming to France and that he didn’t invite him to visit.\n\n“I don't know anything more about it, and it's normal that I don't know because we are a state governed by the rule of law, where state institutions are independent,\" Macron said at a press conference in Belgrade after meeting with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.\n\nThe question arose after French media reports said that Durov told police upon his arrest on August 24 that he was planning to meet with Macron.\n\nDurov's lawyer said it was \"absurd\" to suggest his client could be implicated in any crime committed on the app.\n\n\"Telegram complies in all respects with European rules concerning digital technology,\" lawyer David-Olivier Kaminski said.\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned France against turning the case into \"political persecution,\" emphasizing that Durov is a \"Russian citizen\" and \"we will be watching what happens next.\"\n\nThat is likely to be that the case will be sent to trial. The charge of \"complicity in the administration of an online platform to enable an illicit transaction\" alone carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years and a fine of 500,000 euros ($550,000).\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine confirmed that an F-16 fighter jet crashed while repelling a missile and drone strike by the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine.\n\nThe General Staff said in a Facebook post on August 29 that Ukrainian F-16s engaged in an air battle against the Russian barrage and shot down four enemy cruise missiles.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n\"During the approach to the next target, contact was lost with one of the planes. As it turned out later, the plane crashed, the pilot died,\" the military said on August 29 on Facebook.\n\nA special commission of the Defense Ministry has been appointed to determine the causes of the accident, the General Staff said.\n\nSabrina Singh, deputy spokeswoman for the Pentagon, said she had seen the reports about the crash of the F-16, adding that she was not aware of any request for assistance since the incident. She told a briefing that she had no further information, but added that pilots have been training in the United States and referred to the difficulties they face once in battle.\n\n\"I will say, broadly speaking, combat aviation is very complex,\" Singh said. \"We are very proud to train pilots here in the United States, and our allies are also training pilots for Ukraine. Everyday they fly these aircraft. There are brave men and women who defend the skies.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force reported that the pilot was Oleksiy Mes and said he died while repelling a massive Russian strike. During the air battle, three cruise missiles and one drone were destroyed, the air force said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported that an F-16 was destroyed in a crash on August 26. An unidentified U.S. official quoted by the newspaper said that, although the incident occurred during a massive Russian missile barrage, initial reports indicated that the jet wasn’t shot down by enemy fire, and it was likely crashed as a result of pilot error.\n\nCNN reported, however, that according to sources, the Ukrainian military does not believe that pilot error was the cause of the incident. The investigation into the crash is ongoing, and international experts will be invited to participate in it.\n\nEarlier on August, the Netherlands said it allowed the use of F-16s it donated to Ukraine to be used on Russian territory.\n\n\"We have not imposed any restrictions on the use and range of the F-16s, provided that the laws of war are observed,\" General Onno Eichelsheim, the commander of the Dutch armed forces, told public broadcaster NOS.\n\nSpeaking from the United States, Eichelsheim said his American colleagues \"partly\" agreed with his position. The Netherlands has pledged 24 F-16s to Ukraine, with the first due to arrive soon. Eichelsheim declined to say if any are currently in operation.\n\nSweden's Migration Agency says it will revise asylum applications filed by Belarusian citizens amid criticism that it had made decisions based on erroneous information and ignored an ongoing crackdown on dissent and democratic institutions in Belarus.\n\nSveriges Radio quoted Anna Lindblad of the Migration Agency on August 29 as saying \"we are aware of the information and criticism directed at us.\"\n\nSwedish Migration Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard told RFE/RL in a message sent by her press service that the her ministry \"will conduct a legal review this autumn regarding the handling of cases from asylum seekers from Belarus.\"\n\n\"I will refrain from further comments on the matter until I have reviewed the results,\" the minister said.\n\n\"Questions regarding the Swedish government’s foreign policy is kindly directed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\" the minister's response to RFE/RL's query said.\n\nA day earlier, RFE/RL's Belarusian Service reported that a Belarusian man was arrested last week at the Lithuanian-Belarusian border after Swedish authorities rejected his asylum application and deported him to Belarus. His current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nZmitser Vaserman, who represents a Belarusian group in exile known as the People's Embassy of Belarus, told RFE/RL on August 29 that the Migration Agency's decision to revise Belarusians' asylum applications this autumn was made before the news about the Belarusian man's arrest following his deportation by Sweden broke a day earlier.\n\nAccording to Vaserman, his group revived its talks with the Migration Agency in July after noted Belarusian opposition activist Kanstantsin Syarohin's asylum application was rejected again.\n\n\"[Syarohin's] case confirmed that despite the information on the current situation in Belarus updated in February to properly reflect the reality of mass terror in the country, the Migration Agency continues to support its previously made rulings in courts,\" Vaserman said.\n\nVaserman added that it was important that Sweden update the information but stressed that the process of decision-making on asylum applications filed by Belarusian citizens must be held with a moratorium in place on the deportation of Belarusian citizens. This would prevent the deportation of those whose applications have been denied, he said.\n\nEarlier in August, Vaserman said at the New Belarus conference that more than 100 Belarusians applied for political asylum in Sweden and only three received it. Vaserman said then that many filed appeals against denials, while some moved to other countries to seek asylum there.\n\nFollowing the disputed August 2020 presidential election in Belarus that gave authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka a sixth presidential term, mass pro-democracy demonstrations broke out across the country.\n\nThe demonstrations were brutally suppressed. In the ensuing years, officials have imprisoned hundreds of demonstration participants, often holding leading activists in near-complete isolation and denying many prisoners adequate medical care.\n\nThe Specialized Inter-District Court in Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty, on August 29 sentenced the already imprisoned ex-wife of a convicted nephew of the Central Asian nation's former authoritarian president, Nursultan Nazarbaev, to 12 years in prison.\n\nGulmira Satybaldy was found guilty of forcibly holding her relative and former business partner Abai Zhunusov in isolation against his will for 165 days in 2019 to force him to give up his stakes in several businesses.\n\nHer former driver Madi Batyrshaev was convicted of assisting to forcibly hold a person in isolation and sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nSatybaldy is concurrently serving two sentences -- eight years for embezzlement and the illegal appropriation of shares and assets of several enterprises, and seven years for abduction and actions aiding the commission of a crime.\n\nThe sentences were handed down by a court in May and June last year.\n\nThe court ruled that Satybaldy must serve the new 12-year sentence concurrently, meaning that the total time to be spent in prison by Satybaldy would be 12 years.\n\nGulmira Satybaldy was arrested along with her ex-husband Qairat Satybaldy in March 2022. He was tried separately in September 2023 and sentenced to six years in prison after being found guilty of fraud and embezzlement.\n\nOn August 16, a court in Kazakhstan's eastern city of Oskemen replaced Qairat Satybaldy's six-year prison sentence with a suspended sentence.\n\nCourt No. 2 in the capital of the East Kazakhstan region ruled on August 16 that Qairat Satybaldy must be released with a suspended 40-month sentence, saying the once powerful businessman and politician had returned all the money he was accused of embezzling to the State Treasury.\n\nThe probes launched against the couple were part of a series of investigations targeting relatives and allies of Nazarbaev following unprecedented anti-government protests that turned into deadly mass disorders in early January 2022.\n\nAfter the deadly events, the Kazakh regime began to quietly target Nazarbaev, his family, and other allies, many of whom held powerful or influential posts in government, security agencies, and profitable energy companies.\n\nWith reporting by Vlast.kz"
