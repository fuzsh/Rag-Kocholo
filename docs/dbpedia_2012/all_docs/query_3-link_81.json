        "text": "After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russian authorities ruthlessly escalated repression and censorship of free speech. They adopted new censorship laws which, among other things, criminalized “dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of Russian Armed Forces,” and set out penalties ranging from fines to up to 15 years in prison.\n\nBy mid-July 2022, Russian human rights defenders reported that authorities had launched at least 70 criminal cases on such charges. The risk of criminal prosecutions forced the closure of what remained of independent media outlets in Russia, and the exile of numerous human rights activists, independent journalists, and critics. New laws ban “public actions aimed at discrediting” the Russian Armed Forces or other government agencies abroad. Hundreds of administrative cases have been opened, and new administrative and criminal cases are being opened every day. Repeat offenses may trigger criminal prosecution and imprisonment.\n\nRussian law enforcement has detained thousands of peaceful protesters on these charges. In May 2022, the first criminal case was opened against a “repeated offender” for social media posts. Russian authorities also use other laws to punish critical speech about the war.\n\nBelow are examples of the extremely broad range of legitimate, peaceful speech or actions that have triggered criminal charges and administrative penalties.\n\nSergey Dratovanyy was prosecuted in Surgut on March 10 for misuse of the epithet “Z,” which the government has made into a propaganda symbol of support for the war against Ukraine. He was fined 40,000 rubles (US$600) for the following comment he made in a Vkontakte group: “[T]he sign Z on Russian armor and vehicles means shitheads [засранцы], Russian military personnel eat expired dry rations during the special military operation in Ukraine, all the forests in Ukraine have already been crapped all over [обосраны] because of them.”\n\nOn April 1, a Russian court in occupied Crimea fined Lidiya Pronina 30,000 (US$450) rubles for expressing her opposition to the war at a farmers’ market. According to the court ruling, she “praised the leadership, politicians and journalists of Ukraine, namely Zelensky, Gordon, Arestovich”, “publicly accused the leadership of the Russian Federation, including the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, of fascism, and said that all Russian troops should burn in their tanks so that they do not return home [and] insulted the President of the Russian Federation using obscene language.”\n\nOn March 25, a court in Vsevolozhsk, Leningrad region fined Andrey Kopchikov 30,000 rubles (US$450) for “public action discrediting the armed forces” for sending a WhatsApp message stating: “I will destroy everyone who contributes to the Putin regime, even with their thoughts. I made up my mind that…. for me this is a war, my war and I took a side in it and … for me Ukraine is my homeland. I hate how my brothers and sisters are being killed by the Putin regime”. Kopchikov sent the message to one individual, who then forwarded it.\n\nGorinov holding a sign that says, “I am against war.” Photo © July 2022 private\n\nAleksey Gorinov, a member of the Krasnoselsky Municipal Council in Moscow, was detained on April 26 for delivering an anti-war speech during the council's March 15 meeting. In July, a court sentenced him to 7 years of prison and 4 years of deprivation of the right to hold positions in government and municipal agencies. He is being denied medical treatment for a preexisting health condition."
