        "text": "Guys from Moscow-London’s “Institute for Identity” got a grant (1.300.00 RUB = 20.850 USD) for developing the city’s style. The aim was to represent the city’s uniqueness and emphasise its cultural identity, mended by its history, geography, industry and people. Designers summarised the suggested concept in the following lines, which I roughly translated into English\n\n«I am the frontier. I am the point of departure. Follow! The outer space is online. There are no routes and schedules. Irkutsk is on full battery. Action. Activation. Revitalisation. All my particles work at maximum power. Electricity is over the edge from each cell towards the will. I am at the Sun. I see the Earth. I see myself in a big world. I am the element. I see no shores. I am charged. The city of wild ideas, aspirations, discoveries, bursting wires, icebergs, fireworks and rage. The city of carnivals, flying cars and airplanes. We are stars. To be, not to pretend. To hit, not to touch. Available, new, simple avant-garde. Always on the move, sharp, alive. This is the territory of experiments, of miracles. The border with no borders and limitations. Beyond coordinates, dimensions, rules and opinions. Switch in!»\n\nAccording to Xueke Yang, the idea of city branding took its most iconic expression in the case of Glasgow, when the concept of tourism for consumption of industrial heritage was materialised in its best. City branding serves as a tool for attracting new ideas, flows of people, tourists, investments. It creates a new object of consumption, it reinvents the essence of the city. In the end, it serves the needs and purposes of capitalism. Oftentimes, the reinvented city idea has little to do with what its inhabitants perceive of their homeland.\n\nNo doubt, the city branding exercise involves application of cultural violence. If we understand violence in a broad sense, as any coercion and subjugation that disturbs diverse modes of living, experiencing space, and making sense of it, we can assume that it is intrinsic to city branding, especially in a way performed in the case of Irkutsk.\n\nThe designers acknowledged that they talked to the city dwellers, and they put a lot of thought in conceptualising what it means to be from Irkutsk. They put a lot of effort in order to grasp the city’s authenticity, but the violence is done on the level of framework. It is not the message, it is its delivery that disrupts the rhythm of authenticity. The language of the city brand did not resonate with many people’s cultural feelings. In the comments under the news on the presentation of the project, users mentioned that similar projects are made in PC classes in primary school, and that the style is overall too psychedelic to represent the city. Designers extracted key messages from the interviews with the locals, then they digested and deconstructed them, applied pieces of meanings, taken out of the context, on post-modern hype canvas, and returned them to the public. Application of this alien, Moscow-London’s ways of imagining and of information production on perception of Irkutsk’s identity by locals produced tensions, disappointment and anger. In the end, who owns the city and who has the right to reproduce its images for the market? Those, who have money and resources to do so, or those, who exercise these cultural city identities daily?\n\nOn the other hand, does city branding necessarily need to represent local sentiments of belonging? Brand, in the best case scenario, is a simplification of cultural essence of the space. At times it can be a completely fictional idea of space, imposed identity, mended by what is deemed stylish and attractive by dominant discourse. It is an attractive hashtag, that tourists would want to put under their selfies. Branding necessarily involves categories, pieces of meanings, boxes, tags. In other words, branding provides tools for construction of own cultural identity, but it avoids direct messages and full stories. This is needed for long lasting consumption of such tools. They need to be adaptable to new trends and cheap. Branding destroys cultural nucleus, brings it up to the requirements of the dominant discourse, and makes it consumable.\n\nTo me, the new brand of Irkutsk does not even look original. Still, there are a few critics who happened to be quite fond of the new style. For example, Denis Gook saw in it an embodiment of good quality, and visualised tourists flooding Irkutsk, wanting to buy something in “RGB” style. If I had to situate this style somewhere, I would probably place it along Gosha Rubchinskiy’s fashion trends: acid colours, simplicity of design, and Post-Soviet imaginaries.\n\nI can imagine that new city’s brand would probably do the trick and attract new ideas and people to the urban space. Still, I believe that there can be less violent ways of reimagining the city. If there was a scale, where at one end there would be converting the city culture into the object of mass consumption, and on the other end, treating the city’s heritage and cultural sentiments of its people with care, Irkutsk’s city branding by Institute for Identity would probably be closer to the former. To my mind, it doesn’t have to be “either or” question. We do not have to sacrifice cultural legacy for the sake of tourism and investments’ boost. There are cooperative peaceful ways of developing and crystallising the city’s image, that do not involve dumping enormous amount of money into the hands of a “cool” design company, so it would make the city look “cool”. Cities are made cool by its people. We should let the people talk.\n\nI like how Laura Sisteró provided a vision of Tolyatti by talking to the local youth and seeing the larger urban dynamics through the prism of their hobby. I will end this messy post with a teaser of her documentary."
