Additionally, it aims to bolster the exportation of military, specialized, civilian, and dual-use products, aligning with the evolving landscape of military-technical cooperation between Russia and other nations.\n\nMikheev said the expansion of partnership with Russian regions is a major area in ROSOBORONEXPORT's activities.\n\n“In particular, we are actively cooperating with the IAZ Irkutsk Aviation Plant (part of the United Aircraft Corporation), a flagship of aircraft industry in the Irkutsk Region. The colossal design and production experience of IAZ aircraft manufacturers, who will celebrate the 90th anniversary of the plant in August, is also in demand abroad: IAZ products have been supplied to 40 countries around the world over the years,” he said.\n\nMikheev noted that “today, this plant is increasing its capacity and implementing projects in the framework of both State Defence Order and the Military Technical Cooperation by modernizing and manufacturing the latest Su-30 multifunctional fighters and Yak-130 training (combat training) aircraft. Since 2001, a total of 400+ Su-30s and Yak-130s have joined the Air Forces of a dozen countries, and ROSOBORONEXPORT's current order book includes about 50 such aircraft.\"\n\nAmong the areas of cooperation defined by the signed deal are the development of target programs to increase exports, assistance in conducting applied research on the development and production of advanced high-tech export-oriented products and technologies, the development of measures to support organizations involved in military-technical cooperation, including those affected by sanctions from unscrupulous foreign states, ensuring legal protection of the results of intellectual activity abroad and much more.\n\nKobzev, for his part, said: “The Government of the Irkutsk Region strives to expand the export opportunities of local enterprises, promotes innovative projects to foreign markets, and attracts local organizations to participate in international exhibitions.”\n\n“This agreement will contribute to the further economic and social development of the Irkutsk Region, which is one of the largest and most promising regions of Russia, with extensive natural resources, scientific, industrial and innovative potential,” Kobzev highlighted, adding that a large volume of their products in ROSOBORONEXPORT’s order book indicates their high quality and competitiveness of the region's enterprise.\n\nAs per the terms outlined in the agreement, both parties commit to facilitating collaboration by allowing representatives from ROSOBORONEXPORT to partake in meetings of advisory bodies under the Government of the Irkutsk Region, while representatives from the regional government will similarly have access to meetings of ROSOBORONEXPORT's advisory bodies, particularly on matters of mutual concern."
