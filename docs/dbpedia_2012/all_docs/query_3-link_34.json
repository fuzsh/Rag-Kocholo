        "text": "4.1âIISR features when determining characteristics of the ionospheric plasma\n\nMost of the time, the IISR is operated in ionospheric mode (Potekhin et al.,Â 2008). The principal feature of the Irkutsk radar is the capability to transmit and receive only linear field polarization. When propagating in the ionospheric plasma from the Earth's external magnetic field, electromagnetic waves experience the Faraday rotation. Thus, there occurs a factor of the wave polarization plane dependence on the rotation angle in the radiolocation equation for the Irkutsk radar. This angle, in turn, is determined by integral electron content along the propagation path. At the IISR, this feature is seen as a fading in the vertical power profile of received signals. On the one hand, this factor creates a considerable complication in solving the reverse task of determining plasma temperatures, but on the other hand, it can be used to determine absolute values of electron density on the entire vertical profile (Shpynev, 2004). In this task, the critical element, which determines consistency of the electron density profile restoration method from sounding data, is the procedure of deconvolution of the IR signal power profile with the sounding signal. The procedure is ambiguous, and its stability under high-noise conditions is not always sufficient. With respect to the IISR, this procedure can be avoided if the altitude resolution is better than 5âkm. This task was accomplished when new equipment was brought in at the Irkutsk radar. This equipment can generate signals with the required type of modulation, detect the entire sounding information, and conduct suspended processing of signals using software tools. Mathematical modelling of the ionospheric reaction with realistic parameters to coded signals of different shapes (Alsatkin et al.,Â 2009) made it possible to identify the main types of signals that provide the best possible accuracy in recovery of the density profile in different geophysical conditions, and to develop methods to automatically select the type of probing signal and processing method. This work resulted in an automated process of measuring the vertical electron density profiles in real time, which worked steadily in the range of NmF2 values 2Ã105â2Ã106ââcmâ3. FigureÂ 8 demonstrates an example for the period of 12â15 January 2013. FigureÂ 8a shows power profiles of IS signals measured with an optimal code sequence of 150â200âÂµs total duration after coordinated processing. Note that there is a distinct separation of maxima and minima that do not require additional deconvolution with the sounding signal. FigureÂ 8b shows electron density profiles related to these measurements. The profiles were obtained using the automated procedure. FigureÂ 8c shows time variability of electron density at the heights of 250âkm (blue line) and 325âkm (red line), which approximately correspond to the heights of the day and night ionization maxima.\n\nDownload\n\nThe processing of long data series for vertical electron density profiles in different seasons and at various levels of solar activity revealed some interesting peculiarities in the electron content behavior above the altitude of the ionization maximum (Zherebtsov et al.,Â 2017).\n\nAnother IISR feature distinguishing it from similar radars and adding further difficulties to the signal processing procedure is the frequency principle of scanning. The IISR emission direction depends on the carrier frequency. When horizontal ionization gradients occur in the plane of scan, this fact can cause distortion of the IS signal spectrum and make it asymmetrical. In this case, the ÎE asymmetry parameter is related to the horizontal gradient of the electron density âNe/âx along the scanning axis with âNe/âx=ÎEâ Ne/(2ÎFRÎ¾) , where ÎF is the IS spectrum half-width, R is a slant distance, and Î¾=6.5Ã10-5 âradâkHzâ1 is the coefficient of the AP inclination angle dependence on frequency (Potekhin et al.,Â 2008). This IISR feature can also lead to a scenario where discrete space radio sources, which pass through the antenna pattern, will also regularly contribute to the spectrum asymmetry (by adding a variable-frequency noise component). In view of this IISR feature, a procedure was developed for analytical separation of the asymmetry coefficient ÎÎµ and Doppler shift of the IS spectrum Î©dop. Shcherbakov et al.Â (2009) show that the procedure implies minimizing the functional in the form\n\nFÎ©dopÎÎµ=âk=1nÎ©dopâ Ïk+ÎÎµâ tanÏk-Ïk2,\n\nwhere Ïk is the experimental autocorrelation function (ACF) lag and Ïk is the ACF phase.\n\nFigureÂ 9 presents the derived plasma drift velocity versus time. The blue line shows the plasma drift at 250âkm altitude, and the red line at 350âkm.\n\nDownload\n\nBased on this method, a technique was developed to calculate the neutral wind meridional component from the IISR data (Shcherbakov et al.,Â 2015).\n\nAn important issue in studies of the ionospheric plasma is the use of special methods to increase the spatial resolution without losing spectral resolution. Due to significant frequency dependence of the IISR antenna pattern, the use of standard techniques (alternating codes and pseudo-random codes) can lead to large errors. To solve this problem at IRNR, we developed a new sounding mode â the effective subtraction technique (Berngardt and Kushnarev, 2013). It allows us to increase the spatial resolution by combination of narrow-band radio pulses of different duration. This technique allows estimation of the ionospheric data in two modes: with high spatial and low time resolution, and with low spatial and high time resolution. It is possible to use these modes at the same time without changing the operating mode of the radar, only by using different mathematical data processing.\n\n4.3âObservation of space objects with Irkutsk IS radar\n\nSince 2006, the average operation time in ionospheric radar mode has been about 1500âhâyrâ1. Several dozens of space objects (SOs) pass over the IISR antenna AP every hour. On the one hand, the SO is a significant factor of additional noise and distortions during analysis of the space plasma parameters. On the other hand, the observed SOs can be interesting for many fundamental and applied tasks. After modernization, we can now install a special software module at the IISR that can sort out SO signals in real time; see Fig.Â 10 for an example.\n\nDownload\n\nTens of thousands of SO passes are observed in a month of automated ionospheric measurements with the IISR. Data are processed, and the following characteristics are received: range, line-of-sight velocity, azimuth, location angle, and signal-to-noise ratio (Lebedev et al.,Â 2012). The received data are recorded in a database (http://rp.iszf.irk.ru:8080/iisr/spu/, last access: 13Â August 2019). Currently, the database contains information on more than 450â000 passes.\n\nFigureÂ 11 presents the SO altitude distribution recorded with the IISR in 2007â2015. To compare with the catalog prediction, we used the SO orbit two-line element data from the Space-Track website (https://www.space-track.org, last access: 13Â August 2019). According to the catalog, more than 11â000 SOs may pass through the IISR sector. For each of these SOs, we calculated the ephemerid and path characteristics relative to the IISR. As a result, we obtained the altitude distribution of SOs, both observed and calculated from the catalog. These distributions are shown in Fig.Â 12 for 2013â2015. The transparent histograms with black borders present distributions of the observed SOs. According to Fig.Â 12, the number of observed SOs exceeds their calculated number in almost all ranges.\n\nDownload\n\nDownload\n\nIn each series, we have measured the following characteristics: distance (R), line-of-sight velocity (V), azimuth angle (Îµ), space object elevation (Î³), and signal amplitude. When the signal-to-noise ratio is high (S/N>10 ), the typical root mean square deviations for R, V, Îµ, and Î³ are 100âm, 10âmâsâ1, 5âarcmin, and 5âarcmin, respectively. This accuracy is sufficient to determine the space object orbit in the next SO passing over the IISR. Two of six Keplerian elements of the orbit can be determined with high accuracy: inclination and right ascension of the SO ascending node (Lebedev et al.,Â 2012)."
