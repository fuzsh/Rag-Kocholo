The photographs are labeled in Russian.\n\nView the collection\n\nAnnual Reports of the Russian-American Company (23 items)\n\nIn 1799, Emperor Paul I of Russia granted a charter to establish the Russian-American Company. The company was an outgrowth of the Shelikhov-Golikov Company, a fur-trading venture founded in 1783 by Grigorii Ivanovich Shelikhov (1747–95) and Ivan Larionovich Golikov, and of several other companies. In 1784, Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in Alaska, at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island. Although primarily a commercial entity, the Russian-American Company took on the responsibilities of Russian colonial government and became an outpost in the Pacific for the Imperial Court in Saint Petersburg. The focus of the company remained on fur, however, as it maintained some 40 trading locations throughout Alaska. Among the company’s most notable accomplishments was the establishment of Fort Ross in northern California, which was inhabited from 1812–42 and was a center of Russian colonial activity. In 1867, when the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire, ending Russia’s colonial presence in North America, the Russian-American Company was sold to an American business and from 1868 it operated as the Alaska Commercial Company. Throughout its history, the Russian-American Company kept detailed records of its work and published annual reports on its finances, the fur trade, the movement of people from Russia to North America, and company accomplishments. In some years the reports also included maps of new territories explored or new settlements established.\n\nView the collection\n\nAtlas of Kruzenshtern's Circumnavigation (80 items)\n\nIn 1803-06, Captain I. F. Kruzenshtern became the first Russian to circumnavigate the globe. This atlas, published by the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1813, includes maps of Kruzenshtern's route and 109 plates based upon the drawings of V. G. Tilesius, a doctor, naturalist, and the official artist of the expedition. It is one of the largest publications of engravings from tsarist Russia. The subjects depicted include views of Sakhalin, Kamchatka, and the Kurile Islands; representations of Siberian natives and other peoples encountered during the voyage; and local fish and birds from throughout the South and North Pacific.\n\nView the collection\n\nEthnographic Description of the Peoples of Russia (65 items)\n\nDescription ethnographique des peuples de la Russie (Ethnographic description of the peoples of Russia) is a two-volume work published in Saint Petersburg in 1862 to mark the millennium of the founding of the Russian Empire (traditionally traced to the founding of the state of Kievan Rus’ in 862). The work is dedicated to Tsar Alexander II. Volume 1 consists of 62 colored illustrations depicting ethnic groups from across the Russian Empire in their traditional dress. The captions identifying the groups are given in French and Russian. This volume also includes a fold-out table listing the different ethnic groups and the size of their populations in the cities in the empire, as well as a colored-coded ethnographic map that shows which groups inhabited which parts of the empire. Volume 2 is all text, and consists of detailed essays, in French, about the ethnic groups of the empire—their history, culture, language, and so forth—which reflect the state of anthropological and historical knowledge of the 1860s. The book is the work of Gustav-Fedor Pauli (1817–67), a German ethnographer who immigrated to Russia. Pauli’s work was the seminal publication on the ethnic groups that made up the Russian Empire. Pauli also documented the eastward movement of ethnic Russians from European Russia into the Urals and southern Siberia. He was a member of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society and a founding member of the Russian Society for the Protection of Animals.\n\nView the collection\n\nGeographic Card Set of the Russian Empire (80 items)\n\nA souvenir set of illustrated cards–one for each province of the Russian Empire as it existed in 1856. Each card presents an overview of a particular province’s culture, history, economy, and geography. The front of the card depicts such distinguishing features as rivers, mountains, major cities, and chief industries. The back of each card contains a map of the province, the provincial seal, information about the population, and the local costume of the inhabitants.\n\nView the collection\n\nGeographical Atlas of the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Poland, and the Grand Duchy of Finland (61 items)\n\nThe Geograficheskii atlas Rossiiskoi imperii, tsarstva Pol'skogo i velikogo kniazhestva Finliandskogo (Geographical atlas of the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Poland, and the Grand Duchy of Finland), containing 60 maps of the Russian Empire. Compiled and engraved by Colonel V.P. Piadyshev (1758−1835), it reflects the detailed mapping carried out by Russian military cartographers in the first quarter of the 19th century. Each map in the atlas shows population centers, postal stations, roads, and provincial and district borders. Distances are shown in versts, a Russian measure, now no longer used, equal to 1.07 kilometers. Legends and place-names are in Russian and either French, German, Polish, or Swedish.\n\nView the collection\n\nImperial Russian Playing Cards (60 items)\n\nThis early-19th century playing card set consists of 60 cards, each devoted to a different province or territory of the Russian Empire, which at the time included the Grand Duchy of Finland, Congress Poland, and Russian America. One side of each card shows the local costume and the provincial coat of arms; the other side contains a map. This card depicts the Kingdom of Poland, located in part of present-day Poland, and bordered by Prussia to the northwest and the Austrian Empire to the south. Poland lost its independence in the late 18th century, when its territory was partitioned, in three successive stages, by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. In 1815, at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna established the Kingdom of Poland, which was linked to the Russian Empire in a personal union through the person of the Russian tsar. Warsaw, the capital of the kingdom, is situated on the Vistula (Wisła, in Polish) River. The card indicates that the distance from Warsaw to St. Petersburg was 1,303 versts, and from Warsaw to Moscow, 1,253¾ versts. A verst is a Russian measurement of distance, no longer used, equal to 1.0668 kilometers.\n\nView the collection\n\nIrkutsk and Its Surroundings (24 items)\n\nThis album of photographs and prints dating from 1880 shows highlights of the city of Irkutsk and its surrounding region in the late 19th century. Irkutsk was at that time the center of Siberian cultural and intellectual life. The buildings shown include the Museum of Regional Studies, a technical school, orphanage, hotels, and the Church of Our Lady of Kazan. Other photographs in the album show the suburb of Glazkovo and villages in the Irkutsk region, including one on the shores of Lake Baikal. The album also includes photographs of the native Buriat people, who are Buddhist, and the local Buddhist datsan (university monastery). The album contains 20 photographs and, at the end, three prints. The prints are of drawings showing the natural beauty of the region. The subjects of the photographs are recorded in ink on the back of each image.\n\nView the collection\n\nLaunching of the Ice-Breaking Ferry Baikal (7 items)\n\nThis album of six photographs depicts the launch of the icebreaking ferry Baikal at the village of Listvenichnoye on the western shore of Lake Baikal on June 17, 1899. Before completion of the Circum-Baikal Railway in 1905, the lake marked a break in the Trans-Siberian Railway linking European Russia with Vladivostok. To connect the western and eastern portions of the railroad, the committee in charge of the Trans-Siberian decided to purchase an icebreaking ferry capable of shuttling passengers and railroad cars across the lake in winter. A contract was placed with the shipbuilding firm of V.G. Armstrong and Company in Newcastle, United Kingdom. The icebreaker was transported in sections from Newcastle to Listvenichnoye, where it was assembled in 1898–99. After entering service, the ship made two journeys each day across the lake, carrying approximately 300 passengers and crew and up to 27 railroad cars. Following completion of the Circum-Baikal Railway, the Baikal remained in service until 1918. A second and smaller icebreaker, the Angara, entered service on the lake in 1900. Located in eastern Siberia near the Russian border with Mongolia, Lake Baikal is 636 kilometers long; its average width is 48 kilometers (80 kilometers at the widest point). It is the oldest and deepest lake in the world, with a volume of water approximately equal to the total volume of the Great Lakes of North America, or to about 20 per cent of all freshwater on earth.\n\nView the collection\n\nSiberian Postcard Collection (1844 items)\n\nThis collection of Russian postcards from the National Library of Russia spans the years from 1904 to 1983.\n\nView the collection\n\nThe Aleksandrovsky Real School in Tiumen (21 items)\n\nThis album shows photographs of the Aleksandrovsky School in the Siberian city of Tiumen (present-day Tyumen’). The school, which educated young men from the first to the sixth grades, operated from 1879 until 1919. It was founded on the initiative of the governor-general of Siberia, Nikolai Gennadievich Kaznakov (1823‒85). Through a project organized by American journalist and explorer George Kennan (1845‒1924), the school received equipment from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Students at the school were taught Russian, German, and French, various branches of mathematics, history, drawing, and religion. In his book Siberia and the Exile System, published in 1891, Kennan described the school as equal or even superior to the finest schools in the United States and noted its extensive library and museum of natural history. The photographs in the album show the interior and exterior of the building, the students, and the teachers.\n\nView the collection\n\nThe Birobidzhan Album (275 items)\n\nIn the early part of the Stalin era, the Kremlin established a new administrative territory in the Soviet Far East--the Jewish Autonomous Region--to serve as a Jewish homeland. The capital of the region was the city of Birobidzhan. This album includes 274 photographs of the early years of Birobidzhan, beginning in the late 1920s.\n\nView the collection\n\nThe Cheliuskin (311 items)\n\nThe Cheliuskin was a Soviet scientific research vessel that sank in the Chukchi Sea in February 1934 while attempting to sail the Northern Sea Route from Murmansk to the Bering Strait and on to Vladivostok.

It also contains a number of commemorative items, such as matchbox covers and postcards trumpeting the heroic rescue.\n\nView the collection\n\nThe Expedition of Colonel V. M. Vonliarliarsky to the Chukotka Peninsula in 1900 (70 items)\n\nEkspeditsiya polkovnika V.M.Vonlyarlyarskogo na Chukotskiy poluostrov v 1900 godu (The Expedition of Colonel V. M. Vonliarliarsky to the Chukotka Peninsula in 1900) is part of a collection of albums in the Prints Division of the National Library of Russia documenting expeditions to Siberia and the Russian Far East undertaken mostly in the late 19th century. The album, consisting of 69 photographs on 26 sheets, shows scenes from the extreme northeastern part of the Russian Empire, including Provideniia Bay, Seniavine (also seen as Senyavina) Strait, Cape Litke, and Cape Dezhnev. Several photographs depict the expedition’s ship, the Samoa, and members of the expedition. At some point the expedition must have crossed the strait to visit Alaska, at that time a U.S. territory, as several photographs depict the town of Nome.\n\nView the collection\n\nThe Imperial Tomsk University, 1880-1892 (84 items)\n\nImperatorskii Tomskii universitet, 1880‒1892 (The Imperial Tomsk University, 1880‒1892) is an album that documents the formative years of the Imperial Tomsk University (the predecessor of present-day Tomsk State University), the oldest institution of higher learning in Siberia.

The first classes, in the medical faculty, began in 1888. The album contains 83 photographs with interior and exterior views of the university’s buildings, including the main administrative building, lecture halls, dormitories and dining halls, the library, botanical museum, university church, as well as the greenhouse, and the university farm. The album ends with two photographs showing the ceremony at which the cornerstone of the first university building was laid on August 26, 1880. The photographs are preceded by 12 pages of text providing detailed explanations of all the images, as well as several tables. One table contains a list of all the buildings, their dimensions, dates of construction, cost of construction, and other information.\n\nView the collection\n\nThe Journey of P. E. Ostrovsky on the Enisei in 1894 and 1897 (46 items)\n\nPuteshestviya P. Ye. Ostrovskogo na Yenisey v 1894 i 1897 godakh (The journeys of P. E. Ostrovsky on the Yenisei in 1894 and 1897) is part of a collection of albums in the Prints Division of the National Library of Russia documenting expeditions to Siberia and the Russian Far East undertaken mostly in the late 19th century. The album is composed of 40 separate sheets containing 45 separate photographs. The images mostly depict people of the various ethnic groups indigenous to the region, yurts and smaller cultural objects, Russian fishermen and traders, and natural scenery, especially of the Yenisei River. The photographs are captioned in handwritten Russian.\n\nView the collection\n\nThe Vladivostok Port. Works of 1916 (53 items)\n\nVladivostokskii port. Raboty 1916 goda (Vladivostok Port: Views of work, 1916) is an unpublished album showing activities at Russia’s main Far Eastern port in 1916, a year in which Russia was engaged in Europe in fighting Germany and her World War I allies, but in which it continued to invest in the development of the port. The photographs in the album show views of Golden Horn Bay (Bukhta Zolotoy Rog), railroad works, construction and repair work at docks and other port facilities, and numerous ships and barges coming into or docked at the port. Most of the photographs are identified with detailed captions that clearly were written by someone with knowledge of the port and its operations. Vladivostok was founded in 1860 by military officers tasked with creating a new city on Golden Horn Bay. The city subsequently became the Pacific terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railroad.\n\nView the collection\n\nTsarist and Soviet Posters (23 items)\n\nPosters were a popular form of art in the late tsarist and Soviet periods. They have been used for a variety of purposes, including commercial advertising, nationalist slogans, and ideological campaigns. This collection includes tsarist-era advertisements and a set of posters from the era of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5) that contains images reflecting a jingoistic Russian perspective of that war. Other poster topics include polar flights in the 1930s, the Brezhnev-era construction of the Baikal-Amur Mainline (BAM) railroad, and the achievements of Soviet industry in Siberia.\n\nView the collection\n\nTsine-Louine Siberia Postcards Series (36 items)\n\nPostcards became popular in the 1890s in response to demand generated by the growth of tourism. In the case of the Compagnie Tsine-Louine (as it styled itself in French) of St. Petersburg, postcards also were used to help market its product, tea. Based on lithographs by the artists Nikolai Nikolaevich Kazarin and Valerii Pavlovich Ovsiannikov, the company's \"Siberia\" series romanticized the shipping routes from China to Russia. The cards portrayed scenes of natural beauty and native life that might have been encountered on the journey from the Chinese border town of Kiakhta east of Lake Baikal to St. Petersburg. This incomplete series of thirty-six cards is one of many postcard collections in the National Library of Russia.\n\nView the collection\n\nViews and Inhabitants of Sakhalin Island (37 items)\n\nSakhalin Island was used by imperial Russia as a penal colony and place of exile for criminals and political prisoners. Between 1869 and 1906, more than 30,000 inmates and exiles endured the harsh conditions of the forced-labor colony on the island. This album, from the collections of the National Library of Russia, contains photographs taken in the 1890s that provide rare glimpses of Sakhalin's settlements and prisons and the prisoners, exiles, and guards who inhabited the island. The photographs show convicts working and prisoners in leg manacles or with partially shorn hair, most likely administered as punishment for attempts at escape. The album also contains photographs of Ainu people, the indigenous people of the island who also live on the Kurile Islands and in Hokkaido, northern Japan, and of Tungus, another indigenous people settled in eastern Siberia and on Sakhalin Island. The photographer who made the album is believed to have been Innokentii Ignat'evich Pavlovskii (born 1855), the manager of the telegraph station at Dui. Anton Chekhov, the Russian writer and medical doctor, spent three months on Sakhalin in 1890, where he extensively researched the plight of the prisoners and the native population. The publication of his Sakhalin Island in 1895 highlighted the depravity of the situation in this remote corner of Russia and led to public protests that helped bring about the closure of the penal colony.\n\nView the collection\n\nViews of the Buildings, Grounds and Workshops of Chita's Emperor Nicholas II Trade School, 1891, 93, 94, 98 (28 items)\n\nPresented here is an album showing the buildings, grounds, and workshops of the Chita Vocational School. The future Tsar Nicholas II visited the city of Chita in 1891 and on that occasion a government decree was issued providing for establishment of the school. The school opened in 1894, moved into a new building in 1897, and was given the official name of the Emperor Nicholas II Vocational School in 1898. The album features photographs of the inside and outside of the school buildings as well as photographs of the students at work. It ends with a detailed history of the school, signed by the Governor-General of Chita Evgeny Iosifovich Matsievskii (1845‒1910) and the director of the Chita Men’s Gymnasium, Alexei Yelenev. Chita is located in southeastern Siberia, about 630 kilometers east of Irkutsk, where the Chita River flows into the Ingoda River. Its importance increased in the late 19th century when the Trans-Siberian Railroad was routed through the city.\n\nView the collection\n\nViews of the Nerchinsk Hard Labor Camps (75 items)\n\nTipy i vidy Nerchinskoi katorgi (Views and inhabitants of the Nerchinsk hard labor camps) is an album of 74 photographs taken by Aleksei Kirillovich Kuznetsov (1845‒1928) in July 1891. The Nerchinsk katorga was part of the katorga (forced labor) system of imperial Russia, located in the province of Transbaikalia (present-day Zabaykal’skiy Kray), near the Russian border with China. The katorga was administered by the Ministry of Interior and included prisons at Akatuy, Kara, Aleksandrovsk, Nerchinskii Zavod, and Zerentuy, all of which are depicted in the album. Common criminals and political prisoners alike were sent to these camps to work the nearby mines and their associated smelting plants. Gold was chiefly mined at Kara, silver and lead at Akatuy. Kuznetsov himself was a political prisoner, sentenced in 1873 to permanent exile in Siberia and six years of hard labor at the Kara mines. After completing his sentence, Kuznetsov received permission to settle in Nerchinsk, where he founded a local cultural society. In 1889 he moved to Chita. It is not clear how he received permission to visit the prisons of the Nerchinsk katorga and to create this graphic record of the prisoners and the conditions in which they lived and worked.\n\nView the collection\n\nVoyage of the Corvette \"Seniavin\" During 1826-1829 (65 items)\n\nThe round-the-world voyage of the corvette Seniavin was commissioned by Tsar Nicholas I and carried out in 1826‒29 under the command of Captain Fedor Litke (the Russian version of the name of Count Friedrich Lütke, a Baltic German). The expedition began in Kronstadt (the main imperial Russian naval base near Saint Petersburg where Russian circumnavigations typically began and ended); it then traveled around Cape Horn to the Pacific Ocean. This voyage was one of many Russian scientific naval surveys in the first part of the 19th century. Amid the tensions of the early 1820s over borders and fishing rights in the North Pacific involving Russia, Great Britain, and the United States, the tsar originally intended to send the Seniavin to the region as a warship. When these issues were resolved in the Russian-American and Anglo-Russian conventions of 1824 and 1825, the Seniavin instead was sent to survey the Alaskan and Asian coasts. This book, based upon the voyage and published in French in the early 1830s, offered new information of great interest to geographers and the wider scientific community in Europe at this time. The voyage of the Seniavin resulted in novel charts and names for new islands and geographical features in the Bering Sea and wider stretches of the Pacific Ocean. Litke visited New Archangel (present-day Sitka), the capital of Russian America, as well as Unalaska, the Pribilof Islands, Saint Matthew Island, and the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea. After a provisioning stop in Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Seniavin surveyed the Asian coastline of Russia up to the Bering Strait. Litke also sailed to other regions in the Pacific Ocean, including Valparaiso in Chile, the Bonin Islands (present-day Ogasawara Islands, Japan), the Mariana Islands, the Seniavin Islands (discovered by Litke, in Micronesia), Manila and Luzon in the Philippines, and the Caroline Islands. As was customary on such voyages, Litke was accompanied by scientists and artists. Many of the scientists were among the leading experts in their fields at the time. They included the geologist Aleksandr Postels and the ornithologist Friedrich Heinrich von Kittlitz, who identified many new species of birds on the voyage. Both men produced many drawings on natural and ethnographic subjects, from which the lithographs in the book are derived. This volume also includes maps from the route of the voyage of all the regions visited. Later in his career, Litke became a tutor for a son of Tsar Nicholas I, a founder of the Russian Geographic Society, and a military governor of Reval (present-day Tallinn, Estonia) and Kronstadt.\n\nView the collection\n\nBooks from the National Library of Russia (89 items)\n\nThis collection of books from the collections of the National Library of Russia includes translations into the Aleut-Fox language of the Gospel of St. Matthew and the Catechism using the Cyrillic alphabet as a written foundation.
