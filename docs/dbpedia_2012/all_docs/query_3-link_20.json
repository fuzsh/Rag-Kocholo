        "text": "In the structure of gross value added in Irkutsk oblast, industry accounted for 31.7% in 2010, and 44.8% in 2018. The specific weight of the volume of shipped products of the region in Russia increased from 1.4% in 2010 to 1.7% in 2019, due to the fact that the volume of mining operations increased nine times. The average annual number of workers employed in the industrial sector decreased by 3.6%.\n\nIn 2010–2019, the production index in Irkutsk oblast, based on the results of its retrospective recalculation by Rosstat, did not fall below 100%, reaching its maximum value in 2010, 113.3%, and the minimum value in 2019, 100.4% (Fig. 1). Growth rates of the industrial production index in 2010–2012, were due to significant volumes of mining (especially hydrocarbons). The drop in production volumes in 2019 is associated with a decrease in the production of crude oil, metal ores, and due to the current federal emergency in the region in the summer of 2019 (flooding of settlements) and coal. The trend continued in 2020 under the influence of external and internal factors (Russian participation in the agreement with the OPEC + countries and, accordingly, the restriction on oil production, as well as restrictions on the part of Russian Railways in accepting coal for export). Against the background of this situation, the manufacturing industry in 2020, in contrast, showed an increase in production (in particular, the contribution was made by Pharmasynthez, which began to produce medicines for the treatment of coronavirus infection).\n\nTransformational processes, which differ in intensity and direction in different periods, have formed the modern structure of the region’s industry, whose leading industries are: extraction of crude oil and natural gas, which accounts for 35.2% of the volume of shipped products; energetics, 10.3; metallurgical production, 9.1; production of paper and paper products, 4.7; wood processing, 4.5%. In 2010, the leading positions were occupied by the energy sector, 18.3%; production of machinery, equipment, vehicles, 16.3; metallurgical production, 15.3; extraction of fuel and energy minerals, 8.9; and chemical production, 7.6%.\n\nThe average number of employees of organizations (excluding small businesses) and the volume of goods, works, and services shipped by large and medium-sized organizations were used as indicators that characterize the level of development of industrial production in 42 regional municipalities in 2010 and 2019.\n\nThe ratio of these indicators made it possible to distinguish four groups of municipalities by the level of industrial development (high, medium, low, and very low) in 2010 and 2019. (Figs. 2, 3).\n\nIn 2019, compared to 2010, there was a transition of a number of territories of the region from one group to another. In three municipalities (Ust-Kutsky, Katangsky, and Alarsky districts) there was an increase in the level of industrial development, and in the other three municipalities (Angarsk, Shelekhovsky district, and Usolye-Sibirskoe) a decrease occurred.\n\nThe Highly developed group (Katangsky, Ust-Kutsky regions, and Bratsk) is characterized by high values of the share of people employed in industrial production and the volume of shipped products. It accounts for 21.2% of those employed in industrial organizations of the region (rotation work is also used) and 48.4% of investments in fixed assets. The northern regions continue to increase their concentration of the volume of shipped products in the region by the type of economic activity mining (2010, 43.8%; 2019, 73.6%). Oil and gas condensate production increased by 5.4 times, from 3.3 million tons in 2010 to 17.9 million tons in 2019. Oil produced from fields in the north of the region is fed to the Eastern Siberia–Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline system; it is delivered to the Far East and then exported to China and other countries of the Asia–Pacific region. The main companies represented on the territory of these municipalities are Verkhnechonskneftegaz, Dulisma, and the Irkutsk Oil Company. The latter is the largest taxpayer to the regional budget (in 2018, the share of its contributions was 12.5%). Generally, oil producing enterprises provided 46% of all income tax revenues in 2018 in the structure of tax revenues of the consolidated budget of the region.\n\nIndustrial production in Bratsk is associated with the activities of such processing enterprises as RUSAL Bratsk (in 2019 it provided 38% of the aluminum production in Russia), the Ilim Group in Bratsk, and the Bratsk Ferroalloy Plant, which form the industrial image of the city. During the period an increase in the volume of shipped products in the manufacturing sector was noted in Bratsk (2010, 22.6%; 2019, 29.9%), which allows it to remain a large industrial hub of the region.\n\nGroup with an average level of development (the Angarsk, Svirsk, Sayansk, Ust-Ilimsk, Irkutsk, Bodaibinsky, Shelekhovsky, Nizhneilimsky, and Tulunsky districts) is distinguished by a high share of those employed in industry and an average volume of industrial production. About half of the region’s population lives in these municipalities, they produce 40.6% of industrial production, and concentrate 61.5% of those employed in the industrial sector, as well as 38.4% of investments. The group includes almost all major industrial centers in the region. Unlike the previous case, the sectoral composition of this group is more diverse and is represented by enterprises of nonferrous metallurgy, mechanical engineering, chemical and petrochemical, pulp and paper, nuclear, pharmaceutical, and food industries (Irkutsk Aluminum Plant, Irkutsk Aviation Plant, Angarsk Petrochemical Company, Angarsk Polymer Plant, Sayanskkhimplast, Ilim Group in Ust-Ilimsk, Angarsk Electrolysis Chemical Plant, Pharmasintez, etc.). The production profile of these territories was formed back in the Soviet era, but at the present stage enterprises continue to play a significant role in the socioeconomic development of the region, especially for export-oriented industries.\n\nThe mining sector is represented by gold mining at ore and alluvial deposits (Polyus Verninskoe, Vysochaishy, Druza, Lenzoloto, etc., which provided more than 9% of the gold mining in Russia), iron ore (Korshunovsky GOK), and coal (Tulunugol open pit).\n\nA separate place in this group is occupied by Irkutsk, the administrative center of the region with a diversified industry, which is the center of the emerging agglomeration of the same name. For Irkutsk, there is a significant increase in shipped products by the type of economic activity supply of electricity, gas, and steam, and air conditioning (in 2010, 27.9%, and in 2019, 87.4%). This increase is explained by a peculiarity of statistical accounting: most of the products produced on the territory of the region for this type of economic activity are attributed to the city. In reality, Irkutsk produces 25 times less of them. We note that almost all large energy companies, except for Vitimenergo, are registered in the regional center.\n\nThe low development group (Usolye-Sibirskoe, Winter, Tulun, Cheremkhovo, Kirensky, Zhigalovsky, Nizhneudinsky, Usolsky, Mamsko-Chuisky, Zalarinsky, Kazachinsko-Lensky, Taishetsky, Ust-Ilimsky, Bratsky, Nukutsky, Alarsky, Slyudyansky, Chunsky, Chunkhovsky, and Irkutsky) is the most numerous and heterogeneous in its composition. It is characterized by a small share of those employed in the industrial production of the region and a low volume of goods shipped. This group accounts for 8.8% of the volume of shipped goods, works, and services of the region, 16.8% of those employed in industry, and 12.7% of investments. In more than half of the municipalities, the leading type of economic activity is manufacturing, which is represented by medium-sized and large companies: a branch of the Ilim Group in the Bratsk District, Knauf Gips Baikal, Rusforest Magistralny, Usolye Salt Extraction and Processing Shop (part of Russol), and others.\n\nMining predominates in six municipalities (Gazprom Dobycha Irkutsk, IOC, Nedra mining company (GPK), Tyretsky salt mine, Cheremkhovugol open pit, etc.); in Tulunsky district, it is power engineering, and in Mamsko-Chuysky, it is water supply. At the end of 2022, gas is planned to be supplied from the Kovykta field (Irkutsk gas production center) to the Power of Siberia gas trunkline, which is oriented to external consumption (China).\n\nThe group includes territories both with industrial enterprises closed in the post-Soviet period and with new industrial facilities that have just begun to function. Single-industry towns (Usolye-Sibirskoye, Cheremkhovo, and Tulun) were given the status of a territory of advanced socioeconomic development to support the economy.\n\nThe very low development group (Osinsky, Kuytunsky, Bayandaevsky, Olkhonsky, Balagansky, Kachugsky, Bokhansky, Ekhirit-Bulagatsky, Ust-Udinsky, and Ziminsky districts). This accounts for only 0.1% of the volume of products produced in the region, 0.5% of those employed in industrial organizations of the region, 0.5% of investments in fixed assets. The industry is mainly represented by food. The districts specialize in agriculture, logging, and recreational activities. There are no large companies; small business prevails.\n\nIn the first and fourth groups, the priorities in the development of types of economic activity changed, and in the second and third groups, their proportions changed (Fig. 4).\n\nFrom 2010 to 2019, the volume of shipped products and investments increased by 3.4 and 3.8 times, respectively (on average per one municipal district) (see Table 1), with a decrease in the population and employed in the industrial sector. The greatest change in these indicators is noted in the first and second groups.\n\nThe regional industry is dominated by local organizations of various sizes, a quarter of the large and medium-sized companies are controlled by holding companies such as Gazprom, Rosneft, Polyus, Ilim Group, Rosatom, Rostekh, Mechel, Renova, En+ Group, and RUSAL.\n\nIn recent years, as a result of the active development of oil and gas resources, the process of complex formation has begunFootnote 1: for example, IOC is building a polymer plant in Ust-Kut (commissioning is planned in 2024) and is building the Ust-Kutsk gas processing plant for the supply of raw materials (to be launched in 2021).\n\nRUSAL invested and attracted large investments in the construction of the Taishet aluminum plant (the launch was postponed to 2021), as well as the Taishet anode factory, which will meet the plant’s needs for baked anodes. The Ilim Group will build a pulp and cardboard mill in Ust-Ilimsk by 2023, which will increase the production of unbleached packaging materials. These and other projects, which were initiated by big business and are in an active stage, attract investments to the municipalities of the region (Fig. 5).\n\nIn 2010 the share of investments of the five leading municipalities in the region was 71.2%, while by 2019 the concentration increased to 78.8%. In 2017–2019 investment growth rates increased, on average, in most municipalities (85.7%), especially in municipalities of the third group, the Tulun, Ust-Ilimsky, Kuytunsky, and Cheremkhovsky districts. Per capita investment rates are the highest for municipalities of the first and second groups, Katangsky, Ust-Kutsky, and Bodaibinsky northern regions, which is explained by the large volumes of investments made by large companies in the development of natural resources and the low population density."
