        "text": "Boarders is a high energy, coming of age comedy drama which follows the lives of five talented black inner-city teenagers navigating their way through an alien world â the British public school system. Following a problematic viral video involving a student, our five leads (Jaheim, Leah, Omar, Toby and Femi) are offered sixth form scholarships to St Gilbertâs, one of the countryâs oldest and most prestigious schools, in an attempt to rehabilitate its image. They soon find themselves in a world they can only describe as something out of Harry Potter, surrounded by lush playing fields, cloistered grandeur and complex social rules which they must decipher quickly in order to survive. They will go on a journey as they learn about themselves, their identity and what itâs like to live alongside the one percent - which they discover is nothing like life as they knew it.\n\nEJ\n\nDaniel Lawrence Taylor â creator, writer and executive producer\n\nCan you give us an overview of Boarders?\n\nBoarders is about five young black underprivileged students that get scholarships to St. Gilberts private school. The series follows our five leads (Jaheim, Toby, Leah, Femi and Omar) as they navigate their way through this very alien world which is steeped in the complexities of race, class, money and power. Itâs about them having to survive in that world, whilst also being a coming of age comedy drama where theyâre just trying to grow up, chase girls (or boys, in Leah and Omarâs case) and figure out who they are.\n\nWhat inspired you to write the series, and have you drawn from any of your own experiences?\n\nBoarders is a fictional series that was initially inspired by an article about a scholarship scheme for underprivileged young black boys. There was quite a lot of parallels to my own experience at university which was predominately white and middle class. It was an interesting experience for me and the handful of black students that went there and we all navigated our way in that world differently. That felt like a really cool thing to explore through a comedy-drama.\n\nIâd be lying if I said I wasnât also inspired by other TV shows and films, like Sex Education. One thing I love about that show is that it deals with sex, sexuality, relationships and all these big themes in a really cool and funny way. I wanted to do a similar thing with Boarders where I could look at class, race and privilege but do it in a fun and comedic way. I think shows like that definitely inspired me. Iâve also always loved films like Mean Girls or Superbad â all these coming of age comedies which are steeped in a lot of drama with things that we can all relate to. For example, theyâve got the school âgroupsâ â the geeks, the cool kids and the mean girls, to name a few. I drew from all of those experiences and I think thatâs what people will tap into when they watch the show because theyâre going to see familiar faces and dynamics that weâve all seen at school or will recognise for those viewers still at school.\n\nHow did you balance the comedy and drama in the series?\n\nI always write through a comedy lens because itâs the medium I enjoy writing the most, but also when youâre delving into big issues I think itâs much more powerful to do so through comedy â nobody ever wants to be preached to. I think comedy is a good way to show a world and see the comedy in it, poke fun and find the satire in it as well. It makes for a much more fun watch when you do it through the lens of comedy.\n\nI think Boarders does lean a lot into the comedy but there is a lot of drama as well. I think especially when you look at the lead characters, such as Jahiem and the journey he goes through â that definitely takes us into the drama and him trying to survive in this world. But then you have Toby, who definitely leans more into the comedy where we see him trying to exploit this world and take what he can from it. Each character dips into bits of drama and comedy, so itâs quite balanced throughout and varies in each episode.\n\nHow involved were you with the casting of the leading five? Can you talk us through the process and why you went with Josh, Sekou, Aruna, Myles and Jodie?\n\nI was across it all. There was a lot of discussion between me, the directors, the producers and the BBC about the cast. When I wrote the show, I wrote five very distinct lead characters so when it came to casting I wanted to make sure that everybody matched those characters. I really wanted them to not only to be different but to look and sound different as well. Those were all big discussions we had throughout the casting process.\n\nFirst and foremost, the cast are all very funny, talented and all could carry the drama â these were traits we all looked for during the auditions. When we had our shortlist, we then did chemistry reads because even though our leads all have their individual stories, the group dynamic was really important so we wanted to make sure they sat together really well. Rosalie, our casting director, got them to read scenes but she also left the camera running in between takes to see how they interacted with each other â it was the best exercise because when they came to set you could tell they were all really comfortable with each other. I think part of the beauty of the show is the five leads together and their bond. Casting was so important and it was a long process but thereâs not a single weak link. Theyâre all stars and I think thatâs what makes the show.\n\nYou also star in the show! What was it like playing Gus, the mentor to the five leads? Were there any funny moments on set?\n\nFunnily enough Ethosheia once joked that I was in âGus modeâ when I was giving Sekou a little bit of advice, what with him making his on-screen debut. We cast pretty much all of our actors through agents, but Sekou was a rare find who applied to audition through social media. Because heâs so talented but new to the industry, I was grilling him, making sure heâd done his headshots and got himself up on Spotlight so that he hits the ground running, which I suppose is a very Gus thing to do.\n\nIt was really fun to play Gus. Originally, my intention wasnât actually to be in the show, but being a writer performer who always finds some way of cramming himself into his own work, people assumed that Iâd play him. And the more we developed the character in the writers room, the more appealing it became to take on the role, so I decided to get involved and Iâm so glad I did. It was great working with the young cast as well, being on set and in that world. Some of my scenes were opposite Derek Riddell, who is an incredible actor, so it was amazing to act opposite him. It was also a joy to take on a character that I donât usually play.\n\nOn set, there was a joy seeing people perform and be in the moment. I really enjoyed seeing a young cast all in one place and it was shot during the summer so it felt like a fun summer holiday for them - you could see them coming up with games to play on set or making up dances. It was really lovely to see them enjoy it and for it not to feel like a job.\n\nWhat do you want the audience to take from the show?\n\nFirst and foremost, I just want people to have fun. I want them to come away loving the characters and wanting to be with them and warm to them. Thereâs so many fun and joyful characters in the show and I think thatâs what I want people to see and connect with. The five leads you see in Boarders arenât often what we see on TV or if you do see them theyâre never in these kinds of situations and going through the things they have to battle with. I take quite big swings at âissuesâ but again it is first and foremost a piece of entertainment and itâs fun. Itâs a comedy and a drama so I would want people to watch it, enjoy it and talk about it. If they learn something from it, thatâs amazing. The show portrays a very specific experience that a lot of people might not be familiar with or might not have experienced, and it shows how our five leads overcome some of the challenges theyâre faced with. It would be lovely to think, the more we talk about diversity and inclusion, that we have a show like this to help understand the different perspectives we show in the series.\n\nWhat advice would you give to any aspiring writers?\n\nI would say: write what you know. Thatâs not to say if youâre a young black kid that you just have to write about young black experiences. It could be your world, your relationships, things that interest you. Iâm a believer that if you want to hone your craft, youâve got to put in your 10,000 hours of hard graftâ just put in the work and even if itâs terrible just keep putting pen to paper. You learn from your mistakes and I think thatâs what makes you a better writer.\n\nJosh Tedeku (Jaheim)\n\nWhat can you tell us about Jaheim?\n\nJaheim comes from London and heâs grown up around a rougher vibe, which youâll see in the first scene. Heâs a very prideful young man who can get violent at times because he doesnât know any other way to deal with his pain, but he can also be a bit of a charmer when he wants to be. The other four in the group (Femi, Omar, Toby and Leah) are friends of his but his real friends are back home. Throughout the series you see his growth and evolution so by the end of the final episode heâs changed quite a bit compared to when we first met him as heâs had to adapt to the situation and the environment he is in. At St. Gilbertâs, he strikes up a friendship with Xiang, his roommate, which is one of my favourite relationships in the series. Jaheim reminds me a lot of myself because in school I had quite a close circle but I became friends with a few more people and branched out more which helped me discover things about myself.\n\nWhat attracted you to the role and this project?\n\nI went to a majority white school outside of London and it was a weird experience for me. I know some people have good experiences and others have bad experiences. I saw myself in Jaheim a little bit and thought it would be a fun character to play and a fun story to tell. The first script we got was really good and I think thatâs what attracted all of us to the job.\n\nWhat is Boarders to you? What has the experience meant to you?\n\nI think being part of the gang (along with Jodie, Sekou, Myles and Aruna) has been the biggest thing for me â the way our bond is now, how it got to that point and how we have this understanding - itâs been a real blessing that I was brought here to do this with them. Weâre a good little unit â I love those guys and Iâm so proud of them. Itâs a fun show and I hope everyone enjoys it.\n\nWho do you think Boarders is for?\n\nIâd say it can be for everybody. Not everyone will know about this specific experience, but that doesnât matter and obviously itâs a comedy too, so itâs not a serious portrayal of boarding schools - though there are still some real moments throughout. I think a lot of people will enjoy the storytelling and the different perspectives it shows.\n\nWhat has it been like working with the directors, Ethosheia and Sam?\n\nWorking with them has been good â I like the way they handle things. They both work in different ways but both get the job done. Iâm a football fan so I see them as captain of the team. I often went up to them with suggestions but at the end of the day, they ensure itâs all made to the highest level. They have also given me some really good advice in the process.\n\nWhat advice would you give to any aspiring young actors?\n\nKeep doing your thing and keep pushing â your time will come if you really believe it and if you believe in yourself. Have that confidence and donât let anyone tell you otherwise. Keep improving and living life and there will come a time where you do get to that point. Weâre always learning so never think that youâre the finished product as thereâs always improvements that can be made, so just keep pushing.\n\nJodie Campbell (Leah)\n\nWhat can you tell us about Leah?\n\nLeah is the only girl out of the five students that gain scholarships to St. Gilbertâs. I would say sheâs very justice driven, sheâs tenacious but I think she also has a softer side. She goes through a lot and as you watch the series, you can see that the way she processes the things that go wrong varies and changes across the series. She sees the bigger picture in everything, which generally works in her favour but can work against her sometimes. Sheâs very musical and plays the piano, which is why she got her scholarship. Sheâs cool!\n\nWhatâs it been like working with the cast as a whole?\n\nWorking with the cast is absolutely amazing â the five of us get along so well. I have different relationships with each of them and as a group weâre like a family. I didnât expect it to be like that because Iâve never been on a set where Iâve been that close to people. With the wider cast, we all spent quite a lot of time together and we all have great chemistry. I feel like Iâve learnt so much from every single one of them â not just in terms of acting but in terms of life too. Iâm the youngest in the cast so learning from them and how they deal with things has been amazing to watch.\n\nIs there a sense of responsibility that comes with playing this character?\n\nI found the experience challenging but in a good way. Going into this role, I was very aware of Leahâs characterisation and aware of what I didnât want to make her. I didnât want her to be the strong black woman archetype that weâve seen, I wanted her to have more layers. I really enjoyed doing that, even though it was hard, but I feel like it pushed me in my craft to make sure that sheâs not just one way and to show thereâs so many different ways to be a black woman, which is what I really liked about the scripts. Sheâs more than what you just see and thatâs what was important me to when embodying Leah.\n\nHave you got a favourite moment on set?\n\nI think any moment where the five of us were together would be my favourite â stunning work from everyone, and we were all so gassed when we finished a scene. I love scenes with me and Georgina Sadler (who plays the role of Mabel) as we had a great time on and off set. There was one moment where me, Aruna and Georgina were in the make-up room and were performing to the make-up team â I think they enjoyed that! I was in the middle with the microphone and we had choreography and everything.\n\nWhat was it like working with Boardersâ directors Ethosheia and Sam?\n\nWorking with them both has been so fun. They are so different but both super talented. I think coming on set and seeing Ethosheia, another black woman, running things is nothing like Iâve ever seen before on set. It felt like home. I brought my mum to set and she was like âthis is so good!â. Having Ethosheia here especially for the first few weeks was so important to me. Iâd message her and ask âwhat do you think about this?â and she would really help me, push me with my acting and suggest different things to try.\n\nI had worked with Sam before so working with him again when Iâm a little bit older was really nice. I love that he would do a âwhat colour Wednesdaysâ where everyone picks a colour and they come in wearing that colour â it brings the vibe up. Heâs all about positivity and positive energy and I really appreciated that. Both of them really let you explore your character. They know that we know our characters best and they trust us with that so thatâs what I really love about our directors.\n\nWhat has it been like exploring the different themes of the show?\n\nItâs been really interesting for me. I went to private school - not to board, but I was a scholarship student so I could relate a little bit, although my school was way different to St. Gilbertâs. My school was diverse â all the black girls from year 7 to year 13 knew each other which was nice. When I went to sixth form, I was in an all-white institution so it felt like a different experience and I think thatâs where Iâve taken some inspiration from for Leahâs experience in Boarders. Exploring the theme of difference and being an outsider is something that has been really fun and interesting to do because I think itâs something a lot of people can relate to. Everyone at some point in their life has probably felt like an outsider â so making it relatable on-screen has been really important.\n\nMyles Kamwendo (Omar)\n\nWhat can you tell us about your character, Omar?\n\nOmar is a nice, kind boy. He always sees the best in people regardless of what theyâve done in the past. Heâs reserved and keeps to his own world compared to the others â whether thatâs drawing or anime. Heâs gay and completely open about his sexuality in the series too which is great.\n\nDoes that comes with a responsibility, playing a gay character?\n\nI think with any character thereâs a responsibility to tell the characterâs truth with sincerity and putting in the work, so that when viewers watch the show they can relate to them and see themselves in the character. I also think itâs refreshing to see a series where everyone accepts Omar for who he is.\n\nWhat attracted you to this role?\n\nI think itâs a different character with lots of different levels and I think Boarders as a series is great because it shows the perspective of black youth within an elitist society. I feel like thatâs a unique experience in itself, so itâs nice to see that portrayal on screen and for audiences to get an idea of what thatâs like for black people in that environment.\n\nWho would you say this programme is for?\n\nIn some way, shape or form I feel this show is for everyone. I think people will connect and relate to one aspect or another.\n\nHow would you sum up Boarders in one sentence?\n\nA colliding of different worlds and experiences.\n\nSekou Diaby (Toby)\n\nHow would you describe Toby?\n\nToby reminds me a little bit of myself when I was his age. Heâs just a boy that has loads of big dreams and a lot of self-belief, but to the point where it may be slightly delusional. Heâs very smart and his âsuperpowerâ that got him into this school is his language skills â he speaks about ten different languages fluently. Heâs got special things about him but heâs at a stage in his life where heâs trying to find himself and heâs not afraid to fall flat on his face in the process. I think some of his friends would describe him as a bit of a class clown but also a bit like Bambi â freshly born and trying to find his feet. But just like Bambi, I think Toby is a lovely soul - harmless, but just a bit wobbly.\n\nHow did you end up playing Toby?\n\nIâve been out of school for four or five years now and Iâve been trying to pursue a career as an actor for some time now. Iâve been doing creative stuff and storytelling in other mediums before but I kept auditioning for different things. Tobyâs role came up and I saw an open casting on Instagram so I sent a self-tape. After that, it was an in-person audition and then a chemistry read. I feel like I get him very well.\n\nWhatâs the dynamic been like between the main five characters?\n\nWeâve got a great chemistry â Iâve loved the scenes we got to do together. On set, we will be laughing and joking just to help us and thatâs naturally the vibe we come with. Weâre all like brothers and sisters. Itâs very homely and very natural.\n\nHas there been anything about playing Toby that has been really difficult for you?\n\nI think because Toby is so comedic, youâve got to keep a certain tone when youâre playing him. When certain things happen to the character, although itâs done in quite a funny way, some of the things he experiences are actually quite sad. What I found hard was emotionally understanding what heâs going through but then trying to keep the fun side of it. Thereâs a lot of emotional turmoil going on but when Toby says something thereâs a lot of comedy there, making everyone laugh as he tries to sweep emotions under the carpet. As Boarders is a comedy-drama Iâm doing a lot of funny stuff when itâs actually quite deep at the same time.\n\nWhat was it like speaking in Japanese for some of your lines?\n\nIt was really tricky, so I hope people like it. I donât know any Japanese so it was difficult.\n\nAruna Jalloh (Femi)\n\nWhat can you tell us about your character, Femi?\n\nFemi is Nigerian and heâs 16 years old. Heâs someone who is quite confused about who he is. Heâs learning how to navigate his way through life but at the same time he feels heâs losing himself. Although he doesnât really know who he is â heâs always been under the thumb of someone else; his dad, school or pressures of being sent back to Nigeria.\n\nThis is your first TV role but youâve done theatre before. Whatâs that transition been like?\n\nThe transition has felt a bit like youâre starting from square one again because everything youâve learnt for theatre doesnât necessarily work on TV and film. Iâve heard people say television is smaller on screen because it is on a lens whereas theatre is more out in the open and you need to connect with people in the back row. With TV, Iâve had to ask myself how I connect with people watching at home â how do I get their attention and draw them into the story. With theatre of course theyâre in the room with you and theyâve paid to watch so you want people to pay attention. The transition has been quite difficult as Iâve essentially had to unlearn everything. Iâve had to watch a lot more, ask questions and look outside of myself as an actor. If you want to master anything youâve got to know what everyone else is doing â the sound, the lighting, the directors, the costume, the make-up etc â ask how they go about things, their vision and how they put things together. TV is a huge beast with lots of different mechanics that make it move as one. The more I got to know those mechanics, the more comfortable I have felt.\n\nWhatâs the best thing about being in Boarders?\n\nThe people and the amount of care that has gone into it. What you see on-screen is the final product but thereâs about 50 other people behind the scenes that each make it what it is, so itâs important that we recognise that family and that community.\n\nCan you talk about the dynamic between you and the main five but also the wider cast?\n\nItâs been like family â weâre all really close and quite cheeky. We have really deep chats and we all talk about life. Weâre all growing so weâre all trying to gain different perspectives of different aspects of life â whether thatâs love, friendships, or spiritual systems, for example. We all had a great time and really enjoyed ourselves.\n\nDo you have a favourite moment?\n\nCatching the sunset in Bristol was so lovely, itâs beautiful. It was my first time in Bristol so it was really good to explore when I wasnât on set.\n\nMadeleine Sinclair â Executive Producer for Studio Lambert\n\nBoarders explores some big themes through a comedy-drama lens, why do you think thatâs important?\n\nBoarders tackles some quite complex and challenging themes such as race, class, money, privilege, education and opportunity - but I think if you want to bring people to that you have to make it an enjoyable ride. What Daniel does so brilliantly in his writing is look for the awkward, uncomfortable places, but also the humour. So if anything veers towards being too issue-led, he always looks for the flip slide of the situation. Ultimately itâs TV, and while we go to some difficult places, itâs got to be entertaining.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the lead characters in the series?\n\nWe have five lead characters in the series who are all very gifted. Boarders is a coming of age comedy-drama and we watch these characters trying to navigate the situation at St. Gilbertâs and find their way.\n\nJaheim lives with his granny and his younger brother at home in a relatively rough area. He has a group of friends at home who have taken a different path in life. His best friend from home since childhood, Malachi, is involved in criminality but they remain very close. Jaheim is really aware of the different path he could take. Heâs very intelligent and gifted and through Gusâ after school programme, heâs found a different route via the scholarship programme at St. Gilbertâs. Jaheim is excited about it but I think heâs always quite conflicted as a character because heâs leaving everything he knows behind. Heâs aware that this new experience is going to take him far away from his best friend and the world he knows.\n\nLeah is the only girl among our five leads to make it onto the scholarship scheme because originally it was aimed at young black men. Leah, who also attended Gusâ after school programme for gifted kids, fought her way onto the scheme to prove she was just as worthy for a place as anyone else. Sheâs an activist and sheâll always fight for a cause she believes in. Across the series and in this new world, she also discovers a freedom she hasnât really had before â boys, drinking and parties â things she wasnât really interested in before but it inevitably leads to some distractions and confusion.\n\nOmar is very artistic and when he joins the school, he becomes obsessed with finding a secret artistic society. Omar is desperate to know if they exist and he thinks if he can find it, heâll finally find his people and heâll belong. Searching for this group is a big part of his journey in the series but in doing so, he forgets to look around and see there are other relationships and friendships that he could explore.\n\nToby is our wheeler dealer, gift of the gab and the comedic heart of the series. He is always looking for a hustle or a way to do something a bit extra. Across the series, we watch Toby get in over his head as he tries to impress, exploring why he always need to be the funny guy.\n\nFemi worked hard to get his scholarship but he really starts to feel the pressure, academically, when he starts at St. Gilbertâs. His father has moved the rest of the family, including his younger brother, to Nigeria. If Femi doesnât succeed at boarding school, heâll have to go too â and heâs determined to stay. He follows his fatherâs advice to distance himself from the other scholarship students and aligns himself with a group of very privileged, old money, white boys. He embeds himself with these boys and away from his old friends, so itâs a journey about identity for Femi â figuring out who he is and who he wants to be.\n\nWhy do you think those big themes are good to showcase now?\n\nIt feels like weâre living in quite divisive times and I think a show which allows viewers to get an insight into two, seemingly polarised worlds, feels valuable for now. Boarders looks at the differences, but also the fundamental similarities, between a group of teenagers all just trying to get by. Those coming to the school on the scholarship scheme and the students currently at the school are all aware of the differences between them at first, but I think across the series, while some tensions grow, others are surprised by the friendships and relationships that develop and the impact they start to have on each other.\n\nThe project as a whole is connected to the idea of opportunity, was that reflected in production?\n\nThe premise of the show is about access to opportunity and that was important to reflect in the production and crew.\n\nWith the help of the Bristol Film Office, we aimed to attract local talent and give opportunities to those from underrepresented backgrounds across the crew.\n\nIn addition to this, we brought on Latent Pictures, a Bristol based company working with underrepresented filmmakers, to produce all our âbehind the scenesâ footage.\n\nWe had a number of ScreenSkills trainees in our HMU, Sound and Assistant Director departments and shadow directors joining us regularly on set.\n\nI think it was hugely valuable to the production because we had some really fantastic people and it made for a really interesting and buzzy set with crew from a whole range of backgrounds, who each brought their own different experiences.\n\nWhat can you tell us about working with Boardersâ Musical Director, Mykaell Riley?\n\nWe were so lucky to have Mykaell. He is a hugely experienced and successful musician and producer and we were thrilled, that he liked the scripts and the premise of the show and wanted to come onboard. It was an interesting model to work with not only Mykaell but also with some of his students at the University of Westminster to create the music for the series. It was important to us that the music felt contemporary and fresh, and working with his students was key to achieving that. It was a different way to work but we think itâs really helped us deliver a brilliant soundtrack for the series."
