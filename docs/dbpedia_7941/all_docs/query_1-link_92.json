        "text": "This story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors recommend one can’t-miss story every weekday. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\n\n“When my boss fired me,” Konrad Kay recalls of his final moments working in finance, “he took me upstairs, and he was like: ‘I sit next to you for 12 hours a day. I think you’re a great person. I really like you. I would invite you to have dinner with my family’—which he did. ‘But you are categorically the worst salesperson I have ever met in my life. I need to let you go. It’s not personal. Just get the fuck out of here and do something else.”\n\nNot two months earlier, Kay’s best friend from Oxford, Mickey Down, had called him up at work to share some incredible news: Down, who had recently left behind his own post-university job in banking, had just sold something to NBC and wanted Kay to understand that, look, a career in film and television might really truly be viable for them. What would it take for us to go away for a weekend and try to develop some big thing on the back of this?\n\n“And I remember being at my desk at Morgan Stanley,” where Kay was basically afraid to make a phone call, he says, because he had no clue what he was selling, “thinking: I’m very excited for Mickey, and kind of jealous that that was happening. And also: God, I have to get out of here because we could really do this together.”\n\nThat afternoon that Kay was ejected from the world he and Down would come to immortalize years later in their HBO series Industry, he called his parents. “It was this beautiful day in June,” Kay says. “They said come home. We sat in the garden, opened a bottle of wine, and they said: Whatever you do, it’ll be better than that. We’ve lived with you. You’ve been depressed for three years. You could clean fucking plates in a restaurant and you’d be happier than you are now.”\n\nDown, now 35, had jumped from the heights of London finance; Kay, now 36, had been pushed. But the result was the same. Relief. Opportunity. New life. But also the terrifying reality that there was no longer anywhere to hide. And, so, as a duo, they went to work. Writing scripts. Staging plays. Making low-budget short films. A low-budget feature. Working on other people’s shows in London. “We had an attitude,” Kay says, “especially at the start, which was we had to literally say yes to everything, develop anything, take any job.”\n\nSeveral of Down’s earliest Instagram posts, from that era, are hashtagged #giantleap—a reference to a play the pair took to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival (in which a writers room tries to script some good lines for Neil Armstrong during his fake moon landing). But the tag could have also described the dramatic act of transition for the two, taken on faith.\n\nWhat did you tell people you were doing during that time?\n\n“Oh, writing a show,” Down says.\n\nAnd don’t people roll their eyes?\n\n“Of course, of course,” Kay says. “But being in a partnership, we could always delude ourselves into thinking we were going places.”\n\nThey received their first check about a year in. Not much money, but enough to sustain the delusion. A micro-budget feature they made led to attention, meetings, and ultimately commissions. “In retrospect, it felt like we’d fucking—not won an Oscar—but if someone was paying us to do something,” Kay recalls, “it felt like an enormous win.”\n\nThe commitment to the idea of this kind of life, and each other, paid off. Three years after the giant leap, in March 2016, Down and Kay received the first email stating HBO’s real interest in the project that would become Industry—a bottom-up view of high finance, centered, at least at first, on a class of recent university graduates. Four years after that, in November 2020, Industry hit like a syringe of adrenaline to the heart. And beginning this Sunday, the third season of the show slides into HBO’s historically coveted (The Sopranos, Game of Thrones) 9 p.m. ET slot.\n\nIf you, like I, prefer watching television not to marvel at how well a show can address the development notes of network executives—motivations crystal clear; chasms of character-shaping backstory neatly explicated; structural story beats stacked squarely and predictably—but rather to catch an immaculate vibe, then you may well consider this the best show on television. I watched the new season less than a month ago and I couldn’t really tell you who did what and why—but, my God, the feeling.\n\nIndustry grapples with so many big potent questions. Why would the brightest minds of their generation—of any generation—spend their brains on finance? For those who do, what is the cost of absolute ambition? What is the sacrifice for pure material gain? What happens to a body and soul when a young person toggles all of their switches to the extremes of pure self-interest?\n\nBut the show also provokes some more practical questions: Of all the bankers—or lawyers or advertising copywriters or personal assistants—who ever had a film or TV script in their desk drawer (or on their private laptop plugged in next to their Bloomberg terminal), why were these two guys able to get theirs onscreen? How did Down and Kay emerge as the needle in the haystack exceptions? And what do they intend to do with their hard-won canvas?\n\nThe answers help us understand how they’ve come to make the most purely adrenalized show on TV.\n\nIndustry seemed to emerge suddenly and without fanfare on the new streaming service, HBO Max, out of the COVID cold. And it announced itself immediately not with recognizable stars, but with its world and its written-ness. The show opens with snippets of the recruiting interviews of the incoming class of analysts at Pierpoint, fresh graduates from fine universities making their case for why they should be allowed to lend their big brains to the sales force of a trading desk. Gus, a graduate of Eton and Oxford and the son of a Ghanaian ambassador, explains: “I play third fiddle to two figures in my mother’s life: Jesus Christ and Margaret Thatcher.” And where do you stand on them? a recruiter asks. “One’s the reason we’re all here. And the other’s a carpenter.”\n\nThis was the moment I got hooked on Industry—and the moment I first looked up Mickey Down and Konrad Kay. This was the sort of thing a character might say on Mad Men. The practiced smirking line delivery of a Roger Sterling. Only this was today. This was London. This was kids. (Gus and Harper and Yasmin and Robert looked so, so young.) And the soundtrack behind the script, the ethereal synth of Industry that spiritually defines the show for so many fans, was right there from the beginning, too. Gus smiles sheepishly, as though this is a line he’s delivered effectively in every one of his admissions interviews at every level of his school days. Maybe it’s a line he’s been hearing all his life. Whatever—I hadn’t heard it. And I wanted more.\n\nThe show follows not one character but an ensemble of first-years through the competition for full-time jobs. This is the engine of the season one plot, in so much as there is one. It’s one of the few season one concessions toward conventional television-making. The show wanders into the lives of the characters who are a few years further on in their journey. Then: the top brass of the bank. And, eventually, in the forthcoming season three, with the worlds of politics, tech, and media. It follows these characters through their work—but also into the night, back home, out late and up early. Down and Kay understood, in their bones, the high and low stakes of the office place at the lowest rungs—the types, the flirtations, the exchanges, the dynamics across the generations. It is one of the most accurate shows ever about what it’s actually like to work in an office.\n\nDown and Kay knew the worlds of these characters beyond the office, as well. The places they’d live. The places they’d eat and drink and dance and do drugs. The clothes they’d wear, the clothes they’d covet. “A lot of what we’re trying to do is just wanting to render things that are usually rendered badly on TV,” Down says. In the first two seasons, maybe that meant clubbing and partying and after-partying and drinking and drug use in London. “A lot of that is very prominent but usually seen through this quite cartoonish lens on TV.”\n\nThen, as the canvas for the world expanded, they knew the particulars of those worlds, too. The old private clubs in London. The older country houses in Wiltshire.\n\nDo you have to have been in the creepy basement handball court of an ancient London members-only club to write about it? I ask, referencing a scene in the first episode of season three.\n\nDown takes a second to faux contemplate this question, then laughs. “It helps!”\n\nIn season three, it is the way that power and finance and politics and media intermingle that is of prime interest, Kay says. “That quid pro quo thing of everything being slightly behind doors in London society. I think it’s a huge part of how politics, power, and money function.” The way they render it, it’s extremely influential people sitting in rooms talking flippantly about really important insidious stuff that’s going to affect people massively. “It’s, like: Shall we order a bottle of Champagne—and shall we do this to the country?”\n\n“I’ve been in rooms with those people,” Down says, “and, yes, there’s a sort of bravado, a bit of a put on, a bit of a performance. But the people who run the country, they all know each other, they all consider it somewhat of a game, the one-upmanship.”\n\n“It’s an extension of the boarding school and college life,” Kay says. “And the competitive nature of that stuff never goes away in terms of how they place themselves among their peers.”\n\n“David Cameron was very transparent in what his motivations were to become prime minister,” Down says. “To him, it was the senior job for the sons of gentlemen. It was like the best you could possibly get to. ‘Yes, I could go become a banker. But lots of my friends from school go to Goldman Sachs. Only one person gets to be prime minister.’”\n\nThere are a few scenes in season three that treat the chumminess and chattiness in UK society between finance, politics, and media with a stark clarity that is about as cynical a take on How The World Works as I’ve seen on TV. I absolutely love it. It reminds me of the way Industry handled COVID in season two. While much of culture was rendering people’s isolation and collective crack-up, some characters on Industry got on better than ever, gathered around kitchen islands with all their friends, partying and working remotely in vacation homes. Other characters profited enormously off the pain of millions, making smart bets in the right direction, the COVID equivalent of traders shorting the housing market. It’s a bleak portrayal, but it’s refreshing to see stated so clearly (and entertainingly) what’s often only whispered.\n\n“I guess we write towards that viewpoint of the world being quite a dark place,” Down says. “I’ve never had that personal viewpoint, but I think it’s an interesting thing to put on TV.”\n\n“Always at the periphery of the show is the idea that it’s a very dark universe,” Kay says. “But the possibility of real romance exists at the edges of it all the time.”\n\nOne Sunday this summer—a Sunday of peak British sport, of Euros and Wimbledon and Lewis Hamilton’s improbable triumph at the British Grand Prix—I meet Kay and Down at a pub in Camden, around the corner from Mickey’s place, not far from Amy Winehouse’s old house.\n\n“Mickey’s been on dad duty,” Kay says, by way of explaining why we are nowhere near his place and down the road from his friend’s. “Just today, I’ve done a play date, a children’s party, and a Pizza Planet situation,” Down says, when he arrives. Down has two children under four. Kay is godfather to Down’s daughter.\n\nThey are both dragging a little. The engagement party for Marisa Abela, who stars in their show as Yasmin, stretched late last night. Still, they are energetic. They are tall. They are handsome. They laugh a whole, whole lot. (“Do you mind if I get another beer?” Kay says, cracking up Down before the punch line. “I’m sorry. I always drink my first pint alarmingly quickly.”) Their accented voices are deep and rich, the vocal equivalent of evening tails. Their clothes hang off them loosely, both literally and dispositionally. They are the personification of relaxed fit. They are ambitious but seemingly unbothered. Focused and deliberate, but unanxious. They seem to run at room temperature. Their concerns, their regrets, when they tick through them, register as generally resolved. At least on this day. Yes, it is a July afternoon and there are drinks on the table and occasional sunshine, and a new great season of their show just around the bend, and there was that trip to Glastonbury they just took (a recent annual tradition) and that wedding in Cap d’Antibes on the horizon, and, yes, England is still winning in the Euros, and, yes, Labour has just swept into power after 14 years in the wilderness and there’s an AlkaSeltzer fizz of relief in the wet air all weekend. But still—there is a cool and casual calm about them that is of note. This thing is working. It is fun. At least for now. The great leap paid off.\n\nAs they are the first to concede, they are not the only bankers—or lawyers or engineers or management consultants or tech founders or politicians—who have been validated through all of school and life and have the irrational confidence to think to themselves: What I really am is a screenwriter. I can be the one to write the great movie or show about my industry, or frankly anything at all.\n\nDown and Kay suspected, while they were doing it, that they were not alone. And now it’s been confirmed. They receive piles of scripts, ranging from drama-school students to lords of private equity, who claim to just want a little feedback, but who more often want the phone number of the head of HBO.\n\nThey are young and seemingly approachable. They also bring it on themselves—encouraging people to send them their stuff, as they did recently at an Austin TV festival. “Every time I open something,” Down says, “I’m genuinely, like, Please be good, please be good.”\n\nIs it survivor’s guilt? I ask at one point. A sense that they escaped their earlier fate, and that it’s their responsibility to reach a hand back into the burning building?\n\n“A little bit,” Down says. “I was one of those people and I sent loads of those kinds of emails out and I got very few responses. But then I dunno if the kind thing to do is to be, like, yes, you have to have a healthy dollop of delusion to be successful. But you also have to be good. Is it better to be, like, don’t bother?”\n\nThey get audition tapes as well as scripts now. In many ways, it’s easier to help with an aspiring actor. “We could have a small part in Industry season four,” Down says. “He could read for it. We could give him the part. And now he’s got a credit and can go into other stuff.”\n\nWas there ever a point after other projects hadn’t worked out and Industry hadn’t been greenlit when you were telling yourselves, I can only give myself one more shot?\n\n“It’s easier ‘cause there’s two of us,” Down says. “So whenever one person was feeling like that, the other person was able to say…”\n\n“We did make jokes about sending each other Deloitte applications,” Kay says.\n\nBesides, they just knew they were onto something. “A good part of a creative impulse, which is underrated,” Kay says, “is hating shit and knowing what you think is bad versus what you think is good. Me and Mickey were coming from a point of thinking so much British TV was bad—and we just had a feeling deep in our stomach, which is, like, we can fucking do this better than that.”\n\nThey’d stumbled into finance at the end of university in a way, they say, no one possibly could again. Kay studied English literature. Down studied theology. They wrote about movies together for the school paper. But as graduation approached, all around on campus were recruiters offering you a lifeline.\n\n“No one we knew had any interest in that stuff before we got to Oxford,” Down says. “And then suddenly it was: Oh, internship, consulting, banking.… These things I didn’t have any knowledge about before were suddenly the most important thing in the world.”\n\nKay, who is much more comfortable talking about 19th-century novels and fiction published last week than interest-rate derivatives, would’ve tried being a writer had it not been so frictionless to become a banker. Down, who’d been making home movies with friends all his life (one standout was their version of 1994’s Blank Check, perhaps the perfect harbinger of Industry to come) might’ve jumped into film right away had banking not seemed so available. “But I would have never thought of filmmaking as a career,” Down says. “I just thought that’s something for someone else.”\n\nAnd so they graduated in a moment when banking wasn’t just a reasonable thing to do—it was the only thing to do. Down’s brother-in-law went to Oxford a half-decade later, Down says, and the plates had already shifted. “No one was going into finance. No one was going into consulting. No one into law.” Of course some were, but the flood, then, was start-ups.\n\nWhat today?\n\n“Content creation, I guess?” Kay says. “Being your own brand and monetizing that. I find it an unimaginable life.”\n\nThey have a laugh about the number of social media influencers at Oxford now.\n\n“I watch them when I’m hungover,” Kay concedes. “I find it really nostalgic.”\n\nIn this way, maybe the narrative to date about Down and Kay has been exactly backwards. Industry isn’t really the incredible story of two bankers who somehow become makers of television. It’s really more the incredible story of how two budding television makers were somehow allowed to become bankers.\n\n“I reckon I was the last of the cohorts of people who were getting hired with a fucking humanities degree to work at Morgan Stanley,” Kay says, still marveling. “Because they just stopped doing that cold.”\n\n“Our friend’s an MD at Goldman Sachs now,” Down says, “and I was having dinner with him, and he was like: I would never hire—I wouldn’t even interview—someone who did English.”\n\n“They want quants, physicists, mathematicians,” Kay says. “Which makes fucking sense! I couldn’t do basic arithmetic.”\n\n“Instead of hiring theologians!” Down says.\n\n“I wrote a good email,” Kay says. “That’s the one thing I’ll say.”\n\nAfter the critical success of season one, Down and Kay were granted another round. They saw it as an opportunity to correct what they considered to be the naïve formlessness of the first season. It’s not uncommon to hear novelists flog their previous books, but it’s less common to hear TV or film creators actively malign their earlier work. Hollywood is a confidence game. Everyone has to pretend to know—and to have always known—exactly what they’re doing.\n\n“But I look back on the first season,” Down says, “and I think: How did anyone follow what was going on? How did you even know what these characters were doing? The adage for the show is: ‘You don’t have to understand finance to enjoy it.’ But we have a sort of sense understanding of that world. If you don’t have that, I think you’d really be lost.”\n\n“For sure,” Kay says. “I think the show had a bit of an identity crisis of just what it was, what HBO thought it was, what we thought it was. The actors are so young that we cast that it couldn’t help but feel YA.”\n\n“It couldn’t be doing stuff that felt like it had stakes beyond the stakes of mixing up the lunch order and pissing off your boss,” Down says.\n\nBut what if that was why it worked for people? It wasn’t overdetermined or overexplained. The world was messy and confusing, but the stakes were familiar and incredibly universal. How to avoid fucking up at work in order to turn your very first job out of school into the next job. How to get the attention of the person two desks over. How to make it through the interminable acreage of a hangover at the office. A snatch of conversation. A high-stakes trade. A look from a coworker. A snyth-filled overture that serves the background. The soundscape of the show was like pushing play on Spotify to drown out the sounds of an open floor plan. It felt honest and real. A hang. A vibe. The show connected, I think, because it didn’t have answers to all the standard development questions that usually stop a raw statement of a new live-wire TV show like this one in its tracks before it gets the chance to reach people on their laptops.\n\n“It felt a little bit untrained,” Down says. “It felt like it was made by two people who had never made anything before.”\n\nSeason two, on the other hand, swung toward the scaffolding of structure, plot, and character excavation—but it may have been an overcorrection, they say. It was written during COVID, with self-imposed pressure to prove that they could write eight hours of real TV for HBO. The result was a bit of heaviness and a dour tone. “Having someone’s background basically be a harbinger of how they’re going to behave,” Down says, “I find that to be one the most annoying and cloying and obvious things in TV now.” People ask them all the time to explain in black and white terms the motivations and dynamics between their characters. “They want total resolution,” Kay says. “But the true answer is we don’t know—and that’s why it’s good.”\n\nAnd so, having thought hard about the most successful and most challenged elements of each season, they found new energy wedding the best of one and two to make three.\n\n“It’s the first time we’re, like—”\n\n“—happy with it,” Kay says, finishing Down’s sentence.\n\n“Usually at this period,” Down says, “we’re kicking ourselves about all the mistakes we made.”\n\nIn the first two seasons, Kay says, “I think we were scared to write about bigger things. I don’t think we’d thought about how big the canvas of the show could be. And in season three, we were just like, Well, we might as well throw everything at the wall and try to link the bank to places outside the bank—to show how the trading floor interacted with newspapers interacted with this version of conservative politics in our country. We just went for it in a way that I don’t think we did in the first seasons.”\n\nThe writers room for season two had been conducted exclusively on Zoom—Kay and Down together in a house they’d rented in Somerset, everyone else on their computers. “Me and Mickey were the only people in the same box,” Kay says. It worked well enough, they say. “You could get the story from A to B to C,” Down says. “But you don’t get little weird moments that someone might’ve pitched because it’s Friday and we know we’re going to have a drink afterward. We were looking someone in the eye and laughing with them—it was more joyful.”\n\nSeason two had accurately predicted, or at least presaged, certain elements and attitudes around remote health care coming out of COVID. Season three has an incredibly stark and cynical (but increasingly prescient) view of how investors and banks would start betting on ESG (environmentally and socially conscious) businesses. The very weekend we’re together in London, the Financial Times has a headline describing cooling shareholder support for ESG. So: Who was their oracle?\n\n“We have a consultant,” Down says, laughing. “And he loves the idea of being a sort of Zoro figure. He was very senior in the sell side and now he’s very senior in the buy side and he comes into our room once a week and just shoots the shit with us. He uses the show a little bit as I guess a way to fuck with people. And to get his own prejudices on stuff out. Which is probably how we use the show, as well.”\n\nAs with the first two seasons, filming for season three took place primarily in Cardiff, Wales, with select scenes in London and abroad. The show’s budget is the same, they’re quick to point out, as it was in season one; they’ve just got smarter about making choices. Because it’s produced under UK contracts, Industry was able to shoot during the dual WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes of 2023. Which is why it’s one of the few shows—like, say, House of the Dragon—that is able to release its new season as previously scheduled.\n\nIn Wales, Down and Kay rented a small house together in the country, 10 minutes outside Cardiff. It was divided in two—mirror images of one another, a gold half of the house and a silver half. “It was like a porny hotel,” Down says, “but then there were horses outside.” They’d get home each night, retreat to their halves, Down in the gold, Kay in the silver. Down liked to swim in the pool in the pissing rain; the landlord would sometimes watch.\n\n“I have lots of fondness for Cardiff,” Down says. “I just didn’t think I was going to spend so much time of my 20s and 30s there.”\n\nLena Dunham famously joined Down and Kay and the cast in Cardiff for a few months in 2019 to shoot the pilot. “She had some sort of deal, HBO sent her the first few scripts, and she said it was like nothing she’d seen before,” Down says. Girls had been hugely influential on Down and Kay. “What if the people on Girls had the same interests and challenges and desires, but were actually in a place where they were very ambitious and motivated by the stuff we were in our 20s?”\n\n“We became very good friends with her for about half a year,” Kay says, and she set the visual tone for the series. (Dunham subsequently relocated to London.) Kay and Down picked up the directorial reins this season—their first directing credits on Industry. They are incredibly thoughtful. But the sophistication can sometimes obscure clarity.\n\nDown jokes about a note Kay was giving to Ken Leung in incredibly academic terms: “And Ken was like: ‘So, slow.’”\n\nThis story pops to mind when, later, at a hotel restaurant where a “Room Upstairs” appears on the dessert menu, Kay asks for a martini in such and such a way and it comes out all wrong. He tries again—the martini-order equivalent of: “So, slow.” One can imagine Kay and Down’s direction becoming steadily clearer and more effective with reps, like when the optometrist clicks his machine toward crisper and crisper vision. It works: The bartender’s second take comes out perfect.\n\n“Welcome back to the last real HBO drama, JP Morgan Euphoria,” X user Myles Brown tweeted when the first trailer dropped earlier this summer. My thoughts exactly.\n\nSo, what will season three of JP Morgan Euphoria bring? There is an episode of tachycardiac heart palpitations that rivals the last act of Uncut Gems; a lot of nose drugs; a lot of Pet Shop Boys; some blood; some death; a broccoli perm; principals having fun; Kit Harington having more fun; so, so much money, but no one really actually enjoying it; and that delicious cold cocktail of wealth, power, and politics.\n\nLet me tell you the scene in the first episode that announced the return of Industry for me. Eric (Ken Leung) and Yasmin (Marisa Abela), who haven’t spent all that much time in close quarters together over the first two seasons, have bumped into each other at a restaurant, and now they’re back at Yasmin’s lawyer friend’s chambers when the coke comes out. Eric, recently split from his wife and free-falling into an extended “say yes to everything” midlife crisis, looks at the offering and shares expectantly: “I haven’t done blow since 9/11.” Yasmin begs off at first, to keep up appearances in front of her new boss. But quickly gives up the charade and confesses what all viewers know to be true: “Yeah…this is what I’m good at.” Next thing we know, Eric and Yasmin are face-to-face, Yasmin wearing her friend’s barrister’s wig, Eric looking at last himself—in that perfect coke-scene blocking that brings to mind classics of the genre. (Roller Girl and Amber Waves in Boogie Nights hoovering up a desert and, in perfect desperate grandiosity, screaming: “Let’s never leave this room!”) This single scene cuts through what another show might spend a season tiptoeing toward: Eric and Yasmin speaking directly to one another; the adventures of these two begin right here, right now. Playing in the background: “Feel the Drive” by Doctor’s Cat. It, like so much of the show’s music, is new wave Thatcher-core, ’80s Italo disco or London-banker synth-pop. (“It’s cokey music,” Down says. “No one wants to like—I would assume—would want to take coke and listen to Wilco.”) And then, as things in the scene get pushed to the edge of are-they-really-going-to-go-there, a perfect 5 a.m. light presses up against the windows like a headache—reminding both participants and viewers that work starts very, very soon.\n\nThis, to me, is an Industry signature. It’s uncountable the number of times a character finds themselves encountering that dawn light and has to go into work and get after it immediately. The opening bell indifferent to last night’s personal exploits. The market ready to rock. Nothing in film and television—not murder, not adultery, not serial lying, not compulsive gambling—gets my adrenaline spiking like having to watch someone show up to their job with substances in their system and everything on the line. These characters have money, power, and swagger. But there’s still no magic cure for a cocaine hangover. Just the universal attendant regret and shame, and the palpable fear, all day long, that if you fail to execute the way you know you can when you’re sober and slept, you might cost yourself, and everyone else around you, everything. Season three returns like a freight train with that feeling, that music, that panic of dawn.\n\nAnd no music articulates dawn, for me, like Nathan Micay’s score. The sounds of the first cup of coffee in the morning. Of carpe diem. Of fresh starts. Of arriving at the office. Of the buzz of money, success, and anything is possible. The music of dawn can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what happened last night. On the trading floor at Pierpoint, the Industry score always asks its characters the same question: Have I arrived in heaven or have I arrived in hell?\n\nEarlier this week, Down and Kay premiered the new season at a screening in New York. They’d spent the weekend getting intimately involved with Manhattan—making stops at Fanelli Café, Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi, Via Carota, The Waverly Inn, and The Grill. It was an Industry-grade hit list. “I’ve had this fantasy for about 15 years of living in New York,” Kay had told me at one point in London. But life and work had always intervened.\n\nAt the party, surrounded by colleagues, friends, and family, he was a little punch-drunk. Due to the pandemic, this was the first proper premiere for the show—and it had the feeling of a series launch. “I’m dissociating a little,” Kay said. “This feels like it’s happening to someone else.”\n\nSeason three suggests that the characters and the show—and, yes, certainly its creators—are interested in pushing the edges of its canvas further still. But how do you grow bigger than the biggest questions in British money, media, politics, and power? With a couple of American leads, and other characters with interests in entirely new industries—one can fantasize a little about Industry moving beyond the boundaries of Britain. Theirs is an island, after all. And where do you go when you’ve run out of island? To quote their beloved Pet Shop Boys: Go West."
