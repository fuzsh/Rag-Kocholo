        "text": "Inside Out 2 has emerged as one of the films of the summer, earning rave reviews and ratings, and boasting a star-studded voice cast including the likes of Maya Hawke, Ayo Edebiri and Amy Poehler. Aside from these well-known names though, an up-and-coming actress is grabbing attention, too.\n\nEnter Adèle Exarchopoulos, who had already accumulated an impressive resume by age 19 with appearances in eight films. However, it was her role in the 2013 film adaptation of La Vie d’Adèle (Blue Is the Warmest Colour) that catapulted her to fame and earned her a shelf-load of awards.\n\nFast forward a decade and Exarchopoulos is ready to take Hollywood by storm. In Pixar’s Inside Out 2, she lent her voice to the character of Ennui. Designed to create distance between main character Riley and her parents, Ennui is the embodiment of boredom and lethargy who’s constantly on the couch, scrolling her phone.\n\nBut just who is this ingénue actress who conquered the French film world and has her eyes set on the US?\n\nAdèle Exarchopoulos made her breakthrough in a controversial film\n\nAdèle Exarchopoulos, born in 1993 to a Greek father and a French mother in Paris, found her passion for acting early in life. At just nine years old, she began attending acting classes to overcome her shyness, according to her IMDB. Her career took off when she was scouted by an agent in 2006.\n\nExarchopoulos delivered a nuanced and powerful performance in Blue is the Warmest Colour, which received widespread acclaim at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Her portrayal earned her the prestigious Palme d’Or, making her the youngest recipient of the festival’s top prize. She also claimed the Most Promising Actress award at the 2013 Césars, France’s national film awards.\n\nDespite the film’s critical success, controversy surrounded its production. Per The Guardian, both Exarchopoulos and her co-star Léa Seydoux have since criticised the film’s director, Abdellatif Kechiche, citing a fight scene that caused Exarchopoulos to bleed and a sex scene that was filmed over 10 days. Seydoux later said she “felt like a prostitute” at times while on the set.\n\nAdditionally, Exarchopoulos faced criticism from the LGBTQ+ community, who argued that, as a straight woman, she and her co-star did not have the right to depict a lesbian relationship. Exarchopoulos defended her role in the film in response, dismissing the argument as “really stupid” during an interview with the Los Angeles Times.\n\nShe has gone on to build an admirable career\n\nFollowing her triumph at Cannes with Blue is the Warmest Colour, Exarchopoulos continued to build a diverse portfolio across dramas, comedies, fantasies, and romances, mainly in France. Her talent has been recognised with several Césars as well as numerous awards from international film organisations.\n\nBeyond her achievements in European cinema, Exarchopoulos has made several appearances in Hollywood films. She starred alongside Ralph Fiennes in 2019’s The White Crow, a biopic about Soviet-born ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, and had a role in the 2016 film The Last Face, which featured Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem, and was directed by Sean Penn.\n\nWho has Adèle Exarchopoulos dated?\n\nPer Vanity Fair France, she had a three-year relationship with model-turned actor Jérémie Laheurte, her co-star in Blue is the Warmest Color, before moving on to date French rapper Doums – real name Morgan Frémont and a member of French hip-hop collective L’entourage – in 2016. In 2017, the couple welcomed a son named Ismaël, but eventually separated in 2021, according to France’s Version Femina.\n\nShe’s an activist\n\nIn addition to her career and personal life, Exarchopoulos is also actively engaged in social and political causes. Per Tako Magazine, she is a staunch advocate for gender equality and women’s rights, environmental issues, and cultural preservation. Earlier this summer, she also joined over 230 public figures in France in signing an open letter urging French president Emmanuel Macron to recognise the state of Palestine, per Middle East Eye.\n\nOutside of acting and activism, Exarchopoulos has also made a significant impact in the fashion world. The actress is a frequent attendee of the major fashion weeks and has been spotted in the front row of shows by Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu and Fendi."
