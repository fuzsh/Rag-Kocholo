While most people assume seventeen-year-old Lenora was responsible, the police were never able to prove it. Other than her denial after the killings, she has never spoken publicly about that night, nor has she set foot outside Hope‚Äôs End, the cliffside mansion where the massacre occurred.Stabbed her father with a knifeTook her mother‚Äôs happy lifeIt‚Äôs now 1983, and home-health aide Kit McDeere arrives at a decaying Hope‚Äôs End to care for Lenora after her previous nurse fled in the middle of the night. In her seventies and confined to a wheelchair, Lenora was rendered mute by a series of strokes and can only communicate with Kit by tapping out sentences on an old typewriter. One night, Lenora uses it to make a tantalizing offer‚ÄîI want to tell you everything.‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me,‚Äù Lenora saidBut she‚Äôs the only one not deadAs Kit helps Lenora write about the events leading to the Hope family massacre, it becomes clear there‚Äôs more to the tale than people know. But when new details about her predecessor‚Äôs departure come to light, Kit starts to suspect Lenora might not be telling the complete truth‚Äîand that the seemingly harmless woman in her care could be far more dangerous than she first thought.\n\nRelease Date: June 20th, 2023\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nPages: 368\n\nRating: ‚≠ê\n\nWhat I Liked:\n\n1. The cover is a great\n\n2. Kept me guessing for 50 pages\n\nWhat I Didn't Like:\n\n1. Take a shot every-time the word murder is mentioned - (101 times)\n\n2. Some parts feel like repeats of Lock Every Door\n\n3. Kit is stupid\n\n4. 98 mentions of the word terrace\n\n5. That ending is too much\n\nOverall Thoughts:\n\nWell here we are again. Finding ourselves in another Riley Sager book. Perhaps you're wondering what I'm doing here reading another book by this author when I've hated all his other books, well I believe in chances. Maybe this will be the one that I'm convinced is a great book. Maybe not?\n\nIf you LOVE books with so much going on than this is the book for you!\n\nAs usual we got our normal Sager setup;\n\n‚úîÔ∏èPoor female character (always broke)\n\n‚úîÔ∏èNo family or friends (that care or have abandoned her)\n\n‚úîÔ∏èHot handyman\n\n‚úîÔ∏èCreepy location/isolated location\n\nI pause before driving away. ‚ÄúThanks for helping me with the gate. I‚Äôm not sure what I would have done if you hadn‚Äôt come by.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think you would have managed somehow.‚Äù Carter studies me, his head tilted in curious appraisal. ‚ÄúYou strike me as being pretty resourceful.‚Äù\n\nOh does she? You've known her for like 30 seconds!\n\nKit's dad is a handyman too. Is Sager fucking with us? Is there a camera in my Kindle so he can see my reaction? Another handyman...\n\nAnother woman meeting another woman and instantly becoming friends with her after 20 seconds.\n\nMary disappearing like Erica did from Lock Every Door. One day she's there and then gone.\n\nThis book is 360+ pages and on every page you WILL read about the murder over and over again.\n\nMary's suicide note survived being on her while she was in the water for almost two weeks.\n\nKit asks Jessie if anyone else knew about the typewriter and Jessie mentions only Mary knew about it and that Lenora could type. That isn't true as Mrs. Baker did know about it because she mentions that Mary bought Lenora a typewriter.\n\nAlso makes zero sense why she didn't get the two pages she saved from her lockbox that Lenora typed to show to Detective. Vick.\n\nSpeaking of the detective. He's an idiot. Of course someone would leave in the middle of the night if they didn't want to be questioned why they had a suitcase. You leave during the day and you risk people asking questions.\n\nI am confused. Lorena is clearly pregnant - as seen in the photo, but her family just doesn't notice she's pregnant?\n\nMrs. Baker comments that the house was built in 1913 when Lenora was born but Lorena was born in 1912.\n\nThe gross way Riley Sager writes about a girl who just turned 17 in sexual situations made me creeped out. Talking about them having sex and her grabbing this grown man's penis. No no no. Can men just stop writing about underage girls having sex in an enjoyable way.\n\nSo I know that the police thought she killed her family but what happened that she got off of the murder charge? The book hasn't mentioned anything about that. Was someone else arrested? They just her be free and didn't charge her?\n\nHere I am actually somewhat enjoying this book but Riley Sager gotta Riley Sager and of course the trespasser on Lenora Hope's property is Kenny. The fucking fuck chance that it would be Kenny that happens to come torment this ladies house while Kit is there for only 4 days is like win the lotto chances. Not only that but he couldn't have been that far from her and not have noticed it was her if she could jump off the porch and catch him in a few strides. I eye rolled. It makes no sense that Kenny would go make fun of the lady who was accused of murdering her family if he's already sleeping with a woman who's also accused of the same thing.\n\nYou know a good way to know if someone is sneaking out and walking around?... Look at their feet. If they are dirty she's been walking. Plus if she was walking wouldn't she have some kind of muscle mass on her legs?\n\nI don't know how they kept all this typing quiet. Typewriters are not quiet at all. Nothing about a typewriter is quiet. When you reach the end of the row it's loud and then you have to slide it back.\n\nIt feels so outlandish that all this stuff happened in a week;\n\n-Kit finds Mary dead\n\n-House is completely falling into the ocean (every night)\n\n-Dragged Lenora downstairs\n\n-Everyone went to a funeral\n\n-Lenora writing so much in 4 days with like one hand\n\n-Her dad showing up\n\n-Kenny showing up\n\nI don't get why Mrs. Baker left the typewriter there if she was worried about Lenora being able to communicate with it or even letting Mary bring it into the house.\n\nHonestly I don't know why I always feel like I'm reading the same book by this author. There's always some woman that's in financial trouble, finds a way to make money/house, finds out this mystery there, won't leave, has to solve mystery, and then gets fucked over by person she thinks she can trust who she thinks she is helping.\n\nSo the house had a 17 year old cook with no experience cooking for them? This rich family and this is what they had.\n\nBerniece holding onto the secret of what happened that night in 1929 for fifty-four years only for Kit s to sit down for 2 seconds and say she has to tell her is stupid. Like why would she tell this stranger everything???\n\nSo everyone thinks this 17 year old girl killed her parents and somehow was able to hang her sister all without anyone fighting back and her sister just standing there letting herself be hanged.\n\nDon't let Detective Vick solve your murder. He thinks a hand typed message as a suicide note is a confession. Like anyone can type that message. Also detective just walking around with a copy of it. Like he has no other cases going on.\n\nKit has thee weakest case as to that Virginia is alive and Mrs Baker is Lenora - the urn is empty (they could have put her ashes over the edge of the cliff) - and she has blue eyes (lots of people have blue eyes). Ah and how easy everyone just admits things to Kit is laughable.\n\nThe baby was born but he was only 6 months old. How was he eating? How was he okay enough to be wiggling around and crying? A baby thst small couldn't even eat on their own. Okay we'll pretend it's just a normal full term baby.\n\nHow did the detective not notice Virginia and Lenora looked similar? He worked at the house and didn't recognize them in the least? He even watched Virginia in the room and never thought it was weird. It's even the same room they put Virginia in before.\n\nAlso Berniece gets all that money and is blackmailing the family for that long but she never goes anywhere, just stays in the same town? And once Lenora ak√° Virginia was unable to do anything for herself why did Mrs. Baker continue to pay the ransom? It's not like she could go to prison as she has no idea what's going on? Also once Virginia was ruled dead how would Berniece had known the truth that she was still alive if the doctor was in on the lie? How deep does this cover up go... Are the grocery people in on it too that they don't think it's odd that adult diapers are being delivered to the house. Who's filling the medicine if the old doctor is dead?\n\nOh Kit - she's so fucking dumb! She suspects it's Carter that killed Mary. Does she wait until she's away from him and in a safe place to accuse him? No! She does it right in her car. She then threatens him with a fucking corkscrew opener lol. How ridiculous. Dude is right there and could just grab it from her. And once she has Carter out of the car does she drive away somewhere safe and not led what she believes is a killer to her dad's house? No again! She drives the few feet to her dad's and jumps out so he knows where he lives.\n\nOh and once Kit goes to her dad's and finds the house empty you just KNOW her dad killed Mary because even though he KNEW she was coming over (she LITERALLY called him like probably an hour before) he decides to leave this suitcase out and leave the house. Like wtf??? Oh let's talk about how she just now remember that everyone calls him Pat - Patrick McDeere ak√° Ricky!!! Ricky!!?? Who would ever tie those together?\n\n\"On the phone, I gave away that Virginia was alive, accidentally leading him right to her.\"\n\nNo she didn't. He knew she was alive when he saw Virginia and when he read the notes that were typewritten.\n\nDon't worry... Kit doesn't pick up any weapons once in the house, she's got her trusty corkscrew. She puts it next to Virginia's bed - I'm sure that won't be used later to go into Ricky (It did!)\n\nWhy would Mary go to Ricky's house to get blood work when she already had Virginia's blood? She didn't need his. She had the woman's and Virginia never mentioned the kid being someone else's so why would she need to prove that? Not only that Pat(ricky) mentions that Virginia write the store when Mary got back from talking to him do if that's true why would she still leave the gate open? Why wouldn't she had let Carter know everything that happened? She knew at that he was a murderer, but she did nothing to protect herself?\n\nWhy did Kit's dad run into the house while it was crumbling? What was the point of that?\n\nSo Virginia could walk (not shocked it was mentioned in chapter 33)\n\n\"For a restless girl like me who lost every time my father forced us to play the game in which he locked us in our rooms, I shockingly had no trouble spending most of my time in bed. Very quickly, I learned how to lay very still, sometimes for hours, while my mind roamed the world, going wherever I wanted, whenever I wanted.\"\n\nSo stupid. Imagine pissing and shitting yourself for over 50 years just to spite your sister. The other reason is that incase her son found her she'd be there... Dude that's how she'd want him to find her? Living life like she was paralyzed and then what was her game plan just get up and tell everyone she was joking?? What would her son think of her then? She's a nutcase.\n\nHow did caregivers not notice that Virginia had legs that were toned from walking? Were her feet never dirty from the ground and walking? She just walked around in the dark with no lights.\n\nOmg now we find out that Jessie is really Virginia's granddaughter. Are you kidding me???! Why would Mrs. Baker tell Jessie anything about the past? She knows what a messed up family they are but she'll put her in danger telling her about them.\n\nApparently Jessie can make fake passports.. I mean who can't honestly?\n\nHow Kit just forgives Virginia is weird to me. Like no no no she was pretending to be sick for so long and even months after she knew she should tell her everything but she just disappears one day.\n\nSo Virginia becomes a superstar because of her life. She gets to travel. Gets married in her 70s. And lives this grand life.\n\nWow what a convoluted ending.... So Ricardo was actually sleeping with Archie. They were going to run away that night. Ricky was some random local help that left that night too. Lenora is pretending to be Mrs. Baker and had Virginia killed off but told people that the real Virginia was Lenora. They were being blackmailed by Berniece because she thought Virginia was sleeping with Ricardo and thay was his baby. The real Mrs. Baker moved to Canada with the baby. Virginia tried to kill herself. I'm sorry this plot is one step away from the evil twin did it and switch places with the good twin and took her life. Jessie is really Virginia's granddaughter. Kit's dad is Ricky and Ricky was paid off to leave Virginia alone. Ricky killed Virginia's mother. Virginia's mother killed Virginia's father.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nSometimes less is more. There was just too much going on in this book and not in a good way. This book read like one long soap opera. I'll admit the beginning of the book started interesting for me and I was enjoying it but then somewhere down the line just too many insane things kept happening. Sadly the things happening were pretty predictable so I wasn't ever shocked when they did in fact happen.\n\nThank God this is the last book that the author has to write for his contract because I'd be curious to see what he comes up with when he isn't forced to write a book every year.\n\nRecommend For:\n\n‚Ä¢ Mysterious stories\n\n‚Ä¢ Soap operas\n\n‚Ä¢ Complex storylines\n\n‚Ä¢ Timelines\n\nIG | Blog\n\nThanks to Netgalley and the publishers for this advanced copy of the book.

Maybe this one the main character will fall in love with a male handyman ghost. üôÑ\n\nJune 25, 2023\n\nI am starting to feel as if I am marooned on OUTLIER ISLAND üèùÔ∏è\n\nIt‚Äôs 1983, and home health aide Kit McDeere has just been cleared to return to work after a 6 month suspension she was given after a patient died on her watch. Pills that should have been locked up overnight were left within reach of the suffering woman.\n\nWas it negligence, or did Kit assist the patient in taking her own life?\n\nHer new assignment?\n\nThe one that nobody else will take, and the only one that she is being offered‚Ä¶.to care for 71 year old, Leonora Hope, who in 1929, at the age of seventeen, was accused of killing both her parents and her sister in their cliffside home-although Police could never prove their case.\n\nLeonora is now silent, bedridden, and has only partial use of one hand. Mrs. Baker, the dour housekeeper, assures Kit that no matter what Leonora may have done in the past, she is most certainly harmless now.\n\nShe instructs Kit on the very strict routine she will be expected to follow, and leads her to her room, so she can get started. It adjoins her patient‚Äôs, but still contains the uniforms and personal articles of her predecessor, Mary, who left suddenly in the night‚Ä¶\n\nI LOVED the gothic atmosphere of the house that is tilting precariously above the crashing waves on a crumbling cliffside‚Ä¶\n\nKit discovers that Leonora can ‚Äútype‚Äù or at least hit one key at a time on a typewriter, and that she wants to tell her story about that tragic night.\n\nAnd, until the FINAL üíØ PAGES, I was LOVING this story‚Ä¶.\n\nBUT THEN‚Ä¶it got TOO TWISTY for my personal taste, relying on too many coincidences, and becoming too OTT. I did like certain PARTS of the final reveal but I feel like we could have gotten there on a much more plausible path.\n\nSometimes less is more, but this is the author‚Äôs second book in a row where he has taken the amount of twists further than he needed too-IMO.\n\nSigh.\n\nSo, here I sit (again) on Outlier Island üèùÔ∏è. I do hope that you enjoy this as much as many of my friends who have awarded it the full 5 stars. If not, I will be waiting . üçπ\n\n3.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è (since I loved the first two thirds) but rounding down because the ending counts for a lot for me!\n\nA buddy read with Mary Beth who LOVED all of the twists, so be sure to check out her review for another perspective!\n\nThank You to the Chandler Public Library for the loan.\n\nAvailable Now!\n\nJune 24, 2023\n\nThe Only One Left is Riley Sager‚Äôs BEST thriller to date! This twisty Gothic mystery will leave even savvy thriller readers gasping until the very last page.\n\nWelcome to The Fall of the House of Usher meets Verity!\n\n‚ÄúAt seventeen, Lenora Hope\n\nHung her sister with a rope\n\nStabbed her father with a knife\n\nTook her mother‚Äôs happy life\n\n‚ÄòIt wasn‚Äôt me,‚Äô Lenora said\n\nBut she‚Äôs the only one not dead‚Äù\n\nIn 1983, Kit McDeere lost her job as a home-health aide when one of her patients died under suspicious circumstances. Kit is given one last opportunity of employment, a job that will require her to care for Lenora Hope, the longtime suspect in the murder of her whole family. She accepts the job working at Hope‚Äôs End, a decaying mansion on a cliff, but soon suspects things are not as they appear. Secrets, lies, and deception run amuck in Hope‚Äôs End. Who actually killed the Hope family? Will Kit find the answers before the decrepit mansion collapses?\n\nI absolutely devoured this book. I am a huge Riley Sager fan and had been disappointed in some of his more recent over the top thrillers. However, he got this one just right! If you read one thriller this year, make sure that it is The Only One Left! You will not be disappointed!\n\n5/5 stars\n\nExpected publication date: 6/20/23\n\nReview selected for June 2023 issue of Library Reads. You can see it here: https://libraryreads.org\n\nThank you to Edelweiss, Penguin Random House Publishing and Brian Wilson for the ARC of The Only One Left in exchange for an honest review.\n\nOctober 1, 2023\n\nThank you Hodder & Stoughton for the ARC in exchange for an honest review. IYKYK, my reviews are ALWAYS honest.\n\nFull review to come.\n\nPROS AND CONS\n\nPros: faster pace compared to his previous books that I read (Final Girls and The Last Time I Lied, synopsis trapped my ass, writing wasn't totally asstastic ... I guess....?\n\nCons: makes no damn sense, repetitive, forced suspense, ending was so buckwild it felt like Sager was trolling\n\nAugust 17, 2024\n\n**4.5-stars rounded up**\n\nAfter a client overdoses while under care, home-health aide, Kit McDeere, finds herself suspended from her job for 6-months. That's a long time to be out of work, stewing on her past mistakes. Kit doesn't like the feeling.\n\nWhen her suspension is up, her boss tells her about her new assignment. Oh baby, it's a doozy!\n\nUnfortunately, she's lucky to even still have her job, so Kit doesn't put up much of a fight though. Beggars can't be choosers. At least it will get her out of her Dad's house.\n\nKit is headed to Hope's End, a once lavish estate on the rocky coast of Maine. Set high on a cliff, the home has slowly begun to decay over the decades, leaning ever closer to the sea below.\n\nEven so, it's not the mansion itself that disturbs Kit the most. It's who lives inside it. Lenora Hope, Kit's latest client, is the sole survivor of the Hope Family Massacre of 1929. As the survivor, Lenora was the main suspect and was accused of killing her father, mother and sister.\n\nThe crimes are so infamous in the local area, there's even a creepy little song about it:\n\nAt seventeen, Lenora Hope\n\nHung her sister with a rope\n\nStabbed her father with a knife\n\nTook her mother‚Äôs happy life\n\n‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me,‚Äù Lenora said\n\nBut she‚Äôs the only one not dead\n\nKit knows what it's like to be accused of something however, so she tries to stick all she thinks she knows about Lenora Hope into the back of her mind. Regardless of her past, Lenora is now a woman in her 70s, who has been left mute and incapacitated by a series of strokes.\n\nConfined to a wheelchair, Lenora is completely dependent on Kit for her daily care. Her only means of communication is pecking out her thoughts on an old typewriter.\n\nOne night, through her typing, Lenora makes Kit and offer. She wants to tell her everything that happened back in 1929. Is Kit ready to hear the truth?\n\nThere was something about the synopsis of this story that told me that I should read it via audio. I was interested to see how the perspectives would be done and how the audio could possibly elevate the overall storytelling.\n\nIn spite of the fact that I bought a hard copy on the day of release, I did actually hold out until I was able to get the audiobook from my local library. I'm so glad I made that decision. I loved this audio. It's actually the first Riley Sager novel I have listened too.\n\nI may have to go back and reread some of the others that way, if they are all done this well!\n\nThe narrators' voices were perfect for the different perspectives they were portraying. It really helped to bring this story to life for me.\n\nThe setting of Hope Manor was also fantastic. With Lenora confined to her room, it's really just the workers that keep the property afloat, flitting about interacting with one another. Kit, as the new girl, just tries to go about her work, soaking it all in.\n\nThere's so much history in the house, and each individual there offers their own perspective on the past, as well as the present. Trust, there's drama.\n\nI loved the use of the typewriter as a way for Lenora to communicate and tell Kit her story. There was something so ominous about that act. Lenora watching each letter appear as the past unfolded before her.\n\nThere's also some unsettling things going on around the house that provided a nice, is it supernatural, is it not supernatural-feel, that I tend to enjoy so much. Oh, and bonus, this is set in 1983 and I love the 80s!!\n\nThere were a lot of well done red herrings in this, as your mind works to try to figure out the truth. I suspected a lot of people; pretty much everyone, honestly. There were also a ton of twists and I enjoyed how Sager built the intensity as the story progressed.\n\nIt felt dangerous and definitely got my pulse racing. Right after I finished though, I did struggle a bit on how to rate it. Part of me thought, it was one twist too many, but then the other part of me thought, shut the f*ck up.\n\nAs you can tell, the good side won. I loved this. Another engrossing, memorable story from Sager. I cannot wait to see what he delivers next!\n\nJuly 20, 2023\n\nA mansion, a murder, and more twists than I could count!\n\nI was on the library list, but couldn't wait and got my own copy from Audible. Yes, it was worth it!\n\nHope's End has 36 rooms and a bird's eye view of the sea. \"What you're feeling is the house\" says the housekeeper, Mrs. Baker. Boy, she wasn't lying! So close to the cliff''s edge and a straight drop down to the water, I almost felt dizzy myself. üò±\n\nKit-Kat is the new \"nurse\" tending to Ms. Hope at the mansion. Kit soon learns that she wants to share what really happened the night of the murders! She wonders why Ms. Hope trusts her, but must know the truth.\n\nClick, click, tap, tap..............\n\nThe old, cranky typewriter spills the beans one page at a time. I was anxiously awaiting the taps to learn more too! The lies, the sprinkled hints and the half truths. Keep em coming! Just when you think the final twist happens, slap! another kicker will knock you silly.\n\nThis one was like walking through a spooky crooked fun house! Thanks Mr. Sager for a page turner that kept me curious throughout. üëèüëèüëè\n\nDecember 5, 2023\n\nNo doooobra, nie mia≈Ço to wiele sensu, ale bawi≈Çam siƒô dobrze ü•πü•π\n\nJuly 6, 2023\n\nOk this might be best one yet!! The ending definitely gave me whiplash but I loved every minute of it and had such a BLAST ü§©\n\nJuly 1, 2024\n\n4.5/5 üî™ ü©∏\n\nThis genuinely shocked me, I had been in such a thriller slump prior to this and this gave me that adrenaline feeling. A gothic old mansion atop an eroding cliffside, full of dark rich family secrets. I was too afraid to read this at night. The plot twists just kept on coming and I didn't see them coming.\n\n‚ô°Ô∏é.·êü‡™ú‚ÅÄ‚û¥ Plot:\n\nAs rumour has it, Lenora Hope murdered her mother, father and sister in their home. Since then she suffers multiple strokes that leave her paralysed and in need of constant care. Our main character Kit, a carer, gets this assignment as punishment for letting a previous patient die on her watch.\n\nThis was so eerie and and exhilarating, the plot moved at a good pace and was just addicting. It has a somewhat isolated setting with the presence of an unreliable narrator (both of my favourites.) It was unpredictable - and this is coming from someone who has read 18 other thrillers this year (all of which were somewhat predictable and underwhelming). All parts of the story come together and get tied up in a neat little bow. The ending felt extremely satisfying right up until the last page.\n\n‚ô°Ô∏é.·êü‡™ú‚ÅÄ‚û¥ Characters:\n\nIn thrillers, I feel like most of the time their often too short to get attached to the characters - I can't say too much with out spoilers, but the only character I really resonated with was Virginia (Lenora), who I was picturing as like an older woman who still is firey and cheeky\n\nI feel like they all are well developed characters though and they are all written really well - I felt they all got their deserved ending. I found Kit a bit frustrating sometimes in the way that she was quite brash, but other than that I enjoyed following her journey ‚ô°.\n\n‚ÇäÀö‚äπ‚ô° reading log\n\nhours of reading: 5.6\n\navg. minutes per session: 18\n\navg. pages per minute: 3.3\n\n14/06 11:31am\n\noh my goodness i did NOT see that coming that's so wild, i sort of got an inkling that the plot twist would be in that overall area because of the few chapters before it, but honestly i thought it was heading towards a completely different direction\n\n13/06 11:10pm\n\nso now i‚Äôm too scared to read this at night - i‚Äôm suddenly aware of all my surroundings and looking out my window constantly - this is going to give me nightmares\n\n13/06 9:13am ¬∞Àñ‚û¥\n\ni'm at 30% and I don't have any theories yet, which is unlike me but this jessie girl drives me up the wall\n\n12/06 8:06pm ¬∞Àñ‚û¥\n\ni am getting creepy vibes off the bat this is a good sign:)\n\n‚ÇäÀö‚äπ‚ô° pre-reading\n\ni am on the hunt for a thrilling thriller please it‚Äôs been so long - this has been on the TBR for a hot minute so let‚Äôs get stuck in ‚ãÜ‚ú¥Ô∏éÀöÔΩ°‚ãÜ\n\nÔ∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂ ‚äπ Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂‚†Ä‡≠®‚ô°‡≠ß‚†ÄÔ∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂ ‚äπ Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂\n\njune tbr:\n\n‡≤á. first lie wins\n\n‡≤á. the only one left\n\n‡≤á. leather & lark\n\n‡≤á. if something happens to me\n\n‡≤á. the familiar\n\n‡≤á. the warm hands of ghosts\n\n‡≤á. a court of silver flames\n\n+ the ballad of never after\n\nMay 23, 2023\n\nA spooky mansion frozen in time, perched on the rocky cliffs, and slowly crumbling towards the churning waters of the Atlantic below - this is Hope‚Äôs End, the home of elderly Lenora Hope, the only surviving member of her family. Her mother, father, and sister were murdered in a blood fest one night in 1929, with Lenora being the main suspect. However, she completely denied it and the evidence wasn‚Äôt enough to convict her, but the townspeople have always believed that she‚Äôs guilty, and her reputation is reduced to a schoolyard chant, much like the infamous Lizzie Borden -\n\nAt seventeen, Lenora Hope\n\nHung her sister with a rope\n\nStabbed her father with a knife\n\nTook her mother‚Äôs happy life\n\nIt‚Äôs now 1983, and Kit McDeere arrives at Hope‚Äôs End as a caregiver to Lenora. It isn‚Äôt a job that she wants, but after one of her patients died in suspicious circumstances, well it‚Äôs a case of beggars can‚Äôt be choosers. To say she‚Äôs apprehensive is an understatement, Kit has grown up with the stories about Lenora and understandably, that makes her anxious. She‚Äôs even more anxious when she discovers that Lenora‚Äôs previous caregiver, Mary, left the house in the middle of the night and hasn‚Äôt been seen or heard of since!\n\nThe creaky old mansion is the perfect backdrop for this creepy story, and I hadn‚Äôt a clue what was really going on, who or what to believe, but of course that made it all the more interesting! With twist after twist towards the end, Sagar has created a story of mystery and suspense that ensures the pages keep on turning ever faster.\n\n*Thank you to Netgalley and Hodder and Stoughton for an ARC in exchange for an honest unbiased review *\n\nJuly 2, 2024\n\nMy first Riley Sager book and I have mixed feelings. It started off amazing. I loved the first half, especially the eerie horror vibes. But then the second half dragged and wasn't that enjoyable.\n\nThe characters were all meh but the story was pretty decent. Baker in particular was too annoying. I didn't really connect to any of the characters and thank God for that....\n\nThe ending killed it for me tho, in a bad way. There were too many reveals and plot twists and the more that happened the less it impacted.\n\nThanks to lovely Tanu for the BR. The book might have let me down but it was fun theorizing with you ü•∞\n\n~‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~\n\nWhat do we think of this book guys?\n\nAugust 8, 2024\n\nI screamed aloud and threw tantrums when the publishing company rejected my ARC request as a devoted fan of the author!\n\nThe gothic vibes and the unsolved cold case surrounding a dangerous woman, who gives off scary vibes to kids singing a rhyme about her possible murders like she's Bloody Mary, were the most intriguing aspects that drew me blindly into this story.\n\nLenora Hope Hung, in her early seventies and bedridden after a recent stroke that took away her ability to function properly, types her mysterious story about the incidents that occurred 54 years ago, resulting in the deaths of her entire family: her parents were stabbed, and her sister was hanged.\n\nKit McDeere, a beggar with no other options and a caregiver with a tarnished reputation, is accused of manslaughter after her latest patient dies from a drug overdose due to her mistake. She becomes an outcast, humiliated by reporters who imply that she is the killer. When she is offered a job as the caretaker for Lenora Hope Hung, an urban legend and presumed killer in town, she sees it as an opportunity for work, money, and a chance to escape the house she shares with her father, who has been giving her the silent treatment since her mandatory job leave.\n\nBut as soon as she sets foot in the mansion perched on the edge of cliffs, she feels the darkness and an ominous sensation creeping around the rooms. The previous caregiver, Mary, vanished into thin air one night, offering no explanation and leaving her belongings behind.\n\nThe remaining staff in the house, including the maid and cook who were present during the timeline of the murders, not only give Kit the creeps but also the cracking voices that come from Lenora's bedroom at night and the objects that mysteriously change places, increasing her unease. Kit finds herself trapped in this place without any financial security, and the only form of communication she has with Lenora is through a typewriter, as she tries to uncover the truth about what happened on that tragic night.\n\nI can honestly say that this book is my least favorite work by the author. It wasn't slow-paced, but the main mystery didn't capture my interest, and I couldn't connect with either Lenora or Kit, despite having a soft spot for outsiders who suffer from loneliness. I didn't care about how the story would evolve or what conclusions would be revealed in the end. The twists were still unpredictable, but I found them a bit far-fetched. The story didn't feel too realistic, and there were too many coincidences.\n\nThe only thing I loved was the plot idea and the gothic vibes the house provided as a memorable character in the story. However, I felt that Lenora's character could have been further developed and explored to add depth to the narrative.\n\nOverall, I didn't enjoy this book as much as the author's other novels, which led me to give it a solid three stars‚Äîit's not bad, but it didn't meet my expectations.\n\nmedium.com\n\ninstagram\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\n4/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è This was so good! I really enjoyed myself, like I knew I would. It had all the creepy and suspenseful vibes it promised. The story follows Kit, who works as a caregiver for a home health aide agency. She has been assigned to take care of Lenora Hall. When she was younger, Lenora was accused of murdering her entire family. That immediately had me hooked because along with Kit, I also wanted to know if it was true and why she did it! It also takes place in the 80‚Äôs, so the vibes were immaculate! üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è\n\nI loved this book and the vibes but my main issue was the main character, Kit. I wish she would have been smarter ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Some of her actions had me questioning her intelligence. She needed to learn to keep her mouth shut and stop trusting everyone she came across üò≠. That annoyed me so much!\n\nThis was definitely more of a slow burn thriller but I enjoyed it! And those twists?? I did not see them coming at all!!! So good!\n\nMay 13, 2023\n\nRiley, here takes this.... üî´ and shoot me already! Cause I'm done with this s*** show.\n\nCan I get at least one decent and likeable character from this book? Is it that hard to write only one good character so I can root for him/her through this entire hell ride?\n\n\"I want to tell you everything things ive never told anyone else yes about that night because i trust you\"\n\n\"You want to know if I‚Äôm as evil as everyone says I am. The answer is no. And yes.\"\n\n\"At seventeen, Lenora Hope Hung her sister with a rope, stabbed her father with a knife, took her mother‚Äôs happy life\"\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nKit McDeere, she is a caregiver. After being suspended for six months by her agency because she is alleged to have killed her patient, she returns to work and is assigned to become a full-time nurse for an old lady that lives on the cliffs inside a massive mansion.\n\nLenora Hope, she is now seventy-one years old. Over the past twenty years, she's suffered a series of strokes that have left her mute, paralyzed, and confined to a wheelchair. All she has is limited use of her left arm. Hope's family had been murdered on October 29, 1929; her parents and sister were dead inside that mansion, and the only one left was Lenora Hope, who everyone believes is the murderer. But now she wants to tell Kit everything about what happened that night, and as she begins typing, the truth starts to reveal itself......\n\nüëÅÔ∏è This story is told in first person POV alternate between (Kit and Lenora (?))\n\nüï∞Ô∏è There is a Dual Timelines in here (Past and Present).\n\n‚ö†Ô∏èSo here is the thing: since the positive and negative things in this book come together, I'm going to put them all together in \"MY THOUGHTS.\"‚ö†Ô∏è\n\nMY THOUGHTS:\n\nüìå I really loved how the story began; it literally hooked me up from the opening because it was told from Lenora's POV, which made me feel the mystery and start guessing right from the first page.\n\nRight from the start, I felt like I was exactly inside Hope's End (the name of the mansion). I really enjoyed 'The Murder Tour',\" and how and where they got killed were presented in that tour. And I was picturing it inside my head.\n\nüìå This book is very well written; how the house looks and every room that the character visits are perfectly described. You can get the full picture of those things that the author wanted to tell you. But here's the thing: because it perfectly described every single thing, I felt the story started slowy.\n\nAlso, the author is not using the apostrophe mark when Lenora is typing to inform or ask Kit for something. I liked this detail since we know the only thing that works is her left arm, so why bother with an apostrophe mark?\n\nBut the detail also became a major problem in this book; some things were certainly overdescribed.\n\nüìå The Characters\n\nAs I said in my opening, there is literally no likeable character in this book; even the main character herself (Kit) was NAH. Also, Lenora's POV was very intense and interesting at first, but I don't know the more I read from her POV, the more I felt \"digusting.\" Well...'disgusting' is the right word to describe all of these emotions.\n\nüìå The Twist\n\nBefore I explain the twist in this book, I want to give you a little bit of an explanation: \"What is a great twist for me?\" For me a great twist is not something jaw dropping or caught me off guard. But the definition of great twist for me is something that makes more sense, acceptable, or at least have a little bit of reality check to the story itself. And the last one that didn't end up looking like it was forced to be there. It's okay to be predictable as long as there is a sense inside it.\n\nAnd unfortunately, I couldn't find a great twist in this book, but I want to do some justice to the twist. Not all of the twists in this book are bad, but I will rule out that this one is not my cup of tea, so it might work out for you but not for me. I felt the twist was too forced out to be the twist.\n\nüìå The Ending\n\nBwhahahaüòÇ, i don't know what to say.\n\nIf i want to put it in one word i think i'm going to use \"Weird\".\n\nüìå Why 2 Stars?\n\nI don't usually want to give specific explaination what makes me give this book 2 stars, but this time I think I should. It was because of my very high anticipation and expectation toward the author and the story. I was really excited when I finally read this book, and those things went too high, and that's why at the end it felt flat. I expected more, but this is all I got, so yeah, 2 stars.\n\nIf you lower your expectations a little bit, it might be work out very well for you.\n\nI DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL:\n\n‚ò†Ô∏è When a 31-year-old woman fucked a 20-year-old boy who appears to be her neighbor. They even fucked before Kit left her house to take care of Lenora; for what use are you telling me their story? DuhhhüôÑ\n\n‚ò†Ô∏è The wild thoughts that some characters had I don't know how to react to those thoughts. I found it cool, but at the same time, it also bothered me.\n\n‚ò†Ô∏è I can't understand Kit's father; to be honest, he was very odd, unreasonable, a douchebag, and a piece of sh*t.\n\nWHAT I FELT WHEN I WAS READING THIS BOOK:\n\n#{1%-5%}\n\nFor f*cking sure, I was being overly excited.\n\n#{5%-30%}\n\nI started to think about what kind of book I read; it was still good, but Jesus, it's hard to explain *sigh*\n\n#{30%-55%}\n\nI was losing my patience and getting tired of the house, the rooms, and the people's descriptions.\n\n#{55%-60%}\n\nI was thinking maybe I should move on and leave this book behind. (DNF'd)\n\n#{60%-70%}\n\nI saw hope, and I got this: maybe I can finish this book.\n\n#{70%-100%}\n\nThe story was getting more ridiculous, and the twist was also getting more unacceptable, but never mind as long as I can finish this book. Since I'm no longer excited.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nUhmm, well yeah I was disappointedüôÇ.\n\nCREDIT:\n\nThank you NetGalley and Hodder & Stoughton, for providing me with this ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\nüê•\n\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\nWow! I am so happy I received this ARC! Riley, you brought out the best in a Gothic thriller. It definitely chilled me to the bone with the setting in a decaying mansion called Hope's End. It sits on the cliffs overlooking a rocky shoreline. With the waves crashing against the cliffs, the house is slowly leaning in the direction of devastation, as the cliff disintegrates. I could not have stayed one night. The house has a chilling history. In 1929, the Hope family was murdered except for their oldest daughter Lenora. She was thought to have stabbed her mother and father to death and hung her own sister Virginia, although it never could be proven. She suffered multiple strokes after it, leaving her in a debilitated state with the usage of one hand and her only communication is tapping for yes or no.\n\nMoving forward to 1983, Lenora's last caretaker Mary left in the night and never heard from again, so her new caretaker Kit takes her place. Kit has her own dark history and is accused of killing her mother. She maintains her innocence, although the townspeople and the local police chief would love to see her prosecuted.\n\nLeery of her new assignment, Kit will be caring for a murderer and their bedrooms are connected to one another. She hears footsteps at night and someone is coming into their rooms moving things around. Lenora begins to type her story about what happened that night and the first message is \"It wasn't me.\" \"I want to tell you everything.\" My heart plunges into the story line with apprehension and trusting no one. I couldn't quite put my finger on it. The author disguises many hidden messages, so the twist at the end caught me off guard. No one is being truthful and covering a multitude of sins. The household manager, a very stern disgruntled Mrs. Baker, the staff and grounds keepers all have a part to play. You cannot imagine what is in store for you! Great job! Sager is at the top of his game with this one!\n\nThank you NetGalley and PENGUIN GROUP Dutton for this ARC in exchange for my honest review!\n\nOctober 13, 2023\n\nI think I have to give up on Riley Sager. His books just aren't for me. I dislike his style, his characters, his stories.\n\nThey make me irrationally angry, in fact.\n\nSomeone explain to me why tf the dad almost kills the old lady in order to protect himself, only to suddenly turn around and be like: \"I changed my mind, I wanna die now even though there's no reason for me to off myself whatsoever, that's just what we're doing now!\"\n\nAlso the old lady was happily, voluntarily getting her ass wiped by strangers for DECADES??? How???? Why?????? What kind of a - literally - shitty revenge is that supposed to be?!\n\nJuly 13, 2023\n\nIt‚Äôs 1983 and Kit, a home care aide, is sent to the crumbling mansion, Hope‚Äôs End, to care for the disabled and aging Lenora Hope, after her previous aide disappeared during the night.\n\nLenora is the sole survivor of her family‚Äôs massacre in 1929, and suspicion has surrounded her ever since:\n\n‚ÄúAt seventeen, Lenora Hope\n\nHung her sister with a rope\n\nStabbed her father with a knife\n\nTook her mother‚Äôs happy life.‚Äù\n\nA series of strokes has left her mute but, with help, she is able to tap out sentences on an old typewriter. Her first message to Kit? ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me‚Äù. Followed by ‚ÄúI want to tell you everything.‚Äù\n\nAs Kit helps Lenora tap out her story, strange things begin to go bump in the night, and suspicions arise surrounding her predecessor‚Äôs disappearance. Is Lenora innocent or is she being manipulated by a psychopath? What long buried secrets are being hidden? (plenty it seems!)\n\nThis was oozing Gothic atmosphere with well-developed characters, and a sinister tone. Some readers may feel there were too many twists at the end but I found it fun and a delight to read. The audiobook was excellent. Recommended for a fun summer (or anytime!) read.\n\nJuly 9, 2023\n\nI thought it couldn‚Äôt be done‚Ä¶ I thought @riley.sager could not top Home Before Dark!!!

I believe this is because the book previews sound really interesting and the reviews by other readers are mostly positive. I definitively enjoyed ‚ÄúThe Only One Left‚Äù much more than two of my all time eye rollers: ‚ÄúThe House Across the Lake‚Äù and ‚ÄúSurvive the Night.‚Äù Like most Riley Sager books, ‚ÄúThe Only One Left‚Äù starts very strong with a great set up of having a disgraced home health nurse beginning a new job taking care of an invalid, elderly suspected murderer at the home where the killings took place. Kit, the nurse, takes a special interest in her patient, Lenora, after discovering that she can communicate through knocks and by typing on a typewriter with the only part of her body she can move, her hand. For 80 percent of this book I was fully invested as the author did an outstanding job building the plot around several subplots and the solution to the central mystery being revealed a little at the time through Lenora‚Äôs writings. Unfortunately the last 20 percent of this one was an absolute train wreck with the implausibilities stacking up to the point where I was grateful it was over. The coincidences the author has to rely on in order for the book to resolve as well as the absolutely ridiculous actions and reactions by main characters spoiled the whole book for me. Plus, does anyone believe that anyone would continue living on the edge of a cliff as it crumbles and cracks around them‚Ä¶ Um no thanks.\n\nTherefore my review looks like this -1st 80 percent of book: 5+ stars.\n\nThe last 20 percent of book 0 stars\n\nOverall rating: 3.5\n\nSmiles and sense of enjoyment upon completion: ‚òπÔ∏è\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n‚òÖ4 stars\n\n‚úéìÇÉ ‚ÄúAt seventeen, Lenora Hope / Hung her sister with a rope / Stabbed her father with a knife / Took her mother‚Äôs happy life / ‚ÄòIt wasn‚Äôt me,‚Äô Lenora said / But she‚Äôs the only one not dead.‚Äù\n\n‚òÜSummary:\n\nIn 1929, Winston, Evangeline, and Virginia Hope were murdered in their home, a mansion set on the edge of the Cliffs. A murder in which all fingers point to Lenora Hope, the last one standing. Now 1983, after an incident gone wrong, Kitt is being sent to the scene of the crime to become Lenora‚Äôs home health aide. THE Lenora Hope, who can no longer care for herself, walk, or talk. Strange things occur during Kitt‚Äôs time at Hope mansion, from the mysterious disappearance of the previous home health aide, to Lenora‚Äôs desire to tell her true story in the only way she can: one-handed on a typewriter. On top of that, the cliffs appear to become more and more unsteady‚Ä¶\n\n‚òÜMy Thoughts:\n\nOkay first off, common sense lesson:\n\nDon‚Äôt build your house on the edge of a cliff.\n\nNow, that being said, WOW. I came here to cure my CC3 hangover and this delivered!! Riley Sager said ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a twist and twenty more,‚Äù and let me tell you that each had me floored. I probably could have guessed a couple, but the way this book had me on the edge of my seat so immersed in the story, I couldn‚Äôt have even tried to see the twists coming when they did. Nails have been bitten. Jaw is on the floor ü§Øü§Øü§Ø\n\nKitt was a bit meh of a character to me. Lenora on the other hand, was such an enigma. I loved her typed-out story POVs and the way all of her layers reveal themselves to Kitt. Normally, a back-and-forth timeline can be confusing and irritating, but I found myself speed-reading just to get to Lenora‚Äôs POV and learn more of her haunting past üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí®\n\n‚úéìÇÉ ‚ÄúYou want to know if I‚Äôm as evil as everyone says I am. The answer is no. And yes.‚Äù\n\n‚òÜWould I Recommend:\n\nI was not a huge fan of the last Riley Sager I read, The House Across the Lake. So much so that I almost didn‚Äôt pick this one up. I am so glad I eventually did. It flies by rapidly (the ending maybe a little too quickly but still a fun ride), and the creepy gothic mansion had all the vibes üèöÔ∏è If you are even remotely a mystery/thriller lover, I definitely recommend. Sager does not disappoint!!\n\n---------------------\n\nPre-review:\n\nTrying to cure my massive CC3 hangover with a thriller, is it a smart idea IDK!!! But here‚Äôs hoping it works ü§ûüèºü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nJuly 13, 2023\n\nsager's been hit or miss with me, but when he hits, he HITS. i loved this one. enough to bring me back to reviewing? WHAT WILL HAPPEN LET'S FIND OUT!\n\nSeptember 26, 2023\n\nHoly Moly! What a ride! Highly recommend!\n\nI listened to The Only One Left on audiobook. Captivating, mesmerizing, couldn't put it down. The narration by Christine Lakin is outstanding!\n\nKit is a home healthcare provider who was suspended due to the death of one of her patients. When she returns to work, she is given an assignment to care for a woman who has had a stroke and is believed to be the murderer of her parents and sister in 1929.\n\nThe suspense and drama heightens in every chapter compounded with wild twists and turns.\n\nNovember 8, 2023\n\n4.5/5\n\nIlo≈õƒá plottwist√≥w prawie przyprawi≈Ça mnie o zawa≈Ç. TA KSIƒÑ≈ªKA JEST ≈öWIETNA!\n\nNovember 15, 2023\n\nokay, maybe i just give every riley sager book three stars, but this one was truly my favorite out of all the other ones i‚Äôve read! 80‚Äôs setting, mansion on the coast of maine, a family massacre in a small sleepy town, the only survivor (who is also the only suspect) is now an old woman who needs 24/7 care, because her last nurse has left in the night never to be seen again! a lot of good and spooky atmosphere and allure, true? and we follow the newly hired caregiver, who grew up in this town with this haunted house, who is unable to say no for the position because of something very sad in her own life. And with the help of a typewriter, the spooky story of what really happened all of those years ago unfolds!\n\ni honestly had a really good time with this, and my rating is for sure a very high three stars. this book will really keep you on your toes with guessing, and you will hit a point in the story where it is just all out constant reveal after reveal! this is something i did enjoy, but i feel like it was a little too much. kind of like when you‚Äôre on a rollercoaster and the first few dips and loops and plunges feel good, but if there are too many it loses the appeal and the fear, you know? but also take all of this with a grain of salt, because you all know i am not a big mystery thriller reader and reviewer! but i had a really fun time with this one overall, and for sure recommend. also, i really adored the ending of this one and thought it was close to perfect.\n\ntrigger + content warnings (please use caution reading these, because they do give away some major twists and plot reveals): toxic home, loss of a parent in past, talk of cancer, grief depiction, depression depiction, anxiety, thoughts of suicide, suicide attempt, abusive parents, captivity, nightmares, infidelity, overdose, talk of diet, negative body talk, slut shaming, pregnancy surprise, birth, blood, alcholism, drug addiction, bad medical help, brief insinuation of homophobia/homophobic parents in past, death, murder use of ouija board\n\n‚ô° buddy read with Amy!\n\nblog | instagram | youtube | kofi | spotify | amazon\n\n‚ûΩ The Last Time I Lied ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\n‚ûΩ Lock Every Door ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\nJuly 29, 2023\n\nIt‚Äôs best to approach Riley Sager‚Äôs latest release, The Only One Left, knowing as little as possible. To that end, allow me to fill you in‚Ä¶\n\nThis is a gothic whodunit set in 1983, where we meet Kit McDeere, a home-health aide providing live-in assistance to recluse Lenora Hope who‚Äôs confined to a wheelchair and, thanks to a stroke, able to use only her left hand to communicate.\n\nLenora was accused, though never convicted, of murdering her wealthy Maine family decades earlier in a Lizzie Borden-like massacre.\n\nNow the subject of a playground rhyme ‚Äî At 17, Lenora Hope / Hung her sister with a rope / Stabbed her father with a knife / Took her mother‚Äôs happy life / It wasn‚Äôt me, Lenora said / But she‚Äôs the only one not dead ‚Äî Lenora has never spoken publicly about the murders nor has she been seen outside her family home since that night in 1929.\n\nCaregiver Kit hasn‚Äôt worked since being suspended without pay six months earlier for failing to lock up a bottle of fentanyl that led to her last client‚Äôs fatal overdose.\n\nOh, I should also mention that Lenora‚Äôs last nurse up and left without any notice‚Ä¶ in the middle of the night. Eeek.\n\nLike all good gothic thrillers, the story's location is a character itself. The crumbling cliffside mansion, Hope‚Äôs End, teeters on the edge of the Atlantic. Sager provides vivid and haunting descriptions of the seaside home with its cracking walls, steadily tilting floors, shadowy doorways, footsteps at night, and blurry figures in windows.\n\nThe novel moves between Kit‚Äôs first-person narration in the present and Lenora‚Äôs typewritten account of her life leading up to the incident.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for twists, turns, and buried secrets, this story offers them in spades.\n\nMuch like Hope‚Äôs End itself, Sager will have you on the edge right up until the very last page.\n\nJuly 14, 2023\n\nUmmm who is this man?!? This is the Riley Sager that I know from my earlier experiences. After reading his latest releases, I was convinced that I wouldn‚Äôt ever like Riley Sager‚Äôs works again. I talked myself into giving him one last try and HE DID NOT DISAPPOINT!\n\nThe Only One Left is difficult to describe without spoiling intricate parts of the plot. Taking place in 1983, the story follows home health aide Kit who is assigned to work with Lenora Hope. Rumor is that in 1929 Lenora killed not only on her father, but also her mother and sister. Battling demons of her own, Kit is hesitant to work as Lenora‚Äôs aid; however, due to a previous situation she isn‚Äôt left with any other options. What follows is a deep dive into the complicated and haunted past of Lenora Hope as Kit attempts to figure out if she‚Äôs really responsible for the death of her family.\n\nWhat Worked: YOOOOOO! Riley Sager killed it with this one! The pacing, the plot‚Ä¶everything really worked well. While reading this book, I noticed a pattern related to my enjoyment of Riley Sager books. If he mixes gothic/paranormal elements in his books, I‚Äôm more likely to enjoy them (i.e. Lock Every Door & Home Before Dark). This book is a combination of those themes, but also delves into the relationships that can sometimes exist between caretakers and those that need assistance. I didn‚Äôt expect that to be such a major theme to the story, but it comes full circle at the end and really sheds a light on one‚Äôs ability to maintain or lose humanity. The plot twists in this were beyond exceptional. I did not expect to have such a physical and emotional reaction to the revelations. Sager got me with this one and usually it‚Äôs quite difficult to throw me off with thrillers and mysteries. I must say that he keeps this going until the very end of the book! This was clearly a culmination of great writing, plotting, and character development. Quite frankly, he‚Äôs set the bar fairly high with this one and I‚Äôm not sure whether subsequent works will be able to take its place in my personal ranking system.\n\nOverall, this is my favorite Riley Sager book to date. I was convinced that I was going to give up on him, but this one changed my mind. Don‚Äôt ask anyone for any hints or summaries. Go into this one and enjoy the ride!\n\nAugust 17, 2024\n\nNot for me.\n\nIt seems as though so many people loved this, but I found it to be a bit of a slog.\n\nThe first few hours of the audiobook were so. incredibly. boring. I seriously do not care about any of the mundane nonsense (her uniform was too tight in the shoulders but made her stand up straighter) that played no part in the plot.\n\nMaybe more importantly, I couldn't feel any of the terror that our heroine, Kit, felt as she entered the spooky murder house.\n\nWhat the fuck even are you going on about, girl?\n\nAn old lady supposedly killed her family a million years ago. Said old lady now has use of one fucking hand that she uses to type words to you.\n\nWhy is Kit freaking out all of the time? If she were a teenager, maybe. But this is a grown-ass woman. Are you kidding me with this nonsense?\n\nOh no! I'm not sure if I want to know the truth!\n\nWhat? Why not?\n\nIt may be that I'm just more curious than the average bear, but I would be all about hearing what happened on the night of this famous murder from the suspected murderer.\n\nNone of this wiffle-waffling for me, I'd settle right in and snuggle up with a presumed killer for that level of gossip.\n\nYes. Yes, I am.\n\nAnd, not to brag, but that's probably why I'll end up the subject of a Netflix documentary at some point.\n\nThe conclusion to the mystery was over the top, but that honestly didn't bother me too much. It's a thriller, so you know that you are going to (hopefully) go on a bit of a wild ride when you picked the book up.\n\nRicky just kind of popped out of nowhere, didn't he? And then to be related to Kit?\n\nOk. Go with it, man!\n\nVictoria just had some shit luck when it came to the people in her life, I guess. The worst had to be her sister locking her in her room while she squeezed out a baby by herself.\n\nCheese-us on crackers! That's a vagina's nightmare.\n\nAnd what was the point of her father locking them in their rooms as a game? Like, I get that he was a control freak, but that just seemed like an abstract thing to do.\n\nThat Lenora and Ricky, both incredibly selfish people in life, decided to just sit there while the house fell away into the sea instead of trying to escape was pretty out of character for both of them. <--but ok! Dramatic license. I get it.\n\nThe epilogue was kind of insane, though.\n\nAnd not really in a good way.\n\nNo matter how much I wanted Virginia to get a happily ever after, I simply can't respect someone who sits in their bed for years and years pretending to be mute & immobile.\n\nPeople are having to wipe your ass.\n\nBecause you shit on yourself.\n\nAnd then lay in that shit until someone wiped it and changed your diaper.\n\nHOW?\n\nHOW!?\n\nNow, I have zero problems wiping someone's ass. Doesn't make me gag or feel weird or whatever else. If someone needs help, they need help, and you help them. Period.\n\nBut I will be good and goddammed if I sit in my own poo for 20 years as a fucking prank to pay back a bitchy sister.\n\nThat's just weird.\n\nAlright. This has quite a few glowing reviews, so take mine with a grain of salt.\n\nI think the problem is that the story relies too much on atmosphere and that just isn't the kind of book that hits with me.\n\nIt moved too slowly and I couldn't relate to the main character's fears.\n\nRecommended for...someone else.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>\n\nJuly 11, 2023\n\nAfter reading ‚ÄòThe House Across The Lake‚Äô last year (and not much caring for it), I wasn‚Äôt sure if Sager would be able to redeem himself once again with this newest release. Well, he certainly has, because ‚ÄòThe Only One Left‚Äô is a real humdinger! üòâ\n\nIn this story we have Kittredge (Kit) McDeere who becomes a live-in caretaker for the infamous Lenora Hope. Lenora Hope was accused of murdering her parents and sister in 1929. There was never enough evidence to formally charge and convict Lenora, therefore she never went to prison. However, Lenora has lived bedridden for decades due to paralysis from sickness and strokes- never leaving her room at Hope‚Äôs End, the mansion in which she grew up in. It seems as if Lenora has lived like a prisoner for decades. After meeting Kit, Lenora decides it‚Äôs time to tell her story‚Ä¶\n\nLenora is able to type on a typewriter with the only hand she is able to use, her left hand. While the sentences and words come out slow, Lenora sure has a story to tell! Kit McDeere will also stop at nothing to get this story from Lenora!\n\nMy advice to you is to read this book when you don‚Äôt have any plans, because you will want to read this book from start to finish with no interruptions! Trust me, if life and responsibilities didn‚Äôt get in the way, I would have devoured this book in one sitting!\n\nMy favorite book by Riley Sager is ‚ÄòHome Before Dark‚Äô, and this book is definitely a very close runner up (that‚Äôs why I had to drop a few points). Do I recommend this book? Heck yes!!\n\nNovember 3, 2023\n\nThis was really good and pulled me in from the start. It got more insane towards the ending and gave me whiplash from so many twists. ü§™üëèüíú\n\nMore mystery suspense than it is horror, The Only One Left gives a chilling vibe whether from the old crumbling cliff-side mansion on the coast of Maine, its dark secrets, or its little rhyme...\n\nAt seventeen, Lenora Hope\n\nHung her sister with a rope\n\nStabbed her father with a knife\n\nTook her mother‚Äôs happy life\n\n‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me,‚Äù Lenora said\n\nBut she‚Äôs the only one not dead\n\nI love it when dual-timeline stories are equally gripping. The Hope family was introduced in 1929 prior to their deadly demise and in 1983 when Kit, a home health aid was placed to assist a reclusive and paralyzed Lenora Hope."
