        "text": "An occasional series where I write about works inspired by Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula…\n\nThese reviews reveal plot twists.\n\nSetting: England in the 1950s. Judging by its postcode, Mother Riley’s shop is near Crystal Palace in south London.\n\nFaithful to the novel? Old Mother Riley, a middle-aged Irish washerwoman called Daphne Bluebell Snowdrop Riley, was the drag-act persona of comedy star Arthur Lucan. Lucan had developed the character while performing in music hall in Dublin, and was part of a double act with his wife Kitty McShane who played Old Mother Riley’s daughter. The pair’s popularity soon led to tours, radio shows and eventually a low-budget film series starting in 1936. Mother Riley Meets the Vampire, released 16 years later, was the character’s 18th and final film appearance. Plans for a 19th, in the tantalisingly titled Old Mother Riley’s Trip to Mars, were abandoned after Lucan’s death on 17 May 1954. (Lucan’s friend and understudy, Roy Rolland, then assumed the role until retiring in the 1980s though made no movies.) But what does all this have to do with Bram Stoker’s Count Dracula?\n\nBest performance: Well, it’s the casting of Bela Lugosi as a villain called the Vampire – a ploy to make potential viewers assume he would be playing Dracula. Lugosi’s connection with Dracula is cast-iron. He first played the role on the American stage from 1927, then was carried over to the movies when the production was adapted by Universal Pictures in 1931. That film led to a string of sequels and crossover films, but despite what many people think Lugosi was rarely involved. In fact, the only time he returned to his signature role on film was in the 1948 comedy Abbot & Costello Meet Frankenstein.\n\nHe starred in many other horror films, but largely steered clear of Dracula for fear of typecasting (at least in terms of movies: he reprised the Count on stage from 1947). Nevertheless, his 1931 portrayal had been so influential – the dinner suit, the cape, the accent that almost everyone has copied for 90 years – that many believe he played Dracula over and over again. Even the usually unimpeachable writer Bill Bryson, in his history book One Summer, can write about how Lugosi ‘starred in the 1931 movie and a great number of sequels’ and say that ‘professionally he did almost nothing else for 30 years’.\n\nAfter his fun turn with Abbot and Costello, Lugosi – who could be a deadly serious actor, according to some colleagues – again spoofed his undimmable persona by appearing in this tatty British comedy. The joke here is that his character, Von Housen aka The Vampire, only *thinks* he’s a vampire. He claims to be descended from a famous vampire (not Dracula, who’s never mentioned) and sustains his life by drinking blood. His first scene shows him waking up in a coffin while dressed in an evening suit. ‘I trust you rested well, Master,’ says his sidekick Hitchcock, played by Ian Wilson in a way that reminds Drac fans of Dwight Frye’s manic turn as Renfield in the 1931 movie. Von Housen lives in a big spooky house and even has a portrait of a bat hanging on a wall (he claims it’s his brother).\n\nThe truth, however, is not so supernatural. Von Housen in actually perfectly human. He’s an archetypal mad scientist who is kidnapping women and building an army of 50,000 robots. So far, however, he only has one robot – a visual precursor of the mechanoid from 60s TV show Lost in Space. When a mix-up by the Royal Mail delivers a robot to Mother Riley’s south London shop, Von Housen must kidnap her in order to… Well, it’s not entirely clear why, to be honest, but it’s an excuse to bring the two characters together for some very mild and extremely boring hijinks.\n\nBest bit: Although not a fully-fledged musical, the film contains an early song performed in the shop – judging by the appalling sound quality, the vocals were recorded live on set.\n\nReview: Old Mother Riley can’t have been to everyone’s tastes first time round, despite the success of the film series, and she’s certainly difficult to like now. A chaotic collection of shrieking, shouting, slapstick and scrambled language (‘disgusterating!’), she fails to raise a single laugh in the whole film. Lugosi is game enough and seems to be enjoying the chance to poke fun at himself, but this is mostly a forgettable experience full of tired and lazy comedy. Some fun can be had, however, from spotting the talent in the supporting roles. Cropping up in small roles are recognisable British actors such as Hattie Jacques, Dora Bryan, Dandy Nicholls, an uncredited John Le Mesurier and Joan Benham. The latter also provides us with a neat connection. Around 20 years after this film, Benham began making semi-regular appearances in the classy ITV drama Upstairs, Downstairs. One of her co-stars, playing the family solicitor Sir Geoffrey Dillon, was Raymond Huntley who had been Dracula on the London stage in the 1920s before the production moved to America. Not wanting to tour the States, Huntley was replaced in the cast by Bela Lugosi.\n\nFour special deliveries (which is why you put it through the window instead of the letter box) out of 10"
