The lot is offered with an estimate of £18,000 – 22,000.”\n\nThe lot also includes a copy of The Times newspaper where the sale appeared on the front page, the original auction catalogue and The Beano No.2000, with its back page reprint of the first Beano’s front cover.\n\nBut this rarity is, of course, not the only treasure on offer.\n\nThe Beano Nos. 3, 6 and 9 are also in the auction, along with a strong collection of KG Murray Australian reprints, including Batman No 1, 12 further early issues, Super Adventure No 1, and Superboy and Superman early issues, too.\n\nThe Woodard Archive continues to offer British gems from the 1950s-60s, with bound volumes of Tiger and Buster, and scarce complete early years of Cherie, Diana, Hurricane, Bunty and 1970s Countdown, Emma, Fantastic, Terrific and Thunder, most of the above with their free gifts.\n\nBuster (1960) 1-32 (to Dec 31 1960) in bound volume. As you can see from the slideshow, the early issues star Buster as “Son of Andy Capp”, a description that Andy Capp creator Reg Smythe was not happy about, Buster then owned by the same company publishing the Daily Mirror. Also featuring Phantom Force 5, The Terrors of Tornado Street, Sea Hawk and Milkiway the Man from Mars. From the Woodard Archive of British Comics\n\nArt on offer includes The Broons original Jig-Saw box design from 1943 by Dudley Watkins, and the key Treasure Island board from Topper No. 7, also drawn and signed by Watkins, showing Flint’s treasure map.\n\nThere’s also a “Dan Dare” / Eagle cover by Frank Bellamy, another by Harold Johns and Greta Tomlinson, further “Charley’s War” pages by Joe Colquhoun, from Battle, The Beano’s “Shipwrecked Circus” strips by Paddy Brennan, plus “Happy Family”, “Old Mother Riley” and “Terry-Thomas” strips, all from The Bob Monkhouse Archive.\n\nAnd… who could be without a double-page artwork of “The Bash Street Kids” by the late David Sutherland?\n\nThe US Golden Age section is led by Batman #97, Durango Kid #1, Horrors #12, Superman #20, Wonder Woman #36 and World’s Finest #26, with a strong Canadian ‘whites’ selection, including Freelance, Robin Hood, Grand Slam and Three Aces, all by Double ‘A’ publishers with Circus Parade Comics No. 1.\n\nThe Silver Age excels with a copy of Marvel’s Amazing Fantasy #15, featuring the first appearance of The Amazing Spider-Man, The Avengers #4, Silver Surfer #4, Strange Tales #107, Tales of Suspense #39, Tales To Astonish #41 & 44, Thor #225 and X-Men #1.\n\nMore keys than The Bash Street Kids can throw a stick at!\n\nThis auction closes Sunday September 1st 2024.\n\n• Click here to visit this latest ComPalComics Auction (and register to bid) in thesaleroom.com | You can also browse auction lots and print a fax or mail bidding form at the Compalcomics website\n\nPostal bids need to be with Compal by Friday 30th August 2024 and the team will enter them on your behalf in thesaleroom.com/Comic Book Auctions website closing on Sunday 25 February from 2.00 pm.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe founder of downthetubes, which he established in 1998.
