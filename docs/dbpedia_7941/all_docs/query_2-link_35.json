        "text": "Lisa Marie Presley was known by many for being Elvis Presley's daughter, but she was also mom to four kids of her own: Riley Keough, Benjamin Keough, Finley Lockwood and Harper Lockwood.\n\nThe singer, who died on Jan. 12 at the age of 54 after she was hospitalized for a possible cardiac arrest, described herself as \"ferociously protective\" of her kids. \"I just smother them in love,\" she shared while speaking to Healthy Living in 2014. \"They are my priority. That's what I do. That's what I care most about. I keep them close to me and make sure they are happy and healthy.\"\n\nLisa Marie welcomed daughter Riley and son Benjamin with her ex-husband Danny Keough, whom she was married to from 1988 to 1994. In 2008, she welcomed twin daughters Finley and Harper with then-husband Michael Lockwood, though the two divorced in 2016.\n\nIn July 2020, Benjamin died by suicide and Lisa Marie was \"beyond devastated\" by the death of her son. She was open about her grief in the years after, posting tributes on Benjamin's birthday and penning an emotional essay for PEOPLE in 2022 about the loss.\n\nFor more on Lisa Marie Presley, listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.\n\n\"It's a real choice to keep going, one that I have to make every single day and one that is constantly challenging to say the least ... But I keep going for my girls,\" she wrote in honor of National Grief Awareness Day.\n\nIn January 2023, Lisa Marie collapsed at her home in Calabasas, California. Shortly after she was transported to a hospital, her mother, Priscilla Presley, confirmed the news of her daughter's death in a statement to PEOPLE.\n\nLisa Marie was laid to rest at Graceland next to her son, Benjamin. Her memorial service took place on the front lawn of the iconic estate on Jan. 22, 2023. She left her trust, which includes Elvis' Graceland property, to her three daughters, with Riley later being named the sole trustee of Lisa Marie's estate.\n\nThe following year, Riley announced that she had been preparing Lisa Marie's autobiography, which will be published in October 2024. Riley also announced that she would narrate the audiobook version of her late mother's memoir.\n\nHere is everything to know about Lisa Marie Presley's four children.\n\nRiley Keough, 35\n\nLisa Marie and her then-husband Danny welcomed their first child, daughter Danielle Riley Keough, on May 29, 1989. Riley has been open about how her mother and grandmother allowed her to grow up to be her own person, instead of living in the shadow of her famous grandfather. In September 2007, Riley explained to Oprah Winfrey that, while she knew who her grandfather was as a child, it wasn't \"this huge thing.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean that Elvis hasn't been a big figure in Riley's life. When Riley attended the premiere of her film Mad Max: Fury Road alongside her mother and grandmother, the trio were described as \"the Presley women.\"\n\nRiley began modeling in 2004, and in May 2022, she made her directorial debut with her first film, War Pony, at the Cannes Film Festival. Riley was happy to be at the festival with her co-director Gina Gammell, saying, \"We're really just grateful to be here. This was a collaboration between all of us, and this is all of our film.\"\n\nIn 2015, Riley married Australian stuntman Ben Smith-Petersen. The couple were first linked in January 2014 and reportedly met on the set of Mad Max: Fury Road. The two share a daughter named Tupelo Storm Smith-Petersen, who was named after Mississippi city Elvis was born in and Riley's late brother.\n\nRiley's husband spoke on her behalf at Lisa Marie's Graceland memorial service. The speech was filled with sweet memories from Riley's childhood. It also revealed that she and Smith-Petersen had welcomed a baby girl.\n\n\"I'm eternally grateful to have spent 33 years with you. I'm certain I chose the best mother for me in this world ... I remember everything,\" Smith-Petersen read. \"I remember all the notes you'd leave in my lunchbox every day. I remember the feeling I'd get when I'd see you picking me up from school ... I remember how it felt to be loved by the most loving mother I've ever known.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Thank you for showing me love is the only thing that matters in this life. I hope I can love my daughter the way you loved me, the way you loved my brother and my sisters.\"\n\nTwo days after laying her mom to rest, Riley shared a photo from the last time she saw Lisa Marie. The image showed the mother and daughter sitting side by side in a booth at Formosa Café in West Hollywood. They were celebrating Elvis' birthday.\n\n\"I feel blessed to have a photo of the last time I saw my beautiful mama,\" Riley captioned the photo.\n\nWhen her mother died, the legal battle between her and her grandmother, Priscilla, over who was entitled to Lisa Marie's estate carried on for months. Attorneys for Priscilla filed a petition questioning the \"authenticity and validity\" of Lisa Marie's will in January 2023, but two months later, Priscilla and Riley reached a settlement, with both sides reportedly \"happy\" with the outcome.\n\nIn May 2024, a company called Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC claimed that Lisa Marie borrowed $3.8 million before her death, using the Graceland property as collateral. The company planned to publicly auction off the estate, but the sale was halted after Riley filed a lawsuit that accused Naussany of forging her late mother's signature on the loan documents.\n\n“There is no foreclosure sale. Simply put, the counter lawsuit has been filed is to stop the fraud,” Elvis Presley Enterprises said in a statement to PEOPLE.\n\nBenjamin Keough\n\nLisa Marie and Danny's second child, Benjamin Storm Presley Keough, was born on Oct. 21, 1992. As he grew up, fans were quick to notice how closely he resembled his grandfather, Elvis.\n\nAt the age of 27, however, Benjamin died by suicide in Calabasas, California. Following the news of his death in July 2020, a rep for Lisa Marie told PEOPLE, \"She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter Riley, She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.\"\n\nBenjamin's friend, Brandon Howard, spoke to PEOPLE about Benjamin's struggle with mental health and the \"pressure\" to live up to the Presley name. \"Sometimes he struggled with depression, which is a serious thing with [the COVID-19 pandemic] and everything happening right now and everybody being locked in the house,\" he said. \"It's a tough thing when you have a lot of pressure with your family and living up to a name and an image. It's a lot of pressure. It's almost like you're pressured into having to be a musician, having to be an actor. It was good for him to go around the world and discover himself and have his own friends.\"\n\nHoward also remembered Benjamin as the person who would help others even when he was facing his own battle. \"He has always been there for everybody,\" he added. \"In any kind of situation, he would be the one who would come crash with you on the couch for weeks until you're actually feeling better.\"\n\nIn October 2020, Benjamin was buried at Graceland, his grandfather's home in Memphis, Tennessee. He was the first person to be buried at the home since the death of his great-grandmother in 1980. \"Benjamin Storm Presley Keough was laid to rest in the Meditation Garden at Graceland with his family including his grandfather, Elvis Presley, great-grandmother, Gladys Presley, great-grandfather, Vernon Presley and great-great-grandmother, Minnie Mae Presley,\" Graceland shared on Facebook.\n\nLisa Marie opened up about the loss on what would have been Benjamin's 28th birthday in 2020. \"My beautiful beautiful angel, I worshipped the ground you walked on, on this earth and now in Heaven,\" she wrote alongside a photo from his 27th birthday. \"My heart and soul went with you. The depth of the pain is suffocating and bottomless without you every moment of every day.\"\n\nLess than a week before Lisa Marie died in 2023, she and friend David Kessler — a grief expert whom she befriended following Benjamin's death in 2020 — visited the Meditation Garden at Graceland where her father and Benjamin are buried.\n\n\"We sat there mostly in silence by Ben's grave. She showed me where she'd be buried someday, right across from her father's grave,\" Kessler recalled to PEOPLE. \"I said, 'Not for a long time,' and she was like, 'Nope, I got a lot to do still.' She was very excited about what was coming up. She had such a challenging first and second act of life, and she was about to take on this third act that was so much about helping people.\"\n\nHarper and Finley Lockwood, 15\n\nIn 2008, Lisa Marie announced that she and her then-husband Lockwood were expecting a baby. The pair later announced that they were in fact expecting twins. Daughters Finley Aaron Love and Harper Vivienne Anne were born on Oct. 7, 2008.\n\nLisa Marie's mother, Priscilla Presley, was present for Finley Harper's births. Priscilla said that she saw each baby take their first breaths and that she was \"very thrilled\" about becoming a grandmother again. Shortly after, Priscilla spoke to Entertainment Tonight about how Lisa Marie and Lockwood were doing. \"Mother is doing great,\" she said. \"Father's a little nervous. He's a first-time dad, so it is the most beautiful thing to watch the way he holds and carries the babies. It's so endearing to watch how delicate he is with the babies.\"\n\nAfter 10 years of marriage, Lisa Marie filed for divorce from Lockwood in June 2016. The two were soon engaged in a tough custody battle, and the twins were placed in protective custody after Lisa Marie's legal team alleged that \"disturbing\" photos of children were found on a computer belonging to Lockwood. The twins lived with their grandmother following the allegations. \"There is Lots of confusion, commotion and concern from all the talk circulating,\" Priscilla shared on Facebook. \"Let me put this to rest … the girls have not been in foster care and never will be. The girls have been with me and will be until all this is sorted out.\"\n\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation closed its inquiry into the allegations in 2017, with T.B.I. Public Information Officer Josh DeVine telling PEOPLE, \"Barring any new potential evidence or information, we have concluded our involvement in this matter. We have not been able to determine if a crime occurred in Tennessee and accordingly do not have an open investigation.\" The office also made it clear that a formal investigation was never opened, only an inquiry to \"determine if [it] could substantiate information with which to open a case.\"\n\nIn October 2017, Lisa Marie stepped out with all three of her daughters at an ELLE Women in Hollywood event. This was the first time Lisa Marie had attended a public event with all three girls.\n\nAnd at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, Lisa Marie and the twins began fostering rescue puppies. Lisa Marie shared the news on Instagram when she posted a photo of the twins and herself holding one of the dogs. \"We've been fostering pups from a shelter,\" she wrote. \"Exhausting but so rewarding 👍🐶 be well❤️.\"\n\nAfter Lisa Marie's death, Lockwood said that their twins would \"carry on the family legacy\" in a statement to PEOPLE.\n\n\"The most important thing to me at this time is to take care of my daughters, making sure they always feel safe and loved,\" he said. \"Both of them have incredible spirit and they will carry our family's legacy on for the rest of their lives.\""
