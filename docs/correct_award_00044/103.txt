Whipple conducted his research on dogs and concluded in 1920 that liver in the diet cured pernicious anemia and increased the reticulocyte count. With Whipple's work as background, Murphy and Minot studied patients with pernicious anemia and found in 1926 that a diet rich in liver could control the disease in humans. The Nobel Prize was given to the 3 scientists for their discoveries concerning liver therapy for anemias.

The son of a minister, Murphy was born on February 6, 1892, in Stoughton, Wis (about 15 miles south of Madison). He attended the local public schools and then enrolled at the University of Oregon in Eugene, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1914. From...
