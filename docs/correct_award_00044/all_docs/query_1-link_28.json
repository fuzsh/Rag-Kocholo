        "text": "(1885–1950). American physician George Richards Minot received (with George H. Whipple and William P. Murphy) the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1934. Minot and Murphy introduced a raw-liver diet in the treatment of pernicious anemia, a previously fatal disease that impairs the production of red blood cells because of the body’s inability to absorb vitamin B12.\n\nMinot was born on December 2, 1885, in Boston, Massachusetts. He received his medical degree at Harvard University in 1912. Minot did research at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston (1915–23), the Collis P. Huntington Memorial Hospital at Harvard University (1922–28), and the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston (1923–28). He served as director of the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory at Boston City Hospital from 1928 until his death. Minot was diagnosed with diabetes in 1921 and began using insulin in 1923, shortly after it became available for humans; the treatment is considered to have saved his life."
