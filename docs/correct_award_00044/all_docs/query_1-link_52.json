        "text": "The mission of the Hematology Division of Brigham and Women’s Hospital is to provide advanced clinical care, teaching, and research in hematology. The division has a rich history of contributions to hematology that dates back to 1934, when Drs. William P. Murphy and George R. Minot received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their investigations of liver therapy that led to the first treatment for pernicious anemia.\n\nUnder the leadership of Dr. Nancy Berliner, the Hematology Division has continued to flourish by offering world-class clinical care to its patients and continuing to make significant contributions to scientific and clinical research in hematology.\n\nWith more than 20 clinical hematology specialists, nurse practitioners and social workers, we provide comprehensive, personalized care to our patients. Among the conditions we see in our clinic are anemia, hemophilia, sickle cell disease, thrombosis and von Willebrand disease.\n\nOur scientific and clinical research faculty and coordinators combine their energies to find “bench to bedside” solutions to improve the care and treatment of patients with hematologic disorders. Ongoing scientific investigations include:\n\nthe role of bone marrow cells in promoting tumor growth\n\nanemia in the elderly\n\nplatelet development\n\nmyelodysplastic and myeloproliferative syndromes\n\nanemia in HIV patients\n\ntreatment of sickle cell disease\n\nhematophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\n\nother blood diseases, particularly those that affect women, the elderly and minorities\n\nWorking together, the physicians and scientists in the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Hematology Division continue the legacy of making clinical and scientific contributions to improve the care of individuals with hematological conditions."
