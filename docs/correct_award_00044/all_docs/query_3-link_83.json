        "text": "Determining the precise identity or origin of fragmentary fossils can be difficult. Here, mitochondrial DNA sequences are used to confirm that the skeleton of a child recovered in Uzbekistan in the 1930s was of Neanderthal origin and that remains from the Altai region of Siberia, much further east, are also Neanderthal, extending the Neanderthal range 2,000 km further east than previously assumed.\n\nUsing DNA from a finger bone, the genome of an archaic hominin from southern Siberia has been sequenced to about 1.9-fold coverage. The group to which this individual belonged shares a common origin with Neanderthals, and although it was not involved in the putative gene flow from Neanderthals into Eurasians, it contributed 4–6% of its genetic material to the genomes of present-day Melanesians. A tooth whose mitochondrial genome is very similar to that of the finger bone further suggests that these hominins are evolutionarily distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans.\n\nAncient mitochondrial DNA from a hominin individual who lived in the mountains of Central Asia between 48,000–30,000 years ago has been sequenced. Comparative genomics suggest that this mitochondrial DNA derives from an out-of-Africa migration distinct from the ones that gave rise to Neanderthals and modern humans. It also seems that this hominin lived in close spatio-temporal proximity to Neanderthals and modern humans.\n\nSequencing of the bonobo genome shows that more than three per cent of the human genome is more closely related to either the bonobo genome or the chimpanzee genome than those genomes are to each other.\n\nThe high-quality genome sequence of a 45,000-year-old modern human from Siberia reveals that gene flow from Neanderthals into the ancestors of this individual had already occurred about 7,000 to 13,000 years earlier; genomic comparisons show that he belonged to a population that lived close in time to the separation of populations in east and west Eurasia and that may represent an early modern human radiation out of Africa that has no direct descendants today.\n\nIn the modern human genome, elevated Neanderthal ancestry is found at genes affecting keratin filaments, suggesting that gene flow with Neanderthals helped modern humans to adapt to non-African environments; deficiencies of Neanderthal ancestry are also found, particularly on the X chromosome and in genes expressed highly in testes, suggesting that some Neanderthal mutations were not tolerated on a modern human genetic background as they reduced male fertility.\n\nA complete genome sequence is presented of a female Neanderthal from Siberia, providing information about interbreeding between close relatives and uncovering gene flow events among Neanderthals, Denisovans and early modern humans, as well as establishing substitutions that became fixed in modern humans after their separation from the ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans.\n\nAnalysis of DNA from a 37,000–42,000-year-old modern human from Romania reveals that 6–9% of the genome is derived from Neanderthals, with the individual having a Neanderthal ancestor as recently as four to six generations back.\n\nAnalysis of ancient genomic data of 51 humans from Eurasia dating from 45,000 to 7,000 years ago provides insight into the population history of pre-Neolithic Europe and support for recurring migration and population turnover in Europe during this period.\n\nNuclear DNA sequences from Middle Pleistocene Sima de los Huesos hominins show they were more closely related to Neanderthals than to Denisovans, and indicate a population divergence between Neanderthals and Denisovans that predates 430,000 years ago.\n\nIt is known that there was gene flow from Neanderthals to modern humans around 50,000 years ago; now, analysis of a Neanderthal genome from the Altai Mountains in Siberia reveals evidence of gene flow 100,000 years ago in the other direction—from early modern humans to Neanderthals.\n\nPopulations from North-eastern Europe, in particular those speaking Uralic languages, carry additional ancestry in similarity with modern East Asian populations. Here, the authors analyse ancient genomic data from 11 individuals from Finland and Northwest Russia, and identify genomic signals of migrations from Siberia that began at least 3500 years ago.\n\nGenetic similarity among late Neanderthals is predicted well by their geographical location, and although some of these Neanderthals were contemporaneous with early modern humans, their genomes show no evidence of recent gene flow from modern humans.\n\nGenome-wide data for the three oldest known modern human remains in Europe, dated to around 45,000 years ago, shed light on early human migrations in Europe and suggest that mixing with Neanderthals was more common than is often assumed.\n\nModern human genomes contain Neanderthal sequences, but it is unclear whether these were selected. Here, Khrameeva et al.show that Neanderthal sequences associated with lipid catabolism are three times more frequent in Europe, suggesting that these sequences might have been beneficial to Europeans.\n\nA risk haplotype for type 2 diabetes is identified with four amino acid substitutions in SLC16A11, which is present at ∼50% frequency in Native American samples and ∼10% in east Asian samples, but is rare in European and African samples; SLC16A11 may alter hepatic lipid metabolism, causing an increase in triacylglycerol levels.\n\nRisk of severe COVID-19 is conferred by a genomic segment that is inherited from Neanderthals and is carried by around 50% and 16% of people in south Asia and Europe, respectively.\n\nOur evolutionary history has resulted in highly complex and sophisticated human physiology. Yet evolutionary footprints have also left us prone to diseases. In this Review, the authors discuss how events from the earliest history of life on Earth through to modern human evolution influence many disease traits and outcomes. They describe how an understanding and application of evolutionary frameworks can inform precision medicine initiatives.\n\nA Review describes the three key phases that define the origins of modern human ancestry, and highlights the importance of analysing both palaeoanthropological and genomic records to further improve our understanding of our evolutionary history.\n\nThis Primer outlines the best ways to find, handle and analyse ancient DNA from various sources. The authors summarize ethical considerations and the importance of working closely with all stakeholders, including archaeologists, curators and descendant communities.\n\nHere the authors describe an updated protocol for single-stranded sequencing library preparation suitable for highly degraded DNA from ancient remains or other sources. The procedure can be performed manually or in an automated fashion.\n\nWith the increasing availability of ancient genomes from the same region or locality, the field of human history has started to address sociocultural aspects of human behaviour. The authors review recent case studies reconstructing the social consequences of past human migrations and advocate that this complex enterprise should be addressed by multidisciplinary teams.\n\nThis article reviews recent advances in ancient pathogen genomics, from methodological improvements in retrieving whole genomes to evolutionary analyses of ancient pathogens that remain relevant to public health. Focusing on the evolutionary history of the plague pathogen Yersinia pestis, the authors present unique insights afforded by the study of ancient pathogen genomes.\n\nAncient genomes can inform our understanding of the history of human adaptation through the direct tracking of changes in genetic variant frequency across different geographical locations and time periods. The authors review recent ancient DNA analyses of human, archaic hominin, pathogen, and domesticated animal and plant genomes, as well as the insights gained regarding past human evolution and behaviour.\n\nSequencing genomes of ancient specimens, including human ancestors, can provide rich insights into evolutionary histories. However, ancient DNA samples are frequently degraded, damaged and contaminated with ancient and modern DNA from various sources. This Review describes the methodological and bioinformatic advances that allow these challenges to be overcome in order to process and sequence ancient samples for genome reconstruction, as well as recent progress in characterizing ancient epigenomes.\n\nThe analysis of whole-genome sequence data from both modern and ancient humans has provided evidence for archaic adaptive introgression. Here, the authors provide an overview of the statistical methods used and the supporting evidence for reported examples of archaic introgression, which may have driven the acquisition of beneficial variants that enabled adaptation and survival in new environments.\n\nThere continues to be active debate about the timings, locations and details of various events in human population history. This Review describes how whole-genome sequencing of modern and ancient humans has complemented more traditional methods to provide valuable historical insights.\n\nNext-generation sequencing has now been used to produce the first ancient hominin genome sequences and is also being used to sequence modern humans from many different populations. Together with SNP genotyping, these data are transforming views of human history.\n\nIf most evolutionary changes affect the regulation rather than the structure of proteins, then studying the evolution of gene expression levels will help us to understand phenotypic changes. How can this approach identify the defining differences between humans and chimpanzees?\n\nUse of origins research for political point-scoring is depressingly frequent, but scientists must take what care they can to ensure that their work is not abused.\n\nIn Africa, there is a disparity in ethics and permission requirements for molecular research on samples from living people versus ancient DNA. At the precipice of the archaeogenomics revolution, heritage agencies require updated policies and procedures for genetic and genomic research on African ancient DNA."
