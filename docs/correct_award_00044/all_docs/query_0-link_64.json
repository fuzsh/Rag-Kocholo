        "text": "This used to be an uncommon occurrence, but high prices and heavy publicity have been drawing more Nobel prize medals to market. Here's an article about the latest. -Editor\n\nThe Nobel Prize medal awarded to George Minot in 1934 for his pioneering work on the treatment of pernicious anaemia is to be sold at Bonhams History of Science and Technology Sale in New York on September 21. It is estimated at $200,000-300,000.\n\nMinot (1885 – 1950) and his fellow scientists William. P. Murphy and George. H. Whipple won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for their work in the study of anaemia. Minot and Whipple discovered that pernicious anaemia could be treated effectively with liver which is rich in vitamin B12. Further work confirmed B12 as a vital compound in the development of the treatment.\n\nMinot came from a medical family. His father was a physician and one of his great-grandfathers, James Jackson, co-founded Massachusetts General Hospital. His home in Brookline, Massachusetts is designated a National Historic Landmark.\n\nBonhams Director of the History of Science, Cassandra Hatton, said: “Nobel Prize awards represent the summit of human endeavour and it always creates great excitement among collectors when a medal comes up for sale. George Minot’s work has saved and improved countless lives over many decades. It is interesting to note that Minot himself suffered from diabetes and had it not been for the discovery of insulin by earlier Nobel Prize winners in the 1920s he would almost certainly not have lived to make his own important contribution to the lives of others.”\n\nThe medal is being sold with the Nobel Diploma and other related materials.\n\nTo read the complete article, see:\n\nNobel Prize medal of the man who cured anaemia to be sold at Bonhams (http://artdaily.com/news/79743/Nobel-Prize-medal-of-the-man-who-cured-anaemia-to-be-sold-at-Bonhams#.VaGRSfm6dhE)\n\nWayne Homren, Editor\n\nNBS (coinbooks.org) Web\n\nThe Numismatic Bibliomania Society is a non-profit organization promoting numismatic literature.
