        "text": "Minot, George (1885â€“1950), U.S. physician who developed a cure for the once-fatal blood disease called pernicious anemia. He found that feeding patients a diet consisting largely of raw liver normalized their red blood count. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine (1934, with G.H. Whipple and W.P. Murphy). Minot wrote numerous articles on blood disorders and dietary deficiency.\n\nSee also: Anemia."
