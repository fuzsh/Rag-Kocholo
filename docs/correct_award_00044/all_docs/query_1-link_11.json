        "text": "Two decades of devotion to a single goal were rewarded yesterday when it was announced that Dr. George R. Minot '08, Professor of Medicine in the Harvard Medical School and Director of the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory, who for over 20 years has been studying blood disorders in human beings, will share in the Nobel Prize for medicine.\n\nDr. Minot was the first man to try liver as a cure for pernicious anemia. His researches began in 1918, but it was not until 1925 that he discovered the value of liver in treatment of the deadly disease. At this time he appointed Dr. William P. Murphy '20, Instructor in Medicine at the Harvard Medical School as his assistant. Dr. Murphy had been carrying on similar studies as to the treatment of the same disease. Three year's later, the two men were able to announce to the world that pernicious anemia had at last been conquered by the use of liver.\n\nDr. George H. Whipple of Rochester, N. Y., will also share in the award, as may Dr. Murphy, who assisted Dr. Minot, although it is rare to have the $50,000 reward split more than two ways. Dr. Whipple was experimenting with anemia in animals at the same time Dr. Minot was pioneering with anemia among human beings."
