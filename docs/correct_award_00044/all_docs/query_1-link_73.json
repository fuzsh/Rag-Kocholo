        "text": "George Minot was an American physician best known for winning a Nobel Prize for his work on pernicious anemia. Born into a family of physicians, George was born a weak baby and suffered from frequent fevers as a child. Following his high school graduation, he enrolled at Harvard Medical School and earned an M.D. degree. George was best known for his work on blood disorders, such as anemia, and leukemia among others. He and two of his colleagues worked for years on pernicious anemia, which was considered a fatal disease at that time. George and his fellow doctors came up with a method to treat the ailment through the liver. For this achievement, they were awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology. George further published many medical papers and also worked as the editor of multiple medical journals. In addition, he also served as a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School. George suffered from diabetes, which was a dangerous disease in the first half of the 20th century. He passed away from complications from diabetes at the age of 64."
