        "text": "Thomas Morgan received the Nobel Prize in 1933 for his discoveries involving chromosomes and heredity [1]. Morgan was the first to propose that genes are linear despite the conclusion made by Castle that they were not (Morgan et al., 1920). Using Drosophila as his model organism, Morgan was also able to determine that some genes were sex-linked and were limited to the sex chromosomes (Morgan, 1910). Morgan’s work on genetics using Drosophila provided the ground work for Hermann Joseph Muller’s 1946 Nobel Prize for his discovery that x-ray irradiation can produce mutations [1]. At the time that Morgan and Muller were performing their genetics research, Barbara McClintock was also investigating genetics and heredity using corn as her model. Through studying the pigmentation of corn kernels, McClintock was able to discover mobile genetic elements for which she did not win the Nobel Prize until 1983 [1].\n\nIn 1929, Sir Alexander Fleming noticed that a contaminating Penicillium mold was inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus colonies and was causing them to undergo lysis (Fleming, 1929). From this “by chance” observation, he had discovered penicillin, one of the most effective antibiotics. For this discovery, he received the Nobel Prize in 1945 along with Ernst Boris Chain and Sir Howard Walter Florey [1]. The discovery of penicillin had dramatic effects worldwide as it was able to treat a wide range of bacterial infections by inhibiting bacterial cell wall formation. Fleming’s work played a role in Selman Waksman’s discovery of streptomycin, which won him the Nobel Prize in 1952 [1].\n\nThe 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for their discovery of the molecular structure of DNA (the double helix) [1]. During the 1950s, the race was on to determine the structure of DNA and prominent scientists, including Linus Pauling, were actively searching for it. X-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin successfully produced images of DNA that clearly showed a helical pattern but without her permission, Watson and Crick used these images to propose the double helix structure in their 1953 paper “Molecular structure of nucleic acids: a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid”. While we know now that Watson and Crick were correct, one of the most important parts of their paper comes in one of the last sentences in which they suggest that this structure may play a role in the copying of genetic information, which we also now know to be true.\n\nThe concept of the DNA double helix seems so basic to us today, but 60 years ago it was completely unknown. Another concept of biology that seems elementary to us, the organelles of the cell, was also not completely nailed down until recently. In 1974, George Palade received the Nobel Prize for discoveries regarding the structure and organization of the cell [1]. More notably, Palade discovered the ribosome; he noticed a “small granule” that was present in multiple cell types that seemed to concentrate around the endoplasmic reticulum, while a small minority could be found floating freely around the cell (Palade, 1955). Because of Palade’s discovery, we now understand the process of protein synthesis via translation within the cytoplasm of the cell.\n\nIn the 1980s, two very important Nobel Prizes were awarded in the fields of cholesterol metabolism and neuroembryology. In 1985, Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein won the Prize for their discoveries involving cholesterol metabolism. Through studying a man with familial hypercholesterolemia, they were able to determine the mechanism of LDL binding in cells, the importance of coated pits on the cell surface, and how FH forms as a result of failure of the cells to uptake LDL (Anderson, Goldstein, & Brown, 1977). The following year, Rita Levi-Montalcini won the Prize for her discovery of growth factors. Using chicken embryos as her model organism, she exposed the embryos to mouse sarcomas and snake venom and noticed a dramatic increase in sensory ganglia growth (Levi-Montalcini & Cohen, 1956). From her experiments, she was able to determine that an agent secreted from the sarcomas and snake venom was causing the increase in nerve cell growth and today, this knowledge has been applied to cancer research."
