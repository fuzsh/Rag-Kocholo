        "text": "Career\n\nMinot's initial appointment was as an assistant resident physician at the hospital, but in the fall of 1914, he transferred to the physiology laboratory of William H. Howell to work on problems of blood coagulation. Minot returned to Boston early in 1915. Upon his return, Minot resumed his research in blood disorders as an assistant in medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital (1915-1918). His office was adjacent to that of the hospital pathologist, J. Homer Wright, who had discovered in the bone marrow the site of origin of the dust-sized particles of the blood, the platelets. Minot began work with Roger I. Lee, chief of the West Medical Service at the hospital. In 1917 Minot began working at the Collis P. Huntington Memorial Hospital in Boston, operated by the Cancer Commission of Harvard University, and over the next few years he transferred his research there completely; in 1923, he was appointed chief of its medical service. At Huntington, Minot became increasingly involved in the study of patients with leukemia or cancer. He published authoritative studies of chronic leukemias, their clinical course and response to X-ray therapy, and the biological effects of X rays upon blood-cell production. During these years, he was also engaged in the private practice of medicine, and in 1921, in association with Edwin A. Locke and others, he established a group practice, one of the earliest such ventures.\n\nAt about 1922, Minot began the study that led to his most important achievement, a cure for pernicious anemia. He had long been interested in the problem and now began urging his private patients with anemia to include more milk and meat and some liver in their diets. The immediate stimulus for this suggestion came from the work of George Hoyt Whipple, pathologist and dean at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, who with his principal research associate, Dr. Frieda Robscheit-Robbins, had conducted experiments on dogs rendered anemic by repeated bleeding. They studied the effect of dietary supplements such as liver, pork muscle, or spinach on the regeneration of blood hemoglobin and by 1923 concluded that the liver was by far the most potent. This evidence of the value of dietary supplementation, although based on a quite different type of experimental anemia, harmonized with Minot's long-standing clinical suspicion, gained from the taking of dietary histories, that patients with pernicious anemia often had lived for many years on diets deficient in animal protein. Encouraged by signs of some improvement in a few patients who had followed his suggestions, and especially by the considerable gain in one who greatly enjoyed eating liver, Minot invited one of his assistants in the group practice, William Parry Murphy, to join him in an all-out effort to test the possible benefits of a special diet containing as much as half a pound of liver a day. In 1926, they were able to report to the annual meeting of the Association of American Physicians that all of forty-five patients, many of them treated in Boston hospitals, \"became much better rather rapidly soon after commencing the diet. \" The following year, a collaboration with Edwin J. Cohn, professor of physical chemistry at Harvard, led to the development of an effective liver extract for oral use, which by 1928 was being produced on a commercial scale by the pharmaceutical firm of Eli Lilly and Company. In their early demonstration of the efficacy of liver feeding, as well as in the subsequently required testing of liver extracts on patients with pernicious anemia, Minot and his associates found that a systematic increase of reticulocytes in the blood within ten days was a reliable index of activity. Later research has found that it was chiefly the iron in the liver that benefited Whipple's dogs, and its vitamin B12 content that abolished the anemia in the patients of Minot and Murphy. Nevertheless, these pioneer empirical observations and the subsequent development by others of effective injectable liver extracts replaced eventually by vitamin B12 injections, saved the lives of countless prospective victims of pernicious anemia.\n\nIn 1928, Minot resigned from the Huntington Hospital to become director of the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory and chief of the Fourth (Harvard) Medical Service at the Boston City Hospital, succeeding his friend and colleague Francis W. Peabody. In that laboratory and its special ward, Minot had an enhanced opportunity for carrying on teaching and research. The Thorndike (opened in 1923) was the first clinical research facility of its kind to be established in a municipal hospital in this country. Young physicians, attracted by Minot's reputation and the unusual new opportunities for clinical research, eagerly sought appointments. Under Minot's stimulating influence, discoveries in other areas of medicine were made by his junior colleagues, among them Maxwell Finland, Chester S. Keefer, and Soma Weiss. Work on the cause of pernicious anemia was already in progress under William B. Castle, with whom Minot later published his only book, Pathological Physiology and Clinical Description of the Anemias (1936). In collaboration with Clark W. Heath, Minot demonstrated (1931-1932) the effectiveness of iron administration in patients with chronic hypochromic anemia; with Stacy R. Mettier he showed that the frequent lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of these patients was a significant factor in their decreased ability to assimilate iron, and with Maurice B. Strauss and Stanley Cobb he proved (1933) the importance of dietary inadequacy in causing \"alcoholic\" polyneuritis. In 1936, with Minot's encouragement, Arthur J. Patek, Jr., and Richard P. Stetson began observations on hemophilia showing that transfusions of normal platelet-free blood plasma temporarily corrected the abnormal blood coagulation. This led to the discovery, in collaboration with Francis H. L. Taylor, the biochemist of the Thorndike, of a plasma globulin of great value in the later management of hemophilia. Along with his research, Minot assumed teaching duties at Harvard Medical School, where he held appointments as assistant professor (1918-1927), clinical professor (1927-1928), and professor (1928-1948). Although his academic positions, administrative duties, and reputation as a consultant always made heavy demands upon him, he published some 150 papers, most dealing with blood disorders and the effects of nutritional deficiencies. He also found time for stimulation and encouragement of his pupils, often emphasized by notes concerning their research interests, handwritten on scraps of paper. By 1956, almost fifty of more than 400 graduates of the Thorndike or its affiliated medical services had become professors in American medical schools, and sixteen occupied distinguished posts abroad. In 1947 Minot resigned as director of the Thorndike Laboratory.\n\nPersonality\n\nAlthough attention to detail suited Minot's temperament, in carrying out this regimen he was greatly aided by his wife, who was especially helpful in minimizing interruptions of his professional activities.\n\nMinot was a proper Bostonian, but he went his way unconcerned when that way was not the accepted one. In his conversation, the description of any event required that it first be placed in detail in its setting. This compulsion could greatly prolong a five-minute scheduled conference.\n\nMinot had hobbies in which he took pleasure and pride. He grew irises of prize-winning beauty in his flower garden in Brookline, Massachusetts, and as a summer sailor, he was familiar with the coast of Maine and the warmer waters south of Cape Cod. His private life centered on his family and friends, but on occasion students, professional associates, or foreign visitors found a warm welcome in his home.\n\nPhysical Characteristics: At the age of thirty-five, Minot developed severe diabetes. Placed under the care of Elliott P. Joslin, he began a course of rigorous dietary restriction, virtually the only treatment then known. In spite of his illness and a progressive loss in weight, Minot continued to work. At the age of thirty-five, Minot developed severe diabetes. Placed under the care of Elliott P. Joslin, he began a course of rigorous dietary restriction, virtually the only treatment then known. In spite of his illness and a progressive loss in weight, Minot continued to work. The discovery of insulin announced in 1922 by Frederick G. Banting and Charles H. Best of Toronto, saved his life. Adhering to a carefully measured diet balanced by precise injections of insulin, a treatment that continued for life, he made a good recovery. In spite of excellent medical care in his middle fifties, Minot developed some of the vascular and neurological complications of diabetes. In 1947, he had a stroke that paralyzed his left side."
