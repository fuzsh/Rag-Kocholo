It is always exciting to change out these banners, as they are the first thing that people see when approaching the Museum.\n\nThis new group of banners includes some dear friends of the Museum and familiar faces all throughout Durham. In this collection, we feature the late MaryAnn Black, one of the Museum’s founding board members and biggest supporters when we opened almost a decade ago. We also include Mr. William Gaston Pearson, the very first principal of Hillside High School. Last but certainly not least, musical giant Clyde McPhatter’s radiant smiles upon visitors as they make their way to our front door.\n\nStop on by the Museum to take in these new banners of the Faces of Durham exhibit!"
