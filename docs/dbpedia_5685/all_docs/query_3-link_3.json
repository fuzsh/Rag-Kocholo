        "text": "On Dec. 1, 1865, Shaw University was established in Raleigh, North Carolina, as a co-ed campus with support from private donors and the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. It is the second oldest Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in the South.\n\nWhile most HBCU’s at the time were preparing their students to be preachers and teachers, Shaw University sought to educate Black lawyers and doctors. According to the Shaw University website:\n\nThe University was founded in 1865 by Henry Martin Tupper, a native of Monson, Massachusetts, a soldier in the Union Army during the Civil War, and a graduate of Amherst College and Newton Theological Seminary.\n\nShaw boasts many “firsts”: the first college in the nation to offer a four-year medical program, the first historically Black college in the nation to open its doors to women, and the first historically Black college in North Carolina to be granted an “A” rating by the State Department of Public Instruction."
