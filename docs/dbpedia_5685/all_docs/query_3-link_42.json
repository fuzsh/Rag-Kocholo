        "text": "Shaw University was one of the places to be hit by the series of storms which rained down tornadoes upon North Carolina. While the devastation is still being assessed across the city and state, Shaw was one of the places in Raleigh hit pretty hard. There are several large and old uprooted trees nears the Bell Tower, sections of the roof of Estey Hall were blown off, and the Student Center sustained a great deal of damage.\n\nAlthough classes were cancelled for the remainder of the semester, efforts are underway for students across NC college campuses to come together to clean up the damage.\n\nRead more »\n\nEstey Hall may be the most beautiful historic building in all of Raleigh. It has a rich and detailed history, tied in with many parts of the city.\n\nEstey Hall is the first building constructed for the higher education of black women in the United States. It is also the oldest surviving building of Shaw University, the first institutionalized effort to educate former slaves after the Civil War. A Union army chaplain and Baptist missionary, Henry Martin Tupper, founded the school in 1865. Tupperâ€™s efforts were part of a widespread, church-based movement to educate former slaves in the post-Civil War South. Originally meeting in a Raleigh hotel room, Tupperâ€™s school was subsequently provided a building by the Freedmenâ€™s Bureau. In 1870, with the financial assistance of Massachusetts benefactor Elijah J. Shaw, the school purchased a tract of land at the south end of Fayetteville Street, near the former Governorâ€™s Mansion. Five years later, the school was chartered by the General Assembly as Shaw University.\n\nShaw began to admit women soon after its founding, and in 1874, â€œEstey Seminaryâ€ was erected to serve them. Named for Vermont contributor Jacob Estey, the building was designed by G. S. H. Appleget, architect of the Colonel J. M. Heck house and several other large residences north of downtown.\n\n— National Park Service\n\nAs noted above, the architect was G. S. H. Appleget, who designed the Heck-Andrews House and other historic houses on Blount Street and the surrounding areas. Estey, the building’s namesake, also has a colorful history.\n\nIn 1855, Jacob Estey organized the first manufacturing company to bear his name, Estey & Green, which was followed by Estey & Company; J. Estey & Company; Estey Organ Company; and finally Estey Organ Corporation, until the company went out of business in 1960.\n\nDuring these more than one hundred years, Estey became the largest and best known manufacturer of reed organs in the world, building more than 520,000 instruments, all of which carried the inscription of “Brattleboro, Vt. USA”\n\n— Wikipedia\n\nIn addition to being the first historically black college of the south, Shaw also is home to the Leonard Medical School building. Leonard Medical School was the nation’s first four year medical school as well as the first medical school dedicated to teaching African Americans in the south."
