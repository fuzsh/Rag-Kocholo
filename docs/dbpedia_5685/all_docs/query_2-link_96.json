        "text": "Moves at DIR, Aetna, and in the Senate\n\nBrian Rawson will temporary hold the top job at the state's Department of Information Resources while the board looks for a permanent replacement to Larry Olson, who unexpectedly resigned after less than three years on the job. DIR just signed a huge computer and information services contract with IBM, and Olson was in place to oversee that deal. Rawson's a veteran of several state agencies — now the IT outsourcing contract, which affects more than two dozen agencies, is on his desk.\n\nState Sen.-elect Kirk Watson hired Edna Ramon Butts, a veteran of the attorney general's office and the Texas Department of Insurance, as his general counsel. Stacy Gaston Pearson, formerly with Sen. Frank Madla, D-San Antonio, will be his legislative director, and Steve Scheibal, a former reporter with the Austin American-Statesman, will be his policy director.\n\nShannon Phillips Meroney is Aetna's new in-house lobbyist for Texas and six other states. She'd been at Thompson Coe Cousins & Irons lobbying for a variety of insurance clients. She's also done time with the state's Office of Public Insurance Counsel and with the Texas attorney general's office.\n\nAmbrister, finally, and a bunch of other stuff. . .\n\nState Sen. Ken Armbrister, D-Victoria, is now officially a member of Gov. Rick Perry's staff. He'll be the governor's legislative liaison next session, as soon as his term in the Senate ends. Armbrister was elected in 1982 to the first of two terms in the House and then in 1986 to the beginning of his twenty years in the Senate. Before all that, he was a cop and a school board member. He decided not to run for reelection this year.\n\nCongressman-turned-lobster Tom Loeffler of San Antonio is one of eight new national finance chairs for John McCain's presidential exploratory committee. That's another George W. Bush poobah in the Arizona senator's tent.\n\nAnd James Huffines of Dallas will chair McCain's Texas efforts. He's chairman of the University of Texas Board of Regents and is closely allied with Gov. Rick Perry (who hasn't weighed in on the 2008 race). He'll join honorary chairs already announced, including his former boss, Gov. Bill Clements.\n\nLuis Saenz — the manager for Gov. Rick Perry's campaign — will hang out a lobby shingle as the new legislative session begins. He's a former assistant Texas Secretary of State and survived tours with Perry, Carole Keeton Strayhorn, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Henry Bonilla, and Phil Gramm. He'll office with a group of Republican consultants that includes Cliff Johnson, Reggie Bashur, Rossanna Salazar, Clay Pope and Joe Allbaugh.\n\nLobbyist Carl Richie Jr. is starting his own law firm after four years as a partner in the Austin office of Gardere Wynne Sewell. They'll share some clients and some wanted to move with him.\n\nMarshall Kenderdine is leaving the Pink Building and hanging out a lobby shingle. He was an aide to Sen. Todd Staples, R-Palestine, ran Rep. Byron Cook's first campaign, and worked as an analyst on House Appropriations.\n\nRaymond \"Tripp\" Davenport is the new chairman of the Texas Ethics Commission, and the board named Tom Harrison — who used to be that agency's executive director — the vice chairman.\n\nAppointments: The second inauguration of Gov. Rick Perry and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst will be on January 16 — a week after the Legislature returns to Austin. Mica Mosbacher of Houston will chair it; co-chairs are Jody Grant and James Huffines of Dallas. Finance chairs are H. Scott Caven Jr. of Houston and Colleen McHugh of Corpus Christi.\n\nPerry named Arabia Vargas of San Antonio, an attorney, to the Parental Advisory Council that advises the Department of Family Protective Services.\n\nRichard McDonald of Amarillo is the newest member of the Canadian River Compact Commission; he's the former president of the Texas Cattle Feeders Association.\n\nThe Guv named John Eckstrum of Montgomery and Tom Mesa Jr. of Deer Park to the Texas Real Estate Commission. Eckstrum is a real estate broker. Mesa is an assistant director with the City of Houston with banking experience as a commercial loan officer.\n\nScott Johnson of Frisco will join the Texas Economic Development Commission. He's the veep for acquisitions and development for Omni Hotels.\n\nDeaths: Lillian Condra, who worked for a series of House members over the years (seven that we know of). She was 75.\n\nOnly a handful of top managers at the state comptroller's office survived a Friday afternoon purge; incoming Comptroller Susan Combs has started writing the names of some of her own people into those empty boxes on the org chart.\n\nAides to the comptroller-elect told nine top managers at that agency that they won't have jobs there in 2007.\n\nIn a series of meetings Friday afternoon, the employees were told, one by one, that their last day with the agency will be Dec. 31, before Combs is sworn in as the replacement for Carole Keeton Strayhorn, who has been comptroller for the past eight years.\n\nCombs herself apparently didn't participate. The meetings were led by Lisa Woods, who'll be an associate deputy comptroller in the new administration.\n\nThe nine include Tim Mashburn, general counsel; Dick Ellis, communications; Eddie Solis, special assistant for legislative and border affairs; Betty Ressel, special assistant for technical assistance; Ruthie Ford, special assistant for expenditure analysis; Susan Driver, the agency's internal auditor; Chris O'Dell, information resources manager; Steve Hudson, agency administration; and Kaye Tucker, taxpayer publications.\n\nThe two top agency employees under Strayhorn — Deputy Comptroller Billy Hamilton and Associate Deputy Comptroller Jesse Ancira — previously announced plans to leave. Hamilton left at the beginning of the month; Ancira will follow at the end of the year.\n\nTwo more positions were already vacant on the agency's organization chart. Of the 18 people at the top of the comptroller's office under Strayhorn, just five will remain at the beginning of Combs' term.\n\nCombs didn't announce the firings — she and her staff wouldn't comment on them, either — and hasn't unveiled a full list of who will be helping her run the agency when she takes over next month. Woods will be associate to a deputy who's not been named, former Dallas Morning News reporter Pete Slover will be special counsel (he's also a lawyer), and Sarah Whitley will be special advisor.\n\nMike Reissig, a former chief revenue estimator who most recently has been director of tax administration, will be an associate deputy comptroller. His current job will go to William Hamner, his assistant director. Suzi Whittenton will become director of fiscal management, replacing Ken Welch, who left a few weeks ago for a job with the state's Health and Human Services Commission."
