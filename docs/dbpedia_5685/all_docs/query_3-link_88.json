Shaw has often been called the mother of African American colleges in NC, as the founding presidents of three other NC HBCUs were all alums of Shaw. The Shaw University Journal: Commencement Number [1937] is the earliest yearbook from Shaw University now available on DigitalNC, but Shaw has shared campus publicans dating back to 1882.\n\nThe three new yearbooks are available at the links below:\n\nThe Shaw University Journal: Commencement Number [1937]\n\nThe Shaw University Journal: Commencement Number [1939]\n\nThe Bear [1953]"
