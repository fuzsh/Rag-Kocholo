        "text": "Ella Josephine Baker (December 13, 1903 – December 13, 1986) was an African-American civil rights and human rights activist in the United States. She was a largely behind-the-scenes organizer whose career spanned more than five decades. In New York City and the South, she worked alongside some of the most noted civil rights leaders of the 20th century, including W. E. B. Du Bois, Thurgood Marshall, A. Philip Randolph, and Martin Luther King Jr. She also mentored many emerging activists, such as Diane Nash, Stokely Carmichael, Rosa Parks, and Bob Moses, whom she first mentored as leaders in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).Baker criticized professionalized, charismatic leadership; she promoted grassroots organizing, radical democracy, and the ability of the oppressed to understand their worlds and advocate for themselves. She realized this vision most fully in the 1960s as the primary advisor and strategist of the SNCC. She has been ranked as \"One of the most important African American leaders of the twentieth century and perhaps the most influential woman in the civil rights movement.\" She is known for her critiques not only of racism within American culture, but also of sexism within the civil rights movement.\n\nHenry Plummer Cheatham (December 27, 1857 – November 29, 1935) was an educator, farmer and politician, elected as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1889 to 1893 from North Carolina. He was one of only five African Americans elected to Congress from the South in the Jim Crow era of the last decade of the nineteenth century, as disfranchisement reduced black voting. After that, no African Americans would be elected from the South until 1972 and none from North Carolina until 1992.\n\nBorn on May 28, 1944, in Atlanta, Georgia, Gladys Knight emerged as a groundbreaking vocalist and performer who stamped an indelible mark on the world of music. Known endearingly as the \"Empress of Soul,\" Knight's musical journey began at a tender age of seven when she won Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour TV show contest. This early triumph set the stage for an illustrious career that spanned over six decades, making her one of the most enduring artists in popular music. Knight's career trajectory took a defining turn when she formed the iconic group \"Gladys Knight & the Pips\" with her siblings and cousins in the mid-1950s. With its unique fusion of gospel, soul, and pop music, the group produced numerous hits, including the Grammy-winning singles \"Midnight Train to Georgia\" and \"Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye).\" The success of the group established Knight as a significant figure in music, known for her passionate vocal style and dynamic stage presence. Beyond her musical accomplishments, Knight also explored acting and authored an autobiography. She made appearances in television shows and films, demonstrating her versatility as an entertainer. Her commitment to philanthropy is another notable aspect of her life; Knight has devoted time and resources to various causes, reflecting her belief in giving back to the community. A seven-time Grammy winner, Knight's remarkable contribution to music and society truly underscore her status as an icon and a trailblazer.\n\nJames Edward Cheek (December 4, 1932 – January 8, 2010), president emeritus of Howard University, was born in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina. Despite suffering from severe cataracts, Cheek was an honor student at Washington Street Grammar School. He graduated from Immanuel Lutheran College with a secondary diploma in 1950 and served as a member of the United States Air Force in Korea in 1951, eventually earning a Bachelor of Arts in sociology and history from Shaw University. In 1955, Cheek received a Master of Divinity from Colgate Rochester University in 1958 and a PhD from Drew University in 1962. During this period, Cheek was honored with a Colgate Rochester Fellowship, a Rockefeller Doctoral Fellowship and a Lily Foundation Fellowship. He was member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity."
