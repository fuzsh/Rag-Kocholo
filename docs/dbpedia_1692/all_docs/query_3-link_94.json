        "text": "Charles Reis Felix must have fond memories of growing up as a Portuguese-American kid in New Bedford.\n\nIn his new book -- both biography and autobiography -- titled \"Through a Portagee Gate\" Mr. Felix fondly recalls his cobbler father and muses about growing up around Weld Square.\n\nThe book is a glimpse into what it means to grow up Portuguese-American in New Bedford with an unusual and honest sense of humor.\n\nThe book also desmystifies the negative connotation behind the word \"Portagee.\"\n\n\"'Through a Portagee Gate' is a plain-spoken down-to-earth account of an American voyage rich in fable anecdote and wit\" said Katherine Vaz author of the critically acclaimed book \"Saudade.\" \"Charles Felix Reis writes as boldly as if carving scrimshaw about the soles fixed by his father a cobbler and the tread of life upon various nearby souls including his own.\"\n\nMr. Felix was born in New Bedford one of four children of Portuguese immigrants. He attended local public schools and graduated from New Bedford high school in 1941.\n\nHe went on to become an elementary school teacher in California in his adult life.\n\nHe currently lives in California with his wife Barbara in a cabin among the redwoods of Northern California.\n\nAccording to the publisher in \"Through a Portagee Gate\" Mr. Felix uses \"unforgettable dialogue and vivid characterizations worthy of Steinbeck a prose sometimes poignant and other times hilarious that strips human experience to its bare and powerful elements.\"\n\nMost of that prose centers about Mr. Felix's father Jose and his cobbler shop. Mr. Felix writes about his father's work ethic and spirit of thriftiness.\n\nThe book also includes sections about family life about the residents of Weld Square and about Mr. Felix's own coming of age.\n\n\"'Through a Portagee Gate' is a valuable document a record a history an autobiography a memoir an elegy\" said Frank Gaspar author of the critically acclaimed book \"Leaving Pico.\"\n\n\"When readers encounter Felix's carefully drawn scenes his exacting prose and his deeply human people they understand that he is engaged in a work of art. Felix is a writer possessed of humor wit and a great heart.\"\n\nThe book was published by the Center for Portuguese Studies and Culture at UMass Dartmouth as part of the \"Portuguese in the Americas\" series.\n\nThe 482-page book is available for purchase through Luso-Brazilian Books by calling 1-800-727-LUSO or by visiting www.lusobraz.com.\n\nThe book is also available through the Center for Portuguese Studies at UMD by calling (508) 999-8255 or emailing \"greis@umass.edu.\n\nThe book is available as a paperback for $20.\n\nThis story appeared on Page C4 of The Standard-Times on November 7 2004."
