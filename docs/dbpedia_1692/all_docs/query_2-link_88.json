        "text": "Hi Everyone!\n\nWelcome to Let’s Deconstruct a Story! This month I’m talking to Jai Chakrabarti about his wonderful story, “A Small Sacrifice for an Enormous Happiness.” Please find the link to the story here at LitHub. It’s best to read the story before listening to the podcast.\n\nPlease listen to the podcast on Spotify here or Apple here or Audible here or pretty much anywhere you get your podcasts!\n\nBio:\n\nO. Henry and Pushcart Prize winner Jai Chakrabarti is the author of the novel A Play for the End of the World (Knopf ’21), which earned him the National Jewish Book Award for debut fiction. The novel was also recognized as the Association of Jewish Libraries Honor Book, a finalist for the Rabindranath Tagore Prize, and long-listed for the PEN/Faulkner Award.\n\nChakrabarti is also the author of the story collection A Small Sacrifice for an Enormous Happiness (Knopf), which was included in several end-of-year lists, including The New Yorker’s Best Books of 2023. His short fiction has been published in Best American Short Stories, Ploughshares, One Story, Electric Literature, A Public Space, Conjunctions, and elsewhere and performed on Selected Shorts by Symphony Space.\n\nBeyond fiction, Chakrabarti’s nonfiction has been widely published in journals such as The Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, Writer’s Digest, Berfrois, and LitHub. He was an Emerging Writer Fellow with A Public Space and holds an MFA in Creative Writing from Brooklyn College. Despite his literary pursuits, Chakrabarti is also a trained computer scientist.\n\nBorn in Kolkata, India, he currently lives in New York with his family and is a faculty member at Bennington Writing Seminars.\n\nJai’s books are available on Bookshop or Amazon.\n\nNext month, I’ll be talking to Leigh Newman about her story, “An Extravaganza in Two Acts,” also available via Electric Literature. If you have any questions for Leigh, feel free to contact me, and I will pass them along.\n\nAlso, I’ve switched over to Let’s Deconstruct a Story accounts on both Facebook and Instagram. Please follow us on Facebook and Instagram as well as Spotify or Apple.\n\nI was hoping to send out a newsletter with my big list of 2023 resources/books/recommendations, but I have to be honest, 2023 was a TOUGH year, so I have compiled a small resources list (below) and hope you will enjoy it. Cheers to more great stories in 2024!\n\n2023 Recommendations:\n\nI read 52 books (besides short story collections) this year and although I can’t manage a “best of” list, four books really stuck with me:\n\nThe Poetics of Wrongness by Rachel Zucker\n\nDemon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver\n\nHappening by Annie Ernaux\n\nThe Vaster Wilds by Lauren Groff\n\nIt goes without saying, I was truly inspired by the work of every short story writer who visited the podcast in 2023!\n\nHere is the complete list of 2023 Let’s Deconstruct a Story Guests plus links to their work:\n\nKevin Fitton\n\nJulie Ann Stewart\n\nMeghan Louise Wagner\n\nRobin Luce Martin\n\nAnna Caritj\n\nCaroline Kim\n\nChad B. Anderson\n\nGeorge Singleton\n\nBonnie Jo Campbell\n\nKatherine Vaz\n\nThank you so much to everyone who visited the show in 2023!\n\nIn other news, in May 2023 I created and launched an audiobook.\n\nMy short story collection, I Have the Answer, was published by Wayne State University Press in April 2020. The timing alone would have been what I like to call a suckitude, but the press was also going through a kerfuffle, so the book just sort of floated off into the ether.\n\nIn 2023, I asked for (and graciously received) the audiobook rights from WSUP. With the help of sound engineer, Elliot Bancel, I contacted five audiobook narrators and read a few stories myself. I am terrible at self-promotion, but I am proud of it so wanted to give it a year-end shout out.\n\nCheck it out here.\n\nLastly, a couple of writing resources:\n\nI LOVED the generative experiments offered by Gabriela Denise Frank through the Poetry Foundation. I took this one-day seminar late in a very tough year (2023-epic suckitude) and was completely bowled over by this class and her teaching technique. I was tempted–like Gollum–to keep this information to myself, but I am sharing it here against my better judgement.\n\nDid you know you can join Off Campus Writers Workshop even if you don’t live in Chicago? And if you join for a nominal fee, all of their weekly classes are $10 a piece. This year they are hosting Peter Orner, Charles Baxter, and many other luminaries.\n\nEvery year I complete a year-end review offered by Annette Gendler and I have to say that even though I will be glad to say adieu to 2023, I actually wrote a lot more than I realized, and I only know this because I took the time to complete this inventory. It might make you feel MUCH better about your writing life. Here’s the link.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nKelly"
