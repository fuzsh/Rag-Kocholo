        "text": "Roland Peter Vaz passed away peacefully on Wednesday morning of November 1st, 2023. Roland was born on December 30, 1957 to Dorothy and Anthony Vaz in Bangalore, India but very fondly claimed Mangalore as his “home.” He was lovingly known as Rolly, was very outgoing, and always had a smile on his face. He loved working with his hands, whether that was tending to his extensive vegetable garden or working on his or his sons’ cars in his garage. Most recently, his most cherished time was spent making memories with his one-year-old grandson. Rolly always had the ability to make anyone laugh and made sure anyone around had a full plate of food, especially when he was grilling his world-famous tandoori chicken. He is survived by his two sons, Ryan (wife Aishwarya) and Darryl Vaz; his grandson, Rihaan Vaz; his mother Dorothy Vaz; his brothers, Romeo (wife Lyra), Roby (wife Priscilla, and Rocky (wife Anita); his sisters, Julie and Shally (husband Vittal); and numerous nieces, nephews, and cousins. He is preceded in death by his father, Anthony Vaz."
