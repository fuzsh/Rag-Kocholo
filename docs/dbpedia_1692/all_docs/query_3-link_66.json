        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nWe're a little late with this episode and it's all my fault! As I mentioned in my May 1st blog post (sign up here for updates), for the first time in four years, I conducted an amazing interview with Sheila Kohler and forgot to hit record on Zoom. Sheila--the most gracious person on Earth--forgave me for wasting 45 minutes of her time and agreed to re-record the episode.\n\nThank you to Sheila for sitting down with me twice!\n\nAfter I recovered from the shame, I realized this might be a great boon for readers. I loved Cracksâthe short story, the novel, and the movie! You will find links to all three below. It was fascinating to talk about Sheila's adaptation from short story to novel and to hear about the making of the movie and the decision to set the movie in England rather than South Africa.\n\nI hope you have had time to read the short story and the novel. What did you think of the movie? Let me know if you have any follow-up questions or comments. I would love to hear.\n\nHere are the links: Content Warning: Sexual Assault\n\nCracks, the short story, by Sheila Kohler\n\nCracks, The Novel by Sheila Kohler, available at Bookshop and Amazon.\n\nCracks, The Movie\n\nIn other news...\n\nI am taking a sabbatical from the podcast this summer to rest, regroup, and figure out what direction to take this show in in the future. I love doing it, but every now and then, I think it's a good idea to reevaluate and hone in on what has been valuable and what parts need to go.\n\nMy first guest in the fall is Tim Tomlinson. Although I will be talking to him about one of his short stories, he has a new book coming out this month. It looks terrific! Check out kellyfordon.com for a picture of the cover and publication information from Nirala.\n\nCheers!\n\nKelly\n\nSheila Kohler Bio:\n\nSheila Kohler was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, the younger of two girls. Upon matriculation at 17 from Saint Andrews, with a distinction in history (1958), she left the country for Europe. She lived for 15 years in Paris, where she married, did her undergraduate degree in literature at the Sorbonne, and a graduate degree in psychology at the Institut Catholique. After raising her three girls, she moved to the USA in 1981, and did an MFA in writing at Columbia.\n\nIn the summer of 1987, her first published story, âThe Mountain,â came out in âThe Quarterlyâ and received an O.Henry prize and was published in the O.Henry Prize Stories of 1988. It also became the first chapter in her first novel, âThe Perfect Place,â which was published by Knopf the next year.\n\nKnopf also published the first volume of her short stories, âMiracles in America,â in 1990.\n\nKohler has won two O.Henry prizes for âThe Mountainâ 1988 and âThe Transitional Objectâ 2008. She has been short-listed in the O.Henry Prize Stories for three years running: in 1999 for the story, âAfricansâ; in 2000 for âCasualty,â which had appeared in the Ontario Review; and 2001 for âDeath in Rome,â a story which had appeared in The Antioch Review. âCasualtyâ was also included in the list of distinguished stories in The Best American Short Stories of 2001.\n\nIn 1994 she published a second novel, âThe House on R Street,â also with Knopf, about which Patrick McGrath said, in âThe New York Times Book Review: â âSheila Kohler has achieved in this short novel a remarkable atmosphere, a fine delicate fusion of period, society and climate.â\n\nIn 1998 she published a short story, âAfricans,â in Story Magazine, which was chosen for the Best American Short Stories of 1999, was read and recorded at Symphony Space and at The American Repertory Theatre in Boston and was translated into Japanese. It was also included in her second collection of stories,â One Girl,â published by Helicon Nine, which won the Willa Cather Prize in 1998 judged by William Gass.\n\nIn 1999 she published her third novel, âCracks,â with Zoland, which received a starred review from Kirkus, wa\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nI'm thrilled to host Cara Blue Adams today on the podcast. We talked about her stellar short story, \"Vision,\" available from Joyland Magazine. I met Cara years ago at the Kenyon Writers Workshop (which I highly recommend by the way...) so it was great fun to reconnect on the podcast.\n\nCara's work was recommended by Vincent Perrone, who is a part owner of the co-op bookstore, Book Suey, in Hamtramck, MI, so he joined us for the podcast as well. See his bio below, and please consider buying from Bookshop or even directly from Book Suey to support local bookstores!\n\nEnjoy the show and see you on April 1st!\n\nKelly\n\nCara Blue Adams is the author of the interlinked story collection You Never Get It Back (University of Iowa Press, 2021), named a New York Times Editorsâ Choice and awarded the John Simmons Short Fiction Prize, judged by Brandon Taylor, who calls it âa modern classic.â The collection was shortlisted for the Mary McCarthy Prize and longlisted for the Story Prize. Over twenty-five of her stories appear in magazines like the Granta, The Kenyon Review, Epoch, American Short Fiction, and Electric Literature, and her nonfiction appears in Bookforum and The Believer.\n\nShe has received the Kenyon Review Short Fiction Prize, the Missouri Review William Peden Prize, and the Meringoff Prize in Fiction, along with a 2018 Center for Fiction Emerging Writer fellowship and selection as a Pushcart Prize Notable. She has also received support from the Bread Loaf Writersâ Conference, the Sewanee Writersâ Conference, the VCCA, the Lighthouse Works, the Kimmel Harding Nelson Center for the Arts, and the New York State Council on the Arts.\n\nCara earned a B.A. in English Language and Literature from Smith College and an MFA from the University of Arizona. Originally from Vermont, she has lived in Boston, Tucson, Montreal, Maine, South Carolina, and Baton Rouge. She is a former coeditor of The Southern Review. Currently, she is an associate professor in the MFA program at Temple University and lives in Brooklyn and the Hudson Valley.\n\nPurchase Cara's book at Book Suey (link above) or Book Shop or Amazon.\n\nMy co-host:\n\nVincent James Perrone is the author of the poetry collection, Starving Romantic (11:11 Press, 2018), the microchap, Travelogue For The Dispossessed (Ghost City Press, 2021), and a contributor to the anthology, Collected Voices in the Expanded Field (11:11 Press, 2020).

You are going to learn so much about writing historical fiction. Leigh is a hoot! The conversation moved at a clip, so I have some discussion notes for you below.\n\nAlso, check out the bonus question one of my earlier guests, award-winning author and Pulitzer-prize nominated journalist Desiree Cooper, sent to Leigh after we recorded the podcast.\n\nWe have a new Let's Deconstruct a Story Facebook page and Instagram page. I'd love to see you there. Please like or follow it if you have a chance, and feel free to post questions, comments, or suggestions for future guests.\n\nHere's a link to the podcast on Apple, Spotify, and Audible.\n\nNext month, I'll be talking to Cara Blue Adams about her short story, \"Vision,\" available here. You might consider buying Cara Blue Adams' book, You Never Get it Back, from Bookshop because my co-host for that podcast, Vincent Perrone, is part owner of Book Suey in Hamtramck, and all sales that roll through Bookshop next month will support his store.\n\nHappy reading!\n\nKelly\n\nPS: Do you have trouble sleeping? If so, I highly recommend Nothing Much Happens, Bedtime Stories for Grown-ups by Kathryn Nicolai. Apparently, Kathryn also lives in Michigan. I don't know her, but I'm obsessed with these bedtime stories because they are designed to put you to sleep, and her voice is very soothing, but they are also wonderful. If you are in the mood for delightful, feel-good stories, check them out here.\n\nPSS: I have to give one television show a plug...I was listening to a podcast featuring a former classmate from Kenyon, and she suggested a Swedish show called The Restaurant. IT IS SO GOOD. It's winter here in Detroit, and bleak bleak bleak, so I figured, like me, you might want to light some candles and curl up with a good drama. This one is cutting into my reading time, which is the highest praise from me. Let me know what you think!!\n\nLeigh Newman: Leigh Newman's collection Nobody Gets Out Alive (Scribner) was long-listed for the National Book Award for Fiction and The Story Prize.
