        "text": "Celebrating the power of words to change the world and literacy to change lives, the Provincetown Book Festival is an annual weekend of programs that support the culture of books, writing and reading in Provincetown. Most of the programs are presented by invited authors who have recently published a book of fiction, non-fiction, poetry or plays. The Festival strives for inclusiveness and diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender. Festival programs emphasize conversations between authors, discussion with the audience, and other collaborative forms.\n\nThe Provincetown Book Festival is sponsored by the Provincetown Public Library. In 2015, the Provincetown Board of Library Trustees inaugurated the Rose Dorothea Award, honoring a person with a strong connection to the Outer Cape who has made a significant contribution through the written word. In 2016, the first Provincetown Book Festival was created, as a companion and extension of the Rose Dorothea Award.\n\nPartly inspired by the Nantucket Book Festival, the Provincetown Book Festival started out on a shoe string. On a September weekend in 2016, about one hundred people came to Provincetown Library to see Jamaican-born author Nicole Dennis-Benn paired with Portuguese-American author Katherine Vaz discussing writing about their home cultures; queer writers Paul Lisicky and Tim Murphy sharing about AIDS in Provincetown and New York; and Alexander Chee and Sally Cabot Gunning on writing historical fiction, among others. It was a small but memorable beginning.\n\nWe are very much indebted to the Festival Advisory Committee, who work hard to create stellar programs. The Advisory Committee members have changed over the years, but one constant has been the wonderful Julia Glass, the Festival’s godmother. Alums include A. C. Burch, Jamie Brenner, Stephen Borkowski, Adam Chromy, Stephen DesRoche, William Mann, Jerome Murphy, and Tim Murphy.\n\nThe 2024 Advisory Committee members are: Scott Bane, Chris Castellani, Kim Foote, Julia Glass, Edgar Gomez, Akil Kumarasamy, Russ Lopez, Patrick Nolan, Amy Raff, and Marian Roth.\n\nQuestions? Please contact Festival Director, Nan Cinnater: ncinnater@clamsnet.org."
