Congratulations to our amazing contributors!\n\nIssue 19\n\nIssue 20\n\nOnline\n\nPushcart Prize Editors Nominate 8 Pieces from The Common\n\nPodcast: Katherine Vaz on “The Treasure Hunt of August Dias”\n\nListen on Apple Podcasts.\n\nListen on Google Podcasts .\n\nListen on Spotify.\n\nKatherine Vaz speaks to managing editor Emily Everett about her short story “The Treasure Hunt of August Dias,” which appears in Issue 20 of The Common magazine. In this conversation, Vaz talks about her long career of writing novels and short stories about Portuguese and Portuguese-American characters and their rich, complex communities. She also discusses her current project, a heavily researched historical novel about Portuguese immigrants set during the Civil War.\n\nPodcast: Katherine Vaz on “The Treasure Hunt of August Dias”\n\nThe Treasure Hunt of August Dias\n\nBy KATHERINE VAZ\n\nThe apricot tree in my childhood yard would sieve the night. Pouring through the openwork of the leaves, the moonlight littered the ground with patches shaped like bats. Because we lived in the Sunset District of San Francisco, sea drafts kept ruffling the leaves, so the bats were always fluttering their wings. Sometimes I would lie down and let the light-bats tap all over me. We lived in the bottom flat of a spindly three-story house, and there was a fig tree too, and blackberries on brambles thick as the Lord’s crown of thorns, right in the heart of the city. We had picnics with the queijadas my father made—the coconut tarts that were a specialty of his family’s bakery on the island of Terceira in the Azores. His job while raising me, his only child, was fulfilling dessert orders for restaurants, and he rented a tiny industrial kitchen in Chinatown from three to nine in the morning. Once, a triumph, the Tadich Grill requested his alfenim to decorate their pastry cart—the white sugar confection molded into doves or miniature baskets.\n\nThe Treasure Hunt of August Dias\n\nFriday Reads: October 2020\n\nCurated by ISABEL MEYERS\n\nHere at The Common, we’re gearing up to celebrate our 10th anniversary with the release of our fall issue.
