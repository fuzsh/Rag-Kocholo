As mourners arrived at the chapel for a Vigil for Grief and Remembrance, each received an unlit candle. During the vigil, Bates multifaith chaplain Brittany Longsdorf brought a flame from candles of remembrance on the altar to the first row. From there, community members lit one anotherâ€™s candles, passing the flame back, the light growing quickly, person to person, heart to heart. Photograph by Phyllis Graber Jensen."
