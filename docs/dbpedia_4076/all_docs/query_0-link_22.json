Rob was an honor student and gifted writer, receiving the E. Angus Powell Award for American Enterprise in his junior year. He was a member of an outstanding class of students who admired each other, worked well together and held the highest academic average to come through Collegiate at that time. He loved and excelled at football and lacrosse; the boys’ lacrosse team won the 1987 State Championship and was undefeated. Rob was an unrelenting voice in encouraging Collegiate’s spirit. The Rob Kelly Spirit Award recognizes those efforts. Rob’s endowment is to support boys’ lacrosse at Collegiate by providing income for equipment, travel and clinics for players and coaches alike. An award will be given annually to a lacrosse player that exemplifies Rob’s sense of spirit.\n\nPast recipients of this award are:\n\n2003 (Inaugural Year) Ned Rider\n\n2004 Hatton Taylor and Devon Kelley\n\n2005 Hatton Taylor\n\n2006 Andrew O'Shea, Mike Thompson, Michael Jarvis, Hunter Phillips\n\n2007 Jeff Hartman\n\n2008 James Taylor Christmas, Jr.\n\n2009 Jacob Oliver\n\n2010 Russell Harper & Alex Newsome\n\n2011 Riley O'Shea\n\n2012 Noboru Kobashigawa\n\n2013 Stewart Mikell Roddey, Jr.\n\n2014 Lee Strib Walker\n\n2015 Nicholas Bradley Anders\n\n2016 David Jeremy Maitland Innes\n\n2018 Benjamin Thomas Tavenner\n\n2019 Michael Robert Brost Jr.\n\n2022 Warner Featherston Lewis\n\n2023 Warner Lewis\n\nRead More"
