        "text": "MAGAZINE.RICHMOND.EDU\n\n34 the press conference, gesturing to the families. \"You can like a bill, you can lobby for a bill, but you can't hug a bill. The most gratifying stuffI've ever done, whether here or at the state level, involves people. Doing the right thing is why I do this.\" Whether this stance will cost him politically will be seen during his 2018 re-election campaign, but he will worry about that later. \"I can assure you that a lot of my district is tough-on-crime, rural, blue-collar, traditional conserva- tives,\" he said back in his office. \"This isn't a popular stand, but it's the right thing to do.\" Despite the bill's bipartisan sponsorship and what Gar- rett believes is sufficient if quiet rank-and-file support, the bill faces a number of hurdles before becoming law. It has to survive hearings and votes in congressional subcommittees. Then it has to make it through full committees. And then the entire House must take it up. So must the Senate. And then the president must sign it. That's the process they teach in high school civics text- books. What close observers of the legislative process know is that through strategic inaction, a few well-placed indi- viduals have the ability to override even majority views of the people's house. The chair of any committee or subcom- mittee can bury a bill by declining to schedule a hearing on it. Once through committees, leadership can still refuse to schedule it for a vote on the full floor. Both parties do it. A fundamental breakdown of the legislative process helps explain why voters across the political spectrum are frustrated with their government, Garrett said, speaking of legislative inaction generally. \"That is exactly why Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump performed so well,\" he said. \"If we want to break the frustration amongst people on the left and the right at Washington, then we need to free up the backlog of bills that have bipartisan support because if you want to see bipartisanship, then you have to let bills out that would have bipartisan support.\" SOPHOMORE YEAR NEARLY SUNK GARRETT'S COLLEGIATE CAREER at the University of Richmond. Louisa County High School, where he attended, didn't send high numbers of students to colleges like Richmond back then, he said, so he arrived on campus worried he might not be adequately prepared. In his first year, he buckled down and earned such high marks that he found himself moving into an honors dorm the follow- ing August. Two semesters, skipped classes, and a girlfriend later, he was faced with a 1.4 sophomore grade-point average and the prospect of losing his ROTC scholarship. He pulled it back together and graduated with a respectable GPA he recalls as around 3.0. He majored in history for the same reason he now serves in Congress. \"Everything we have as Americans today was given to us,\" he said. \"We're standing on the shoulders of giants.\" In his frequent visits to high schools, he often talks about two heroes of his who, in earlier times, would have been his constituents: Patrick Henry and Barbara Johns. More than Henry's famous \"Give me liberty or give me death\" cry, Gar- rett admires his follow-up line: \"If this be treason, make the most of it.\" For Garrett, it affirmed Henry's commitment to stand for freedom and equal opportunity against an unelected monarch even at the risk of his life. The last piece of legislation Garrett filed in the Virginia Senate, where he served from 2012 to 2017, was to make April 23 Barbara Johns Day in Virginia. On April 23, 1951, Johns organized a student walkout at her all-black high school in Farmville, a town in Garrett's district, to protest the unequal treatment of black and white schoolchildren. Her protest led to one of the five cases consolidated into Brown v. Board of Education, in which the Supreme Court invalidated laws that segregated schools on the basis of race. He introduced a similar bill in Congress honoring her nationally in April. \"The difference between Barbara Johns and Patrick Henry is that she was a 16-year-old student and he was a 37-year-old IS THERE A SPIDER IN THE HOUSE?\n\nA look at the 12 other Spiders known to have served in the House and, in one case, the Senate:\n\nJOHN AMBLER SMITH, 1873-75 According to his official congressional biog- raphy, he studied law at Richmond before his admission to the bar in 1867. University records from the period are incomplete. A SPIDER FAMILY\n\nGarrett's father, Thomas A. Sr., is Richmond class of 1966. His family's Spiders also include uncle Frank Garrett, B'61, and sister Paige Garrett Delbridge, W'91, plus \"multiple cousins and great- uncles and aunts,\" he said.\n\nANDREW JACKSON MONTAGUE, 1913-37 Attended Richmond College 1880-82. After serving as Virginia's governor (1902-06), he became a professor of law and the dean of Richmond Law. JOSEPH WHITEHEAD, 1925-31 Richmond College Class of 1889. Like Garrett, he represented Virginia's 5th District. 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910 1915 1920\n\nPrevious Page\n\nNext Page"
