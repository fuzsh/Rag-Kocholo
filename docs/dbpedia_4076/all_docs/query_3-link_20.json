        "text": "The Montagues in Virginia\n\n(17) Peter Montague (1603)\n\n(10) Richard Montacute (11) Edward Montague (1429) (12) Robert Montague (1455) (13) William Montague (1480) (14) Robert Montague (1505) (15) William Montague (1536-48) (16) Peter Montague (1580)\n\nOr Mountague/Mountecough. Peter was born on 21 January 1603 in Boveney, Burnham parish, Berkshire, England, the second son of Peter Montague and Ellenor Allen. Though his father was a farmer, or farmed an estate, Peter came from an educated family. His uncle, William, was at Eton and was a fellow at Kings College, Cambridge, and his father's cousin was the Bishop of Norwich.\n\nIn 1621, at the age of 18, Peter emigrated to the Virginia colony, in America, onboard the ship CHARLES.\n\n\"Peter Montague, servant, arrived at Virginia aboard the \"Charles\" in 1621.\" - from the \"Muster Roll\" of 23 January 1624\n\nIn October 1621 a new governor of the colony, Sir Francis Wyatt, had arrived to succeed Sir George Yeardley. There were nine ships in company with him and in the succeeding year 21 more vessels arrived with thirteen hundred settlers to reinvigorate the colony. Wyatt also brought a new constitution which broadened the rights of the people versus those of the Virginia Company.\n\nPeter was on one of the first ships to follow the new Governor, landing in Virginia in November 1621.\n\nThe Virginia Colony\n\nThe first expedition to begin colonizing Virginia began on 20 December 1606. Almost from the start, however, investors in the Virginia Company in England were unhappy with the accomplishments of their Jamestown colonists and the profitibility of the colony. A new charter, granted in 1609, allowed the Company to make its own laws and regulations, subject only to their compatibility with English law. To avoid the disputes that had characterized Virginia in its first years, the Company gave full authority and nearly dictatorial powers to the colony's governor. These changes were nearly too little and too late, for Jamestown was just then experiencing its \"starving time.\" The Company, however, was bent on persevering and sent a new batch of ships and colonists in 1611. Over the next five years, Sir Thomas Gates and then Sir Thomas Dale governed the colony with iron fists via the \"Lawes Devine, Morall, and Martiall.\"\n\nThe harsh regimes of the Virginia governors were not especially attractive to potential colonists. What was more, the colonists who did go to Virginia often did not have the skills and knowledge to help the colony prosper. The colonists not only found little of value, they were remarkably unable even to feed themselves. As a result, huge numbers of colonists perished from disease (many of which they brought with them), unsanitary conditions, and malnutrition. Between 1614 and 1618 or so, potential colonists were much more attracted to the West Indies and Bermuda than they were Virginia.\n\nVillage of Jamestown, on the James River, Virginia, c1615\n\nBy 1618, the Virginia Company was forced to change course again. The Company had not solved the problem of profitability, nor that of settlers' morale. Sir Edwin Sandys became Company Treasurer and embarked on a series of reforms. He believed that the manufacturing enterprises the Company had begun were failing due to want of manpower. He embarked on a policy of granting sub-patents to land, which encouraged groups and wealthier individuals to go to Virginia. He sought to reward investors and so distributed 100 acres of land to each adventurer. He also distributed 50 acres to each person who paid his or her own way and 50 acres more for each additional person they brought along. This was known as the Virginia headright system.\n\nWith the experiments of John Rolfe, the colony finally discovered a staple product, tobacco. The colonists wanted to plant tobacco because it was a cash crop, even though the King opposed the use of the weed. But the Company constantly discouraged the cultivation of tobacco because its production seduced the colonists away from planting corn. The colony also continued to face the problem of lack of laborers and inability to feed itself. Indian relations, which seemed quiet for a time, finally spelled the end to the Virginia Company. In 1622, Indians rose up and massacred a large number of Virginia colonists. This led to an inquiry into Company affairs and finally the revocation of its charter.\n\nWhat motivated Peter's emigration? A family tradition that can be traced back to at least 1730 has it that Pete was \"rather wild\" and that he ran away from home, selling his labor for the passage. The story goes on to say that, once in America, his master caught Peter reading one of his Latin texts and straight-away made Peter a school teacher for his children. If so, then he would have been one of the first teachers in the colony. However, as many did, he later became a planter.\n\n\"History of Peter Montague (1603 - 1659)\" by Garry Bryant\n\nPeter Montague\n\nBurgess, Commissioner\n\n(1603 - 1659)\n\nSecond son of Peter Montague and Ellenor Allen of Boveny, Burnham Parish, Buckinghamshire, England, born 21 January 1602/03. Immigrated to Virginia Colony aboard the \"Charles\" in 1621 and arrived at Jamestown. The ship roster: \"Peeter Montecue, servant, age 21.\" He survived the attack by the Powhattan Indians on Jamestown in 1622. Peter is listed on the roster of Capt. Samuel Mathews men for 1624-1625. A tradition in the family tells that \"Peter was rather wild, that he ran away from home, went to America, and not being in funds had not the cash to pay for his passage and was sold for his passage money. The first half-day's work he did ruin his hands so that he had to rest. To pass the time he began to read his master's books, who caught him reading Latin, and soon obtained for him the position of a school teacher.\"\n\nMarried first in 1629 to ???, and second to Cicely Mathews, daughter of Governor Mathews, at James City, Virginia. Cicely survived the Jamestown Massacre in 1622 (as did Peter) by, as the story goes, standing firmly at her front door and refusing to move. The Powhatan Indians were impressed with her fortitude and beauty and let her live. That story seems a little far-fetched, but who knows? Soon after the Massacre, Samuel Jordan dropped dead, too. Now, this may seem too coincidental. One husband after another dies suddenly. Marrying Cicely may have seemed like a death sentence. But, in Jamestown death was common. [http://www.burningsettlerscabin.com/?tag=peter-montague]\n\nPeter patented 150 acres in New Norfolk in 1637, and obtained a land grant in Nansemond County in 1642. Two years later he patented another 150 acres in New Norfolk. Another 100 acres were added to his real estate in Nansimum County in 1647, and in 1658/9 another 400 acres in Lancaster County.\n\nSeveral years after the Indian massacre of 1644, Governor Berkeley opened the Northern Neck to settlers and at this time many of Peter's former neighbors moved up there.\n\nDuring the latter years of his life he entered Public service. During 1652-1653 Peter was a Burgess for Nansemond County, and 1656-1657, commissioner for Lancster County, and a year later represented the county at the House of Burgesses, during the same year of 1658, he was the sheriff for Lancaster County. In January 1659 he patented two parcels of land in that county south of the Rappahannock River.\n\nMany of the surname Montague resided in Middlesex County at Montague's Island. Montague was spelled Mountague in most records in Virginia until about 1700. Peter's Will is dated 27 March 1659, and proved on 25 May 1659, Lancaster County, Virginia:\n\nPeter Montague's Will - \"In the name of God amen, I Peter Montague being weak in body and perfect memory do make this my last will and testament, this the 27th of March 1659 in name and form following,\n\nFirst I bequeath my soul into the hands of my redeemer Jesus Christ, and my body to be buried.\n\nItem, my debts being first paid I give to my loving wife Cicely one third part of all my real and personal estate according to law.\n\nItem, I give to my two sons Peter and Will Mountague all my land lying on Rappahannock river to them and their heirs forever, and the land being divided it is my will, that the elder is to have the first choice, and in case of want of heirs of either, the survivor to enjoy all the land, and in case both of them shall depart this life without heirs, lawfully begotten, then my will is that the said land be sold by the commissioners of this county after public notice given either at an outcry, or by an inch of candle and the produce thereof to be equally divided between my three daughters Ellen, Margaret, and Elizabeth, and the child of Ann late wife of John Jadwin, and in case of any of these shall died without issue, then the produce of the said land to be divided between the survivors.\n\nItem, I give the other two thirds of my personal estate to my four children Peter, Will, Margaret, and Elizabeth to be equally divided among them.\n\nItem, I give to my daughter Ellen, the wife of Will Thompson, one thousand pounds of tobacco, and cask to be deducted, of a bill of thirteen hundred pounds of tobacco now due to me by the said Will Thompson. Lastly I ordain my loving wife cicely and my son Peter jointly Executrix and Executor of this my last will and testament. In witness of the previous I have hereunto set my hand and seal the day and year above written 1659 interlined before the signing and sealing therof. (Signed) Peter Mountague, (Ye seal)\"\n\nCicely was married a total of five times. First to Bailey, then to Samuel Jordan, third to William Farrar (d: 11 June 1637), fourth to to Peter Montague (d: 1659), and at age 59 she married Thomas Parker. Peter and ??? (???) Montague had three children.\n\n1. Peter Montague - Born c. 1629. Married 1st Mary Doodes Minor, daughter of Capt. Mein- dort Doodes Minor, a Dutch sea captain of Rot terdam, Holland; 2nd to Elizabeth Morris. He was executor of father's Will in 1659. Granted 1000 acres in December 1652.\n\n2. Ellen Montague - Married bef March 1659 to William Thompson (supposedly descends from William Brereton & Alice Corbet through their son William Brereton & Phillipa Hulse). (Please see Taylor family history.)\n\n3. Ann Montague - Married John Jadwin. She died before 27 March 1659. Her daughter mentioned in father's Will.\n\nPeter and Cicely (Mathews) Montague had three children.\n\n4. William Montague - Married & had a least two sons. Grandson William Montague married Hannah Ball, cousin of George Washington. He died 7 December 1713, Middlesex County, Virginia.\n\n5. Elizabeth Montague - Married Doodes Minor (brother of Mary Minor), another James Blaise Blaze/Blaydes, and married to Maurice Cocke (son of Richard Cocke & Temperance Bailey [who was Cecily Mathews son]).\n\n6. Margaret Montague - Married William Cheney.\n\nWhere Peter went, or what he did for the first two years after his arrival, no record has been found to say. In March 1622 the Indians had risen and killed 347 of the Virginia colonists; strife with the Indians, and the resultant dislocations, would continue for some time. Peter's name does not appear in the list of the \"Living and Dead in Virginia,\" taken on 16 February 1623.\n\n\"On the muster roll of the inhabitants of Virginia, taken on Feb. 4, 1624,\" Peter was \"on the muster roll of \"Capt. Samuell Mathews plantation, James cityy. Va.\" as \"Peter Montecue, age 21 years, came on the 'Charles' in 1621.\" . . . The pedigree preserved in the Heralds' College, London, places his [Peter's] name as the next older brother of Richard . . . Against his name on this pedigree in the Heralds' College was written, \"was in America 1634.\"\" - from \"History and Genealogy of the Montague Family of America\" by George W. Montague. Samuel Mathews would be Governor of the Colony in 1656.\n\nPeter probably married three times with his last wife being Cicely. Tradition says she was a daughter of Governor Mathews. That would not be unusual if Peter had been employed as a teacher for Mathews' children.\n\nThe State Land Registry Office of Virginia at Richmond had these entries,\n\n\"Peter Montague was granted, Aug. 22, 1637, 150 acres of Land in the upper county of New Norfolk.\" - from Book 1, p. 463\n\nPeter probably received this patent in consideration for having induced three persons to emigrate to Virginia. This land was located at the juncture of the Elizabeth River and Oystershell Necke creek - however, I haven't been able to identify this creek in modern Virginia. The upper county of New Norfolk consisted of what was later called Nansemond County. This is downriver from Jamestown, on the southern shore, towards present-day Norfolk. The present Norfolk and Princess Anne counties were called Lower Norfolk until 1691. Nansemond county was consolidated into the city of Suffolk in 1974.\n\n\"Feb. 25, 1638, in the same county, 50 acres.\" - from Book 1, p. 610\n\nThis was in the Lower Parish of what is now Isle of Wight County, on the west side of Tapsters Creek, alias Long Ponds. Isle of Wight county is on the other side of the James river from Jamestown.\n\n\"Dec. 18, 1645, in the same county, 150 acres.\" - from Book 2, p. 73\n\n\"Nov. 3, 1647, 100 acres, County Nansemond.\" - from Book 2, p. 130\n\nThis brought his total land holdings to 450 acres. This latter property was, after several sales, acquired by John Camble [Campbell?] on 29 Apr 1693.\n\n\"Peter Montegue, headright, re patent by William Ewan, Merchant, of 1400 acres in James City County 8 Jul 1648.\"\n\nPeter was a representative to the House of Burgesses for the County of Nansemond in 1652.\n\nThen, on 4 December 1652, Peter acquired 200 acres in Middlesex County from George Ludlow Esqr. This was an area to the north of Jamestown, on the south bank of the Rappahannock river. Lancaster county is across the river, though at the time I think Lancaster county was considered to cover both sides of the river.\n\nSometime before 1654 Peter moved his family to Lancaster county and made a home on the north bank of the Rappahannock river, probably not far from the present county seat of Lancaster. The family would live there for many generations to come. Peter probably had a wharf at the water's edge on his property where sea-going ships could load tobacco.\n\nPeter was the Commissioner for Lancaster county in 1656 and was a representative for the county in the House of Burgesses from 1657 to 1658. At some point he was also a Justice of the Peace, a post that a man of prominence would be expected to take.\n\nMr. Peter Montague patented 200 acres adjoining land of Oliver Segar on the south side of the Rappahannock River at the mouth of Sandy Point Creek running to the land of Mr. George Ludlow now in possession of said Montague. 16 Jan 1658. Four persons transpoted [Recall that under the VA headright system, you received 50 acres for each person you transported, so 4 x 50 = 200 acres]. \"Note: This patent hath a mistake in the recordinge which is rectified & recorded againe in folio 249. Thomas Brereton, C. Ct.\" Same date and virtually the same entry stating Lancaster [Middlesex] County. Land next to Randall Chamley and Oliver Segar. Recall that Middlesex County was formed in 1673 from old Lancaster County, i.e. the portion of old Lancaster on the south side of the Rappahannock River.\n\nCicely died in 1654 and Peter followed on 25 May 1658 [1659]. He was buried on the north bank of the Rappahannock, near his home in Lancaster county. His tombstone was standing as late as 1849, but much defaced by the hand of time. Peter's children were,\n\n(18) Ann Montague (1630), who married John Jadwin\n\n(18) Eleanor Montague (1632), who married William Thompson\n\n(18) Peter Montague (1634)\n\n(18) William Montague (1635)\n\n(18) Elizabeth Montague (1636)\n\n(18) Margaret Montague (1640)\n\n(18) Peter Montague (1634)\n\n(10) Richard Montacute (11) Edward Montague (1429) (12) Robert Montague (1455) (13) William Montague (1480) (14) Robert Montague (1505) (15) William Montague (1536-48) (16) Peter Montague (1580) (17) Peter Montague (1603)\n\nPeter was born in about 1634 in Nansemond County, Virginia. He married (1) Elizabeth Morris, (2) Mary Minor, and (3) Mary Doodes in November 1665. The latter was born in 1642. Note that Mary Minor and Mary Doodes were probably the same person, the daughter of Maindort Doodes and Mary Geret, see below.\n\nPeter Montague purchased 200 acres from Minor Doodes of Lancaster [Middlesex], mariner with consent of Mary Doodes on [20?] Nov 1665. Lancaster County. Recorded 1 Dec 1665. Montague of Lancaster, planter, then leased this land back to Minor Doodes sea captain for 54 years. 20 Nov 1665. Note--Maindort Doodes was a Dutch sea captain who, when he was naturalized, anglicized his and his wife's name to Doodes Minor and Mary Minor.\n\n1701--Peter Montague, the son of Peter Montague deceased, patented 1,000 acres Middlesex County upon Rappahannock River beginning on the south side of the mouth of Sandy Point Creek. This land adjoined 200 acres late of Randall Camblett on south side of the mouth of Pins Creek and below land of James Arrock. Granted George Ludlow Esqr., 22 May 1651, assigned and acknowledged before the Grand Assembly to said Peter, deceased, 4 Dec 1652, and recorded in the Book of Deeds of the Gen. Court No. 24 &c. now renewed by order. See above for the original purchase by Peter Montague Sr.\n\nPeter died in 1702 on Montague Island in Middlesex county [or 2 Dec 1695]. Montague island is a bit of land that juts out into the Rappahannock river. It is not really an island, separated as it is from the mainland only by a marsh. On it is the second oldest Montague home standing in America, built circa late 1700s by Col Philip Montague. It is officially on the books as dating from 1810. The last Montague property was sold at the death of William Latane Montague, in about 1838 - from \"House of Montague.\" Peter's children were,\n\n(19) Mary Montague (1665), who married Johnson, Thomas Paine, Colonel Joseph Ball\n\n(19) Peter Montague (1666)\n\n(19) William Montague (1670)\n\n(19) John Montague (1682)\n\n(19) Peter Montague (1666)\n\n(10) Richard Montacute (11) Edward Montague (1429) (12) Robert Montague (1455) (13) William Montague (1480) (14) Robert Montague (1505) (15) William Montague (1536-48) (16) Peter Montague (1580) (17) Peter Montague (1603) (18) Peter Montague (1634)\n\nHe was born in about 1666 in Middlesex county, Virginia. \"A grand-son of Peter Montague was granted Oct. 24 1702, 1000 acres in Middlesex County.\" - from \"History and Genealogy of the Montague Family in America\" by Geore W. Montague. He married Elizabeth Morris. She was born in about 1670 in Middlesex county, Virginia, the daughter of the Reverend Thomas Morris. Peter died in January 1702 [or 1693].

She later married John Freeman Rasin, and then Charles Gordon Allen. Her only child was Bessie Wallis.\n\n(26) Bessie Wallis Warfield (1896)\n\n(25) Teakle Wallis Warfield (c1865)\n\nShe was born Bessie Wallis Warfield on 19 June 1896 in Square Cottage at the Monterey Inn in Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania. She was the only child of Teackle Wallis Warfield and Alice Montague. She was named in honor of her father and her mother's sister, Mrs Bessie Buchanan Merryman, and was generally known as Wallis. Her father died of tuberculosis on shortly after her birth and for her first few years she was raised in Baltimore, Maryland, dependent upon the charity of a wealthy uncle, Solomon Warfield. In 1901, her aunt Bessie Merryman was widowed and Alice and Wallis moved into her large and comfortable house. Between 1912 and 1914 Solomon Warfield paid for Wallis to attend Oldfields School, the most expensive girls' school in Maryland.\n\nIn May 1916 Wallis met Earl Winfield Spencer, Jr., a U.S. Navy pilot, at Pensacola, Florida, while visiting her cousin. On 8 November 1916 the couple married. After the United States entered World War I in 1917, Spencer was posted to San Diego as the first commanding officer of a training base on North Island, in San Diego Bay. This is generally accepted as the official beginning of Naval Air Station North Island. The facility was completely undeveloped at this time, the island being little more then acres of flat scrub, though perfect for the aircrft of the time. The couple remained there until 1920, living in the adjacent community of Coronado. In 1921 the couple was posted to Washington, D.C. They were separated in 1923, when Spencer was posted to the Far East as commander of the Pampanga, Wallis remained behind. In January 1924 she visited Paris with her recently widowed cousin Corinne Mustin, before sailing to the Far East. The couple divorced on 10 December 1927.\n\nBy the time her marriage to Spencer was dissolved, Wallis was already involved with Ernest Aldrich Simpson, a shipping executive and former captain in the Coldstream Guards. He divorced his first wife to marry Wallis Spencer on 21 July 1928 in Chelsea, London. The Simpsons temporarily set up home in a furnished house in Mayfair. In 1929, Wallis sailed back to the United States to visit her sick mother, who died on 2 November 1929. Wallis returned to England and the Simpsons moved into a larger flat.\n\nShe married Edward VIII, then Duke of Windsor, in 1937. The rest of her story is too well known to repeat here. The Duchess died on 24 April 1986 in Paris and was buried at Frogmore, Windsor.\n\n(22) Rice Daniel Montague (1756)\n\n(10) Richard Montacute (11) Edward Montague (1429) (12) Robert Montague (1455) (13) William Montague (1480) (14) Robert Montague (1505) (15) William Montague (1536-48) (16) Peter Montague (1580) (17) Peter Montague (1603) (18) Peter Montague (1634) (19) Peter Montague (1666) (20) Thomas Montague (1694) (21) Thomas Montague (1719) (22) Peter Montague (1758)\n\n(10) Richard Montacute (11) Edward Montague (1429) (12) Robert Montague (1455) (13) William Montague (1480) (14) Robert Montague (1505) (15) William Montague (1536-48) (16) Peter Montague (1580) (17) Peter Montague (1603) (18) Peter Montague (1634) (19) Peter Montague (1666) (20) Thomas Montague (1694) (21) Thomas Montague (1719) (22) Mickelborough Montague (1766)\n\n(10) Richard Montacute (11) Edward Montague (1429) (12) Robert Montague (1455) (13) William Montague (1480) (14) Robert Montague (1505) (15) William Montague (1536-48) (16) Peter Montague (1580) (17) Peter Montague (1603) (18) Peter Montague (1634) (19) Peter Montague (1666) (20) Thomas Montague (1694) (21) Thomas Montague (1719) (22) William Montague (1776)\n\n(10) Richard Montacute (11) Edward Montague (1429) (12) Robert Montague (1455) (13) William Montague (1480) (14) Robert Montague (1505) (15) William Montague (1536-48) (16) Peter Montague (1580) (17) Peter Montague (1603) (18) Peter Montague (1634) (19) Peter Montague (1666) (20) Thomas Montague (1694) (21) Thomas Montague (1719) (21) John Montague (1721)\n\n(10) Richard Montacute (11) Edward Montague (1429) (12) Robert Montague (1455) (13) William Montague (1480) (14) Robert Montague (1505) (15) William Montague (1536-48) (16) Peter Montague (1580) (17) Peter Montague (1603) (18) Peter Montague (1634) (19) Peter Montague (1666) (20) Thomas Montague (1694)\n\nBorn on 23 November 1721.\n\n(21) Clement Montague (1723)\n\n(10) Richard Montacute (11) Edward Montague (1429) (12) Robert Montague (1455) (13) William Montague (1480) (14) Robert Montague (1505) (15) William Montague (1536-48) (16) Peter Montague (1580) (17) Peter Montague (1603) (18) Peter Montague (1634) (19) Peter Montague (1666) (20) Thomas Montague (1694)\n\nBorn 29 December 1723 in Christchurch.

He was graduated at the University of Virginia in 1875 and in the same year went to Columbian College (now George Washington University), Washington, D.C., as an instructor in Latin and graduate student, obtaining the degrees of A.M. in 1879 and a Ph.D. in 1888. While in Washington he tutored in Latin the two sons of President Garfield, James R. and Harry A. Garfield. He was made professor of Latin at Columbian College in 1879 and became dean of the college in 1895. Two years later he was called to the presidency of Furman University, South Carolina, remaining there for five years. During his administration he was instrumental in erecting a new dormitory, Montague hall, named in honor of his mother, and the Judson Alumni hall was constructed. He also established the Furman fitting school, housed in its own building, in 1900, secured the abolition of co-education, emphasized the teaching of pedagogy, added to the endowment funds of the university and brought about a marked increase in administrative efficiency. Resigning the position in 1902 he spent ten fruitful years as president of Howard College, Birmingham, Alabama. Among the chief accomplishments of his administration there were the building of Renfroe hall and Montague hall (named in honor of his first wife), the raising of the curriculum to the fourteen \"Carnegie units\" standard, an increase of 75 percent in the student enrollment, the raising of a $100,000 endowment (the first the college had) and the popularizing of the college and denominational education in general by public speeches and through the press of the state.\n\nDuring 1912-19 he was president of Columbia College, Lake City, Florida, and from there went to Mercer University, Macon, Georgia, as professor of Latin and public speaking, also becoming dean in 1923, vice-president in 1924, (the office being especially created for him), and acting president in 1927, holding the last position until June 1928.\n\nAs a Latin scholar and classicist Montague had few equals in the South and he was editor of \"Selected Letters of Cicero\" (1890) and \"Selected Letters of Pliny\" (1893). Richmond College awarded him a LL.D. degree in 1896. He was a member of the American Philological Association, American Anthropological Society, Florida Educational Association (president, 1915) and the Cosmos Club, Washington, D.C. While in Birmingham, Alabama, he was licensed to preach in the Baptist Church. Montague possessed indomitable energy and enthusiasm and strong personal magnetism and his distinctive qualities of courtesy, patience, gentleness and loyalty, his cultivated mind, chivalrous nature, and high ideals left their mark upon all who came under his influence.\n\nHe was married twice: (1) in Richmond, Virginia, November 3, 1881, to May, daughter of Judge Joseph Christian, of that city; she died in 1906, leaving two children: Maude, wife of Col. Meyrich Benjamin Hawkins, and Howard Christian Montague; (2) in Birmingham, Alabama, May 8, 1907, to Florence, daughter of Henry Wood, of that city.

He ran as an Independent for Governor and won. A Progressive, he was Governor of Virginia from 1902 to 1906. As Attorney General participated in writing a new Virginian constitution. He proclaimed the new constitution the first year he was governor and called the general assembly to make the statute laws conform to the new constitution. A progressive of the times, he pressed for regulation of companies and railroads, prison reform, highway improvements, and for direct primaries and direct election of Senators. Direct elections were seen as the means of eliminating the corrupting influence of lobbyists on political `machines' that then delivered the vote. He led a campaign in 1905 to institute public schools.\n\nHe ran against Martin for the U.S. Senate in 1906 and was defeated by the Martin machine. Afterwards, he was the U.S. delegate to Pan-American Conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1906 and to the Third International Conference on Maritime Law in Brussels, which lasted from 1909 to 1910. He led the Virginia faction supporting Woodrow Wilson at the Democratic National Convention, 1912.\n\nHe was finally elected to Congress in 1912, representing the 63 district of Virginia, and served for 12 terms, until his death in 1937. Served on the judiciary committee for much of his service in the House; played a large role in creating the Federal Trade Commission and the National Bankruptcy Act; conducted an impeachment against a U.S. district court judge; obtained a Federal Reserve Bank for Richmond, the Seven Days Battlefield park, and the National Monuments at Yorktown, Williamsburg, and Jamestown. He was a strong opponent of Prohibition, but voted for the Amendment.\n\nHe was president of the American Society for Judicial Settlement of International Disputes from 1920 to 1924, an executive in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, president of the American Peace Society, from 1920 to 1924, on the executive committee of the American Institute of Law and served for 3 years as Dean of University of Richmond law school. He wrote \"The Life of John Marshall, Secretary of State.\" Montague was also president of the American Peace Society from 1920 to 1924. Oddly in light of this, his daughter Gay sponsored the launching of the USS VIRGINIA, BB-13, in 1904.\n\nHe died in 1937.\n\n(25) Robert Lynch Montague (1864)\n\n(10) Richard Montacute (11) Edward Montague (1429) (12) Robert Montague (1455) (13) William Montague (1480) (14) Robert Montague (1505) (15) William Montague (1536-48) (16) Peter Montague (1580) (17) Peter Montague (1603) (18) Peter Montague (1634) (19) William Montague (1670) (20) Abraham Montague (1701) (21) Lewis Montague (1725) (22) Lewis Montague (1759) (23) Lewis Brook Montague (1793) (24) Robert Latane Montague (1818)\n\nBorn on 4 September 1864 in Mount Prospect.\n\n(24) John Adolphus Montague (1821)\n\n(10) Richard Montacute (11) Edward Montague (1429) (12) Robert Montague (1455) (13) William Montague (1480) (14) Robert Montague (1505) (15) William Montague (1536-48) (16) Peter Montague (1580) (17) Peter Montague (1603) (18) Peter Montague (1634) (19) William Montague (1670) (20) Abraham Montague (1701) (21) Lewis Montague (1725) (22) Lewis Montague (1759) (23) Lewis Brook Montague (1793)\n\nBorn on 12 June 1821 in Middlesex county.

Also known as Great Christ Church Parish. There is reference in 1686 section of the Register to a MONTAGUES ISLAND, VA. THOMAS MONTAGUE, Sr., a large plantation / slaveholder, many of his slave infants were bap'd at Christ Church (further pronounced his wealth) (sorry, I did not write these names down) WILLIAM MONTAGUE also a large plantation / slaveholder At this time most planters had servants and plantation workers from Barbados. RESEARCH SUMMARY: The WHITE, MONTAGUE and PACE family lines were living in Christ Church Parish around the same time, circa 1696. They were all planters, probably tobacco. Dates from Christ Church Parish list above lists a marriage of a MONTAGUE there as early as 1682, and a birth as early as 1702. I delved into researching the MONTAGUEs as many Ancestry Trees connecting to the early WHITEs of this region of VA claims JOHN WHITE (son of JOHN WHITE, bap'd May 30, 1697, Christ Church Parish) married twice, one to an ELIZABETH MONTAGUE, and again to an ELIZABETH (PACE). Yet my research proves JOHN WHITE married only once, on Oct.24, 1717 in Christ Church, ELIZABETH (MONTAGUE) (PACE), widow of JOHN PACE (a tobacco planter, who died young in 1734, in Christ Church (and their son, Abraham Pace, died as an infant around the same time as his father). John White and Elizabeth would have raised the remaining children of Elizabeth and John Pace (being William Pace, John Pace, and Mary Pace), plus they went on to have children of their own. It is through this JOHN WHITE & ELIZABETH MONTAGUE (PACE) WHITE that my husband's family descends. This Elizabeth Montague, b.bef.1701, was daughter of WILLIAM and LETTICE (early spelling of Letitia) LEDFORD (WEEKS) MONTAGUE. Her birth/baptismal is not listed in Christ Church Parish, but they would have removed to Christ Church by or before 1701 when their son Abraham was baptized there. JOHN PACE, Jr. was son of JOHN PACE, Sr. and ELIZABETH (NEDERSOME? / NEWSOME?) PACE. (Newsome was first name given to one of their sons) John Pace Jr.'s birth bef.1694 is not noted on Christ Church Register, meaning he was born prior to their arrival there from where?. By 1694, and after, per the above records, John and Elizabeth Pace Sr. had children baptized in Christ Church: SARAH PACE, (dau of John & Elizabeth Pace, bap.d April 22, 1694) GEORGE PACE, (son of John & Elizabeth Pace, bap.d Mar, 15, 1701) JANE PACE, (dau of John & Elizabeth Pace, bap'd Sept. 22, 1706) NEWSOME PACE, (son of John & Elizabeth Pace, bap'd Feb. 6, 1708) GEORGE PACE, (son of John & Elizabeth Pace, bap'd Jan, 16, 1715) Hope there is something new for you here, and that the MONTAGUE's listed here jive with what you have. FYI: I'm also looking into other county Parish Registers (i.e. Essex Cty., Amelia Cty., etc.) for more information on WHITE and will forward anything I find on MONTAGUE.\n\n--Annette Markward, Austin, TX a.markward@yahoo.com"
