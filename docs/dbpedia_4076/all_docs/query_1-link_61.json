        "text": "Networking is an essential part of a student’s career development process. One of the goals of the Passage program is to help students grow and manage a network of professionals in their primary career field. However, for students to develop a network and gain real-world experience, they will need professionals and volunteers who are willing to share their insights, advice and first-hand experience.\n\nFHU is extremely blessed to have an active alumni base throughout various career fields and professional communities around the world. These former Lions, as well as other friends of the University, will work within Passage to provide students with experience and first-hand knowledge about their chosen major and professional path. The individuals listed below, known in the Passage program as External Career Influencers, have made themselves available to students for advice, interviews, and the development of mentoring relationships. Connecting with our alumni network and with individuals in a similar career field will help further prepare students for life after FHU and will reinforce the University’s mission… to help students develop their God-given talents for His glory.\n\nYou are invited to serve the next generation of FHU students in our new program…FHU Passage! Passage focuses on career exploration for Freshman students at FHU. These students will spend their first two years learning about their career interests, how to set career goals, and how to develop a professional network. Students will be asked to gather advice and conduct professional experiences in various career fields. We are building a list of professionals for our students to connect with, and hope that you’ll consider sharing your experiences, advice, wisdom, and skills with the next generation of FHU Lions! If you’re interested, please complete the form below."
