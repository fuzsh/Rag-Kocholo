Edward Nathan\n\nThe energy and intellectual activity that is a marked peculiarity of the Jewish race is clearly seen in the Rev. Edward Nathan Calisch, of Richmond, Virginia. He holds a responsible position, and shows the versatility of his talents, wielding at the same time a wide-spread influence. The place he has achieved is the result of an ambition which, even as a boy, drove him to work patiently and untiringly towards the aims which he had set for himself. The success which has crowned his efforts and placed him in a position of respect and esteem may justly be said to be mainly due to himself and his own ability and unflagging energy. He comes of a family of brainworkers. An uncle, N. S. Calisch, who was the editor of the \"Amsterdamischer Courant\" was an author and lexicographer, and compiled a standard English-Dutch and Dutch-English dictionary. A great-uncle, Morris Calisch, was an artist and poet.\n\nHenry Calisch, father of the Rev. Edward N. Calisch, was born in Amsterdam, Holland, in 1832, and came to America in the fifties. He was a teacher by occupation, and noted for his literary and linguistic ability. He died about 1875, his death being caused by exposure suffered at the time of the great Chicago fire of 1871, at which time he was living in Chicago with his family. Later he returned to Toledo, Ohio, the city in which he had been living. He married Rebecca Van Norden, born in Rotterdam, Holland, in 1846, died in America in 1900. They had children: Solomon H., a resident of Toledo, Ohio; Edward Nathan, of this sketch; Frances H., unmarried, lives with her brother, the rabbi, and is a trained nurse by profession.\n\nRev. Edward Nathan Calisch was born in Toledo, Ohio, June 23, 1865. After the disaster of the Chicago fire, and the family had returned to Toledo, he attended local schools there, and when his father died, at which time he was ten years of age, he worked as a cash boy for a time with Mandel Brothers of Chicago. He then attended in succession the following institutions of learning: Hebrew Union College, which conferred upon him his degree as rabbi in 1887; University of Cincinnati, Bachelor of Laws in 1887; University of Virginia, Master of Arts in 1905, and Doctor of Philosophy in 1908. He commenced his active working life prior to his graduation, as a teacher in the Sabbath schools in Cincinnati, Ohio, and in Lexington, Kentucky. After his graduation in August, 1887, he was appointed as rabbi of a congregation in Peoria, Illinois. He remained in charge of his congregation in Peoria until 1891, in which year he was called to the congregation in Richmond, Virginia, with which he has since that time been identified. He is a prominent figure in all movements which have for their object the betterment of existing conditions, and is well known as a speaker, fluent and influential, in civic causes, city government, reform movements, etc. Since 1910 he has served as vice-president of the Richmond branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; he is a member of the board of governors of the Wednesday Club; in 1914 was appointed a member of the Vice Commission of the City of Richmond. The congregation, Beth Ahabah, of which he is the spiritual head, has gained largely in every direction under his guidance. His fraternal affiliations is [sic] as follows: Jefferson Club; Blue Lodge, Chapter, Scottish Rite, and Shrine of the Masonic order; Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks; member of the executive committe [sic] of the Independent Order of B'nai Brith, an international fraternal organization; chaplain of the Blue Lodge and has been high priest of the chapter. In political matters. Rev. Calisch holds independent opinions, although he casts his vote for the Democratic candidates in city and state elections. He has at times changed his party allegiance, for reasons based upon the characters of the various candidates. All his life he has been a great lover of outdoor sports, and still finds great recreation in tennis, swimming, rowing and camp life.\n\nIn the world of literature Rev. Calisch has earned wide commendation. From his facile pen have appeared poems, articles on many subjects, in magazines and the daily press, but he has worked in a wider and deeper field. He is the author of \"A Child's Bible,\" which was published in 1889; \"The Book of Prayer,\" 1893; \"The Jew in English Literature,\" 1909, which deals with what has been accomplished by the Jew in this field during the past century; \"Methods of Teaching Bible History,\" volume I, published in 1913, volume II, in 1914. In addition, he has collaborated in the production of the Jewish Encyclopaedia, and in a memorial edition of the writings of Thomas Jefferson.\n\nRev. Calisch married, January 22, 1890, Gisela, a daughter of Abraham and Lena Woolner, and of their five children, Harold Edward, is studying architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, a member of the class of 1915; A. Woolner, is engaged in the real estate business; Edward N., the second of the name, is still at school. Rev. Calisch was asked what suggestion he had to make regarding the future training of young Americans of the present generation. He replied that into the minds of the young there should be instilled a greater sense of reverence, more respect for the authority of parents, teachers, and all those holding high positions in the state and country-at-large.

(Source: Biographical Directory of the US Congress 1774-Present)\n\nCarson, Joseph Preston\n\nA great deal of interest attaches itself to each of the four American generations of this family, represented in legal and business circles in Richmond, Virginia, by Joseph Preston Carson, no small part of which is in the fact that each of the direct line leading from the immigrant ancestor, Joseph Carson, to Joseph Preston Carson, has been indentified with the professions, three with the law and one with the ministry. Joseph Carson, who founded his line in Virginia, was a native of Ireland, and was a prominent lawyer of his period.\n\n(II) Judge Joseph S. Carson, son of Joseph Carson and grandfather of Joseph Preston Carson, was born in Winchester, Frederick county, Virginia, and there died in 1870. The law was the calling he adopted early in life, his career as an attorney a successful one, and at his death he was judge of the county court sitting at Winchester. Judge Carson was connected with the confederate service during the civil war, although at the opening of it past the age when he might serve as a soldier in the ranks.\n\n(III) Rev. Dr. Theodore M. Carson, the eldest son of Judge Joseph S. Carson, was born in Winchester, Frederick county, Virginia, in 1834, died in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1904. He was an M. A. of Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and after his ordination into the ministry spent the first four years as chaplain in the army of the Confederacy. At the close of the war, and after several previous charges, he was for thirty-three years rector of St. Paul's Church, at Lynchburg, Virginia, where he attained high position in the church, and at his death was president of the standing committee of the Diocese of Southern Virginia, also dean of the Convocation of Southern Virginia. Rev. Dr. Carson was a scholar of broad culture, a preacher of intense inspiration, and a minister of measureless sympathy, and during the years of his life, passed in such faithful devotion to the cause he had espoused, he became the instrument of infinite good in the service of the Master. He married, in 1860, Victoria Ellen, daughter of William and Ann (Waters) Allison. William Allison was a member of an old Irish family, born in Ireland, and after coming to Virginia made his home in Richmond. His wife was a native of Maryland, and they were the parents of a family of thirteen children, the eldest, James head of the firm of Allison & Allison, the youngest Victoria Ellen, of previous mention, married Rev. Theodore M. Carson. Children of Rev. Dr. and Victoria Ellen (Allison) Carson are: Joseph Preston, of whom further; Maud Lee, born in 1866, married Professor W. M. Lile, dean of the law department of the University of Virginia.\n\n(IV) Joseph Preston Carson, son of Rev. Dr. Theodore M. and Victoria Ellen (Allison) Carson, was born at the Preston homestead, \"Solitude,\" Montgomery county, Virginia, August 2, 1862. His youthful education was obtained in the schools of Winchester and Lynchburg, and after a course in the Episcopal High School at Alexandria, he matriculated at the University of Virginia, being in the class of 1882. Soon after graduation he became an analytical chemist with the firm of Allison & Allison, in 1883 taking up residence in Richmond, where he has since remained. For ten years he was associated with the previously mentioned firm, during that time pursuing legal studies at the University of Virginia, and in 1887 gained admission to the bar. He has made steady advances in his profession and now occupies a responsible position in legal circles, but has not confined his labors to this field, being at this writing connected with several large business interests, and president of a widely extended company of manufacturing chemists, in Richmond. With the responsibility of the affairs of this latter company and the exactions of his law practice, Mr. Carson's existence is a busy one, a fact that detracts little from his enjoyment, for he is of vigorous nature, finding in close application to his business an agreeable satisfaction that comes only with labor well done and duty thoroughly performed.\n\nMr. Carson, although he has never sought or held political office, is a staunch Democrat in both state and national politics. While a member of many of the social organizations of Richmond, his recreations are sought in outdoor pleasures, and he is a director in several hunting and fishing clubs in the state. Mr. Carson is a Royal Arch Mason, belonging to Lodge and Chapter, and is a vestryman of the Protestant Episcopal church. His residence is the handsome estate of \"Dundee,\" Chesterfield county, Virginia.\n\nHe married, in Richmond, Virginia, April 18, 1900, Catherine Valentine, born in Richmond, Virginia, December 17, 1873, daughter J. J. Montague, her father a native of Prince Anne county, Virginia. He also was a soldier in the Confederate States army, serving during the entire war, and is now vice-president of the Planters' National Bank of Richmond. Mr. Montague married Catherine Warren, a native of Virginia, who died in 1909. Children of Joseph Preston and Catherine Valentine (Montague) Carson are: Theodore Montague, born February 10, 1901, now a student in Richmond Academy; Catherine Warren, born May 24, 1903; Joseph Preston Jr., born April 1, 1905.

His mother was SarahE. S., daughter of Major James Baytop, of Gloucester County, Virginia, born September 18, 1789, died in April, 1879. He was educated at Hampton Academy, and at William and Mary College, graduating from that time honored institution July 4, 1839. For five years he taught school, then was seventeen years principal of Hampton Academy, which was disbanded April, 1861, on the secession of the State of Virginia. He entered the Confederate States' service as Major of Virginia Volunteers; was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel after the fight at Bethel, and assigned to the 32nd Virginia Regiment; was subsequently appointed Assistant Adjutant and Inspector-General at the request of Gen. JohnB. Magruder, and assigned to duty on his staff, serving through the Peninsular Campaign, and the Seven Days' Fights around Richmond. After Gen. Magruder's transfer to the Trans-Mississippi Department, Col. Cary was transferred to the Paymaster's Department, in which he served until the close of the war, on duty in Richmond. After the evacuation of Richmond, and the surrender at Appomatox C. H., he returned to Richmond, and was paroled April 24, 1865. He farmed for one year: then in February, 1866, was elected General Agent of the Virginia Penitentiary. He went into business also, as general commission merchant, with the lute W. A. Armistead, of the firm of Armistead, Rice Cary & Co., later Armistead & Cary.\n\nColonel Cary was removed from his official position by the Commander of Military District No. 1, December 24, 1868. In January, 1869, he entered the Insurance business as General Agent of the Piedmont Life Insurance Co.: after a few months, he went to New York, as a member of the firm of Morriss & Cary, but soon accepted an appointment as General Agent of the Piedmont and Arlington Life Insurance Co., serving as such nearly two years. He was then for several years associated with Gen. Harry Heth, as General Agent and Manager of the Virginia Department of the Life Association of America, of which he subsequently became sole manager, resigning this position at the close of 1887. In January, 1878, he was appointed General Agent for Virginia of the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., of Milwaukee; and in 1883, with his son (T. A. Cary,) under the firm name of John B. Cary & Son, was appointed to the position they still hold as General Agents of this Company for Virginia and North Carolina.\n\nColonel Gary served as Treasurer and Superintendent of the Democratic City Committee, of Richmond, Virginia, for about six years, to July, 1886, when he was appointed Superintendent of Schools for the City of Richmond, which position he resigned in February, 1889. Himself and family are members of the Seventh Street Christian Church, Richmond.\n\nAt Seaford, Matthews County, Virginia, in January, 1844, he married Columbia H. Hudgins, of that county.

White, of Caroline county, Virginia; Sallie Campbell, married Louis P. Knowles, of Pensacola, Florida; T. Archibald, married Maria B. Abert, of Columbus, Mississippi. [History of Virginia From Settlement of Jamestown to Close of The Civil War by Robert Alonzo Brock and Virgil Anson Lewis, 1888 - Transcribed by AFOFG]\n\nCary, Wilson Miles\n\nThe fact of birth in the state of Mississippi makes Wilson Miles Cary, of Richmond, Virginia, not one degree less a Virginian than had his birthplace been in this state, for his entire life has been passed here, he having been brought to Virginia by his widowed mother, an infant in arms, and for nearly two and three-quarters centuries his family has here resided. His grandfather, Colonel Miles Cary, journeyed with his family to the southwest, and there remained, Lucius Falkland Cary, father of Wilson Miles Cary, the only one of his sons to return to the ancient home, Virginia.\n\nThe Carys, a family prominent in Virginia colonial history, are descended from the ancient Devonshire family of Cary, of which collateral branches have been conspicuous in England as Earls of Hunsdon, Monmouth, and Dover, and as Barons of Falkland. Branches are still seated at Tor Abbey and Follaton. The earliest mention of the name is in the case of Adam De Kari, who in 1198 is mentioned as Lord of Castle Cary, in Somerset county, whither he probably migrated from Devon, who married Amy, daughter of Sir William Trewit, Knight. The Devonshire Heralds Visitation of 1620 gives fourteen generations of his descendants. His grandson's grandson was Sir John Carve, Knight, chief baron of exchequer in the reign of King Henry IV, who was banished into Ireland for political offences [sic]. Prior to his time the spelling of the name De Kari seems to have prevailed. His son, Sir Robert Carye, was a favorite of King Henry V, and the following anecdote is cited in explanation of the return of the family to royal favor. \"In his time came out of Aragon a lusty gentleman into England, and challenged to do feites of arms with any English gentleman, without exception. This Robert Cary, hearing thereof, made suit forthwith to the Prince that he might answer the challenge * * * * At the time and the day prefix'd both parties met, and did perform sundrie feites of arms, but in the end this Robert gave the foils and overthrow to the Aragon Kt., disarmed and spoiled him, which his doinge so well pleased the Prince that he received him into great favor, caused him to be restored to the most part of his father's lands and willed him also for a perpetual memorie of his victorie that he should thenceforth give the same arms as did the Aragon Kt., which both he and his successors to this day enjoyed, which is: Argent, on bend sable three roses argent, for before they did bear: Gules, Chevron, entre three swans argent.\"\n\nThe arms of the Carys of Bristol and of Virginia were identical with those of Sir Robert Cary, of Devon, above referred to. There is a tradition in Virginia that Sir Henry Cary, Knight, a royalist leader, who went into exile after the defeat of Charles I, came to Virginia and left posterity, and some of the descendants of Miles have claimed descent from him.\n\nDescended from Adam De Kari, perhaps in the tenth generation, was William Cary, born about 1500, mayor of Bristol, 1546, died 1572. His son, Richard, a merchant of Bristol, born 1525, died 1570, had a son William, born 1550, died 1632, who was, like his grandfather, mayor of Bristol in 1611. William Cary, by his marriage with Alice Goodall, had seven sons, the third of whom, John, born in 1583, died in 1662, a draper of Bristol, married Alice Hobson and was the father of Colonel Miles Cary, propositus of the Carys of Virginia. The seventh son of William and Alice (Goodall) Cary, James, born in 1600, died in 1681, came to Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1639, and was the ancestor of the Massachusetts family of Cary, Richard Cary, aide-de-camp to General Washington, and Mrs. Agassiz being members of this branch.\n\nHe whom the branch of the family to which Wilson Miles Cary, of Richmond, belongs, has as an American ancestor, Colonel Miles Cary, born in Bristol, England, in 1620, died in 1667. He came to Virginia in 1640-46, and settled in Warwick county, where he married Anne, daughter of Thomas Taylor Hobson, one of the early settlers. He acquired and resided upon the estate known as \"Magpie Swamps,\" obtained by his father-in-law, Captain Hobson, which he devised to his eldest son, Thomas. He was a member of the King's council, burgess, escheater general, and owned nearly two thousand acres of land, well stocked, and numerous slaves, besides a store and mill. He mentioned in his will two houses in England, presumably in Bristol, one in Ballaum, the other in St. Nicholas street, to be sold for the benefit of his daughters. He had seven children, four sons and three daughters, the line descending through Colonel Miles (2) Cary. Colonel Miles (2) Cary was royal naval officer of York river, burgess, surveyor general, and rector and trustee of William and Mary College. He married Mary Wilson; his son, Colonel Wilson Miles Cary, married Sarah Blair; his son, Major Wilson Cary, married Jane B. Carr; his son, Colonel Miles Cary, of \"Oak Hill,\" Fluvanna county, Virginia, married Elizabeth Searsbrooke Wilson Curle, his entire branch of the family moving to the southwest, with the exception of Lucius Falkland Cary, his son, who returned to Virginia.\n\nLucius Falkland Cary, son of Colonel Miles Cary, and member of the seventh American generation of his line, was born at \"Oak Hill,\" Fluvanna county, Virginia, December 14, 1815, and in Virginia passed his active years, his death occurring in 1845, at the early age of thirty years. He became a merchant of Williamsburg, founded an important mercantile establishment, and was one of the most influential citizens and business men of the city, the business of which he was the owner being the largest of Williamsburg. Lucius F. Cary married Lucy Ann Henley, born in Williamsburg, died in Richmond, Virginia, aged eighty-three years, and had two children: Hattie, married William Christian, deceased, and resides in Richmond, and Wilson Miles, of whom further.\n\nWilson Miles Cary, son of Lucius Falkland and Lucy Ann (Henley) Cary, was born in De Soto county, Mississippi, October 7, 1843, although the family home was in Williamsburg. Not long after his birth his mother returned to Williamsburg, and his academic education was obtained in William and Mary College at that place. Here he was a student when the war between the states broke out, and enlisting in Company C, Thirty-second Regiment of Virginia Infantry, served until the Appomattox surrender, his war record one of honorable and valiant service. At the close of the war he returned to William and Mary College to complete his course, and before his graduation received an appointment as civil engineer in a party engaged in surveying and platting the city of Newport News, and the location of the Richmond & Newport News Railroad. When this task was finished Mr. Cary began mercantile dealings in the city of Richmond, and for thirty-eight years was a well-known and highly-rated merchant of that city. His business was flourishing and profitable, but so extensive as to make demands upon him that gradually weakened his health, a condition that caused his retirement when he was about to enter upon his fifth decade of continuous connection with the Richmond world of trade. Although he has greatly lessened his activities, Mr. Cary retains interests in numerous of the city's institutions, and among them is his presidency of the Buchanan Coal and Coke Company, Incorporated. He is a citizen of high standing in all circles, and is a communicant of the Presbyterian church. Mr. Cary is serving as deacon in the Second Presbyterian Church. Mr. Cary is a long-time member of the Westmoreland Club.\n\nWilson Miles Cary married (first) Anne E. Sublett, born in 1846, died in 1875, and had issue, Hunsdon, an attorney of Richmond, and Emily, married Thomas Marshall Jr., of Fauquier county, Virginia, now a resident of Richmond. He married (second) Lilias Blair, daughter of John B. McPhail, born at Mulberry Hill, Charlotte county, Virginia, and has children: Lucius Falkland and Lilias Blair, lives at home, unmarried. John B. McPhail was a native of Virginia, and as a soldier of the home guard participated in the action of the civil war, at Staunton River Bridge, in the region of his home. He married Nannie, daughter of Colonel Clement Carrington, of revolutionary fame, and granddaughter of the noted Judge Paul Carrington. (Source: Encyclopedia of Virginia Biographies - Vol. IV.

D.\n\nThe year 1900 witnessed the beginning of the present connection between Dr. Russell Cecil and the Second Presbyterian Church of Richmond. Dr. Cecil, a scion of an old Pulaski county, Virginia, family, but a native of Kentucky, obtained both his classical and theological training at Princeton, the former in the university, the latter in the seminary, and from the time of his ordination into the ministry of the Presbyterian church until 1900 Kentucky and Alabama were his fields of endeavor. The past fifteen years he has passed as pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church of Richmond, and here his ministry has been rewarded with abundant fruits. A fine and willing spirit exists in the congregation, their co-operation with the plans and labors of Dr. Cecil is all that could be desired, and under his capable and enthusiastic leadership the church has become a powerful instrument for good in the city, its activities finding outlet through its numerous internal organizations.\n\n(I) Dr. Cecil is a grandson of Zachariah W. Cecil, born and died in Pulaski county, Virginia, where he passed all his active years in farming. He married Julia, daughter of Major Daniel Howe, a prominent citizen of Pulaski county, sister of the mother of Governor Hoge Tyler, and hail children, all deceased: Russell Howe, of whom further; Giles, Zachariah, Daniel R., Julia.\n\n(II) Russell Howe Cecil, son of Zachariah W. and Julia (Howe) Cecil, was born in Pulaski county, Virginia, October 27, 1815, and died at Harrodsburg, Mercer county, Kentucky, April 27, 1890. In his early life he was a merchant, later retiring to a farm in Kentucky. He married Lucy Ann Phillips, of Monticello, Kentucky, and had seven children, of whom four are living at this time; Micajah Howe; Russell, of whom further; John Giles, a prominent and noted physician of Louisville, Kentucky, died in that place; Julia, married Dr. J. M. Dalton, deceased, of Harrodsburg, Kentucky; Sue Ellen, married R. S. Bohon, of Decatur.,Illinois; and two who died in infancy.\n\n(III) Dr. Russell Cecil, son of Russell Howe and Lucy Ann (Phillips) Cecil, was born in Monticello, Wayne county, Kentucky, October 1, 1853, and when he was five years of age his parents moved to Mercer county, Kentucky, where from the age of five to seventeen years he attended school. After thorough preparatory study he matriculated at Princeton University and was graduated in 1874, teaching school for one year before returning to Princeton to take up theological studies in the seminary. These he completed in 1878, and his first charge after his ordination was at Nicholasville, Kentucky, where he remained for six years, afterward serving the Central Presbyterian Church at Maysville, Kentucky, for three and one-half years. In 1889 he was elected pastor of the Presbyterian church at Selma, Alabama, which he served for eleven and one-half years, then accepted a call to the Second Presbyterian Church, of Richmond, where he has since been pastor. The relation is of the pleasantest and both pastor and people recall vividly and with pleasure the close communion and the mutual inspiration of the past fifteen years. Dr. Cecil holds a place in the hearts of his congregation that will never be granted to another, and together they have labored with result for the extension of the Kingdom. Dr. Cecil has been honored with several positions of importance by his church. Before coming to Virginia, he was president of the board of directors of the Columbia Theological Seminary, of South Carolina, 1898-1900. During the years 1911-12 he was moderator of the East Hanover Presbytery, of the synod of Virginia, and of the general assembly of the Presbyterian church in the United States, holding all three offices at the same time, a unique experience in the history of the Presbyterian church. At the present time (1915) he is a member of the council of the Reformed churches in America holding the Presbyterian system; and also a member of the executive committee of the council of the federation of Protestant churches in America. He will also represent the Presbyterian church of the United States in the world conference on faith and order. The degree of D. D. has been conferred upon him by his alma mater, Princeton University, and also Southwestern Presbyterian University, of Clarksville, Tennessee.\n\nDr. Russell Cecil married, in New York City, January 19, 1881, Alma Miller, born in Richmond, Kentucky, September 2, 1858, daughter of Dr. Lafayette and Carrie (Embry) Miller, both deceased.

Her mother, Miss Macmurdo, was the granddaughter of Bishop Moore, of Virginia, and from her and the grandmother Mrs. Chanler inherits the beauty as marked as her mental gifts. Her father, Colonel Alfred L. Rives, is a distinguished engineer and the son of Hon. William C. Rives, three times minister to France, member of the United States Senate, and the author of a \"Life of Madison.\" Miss Rives passed her childhood between Mobile, Ala., and William Rives' country place, Castle Hill, in Albemarle county, Va. When she was about sixteen years old, her father, on the death of his mother, fell heir to the estate, and from that time they made it their permanent home. From the time she was nine years old Miss Rives found her greatest delight in her pen, writing freely and without restraint whatever occupied her fancy for the time. Her writings were never criticised, and rarely read, and to that habit of freedom is perhaps due the strong individuality of style which has carried her so successfully through what has been, so far, a most daring as well as a most brilliant literary career. Her love of art only seconded that of literature, and her life has been spent in pursuit of both. In 1886 Miss Rives published anonymously, in the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" \"A Brother to Dragons,\" a story of the sixteenth century, so powerful that it attracted widespread attention both in this country and in England. The same year a sonnet of great strength appeared in the \"Century,\" signed by Amelie Rives, and she was soon identified as the author of ''A Brother to Dragons.\" Many orders were received by her for stories and poems, but she preferred not to hurry into print, and published the following year, 1887, only two short stories, \"The Farrier Lass o' Piping Pebworth\" in \"Lippincott's Magazine,\" and \"Nurse Crumpet Tells the Story,\" in \"Harper's Magazine.\" In 1889 appeared in \"Lippincott's Magazine\" \"The Quick or the Dead.\" That story, or rather study, as Miss Rives called it. at once launched her on the sea of literature as a novelist of undoubted power. Criticism came from all sides. The story was translated into French, and appeared in the \"Revue des Deux Mondes.\" It was impossible that so daring a venture should escape censure, but Miss Rives kept her balance through blame and praise alike, writing steadily and studying, filled with a purpose to perfect herself in the art she considers the greatest, determined to retain her individuality while constantly striving to throw aside the faults of youth and literary inexperience. In June, 1888, she became the wife of John Armstrong Chanler, a grandson of John Jacob Astor. Mr. Chanler, who has spent much of his life abroad, was imbued with the same love of art and literature that had formed the mainspring of Miss Rives' life, and was anxious that his wife should perfect her art studies. That summer she published her first drama, \"Herod and Mariamne,\" written three years before, and in April, 1889, she sailed for Havre. After traveling for some months she settled in Paris for hard work, but was greatly interrupted by ill-health. Unable to paint, she continued to write and study, perfecting herself in French and reading widely in all branches of English literature. None of her European work has been published, except a study of life in the Latin Quarter, entitled \"According to St. John,\"Â which appeared in the \"Cosmopolitan\" as a serial, in 1891. In the month of August, 1891, she returned to America. She was followed shortly by Charles Lasar, an artist and teacher of prominence in Paris, under whom she will study at her home in Castle Hill during the fall and winter months for several years to come. A second drama, entitled \"Athelwold,\" was published in \"Harper's Magazine\" of February, 1892, and has received high praise from the leading literary papers of the North. Mrs. Chanler has but just begun a career which promises to be enduring as well as brilliant. She is impressed by the feeling that what she has done is but a preparation, \"studies,\" as she is fond of expressing it, for the message she feels she has to deliver, and every power of an intense and earnest nature is bent on putting to the best uses the talents which she looks upon with a deep sense of responsibility.

A man who measured up to the modern requirements was the late Thomas Christian, in whose death the community lost one of its best known and most highly esteemed citizens, who gave much time and thought to the advancement of the city of Richmond during his younger years.\n\nThomas Christian was born in Richmond county, August 3, 1845, eldest child of the late William H. and Emeline (Dudley) Christian, who were the parents of these other children: Lizzie; Mary; William H., died September 22, 1905; Charles, died in infancy; Emma, wife of George L. Christian; all those living reside in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThomas Christian was educated in private schools of Richmond and at Williams College, Massachusetts, which thoroughly qualified him for the activities of life. For many years he was identified with the commercial and public life of Richmond, and after 1871 he was also engaged in business as a wholesale manufacturer. Scientific pursuits possessed a strong fascination for him, and in the pursuit of several branches of research he won wide distinction both here and abroad. His experiments in the field of photography as well as with the microscope attracted the attention of two continents. An ardent philatelist, he secured a notable collection of stamps, and his collection of Indian implements and relics gathered by himself, was also noteworthy. An outdoor life always appealed to him, and he was well known among the sportsmen and fishermen of the city, who estimated him at his true worth. Mr. Christian was for many years active in the work of the Chamber of Commerce, serving on the James River Improvement Committee never being absent from a meeting, and for a portion of his term of service acted as auditor of the committee. He was also a member of the State Commission of the New Orleans Exposition, and an active factor in the old state fair organization. His interests in life were broad, his work widely extended, and the influence he exerted will be felt for many years, although he has passed to the Great Beyond. He married, October 10, 1878, Ida Kate James, of Detroit, born April 9, 1856, daughter of Captain William V. and Amy U. (Harris) James, who survives him, as does also a daughter, Mrs. Charles G. Taylor Jr., of Ginter Park.\n\nMr. Christian died at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Charles G. Taylor, after a long illness, aged sixty-eight years. Interment was in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond. The demise of Mr. Christian, who was a man of the highest character and standing, a man of unselfish disposition, hospitable, charitable, with a ready sympathy for those in affliction or need, was a great shock to his hosts of friends, who were to be found in all walks of life. Scrupulously honorable in all his dealings with mankind, he bore a reputation for public and private integrity second to none, and he left to posterity that priceless heritage, an honored name.

D. S., M. D.\n\nThe father of Dr. Frank Lee Costenbader, a prominent dental practitioner of Richmond, Virginia, was William H. Constenbader, a native of Pennsylvania, who founded his line in Virginia, and with the troops from that state, fought in the Confederate cause against the army of the Union, while his brothers were soldiers of the northern forces. Several of his seven children continue their residence in Virginia, loyal to the state of their father's adoption and their birth, Virginians in love for and pride in their home.\n\nWilliam H. Costenbader, son of Henry and Carolyn (Koch) Costenbader, was born near Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, and resided there until he was a youth of seventeen years, removing then to Virginia, and settling in Westmoreland county. His calling was that of a millwright, and in Westmoreland county he became the proprietor of a general store and owner and operator of a mill that was formerly the possession of George Washington. The war between the states found him enlisted in Company E, Fifty-fifth Regiment Virginia Volunteer Infantry, at Tappahannock, Virginia. He served under Captains J. B. Jett, Jim Wharton and W. E. Baker; Colonel Mallory, of Tappahannock; brigade, Heath's, Field's and Walker's; A. P. Hill's division; Stonewall Jackson corps; commander-in-chief, Robert E. Lee. In the Confederate service he experienced many of the thrilling adventures and misfortunes that fall to a soldier's lot, being wounded in action, taken prisoner by the enemy, and confined in a Maryland military prison. Poor sanitary conditions, lack of sufficient nourishment, and careless treatment by his captors, resulted in a severe attack of typhoid fever, from which he happily recovered after a long time. A detailed account of his military experience during the war is as follows: In prison at Point Lookout, while loading logs used in building a mess house for the soldiers, he made his escape to the banks of the Potomac. There he found an old canoe an done oar, and with this equipment he paddled across the Potomac river, reaching his family in Westmoreland county, Virginia, safely. He immediately reported to the authorities and at once resumed active service. When his regiment went into the third day's fight at Gettysburg, he was commissioned by his colonel to follow the colors, and should the color bearer fall, see to it that the colors were brought from the field. The color bearer was shot, but this was not observed until the main army had retreated a considerable distance. When Mr. Costenbader made this discovery, he returned to the field of battle alone to get the colors. As the Union soldiers saw him come back alone they commenced to cheer and shout in admiration of his bravery. Later in life, when he recounted this adventure to his sons, he told them that the shouting aroused his anger and he lost all fear. All alone he rammed the colors into the ground, faced the enemy, at whom he fired three times, and then retreated in safety. The enemy had apparently too much admiration for his courage and bravery to shoot him down, which they could have done very easily. During the second day at Gettysburg he, with a few others, captured twenty-two Union soldiers. His eldest brother was in General Sherman's army, and was one of the men who, on the destructive march through the south, was considered one of the bravest soldiers in the Union army. His name was Jesse, and he was as sure that the Union army was in the right, as his brother was that the Confederates had right on their side. He, also, has passed away. He was one of the stanch Grand Army of the Republic men of the north. His hatred for his brother who was fighting for the southern cause was intense, and he frequently expressed the wish that they might meet face to face in battle. After the war they met and all differences were forgotten. A complete record of the engagements in which Mr. Costenbader was active is as follows: At Gaines Mill, one day; Mechanicsville, one day; Malvern Hill, one day; Cedar Mountain, one day; Second Manassas, three days; Ox Hill, where he was shot through the right breast, the bullet being extracted from his back; Fredericksburg; Gettysburg, during the three days; Wilderness, two days; Spottsylvania, one day; Hanovertown, where he was again wounded; Funkstown or Falling Waters; and Warrentown Springs. Upon his return to his Westmoreland county home, he resumed his business occupations, with which he was successfully identified until his death in 1903 at the age of sixty-seven years.\n\nMr. Costenbader married Ella J. Pitts, born in 1848, died about 1895, daughter of William Larkin and Martha Ann (Page) Pitts; granddaughter of Richard Larkin Pitts, who was born in Caroline county, Virginia; and a sister of Elizabeth, Ann, Martha, William, Silas, John, Sarah, Lucy, Harriet, Alexander, Larkin and Robert. Mr. and Mrs. Costenbader had children: Benjamin, a resident of Slatington, Pennsylvania; Edwin H., lives at Colonial Beach, Virginia; John H., a dentist, of Norfolk, Virginia; Cora V., married Robert L. Thomas, and lives on the old Pitts homestead in Virginia; Vivanna, unmarried, resides in Richmond; Ardelle R., married Claude Wilkins and lives at Maple Grove, Westmoreland county, Virginia; Dr. Frank Lee, of whom further.\n\nDr. Frank Lee Costenbader, son of William H. and Ella J. (Pitts) Costenbader, was born on the maternal homestead in Westmoreland county, Virginia. His education was obtained in the elementary schools of his native county, and there he attended college, afterward coming to Richmond and entering the University College of Medicine, receiving from that institution in 1901, the degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery, and in 1902, that of Doctor of Medicine. For the period of one year after his graduation in medicine, he was the resident physician in St. Luke's Hospital, and in May, 1903, established himself in the practice of dentistry, having made that profession his choice. Dr. Costenbader's professional labors have been heavy ever since he began his preparatory study for his degree in medicine and dentistry, and in active practice he has found great favor in Richmond, to which field he has confined his efforts. His office for the past four years has been at No. 113 East Grace street, where he attends to a large and profitable practice. Dr. Costenbader is fraternally associated with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Masonic order, affiliating, in the last mentioned organization, with Dove Lodge, No. 51, Free and Accepted Masons. In religious belief he is identified with the Christian church, and a member of the Seventh Street congregation of that denomination.\n\nDr. Costenbader married, at Washington, District of Columbia, July 25, 1913, Mary Adelaide Teck Shand, born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, November 1, 1874, a daughter of James and Annie (Reid) Shand, and a sister of Ella, Elizabeth C., Robert Napier, Matthew Henry, James P., Harry Elcho, Frederick William West, Hiram Joseph Bennett and Edgar G. James Shand was a commission merchant and real estate appraiser, and was captain in the Halifax Garrison Artillery. [Source: Encyclopedia of Virginia Biographies - Vol. IV. Transcribed by Chris Davis]\n\nCottrell, Dr. Samuel Smith\n\nRetired from business life, in which he was known as a member of the Cottrell Saddlery Company, Charles Clinton Cottrell is succeeded in active life in the city of Richmond by his son, Samuel Smith Cottrell, M. D., a recently established medical practitioner, a graduate of Boston University.\n\n(I) Dr. Cottrell is a grandson of Charles Benjamin Cottrell, a native of Goochland county, Virginia, who died at the family home at Mount Aaron, Henrico county Virginia, in 1861, at the age of about forty years. Charles Benjamin Cottrell married Catherine Thurston, a native of Botetourt county, Virginia, born in 1828, died in 1896. They were the parents of: Aminta, married John H. Frischkorn, of Richmond; Charles Clinton, of whom further; Anna, married D. W. Jones, of Richmond; Willard Monmouth; and a daughter who died in infancy.\n\n(II) Charles Clinton Cottrell, son Charles Benjamin and Catherine (Thurston) Cottrell, was born in Richmond, Virginia, October 12, 1856, and after an active and useful business career now lives retired in the city of his birth. The Cottrell Saddlery. Company was established by his uncle, S. S. Cottrell, in 1845, and with this concern Charles Clinton Cottrell was identified in important positions. In leaving the business world of Richmond for quiet retirement, well merited after a lifetime of strenuous effort, he left with his former associates the remembrance of a man of strictest integrity and perfect fairness, one to whom the wiles of business were a closed book and honor paramount. He married May White, born in Richmond, daughter of William H. White. William H. White was a native of Maryland, and as a young man came to Richmond, where for many years he dealt in trunks and leather goods. He espoused the Confederate cause at the outbreak of the war between the states and was wounded in battle, from that time until the end of the conflict being associated with the treasury department of the Confederate government. His death occurred in 1884, when he was sixty-five years of age. His wife, Margaret Shardale (Greaner) White, was born in Richmond, and died in 1910, aged eighty-four years. Children of William H. and Margaret Shardale (Greaner) White: Mary, married C. A. West, of Richmond; John Henry, of Richmond; Margaret, married C. A. Scarff, of Baltimore, Maryland; May, of previous mention, married Charles Clinton Cottrell. Charles Clinton Cottrell and his wife were the parents of five children: Dr. Samuel Smith, and Rebecca, born December 26, 1901, the only survivors, the others being Charles Clinton (2), died aged four years, James Crane, died aged two years, and William White, died aged one year.\n\n(III) Dr. Samuel Smith Cottrell, son of Charles Clinton Cottrell, was born in Richmond, Virginia, November 12, 1889. He obtained his classical education in the schools of that city. After a high school course he entered Richmond College and was graduated from that institution in the class of 1910, afterward becoming a medical student in Boston University. He was awarded his M. D. in 1914 and returned to the city of his birth to begin practice, in which he is now engaged. While at this time following the lines of general practice, Dr. Cottrell has as his aim and is preparing for a specialty in nervous diseases, a specialty of broad aspect and unbounded opportunity. Dr. Cottrell's profession was of his own choosing, and his enthusiasm and his love for his work have made little account of the difficulties and perplexities that are inseparable from new experiences and duties. These same qualities augur well for his future success, for his ideals and ambitions are high and his early work in his profession worthy. (Source: Encyclopedia of Virginia Biographies - Vol. IV. Transcriber: Chris Davis)\n\nCottrell, Orin L.\n\nOrin L. Cottrell was born in Richmond, Va., September 9, 1845. He was educated in the schools of the city, and in 1867 entered into a co-partnership in the hardware business with Mr. Clariborne Watkins, under the firm name of Watkins, Cottrell & Co. Several years ago, Mr. Watkinsâ health failing, he withdrew, and the firm name was changed to Cottrell, Watkins & Co., Messrs. William S. Robertson and A. Salle Watkins being admitted to partnership. Mr. Cottrell was a member of Fraternity Lodge, No. 53, A. F. and A. M., and St. Andrews Commandery, No. 13, Knights Templar. He served in the Armory Battalion during the war, and though in several engagements, was never wounded. Mr. Cottrell was for a number of years a member of the Executive Committee of the Virginia Historical Society, and always took an active interest in its affairs. He had accumulated a library containing much valuable matter relating to Virginian and American history. Quiet and unassuming in his manners and scholarly in his tastes, he enjoyed the respect, affection, and good will of his associates.
