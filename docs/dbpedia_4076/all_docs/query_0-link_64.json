        "text": "Moffett, John S. - Private, 14th Virginia Infantry\n\nJohn S. Moffett of Rockbridge Co., Virginia entered the Virginia Military Institute in July, 1860, in his eighteenth year. In the spring of 1861 volunteered as a private in the 4th Virginia Infantry, and served with it until killed, at the first battle of Manassas, July 21, 1861. Charlie Moore, Charlie Norris, and John Moffett all became brother-cadets within a few days of each other, entered service together, and on the same day died for their common mother country in their first battle for her rights.\n\n(Source: Biographical sketches of the Graduates and Eleves of the Virginia Military Institute who fell during the war between the States, by Chas. D. Walker. Published 1875. Transcribed and submitted to Genealogy Trails by Linda Rodriguez)\n\nMontague, Andrew Jackson - Private, Co. C, 55th Virginia Infantry\n\nAndrew Jackson, son of Lewis B. Montague and Catharine S., his wife, was born in the county of Middlesex, on the 4th of July, 1842. After going to neighborhood schools he was sent to Fleetwood Academy, then conducted by Mr. Oliver White. While at this institution, where he was associated with many youths of the best families of the neighboring counties, Jack, as he was familiarly called, was very popular. He bore the reputation of great sprightliness, and evinced many evidences of strong native intellectÂ He was highly esteemed and beloved by his kind preceptors, Messrs. White and Council He remained at the academy for two years, when he was sent to the Virginia Military Institute, in the year i860. He there entered the fourth class, and remained until April, 1861, when the most efficient members of the corps were ordered to Richmond to act as drill-masters. These cadets were assigned to a camp of instruction, afterwards known as Camp Lee. While here they rendered very efficient services in drilling raw volunteers rushing to the defense of the Southern cause. Most of the troops from the Southern States as they were sent on to Virginia were ordered to remain at this camp, and many of the Virginia regiments also, previous to their being mustered into the service. It was here that officers and men were instructed in the duties of a soldier and the details of camp-life. Here many of the troops were organized who afterwards gained the wonderful battle of Manassas, thereby winning an imperishable renown for Southern prowess and reflecting much credit upon the discipline enforced at the camp of instruction. Young Montague remained in the performance of these duties as long as they were needed. Instead of returning to the Institute and completing his course, he was inspired with all the ardent patriotism of youth, and preferred the sterner duties of active service to the more retired life of a cadet Although he had the benefit of a military education, as far as his time allowed, he did not wait for office to which he might with all justice and reason have aspired, but entered, in March, 1862, Co. \"C,\" of the 55th Virginia Infantry, as a private. In this company he was associated with the most refined and intelligent material of his county, where there was but little prospect of promotion among so many young men of high intelligence and equal social position. Jack Montague joined just as the regiment was going into real active service. He manifested in camp the same cheerful, bright disposition he had always shown; every service was performed with the greatest zeal and alacrity, and the writer well remembers how cheering his jokes were to his wearied comrades on the march. He was exceedingly popular with all his regiment, and set a valuable and important example to his comrades. His regiment saw quite active service in the spring of 1862, marching and picketing in the vicinity of Fredericksburg, made a forced march to Richmond, and there participated in the battles around the city. In the battle of Mechanicsville, the writer noticed with great admiration the coolness displayed by Jack when under such terrific fire. The regiment suffered very severely. On the next day, the 27th of June, the regiment participated in the battle of Gaines's Mills, where it again suffered severely. Among those who stood true to their colors Montague was at his post in the front rank, where he received a flesh wound in the arm, the same ball passing through the flesh and severely wounding his rear-rank man. Jack was sent to Richmond, where he met his brother, who conveyed him to a private house. After reaching quarters, he was taken with an inflammation which produced fever. His head was very much affected towards the last of his illness. While here, with all the attention of a good physician and hospitable family and the assiduous nursing of a devoted brother, his symptoms grew worse, until he fell a victim to disease produced from his wound. The writer also remembers his wandering thoughts the night before his death, as his mind reverted to the battle scenes and he alluded to the marshaling of troops. Thus, like his immortal instructor, he passed over the river with his mind engrossed in the raging conflict on earth. He died quietly and happily on July 12, 1862.\n\nGeorge D.

Moore of Memphis, Tennessee, was entered at the Virginia Military Institute by General W. Y. C. Humes, in August, 1860. In the spring of 1861 he went to Richmond with the corps of cadets, and acted as one of the drill-masters in the camp of instruction at that place, until ordered on same duty to Manassas. At the first battle of Manassas, July 21, 1861, he went into the fight as a volunteer, and was killed at the head of his company, leading it in a charge on one of the enemy's batteries. At the time of his death young Moore was in his nineteenth year.\n\n(Source: Biographical sketches of the Graduates and Eleves of the Virginia Military Institute who fell during the war between the States, by Chas.

Transcribed and submitted to Genealogy Trails by Linda Rodriguez)\n\nMorgan, Edward Ford - Major, 8th Georgia Battalion\n\nStrongly as our sympathies must be aroused, and our hearts touched by the deep anguish of parents whose noble scions have been hurried into eternity from the red field of battle, by the deadly bullet or screaming shell, yet how stronger and deeper must the feeling of pity be when an aged couple, having seen their only child, at the first call of duty, gallantly espouse the cause of his fatherland, and, with unfaltering energy and never-tiring faith, pass through all the multitudinous dangers of an entire war unharmed, his life preserved in the storm of battle and from the deadly attack of insidious disease; having welcomed him home with that just pride that has no equal,âthe parents' pride in a patriot son,âthey find he has come but to die. Such, in brief, is the story of the life told below.Â Â We know that many a Southern heart will beat in tender sympathy with the bereaved parents of young Edward Morgan.\n\nEdward Ford Morgan, only son of George W. and Matilda Anna Morgan, was born in Augusta, Georgia, on the 9th of October, 1843. Receiving the usual education of a boy in his station in life, he entered the Virginia Military Institute on the 23d of July, 1860, in his seventeenth year. Upon a call of General Garnett, he with other cadets voluntarily went to Western Virginia, in July, 1861, before which time none of the cadets had been sent on dangerous service. He shared the dangers and hardships of the army on its retreat, and was not far from the general when he was killed. In the fall of 1861 he received a commission as cadet in the Confederate army, and was ordered to report to General Law-ton, at Savannah. Here he was first assigned to Colonel Spalding's regiment, in which he served until the following spring, when he was attached to the 8th Georgia Battalion, in which he remained until a fragment of it was surrendered, in 1865, by General Johnston to Sherman.\n\nCadet Morgan was appointed captain in the provisional army of the Confederate States in the summer of 1862, and ordered with his battalion immediately thereafter into Mississippi, where he was in General Johnson's army, marching on Vicksburg, and within fifteen miles of that city when it capitulated. He then returned to Georgia, and actively participated in the battles of Chickamauga and Missionary Ridge, being on the right in the last-named battle, and retreating with that wing to Dalton. Soon after General Johnston assumed command of the Western army, Captain Morgan received his commission as major, then the youngest man ' of that rank in the army. Serving unremittingly from Dalton to Atlanta, he was in the battle fought by General Hood with Sherman at the latter place, and was wounded very severely,âat first thought mortally,âby a Minie-ball, which passed through his neck.\n\nAfter recruiting at home for about sixty days, Major Morgan started for his command, but was prevented, by an attack of erysipelas, from being present at the battles of Franklin and Nashville. In passing through Augusta after these disasters, though only a major in rank, he was in command of what remained of General Gist's Brigade, to which his 'battalion had long been attached. He clung to the remnant of the Western army, and shared its fate in North Carolina.\n\nFew of his youthful compatriots possessed more of the elements of a soldier. The maturity of his thought, and the clearness of his judgment in military affairs, were remarkable in one of his years; and looking to the profession of arms for honorable distinction, none felt more keenly and bitterly the fall of the Confederacy. He was generous, unselfish, modest, and brave, and was universally respected and loved by officers and men. A boy in years; a man in attributes.\n\nThe last few years of his short but eventful life were spent in superintending a plantation between the Coosa and Tallapoosa Rivers, in Alabama, where their waters meet and commingle as one; and there, in the morning of life, on the 3d of January, 1869, he died, from disease contracted in service. His remains lie in the beautiful cemetery at Augusta, Georgia.\n\n(Source: Biographical sketches of the Graduates and Eleves of the Virginia Military Institute who fell during the war between the States, by Chas. D. Walker. Published 1875. Transcribed and submitted to Genealogy Trails by Linda Rodriguez)\n\nMorgan, William Henry - Captain, Co. F, 21st Virginia Infantry\n\nThe military life of William Henry Morgan is that of one who, after enduring all the physical hardships of a series of disheartening campaigns, is suddenly cut off when, as it were, he first tastes the actual pleasures of war.\n\nThe space allotted to this sketch does not permit a detailed account of the boyhood of the subject; nor is that of great importance to the purpose before us. Suffice it to say that W. H. Morgan was born in the county of Chesterfield, on the 1st of September, 1839.\n\nAt the age of seventeen he matriculated at the Virginia Military Institute, and on the 18th of September, 1856 entered the fourth class. The four years of his college-life were most' creditable,âhaving during that time, in addition to a fair stand in his class, received each successive year the highest military office in the gift of the Institute. He graduated on the 4th of July, i860, taking a general stand of thirteen in a class of forty-one, as captain of \"A\" Company, having served with merit in each successive grade from that of corporal.\n\nMorgan was a man of modest and retiring disposition, of simple tastes, and uniform temper; taciturn at all times, yet ready to give a decided opinion upon any subject to which he had given sufficient thought.\n\nHe was as a cadet enthusiastically devoted to the military portion of his studies, and was most conscientious in the discharge of the duties of the various grades that he filled. Probably no cadet officer was more respected by his comrades, nor was there a lack of appreciation of these qualities by his superior officers, for at the close of his graduating year he was invited to take service on the staff of the Institute as assistant instructor of tactics. He filled this position with satisfaction to his superiors until his entry into the Confederate service.\n\nThe first contribution made by Morgan to his State, was drilling and in other ways fitting for active service a company of students formed at Washington College. This work was so well and thoroughly done that the appreciation of the company manifested itself in a suitable present,âa pair of field-glasses, that were carried by the recipient on many hard-fought fields.\n\nOn the 20th of April, 1861, in company with other officers of the Virginia Military Institute, Morgan was ordered to Camp Lee, the recruiting depot of the army, situated near Richmond. He had been there only a short time when he was appointed adjutant of Gilham's 21st Regiment, then under orders for West Virginia. On the 15th of August this regiment, forming a part of the Corps of Observation of West Virginia, was camped near Valley Mountain. From this time until December he endured with patience all the privations incident to the campaign of West Virginia. There was little fighting, but worse by far to the young soldiers just entering a campaign, hunger, cold, and disappointment met them at every turn,âeverything, in fact, that could weary the body and harass the mind.\n\nDuring the month of December the 2d Brigade of Loring's Division, commanded by Colonel Gilham, was ordered to the Valley to reinforce General Jackson, then operating near Winchester. Morgan was at this time acting assistant adjutant-general.\n\nThe brigade reached the Valley in time to participate in the battle of Kernstown. In this action Morgan rendered efficient service, by the skill and steadiness with which he seconded the efforts of his chief.\n\nAt the reorganization of the army, in 1862, Morgan was elected captain of Company \"F,\" 21st Regiment. This placed him at once in a position that he had eagerly desired since his entry into the service,âthe direct line of promotion. He accepted the position without hesitation, retiring from the staff of the brigade.\n\nAs captain of infantry in that famous division of \"Stonewall \" Jackson, he shared with distinction all the glory of the Valley campaigns, the hard marching and the incessant fighting for the relief of Richmond. From the banks of the James his command was transferred by rail to Gordonsville.\n\nOn the 9th of August, 1862, the advance of Jackson's force had penetrated northward as far as Cedar Mountain. Here the leading column was checked by Federal troops under Banks. Jackson at once prepared to give battle. Sending forward the division of Early to develop the strength of the enemy, he placed the division of Winder, then arriving on the ground, in support Afterwards' it was found necessary to take ground to the left. In doing this the 2d Brigade (to which belonged the 21st Regiment) was placed on the extreme left of the line, the left regiment somewhat retired. In support of the 2d Brigade was placed the \"Stonewall\" Brigade, but unfortunately with so little regard to true military tactics as to leave a wide gap between the left of the 2d Brigade and the entire front of the supports. This bad alignment, as will be seen, was fruitful of confusion and disaster. Probably, had Winder not been killed almost as soon as he reached the field, this would have all been rectified.\n\nThe enemy, though driven back somewhat on the right, still held their ground on the left; in fact, had increased the number of guns in their front The artillery fire was incessant, and the execution among the troops quite destructive,â the 2d Brigade especially, being on the flank and subjected to a partial enfilade, suffered severely.\n\nPerhaps there is nothing that so fascinates the gaze of the soldier, and diverts his attention from the horrors of the battle-field and its attendant fears and misgivings, as the spectacle of an officer who calmly and fearlessly looks death in the face; one who bears himself with the ease and serenity that becomes the drawing-room rather than the disordered arena of carnage; who, without the least bravado, yet with the high pride and courage that scorns the base thought of fear, encourages others, and stands with waiting patience to meet his fate; one, in short, who knows no compromise with duty. In such noble presence even the basest minds must feel the electric effect of their proximity; it is the one touch of nature that makes all akin, and mesmerizes the mind and body of the crowd to the strong will of the leader.\n\nThus it was that Morgan, reckless of his own life, moved with careless ease before his men, whom he compelled to lie down under the severe artillery fire to which they were exposed.\n\nIn the mean time the pressure in front of the brigade had become very much increased; the irregular line of skirmishers was replaced by solid masses of infantry; the advance had begun, and in a few minutes a fierce force poured down on the 2d Brigade, overlapping its left flank, and filling the gap between that brigade and the \" Stonewall.\" The last corps, taken on the flank and in reverse, at once broke, as did also the left regiment of the 2d Brigade. It was reserved for the 21st Regiment to stay the torrent, and hold in check, for a few minutes only (but yet how important even that time!), the victorious enemy. In this melee Morgan, ever foremost in action, met a glorious death, while encouraging his men to stand fast and do their duty.\n\nThus fell, in the prime of life, a most gallant soldier and virtuous gentleman. Throughout his military career he never failed either in the comprehension or performance of his duty, and in the high promise that he gave of future usefulness, it is not too much to say that the scope of his office was for too small to show the extent of his genius. No greater compliment could be rendered him as an officer than the discipline of his company under the trying circumstances of his death.\n\nCaptain John D. Young.\n\n(Source: Biographical sketches of the Graduates and Eleves of the Virginia Military Institute who fell during the war between the States, by Chas. D. Walker. Published 1875. Transcribed and submitted to Genealogy Trails by Linda Rodriguez)\n\nSecond Lieutenant CARLTON RADFORD MUNFORD, of Richmond, Virginia, matriculated 1841. His father was William Munford, graduate of William and Mary College, member of both houses of the General Assembly of Virginia, from Mecklenburg County, and the accomplished scholar who translated Homerâs Iliad; and his grandfather was Colonel Robert Munford, who was a captain in George Washingtonâs Regiment, and served on his staff in the Indian War (see Bland Papers). His mother was a daughter of Captain William Radford, who was the son of Captain William Radford of the Virginia Navy in the Revolutionary War, and who was captured in the West Indies, incarcerated in the Tower of London, and escaped through the instrumentality of Lafayette. Thus it is seen this handsome, promising, and gallant young man inherited a fondness for arms.\n\nLeaving the Institute in 1842, he spent the following session at the University of Virginia. When the First Virginia Regiment was raised for the Mexican War, he was associated with Captain Carrington and Lieutenant Porterfield (both Institute Alumni) in organizing Company A, of which he became second lieutenant.\n\nHis career was very brief, for he died upon the âfield of honorâ in a duel with Captain Washington S. Mahan of his regiment, near China, in Mexico. Colonel George A. Porterfield, his friend and classmate at the Institute and fellow-officer in Mexico, thus speaks of the sad tragedy: âI had been sent to CamergoÂ on official business and arrived on May 21. That evening, an express came in with the news that a fatal meeting had taken place between Lieutenant Munford of my company and Lieutenant Mahan of Captain Bankheadâs company. I started back on the 24th to China (a small town half-way between Camergo and Monterey), where my battalion was stationed; and, on the roadside near China, I saw a fresh grave which I learned was that of my friend and classmate Lieutenant Carlton R. Munford, He had died on the night of May 22d, after intense suffering. The duel was fought about a mile west of China. The weapons used were muskets, loaded by agreement as each contestant might think proper. Munford used the usual cartridgeÂ of a ball and three buckshot; Mahan loaded with buckshot. They advanced until about 50 yards apart; they then raised their pieces and advanced until 20 yards apart, when both fired at precisely the same time. Both fell, apparently dead, and were carried into town on litters. Several buckshot had passed through Munfordâs bowels;Â¾one through Mahanâs breast; he lingered about two weeks, and died. Captain Young and Bankhead were witnesses of the duel.â\n\nFirst Lieutenant Thomas S. Garnett, M. D. (V. M. I.), of the same regiment, was also present, in the capacity (it is inferred) of surgeon.\n\nLieutenant Mahan was a son of Professor Dennis H. Mahan of the United States Military Academy, and Lieutenant Munford was an uncle of General Thos. T. Munford (V. M. I.). Colonel Porterfield added that General Taylor was very severe upon the officers (and especially Major Jubal A. Early, who was in command of the regiment at the time) for permitting the duel to take place.\n\nGeneral A. C. Cummings also wrote, as follows, of Lieutenant Munford:Â âI knew him well and esteemed him highly, and have a very pleasant recollection of our association together at the Institute. He was in the Mexican War, but I never met him in Mexico. I was in the army commanded by General Scott, on the line from Vera Cruz to the City of Mexico; and he on the line of the Rio Grande, under the command of General Taylor; and we were thus widely separated. He was in the volunteer regiment from Virginia, commanded by Colonel John F. Hamtramck, the lieutenant-colonel being Thomas Beverly Randolph, and the Major, the late General Jubal A. Early. He was killed in a duel with Lieutenant Washington S. Mahan; and, according to the published accountÂ¾ at the time, they fought with army muskets, and were both killed.â\n\nIn this connection, the following order will be of interest:\n\nâHEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF OCCUPATION,\n\nâMONTEREY, December 10, 1847.\n\nâORDERSÂ¾No. 134.\n\nâThe President of the United States has directed that a Court of Inquiry be instituted to investigate certain allegations and charges contained in a letter signed by John Ashton, Jr., George M. Kiem, John Davis, and others, dated Philadelphia, September, 1847, in relation to a duel said to have taken place near China, Mexico, on, or about, the 20th of May, 1847, between 2d Lieutenants Carlton R. Munford and Washington S. Mahan, of the regiment of Virginia Volunteers, which resulted in the death of the parties engaged; and to which, it is alleged, Captain Smith P. Bankhead and John P. Young, and 1st Lieutenant Thomas S. Garnett, all of the Virginia volunteers, were accessories.\n\nâA Court of Inquiry will therefore assemble at Buena Vista, Mexico, at 10 oâclock A. M., on the 10th instant, or as soon thereafter as practicable, for the purpose referred to above. The Court will report the facts, and give an opinion on the merits of the case.\n\nâ âDetails for the Court:\n\nâColonel Charles Clarke, Mississippi Regiment Volunteers.\n\nâMajor M. S. Stokes, North Carolina Regiment Volunteers.\n\nâCaptain P. M. Henry , North Carolina Regiment Volunteers.\n\nâ1st Lieutenant John F. Reynolds, 3d Regiment Artillery , is\n\nappointed Judge-Advocate.\n\nâBy command of Brigadier-General Wool,\n\nâIrvin McDowell,\n\nâAssistant Adjutant-General.\n\nâOfficial,\n\nâG. A. Porterfield,\n\nâAssistant Artillery Adjutant-General.â\n\nThe findings of the Court are not known to this writer; nor has he ever heard what was the cause of the duel which thus brought two such promising careers to an untimely end.\n\n(Source: The Military History of the Virginia Military Institute from 1839-1861, by: Jennings C.
