Mary Phillips on Gardening for Wildlife\n\nMARY PHILLIPS BIO\n\nFor eight years, Mary has led Garden for Wildlife™ and Certified Wildlife Habitat® as an ambassador for native plants with the National Wildlife Federation. Her work ensures all habitat programs and resources are rooted in sustainable practices and the latest science.\n\nMary’s love for wildflowers comes naturally. As a child, she discovered trillium, dogtooth violets, spring beauties, bluebells and the wildlife around them near her family’s Ohio home. Years later, she introduced her children to these same native plants along the Sligo Creek trail in Maryland. Recently, she has seen many of these essential early spring ephemerals squeezed out by invasive, non-native plants. This personal experience fuels the passion for her work.\n\nMary’s strategic leadership aligns the Garden for Wildlife mission across National Wildlife Federation’s (NWF) internal teams, habitat initiatives, partner networks and external messaging. She collaborates with leading entomologists, pollinator conservationists, federal agencies, NWF’s naturalists and trend researchers to provide substantive content, such as, keystone native plant lists for NWF’s Native Plant Finder™, Garden for Wildlife content, and Spanish language resources. This cross functional strategy has fostered public participation among millions of wildlife gardeners, more than doubled certifications, increased science and civic partnerships and created a Garden for Wildlife state network.\n\nUnder her leadership, in coordination with the White House Office of Science and Policy, NWF coordinated the National Pollinator Garden Network in 2015 to launch the Million Pollinator Garden Challenge which created over a million pollinator gardens in three years. This partnership involved over fifty national organizations with a third from the commercial garden trade, such as growers and independent garden centers.\n\nIn 2021, inspired by the work native plants do to restore habitat, and based on research conducted with the National Gardening Research survey and five hundred native plant growers nationwide, Mary helped create the Garden for Wildlife Native Plants Collection™. The goal of this social enterprise is to increase the native plant supply, reduce carbon impacts, and secure survival of iconic species, such as the monarch butterfly, native bees and songbirds. Mary works to ensure Garden for Wildlife, Inc. maintains its sustainability commitments: to engage everyday people in solutions for critical wildlife loss and climate impact and, connect local native plant growers to consumers through ecommerce. The pilot launch in spring of 2021, resulted in over 4,000 native plant collections sold in five months, for a total of 237,000 sq ft. of new garden habitat.\n\nPrior to joining NWF, Mary was principal at The Abundant Backyard, a sustainable native plant landscaping service and one of the first Certified Green Businesses in Montgomery County, MD. As a Maryland Master Naturalist, Mary maintains her Certified Wildlife Habitat® with her family and enjoys hiking and exploring the Chesapeake Bay natural history and heritage.\n\nYou can find more about Mary Phillips on LinkedIn.\n\nSHOW NOTES\n\nMary’s early start with plants and gardening with her grandparents and wildflowers\n\nHer focus on communications in college at Arizona State University\n\nCore aspects she would teach others for understanding the audience and their motivations\n\nThe importance of sharing plant stories and benefits\n\nMary’s role at The Abundant Backyard and creating community gardens and curriculum\n\nLessons learned as part of the Maryland Master Naturalist program about the Baltimore Checkerspot Butterfly\n\nAdvice for installing and managing community gardens\n\nDeveloping curriculum for kids to engage with the gardens\n\nMary’s work with the National Wildlife Federation multiplying the effect of small gardens\n\n50 years of Garden for Wildlife\n\nCertified Wildlife Habitats\n\nThe Million Pollinator Garden Challenge\n\nDoug Tallamy and Jarrod Fowler and the creation of keystone plant lists\n\nDealing with challenges of growing natives in production\n\nFavorite collections with the Garden for Wildlife Native Plants Collection™\n\nThe impact of wildlife gardens\n\nDescription of a keystone plant species\n\nHelping connect people to plants through animals\n\nMisconceptions about native plants\n\nPlants that provide food, water, cover, and places to live for animals\n\nIncentives and supporting laws that support native plant landscapes\n\nStudy about a portion of lawn converting to native plants doubling\n\nIncreasing woody plant options\n\nThe Mayors’ Monarch Pledge\n\nEfforts shifting policy and legislation\n\nSmall things everyone can do to plant for wildlife\n\nHaving wilder landscapes in urban areas and HOA’s\n\nFinding inspiration from Doug Tallamy’s books and Beatrix Potter’s books\n\nPractices that help Mary be more productive including gardening with others in the community and sitting quietly and watching the wildlife\n\nStaying current with online groups and industry groups like AmericanHort, Perennial Plant Association, and partner organizations\n\nThe myth that native gardens are messy, attract rodents, and that finding them is hard\n\nEncouraging gardeners to enjoy time in the garden more and reducing chemical use\n\nFavorite animals including Ruby-throated Hummingbirds, Northern Cardinals, Northern Flicker, and Chipmunks\n\nThe board game Wingspan\n\nPropagting horticulturists by working with communities and helping people understand native plants and career opportunities.
