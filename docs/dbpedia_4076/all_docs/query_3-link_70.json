His father died when he was just 11 years old and from that age on, he supported his mother and siblings by running his father's grist mill. He wanted to follow his father's footsteps and attend VMI but had no formal education after his father's death. [1][2]\n\nHe went to a country school for five years, took the teacher's exam and studied law under his cousin, Judge David Bolen. He worked as a surveyor, lumberman, farmer and a Justice of the Peace.\n\nHe met his future wife, Bettie Sue Hines when both went to take the qualifying exam to teach school. She would ride in the sidecar of his motorbike. For Christmas, he gave her a book of poetry (photo attached); however, she was hoping for a silver dresser set. They married May 21, 1902 in Carroll County, Virginia.[3]They had four children:\n\nCarlos Raymond Coltrane, b 1903\n\nVirginia Catherine Coltrane, b 1906\n\nMuriel Myrtle Coltrane, b 1912\n\nWilliam Branson Coltrane, b 1914\n\nAfter their marriage, they moved to Mt Airy, North Carolina, and then Ivanhoe, Virginia, [4]Radford, Virginia[5] and Emory, Virginia where he lived until his death.\n\nRobert loved history, especially the history of Southwest Virginia and some of his writings were featured in the columns of the Southwest Corner that appeared weekly in The Roanoke Times for more than 40 years. He was well-read, loved to work with his hands and there was never an arithmetic problem he could not solve.\n\nAd to sell logging equipment[6]\n\nNamesake\n\nAndrew Jackson Montague (1842-1862) entered Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in 1860 and was made drill master in 1861. He withdrew from college to join the Confederate Army in 1862 in Danville, Virginia. Andrew was wounded in the battle of Gaine's Mill (struck in the arm by a mini-ball) and died soon after from infection. He never married.\n\nHis brother, Edgar Burwell Montague also served in the same battalion as Branson, however, he survived the war and appears on the Apr. 24, 1865 list of paroled POW's. Edgar was a lawyer (before and after the War); Judge; Commonwealth Attorney for King and Queen Co. Va.; and merchant. Branson named his firstborn son, Robert Montague Coltrane after his friend.[7][8]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Census: \"United States Census, 1880,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MCP5-LZK : 15 January 2022), Margaret C.
