        "text": "Joel Embiid, Al Horford and Elton Brand will speak at the sports dinner in Cherry Hill Dec. 3.\n\nCHERRY HILL, NJ — Three members of the Philadelphia 76ers will be prominently featured at the Katz JCC’s ninth annual NFI Sports Award Dinner on Tuesday, Dec. 3, the JCC announced. The keynote address will be delivered by All-Star Center Joel Embiid, All-Star Forward Al Horford and General Manager Elton Brand.\n\n“This year’s Sports Award Dinner will be extraordinary,” event co-chair and NFI representative Jeff Brown said. “The duo of players Embiid and Horford, with the added expertise and guidance of Brand, both on and off the court, is one that has this fan base riled up with excitement and hope.”\n\n“The energy these three bring is electric,” event co-chair and Ravitz Family Foundation representative Jason Ravitz said. “We know that their sentiments will touch our attendees in some personal way, but it will also rally them together to support them and the incredible team they are part of.”\n\nThe Ravitz Family Foundation is a special partner for this event.\n\nTwo members of the community will also be honored during the event. Rabbi Benjamin David will be honored with the People’s Choice Award and Emma Stopek will receive the David Back Memorial Maccabi Award.\n\nProceeds from the Sports Award Dinner benefit an ever-increasing need for Fitness & Wellness program scholarships and services for children, including adaptive activities for those with special needs. Programs include youth sports leagues, nutrition counseling, wellness classes and obesity prevention.\n\nEmbiid, who has nicknamed himself “The Process,” is the All-Star Center for the Philadelphia 76ers. After one year of college basketball with the University of Kansas Jayhawks, he was drafted as the third overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the 76ers. In the 2016–17 season, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team and has since received two All-Star selections.\n\nHorford, who just joined the Philadelphia 76ers this season as a forward, played college basketball for the University of Florida, and was the starting center on the Gators teams that won back-to-back NCAA national championships in 2006 and 2007. He is a five-time NBA All-Star who has previously played for the Atlanta Hawks and Boston Celtics. He also represents the Dominican Republic national team.\n\nBrand played college basketball for Duke University and was later selected as the first overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. Throughout his career, he played for the Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Clippers, Dallas Mavericks and Atlanta Hawks. He was a two-time NBA All-Star and an All-NBA Second Team selection in 2006.\n\nThe JCC Sports Award Dinner will begin at 5:45pm. In addition to keynote address and honoree awards, the event includes dinner and dessert and a sports memorabilia auction. General admission tickets and patron ticket packages with reserved seating are also available.
