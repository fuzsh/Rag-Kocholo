        "text": "Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nPaul George revealed that Hall of Fame forward and Philadelphia 76ers legend Julius Erving helped recruit him to join the organization in free agency during his meeting with team owners and representatives.\n\n\"David Blitzer came, Josh Harris, Elton Brand, Dr. J,\" George said during the latest episode of Podcast P, presented by Wave Sports + Entertainment on Monday. \"Bro, I had Dr. J in my crib. That's crazy.\" George continued:\n\nDr. J had a dope intro and story. He brought up how he joined the team, they ended up getting to the champion ship and lost one. Got to the championship again, lost. Got to the championship again, lost. He's like 'We just can't get over the hump. Then they go ahead and trade for Moses Malone and win it. And he was like' That was the missing piece. P, you the missing piece. So I was like man, where do I sign!\n\nOn July 1, George joined the 76ers on a four-year deal worth $212 million after spending the previous five seasons as a member of the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nGeorge also detailed the 76ers' pitch to him as a free agent, mentioning his fit alongside Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.\n\n\"We believe in you, we want you here, there's no [more] perfect pairing with you, Joel [Embiid], Tyrese [Maxey] together,\" George recounted. \"My family felt it, I felt it, it just felt like, alright, this is where I'm going to spend the next chapter of my life.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old was impressed with Philadelphia's efforts, explaining that \"this is who i'm supposed to play for.\"\n\nGeorge also admitted that it was a difficult decision to leave Los Angeles and move his family, as the 2024 offseason represented his first time switching teams as a free agent.\n\n\"It was the toughest decision, because I'm moving my kids, my wife, right? They're comfortable here,\" he said. \"My daughters, they're already sad that they're missing out and leaving their friends that they now have grown up with for the past five years and so it was a lot. I ain't going to lie.\"\n\nHowever, the opportunity to join the 76ers on a maximum contract and compete for an Eastern Conference crown ultimately swayed George. Erving's recruitment also played a part, as the former champion spent every season of his NBA career with the organization.\n\nESPN's Ramona Shelburne reported on Wednesday that the plane carrying Erving and 76ers owner Josh Harris to the free agency meeting was delayed due to weather. When George's agent asked him if he wanted to wait for the Philadelphia sports icon, he responded \"of course.\"\n\nWith his excitement to join the organization and his reverence for the team's legends, George is already endearing himself to 76ers fans before he's stepped inside the Wells Fargo Center as a member of the home team."
