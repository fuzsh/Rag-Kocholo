Finally, in 2024, LeBron officially signed his fourth deal with a value of over $100 million. His current contract is a two-year, $101 million agreement that will earn him an estimated $48.7 million this year at 40 years old.\n\nThat figure will become the highest annual salary of his career; if he doesn’t decide to retire after that, he could earn an estimated $52.6 million salary in 2025.\n\nLeBron is the only player in NBA history to have signed four 9-figure contracts.\n\nThroughout his NBA career, LeBron James has earned $479.5 million in salary, with another $101 million guaranteed.\n\nEndorsements\n\nLeBron’s endorsement portfolio is awe-inspiring and includes Coca-Cola, Nike, Beats By Dre, Intel, Kia Motors, and Blaze Pizza.

Be A Great Leader\n\nLeBron is all about teamwork and helping his team in any way he can to break the boundaries. He’s not in it for himself; he’s in it for the team. This is majorly why the teams he’s played in have done so well and improved his fame.\n\nHowever, LeBron knows that being famous doesn’t mean anything if you can’t help others with that fame. He’s been working to make a difference since Day One of his NBA career and continues to do so today as a leader in the fight against racism.\n\n3. Learn from Past Mistakes\n\nIf he had to do it all over again, James said he’d do plenty of things differently. That shows how much he’s learned from his mistakes and how it’s helped continuously elevate his game throughout his career.\n\nSummary\n\nLeBron James is, without a doubt, one of the best NBA players in history, and all the attention/awards he’s received show this. With LeBron James’ net worth at a whopping $1.2 Billion, he’s also one of the highest-paid athletes in the world.\n\nHowever, his influence on the game of basketball has made him such a legend among an entire generation of players and fans. LeBron is much more than just “King James.” He’s a cultural icon and a national hero. He’s even a celebrity outside of basketball.\n\nStill, none of this would have been possible if LeBron hadn’t taken on the responsibility to improve himself and evolve as a player and person throughout his illustrious career.\n\nHe’s a real inspiration for any aspiring athlete, proving that you can overcome any obstacle that life throws at you with hard work and dedication.\n\nWhat do you think of LeBron James’ net worth?

We started out slow due to injuries. It kind of set us back a little bit. But winning that home game (against the Boston Celtics), then going on a six-game road trip, that was either going to make us or break us.” – Tracy McGrady\n\n“I’m still in awe of what that kid did. It was just a hell of a performance for him to shoot the ball only 46 times to score 81 points. But not just to be able to shoot it 46 times, but to shoot it 46 times and hit well over 50 per cent. To take 46 and 20 free throws and end up with 81 points, I didn’t believe it.” – Tracy McGrady\n\n“We’re definitely getting up with them coming back. The last four games, we’re playing very well. With our best players coming back, it’s only going to help improve our team even more and give us a lot more depth. … We’re back on track, and hopefully, we can stay like that.” – Tracy McGrady\n\n“We don’t know who we are. We don’t know if we want to be a team that is to be reckoned with, or we just want to be a team that runs off a four-game win streak, and then we lay down and say, ‘So what?’ and just go back to our old selves. I don’t know, man.” -Tracy McGrady\n\n“It’s every player’s personal goal, to make the All-Star team. It’s a personal accomplishment guys want to make to get a chance to participate against the elite players. Every player in this league wants to be there.” – Tracy McGrady\n\nWhat do you think about Tracy McGrady’s net worth?
