        "text": "While at the 32nd annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Oscars viewing party, Elton John’s husband, David Furnish, provided new details about the singer’s health condition as he recovers from surgery.\n\nThe 76-year-old “Rocket Man” singer underwent knee replacement surgery in January. Now, he’s preparing himself for surgery on his other knee.\n\nIn a rare appearance alongside his husband, the legendary EGOT holder attended the party with Furnish, who spoke with The Sun during the event and said he was optimistic about his John’s recovery, sharing that “He’s doing amazing.”\n\n“He’s having another knee done in a couple of weeks and by the time the summer rolls around, he’ll have two brand new spanking knees.”\n\n“I think you’ll see him breakdancing down the carpet next year,” he joked.\n\nWay back in 2021, the British composer, singer and pianist underwent hip surgery after he suffered an injury. He then fell in August 2023 at his home in France, which required hospitalization.\n\n“Elton visited the local hospital as a precautionary measure,” a statement from his team said at the time. “Following checkups, he was immediately discharged this morning and is now back at home and in good health.”"
