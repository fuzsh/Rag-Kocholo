        "text": "It’s late. But I can’t get one nagging question out of my mind:\n\nHow did Baron Davis know–REALLY KNOW–that there was $65M of Clipper money waiting for him if he opted out? How did he know that if he didn’t know what Elton Brand would get and demand and if he didn’t know what the Clippers would pay for either?\n\nNow you can all scream BECAUSE THE CLIPPERS TAMPERED with Baron before his June 30 opt-out deadline, and I guess I’d have to acknowledge the possibility.\n\nBut that doesn’t sound Clipper-like to me. I really haven’t ever heard of any Clippers executive being savvy/devious enough to go to two separate stars and figure out exactly the procedure (wait, say you’re staying, opt-out, wham) and the price for a double-signing.\n\nMaybe Jerry West could do that. Danny Ainge sort of did that, in a delayed fashion, with Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett, but that involved trades, not signings, per se. I just don’t see Elgin Baylor or Donald T. Sterling or Andy Roeser or even Mike Dunleavy Sr. pulling all of that off with Brand and Davis.\n\nI thought about this and thought about this. I talked to people. Read the stories. Analyzed the personalities. And now I’ve decided:\n\nBrand’s agent, David Falk, is the most likely candidate to have masterminded this.\n\nI’m saying if any one person put this together (and this has all the ear-marks of a one-genius creation), it was Falk, who formerly was the most powerful agent in the world back when his client Michael Jordan was winning championships.\n\nNow Falk has one star client and his name is Brand. Falk very much has the will and the determination to move mountains for Brand, like Falk used to move mountains for Jordan.\n\nAnd Brand wants to win but he also wants to stay in LA, to tend to his budding movie-making career. So happens that Davis is an LA kid also with a burgeoning movie career.\n\nIf Brand wants another star on the team, Falk is just being a good agent if he calls around and sees who’s out there. If he checks the opt-out list and sees Davis’ name. If he knows that Davis is interested in ending up in LA at some point.\n\nIf Falk happens to call up Davis’ agent Todd Ramasar to chat about both players’ interests, that’s not tampering–no team is involved. If Falk tells Ramasar that Brand might take a six-year deal from the Clips averaging $16M if Davis would take a five-year deal averaging $13M, it’s only hypotheticals.\n\nIf Falk then goes to the Clippers and tells them he can present a Brand/Baron package for an average of $29M, take it or leave it… that’s only an agent looking out for what’s best for his client.\n\nIf Davis and Ramasar like the idea and sit quietly and wait for Brand to opt-out of his deal before they steathily opt-out of Davis’ deal, that’s only strategy.\n\nI could be wrong. It might’ve been Elgin Baylor or Ramasar or Baron himself pulling the strings behind the curtain.\n\nI think it was Falk, though. I really think it was him."
