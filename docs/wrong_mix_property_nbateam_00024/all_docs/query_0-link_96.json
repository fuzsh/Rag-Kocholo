        "text": "# - free agent for summer 2013 ! - restricted free agent for summer 2013 () - amount free agent counts against the 2013-2014 cap until he is re-signed, renounced, or signs with another team Dirk Nowitzki $22,720,000 Shawn Marion $9,320,000 Brendan Haywood $9,070,000 [amnestied, doesn't count against cap] Vince Carter $3,180,000 (if team picks up option) O.J. Mayo $4,200,000 (if Mayo does not opt-out) Jared Cunningham $1,243,080 Jae Crowder $789,000 !Darren Collison ($3,342,175 qualifying offer) !Rodrigue Beaubois ($3,256,361 qualifying offer) #Chris Kaman #Anthony Morrow #Elton Brand #Brandan Wright #Mike James #Bernard James #Josh Akognon\n\nAs you can see from the contract commitments above, other than Dirk, Marion, Cunningham and Crowder (and the team is currently looking to trade Marion and get rid of that contract), the Dallas Mavericks could potentially look completely different from last year…something that has become the norm since they won the championship in 2011.\n\nOnce July 1 arrives and free agency has officially begun, Mark Cuban is going to first go after Dwight Howard and then go after Dwight Howard and finally go after Dwight Howard. (Chris Paul is going to re-sign with the Clippers…just forget about the possibility.) If things go as I expect them to, Howard will either give Lakertown another chance or, more likely, go to Houston in order to play with a rising James Harden rather than a declining Dirk.\n\nAfter that happens, Cuban and General Manager Donnie Nelson MUST move forward with “PLAN B” and not “Plan Powder Dry” as they have done the past two summers. It’s time for Dirk to get another chance in the playoffs. No more one-year deals for deteriorating veterans and players that haven’t lived up to their potential. This team needs a spark—an actual NBA player that other teams would like to have on their team.\n\nSo, I see Monta Ellis and Andrew Bynum as “PLAN B.” With the market not being too interested in Ellis because of his inability to impact the game in more than one way (scoring), Mavs could snag him for three years at an affordable price. He could become a valuable scoring punch off the bench and serve a specific and necessary role. Dallas could also get Bynum on a one-year deal since every single person in the league is worried about a 7-footer coming off surgery on BOTH of his knees. Well, and his attitude is obviously a part of the gamble. But it’s a risk the Mavs can and need to take. He is potentially an 18pts-10rbs kind of guy—with healthy knees and healthy brains cells. At the right price, he’s the right move…even if J.J. Barea wouldn’t agree with me. Signing these two stars (not superstars) would allow Dallas to have the money, with the promised pay-cut from Dirk, in the summer of 2014 to sign one of the many elite players that will be available.\n\nAndre Iguodala is also an intriguing player since he just exercised his early termination option with the Nuggets and will be an unrestricted free agent. Instead of Ellis, the Mavs could pair Iggy with Bynum for next year’s squad. Iguodala can be clumped with Shawn Marion in the group of wing players that don’t get enough credit for the impact they have on all aspects of the game. However, I see him taking less money to go play for a contender, which is something Dallas isn’t. Weird, right?\n\nAnd then moving down the ladder, “PLAN C” consists of some almost-stars. The Mavs could go after Jose Calderon, Tony Allen, Brandon Jennings (restricted free agent), Nikola Pekovic, Greg Oden (stop laughing), Al Jefferson, Tyreke Evans (RFA) or Jarrett Jack. It just depends on the price and if the team picks up someone from a plan higher in the alphabet.\n\nIn the end, though, I have no idea what Cuban is going to do. During his time in the Big D, he has been known to have ideas up his sleeves no one—including the team’s beat writers and the NBA “breaking news” journalists—saw coming. He finds ways to convince players to come to town and owners to make moves that other teams’ managements wouldn’t dream of attempting.\n\nSo, let’s sit back uneasily yet again and watch this 2013 summer of free agency unfold. And hopefully, Cuban can fold up his sleeves with something big to show.\n\nIgnite the Site!\n\nRemember this team? Remember Jason Kidd playing quarterback for the team that drafted him and having the foresight to make unexpected passes and lobs? Remember J.J. Barea and his ability to dribble through defenses as if he was weaving on a semi-circle loom? Remember Jason Terry coming in off the bench only to look like a starter who is ready to dribble to his right and pull up to make a 3-pointer when the ball arrives in his hand? Remember the emotion and defensive presence of Tyson Chandler who provided the last key piece that this team needed in order to truly become elite? Remember Dirk Nowitzki putting together one of the best playoff runs ever seen on a basketball court? Remember that feeling when a team built around winning for 11 straight years finally achieved greatness when they became world champions?\n\nYes?\n\nThat is all gone.\n\nAfter making it to the top, owner Mark Cuban had a tough decision to make: should he commit to many of his champions by signing them to long-term contracts or should he roll the dice by letting them go and creating salary cap space? Obviously, if you watched this team play last season, it was apparent which direction he went in.\n\nSo, they got through the 2011-2012 season, barely squeezing into the playoffs as the No. 7 seed with the hopes of another championship run.\n\nBut something was missing. What was missing were pieces that championship teams possess. Simple as that. Instead of attempting to find the right guys that fit into Rick Carlisle’s successful system – or bring back the players that proved their worth and wanted to stay in Dallas – Mavericks management went out and found (old) players that would accept short-term contracts, proving their insignificant worth to the team. The only thing that mattered was cap space for the upcoming summer.\n\nAll of this led to a 36-30 season in which they were eventually swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round.\n\nThis is all that needs to be said about last season. Why? It was a bridge year. It was a season that didn’t matter to anyone apart of the Mavericks organization. The entire city of DFW was waiting patiently and faithfully to see Mark Cuban reel in the big fish he promised Dirk when No. 41 took a pay-cut in his contract. Dirk put his absolute trust in Cuban to make use of the cash he was simply giving him to use for the team.\n\nPart of that money was supposed to be given to Deron Williams to come back home. With the insertion of Williams, the Mavericks would shoot right back up to the upper tier of the West as other pieces would consequently fall their way. They would be the next big thing to discuss in the sports media world as Cuban would only bolster his reputability as a connoisseur in the world of business and sports management.\n\nSince D-Will narrowed his choices down to either the Mavs or the Brooklyn Nets, the pressure was on these two teams. The two organizations shared the same basket which couldn’t hold all of both of their eggs. His decision would alter the direction each team would be headed for the next year of basketball and beyond.\n\nWell, he chose Brooklyn. He valued the extra year and $25 million more that the Nets could offer along with playing alongside All-Star guard Joe Johnson. In fact, Williams was actually close to choosing Dallas before Johnson trade swayed him in the other direction. (Just don’t think too much about this Mavs nation. It’s over.) This duo will soon become the most dynamic starting backcourt in the league – ahead of even Russell Westbrook and practically starting two-guard James Harden. Complimenting each other is vital in becoming a quality backcourt combo, and spot-up shooting Johnson will finally not feel obligated to be the orchestrator of his offense as D-Will will happily accept this role.\n\nThere is no point in discussing how Cuban was filming his television show “Shark Tank” and Dirk was at Wimbledon watching some tennis instead of attending the team’s sit-down meeting with Williams. That doesn’t matter. The two meetings on Monday was more of a formality than anything since the ever-so-talked-about point guard knew what each franchise could offer him; he understood his options.\n\nSo, now we are at the point where every Mavs fans goes out of their way to tweet at Mark Cuban or complain to their friends about how he shouldn’t have gambled with what worked. He shouldn’t have played with cap space. He should have made the smart decision.\n\nEven sports journalist Israel Gutierrez seems to agree.\n\nAs Gutierrez pointed out on “The Sports Reporters,” the “safer” approach to the 2011 offseason would have been to “bring back the family.” Yet, has Cuban ever been about the “safe” way? He has become who he is today by making dicey decisions and bold moves, eventually turning himself into a multi-millionaire. Deciding to risk everything he had built in Dallas by aiming for a splash this summer was a distinct choice by Cuban that went along with every other step he had taken up to this point in his profession. But finally, Cuban’s way caught up to him.\n\nInstead of making a splash, he is sinking. Fast.\n\nNot only did the Mavs miss out on D-Will, they have now said goodbye to their two Jasons as they both sting for their own reasons.\n\nAfter having one of his most inefficient seasons, many suspected the Mavs would let JET go. His time in town was appreciated and he would most likely have his number lifted up to the rafters later on but his time was up, according to management’s supposed intentions. To put it simply, “business is business.” The Boston Celtics jumped on the opportunity to bring in this sharpshooter, and with Ray Allen’s departure from Boston to South Beach, Terry will now become Allen’s comparable replacement.\n\nEven though this exit might have been more expected than the other, this isn’t good for Dirk. These two established a system in the Big D where they played off each other’s strengths and ran the pick-and-pop two-man game in countless waning moments of close games. Again. And again. Before Terry was with the Mavs, Dirk had an even craftier guard running this exact scheme with him night in and night out. It’s a part of Dirk’s gameplay, and he hasn’t played a season without it.\n\nThey have also been in business together for eight years while creating countless hardships and triumphs. To put it simply – they are best friends. Having that partner in crime has helped Dirk up to this point in his career since Terry took on this role right after Nash – the man formerly known as his best friend – skipped town. There is more that will be missed than what he brought off the bench.\n\nJ-Kidd might be 39 but he sure holds a special place with the Mavs. Coming back to Dallas in his elder basketball years, he instilled a valuable demeanor unlike any other. Similar to Terry, it would be good for Dirk to have a familar face to go to war with him yet again. These two have similar humble personalities and as a result, have grown close in the 4 1/2 years they have played together.\n\nIt came down to two teams for Kidd: The Mavs or the New York Knicks. They each offered him practically the same contract. All reports were leaning toward Kidd coming back to finish his career with the team that he wants to stay with once he retires.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, he decided to go to the Big Apple instead of staying in the Big D. After coming extremely close to signing with the Mavs (isn’t that becoming a prevalent theme), he did some deep contemplating while working on his golf swing. In the end, it came down to the fact that Kidd felt he had a better chance of doing big things in the latter part of his career with the Knicks than with his now former team. He looked at the rosters and simply gave the Mavs a slap to the cheek (though a polite one) in saying that they weren’t good enough for his last few years in the NBA.\n\nDirk even understands the Mavs dire situation.\n\n“When we talked, [Dirk] said to go to New York,” Kidd said.\n\nEven though this proves yet again Dirk’s genuine nature and care for his teammates even if that means losing them, this is a slap to the Mavs other cheek. Dirk couldn’t even muster up enough confidence in the only team he has ever played for to try and sway Kidd back to Dallas. When this devoted man’s faith has gone away, it is evident that Dallas has gone to a grave state.\n\nOh yeah, the Mavs also were going to try and convince Steve Nash to come back and play some basketball with his pal Dirk… that failed. He will be evolving Andrew Bynum into an even better center and taking a lot of pressure off Kobe Bryant’s shoulders. There’s no point in harping on the Mavs’ backup plan since it was quickly dashed before they could even consider it a viable option.\n\nNow the Mavs must attempt to salvage their dignity and attempt to put together a respectable team for the next NBA season. They want to be successful – right?\n\nIt appears that would be partially incorrect. With the apparent players that have caught their interest (Ummm, yeah, Ramon Sessions and Anthony Randolph are clearly high-quality pieces…) and the length they want to offer them, the Mavs are about to expand and enlarge their bridge. Bridge season version 2.0 will soon be coming to an NBA season near you. They are going to have another year in which they will simply await for that big-time free agent to walk into town. Next season, James Harden, Dwight Howard and Chris Paul are the three main names that stand out from the rest of the free agents, and Cuban has his eyes set on signing one of these All-Stars to a lucrative contract for years to come.\n\nHowever, why would these three players want to come to Dallas? If the Mavs end up with an even worse season than this last one and end their streak of 12 consecutive playoff appearances, what becomes the enticing part of playing for the Mavericks? (Having no state income tax can only go so far.) The biggest ploy for Williams to come home was the fact that he would have been coming home to a winning franchise from the past decade in its entirety. Since Cuban has taken this risky route and won’t give in until a major – and I mean major – player commits to his team, he is hurting the Mavs chances of being successful until (or simply if) this happens.\n\nAnd here’s where it gets personal: this is unfair to Dirk. Using Tyson Chandler’s words, “I feel sorry for Dirk.” He has given everything to this organization. Literally. He came over to America from Germany to play for the Mavericks and has devoted his entire life to playing the absolute best possible basketball so his team can be their absolute best. He never has put himself before the team and even put the Mavs before a major paycheck during an era of professional sports when most negotiations are solely about the big payday. This level of commitment from a superstar is a foreign concept to most fan bases and only a dream to many franchises’ owners.\n\nAs Dirk begins to head down the latter part of his career, he doesn’t want to go through many struggling seasons. He even said himself that he’s too old to rebuild. He’s right. (Also, he has been spoiled with only being a part of winning teams every year he has been in the NBA, so he knows no other way.) Cuban now will throw yet another wasted year at Dirk as the owner becomes irrationally hopeful that they can ultimately land something special even though he has something special right in front of him that will be gone before he knows it.\n\nSo here we are. It has only been 13 months since the Mavericks reached the top of the NBA world and became the reigning champs for 12 months. What about now? Their future has become the unknown. Their identify has become the undetectable. The plans for next season are in uncharted territory as free agent after free agent takes their talents to anywhere but Dallas. So far, the players that are somewhat tempted to play for the Mavs only show interest because they know they can get significant minutes with the team’s depleted roster. That is the sign of a struggling NBA franchise.\n\nThe Mavs now will play possum. They will play possum as the the rest of the top teams in the West continue to improve their squads. They will play possum in hopes of yet another breakthrough summer of free agency. They will play possum as Dirk wonders where all his teammates went once training camp beings. They will play possum as the thought of Tyson Chandler and J.J. Barea providing the ideal spark can only be that – a thought.\n\nWhen will the possum wake up from this grueling state of nature? Once Mark Cuban realizes Deron Williams and Dwight Howard are not going to be joining his team.\n\nRemember that.\n\nIgnite the Site!\n\nEven with the current NBA lockout, there has been a lot going on with the 2011 NBA Champions since they won the Larry O’Brien trophy.\n\nFollowing suit with most other NBA players worried about the upcoming season, new Maverick Rudy Fernandez has signed with Real Madrid’s basketball team. Fernandez will play in Spain during the labor talks, and the deal includes an option for him to play with Madrid once his time with the Mavs comes to an end.\n\nFernandez has been with the Blazers the past three seasons, consistently playing a sixth-man role. He played in all three of their playoff runs but struggled this past year against the Mavs, shooting just 4-18 from the field. Even with this recent struggle and decline in ppg three seasons in a row, I see Dallas as a more fitting place for Rudy. If Stevenson isn’t re-signed, the Spaniard could have a strong possibility of landing a starting spot. Whether he’s on the bench or in the starting line-up, I can see Fernandez getting back into double digit scoring when he finally puts on his Mavericks uniform.\n\nSomeone who has been in a Mavericks jersey just a bit longer than Fernandez – Dirk Nowitzki – has also discussed playing overseas but came to quite a different conclusion. Dirk feels that “the ongoing NBA lockout would have to bleed into November before he considers signing with a team in a foreign league.” It’s interesting that the most well-known foreign player in the league is the one that that appears to be the least inclined to leave America.\n\nDirk is considering taking some well-deserved time off from basketball, and I’m perfectly fine with that. He put hours and hours of work into this sport, striving for the one thing that so many critics loved to point out he didn’t have… and now he has it. It will be good for him to just relax and focus on some other things – such as some good vocal lessons – giving him a break from endlessly practicing that awkward but magnificent one-legged fadeaway jump-shot.\n\nAs for Erick Dampier – oh wait a minute…\n\nOn July 23rd, Mavericks player-representative, Jason Terry, remained optimistic regarding the upcoming season. He discussed how he wasn’t even going to look for another team; defending the Mavs NBA Championship was all he wanted to do.\n\nToday, as we approach the scheduled beginning of training camp (which has been delayed), Terry’s optimism has faded. He doesn’t expect to be in contact with coaches or teammates any time soon. The Jet now believes “it’s not looking good for us to get things started on time. Right now, at this point where we’re at, both sides are still far apart.” This pessimism towards the upcoming season does not bode well for the league because when upbeat Terry says something isn’t looking good, you know things aren’t going well.\n\nDefensive leader, Tyson Chandler, is sitting in limbo, unable to go check out other NBA squads during his free agency. Even though J.J. Barea is a fan favorite and a viable back-up point guard, Chandler has to be the Mavs first priority once the NBA gets back into the swing of things.\n\nMany have speculated that the organization is not resigning Tyson so that they can be free to pick up Deron Williams should he become available. I disagree with this “waiting game” approach because it’s risky, and it’s better to focus on what you have in front of you right now. I mean, look at what happened to all the teams that didn’t pick up LeBron! We’ll have to wait and see… well, that’s the case for almost everything right now in the NBA.\n\nDuring this past summer, the Mavs two French fries – Rodrigue Beaubois and Ian Mahinmi – have been working out together at SMU. Neither has shown any desire to play overseas.\n\nThis is pretty cool. It’s great to see athletes get together outside of their official team play. It shows how close these guys get with one another (just look at how Brian Cardinal and Dirk Nowitzki meshed throughout this past season). Hopefully, the extra work will help out with Mahinmi’s play and Beaubois’s health.\n\nThe Maverick that is hurting the most from the lockout has to be Dominique Jones. Not only does Jones need access to team trainers to rehabilitate from his season-ending injury, but he also needs more playing time on the court to improve his game. With the cancellation of the Las Vegas Summer League, a chance for him to see some minutes was taken away; however, there is some good news for the 22-year-old. Jones is one of 70 NBA players that will get to play in the Impact Basketball League which takes place in Las Vegas and lasts for two weeks, training NBA players that are itching to get on the court. Joe Abunassar, who is considered one of the top trainer’s in the world, runs this program.\n\nWith the abundance of shooting guards – Terry, Fernandez, Beaubois, and Stevenson – this training camp will be crucial for Jones if he wants any playing time in the upcoming season.\n\nAlso coming off a season-ending injury, Caron Butler has stated that he is fully recovered from his ruptured patellar tendon. He also hasn’t been ambiguous about where he wants to be and what he wants for the next season. 31-year-old Butler has expressed his interest in a multiyear deal with the Mavericks and has pointed out that he has no interest in taking his talents elsewhere. Dallas is his team.\n\nEven though it’s great that the 15.0 ppg swingman wants to be in Dallas for as long as he can, the Mavs need to be careful with the length of Caron’s contract. Knee injuries can be very detrimental to a player’s health (just look at Greg Oden the past few years), and as a result, his play on the court could diminish. Giving Butler a one or two year contract seems like the smart move to make, and then if he does indeed come back strong and ready to go, an extension can be implemented into his contract later.\n\nJ.J. Barea and Corey Brewer have both mentioned interest in playing in Spain, but neither has a solid deal in place yet. If the lockout does indeed persist, it will be interesting to see if all these players eyeing opportunities outside of the U.S. actually make a firm commitment and move to foreign countries. My gut feeling is that very few of these players will actually follow through and make the transition into euro-ball.\n\nBefore he got eliminated, Ron Artest could have had a fellow NBA player competing with him on Dancing With the Stars. According to TMZ.com, Shawn Marion was officially offered a spot on the popular show but decided not to follow in the footsteps of Mavs owner, Mark Cuban. Marion reportedly didn’t want to be tied up in the television show in case the season were to start on time. I am a little disappointed because with Marion’s stellar taste in apparel, I would have been interested to see what outfits he would have chosen to show off.\n\nThe players aren’t the only Mavericks enjoying their offseason. Rick Carlisle recently visited W.E. Greiner Exploratory Arts Academy and Middle School, and you might be surprised at what he chose to discuss with the kids.\n\nHis main point was how music can help you get through life and how it is a relaxing skill “you can take with you for a lifetime.” To no one’s surprise, “We Are the Champions” was a common song during the three hours he spent there. He even poked fun at how a piano sounds better than “certain people.” (Maybe Carlisle would agree with my suggestion for Dirk to take vocal lessons.)\n\nMany reported that the kids really took to Carlisle’s presentation. Even though some people point out how “indifferent” Carlisle seems to be on and off the court, I think this shows that he does have a personable side. To keep a group of preteens engaged for three hours is impressive and shows how entertaining he can be. The Mavericks themselves scoff at the notion that Carlisle is dull and will point out how much they enjoy playing for Rick. I’m glad to see Carlisle staying involved in the community, and it’s cool to see that he enjoyed doing it, too; however, in a few months (hopefully) he will have to spend the majority of his time focused on coaching.\n\nIgnite the Site!\n\nDear Jose Juan,\n\nHey J.J.! How have you been lately? I bet being a champion is feeling great. You seemed really excited on that plane ride home. And don’t worry, I’m sure Mark will actually get you all championship rings. You don’t know how much I love going back and watching highlights of you dominating the paint like Charles Barkley dominating the mic during this year’s playoff run. There’s just something so appealing about seeing you come into a game and give my Mavs that spark or lift that they so desperately need whenever they get off to a sluggish start. You fit into our system so well, and I couldn’t be happier that you can call yourself a champion now.\n\nBut now we have to start looking ahead. You have definitely proven yourself on the national stage, and I’m sure more than a few teams are going to be interested in adding you to their roster. Both you and your agent have made it clear that you want to stay in Dallas, but I know how these thing go (just look at what happened with Gortat and the Mavs last summer). After all, it is a business. So, let me just emphasize a couple of points that you should keep in mind before you make a decision.\n\nFirst of all, you are the quintessential “fan favorite.” The people of Dallas absolutely adore all five-foot-something of you. You are a scrappy player that will do anything to help out the team, and your energy is infectious. Even if you don’t tower above all the other players on the court, you find ways to make plays on the likes of Kobe and LeBron. I even cut out an article in the Dallas Morning News a while back that had the headline “Gutsy Barea.” Now, it’s pretty obvious that you would be a fan favorite in New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles, but let me tell you this: nothing would beat our Lone Star love.\n\nThe city itself is just great. I’ve grown up here, and this is a cool town. We’ve got everything, but somehow, it doesn’t quite have that uncomfortable, “big city” feel. The weather is…well you learn to…tolerate it. Oddly enough, I enjoy it. One of my favorite parts, though, is how incredibly lucky we are to have so many successful sports organizations running out of Big D. The Mavs, Cowboys, Rangers, and Stars make this place a sports Mecca that surpasses even New York and Los Angeles. (No wonder I have become such an ESPN-addict.)\n\nThen there’s your good buddy Mr. Cuban. For all the negatives that Mark brings upon himself (and sometimes his team), everyone can see that he is a “players” owner. I’ve heard him talk about his guys in a very personal way – sometimes getting himself a fine or two – and it really makes me appreciate what he has been able to do with the Mavs even more. Now, he is first and foremost a businessman and quite a successful one at that, but ironically I don’t think that another owner in the league cares about his players as much as he does.\n\nWell, I probably haven’t told you anything you don’t already know. If you do end up with the Lakers, Heat, or Knicks, I’ll still wear your t-shirt jersey, although there will be a period of mourning. When it comes down to it, you’re just going to have to decide what’s most important to you. Look, you’re a great player with a huge heart, and I can’t wait to be able to tell my kids that I watched “the” J.J. Barea live in the NBA Finals. I just hope the Barea era in Dallas still has many more chapters to come.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJay Wallis\n\nIgnite the Site!"
