        "text": "Tiffany Haddish chimed in on Common’s recent comments about his relationship with Jennifer Hudson.\n\nWe previously reported that during a recent interview Common talks his connection with fellow Chicagoan and lover J. Hud. “I’m going to be real real with you, like, having a lady just from Chicago allows me to go home and just be home.”\n\nHe continued: “And I hadn’t did that in a while where I was just going home and just being around my love ones and didn’t have no work to do, and that, man, I ain’t going to front, that helped me with this album because just going to your roots, you got to always recharge and replug, and plug into them roots no matter how much you’ve elevated you still got to go to them roots.”\n\n“With all due respect to all the women I’ve dated… it’s all love, but this is a really healthy and beautiful relationship…”\n\nThe clip was shared to The Shade Room. In the comment section a fan writes, “well there he said it he wants to marry her he aint neva said that about no woman b4.” In which Common’s ex, Tiffany Haddish responded, “EXACTLY! I hope they actually get married..”"
