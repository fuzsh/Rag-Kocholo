        "text": "The NBA Finals are now set between the Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks. The Celtics have been by far and away the best team all season long both throughout the regular season and in the playoffs. The Celtics have not won an NBA title in fifteen years and must win this year otherwise it will be considered a massive failure. The pressure is on the whole team but especially Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. They are both very high paid superstars who need to get a ring to help improve their overall legacy. Below is my quick take on this as seen in The Times Union:\n\nThe Boston Celtics need to win the NBA Championship or the season will be a bust. The Celtics have been the best team all season and they need to finish it with a Championship. Jayson Tatum needs to play like he's one of the best players in the league which he has been again this season. It won't be easy against the Dallas Mavericks who has the dynamic duo of Luca Doncic and Kyrie Irving and it will surprise no one if they win. But for Boston this season must end with an NBA title because you only get so many chances before you make serious changes to the roster.\n\nThis is going to be a great series as the Mavs have both Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. Kyrie's reception will be very interesting as he was a Celtic not that long ago and it didn't go so well. I do think the Celtics will win in a long and competitive NBA Finals."
