        "text": "Welp, I was planning on running a live blog of Josh Harris and Elton Brand’s presser this morning. However, the NBC Sports Philadelphia stream was not cooperating, so I could not watch it in real time. Alas, below is a collection of the most notable quotes from the session that I’ve pulled from Twitter (shout out to the hard working folks on the Philadelphia 76ers beat).\n\nJosh Harris\n\n#Sixers managing partner Josh Harris: ‘This season we had significant successes, but we’re disappointed we didn’t achieve our ultimate goal.’ — @TomMoorePhilly\n\n“Brett’s job was never in jeopardy,” Joshua Harris says — @KyleNeubeck\n\nJosh Harris said Brett Brown knew through the Toronto series that his job was not in jeopardy. — @PompeyOnSixers\n\n“There was a lot of noise in the press.. probably kicked up by our competitors? Who knows.” — @Kevin_Kinkead\n\nJoshua Harris on Brett Brown rumors:”Lots been made about this in the press, and truthfully, you can’t believe what you’re hearing.” “I have a great relationship with Brett.” — @jonjohnsonWIP\n\nHarris says team intends to be financially responsible, but is willing to use resources to pursue title:\n\n”I feel comfortable we’re committed to do what it takes to bring a championship to the City of Philadelphia.” — @brianseltzer\n\nHarris insists team will be comfortable to go into the luxury tax to win.\n\nElton Brand tempers that, saying they have to spend wisely and not just spend into the tax for the sake of doing so — @KyleNeubeck\n\nElton Brand\n\nElton on Brett Brown:\n\n”Brett should be commended, plus-50 wins, the culture he built, the adjustments he made. I am proud of the job he has done. He should be applauded.” — @brianseltzer\n\n#Sixers GM Elton Brand: ‘We have a great group, a dynamic core. I look forward to being a GM for the first time going into free agency. ... I’m highly optimistic. I look forward to this offseason.’ — @TomMoorePhilly\n\n“Brett should be commended.” “ I am proud of the job’s he’s done this season.” “He should be applauded.” - Elton Brand. — @jonjohnsonWIP\n\nBrand says he would never ask Ben Simmons not to work with his brother during *his* time away from the court, but that organization is committed to putting as many people around Ben as it takes to succeed. Laying out plans for the summer right now — @KyleNeubeck\n\nElton on Simmons:\n\n”He’s committed to getting better. His defense was elite this year. He’s only scratched the surface.” — @brianseltzer\n\nBrand saying he was very pleased with Jimmy and Tobias:\n\n”They played as expected, they brought a lot off the court and to the locker room.” — @brianseltzer\n\nBrand has stated several times to different questions about roster construction that he’s excited to be the GM for the first time in the offseason. Easy to forget he has only been doing this since September — @KyleNeubeck\n\nElton Brand referred to as a beefy big who could help Joel with advice on health, fitness, etc.\n\nBrand: “I wouldn’t call myself beefy” — @KyleNeubeck\n\nElton on Jo:\n\n”He’s one of the top players in the world. Getting that taste of being so close is only going to fuel him. It’s a gift and a curse - you lose such a tough game, but they’re fueled and ready. [His] commitment to a championship is even greater.” — @brianseltzer\n\nElton is leaving today for Chicago for this week’s combine. Says team needs players “who can player, players who can add to our team now, defensive-oriented players,” guys who can space with shooting. — @brianseltzer"
