Craft, not couture, comfortable cool, not catwalk. These dungarees are the first Joy Journal Project.\"\n\nHow long have Laura Gallacher and Russell Brand been together?\n\nRussell Brand proposed to Laura in June 2016 before tying the knot in August 2017.\n\nThe duo wed in an intimate service at Remenham Church near their home in Henley-on-Thames, Oxon.\n\nThey dated briefly in 2007 and reconnected after Russell's divorce from singer Katy Perry.\n\nHow many children do Laura Gallacher and Russell Brand have?\n\nRussell and Laura have two children together.\n\nThe couple welcomed their first daughter Mabel in November 2016 and their second, named Peggy, in July 2018.\n\nIn June 2023, Brand confirmed that his wife was pregnant with their third child.\n\nThe comic announced the news during an interview on Steven Bartlett's podcast Diary of a CEO.\n\nSteven, who is also known to fans of Dragons' Den, revealed the news on Russell's behalf, saying: \"You fell in love and you've got two children. You've got a third on the way, around the corner. That's a very special love you have found.\"\n\nIt wasn't long before Russell became emotional as he revealed how fatherhood has transformed him.\n\nHe said: \"It taught me there is a lot more important in this world than me.\"\n\nRussell added: \"There's a lot more important stuff in this world than what I want, think or reckon. It taught me that love is real. It teaches you everything to become a father. All lessons are there.\""
