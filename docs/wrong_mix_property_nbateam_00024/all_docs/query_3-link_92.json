The 2025 Hercules Tires Big South Basketball Championships are scheduled for Wednesday-Sunday, March 5-9 at 6,500-seat Freedom Hall.

The facility has played host to more than 2,500 events since its opening act featuring Bob Hope 50 years ago. Freedom Hall has served the Tri-Cities region for all forms of activities, concerts to rodeos, conventions to sports events, both local and professional. A notable event was the filming of Aerosmith's \"Ragdoll\" video.

The league's growing presence as an NCAA Division I athletic conference is made evident by its multitude of athletic accomplishments, innovative marketing and media partnerships, increased television packages and most importantly, its commitment to fostering the academic, personal, social, athletic and leadership development of its student-athletes. Comprised of nine member institutions sharing a common geographic region and similar academic values and purposes, the Big South's remarkable history of achievement is characterized by the league's 19 championship sports and the profound academic and life successes of its more than 3,200 student-athletes. This has evolved into the conference's \"Where Winners Are Made\" mantra as part of a strategic emphasis on becoming the premiere non-FBS conference in the Southeast through its six Core Values of Academic Centrality; Athletic Excellence; Equity, Diversity & Inclusion; Integrity; Sportsmanship & Fair Play; and Student-Athlete Welfare.\n\n-#MountainSouthMadness-"
