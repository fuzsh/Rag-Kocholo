        "text": "Blanket - A ClipsNation.com moniker for former Clipper Cuttino Mobley. The nickname derived from MDsr's tendency to rely heavily on Cat as a security item, like Linus and his blanket.\n\nClipperMax - ClipperSteve's 13 year old son.\n\nClipperWidow - ClipperSteve's betrothed, from the start of the NBA regular season until the Clippers are eliminated from the playoffs. We've been married a long time, but playoffs haven't been much of a problem.\n\nClipperWife - ClipperSteve's betrothed, from the Clippers elimination until the start of the next regular season.\n\nClipperZoe - ClipperSteve's 10 year old daughter.\n\nFalked - Getting Falked is what happens when you have to deal with agent David Falk. Or as FElton gushingly calls him \"the bestest agent in the whole world.\"\n\nF-BAC - Fat Bald Ass-Clown. This is the acronym assigned to NBA referee David Jones, who made the mistake of making some pretty horrible calls against the Clippers in 06-07. We don't have a lot of occasion to refer to the F-BAC, but we try to use it as much as is reasonable.\n\nF-DEC - Foreign Dude with an Expiring Contract. There were two F-DEC's on the 2006-2007 Clippers, Zeljko Rebraca and Yaroslav Korolev. Sadly they are no longer Clippers, but the F-DEC acronym lives on, because it conveys so much. The fact that they were both foreign and dudes just makes an acronym too hard to resist.\n\nFElton - This nickname does not refer to Raymond Felton of the Charlotte Bobcats. Instead, it is used to refer to former Clipper Elton Brand, who took the money and ran to Philadelphia after agreeing in principal to a new deal with the Clippers. I hope the nickname is self-explanatory, because we try to keep the bad language to a minimum around here.\n\nFSM - The Flying Spaghetti Monster, who created the universe with his noodly appendage.\n\nKaman 2.0 - Kaman 2.0 is the enhanced version of Chris Kaman, with all the new and efficient features. He rebounds! He blocks shots! He shoots a high percentage! He finishes with authority around the basket! Unfortunately, Kaman 2.0 was only available for half a season in 07-08. Apparently it was a little buggy.\n\nMBFGC - My Big Fat Greek Center, Sofoklis Schortsianitis. The Clippers second round draft pick in 2003, 34th overall, he is now 22 years old and playing for the top professional team in Greece, Olympiakos. He was impressive against NBA level opposition in the 2006 World Championships in Japan, playing a major role off the bench in Greece's Silver Medal performance. In fact, he had a big game in Greece's huge upset over Team USA, giving future Clipper teammate Elton Brand a close up look at his significant talents. Nicknamed both Baby Shaq and the Greek Shaq, he is a very big dude, though shorter than his listed 6'11\". I'd say he's closer to 6'9\". However, he is astoundingly fast and quick for someone his size, and he is a great scorer in the low post, with a nose for the basket and the ability to use his size to his advantage. The Clippers retain his NBA rights, and rumor has it that his Olympiakos contract has a reasonable $500K buyout. However, MBFGC has recently gotten bigger and fatter. He has yet to play a game for Olympiakos in the 2007-2008 season, and the club has stopped paying him based on issues with his current weight and conditioning.\n\nMDsr - Mike Dunleavy Sr. Clippers' head coach. I use MDsr for two reasons. (1) it's shorter, and of course he gets referenced a lot. (2) ballhype picks up the RSS feed of this site, and automatically adds pictures to posts. If I refer to Mike Dunleavy Sr, it adds a picture of Mike Dunleavy Jr. I got tired of seeing his face next to my words, so I avoid using the coach's full name at all costs."
