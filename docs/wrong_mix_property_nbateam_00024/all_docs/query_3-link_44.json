        "text": "Nik Stauskas joined The John Kincade Show to talk about the Philadelphia 76ers during the notorious “Process” era.\n\nThe Sixers narrowly missed out on selecting Stauskas in the 2014 NBA Draft. They entered the draft with two first-round picks, and they ultimately landed Joel Embiid and Dario Saric.\n\nA trade with the Sacramento Kings brought the Ontario native to Philadelphia in 2015. He played 159 games with the Sixers during a rough period for the franchise.\n\nAn Unforgettable “Process” Story\n\nThe 2015-16 76ers limped through one of the worst seasons in NBA history. Isaiah Canaan, Ish Smith, and Hollis Thompson didn’t exactly make up the core of a playoff contender.\n\nHowever, they signed 36-year-old Elton Brand out of retirement during the season.\n\nThe tanking reached cringeworthy levels in 2015-16. The Sixers went 1-25 from Jan. 27-April 2. When they stood with nine wins in the final weeks of the season, losing out and finishing tied for the worst record in NBA history looked entirely possible.\n\nAn accomplished veteran and former first-overall pick like Brand wasn’t accustomed to writing off losses for the sake of NBA Draft Lottery odds.\n\nHe didn’t want younger players or anyone else in the organization to accept it either. He even made a banner telling them so.\n\n“We come into the locker room one day. This is when we were still at PCOM. There’s a huge banner in the locker room, and it says, ‘Congratulations 2015-16 Philadelphia 76ers…Worst Record in NBA History.’ It says like 9-73, so it was basically projecting that we would lose the rest of our games. Then, underneath the banner was just the names of every person in the organization.” -Nik Stauskas\n\nStauskas said that Brand was demanding his teammates to keep his name from association with the worst record in NBA history.\n\nAn April matchup with the New Orleans Pelicans loomed. Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday didn’t dress for a team that ultimately finished 30-52. The lowly Sixers scratched and clawed for a 107-93 victory.\n\nThe Sixers finished 2-15 in games that Elton Brand played in 2015-16. However, their 10th win overall kept Brand, Stauskas, and the Process out of the record books.\n\nIt was a forgettable era in franchise history, but at least they got a cool story out of it.\n\nWatch the full interview to hear Nik Stauskas talk more about “The Process,” the 2023-24 Sixers, his days with Bob Cooney at the practice facility, and his solid Brett Brown impression.\n\nWatch The John Kincade Show live on the 97.5 The Fanatic YouTube page on weekday mornings from 6am-10am.\n\nMeet the 2023-24 Philadelphia 76ers"
