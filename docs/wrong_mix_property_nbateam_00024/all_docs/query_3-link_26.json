        "text": "Philadelphia 76ers General manager Elton Brand held a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, addressing the organization’s decision to move on from long-time head coach Brett Brown.\n\n“Brett was a great friend. He is a great friend. He’ll always be family. He’s guided this team through a lot of adversity and challenges, and he’s helped develop some of the game’s youngest and brightest, talented players,” Brand said. “We underperformed. I felt it was time for a new voice, a new perspective.\n\n“We’ll begin a search for a new head coach immediately. I’ll also be conducting an evaluation of the front office and that infrastructure.”\n\nThe second part of that last quote is perhaps the most interesting. The coach, while important, is only a part of the reason the Sixers aren’t true, legitimate title contenders. The coaching aspect becomes crucially important when it’s Game 7 of a knock-down, drag-out series against the Milwaukee Bucks, fighting for the right to compete for an NBA title.\n\nBut we’re not there. Not even close. We’re debating how crucial Alec Burks was to the Sixers’s chances of beating Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker. The Sixers weren’t true contenders because of a sustained series of front office missteps and miscalculations that have occurred over the past few years.\n\nThe Sixers players aren’t good enough to win an NBA title, and the people who selected the players didn’t do a good enough job to get them there. Addressing those shortcomings is step one towards getting the team back on track.\n\nOne theme that consistently came up during Brand’s comments on the front office restructuring is that the Sixers needed more basketball people within the organization.\n\n“I felt like we need to strengthen our organization from top to bottom,” Brand said. “That starts with the front office also, so balancing our strengths with analytics and strategy with more basketball minds.”\n\nBrand would later go on to say that “we’re strong in a strategic and analytic standpoint. Get some more basketball minds in here,” when asked what he’s looking for to bolster the front office.\n\nMaking analytics the bogeyman is a strange turn of events, given the nature of the decisions which have backfired over the past couple of years.\n\nFor example, for most of his career Jimmy Butler has been an analytics darling, coming in sixth in ESPN’s real plus-minus in 2016-17 and 11th in 2017-18, with Butler averaging a +5.4 box plus-minus in the four years leading up to when the Sixers declined to offer him a five-year max contract extension last summer.\n\nTobias Harris, by contrast, ranked 126th, 127th, 80th and 178th, in the four years leading up to the Sixers’ decision to offer him $180 million last summer, with a box plus-minus of just 1.7 during that span.\n\nIt’s tough to paint analytics with a broad brush, since what data is valued and how that’s applied changes from analyst to analyst, much less from organization to organization. But for the most part, analytics have been front and center in ushering in the modern pace-and-space NBA, prioritizing shooting and floor spacing while eschewing post-up play and midrange jumpers\n\nThe Sixers don’t have an abundance of shooting or floor spacing. They do have an almost unhealthy obsession with midrange jumpers and post-up scorers.\n\nIt’s not as though the Sixers took Josh Richardson and Tobias Harris and turned them into midrange jump shooters. That was in their DNA when they got here. It’s also not common for analytics to tell you to run two post-up centers in the starting lineup, like the Sixers did with Horford and Embiid.\n\nIt’s one thing to say that the Sixers could use more people with the perspective of that of an NBA lifer, or another up-and-comer who played the game. Someone like longtime NBA player Mike Dunleavy Jr., now the assistant general manager for the Golden State Warriors who grew up the son of a longtime NBA player, and coach, Mike Dunleavy Sr., is viewed by many around the league as an up-and-comer. He, or someone of his background, would certainly have a valuable perspective to add to the Sixers’ decision-making apparatus.\n\nBut pinning the Sixers’ blunders over the past few years as being analytically driven seems more than a bit of a stretch.\n\nTwo years ago the Sixers moved on from Bryan Colangelo, who had become entangled in a scandal involving burner Twitter accounts tied to his wife, which left the team without a lead basketball executive.\n\nThe Sixers had just come off a 52-win season and a surprise run to the Eastern Conference Semifinals and were led by franchise players Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, who were just 24 and 21 years old at the time. To add on to that enviable position, the Sixers had room to sign a max contract free agent that summer, which led them to openly court LeBron James and Paul George, and also possessed a number of valuable trade assets to help facilitate a deal.\n\nTypically when a lead basketball executive job becomes available the team is either bad, asset poor, or both. The Sixers were the inverse of that. This situation was unique, and managing partner Josh Harris wasn’t afraid to admit it.\n\n“This is, if not the most, one of the most attractive jobs in the NBA,” Harris said at the Las Vegas Summer League in July 2018. “I feel like we’ll have a line outside the door of people that want to do it, and it’s a question of finding the right person.”\n\nDespite having such an attractive opening, the Sixers wound up hiring someone in Brand who was the least experienced general manager in the league, having just joined the ranks of a basketball executive in August 2017, barely more than a year before he became the general manager of the 76ers.\n\n“I was a rookie, thrust in a position to lead a team with championship aspirations that the fan base had sacrificed and struggled for some years. My understanding of the game grew,” Brand said on Tuesday about getting the job back in 2018. “I’ll admit I didn’t know a lot (back then), but now I do know a lot more and I’ve been through almost every situation there is, so I’m looking forward to leading this offseason and figuring out how to get us back on the right path.”\n\nDuring the interview on Tuesday, Brand admitted that his autonomy at the start of his Sixers’ tenure was less than that of a typical lead executive.\n\nPart of the justification for hiring an almost entirely inexperienced Brand less than two years ago was that the Sixers had an All-Star cast of executives remaining from Bryan Colangelo’s time in Philadelphia, and they would collaborate towards decisions, filling in the gap in Brand’s experience. “We have a great team. Alex (Rucker) and Ned (Cohen) and Elton (Brand) and Marc (Eversley) and Brett (Brown), and ownership participating, so finding the right person that’s going to fit in and make it better is going to be complicated,” Harris said at the time.\n\nYet, on Tuesday, Brand admitted that didn’t work out.\n\n“To be clear, and frank, we feel that the collaboration days didn’t work too well. So I will be leading this (coaching) search,” Brand said. “I’ve grown as a leader. I’ve grown as a general manager. I was put into the fire, I had some tough decisions to be a part of, but now I’m looking forward to putting my stamp on this team and taking full accountability for whatever happens next.”\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nBrand essentially admitted that he wasn’t ready for the job when he was hired, which is understandable given he had virtually no experience at the time. It was unfair of the Sixers to even put him in that position. And everyone sort of knew at the time that he wasn’t ready for the job, but the argument the Sixers made to justify that decision was that the All-Star cast of executives they already had in place could help fill in the gaps missing from Brand’s lack of experience.\n\nNow Brand is saying he needs to replace some, or all, of that All-Star cast of front office executives, the group that the owner argued at the time was too good to break up, the front office that Brand leaned on during the early part of his tenure which justified why Brand was quite literally learning on the job, he’s now claiming that they weren’t good enough.\n\nHe’s saying that he’s ready to take that next step and assume more autonomy in the decision-making process, even if the last two years of decision-making have been one costly self-inflicted wound after another, resulting in a team that doesn’t seem to make too much sense on the basketball court, and one that will be tough to reconfigure. And fans have to trust that he’s the one to lead the team out of the hole that they’ve dug, despite not having much evidence to point to over the last two years to show what he’s capable of.\n\nPerhaps this is all unfair to Brand. Perhaps he had really great ideas on how to build this team two years ago, and he just didn’t have enough autonomy at the beginning, and he made mistakes listening to the people underneath him, people who he didn’t have a hand in hiring him in the first place.\n\nPerhaps he is the quickest learning league executive in NBA history, and, despite only two years of experience, he’s truly ready to be the undisputed lead decision-maker on a team with NBA championship aspirations, but a team that will need him to deftly maneuver to get out of the horrendous contracts he handed out to players that don’t fit the team’s two stars. Perhaps once he hires his own staff everything will start to take shape, and the team will get back on track.\n\nBut that requires a pretty big leap of faith, and is a tough sell for a fan base that is as frustrated as Philadelphia is now.\n\n(Photo: Mitchell Leff / Getty Images)"
