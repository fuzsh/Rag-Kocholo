        "text": "More Mavs absences, though this comes with a far better \"excuse\". Per Dwain Price:\n\nDallas plays the Toronto Raptors in Dallas at the AAC, tip time at 8:30 eastern, 7:30 central. So, they will be without their first and second leading rebounders tonight. Should be fun!\n\nI expect we'll see Chris Kaman's first start of the season, next to Brandan Wright. We'll probably also see a lot more of Troy Murphy('s nose), and maybe even a little more Bernard James. The real question is, who will start next to Kaman and Wright, taking Shawn Marion's spot? Rick Carlisle has shown a fondness for Vince Carter in the \"bench scorer\" role, so perhaps we'll get Jae Crowder's first career start, as well.\n\nBe sure to check back here for all your Mavs news, chat it up during the action, and stick around for post-game recap and analysis."
