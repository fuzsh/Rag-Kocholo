Additionally, he is also a founding member and president of Gibraltar Films, a company engaged in film investment, acquisition, production, and distribution of motion pictures.\n\nAlongside his NBA career, he was part of the US National team for several years, including the team’s last loss up to date, against Greece in 2006."
