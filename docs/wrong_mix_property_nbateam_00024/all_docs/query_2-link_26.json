        "text": "Paul George is having quite the start to his $212 million offseason.\n\nShortly after news broke that the former Clipper agreed to a four-year, $212 million contract with the Philadelphia 76ers in NBA free agency, George’s wife, Daniela Rajic, posted a cozy snap of the couple against a scenic backdrop from what appears to be a recent getaway.\n\nCaptioning the Instagram Story, “ILY,” Rajic is seen next to George, 34, at a table that boasted a waterview.\n\nGeorge also reposted the photo to his Instagram Story.\n\nIt came after the Clippers said in a statement on Sunday that George — a nine-time NBA All-Star who spent the past five seasons in Los Angeles — informed the organization he was signing his next contract with another team.\n\nHis four-year max contract with the Sixers, which ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski first reported Monday morning, includes a player option on the final season in 2027-28.\n\nGeorge reportedly met with team brass — including Sixers owner Josh Harris, top basketball executive Daryl Morey, 76ers legend Julius Erving, general manager Elton Brand and executive vice president of basketball operations Peter Dinwiddie — at his home in Los Angeles Sunday night after returning from a vacation to Mexico.\n\nThe All-NBA forward, who was wearing an Allen Iverson T-shirt during the meeting, was Philadelphia’s No. 1 target in free agency, according to ESPN.\n\nNow, Paul and his family will leave his native California for the East Coast.\n\nRajic enjoyed a recent trip to the Hamptons, as seen in photos on her Instagram.\n\n“Out east,” she captioned her post.\n\n“Where you belong lol,” Kendra Randle, the wife of Knicks star Julius Randle, wrote in the comments.\n\nPaul and Rajic, who began dating in 2013, got engaged in November 2020 before tying the knot in an intimate California ceremony in June 2022.\n\nThe couple share three children together: Olivia, 10, Natasha, 7, and 2-year-old Paul, Jr.\n\n“I’m happy,” George previously told The Post while discussing his family life off of the court. “I feel complete. I feel wholesome. I feel like I’m in control of my life and what’s going on. I’m in control of how I want my kids to be. I’m in control of who I am as a father and as a husband. I mean, life is just beautiful for me.”\n\nGeorge went on to explain that a turning point for him came when he realized there’s more to life than just basketball.\n\n“I think now I view [life] so much differently,” he said. “Life is bigger than basketball. I’ve got kids to worry about, I have my family to worry about.\n\n“… Every morning I get to wake up, I get to be the father of three unbelievable kids, the husband of an amazing wife. That’s just kind of how I live from a day to day standpoint. I want to do everything the best and want to make them the proudest that I can. And, to be honest, that was the changing point that brought me a lot of peace.”\n\nIn 74 regular-season games for the Clippers last season, George averaged 22.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.5 assists.\n\nHe shot career-highs of 47.1 percent from the field, 41.3 percent from beyond the arc and 90.7 percent from the free-throw line."
