        "text": "For several decades, the McDonald's All American Games have elevated the best high school basketball players into the next generation of greats, where new aspirations are born and dreams are realized.\n\nBefore the McDonald’s All American Games came to be, Bob Geoghan founded the Capital Classic, played annually in Washington, D.C. The showcase pitted the best of the best in high school boys basketball from the D.C. region against those from around the country.\n\nWith his love for the basketball showcase and his desire to expand it, Geoghan took his big idea to Bob Beavers, regional Vice President in Baltimore at the time and first Black executive at McDonald’s. He thought a partnership with McDonald’s would be a great opportunity to broaden the scope of the game and give it longevity.\n\nElsewhere, Morgan Wootten also had ties to both basketball and McDonald’s. So much so that during his high school coaching career, he’d arrive at the McDonald’s halfway between his house and DeMatha Catholic High School every day at 11:50 to order lunch by noon. Following practice, he’d head back to McDonald’s with his empty cup, pull up to the drive-thru and say, “Just Coach Wootten getting a refill.”\n\nIn 1977, Bob Geoghan went to Morgan Wootten and John Wooden to discuss taking a high school showcase to the next level, following his pitch to McDonald’s. This universal love for the Golden Arches coupled with a love for the game of basketball helped spark the creation of what we know affectionately today as the McDonald’s All American Games.\n\nThe McDonald’s All American Games is where hype becomes legacy.\n\nThe McDonald's All American Games features the game’s brightest stars from all over the country going head-to-head—East vs. West. The inaugural McDonald’s All American Games was the nation’s first high school basketball event of its kind and played in front of a crowd of 13,000 fans at The Spectrum in Philadelphia, PA.\n\nBut the Games are not just about basketball. Bob wanted to incorporate a charitable component into the Games experience. The trio loved the idea of players giving back to something “bigger than themselves” and born out of this desire was the relationship between McDonald’s All American Games and the Ronald McDonald House Charities, the non-profit organization that creates, finds, and supports programs that directly improve the health and well-being of children and their families.\n\nForty-five years later, the McDonald’s All American Games is the pinnacle of high school basketball. Each year ushers a new group of young players into a club of legendary athletes, many of whom are known by a single name: Magic, Jordan, Kobe, Shaq, Lebron, Candace, A’ja. The best of the best have donned a jersey featuring the iconic Golden Arches.\n\nThe McDonald’s All American court is where hype meets heritage. Where an 18-year-old shares a spot with the greatest players to ever touch a basketball. It’s a status no one can take away from them—they’ve earned this prestige."
