According to a report from Yahoo Sports, the Sixers will sign veteran forward Elton Brand today.

According to Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports, the Sixers plan to sign veteran forward Elton Brand.

The Sixers will release rookie Christian Wood to make room for Brand on the roster, according to a source.

Brand, drafted 1st overall in 1999, spent time with five franchises during his 16-year NBA career. A two-time All-Star, Brand averaged 16.1 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per game for his career.

Brand signed a five-year contract with the 76ers in the summer of 2008 worth a reported $80 million. He spent four years with the Sixers from 2008-09 through 2011-12, appearing in 246 games with the Sixers, averaging 13.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.3 blocked shots per game. Brand was released using the amnesty provision in the summer of 2012.

After leaving the 76ers Brand signed with the Dallas Mavericks, where he averaged 7.2 points and 6.0 rebounds in 72 appearances. He finished his career with a two-year stint in Atlanta, averaging just 19.4 and 13.5 minutes per game during his final two seasons.

Brand, who up until this point had not landed with a team after becoming a free agent last offseason, will turn 37 later this year.

Brand spent his first two seasons in Chicago, winning the Rookie of the Year Award in 2000, but was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers for the draft rights to Tyson Chandler during the 2001 draft. Brand had some of his best years with the Clippers, including the 2005-06 season where he averaged 24.7 points, 10.0 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 2.5 blocks per game.

Elton Brand confirmed that he would be joining the 76ers by posting an article on SI’s The Cauldron.

“You might’ve noticed we’ve got a pretty talented kid on the roster in Jahlil Okafor, someone I happen to share some things in common with. Despite how he’s been portrayed, I know Jahlil. He’s a good kid with a good heart. He’s not unlike most 20-year-olds you probably know, and he’s definitely not at all different than most of his fellow players.

I’m not coming here to hold Jahlil’s hand — or anyone else’s, for that matter — because that’s not what he needs. But I do believe my experience and wisdom can benefit him and my other young teammates. It’s about communicating with them like men, starting to grow together, and — hopefully, eventually — winning some ballgames. That’s what Sam Hinkie and I talked about when he approached me about joining the team, and what has me so excited about this opportunity.

It’s not like I didn’t have options after no one signed me last summer. I was offered a front-office job. I passed on TV gigs and other media opportunities. But as an athlete who wasn’t quite ready not to be an athlete, nothing really felt like the right move.”
