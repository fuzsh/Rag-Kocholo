        "text": "Specific mutations in the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) correlate with local recurrence in sporadic desmoid tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nLazar, Alexander J F; Tuvin, Daniel; Hajibashi, Shohrae; Habeeb, Sultan; Bolshakov, Svetlana; Mayordomo-Aranda, Empar; Warneke, Carla L; Lopez-Terrada, Dolores; Pollock, Raphael E; Lev, Dina\n\n2008-11-01\n\nDesmoid fibromatosis is a rare, nonmetastatic neoplasm marked by local invasiveness and relentless recurrence. Molecular determinants of desmoid recurrence remain obscure. beta-Catenin deregulation has been commonly identified in sporadic desmoids although the incidence of CTNNB1 (the gene encoding beta-catenin) mutations is uncertain. Consequently, we evaluated the prevalence of CTNNB1 mutations in a large cohort of sporadic desmoids and examined whether mutation type was relevant to desmoid outcome. Desmoid specimens (195 tumors from 160 patients, 1985 to 2005) and control dermal scars were assembled into a clinical data-linked tissue microarray. CTNNB1 genotyping was performed on a 138-sporadic desmoid subset. Immunohistochemical scoring was performed per standard criteria and data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and other indicated methods. CTNNB1 mutations were observed in 117 of 138 (85%) of desmoids. Three discrete mutations in two codons of CTNNB1 exon 3 were identified: 41A (59%), 45F (33%), and 45P (8%, excluded from further analysis because of rarity). Five-year recurrence-free survival was significantly poorer in 45F-mutated desmoids (23%, P < 0.0001) versus either 41A (57%) or nonmutated tumors (65%). Nuclear beta-catenin expression was observed in 98% of specimens and intensity was inversely correlated with incidence of desmoid recurrence (P < 0.01). In conclusion, CTNNB1 mutations are highly common in desmoid tumors. Furthermore, patients harboring CTNNB1 (45F) mutations are at particular risk for recurrence and therefore may especially benefit from adjuvant therapeutic approaches.\n\nA case of desmoid tumor co-existing with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma in the larynx.\n\nPubMed\n\nShinohara, Shogo; Suehiro, Atsushi; Kikuchi, Masahiro; Harada, Hiroyuki; Kishimoto, Ippei; Imai, Yukihiro\n\n2017-06-01\n\nExtra-abdominal desmoid tumor, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, has aggressive behavior with local infiltration and tendency for recurrence. Though head and neck is reported to be one of the most common sites, a desmoid tumor in the larynx is extremely rare. A 67-year-old male visited our hospital with prolonged hoarseness and received laryngo-microsurgery with the diagnosis of laryngeal polyp. After the operation, he eventually developed a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with papilloma, confirmed by second laryngo-microsurgery and received radiation therapy. After the third laryngo-microsurgery to remove residual papilloma, white irregular mass appeared on the right vocal cord and grew rapidly beneath the glottis, causing dyspnea. After 2 additional laryngo-microsurgeries, he was diagnosed having the dermoid tumor co-existing with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma. He underwent near-total laryngectomy and is currently alive without disease, speaking using a vocal shunt. Only five cases of the desmoid tumors arising in the adult larynx have been reported in the English literature. In this case, repeated surgery and radiation were suspected as the causes. Also, the present report is the first to describe desmoid tumor co-existing with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma in the larynx. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We sought to compare the characteristics and treatment of sporadic and FAP-related desmoid-type fibromatoses. Altogether 220 patients were included in the study after receiving a diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis by the Pathology Department of Helsinki University Hospital, with adequate follow-up. Patients were included from January 1, 1980 until April 30, 2015. FAP-related tumors were found in 22 (10%) patients. FAP-related desmoid-type fibromatoses were larger, more commonly multiple, and more often intra-abdominally situated. Surgery was the treatment of choice for 179 (90%) of the sporadic patients and for 18 (82%) of FAP-related patients. Resections with non-involved margins (R0) were more common in sporadic desmoid-type fibromatoses (55% vs. 23%, Pâ=â0.048). The risk of recurrence was 25% in sporadic- and 44% in the FAP-related group. Three (14%) patients with FAP-related desmoid-type fibromatoses died from the disease. The predictors for FAP occurrence among desmoid tumor patients are large tumor size, intra-abdominal location, multiple tumors, and patient's young age. Desmoid-type fibromatosis patients suffer a high recurrence rate, also among those experiencing sporadic tumors, but the risk of death due to the tumor is low. Conversely, desmoid disease represents a substantial cause of death among FAP patients.

It develops about 1:1000 times more in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP, Gardner syndrome) compared to normal population. It has been shown in molecular genetic examinations, that different mutations of the APC gene are responsible for desmoid tumors in FAP. It means, that this disease is one of the extraintestinal manifestations of Gardner syndrome. This tumor has high recurrence rate and is growing rapidly, and as a result it is the second most common cause of death in FAP patients. That is why genetic examination for FAP patients is advised to decide if the patient has higher risk for desmoid formation. If the result of the genetic test is positive, it is advisable to try to slow the progression of polyposis with medical treatment, and so to delay the date of the colectomy because the surgical intervention--and connective tissue damage--can induce desmoid formation in these patients. At the same time it is reasonable to examine and regularly control patients with sporadic desmoid tumors searching for other manifestations of Gardner syndrome (colon, stomach and duodenum polyposis, tumor of papilla Vateri, retinopathy, etc.). Palliative surgery is not indicated in patients with inoperable intraabdominal desmoid tumors, because partial resections (R1, R2, debulking) result in further tumor progression. In these patients medical treatment (sulindac, tamoxifen), chemotherapy (doxorubicin, dacarbazin) and radiotherapy or combination of them can result tumor remission. We describe our three patients (an abdominal wall desmoid four years following Cesarean section; a desmoid tumor in the retroperitoneum and in the pelvis diagnosed three years after total colectomy; and a retroperitoneal and abdominal wall desmoid one year after total colectomy) and etiology, diagnosis and therapy of desmoid tumors are discussed.\n\nNationwide trends in the current management of desmoid (aggressive) fibromatosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nEastley, N C; Hennig, I M; Esler, C P; Ashford, R U\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe optimal management of desmoid fibromatosis remains unclear, leading to significant variability in patient management. To assess this problem, the current approach of clinicians managing this complex condition in the UK was investigated. A hypothetical case of intramuscular limb girdle desmoid fibromatosis in a fit 65-year-old patient was devised. Surgical and non-surgical oncology members of the British Sarcoma Group were questioned on how they would manage this case in three scenarios: primary disease with function-sparing surgery possible, primary disease with neurovascular involvement and disease recurrence after a previous R0 resection. Initial management, management of symptomatic disease progression, follow-up preferences and any differences in respondents' management choices in a younger case were investigated. The responses from 14 sarcoma surgeons and 23 oncologists (14 clinical, nine medical) were analysed. Desmoid fibromatosis management is generally shared by surgeons and oncologists within sarcoma multidisciplinary teams in the UK. Variation exists in the chosen initial management of primary desmoid fibromatosis in the UK, with function-sparing surgery possible (observation 51%, resection 51%), primary desmoid fibromatosis with neurovascular involvement (hormone therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 51%, radiotherapy 27%, observation 22%) and for cases of desmoid fibromatosis recurrence (radiotherapy 41%, hormone therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 27%, observation 24%). There was a clear preference of surgical resection of symptomatic disease progression in cases of primary desmoid fibromatosis without neurovascular involvement (60%). By contrast, radiotherapy was the preferred treatment for progression in cases with neurovascular involvement (47%) or cases of recurrence after a previous R0 resection (34%). Clinical follow-up was selected 3 months after intervention in 68% of scenarios. Follow-up imaging was selected 3\n\nHigh cyclin A expression, but not Ki67, is associated with early recurrence in desmoid tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantti, Kirsi; Ihalainen, Hanna; RÃ¶nty, Mikko; BÃ¶hling, Tom; Karlsson, Christina; Haglund, Caj; Tarkkanen, Maija; Blomqvist, Carl\n\n2018-06-07\n\nDesmoid tumors are soft-tissue tumors originating from myofibroblasts with a tendency to recur after surgery. High expression of proliferation markers is associated with shortened progression-free and/or overall survival in many neoplasms, including soft-tissue sarcomas. We investigated the prognostic role of cyclin A and Ki67 in desmoid tumors by immunohistochemistry. The study included 76 patients with desmoid tumor operated at Helsinki University Hospital between 1987 and 2011. A tissue micro array (TMA) was constructed and the TMA sections were immunostained with cyclin A and Ki67 antibodies. A computer-assisted image analysis was performed. Cyclin A expression was evaluable in 74 and Ki67 in 70 patients. Cyclin A immunopositivity varied from 0% to 9.9%, with a mean of 1.9%. Cyclin A expression correlated significantly with Ki67. Cyclin A expression was associated with recurrence-free survival (HR 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1-3.2, P = .02), as were positive margin (HR 6.0, 95% CI = 1.6-22.5, P = .008) and extremity location (HR 5.3, 95% CI = 1.7-16.8, P = 0.005). Ki67 immunopositivity varied from 0.33% to 13.8%, with a mean of 4.6%, but had no significant prognostic impact (HR 1.1, P = .2). Our study indicates that cyclin A may be a new prognostic biomarker in surgically treated desmoid tumors.

Complete surgical resection is the primary treatment for resectable desmoid tumors, but a high rate of local recurrence has been reported even after complete resection. For patients with a recurrent tumor, the goals of treatment are to control the recurrence, maintain quality of life, and prolong survival. Radiofrequency ablation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and other medical therapies can be used as alternative methods, but there are considerable controversies over the roles of these methods in the management of desmoid tumors. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive and effective method for treatment of solid tumors. We used HIFU to treat four patients with intra-abdominal desmoid tumors from June 2011 to September 2013. Post-procedural pain was seen in all patients. One patient had an intra-abdominal abscess and another suffered a slight injury to the femoral nerve. The patients were followed up for 19-46 months (mean 34 months) until April 2015. The tumor in one patient disappeared, and no tumor progression was observed in the other patients.\n\nLong-term outcome of sporadic and FAP-associated desmoid tumors treated with high-dose selective estrogen receptor modulators and sulindac: a single-center long-term observational study in 134 patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nQuast, Daniel Robert; Schneider, Ralph; Burdzik, Emanuel; Hoppe, Steffen; MÃ¶slein, Gabriela\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of long-term conservative treatment with sulindac and high-dose selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for sporadic and FAP-associated desmoid tumors. Desmoids are very rare tumors in the general population but occur frequently in FAP patients, being encountered in 23-38 %. Treatment of desmoids is still most controversial since response cannot be predicted and they are prone to develop recurrence. This study included all desmoid patients that were treated and followed at our institution and had completed at least 1 year of treatment. Response was defined as stable size or regression of desmoid size between two CT or MRI scans. A total of 134 patients were included. 64 (47.8 %) patients had a confirmed diagnosis of FAP, 69 (51.5 %) patients were sporadic. Overall 114 (85.1 %) patients showed regressive or stable desmoid size. Patients with previous history of multiple desmoid-related surgeries showed less-favorable response. The mean time to reach at least stable size was 14.9 (Â±9.1) months. After regression or stabilization, medication was tapered in 69 (60.5 %) of the treated patients with only one long-term recurrence after >10 years. The results of this study fortify the role of sulindac and high-dose SERMs as an effective and safe treatment for both, sporadic and FAP-associated desmoid tumors. While invasive treatment frequently results in high recurrence rates, high morbidity and high mortality, this conservative treatment is successful in most patients. The recurrence rate is negligible with no desmoid-related mortality in this large series. Therefore surgical resection, especially for mesenteric desmoids, should be deferred favoring this convincingly effective, well tolerated regimen.\n\nDesmoid tumor of posterior cruciate ligament of the knee: a case report\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Desmoid tumor is a rare type of cancer that develops in the tissues that form tendons and ligaments. These tumors, also called aggressive fibromatosis, are considered benign with no metastatic potential. They may invade nearby tissues and organs, however, and can be difficult to control. Desmoid tumor in the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) of the knee has never been described in the literature. Case presentation A 49-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of posteromedial knee dull pain and decreased range of motion of the knee. He was diagnosed desmoid tumor of posterior cruciate ligament of the knee by intraoperative biopsy, and underwent successful PCL resection and reconstruction by Four-strand semitendinosus and gracilis tendon autograft arthroscopically, and fortunately five years after operation, there were no clues as to recurrence of the tumor examined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Conclusion Desmoid tumor is characterized by infiltrative growth and a tendency towards recurrence,as this tumor entity is rare, data giving evidence based recommendations for the optimal treatment algorithm for this disease is lacking. At present there is no definite and effective method of treatment. However, early detection of the tumor play an important role, MRI is now the most important method for the detection of tumor extent, which facilitates the treatment choice as well as the prediction of prognosis. In our case, we followed-up the patient five years postoperatively by MRI and got a good result.

Studies have shown that dacarbazine (DTIC)-doxorubicin (DOX) (D-D) therapy is the most effective treatment. However, myelosuppression is a major problem, and cardiac muscle disorders due to DOX limit the number of administration cycles, whereas it usually requires a long time to achieve tumor shrinkage. To resolve these issues, we introduced low-dose D-D therapy to 3 patients employing 50 mg/mÂ² DOX and 600-700 mg/mÂ² DTIC per cycle, which permits repeated administration cycles up to 10-11 times. Case 1 was a 23-year-old female with a sporadic recurrent mesenterium desmoid tumor located in the pelvis (maximum diameter, 8 cm). Cases 2 and 3 were a 33-year-old female and a 36-year-old male. Both patients had intra-abdominal mesenterium desmoid tumors (maximum diameter 9.6 and 9.0 cm, respectively) that were generated after proctocolectomy due to familial adenomatous polyposis. No severe adverse events occurred during the therapy. With the aid of sulindac and tamoxifen after low-dose D-D therapy, the first two patients achieved a complete response, and the third patient achieved a partial response and awaits further tumor shrinkage. Our experience indicates that low-dose DT-D therapy is a safe and effective regimen for patients with intra-abdominal desmoid tumors.\n\nGenetics Home Reference: desmoid tumor\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... in my area?

Surgery is widely accepted as the first line of treatment for extra-abdominal desmoids; however, it is not recommended for intra-abdominal desmoids because of the high-risk of recurrence and difficulties with the operation. Here, we report on a patient with sporadic intra-abdominal desmoid tumours, who showed partial response following the intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Case presentation A 73-year-old man presented with swelling and pain of the right leg. Computed tomography showed an abnormal multilocular soft-tissue mass (95 Ã 70 mm) in the right pelvis, which was revealed by biopsy to be a desmoid tumour. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumour cells expressed vimentin, but not smooth-muscle actin, CD34, or desmin. Very few Ki-67-positive cells were found. Non-cytotoxic treatment with etodolac (200 mg/day) was chosen because of the patient's age, lack of bowel obstruction, and the likelihood of prostate cancer. Two years after the commencement of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration, computed tomography showed a decrease in tumour size (63 Ã 49 mm), and the disappearance of intratumoural septa. Conclusion Our case report suggests that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment should be taken into consideration for use as first-line treatment in patients with sporadic intra-abdominal desmoid tumours.

This is a benign mesenchymal tumour that develops from muscular fasciae and aponeuroses. It is characterized by its local evolution and its tendency to relapse without metastasizing. Wide radical resection should be attempted whenever possible. Positive margins at resection and reoperation are associated with a high risk of local recurrence. The role of radiotherapy and of medical treatments- especially anti-estrogens - remains unclear. We report here the case of desmoid tumour of the breast arising in a 9-year-old little girl.

The impact of microscopic surgical margin status according to the Enneking classification system is discussed controversially. Therefore, the authors screened the published literature for reliable data on the importance of a wide or radical excision of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. All studies with more than ten patients, a surgical treatment only, and margin status stated were included. Only 12 out of 49 identified studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One hundred fifty-two primary tumors were excised with wide or radical microscopic surgical margins, while in 260 cases a marginal or intralesional excision was performed. In the first group 41 patients (27%) and in the second one 187 patients (72%) developed a recurrence. Therefore, microscopic surgical margin status according to the Enneking classification system is a significant prognostic factor (P < 0.001). The data of this review underline the strategy of a wide or radical local excision as the treatment of choice. Furthermore, as a large number of studies had to be excluded from this analysis, exact microscopic surgical margin status should be provided in future studies in order to allow comparability. .

They are soft tissue monoclonal neoplasms that originate from mesenchymal stem cells. It seems that the hormonal and immunological changes occurring during pregnancy may play a role in the severity and course of the disease. The case is presented on 28-year-old female in her fifth week of gestation, in whom an abdominal wall tumour was found attached to left adnexa and uterus while performing a prenatal ultrasound. The patient was followed up under clinical and ultrasonographic surveillance. When she presented with abnormal uterine activity at 38.2 weeks of gestation, she was admitted and obstetrics decided to perform a caesarean section. Tumour biopsy was taken during the procedure. Histopathology reported a desmoid fibromatosis. A contrast enhanced abdominal computed tomography scan was performed, showing a tumour of 26Ã20.5Ã18cm, with well-defined borders in contact with the uterus, left adnexa, bladder and abdominal wall, with no evidence of infiltration to adjacent structures. A laparotomy, with tumour resection, hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy, components separation techniques, polypropylene mesh insertion, and drainage was performed. The final histopathology report was desmoid fibromatosis. There is no evidence of recurrence after 6 months follow-up. Desmoid tumours are locally aggressive and surgical resection with clear margins is the basis for the treatment of this disease, using radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy as an adjunct in the treatment.

The inflammatory process is considered to be progressive and may lead to strictures, fistulas, and penetrating disease that may require surgery. In addition, medically refractory disease may be treated by surgical resection of inflamed bowel in an effort to reverse growth failure. The need for surgery in childhood suggests severe disease and these patients have an increased risk for recurrent disease and potentially more surgery. Data show that up to 55% of patients had clinical recurrence in the first 2 years after initial surgery. The current clinical report on postoperative recurrence in pediatric Crohn disease reviews the risk factors for early surgery and postoperative recurrence, operative risk factors for recurrence, and prevention and monitoring strategies for postoperative recurrence. We also propose an algorithm for postoperative management in pediatric Crohn disease.\n\nDesmoid tumors of the abdominal wall: A case report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOverhaus, Marcus; Decker, Pan; Fischer, Hans Peter; Textor, Hans Jochen; Hirner, Andreas\n\n2003-01-01\n\nBackground Desmoid tumors are slow growing deep fibromatoses with aggressive infiltration of adjacent tissue but without any metastatic potential. Case Presentation We report on two female patients with desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall who underwent primary resection. Both patients had a history of an earlier abdominal surgery.

This neoplasm is composed of spindle (fibrocyte-like) cells. As regards the site, aggressive fibromatoses can be divided into: extra-abdominal in the area of the shoulder and pelvic girdle or chest and neck wall; abdominal in abdominal wall muscles; intra-abdominal concerning pelvis, mesentery connective tissue or retroperitoneal space. Desmoid tumor is a neoplasm which rarely turns malignant and is non-metastasizing but demonstrates ability to local infiltration into tissue and is characterized by high risk of recurrence (25-65%) after surgical treatment. Desmoid tumor etiology is uncertain. This neoplasm occurs in sporadic (idiopathic) form and is also associated with some familial neoplastic syndromes. Most sporadic cases of aggressive fibromatosis contain a somatic mutation in either the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or beta-catenin genes. Sporadic tumors are more frequent in women than in men from 2 : 1 to 5 : 1. In about 10-15 per cent of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), aggressive fibromatosis is a parenteral manifestation of this familial syndrome conditioned by APC gene mutation. Abdomen injury--most frequently due to surgery is said to play an important role in the initiation of fibrous tissue proliferative process in the cases of abdominal and intra abdominal forms. High cells growth potential with relatively high local malignancy is observed in about 10% of cases with sporadic tumors as well as in those FAP-associated.\n\nDesmoid tumors of the right rectus abdominus muscle in postpartum women.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarneiro, Carmen; Hurtubis, Cheryl; Singh, Meenakshi; Robinson, William\n\n2009-06-01\n\nDesmoid tumors are benign neoplasms that most often arise from muscle aponeurosis and have been associated with both trauma and pregnancy. The etiology of desmoids has not been determined. We present here four almost identical cases with desmoids occurring in the same location, the right rectus abdominus muscle in young post partum females. All were over the age of 30 at the time of diagnosis. Three of them had previously used oral contraceptive agents for an average of 3 years. None had a history of trauma to the area of involvement. Three had early surgical resection and one was treated with tamoxifen and imatinib without response and then had surgical resection. All four patients are disease free at a median follow-up of 2.5 years. The possible etiology of desmoids tumors in this location in postpartum females is discussed.\n\nA case report of desmoid tumour-a forgotten aspect of FAP?\n\nPubMed\n\nXuereb, Sarah; Xuereb, Rachel; Buhagiar, Chiara; Gauci, Jonathan; Magri, Claude\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDesmoid tumours are locally aggressive tumours which are common in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). A 20-year old Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) patient presented with abdominal pain and distention. Abdominal imaging showed small bowel obstruction and hydronephrosis due to a pelvic mass. This mass showed significant enlargement on repeat imaging, and a diagnostic biopsy confirmed desmoid tumour. The mass was deemed unresectable and he was initially started on sulindac and raloxifene. Repeat imaging however showed further enlargement of the tumour, and therefore vinblastine+methotrexate chemotherapy was commenced, with a good response. FAP is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Gardner's syndrome is also caused by a mutation in the APC gene, and is now considered a different phenotypic presentation of FAP. Desmoid tumours are initially kept under observation while their size remains stable. Treatment options for enlarging desmoids tumours include surgery (first-line), radiotherapy, and systemic therapy with non-cytotoxic and cytotoxic therapy. FAP patients should be examined regularly post-panprocotocolectomy, since desmoid tumours may arise. The presence of epidermal cysts in this FAP patient suggests a diagnosis of Gardner's syndrome.

The differential diagnosis expands when recurrent parotitis is encountered. One etiology is primary pediatric SjÃ¶gren syndrome (SS), an autoimmune condition typically associated with dryness of the eyes and mouth in adults. Pediatric patients often present with isolated recurrent bilateral parotitis, however, and we describe 4 such cases in children aged 9 to 17 years at presentation. Despite lack of ocular complaints, 3 of these patients had ocular findings on ophthalmologic exam. Our patients also exhibited classic laboratory abnormalities, including positive antinuclear antibody, SS A, and SS B antibodies; presence of rheumatoid factor; and hypergammaglobulinemia. Consideration of SS in the child with recurrent parotitis is important for timely and appropriate referral and treatment. We review the differential diagnosis of parotitis in children as well as the salient features of pediatric SS.\n\nHigh-grade soft tissue sarcoma arising in a desmoid tumor: case report and review of the literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nBertucci, FranÃ§ois; Faure, Marjorie; Ghigna, Maria-Rosa; Chetaille, Bruno; Guiramand, JÃ©rÃ´me; Moureau-Zabotto, Laurence; Sarran, Anthony; Perrot, Delphine\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDesmoid tumors are rare benign monoclonal fibroblastic tumors. Their aggressiveness is local with no potential for metastasis or dedifferentiation. Here we report on a 61-year-old patient who presented a locally advanced breast desmoid tumor diagnosed 20Â years after post-operative radiotherapy for breast carcinoma. After 2Â years of medical treatment, a high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic soft tissue sarcoma arose within the desmoid tumor. Despite extensive surgery removing both tumors, the patient showed locoregional relapse by the sarcoma, followed by multimetastatic progression, then death 25Â months after the surgery. The arising of a soft tissue sarcoma in a desmoid tumor is an exceptional event since our case is the fourth one reported so far in literature. It reinforces the need for timely and accurate diagnosis when a new mass develops in the region of a preexisting desmoid tumor, and more generally when a desmoid tumor modifies its clinical or radiological aspect.\n\nTAMOXIFEN RETINOPATHY DURING TREATMENT OF AN INOPERABLE DESMOID TUMOR.\n\nPubMed\n\nFurst, Meredith; Somogyi, Marie B; Wong, Robert W; Araujo, Dejka; Harper, Clio A\n\n2017-12-08\n\nTo evaluate the clinical significance and rarity of tamoxifen retinopathy after a long-term tamoxifen treatment for an inoperable desmoid tumor. Case report. Tamoxifen retinopathy is a condition rarely observed in clinical practice. Although tamoxifen is typically a treatment for breast cancer patients, we present a 68-year-old woman taking tamoxifen for an inoperable desmoid tumor, an equally rare condition. She presented with bilaterally deteriorating vision over the course of a year. Fundoscopic examination revealed parafoveal deposits bilaterally. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography exhibited hyperreflective deposits in all layers of the retina. She had a cumulative treatment dose of 292 g of tamoxifen, and the medication was subsequently stopped. Her vision remained stable 3 months after the cessation of tamoxifen. The development of tamoxifen retinopathy in the treatment of a desmoid tumor makes this case a rare entity, and this is the first reported case of these two concomitant conditions to our knowledge. With the use of long-term tamoxifen as a primary treatment, we recommend screening at regular intervals by an ophthalmologist as an integral part of treatment.\n\nAbdominal Wall Desmoid during Pregnancy: Diagnostic Challenges\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAwwad, Johnny; Hammoud, Nadine; Farra, Chantal; Fares, Farah; Abi Saad, George; Ghazeeri, Ghina\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground. Desmoids are benign tumors, with local invasive features and no metastatic potential, which have rarely been described to be pregnancy associated. Case. We described the rapid growth of an anterior abdominal wall mass in a 40-year-old pregnant woman. Due to its close proximity to the enlarged uterus, it was misdiagnosed to be a uterine leiomyoma by ultrasound examination. Final tissue diagnosis and radical resection were done at the time of abdominal delivery. Conclusion. Due to the diagnostic limitations of imaging techniques, desmoids should always be considered when the following manifestations are observed in combination: progressive growth of a solitary abdominal wall mass during pregnancy and well-delineated smooth tumor margins demonstrated by imaging techniques. This case emphasizes the importance of entertaining uncommon medical conditions in the differential diagnosis of seemingly common clinical manifestations.

However, they have a strong tendency to invade locally and recur. They constitute 3% of all soft tissue tumors and 0.03% of all neoplasms. Abdominal DTs occur sporadically or are associated with certain familial syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The single form of this neoplasm most frequently occurs in females of reproductive age and during pregnancy. A female patient with a DT of the abdominal wall who had no relevant family history was admitted to hospital. The patient, who presented with a painless mass in the left anterolateral abdomen, had no history of trauma, surgery or childbearing. According to the medical history, physical examination and CT report, the patient was diagnosed with DT. Radical resection of the affected abdominal wall musculature was performed, and the defect was replaced with a polypropylene mesh. The histological diagnosis was of DT. The patient remains in good health and complete remission without any other treatment following surgery. DTs exhibit aggressive growth and have a high rate of recurrence. Surgery is the optimal treatment, and subsequent radiotherapy may decrease the local recurrence rate. Further research into their aetiology is required combined with multicentre clinical trials of new treatments in order to improve management of this disease. This case report provides general knowledge of DT, and may be used as a guidance for diagnosis and treatment.

This was a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients hospitalized at a freestanding children's hospital from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2010. Patients were eligible if they were <18 years of age at admission and had a new diagnosis of CDI. Patients <1 year of age and those with a history of CDI in the previous 60 days were excluded. Age, gender, race, complex chronic conditions, and other information were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of recurrent CDI. During the study period, there were 612 unique patients with an incident CDI episode; 65 (10.6%) experienced at least 1 recurrence. Patients with any complex chronic condition were 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-13.9) times more likely to experience recurrence. Patients with a malignancy and those who received non-CDI antibiotics at any time during CDI treatment were 2.3 (95% CI: 1.3-4.0) and 2.8 (95% CI: 1.2-6.9) times more likely to experience recurrence, respectively. The presence of underlying comorbidities, malignancies, and treatment with non-CDI antibiotics during CDI treatment were the most important risk factors for recurrence. Efforts to reduce unnecessary courses of non-CDI antibiotics could lower the risk of CDI recurrence.

We report an interesting case of DTF involving the pancreatic head of a 54-year-old woman. She presented with intermittent dysphagia and significant weight loss within a 3-mo period. Laboratory findings showed mild elevation of transaminases, significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase and direct hyperbilirubinemia, indicating obstructive jaundice. Computerized tomography of the abdomen revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas, dilated common bile duct, and dilated pancreatic duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasound showed a large hypoechoic mass in the head of the pancreas causing extrahepatic biliary obstruction and pancreatic ductal dilation. The patient underwent a successful partial pancreatico-duodenectomy and cholecystectomy. She received no additional therapy after surgery, and liver function tests were normalized within nine days after surgery. Currently, surgical resection is the recommended first line treatment. The patient will be followed for any recurrence.

This treatment strategy is associated with a recurrence rate of nearly 50% according to various reports. EADF may show spontaneous stabilization over time. A retrospective series of 26 cases of EADF managed by simple observation was studied to assess spontaneous favorable evolution and identify possible factors impacting evolution. Eleven cases were of primary EADF with no treatment or surgery, and 15 of recurrence after surgery with no adjuvant treatment. MRI was the reference examination during follow-up. Twenty-four cases showed stabilization at a median 14 months; there were no cases of renewed evolution after stabilization. One primary tumor showed spontaneous regression, and one recurrence still showed evolution at end of follow-up (23 months). The sole factor impacting potential for evolution was prior surgery. No radiologic or pathologic criteria of evolution emerged from analysis. The present series, one of the largest dedicated to EADF managed by observation, confirmed recent literature findings: a conservative \"wait-and-see\" attitude is reasonable and should be considered when large-scale resection would entail significant functional or esthetic impairment.

It can occur as intra-abdominal, extraabdominal, or abdominal wall tumor depending on the site. The abdominal wall type is usually sporadic, but few have been associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. They are commonly seen in young females who are pregnant with a history of the previous cesarean section scar or within the 1st year of the last childbirth. There is an association between this tumor, presence of estrogen receptors, and abdominal trauma. We present a 29-year-old Nigerian woman with fungating lower abdominal wall tumor. This tumor is rare, a high index of suspicion will be very important in making the diagnosis.

The clinical management of desmoid tumors is very complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach because of the unpredictable disease course. For those cases localized in the anterior abdominal wall, symptomatic and unresponsive to medical treatment, radical resection and reconstruction with a prosthetic device are indicated. We present here a case of desmoid fibromatosis of the left anterolateral abdominal wall with a marked increase of the mass that required a large excision followed by reconstruction with biological matrix. The fact that it can be incorporated in patient tissue without a fibrotic response and that it can resist future infections, together with a very competetive price, made the new collagen matrix EgisÂ® our first choice.

Desmoid tumors can manifest anywhere in the body, and those in the abdominal cavity account for approximately 30 to 50% of all such tumors. Complete resection with free margins has been the standard treatment, but non-surgical therapies have been implemented recently. However, if tumors are strongly invasive and/or persistently recur, radical surgical resection with free margins remains the primary treatment. Unfortunately, radical resection may cause large abdominal defects and hinder reconstruction. Several reports and recommendations have addressed this issue; however, to the best of our knowledge, few reports have described complete resection and the subsequent reconstruction of the rectus abdominis muscle. A 35-year-old Asian woman presented at our hospital with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. She had abdominal desmoid tumors that required complete resection of her rectus abdominis muscle. Due to necrosis in her own reconstructed tissue, we failed to cover her anterior abdominal wall; thus, we used an abdominal binder as a substitute material to avoid exacerbating the incisional hernia and help her generate intra-abdominal pressure. This case report may be informative and helpful for the treatment of patients with desmoid tumors, as managing desmoid-type fibromatosis is difficult.\n\nThe Diagnosis, Evaluation and Treatment of Acute and Recurrent Pediatric Urinary Tract Infections\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBecknell, Brian; Schober, Megan; Korbel, Lindsey; Spencer, John David\n\n2015-01-01\n\nUrinary tract infection is one of the most common bacterial infections encountered by pediatricians.

She presented to our hospital with a high fever and abdominal pain. Large hard tumors were palpated in the right lower abdomen and pelvis. Blood examination showed an inflammatory response. CT scan revealed 17 cm diameter solid tumors. At surgery, 2 tumors arising from the mesentery of the small intestine were found, neither of which invaded any organs. We performed tumor extirpation with partial resection of the duodenum, ileum, right fallopian tube and rectum. A jejunal stoma was formed, leaving a length of remnant intestine of about 120 cm. The histopathological diagnosis was given as desmoid tumor with infection. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 9th postoperative day. Desmoid tumor is the second most common cause of death in FAP patients. Although desmoids can also occur in the extremities, most FAP patients develop intra-abdominal tumors. Despite being histologically benign, they are locally infiltrative and can cause death through invasion and destruction of adjacent vital structures and organs. Here, we report a case of desmoid tumors with FAP with reference to the literature.\n\nRecurrent severe abdominal pain in the pediatric patient.\n\nPubMed\n\nHomme, James L; Foster, Ashley A\n\n2014-05-01\n\nUreteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is a blockage occurring at the junction of the ureter and the renal pelvis. Pediatric patients with UPJO pose a diagnostic challenge when they present to the emergency department (ED) with severe recurrent abdominal pain if there is not a level of suspicion for this condition. Our aim was to review presentation of UPJO to the ED, methods of diagnosis, and treatment of this common but often overlooked condition. We report on 2 patients, a 9-year-old and 3-year-old, who had multiple presentations to health care providers and the ED with intermittent and recurrent abdominal pain. Subsequent testing, including ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) with diuretic-recreated symptoms, revealed UPJO. Open pyeloplasty was performed, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms. UPJO is an important diagnosis to consider when patients present to the ED with recurrent abdominal pain. US can be helpful in suspecting the diagnosis, but often CT, magnetic resonance urography, or diuretic scintigraphy is required for confirmation. Diuretics can be used to aid diagnostic testing by reproducing abdominal pain at the time of imaging. Referral to a urologist for open pyeloplasty is definitive treatment for this condition.

Recently, the Institut Gustave Roussy (IGR), Villejuif, France, reported a series of patients treated with a front-line conservative approach (no surgery and no radiotherapy). The disease remained stable in more than half of patients. This study was designed to evaluate this approach on the natural history of the disease in a larger series of patients. A total of 142 patients presenting to the IGR or Istituto Nazionale Tumori (INT), Milan, Italy, were initially treated using a front-line deliberately conservative policy. Their progression-free survival (PFS) was observed and a multivariate analysis was performed for major clinical variables. Seventy-four patients presented with primary tumor, 68 with recurrence. Eighty-three patients received a \"wait & see\" policy (W&S), whereas 59 were initially offered medical therapy (MT), mainly hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. A family history of sporadic colorectal cancer was present in 8% of patients. The 5-year PFS was 49.9% for the W&S group and 58.6% for the medically treated patients (P = 0.3196). Similar results emerged for primary and recurrent DF. Multivariate analysis identified no clinical variables as independent predictors of PFS. In the event of progression, all patients were subsequently managed safely. A conservative policy could be a safe approach to primary and recurrent DF, which could avoid unnecessary morbidity from surgery and/or radiation therapy. Half of patients had medium-term stable disease after W&S or MT. A multidisciplinary, stepwise approach should be prospectively tested in DF.\n\nSpatio-temporal genetic heterogeneity of CTNNB1 mutations in sporadic desmoid type fibromatosis lesions.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoyen, JÃ©rÃ´me; Duranton-Tanneur, ValÃ©rie; Hostein, Isabelle; Karanian-Philippe, Marie; Chevreau, Christine; Breibach, Florence; Coutts, Michael; Dadone, BÃ©rengÃ¨re; Saint-Paul, Marie-Christine; Gugenheim, Jean; Duffaud, Florence; Pedeutour, Florence\n\n2016-03-01\n\nDesmoid type fibromatosis (DT) is a rare lesion of unclear pathogenesis that most often presents a mutation of the (Î²-catenin) gene. The natural history and clinical evolution are highly variable between patients and to date there is no consensus on optimal therapy. We report two cases of a patient with multiple DT lesions. Molecular investigations performed in both patients on multiple tumors at different anatomical sites revealed non-identical CTNNB1 mutations. The first patient was a 39-year-old man with a history of recurrent DT. In two of the DT lesions, three different mutations were found in codons 41 and 45, respectively. The lesions showed marked inflammatory features, characterized by IgG4 positive lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and a foreign body reaction, which increased in intensity over time. The patient was eventually treated with a COX-2 inhibitor and the remaining mass was stabilized. In the two DT lesions of the second patient, CTNNB1 mutations S45P and T41A were found. The presence of different mutations in multiple focally recurrent sporadic DT lesions indicates that they do not have a clonal relationship. Our data suggest that a CTNNB1 mutation is a necessary event probably by providing a selective growth advantage. An IgG4 host antigen response is discussed as a potential predisposing factor for one of the patients.\n\nCesarean section after abdominal mesh repair for pregnancy-related desmoid tumor: a case report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOoi, Sara; Ngo, Harry\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe report the case of a 32-year-old gravida 2 para 1 woman with a background of partially resected desmoid tumor (DT) arising from the previous cesarean section (CS) scar. This case details the management of her DT by surgical resection and mesh repair and second pregnancy following this. Pregnancy-related DTs are a relatively rare entity, and there is a paucity of literature regarding their management during pregnancy. There are only five reported cases of DTs arising from CS scars. To our knowledge, this is the only report to illustrate that subsequent CS is possible after desmoid resection and abdominal mesh repair. It provides evidence that CS can be safely accomplished following abdominal wall reconstructions and further arguments against elective lower segment CS.

Several surgical procedures have been used for patella-realignment and stabilization, but the effects of surgical intervention on bony trochlear remodeling in skeletally immature patients have not been well studied. We thus present two cases of pediatric recurrent patella dislocations that showed trochlear remodeling following patella-realignment surgery. The first case describes an 11-year-old female treated with a Roux-Golthwait procedure and the second case highlights a 12-year-old male treated with lateral release and medial capsular reefing. The Merchant technique, a radiographic criterion that was designed to evaluate patella alignment in relation to the femoral trochlea groove, including sulcus and congruence angles was used to measure postoperative bony development. Both pediatric patients showed successful outcomes following surgical interventions for chronic patella instability. Using the Merchant technique, both patients showed improved congruence and sulcus angles postoperatively. Patella realignment in skeletally immature patients may be beneficial for promoting trochlear remodeling and deepening of the trochlear groove, which may help protect against future dislocation or subluxation events.

Objective To characterize and identify risk factors associated with ARP and CP in childhood. Design A multinational cross-sectional study of children with ARP or CP at the time of enrollment to INSPPIRE (International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a CuRE) study. Setting Participant institutions of the INSPPIRE Consortium. Participants From September 2012 to February 2015, 155 children with ARP and 146 with CP (â¤ 19 years of age) were enrolled. Their demographic and clinical information were entered into the REDCap database at fifteen centers. Interventions None. Main Outcomes and Measures A cross-sectional study of the cohort was performed to assess demographics, risk factors, abdominal pain and disease burden. Differences were analyzed using two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon-rank sum test for the continuous variables, and Pearson Chi-square or Fisherâs exact test for categorical variables. Disease burden variables (pain variables, hospital/ER visits, missed school days) were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results The majority of children with CP reported prior recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. Gender distribution was similar between the groups. ARP was more common in Hispanics, CP in non-Hispanics. Forty-eight percent of patients with ARP versus 73% of patients with CP had at least one gene mutation in pancreatitis-related genes (p=0.0002). Children with PRSS1 or SPINK1 mutations were more likely to present with CP compared with ARP (p<0.0001 and p<0.05 respectively). Obstructive (~30% of patients) and toxic/metabolic risk factors (~20% of patients) did not differ between children with ARP or CP. Pancreatitis-related abdominal pain was a major complaint in 81% of children with ARP or CP within the last year. The disease burden was higher in CP compared with ARP (more ER visits, hospitalizations, missed school days\n\n[Management of recurrent urethrocutaneous fistula after hypospadias surgery in pediatric patients: initial experience with dermal regeneration sheet Integra].\n\nPubMed\n\nCasal-Beloy, I; Somoza Argibay, I; GarcÃ­a-GonzÃ¡lez, M; GarcÃ­a-Novoa, A M; MÃ­guez Fortes, L; Blanco, C; Dargallo Carbonell, T\n\n2017-10-25\n\nTo present our initial experience using a dermal regeneration sheet as an urethral cover in the repair of recurrent urethrocutaneous fistulae in pediatric patients. Since May 2016 to March a total of 8 fistulaes were repaired using this new technique. We performed the ddissection of the fistulous tract and posterior closure of the urethral defect. A dermal regeneration sheet was used to cover the urethral suture. Finally a rotational flap was performed to avoid overlap sutures. During the follow-up (average 6 months), one patient presented in the immediate postoperative period infection of the surgical wound. This patient presented recurrence of the fistula. 88% of the patients included presented a good evolution with no other complications. In our initial experience the new technique seems easy, safe and effective in the management of the recurrent urethrocutaneous fistulae in pediatric patients. More studies are needed to prove these results.\n\nPhysiologic Growth Hormone-Replacement Therapy and Craniopharyngioma Recurrence in Pediatric Patients: A Meta-Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlotaibi, Nawaf M; Noormohamed, Nadia; Cote, David J; Alharthi, Salman; Doucette, Joanne; Zaidi, Hasan A; Mekary, Rania A; Smith, Timothy R\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to examine the effect of growth hormone-replacement therapy (GHRT) on the recurrence of craniopharyngioma in children. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched through April 2017 for studies that evaluated the effect of GHRT on the recurrence of pediatric craniopharyngioma. Pooled effect estimates were calculated with fixed- and random-effects models. Ten studies (nÂ = 3487 patients) metÂ all inclusion criteria, including 2 retrospective cohorts and 8 case series. Overall, 3436 pediatric patients were treated with GHRT after surgery and 51 were not. Using the fixed effect model, we found that the overall craniopharyngioma recurrence rate was lower among children who were treated by GHRT (10.9%; 95% confidence interval 9.80%-12.1%; I 2 Â = 89.1%; P for heterogeneity <0.01; nÂ = 10 groups) compared with those who were not (35.2%; 95% confidence interval 23.1%-49.6%; I 2 Â = 61.7%; P for heterogeneityÂ = 0.11; nÂ = 3); the P value comparing the 2 groups was <0.01. Among patients who were treated with GHRT, subgroup analysis revealed that there was a greater prevalence of craniopharyngioma recurrence among studies conducted outside the United States (P < 0.01), single-center studies (P < 0.01), lower impact factor studies (PÂ = 0.03), or studies with a lower quality rating (PÂ = 0.01). Using the random-effects model, we found that the results were not materially different except for when stratifying by GHRT, impact factor, or study quality; this led to nonsignificant differences. Both Begg's rank correlation test (PÂ = 0.7) and Egger's linear regression test (PÂ = 0.06) indicated no publication bias. This meta-analysis demonstrated a lower recurrence rate of craniopharyngioma among children treated with GHRT than those who were not. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty patients treated with meloxicam were followed up every 3 to 6 months. Meloxicam administration was planned at 15 mg/day orally for 6 months. Of the 20 patients evaluated, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, there were five patients with partial response (25.0%), eight with stable disease (40.0%), and seven with tumor progression (35.0%). The cumulative probability of dropping out from our nonsurgical strategy using meloxicam was 35.0% at 1 year and 35.0% at 5 years. The present study suggests that conservative treatment would be a primary treatment option for this perplexing disease even though we were not able to determine that the use of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor would have an additional influence on the natural course of a desmoid tumor.\n\nTRTH-30. PRELIMINARY EXPERIENCE WITH SERIAL WHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING OF PEDIATRIC CNS TUMORS AT DIAGNOSIS AND RECURRENCE.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSzalontay, Luca; Pendrick, Danielle; Feldstein, Neil; Anderson, Richard; Stark, Eileen; Bender, Julia Glade; Oberg, Jennifer; Hsiao, Susan; Turk, Andrew; Sireci, Anthony; Mansukhani, Mahesh; Garvin, James\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract INTRODUCTION: Whole exome sequencing (WES) of newly diagnosed pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors is quickly becoming part of routine care. Through the Precision in Pediatric Sequencing (PiPseq) program at Columbia University, we have found potentially actionable mutations in more than 40% of evaluable CNS cases at diagnosis. More recently, we have integrated this approach into the management of patients undergoing surgery for CNS tumor recurrence. METHOD: After obtaining informed consent, tumor-normal WES with transcriptome analysis was performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory on fresh frozen or paraffin embedded CNS tumor samples and peripheral blood. RESULTS: 7 cases (5 male, 2 female; median age 5Â years) with adequate diagnostic and recurrent tumor tissue were tested. No case had a somatic mutation of established clinical utility (tier 1). Among 3 embryonal tumors, a splice site variant in TSC1 (tier 2 mutation of potential utility) was detected in a medulloblastoma, but only at recurrence and not at initial diagnosis. FOXR2 overexpression was detected at diagnosis and confirmed at early progression of a temporal lobe tumor, prompting revision of the initial diagnosis of high grade glioma to CNS neuroblastoma subtype of PNET, and treated accordingly. In a third patient initially diagnosed with medulloblastoma, overexpression of PDGFRA, MDM4, CDKN2A, EGFR, OLIG2, and GFAP supported a change in diagnosis to glioblastoma. Two gliomas had tier 2 mutations detected at initial diagnosis and progression: SETD2Â p.R2040* (optic nerve lesion, called pseudotumor initially but glioma at progression), and H3F3A p.K28M (thalamic low grade glioma). In one patient with ependymoma, copy number gain of 1q25 (associated with poor prognosis) was seen only in the recurrence specimen. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary experience suggests that in pediatric CNS tumor patients referred for reoperation at recurrence, repeat WES may reveal a previously unrecognized\n\nSystematic Review of Clinical Outcomes Following Various Treatment Options for Patients with Extraabdominal Desmoid Tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, Kortnye; Desai, Jayesh; Lazarakis, Smaro; Gyorki, David\n\n2018-06-01\n\nDesmoid tumors (DT) are rare clonal proliferations that arise from mesenchymal cells. These tumors do not metastasize but are locally aggressive, and their growth may lead to significant morbidity. Their clinical course is both variable and unpredictable; tumors may rapidly progress but in other instances remain stable or regress without intervention. To examine current treatment of DT and assist with decision-making at time of presentation. A literature search was conducted of MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for published studies (1995-July 2015) using the search terms fibromatosis aggressive, desmoid with drug therapy, radiation therapy, prevention and control, radiotherapy, surgery, and therapy. Articles were categorized as surgery, radiation, surgeryâ+âradiation, systemic therapy, and front-line observation. Articles were included if they reported a retrospective or prospective comparative or observational study with an analyzed sample size of 10 patients or more with confirmed diagnosis of desmoid tumor and described one of the following clinical outcomes: relapse- or progression-free survival, local control rate, response rate. 258 articles were reviewed; following screening for eligibility, 54 were identified; following full-text screen, 31 were included in final evaluation. The control rate for patients treated with a \"wait and see\" observational approach compared favorably with management with surgery and resulted in disease control rates of between 60 and 92%. Decision-making in this rare tumor is complicated by the range of treatment options available. Our evidence supports use of an upfront observational approach.\n\nAn evaluation of brachytherapy and external beam radiation used with wide-margin surgical resection in the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nHusain, Zain; Benevenia, Joseph; Uglialoro, Anthony D; Beebe, Kathleen S; Patterson, Francis R; Hameed, Meera R; Cathcart, Charles S\n\n2011-05-01\n\nSurgical resection has had control rates of 53% to 77% in the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. Surgical excision combined with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has had local control rates of up to 83% in some series. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of resection combined with radiotherapy (brachytherapy, EBRT, or both) in the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 24 consecutive patients (27 histologically confirmed extra-abdominal desmoid tumors). Patients were included in the study if they had a lesion that was potentially resectable with a wide margin, allowing for limb salvage, and if they did not have a contraindication to radiotherapy. Limb functioning was assessed with the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring system. Seventeen patients (7 men, 10 women) with 19 tumors met the inclusion criteria. Mean age at diagnosis was 23.4 years. Follow-up (mean, 4.28 years) involved serial clinical examinations and magnetic resonance imaging of tumor sites. After surgery, the tumors were treated with brachytherapy (n = 6), EBRT (n = 10), or both (n = 3). Two of the 17 tumors in patients with negative margins of resection recurred locally (local control rate, 88.2%). Mean MSTS score was 29/30 (96.7%). The role of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other treatments for extra-abdominal desmoid tumors is not well defined. When wide-margin resection and radiotherapy can be performed with limb preservation surgery, local control and complication rates compare favorably with those of other reported methods of treatment. Given the results and limitations of our study, we cannot make a definitive recommendation as to which modality--brachytherapy or EBRT--should be used in the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors.\n\nLarge desmoid-type fibromatosis of the shoulder girdle: operative approach selection and clinic outcome.\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Fan; Min, Li; Yin, Rui; Zhang, Wenli; Zhou, Yong; Luo, Yi; Shi, Rui; Duan, Hong; Tu, Chongqi\n\n2015-02-01\n\nSurgical resection of large desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) of the shoulder girdle is challenging. This article discusses the operative approach and evaluates the clinic outcome. Twenty-one cases between June 2003 and June 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Eleven patients newly diagnosed and ten had previous operations. Mean tumour size was 10.5Â cm (range, 7.0-19.0Â cm). We divided the shoulder girdle into four regions; the adopted surgical resection was en bloc in 18 cases and piecemeal resection in three. In nine cases we took an anterior approach, ten a posterior approach and two a combined anteroposterior (AP) approach. Brachytherapy with permanent I(125) implantation was applied in all cases. All 21 patients were followed up for a mean of 49.8 (range, 18-136) months. Recurrence was seen in two patients, with the overall recurrence rate of 9.5Â %. The Musculoskeletal Tumour Score (MSTS) was between 56.7 and 96.7Â %, with the average at 78.9Â % and excellent-good rate 95.2Â %. Complications were found in three of the 21 patients (14.3Â %). Surgical resection with the precondition of preserving vital structure for large DTF of the shoulder girdle is necessary. According to our new partition, it was suitable to take an anterior approach when regions I or Iâ+âII were involved, posterior approach for regions II, III or IIâ+âIII; combined AP approach when involving region Iâ+âIIâ+âIII; and anterior or posterior approach for region IV, depending upon tumour location.\n\nA Patient With Desmoid Tumors and Familial FAP Having Frame Shift Mutation of the APC Gene.\n\nPubMed\n\nSadighi, Sanambar; Ghaffari-Moghaddam, Mahsa; Saffari, Mojtaba; Mohagheghi, Mohammad Ali; Shirkoohi, Reza\n\n2017-02-01\n\nDesmoids tumors, characterized by monoclonal proliferation of myofibroblasts, could occur in 5-10% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as an extra-colonic manifestation of the disease. FAP can develop when there is a germ-line mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. Although mild or attenuated FAP may follow mutations in 5Î extreme of the gene, it is more likely that 3Î extreme mutations haveamore severe manifestation of thedisease. A 28-year-old woman was admitted to the Cancer Institute of Iran with an abdominal painful mass. She had strong family history of FAP and underwent prophylactic total colectomy. Pre-operative CT scans revealed a large mass. Microscopic observation showed diffuse fibroblast cell infiltration of the adjacent tissue structures. Peripheral blood DNA extraction followed by adenomatous polyposis coli gene exon by exon sequencing was performed to investigate the mutation in adenomatous polyposis coli gene. Analysis of DNA sequencing demonstrated a mutation of 4 bpdeletions at codon 1309-1310 of the exon 16 of adenomatous polyposis coli gene sequence which was repeated in 3 members of the family. Some of them had desmoid tumor without classical FAP history. Even when there is no familial history of adenomatous polyposis, the adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutation should be investigated in cases of familial desmoids tumors for a suitable prevention. The 3Î extreme of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene is still the best likely location in such families.\n\nPediatric recurrent respiratory tract infections: when and how to explore the immune system? (About 53 cases).\n\nPubMed\n\nEl-Azami-El-Idrissi, Mohammed; Lakhdar-Idrissi, Mounia; Chaouki, Sanae; Atmani, Samir; Bouharrou, Abdelhak; Hida, Moustapha\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRecurrent respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for pediatric visits and hospitalization. Causes of this pathology are multiple ranging from congenital to acquired and local to general. Immune deficiencies are considered as underlying conditions predisposing to this pathology. Our work is about to determine when and how to explore the immune system when facing recurrent respiratory infections. This was based on the records of 53 children hospitalized at the pediatrics unit of Hassan II University Hospital, Fez Morocco. Thirty boys and 23 girls with age ranging from 5 months to 12 years with an average age of 2 years were involved in this study. Bronchial foreign body was the main etiology in children of 3 to 6 year old. Gastro-esophageal reflux, which in some cases is a consequence of chronic cough, as well as asthma were most frequent in infants (17 and 15% respectively). Immune deficiency was described in 7.5% of patients and the only death we deplored in our series belongs to this group. Recurrent respiratory tract infections have multiple causes. In our series they are dominated by foreign body inhalation and gastroesophageal reflux, which in some cases is a consequence of a chronic cough. Immune deficiency is not frequent but could influence the prognosis. Therefore immune explorations should be well codified.\n\nGenomic characterization of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia reveals novel recurrent driver mutations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSpinella, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Cassart, Pauline; Richer, Chantal; Saillour, Virginie; Ouimet, Manon; Langlois, Sylvie; St-Onge, Pascal; Sontag, Thomas; Healy, Jasmine; Minden, Mark D.; Sinnett, Daniel\n\n2016-01-01\n\nT-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy with variable prognosis. It represents 15% of diagnosed pediatric ALL cases and has a threefold higher incidence among males. Many recurrent alterations have been identified and help define molecular subgroups of T-ALL, however the full range of events involved in driving transformation remain to be defined. Using an integrative approach combining genomic and transcriptomic data, we molecularly characterized 30 pediatric T-ALLs and identified common recurrent T-ALL targets such as FBXW7, JAK1, JAK3, PHF6, KDM6A and NOTCH1 as well as novel candidate T-ALL driver mutations including the p.R35L missense mutation in splicesome factor U2AF1 found in 3 patients and loss of function mutations in the X-linked tumor suppressor genes MED12 (frameshit mutation p.V167fs, splice site mutation g.chrX:70339329T>C, missense mutation p.R1989H) and USP9X (nonsense mutation p.Q117*). In vitro functional studies further supported the putative role of these novel T-ALL genes in driving transformation. U2AF1 p.R35L was shown to induce aberrant splicing of downstream target genes, and shRNA knockdown of MED12 and USP9X was shown to confer resistance to apoptosis following T-ALL relevant chemotherapy drug treatment in Jurkat leukemia cells. Interestingly, nearly 60% of novel candidate driver events were identified among immature T-ALL cases, highlighting the underlying genomic complexity of pediatric T-ALL, and the need for larger integrative studies to decipher the mechanisms that contribute to its various subtypes and provide opportunities to refine patient stratification and treatment.

These lymphomas occur predominantly in the pediatric population and show features distinct from their more common counterparts in adults: adult-type follicular lymphoma and adult-type nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Here we report a detailed whole-exome deep sequencing analysis of a cohort of pediatric-type follicular lymphomas and pediatric marginal zone lymphomas. This analysis revealed a recurrent somatic variant encoding p.Lys66Arg in the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) in 3 of 6 cases (50%) of pediatric-type follicular lymphoma. This specific point mutation was not detected in pediatric marginal zone lymphoma or in adult-type follicular lymphoma. Additional somatic point mutations in pediatric-type follicular lymphoma were observed in genes involved in transcription, intracellular signaling, and cell proliferation. In pediatric marginal zone lymphoma, no recurrent mutation was identified; however, somatic point mutations were observed in genes involved in cellular adhesion, cytokine regulatory elements, and cellular proliferation. A somatic variant in AMOTL1, a recurrently mutated gene in splenic marginal zone lymphoma, was also identified in a case of pediatric marginal zone lymphoma. The overall non-synonymous mutational burden was low in both pediatric-type follicular lymphoma and pediatric marginal zone lymphoma (4.6 mutations per exome). Altogether, these findings support a distinctive genetic basis for pediatric-type follicular lymphoma and pediatric marginal zone lymphoma when compared with adult subtypes and to one another. Moreover, identification of a recurrent point mutation in IRF8 provides insight into a potential driver mutation in the pathogenesis of pediatric-type follicular lymphoma with implications for novel diagnostic or therapeutic strategies.\n\nA study of the mutational landscape of pediatric-type follicular lymphoma and pediatric nodal marginal zone lymphoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOzawa, Michael G; Bhaduri, Aparna; Chisholm, Karen M; Baker, Steven A; Ma, Lisa; Zehnder, James L; Luna-Fineman, Sandra; Link, Michael P; Merker, Jason D; Arber, Daniel A; Ohgami, Robert S\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPediatric-type follicular lymphoma and pediatric marginal zone lymphoma are two of the rarest B-cell lymphomas.

This study was conducted to detect the uropathogen, antimicrobial susceptibility, pathogen associated with recurrences and renal scarring in children initially taken care from general practitioners and later presented to tertiary care. Every inward UTI episode, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility was done while on past 6-month, history of infections and use of antimicrobials was collected using clinical records and demonstration of antimicrobials. Children with recurrent pyelonephritis was followed and in vitro bio film formation was assessed. Frequency of UTI was significantly high among infants (pâ=â0.03). Last 6-month, all (220) were exposed to antimicrobials. Cefixime was the commonly prescribed antimicrobial (pâ=â0.02). In current UTI episode, 64.5% (142/220) of children with UTI were consulted GPs' prior to seek treatment from tertiary care pediatric unit (pâ=â0.02). While on follow up child who developed UTI, found urine culture isolates were significantly shifted from E. coli and K. pneumoniae to extended spectrum of beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Out of 208 participants, 36 of them had re-current pyelonephritis (R-PN). Renal scarring (RS) was detected in 22 out of 70 patients with pyelonephritis following dimercaptosuccinic acid scan. Following each episodes of recurrent pyelonephritis 11% of new scar formation was detected (pâ=â0.02). Bio film forming E. coli and K. pneumoniae was significantly associated in patients with R-PN (pâ=â0.04).

Case series with chart review. Tertiary-care pediatric otolaryngology practice. Children aged 2 to 18 years treated with either intraoperative bipolar electrocautery or silver nitrate chemical cautery of the anterior nasal septum for recurrent anterior epistaxis. Any reported bleeding event after surgery was recorded. The mean time from surgery to recurrent epistaxis was compared between groups. Fifty patients underwent bipolar electrocautery, while 60 patients underwent silver nitrate chemical cautery. Within 2 years, 1 (2%) patient in the bipolar electrocautery group and 13 (22%) patients in the silver nitrate chemical cautery group had recurrent epistaxis (P = .003). Two years after treatment, there was no difference between treatment groups. Overall, 4 patients (8%) had recurrent epistaxis postoperatively in the bipolar electrocautery group at a mean of 4.34 years after treatment, while 17 (28.3%) patients recurred after a mean of 1.53 years of treatment in the silver nitrate chemical cautery group (P = .01). Compared to those treated with chemical cautery, those treated with bipolar electrocautery had a longer nosebleed-free period and a lower incidence of recurrent epistaxis within 2 years of treatment. Beyond 2 years, the treatment methods are equivocal. Bipolar electrocautery may be a superior treatment in children who will not tolerate in-office chemical cautery, in those with a risk of severe bleeding, or when it can be combined with other operative procedures.

Participants were 40 children aged 7-12 who completed measures of HRQOL, headache-related disability, and headache activity during a baseline period and following a self-directed cognitive-behavioral intervention. The data are supportive of the reliability (internal consistency and test-retest) and validity (criterion related, convergent, known-groups, and responsiveness to intervention) of the PedsQL 4.0 within a pediatric headache sample. We conclude that the PedsQL 4.0 is a reliable and valid measure of HRQOL in children with recurrent headache and captures important information not routinely evaluated in chronic pain populations.\n\nAutologous Tumor Lysate-pulsed Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy for Pediatric Patients with Newly Diagnosed or Recurrent High-grade Gliomas\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLasky, Joseph L.; Panosyan, Eduard H.; Plant, Ashley; Davidson, Tom; Yong, William H.; Prins, Robert M.; Liau, Linda M.; Moore, Theodore B.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nImmunotherapy has the potential to improve clinical outcomes with little toxicity for pediatric patients with brain tumor"
