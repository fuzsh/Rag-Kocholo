        "text": "Stacey Dash is ending her fourth marriage.\n\nThe \"Clueless\" star took to Instagram Thursday to announce she is splitting from her lawyer husband Jeffrey Marty after two years of marriage.\n\n\"My husband and I have made the hard decision of ending our marriage. After much prayer, I feel this is the right path for both of us,\" she wrote in a message posted to her Instagram account.\n\nShe added, \"I wish him nothing but the best. Thank you everyone for your support and respecting our privacy during this difficult time.\"\n\nDash and Marty secretly tied the knot in April 2018. To mark one year of marriage, Dash shared an Instagram video in April 2019 of her holding what appear to be wedding rings as she kisses Marty.\n\n\"The Love of Christ... Thank You Jesus for giving Your life for me. Answering prayers that in this world seem impossible. My children, my husband are my greatest Blessings,\" she wrote.\n\nThe couple had some marital woes in September when Dash was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of domestic battery against Marty.\n\nIn a 911 call obtained by TMZ, Dash can be heard saying, \"I've been assaulted by my husband.\" She told the operator that Marty \"put me into a choke hold\" after she pushed his teen daughter away during an argument.\n\nHowever, authorities told NBC News and Tampa Bay ABC station WFTS that Dash pushed and slapped Marty, leaving scratches on his arm. She was taken into custody and charged.\n\nDash was bailed out of jail by Marty and the charges were eventually dropped.\n\nStacey Dash bailed out of jail by her husband; pleads not guilty to domestic battery\n\nMore: 'Clueless' star Stacey Dash arrested for battery\n\nThe actress was previously married to producer Brian Lovell, executive James Maby and actor Emmanuel Xuereb. She has two children: 16-year-old daughter Lola, with Lovell; and 28-year-old son Austin, from a previous relationship with singer Christopher Williams.\n\nDash is best known for playing Dionne Marie Davenport in the 1995 film \"Clueless.\" In recent years, she worked as a conservative political commentator and ran unsuccessfully for Congress in California."
