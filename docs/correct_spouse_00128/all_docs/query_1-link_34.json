        "text": "Actress turned conservative political pundit Stacey Dash had to cool off behind bars after Pasco County, FL sheriff’s deputies took her to jail overnight following a Sept. 29 domestic violence arrest. The 51-year-old claims in a 911 call that her husband Jeffrey Marty put her in a chokehold after she argued with his 15-year-old daughter and pushed her and that she had visible marks around her neck. But he had scratch marks on his arms, so Stacey was the one who was arrested. We’ve got five things to know about Jeffrey Marty.\n\n1. Jeffrey is Stacey’s fourth husband.\n\nThe pair secretly tied the knot in a Florida ceremony on April 6, 2018, reportedly just ten days after they met. She was previously married to actor Brian Lovell from 1999-2005, British millionaire James Maby from 2005-2006, and actor/producer Emmanuel Xuereb from 2007-2011.\n\n2. Jeffrey is a lawyer.\n\nHe’s an attorney based out of Trinity, FL.\n\n3. Like Stacey, Jeffrey is an avid Donald Trump supporter.\n\nJeffrey uses his Twitter account to retweet many of the president’s tweets, especially ones about the “Fake News Media” and ones critical of his likely 2020 election opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden. He also as Trump’s slogan “MAGA” in his Twitter bio.\n\n4. Jeffrey claims to be deeply religious.\n\nHe uses Bible passages in tweets to criticize Democrats. The first words of his Twitter bio are “Saved by grace” and he retweets lines about “God’s love” from the account @_LoveLike_JESUS.\n\n5. Jeffrey created a Twitter account of a fake Georgia congressman who was the first to support Trump’s presidential campaign."
