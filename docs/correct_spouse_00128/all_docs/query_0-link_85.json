        "text": "Stacey Dash has announced that she's separating from her fourth husband Jeffrey Marty.\n\nThe Clueless actress, 53, took to Instagram to inform fans that she's decided to end their marriage after two years together.\n\n\"My husband and I have made the hard decision of ending our marriage,\" Dash's message read on April 30 (US Time). \"After much prayer, I feel this is the right path for both of us. I wish him nothing but the best. Thank you everyone for your support and [for] respecting our privacy during this difficult time.\"\n\nShe captioned the message with a series of hashtags: \"#Love #Faith #StaceyDash #Redeemed #Warrior #Grace #LifeLesson #Jesus.\"\n\nIt's not clear at this time whether she's filed for divorce or if she's separated from Marty.\n\nIn September last year, Dash was arrested for domestic battery after she allegedly assaulted Marty after an argument at their New York home, according to TMZ.\n\nPolice were called to the property after the domestic dispute where Dash allegedly slapped him, and he had scratches on his left arm. Marty bailed her out of jail shortly after by paying US$500 to the Land-O-Lakes Detention Facility.\n\nThe actress married Marty in April 2018 in Florida after 10 days of dating.\n\nDash rose to fame in 1995 when she played Dionne Davenport in Clueless. She went on to play the character in TV spin-off between 1996 to 1999.\n\nThe actress was previously married to Brian Lovell, James Maby and Emmanuel Xuereb. She shares 16-year-old daughter Lola with Lovell and 28-year-old son Austin Williams from a relationship with Christopher Williams."
