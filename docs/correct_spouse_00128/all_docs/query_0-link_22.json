        "text": "Stacey Dash from \"Clueless\" claims her soon-to-be ex-husband beat her on multiple occasions ... and she got a restraining order against him on the day she filed for divorce.\n\nTMZ obtained the restraining order -- originally signed by a judge January 29 and still in effect -- in which Dash claimed her husband, Emmanuel Xuereb, hit her in the face, head and body during their two-plus years of marriage ... but she was afraid to report it to police.\n\nDash, 44, also claims a drunken Xuereb once violently pinned her down to a bed and threatened her, saying it would be the worst night of her life.\n\nXuereb must stay 100 yards away from Stacey, her two children (neither of whom are his) and the family home. They're due back in court in June."
