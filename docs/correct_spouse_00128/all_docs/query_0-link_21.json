        "text": "Stacey Dash will not be prosecuted in her domestic violence case.\n\nAccording to TMZ in a new report posted on Friday (Oct. 4), prosecutors have dropped the case because a “single scratch” is not enough evidence. The media outlet reports that the injury is minor and there’s no telling if Dash inflicted it. “If Stacey had any physical contact with her husband it was ‘incidental’ on her part,” TMZ reports.\n\nEarlier this week, we reported that Dash was arrested in Florida for domestic violence regarding her new husband, Jeffrey Marty. According to Dash, Marty and his three kids conspired to have her arrested. While speaking with 911, Dash claimed that Marty had her in a chokehold. After taking statements from Marty and his children, cops arrested, booked Dash for assault and held on her a $500 bail.\n\nIn addition to that, Dash stated that Marty coached his 15, 14 and 10-year-old on what to say to authorities. The 52-year-old stated that Marty is a lawyer and knows exactly what to tell his “awful children” to make the story work in his favor. Interestingly enough, on Dash’s police report, she was listed as a white woman. Shortly after, a statement was issued regarding the mistake.\n\nDash’s marriage to Marty marks her fourth tying the knot. Previously, Dash married producer Brian Lovell and their relationship lasted from 1999 to 2005. Shortly after, Dash walked down the aisle with executive James Maby from 2005 to 2006. One year later, Dash married actor Emmanuel Xuereb, however, the two called broke up in 2011.\n\nSince backing out of the race for congress, Dash has stayed out of the public eye for the most part and has made no official statement regarding the issue."
