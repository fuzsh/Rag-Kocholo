R. Petta\n\nPhys. Rev. Research 2, 012006(R) (2020) – Published 8 January 2020\n\nThis paper demonstrates electrically driven single spin Rabi oscillations in the “flopping mode” regime, where the wavefunction of a single electron is delocalized across the two sites of a silicon double quantum dot. Comparable Rabi frequencies are achieved using 250 times less drive power in the flopping mode, as compared with electric dipole spin resonance in a single quantum dot. The flopping-mode driving regime will enable low power control of large-scale spin qubit arrays.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nCondensed Matter Physics\n\nEditors' Suggestion Rapid Communication\n\nDislocation defect as a bulk probe of monopole charge of multi-Weyl semimetals\n\nRodrigo Soto-Garrido, Enrique Muñoz, and Vladimir Juričić\n\nPhys. Rev. Research 2, 012043(R) (2020) – Published 20 February 2020\n\nThe authors show that a dislocation defect can probe the monopole charge characterizing the electronic topology of a multi-Weyl semimetal. To this end, a rather simple mesoscopic setup has been proposed in which this topological invariant leaves a direct imprint on the electrical conductance. Furthermore, the effective pseudo-magnetic flux of the dislocation can be measured in the same setup. These results pave the way for the exploration of the interplay between the lattice and the electronic topology in topological metals.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nCondensed Matter Physics\n\nTopological Insulators\n\nEditors' Suggestion Rapid Communication\n\nEmergent dual topology in the three-dimensional Kane-Mele Pt2HgSe3\n\nAntimo Marrazzo, Nicola Marzari, and Marco Gibertini\n\nPhys. Rev. Research 2, 012063(R) (2020) – Published 13 March 2020\n\nJacutingaite (Pt2HgSe3) is a naturally-occurring layered mineral that, when exfoliated into monolayers, could provide the first physical realization of the Kane-Mele model for a quantum spin Hall insulator. In its bulk form, jacutingaite has been predicted to combine weak and crystalline topological phases. This paper shows that such dual topology emerges from a crucial and surprisingly strong interlayer coupling.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nCondensed Matter Physics\n\nMaterials Science\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nTwo-body collisions in the time-of-flight dynamics of lattice Bose superfluids\n\nAntoine Tenart, Cécile Carcy, Hugo Cayla, Thomas Bourdel, Marco Mancini, and David Clément\n\nPhys.

The authors investigate the validity of the ballistic assumption at the level of single particles, thanks to the detection of individual metastable Helium atoms. They measure the number of two-body collisions occuring during the time of flight and provide with a quantitative estimate of the role of the collisions when atoms are released from a lattice potential\n\nShow Abstract\n\nAtomic and Molecular Physics\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nQuantum speedup of branch-and-bound algorithms\n\nAshley Montanaro\n\nPhys.

Rev. Research 2, 013111 (2020) – Published 3 February 2020\n\nLearning in the brain happens on the basis of pre-existing, task-unrelated connectivity, and structural components created during learning are correlated to this initial connectivity. To investigate how pre-existing and learnt connectivity interact, the authors study dynamics in nonlinear neural network models where connectivity consists of a random part and a correlated low-rank perturbation. By computing fixed points and their stability, they show how correlations between pre-existing and learnt connectivity enrich the dynamical repertoire of the model.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nBiological Physics\n\nNonlinear Dynamics\n\nStatistical Physics\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nHall viscosity of composite fermions\n\nSongyang Pu, Mikael Fremling, and J.

From oceanic to superfluid waves passing by active fluids, the number of edge modes depends on the boundary conditions and does not match with the bulk invariant. This failure is symptomatic of unbounded yet regularized Hamiltonians and is due to the presence of ghost topological modes, revealed by scattering theory, which solves this apparent paradox.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nFluid Dynamics\n\nInterdisciplinary Physics\n\nTopological Insulators\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nQuantifying the inverse spin-Hall effect in highly doped PEDOT:PSS\n\nMohammad M.

Inter-island correlations within an array are found to be asymmetric with respect to the magnetization direction, and even though the array macrostate reproduces from one hysteresis sweep to another, its microstate is stochastic.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nCondensed Matter Physics\n\nMagnetism\n\nStatistical Physics\n\nRapid Communication\n\nTheory of the two-loop self-energy correction to the g factor in nonperturbative Coulomb fields\n\nB.

Research 2, 012002(R) (2020) – Published 3 January 2020\n\nImproving the theoretical accuracy of the bound-electron g factor is of relevance for scrutinizing quantum electrodynamics in strong external fields, as well as for the determination of different fundamental constants. Here the authors present the theoretical foundations of evaluating two-loop self-energy corrections in a non-perturbative nuclear Coulomb field. It is shown that existing treatments of these diagrams in terms of a perturbative expansion in the nuclear coupling strength parameter Zα are not applicable above a certain atomic number.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nQuantum Physics\n\nRapid Communication\n\nHomogeneous Floquet time crystal protected by gauge invariance\n\nAngelo Russomanno, Simone Notarnicola, Federica Maria Surace, Rosario Fazio, Marcello Dalmonte, and Markus Heyl\n\nPhys.

Research 2, 012004(R) (2020) – Published 6 January 2020\n\nThe atoms or particles within amorphous solids—like metallic glass or ice cream—tend to get stuck in one of many possible disordered arrangements. The authors explain a memory behavior in these materials by showing experimentally how one such material recalls past arrangements and thereby reports the magnitudes of past deformations. The memory emerges from the hysteresis of individual rearranging regions, and is similar to the return-point memory that is best known in ferromagnets—despite crucial differences in these materials’ physics.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nSoft Matter\n\nRapid Communication\n\nTransition in relaxation paths in allosteric molecules: Enzymatic kinetically constrained model\n\nTetsuhiro S.

M. Faisal, Kaoru Yamanouchi, and Huailiang Xu\n\nPhys. Rev. Research 2, 012007(R) (2020) – Published 9 January 2020\n\nThe authors generate air lasing by elliptically-modulated intense femtosecond laser pulses and show that the lasing intensities of N2+ at 391 and 428 nm can be manipulated by adjusting the temporal separation between the two polarization components in the elliptically-modulated laser pulse and their relative amplitudes. The authors interpret this characteristic ellipticity dependence in terms of the post-ionization coupling occurring in the later part of the laser pulse, which depletes efficiently the population in the X2 Σg+ (v” = 0) state.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nAtomic and Molecular Physics\n\nRapid Communication\n\nSpin-alignment noise in atomic vapor\n\nA.

Research 2, 012008(R) (2020) – Published 9 January 2020\n\nTwo precessing spins that are parallel (‘oriented’) or antiparallel (‘aligned’) modulate the probe light beam at the precession or double-precession frequency, respectively. Stochastic modulation of light by a spin-system at Larmor frequency is the noise of spin orientation detected in conventional spin noise spectroscopy. Polarization modulation of the probe beam at the double Larmor frequency discovered by the authors in experiments with cesium atoms is ascribed to fluctuations of spin alignment. While the spin-orientation noise is revealed as the noise of gyrotropy, the spin-alignment noise is observed in the fluctuations of linear birefringence.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nAtomic and Molecular Physics\n\nOptics\n\nRapid Communication\n\nZQ Berry phase for higher-order symmetry-protected topological phases\n\nHiromu Araki, Tomonari Mizoguchi, and Yasuhiro Hatsugai\n\nPhys.

The quantized Berry phase has wide applicability ranging from fermionic models with and without interactions to spin models.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nCondensed Matter Physics\n\nTopological Insulators\n\nRapid Communication\n\nSign switching of dimer correlations in SrCu2(BO3)2 under hydrostatic pressure\n\nS.
