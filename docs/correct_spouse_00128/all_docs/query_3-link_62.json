However, Gwen Adams comes from very different roots than Eileen Harris, hailing from Martha’s Vinyard, the exclusive Massachusetts island community.\n\nLydia Tracy and Mats Carlston\n\nYou might know Lydia Tracy from the runways, but chances are you’ve never heard of Mats Carlston.

Lee, still active on the British pop scene.\n\nRutina Wesley and Jacob Fishel\n\nConsidering that she’s a star of the popular HBO series True Blood and he’s basically an unknown, we’re guessing that Rutina wears the pants in this family. Her screen debut was less than five years ago, so Rutina is certainly off to a strong start.\n\nLark Voorhies and Mark-Paul Gosselaar\n\nPretty much every woman in America has had a crush on Mark-Paul Gosselaar since he starred on Saved By The Bell in the 1980s.

Watch for her on the humorous legal procedural Franklin and Bash.\n\nNaomi Campbell and Vladimir Doronin\n\nFor a girl from the working-class suburbs of London, Naomi Campbell has done quite well for herself.

Fans of 227 will remember her as Eva Rawley from a single season of the popular NBC sitcom…\n\nWhoopi Goldberg and Ted Danson\n\nIt’s almost impossible to write a list about mixed-race couples with a black woman and a white man without including this controversial couple.

The pair met on the set of Made In America…\n\nRoger Ebert and Chaz Hammelsmith\n\nThe most famous film critic in the United States is married to Chaz Hammelsmith, a laywer.
