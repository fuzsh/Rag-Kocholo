        "text": "CLUELESS star Stacey Dash walked out on her fourth husband after her domestic violence arrest made headlines, The Sun can exclusively reveal.\n\nThe actress turned conservative pundit left attorney Jeffrey Marty after she was booked in Florida, following a violent argument with him on September 29. They had been married less than a year.\n\nThe pair are yet to file papers, but a source told The Sun on Wednesday night: \"Stacey walked out last year and moved back to LA, they haven't seen each other since but have been in contact.\n\n\"Jeffrey stood by her publicly after the arrest and really wanted to figure things out, but they just weren't on the same page. It's been a very difficult time.\"\n\nHer husband tweeted this week: \"I regretfully inform the world that I am no longer married to @staceydash.\" The tweet has now been removed.\n\nStacey took to Instagram on Thursday to announce her divorce, writing: \"Hello everyone, My husband and I have made the hard decision of ending our marriage. After much prayer, I feel this is the right path for both of us. I wish him nothing but the best. Thank you everyone for your support and respecting our privacy during this difficult time.\"\n\nAudio from a 911 call at the time of her arrest revealed Stacey, 53, was the first one to phone for help after the argument escalated at their home in Pasco County.\n\nShe could be heard shouting and accusing her husband of putting her in a chokehold, which he strongly denied.\n\nOfficers visited the home briefly at 7.45pm but returned at midnight to arrest Stacey after noticing scratch marks on Jeffrey's left upper arm.\n\nAccording to the Pasco Sheriff's Office in Land O' Lakes, about 25 miles north of Tampa, Stacey \"pushed and slapped\" Jeffrey, a dad of three, during the row at their home.\n\nThe report stated: \"The victim sustained red scratch marks to his upper left arm from being pushed.\"\n\nStacey, a frequent supporter of President Donald Trump, claimed she was defending herself after Jeffrey's teenage daughter became aggressive and she pushed her away, during which he intervened.\n\nIn body-cam footage released by the sheriff's department, the former talk show host, who tied the knot in 2018, can be seen being placed in the back of a squad car in handcuffs, while wearing a long t-shirt and flip-flops.\n\nShe is heard telling officers she worked as an actress, after finding fame as ditzy Dionne in the 90s hit film Clueless alongside Alicia Silverstone and the late Brittany Murphy.\n\nMarty paid her $500 bail following her night in a jail cell. The charges were later dropped.\n\nAsked if she had filmed anything recently, Stacey admitted: \"I'm taking a break, I did politics for a while, I was a Fox News contributor.\"\n\nBefore Jeffrey, Stacey was married to Brian Lovell, James Maby and Emmanuel Xuereb and has two older children - Austin and Lola, who she remains close to.\n\nHer Instagram bio still reads: \"Christian Wife Mother and Warrior,\" although her account doesn't feature any photographs of her and Jeffrey and she is not wearing a wedding or engagement ring.\n\nStacey worked for Fox until 2016 and was once suspended for using a profanity on-air while discussing former President Barack Obama's views on terrorism.\n\nShe then campaigned as a Republican for California's 44th district in February 2018 but withdrew from the congressional race just a month later.\n\nDuring her brief political career, the actress, who is part African American, Bajan and Mexican, caused plenty of controversy - calling for Black History Month and BET (Black Entertainment TV) to be scrapped.\n\nHer film and TV credits over the years include the small screen Clueless spin-off series from 1996 to 1999, along with parts in CSI and Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens.\n\nAlthough her acting career has stalled, she continues to land small roles and her IMDB lists three ongoing projects, Dawgtown, Roe v. Wade and Dr Mildred Jefferson.\n\nThe former 90s starlet, who grew up in The Bronx, had a difficult upbringing and has spoken about her personal struggles in the past.\n\nIn her memoir, There Goes My Social Life, she also opened up about being molested as a youngster and her own struggle with drug abuse before getting clean.\n\nThe Sun has reached out to Stacey's rep for comment.\n\nDo you have a story for The US Sun team?\n\nEmail us at exclusive@the-sun.com or call 212 416 4552."
