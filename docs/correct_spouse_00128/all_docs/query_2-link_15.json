        "text": "Stacey Dash is a single lady. After close to two-years of litigation, a judge has finally granted Stacey Dash a divorce from actor Emmanuel Xuereb.\n\nTMZ reports that Dash has been trying to get divorced from Xuereb since January 2010, the day that she filed a restraining order against him. Dash claims that her now ex-husband physically abused her throughout their two-year marriage, but was afraid to report the abuse to police. Dash was granted a restraining order from Xuereb, and now, she is finally a single woman once again.\n\nDash and Xuereb didn’t have any children together, but Dash does have two kids from a prior relationship.\n\nDash, who starred alongside Alicia Silverstone in Clueless, has gone on to have a successful career in TV. She has appeared in shows like The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, CSI, and was a regular on VH1’s Single Ladies. Dash announced recently, however, that she will not be returning for another season of Single Ladies.\n\nDash said:\n\n“I truly enjoyed playing Val on ‘Single Ladies’, but I have decided to leave the show. I have to be back in LA with my children right now and the ‘Single Ladies’ shooting location makes that impossible. I wish VH1 the best of luck with the show and in maintaining the strong fan base we developed in season one.”\n\nDash, who appeared in Playboy at the age of 40, was recently named the hottest 45-year-old on the planet, beating out Halle Berry, in an AskKissy.com poll.\n\nIs Stacey Dash better off without Emmanuel Xuereb?"
