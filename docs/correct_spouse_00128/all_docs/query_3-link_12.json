        "text": "Edwin Starr (January 21, 1942 – April 2, 2003) was an American soul singer. Starr is famous for his Norman Whitfield-produced Motown singles of the 1970s, most notably the number one hit “War”.\n\nStarr was born in Tennessee and raised in Ohio, and later lived in Detroit while singing for Ric Tic and Motown Records. He was backed by the band that would later become known as “Black Merda”. Hawkins and Veasey of the group played on most of his early hits on the Ric Tic Label. Besides “War”, Starr’s songs “25 Miles” and “Stop the War Now” were also major successes in the 1960s. Starr’s career shifted to the United Kingdom in the 1970s, where he continued to produce music, living there until his death.\n\nEarly life\n\nStarr was born Charles Edwin Hatcher in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1942. He and his cousins, soul singers Roger and Willie Hatcher, moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where they were raised.\n\nIn 1957, Starr formed a doo-wop group, the Future Tones, and began his singing career. Starr lived in Detroit, Michigan, in the 1960s and recorded at first for the small Ric-Tic label, part of the Golden World recording company, and later for Motown Records (under the Gordy Records imprint), after the latter absorbed Ric-Tic in 1968.\n\nThe song which launched his career was “Agent Double-O-Soul” (1965), a reference to the James Bond films popular at the time. Other early hits included “Headline News”, “Back Street” and “S.O.S. (Stop Her on Sight)”. While at Ric-Tic, he wrote the song, “Oh, How Happy”, a #12 Billboard Hot 100 hit in 1966 for The Shades of Blue (he would go on to release a version of the song with Blinky in 1969) and sang lead for the Holidays on their #12 R&B hit, “I’ll Love You Forever”. At Motown he recorded a string of singles before enjoying an international success with “25 Miles”, which he co-wrote with producers Johnny Bristol and Harvey Fuqua. It peaked at #6 in both the Hot 100 and R&B Charts in 1968.\n\nIt was when Motown’s Berry Gordy became frustrated with smaller labels like Ric-Tic stealing some of the success of his company that he bought out the label. Many of Starr’s Ric-Tic songs (subsequently owned by Motown) like “Back Street” and “Headline News” became favored Northern Soul classics. His early Ric-Tic hit “Stop Her On Sight (S.O.S.)” was reissued in Britain (with “Headline News” as its B-side) in 1968, and it performed better than the original release on the UK Chart, surpassing the original #35 and peaking at #11. His 1970 song “Time” also helped to establish him as a prominent artist on the Northern Soul scene.\n\nCareer\n\nThe biggest hit of Starr’s career, which cemented his reputation, was the Vietnam War protest song “War” (1970). Starr’s intense vocals transformed a Temptations album track into a number one chart success, which spent three weeks in the top position on the U.S. Billboard charts, an anthem for the antiwar movement and a cultural milestone that continues to resound in movie soundtracks and hip hop music samples. It sold over three million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. “War” appeared on both of Starr's War & Peace album and its follow-up, Involved, produced by Norman Whitfield. Involved also featured another song of similar construction titled “Stop the War Now”, which was a minor hit in its own right.\n\nMoving to England in 1973, Starr continued to record, most notably the song “Hell Up in Harlem” for the 1974 film Hell Up in Harlem, which was the sequel to Black Caesar, an earlier hit with a soundtrack by James Brown. In 1979, Starr reappeared on the charts with a pair of disco hits, “(Eye-to-Eye) Contact” and “H.A.P.P.Y. Radio”. “Contact” was the more successful of the two, peaking at #65 on the US pop charts, #13 on the R&B chart, #1 on the dance chart, and #6 on the UK Singles Chart. “H.A.P.P.Y. Radio” was also a Top Ten hit in the UK, reaching #9 on the chart in mid-1979. By now, he had joined the well-established disco boom and had further singles on 20th Century Records. Over the years, he released tracks on a variety of labels, including Avatar, Calibre, 10 Records, Motown (a return to his former label for a 1989 remix of “25 Miles”), Streetwave and Hippodrome. His Starr café empire still enjoys success in and around Essex.\n\nIn 1985, Starr released “It Ain’t Fair”. Despite garnering the attention of many in the soul and dance clubs, it fell short of becoming a hit. Starr appeared on the charity number one single “Let It Be” by Ferry Aid in 1987. Later that year, Starr teamed up with the Stock, Aitken and Waterman production company for the club hit “Whatever Makes Our Love Grow”. In 1989, a number 17 UK hit by the Cookie Crew called “Got to Keep On” sampled a portion of “25 Miles”. This track was then featured on a 1990 dance medley made for the BRIT Awards, which made number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. A club mix of various artists, it included the previous years remix of “25 Miles”.\n\nIn 1989, Starr also joined Ian Levine’s Motorcity Records, releasing six singles and the album Where Is the Sound, as well as co-writing several songs for other artists on the label. Starr resurfaced briefly in 2000 to team up with the UK band Utah Saints to record a new version of “Funky Music Sho Nuff Turns Me On”. He appeared again in 2002 to record a song with the British musician Jools Holland, singing “Snowflake Boogie” on Holland’s compact disc More Friends; and to record another track with Utah Saints, a so-far-unreleased version of his number one hit “War” – his last-ever recording.\n\nIn late 2002, Edwin Starr appeared with many R&B stars on the “Rhythm, Love, and Soul” edition of the PBS series American Soundtrack. His performance of “25 Miles” was included on the accompanying live album that was released in 2004.\n\nStarr remained a hero on England’s Northern Soul circuit and continued living in England for the remainder of his life.\n\nDeath\n\nOn April 2, 2003, at the age of 61, Starr suffered a heart attack and died while taking a bath at his home in Bramcote near Nottingham. He left a wife, Annette Mary Hatcher, a son André Hatcher, and two grandchildren Alonté Renfroe and Maryah Hatcher.\n\nHis brother Angelo Starr is now fronting the Team, the band Edwin Starr had been touring with for over 20 years. His previous band, Total Concept Unlimited, became Rose Royce after adding a female singer.\n\nHe is buried in Wilford Hill Cemetery in West Bridgford, Nottingham. His headstone reads “Agent 00 Soul”.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nSoul Master (1968)\n\n25 Miles (1969) (#73 US) (#9 R&B)\n\nJust We Two (1969) with Blinky\n\nWar & Peace (1970) (#52 US)(#9 R&B)\n\nInvolved (1971) (# 178 US)(# 45 R&B)\n\nHell Up in Harlem (1974)\n\nFree to Be Myself (1975) (#43 R&B) (#210 US)\n\nClean (1978) (#80 US) (#22 R&B)\n\nHappy Radio (1979) (#115 US) (#44 R&B)\n\nStronger Than You Think I Am (1979) (#203 US)\n\nFor Sale (1983)\n\nWikipedia\n\nBilly Ocean (born Leslie Sebastian Charles; 21 January 1950) is a Trinidadian-born English recording artist who had a string of R&B international pop hits in the 1970s and 1980s. He was the most popular British R&B singer-songwriter of the early to mid-1980s. After scoring his first four UK Top 20 successes, seven years passed before he accumulated a series of transatlantic successes, including three U.S. number ones. In 1985, Ocean won the Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for his worldwide hit, “Caribbean Queen”, and in 1987 was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male Artist.\n\nIn 2002, the University of Westminster, London, awarded Ocean an honorary doctorate of music. In 2010, Ocean was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the MOBO Awards. On 29 July 2011, Ocean became a Companion of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, presented to him by Paul McCartney. He is a member of the Rastafari movement.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life and stardom\n\nOcean was born as Leslie Sebastian Charles in Fyzabad, Trinidad and Tobago, to Hainsley Charles, a Grenadian musician and his wife Violet. He moved to Romford, Essex, England, with his family at the age of ten. He was exposed to music at an early age from his musician father, and, growing up, Ocean realized he was in line to follow his father’s ambitions. During his teenage years, he sang regularly in London clubs while also working as a tailor in London’s Savile Row. He was discovered by his first manager, John Morphew, who recorded a double A side single at Pye Studios in London with a full orchestra, However, the ballad singing style of Les was going out of fashion and Morphew was unable to get any major label to release it. It remains unreleased. Les’s father, who countersigned the management contract as Les was younger than 18 asked Morphew to release him from contract, which he did without penalty. In 1969 he joined a local band “The Shades of Midnight” playing in the Shoreditch area of London. He recorded his first single, “Nashville Rain” backed with “Sun In The Morning”, in 1971 for Spark Records as Les Charles and for two years fronted a studio band called Scorched Earth, with whom he released “On The Run” backed with “Let’s Put Our Emotions in Motion” in 1974.\n\nFollowing his time with Scorched Earth, a routine doctor’s appointment discovered an extra pulmonary node central to his (Billy’s) albeit medically normal lungs. The examination carried out by Dr Clare Greenwood (The O'Malley Clinic, Beverly Hills). This extra lung has been attributed with the longevity of Billy’s singing career.\n\nOcean took his stage name from the Ocean Estate, Stepney in London’s East End, where he was living at the time. In 1976, he recorded his first album, Billy Ocean, with its first single release, “Love Really Hurts Without You”, charting at No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 22 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. He enjoyed club success from the songs “Are You Ready” and “Stay The Night” from the album City Limit – both of which were later covered by La Toya Jackson. More successes ensued, including “L.O.D. (Love on Delivery)”. He also wrote and composed songs for other artists. In 1981, he scored the US R&B chart with “Nights (Feel Like Getting Down).”\n\nThe prime of his international success\n\nOcean’s period of greatest success began with the releases, during 1984, of the album Suddenly and its main single, “Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)”. The song’s title and lyrics were changed for different regions, such that the song is also known as “African Queen” or “European Queen”. The song won Ocean the Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance at the 1985 Grammy Awards. The album’s title track also became a success, peaking at No. 4 in both the U.S. and the UK and the song “Loverboy”, while also being a No. 2 U.S. success in 1985 was also featured in the first scene of the popular UK BBC One TV series Casualty, in 1986.\n\nOcean appeared at Live Aid in 1985, singing “Caribbean Queen” and “Loverboy”, from JFK Stadium in Philadelphia.\n\nHis 1986 album Love Zone also sold well. It included the successful singles “When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going”, the theme from the film The Jewel of the Nile; this was a No. 1 success in the UK and a No. 2 in the United States; and “There’ll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)” (a U.S. No. 1, and also a major UK success). Also included were the title track and “Love Is Forever”, which were No. 10 and No. 16 U.S. successes for Ocean, respectively.\n\nIn February 1986, Ocean’s video of “When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going” was banned by the BBC, owing to such non-union members as the American actors Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito, all three of whom were cast members of Romancing The Stone and The Jewel of the Nile, miming to the backing vocals. At the 1987 BRIT Awards, Ocean was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male.\n\nOcean’s next album, Tear Down These Walls (1988), featured another No. 1 single, “Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car”, while the album was certified platinum.\n\nLater career\n\nHis 1993 album Time to Move On failed to produce any major successes, but his 1989 Greatest Hits collection has been a steady seller over the years, and his 1997 compilation Love Is For Ever made No. 7 on the UK album chart. Ocean’s last studio album for Jive Records was Time to Move On, which he recorded in Chicago with R&B star R. Kelly. R. Kelly had been a longtime admirer of the way Ocean was able to mix the more emotive soul style with a crossover popular style.\n\nIn 2002, the University of Westminster in London awarded Ocean an honorary doctorate of music. The awards ceremony took place in the Barbican Centre, in London. He continues to tour and record in Europe. Ocean is now a patron for Tech Music Schools in London, made up of Drumtech, Vocaltech, Guitar-X and Keyboardtech. He regularly visits to hold clinics and seminars for the students.\n\nIn 2004, “Caribbean Queen” was re-released as a digital single for its 20th anniversary, shooting up to No. 25 on the Billboard digital singles chart and garnering radio play across the United States and UK. A remix of the single by will.i.am was released in 2005.\n\nIn October 2007, Ocean commenced his first UK tour in more than 15 years. In February and March 2008 he toured Australia and the Far East. His album Because I Love You was released on 2 February 2009. To coincide with this tour and album launch, Ocean worked with Adoseof Design on a revision of Ocean’s website.\n\nIn April 2010, an 18-track compilation album was released in the UK by Sony Music titled The Very Best of Billy Ocean to tie in with a 30-date tour of the UK and Ireland. Featuring Ocean’s biggest hits, the album debuted in the UK Albums Chart at No. 17.\n\nOn 20 October 2010, Ocean was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the MOBO Awards.\n\nOn 29 July 2011, Ocean became a Companion of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. His title was presented by former Beatle Paul McCartney.\n\nIn 2012, Ocean made a cameo appearance in the British comedy movie Keith Lemon: The Film as Lemon’s father.\n\nIn January 2016, Ocean appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to perform some of his classic hits as part of a promo tour for his new album.\n\nOcean has announced a Spring Tour 2017 in the UK during March and April 2017.\n\nDiscography\n\nPersonal life\n\nOcean lives in Sunningdale, Berkshire with his wife Judy, which he has done so since 1978. They have three children: Cherie, Anthony and Rachel. Anthony played rugby sevens at the 2014 Commonwealth Games for Barbados.\n\nOcean-penned songs recorded by other artists\n\n“Are You Ready?\" – La Toya Jackson\n\n\"Stay the Night\" – La Toya Jackson\n\n\"Love Is a Dangerous Game\" – Millie Jackson\n\n\"Love Is\" – Randy Crawford\n\n\"Love Really Hurts Without You\" – Bad Boys Blue\n\n\"Taking Chances\" – Ray, Goodman & Brown\n\n\"Waiting For You\" – Boyzone\n\n\"Whatever Turns You On\" – The Dells\n\n\"Who’s Gonna Rock You\" – The Nolans\n\n\"Red Light Spells Danger\" – Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May as the \"Top Gear Band” on Top Gear of the Pops\n\n“Suddenly\" – Marti Pellow\n\n\"Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car\" – GWAR\n\n\"When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going” – Boyzone\n\nWikipedia\n\nHuddie William Ledbetter /ˈhjuːdi/ (January 20, 1889 – December 6, 1949) was an American folk and blues musician notable for his strong vocals, virtuosity on the twelve-string guitar, and the folk standards he introduced. He is best known as Lead Belly. Though many releases list him as “Leadbelly”, he himself wrote it as “Lead Belly”, which is also the spelling on his tombstone and the spelling used by the Lead Belly Foundation.\n\nLead Belly usually played a twelve-string guitar, but he also played the piano, mandolin, harmonica, violin, and “windjammer” (diatonic accordion). In some of his recordings he sang while clapping his hands or stomping his foot.\n\nLead Belly’s songs covered a wide range, including gospel music; blues about women, liquor, prison life, and racism; and folk songs about cowboys, prison, work, sailors, cattle herding, and dancing. He also wrote songs about people in the news, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Adolf Hitler, Jean Harlow, Jack Johnson , the Scottsboro Boys and Howard Hughes.\n\nLead Belly was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nLead Belly was born Huddie William Ledbetter on the Jeter Plantation near Mooringsport, Louisiana, in either January 1888 or 1889. The 1900 United States Census lists “Hudy Ledbetter” as 12 years old, born January 1888, and the 1910 and 1930 censuses also give his age as corresponding to a birth in 1888. The 1940 census lists his age as 51, with information supplied by wife, Martha. However, in April 1942, when Ledbetter filled out his World War II draft registration, he gave his birth date as January 23, 1889, and his birthplace as Freeport, Louisiana. His grave marker bears the date given on his draft registration.\n\nLedbetter was the younger of two children born to Wesley Ledbetter and Sallie Brown. The pronunciation of his name is purported to be “HYEW-dee” or “HUGH-dee.” He can be heard pronouncing his name as “HYEW-dee” on the track “Boll Weevil,” from the Smithsonian Folkways album Lead Belly Sings for Children. His parents had cohabited for several years, but they legally married on February 26, 1888. When Huddie was five years old, the family settled in Bowie County, Texas.\n\nBy 1903, Huddie was already a “musicianer”, a singer and guitarist of some note. He performed for nearby Shreveport audiences in St. Paul’s Bottoms, a notorious red-light district there. He began to develop his own style of music after exposure to various musical influences on Shreveport’s Fannin Street, a row of saloons, brothels, and dance halls in the Bottoms, now referred to as Ledbetter Heights.\n\nThe 1910 census of Harrison County, Texas, shows “Hudy” Ledbetter living next door to his parents with his first wife, Aletha “Lethe” Henderson. Aletha is registered as age 19 and married one year. Others say she was 15 when they married in 1898. It was in Texas that Ledbetter received his first instrument, an accordion from his uncle Terrell. By his early twenties, having fathered at least two children, Ledbetter left home to make his living as a guitarist and occasional laborer.\n\nInfluenced by the sinking of the Titanic in April 1912, Ledbetter wrote the song “The Titanic”, his first composed on the twelve-string guitar, which later became his signature instrument. Initially played when performing with Blind Lemon Jefferson (1897–1929) in and around Dallas, Texas, the song is about champion African-American boxer Jack Johnson’s being denied passage on the Titanic. Johnson had in fact been denied passage on a ship for being Black, but it was not the Titanic. Still, the song includes the lyric “Jack Johnson tried to get on board. The Captain, he says, ‘I ain’t haulin’ no coal!’ Fare thee, Titanic! Fare thee well!” Ledbetter later noted he had to leave out this passage when playing in front of white audiences.\n\nPrison years\n\nLedbetter’s volatile temper sometimes led him into trouble with the law. In 1915, he was convicted of carrying a pistol and sentenced to time on the Harrison County chain gang. He escaped, finding work in nearby Bowie County under the assumed name of Walter Boyd. In January 1918 he was imprisoned at the Imperial Farm (now Central Unit) in Sugar Land, Texas, after killing one of his own relatives, Will Stafford, in a fight over a woman. While there he may have first heard the traditional prison song “Midnight Special”. In 1925 he was pardoned and released after writing a song to Governor Pat Morris Neff seeking his freedom, having served the minimum seven years of a 7- to 35-year sentence. Combined with his good behavior (which included entertaining the guards and fellow prisoners), his appeal to Neff’s strong religious beliefs proved sufficient. It was a testament to his persuasive powers, as Neff had run for governor on a pledge not to issue pardons (the only recourse for prisoners, since in most Southern prisons there was no provision for parole). According to Charles K. Wolfe and Kip Lornell, in their book The Life and Legend of Leadbelly (1999), Neff had regularly brought guests to the prison on Sunday picnics to hear Ledbetter perform.\n\nIn 1930 Ledbetter was sentenced to Louisiana’s Angola Prison Farm after a summary trial for attempted homicide for stabbing a white man in a fight. He was “discovered” there three years later during a visit by folklorists John Lomax and his son Alan Lomax.\n\nDeeply impressed by Ledbetter’s vibrant tenor and extensive repertoire, the Lomaxes recorded him in 1933 on portable aluminum disc recording equipment for the Library of Congress. They returned with new and better equipment in July 1934, recording hundreds of his songs. On August 1, Ledbetter was released after having again served nearly all of his minimum sentence, following a petition the Lomaxes had taken to Louisiana Governor Oscar K. Allen at his urgent request. It was on the other side of a recording of his signature song, “Goodnight Irene.”\n\nA prison official later wrote to John Lomax denying that Ledbetter’s singing had anything to do with his release from Angola (state prison records confirm he was eligible for early release due to good behavior). However, both Ledbetter and the Lomaxes believed that the record they had taken to the governor had hastened his release from prison.\n\nThe nickname “Lead Belly”\n\nThere are several conflicting stories about how Ledbetter acquired the nickname “Lead Belly”, but he probably acquired it while in prison. Some claim his fellow inmates called him “Lead Belly” as a play on his family name and his physical toughness. It is recounted that during his second prison term, another inmate stabbed him in the neck (leaving him with a fearsome scar he subsequently covered with a bandana); Ledbetter nearly killed his attacker with his own knife. Others say he earned the name after being wounded in the stomach with buckshot. Another theory is that the name refers to his ability to drink moonshine, the homemade liquor which Southern farmers, black and white, made to supplement their incomes. Blues singer Big Bill Broonzy thought it came from a supposed tendency to lay about as if “with a stomach weighted down by lead” in the shade when the chain gang was supposed to be working. Or it may be simply a corruption of his last name pronounced with a Southern accent. Whatever its origin, he adopted the nickname as a pseudonym while performing.\n\nLife after prison\n\nWhen Lead Belly was released from prison, the United States was deep in the Great Depression, and jobs were very scarce. In September 1934, in need of regular work in order to avoid cancellation of his release from prison, Lead Belly asked John Lomax to take him on as a driver. For three months he assisted the 67-year-old in his folk song collecting around the South. (Alan Lomax was ill and did not accompany his father on this trip.)\n\nIn December Lead Belly participated in a “smoker” (group sing) at a Modern Language Association meeting at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where the senior Lomax had a prior lecturing engagement. He was written up in the press as a convict who had sung his way out of prison. On New Year’s Day, 1935, the pair arrived in New York City, where Lomax was scheduled to meet with his publisher, Macmillan, about a new collection of folk songs. The newspapers were eager to write about the “singing convict,” and Timemagazine made one of its first March of Time newsreels about him. Lead Belly attained fame (although not fortune).\n\nThe following week, he began recording for the American Record Corporation, but these recordings achieved little commercial success. He recorded over 40 sides for ARC (intended to be released on their Banner, Melotone, Oriole, Perfect, and Romeo labels and their short-lived Paramount series), but only five sides were actually issued. Part of the reason for the poor sales may have been that ARC released only his blues songs rather than the folk songs for which he would later become better known. Lead Belly continued to struggle financially. Like many performers, what income he made during his career would come from touring, not from record sales.\n\nIn February 1935, he married his girlfriend, Martha Promise, who came north from Louisiana to join him.\n\nThe month of February was spent recording his repertoire and those of other African Americans and interviews about his life with Alan Lomax for their forthcoming book, Negro Folk Songs As Sung by Lead Belly (1936). Concert appearances were slow to materialize. In March 1935, Lead Belly accompanied John Lomax on a previously scheduled two-week lecture tour of colleges and universities in the Northeast, culminating at Harvard.\n\nAt the end of the month, John Lomax decided he could no longer work with Lead Belly and gave him and Martha money to go back to Louisiana by bus. He gave Martha the money her husband had earned during three months of performing, but in installments, on the pretext Lead Belly would spend it all on drinking if given a lump sum. From Louisiana, Lead Belly successfully sued Lomax for both the full amount and release from his management contract. The quarrel was bitter, with hard feelings on both sides. Curiously, in the midst of the legal wrangling, Lead Belly wrote to Lomax proposing they team up again, but it was not to be. Further, the book about Lead Belly published by the Lomaxes in the fall of the following year proved a commercial failure.\n\nIn January 1936, Lead Belly returned to New York on his own, without John Lomax, in an attempted comeback. He performed twice a day at Harlem’s Apollo Theater during the Easter season in a live dramatic recreation of the March of Time newsreel (itself a recreation) about his prison encounter with John Lomax, where he had worn stripes, though by this time he was no longer associated with Lomax.\n\nLife magazine ran a three-page article titled “Lead Belly: Bad Nigger Makes Good Minstrel” in its issue of April 19, 1937. It included a full-page, color (rare in those days) picture of him sitting on grain sacks playing his guitar and singing. Also included was a striking picture of Martha Promise (identified in the article as his manager); photos showing Lead Belly’s hands playing the guitar (with the caption “these hands once killed a man”); Texas Governor Pat M. Neff; and the “ramshackle” Texas State Penitentiary. The article attributes both of his pardons to his singing of his petitions to the governors, who were so moved that they pardoned him. The text of the article ends with “he… may well be on the brink of a new and prosperous period.”\n\nLead Belly failed to stir the enthusiasm of Harlem audiences. Instead, he attained success playing at concerts and benefits for an audience of leftist folk music aficionados. He developed his own style of singing and explaining his repertoire in the context of Southern black culture, having learned from his participation in Lomax’s college lectures. He was especially successful with his repertoire of children’s game songs (as a younger man in Louisiana he had sung regularly at children’s birthday parties in the black community). He was written about as a heroic figure by the black novelist Richard Wright, then a member of the Communist Party, in the columns of the Daily Worker, of which Wright was the Harlem editor. The two men became personal friends, though some say Lead Belly himself was apolitical and if anything was a supporter of Wendell Willkie, the centrist Republican candidate for President, for whom he wrote a campaign song. However, he also wrote the song “Bourgeois Blues”, which has radical or left-wing lyrics.\n\nIn 1939, Lead Belly was back in jail for assault after stabbing a man in a fight in Manhattan. Alan Lomax, then 24, took him under his wing and helped raise money for his legal expenses, dropping out of graduate school to do so. After his release (in 1940–41), Lead Belly appeared as a regular on Alan Lomax and Nicholas Ray’s groundbreaking CBS radio show Back Where I Come From, broadcast nationwide. He also appeared in nightclubs with Josh White, becoming a fixture in New York City’s surging folk music scene and befriending the likes of Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, Woody Guthrie, and a young Pete Seeger, all fellow performers on Back Where I Come From. During the first half of the decade, he recorded for RCA, the Library of Congress, and Moe Asch (future founder of Folkways Records) and in 1944 went to California, where he recorded strong sessions for Capitol Records. He lodged with a studio guitar player on Merrywood Drive in Laurel Canyon.\n\nLead Belly was the first American country blues musician to achieve success in Europe.\n\nIn 1949, Lead Belly had a regular radio broadcast on station WNYC in New York, on Henrietta Yurchenco’s show on Sunday nights. Later in the year he began his first European tour with a trip to France, but fell ill before its completion and was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig’s disease (a motor neuron disease). His final concert was at the University of Texas at Austin in a tribute to his former mentor, John Lomax, who had died the previous year. Martha also performed at that concert, singing spirituals with her husband.\n\nLead Belly died later that year in New York City and was buried in the Shiloh Baptist Church cemetery, in Mooringsport, Louisiana, 8 miles (13 km) west of Blanchard, in Caddo Parish. He is honored with a statue across from the Caddo Parish Courthouse, in Shreveport.\n\nTechnique\n\nLead Belly styled himself “King of the Twelve-String Guitar,” and despite his use of other instruments like the accordion, the most enduring image of Lead Belly as a performer is wielding his unusually large Stella twelve-string. This guitar had a slightly longer scale length than a standard guitar, slotted tuners, ladder bracing, and a trapeze-style tailpiece to resist bridge lifting.\n\nLead Belly played with finger picks much of the time, using a thumb pick to provide a walking bass line and occasionally to strum. This technique, combined with low tunings and heavy strings, gives many of his recordings a piano-like sound. Lead Belly’s tuning is debated, but it seems to be a down-tuned variant of standard tuning; it is likely that he tuned his guitar strings relative to one another, so that the actual notes shifted as the strings wore. Lead Belly’s playing style was popularized by Pete Seeger, who adopted the twelve-string guitar in the 1950s and released an instructional LP and book using Lead Belly as an exemplar of technique.\n\nIn some of the recordings in which Lead Belly accompanied himself, he would make an unusual type of grunt between his verses, best described as “Haah!” “Looky Looky Yonder,” “Take This Hammer,” “Linin’ Track” and “Julie Ann Johnson” feature this unusual vocalization. In “Take This Hammer,” Lead Belly explained, “Every time the men say, 'Haah,’ the hammer falls. The hammer rings, and we swing, and we sing.” The “haah” sound can be heard in work chants sung by Southern railroad section workers, “gandy dancers,” in which it was used to coordinate work crews as they laid and maintained tracks.\n\nLegacy\n\nLead Belly’s work has been widely covered by subsequent musical acts, including Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, Johnny Rivers (“Midnight Special”), Delaney Davidson, Tom Russell, Lonnie Donegan, Bryan Ferry (“Goodnight, Irene”), the Beach Boys (“Cotton Fields”), Creedence Clearwater Revival (“Midnight Special”, “Cotton Fields”), Elvis Presley, ABBA, Pete Seeger, the Weavers, Harry Belafonte, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, the Animals, Jay Farrar, Johnny Cash, Tom Petty, Dr. John, Ry Cooder, Davy Graham, Maria Muldaur, Rory Block, Grateful Dead, Gene Autry, Odetta, Billy Childish (who named his son Huddie), Mungo Jerry, Paul King, Van Morrison, Michelle Shocked, Tom Waits (“Goodnight, Irene”), Scott H. Biram, Ron Sexsmith, British Sea Power, Rod Stewart, Ernest Tubb, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Ram Jam, Spiderbait (“Black Betty”), Blind Willies (“In the Pines”), the White Stripes (“Boll Weevil”), the Fall, Hole, Smog, Old Crow Medicine Show, Spiderbait, Meat Loaf, Ministry, Raffi, Rasputina, Rory Gallagher (“Out on the Western Plains”), the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Deer Tick, Hugh Laurie, X, Bill Frisell, Koerner, Ray & Glover, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, Meat Puppets, Mark Lanegan, WZRD (“Where Did You Sleep Last Night”), Keith Richards, and Phil Lee (“I Got Stripes”).\n\nModern rock audiences often owe their familiarity with Lead Belly to Nirvana’s performance of “Where Did You Sleep Last Night” on a televised concert later released as MTV Unplugged in New York. Singer-guitarist Kurt Cobain refers to his attempt to convince David Geffen to purchase Lead Belly’s guitar for him in an interval before the song is played (connecting the song with Lead Belly in a way that is more tangible than the liner notes where Lead Belly appears on other albums). In his notebooks, Cobain listed Lead Belly's Last Session Vol. 1 as one of the 50 albums most influential in the formation of Nirvana’s sound.\n\nDiscography\n\nThe Library of Congress recordings\n\nThe Library of Congress recordings, made by John and Alan Lomax from 1934 to 1943, were released in a six-volume series by Rounder Records:\n\nMidnight Special (1991)\n\nGwine Dig a Hole to Put the Devil In (1991)\n\nLet It Shine on Me (1991)\n\nThe Titanic (1994)\n\nNobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen (1994)\n\nGo Down Old Hannah (1995)\n\n“You Don’t Know My Mind” (2002) Acrobat label UK\n\nFolkways recordings\n\nThe Folkways recordings, done for Moses Asch from 1941 to 1947, were released in a three-volume series by Smithsonian Folkways:\n\nWhere Did You Sleep Last Night, Lead Belly Legacy, vol.1 (1996)\n\nBourgeois Blues, Lead Belly Legacy, vol. 2 (1997)\n\nShout On, Lead Belly Legacy, vol. 3 (1998)\n\nSmithsonian Folkways has released several other collections of his recordings:\n\nLeadbelly Sings Folk Songs (1989)\n\nLead Belly’s Last Sessions (4-CD box set) (1994), recorded late 1948 in New York City; his only commercial recordings on magnetic tape\n\nLead Belly Sings for Children (1999), including the 1960 Folkways album Negro Folk Songs for Young People in its entirety; five of the six tracks from the 1941 album Play Parties in Song and Dance as Sung by Lead Belly, recorded for Moses Asch; other songs recorded for Asch from 1941 to 1948; and one previously unreleased track, a radio broadcast of “Take This Hammer”\n\nFolkways: The Original Vision, Woody Guthrie and Lead Belly (2004), expanded version of the 1989 compilation\n\nLead Belly: The Smithsonian Folkways Collection (2015)\n\nLive recordings\n\nLeadbelly Recorded in Concert, University of Texas, Austin, June 15, 1949 (1973, Playboy Records PB 119)\n\nOther compilations\n\nHuddie Ledbetter’s Best (1989, BGO Records), containing recordings made for Capitol Records in 1944 in California\n\nKing of the 12-String Guitar (1991, Sony/Legacy Records), a collection of blues songs and prison ballads recorded in 1935 in New York City for the American Record Company, including previously unreleased alternate takes\n\nPrivate Party November 21, 1948 (2000, Document Records), containing Lead Belly’s intimate performance at a private party in late 1948 in Minneapolis\n\nTake This Hammer, When the Sun Goes Down series, vol. 5 (2003, RCA Victor/Bluebird Jazz), CD collection of all 26 songs Lead Belly recorded for Victor Records in 1940, half of which feature the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet (a 1968 LP released by RCA Victor included about half of these recordings)\n\nA Leadbelly Memorial, Vol II (1963, Stinson Records, SLP 19), red vinyl pressing\n\nThe Definitive Lead Belly (2008, Not Now Music), a 50-song retrospective on two CDs\n\nWikipedia\n\nEtta James (born Jamesetta Hawkins; January 25, 1938 – January 20, 2012) was an American singer who performed in various genres, including blues, R&B, soul, rock and roll, jazz and gospel. Starting her career in 1954, she gained fame with hits such as “The Wallflower”, “At Last”, “Tell Mama”, “Something’s Got a Hold on Me”, and “I’d Rather Go Blind”. She faced a number of personal problems, including heroin addiction, severe physical abuse, and incarceration, before making a musical comeback in the late 1980s with the album Seven Year Itch.\n\nJames’ powerful, earthy voice bridged the gap between rhythm and blues and rock and roll. She won six Grammy Awards and 17 Blues Music Awards. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, the Blues Hall of Fame in 2001, and the Grammy Hall of Fame in both 1999 and 2008. Rolling Stone magazine ranked James number 22 on its list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time and number 62 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists.\n\nEarly life and career: 1938–1959\n\nHawkins was born on January 25, 1938, in Los Angeles, California, to Dorothy Hawkins, who was 14 at the time. Her father has never been identified. James speculated that he was the pool player Rudolf “Minnesota Fats” Wanderone, whom she met briefly in 1987. Her mother was frequently absent from their apartment in Watts, conducting relationships with various men, and Jamesetta lived with a series of foster parents, most notably “Sarge” and “Mama” Lu. James referred to her mother as “the Mystery Lady”.\n\nJames received her first professional vocal training at the age of five from James Earle Hines, musical director of the Echoes of Eden choir at the St. Paul Baptist Church, in south-central Los Angeles. Under his tutelage, she suffered physical abuse during her formative years, with her instructor often punching her in the chest while she sang to force her to voice to come from her gut. As a consequence, she developed an unusually strong voice for a child her age. She became a popular singing attraction, and Sarge tried unsuccessfully to pressure the church into compensating their family for her singing.\n\nSarge, like the musical director for the choir, was also abusive. During drunken poker games at home, he would awaken Jamesetta in the early morning hours and force her with beatings to sing for his friends. She was a bed-wetter and often soaked with urine on these occasions. The trauma of her foster father forcing her to sing under these humiliating circumstances led to difficulties for her to sing on demand throughout her career.\n\nIn 1950, Mama Lu died, and Jamesetta’s biological mother took her to the Fillmore district of San Francisco. Within a couple of years, she began listening to doo-wop and was inspired to form a girl group, the Creolettes (because of the members’ light-skinned complexions).\n\nAt the age of 14, she met the musician Johnny Otis. Stories on how they met vary. In Otis’s version, she came to his hotel after one of his performances in the city and persuaded him to audition her. Another story was that Otis spotted the Creolettes performing at a Los Angeles nightclub and sought for them to record his “answer song” to Hank Ballard’s “Work with Me, Annie”. Otis took the group under his wing, helping them sign to Modern Records and changing their name from the Creolettes to the Peaches. He also gave the singer her stage name, transposing Jamesetta into Etta James. James recorded the version, for which she was given credit as co-author, in 1954, and the record was released in early 1955 as “Dance with Me, Henry”. The original the name of the song was “Roll with Me, Henry”, but it was changed to avoid censorship due to the off-color title (roll connoting sexual activity). In February of that year, the song reached number one on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Tracks chart. Its success gave the group an opening spot on Little Richard’s national tour.\n\nWhile James was on tour with Richard, the pop singer Georgia Gibbs recorded a version of James’s song, which was released under the title “The Wallflower” and became a crossover hit, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, which angered James. After leaving the Peaches, James had another R&B hit with “Good Rockin’ Daddy” but struggled with follow-ups. When her contract with Modern came up for renewal in 1960, she signed a contract with Chess Records instead. Shortly afterwards she was involved in a relationship with the singer Harvey Fuqua, the founder of the doo-wop group the Moonglows.\n\nThe musician Bobby Murray, known as Taters, toured with James for 20 years. He wrote that James had her first hit single when she was 15 years old and went steady with B.B. King in Memphis when she was 16. James believed that King’s hit single “Sweet Sixteen” was about her. In early 1955, she and an aspiring singer, the 19-year-old Elvis Presley, then recording for Sun Studios and a huge fan of King, shared a bill in a large club just outside Memphis. In her autobiography, she noted how impressed she was with the young singer’s manners. She also recalled how happy he made her many years later when she found out that it was Presley who had moved her close friend Jackie Wilson from a substandard convalescent home to a more appropriate facility and, as she put it, paid all the expenses. Presley died a year later. Wilson went on to live for another ten years in the care center Presley found for him.\n\nChess and Warner Brothers years: 1960–1978\n\nDueting with Harvey Fuqua, James recorded for Argo Records (later renamed Cadet Records), a label established by Chess. Her first hit singles with Fuqua were “If I Can’t Have You” and “Spoonful”. Her first solo hit was the doo-wop styled rhythm-and-blues song “All I Could Do Was Cry”, which was a number two R&B hit. Chess Records co-founder Leonard Chess envisioned James as a classic ballad stylist who had potential to cross over to the pop charts and soon surrounded the singer with violins and other string instruments. The first string-laden ballad James recorded was “My Dearest Darling” in May 1960, which peaked in the top five of the R&B chart. James sang background vocals for her labelmate Chuck Berry on his “Back in the U.S.A.”\n\nHer debut album, At Last!, was released in late 1960 and was noted for its varied selection of music, from jazz standards to blues to doo-wop and rhythm and blues (R&B). The album included the future classic “I Just Want to Make Love to You” and “A Sunday Kind of Love”. In early 1961, James released what was to become her signature song, “At Last”, which reached number two on the R&B chart and number 47 on the Billboard Hot 100. Though the record was not as successful as expected, her rendition has become the best-known version of the song. James followed that with “Trust in Me”, which also included string instruments. Later that same year, James released a second studio album, The Second Time Around. The album took the same direction as her first, covering jazz and pop standards and with strings on many of the songs. It produced two hit singles, “Fool That I Am” and “Don’t Cry Baby”.\n\nJames started adding gospel elements in her music the following year, releasing “Something’s Got a Hold on Me”, which peaked at number four on the R&B chart and was a Top 40 pop hit. That success was quickly followed by “Stop the Wedding”, which reached number six on the R&B chart and also had gospel elements. In 1963, she had another major hit with “Pushover” and released the live album Etta James Rocks the House, recorded at the New Era Club in Nashville, Tennessee. After a couple years of minor hits, James’s career started to suffer after 1965. After a period of isolation, she returned to recording in 1967 and reemerged with more gutsy R&B numbers thanks to her recording at the legendary FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. These sessions yielded her comeback hit “Tell Mama”, co-written by Clarence Carter, which reached number ten R&B and number twenty-three pop. An album of the same name was also released that year and included her take on Otis Redding’s “Security”. The B-side of “Tell Mama” was “I’d Rather Go Blind”, which became a blues classic and has been recorded by many other artists. In her autobiography, Rage to Survive, she wrote that she heard the song outlined by her friend Ellington “Fugi” Jordan when she visited him in prison. According to her account, she wrote the rest of the song with Jordan, but for tax reasons gave her songwriting credit to her partner at the time, Billy Foster.\n\nFollowing this success, James became an in-demand concert performer though she never again reached the heyday of her early to mid-1960s success. Her records continued to chart in the R&B Top 40 in the early 1970s, with singles such as “Losers Weepers” (1970) and “I Found a Love” (1972). Though James continued to record for Chess, she was devastated by the death of Leonard Chess in 1969. James ventured into rock and funk with the release of her self-titled album in 1973, with production from the famed rock producer Gabriel Mekler, who had worked with Steppenwolf and Janis Joplin, who had admired James and had covered “Tell Mama” in concert. The album, known for its mixture of musical styles, was nominated for a Grammy Award. The album did not produce any major hits; neither did the follow-up, Come a Little Closer, in 1974, though, like Etta James before it, the album was also critically acclaimed. James continued to record for Chess (now owned by All Platinum Records), releasing one more album in 1976, Etta Is Betta Than Evvah! Her 1978 album Deep in the Night, produced by Jerry Wexler for Warner Bros., incorporated more rock-based music in her repertoire. That same year, James was the opening act for the Rolling Stones and performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Following this brief success, however, she left Chess Records and did not record for another ten years as she struggled with drug addiction and alcoholism.\n\nLater career: 1984–2012\n\nThough she continued to perform, little was heard of James until 1984, when she contacted David Wolper and asked to perform in the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics, at which she sang “When the Saints Go Marching In”. In 1987 she performed “Rock & Roll Music” with Chuck Berry in the documentary film Hail! Hail! Rock ‘n’ Roll.\n\nIn 1989, she signed with Island Records and released the albums Seven Year Itch and Stickin’ to My Guns, both of which were produced by Barry Beckett and recorded at FAME Studios. Also in 1989 James was filmed in a concert at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles with Joe Walsh and Albert Collins for the film Jazzvisions: Jump the Blues Away. Many of the backing musicians were top-flight players from Los Angeles: Rick Rosas (bass), Michael Huey (drums), Ed Sanford (Hammond B3 organ), Kip Noble (piano) and Josh Sklair, her longtime guitar player.\n\nJames participated with the rap singer Def Jef on the song “Droppin’ Rhymes on Drums”, which mixed James’s jazz vocals with hip-hop. In 1992, she recorded the album The Right Time, produced by Jerry Wexler for Elektra Records. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nJames signed with Private Music Records in 1993 and recorded a Billie Holiday tribute album, Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday. The album set a trend of incorporating more jazz elements in James’s music. The album won James her first Grammy Award, for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female, in 1994. In 1995, her autobiography, A Rage to Survive, co-written with David Ritz, was published. Also in 1995, she recorded the album Time After Time. A Christmas album, Etta James Christmas, was released in 1998.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, James’s earlier classic music was being used in commercials, including “I Just Wanna Make Love to You”. After of the song was used in a UK commercial, it reached the top ten on the UK charts in 1996.\n\nBy 1998, with the release of Life, Love & the Blues, she had added her sons, Donto and Sametto, on drums and bass, respectively. They continued as part of her touring band. She went on recording for Private Music, released the blues album Matriarch of the Blues in 2000, on which she returned to her R&B roots; Rolling Stone hailed it as a “solid return to roots”, further stating that with this album she was “reclaiming her throne—and defying anyone to knock her off it”. In 2001, she was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the latter for her contributions to the developments of both rock and roll and rockabilly. In 2003, she received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. On her 2004 release, Blue Gardenia, she returned to a jazz style. Her final album for Private Music, Let’s Roll, released in 2005, and won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked her number 62 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\nJames performed at the top jazz festivals in the world, such as the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1977, 1989, 1990 and 1993. She performed nine times at the legendary Monterey Jazz Festival and five times at the San Francisco Jazz Festival. She also often performed at free summer arts festivals throughout the United States.\n\nIn 2008, James was portrayed by Beyoncé Knowles in the film Cadillac Records, a fictional account of Chess Records, James’s label for 18 years, and how label founder and producer Leonard Chess helped the career of James and other others. The film portrayed her pop hit “At Last”. James and Knowles were seen embracing at a red-carpet event following the film’s release. James later said that her previous critical remarks about Knowles for having performed “At Last” at the inauguration of Barack Obama were a joke stemming from how she felt hurt that she herself was not invited to sing her song. It was later revealed that Alzheimer’s disease and “drug induced dementia” had contributed to her negative comments about Knowles.\n\nIn April 2009, at the age of 71, James made her final television appearance, performing “At Last” on the program Dancing with the Stars. In May 2009, she received the Soul/Blues Female Artist of the Year award from the Blues Foundation, the ninth time she won the award. She carried on touring but by 2010 had to cancel concert dates because of her gradually failing health, after it was revealed that she was suffering from dementia and leukemia. In November 2011, James released her final album, The Dreamer, which was critically acclaimed upon its release. She announced that this would be her final album. Her continuing relevance was affirmed in 2011 when the Swedish DJ Avicii achieved substantial chart success with the song “Levels”, which samples her 1962 song “Something’s Got a Hold on Me”. The same sample was used by the rapper Flo Rida in his 2011 hit single “Good Feeling”. Both artists issued statements of condolence upon James’s death.\n\nStyle and influence\n\nJames possessed the vocal range of a contralto. Her musical style changed during the course of her career. At the beginning her recording career, in the mid-1950s, James was marketed as an R&B and doo-wop singer. After signing with Chess Records in 1960, James broke through as a traditional pop-styled singer, covering jazz and pop music standards on her debut album, At Last! James’s voice deepened and coarsened, moving her musical style in her later years into the genres of soul and jazz.\n\nJames was once considered one of the most overlooked blues and R&B musicians in the music history of the United States. It was not until the early 1990s, when she began receiving major industry awards from the Grammys and the Blues Foundation, that she began to receive wide recognition. In recent years, she was seen as bridging the gap between rhythm and blues and rock and roll. James has influenced a wide variety of musicians, including Diana Ross, Christina Aguilera, Janis Joplin, Bonnie Raitt, Shemekia Copeland, and Hayley Williams of Paramore as well as British artists The Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, Elkie Brooks, Amy Winehouse, Paloma Faith, Joss Stone Rita Ora, and Adele, and the Belgian singer Dani Klein.\n\nHer song “Something’s Got a Hold on Me” has been recognized in many ways. Brussels music act Vaya Con Dios covered the song on their 1990 album Night Owls. Another version, performed by Christina Aguilera, was in the 2010 film Burlesque. Pretty Lights sampled the song in “Finally Moving”, followed by Avicii’s dance hit “Levels”, and again in Flo Rida’s single “Good Feeling”.\n\nPersonal life\n\nJames encountered a string of legal problems during the early 1970s due to her heroin addiction. She was continuously in and out of rehabilitation centers, including the Tarzana Treatment Centers, in Los Angeles, California. Her husband Artis Mills, whom she married in 1969, accepted responsibility when they were both arrested for heroin possession and served a 10-year prison sentence. He was released from prison in 1981 and was still married to James at her death.\n\nIn 1974, James was sentenced to drug treatment instead of serving time in prison. She was in the Tarzana Psychiatric Hospital for 17 months, at the age of 36, and went through a great struggle at the start of treatment. In her autobiography, she said that the time she spent in the hospital changed her life. After leaving treatment, however, her substance abuse continued after she developed a relationship with a man who was also using drugs. In 1988, at the age of 50, she entered the Betty Ford Center, in Palm Springs, California, for treatment. In 2010, she received treatment for a dependency on painkillers.\n\nJames had two sons, Donto and Sametto. Both started performing with their mother — Donto played drums at Montreux in 1993, and Sametto played bass guitar circa 2003.\n\nDeath\n\nJames was hospitalized in January 2010 to treat an infection caused by MRSA, a bacterium that is resistant to most antibiotic treatments. During her hospitalization, her son Donto revealed that she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2008.\n\nShe was diagnosed with leukemia in early 2011. The illness became terminal and she died on January 20, 2012, just five days before her 74th birthday, at Riverside Community Hospital in Riverside, California. Her death came three days after that of Johnny Otis, the man who had discovered her in the 1950s. Additionally, just 36 days after her death, her sideman Red Holloway also died.\n\nHer funeral, presided over by Reverend Al Sharpton, took place in Gardena, California eight days after her death. Singers Stevie Wonder and Christina Aguilera each gave a musical tribute. She was entombed at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Los Angeles County, California.\n\nAwards\n\nFrom 1989, James received over 30 awards and recognitions from eight different organizations, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum and the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences which organizes the Grammys.\n\nIn 1989, the newly formed Rhythm and Blues Foundation included James in their first Pioneer Awards for artists whose “lifelong contributions have been instrumental in the development of Rhythm & Blues music”. The following year, 1990, she received an NAACP Image Award, which is given for “outstanding achievements and performances of people of color in the arts”; an award she cherished as it “was coming from my own people”.\n\n1993, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\n2001, Rockabilly Hall of Fame\n\nApril 18, 2003, Hollywood Chamber of Commerce Hollywood Walk of Fame, star at 7080 Hollywood Blvd, and Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) Lifetime Achievement Award\n\n2006, Billboard R&B Founders Award\n\nGrammys\n\nThe Grammy Awards are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. James has received six Grammy Awards. Her first was in 1995, when she was awarded Best Jazz Vocal Performance for the album Mystery Lady, which consisted of covers of Billie Holiday songs. Two other albums have also won awards, Let’s Roll (Best Contemporary Blues Album) in 2003, and Blues to the Bone (Best Traditional Blues Album) in 2004. Two of her early songs have been given Grammy Hall of Fame Awards for “qualitative or historical significance”: “At Last”, in 1999, and “The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)” in 2008. In 2003, she was given the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nBlues Foundation\n\nThe members of the Blues Foundation, a non-profit organization set up in Memphis, Tennessee, to foster the blues and its heritage, have nominated James for a Blues Music Award nearly every year since its founding in 1980; and she received some form of Blues Female Artist of the Year award 14 times since 1989, continuously from 1999 to 2007. In addition, the albums Life, Love, & The Blues (1999), Burnin’ Down The House (2003), and Let’s Roll (2004) were awarded Soul/Blues Album of the Year, and in 2001 she was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.\n\nWikipedia"
