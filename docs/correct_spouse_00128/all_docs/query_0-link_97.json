        "text": "Clueless star Stacey Dash secretly got married in April, just days after she withdrew from her campaign to run for Congress in California.\n\nSources said the 51-year-old actress wed lawyer Jeffrey Marty just 10 days after meeting him, according to Page Six. However, her manager Kerry Jones could not confirm when the couple met or why their marriage was so hush-hush.\n\n“They wanted it on the D.L. [down low],” was all Jones said of their April 6 wedding.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarty, who is Dash's fourth husband, is the creator of fake Rep. Steven Smith of Georgia's 15th District — which doesn't exist.\n\nThe fictional Smith was the first member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump as well as an active advocate for the president on Twitter. His \"Tea Party Republican\" Twitter account fooled journalist, celebrities, and politicians alike over the years, especially during Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, he's married to a woman who shares his political views, which are different from Smith's. Dash and Marty are dedicated to exposing government corruption and their Republican views are often considered controversial.\n\nDash announced she was withdrawing from the congressional race for California's 44th District just one month after filing paperwork to run as a Republican.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"I started this run with the intention to address the pressing issues in the district where I live,\" she told Cosmopolitan in a statement. \"I hoped, and remain hopeful, that I can assist people living here on the national level.\"\n\nIn the statement, Dash explained that she is frustrated with the system but is taking herself out of the running for her family's sake.\n\n\"My goal was, and remains, to improve the lives of people who have been forgotten for decades by the Democratic Party,\" she wrote. \"At this point, I believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe newlyweds' family has become fairly large as a result of their vows. Dash, who has previously been married to Brian Lovell, James Maby, and Emmanuel Xuereb, has two children: 26-year-old Austin Williams, from her relationship with Christopher Williams, and 15-year-old Lola Lovell from her marriage to Brian Lovell.\n\nMarty shares three kids with his ex-wife.\n\nThe pair is seemingly starting off with a long-distance marriage. Dash lives in Ls Angeles, California and her new husband Marty resides in Tampa, Florida.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate: Dash was arrested for domestic violence after attacking her husband in Florida. She responded to the arrest, downplaying it on Twitter:\n\nAdvertisement"
