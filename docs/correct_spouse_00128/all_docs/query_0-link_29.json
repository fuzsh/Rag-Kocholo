        "text": "Actress Stacey Dash is a single mom again!\n\nThe nightmare is reportedly over for Stacey. A judge has granted her divorce from actor Emmanuel Xuereb, the man she claims beat her up on multiple occasions.\n\nDash, arguably one of Hollywood’s hottest “over 40-year-old’s”, filed for divorce in January 2010 – the same day she filed for a restraining order against her husband.\n\nAccording to court records, Stacy Dash claimed Xuereb hit her in the face, head and body during their more than 2 years of marriage. She claims she was afraid to report the abuse.\n\nDash, most recently one of the stars of VH1’s “Single Ladies”, has gotten her wish. An L.A. County Superior Court judge has signed-off on the divorce – making her an eligible woman – again!\n\nStacey and Emmanuel have no children, but 45-year-old Dash has two children from previous relationships.\n\nThis was Stacey Dash’s third marriage.\n\nNo word on whether she has to pay alimony to her former husband."
