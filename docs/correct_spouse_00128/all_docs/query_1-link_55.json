        "text": "UPDATE: Stacey Dash’s rep has issued a statement telling TMZ that Stacey acted in defense after Jeffrey Marty attempted to choke her. She was allegedly the one who called police, but was taken into custody because Jeffrey had marks on him while she didn’t.\n\n—\n\nRemember how we told you last fall that Stacey Dash married a fellow Trump supporter on the low? Well, she was just arrested for putting her hands on him.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the 52-year-old Clueless actress was taken in by police on Sunday. They were called to her home in Pasco County in Florida on the evening of the 29th to respond to a squabble that turned physical, with Stacey allegedly pushing and slapping husband Jeffrey Marty. When authorities saw that he had scratches on his arm, she was taken into custody. The actress is reportedly being held on a $500 bail. TMZ also says that she may be held for a full 24 hours, which local authorities say is often done to help both parties calm down. You can see Stacey’s mug shot on TMZ’s page.\n\nStacey wed Jeffrey in April 2018, days after she announced last year that she was going to back out of plans to run for congress in California’s 44th district. They reportedly said “I do” after only knowing each other 10 days, according to the New York Post.\n\nAs we previously told you, Jeffrey, a lawyer, was previously known for creating a persona by the name of Rep. Steven Smith of Georgia on Twitter to endorse all things Donald Trump. According to PEOPLE, he has three children with his ex-wife. As for Dash, this is her fourth marriage. She previously wed producer Brian Lovell (whom she shares a daughter with), British executive James Maby, and actor Emmanuel Xuereb. She also has a son with singer Christopher Williams.\n\nFollowing the news coming out that she was a Mrs. again, Stacey changed her Instagram profile info to “Christian Wife Mother and Warrior.”\n\nShe shared a short visual from their wedding day on social media in April after her first wedding anniversary and said that “My children, my husband are my greatest Blessings.”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BwfJNh5AMWx/\n\nFollowing her arrest, Stacey nor her rep has had any comment to offer. As for Jeffrey though, he didn’t skip a beat from his usual routine, hopping back on Twitter hours after everything happened to talk about politics:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Jeffrey_Marty/status/1178499007510798336\n\nGuess that means he’s doing okay…?"
