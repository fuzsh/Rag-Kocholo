        "text": "The nightmare is over for Stacey Dash ... a judge has finally granted her divorce from actor Emmanuel Xuereb -- the man she claims beat her up on multiple occasions.\n\nDash -- arguably hotter than another famous 45-year-old (see poll) -- filed for divorce in January 2010 ... the same day she filed for a restraining order against the guy.\n\nTMZ broke the story ... Dash claimed Xuereb hit her in the face, head and body during their two-plus years of marriage ... but she was afraid to report it to police."
