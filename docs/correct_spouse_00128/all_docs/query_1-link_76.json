        "text": "Dear Santa,\n\nThis is the 20th year in a row I’ve written you. In the past, I’ve asked you for numerous things, such as power rangers action figures, a gameboy color, a power wheel, new shoes, a computer, a Nintendo, etc., all things I never had the privilege of receiving. And since I’d never received them, I figured it was because I somehow made your naughty list, despite the fact that I’ve also never received coal, as the legend goes. But whatever, you live and you learn. So, just last year, I decided to tone it down a notch and asked for a book. I figured it wasn’t an insanely materialistic thing and, in addition to what I thought to be a fair and noble request, I made sure to be as nice as possible. Seriously, you can ask around – I spread nothing but knowledge and joy. I had to have made the Nice list that year. However, despite following protocol, I still woke up to a present-less Christmas tree.\n\nAfter 20 years of receiving nothing, I just have to ask: who the fuck do you think you are, old man? Nah dawg, for real – like, who are you to pass judgment on the decisions I’ve had to make, anyway? How you gonna simplify my life and make a call on whether I’ve been naughty or nice? Then, to add insult to injury, you have the nerve to not float a gift or, at the very least, a piece of coal my way. What gives, you big passive aggressive motherfucker?\n\nAw, aw…ok, I get it. No love for the hood. We just don’t exist, huh? Aight, coo…tell you what – since you don’t wanna come to the hood, we’ll bring the hood to you.\n\nSide note: I’m ’bout to expose you, nigga. We all know ya name Kris Kringle, which loosely translates to “bitch ass nigga” in Greek. But what most people don’t know is that you really from the South Pole! You used to wear blue and spell ya names with Cs, but niggas ran ya pockets and ran you outta ya old hood, so now you Kris Kringle from the north and bang red, huh? Pussass boy!\n\nAnyway, me and some’a my homies gon’ come up to the North Pole and turn’at bitch upside down. Who gon’ stop us? What kinda security y’all got up there? Ya whole neighborhood made up of candy canes, icing, and gingerbread! Whose names you gonna throw out? Jack Frost? I will sling $7.00 worth of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos at his midsection. Rudolph? Him and the rest of the reindeer crew can catch the meanest of rock bottoms and Stone Cold stunners. Oh, now you send the elves out to try and overwhelm us? We’ll assign a crippler crossface to every single one of ’em. Let me guess, you saved the best for last, right? The Yeti? Me and my niggas will all come together in a collective effort to 3D that gargantuan asshole through the fucking conveyor belt in ya bullshit ass factory. This ain’t a fucking game, bro.\n\nIn conclusion, stop playin’ with me K.K. It’s like this, big dawg – either start showin’ some respect, or I’ll take the shit. Fuck all the naughty/nice lists and other semantics involved, either me and the hood get to enjoy a proper Christmas, or nobody does. Let’s turn this thing around. I trust you’ll make the right decision.\n\nHere’s to a Happy Holiday Season and a Happy New Year!\n\nSincerely,\n\nQ\n\nDear ABC Family (Freeform),\n\nPlease excuse any mistyping, as I’ve been drinking whiskey.\n\nFor the past few years, I’ve been getting sick of y’all shit. Stop playing the fuck around. My mamma ain’t put a Christmas tree up last year, and I blame y’all.\n\nNot to be nostalgic, but when I was on Christmas break as a kid, you people were who I went to so I could get into the Christmas mood, but now y’all fucked it all up. Now you’re like, “Well Mr. Idiot, we do our best to make our viewers happy.” Cut the shit, and play the movies I deserve. I don’t want your goddam original movies fam, keep that shit to yourselves. What the hell is a, “Christmas in Handcuffs”? Keep that shit on Lifetime, that don’t belong here.\n\nLast year, I was broke with no woman in my life, and only a 40 ounce of 211 Steel Reserve in my hand. All I wanted was to see Richie Rich believe in the value of friendship.\n\nThis year has been pretty good for me, especially now that my new lady lets me borrow her car without having to fill it up afterwards. All I want now, is some good Christmas movies to watch while I sit at home and she fills the car up. Don’t get me wrong every once in a while y’all give the streets some hidden gems. Fred Claus? Dope. The Santa Claus 3? That’s my new shit. Holiday Heart? Wait, was that y’all? I don’t remember, but I know Ving Rhames wore a wig in it. Lol remember when he licked Tyrese’s head? Never mind, anyways…\n\nAfter looking at your 2016 lineup, I am pleased. You brought “Richie Rich’s Christmas Wish” back, which is good because I swear to God, I was seriously about to come for y’all souls. I’ll be watching.\n\nHappy Holidays and Fuck You,\n\n-Abstract Idiot\n\nWhat’s happenin’, good people? Principal aka Young Queso is here and I wanna talk to y’all about a topic very near and dear to my heart.\n\nNo, not Lindsey Lohan. Today I want to talk to y’all about R&B, more specifically the earlier years of R&B.\n\nNow I was born in the 90s and you couldn’t turn on the radio without hearing a group of grown ass men crooning to the woman of their dreams. Apologizing for cheating, explaining why they can make their dreams come true, just all kinds of songs putting that pus, *ahem*, queen on a pedestal.\n\nThese dudes were SANGIN’! But the best songs were always when the dude was begging to be noticed or for another chance. You could feel the pain come through your the wires of ya headphones. I’m talking about songs that make you snatch off ya durag like Trey Songz in that one video.\n\nSo I asked myself……why doesn’t anyone make songs like this anymore? Has that era passed in favor of singing about slapping stomachs???\n\nWell I say NO, SIR! WE WILL NOT JUST GO QUITELY INTO THE NIGHT LIKE YA HOMEGIRL HEADED HOME AFTER ENDURING AFORMENTIONED ACTION!\n\nSo I got to thinking…..”what were the best Begging songs of my lifetime?”, and I narrowed down to 5. So let’s count em down and I’ll tell you why they deserve mention.\n\n5. Sweet Lady – Tyrese\n\nTyrese left it all on this track. Fam begins by saying “I doesn’t usually do this because I’m bald these hoes be flockin'”, but he’s never seen a woman like that in his life. My nigga stepped to her like he was going door to door tryna make sinners covert over to Jehovah. He don’t even care if she got a man, he still slid her them digits and said “Listen…listen….look at my sheen of my scalp, you call me when you need me and you can receive me” The Charcoal Charizard of R&B then asked her within in the same breath “Would you be my lady and give it up?” Name another to ever lay it out as smooth as my man Tyrese……I’ll wait.\n\n4. Charlene – Anthony Hamilton\n\nNever in the history of Marlboro Lights and hair grease has there been a sadder soul than Anthony Hamilton. This man just wanted to be a singer and his girl wasn’t having it. Ant woke up one fine Sunday morning to a letter from his queen Charlene. This letter explained why she couldn’t take being “second” in his life to his dream of being an music artist. She knew he was tryna make it big to take care of her and buy her all the Bojangles Chicken she could eat. The tale goes that Anthony Hamilton is still standing at the door waiting for his beard to connect and for Charlene to walk back into his life. He didn’t deserve to experience this kind of pain……\n\nIt’s still fuck you, Charlene!\n\n3. End of the Road – Boyz II Men\n\nThe very first line in this song is “Girl you know we belong together”. No games, no more playing around. I’m gon’ make you my woman. These dudes were all out of sorts saying that death was better than the pain he was feeling in his soul. He knew……fam KNEW that it was the end but wouldn’t let it go like when ya girl brings up you favoriting deeeeepThroat89’s photo on Twitter, he just couldn’t let it be the end. There’s a point in the song where they all quit singing and one of them is just saying “I know I cheated and I saw you cheating but I don’t care. Life ain’t the same without you, KORINNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”.\n\n2. Can We Talk – Tevin Campbell\n\nTevin Campbell aka Little T aka Powerline put out one of the best begging tunes of the 90s and quietly disappeared into obscurity. You can find this song on anybody’s Top R&B list, and it deserves to be. Tevin was out at Safeway just tryna get some eggs for an omelette the next morning when he saw the next girl he’d add to his block list. Shawty was bad so he was at a lost on how to approach her, but he noticed her noticing him and wanted to but her on notice that he noticed her too. But sadly…..nothing popped off. Tevin was shook, never had he seen such a fine ass woman in a Safeway dairy section. Nigga started to write her letters, fam……LETTERS explaining how he felt, but he knew it wouldn’t be enough. Dawg Tevin is lost at this point, this song might have driven him to insanity. All we wanted was a minute of her time, he just wanted to know her name, he even shouts it to the heavens “YOU BETTER TELL ME YOUR NAME, BABY”. No way you screaming in the booth like that for any woman less than a goddess. Prayers up for Tevin.\n\n1. Maybe I Deserve – Tank\n\n*ahem* DO YOU MIND IF I TELL THE TRUTH???!!! This is hands. down. the most begging-est ass song ever crooned by an R&B cat. Tank puts out some sad ass songs (look up “Please Don’t Go”) but my mans went to the Great Beyond to achieve this level of hurt. This song is just about a scumbag of a man knowing his girl is out there doing all the things he did to her. Lying, cheating, and coming home and smiling in his face like nothing is happening. He’s checking phones to see who the hell is “Dexter” and why is he’s calling his baby boo at 3:47 in the morning…..but he knows why. He’s making himself sick thinking about if Dexter is kissing and touching on his woman. His woman finally comes home after a long night of revenge humping and at this point of the song Tank got that henny in his system and isn’t gonna take it anymore. Fam grabs Shantelle by the back of her neck to get some answers. Dude even chases her down the street but he just breaks down because he knows he deserves this pain.\n\nThere you have it folks. There isn’t a single R&B cat in the game that has made a song on the same level of these visionaries. I hope in the years to come we can take it back to this level of song writing and emotional turmoil.\n\nDon’t agree with me? You can walk out the same door as Charlene’s dirty ass.\n\nSincurely yours,\n\nPrincipal\n\nWhat’s going on everybody, I’m just going to skip all the formal stuff and get right to this one. This is a quick little piece to discuss the legend that is Soulja Boy. Before you stop reading right there, hear me out.\n\nThis was brought up while the rest of the Idiots and I where talking about some one who tweeted “Soulja Boy ain’t have no hits other than Crank That.” After reading this tweet I was instantly offended because Soulja Boy is a pioneer. There’s Christopher Columbus, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Soulja Boy, and then Steve Jobs when it comes to changing the way we live our life. No way I was gonna let any disrespect fly.\n\nWhy am I calling S Beezy a pioneer? Why am I saying the Westward Expansion had Lewis and Clark and we had Soulja Boy and Arab? It’s pretty simple. The whole idea of a YouTube Celebrity started with Soulja Boy. Recording Booty Meat in his bathroom and posting it to get 1 million views started a whole new wave of ways to become famous. Without Soulja Boy being the first to get the exposure he did on YouTube, there wouldn’t be a Justin Beiber or anybody else that got famous on YouTube. Not enough evidence? Ok, let me keep going.\n\nWhen Soulja Boy recorded and made Booty Meat an MP3 music file, he started what is known today as twerking videos. You search Booty Meat on YouTube and you will find nothing but twerk video from 2007. The birth of twerking videos has allowed some young ladies career opportunities that where nonexistent before the Soulja Era. The young ladies I’m talking about specifically are known as The Twerk Team. These women made a living out of shaking their ass and recording it. Oh you don’t think that counts, huh? Fine.\n\nDeAndre Cortez Way is a pioneer for what he did to the idea of dancing with your boys, too. Before what I am going to call the Crank That Era, no guy thought it was cool to dance let alone dance with your boys. But who made it a thing? Soulja Boy and Arab did. They had the Internet going crazy with uploading videos of them making dance routines with their friends. It also sparked the creativity among youth.\n\nNow. Let’s talk about fashion. Don’t read this and act like Soulja didn’t influence your waredrobe. From tall tees to Bapes to the glasses with whiteout on the lenses. Yes, I mean the glasses with whiteout paint on them, these:\n\nWhen it’s all said and done, no disrespect shall be spoken against Soulja Boy. None. Zero. Zilch. Nada. And as far as him not having any hits after Crank That, TUH! Let’s count em out: Shoot Out, Donk, Booty Got Swag, Marco Polo, Bird Walk, and Pretty Boy Swag. That’s just off the top of the dome.\n\nBut anyways I’m writing this at work and have a meeting in 7 mins so I’m going to go ahead and wrap this up. Just had to get that off my chest. If I missed and Soulja Boy classics comment and let me know.\n\nLonzo out.\n\n“The only difference between Captain America and a crackhead is integrity.” – Q\n\nHow’s it goin’, beautiful people? Oh wow…hey, hey – chill you fucking narcissist, take it easy. This isn’t about you.\n\nThis is the boy Q, aka Papa Bear, aka Daddy Ursa, aka young *checks account balance online* “I’ll just have a water” here, and yes, you read the title correctly. Sleep, meals, a moral compass, exercise – these are just a few of the constructs that us mere mortals need to sustain a somewhat healthy way of living, things that the crackhead conglomerate only need barely any of, if any at all, to perform miscellaneous tasks at a godlike level. Growing up, and even now (I think), being accused of or jokingly being called a crackhead was a heavy accusation that could result in an unfriendly round of knuckle pitching. However, is being referred to as a modern day Renaissance wo/man really all that offensive?\n\nLet’s look at some of the facts. Crackheads are:\n\nEccentric/misunderstood\n\nResourceful\n\nWily\n\nNot good businessmen\n\nAddicts\n\nPiece of shit individuals\n\nSports science athletes\n\nDo you see that? I just described prime Ricky Williams on accident. Crazy, right? Now, we all know the negatives associated with this illustrious group, so I’ll just focus on the things that are good or amazing to me.\n\nLook, in the ’90s and early 2000s, people regarded the famous phrase “You can’t catch no crackhead” as hood folklore. Due to advancements in modern technology and the expansion of social media, we are now able to see that this shit ain’t a joke. I, with my own four eyes, witnessed a crackhead clear a 1998 Buick Lasabre with a 2-step take off and disappear into the night, allowing him to successfully evade the police. No, not the hood or trunk of the car, I’m talking about the whip’s highest point. Only other person I witnessed do that was this dude named Larry that still owes me $5, and he was a world class track star. Hell, he may have been tootin’ that white too, now that I’m sitting here thinking about it.\n\nMy brother and fellow idiot Lonzo once told me he saw one carrying a refrigerator down the street on his back. No, not the mini fridge you were sneaking Keystone Light into during your college dorm days – I’m talking about one of those Whirlpool joints. I know, I know, you’re a little skeptical, right? As was I…but earlier this week, I witnessed the feat being performed by who I’m assuming to be a different crackhead via Twitter. Not only did this deity serve as the vessel for a refrigerator jockey, but to flex his skills even more, he hopped on a bike and started pedaling on a brick road like it was nothing. Oh, you think I’m bullshittin’? Look at this shit. (My quote at the beginning came long before the tweet in this link, so shaddup). Combine this feat of super strength and dexterity with their 60 inch vertical and crack-induced 4.1-4.2 speed? You have round 1, pick 1 of the next major professional sports draft.\n\nIt is well-known that crackheads will do anything for $20 aka their next ticket to a plugin session into the matrix. They will wash your entire vehicle with an oil-spotted shammy, a newspaper from 1996, and windex contained in one of those label-less spray bottles you can cop at Walmart, all within the span of like five minutes. The wash’ll be decent, too. Who else is doin’ that? BP and Shell ain’t doin’ that. Establish a verbal contract worth $20 per week in the fall with a crackhead, and they’ll run around the yard with a burlap sack and catch every leaf that falls from that big ass tree before they can even get near the ground. It’s been snowing all week – you see snowflakes just accumulating into massive clumps on top of your Nissan Altima, you turn away from the window and make some hot cocoa, trying to distract yourself from the looming and daunting task of shoveling your sidewalk and/or driveway, you hear bells jingling, you look out the front door to see what that’s about, only to see that your sidewalk and driveway have already been shoveled! Nah, it wasn’t a gift from Santa for being a good person, he didn’t forgive you for those bootleg dvds you copped at the salon/barbershop. Know who was lookin’ out? Moe the neighborhood crackhead, whom you spotted with a few dollars here and there in the past.\n\nLook man, all I’m saying is, if I ever get famous or need protection, I’ma just hire a league of crackheads, pay ’em $20 a day, and give them one simple instruction: “Nobody gets near me”, and enjoy my investment. Also, I want you to realize that crackheads can perform all of these amazing feats running off of nothing but a Snickers bar they had three days ago. Put that into perspective. That’s some lowkey scary shit.\n\nYeah, we all know about all the terrible things crackheads are capable of doing. I’m in no way apologizing for their shit bag behavior, but I do have a theory: what if crack rips away your morality so that you can access every other part of your brain? If you look past all the stolen car radios, stolen bicycles off of porches, and scams, they’re truly remarkable beings. Besides…what amazing individuals do we know that aren’t pieces of shit? Dude that made the Ignition Remix, the undisputed best NBA player ever, the greatest boxer ever (record wise), the best quarterback of the modern era, Apollo – all awful individuals with amazing talents.\n\nIn conclusion, this was just a small piece on how crackheads may not be the frail and hopeless individuals you may have made them out to be. I could probably draft up an entire thesis paper on these extraordinary beings. So, the next time your fix your mouth to call someone a crackhead, do so with a tone of respect. Just to be clear though, don’t call me that shit in front of my momma or grandma. Ain’t nobody playin’. I’ll knock you out.\n\nWith love,\n\nQ\n\nWhat’s up my people! How y’all feeling? Y’all good? I hope so, I’m pretty good too. No real complaints, I’m sure I could find something but I’ll just leave it at I’m Gucci. Speaking of, free Guwop! Aight, aight, got off track. But I’m writing this short little piece on something I’ve noticed here recently in the music world. That is I think that RnB is making a comeback.\n\nI’m talking about the real RnB. The crying to your girl because she left you, the I’m going to yell to the the world that I love you, and the let’s make black passion all night type of RnB. Now some of you may be saying, “well people like Chris Brown been around forever keeping RnB alive.” Although Chris got hits he still calls ladies the b-word in his songs and that seemed to be the trend with the “new RnB”. Like everyone singing about not loving these hoes, one night stands, and hitting multiple women at once. Things are recently looking like they are moving away from that.\n\nArtist like Bryson Tiller, Tory Lanez, and BJ The Chicago Kid are making songs showing that they really care about women without calling them bitches and hoes while singing in A-minor. Reminds me of the Sisqo x Incomplete, the Keith Sweat x Nobody, and the Blackstreet x Don’t Leave Me time period. And this got me happy as hell.\n\nIf you know me you know I listen to trap music 90% of the time but every now and then I like to turn down and chill out. Also sometimes you don’t want to play the new Young Scooter tape while you’re in the car with your lady. What really sparked this thought was I was told I should listen to the new Twenty88 album from Big Sean and Jhene Aiko. I was hesitant at first but after giving it a spin it was smooth as hell. Then I started to think, most of these songs are love songs and I kind of liked them. Had no clue what was happening to me.\n\nBut that’s just a little bit of what I’ve been peeping lately and how I feel about it. Hopefully this continues because I need some songs to sing obnoxiously in the car while dedicating it to my lady and the shower.\n\nNow back to this Jezzy!\n\nHey everyone, it’s been too long and I’ve gone through a lot since my last post. I have a new job, my momma started trippin, Tom Brady is still alive, and the second season of Daredevil is on Netflix. I’ve been able to handle all this, but there is one thing that’s been slowly tearing me apart. A broken heart.\n\nLet me set the mood…\n\nMy beautiful, caramel, aureate queen Stacey Dash, please stop. Get off Fox News and come back to BET original movies. Stop hanging around those pale people, you’re starting to absorb their aging abilities. You don’t need them for me to pay attention to you. I know you’re getting the relevancy you’ve always wanted after all those direct to VHS movies you were in from 2011-2014, but this version of yourself is tearing me apart.\n\nI know, I was away at school for a long time, then after graduation I was too focused on my job, but I’m here for you now. I did all this for you. I can take care of you now, my momma said you can live with us and we can both borrow her car if need be.\n\nI’ve changed too. You know all those nights I came home and yelled at you on the TV while that shit show, “Single Ladies” was on? I won’t do it anymore.\n\nRemember when I first saw you? It was 1996, you had box braids, and I thought, “Wow, I may only be six years old, but that is a fine ass woman.” Then I saw, “Mo Money” on Comedy Central and this graced my TV screen…\n\nGo back to this, please. Seeing what you’ve become has filled my eyes with the tears of a broken man. Stacey, please come back.\n\nThose husbands you went through, Emmanuel Xuereb, James Maby, and Brian Lovell all led you down a path you don’t belong on, you sweet-seasoned shower of pure human bliss. Give this Kohl’s urban section model a chance and let me be your fourth ex-husband.\n\nI’m going to have to end this soon, since I’m barely holding it together right now as my fingertips touch the tears on my keyboard. I’m lost without your presence. My personal phone and work phone are both at 19% and it’s only 10 a.m., I’m not going to be okay without you.\n\nI want to tell you I don’t need you anymore and that I can’t stand to see you make a fool of yourself, our people, and my love, but I can’t let you go.\n\nDon’t do this anymore, come back I need you. BET movies need you.\n\nThanks for reading my pain everyone.\n\nWuz hannin’ good people? How’s your day going? Aw yeah? For real? Nuh uh! That’s crazy! Not to cut you short, but I have a quick lil’ blog to post.\n\nSo the other day, I got kinda bored and looked up each of our names (me & the 3 other idiots) in Urban Dictionary. Now, as you may know, Urban Dictionary is the source of many ridiculously and legendarily hilarious definitions and sample sentences. For those that aren’t familiar, here’s an example:\n\nElectric Hammer – When you touch someone or something with your erect penis and it releases static electricity.\n\nI accidentally gave my spouse the electric hammer and now I can only pleasure them after rubbing my stocking feet against a carpeted floor.\n\nLmfao wtf? That is written verbatim. Don’t believe me?\n\nApparently, there’s a sale on digital cameras, so you may wanna jump on that.\n\nAnyway, like I was saying, I decided to look up all of our names because I figured it would be pretty funny. Instead, I was slapped very hard in the face by a harsh realization. Know what? I’ll just let you read them. The following are our names, their top 2 definitions, and their accompanying sample sentence(s). So, let’s get into it.\n\nDisclaimer: I’m not using last names, and I ain’t sayin’ who is who. Idk who has warrants and/or owes some bad people some money.\n\nChris\n\n1. A kid who is always up to party and have a good time\n\nDude, I don’t wanna go to that party unless Chris comes.\n\nThis definition? Rated G for ‘Get the fuck OUTTA here.\n\nWasn’t gonna post this next one, but I’m a man of my word. This next definition is Urban Dictionary’s words, not mine.\n\n2. is a slang for huge cock\n\nlike incredibly huge.\n\noh man I wish I had a chris in me.\n\nThe second definition has me dying, I’ll admit. So damn barbaric. Generally speaking, both definitions mention nothing but praise. Let’s move on to the next one.\n\nDerrick\n\nAgain..Urban Dictionary’s words, NOT MINE.\n\n1. A cool, SEXY dark caramel black guy with a giant penis and who loves to be loved. A calm, but Crazy guy if you make him. The only thing that isnt cool about him is he likes to mess with alot of girls, but he’s a MACK DADDY. All the girls loves him and his penis.\n\nThat one guy DERRICK is fucking sexy and he has a HUUUGGGEEE penis\n\nAt this point, I realize Urban Dictionary’s female population is alive, well, and very active. Either that, or the dudes with these names are class A narcissists.\n\n2. A funny yet understanding guy. Always has a way of keeping you entertained when you’re down. He’s the kind of guy you can trust to keep secrets and know he’ll always be there for you. Derrick cares about his friends even new friends (never wants to see a frown in his group of friends). Charming and handsome. Tall and slim. He keeps fit and healthy. Never the kind of guy who judges girls. He’d probably go for girls with brown/black hair and a opposite personality than him (which is okay cause he’s open for any type of person).\n\nA. Derrick you’re the perfect example of what a sad stressed girl has been looking for.\n\nB. When Derrick sees a sad girl he’ll do what ever he can to help her out.\n\nC. King of sex, man..\n\nMaaaaan…get this Helga Pataki authored shit outta here lmao. But whatever – again, positive and uplifting for those that possess the name.\n\nWarren\n\nI actually couldn’t wait to search this name, since I know Warren is an all-around, 99 overall Madden/2K rating piece of shit individual.\n\n1. a person who survives through the toughest of situations and has the best friends ever. they can get some major booty whenever they want it and people line up around the block just to say hello.\n\nthat guy over theres a real Warren I wish I knew him\n\nOh, fuck off.\n\n2. everyone loves warren. he is sexy, cute, funny, sweet and everything a girl could wish for. warren has an incredibly dirty mind but is still a very nice guy. warren is also brown and has cool hair.\n\nGirl 1: I love him so much!\n\nGirl 2: I know, he is such a warren!\n\nWere Girl 1 & Girl 2 paid to pencil this fucking sponsored by Serta fluff piece? Eat a tempura fried phallice.\n\nQuinten\n\nAight..so at this point, I’m like “Well shit, let me jump on this uplifting and praise train! I wanna read about how nice I am!” Since all Chris, Derrick, and Warren named fellers get such positive reviews, let’s see what kinda love the Quintens in the world are getting?\n\n1. A crazy badass mother fucker, who you don’t wanna fuck with unless your looking for a bullet in your dome. He is also very jacked and all the ladies want to get in his pants.\n\nI messed with Quinten and now I have a hole in my head.\n\nUm…excuse me..?\n\n2. a crazy ass mother fucker who will tear your kidney’s apart and will go to your house and literally fuck your mom…. then he will get drunk and fuck like 300 girls on a good night at robbies house…. BEAT GUTS…\n\nDamn i heard Quinten fucked 283 chicks one night at robbies crazy party then like he got in some fight and ripped some dudes kidney idk dude hes fucking phsyco…\n\nThe approximation in the sample sentence has liquid running from my eyes, but what the fuck is happening, here!? I’ll tell you what’s happening – Urban Dictionary has an agenda against all Quintens, that’s what! Please, count up how many Quintens you’ve heard of or met that are “crazy, bad ass motherfuckers”, as the gentleman/young lady that obviously writes for Spike TV so kindly put it. By now, you’re done counting, ’cause IT AIN’T NONE.\n\nUrban Dictionary is very anti-Quinten, and I won’t stand for this defamation of character. I’ve never been so indirectly disrespected in my Goddamn life. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to clean my pistol and enjoy a few cups of Whiskey neat before I head over to this house party.\n\nRegards,\n\nQ\n\n*ahem*\n\nWe are gathered here today to witness one of life’s greatest moments, the joining of two hearts in holy matrimony……\n\n……okay we got that out of the way.\n\nWhat’s up folks, Principal here and today I’m going to discuss a topic that has been debated for years. If you read the title then you know where this is heading and depending on your stance you’ve either rolled your eyes or gotten comfortable in your chair to follow along. Marriage is a giant step forward in any relationship, and I believe that it should only be taken if you’re 100% sure that the person you deem worthy enough to spend the rest of your life with is also on the same page.\n\nNow, with that being said, it takes people different periods of time to get to that point and that’s only natural. People have different views on the progress of a relationship and that should always be respected. Most women tend to get to that point faster then men, which is by no means a bad thing, it only becomes a bad thing when women start to get impatient and take it into their own hands to rush a marriage.\n\nLet me paint a picture for you…..\n\n…..you’ve been with your girlfriend for 4 years now. You two have your own place, have the same interests, she tolerates your 3 idiot friends and you can tolerate her borderline psychotic behavior when a new Beyoncé song comes on. Life is good, BUT she’s starting to get a little antsy about taking that next step. She’s dropping hints left and right and somehow “ALL” of her friends are getting engaged.\n\nStill with me? Good.\n\nNow instead of doing the sane thing and just talking to you about when you think y’all can take that step, she concocts this plan to disregard your role in the situation and propose herself. She gets all of your closest friends together disguised as a “little get together” to make it a special event for the both of you. Everything is good, there’s food, liquor, and “March Madness” by Future is blaring through the JBL speaker……..when suddenly the music gets turned down and everyone has their cameras pulled out. The boyfriend has no idea what’s going on, the only thing on his mind is refilling his plate of buffalo chicken dip. Next thing he knows, he’s getting pulled to the middle of the living room. His girl is there just smiling and looks nervous as hell…….then it hits him what’s going on. Before he can get a word out, she’s already down on one knee and talking about, “You know we’ve been together for…..”. By then he’s stuck.\n\nLet me tell you what’s wrong with this scenario:\n\nYou are forcing this man, who has made no mention of marriage before, into a really uncomfortable position not just in front of his friends, but your friends as well\n\nIf he happens to say “no” you have now set yourself up for potentially the most embarrassing moment of your life and there’s no coming back from that.\n\nIf he happens to say “yes” you have emasculated him in front of all of his friends (stow your “masculinity so fragile” jeers, I don’t wanna hear it)\n\nIn the case that “2” happens in this scenario, that potentially damages your entire relationship and can only lead to arguments, feeling of inadequacy, and massive regret.\n\nAsk yourself, why did you need to go through all this trouble? Was it because you wanted a reason to brag to your friends? You wanted another picture to post on Instagram? Were you trying to one up that chick you thought would never get married? Really take a step back and ask yourself why you want to be married. Because if it’s just for vanity or just to have something to talk about, then you ma’am don’t deserve shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.\n\nThere’s really no good outcome from this situation that you’ve forced onto your boyfriend. Worst case, you do irreparable damage to your relationship and drive a wedge between the love of your life for selfish reasons. Don’t propose, ladies. I say this for your sake and the sake of your man. Leave it to him to make that decision and make it a special occasion that you will never forget.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPrincipal"
