Due to this remark, the network suspended her without pay for two weeks.[22] In 2016, Dash received criticism when she argued that the BET Awards lied to black people about news regarding the boycotting of the Oscars due to lack of ethnic diversity, and called for an end to Black History Month.[23] She made a cameo at the 88th Academy Awards repeating this sentiment.[24] In addition, she criticized Jesse Williams's speech at the BET Awards.[25] On January 21, 2017, Fox News announced that Dash's contract would not be renewed.[26][27]\n\nDash voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[28] In 2012, she switched her party affiliation from Democratic to Republican[29] and endorsed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. In response to critical online comments she received for supporting Romney, Dash stated it was her opinion[30] and that she did not understand the vitriol.[28] Vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan thanked Dash for supporting his ticket.[28]\n\nSince the 2012 election, Dash has publicly expressed her political views. In April 2013, she criticized music artists Jay-Z and Beyoncé's trip to Cuba.[31] In 2016, with regard to the debate over use of gender-specific bathrooms, she said that transgender rights \"infringe upon [her own]\".[32] Dash writes a blog for Patheos.com.[33] Dash supported Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.[34]\n\nOn February 26, 2018, Dash filed to run in California's 44th congressional district in the 2018 Congressional Election as a Republican.[35] On joining the race, Dash said she wanted to \"free people from the shackles of a plantation mentality.\"[36] Dash withdrew from the congressional race on March 30, 2018.[37]\n\nOn March 11, 2021, Dash stated in an interview with Daily Mail, \"Being a supporter of Trump has put me in some kind of box that I don't belong in. But he's not the president. I'm going to give the president that we have right now a chance.\"[38]\n\nDash has two children. She has a son named Austin, born from her relationship with singer Christopher Williams, and a daughter named Lola.[5][39] In 1999, she married producer Brian Lovell and they divorced in the mid-2000s.[5][39] From 2005 to 2006, Dash was married to British executive James Maby, CEO of Sports Logistics.[40] Different sources say the father of Dash's daughter is either Lovell[39] or Maby.[40][3] Dash married actor Emmanuel Xuereb in either 2007[3] or 2009.[39] She filed for divorce in January 2010.

She has at various times revealed that she was molested as a child by a family friend, was addicted to cocaine in her teens and 20s, and has a history of being with physically and emotionally abusive partners.[45] Dash has attributed her openness with such topics to her desire to be honest with her children, feeling that being honest is the best way to protect them, and to let them and others know that she is not a victim but a survivor.[45] She is supportive of the right to keep and bear arms, crediting the use of a gun with saving her life after being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by an ex-boyfriend, because she was able to retrieve her own weapon, a .22 revolver, and shot at him, scaring him away.[46]\n\nDash was arrested on September 29, 2019, at her apartment in Pasco County, Florida, on a domestic battery charge after an argument with her husband, Jeffrey Marty.[47] She pleaded not guilty,[48] and the case was dropped on October 3 at the request of Marty, who said Dash had been arrested over his objection.[49] The couple's divorce was announced the following year.[50]\n\nIn October 2021, Dash opened up about her Vicodin addiction on The Dr. Oz Show, stating that she was five years sober.[51]\n\nDash was raised Catholic, and claimed the religion in 2012 and 2013.[52][53][54]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1982 Farrell for the People Denise Grey TV movie 1987 Enemy Territory Antoinette \"Toni\" Briggs 1988 Moving Casey Pear 1989 Tennessee Waltz Minnie 1992 Mo' Money Amber Evans 1994 Renaissance Man Pvt.
