        "text": "Ever since I said THIS (click HERE to see exactly what she said) on Fox yesterday, Black Entertainment Television has been throwing shade.\n\nThey reminded me — and the rest of America — that I appeared on a show called The Game, which appeared on BET.\n\n“Soooooo @realstaceyldash, can we get our check back… or nah?” the Instagram caption read. “#Remember #YouWereOnTheGame #AndWeDontMeanTheRapper.”\n\nWell, here’s the thing. Thank you for reminding me, since most people have never heard of that show.\n\nWhy? It’s on BET.\n\nQuick. Name the top shows on BET.\n\nDrawing a blank?\n\nI think I’ve made my point.\n\nI’m thankful for all of the acting jobs I’ve had. But I look forward to the day when people don’t self-segregate based on skin color, while loudly complaining about a segregated society.\n\nThat might be hard for the people at BET to understand, especially after I read this quote from a BET exec about the Oscars:\n\n“It would be great if the Oscar nominees represented even closely the percentage of moviegoers who are of different ethnicities, but they don’t,” said Stephen Hill.\n\nWow. Apparently, Mr. Hill doesn’t understand what an Oscar is.\n\nOscars are awarded to the actors and actresses who excel…not the audience.\n\nWhat’s next? Awarding $1 million to the guy sitting in his pajamas on the couch watching Survivor? Giving a blue ribbon to the kid who stayed home from field day? Giving a Nobel Peace Prize to a President who escalated wars in Iraq and Afghanistan?\n\nNo, that would be unreasonable."
