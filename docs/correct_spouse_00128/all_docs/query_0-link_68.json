        "text": "According to legal documents, the pair had “become involved in a verbal argument” and the actress lashed out.\n\nA complaint affidavit stated: “The defendant pushed the victim and slapped him in the face. The victim sustained red scratch marks to his left upper arm from being pushed. The defendant was taken into custody for domestic battery.”\n\nDash — who has also previously been married to Brian Lovell, James Maby and Emmanuel Xuereb — pleaded not guilty to the charge against her and the case was later closed, much to Marty’s relief.\n\nHe tweeted at the time: “Today, the State Attorney made the right call by declining to file charges against my wife, @staceydash.\n\n“She was arrested over my objection at the time, but due to the pending investigation, I waited to comment until now.\n\n“We both look forward to getting this behind us.”"
