        "text": "It’s been a long time coming, but actress Stacey Dash was finally granted the divorce she’s been waiting on.\n\nPHOTOS: “Single Ladies” Top 10 Fashion Moments\n\nStacey’s divorce from actor Emmanuel Xuereb became legal last week. The pair were married for just three years when the “Single Ladies” star filed for divorce in January 2010. Stacey claimed she’d been abused throughout her marriage but was too scared too file reports at the time of the altercations.\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood’s Sexiest Single Moms\n\nHoping for a clean break, Stacey did not request any spousal support at the time she filed. This is the second big split for the star, who recently left her hit show “Single Ladies” after it’s first season saying she “wanted to spend more time with her kids”.\n\nEmmanuel and Stacey had no children together, though she has three children from a previous marriage."
