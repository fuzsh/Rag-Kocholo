        "text": "Tatyana Ali\n\nTatyana Marisol Ali (born January 24, 1979) is an American actress, model and R&B singer, best known for her childhood role as Ashley Banks on the NBC sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Since January 2010, she has starred as Tyana Jones on the TV One original sitcom Love That Girl!, and has had a recurring role as Roxanne on the CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless.\n\nEarly life\n\nTatyana Ali is the eldest daughter (she has two younger sisters) of an Afro-Panamanian mother and an Indo-Trinidadian father.\n\nCareer\n\nBy the age of six, she had begun her acting career, as a regular child performer on Sesame Streetstarting in 1985, even appearing with Herbie Hancock in a musical number. She also appeared twice on Star Search. She made her breakthrough when she was cast as Ashley Banks for the television sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in 1990. She sang on various episodes of the show, including a heavily altered version of Aretha Franklin's \"Respect\" and the original song, \"Make Up Your Mind\" produced by Robert Jerald of N'Spyre Music Productions. Will Smith asked her if she seriously considered pursuing a musical career. Despite her singing ability, she concentrated on her acting career on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air the next few years. In the final season of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1995–96), Ali began preparing herself for her musical debut. The result was the album Kiss The Sky, which was certified gold in early 1999. The album spawned the hit song \"Daydreamin'\", released July 21, 1998, produced by Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe album spawned two further UK hits, \"Boy You Knock Me Out\", featuring Will Smith, which peaked at No. 3 and is her biggest hit to date; and \"Everytime\", which was her third top 20 hit in the UK, peaking at No. 20. She made an appearance in Smith's albumWillennium for the track \"Who Am I\" with MC Lyte. Along with her musical career, Ali kept acting in many films. She had the chance to work with recognized film directors such as Takeshi Kitano (Brother), Rodrigo Garcia (Mother and Child), among others. In 2005, she completed work on the film Glory Road and starred in the music video for Nick Cannon and Anthony Hamilton's \"Can I Live?\" as Cannon's mother. In early 2008, she performed on the song \"Yes We Can\", a will.i.am project supporting Barack Obama's presidential campaign. She also appeared in the subsequent music video which gained coverage on the \"What the Buzz\" segment of ABC's World News Now.\n\nShe also performed the title song, \"Sunny Valentine\" along with Terrence Quaites for the indie film, Rockin' Meera directed by Param Gill in 2005. She is also producing and starring in the BET web show, Buppies. She is currently on recurring status on the CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless as Roxanne.\n\nAli can be seen in the show, Love That Girl! on TV One. She stars as Tyana (which comes from the last five letters of her name). When asked if the character bears any similarities to her, Ali said in a CaribPress interview, \"She's a bit neurotic and I hope I am not quite like that.\"\n\n\"One thing that I do love about her is that she is really multidimensional,\" she went on to say in the same interview. \"I think it's nice to have a female character that is portrayed in (a) really holistic way.\"\n\nAli also starred in Nora's Hair Salon and Nora's Hair Salon 2: A Cut Above. In 2011, Ali received the Living Legacy Award from the Caribbean Heritage Organization in Los Angeles. In 2012, Ali appeared as a guest on The Eric Andre Show. Ali's most recent role, as of January 15, 2013, is starring as Maya, along with Craig Wayans and Damien Dante Wayans, in the BET comedy, Second Generation Wayans.\n\nIn January 2014, Ali released a new EP entitled Hello, with her first single being \"Wait For It\", which she also performed on The Arsenio Hall Show on February 4, 2014.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAli attended Harvard University where she received a bachelor's degree in African-American studies and government in 2002. She traveled the United States as a spokesperson for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and headed voter registration drives at college campuses. . In 2012, she continued showing her support."
