        "text": "LisaRaye McCoy recently appeared on The Wendy Williams Show to talk about her new VH1 show Single Ladies -- and the rumored cat fight between her and her co-star Stacey Dash.\n\nLisaRaye McCoy and Stacey Dash are appearing on the new VH1 scripted show Single Ladies, which has been compared to Sex and the City. However, it is not all cosmos and girl talk on the Atlanta set, as there have been rumors that LisaRaye and Dash have not been getting along.\n\nIn fact, there were reports of hair pulling and Stacey storming off set! LisaRaye went on The Wendy Williams Show to talk about Single Ladies and to clear the air.\n\nWhen Wendy asked LisaRaye about the behind the scenes drama, she said: \"I am too grown to put myself in that situation. No physical anything. We are filming 13 to 15 hours a day. When you are seeing each other every day there will be some creative differences, there's going to be some words exchanged... but that was yesterday... We have moved on.\"\n\nWhen asked specifically about the hair pulling and Stacey running off set, LisaRaye said: \"No fights. None like that.\"\n\nSo there you have it!\n\nComparing Single Ladies to Sex and the City, Wendy said that LisaRaye's character is similar to Samantha and Dash's character is similar to Carrie. \"It's positive. It's current. It's sexy,\" says LisaRaye.\n\nWatch LisaRaye talk about the rumored Stacey Dash fight on The Wendy Williams Show here:\n\nQueen Latifah compares homosexuality to fashion. What is she referring to?\n\nIs Queen Latifah taking baby steps out of the closet? The actress, singer and clothing designer talked about being an accidental lesbian on television.\n\n\"It turns out being gay is fabulous. My Twitter is all atwitter. I have six new Facebook fan pages. And for every sponsor that's fallen out, I've gotten two more. Who knew? Being gay is the new black,\" she said.\n\nOkay, Queen Latifah really didn't say that -- but her character in VH1's Single Ladies did. The rapper -- and executive producer of the show -- plays television reporter Sharon Love on an episode of the show. The shenanigans start when Love accidently reveals that she had a lesbian encounter with Stacey Dash's character Val in college.\n\nLove later reveals that her accidental outing wasn't as bad for her career as she thought. Is Latifah taking cues from her own life? Not really -- she's widely believed to be in a relationship with her trainer, Jeanette Jenkins, though she won't talk about it.\n\n\"My private life is my private life. Whomever I might be with, I don't feel the need to share it. I don't think I ever will,\" Latifah told Essence magazine. \"Everybody else can do the reading; I'll do the living.\"\n\nWe don't blame you, Latifah.\n\nImage: WENN\n\nDo you think Queen Latifah's character is a representation of her life, or just a character?\n\nVH1 is down one of their Single Ladies -- Stacey Dash is departing after one season.\n\nGorgeous actress Stacey Dash finally came to her senses – she's leaving that awful trainwreck of a VH1 show, Single Ladies.\n\n\"I have to be back in L.A. with my children right now and the Single Ladies shooting location [in Atlanta] makes this impossible,\" Dash said in a statement to GlobalGrind. \"I wish VH1 the best of luck with the show in maintaining the strong fan base we developed in Season 1.\"\n\nUh, there won't be a fan base without Dash – she was the center of the show and its biggest star.\n\n\"VH1 respects Stacey's decision and her commitment to what she feels is best for her family. We thank her for all of her hard work in making Single Ladies a success right out of the gate, and we wish her nothing but the best in her future plans,\" the network said in a statement.\n\nHowever, the former Clueless actress might not be telling the whole story. Rumors persisted that Dash didn't get along with some of her co-stars on the show, including LisaRaye McCoy. The dueling duo reportedly got into a physical altercation on set earlier this year, though both sides deny it.\n\n\"I normally don't like to address rumors, but I think it was so unfair to both of us the way they took that story and dragged it out,\" McCoy said in May. \"There was no physical altercation or some beef that people were trying to fabricate. It was us being together for the last 4 or 5 months filming every day for 15 to 16 hours a day.\"\n\nRegardless of the reason, it's pretty much the final nail in the coffin for this awful show and its awful acting. Of course, it's five fans will be upset when it goes.\n\nImage courtesy Adriana M. Barraza / WENN.com\n\nAre you sad Stacey Dash is leaving Single Ladies?\n\nStacey Dash is back on the market, fellas! The former star of Single Ladies officially divorced her husband this week after she claimed he abused her throughout their short marriage.\n\nStacey Dash recently left her VH1 show Single Ladies -- and now she's actually a single lady. Dash, 45, officially divorced her husband of two years, actor Emmanuel Xuereb.\n\nThe Clueless actress filed for divorce from Xuereb in January 2010 after she claimed he physically abused her throughout their marriage. Authorities also granted her a restraining order, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe couple doesn't have children, though Dash does have two children from previous relationships: son Austin, who was born in 1991 and daughter Lola, born in 2003.\n\nDash isn't afraid to be honest when it comes to her past mistakes in love. She admitted that she's slept with all three of her husbands on the first date.\n\n\"Yes, I slept with all my husbands on the first night. And they said, 'Marry Me' and I said, 'yes,'\" she told Smooth magazine last year.\n\nThe actress went to the 2010 Academy Awards as Jamie Foxx's date, though at the time she wanted to stay single. However, she was quick to clarify that she never consummated the relationship with him because she wanted to stay a -- you guessed it -- single lady.\n\n\"I think love is amazing. I'm in love with love. I just don't know what it is in a relationship yet. I've been marrried three times and divorced three times. At this point, I'm trying to fall in love with myself. And hopefully after I do that, I'll be able to fall in love and stay in love with someone else,\" she told Smooth.\n\nImage courtesy Kat Goduco/WENN.com\n\nWhat should Stacey Dash do next in her career and personal life?\n\nMitt Romney has another celebrity supporter in Stacey Dash.\n\nIt seems that Americans are no longer capable of formulating a calm, reasoned argument when it comes to politics. No, people from both sides of the aisle immediately devolve to threats and yelling matches when another person doesn't agree with their views.\n\nPresidential debate: Romney 1, Big Bird 0 >>\n\nCase in point? Actress Stacey Dash. The former Single Ladies star ignited furor among her Twitter followers when she came out in support of Mitt Romney.\n\n\"Vote for Romney. The only choice for your future,\" she tweeted on Oct. 7, along with a photo of herself posing in a bathing suit in front of a flag.\n\nYou'd think she tweeted in support of killing grandmothers and kittens, judging from the response. Followers quickly called everything from her race to her career into question.\n\nLeVar Burton slams Romney for promise to cut PBS >>\n\n\"You’re an unemployed black woman endorsing Mitt Romney. You’re voting against yourself thrice. You poor beautiful idiot,\" one follower wrote.\n\n\"B**** we know the only reason you tweeted that Romney s**t was so you can taste what it feels like to be relevant,\" another tweeted, along with \"just like that @REALStaceyDash is excommunicated from the Black Community ... stupidity at its finest.\"\n\nSusan Sarandon and Joy Behar think Romney is Scrooge >>\n\nThe most disturbing, however, are the tweets calling for the Clueless actress to commit suicide.\n\n\"Kill yaself you old hag,\" one follower wrote. Another follower — a man with a PhD, of all things — also called for her death. He's since deleted the tweet, but it's captured forever on Twitchy.\n\nDash has stopped responded to the trolls. Instead, she put out her own levelheaded response to all the hateful comments.\n\nPaul Ryan's Ayn Rand problem >>\n\n\"My humble opinion... EVERYONE is entitled to one,\" she tweeted.\n\nIs it November yet?\n\nImage courtesy FayesVision/WENN.com\n\nStacey Dash's recent Mitt Romney tweet resulted in a firestorm of comments, some of which were shockingly unkind. Rehashing the Twitter backlash, the actress sat down with Piers Morgan on Tuesday night.\n\nStacey Dash now knows firsthand that politics can be an extremely hot-button issue. Recently, she she spoke out in support of presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and that resulted in a Twitter firestorm which included hate messages and suggestions she kill herself. The Clueless actress admits she's shocked — but she isn't changing her position.\n\n\"The fury, I really don't understand the fury,\" Stacey Dash said on Piers Morgan Tonight. \"I don't understand it. I don't get it... I was shocked, saddened. Not angry. Saddened and really shocked. But you know what, you can't expect everyone to agree with you.\"\n\nPresidential debate: Romney 1, Big Bird 0 >>\n\nSampling a few of the racist, hateful tweets sent to Dash, Piers Morgan read off, \"This is somebody who tweeted, 'You're an unemployed black woman endorsing Mitt Romney. You're voting against yourself thrice, you poor, beautiful idiot.' And somebody else just put, 'Kill yourself, you old hag.'\"\n\nInterestingly, Stacey Dash admitted she voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 election. Still, the 46-year-old said of Mitt Romney, \"I believe him... I watched him, the governor and his wife, on 'Meet the Press...' They spoke to me, they seemed authentic and genuine.\"\n\nAlluding to the famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech by Martin Luther King Jr., she added of Romney, \"I chose him not by the color of his skin, but the content of his character.\"\n\nAnn Romney slated to host Good Morning America >>\n\nThough the Stacey Dash Twitter hate-fest was fast and furious, some have come out in support of the actress. Women's rights activist Sandra Fluke, no stranger to controversy herself, tweeted Monday, \"So disappointed to see people attacking @REALStaceyDash for voicing her opinion. Disagree politically, but #racist attacks are unacceptable.\"\n\nCheck out a clip of Stacey Dash's Piers Morgan Tonight visit:\n\nCNN's Piers Morgan Interviews Actress Stacey Dash about Her Choice for U.S. President\n\nCNN's Piers Morgan interviews American Film and Television Actress Stacey Lauretta Dash, 46, about her decision to publicly endorse Republican Candidate Mitt Romney for President of the United States. Stacey's decision has caused a backlash from her critics. She stated that she endorsed Romney because of \"the content of his character.\" To read Stacey's film credits or biography, you may visit: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001107/ or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Dash respectively.\n\nImage via WENN\n\nWhat were on the Twitter feeds of celebrity moms this week? Actress Stacey Dash was “shocked” over the Twitter backlash after she tweeted her support of Mitt Romney. Bachelor couple Molly and Jason Mesnick tweeted their excitement over their baby announcement, while Jessica Simpson writes about her new maternity line. Singer Pink and pregnant actress Tamera Mowry round out our list of the top tweets of the week!\n\nStacey Dash\n\nClueless star Stacey Dash tweeted her support of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, and topped off her message with a sexy photo of her wearing a red swimsuit in front of an American flag.\n\n“Vote for Romney. The only choice for your future. @mittromney @teamromney #mittromney #VOTE #voteromney,” she tweeted.\n\nThat little tweet generated lots of backlash toward the 45-year-old star, who is a mom to 21-year-old Austin and 7-year-old Lola. Most of the comments are not fit to print, however she was called many not-so-nice names.\n\n“Vote for the candidate with the supporters in the skimpiest outfits?” quipped one commenter.\n\n“My humble opinion... EVERYONE is entitled to one,” Dash later tweeted, defending her views.\n\nShe did have some supporters, however, including vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan.\n\n“Had a great conversation with @REALStaceyDash this afternoon. Thank you for your support!” he tweeted to her.\n\nShe has since appeared on Piers Morgan Tonight to talk about the backlash. She also re-tweeted this quote from Piers Morgan: “I don't get it...I was shocked, saddened.“ @REALStaceyDash on facing fury after endorsing @MittRomney.”\n\n“It is my right as an American citizen. It’s my constitutional right to have my choice of who I want to vote for president… And I chose him not by the color of his skin but the content of his character,” she said in the interview.\n\nJessica Simpson\n\nJessica Simpson may no longer be pregnant, but she is still tweeting about maternity clothes!\n\n“My maternity collection launches TODAY at Destination Maternity/@MotherhoodMat stores. Show off those bumps, ladies!” she wrote, with a link to her new line.\n\nShe also tweeted this adorable picture of her holding her daughter Maxwell. “Last year at Daddy's party, Maxwell was in my belly. This year she's in my arms!”\n\nIn case you are wondering what Simpson is watching on TV, she recently tweeted her favorites: “Big TV night.. Lots starting back up! The Good Wife, Dexter, Homeland, Revenge, and my friend @DaveAnnable10 has a new show 666 Park Avenue!”\n\nPink\n\nIt sounds like Pink’s mom isn’t crazy about her new music video for the song Try, in which she prances around in lingerie with a shirtless dude.\n\n“My mom, after seeing the new video... \"Wow, honey. I'm speechless. And uncomfortable. No one can ever say you play it safe.\" Thanks, mama,” Pink wrote.\n\nHas motherhood changed this tough-as-nails singer? It sure sounds like it! She tweeted: “just watched \"perfect\" video for the first time since having Willow and I need some da** tissues. #softie”\n\nMolly Mesnick\n\n“I step away for 5 minutes & come back to a ton of love,” tweeted Molly Mesnick, who just announced she is pregnant and expecting her first child with her husband, former Bachelor Jason Mesnick. ”Thank you! We couldn't be more excited about the pint size peanut on the way.”\n\nJason, who met Molly on season 13 of the show, has a 7-year-old, Ty, from a previous relationship.\n\n“I am SO excited for your new addition! I just KNOW that nursery is going to be UHHMAZiNG!” tweeted former Bachelorette Jillian Harris to Molly.\n\n“uh yeah...you're doing it,” Molly quipped back.\n\nTamera Mowry\n\n“Had a beautiful brunch with my momma,” tweeted Tamera Mowry, who is pregnant with her first child. “Nothing like the love of a mother.” The former Sister, Sister star tweeted a photo of her pregnant belly next to her mom.\n\n“Just off the phone with my momma…she went on a shopping spree for her grand baby! I’m sooooo excited!!!!!” she later wrote.\n\nMowry and her husband are expecting a baby boy in a few weeks — and they already have a baby name picked out .\n\nIt sounds like this actress is following the celebrity trend of wearing a custom hospital gown during labor and delivery. “Thanks @GlowMaven! Just picked my hospital gown from http://prettypushers.com. I don’t have to wear the stale hospital gown after all” she tweeted.\n\nFrom Beyonce to Jennie Garth, check out more funny, cute, sweet and wacky celebrity mom tweets >>\n\nStacey Dash didn't vote for President Barack Obama, but she's still going to support him.\n\nFormer Single Ladies actress Stacey Dash received death threats and all sorts of nasty messages when she came out in support of Mitt Romney for president earlier this fall. We wouldn't have blamed her if the whole experience had turned her into a bitter right-winger. That's definitely not the case, though. The actress wrote a 1,344-word open letter to TMZ that talked about the reasons she voted for President Obama in 2008 — and why she opted for Romney in 2012.\n\nStacey Dash is officially single & ready to mingle >>\n\n\"I freely admit that presidential politics was not something I had much time for before the 2000 election. With Gore and Bush fighting [it] out to the last hanging chad, it was an experience that made me turn even further away from politics,\" she wrote before alluding to the threats sent by Internet tough guys.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we are in this together. This is Our American Family. I do not want to be a part of the hateful voices insulting each other. I want to be a part of the voices that help shape the future. Don't you? Perhaps I publicly endorsed Romney from a slightly naive place, thinking that I could speak my voice without being criticized in such racially charged and hateful tones.\n\n\"People get it wrong. My vote for Romney isn't a vote against Obama. That's not how full participants in the democratic process operate. We vote for candidates, and we vote for issues.\n\n\"I voted for the Romney ticket because I was inspired by their promises of working tirelessly to create a strong economy as their first objective. I have other issues that are close to my heart, like equality and women's rights and the benefits of strong public schools. I realize, on these issues, I'm entirely progressive. There are plenty of moderate Republicans who feel exactly the way I do on these issues. I don't think we have to trade one for the other. The main objective of our nation must be repairing the economy. All our social concerns must come after this. Without a stable economy, our great nation falls.\n\n\"Ultimately, I know that what Stacey Dash thinks about who will be the next president of the United States isn't that important in the scheme of things — but I feel a desperation for the country. The fact is that when the two parties are not working together, it makes things worse!\"\n\nThe bulk of the letter was written before the election ended, though she added a postscript congratulating the president on four more years.\n\nStacey Dash can't understand the Mitt Romney fury >>\n\n\"President Obama has been re-elected. I congratulate him. No, he was not my choice, but he was the choice of the majority of our country. I do respect and appreciate that the country came together to make a choice. So for that, I applaud Americans,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Although I am disappointed that Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan did not win, I am hopeful that President Obama will lead us to becoming the great UNITED STATES OF AMERICA that thrives.\"\n\nLevel-headed discourse — imagine that! Take note, Donald Trump.\n\nImage courtesy David Livingston/WENN.com\n\nPhoto credit: FayesVision/WENN.com\n\nFox News announced actress Stacey Dash as a new contributor to Fox News on Wednesday, May 28. Dash is probably best known for her role as Alicia Silverstone's character's best friend Dionne in the 1995 cult hit Clueless (as well as the Clueless series that followed).\n\nAccording to Fox News, Dash will be offering \"cultural analysis and commentary across across FOX News' daytime and prime time programs.\"\n\n\"Stacey is an engaging conversationalist whose distinctive viewpoints amongst her Hollywood peers have spawned national debates,\" Executive Vice President of Programming Bill Shine said in a statement. \"We're pleased to have her join FOX News.\"\n\nDash has made her political beliefs public, garnering a lot of criticism after tweeting an endorsement of then-Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney back in 2012.\n\nAfter Barack Obama won the presidency, she released a statement sharing her thoughts on the future of America, and gave some insight into her political beliefs.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we are in this together. This is Our American Family. I do not want to be a part of the hateful voices insulting each other. I want to be a part of the voices that help shape the future. Don't you?\" she wrote. \"I voted for the Romney ticket because I was inspired by their promises of working tirelessly to create a strong economy as their first objective. I have other issues that are close to my heart, like equality and women's rights and the benefits of strong public schools. I realize, on these issues, I'm entirely progressive.

The main objective of our nation must be repairing the economy. All our social concerns must come after this. Without a stable economy, our great nation falls.\"\n\nIn 2013, she also tweeted her support for Paula Deen.\n\nDash has continued her career in Hollywood since Clueless nearly 20 years ago, including in films like View from the Top and Renaissance Man, and as a guest panelist on the Fox News show Outnumbered."
