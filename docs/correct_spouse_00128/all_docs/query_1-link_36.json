        "text": "On Monday (Sept. 30), TMZ broke the story that Stacey Dash was reportedly arrested for hitting her new husband, Jeffrey Marty. Now, the Clueless actress is telling her side of the story.\n\nAccording to the news source, Dash states that Marty and his three kids conspired to have her arrested. Originally, Dash called 911 on Sunday (Sept. 29), and claimed that Marty had her in a chokehold. Upon their arrival, cops found scratches on Marty’s arms and heard statements from his kids. As a result, Dash was arrested and booked for assault.\n\nSecondly, Dash states that Marty coached his children consisting of the ages, 15, 14 and 10 on what to say. For her argument, Dash believes that Marty faked his injuries. Dash informed a dispatcher that Marty is a lawyer so he knows exactly what to tell his “awful children” to make his story believable. Currently, Dash is being held in custody on a $500 bail.\n\nLast spring, the couple tied the knot in Florida. Dash’s marriage to Marty marks her fourth time down the aisle. In the past, Dash married producer Brian Lovell and their relationship lasted from 1999 to 2005. Shortly after, Dash tied the knot to executive James Maby from 2005 to 2006. One year later, Dash married actor Emmanuel Xuereb, however, the two called it quits in 2011.\n\nIronically, Dash’s secret ceremony with Marty took place a few days after the 52-year-old backed out of her plans to run for Congress in California. In her statement, Dash explained the reason for her backpedaling decision. “Deciding to withdraw my candidacy was a difficult choice, but I have to go where I feel God is leading me,” she said at the time."
