        "text": "The main reason for Lola Lovell’s fame is that she is the child of American actress Stacey Dash. On May 10, 2003, she was born in the United States. She does ballet professionally.\n\nFamily Lola Lovell\n\nBrian Lovell and Stacey Lovell were the parents of Lola Lovell. In the movie business was her father employed. The day of their wedding was July 16, 1999. They divorced around the middle of the 2000s, thus they are no longer married. Her mother has been married four times. Second, Stacey wed Sports Logistics CEO James Maby in 2005. They got a divorce in 2006.\n\nFinally, she wed actor Emmanuel Xuereb in the late 2000s. Stacey filed for divorce, and it was finalized in September 2011; they divorced in January. She just wed Jeffrey Marty, an attorney. The wedding took place on April 6, 2018. They are no longer together because Stacey filed for divorce in June 2020.\n\nBecause of her mother’s relationship with Christopher Williams, Lola has a sibling named Austin Williams. He was created on October 29, 1991. Linda and Dennis Dash welcomed Stacey Dash into the world on January 20, 1967, in New York City. She is an actress who has acted in numerous films, including Clueless, Moving, Mo’Money, and Renaissance Man.\n\nStacey acknowledged having a heroin addiction issue\n\nShe acknowledged in one interview that she had spent between $5,000 and $10,000 on drugs. She said that no one knew that she used to take 18 to 20 tablets daily. Lola Lovell claimed that she started using drugs when she was eight years old and that her mother gave her her first line of cocaine when she was sixteen due to the fact that both of her parents were drug users.\n\nHer mother regularly smoked crack and used cocaine, while her father was a heroin addict. She claimed that she was about to pass away. She was rushed to the hospital where she received a complete blood transfusion and spent three weeks because her kidneys were so bad that her blood was septic and her organs were shutting down.\n\nStacey was in an abusive relationship and had experienced assault as a child\n\nWhen Stacey was four years old, she was assaulted, as she told Dr. Oz. She said that she had forgotten about the incident until she made an attempt at suicide at age 17. She claimed that when she was in her early twenties, her husband beat her so severely that she couldn’t get out of bed and couldn’t walk for two weeks.\n\nLoss She lost her job for refusing to perform sexual favors\n\nIn a 2017 interview, Stacey remarked that as a Hollywood actor, you should expect this to happen. By this, she meant that she has lost opportunities as a result of her refusal to perform sexual favors. She added a personal anecdote about getting the part when she was 25 and showing up on location.\n\nBecause she didn’t want to perform nudity in the love scene, she said that the director ordered her to enter his room. When she did, he answered the door inappropriately dressed, the curtains were drawn, and he expected her to join him in bed. When she refused, she claimed that she was dismissed.\n\nWhat is the Net Worth of Lola Lovell? Salary, Earnings"
