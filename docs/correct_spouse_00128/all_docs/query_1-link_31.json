        "text": "Getty\n\nActress Stacey Dash and her fourth husband Jeffrey Marty are over after two years of marriage.\n\nStacey announced the news on Instagram, writing, “Hello everyone, My husband and I have made the hard decision of ending our marriage. After much prayer, I feel this is the right path for both of us. I wish him nothing but the best.”\n\nShe continued, “Thank you everyone for your support and respecting our privacy during this difficult time.”\n\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nStacey and the lawyer wed April 6, 2018, just 10 days after meeting, according to Page Six.\n\nThe news comes after Stacey was arrested during a domestic dispute at their Florida home in September. TMZ reports Stacey accused Jeffrey of assault during the 911 call. She was the one taken into custody after a scratch was found on his arm.\n\nHer team told People in a statement, “No charges were pressed by her husband, however, Deputies arrested Ms. Dash peacefully, as a formality. Ms. Dash's husband appeared in court today, September 30th, on her behalf and Ms. Dash was released from the Land O' Lakes detention facility. No further legal action is pending.”"
