        "text": "AN EX-supporter of former president Trump has turned on Don after years of support as she's claiming she was made out to be an \"angry black woman.\"\n\nStacey Dash, an actress turned conservative pundit, has apologized for the harsh words she said during her time as a Fox News commentator.\n\nThe 54-year-old former 90s starlet, who played Dionne Marie Davenport in the 1995 film Clueless, opened up in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV.\n\nDash expressed regret for the comments she made during her time on Fox News and has insisted she will step away from politics.\n\nShe told the news outlet: \"I've lived my life being angry, which is what I was on Fox News.\n\n\"I've lived my life being angry - you know, which was what I was on Fox News. I was the angry, conservative, Black woman. And at that time in my life it was who I was.\"\n\n\"There are things that I am sorry for. Things that I did say, that I should not have said them the way I said them.\"\n\nBack in 2016, Dash was fired from her roll as a Fox News contributor after saying President Barack Obama didn't \"give a sh*t\" about terrorism and dubbed his speech as an \"epic fail.\"\n\nDash admitted that she realized in 2016 that \"angry is unsustainable and it will destroy you.\n\n\"What people don't know is that I made a lot of mistakes... because of that anger,\" she added.\n\nA year later, in the aftermath of the 2017 Charlottesville neo-Nazi rally in Virginia, Dash was hit with backlash after supporting Trump for calling the demonstrators \"very fine people on both sides.\"\n\nShe also called for an end to Black History month and likened Mexican immigrants to criminals, rapists, and drug traffickers.\n\nHowever, Dash has since admitted there's things she's sorry for, telling DailyMailTV: \"Things that I did say, that I should not have said them the way I said them.\n\n\"They were very arrogant and prideful and angry. And that's who Stacey was, but that's not who Stacey is now. Stacey's someone who has compassion, empathy.\n\n'God has forgiven me, how dare I not forgive someone else. I don't want to be judged, so how dare I judge anyone else.\"\n\nDash revealed the highly criticized January 6 Capitol riots acted as a turning point for her political views.\n\nShe insisted: \"Being a supporter of Trump has put me in some kind of box that I don’t belong in. But he’s not the president...\"\n\n\"I think the Capitol Riots were appalling,\" Dash explained. \"When that happened I was like: 'Ok, I'm done. I'm truly done.'\n\n\"Because senseless violence of any kind I denounce. What happened on January 6 was just appalling and stupid.\"\n\nThe interview comes nearly one year after the Clueless star walked out on her fourth husband after her domestic violence arrest made headlines, The Sun revealed.\n\nDash left attorney Jeffrey Marty after she was booked in Florida, following a violent argument with him on September 29. They had been married less than a year.\n\nBefore Marty, Dash was married to Brian Lovell, James Maby and Emmanuel Xuereb and has two older children - Austin and Lola, who she remains close to.\n\nFollowing her Fox career, Dash campaigned as a Republican for California's 44th district in February 2018 but withdrew from the congressional race just a month later.\n\nDuring her brief political career, the actress, who is part African American, Bajan and Mexican, caused plenty of controversy - including, urging BET (Black Entertainment TV) to be scrapped.\n\nHer film and TV credits over the years include the small screen Clueless spin-off series from 1996 to 1999, along with parts in CSI and Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens."
