        "text": "Clueless actress Stacey Dash has surprised her fans by announcing plans to run for Congress in California.\n\nBut who is Stacey and what else do we know about her?\n\nBorn 20 January 1967, the 51-year-old actress is best known for playing rich kid Dionne Davenport in 1995 film Clueless when she was 28.\n\nOther films she can be seen in are Mo’ Money, Renaissance Man, Moving and View From The Top.\n\nAs well as the Clueless spin-off TV series, she has starred in TV shows including CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Single Ladies and Celebrity Circus.\n\nStacey has been married three times, although she is currently divorced.\n\nShe married Brian Lovell from 1999 to 2005. They have 14-year-old daughter Lola Lovell together.\n\nShe was then married to James Maby from 2005 to 2006 and Emmanuel Xuereb from 2007 to 2011.\n\nStacey also has a 26-year-old son called Austin Williams with R&B singer Christopher Williams.\n\nDash has become best known in recent years for her conservative views, and is now hoping to take her opinions from Twitter and Fox News to Capitol Hill.\n\nStacey has filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run in California’s 44th district.\n\nThe documents show that Stacey’s campaign committee is called ‘Dash To DC’, with the actress also setting up a website with the same name.\n\nShe still needs to submit paperwork with the Los Angeles County Registrar to get herself on the primary ballot for 5 June.\n\nDash has a tough fight on her hands – the seat she’s aiming for, currently taken by Rep. Nanette Barragan, is in a predominantly Democrat district.\n\nStacey tweeted: ‘Formal statements coming. For those mocking for the district I live in…open your minds. It’s time to for me to put up or shut up and I want to serve great people.\n\n‘I live in the 44th unlike some who don’t live in their districts. Thank you to those who offered their support.’\n\nShe previously asked her followers for their ‘thoughts’ on whether she should run, tweeting on 9 February: ‘A number of people online and off have suggested I run for political office. I wanted to see what my online community thinks of this idea as I mull the possibilities. Thoughts?’\n\nWhen one follower asked if she had any skeletons in her closet, Stacey replied: ‘All of my skeletons are on the wash line hanging in the breeze.’\n\nStacey voted for Barack Obama in 2008, but switched her support to Mitt Romney in the next election and is now a staunch Republican.\n\nThe mum-of-two was previously a commentator for Fox News, but her contract ended last year.\n\nStacey has made controversial comments over the past few years which have seen her hit headlines and make Chrissy Teigen pull this face:\n\nShe called for an end to Black History Month and the BET Awards, and suggested that rape victims at universities were ‘bad girls who like to be naughty’, saying: ‘The other bad girls–bad women–are the ones who like to be naughty, might go out and play and get hurt and then, you know…\n\n‘But the other thing about this is that it then blames the alcohol instead of the person who over-drinks.\n\n‘So it’s like, the same thing with guns. Guns don’t kill people; people kill people. Alcohol doesn’t get you drunk; you get yourself drunk.’\n\nStacey also claimed the trans rights movement was ‘infringing on her rights’, telling Entertainment Tonight that transgender women should ‘pee in the bushes’ instead of using the ladies’ bathroom.\n\nHer net worth is estimated at being $8million (£5.7m).\n\nMORE : Donald Trump says he would have run into Florida school shooting unarmed"
