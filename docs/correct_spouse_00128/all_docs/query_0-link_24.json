Stacey Dash filed for divorce in January 2010, the same day she filed for a restraining order against Emmanuel.\n\nStacey claimed that Xuereb had hit her in the face, head and body during their two-plus years of marriage, but she was afraid to report it to police.\n\nIn any case, the marriage – which was Dash’s third – is officially over now.\n\nThe now-former spouses back in happier times.\n\n[Photo: WENN.com]"
