        "text": "By Shannon Raphael\n\nMar. 11 2021, Published 10:58 a.m. ET\n\nThough Clueless debuted in 1995, Stacey Dash is still best associated with her breakout role in the iconic film. The actress played Dionne Davenport, the best friend of Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) in the Amy Heckerling classic. To this day, her character's one-liners are still as well-known as her fashion moments.\n\nStacey played a high school teen in Clueless but she was actually 28 (and a full 10 years older than Alicia) when it filmed.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhile Dionne was navigating her first love with beau Murray (Donald Faison), Stacey was already a mom.\n\nKeep reading for the refresher on Stacey's personal life, including her marriages and her children.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nStacey Dash is a mom to two children.\n\nBefore she became a star on Clueless, Stacey appeared in films like Enemy Territory, Moving, and Mo' Money. In the late '80s, she embarked on a relationship with actor and R&B singer Christopher Williams. She starred in Christopher's 1989 music video for \"Talk to Myself,\" but it's unclear if this was how the two first met.\n\nThe Single Ladies alum and Christopher welcomed their first child and only child together, Austin Dash Williams, in 1990. Their split occurred soon thereafter.\n\nAustin is now in his thirties, and he's been modeling for the better part of a decade. He currently goes by Austin Dash on Instagram, and he often shares photos with his mom on the app.\n\nHe's also been in a relationship with model Sophie Mudd since at least 2017.\n\nHis younger sister, Lola Maby, was born in June of 2003. Lola's dad is Stacey's second husband, James Maby. The couple first swapped vows in 2005 before splitting about a year later.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nJames went on to marry Southern Charm alum Landon Clements, who has since discussed remaining an active part of her former stepdaughter's life.\n\nAfter welcoming her children (and divorcing James), Stacey got married two more times. Her third marriage to Emmanuel Xuereb ended in 2010, but the divorce was only finalized in 2011.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe demise of her fourth marriage to Jeffrey Marty made headlines. Stacey was arrested in 2019, about a year after her nuptials, on a domestic battery charge. The case was later dropped in October of that year.\n\nThe Game actress filed for divorce from Jeffrey in June of 2020.\n\nWho are Stacey Dash's parents?\n\nThe screen star was born in the Bronx in 1967 to parents Dennis and Linda Dash (n√©e Lopez). She has a younger brother named Darien Dash. Her mom and dad did ultimately split up, and Linda got remarried to Cecil Holmes.\n\nHer mother passed away in 2017.\n\nIn her 2016 memoir, There Goes My Social Life: From 'Clueless' to Conservative, Stacey alleged that her parents were addicted to drugs throughout her childhood.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nShe also claimed that her mom introduced her to cocaine when she was 16 years old and that she got addicted to the drug. Her drug abuse persisted through her early 20s, but she said she got clean when she was pregnant with Austin.\n\nWhile she dealt with turmoil in her family life during her upbringing, Stacey is also related to one of the biggest names in music.\n\nShe's the first cousin of music mogul Damon Dash, who is best known as the founder and CEO of Roc-A-Fella Records."
