Stacey Dash, who is best known for her role as Dionne in the 1995 teen film Clueless, has been granted a divorce from her husband of two years, Maltese actor Emmanuel Xuereb.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, Dash filed for a divorce and restraining order against Xuereb in January 2010 and told police that he had hit her throughout her marriage but she had been afraid to tell police.

This marks Dashâ€™s third divorce. The actress was previously married to Brian Lovell from 1999 until 2005, and James Maby from 2005 until 2006.

Dash has two children, son Austin, who was born in 1991, with R&B singer and former boyfriend Christopher Williams, and daughter Lola, who was born in 2003, with her ex-husband Brian Lovell.
