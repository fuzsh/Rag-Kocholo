Stacey Dash has alleged that her husband beat her during their three-year marriage.

The Clueless star was granted a restraining order against Emmanuel Xuereb on the day she filed for divorce in January, reports TMZ.

The order includes allegations that Dash's partner hit her in the face, body and head during their union.

The documents also describe an altercation in which Xuereb pinned Dash down to a bed and threatened her.

The 44-year-old, who is said to be dating Jamie Foxx, said that she was too frightened to report the abuse earlier.

Dash and Xuereb are due back in court in June.
