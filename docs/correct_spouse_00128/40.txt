Clueless actress Stacey is officially divorced from her husband Emmanuel Xuereb.

A judge finally granted her divorce from the loser she claims beat her up on multiple occasions. Stacey Dash filed for divorce in January 2010, the same day she filed for a restraining order against Emmanuel.

Stacey claimed that Xuereb had hit her in the face, head and body during their two-plus years of marriage, but she was afraid to report it to police.

In any case, the marriage – which was Dash’s third – is officially over now.

The now-former spouses back in happier times.
