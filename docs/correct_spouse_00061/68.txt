Los Angeles: Actor James Franco poked fun at rumours that he is dating Lana Del Rey by jokingly announcing they had got married.

The 36-year-old shared a black and white photograph of them together on photo-sharing site Instagram, reports contactmusic.com.

The star captioned the image: "Oh snap, we got married. JUST KIDDING!!!"

Del Rey, 29, fuelled speculation she is enjoying a new romance with Franco after she attended a screening of his movie âChild of Godâ in New York City last week, and then joined him for an intimate after-party in his room at the Tribeca Grand Hotel.

A source told Us Weekly magazine that Franco, who was previously linked to Ahna O'Reilly and Erin Johnson, thinks the singer is "fascinating" and their friendship is on the cusp of turning romantic.

"They've been hanging out and talking a lot,â said a source.
