James Franco and Ahna O’Reilly have parted ways. The two dated for about five years, but “it’s over,” Franco admits in the August issue of Playboy.

His schedule was mostly to blame.

“We’d been living together in L.A. and then came to New York to go school for two years. Then I signed up for more school. I think that was it for her.”

In addition to a busy movie career, the Rise of the Planet of the Apes star has famously been pursuing multiple degrees at Yale, NYU and Columbia.

Before he and O’Reilly began dating in 2006, Franco romanced actress Marla Sokoloff, and has been romantically linked to Sienna Miller as well.

Ahna O’Reilly has appeared in films like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and this summer’s The Help, plus TV’s CSI: NY and The Vampire Diaries.
