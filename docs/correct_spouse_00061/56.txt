James Franco jokingly announced he got married to Lana Del Rey.

The 36-year-old actor poked fun at rumors he is dating the "Young & Beautiful" hitmaker on Instagram on Wednesday, as he shared a black and white photograph of them together.

The This Is the End star captioned the image, "Oh snap, we got married. JUST KIDDING!!!"

Lana, 29, fueled speculation she is enjoying a new romance with the heartthrob after she attended a screening of his movie Child of God in New York City last week, and then joined him for an intimate afterparty in his room at the Tribeca Grand Hotel. A source told Us Weekly magazine that James, who was previously linked to Ahna O'Reilly and Erin Johnson, thinks the singer is "fascinating" and their friendship is on the cusp of turning romantic. "They've been hanging out and talking a lot," the insider added.

A warrant has been issued for Wiz Khalifa's arrest.

The 26-year-old rapper failed to appear for a scheduled court appearance in El Paso yesterday for a hearing over a misdemeanor charge of possession of marijuana.

When Judge Ricardo Herrera learned neither the "We Dem Boyz" star - whose real name is Cameron Thomaz - nor his lawyer had arrived for the hearing, he issued an arrest warrant, TMZ reports. The charges stem from an arrest in May when the rapper - who has 17-month-old son Sebastian with wife Amber Rose - was detained at an airport in El Paso, Texas, after officers from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) allegedly found a "green leafy substance" in his luggage before he boarded a flight to Dallas.

The rapper shared several images online from behind bars, including a "jail selfie" in which he appeared to not be wearing any trousers.

Jaime Pressly has opened up about having an "almost full mastectomy."

The Jennifer Falls actress revealed she noticed lumps forming in her breasts four years after she was first diagnosed with Mastitis - an inflammation in the mammary glad that often results from a bacterial infection related to breastfeeding. She developed a severe form of the benign disorder after welcoming her seven-year-old son, Dezi, with former fiance Eric Cubiche into the world in 2007, and initially assumed she was suffering from "regular breastfeeding pain."

"I had something that happened to me years ago -- when I had my son I got mastitis, but I didn't know because I thought it was just regular breastfeeding pain," The 37-year-old star told The Talk.

After having scar tissue removed from one breast, the blonde beauty's doctors informed her that the disorder had spread and she was forced to remove tissue from her other breast: "[I had] almost [a] full mastectomy. I still have some breast tissue left, just from the mastitis because it mutated into something else because it sat dormant for a while. But it was the craziest thing. Thank God it wasn't [cancer]."

A sexual abuse lawsuit against Bryan Singer has been dropped.

The X-Men: Days of Future Past director was accused by an anonymous British actor - identified only as John Doe No. 117 - of abusing him as a teenager but while Gary Goddard, a Broadway producer, remains a defendant, Bryan is no longer involved.

According to the New York Daily News, a voluntary dismissal was filed on Friday in Los Angeles. Singer's lawyer Marty Singer previously insisted there is no legal basis for the lawsuit and said it was filed improperly. The filmmaker was also seeking $300,000 from the plaintiff to cover the costs of his legal fees, which are said to be "exorbitant."

The unidentified British actor's lawyer Jeffrey Herman filed a lawsuit in May against both Singer, 48, and entertainment industry executive Gary, who filed a similar motion to dismiss in June.

A homeless man has been arrested for stalking Rihanna.

Kevin McGlynn, 53, was taken into custody on Thursday after leaving threatening notes at the star's rented New York home. The New York Post's Page Six reports he was charged with stalking, menacing and harassment and held without bail after writing a string of insulting notes and delivering them twice on July 8 and once on July 1.

Rihanna was forced to put her own sprawling estate in Pacific Palisades, California, on the market in May after owning it for just over a year. The "Stay" hitmaker was put off living at the house, as stalkers kept showing up unannounced.

The singer secured a three-year restraining order against Steveland Barrow in March 2013, after he broke into the property next door, which he wrongly believed to be her home. A judge also ordered Robert Melanson to stay at least 100 yards away from the "Umbrella" singer's house and, or, place of business, after the 26-year-old male trespasser was caught creeping around on her roof last June. In court documents, Rihanna, who was not at home at the time of either incident, wrote she feared for her safety because Robert was unstable and had a criminal history.
