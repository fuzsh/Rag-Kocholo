James Franco has confirmed he's single, saying that his busy schedule was a big factor in his breakup from Ahna O'Reilly.

The couple got together in 2006, but it seems like Ahna got annoyed with his incredibly busy schedule - he juggles acting work, his various university studies as well as numerous side projects.

James told Playboy magazine:

"That [relationship] lasted about four or five years.

"We'd been living together in LA then I came to New York to go to school for two years.

"Then I signed up for more school at Yale. I think that was it for her."

It sounds like it just got too much!
