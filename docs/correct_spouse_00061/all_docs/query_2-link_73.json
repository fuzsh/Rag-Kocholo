        "text": "Exploiting different interests at the same time takes courage and dedication. James Franco is a multi-gifted human being who continues to prove to the world that it is never late to achieve one's dreams. Despite seemingly having it all, his decision to go back to school to increase his knowledge in his adulthood continues to challenge people globally to value education. His open-mindedness and dedication to self-development are admirable.\n\nJames Franco came into the world on the 19th of April 1978 in Palo Alto, California.

The parents met at Stanford University when they were students. Daniel, Franco's maternal grandfather, changed his surname to Verne in the 1940s. Mitzie, his maternal grandmother, ran the Verne Art Gallery that is located in Cleveland, Ohio. Mitze was also actively involved in the operations of the National Council of Jewish Women. Marjorie, his paternal grandmother, authors and publishes books for young adults.\n\nFranco was raised in a loving family in California together with his brothers Tom and Dave. Doug and Betsy raised their boys in a liberal, mostly secular and academic environment. Franco has a shy personality and dreamed of becoming a marine zoologist and an actor. In his teenage years, he joined a gang that would steal designer perfumes from department stores for resale to fellow students. He was arrested for stealing, graffiti, and engaging in underage drinking. His criminal record made him a ward of the state for a while.

His chest measures 42 inches, and his waist is 31 inches.\n\nJames Franco education\n\nDoug encouraged and supported his three sons to attain the best scores in their academics. Franco attended Palo Alto High School where he graduated in 1996 and excelled in his SATS. During his high school years, he was part of his school plays. He then joined the University of California as an English major. He dropped out of campus after his first year, a move that annoyed his parents. Since he would have to wait for two years before securing a slot in the acting program, he chose to take classes in acting at the Playhouse West with Robert Carnegie. While taking the classes, he would work late at night at McDonald's to earn a living because his parents refused to support him after dropping out of school. At McDonald's, he practised accents as he served customers.\n\nAlthough he went on to secure acting jobs after the Playhouse West classes, Franco was not content with his education level. He enrolled at the University of California in 2006 when he was 28 years old. He became an English major student with a concentration in creative writing. The university permitted him to take up to 60-course credits each quarter as opposed to the regular maximum of 19. He continued acting and received many credits from independent study and for being part of the Spider-Man 3 cast. Franco's departmental honours thesis was a novel that was supervised by Mona Simpson. He graduated with his undergraduate degree in June 2008 with a GPA score of 3.5 out of 4.0.\n\nIn a ceremony that was to be held at the University of California on 12th June 2009, Franco was selected as the commencement speaker. This decision was controversial, and students from the institution started a Facebook page opposing the decision. On 3rd June 2009, Franco declined to be the commencement speaker citing that the date was not favourable for him due to his acting roles. His withdrawal was the inspiration for the famous satirical video on Funny or Die, a website that mocked his eleventh-hour cancellation. He and Harvard Lampoon released the video.\n\nAfter his undergraduate studies, Franco relocated to New York to pursue his graduate studies. The actor enrolled at the School of the Arts in Columbia University to study acting and Brooklyn College to pursue fiction-writing. He also enrolled at Warren Wilson College, North Carolina, for the low-residency MFA Writers' Program to study poetry. Additionally, he joined the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University for film classes. In 2010, he joined Yale University to study a PhD course in English. He also took classes at the Rhode Island School of Design.\n\nIn September 2010, Franco made it publicly known that he scored grade D in Acting at the New York University. His professor, José Angel Santana, claimed that he did not earn his grades in school. He claimed that the famous actor got grades based on his celebrity status. The actor made crude remarks about Professor Santana, who sued him in September 2012 for defamation after losing his job at the university. In September the following year, Franco and the professor settled the lawsuit. The actor featured in print advisement for the University of California in March 2013. The advertisement was a celebration of famous and successful alumnus.\n\nREAD ALSO: Robin Williams bio: children, depression, cause of death, final net worth\n\nJames Franco movies and career life\n\nAfter taking acting classes at Playhouse West for 15 months, Franco started auditioning for acting jobs in Los Angeles.
