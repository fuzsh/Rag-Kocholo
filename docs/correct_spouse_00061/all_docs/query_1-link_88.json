        "text": "Is Franco being frank?\n\nJames Franco's sexuality is often a source of speculation, partly because of the characters he portrays on film - such as poet Allen Ginsberg in Howl, activist Scott Smith in Milk and poet Hart Crane in the just-wrapped Broken Tower. Franco told Entertainment Weekly this week that he isn't drawn to characters specifically because of their sexuality. \"There are also lots of other aspects about these characters that I'm interested in, in addition to their sexuality. So, in some ways, it's coincidental; in other ways, it's not,\" Franco told the magazine. \"I mean, I've played a gay man who's living in the '60s and '70s, a gay man who we depicted in the '50s and one being in the '20s. And those were all periods when to be gay, at least being gay in public, was much more difficult. Part of what I'm interested in is how these people who were living anti-normative lifestyles contended with opposition. Or, you know what, maybe I'm just gay.\" In a September interview with the gay magazine The Advocate, the actor denied that he plays for the other team: \"If I was gay, I would come straight out and tell you, but the truth is, I am not.\" Franco, 32, has been in a five-year relationship with actress Ahna O'Reilly.\n\nKeeping the lawyers busy\n\n• My Name Is Earl actress Jaime Pressly was arrested Wednesday night on suspicion of driving under the influence. The 33-year-old actress was driving in Santa Monica, Calif., when police pulled her over about 11 p.m. on a traffic violation, police told TMZ.com. Pressly spend the night in jail and was released on bond yesterday.\n\n• A man who bragged about hacking into Miley Cyrus' e-mail account and distributing revealing pictures of her has been arrested on unrelated charges, according to court documents. Josh Holly, 21, was arrested last week in Nashville, Tenn., and charged with possession of unauthorized credit-card account numbers after FBI agents reviewed evidence obtained when they searched his computer.\n\n• Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan will sue the Australian government for damaging his reputation during a failed criminal investigation into his tax dealings. His attorney said the actor could seek up to $80million for his loss of earnings during the five-year probe, Fairfax Media reported.\n\n• Kanye West is being sued by a photographer who says he was pummeled by the rapper and his employees at a 2008 party underneath the Queensboro Bridge in New York. Michael Vazquez is demanding unspecified damages for the beating he says he suffered at the hands of West and several security guards.\n\nLove notes\n\n• Carlos Santana has found the perfect drummer to make music with. The guitarist, 63, tied the knot with jazz musician Cindy Blackman last month in Hawaii,\n\nE! News reported. He is divorced from his first wife, Deborah.\n\n• One year after announcing she was ready to find love again, The View co-host Sherri Shepherd has done just that. Shepherd, 43, became engaged Dec. 26 to TV writer Lamar Sally, her rep told the Daily News of New York.\n\n- Compiled by Andrew Sterling\n\nasterling@dispatch.com"
