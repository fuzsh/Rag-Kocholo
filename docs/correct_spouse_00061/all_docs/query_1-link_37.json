        "text": "“The Hunger Games” star Josh Hutcherson, as well as Zach Braff, Analeigh Tipton, Ashley Greene and Ahna O’Reilly, have joined James Franco’s “In Dubious Battle,” which has started shooting in Georgia.\n\nPreviously announced cast includes Franco, Selena Gomez, Vincent D’Onofrio, Robert Duvall, Ed Harris, Bryan Cranston, Nat Wolff, John Savage and Sam Shepard. Franco is directing from Matt Rager’s script adapted from John Steinbeck’s 1936 novel of the same name.\n\nThe story centers on a labor conflict between migrant apple pickers and the local growers’ association in a California valley. Jim Nolan, to be played by Franco, becomes involved in the labor movement and rapidly matures as he learns what it means to do organizational fieldwork.\n\nProduction companies are Andrea Iervolino and Lady Monika Bacardi’s AMBI Pictures, Franco’s Rabbit Bandini Productions and That’s Hollywood Pictures. Producers are Iervolino, Bacardi, Scott Reed, Vince Jolivette, Ron Singer and Iris Torres.\n\nAMBI Group is financing. AMBI Distribution co-represents the film’s domestic rights with CAA."
