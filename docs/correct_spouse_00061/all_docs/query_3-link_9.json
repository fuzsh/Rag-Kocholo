        "text": "The thirst of being an actor pushed James Franco to drop out of the university to follow his dream. Although he received a backlash from his parents on the decision, he was sure to pursue his dreams and took up menial jobs for his upkeep as he studied. The actor was lucky to manoeuvre into the field and became successful. Additionally, Franco went back to school and achieved even more than he had started.\n\nJames Franco is an American actor who became famous for his role in the television series Freaks and Geeks. He later got roles in films such as the Spider-Man series, Flyboys, Milk, 127 Hours, and The Disaster Artist.\n\nJames Franco's profile summary\n\nFull name James Edward FrancoGender MaleDate of birth April 19, 1978Age 44 years Zodiac Sign AriesPlace of birthPalo Alto, California, U.S.A.Nationality AmericanEthnicity Mixed-raceSexualityStraightHeight in feet5' 10''Height in centimetres178Weight in pounds167.5Weight in kilograms76Hair colourDark brownEye colourDark brownMotherBetsy Lou (née Verne)FatherDouglas Eugene FrancoSiblingsTom Franco and Dave FrancoMarital statusDatingGirlfriend Isabel PakzadEx-girlfriendMarla Sokoloff, Ahna O'Reilly SchoolPalo Alto High School University University of California, Columbia University, New York UniversityProfessionActor, director, screenwriter, film producer, artist, and poet Net worth$30 millionInstagram@officialjamesfrancoo\n\nEarly life\n\nThe actor was born on April 19, 1978, in Palo Alto, California, U.S.A. His full name is James Edward Franco. Edward’s mother is Betsy Lou (née Verne), a children's book author and an occasional actress. His father is Douglas Eugene Franco, a Silicon Valley business entrepreneur.\n\nJames has mixed ethnicity given that his father was of Swedish ancestry, while his mother is Jewish, from a family of Russian-Jewish descent. The actor grew up in California alongside his two younger brothers, Tom Franco and Dave Franco.\n\nHe attended Palo Alto High School, where he graduated in 1996. While there, he featured in plays that prompted him to join CSSSA in 1998 for theatre studies. He later enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to pursue an English major course.\n\nJames dropped out after his first year against his parents' wishes to pursue an acting career. He then enrolled with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West for the course.\n\nLater education\n\nWhen he became stable, Franco went back to school to quench his education thirst. He re-enrolled at UCLA as a creative writing major in 2006. He took an accelerated course load as he continued with his career. The degree took him two years to complete, and he graduated with a G.P.A. of 3.5/4.\n\nIn 2008, the actor moved to New York and enrolled at Columbia University to pursue a Master of Fine Arts. At the same time, he attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for filmmaking. In addition, he enrolled on a course in fiction writing at Brooklyn College and studied poetry at Warren Wilson College in North Carolina.\n\nIn 2010, he joined Yale University to pursue a PhD in English. The same year, Franco earned his M.F.A. from Columbia. In 2011, he completed his master's degree in filmmaking at New York University.\n\nCareer\n\nJames Franco started his career life after dropping from the University of California when he took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents became hesitant after he dropped from school. The actor's training took 15 months, after which he began auditioning in Los Angeles.\n\nThe 44-year-old was lucky to get his first paying job, a television commercial for Pizza Hut featuring a dancing Elvis Presley. The actor continued to appear in commercials until his first break in 1999. After that, Jimmy was featured in a leading role on N.B.C.'s television series, Freaks and Geeks.\n\nThe series was short-lived but well-reviewed.

Later he played the popular jock Chris in Whatever It Takes (2000), a remake of the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac.\n\nIn 2001, Franco's standout title performance in 2001's T.N.T. cable biopic James Dean made critics note of his talent. The role made him occupied to the point of living a private life away from family and girlfriend. It was, however, rewarding as it earned him the Golden Globe award in 2002 and nominations for an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award (S.A.G.).\n\nMovies and TV shows\n\nFranco got famous and was able to appear in other films and television series.
