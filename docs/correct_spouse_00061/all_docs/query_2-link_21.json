        "text": "James Franco is an American actor, filmmaker, and college instructor. He is best known for starring in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (2002, 2004, and 2007), in which he portrayed Harry Osborn, Pineapple Express (2008), and Oz: The Great and Powerful (2013).\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nJames Edward Franco was born in Palo Alto, California[6] on April 19, 1978.[7] His mother, Betsy Lou (née Verne), is a writer and occasional actress, and his father, Douglas Eugene \"Doug\" Franco, ran a Silicon Valleybusiness.[8][9] His father was of Portuguese (from Madeira) and Swedish ancestry, while his mother is Jewish, from a family of Russian Jewish descent.[10][11][12][13] His maternal grandfather, Daniel, changed his surname from \"Verovitz\" to \"Verne\" some time after 1940.[13][14][15] His paternal grandmother, Marjorie (née Peterson), is a published author of young adult books.[9][16] His maternal grandmother, Mitzie (née Levine), owned the prominent Verne Art Gallery in Cleveland, Ohio, and was an active member in the National Council of Jewish Women.[17][18][19]\n\nFranco's family upbringing was \"academic, liberal, and largely secular\".[20] He grew up in California with his two brothers, actors Tom and Dave.[21] A \"math whiz\", Franco interned at Lockheed Martin.[22] He was often encouraged by his father to get good grades and did well on his SATs.[20] He graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996, where he acted in plays. This led to him attending CSSSA in 1998 for theater studies.[22][23] In his high school years, Franco was arrested for underage drinking, graffiti, and being a part of a group that stole designer fragrances from department stores and sold them to classmates.[24] These arrests led to Franco briefly becoming a ward of the state. Facing the possibility of juvenile hall, he was given a second chance by the judge.[13] He recalled of his troubles with the law, \"It was teen angst. I was uncomfortable in my own skin. I was shy. I changed my ways just in time to get good grades.\"[20]\n\nAlthough the idea of becoming a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared being rejected.[13] He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major,[25] but dropped out after his first year (against his parents' wishes)[22] to pursue a career as an actor, since he would have had to wait two years to audition for their acting program.[13] He instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West.[23] Around this time, he took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian for the year prior to working there.[26] While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial titled \"McDonald's was there for me when no one else was\".[13][27]\n\nCareer[]\n\n1997–2001[]\n\nAfter 15 months of training, he began auditioning in Los Angeles. His first paid role was a television commercial for Pizza Hut, featuring a dancing Elvis Presley (who had died in 1977).[28] He found guest roles on television shows but his first break came in 1999, after he was cast in a leading role on the short-lived but well-reviewed NBC television series Freaks and Geeks,[29] which ran for 18 episodes and was canceled due to low viewership. Later, the show became a cult hit among audiences.[30] He has since described the series as \"one of the most fun\" work experiences that he has had.[31] In another interview, Franco said: \"When we were doing Freaks and Geeks, I didn't quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasn't on me ... So I was improvising a little bit back then, but not in a productive way.\"[21] After his film debut Never Been Kissed, he played a popular jock Chris in Whatever It Takes (2000), a modern-day remake of the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac.[32][33]\n\nHe was subsequently cast as the title role in director Mark Rydell's 2001 TV biographical film James Dean.[34][35] To immerse himself in the role, Franco went from being a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, bleached his dark brown hair blond, and learned to ride a motorcycle as well as play guitar and the bongos.[34] To have a greater understanding of Dean, Franco spent hours with two of Dean's associates. Other research included reading books on Dean and studying his movies.[34] While filming James Dean, the actor, to get into character, cut off communication with his family and friends, as well as his then-girlfriend. \"It was a very lonely existence,\" he notes. \"If I wasn't on a set, I was watching James Dean. That was my whole thinking. James Dean. James Dean.\"[34] Despite already being a fan of Dean, Franco feared he might be typecast if he'd captured the actor too convincingly. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"Franco could have walked through the role and done a passable Dean, but instead gets under the skin of this insecure, rootless young man.\"[36] He received a Golden Globe Award and nominations for an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award (SAG).[37][38][39]\n\n2002–2007[]\n\nFranco achieved worldwide fame and attention in the 2002 superhero film Spider-Man, when he played Harry Osborn, the son of the villainous Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and best friend of Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire). Originally, Franco was considered for the lead role of Spider-Man/Peter Parker in the film,[40] though the lead went to Maguire. Todd McCarthy of Variety noted that there are \"good moments\" between Maguire and Franco in the film.[41] Spider-Man was a commercial and critical success.[42] The movie grossed $114 million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $822 million worldwide.[43]\n\nHe next starred in Sonny, a 2002 release in which he was directed by fellow actor Nicolas Cage, whose involvement had attracted Franco to the film.[44] Set in 1980s New Orleans, Sonnyfollows the titular character (Franco) returning home after just being discharged from the Army. To prepare for his role, he met with sex workers or people who had previously been prostitutes.[44] The movie was panned by critics, with the New York Post's Lou Lumenick calling it an \"instant candidate for worst movie of the year\".[45] Franco was cast as a homeless drug addict in the drama City by the Sea (2002) after co-star Robert De Niro saw a snippet of his work in James Dean.[34] He lived on the streets for several days to better understand the subject matter[46] as well as talking to former or still-using drug addicts.[44] He also co-starred with Neve Campbell in Robert Altman's ballet movie The Company (2003).[20] The success of the first Spider-Man film led Franco to reprise the role in the 2004 sequel, Spider-Man 2. The movie was well received by critics,[42] and it proved to be a big financial success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America.[47] With revenue of $783 million worldwide, it became the second highest-grossing film in 2004.[43] The following year he made and starred in the black comedy The Ape[20] and the 2005 war film The Great Raid, in which he portrayed Robert Prince, a captain in the United States Army's elite Sixth Ranger Battalion. In 2006, Franco co-starred with Tyrese Gibson in Annapolis and played legendary hero Tristan in Tristan & Isolde, a period piece dramatization of the Tristan and Iseult story also starring British actress Sophia Myles. For the former, he did eight months of boxing training and for the latter, he practiced horseback riding and sword fighting.[48] He then completed training for his Private Pilot Licence in preparation for his role in Flyboys,[24] which was released in September 2006; the same month, Franco appeared briefly in The Wicker Man, the remake of the seminal horror film. Also in 2006, he made a cameo appearance in the romantic comedy The Holiday.[35]\n\nHe again played Harry Osborn in Spider-Man 3 (2007). In contrast to the previous two films' positive reviews, Spider-Man 3 was met with a mixed reception by critics.[42] Nonetheless, with a total worldwide gross of $891 million, it stands as the most successful film in the series, and Franco's highest-grossing film to date.[43] In this same year, Franco made a cameo appearance as himself in the Apatow-directed comedy Knocked Up, which starred Freaks and Geeksalumni Seth Rogen, Jason Segel and Martin Starr.[24] Franco co-starred with Sienna Miller in the low-budget independent film Camille, a dark fantasy dramedy about a young newlywed couple and Interview, where he appears in a voice only role, both 2007 movies that were ignored by audiences and critics alike. Among his other 2007 projects were Good Time Max, which Franco wrote, directed and starred in. The movie premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and tells the story of two talented brothers who take very diverse paths in life, one going on to become a doctor whilst the other sibling (Franco) experiences unemployment and uses drugs. The actor chose to cast himself in that role because, \"It was really just a process of elimination. I was better suited for this role than the responsible surgeon\".[49]\n\n2008–2010[]\n\nHe next starred in Pineapple Express (2008), a stoner comedy co-starring and co-written by Seth Rogen and produced by Judd Apatow.[31][50] Of Franco's character, Apatow said, \"You tell him, 'Okay, you're going to play a pot dealer', and he comes back with a three-dimensional character you totally believe exists. He takes it very seriously, even when it's comedy\".[51] In her New York Timesreview, critic Manohla Dargis wrote: \"He's delightful as Saul, loosey-goosey and goofy yet irrepressibly sexy, despite that greasy curtain of hair and a crash pad with a zero WAF (Woman Acceptance Factor). It's an unshowy, generous performance and it greatly humanizes a movie that, as it shifts genre gears and cranks up the noise, becomes disappointingly sober and self-serious\".[52] His performance earned him a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.[37] He has stated in some interviews that he no longer uses cannabis (although he has occasionally alluded to smoking it, most notably during an extended segment on The Colbert Report).[53] He was awarded High Times magazine's Stoner of the Year Award for his work in Pineapple Express.[54] In 2008 he also appeared in two films by American artist Carter, exhibited at the Yvon Lambert gallery in Paris.[55] On September 20, 2008, he hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL),[56] and a second time on December 19, 2009.[57]\n\nFranco starred with Sean Penn, Josh Brolin and Emile Hirsch, in Gus Van Sant's Milk (2008).[58] In the film he plays Scott Smith, the boyfriend of Harvey Milk (Penn). Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, in review of the film, wrote: \"Franco is a nice match for him [Penn] as the lover who finally has enough of political life\".[59] For his performance in the film, Franco won the Independent Spirit Award in the category for Best Supporting Actor.[60] In late 2009 he joined the cast of the daytime soap opera General Hospital on a recurring basis. He plays Franco, a multimedia artist much like himself,[22] who comes to Port Charles to do an art exhibition and becomes obsessed with Jason Morgan (Steve Burton).[61] Franco has called his General Hospital role performance art.[62]\n\nFranco began 2010 by making an appearance on the sitcom 30 Rock where he played himself and carried on a fake romance with Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) in a scheme concocted by their respective agents.[63] After appearing in the commercial successes Date Night, an action comedy, and Eat Pray Love, an adaption of a novel, Franco played poet Allen Ginsberg in the drama Howl, released on September 24.[15] The latter, about his most known poem and the trial about the work, premiered at the Berlin Film Festival and earned modest reviews.[42]\n\nIn his next project, 127 Hours, directed by Danny Boyle, Franco portrayed real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston. It was given a limited release starting on November 5, 2010.[64] 127 Hours centered on Ralston trying to free his hand after it became trapped under a boulder in a ravine while canyoneering alone in Utah and resorting to desperate measures in order to survive, eventually amputating his arm. During the five-week, 12-hours-per-day shoot, Franco would only leave the gully set to use the lavatory and would read books such as academic textbooks to keep busy.[65] Franco later called making 127 Hours a once-in-a-lifetime experience.[66] To date, 127 Hours is one of his most well-reviewed movies[42] and was also a commercial success, earning $60.7 million against an $18 million budget.[64] His performance earned him universal acclaim from critics. Subsequently, he was nominated for an Academy Award, Golden Globe and SAG award, as well as winning an Independent Spirit Award.[citation needed] I didn't have many actors to act opposite with, so the crew and the director and the writer, they all became my co-stars in a way and we all had this one character to share in. I, it was my body but we were all kinda jammed in there [the gully].[66]\n\n— James Franco on filming 127 Hours\n\n2011–present[]\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Franco made a cameo appearance on NBC's Minute to Win It where the real-life Ralston was participating as a contestant playing for charity.[67] After having an uncredited cameo in the opening scene of The Green Hornet (2011),[68] he starred opposite Natalie Portman and Danny McBride in the Medieval fantasy comedy Your Highness.[69] In the film, he plays Fabious, a prince who teams up with his brother (McBride) to rescue the soon to be bride of Fabious (played by Zooey Deschanel). In May 2010, he was cast to star in Rupert Wyatt's $93 million budgeted Rise of the Planet of the Apes, a reboot of the Planet of the Apes series[70] which was released on August 5. Franco starred alongside Winona Ryder in The Letter, originally entitled The Stare, directed by Jay Anania. He was cast as a drug-addicted lawyer in About Cherry, also starring Heather Graham, which started shooting the following month in California.[71] He dropped out of the indie film While We're Young[72] to star in Oz the Great and Powerful, a Disney prequel to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). Filming began in July 2011, and the film was released on March 8, 2013. He has signed to do a sequel to it.[73][74]\n\nAt the end of September 2010, the actor acquired the rights to Stephen Elliott's The Adderall Diaries, with the intention to adapt, direct, and star in the film.[75] It was announced in January 2011 that the actor has planned to not only star in, but direct himself in The Night Stalker, a film version of author Philip Carlo's book about the 1980s serial killer, Richard Ramirez. Co-screenwriter of the screenplay, Nicholas Constantine, was initially unconvinced that Franco would be right for the movie, until he learned of Franco's desire to be a director and later watched three of his short films, one of which featured a serial killer, ultimately confirming to the writer that the actor had a darker side.[76] Franco also directed a film version of William Faulkner's novel As I Lay Dying.,[77] the film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.[78] In late 2013, Franco starred in This Is the End as a fictionalized version of himself stuck in a house during an apocalypse with Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride, also fictionalized versions of themselves.[79]\n\nIn February 2012, Franco began shooting a film version of Cormac McCarthy's 1973 novella Child of God, which stars Scott Haze as Lester Ballard. The film chronicles the depraved and violent impulses of the young Tennessee backwoodsman after he is dispossessed of his ancestral land. Child of God was selected in official competition at the 70th Venice Film Festival, an official selection to the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival and an official selection to the prestigious 51st New York Film Festival. In 2013, Franco starred as the gangster \"Alien\" in Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers, with Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, Gucci Mane and Rachel Korine. A24 films began a campaign in September 2013 in support of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for Franco's performance.[80] In March 2013, it was announced that Franco was set to make his 2014 Broadway stage debut in the role of George in a revival of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men.[81] In October 2013, Franco appeared in the music video for \"City of Angels\" by Thirty Seconds to Mars.[82]\n\n[1]\n\nFranco at the New York Film Critics Series première of Child of God.\n\nIn April 2014, Franco directed and appeared in \"Techno Color Sunglasses\", which promoted Gucci's eyewear collection.[83] In December, Franco starred in the controversial Sony comedy thriller, The Interview, a film which played a central role in the real world diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea as they related to the 2014 Sony hacking incident.[84] In April 2015, two of his projects, titled I Am Michael and True Story, were shown at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. In I Am Michael, Franco plays a gay activist who rejects his homosexuality and becomes a conservative Christian pastor with a girlfriend. In True Story, based on a true story, Franco played Christian Longo, a man who was on the FBI's most wanted list for murdering his wife and three children in Oregon, and who had also been hiding under the identity of Michael Finkel, a journalist played by Jonah Hill.[85]\n\nIn 2015, Franco was cast in the lead role for the Hulu limited series 11.22.63 which is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King.[86] The eight-episode series premiered on February 15, 2016.[87] In 2016, Franco co-produced and starred in King Cobra, a true story about the rise of gay pornographic actor Brent Corrigan and the murder of Bryan Kocis. Franco played Joseph Kerekes who (along with his partner) was convicted of the murder. In the comedy Why Him?, released in December 2016, Franco played an immature tech-billionaire whose girlfriend's conservative father tries to intervene in the couple's relationship, with Zoey Deutch playing the girlfriend and Bryan Cranston as her father.[88] He briefly appeared in the Alien prequel, Alien: Covenant, alongside friend and frequent collaborator Danny McBride, and Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace. He played Branson, the captain of the Covenant ship and husband to Daniels, played by Katherine Waterston. The film was released on May 19, 2017.[89]\n\nIn 2016, Franco directed, co-produced, and starred in The Disaster Artist, the film adaptation of actor Greg Sestero's non-fiction book of the same name, about the making of The Room, which is considered to be one of worst films ever made.[90] In the film, Franco portrayed the film's star, director, screenwriter, and producer Tommy Wiseau, while Franco's brother, Dave, portrayed Sestero.[91] Franco remained in character as Wiseau throughout the entirety of the shoot.[92] The Disaster Artist was released on December 1, 2017, to positive reviews, while his portrayal of Wiseau gained near-universal praise.[93] His performance won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.[94]\n\nAt the end of 2017, Franco, almost 40, said he was slowing down to focus on himself. He was having something of a moment, with two Golden Globe nominations and some Oscar buzz, to which he has said he brought a new perspective: \"Hard work does pay off, but what I didn't realize is you need balance, and you cannot make your happiness contingent on your work, or anything outside of you for that matter, right? It's gotta be, at the risk of sounding cheesy, a more spiritual thing. I didn't learn that until a year ago.\"[95]\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nReligion[]\n\nFranco has described himself as Jewish;[14] regarding his secular upbringing, he told The Guardian that he feels as if he has \"missed out on the Jewish experience\", but has been told not to worry about that by his Jewish friends and said in the same interview that he likes \"the idea of religion as a source of community\". When asked if he was a \"believer\", he responded, \"In God? I don't know. Yes. To a certain extent. It's a complicated question.\"[20] In 2015, he had an official Bar Mitzvah ceremony, presided over by a rabbi.[139]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nDue to his support for the LGBT community, and his portrayal of gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has been a subject of discussion in media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. \"Or, you know what,\" he quipped, \"maybe I'm just gay.\"[140] In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, commenting that it is not whom you have sex with that defines your sexuality, but instead how you act. \"In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren't considered gay.\" He added, \"Well, I like to think that I'm gay in my art and straight in my life.\"[141]\n\nAfter meeting on the set of Whatever It Takes in 1999, Franco dated co-star Marla Sokoloff for five years.[142] He was later in a relationship with actress Ahna O'Reilly until 2011.[142][143] He confirmed their separation in an interview for Playboy magazine's August 2011 issue, saying that his interest in education got between them.[132]\n\nMisconduct accusations[]\n\nIn 2014, a 17-year-old girl posted screenshots of alleged messages between her and Franco on Instagram.[144][145] The messages showed that Franco, who was 35 at the time, tried to meet her in a hotel room after she told him she was 17. Franco sent multiple pictures of himself to prove his real identity. Franco admitted on Live! With Kelly and Michael that he had written the messages.[146][147] His actions were legal (the age of consent in New York is seventeen) but he was criticized by the media because of the wide age gap. He initially responded to the scandal with the tweet, \"I HOPE PARENTS KEEP THEIR TEENS AWAY FROM ME. Thank you.\" He later stated he was \"embarrassed\" and \"I learned my lesson.\"[148][149]\n\nAt the 2018 Golden Globes, Franco wore a Time's Up pin in solidarity with the #MeToo movement, to protest harassment against women.[150] Franco's pin drew criticism on social media from actress Ally Sheedy, who hinted she had quit acting after working with Franco in a play. A former girlfriend, Violet Paley, also alleged that Franco once forced her to give him oral sex in a car while they were dating. On January 9, 2018, The New York Times canceled a planned event with James Franco, citing the allegations.[151] On January 10, Franco said on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that the accusations were \"not accurate.\"[150]\n\nOn January 11, the Los Angeles Times reported five additional women were accusing James Franco of inappropriate or sexually exploitative behavior while serving as their acting teacher. One former student stated that Franco \"would always make everybody think there were possible roles on the table if we were to perform sexual acts or take off our shirts\" in his projects. Another alleged that Franco held a sex scenes class and removed students' vaginal guards while simulating oral sex with them. Franco's attorney, Michael Plonsker, disputed these women's allegations.[152]\n\nIn Busy Phillips' 2018 memoir, she puts forth an account in which Franco screamed at her before violently shoving her to the ground while on the set of Freaks and Geeks.[153]\n\nEducation[]\n\nFranco, dissatisfied with his career's direction,[22] reenrolled at UCLA in autumn 2006 as an English major with a creative writing concentration. He received permission to take as many as 62 course credits per quartercompared to the normal limit of 19,[154] while still continuing to act, receiving many of his credits from independent study for his involvement on the set of Spider-Man 3. He received his undergraduate degree in June 2008 with a GPA of 3.5/4.0.[154][22][155] For his degree, Franco prepared his departmental honors thesis as a novel under the supervision of Mona Simpson.[22] While at the university the actor studied French, the Holocaust, philosophy of science and American literature, among other things. To continue acting, he would study on film sets.[20]\n\nHe was selected as the commencement speaker at his alma mater, UCLA, and was to speak at the ceremony on June 12, 2009. Several months before commencement, an editorial in the student newspaper questioned his \"caliber\" and a student created a Facebook page protesting the choice.[156] On June 3, Franco withdrew, citing a date conflict with location pre-production on a film.[157][158] On January 26, 2011, Franco and the Harvard Lampoon released a satirical video on prominent comedy website Funny or Die mocking his last-minute cancellation.[159]\n\nHe moved to New York to simultaneously attend graduate school at Columbia University's MFA writing program, New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for filmmaking,[97][160][161][162] and Brooklyn College for fiction writing,[154] while also attending the low-residency MFA Program for Writers at North Carolina's Warren Wilson College for poetry.[22] He received his MFA from Columbia in 2010.[163] Franco is a PhD student in English at Yale University[164][timeframe?] and also attended the Rhode Island School of Design.[22]\n\nFranco opted against watching the 2011 Academy Award nominees' being announced (where he was a top contender) in favor of attending class. \"I'm not gonna miss class to go and presume that I'm going to be nominated, but if you want to bring out a camera crew to Yale and wait and see if I get nominated, I'd be happy to step out of class and say I'm very grateful\", he commented.[165]\n\nIt was announced in March 2011 that Franco will teach a fall semester course on modifying poetry into short films to ten to twelve third-year graduate film students at NYU. The course will focus mainly on production, meaning that the students will be in charge of creating their own film based on poetry.[166] He has also taught film classes at USC and UCLA, as well as a screenwriting class on the online learning community Skillshare.[167]\n\nWhen asked about his education, Franco said that he loves school, and that it keeps him focused and grounded. \"I go to school because I love being around people who are interested in what I'm interested in and I'm having a great experience ... I'm studying things that I love so it's not like it's a chore\", he told The Washington Post, according to a New York Magazine article.[168] Franco has also credited his education for helping him \"take acting seriously\" when his parents did not see it as a successful post-college career.[13]\n\nFranco developed an aptitude for art—painting in particular—during his high school years while attending the California State Summer School for the Arts (CSSSA).[23] Franco has said painting was the \"outlet\" he needed in high school, and he \"has actually been painting longer than he has been acting\".[169] His paintings were displayed publicly for the first time at the Glü Gallery in Los Angeles, from January 7, through February 11, 2006.[23][170] He launched his first European art exhibition in 2011 at Peres Projects in Berlin.[103] He enjoys reading on the set of his films. Pineapple Express producer Judd Apatow has said of him: \"He's a very education-minded person. We used to laugh because in between takes he'd be reading The Iliad on set. We still haven't read The Iliad. It was a very difficult book. With him, it was always James Joyce or something\".[171]\n\nIn an interview with Showbiz411, on September 23, 2010, Franco made the erroneous public announcement that he received a \"D\" grade in \"Acting\" class at the NYU Graduate Film School.[172] It was in fact a \"Directing the Actor\" class. Franco admitted to missing most of his classes that semester. A professor at New York University, José Angel Santana, alleged that Franco did not earn his grades while attending that school, stating that Franco missed over 80% of his classes and only received high marks and a degree because of his celebrity status as an actor.[173] In September 2012, Santana filed a lawsuit against Franco for defamation seeking unspecified damages.[174][175] In September 2013, Franco and Santana settled the defamation lawsuit. \"The matter has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties\", said Santana's attorney Matthew Blit.[176]\n\nFranco defended himself when he was on the Howard Stern Show, stating that he had spoken with the professor before the semester began on how he would have to miss most classes to film 127 Hours, in which they had settled on Franco receiving a \"D\" in the course together.[177] Franco has taught at USC, UCLA, CalArts and NYU in Film and English departments. For his students' film projects, he has helped to attract actors, including Seth MacFarlane, Kate Mara, Natalie Portman, Chloe Sevigny, Kristen Wiig and Olivia Wilde.[178] In March 2013, Franco was featured in half-page print advertisements for his alma mater UCLA, which celebrated the university's famous alumnus as a \"prolific academic\", and carried the tagline: \"Some A-Listers Actually Get A's\".[179]\n\nRoles/Filmography[]\n\nRoles[]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]"
