        "text": "Is There Method To James Franco's Madness?\n\nBy Sophie Miskiw in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 20 May 2014\n\nWhen James Franco hit on that Scottish 17 year old we were really hoping he was going to say it was part of the promotion for his film Palo Alto. The thing is, James Franco sort of had it all. Aside from resembling a modern day Greek God, the Masters educated Hollywood star put in an Academy Award nominated performance in 127 Hours and does tons of charity work. Like, seriously, what’s not to like? On paper he's just too good to be true.\n\nJames Franco has become synonymous with 'weird' in recent months\n\nNow, we all like a bit of quirk, there’s something even more attractive about a gorgeous man who doesn’t mind a smidgen of silliness. So when James Franco began posting bizarre images on his Instagram account, cryptic tweets on his Twitter and a myriad of selfies on his Facebook, we were all, “Oh, James Franco, thou art so silly.”\n\nContinue reading: Is There Method To James Franco's Madness?\n\nPussy Riot Linked To 'Spring Breakers' Sequel 'Second Coming'\n\nBy Elinor Cosgrave in Movies / TV / Theatre on 18 May 2014\n\nThe sequel to Spring Breakers, the hit 2012 comedy, is going ahead and Pussy Riot may be the stars.\n\nNadya Tolokonnikova is one of the most notorious members of Pussy Riot.\n\nPussy Riot, the highly politicised Russian punk band, consists of a number of women the most prominent being Nadezhda “Nadya” Tolokonnikova and Maria “Masha” Alyokhina. They have, allegedly, a meeting with Spring Breakers: Second Coming director Jonas Akerlund and the film’s producers which is scheduled to take place in Cannes later this week, according to Variety.\n\nContinue reading: Pussy Riot Linked To 'Spring Breakers' Sequel 'Second Coming'\n\nJames Franco Offers Explanation For Half-Naked Selfies: \"It's What The People Want\"\n\nBy Nick Hill in Movies / TV / Theatre on 10 May 2014\n\nJames Franco leaves many of his social media followers clueless to why he posts several selfies of himself half-naked.\n\nBut finally they get an explanation, and the 36 year-old actor also reiterated it is only for a bit of fun, and apparently \"it's what the people want.\"\n\nFranco defended his shirtless Instagram snaps to David Letterman while appearing on 'Late Night' this past Thursday (May 8th).\n\nContinue reading: James Franco Offers Explanation For Half-Naked Selfies: \"It's What The People Want\"\n\nGia Coppola's Adaptation Of James Frano's 'Palo Alto' Strikes A Chord With Critics\n\nBy Jack de Aguilar in Movies / TV / Theatre on 09 May 2014\n\nAdapted from a collection of short stories penned by James Franco, Gia Coppola’s ‘Palo Alto’ has proved a hit with the critics, accumulating a score of 75 on Metacritic, and attracting quote-worthy review segments, like David Ehrlich’s “Palo Alto is one of the best movies ever made about high school life in America”.\n\nGia Coppola at the 70th Venice Film Festival\n\n“The movie perfectly captures the vibe of late high school, in a way that's both of its time and timeless. Palo Alto is set in the present, an era in which kids can text one another their whereabouts instead of having to walk or drive around aimlessly until they run into someone they know, or might want to know,” writes Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice.\n\nContinue reading: Gia Coppola's Adaptation Of James Frano's 'Palo Alto' Strikes A Chord With Critics\n\n'Spring Breakers' Sequel Is Officially In Development\n\nBy Nick Hill in Movies / TV / Theatre on 07 May 2014\n\n'Spring Breakers', the 2013 Harmony Korine-directed flick, has been granted a sequel.\n\nA follow-up to the provocative and mesmerizing film, titled 'Spring Breakers: The Second Coming,' is now under development by the Paris-based production company Wild Bunch, according to Screen Daily.\n\nThe cast of 'Spring Breakers'\n\nContinue reading: 'Spring Breakers' Sequel Is Officially In Development\n\nJames Franco Admits Kanye West Asked Him And Seth Rogen To Perform 'Bound 2' Parody At Kim Kardashian Wedding\n\nBy Nick Hill in Music / Festivals on 23 April 2014\n\nJames Franco and Seth Rogen's parody of Kanye West's 'Bound 2' track was a hit with the rapper.\n\nThe 36 year-old music star liked it that much he apparently asked the comedy duo to perform 'Bound 3' the night before his and Kim Kardashian's upcoming wedding, according to Mr Franco.\n\nThis revelation came when the 36 year-old actor appeared on 'The View' with his 'Of Mice And Men' cast, Chris O'Dowd and Leighton Meester to talk about heir Broadway show.\n\nContinue reading: James Franco Admits Kanye West Asked Him And Seth Rogen To Perform 'Bound 2' Parody At Kim Kardashian Wedding\n\nJames Franco \"Embarrassed\" For Attempting To Chat Up 17 Year-old Girl Via Instagram\n\nBy Nick Hill in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 05 April 2014\n\nJames Franco was forced to address the situation of him attempting to chat up a 17 year-old British girl via Instagram.\n\nThe 35 year-old actor met Lucy Clode, a Scottish teen who was on vacation in New York City, outside the theatre where he is starring in Broadway's 'Of Mice and Men' on Monday (March 31st).\n\nWhen the young fan asked for a picture, Franco obliged and told her to tag him on Instagram.\n\nContinue reading: James Franco \"Embarrassed\" For Attempting To Chat Up 17 Year-old Girl Via Instagram\n\nJames Franco Claims Lindsay Lohan Is Lying About Ex-Lovers List\n\nBy Nick Hill in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 29 March 2014\n\nJames Franco was one of the 36 names on a list Lindsay Lohan allegedly wrote, naming all the famous people she had slept with.\n\nAmong the stars the 'Mean Girls' actress has had sex with are Ashton Kutcher, Zac Efron, Adam Levine and the late Heath Ledger.\n\nIn Touch, who obtained the list, claims a source handed over the piece of paper, which was written when Lindsay and a few of her friends were at the Beverly Hills Hotel on January 30th.\n\nContinue reading: James Franco Claims Lindsay Lohan Is Lying About Ex-Lovers List\n\nJames Franco: Lindsay Lohan Came On To Me But I Didn't Sleep With Her\n\nBy Lauren James in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 28 March 2014\n\nJames Franco has openly denied the claim made by fellow actor Lindsay Lohan that the pair slept together.

The 35 year-old film star features many celebrities, including Lohan, in his recently-published poetry book, Directing Herbert White. \"I didn't write anything bad about them,\" the actor said. \"And Lindsay herself has told lies about me with her people-she's-slept-with list! So I feel like what I said is much less than what she's said,\" Franco added.\n\nContinue reading: James Franco: Lindsay Lohan Came On To Me But I Didn't Sleep With Her\n\nKermiggy Vs. Kimye - The Muppets Mock Kim Kardashian & Kanye West's Vogue Cover\n\nBy Elinor Cosgrave in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 23 March 2014\n\nA war of words has been waging on social media between those who believe Kim Kardashian is the height of fashion and sophistication and those who feel her name should not be mentioned in the same sentence as such words. Since she appeared on the cover of US Vogue with fiancé Kanye West, a number of couples have stepped forward to show they can out do the loved up couple. These aren't just any couples either: Miss Piggy and Kermit as well as James Franco and Seth Rogen have made their own photographic contribution to the Kimye Vogue debate.\n\nKim Kardashian wangled the cover of US Vogue, realised on Friday (21st March).\n\nMiss Piggy is a style icon. No one can possibly deny this: she can sing (sort of); dance (most definitely); has worked for Vogue (as a Plus Size Editor); and has graced our screens since 1974. She's one of the greatest stars of all time, yet she was still pipped to the cover of Vogue by none other than the reigning Queen of popular culture, Kim Kardashian. We can weep at the cruel injustice - everyone knows Miss Piggy and her beau are considerably more Vogue friendly than Kardashian and Kanye but alas it was not meant to be.\n\nContinue reading: Kermiggy Vs. Kimye - The Muppets Mock Kim Kardashian & Kanye West's Vogue Cover\n\nAll The Celebrities That Seth Rogen Has Smoked Weed With.\n\nBy Michael West in Movies / TV / Theatre on 14 March 2014\n\nJust days after Lindsay Lohan allegedly released a list of her famous bedroom partners, Seth Rogen has revealed all the Hollywood stars that have joined him for a premium pot-smoking session. Rogen - the star of Knocked Up, Pineapple Express and Neighbors - has made no secret of his penchant for a smoke, and now we know who he's lighting up with.\n\nSeth Rogen Smokes Weed, A Lot\n\nDuring an interview with Watch What Happens Live, Rogen said: \"This is really depressing for me to say ... I've never smoked weed with James Franco because he doesn't smoke weed. That's why he's such a good actor! It's really sad, actually.\" The friends starred together in the stoner comedy Pineapple Express.\n\nContinue reading: All The Celebrities That Seth Rogen Has Smoked Weed With.\n\nVeronica Mars Review\n\nBy Rich Cline\n\nVery Good\n\nFunded by fans, this follow-up to the cult TV show feels a lot like an extended reunion episode. But even those unfamiliar with the series will enjoy the twisty plot and smart dialog, plus the sparky Kristen Bell in the title role. And while there are rather too many characters for a stand-alone movie, they all feed nicely into the central mystery.\n\nAfter escaping from the run-down seaside town of Neptune, California, nine years ago, Veronica (Bell) has become a New York lawyer. But just as she's on the verge of landing her first proper job, an old friend is murdered back home, waking her investigatory instincts. The worst of it is that her ex Logan (Dohring) is the prime suspect, so Veronica heads home to help him clear his name. Her private eye dad (Colantoni) just rolls his eyes when she slips back into her old mystery-solving role, working with her pals Mac, Weevil and Wallace (Majorino, Capra and Daggs). But three other classmates - Gia, Cobb and Dick (Ritter, Starr and Hansen) - are also involved. And the fact that she keeps putting off her return to New York annoys her boyfriend Piz (Lowell).\n\nThe most refreshing thing about this film is the way filmmaker Thomas refuses to play by the usual rules. Bell may have been offered a dream job, but we fully understand why she's blowing it off to help her friends. And the whodunit plot is just intriguing enough to hold our interest: we don't really care who the villain really is, but it's fun to watch Veronica dig through the clues and challenge every level of authority. And the script gleefully stirs in red herrings, side-plots and lots of suspicious-looking characters.\n\nContinue reading: Veronica Mars Review\n\nAs Judd Apatow Continues His Revenge, We Remember 'Freaks And Geeks'\n\nBy Stephanie Chase in Movies / TV / Theatre on 13 March 2014\n\n‘Freaks and Geeks’ may have only lasted for one season, but the show has had an enduring legacy, not least of all for producer Judd Apatow who has just called his whole career 'revenge' for its cancellation. With just 18 episodes (only 12 of which NBC aired), how can such a little show have made such a big impact? Well you only have to look at the list of people who came together on the ‘Freaks and Geeks’ set to understand while we’re still talking about it 14 years later. James Franco, Seth Rogen and Jason Segel are just a few of the names who started their careers in the McKinley high cafeteria.\n\nJudd Apatow is still taking revenge for the cancellation of 'Freaks and Geeks'\n\nFirstly if you’ve never seen or heard of ‘Freaks and Geeks’, you need to go and find a way to watch it, now.

Sirens will be aired on USA Network and is a remake of the British comedy of the same name. The series is a based around the shenanigans of three Chicago emergency medical technicians.

Leary was the co-creator of TV show Rescue Me while Bob Fisher is the name behind hit comedy movie Wedding Crashers.

Having already found success at the Gotham Awards last month, the latest win for ...Llewyn Davis might further outline the credentials of the latest Coen Brothers film as a potential Oscar contender, having largely been overlooked by most commentators.\n\nThe film's star Oscar Isaac was also honoured with the Best Actor award\n\nThe film was crowned Best Picture ahead of American Hustle, which came second in the overall voting, and 12 Years a Slave, which placed third. Despite winning yet another award, the Coen Brother's 'a week in the life' tale of a musician traveling through the Greenwich folk scene in 60's New York is still largely considered an outsider for major awards success, however if these gongs keep on piling up for the Coens then the Academy may be persuaded to change their mind somewhat when the votes are cast.\n\nContinue reading: 'Inside Llewyn Davis' Wins Big At US Critics Society Awards\n\nJames Franco Attempts To Explain The Phenomena Of The 'Selfie'\n\nBy Nick Hill in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 28 December 2013\n\nWhy do we love 'selfies'?

Based on the Chuck Logan novel of the same name, the film will introduce Logan's much-used character Phil Broker (Jason Statham) to the big screen for the first time and judging by the trailer alone, we should be in for a wild ride when the film is released later this year.\n\nThings start off blissfully for Broker and his daughter\n\nBroker is an ex-DEA agent (not a former Minnesota cop, as he is in the book) who moves out to a rural town in the south of the United States to begin a new life with his daughter, Maddie (Izabela Vidovic), following the death of his wife. At first, things seem to be as idyllic as Broker would have hoped, with horses to ride, lakes to swim in and a large house to call their own, however things soon take a turn for the worse when Broker's daughter fights back against the school bully.\n\nContinue reading: Jason Statham & James Franco Face Off In Explosive 'Homefront' Trailer [Still + Trailer]\n\nWhy Paul Haggis Wants 'Third Person' To Irritate People With Its \"Russian Doll\" Structure\n\nBy Lauren James in Movies / TV / Theatre on 13 September 2013\n\nThird Person has premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, challenging audiences with its interwoven storyline and unanswered questions.

Of course, the subject matter of 'Lovelace' will always raise eyebrows, but is the new movie co-starring Peter Sarsgaard and James Franco really that risqué?\n\nAmanda Seyfried as 'Linda Lovelace' in Rob Epstein's Forthcomig Biopic\n\n\"I read the script and I was like, 'Wow, this is the riskiest thing that's happening [in Hollywood] right now,'\" said Seyfried to Elle magazine this month. \"The first thing you think about is that it could have ruined my career.

Lovelace, stars Les Miserables actress Amanda Seyfried in the lead role, with the excellent Peter Sarsgaard playing her sleazy and abusive husband Chuck Traynor.\n\nPeter Sarsgaard [L] as Chuck Traynor and Amanda Seyfried [R] as Linda Lovelace\n\nThough the movie is set in the nostalgic era of sideburns, flower dresses, flares and sexual exploration, 'Lovelace' is a grimy film about the 'Deep Throat' star who became a battered, broken woman at the hands of a monster of a man.\n\nContinue reading: Lovelace: First Look At Amanda Seyfried As Linda Lovelace [Trailer And Pictures]\n\nFirst Trailer For Amanda Seyfried's Linda Lovelace Biopic Raises Expectations\n\nBy Victoria Pavlova in Movies / TV / Theatre on 05 July 2013\n\nAnticipation mounted, as the first trailer for Lovelace – the Deep Throat star’s biopic, starring Amanda Seyfried, was released yesterday. The film follows the story of Lovelace’s entry into the porn industry and the reasons behind it, as well as her eventual escape from the business and her abusive husband. It tracks the journey from her humble beginnings in the Bronx and her eventual notoriety, as well as the controversy, surrounding her life and career. Lovelace died in a carcrash 2002, after several decades of advocating against the porn industry.\n\nSeyfried will face the challenging role alongside a talented cast.\n\nThe film features a star-studded cast – from Seyfried as Lovelace herself to Peter Sarsgaard as her opportunistic and abusive husband Chuck Traynor. Sharon Stone, Adam Brody, Chris Noth, Chloe Sevigny, Juno Temple and Hank Azaria make appearances in various supporting parts and, of course, where would a 2013 movie be without multi-tasker James Franco.

And according to Seth Rogan, the co-creator of the apocalyptic comedyр in which he and his actor friends star as themselves, it was the best way to end the film. He told Den of Geek: “Honestly, it took us forever. We probably knew in August or September that we needed to fill the new ending, and it took us until January to actually come up with what it should be. It took us forever – months and months and months of just spitballing what it could be. We had to write something.”\n\nContinue reading: Seth Rogan Talks Backstreet Boys Cameo In This Is The End\n\nSeth Rogen Reveals: 'This Is The End' Does Not Use Original Ending\n\nBy Elinor Cosgrave in Movies / TV / Theatre on 19 June 2013\n\nSeth Rogen's comedy This Is The End did not use its intended ending. The script was changed in order to accommodate a cameo from 90's pop stars Backstreet Boys leading a sing-along dance to 'Everybody', their 1997 single.\n\nDirector and co-writer Evan Goldberg said the idea had come from an off-the-cuff suggestion from his wife on how to make the ending more interesting. Seth Rogen, who stars in the comedy, was determined to make the idea a reality.\n\nThe Backstreet Boys cameo was not exactly what the writers had planned as the original ending was meant to feature Morgan Freeman, reviving his role as God as in Bruce Almighty. Unfortunately the actor had no interest in participating in the project. Rogen was then adamant the Backstreet Boys should play a part especially, as he said in an interview with The Vulture, he is \"the appropriate age\" to remember when \"Backstreet Boys were kings\".\n\nThe Backstreet Boys are not the only celebrities to feature in this 'apocalyptic' comedy. In fact the whole film is one cameo appearance after the other. None of the actors are playing characters, merely portraying the public's perception of them.\n\nContinue reading: Seth Rogen Reveals: 'This Is The End' Does Not Use Original Ending\n\nJames Franco Wants $500k For Three Films – Where’s All Your Money?\n\nBy Jack de Aguilar in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 18 June 2013\n\nJames Franco – who was reported to earn $7m from Oz: the Great & Powerful alone – has started an indiegogo campaign to procure half a million dollars to fund three films. He's raising money so that a collection of young filmmakers can adapt his 2011 short story collection, \"Palo Alto.\"\n\n\"Because of who I am, people often believe that it is easy to find investors and distributors for my films,\" Franco wrote on the crowdsourcing platform. \"Unfortunately, things aren't that easy. More times than not, I have put in my own money to produce my films and my student's films. However, this time it's different; We need more funding, I will still fund part of it but I need of your help, filming three feature films back-to-back requires more funding than I can give.\"\n\nLike Franco, Zach Braff has opted to get funding from the public and the Veronica Mars film also used this technique, but the aforementioned celebs have been ridiculed and criticised for using a form of funding usually utilised by those without the money to engage in creative projects themselves, especially considering how much these actors make per film.\n\nContinue reading: James Franco Wants $500k For Three Films – Where’s All Your Money?\n\nYou Should See 'This Is The End' And Here's Why\n\nBy Victoria Pavlova on 12 June 2013\n\nWe’ve all wanted to see This Is Then End ever since the very first trailer hit the airwaves, but now it looks like a ticket to the screening of the apocalyptic party movie might be more worth it than we thought. Oh, you thought you were getting a simple-minded comedy with celebrities acting like idiots? Well, it is that too, don’t worry, but surprisingly, This Is The End also takes its place as a skewering satire of celebrity culture – part of a definite trend lately.\n\nWhile, yes, there are more famous faces in the film than at a Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty, what makes this film isn’t the mere presence of so many stars. Instead, the appeal is in the way the hyperbolized versions of famous actors interact with each other. Penned by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen (who also doubles as a member of the apocalypse squad in the movie,) this film sees both writers on top of their game. At the beginning of their career, the creative team set the bar pretty high with the hilarious nerdy romp Superbad. Unfortunately, they then failed to repeat the act with films like Pineapple Express.\n\nContinue reading: You Should See 'This Is The End' And Here's Why\n\nAmanda Seyfried Wants Her 'Beautiful, Huge Breasts' Back!\n\nBy Michael West in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 24 May 2013\n\nLes Miserables actress Amanda Seyfried says she lost her \"beautiful, huge breasts\" after moving to Hollywood to pursue a career in movies. The 27-year-old - who plays Linda Lovelace in a forthcoming biopic - called in on the Ellen Degeneres show this week to discuss her beginnings.\n\n\"I looked way better when I was 15. I had beautiful, huge breasts!\" the actress explained, \"And then I came to Hollywood and I was like I gotta lose weight. I gotta look thin. I gotta get fit. And I lost them a little bit.\" It seems she lost more than \"a little bit,\" telling DeGeneres she was an D cup though that she doesn't miss them, \"...because they were ... uncomfortable.\"\n\nDespite her own decisions, Seyfried warned, \"I was feminine. I had some nice curves. And I think we should appreciate that instead of trying to get rid of everything.\"\n\nContinue reading: Amanda Seyfried Wants Her 'Beautiful, Huge Breasts' Back!\n\nA Week In Movies: Cannes Film Festival Kicks Off, Coen Brothers' & James Franco Are Potential Award Winners, Michael Douglas Portrays Liberace In Behind The Candelabra And Much More!\n\nBy Staff Writer in Movies / TV / Theatre on 17 May 2013\n\nThe 66th Cannes Film Festival kicked off this week with the glittering red carpet premiere of The Great Gatsby, attended by filmmaker Bas Luhrmann and cast members Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton and Isla Fisher. The film opened in America last Friday and in the UK this Thursday.\n\nMulligan also stars in another film in competition at Cannes: the Coen brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis is the story of a folk singer (Oscar Isaac) in 1960s New York. The eclectic, starry cast includes Justin Timberlake, Garrett Hedlund and John Goodman. And to go with the Cannes world premiere, the film launched its first trailer this week. It looks pretty unmissable, and is being released to target awards season.\n\nContinue reading: A Week In Movies: Cannes Film Festival Kicks Off, Coen Brothers' & James Franco Are Potential Award Winners, Michael Douglas Portrays Liberace In Behind The Candelabra And Much More!\n\nJames Franco Takes On Faulkner In 'As I Lay Dying' [Trailer & Pictures]\n\nBy Michael West in Movies / TV / Theatre on 17 May 2013\n\nJim Parrack & James Franco in As I Lay Dying\n\nAs I Lay Dying, written, directed and starring James Franco, is aiming to become the first American movie to win the Un Certain Regard award at the Cannes Film Festival since 2008's Tyson documentary. Franco's movie is adapted from William Faulkner's classic American novel of the same name and stars the Oscar nominee as a son's quest to bury the body of his mother in accordance with her wishes.\n\nWatch the As I Lay Dying Trailer!\n\nThough the trailer hints at Franco's penchant for the avant-garde, it looks far more of a straight narrative affair then, say, Interior. Leather Bar. Franco plays the second oldest child Darl, while Tim Blake Nelson appears to do a sublime job of portraying father Anse. Danny McBride plays friend of the family Vernon Tull while Ahna O'Reilly - who's making a buzz with the Weinstein's Fruitvale - plays daughter Dewey Dell. The movie has a reasonable chance of scooping for 30,000 euro prize at Cannes, though it's safe to assume festival favorite Sofia Coppola is the frontrunner with hipster tale The Bling Ring - still, it would be a long-awaited American success.\n\nContinue reading: James Franco Takes On Faulkner In 'As I Lay Dying' [Trailer & Pictures]\n\nJames Franco Takes On William Faulkner, The World Is Divided\n\nBy Victoria Pavlova in Movies / TV / Theatre on 15 May 2013\n\nBesides the obvious fact that there’s money in making literary adaptations, James Franco’s take on Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying is obviously motivated by something else as well. The recently released trailer for the film, which will be featured in the Un Certain Regard section at Cannes, definitely doesn’t present it in a blockbuster light.\n\nInstead, the main point of the trailer seems to be to show us that yes, James Franco read the book, he understood it and now he’s going to prove to everyone what a good director he can be. Which is as admirable a goal as any, to be sure, but whether it will make for a good movie is another matter entirely.\n\nOf course, critics are weary of adaptations of great American classics right now, with The Great Gatsby controversy still fresh in everyone’s mind (that controversy being that some people liked it and some people didn’t, despite the very promising trailer). So, who knows? After the success of Spring Breakers, this may in fact turn out to be Franco’s year and As I Lay Dying, his breakout directorial gig. Or it may be a complete flop. In any case, it won’t affect Faulkner or his novel in the slightest, so everyone might as well stop getting so hung up about it and give the film a chance. From the trailer alone it does look very promising.\n\nContinue reading: James Franco Takes On William Faulkner, The World Is Divided\n\nJames Franco's 'As I Lay Dying' Packs A Punch [Trailer]\n\nBy Michael West in Movies / TV / Theatre on 15 May 2013\n\nAs I Lay Dying - which competes for the Un Certain Regard award at the Cannes Film Festival this month - is very much James Franco's baby. The 35-year-old Oscar nominee wrote, directed and stars in the movie adapted from William Faulkner's classic American novel of the same name.\n\nThough the trailer hints at Franco's penchant for the surreal and avant-garde, it looks a far more straight laced movie than his previous stints behind the camera. The movie tells the story of Addie Bundren's death and her impoverished family's subsequent quest to bury the body in accordance with her wishes. Franco plays the second oldest child Darl, while Tim Blake Nelson appears to do a sublime job of portraying father Anse. Danny McBride plays friend of the family Vernon Tull while Fruitvale's Anha O'Reilly plays daughter Dewey Dell.\n\nContinue reading: James Franco's 'As I Lay Dying' Packs A Punch [Trailer]\n\nJames Franco Gucci Documentary: The Director Has A Trailer [Video]\n\nBy Jack de Aguilar in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 22 April 2013\n\nJames Franco can do it all. He’s an actor (an Oscar nominated one), he’s got loads of degrees, and he’s studying for a Ph.D In English from Yale. Add documentary filmmaker and producer to that, too.\n\n\"The idea of the documentary was really born out of a provocation,\" said Giannini. \"James Franco and I were asked to interview each other for a special magazine feature and when I asked him, 'What's your next project?' he replied, 'to make a documentary about you.' I actually thought it was his dry sense of humour at play, but then somehow the provocation became a reality.\" The film, which follows Gucci's creative director Frida Giannini, premiered on April 21 as part of the Tribeca Film Festival in New York.\n\nContinue reading: James Franco Gucci Documentary: The Director Has A Trailer [Video]\n\nVideo - James Franco Appears On The Red Carpet At The Tribeca Premiere For 'The Director'\n\n'127 Hours' star James Franco makes an appearance at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival premiere of 'The Director: An Evolution in Three Acts' in New York.\n\nContinue: Video - James Franco Appears On The Red Carpet At The Tribeca Premiere For 'The Director'\n\nLetterman Banned Guest Harmony Korine For Stealing From Meryl Streep\n\nBy Michael West in Movies / TV / Theatre on 27 March 2013\n\nDavid Letterman banned guest Harmony Korine from the Late Show after he found the Spring Breakers director rifling through the purse of Meryl Streep. Letterman told the story on Monday (March 25, 2013) when prompted by guest James Franco, the star of Korine' latest movie.\n\nThe actor said he heard Korine was banned after pushing Meryl Steep backstage, though defended his director, saying, \"Harmony is a very sane guy now -- a great artist and great person to work with. But I think he had a period where he was going a little off the rails, so maybe he was on something that night.\n\nLetterman proceeded to correct Franco on the incident, saying, \"I went upstairs to greet Meryl Streep and welcome her to the show, and I knock on the door ... and she was not in there.And I looked around, and she was not in there, and I found Harmony going through her purse. True story. And so I said: 'That's it.

The popping color palette and at times seizure-inducing editing might put some more serious movie-goers of this, but it certainly does a lot to entice the target audience – which, for this visual romp would be bored teens and twenty-somethings. But don’t be fooled – beyond the bikinis and hot pink tones, Spring Breakers, which premiered last week at SXSW does have some substance as well. Ok, a little substance. But still.\n\nFirstly, let’s talk about Disney actresses playing girls gone wild. Well, it’s fun and, let’s be honest – it’s a much healthier way for ladies like Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez to break out of the Disney mould than, say leaking nude pictures online. And, to be fair, Gomez does show remarkable depth of character – well, as much as the Spring Breakers script will allow anyway.\n\nContinue reading: Spring Breakers Wide Release - Is This One Worth Seeing?\n\nIs Record Breaking 'Spring Breakers' A Cult Movie In The Making?\n\nBy Michael West in Movies / TV / Theatre on 18 March 2013\n\nThough 'Oz: The Great and Powerful' dominated the box office for a second consecutive week - pulling In $42 million to take its takings to $282 million - it was another of James Franco's movies that performed the strongest. Harmony Korine's debauched drama 'Spring Breakers' pulled in just $270,000, though it did so from just three theaters, easily the best per-theater average of the weekend with $90,000. Oz averaged just $11,000 per theater.\n\nThe new movie is now likely to roll out across more theaters and should turn a profit for Muse Productions and A24, the tiny companies behind the film. It stars Franco as a thuggish drug dealer who charms college girls Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens into a world of crime, sex and violence. It looks to be Korine's biggest hit to date and represents Gomez and Hudgens' first serious roles outside of their Disney work - the former is best known for Wizards of Waverly Place while Hudgens found fame with High School Musical.\n\nSo far, critical reception has been strong too, with Spring Breakers earning a solid 70% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The New York Times said, \"[Korine] turns his exploration into such a gonzo, outrageously funny party that it takes a while to appreciate that this is more of a horror film than a comedy,\" while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine wrote, \"Spring Breakers, beach-party fluff done as an art film by the reliably bizarre Harmony Korine, is a return to form for Franco.\"\n\nContinue reading: Is Record Breaking 'Spring Breakers' A Cult Movie In The Making?\n\nSelena Gomez Brings 'Spring Breakers' Premiere To SXSW\n\nBy Michael West in Movies / TV / Theatre on 12 March 2013\n\nHarmony Korine's new movie 'Spring Breakers' premiered at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, on Sunday (March 10, 2013) with its stars Selena Gomez, James Franco and Ashley Benson turning out for the screening. The movie follows four friends, (Benson, Gomez, Rachel Korine and Vanessa Hudgens) as they rob a bank to pay for their spring break trip, though get thrown in jail before being bailed out by a drug dealer, played by Franco.\n\nThe movie premiered at the Austin Convention Center, with Gomez showing off an elegant looking Cushine et Ochs frock. The dress featured cut-out detailing at the shoulders and across the midriff - Gomez certainly showed her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber what he was missing. The sexual and violent themes in 'Spring Breakers' are certainly a departure from Gomez's usual Disney movies, though speaking to FlavorWire at SXSW, director Korine said he isn't too concerned with analysis of his films. \"It's funny for me to listen to it,\" he said, adding, \"But I don't really have that much to do with that part of things, I don't have a relationship with that type of analysis. I usually make the movies, and I put them together, and I put them out into the world and then I just go home and cut off as much as possible from all that.\"\n\nSpring Breakers runs this week at SXSW and opens Friday (March 15, 2013) on limited release. The movie receives a nationwide opening on March 22. Watch the Spring Breakers below.\n\nContinue reading: Selena Gomez Brings 'Spring Breakers' Premiere To SXSW\n\nJames Franco - Interview\n\nAt 34, James Franco is almost ludicrously overqualified for anything he sets his hands to. He has several university degrees, has written short stories, novels and poetry, and has written and directed award-winning films. As an actor, he's was Oscar-nominated for 127 Hours and continues to surprise audiences with his eclectic choices, from the Spider-man trilogy to Milk to playing a rapper-gangster in Harmony Korine's arthouse romp Spring Breakers. And in early 2013 he has nine films in various stages of production. So seeing him turn up as the title character in the family friendly Oz the Great and Powerful was a bit of a surprise...\n\nWhy did you decide to make this film? The Wizard of Oz is a tough act to follow.\n\nFirst of all, I heard Sam [Raimi] was directing this movie. I did the three Spider-man films with him, and I've known him over 10 years. Not only is he one of my favourite directors to work with, but I'm a fan of his films. So I jumped at the opportunity to do this. I've also been a fan of the world of Oz since I was a boy. I read all the L Frank Baum books when I was a kid, so I was excited because I'd be able to step into that world of my childhood imagination. And when I read the script I saw that they were going to be loyal and respectful of everything we lovers of Oz expect, and that there would be familiar things that you need for it to be the land of Oz.\n\nWhat kinds of familiar things?\n\nYou need the yellow brick road and the Emerald City and witches, flying monkeys and Munchkins. But now it's 70-plus years later and they'd be able to capture this world in a much more spectacular and seamless way. They didn't need to rely on theatrical conventions like men in lion pyjamas with the faces cut out; they could create these magical creatures in ways that are believable to the eye.\n\nContinue reading: James Franco - Interview\n\nAshley Benson Is Working Towards An Oscar But Already Criticised For Publicising Inappropriate Movie To Teens\n\nBy Lorna Greville in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 07 March 2013\n\nAshley Benson is co-starring in a new movie alongside Selena Gomez and James Franco called Spring Breakers. It's a raunchy comedy-drama filled with sex and drugs, including a threesome scene between the characters played by Benson, Gomez and Franco. With such salacious material as the focus of the film why is she promoting it in teen magazine 'Seventeen' which is predominantly aimed at those aged 12 and upwards? That is the question being asked by some people.\n\nSpeaking to Fox411 body image expert Sarah Maria said: \"It is not just inappropriate for Benson to be on the cover of Seventeen, it is ludicrous. The girls reading Seventeen are 13 and 14 years old, and they are learning about an actress whose most recent film includes a threesome sex scene? That is awful.\"\n\n\"We all came from a Disney background, and this was different from anything we've done. But we wanted to prove that we're not just girls who play happy parts,\" Benson explained in her interview with the magazine according to the Daily Mail. \"It was such a crazy experience and it was character-building. I'm so proud of all of us. I'm really, really excited for everybody to see it.\"\n\nContinue reading: Ashley Benson Is Working Towards An Oscar But Already Criticised For Publicising Inappropriate Movie To Teens\n\nJames Franco On Oz The Great & Powerful And Justin Bieber\n\nBy Jack de Aguilar in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 07 March 2013\n\nJames Franco stars in Oz the Great & Powerful - released tomorrow - and he’s been chatting about playing the titular character, and mimicking Justin Bieber in a recent interview.\n\nFranco says he identifies with the character of Oz – full name Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs – because of his goals and ideals in life. “He dreams about becoming great, becoming recognised, and when I was younger those were things I dreamed about too,” explained Franco to The Telegraph. “My parents weren’t happy; they wouldn’t pay my rent any more so I worked at McDonald’s.” The 127 Hours Star also opened up on his spoof of Justin Bieber’s song Boyfriend, after it appeared as though the bratty teen star wasn’t happy with his portrayal. “To me that wasn’t a criticism of Bieber as such, it was just having fun and reflecting a bit of pop culture,” explained Franco. “The thing is, when I do something like that, the response is very positive, people say ‘He did Bieber, that’s genius’, but if I do something that has the slightest bit of pretension or inclination towards something deeper, people just go crazy. It drives them cr-aaaaaaaa-zy that an actor would dare write a poem or a book or make a piece of art.”\n\nContinue reading: James Franco On Oz The Great & Powerful And Justin Bieber\n\nBestiality, Fine. Gays? No Thanks: James Franco Slams Australia Over Movie Ban\n\nBy Michael West in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 05 March 2013\n\nJames Franco has slammed Australia's film board for banning Travis Mathew's gay-themed film 'I Want Your Love.' The movie star dubbed the organization \"hypocritical\" for shunning the movie, the story of a gay man who has sex with his best friend during his last night in Los Angeles. Franco has previously collaborated with filmmaker Mathews on Interior.Leather.Bar, a reimagining of 40 minutes of scenes deleted from William Friedkin's 1980 film Cruising.\n\nThe Australian government-sponsored film board has banned the screening of I Want Your Love at two gay-themed festivals in the country, the Melbourne Queer Film Festival and the Brisbane Queer Film Festival, citing the sex scenes between the men as indecent.\n\nContinue reading: Bestiality, Fine. Gays? No Thanks: James Franco Slams Australia Over Movie Ban\n\nSelena Gomez Wasn't Fazed By Spring Breakers Bikinis\n\nBy Michael West in Movies / TV / Theatre on 15 February 2013\n\nSelena Gomez says she wasn't fazed by her outfits in the forthcoming movie Spring Breakers and was simply \"playing a character.\" Gomez and co-star Vanessa Hudgens wore bikinis for almost the entirety of the indie flick, though Justin Bieber's former squeeze says it was all part of the experience.\n\n\"It was so funny. The rest of the girls were in the trailer doing crunches. I didn't mind. I didn't care,\" she told MTV News, \"People take pictures. People already have opinions. I wasn't there for that, necessarily. I was playing a character, so I just completely indulged myself in that. So whether I was in a bathing suit or a turtleneck, I was fine.\" The minimal wardrobe choices for the movie have been a prominent talking point since the trailer for the movie - also starring James Franco - hit the web. The adult themes in Harmony Korine's latest movie - which was shortlisted for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival - is a new direction for Gomez, who warned her younger fans to sit this one out. \"I do everything for my fans. I know that I have a younger following, and I so appreciate that, and I'm thankful for that, but I did warn them in my best ability, as I could,\" she said. \"When I see the parents, I go, 'Maybe they don't see this one'.\"\n\nSpring Breakers opens in New York and Los Angeles on March 15 before expanding nationwide on March 22, 2013.\n\nContinue reading: Selena Gomez Wasn't Fazed By Spring Breakers Bikinis\n\nSpring Breakers Breaks Selena Gomez Out Of Disney Bubble\n\nBy Lorna Greville in Movies / TV / Theatre on 08 February 2013\n\nYou've got to get out of the Disney castle some time, and there's no use sneaking out the back door. As Britney Spears did before her (in a school girls uniform, singing 'hit me baby, one more time'), Selena Gomez has bust right outta there with seemingly no holds barred, as she opts for Spring Breakers to be her first major non-Disney pursuit. New posters for the movie see her clad in a tiny blue bikini, an image which is a far cry from the innocence of her Disney days.\n\nIt's not just the poster image that wont be accessible for Gomez's young fans, the premise of the movie is for a distinctly older audience as well. Gomez plays one of four best friends who live together at college. Without enough money to go on vacation, they rob a restaurant to fund their trip to Florida. When they get there they're arrested on drugs charges, but a drug dealer (James Franco) bails them out. His help doesn't come for free though and he expects them to pay him back one way or another.\n\nAnother poster in the series features Franco who is almost unrecognisable, with cornrows, tattoos, shades and a gun shoved in his jeans. Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Rachel Korine also star. Directed by film maker Harmony Korine, who is best known for Kids and Mister Lonely. Spring Breakers is set for release March 8th.
