        "text": "oh_franco... james franco RPF community has been created :D\n\nIt's been set up by the wonderful kuihtuma who actually has some spine initiative!!! I shall now harbor quixotic hopes that given a venue to post, stuff will automatically and promptly start to be written, but yes, emphasis on QUIXOTIC.\n\nThe only franco RPF I've read is him with Zac Efron, which does have some RL basis thanks to Gus Van Sant's and Dustin Lance Black's obsession with him. I still don't quite get Teh Zefron, but I haven't watched 17 Again and I also think I'm biased against liking any actors who are younger than I am (I should really change this, because this narrows down my pool significantly and it will only get worse with time) :/\n\nAnyway, rogen/franco is my OTP, by far, but I am promiscuous and will read anything with franco, I admit :X\n\nSince I'm not holding out much hope for reams of franco RPF to ever be written, here I will list some ideas that will probably never come to fruition but are fun anyway.\n\nI KNOW FAR TOO MUCH ABOUT HIS LIFE, I REALIZE NOW. >___<\n\nAlso, requisite disclaimer: None of this is real, his real girlfriend is Ahna O'Reilly, they are Happy Together (c), yada yada yada. No libel intended, just shits and giggles.\n\n***THE GUY PAIRINGS, RPSSSSSSSSSS***\n\nCarter/Franco\n\nMy second favorite pairing. Carter seems reclusive and weird and media attention shy-- as in, he wouldn't even reveal his first name (it's John), although he's very out of the closet, strange combination-- and yet he really, really has a crush on JF, it is so blatant. I want JF to be loved and adored, not just used as a career ladder, *COUGH*. Carter has such affectionate body language towards him, and JF seems happy with him, if a little wary of triggerhappy people like me labelling them GAYYY TOGETHER!!!1 I don't think I get the art they've made:\n\nbut I find the idea of two people in love working together on projects so appealing.\n\nHOW IT GOES DOWN: Carter films JF doing the non-acting, then films him jerking off (artistically of course!), then films himself giving JF a massssterful blowjob. Bonus points if he also makes a cast of JF's peen, not just his legs. Bonus bonus if Carter sells peen casts to discerning discreet clients.\n\nVince Jolivette/Franco\n\nthey've been, um, \"friends\" since forever, since before JF did Freaks & Geeks, if I'm not mistaken. Jolivette has this too-cool-for-you air, and screams STR8 to me, and JF and he started a company together and vainly star in those independent films together. Jolivette is significantly older and still not married, and they're together precisely when they think paps will not be around (like private parties and walking home late) and they're living together as um, roommates, in NYC. So just for all the fodder, I like it, but then again I don't like what he brings out in Franco's personality. He amplifies douchiness or something, synergistically.\n\nHOW IT GOES DOWN: They live together and jerk each other off oh-so-manly-ly. Also go swimming in pools together and doing other Manly Things like filming movies.\n\nSean Penn/Franco\n\nNot a big fan of Sean Penn, but srsly, after all the jokes on the talkshow circuit about how sean penn asked for more love scenes, and sean penn thought JF's fake huge dong was the real thing, and sean penn texting madonna after kissing JF, and them planning to live together for a night to \"prepare\" (just how method are they?)... it's only natural.\n\nHOW IT GOES DOWN: They rent that apartment for a night like they planned before starting shooting on the sex scene in Milk, and then it's boring and awkward and Sean Penn tries to cook dinner and JF is bored but swallows his yawns and then they very methodically have sex, sans condom because that's not authentic says Penn and JF nods very Knowingly and Maturely, and then they sit at the kitchen table discussing how this was very enlightening and nodding along to each other's inanities, mostly sean penn's because he's more seasoned.\n\nTyrese Gibson/Franco\n\nAHAHAHAHA I really like this idea. They had a major falling out on the set of Annapolis, it was a feud of epic proportions apparently. Lol. In my alternate universe of Plentiful Ghey, this was because they tried to (or one of them tried to, ouch) get together, and IT. DID. NOT. WORK. OUT. My wtflolol rps pairing. Actually, I really want to read this now that I've summarized it! Maybe I should actually watch this movie at some point?... eh.\n\nHOW IT GOES DOWN: Ahahaha, maybe JF comes on a little strong and tyrese is all wtf!! why do you think im gay!! and JF starts retorting that No, he meant nothing by it, and tyrese MUST be gay if his mind went there, and they get into a yelling match and then they physically fight (they really did get into a physical fight on the set apparently lololol). Bonus points if tyrese \"accidentally\" rapes franco while pinning him down and then they both part ways, furious.\n\n***THE GIRL PAIRINGS, RP...H?***\n\nFranco/Marla Sokoloff\n\nhis girlfriend from 1999 to 2004-5. Blind items imply she left him when she found out he was getting it on with guys. Apparently ruined one of the paintings he gave her in a temper tantrum. Costarred with him in Whatever It Takes wherein the movie ends with a ridiculous embarrassing abortive bondage sex scene. I thought they were cute together, personally.\n\nHOW IT GOES DOWN: Marla was always a little concerned about how much JF liked her vibe up his ass while they would fuck (she eventually just gave it over to him). It wasn't fun when he stopped putting a condom over it and it got lost up his colon for a while. Not that they could call into the hospital, him starting to be Famous and all, so there was just a lot of fretting and wringing of hands in the bathroom and Marla watching Franco trying to fish it out. By the time they get it out, the batteries are almost dead.\n\nFranco/Natalie Portman\n\nJF said how he'd be more nervous kissing Nats than Sean Penn, prompting ridicule that he's OBVIOUSLY IN THE CLOSET, but for once I'm going to go with the hetero interpretation and go with \"he just accidentally blurted out his celebrity crush\". I would love to see them together. POWER COUPLE!! I mean, she is gorgeous, wow. Even JF is not as pretty, haha. And I feel like there's something similar in their faces for some reason (see pics). She's gritty enough that she could take his weird douchiness. And they're going to be costarring in the upcoming Your Highness, even though I think she's Danny McBride's love interest? I'd love if they fought over her in the story.\n\nHOW IT GOES DOWN: JF hooks up with Natalie in his trailer and there's lots of pussyworship and he tries to engage her in conversation about english lit because she went to Haaavard and he's at an Ivy now too! But Natalie just cuts him down with her cool penetrating gaze and he shuts up and has absolutely vanilla sex for once.\n\nFranco/Ahna O'Reilly\n\nHis current gf. Eh, grudgingly, I will read this. She just doesn't seem that interesting to me. I'm not wont to label significant others beards, but in her case, he pretty much abandons her on the red carpet and is PDAing only when there are cameras POINTED STRAIGHT AT THEM. Surreptitious PDA >>> staged PDA. She's neither a famous, good actress, nor an interesting person outside the industry, she's just one of these trying-to-forge-a-career young things with (Fake!!! i realized recently) blond hair, and is the perfect height to make JF look taller, and is always available for premieres and Harvard stupid ceremonies, and probably overlooks all teh ghey. I'm not fond of her, in case that wasn't clear. I LIKE HIM WITH INTELLIGENT LOOKING JEWISH BRUNETTES, WHAT CAN I SAY, PERHAPS THIS IS TRANSPARENT MARYSEWAGE BUT I LIKE WHAT I LIKE. >:[\n\nHOW IT GOES DOWN: JF calls Ahna to ask if she could please attend the Golden Globes with him in a few days? and she points out she hasn't even heard from him in weeks now, and he comes over and studiously fucks her, asks her if she's getting gigs, stays the night, makes a 16 cup pot of coffee that she keeps on hand only for him, drinks more than two thirds of it, takes a shower with her, gives her good oral sex +1, pees into the drain instead of getting out and going in the toilet -1, and skedaddles after he's blown his hair dry."
