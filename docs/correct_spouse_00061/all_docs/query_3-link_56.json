        "text": "“Glee: The 3D Concert Movie” PG — Teen and younger fans of the hit TV show “Glee,” about talented glee club kids who feel, and are treated, like outsiders in their own high school, will probably have great fun at this pretty ordinary concert film. It was shot this summer during part of the “Glee Live! In Concert!” tour at the IZOD Center in New Jersey.\n\nMade rather pointlessly in 3-D, it showcases favorite show characters, among them Finn (Cory Monteith), Brittany (Heather Morris), Puck (Mark Salling), Rachel (Lea Michele), Mercedes (Amber Riley) and Artie (Kevin McHale) singing songs from the show, such as “Raise Your Glass,” “Don’t Stop Believin’ ” and, of course, Rachel belting the Barbra Streisand hit “Don’t Rain On My Parade.”\n\nAs with many concert films, many of the lyrics get drowned out by the glitz and screaming fans. What makes “Glee: The 3D Concert Movie” special is not the Glee stars, who even play their characters in backstage scenes, but interviews with several “Gleeks” — fans of the show who claim it gave them courage to be themselves. That could be a stand-alone movie one day.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: The film stays mostly in PG territory, but occasionally veers toward PG-13. One number features leather-and-feather costumes clearly inspired by sadomasochistic chic. Some dance moves, including crotch-grabbing, are quite suggestive. The fans interviewed for the concert film talk about, among other things, being gay and harassed in middle school, and about having Asperger’s syndrome.\n\n“The Help” PG-13 — Teens who like full-blooded characters — lots of them — and tales rich in bygone-era atmosphere will be fully engaged in “The Help,” even if they haven’t read Kathryn Stockett’s popular 2009 novel. Since it takes place in Mississippi in the early 1960s and deals with race, segregation and the civil rights movement, they’ll get a vivid glimpse of that day and age.\n\nRefreshingly unfussy and terrifically acted, the film carries you along easily for more than two-and-a-quarter hours. The first person we meet is Aibileen Clark (wonderful Viola Davis), an African-American domestic in Jackson, Miss., telling the story of her life to a person we can’t see.\n\nLater we realize it is a young white woman, Eugenia “Skeeter” Phelan (Emma Stone), the only girl in her clubby crowd who has gone to college and developed skepticism toward the racial attitudes she grew up with. Skeeter wants to be a writer and, after witnessing some fraught interactions between her married friends and their maids, decides to interview the maids in secret and publish their story.\n\nIt takes a while before Aibileen and her cranky best friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) decide it’s OK to talk to Skeeter. The young women they work for — depressed new mother Elizabeth Leefolt (Ahna O’Reilly) and scheming Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) — don’t stand for nontraditional behavior. Only the rich young wife, Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain), deemed “white trash” by Skeeter’s friends, has a kind heart.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: Most of the PG-13-ish aspects of “The Help” involve the use of the N-word by 1960s white Mississippians, and the weight of racism and segregation, as African-American maids hear employers talk about not letting “the help” use the same toilets they use. Other elements involve a character having a miscarriage, showing a blood-stained bathroom. It’s strongly implied that Minny’s husband beats her. The script features midrange profanity and use of the S-word involving a pie ingredient used to deliver comeuppance. Characters smoke and drink.\n\n“Rise of the Planet of the Apes” PG-13 — High-school science-fiction buffs will likely be hooked by this clever, if not transcendent prequel to the original “Planet of the Apes” (G, 1968) and all its progeny. The use of “motion-capture” technology allows the chimps and gorillas to seem as full-blooded as human characters — the result of computer animation overlaid on human performances. So the violence and mayhem may seem too real and heavy-duty for middle-schoolers.\n\nJames Franco plays Will, a brilliant researcher who develops an anti-Alzheimer’s drug with a viral component. Tested on apes, it causes them to become dangerously violent, so the project is shut down. Will keeps giving the drug to his father (John Lithgow), who has Alzheimer’s. He also takes in a baby chimp from the lab, Caesar, who was exposed to the drug. Caesar grows up (now played by Andy Serkis) superintelligent.\n\nAfter Caesar acts violently toward someone, Will is forced to put him into a “sanctuary” that turns out be a kind of prison supplying apes for research. A handler (Tom Felton) mistreats him, and Caesar, fed up, foments a primate revolution. His ape army escapes, faces down police, guns, horses, helicopters and more. They will rule — that’s what you get for messing with genetics and viruses and hurting animals, warns the movie.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: Pushing the PG-13 rating to its limit, there are scenes of violence against animals and between humans and animals that are intensely upsetting and probably too much for some middle-schoolers. Such moments occur early in the film in brief sequences, but by the end there is widespread mayhem. Though the encounters and the wounds are not graphic, there is blood and death on both sides and weapons include electric prods, iron fence spikes, tranquilizer darts and guns.\n\n“Crazy, Stupid, Love.” — Adults and adolescents make fools of themselves for love in this earnest but uneven and eventually rather tedious multigenerational comedy. It is not for middle-schoolers, or even some high-schoolers younger than 16, and barely qualifies as a PG-13, even by that near-useless rating’s ever-loosening standards. Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) goes into deep mourning when his wife, Emily (Julianne Moore), tells him she has had a dalliance with a man (Kevin Bacon) at work and wants a divorce. Cal moves out. His and Emily’s 13-year-old son (Jonah Bobo) is in love with the 17-year-old baby sitter (Analeigh Tipton), who catches the boy masturbating. Undeterred, he declares his love to the sitter, but she’s in love with Cal.\n\nIn the bar where Cal drowns his sorrows, he meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a preening playboy who decides to teach the 40-something guy how to dress and chat up women. Then Jacob meets his own match in Hannah (Emma Stone). All these threads weave together, but the finale isn’t quite worth the trip. Older teens should check out “Love, Actually” (R, 2003), which said it better."
