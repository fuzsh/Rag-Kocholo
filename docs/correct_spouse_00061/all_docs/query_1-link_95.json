        "text": "James Franco somehow found time in his busy schedule to add a new lady to his life.\n\nPage Six reports that the 34-year-old actor is dating \"Pretty Little Liars\" star Ashley Benson, 22.\n\nThe couple were spotted wandering around New York City earlier this month, and suspicions the two were an item were confirmed when they were seen holding hands at the Los Angeles Haunted Hayride.\n\n\"They have been seeing each other for a little over a month, but things are going well,\" a source told the paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two met on the set of \"Spring Breakers,\" which they filmed earlier this year in Florida, along with Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens.\n\nFranco has kept himself busy with school and multiple creative projects, but he hasn't made the rounds romantically. In July 2011, the actor and his girlfriend of five years, Ahna O'Reilly, called it quits because she was tired of the amount of time he spent studying at schools all over the country. Franco previously dated actress Marla Sokoloff, whom he met on the set of the movie \"Whatever It Takes,\" from 1999 to 2004."
