        "text": "Los Angeles - James Franco jokingly announced he got married to Lana Del Rey.\n\nThe 36-year-old actor poked fun at rumours he is dating the Young & Beautiful hitmaker on Instagram on Wednesday, as he shared a black and white photograph of them together.\n\nThe This Is the End star captioned the image: \"Oh snap, we got married. JUST KIDDING!!!\"\n\nLana, 29, fuelled speculation she is enjoying a new romance with the heartthrob after she attended a screening of his movie Child of God in New York City last week, and then joined him for an intimate after party in his room at the Tribeca Grand Hotel.\n\nA source told Us Weekly magazine that James, who was previously linked to Ahna O'Reilly and Erin Johnson, thinks the singer is \"fascinating\" and their friendship is on the cusp of turning romantic.\n\nThe insider added: \"They've been hanging out and talking a lot.\"\n\nLana enjoyed a brief romance with Vogue photographer Francesco Carrozzini after splitting from her boyfriend of three years, Barrie-James O'Neill, in June.\n\nDiscussing her split from the Scottish rocker, she recently admitted: \"Trying to get consistency and normality within the dynamic of that relationship has been impossible. He's unwell and I'm unwell in some ways, and psychologically we've been through a lot together.\""
