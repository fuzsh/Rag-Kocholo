My name's Beatrice, and I am huge James Franco fan..:) I think I can help you figure out your question :)\n\nJames Franco first received worldwide fame when he starred as Peter Parker's best friend in \"Spider-Man\", a role which he reprised in the films' two sequels. He also starred opposite Robert De Niro in \"City By the Sea\" and played a captain in 2005 film \"The Great Raid\".\n\nIn year 2006, James starred in \"Trsitan and isolde\", \"Annapolis\", \"Wicker Man\", \"Flyboys\", \"The Dead Girl\" and \"The Holiday\".\n\nHe also appeared in the comedy film \"Knocked Up\", played Sergeant Dan Carnelli in \"In the Valley Of Death\", played as Andy in the crime-drama film \"An American Crime\" and co-starred in \"Camille\" opposite Sienna Miller in the year 2007.\n\nJames ventured into comedy in 2008 opposite funny man Seth Rogen in the action stoner comedy film \"Pineapple Express\". He also appeared as Richard Gere's son in \"Nights in Rodanthe\". But James' most impressive performance in 2008 is when he played Scott Smith, the gay lover of Harvey Milk in the Gus Van Sant-directed biopic \"Milk\". For that, James won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male.\n\nCome 2010 and James was cast in more wonderful movies. He appeared in the comedy film \"Date Night\" and played David in \"Eat Pray Love\" starring Julia Roberts. He played another gay character in the experimental film \"Howl\". But before 2010 ended, James was seen in his most critically-acclaimed role to date. He starred in the Danny Boyle-directed biopic \"127 Hours\" where he played the real life mountaineer Aron Ralston trapped in a canyon for a couple of days. His performance in the film earned critical praise, and was even hailed by some critics as the best film James Franco has ever done. Adding to the glory is the fact that he earned his first ever Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in the 83rd Academy Award but lost to Colin Firth for \"The King's Speech\".\n\nThis 2011, James was last seen in comedy film \"Your Highness\" and had a cameo role in \"The Green Hornet\".\n\nHe will soon be seen in his upcoming films \"Rise of the Apes\" and \"In Praise of Shadows\", which are both currently in post-production stage.\n\nBut if you want a complete list of James' filmography, you can check out these references below for more information..Hope these help..:)\n\nhttp://www.fandango.com/jamesfranco/filmography/p299361\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290556/filmoyear\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Franco\n\nhttp://biography.co/james-franco\n\nhttp://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800352352/filmography"
