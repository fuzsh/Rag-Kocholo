        "text": "James Franco allegedly had a relationship with Amber Heard that had Johnny Depp angry. Franco later had high-profile relationships and was caught in a sexual misconduct allegation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmber Heard has recently been the talk of the town, given the controversy surrounding her relationship with Johnny Depp.\n\nNaturally, her past relationships also came to light and resurfaced on social media. One of them is an alleged relationship with actor James Franco, with whom she starred in a film.\n\nJames Franco during the special screening of the final season of \"The Deuce\" at Metrograph on September 05, 2019 in New York City. | Source: Getty Images\n\nWERE AMBER HEARD AND JAMES FRANCO DATING?\n\nIn 2008, Heard and Franco starred in the comedy film \"Pineapple Express\" and reunited in the 2015 crime drama \"The Adderall Diaries.\" At that time, the actress was engaged to Depp, who allegedly suspected them of having an affair.\n\nAccording to Heard, Depp \"was mad at me for taking the job with James Franco. He hated, hated James Franco and was already accusing me of kind of secretly having a thing with him in my past since we had done 'Pineapple Express' together [sic].\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough there isn't much information about their alleged relationship, CCTV footage showed Heard taking Franco to Depp's apartment through a lift after an alleged argument with the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeard may not be a previously confirmed girlfriend, but there have been other women Franco dated. Let's take a deeper look at Franco's other famous romances and relationships.\n\nJAMES FRANCO'S FIRST SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP WAS WITH HIS CO-STAR\n\nOne of Franco's high-profile relationships was with Marla Sokoloff, his first serious girlfriend whom he met on the set of \"Whatever It Takes\" in 2000. The pair lived together for a while until they called it quits in 2004.\n\nYears later, while both had moved on in life, an intimate private video of them was leaked online. Franco described the footage as \"innocent,\" which they made without knowing it would get leaked.\n\nJames Franco during the 'Disaster Artist' panel during Vulture Festival LA Presented by AT&T at Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on November 18, 2017 in Hollywood, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJAMES FRANCO AND AHNA O'REILLY WERE DATING FOR 5 YEARS\n\nIn 2006, Franco started dating Ahna O'Reilly, and they lived together in Los Angeles. With a shared career in acting, the former couple was able to share projects.\n\nO'Reilly is known for appearing in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall,\" \"The Help,\" and â€œFruitvale Station,\" among others.\n\nUnfortunately, their romance ended after five years in 2011 due to misaligned priorities. According to Franco, his commitment to his education became a hindrance. Franco had his education at Yale University, Warren Wilson College, Columbia University, and Brooklyn College.\n\nJames Franco during 'The Disaster Artist' photocall during 65th San Sebastian Film Festival on September 28, 2017 in San Sebastian, Spain. | Source: Getty Images\n\nIS JAMES FRANCO ENGAGED?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough his past relationships did not work out, Franco is in a happier place with his new relationship. Currently, Franco's girlfriend is Isabel Pakzad, whom he started dating in 2017. In 2018, sexual misconduct allegations were made against the actor that could affect their romance.\n\nFranco reportedly reacted when female students did not participate in topless scenes during a film shoot. Another person came forward alleging that Franco forced her to take part in intimate actions.\n\nDespite the allegations, Pakzad chose to stay with her man. The pair tried to keep their romance private, and they have started attending public events.\n\nJames Franco during the 'Child of God' Premiere during the 70th Venice International Film Festival at Sala Grande on August 31, 2013 in Venice, Italy. | Source: Getty Images\n\nIn 2018, they appeared side-by-side at the Golden Globes awards, and in 2019, Franco and Pakzad were spotted being affectionate during the Coachella festival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple is undoubtedly serious about each other. However, they are not yet engaged. \"They really enjoy hanging out with each other,\" a source said. \"They're so lovey-dovey.\"\n\nFollowing the sexual allegations, Franco opened up about his addiction to sex and how it affected his relationships with the people around him. He also revealed that he had previously cheated on his girlfriends before Pakzad."
