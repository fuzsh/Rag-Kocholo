        "text": "Genre-defying James Franco may claim a lot of titles — thespian, Oscar host, student, artist, writer and director (whew!) — but he can scratch one thing off his list: boyfriend. The 33-year-old star disclosed in the August 2011 issue of Playboy that he and his girlfriend of five years, actress Ahna O'Reilly, are no longer an item.\n\nAccording to The Daily News, Franco told Playboy that distance and his exhausting schedule was at the root of the relationship's demise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's over... We'd been living together in L.A. and then came to New York to go school for two years. Then I signed up for more school at Yale. I think that was it for her.\"\n\nThe actor may be newly single, but that doesn't keep him from eyeing other crushes -- on fellow actor Robert Pattinson, no less. In the same interview with Playboy, Franco 'fessed up to having attempted to work with the vampy actor numerous times.\n\nCould a budding on-screen romance between the two male actors be in the works? We can only hope.\n\nThe Planet of the Apes star previously told Out magazine: \"In this history of cinema, there are so many heterosexual love stories. It's so hammered, so done. It's just not that interesting to me. It's more interesting to me to play roles and relationships that haven't been portrayed as often.\""
