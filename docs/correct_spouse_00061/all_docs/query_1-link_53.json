What a special day.\"\n\nAlison is married to Dave Franco, the brother of Ahna's former flame James Franco.\n\nJames and Ahna dated for five years but split in 2011 and he claimed his studies - he was a PhD student in English at Yale University - got in the way of their relationship.\n\nHe said: \"That [relationship] lasted about four or five years. We'd been living together in LA then I came to New York to go to school for two years.\n\n\"Then I signed up for more school at Yale. I think that was it for her.’\n\nHowever, the pair remained close and in 2013 James directed Ahna in a production of 'The Long Shrift' off-Broadway in New York."
