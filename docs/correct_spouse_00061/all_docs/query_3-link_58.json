James Franco took it upon himself to poke fun at recent rumors that he's romantically linked to Lana Del Rey on Wednesday, Aug. 6.\n\nPHOTOS: Unlikely celebrity couples\n\n\"Oh snap, we got married. JUST KIDDING!!!\" the This Is the End actor, 36, captioned a black and white photo of himself standing alongside the \"West Coast\" singer, 29, after reports linked the two together.\n\nAll jokes aside, the two have been spotted out together recently. Del Rey attended a screening of his movie Child of God in NYC on July 30, and then joined the actor and others for an afterparty in Franco's hotel room at the Tribeca Grand, a source tells Us Weekly.\n\nAnother source tells Us that Franco finds the songstress \"fascinating,\" and that \"they've been hanging out and talking a lot.\" As for whether the two are romantic, the source admits, \"It could go there.\"\n\nFranco's previously dated Ahna O'Reilly and has been spotted recently with Erin Johnson while Del Rey's been recently linked to Francesco Carrozzini."
