        "text": "Bio:\n\nJames Franco (born James Edward Franco in Palo Alto, California on April 19, 1978) is an actor, writer, and director in Hollywood. James attended UCLA where he began taking acting classes in an attempt to conquer his shyness. He left UCLA after one year and went on to study at Robert Carnegie’s Playhouse West for 15 months until seriously pursuing his interest in becoming an actor in Hollywood. It wasn’t long before he scored a starring role on Freaks and Geeks, in 1999. However, it was his role in the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean (2001), that caused his fan-base to multiply. Since then, James has appeared in countless films, including Spider-Man (2002), In the Valley of Elah (2007), Pineapple Express (2008), Nights in Rodanthe (2008), and in Milk (2008) which earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nBest Known For:\n\nHis breakthrough starring role on Freaks and Geeks.\n\nPersonal Life:\n\nJames dated actress Ahna O’Reilly for about five years, splitting in 2011. In 2012 he was rumored to be dating actress Ashley Benson, who stars in the hit ABC Family series Pretty Little Liars.\n\nPut on your yarmulke, here comes Chanukah! Yep, it’s that time of year again, when you’ve got Adam Sandler’s parody song on repeat. Here’s the thing — there are a ton of celebs that Adam has left out of his songs, even with four iterations!\n\nYou won’t believe who still hasn’t garnered a mention in Adam Sandler’s famous “Chanukah Song”. Everyone from Adam Levine to Queen Elsa, AKA Idina Menzel, has been featured, but there’s a surprising list of huge celebs who haven’t yet made it into the song. Check them out here, and tell us who you think should be featured in the inevitable “Part 5”!\n\nThe Sundance Film Festival is getting steamy! James Franco and Zachary Quinto brought the heat to snowy Park City, Utah with a sexy make out for ‘The New York Times’ slow motion video. Check out these co-stars get cozy!\n\nLeave it to James Franco, 36, to blur the lines between art and reality with I Am Michael co-star Zachary Quinto, 37. Both actors appeared to embrace their on-screen chemistry at the The Times’ Sundance Film booth. Their lip locking in “Sundance In Slow-Mo” is so good that we think these two could take home a golden popcorn for the famous “MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss”!"
