        "text": "Unsurprisingly, Franco’s own sexuality has become the object of rumor. Last spring, he clarified things somewhat, writing in a magazine article, “I’m gay in my art and straight in my life,” adding coyly, “I’m also gay in my life up to the point of intercourse.” But the line separating art from life can grow porous, as on Franco’s Instagram, where he’s posted numerous homoerotic shots of himself – bare-chested in an exercise room, his arm slung around an oiled-up actor in bikini briefs, or looking buff while getting his nipples shaved in a hotel room. Franco tells me he’s approached Instagram, at times, as “a way of finding out what boundaries are and pressing buttons.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nGossip about his sexuality took a nasty turn in 2008, when Gawker began a series of posts, riffing on a Page Six blind item, postulating that Franco had sexually assaulted a man; the posts repeatedly referred to Franco as a “Gay Rapist.” (The posts’ author has since disavowed them.) “Gawker picked it up, and other sites picked it up, and we said, ‘You know, you should take it down,'” Franco recalls, shifting his weight a bit uncomfortably at the memory. “And Gawker said, ‘Well, if you have a response, we’re happy to print it.’ It felt like, if I do a lawsuit, it’s just gonna give it more attention.” So instead, Franco deviated fascinatingly from the standard celebrity-PR playbook: He posted faux-paparazzi pictures on Instagram featuring him making out with some blurry-faced hunk, and started developing a film project with an artist friend, the working title of which was GR – for gay rapist – in an attempt “to use this false accusation as material,” Franco says. (GR was eventually abandoned, but it did partially inspire his head-spinning General Hospital character, an artist named Franco who may or may not have been a murderer.)\n\n“He doesn’t want to limit himself – you know that saying, ‘The genius is in the choices’? That’s not how he thinks. It’s ‘You choose – watch what you want and see what you think.'”—127 Hours director Danny Boyle\n\nIn this way, Franco protected his privacy by making an elaborate, anarchic pantomime of sacrificing it. Then, as now, little is known about Franco’s private life. He had a girlfriend for “four or five years” – actress Ahna O’Reilly – but “she broke up with me,” Franco says. “There were a lot of reasons, but one was that I was so busy. She was living here, and I moved to New York to go to school, did two years of school, then signed up for more school and she was just like, ‘Dude.’ I realized that, at least right now, it’s hard for me to be in a relationship. I can’t devote the time it deserves – especially with someone like her. She was my love. So for a while I avoided relationships like that.” I ask him if this is a coded way of saying that he has a lot of fun casual sex instead. “Nooo … I don’t want to say that,” he replies. “I just haven’t had that sort of live-in relationship in a long time.”\n\nFranco has said that one upside of the sexuality rumors surrounding him was that they functioned, counterintuitively, as a “shield.” He reiterates this now: “One of the nice things about all that speculation” about whether or not he’s gay, he says, eager to change the subject, “is that it’s a smokescreen” – a means, of sorts, for him to hide out in plain sight."
