        "text": "Often, our commenters will ask whether certain celebrities are gay, and it can be tough for us to answer. While some gay celebrities and gay actors are out and proud, others have remained silent about their sexuality and past relationships, leaving us to dig around for clues about their LGBTQ identity.\n\nSo here’s a handful of celebs that people ask about the most, and our answers based on what we know. Keep in mind: We’re not definitively answering if these celebs are gay or not, we’re just saying whether they’re openly gay. We’re also not trying to out anyone or speculate based on superficial traits.\n\nLet’s get started, shall we?\n\nIs Vin Diesel gay?\n\nNo, Vin Diesel isn’t gay. At least, it doesn’t seem so. While the action film star is notoriously private about his personal life, it doesn’t seem like he’s gay. Diesel is married to a woman and has three kids. He has dated bisexual actress Michelle Rodriguez in the past, though. So, sadly, we can’t include him on a list of gay celebrities, even though he is very hunky.\n\nHow about we take this to the next level?\n\nOur newsletter is like a refreshing cocktail (or mocktail) of LGBTQ+ entertainment and pop culture, served up with a side of eye-candy.\n\nDaily\n\n*\n\nWeekly\n\n*\n\nIs Kevin Spacey gay?\n\nYes, Kevin Spacey is gay, and he probably had the worst coming out ever. Following decades of speculation about his sexual orientation, the former House of Cards actor came out as gay on October 2017 while apologizing for drunkenly trying to seduce gay actor Anthony Rapp in 1986 when Rapp was 14 years old and Spacey was 26. Ick.\n\nGay celebrities, gay actors and others quickly criticized Spacey for linking his homosexuality to chicken-hawking. As such, he is one of the most problematic LGBTQ celebrities on this list.\n\nIs Tyler the Creator gay?\n\nNo, Tyler the Creator isn’t publicly out as gay, but it makes sense why people might be confused about whether he’s gay or not.\n\nWhile the rapper has gotten in trouble for using anti-gay slurs 200 times in his debut album, he has since suggested that he might be gay. He publicly stated in an August 2017 interview that he once had a boyfriend when he was 15 years old, but days later he said he was actually single at the time. One of his song’s lyrics also states, “I been kissing white boys since 2004.”\n\nThere isn’t enough info to include him on any list of LGBTQ or gay celebrities, but make of his past what you will.\n\nIs Roxane Gay gay?\n\nYes, Roxane Gay is actually bisexual (despite her last name). The Haitian-American author initially came out as a lesbian, even though she knew she was bisexual. She explained that her own sexuality frightened her and she thought her attraction to men might die away once she began sleeping with women. However, it apparently didn’t.\n\nIs John Travolta gay?\n\nNo, John Travolta has never publicly come out as gay, though gay rumors and accusations have long followed the American actor. In 1991, he married actress Marie Preston and subsequently had three kids with her. Regardless, deceased actress Carrie Fisher has said he is gay. His occasional co-star Kirstie Alley contends that he’s not gay.\n\nRegardless, he has worked with other gay celebrities and gay actors throughout his career.\n\nIs Kristen Stewart gay?\n\nYes, Kristen Stewart is bisexual. In a February 2017 episode of Saturday Night Live, the actress described herself as “So gay.” But in a March 2017 interview with The Guardian, Stewart identified herself as bisexual.\n\nIs Sam Smith gay?\n\nYes, Sam Smith is gay. The Brit singer came out as gay in a May 2014 interview with The Fader. In the interview, Smith talked about wanting to find someone to love him. But years before he came out, his personal Twitter account was already pretty darned gay. Since his coming out, he has become one of the most outspoken gay celebrities.\n\nIs Justin Bieber gay?\n\nNo, Justin Bieber isn’t gay. He briefly dated singer and actress Selena Gomez and is reportedly married to Hailey Baldwin. In a June 2015 Instagram post, the Canadian-born crooner publicly posted on Instagram that he isn’t gay. Despite that, he once publicly declared himself as Jaden Smith’s boyfriend, but it seems that was just a joke.\n\nIs Bruno Mars gay?\n\nNo, Bruno Mars isn’t gay, as far as we know. A bad 2012 April Fools joke seems to have perpetuated the rumor that he might be gay, but his publicists have denied it. Rumor has it that he’s dating American model Jessica Caban. That’s too bad. We’d love to include the talented singer on our list of gay celebrities.\n\nIs Todd Chrisley gay?\n\nNo, Todd Chrisley isn’t gay. Although the Georgia real estate mogul has described himself as “proudly flamboyant [and] unabashedly enthusiastic about fashion,” he is also married to a woman and has five kids. Because of his dramatic mannerisms and passionate self-expression, he has had to repeatedly deny gay rumors. But while he isn’t LGBTQ-identified, he’s still fun to watch on TV.\n\nIs Cameron Monaghan gay?\n\nNo, Cameron Monaghan isn’t gay. Monaghan played an openly gay character named Ian Gallagher in the comedic Showtime drama Shameless. But in a 2013 Twitter chat with a fan, Monaghan reportedly stated, “No, I’m not gay. Yes, I play a gay character. No, the question should not be relevant.” Monaghan has worked with LGBTQ and gay actors though. He starred as a Joker-style character alongside out actor Cory Michael Smith in the superhero drama series Gotham.\n\nIs Frank Ocean gay?\n\nYes, Frank Ocean is queer, though it’s unclear how he personally self-identifies. While he has never applied either the “gay” or “bisexual” labels onto himself, in a July 4, 2012 Tumblr post, the rapper wrote about falling in love with another man at age 19. Shortly after posting the message, he reportedly cried in gratitude of his newfound happiness and openness. Thus, we would call him LGBTQ or one of our favorite gay celebrities.\n\nIs Shawn Mendes gay?\n\nNo, Shawn Mendes isn’t gay. Although someone hacked the Canadian-born singer’s Twitter account to post a coming out message in August 2017, he later posted a video stating that no, he is not in fact gay. In a November 2018 interview, he stated he has felt a lot of pressure to “prove” that he is straight, a pressure that he worried might drive some closeted LGBTQ artists to suicide.\n\nIs Jaden Smith gay?\n\nNo, Jaden Smith isn’t gay. Though Will and Jada Pinkett-Smith’s son is known for his gender-fluid and neutral fashions, it seems as if he’s mostly dated women. He once dated model Sarah Snyder and after they broke up, a young woman named Odessa Adlon. It’s always possible that he might one day identify as LGBTQ, but for now, he doesn’t belongs on a list of gay celebrities.\n\nIs David Muir gay?\n\nNo, David Muir isn’t gay. At least, it’s unclear whether the well-paid TV journalist is gay or not. For a while, people speculated over Muir’s sexuality after he attended a gay bar with openly gay journalist Gio Benitez. But then Benitez got married to his boyfriend, Tommy DiDario, leaving Muir’s sexuality unknown. Muir has never been married, has never publicly identified as LGBTQ, nor has he ever publicly dated a woman, but that’s all we know.\n\nIs Ryan Seacrest gay?\n\nNo, Ryan Seacrest isn’t gay. And there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that the American Idol TV host most likely is straight. He has previously dated professional dancer Julianne Hough, model Shana Wall and actress Teri Hatcher. Nevertheless, Hough thought he was gay before they started dating.\n\nWhile he isn’t LGBTQ, his American Idol co-host Simon Cowell made repeated insinuations that Seacrest was secretly gay. It is also said that Seacrest resorts to “homophobic innuendo and lascivious comments about female celebrities” on his podcast series On Air With Ryan Seacrest.\n\nIs James Franco gay?\n\nNo, James Franco isn’t gay, despite being an artsy queerbaiter. However, he has previously said, “I like to think that I’m gay in my art and straight in my life.” Adding to his heterosexual cred, he has dated actresses Marla Sokoloff and Ahna O’Reilly. Nevertheless, he has also been involved in plenty of gay art films including Milk, I Am Michael, King Cobra, and Interior. Leather Bar.\n\nSome people have criticized Franco and other heterosexual actors for taking gay and LGBTQ roles that they feel should be played by gay actors.\n\nIs Zac Efron gay?\n\nNo, Zac Efron isn’t gay. The hunky box-office heartthrob has previously dated actress Vanessa Hudgens and model Sami Miró. Despite that, gay rumors have followed him since early in his career, possibly in part to his performance in musicals. In a September 2012 interview, he has said there’s nothing wrong with being gay and added that he had gay role models growing up.\n\nEven though you won’t find him on any list of gay celebrities or gay actors, he still retains many enthusiastic LGBTQ fans.\n\nIs Luke Evans gay?\n\nYes, Luke Evans is openly gay and is one of the few openly gay celebrities starring in major film roles today. Though the actor initially came out as gay in 2002, he then suddenly seemed to go back in the closet in 2010, just as he began starring in major mainstream movies.\n\nEvans has since clarified that he doesn’t like to discuss his sexuality much in the press, but that he isn’t hiding either. He has added that it’s important for people to see him as one of many gay actors living a full, happy life as his full self.\n\nIs Milo Yiannopoulous gay?\n\nYes, Milo Yiannopoulos is gay. Unfortunately, this toxic alt-right douchebag is one of the most visible gay celebrities in recent memory, and mostly for bad reasons. He married his husband in September 2017. But he has become a villain to both left-leaning gay people and conservative right-wingers who were shocked by his comments seeming to promote pedophilia. He is also friends with gay right-winger Chadwick Moore.\n\nIs Anderson Cooper gay?\n\nYes, Anderson Cooper is gay. After a small stint living in the glass closet, CNN anchor Cooper finally came out in July 2012. Cooper says he initially refused to come out to maintain personal privacy in his work as a public journalist. But he came out because he didn’t want people to think he was hiding something. He says his gayness doesn’t affect his objectivity as a journalist. As one of the most visible gay celebrities on mainstream TV, he wields influence over LGBTQ and straight news-hounds alike.\n\nIs Eminem gay?\n\nNo, Eminem isn’t gay, even though he once said he looks for dates on Grindr. (His publicist swears he was kidding.) The rapper was twice married to Kimberly Anne Scott and has used homophobic slurs in his work. However, he is also “close friends” with one of the most famous gay celebrities of all time: gay pop star Elton John.\n\nIs Kenny Chesney gay?\n\nNo, Kenney Chesney isn’t gay. Rumors about the country star’s alleged gayness began after pouty-faced actress Renee Zellweger divorced him for “fraud” barely four months after they tied the knot. But Chesney’s publicist has said Chesney is “unequivocally not gay.” He’s still hunky though.\n\nIs Queen Latifah gay?\n\nNo, Queen Latifah isn’t gay, by which we mean she has never publicly come out as gay. We have included Queen Latifah in our list of pop stars who should come out, but she has never publicly self-identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual. Nevertheless, credible lesbian rumors continue to follow her. In the past, she has played bisexual blues singer Bessie Smith and spoken out for marriage equality.\n\nSo while she’s very queer, don’t add her to your list of gay celebrities or gay actors just yet.\n\nLastly… is Mike Pence gay?\n\nNo, Mike Pence isn’y gay. In fact, we’d say it’s highly unlikely that Trump’s Vice President is even remotely gay, even though a widely circulated November 2016 photo purported to show a younger version of himself bearing his abs at a gay bar. (The photo turned out to be a Pence-esque gay adult film performer Brad Patton.)"
