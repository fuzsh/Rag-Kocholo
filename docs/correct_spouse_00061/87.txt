Ahna O'Reilly revealed that she secretly married to her love, Dave Andron, in 2020 - sharing the news to her Instagram account on Wednesday.

In the posts, the 37-year-old cast member of The Help was seen spending time with her spouse, the co-executive producer and writer, on their wedding day.

She also confirmed her marital status with a message that was left in her post's caption that read: 'Married favorite person a year ago. Was a very good idea & a very good day.'

O'Reilly notably sported a white lace dress while spending time with her husband in the shots.

The happy couple looked especially close while spending time together in the snow in her second picture.

Several of the actress' former castmates showed their support for the performer in the comments section of her post.

Octavia Spencer and Alanna Masterson both left several heart emojis for their friend.

Alison Brie notably commented: 'Happy anniversary!! What a special day!!'

O'Reilly was previously reported to have been in a long-term relationship with James Franco, and the former couple ultimately went their separate ways after they broke up in 2011.

Andron currently works in the entertainment industry and is the showrunner and executive producer of the FX series Snowfall.

O'Reilly is currently set to appear in the forthcoming drama feature Where the Crawdads Sing, which is based on Delia Owens' 2018 book of the same name.

The feature will follow a woman who becomes a suspect in the case of a murder of a man with whom she was previously involved.

In addition to the actress, the film will feature the talents of performers such as Daisy Edgar-Jones, Garret Dillahunt and David Strathairn.

Filming took place this past summer, with several locations in Louisiana being used for shooting.

Where the Crawdads Sing is currently set to be made available to audiences on July 22, 2022.
