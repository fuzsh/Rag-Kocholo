In BULWORTH, a senator decides to end his life and spend his last few days telling the truth wherever he goes during his re-election campaign – which, naturally, completely disrupts the world of politics. Jeremy talks about the genesis of the movie, which came out in 1998, during Bill Clinton’s 2nd term, about the difficult writing process with Warren Beatty, about truth in politics, about the often-discussed ending of the movie, about Aaron Sorkin’s contributions to the screenplay, and about the idea of a Bulworth figure in today’s political landscape.\n\nWe also talk about some of the other projects Jeremy’s been involved in. His career started as a contributor to Warren Beatty’s REDS, a film about the life of communist activist John Reed, he wrote the Diane Keaton movie THE LEMON SISTERS, and more recently, he was the co-writer of another political satire, WAR, INC., starring John Cusack.\n\nThe interview was conducted in connection with our German-language companion podcast Lichtspielplatz. If you speak German, you’ll find an in-depth discussion of BULWORTH in episode #45.\n\nSo here’s Talking Pictures with Jeremy Pikser!\n\nThe mp3 file can be downloaded HERE."
