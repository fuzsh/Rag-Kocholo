        "text": "Originally posted by Genrewriter\n\nGreat article, Jaelle. I agree totally with the thread title as well, rather accurate for me when it comes to writing. While I'm by no means a pro, heck I just graduated from college last summer, I can share the ongoing saga of the first screenplay I ever wrote. I also read a lot of novelizations as a kid, any film that captured my attention. I have the novelization of Friday the 13th Part 3, so it was definitely ANY film that captured my attention.\n\nIn high school, I was involved in the drama department. Midway through my senior year (Winter of '96 to be precise), I was getting a bit tired of it and needed something else to do. I had written a few short horror stories but an idea for an action movie had been growing in my head for a about a month or so. Thinking \"What the heck\", I started writing it."
