        "text": "It was 1973 when Warren Beatty first encountered eccentric tycoon Howard Hughes. (Hughes had reportedly booked multiple rooms at a Beverly Hills hotel for a bevy of women; notorious bed-hopper Beatty was impressed.) The actor soon embarked on a quest to make a movie about the billionaire, a journey that would eventually span the length of four decades—and one that ends this year when his Hughes movie, Rules Don't Apply, finally, finally hits theaters.\n\nBeatty, 79, wrote and directed the film. He also stars in it as a middle-aged Hughes—did we mention the movie's been in the works for 40 years?—who employs a pair of fresh-faced Hollywood wannabes played by Lily Collins and Alden Ehrenreich. Naturally, sparks fly between the two of them; naturally, they're stymied by rules that forbid those under contract to Hughes from fraternizing with each other. Charming old Hollywood hijinks and appearances by a boatload of big names—Beatty’s wife Annette Bening, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin, Matthew Broderick, Martin Sheen, and more—ensue.\n\nThe movie, which looks like a confection designed to delight awards voters of all stripes, hits theaters November 23.\n\nMovies\n\nTrap Is a Bad Dad Movie\n\nJosh Hartnett stars in the latest disappointing thriller from the director of The Sixth Sense.\n\nAward Season\n\nBaby Reindeer’s Jessica Gunning Never Saw Martha as a Villain\n\n“She’s so much more than that,” says the newly minted Emmy nominee of her breakout role in the Netflix hit series.\n\nMovies\n\nWhen You’re 23 and Spielberg Calls: The Wild Origin Story of Jon M. Chu\n\nIn an excerpt from his new memoir, the director of Crazy Rich Asians and Wicked remembers the shock and awe.\n\nMovies\n\nReintroducing Humphrey Bogart: The Untold Stories of a Hollywood Icon’s Volatile Private Life\n\nThe Casablanca star’s career was shaped by his relationships with women, from his distant mother to the love of his life, Lauren Bacall. Those stories come to the forefront in a new documentary, Bogart: Life Comes in Flashes.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nHollywood\n\nUnstoppable Tackles the Inspiring True Story of a One-Legged Wrestling Champion\n\nThe crowd-pleasing sports drama starring Jharrel Jerome and Jennifer Lopez will have its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival.\n\nAward Season\n\nJoan Chen Has Always Been a Movie Star. Hollywood Is Finally Catching Up\n\nThe veteran actor has worked with Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Ang Lee, and maintained rich careers in both China and the US. With the new film Dìdi, Oscar buzz is trailing her for the first time. What took so long?"
