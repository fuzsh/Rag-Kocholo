        "text": "NEW YORK — Robert Towne, an Oscar-winning screenplay writer behind some of Hollywood’s greatest films, has died. He was 89 years old.\n\nHis publicist, Carri McClure, confirmed his death on Tuesday to The New York Times without citing a cause. He died Monday surrounded by his family.\n\nTowne won the Academy Award for best screenplay in 1975 for “Chinatown,” widely considered one of the greatest American films of all time. It ranks No. 21 on the American Film Institute’s Top 100.\n\nHis nomination for “Chinatown” was sandwiched between nominations for two other films he wrote, “The Last Detail,” in 1974 and “Shampoo” in 1976. His screenplay in “Greystoke” also garnered an Oscar nomination.\n\nTowne also worked as an uncredited script doctor on “Bonnie and Clyde” (Best Picture nominee in 1967) and “The Godfather” (Best Picture winner in 1972). In 1997, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Writers Guild of America.\n\nTowne was widely regarded as a master at writing dialogue, though he was less gifted at meeting deadlines — he was notorious for delivering long, unshapely scripts way past their due dates, The Times said.\n\nHe was “a fascinating contradiction: in many ways idealistic, sentimental and very talented; in others a devout compromiser, a delayer, so insecure that he can sometimes seem devious,” film historian David Thomson told The Times.\n\nTowne, for a time, held prestige comparable to the actors and directors he worked with, The Associated Press said. He was friends with two of the biggest stars of the 1960s and ‘70s, Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson, who starred in some of his signature films.\n\nTowne managed to bring a highly personal and influential vision of Los Angeles onto the screen.\n\n“It’s a city that’s so illusory,” Towne told The Associated Press in a 2006 interview. “It’s the westernmost west of America. It’s a sort of place of last resort. It’s a place where, in a word, people go to make their dreams come true. And they’re forever disappointed.”\n\nBefore his motion picture success, Towne worked for a long stretch on television, including “The Man from U.N.C.L.E” and “The Lloyd Bridges Show,” and on low-budget movies for “B” producer Roger Corman.\n\nHis breakthrough, AP said, was a classic show business story.\n\nHis career got a boost in part due to his psychiatrist, through whom he met Beatty, a fellow patient. As Beatty worked on “Bonnie and Clyde,” he brought in Towne for revisions of the Robert Benton-David Newman script and had him on the set while the movie was filmed in Texas.\n\nFor years, he was a favorite ghost writer. In addition to his work on “The Godfather,” he helped out on several movies, including “The Parallax View” and “Heaven Can Wait.” He referred to himself as a “relief pitcher who could come in for an inning, not pitch the whole game,” AP said."
