        "text": "Kael was a local phenomenon but became national when her first collection, I Lost It at the Movies (1965), hit the best-seller list. Two years later, her phone rang. It was The New Yorker’s William Shawn. Would she be interested in the position of staff critic? She’d been discovered at last. An ingénue at 48.\n\nNot just an ingénue, though. An erotic sensation. Lauren Bacall, 19 and insolent, giving Humphrey Bogart a lesson on how to whistle in To Have and Have Not. As a movie critic, Kael was young, hot, and a walk on the wild side, even if as a human being she was middle-aged, bespectacled, and easily mistaken for somebody’s maiden aunt. Sitting in the dark, watching, was her favorite turn-on, her eyes so avid they were like Fingers, stroking and caressing the gorgeous, oversize images up on the screen. That’s why for Kael seeing a movie was having sex with a movie. And the thrill of reading her writing on movies was close to the thrill of movies themselves, was close, in other words, to the thrill of sex.\n\nSo Kael’s movie sex life was killer. How about her sex life sex life? Well, according to Toback, by the time she joined The New Yorker, it was over: “She was done with men.” She costumed herself accordingly. Writer John Gregory Dunne recalled meeting her at a party in the 70s: a “birdlike woman in a Pucci knockdown and orthopedic shoes.” Producer Marcia Nasatir, Kael’s friend: “I never believed those shoes. It was like the bad feet or whatever it was was in her head.” Or Kael’s way of getting in your head. Kael was intensely responsive to chic and beauty and eroticism without having claims on those qualities herself. She knew it and wanted you to know she knew it. Which is why she separated—sharply, distinctly, unmistakably—Kael the writer from Kael the person.\n\nAnd you could argue her sex life was over before it began. She was married once, to Ed Landberg, head of the Cinema Guild, who described the union as “a business arrangement.” And before Landberg, there was just one affair of consequence, with the experimental filmmaker James Broughton, father of her only child, Gina. Broughton, however, was bisexual leaning toward gay. Says Nasatir, with a laugh, “Gina was immaculately conceived.”\n\nI marked Kael’s discovery as the moment William Shawn made her staff critic. But, in fact, that was the moment before the moment. Her breakout at The New Yorker came when the magazine bought a 9,000-word piece rejected by the New Republic on a shoot-’em-up gangster picture called Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nFlashback, His\n\nWarren Beatty has spent three-quarters of his life as a movie star, one measly quarter as a mere mortal. To say he was born on March 30, 1937, in Richmond, Virginia, is thus a misleading statement. His true birth date is March 3, 1960, the day Elia Kazan cast him in Splendor in the Grass. So fast and hitchless was Beatty’s ascent, it seemed fated. But getting to the top was one thing, staying another.\n\nJump-cut to 1966. Beatty, now just shy of 30, had a few interesting failures (Lilith) to his credit, plus a few uninteresting (Kaleidoscope). He was still famous, though more for his off-screen life than on, all those leading ladies he captivated. Which brings us to his reputation as a stud, and he was one, unequivocally. His conquest list reads like the combined wish lists of three generations of American males. Yet, in a fundamental sense, he was the opposite. In spite of his prodigality and prowess, he never came across as aggressive or swaggering. In fact, there was something passive, almost feminine about his sexual persona, so fat-lipped was it, so sultry-eyed and lazy-limbed. He perpetually had the look of somebody who’d just risen from a rumpled bed. In other words, he became a love god by conducting himself like a love goddess.\n\nBy the mid-60s, American movies were as bland and characterless as they’d ever been. Beatty: “I was always looking around. I was certainly aware of what was going on in France.” No surprise. That country then was rampant with enfant genius directors. Girlfriend Leslie Caron: “Warren was very keen on the Nouvelle Vague. I contacted François Truffaut to have lunch. François was pretty sharp and he understood Warren wanted to star in Fahrenheit 451. He said, ‘Oskar Werner has that role, but there’s a script I can’t do because of Fahrenheit. You might be interested.’ ”\n\nHe’d been pursuing her for years (Kael, from an unpublished interview with writer Peter Biskind: “Beatty called after the [Bonnie and Clyde] review. He’s charming and comes on very personally, as if you’ve always been friends”), without success. Every time he suggested she run off with him, use her smarts to make movies go right before the fact rather than point out where they went wrong after, she demurred. She was happy where she was, she said.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, she wasn’t. The New Yorker was putting her under severe strain: the allowance it granted was a pittance, and, more gallingly, it insisted on treating her like all its other children, making her share her column. Beatty sensed her susceptibility. In early ‘79, he phoned under the guise of asking for advice (Kael: “Beatty wanted my assurance that he should back Toback”). He then suggested, very casually, that the three of them work on the movie together. A split-second’s hesitation, a single breath slipping in before her answer: “Yes.”\n\nThat Kael had put herself in desperate peril with this alliance was plain to everybody save her. Friends begged her to reconsider—Hollywood was a place of evil and cunning! She’d spent her life among gentlefolk!—but she was determined. Things turned sordid quick. Almost as soon as she entered Beatty’s protection, he withdrew it, when Toback betrayed her six weeks in. (Toback: “I said, ‘Warren, I can’t function under these circumstances.’ ”) All at once, she was exposed, vulnerable to the industry she’d been dishing it out to for years. And the industry, which worshipped and adored women, though not as much as it feared and loathed them, especially if they were intelligent or disdainful, could hardly wait to pay her back. She was passed off to Don Simpson, a souped-up, coked-up Sammy Glick whose instinct for the lowest common denominator would make him one of the most successful producers of the 80s. Her spirit crushed, she was tossed away. She returned to the East a broken and tragic figure.\n\nThat’s the Seduced and Abandoned version of the story. It’s the one that appeared in Brian Kellow’s biography of Kael, A Life in the Dark, and Peter Biskind’s excellent history of the American New Wave, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls. I understand why it’s caught on. It plays. Meaning it jibes with Beatty the legend, a man so beguiling he need only look at a woman and she’s hooked, hypnotized by the image of herself reflected in the bedroom of his eyes (Schrader, quoted by Kellow: “[Warren] wanted to hunt [Pauline] down, and get her. If she was a twenty-two-year-old starlet, he would get her in one way. If she was a sixty-year-old film critic, he would get her another”), and the smoothest of operators (Buck Henry, quoted by Biskind: “[What Warren did to Pauline] is so Machiavellian, even I can’t quite believe it, except that it was Warren”). It doesn’t jibe, however, with Beatty the person. There are two kinds of chasers: chasers who chase to take down, and chasers who chase to catch. Beatty’s the second. Look at his squeezes, main only—Joan Collins, Natalie Wood, Leslie Caron, Julie Christie, Michelle Phillips, Diane Keaton, Madonna, Annette Bening—and you start to notice a pattern. These are smart, willful women with minds and careers of their own. Kael is Beatty’s type, in other words. Besides which, Kael, her review of Heaven notwithstanding, had been tremendously supportive of him. As Towne says, “Her review of Bonnie and Clydechanged everybody’s lives.” So, as far as revenge as a motive goes—it isn’t one.\n\nA Twice-Told Tale, the Second\n\nThe story of Pauline and Warren was the story of Bonnie and Clyde. Take Bonnie at the movie’s start—carnal, restless, not getting any younger. Under her bedroom window stood a boy, a hood-Romeo. To impress her, he stuck up a market. She was in his lap before he could pull the getaway car to the side of the road.\n\nThere’s a clear resemblance between Bonnie’s attitude toward men and Kael’s toward movies, at least the ones made in America: game, hot to trot even, but disappointed. Experience had taught them that you could depend on men and movies for a couple hours’ worth of mindless excitement. Little else, though. Wrote Kael: “The movie doesn’t have to be great; it can be stupid and empty and you can still have the joy of a good performance, or the joy in just a good line.” Beatty would show Kael, as Clyde would show Bonnie, however, that she didn’t have to set her sights so dismally low. Bonnie and Clyde proved that movies, American movies, could be more than a fast fuck in a boosted car, could be real love and a dream come true—an art for the people.\n\nNot that Kael didn’t give as good as she got. Like Bonnie she was a writer who immortalized her man in print. When Bonnie read Clyde her poem, the one that would be published in newspapers across the country, he said, “You know what you done there? You told my story . . . . You made me somebody they’re gonna remember.” A more apt description of what Kael’s review did for Beatty is hard to imagine.\n\nAnd didn’t that spate of Hollywood movies from 1967 to 1979, from Bonnie and Clyde to, say, Apocalypse Now, feel like a crime spree? As if the American New Wavers were pulling a fast one? The spree couldn’t last, of course. Sooner or later lawmen, i.e., studio men, would catch up. Or, worse, audiences wouldn’t. Times had changed. Kael understood this. In 1978’s “Fear of Movies,” she wrote: “Now that the war has ended . . . [people have] lost the hope that things are going to be better . . . . So they go to the movies to be lulled.” But I’m not quite sure Beatty, who was considerably younger and had been knocked around far less, did. The chaos of the 60s and early-to-mid-70s—Vietnam, Watergate—made for an opening, though it was closing quick. Kael prophesied the end of Pauline and Warren when she wrote of the “new cultural Puritanism,” as surely as Bonnie prophesied the end of Bonnie and Clyde when she wrote of the “sub-gun’s rat-a-tat-tat.” (Did Kael foresee, too, the medium’s end? That the VHS revolution was just around the corner? That the 70s would be the last decade in which movies were truly a tribal experience?)\n\nMaybe Kael went to Hollywood, at least in part, to thwart this prophecy. Beatty had eyes for Kael, and Kael for Beatty, but they weren’t able to relate in a direct way. They’d need a go-between, a C. W. Moss. Toback, who’d just made Fingers, a genuinely alarming movie about a concert pianist-cum-debt collector, would do nicely in that role since he excited them both. Writer George Malko recalls seeing Fingers with Kael: “She lifted up out of her seat, and even as she was settling back down, she was breathing fast.” Toback, on screening Fingers for Beatty: “Warren stood after it was over and walked around in circles for a good two or three minutes.” So Toback, quite literally, got Kael panting and Beatty erect. And Kael and Beatty used Toback to work each other up. Kael had socked it to Beatty for Heaven, accused him of going commercial, selling out. It wasn’t only a review, it was a taunt. And a dare. Beatty double-dog-dared her back with an offer to produce. Kael and Beatty had been leading anti-Establishment figures for a decade-plus, which meant that they’d become the Establishment. By getting behind Toback, an artist, yes, but also a pickup artist, the protégé of composer Aaron Copland and orgy buddy of football player Jim Brown, they would prove that the spark hadn’t gone out of their rebel spirits, that they were still subversive, undaunted, young. Viewed from that angle, the crazy scheme starts to seem not so crazy after all, or possibly just crazy enough to work. Of course it was neither. It was the look Bonnie and Clyde exchanged—passionate, agonized, doomed—before the hail of bullets.\n\nThat Kael had been hit was obvious instantly. Spitting out teeth and blood, she crawled back to The New Yorker. Only it wouldn’t have her. Whitworth: “Mr. Shawn felt Pauline had sullied herself.” Eventually, Whitworth convinced Shawn to reverse his decision. Pauline resumed her post, but it wasn’t much of a homecoming. Two months in, Renata Adler, in The New York Review of Books, declared Kael’s latest collection “piece by piece, line by line, and without interruption, worthless.” It was the most savage attack Kael had ever endured. She remained at the magazine until she retired in 1991. Never again, though, would she be so dynamic a critic or writer.\n\nBeatty made it out, not just alive but stronger. It was the late 70s, the Cold War as chilly as ever, and he was able to persuade Paramount to give him $25 million for Reds, a biopic of Communist John Reed. Except not so fast. Beatty’s wounds were as mortal as Kael’s if less visible, and his death slower. While he’d continue to direct and act in movies, none were as urgent or essential as Bonnie and Clyde or McCabe & Mrs. Miller or Shampoo. Though Reds would win him an Oscar, the film, in retrospect, appears a slighter achievement, the subject matter more daring than it. At heart, it’s a conventional Hollywood picture, its rabble-rousing hero as cute and cuddly as a kitten, as a movie star. Plus which, I don’t think it felt like enough. After finishing it, this three-and-a-half-hour . . . epic on politics, he turned increasingly to the real thing, becoming involved in Gary Hart’s two failed presidential campaigns. The fun had even gone out of fun. Madonna was his big relationship in the 80s, a love affair that had all the passion of a corporate merger. He found contentment, at last, in marriage and children. Yet his contentment is tinged unmistakably with its opposite. Never being satisfied is what gave him his edge, kept stagnation at bay. How could he not be a little wistful?\n\nThrice-Told a Charm?\n\nThe Bonnie and Clyde version is the version I find more plausible. Obviously. I’ve already dismissed Seduced and Abandoned as so much cornball claptrap. To talk of villainy and virtue, sin and redemption, in post-pill, pre-AIDS Hollywood is lunatic. Only, here’s the thing: Seduced and Abandoned won’t be dismissed, because while Kael’s humiliation was professional, it was, in a deeper sense, sexual. Granted, there wasn’t any sex going on. But there was sex not going on. Schrader: “Jimmy then was thin, handsome, an irrepressible raconteur and hustler. He was the Jewish Warren Beatty, and with a lot more kinks in his hose.” And Toback admits, “If I wanted to push it in a sexual direction with Pauline, I could have. There was never a minute’s awkwardness between us. It was just there.”\n\nSo, the question then becomes, Did Kael do it all for love? The answer is another question, What else? Her official reasons—fear of growing stale as a critic, eagerness for new worlds to conquer—are true but insufficient. She had to have been impelled by something stronger than reason. Had to have known at some level what was in store for her too. The stakes were just so wildly uneven. She was giving up both job and home to move to L.A., a city where, as she once wrote, “a man can get along without his honor, but not without his car.” And she couldn’t drive. Beatty, conversely, stood only to gain. Reds was always the priority, Love & Money a side project. And Kael, says Schrader, “was the bête noire of film at that time.” If the hire worked, Beatty had tamed the shrew; if not, he’d as good as. So win or lose, he won.\n\nAnother twist: actress Veronica Cartwright’s encounter with Kael and Toback just before the Hollywood foray. Kael, who’d raved about Cartwright in the past, requested a sit-down. They were having cocktails when Toback appeared. Cartwright: “Pauline had invited him. It was an odd relationship, very intense. I got a vibe like it was a little kinky. After our drink, Pauline asked me to a screening. I told her I couldn’t. Maybe she liked me. Maybe it pissed her off that I didn’t reciprocate, because she never mentioned me in a review again. I don’t know whether or not she was gay. Maybe she was gay and Toback was her protégé. I mean, she facilitated a meeting between me and him, and I couldn’t tell if it was an audition or she was setting me up with him or what.” Toback as Kael’s id, acting out her secret longings? Well, it’s a theory, and Toback doesn’t dismiss it: “If I ever thought Pauline might be gay, it was for Veronica. No critic has ever hyped an actress to me as she did Veronica. And I do think there was a vicarious leap going on with me and Pauline. There are certain people where, when you go into detail, they not only welcome it, they want more. Never was there a stop sign with Pauline. It was always laughing and ‘Oh, honey, oh, honey.’ ”\n\nWhat was going on in Beatty’s mind? Why did he imagine Kael capable of so radical a career change? Beatty: “My thinking was influenced by the Cahiers du Cinéma guys. To me, it seemed like a natural progression, film criticism to film production.” As reasoning goes, it’s reasonable. And maybe that’s that. No need to look deeper or further. But then there’s the timing. Kael had tried to talk Beatty out of Reds, his passion project, told him to do Toback’s movie instead. And this right after her brutal Heaven review. I seriously doubt that he set out to do her harm, as Schrader and Henry suggested. So does Toback: “When I asked that Pauline be fired, Warren was 100 percent opposed. He admired Pauline.” Perhaps, though, there was an unconscious desire on Beatty’s part not to take her out but on, show her he wasn’t intimidated.\n\nAnd then there’s the air of degradation and moral downfall that hovers over the episode. Now Kael was no Victorian waif. She was a modern woman, and tough. She was tender too, though. As a romantic—and nobody as ardent about movies could be other than—she was, fundamentally, a pure-heart. And so the betrayal she experienced was double, by the man she loved and by the thing, the second the more damaging. Naturally, she’d known going in that Hollywood was a cesspool. Knowing something intellectually, however, is different from knowing it viscerally. In any case, her enchantment with the movies was over. She didn’t, it seems, admit this to anyone, maybe not even to herself. Yet the proof is in her prose. When she returned to reviewing, she sounded like her old self. Too much. Her tone became less passionate than bullying, her praise less extravagant than excessive. (Casualties of War has the same kind of purity as Grand Illusion?) It felt as if she was faking it. Says writer James Wolcott, “In the last couple of years, she despaired. She didn’t care about the films. I’d suggest she try something else. ‘I can’t re-invent myself. I’m a movie critic,’ she’d say.”\n\nKael’s mistake, I think, was in believing she needed the movies. Really, it was the other way around. Movies are an art that is only intermittently an art. She, however, was an artist, always and invariably, the equal to any director or actor she covered, the superior to most. In writing about one thing, she managed to write about all things. Her movie reviews were cultural criticism, sociological treatise, personal essay. Through sheer passion and craft, she transformed what was intended to be a consumer guide into a literary vehicle as supple and expressive as the short story or sonnet. Not by the end, though. The form she started out transcending she wound up trapped by. And the final scenes of her career were the final scenes of Sunset Boulevard, except she was Joe Gillis and Norma Desmond, the writer floating dead in the swimming pool and the actress-murderess descending the staircase as the cameras flashed, a star who’d outgrown the pictures that had gotten so small.\n\nClosing Credits\n\nAnd now, back to the beginning. I called the facts I listed verifiable. They both are and aren’t. (Basically, I let you think we were standing on solid ground when I knew perfectly well it was quicksand.) In Beatty’s telling, he was far from a lead in this real-life drama: “My role, if that’s what you want to call it, was to encourage Love & Moneyto get made at Paramount, but not as an active producer, certainly not as a star.” He didn’t ask Kael to produce. It was vice versa: “She said, ‘I’d really love to produce a movie.’ I said, ‘I think I can make that happen.’ ”\n\nThis is counter to Toback’s telling. His take on Love & Money, ultimately made, but at Lorimar, and without Kael or Beatty: “Of the 14 movies I’ve done, Love & Money is my least favorite, a distant last place. I shouldn’t have got rid of Pauline. I regret it.” His willingness to do himself the dirty, make unflattering admissions, gives his account the ring of truth. That and the fact that it aligns with the characters—so far as I understand them, anyway—of the people involved. Also helping his cause: Kael backs him up, posthumously. As do Barry Diller and Kael’s lawyer, Kenneth Ziffren, non-posthumously.\n\nSo Beatty, it would seem, got it wrong. It could be that his memory’s on the fritz. Or it could be that he’s intentionally trying to deceive, wants to dissociate himself from a failed movie and a dark episode in Kael’s life. Or it could be that Toback nailed it: “Warren, at that time, was also selling Heaven Can Wait and developing Reds. So he had three things going on, only one of which was Love & Money. I had nothing else on my mind. I’m going to remember better!”\n\nA final possibility: that Beatty, an individual not given to mistakes, didn’t make one here. In which case, all I can say in my own defense is that I was following his advice. After all, it was he who quoted to me the man he played in his most recent movie, Howard Hughes: “Never check an interesting fact.”"
