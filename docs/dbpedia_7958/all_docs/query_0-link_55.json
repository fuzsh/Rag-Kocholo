And he was very interested in controlling the image of himself, of how he was seen. But at the same time people spoke well of him. I never met him. Sometimes I feel I met everybody who had met him, because people like to talk about Howard. There was something about his situation that enabled him to just do what he wanted to do. Inherited wealth can be a burden, but it also can be an enabling factor.”\n\nHollywood Walk of Fame\n\nIn discussing his role as Howard Hughes, Beatty admitted he has been no stranger to portraying true-life figures. “Napoleon said, ‘History is a set of lies agreed upon,’” he told Mo Rocca. “The best you can do is to find the truth or, if you’re making a movie, are you able to utilize the truth as you see it for the purposes of your movie? I’ve done it a few times before. I did it with ‘Bonnie and Clyde’; I’m not really very much like Clyde Barrow. I did it with ‘Bugsy.’ I’m not very much like Bugsy Siegel. And I did it with John Reed in ‘Reds.’ And so you take what moves you or amuses you, and you do what you can do.”\n\nBy CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan"
