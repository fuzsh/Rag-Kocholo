        "text": "Republican Charlie Baker clinched the Massachusetts governor’s race, defeating Democrat Martha Coakley, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe result is not entirely unexpected, as Baker held a narrow lead, adding to Republican victories in Democrat-leaning states such as Maryland and Maine.\n\nCoakley, famous for her 2010 Senate loss to Scott Brown, made a point of showing she was campaigning hard this time around. In 2010, she came under fire for not campaigning hard enough.\n\nBaker pointed to management problems in state government, including a faulty ObamaCare website, and played up his liberal social views. One ad featured his brother, who is gay.\n\nBaker joins a history of Republican governors in Massachusetts. Before the current Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick, there were Republican governors for 16 straight years."
