        "text": "Senate hopeful Martha Coakley got a high-profile boost yesterday when she and three other attorneys general met at the White House with President Obama about the future of financial regulations.\n\nCoakley and her counterparts from Illinois, New York and North Carolina emerged from the meeting yesterday with Obama, the newly minted Nobel Peace Prize winner, declaring they were all in agreement about the need for new laws governing financial firms and the need for a new consumer financial protection agency.\n\n“Everyone was very enthusiastic,” Coakley said in an interview after the White House meeting.\n\nCoakley, whose group also met with Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and White House economic adviser Larry Summers, said the president is aware that state regulators and law-enforcement authorities are nervous that any new financial laws could preempt states’ authority to crack down on financial-sector shenanigans.\n\nBut the president is “in agreement” on the need to preserve states’ ability to regulate financial firms and protect consumers, she said.\n\nThough billed as a working meeting tied to her duties as attorney general, the announcement of Coakley’s visit to the White House was issued by her Senate campaign staff.\n\nCoakley said the meeting was all business, not politics.\n\n“It’s about my work as attorney general,” she said.\n\nSpokesmen for Coakley’s Democratic opponents and the Massachusetts Republican Party either declined comment or didn’t get back to the Herald.\n\nBruce Marks, head of Boston’s Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, said Coakley has been “much more aggressive” than attorneys general in other states in cracking down on financial-sector abuses."
