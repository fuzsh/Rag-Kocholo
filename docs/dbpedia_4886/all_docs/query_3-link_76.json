        "text": "On May 18, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker announced his initial plan for a four-phase reopening of the Massachusetts economy.\n\nMassachusetts reopening plan\n\nAmong the highlights:\n\nThe reopening will take place during four phases with a minimum of 3 weeks between each phase. The phases will be driven by public health data related to COVID-19. A spike in COVID cases could result in a return to the previous phase.\n\nEach resident of Massachusetts has a personal responsibility to help make the reopening possible – with an emphasis on wearing face coverings, maintaining social distancing guidelines of a minimum of 6 feet; personal hygiene/hand washing; frequent cleaning of common touch surfaces; monitoring symptoms; and remaining home if sick.\n\nPhase 1 begins May 18 with the opening of houses of worship, and the construction and manufacturing sectors. Other sectors will open on May 25th to include office spaces of up to 25% occupancy (Boston’s start date will not be until June 1st). Some personal services, limited outdoor recreation facilities, and additional healthcare services will also reopen on May 25.\n\nAll businesses/industries that reopen will need to comply with mandatory safety standards as well as sector-specific protocols. This order will require use of a planning template, self-certification of compliance, poster/sign displays, employee training, and ample cleaning supplies.\n\nEmployers are asked to stagger shifts to accommodate social distancing requirements wherever feasible, provide work accommodations for those at higher risk, and allow employees to continue working from home if possible.\n\nThe Stay at Home Order has been revised to a Safety at Home Advisory."
