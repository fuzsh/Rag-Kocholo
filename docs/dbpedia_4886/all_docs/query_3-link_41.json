        "text": "Short takes: Baker makes his exit from Mass. politics official\n\nAccording to campaign finance records, his gubernatorial campaign account was dissolved on January 4 and so was the super PAC that he helped launch in 2019 to support largely centrist candidates across Massachusetts.\n\nBaker portrait hung at State House\n\nCharlie Baker’s official portrait, unveiled at a private soiree December 21 in the State House library, was up on the wall this week in the lobby of the executive suite for all to see.\n\nHe’ll make a mark as Quincy’s Black, gay city council president – but don’t ask him about it\n\nThe first Black person and openly gay person to serve in elected office in Quincy, Ian Cain scoffs at the identity politics of the left, and appears to fit more comfortably in the mold of a Charlie Baker Republican.\n\nThe term ‘turf’ is misleading\n\nMOUNTAINS OF OLD truck tires dotting the US countryside used to be a common sight, but no longer. Companies have found a lucrative new use for old tires: grinding them up and re-marketing them as “artificial turf” for children’s athletic fields. The arguments in favor of plastic turf initially appear compelling. It’s a way to […]\n\nHealey brings more women into governor’s office\n\nGOV. MAURA HEALEY, the first woman to be elected governor of Massachusetts, is bringing more women into state government with her.

Jay DiLisio has been serving as acting mayor of the Bristol County city since former mayor Paul Heroux, […]\n\nFive key elements of Baker’s legacy\n\nAS HE LEAVES OFFICE after eight years as governor of the Commonwealth, the pundits are trying to assess what Charlie Baker’s legacy as governor is all about. Legacy means investments and direction with long-lasting impact that would not have been done otherwise. As someone who first became involved in state government more than 30 years […]\n\nBaker’s take on the state Republican Party\n\nGOV. CHARLIE BAKER would like to see the Massachusetts Republican Party rebuild and recover, but he says it first has to go through a transformation, much as he did after his defeat in his initial run for governor in 2010. It’s a subject Baker has been thinking about a lot lately. He delivered a lecture […]\n\nBaker administration fleshes out 2050 climate plan\n\nTHE BAKER ADMINISTRATION on Wednesday released a 168-page climate plan for 2050 that follows the same general playbook that’s been outlined in the past – increase production of clean electricity; use that electricity to electrify the energy-intensive transportation, building, and industrial sectors; and achieve net-zero emissions by removing additional carbon from the atmosphere using natural […]"
