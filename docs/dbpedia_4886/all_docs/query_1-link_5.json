        "text": "Attorney General Martha Coakley is the chief lawyer and law enforcement officer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In addition, her office is an advocate and resource for the Commonwealth and its residents in many areas, including consumer protection, combating fraud and corruption, protecting civil rights, and promoting meaningful economic recovery.\n\nThe Office of the Attorney General is organized into five Bureaus: Executive; Business and Labor; Criminal; Government; and Public Protection and Advocacy. Each bureau is divided into divisions and teams. These Bureaus and Divisions have distinct missions, but work closely together to ensure the Attorney General’s Office provides the highest level of public protection.\n\nThe Executive Bureau\n\nThe Executive Bureau provides administration, public information, and policy development support for the Office, as well as operational, information technology, human resources, and fiscal management services for the Office.

The Bureau develops and maintains close working relationships with the agencies it represents, often providing them guidance and advice where advance legal consultation may prevent unnecessary litigation and costly lawsuits. The Government Bureau initiates affirmative litigation in the public interest, on behalf of the Commonwealth and its residents. The Bureau also enforces the state’s Open Meeting Law through its Division of Open Government, and reviews and approves town bylaws through its Municipal Law Unit.\n\nThe Bureau has three divisions and one unit:\n\nThe Administrative Law Division\n\nThe Division of Open Government\n\nThe Trial Division\n\nThe Municipal Law Unit\n\nThe Public Protection and Advocacy Bureau\n\nThe Public Protection and Advocacy Bureau uses investigation, litigation, and other advocacy to enforce laws protecting the Commonwealth.

Regional office staff include lawyers, labor inspectors, consumer mediators, and administrative staff who are knowledgeable about the statewide activities of the Attorney General’s Office and have also developed special relationships with local, regional, and community resources. The regional offices work closely with local community organizations to provide outreach and education programs on important consumer and public safety issues.\n\nStaff in each regional office will be able to:\n\nEvaluate whether we can help you preparing or file a complaint;\n\nGive you basic information about the law or your rights on issues of concern; or\n\nRefer you to the appropriate community organization or other government agency which may be best able to provide assistance.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office also runs a statewide Public Inquiry and Assistance Center, and supports over thirty regional local consumer and mediation programs, which you may choose to contact.\n\nNote: The Attorney General’s Office is not authorized to provide legal advice or representation to individuals.
