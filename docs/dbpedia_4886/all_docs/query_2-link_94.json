        "text": "Before an underwhelming crowd at the Hanover Theatre in Worcester, Martha Coakley and Charlie Baker went back and forth for an hour on a number of topics. The debate for the Governor's seat addressed issues like healthcare, jobs, problems in Worcester, and the candidates personal use of marijuana.\n\nAfter the game show host Latoyia Edwards ended her introductions, the debate could finally get underway. Edwards, a reporter for NECN, after a few questions of her own, handed the reigns over to the two member panel of Chris Sinacola from the Telegram and Gazette and Alison King, also from NECN.\n\nThe roller coasters of recent polls ignited some early excitement for this debate. Last week, the Boston Globe endorsed Baker and had him ahead by nine points. On Monday morning, a New York Times Poll had Coakley in the lead by four points. However, by Monday afternoon, a poll released by UMass Lowell and 7 News had Baker in the lead by four points. With everyone seemingly conducting their own polls, John Henningan of Worcester, said \"You can't keep track if you wanted to. I dont think any of the polls make any difference. It's going to come down to next Tuesday and that's that.\"\n\nEdwards first question to Coakley was blunt. Edwards asked, \"Why arent you leading and leading big right now?\" Coakley said, \"I believe this race is pretty close. We will on November 4th.\"\n\nCoakley accused Baker of having \"a typical Republican playbook.\" Baker responded with an exasperrated \"I'm tired of hearing about my typical Republican playbook.\"\n\nSusan Hughes, of Worcester, said \"I thought the crowd's majority was for Charlie. I think the first half was his and the second half was Coakleys. I liked it when she referenced Worcester problems like drugs. Baker was condescending and I did not appreciate that. He is a little cocky. His hand is always in his pocket. His swag is ready for a cigar in the boardroom of Harvard Pilgrim.\"\n\nBaker, former CEO of Harvard Pilgrim, turned the tables on Coakley after she told Baker that the only reason he fixed any problems at Harvard Pilgrim was because he laid so many people off. \"You look at the bottom line and don't see people,\" Coakley said.\n\nBaker quickly responded with \"So, you dont have any suggestions about how you would have dealt with the problems at Harvard Pilgrim?\" This quick comment resulted in more than one applause from the Worcester crowd.\n\nWaiting for the applause to end, Coakley said, \"That's not the point. You are always look at the bottom line, and that's one example of it.\"\n\nThe candidates had to respond to several questions with a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" response. These questions were in a \"lightning-round\" style. Hughes didn't like the style the questions were presented in. Hughes said, \"The yes and no questions were not fair to either party.\"\n\nWhen asked if they had ever used marijuana, Coakley said \"no\" and Baker said \"yes.\"\n\nThe question was asked of whether or not the candidate thought it feasible for Boston to host the Olympics in eight years. While Baker said he supports the idea, he stressed that he needed more information and needed to see any plans already in progress. Coakley gave the unfortunate response of \"I say, go for the gold.\"\n\nThe final question of the debate was, if the candidate lost this election, would this be their last run at public office? Both candidates said yes. Baker added that his wife wouldn't let him run for anything again."
