        "text": "Attorney General Martha Coakley is calling on federal authorities to take a “close look” into GOP gubernatorial rival Charlie Baker’s role at a Cambridge firm and a $25 million deal it scored with New Jersey’s public pension fund — but she’s doing so as candidate, not AG, her campaign insisted.\n\nGeneral Catalyst scored a $25 million deal with New Jersey’s public pension fund in 2011, months after Baker — listed as an “executive-in-resident/partner” at the firm — donated $10,000 to the New Jersey Republican State Committee headed by New Jersey Gov., and Baker ally, Chris Christie. It’s raised questions of whether state or federal “pay-to-play” rules were violated, though Baker has denied that, arguing that despite his title, he isn’t an employee of General Catalyst and has no role in the deals it makes.\n\nMoney from the pension fund deal was then invested in a company Baker oversees in February 2013.\n\nCoakley said oversight agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, should take a look into what she called “troubling allegations” surrounding Baker and General Catalyst. Campaign spokeswoman Bonnie McGilpin said Coakley was making the comment as a candidate for governor, not as attorney general.\n\nBaker spokesman Tim Buckley said, “Charlie has been completely transparent about this contribution and his association with General Catalyst. The fact remains that this contribution is permissible. This is politics over substance from Attorney General Coakley who was recently fined thousands of dollars for violating campaign finance laws.”"
