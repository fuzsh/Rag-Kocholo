        "text": "BOSTON — State Attorney General Martha Coakley today filed a federal lawsuit challenging the legality of drastic new quota cutbacks in the northeast fishery.\n\nCoakley appeared at a press conference at the Boston Fish Pier with several lawmakers including Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass. and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rick Sullivan.\n\nThere were no New Bedford representatives at the press conference.\n\nState Rep. Bruce Tarr, R-Gloucester, praised Coakley for keeping a promise she made a month ago during a fish rally at the same spot. Coakley said then she would do everything she could to help the fishing industry.\n\nAt today's press conference, Coakley and others repeatedly referred to NOAA in harsh terms such as “relentless,” “vindictive” and “overzealous.”\n\nShe said the new quota cutbacks are “essentially a death penalty for the fishing industry as we know it. NOAA totally ignored the impact.”\n\nThe lawsuit contends that the new quotas, which took effect May 1, violate the Magnuson-Stevens Act which governs fisheries management.\n\nFirst, the suit says NOAA fisheries failed to seek the maximum sustainable yield on various species of fish as required by law.\n\nSecond, the suit charges that NOAA failed to use adequate science in making its decisions.\n\nThird, Coakley said that NOAA failed to consider the effects of the new rules on fishing communities and their economies."
