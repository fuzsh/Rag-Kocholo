        "text": "Martha Mary Coakley (born July 14, 1953) is the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Prior to serving as Attorney General, she was District Attorney of Middlesex County, Massachusetts from 1999 to 2007.\n\nCoakley was the Democratic nominee in the special electionâ€Ž to fill the seat in the United States Senate held by interim Senator Paul G. Kirk, who was appointed upon the death of Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy. The special election decided who would fill the remaining three years of Kennedy's term. Coakley was defeated by Republican Scott Brown 52% to 47%, widely considered a stunning upset in Democratic-dominated Massachusetts. She won reelection as the Attorney General in the 2010 general election.\n\nBorn in Pittsfield, Massachusetts to Edward J. and Phyllis E. Coakley, Coakley moved at the age of one with her parents to North Adams. There, she attended St. Joseph's School and Drury High School, graduating in June 1971. Coakley currently resides in Medford. She is married to Thomas F. O'Connor, Jr."
