She will reportedly address supporters and reporters at her Somerville headquarters at 11 a.m. Wednesday morning.\n\nMultiple news organizations called the election to Baker at around midnight, but Coakley said she wanted to wait until the morning for all the votes to be tallied before conceding.\n\nThe governorâ€™s race was one the closest statewide results in recent memory."
