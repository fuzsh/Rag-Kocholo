        "text": "DARTMOUTH — The economy, education and transportation were in focus as Democrat Martha Coakley and Republican Charlie Baker debated Friday at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.\n\nWith less than three weeks remaining until voters pick a new governor, Baker and Coakley each pledged to create economic growth in all regions of the state.\n\n\"Now we have a chance to build a sustainable regional economy,\" Coakley said. \"That doesn't mean just Boston and Cambridge ... .\"\n\nBaker vowed that city and town governments will share in any prosperity.\n\n\"I'm still the only candidate running for governor who said as tax revenue grows at the state level, local aid has to grow along with it,\" Baker said. \"We cannot be a great state if we starve our cities and towns.\"\n\nA discussion on transportation dominated an early stretch of the debate.\n\nWhile Coakley and Baker each voiced support for South Coast Rail — a planned commuter rail expansion to New Bedford, Fall River and Taunton — the two were sharply divided on other transportation issues.\n\nCoakley, the current attorney general, claimed financial issues surrounding the Big Dig have delayed subsequent transportation projects, including South Coast Rail. Baker served as secretary of administration and finance in the 1990s.\n\n\"One of the reasons it's taken so long to get here is the financing on the Big Dig my opponent was engaged in,\" she said.\n\nBaker said Coakley's assertions were untrue.\n\n\"Let's talk about the Big Dig,\" he said. \"It started when I was in college and ended after I left public office.\"\n\nThe two also clashed on the issue of indexing future increases in the gasoline tax to the rate of inflation.\n\n\"It's a predictable way of ensuring income we can depend upon for funding to repair roads and bridges,\" Coakley said.\n\nBaker, on the other hand, opposes indexing.\n\n\"I think legislators should have to vote on increasing taxes and face the voters to explain why they voted for that decision,\" he said.\n\nVoters will decide on the indexing issue in a ballot question Nov. 4.\n\nDuring a discussion on energy policy, Baker criticized the attorney general for failing to do more to advocate for electric service ratepayers. Referring to National Grid's recent announcement that it expects electric rates to increase by 37 percent, Baker said Coakley missed an opportunity to advocate for increasing natural gas pipeline capacity to keep energy costs lower.\n\nCoakley, speaking to reporters after the debate, called that claim \"disingenuous.\"\n\nShe outlined a plan for education, calling for expanding access to early education. She also discussed a need to invest in education programs that provide the skills necessary for today's economy.\n\nBaker, a former CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, advocated cutting red tape to make it more efficient and less expensive to do business in Massachusetts.\n\n\"We will never be the great state we want to be unless we realize we compete with other states and other countries for jobs and economic opportunities, and we need to compete to win,\" Baker said.\n\nCoakley questioned how Baker can pay for everything he's promised.\n\n\"It sounds a little bit like fuzzy math to me,\" she said.\n\nThe debate was hosted by the SouthCoast Alliance, an association of cities and towns, chambers of commerce, educational bodies and non-profit organizations from across SouthCoast. Professor Shannon Jenkins, who chairs UMass Dartmouth's political science department, moderated the forum.\n\nThe state election is Nov. 4. In addition to Baker and Coakley, independent candidates Evan Falchuk, Jeff McCormick and Scott Lively will appear on the ballot."
