Governor Charlie Baker appointed District Attorney Gulluni to MOVA, through which he works closely with Attorney General Martha Coakley, who chairs the agency, and the Victim and Witness Assistance Board (VWAB), which governs it. District Attorney Gulluni plays a key role in setting MOVA policy and managing regional operations, working to ensure prompt, appropriate and thorough assistance for victims. Having helped identify specially trained and certified advocates for placement in Hampden County District Court, he oversees coordination and delivery of their services. In April of 2018, MOVA opened a location in Northampton, expanding beyond the agency’s Boston headquarters for the first time in its 34-year history.\n\nGovernor’s Task Force on Hate Crimes\n\nGovernor Baker appointed District Attorney Gulluni to the Governor’s Task Force on Hate Crimes when he reestablished it in 2017.
