        "text": "Charlie Baker is the Governor of Massachusetts, a position he has held since 2015. Baker is ardently pro-Israel, has supported the construction of a massive new women's prison in MA, and has opposed equal rights for immigrants living in Massachusetts.\n\nSupport for Israeli Ethnic Cleansing\n\nThroughout his time as Governor, Charlie Baker has been an ardent supporter of Israel. In May 2021, as Israel undertook a brutal aerial bombing campaign against Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip, Baker declared \"I Stand With Israel.\" Baker has also met with (then) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and has expressed support for Israeli companies operating in the Boston area.\n\nIn 2018, Baker signed a law which provided $250,000 in Massachusetts state funding to the New England-Israel Business Council. Two years earlier, in 2016, the New England-Israel Business Council paid for Governor Baker to participate in an \"Economic Development Mission\" to Israel (i.e. a propaganda junket), eliciting charges of a conflict of interest when Baker decided to allocate public funding to the New England-Israel Business Council two years later.\n\nSupport for Incarceration\n\nIn January 2021, Governor Baker introduced a $50 million plan to build a new women's prison in Massachusetts. The plan was fiercely opposed by Black and Brown community members including the group Families for Justice as Healing and the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls. These and other opponents of the plan demanded that state resources be used to actually support Black and Brown community members, not to lock them up.\n\nSupport for the Oppression of Immigrants"
