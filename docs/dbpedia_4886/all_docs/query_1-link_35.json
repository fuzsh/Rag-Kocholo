        "text": "BOSTON – State Attorney General Martha Coakley’s office is launching live online training sessions on the Open Meeting Law, which governs public boards.\n\nThe announcement came Monday as part of Sunshine Week, a national effort to draw attention to the importance of open government and freedom of information.\n\nIt also came on the day The Patriot Ledger reported what it found when it looked at the more than 500 Open Meeting Law complaints lodged with the attorney general’s office since the summer of 2010. Boards were found to have violated the law in 221 cases, but only three of the boards were fined. Many others received only a warning.\n\nCritics say Massachusetts’ sunshine law remains one of the weakest in the nation.\n\nBeginning next month, Coakley’s office will offer free live Web-based training sessions to help public bodies better understand the law.\n\nAll members of public bodies must certify that they have read the law. The new training sessions are voluntary and meant as additional education.\n\nThe office already offers an in-person regional training program and an online video series. The office has conducted more than 100 training sessions across the state since 2010.\n\nMassachusetts adopted its first Open Meeting Law in 1958.\n\nThe Legislature revamped the law in 2009, moving jurisdiction for enforcement from the local district attorneys’ offices to the attorney general.\n\nAs in the past, the Legislature exempted itself from the law.\n\nChristian Schiavone may be reached at cschiavone@ledger.com.
