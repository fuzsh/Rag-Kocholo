        "text": "Everything was all set up for a party at Bob and Peg MacKenzie's Abbott Street home Aug. 24.\n\nThe morning weather was perfect, and the sweets, fruits and drinks were set up on tables for guests, who could then sit in the chairs set in a semicircle around the yard.\n\nBut it's not every day that a backyard party hosts a candidate for governor, which the MacKenzies were doing for Democratic state Attorney General Martha Coakley. Peg, a state Democratic committeewoman who was the first woman elected chair of the Weymouth Democratic Town Committee, has worked on the South Shore for Democratic candidates that include the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy and the late U.S. Rep. Gerry Studds.\n\n\"I wanted Martha to come to Weymouth, and I had this back yard I wanted to show off,\" she said. \"I haven't had a big function here in a long time, but I figured this was a good day to do it. I love this. I've met such wonderful people.\"\n\nAmong those in attendance were what Bob Sheehan of IBEW Local No 103 estimated were more than a dozen union members and their spouses. Sheehan said the union is supporting Coakley because of what she has done not just for labor, but for the middle class, including making people aware of workers not being represented properly and businesses not treating them properly.\n\n\"She puts everything on an equal playing field,\" he said.\n\nLocal officials at the event included Councilor-at-Large Jane Hackett and District 6 Councilor Michael Smart, along with Mayor Susan Kay, who said during her remarks she was pleased and relieved when Coakley announced she was running for governor because the attorney general was what she called \"the three Cs\": courageous, comforting and caring.\n\n\"This is a woman who has taken on the bullies, and I love her for it,\" Kay said, citing Coakley taking on banks and fighting for same-sex marriage.\n\nKay also noted the Coakley has visited the town's Great Pumpkin Give-A-Wey, and that one time when middle-schoolers were interviewing her, she suggested they also interview Coakley.\n\n\"She was wonderful with those kids,\" Kay said.\n\nAfter circulating through the crowd talking to and taking pictures with guests, Coakley spoke about how Wall Street banks gambled and lost people's money in 2008, leading to a difficult recession, but that Massachusetts is in position to recover on its own terms and that it matters who the next governor is because of the need to improve the economy for everybody.\n\n\"We believe in investments in education, in our work force and our people,\" she said.\n\nCoakley talked about a longer school day that includes science and technology, but also art and music and even recess.\n\n\"We need to move away from teaching our kids to the test, to teaching kids,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this year, Coakley reached a settlement with Partners HealthCare that includes allowing it to merge with South Shore Hospital in Weymouth. The deal has been controversial, with a group of 21 academic economists, along with competitors, claiming the benefits would outweigh the loss of competition.\n\nWhen Coakley's office announced the deal, it cited provisions that include preventing Partners from contracting with affiliate physician groups that are not part of its owned hospitals for 10 years; capping health costs at the rate of inflation across the Partners network through 2020; capping physician growth for five years; and blocking continued expansion into eastern Massachusetts for the next seven years.\n\nCoakley said she has looked very closely at the Partners deal, and said it will provide benefits in both costs and services.\n\n\"It's a complicated agreement, but it's thorough and it's tough,\" she said.\n\nCoakley also said mental and behavioral health matters should be treated the same as diabetes, citing her brother Edward, who she said never got help for his bipolar disorder because he was afraid of the stigma and eventually committed suicide.\n\n\"In 2015, there's no reason for that,\" she said. \"We can lead the way in mental and behavioral health care.\"\n\nIn another Weymouth-related issue, Coakley called the redevelopment of the former South Weymouth Naval Air Station both an opportunity and a challenge. Last week, Gov. Deval Patrick signed changes to the legislation governing the SouthField project. (See related story on page 1.)\n\n\"Let's make sure we do it right,\" she said.\n\nAs the party was a campaign event, the table with the snacks also included sign-up sheets for volunteering and envelopes for donations. Coakley is competing in the Sept. 9 Democratic primary against state Treasurer Steven Grossman and Donald Berwick, a former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will face the victor of the Republican contest, either Charlie Baker, a former CEO at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and the GOP candidate for governor in 2010; or Mark Fisher, owner of the Merchant's Fabrication metal-manufacturing facility in Auburn.\n\n\"You need to spread the word to your friends,\" Coakley said. \"Let's show Massachusetts that people care about this race.\"\n\nCoakley had campaigned on Cape Cod the previous day, and was headed back to the Cape for events in Falmouth and Chatham after her stop in Weymouth.\n\n\"We're going to work every day through Sept. 9, and if we're successful, we'll be knocking on doors Sept. 10,\" she said.\n\nMaterial from Patriot Ledger reporters Fred Hanson and Christian Schiavone was used in this story."
