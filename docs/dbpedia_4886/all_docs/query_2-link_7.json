        "text": "A campaign staffer for Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Martha Coakley is listed as a contact on press releases for Mass NOW ripping GOP rival Charlie Baker in an apparent conflict experts say could violate state and federal laws barring nonprofits from coordinating with political campaigns.\n\nKatie Prisco-Buxbaum is the contact person on two press releases from the Massachusetts chapter of the National Organization for Women slamming Baker in recent weeks for his stance on embattled NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Baker’s “sweetheart” flap.\n\nPrisco-Buxbaum, who has been paid nearly $16,000 by Coakley’s campaign, is listed as vice president of communications and a board member for Mass NOW on the nonprofit’s website.\n\nA Mass NOW leader says Prisco-Buxbaum is a volunteer, but a nonprofit expert said it doesn’t matter because she could be using the organization’s resources for campaigning.\n\n“The time the person spends on the nonprofit and the political campaign — they have to be kept separate,” said Leslie Lenkowsky, a philanthropic studies professor at Indiana University. “If they coordinate with the campaign, then there’s a problem. It’s hard to imagine how they wouldn’t coordinate since it’s the same person.”\n\nThe IRS prohibits nonprofits from taking part directly or indirectly in political campaigns. State law bars nonprofits from making political donations or coordinating with campaigns with in-kind donations, said Jason Tait, spokesman for the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance.\n\n“If an officer of a campaign is also the officer of an organization supporting that campaign, then that would likely be coordination,” said Tait, who declined to comment on individual cases.\n\nPrisco-Buxbaum acknowledged that she works for Mass NOW, but said she was erroneously listed on the press releases.\n\n“That must have been a typo because that was written by our PAC,” she said. “There is a clear separation. I don’t indulge in political activities.”\n\nThe Mass NOW press releases that slammed Baker never mention the group’s political action committee.\n\nYesterday, the Mass NOW PAC endorsed Coakley and listed Katie Hayden, Mass NOW’s policy and operations manager and a PAC member, as media contact.\n\nHayden said Prisco-Buxbaum serves the nonprofit side — not the group’s PAC.\n\n“Katie’s activities on behalf of the Coakley campaign are not undertaken in her capacity as a Mass NOW volunteer or board member,” Hayden said.\n\nThe Coakley campaign and a spokeswoman for NOW’s national headquarters did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTait said campaign violations are handled on a case-by-case basis, but in 2012 a nonprofit agreed to pay the Office of Campaign and Political Finance a $22,500 settlement after a Baker campaign finance chairman funded a radio ad critical of Gov. Deval Patrick during the 2010 election.\n\nLenkowsky said when he was head of a think tank in the 1990s, he put a part-time staffer running for Congress on unpaid leave to avoid conflicts and set up strict rules for then-presidential candidates Lamar Alexander and Dan Quayle, who held unpaid posts but were associated with the think tank.\n\n“It is not illegal as long as they keep the financial records separate, but it’s kind of dumb,” Lenkowsky said. “Because the value of a group like NOW is they can say, ‘We are separate from the campaigns and you can trust us.’ It diminishes the organization’s credibility.”"
