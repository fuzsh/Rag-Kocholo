        "text": "Kant is regarded as one of the staunchest advocates of retributive punishment in the modern tradition. This essay makes the case that a careful reexamination of Kant's account of punishment is necessary, especially in light of liberalism's characteristic inability to give the powerful moral appeal of retribution its due. Kant attempted to provide a clear analysis of what we mean when we say that morality demands that punishment be “proportional” to the crime. According to Kant, punishment's retributive aspect—as distinguished from its deterrent or restorative effects—is primarily concerned with redeeming (negative) moral worth. This paper attempts to unpack this claim by examining Kant's discussions of judicial punishment, the conscience, and divine punishment, respectively. It concludes that as a result of serious unresolved difficulties in his arguments for retribution, Kant manages only to deepen the question of the morality of retribution rather than to give it a decisive answer.\n\n25 In the context, Kant anticipates the objection that equal retribution “is not possible in terms of the letter” in every single case. No one can take an eye for an eye from a blind man. Kant argues, however, that it is possible to remain true to the spirit of the principle, if not always to its letter. In his example, Kant suggests that when an innocent person has been insulted, the punishment of the offender can satisfy the demand of retributive justice, even if it does not take the exact same form as the original insult, as long as the offender is made to feel shame in proportion to the outrage he caused his victim. See MM, 6:332–33 (105–6).\n\n30 One might object that in the Doctrine of Right retributive punishment is concerned not with the ends of a criminal's choices, but merely with their “form” as they relate to the choices of others, as Kant appears to state in the context of his discussion of the principle of reciprocity (MM, 6:230 [23–24]). But in that context, Kant seems to be speaking only about reciprocal relations between persons insofar as their actions, “as facts,” can have influence on each other—that is, wholly as external phenomena—and does not intend to say anything about imputation, a subject with which he had already dealt earlier. (Cf. translator Mary Gregor's note c on p. 24.) It is hard to imagine what Kant could have in mind, if not the criminal's immoral ends, when he speaks of his “inner wickedness.”\n\nAn issue to which I cannot give adequate treatment here is why retribution must follow some immoral actions but not others. The answer, I believe, has to do with Kant's distinction between perfect and imperfect duties. Human beings are competent to punish transgressions of perfect duties, knowing that such transgressions are always morally culpable, whereas imperfect duties need not be violated just because our actions do not appear to conform to them.\n\n51 There is another passage that is often cited by Kant scholars as showing him to be espousing what is essentially a deterrence theory of punishment. In his posthumously published Lectures on Ethics, Kant says that “all punishments imposed by sovereigns and governments are pragmatic; they are designed either to correct or to make an example” (LE, “Reward and Punishment,” 55). While it is true that Kant is here saying that every punishment imposed by the state will necessarily be intended to correct or to make an example, he is not denying that such punishments may also meet the criteria of retribution—that is, by reflecting the crime as much as possible in kind and degree. Nevertheless, if in the final analysis there remains a real discrepancy between the two texts, more weight should be given to the Metaphysics of Morals, which was published in Kant's lifetime, as representing his mature view, than to his lectures, which were published without his supervision."
