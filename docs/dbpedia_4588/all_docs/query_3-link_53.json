        "text": "p-ADIC INTEGER was coined by Kurt Hensel (1861-1941) (Katz, page 824).\n\nThe p* FORMULA, also called Barndorff-Nielsen's formula, was introduced by Ole Barndorff-Nielsen in his article \"On a Formula for the Distribution of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator,\" Biometrika, 70, (1983), 343-365.\n\nP-VALUE and prob-value. David (1995) discusses the difficulties in dating P-value, the idea of which goes back to Laplace--at least--before opting for a reference from 1960! Subsequently David (1998) chose W. E. Deming's Statistical Adjustment of Data of 1943. When Deming wrote the phrase \"value of P\" was current. It was used in Karl Pearson's (1900) \"On the Criterion that a Given System of Deviations from the Probable in the Case of Correlated System of Variables is such that it can be Reasonably Supposed to have Arisen from Random Sampling\" (Philosophical Magazine, 50, 157-175) and used very heavily in R. A. Fisher's Statistical Methods for Research Workers (1925). The use of P-values (or prob-values) is often set against the use of fixed significance levels, especially 5%. It is ironical then that the \"value of P\" should feature so strongly in Fisher's book when that work also did so much to popularise the use of the 5% level. [John Aldrich]\n\nSee also SIGNIFICANCE and HYPOTHESIS AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING.\n\nPAIRWISE. A JSTOR search found the term in P. Jordan; J. v. Neumann; E. Wigner \"On an Algebraic Generalization of the Quantum Mechanical Formalism,\" Annals of Mathematics, 35, (1934), 29-64. The phrase \"a set of pairwise orthogonal unit elements\" appears on p. 35.\n\nPANGEOMETRY is the term Nicholas Lobachevsky (1796-1856) gave to his non-Euclidean geometry (Schwartzman, p. 157).\n\nPARABOLA was probably coined by Apollonius, who, according to Pappus, had terms for all three conic sections. Michael N. Fried says there are two known occasions where Archimedes used the terms \"parabola\" and \"ellipse,\" but that \"these are, most likely, later interpolations rather than Archimedes' own terminology.\"\n\nHowever, G. J. Toomer believes the names parabola and hyperbola are older than Apollonius, based on an Arabic translation of Diocles's On burning mirrors.\n\nPARABOLIC GEOMETRY. See hyperbolic geometry.\n\nPARACOMPACT. The term and the concept are due to J. DieudonnÃ© (1906-1992), who introduced them in Une gÃ©nÃ©ralisation des espaces compacts, J. Math. Pures Appl., 23 (1944) pp. 65-76. A topological space X is paracompact if (i) X is a Hausdorff space, and (ii) every open cover of X has an open refinement that covers X and which is locally finite. The usefulness of the concept comes almost entirely from condition (ii), while the role of condition (i) has been somewhat controversial. Thus, in his book General Topology (1955), John Kelley (p. 156) replaces (i) by the condition that X be regular (and his definition of regularity does not include the Hausdorff separation axiom), while some other authors do not even mention (i) in defining paracompactness. In any case, however, it is possible to state this important fact (conjectured by DieudonnÃ© in the paper above): every metric space is paracompact. This was proved by A. H. Stone in Paracompactness and product spaces, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., 54 (1948) 977-982. [This entry was contributed by Carlos CÃ©sar de AraÃºjo.]\n\nPARACONSISTENT LOGIC. The first formal calculus of inconsistency-tolerant logic was constructed by the Polish logician Stanislaw Jaskowski, who published his paper \"Propositional calculus for contradictory deductive systems\" (in Polish) in Studia Societatis Scientiarum Torunensis, 55--77 in 1948. It was reprinted in English in Studia Logica 24, 143--157 (1969).\n\nNewton Carneiro Affonso da Costa, one of the most prominent researchers in paraconsistent logic, referred to it as inconsistent formal systems in his 1964 thesis, which used that term as its title. [See the introduction of the work \"Sistemas Formais Inconsistentes\", Newton C. A. da Costa, Editora da UFPr, Curitiba, 1993, p. viii. This work is a reprint of the Prof. Newton's original 1964 thesis, the initial landmark of all studies in the matter.\n\nThe term paraconsistent logic was coined in 1976 by the Peruvian philosopher Francisco MirÃ³ Quesada, during the Terceiro Congresso Latino Americano.\n\n[Manoel de Campos Almeida, Max Urchs]\n\nPARADOX is a label fixed to many arguments in Mathematics. See e.g. BANACH-TARSKI PARADOX, HAUSDORFF PARADOX, RUSSELL'S PARADOX, ST. PETERSBURG PARADOX, SIMPSON'S PARADOX, ZENO'S PARADOXES.\n\nParadox (from the Greek for contrary to received opinion) is an exasperatingly ambiguous word and it is not unusual to read statements like, \"This is not a paradox at all, the only reason that it is given this name is that it is counter-intuitive.\" W. V. Quine Ways of Paradox (1966) classifies paradoxes, distinguishing 3 types:\n\nA veridical paradox produces a result that appears absurd but is demonstrated to be true nevertheless. E.g. SIMPSON'S PARADOX.\n\nA falsidical paradox produces a result that not only appears false but actually is false; there is a fallacy in the argument. E.g. ZENO'S PARADOXES.\n\nAn antinomy (from the Greek for against law) produces a self-contradiction by accepted ways of reasoning. E.g. RUSSELL'S PARADOX.\n\nThe examples are taken from these pages. The placing of a paradox can be a matter of dispute. Quine notes, \"One man's antinomy can be another man's veridical paradox, and one man's veridical paradox can be another man's platitude.\" For further discussion see BANACH-TARSKI PARADOX and HAUSDORFF PARADOX.\n\nParadoxes have been discussed since antiquity; see the LIAR PARADOX. In the Middle Ages variants of the Liar paradox were studied under the heading insolubilia (W. & M. Kneale The Development of Logic (1962) pp. 227-8). The early 20th century with its disputes on set theory and logic was the great age for paradoxes. Amongst the antinomies discovered then were those of BURALI-FORTI, RUSSELL and RICHARD.\n\nLogical and semantic paradoxes. F. P. Ramsey pointed out that the \"contradictions fall into two fundamentally distinct groups.\" (\"Foundations of Mathematics\" in Foundations of Mathematics and Other Essays (1931, pp. 20-1)) Ramsey's Type A are now called the logical paradoxes and his Type B the semantic paradoxes: RUSSELL'S PARADOX is an example of the first and RICHARD'S PARADOX an example of the second. A JSTOR search found the logical/semantic terminology in use in W. V. Quine's review of The New Logic by Karl Menger et al. in the Journal of Symbolic Logic, 3, (1938), p. 48.\n\nThis entry was contributed by John Aldrich.\n\nPARALLEL appears in English in 1549 in Complaynt of Scotlande, vi. 47: \"Cosmaghraphie ... sal delcair the eleuatione of the polis, and the lynis parallelis, and the meridian circlis\" (OED2).\n\nPARALLELEPIPED. According to Smith (vol. 2, page 292), \"Although it is a word that would naturally be used by Greek writers, it is not found before the time of Euclid. It appears in the Elements (XI, 25) without definition, in the form of 'sparallelepipedal solid,'s the meaning being left to be inferred from that of the word 'sparallelogrammic's as given in Book I.\"\n\nParallelipipedon appears in English in 1570 in Sir Henry Billingsley's translation of Euclid's Elements.\n\nIn the 1644 edition of his Cursus mathematicus (in Latin), Pierre Herigone used the spelling parallelepipedum.\n\nThe first citation in the OED2 with the shortened spelling parallelepiped is Walter Charleton (1619-1707), Chorea gigantum, or, The most famous antiquity of Great-Britain, vulgarly called Stone-heng : standing on Salisbury Plain, restored to the Danes, London : Printed for Henry Herringman, 1663.\n\nCharles Hutton's Dictionary (1795) shows parallelopiped and parallelopipedon.\n\nIn Noah Webster's A compendious dictionary of the English language (1806) the word is spelled parallelopiped.\n\nMathematical Dictionary and Cyclopedia of Mathematical Science (1857) has parallelopipedon.\n\nU. S. dictionaries show the pronunciation with the stress on the\n\npenult, but some also show a second pronunciation with the stress on the antepenult.\n\nPARALLELOGRAM appears in English in 1570 in Sir Henry Billingsley's translation of Euclid's Elements (OED2).\n\nIn 1832 Elements of Geometry and Trigonometry by David Brewster, which is a translation of Legendre, has:\n\nThe word parallelogram, according to its etymology, signifies parallel lines; it no more suits the figure of four sides than it does that of six, of eight, &c. which have their opposite sides parallel. In like manner, the word parallelopipedon signifies parallel planes; it no more designates the solid with six faces, than the solid with eight, ten, &c. of which the opposite faces are parallel. The names parallelogram and parallelelopipedon*, have the additional inconvenience of being very long. Perhaps, therefore, it would be advantageous to banish them altogether from geometry; and to substitute in their stead, the names rhombus and rhomboid, retaining the term lozenge, for quadrilaterals whose sides are all equal.\n\n*The word is misspelled this way in Brewster.\n\nPARAMETER. Claude Mydorge used the word parameter with the meaning of \"latus rectum\" on page 3 of \"Prodromi catoptricorum et dioptricorum sive conicorum operis libri primus et secundus,\" Paris 1631. [Alessio Martini, Siegmund Probst]\n\nA reference to Mydorge's term is in Frans van Schooten, \"In geometriam Renati Descartes commentarii,\" 1659, printed in: Geometria, a Renato Des Cartes anno 1637 gallice edita, postea autem una cum notis Florimondi de Beaune (...) in latinam linguam versa et commentariis illustrata opera atque studio Francisci a Schooten (...) Nunc demum ab eodem diligenter recognita, locupletorioribus commentariis instructa, multisque egregiis accessionibus (...) exornata. 2 vols. Amsterdam 1659-1661, vol. I, p. 208.\n\nAccording to Kline (page 340), parameter was introduced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716). He used the term in 1692 in Acta Eruditorum 11 (Struik, page 272). Kline used the term in its modern sense. According to Siegmund Probst, Frans van Schooten is probably the source that Leibniz used (numerous references since 1673); starting in 1673 Leibniz used parameter for constants in formulas with variables, e.g. equations of curves or series. See Leibniz volumes VII,3 VII,4 VII,5.\n\nPARAMETER (in statistics) Although parameter had been used by earlier writers--David (2001) cites J. C. Kapteyn Skew Frequency Curves in Biology and Statistics (1903)--it was established as the standard term by R. A. Fisher. He introduced it, along with many other terms, in \"On the Mathematical Foundations of Theoretical Statistics\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Ser. A. 222, (1922) 309-368.\n\nParameter arrived with statistic for Fisher saw the need for two terms (p. 311):\n\nit has happened that in statistics a purely verbal confusion has hindered the distinct formulation of statistical problems; for it is customary to apply the same name, mean, standard deviation, correlation coefficient, etc. both to the true value which we should like to know but can only estimate, and to the particular value at which we arrive by our method of estimation ...\n\nWith the new terms Fisher could write, \"Problems of Estimation ... involve the choice of methods of calculating from a sample ... statistics, which are designed to estimate the values of the parameters of the hypothetical population.\" (p. 313) He would recall, \"I was quite deliberate in choosing unlike words for these ideas which it was important to distinguish as clearly as possible.\" (letter (p. 81) in J. H. Bennett Statistical Inference and Analysis: Selected Correspondence of R. A. Fisher (1990)).\n\nParameter did not replace any existing standard term. Fisher had used \"arbitrary element\" (1912) and \"population-character\" (1921), while Karl Pearson's \"frequency-constant\" could mean either a parameter or a statistic.\n\nWhile Fisher's use of statistic was criticised (See entry on Statistic), parameter fell in with an established usage, which the OED2 traces to the mid-nineteenth century, viz. \"a quantity which is constant (as distinct from the ordinary variables) in a particular case considered, but which varies in different cases.\"\n\nThe use of the terms parametric and nonparametric for different kinds of hypotheses dates from the 1940s. See the entry NONPARAMETRIC.\n\nSee also STATISTIC and NUISANCE PARAMETER AND PARAMETER OF INTEREST.\n\n[This entry was contributed by John Aldrich, using Hald (1998).]\n\nPARAMETRIC EQUATION is found in 1894 in \"On the Singularities of the Modular Equations and Curves\" by John Stephen Smith in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society [University of Michigan Historical Math Collection].\n\nPARETO DISTRIBUTION, PARETO'S LAW. In the 1890s the economist Vilfredo Pareto (1843-1925) found a pattern in the way incomes were distributed within countries. \"La courbe des revenus\" is given by\n\nlogâ¡N=logâ¡AâÎ±logâ¡x\\log N = \\log A - \\alpha \\log xlogN=logAâÎ±logx\n\nwhere N is the number of individuals with incomes higher than x, and A and Î± are constants. In his Cours d'sÃ©conomie politique (1897) Pareto described the curve and provided evidence of its wide applicability. Economists were soon referring to Pareto's \"law of the distribution of income\" though they did not necessarily agree that it constituted a law; see e.g. Henry L. Moore \"The Statistical Complement of Pure Economics,\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, 23, (1908), 1-33. The formula can be rewritten as a frequency distribution and statisticians found it natural to refer to \"Pareto's distribution;\" see e.g. J. O. Irwin \"Recent Advances in Mathematical Statistics (1934),\" Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 99, (1936), 714-769. [John Aldrich]\n\nPARTIAL DERIVATIVE and PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL. Partial derivatives appear in the writings of Newton and Leibniz.\n\nPartial differential equation was used in 1770 by Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet (1743-1794) in the title \"Memoire sur les Equations aux diffÃ©rence partielles,\" which was published in Histoire de L'Academie Royale des Sciences, pp. 151-178, Annee M. DCCLâ:III (1773).\n\nPartial differential equation appears in English in 1809 in a letter from \"Mr. Thomas Knight, Of Papcastle, near Cockermouth\" in The Mathematical Repository, New Series, Volume III (1809). The same issue of The Mathematical Repository contains the expression partial fluxion. [James A. Landau]\n\nAn early use of the term partial derivative in English is in an 1834 paper by Sir William Rowan Hamilton [James A. Landau].\n\nPartial differential equation is found in English in 1820 in A Collection of Examples of the Applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus by George Peacock: \"Given a solution of a partial differential equation, to find whether it is included in the general solution or not.\" [Google print search]\n\nSee the Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus page.\n\nPARTIAL FRACTION. Fraction partielle occurs in Legendre's 1792 paper MÃ©moire Sur Les Transcendantes Elliptiques: \"que chaque fraction partielle soit de la forme N/(1+nsinâ¡2Ï)kN/(1+n \\sin ^{2}\\phi)^{k}N/(1+nsin2Ï)k, nnn et NNN Ã©tant des coÃ©fficiens constans reels ou imaginaires.\"\n\nIn English partial fraction appears in the 1809 translation of Legendre's 1792 paper, which translates the above French text as \"that every partial fraction shall be of the form N/(1+nsinâ¡2Ï)kN/(1+n \\sin ^{2}\\phi)^{k}N/(1+nsin2Ï)k, nnn and NNN being constant coefficients, real or imaginary.\"\n\n[James A. Landau]\n\nPARTIAL PRODUCT is found in English in an 1822 translation of Elements of Algebra by Euler. [Google print search]\n\nPARTICULAR SOLUTION is found in\n\n1735-6 Phil. Trans. 39, 325:\n\nIn the Author's second Problem, or the Relation of the Fluxions being given to determine the Relation of the Fluents,..he [sc. Newton] begins with a particular Solution of it. He calls this Solution particular, because it extends only to such Cases, wherein the given Fluxional Equation either has been, or might have been, derived from some previous finite Algebraical Equation.\n\nThe above is a report of a hitherto unpublished work by Newton in Latin [Alan Hughes].\n\nThe term particular case of the general integral is due to Lagrange (Kline, page 532).\n\nParticular integral is found in English in 1814 in New Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary by P. Barlow:\n\nParticular Integral, in the Integral Calculus, is that which arises in the integration of any differential equation, by giving a particular value to the arbitrary quantity or quantities that enter into the general integral (OED2).\n\nThe name PASCAL'S TRIANGLE is a tribute to Blaise Pascal's TraitÃ© du triangle arithmÃ©tique (Cambridge University) of 1654. Behind the TraitÃ© were many related investigations spanning many centuries and many countries and the triangle has had several names, e.g. in Italy it is called after Nicolo Tartaglia (1499-1547). The story of the triangle(s) is told in A. W. F. Edwards's Pascal's Arithmetical Triangle. Because the TraitÃ© \"brought together all the different aspects of the numbers\" Edwards concludes, \"that the Arithmetical Triangle should bear Pascal's name cannot be disputed.\"\n\nMontmort (Essay d'sanalysis sur les jeux de hazard, 1708) was the first to attach Pascal's name to the triangle, \"Table de M. Pascal pour les combinaisons,\"Â while De Moivre (Miscellanea analytica, 1730) used the expression \"Triangulum Arithmeticum PASCALIANUM.\"Â (From Edwards op. cit.) Montmort and De Moivre both wrote on probability and the application of the triangle to this field was an important new element in the TraitÃ©. Indeed the TraitÃ© was one of the founding works of probability.\n\nArithmetical triangle of Pascal is found in Ed. Lucas, \"Note sur le triangle arithmÃ©tique de Pascal et sur la sÃ©rie de LamÃ©, N. C. M. (1876). Pascal's triangle appears in 1886 in Algebra by George Chrystal (1851-1911).\n\nWhile triangle research in Western Europe only gained momentum in the Renaissance, there was much earlier work in India, Persia and China. In India there was a tradition beginning with Pingala (ca 200BC). His rule for finding the number of combinations, known as the Meru Prastara (Staircase of Mount Meru), was put into triangular form by the 10th century AD. (Roger Cooke and Edwards op. cit.)\n\nIn Persia and China the binomial theorem seems to have been discovered around 1100. In China the triangle is called Yang Hui's triangle. The Pascal's triangle as depicted in A.D. 1303Â tabulates the binomial coefficients up to the eighth power. See Materials for the History of Statistics for the full reference.\n\n(Based on Edwards's Pascal's Arithmetical Triangle.)\n\nSee the entries on COMBINATION and PROBABILITY.\n\nPASCAL'S WAGER, an argument for acting as if one believed in God, has been claimed as \"the first well-understood contribution to decision theory\" (Hacking (1975, ch. 8)). The argument was published in the PensÃ©es, a work assembled from Pascal's notes after his death; see Infinite--nothing (Â§233). The argument was discussed by Leibniz, Locke, Voltaire and Diderot as well as by religious writers. The argument never became part of the probability literature but it received renewed attention in the 20th century with the rise of decision theory. See Pascal's wager in the Stanford Encyclopedia.\n\nA Google print search finds Pascal's wager in 1896 in The New World: A Quarterly Review of Religion, Ethics, and Theology, volume 5: \"In Pascal's Thoughts there is a celebrated passage known in literature as Pascal's wager.\"\n\nPATH ANALYSIS is the modern term for what Sewall Wright called the method of path coefficients in his paper \"Correlation and Causation,\" Journal of Agricultural Research, 20, (1921), 557-585. Wright introduced the method as follows, \"In the biological sciences, especially, one often has to deal with a group of characteristics or conditions which are correlated because of a complex of interacting, uncontrollable, and often obscure causes.... The present paper is an attempt to present a method of measuring the direct influence along each separate path in such a system and thus of finding the degree to which variation of a given effect is determined by each particular cause.\" (p. 557) The term path analysis seems to have become common only around 1960. (JSTOR search.)\n\nPATHOLOGICAL as \"satisfying the conditions of a theory or theorem but contrary to intuition as to the general nature of the objects concerned, and therefore regarded as bizarre or defective.\" (Borowski and Borwein)\n\nThe word has been in English as a medical term since the 17th century but its use as a mathematical term of art appears to date from the 1930s. A JSTOR search found Murray and von Neumann writing in \"On Rings of Operators,\" Annals of Mathematics, 37, (1936), p. 227 of another \"pathological\" possibility. The authors put quotes around the word but they quickly became superfluous. The OED's earliest citation is from I. S. Sokolnikoff Advanced Calculus (1939): \"Such pathological behavior of continuous functions led to a careful inquiry into the meaning of such geometrical concepts as the area under a curve.\"m [John Aldrich]\n\nSee the entry WELL-BEHAVED.\n\nPAULI MATRICES are named after the physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who used them in his \"Zur Quantenmechanik des magnetischen Elektrons,\" Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Physik, 43, (1927), p. 60. However they had appeared long before in Cayley's \"A Memoir on the Theory of Matrices\" (1858) Coll Math Papers, II, 475-96. In paragraph 45 (p. 491) Cayley writes that these matrices satisfy a system of relations \"precisely similar to that in the theory of quaternions.\" See the Encyclopedia of Mathematics entry on Pauli matrices.\n\nSee MATRIX, MATRIX MECHANICS and QUATERNIONS.\n\nPEANO'S AXIOMS for arithmetic were presented by Giuseppe Peano in Arithmetices Principia (1889) translated from the Latin in Heijenoort (1967, pp. 83-107). Grattan-Guinness (2000, p. 228) notes that, while Peano refers to Dedekind's booklet Was sind und Was sollen die Zahlen? (1887) Works, 3, 335-391, he later said he had found his axiom system independently. B. Russell Principles of Mathematics (1903) refers to \"Peano's primitive propositions.\"\n\nThe PEANO CURVE was presented by Peano in \"Sur une courbe, qui remplit une aire plane.\" Math. Ann. 36, 157-160, 1890. Alas there are no diagrams!\n\nThe term PEANO-GOSPER CURVE was coined by Mandelbrot in 1977 in Fractals: Form, chance, and dimension. See Mathworld.\n\nPEANO-HILBERT CURVE is found in December 1901 in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society. [Google print search by James A. Landau]\n\nPEARLS OF SLUZE. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) named the family of curves to honor Baron RenÃ© FranÃ§ois de Sluze, who studied the curves (Encyclopaedia Britannica article: \"Geometry\").\n\nThe PEARSON system of CURVES (describing probability distributions) was introduced by Karl Pearson in his \"Contributions to the Mathematical Theory of Evolution. II. Skew Variation in Homogeneous Material,\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, 186, (1895), 343-414. The curves were originally classified into Types I to IV but over the years the number of types and their definitions changed. References to \"Professor Pearson's Type III\" can found in G. U. Yule \"Notes on the History of Pauperism in England and Wales from 1850 ... \" Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 59, (1896), p. 324 or in Student (1908, p. 4). R. A. Fisher (1915, p. 520) refers to the \"Pearson curves.\" [John Aldrich]\n\nSee also BETA DISTRIBUTION, CAUCHY DISTRIBUTION, and GAMMA DISTRIBUTION.\n\nThe term PEDAL CURVES is due to Olry Terquem (1782-1862) (Cajori 1919, page 228).\n\nPELL'S EQUATION was so named by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in a paper of 1732-1733, even though Pell had only copied the equation from Fermat's letters (Burton, page 504) of 1657 and 1658.\n\nThe following is taken from Sir Thomas L. Heath, Diophantus of Alexandria: A Study in the History of Greek Algebra, page 285-286:\n\nFermat rediscovered the problem and was the first to assert that the equation x2âAy2=1x^{2} - Ay^{2} = 1x2âAy2=1, where A is any integer not a square, always has an unlimited number of solutions in integers. His statement was made in a letter to FrÃ©nicle of February, 1657 (cf. Oeuvres de Fermat, II, pp. 333-4). Fermat asks FrÃ©nicle for a general rule for finding, when any number not a square is given, squares which, when they are respectively multiplied by the given number and unity is added to the product, give squares. If, says Fermat, FrÃ©nicle cannot give a general rule, will he give the smallest value of y which will satisfy the equations 61y2+1=x261y^{2} + 1 = x^{2}61y2+1=x2 and 109y2+1=x2109y^{2} + 1 = x^{2}109y2+1=x2? ...\n\nThe challenge was taken up in England by William, Viscount Brouncker, first President of the Royal Society, and Wallis. At first, owing apparently to some misunderstanding, they thought that only rational, and not necessarily integral solutions were wanted, and found of course no difficulty in solving this easy problem. Fermat was, naturally, not satisfied with this solution, and Brouncker, attacking the problem again, finally succeeded in solving it. The method is set out in letters of Wallis of 17th December, 1657, and 30th January, 1658, and in chapter XCVIII of Wallis's Algebra; Euler also explains it fully in his Algebra (Footnote 3: Part II, chap. VII), wrongly attributing it to Pell (Footnote 4: This was the origin of the erroneous description of our equation as the \"Pellian\" equation.\n\nHankel (in Zur Geschichte der Math. im Alterthum und Mittlelalter, p. 203) supposed that the equation was so called because the solution was reproduced by Pell in an English translation (1668) by Thomas Brancker of Rahn's Algebra; but this is a misapprehension, as the so-called \"Pellian\" equation is not so much as mentioned in Pell's additions (Wertheim in Bibliotheca Mathematica, III, 1902, pp. 124-6); Konen, pp. 33-4 note). The attribution of the solution to Pell as a pure mistake of Euler's, probably due to a cursory reading by him of the second volume of Wallis's Opera where the solution of the equation ax2+1=y2ax^{2} + 1 = y^{2}ax2+1=y2 is given as well as information as to Pell's work in indeterminate analysis. But Pell is not mentioned in connexion with the equation at all (EnestrÃ¶m in Bibliotheca Mathematica, III, 1902, p. 206).\n\nThe following is taken from Harold M. Edwards, Fermat's Last Theorem: A Genetic Introduction to Algebraic Number Theory, page 33:\n\nThis problem of Fermat is now known as \"Pell's equation\" as a result of a mistake on the part of Euler. In some way, perhaps from a confused recollection of Wallis's Algebra, Euler gained the mistaken impression that Wallis attributed the method of solving the problem not to Brouncker but to Pell, a contemporary of Wallis who is frequently mentioned in Wallis's works but who appears to have had nothing to do with the solution of Fermat's problem. Euler mentions this mistaken impression as early as 1730, when he was only 23 years old, and it is included in his definitive Introduction to Algebra written around 1770. Euler was the most widely read mathematical writer of his time, and the method from that time on has been associated with the name of Pell and the problem that it solved -- that of finding all integer solutions of y2âAx2=1y^{2} - Ax^{2} = 1y2âAx2=1 when A is a given number not a square -- has been known ever since as \"Pell's equation\", despite the fact that it was Fermat who first indicated the importance of the problem and despite the fact that Pell had nothing whatever to do with it.\n\nThese quotations were provided by Raul Nunes to a mathematics history mailing list.\n\nThe 1910 Encyclopaedia Britannica has: \"Although Pell had nothing to do with the solution, posterity has termed the equation Pell's Equation\" (OED2).\n\nPENCIL OF LINES. Desargues coined the term ordonnance de lignes, which is translated an order of lines or a pencil of lines [James A. Landau].\n\nPENTAGON. Pentagons are discussed in Book IV of Euclid's Elements. The word \"pentagon\" appears in English in 1570 in Sir Henry Billingsley's translation of the Elements. (OED) Earlier in 1551 in Pathway to Knowledge Robert Recorde introduced the word cinqueangle: \"Defin., Figures of .v. sydes, other v. corners, which we may call cinkangles, whose sydes partlye are all equall as in A, and those are counted ruled cinkeangles\" (OED). See EQUILATERAL and HEXAGON. [John Aldrich]\n\nPENTAGRAM is found in English in 1825 in a translation of Faust. [Google print search]\n\nThe term PENTOMINO was coined by Solomon W. Golomb, who used the term in a 1953 talk to the Harvard Math Club. According to an Internet web page, the term was trademarked in 1975. (The first known pentomino problem is found in Canterbury Puzzles in 1907.)\n\nPERCENTILE appears in 1885 in Francis Galton, 'Some results of the Anthropometric Laboratory.'s Journal of the Anthropological Institute, 14, 275-287: \"The value which 50 per cent. exceeded, and 50 per cent. fell short of, is the Median Value, or the 50th per-centile, and this is practically the same as the Mean Value; its amount is 85 lbs.\" (p. 276) (OED2).\n\nAccording to Hald (p. 604), Galton introduced the term.\n\nPERFECT NUMBER. According to Smith (vol. 2, page 21), the\n\nPythagoreans used this term in another sense, because apparently 10 was considered by them to be a perfect number.\n\nProposition 36 of Book IX of Euclid's Elements is: \"If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit be set out continuously in double proportion, until the sum of all becomes a prime, and if the sum multiplied into the last make some number, the product will be perfect.\"\n\nThe Greek poet and grammarian Euphorion (born c. 275 BC?) used the phrase \". . . equal to his [or their] limbs, with the result that they are called perfect.\" This is an apparent reference to perfect numbers, according to J. L. Lightfoot, \"An early reference to perfect numbers? Some notes on Euphorion, SH 417,\" Classical quarterly 48 (1998), 187-194.\n\nThe term was used by Nicomachus around A. D. 100 in Introductio Arithmetica (Burton, page 475). One translation is:\n\nAmong simple even numbers, some are superabundant, others are deficient: these two classes are as two extremes opposed to one another; as for those that occupy the middle position between the two, they are said to be perfect.\n\nNichomachus identified 6, 28, 496, and 8128 as perfect numbers.\n\nSt. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) wrote De senarii numeri perfectione (\"Of the perfection of the number six\") in De Civitate Dei. He wrote, in translation: \"Six is a number perfect in itself, and not because God created the world in six days; rather the contrary is true. God created the world in six days because this number is perfect, and it would remain perfect, even if the work of the six days did not exist.\"\n\nPerfect number appears in English in 1570 in Sir Henry Billingsley's translation of Euclid.\n\nIn 1674, Samuel Jeake wrote in Arithmetic (1696) \"Perfect Numbers are almost as rare as perfect Men\" (OED2).\n\nPERFECT SETS.Â Georg Cantor introduced perfecte Punktmengen (perfect point-sets) in his article \"Ã¼ber unendliche, lineare Punktmannichfaltigkeiten 5,\" Mathematische Annalen, 21 (1883), p. 576. For an account see J. W. Dauben Georg Cantor (1979, pp. 110ff). The French expression appears in a translation, Cantor's \"De la puissance des ensembles parfaits de points,\" Acta Mathematica 4 (1884), 381-392. A JSTOR search found the English term perfect set in W. F. Osgood \"Non-Uniform Convergence and the Integration of Series Term by Term,\" American Journal of Mathematics, 19, (1897) p. 188.\n\nThis entry was contributed by John Aldrich. See also SET and SET THEORY.\n\nPERIODOGRAM. Arthur Schuster introduced the term periodogram in \"On the Investigation of Hidden Periodicities with Application to a Supposed 26 Day Period of Meteorological Phenomena,\" Terrestial Magnetism, 3, (1898), 13-41. He had already used the technique in his \"On Lunar and Solar Periodicities of Earthquakes,\" Proceedings of the Royal Society, 61, (1897), 455-465 and the theory was related to his research on optics, \"On Interference Phenomena,\" Philosophical Magazine, 37, 509-545. (David 2001)\n\nSee also HARMONIC ANALYSIS.\n\nPERMANENT (of a square matrix). In a paper written with M. Marcus (\"Permanents\", Amer. Math. Monthly, 1965, p. 577) Henryk Minc, one of the great authorities in permanents, wrote:\n\nThe name \"permanent\" seems to have originated in Cauchy's memoir of 1812 [B 3]. Cauchy's \"fonctions symÃ©triques permanentes\" designate any symmetric function. Some of these, however, were permanents in the sense of the definition (1.1). (...) As far as we are aware the name \"permanent\" as defined in (1.1) was introduced by Muir [B 38].\n\nThe paper by T. Muir is \"On a class of permanent symmetric functions\", Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh, 11 (1882) 409-418. [B3] is \"MÃ©moire sur les fonctions Qui ne peuvent obtenir que deux valeurs Ã©gales et de signes contraires par suite des transpositions opÃ©rÃ©es entre les variables qu'selles renferment\", J. de l'sÃ©c. Polyt., 10 (1812) 29-112.\n\nAccording to J. H. van Lint in \"The van der Waerden Conjecture: Two Proofs in One Year\", The Mathematical Intelligencer:\n\nIn his book Permanents [9] H. Minc mentions that the name permanent is essentially due to Cauchy (1812) although the word as such was first used by Muir in 1882. Nevertheless a referee of one of Minc's earlier papers admonished him for inventing this ludicrous name!\n\n[This entry was contributed by Carlos CÃ©sar de AraÃºjo.]\n\nPERMUTATION. Leibniz used the term variationes and Wallis adopted alternationes (Smith vol. 2, page 528).\n\nIn 1678 Thomas Strode, A Short Treatise of the Combinations, Elections, Permutations & Composition of Quantities, has: \"By Variations, permutation or changes of the Places of Quantities, I mean, how many several ways any given Number of Quantities may be changed.\" [OED]\n\nLexicon Technicum, or an universal English dictionary of arts and sciences (1710) has: \"Variation, or Permutation of Quantities, is the changing any number of given Quantities, with respect to their Places.\" [OED]\n\nAccording to Smith vol. 2, page 528, permutation first appears in print with its present meaning in Ars Conjectandi by Jacques Bernoulli: \"De Permutationibus. Permutationes rerum voco variationes...\" This seems to be incorrect.\n\n[Mark Thakkar contributed to this entry.]\n\nThe term PERMUTATION GROUP was coined by Galois (DSB, article: \"Lagrange\").\n\nPermutation group appears in English in W. Burnside, \"On the representation of a group of finite order as a permutation group, and on the composition of permutation groups,\" London M. S. Proc. 34.\n\nThe term PERMUTATION TEST appears in G. E. P. Box and S. L. Andersen \"Permutation Theory in the Derivation of Robust Criteria and the Study of Departures from Assumption,\" Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B, 17, (1955), p. 3. They use the term for a \"remarkable new class of tests\" introduced by R. A. Fisher in The Design of Experiments (1935) and quote from p. 51 of this book:Â Â\n\nIt seems to have escaped recognition that the physical act of randomisation, which, as has been shown, is necessary for the validity of any test of significance, affords the means, in respect of any particular body of data, of examining the wider hypothesis in which no normality of distribution is implied.\n\n(David 2001)\n\nPERPENDICULAR was used in English by Chaucer about 1391 in A Treatise on the Astrolabe. The term is used as a geometry term in 1570 in Sir Henry Billingsley's translation of Euclid's Elements.\n\nPERRON-FROBENIUS THEOREM. This result (or collection of results) is named for Oskar Perron \"Zur Theorie der Matrizen\" Math. Ann., 64 (1907) pp. 248-263 andÂ Georg FrobeniusÂ \"Ãber Matrizen aus nicht negativen Elementen\" Sitzungsber. KÃ¶nigl. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. (1912) pp. 456-477.Â See the entry in Encyclopedia of Mathematics.\n\nPETERS' FORMULA or METHOD for estimating the standard deviation of the normal distribution using absolute deviations from the mean was widely used by astronomers in the 19th century. The method was proposed by Christian August Friedrich Peters in his \"Ã¼ber die Bestimmung des wahrscheinlichen Fehlers einer Beobachtung aus den Abweichungen der Beobachtungen von ihrem arithmetischen Mittel,\" Astronomische Nachrichten, 44, (1856), 29-32. R. A. Fisher examined Peters' method (mean error method) in his paper A Mathematical Examination of the Methods of Determining the Accuracy of an Observation by the Mean Error, and by the Mean Square Error (1920) and concluded that it was inferior to the mean square error method. See the entries HELMERT TRANSFORMATION, SUFFICIENCY and EFFICIENCY.\n\nThe term PFAFFIAN was introduced by Arthur Cayley, who used the term in 1852: \"The permutants of this class (from their connexion with the researches of Pfaff on differential equations) I shall term 'sPfaffians's.\" The term honors Johann Friedrich Pfaff (1765-1825).\n\nPIECEWISE is found in 1933 in the phrase \"vectors which are only piecewise differentiable\" in Vector Analysis by H. B. Phillips (OED2).\n\nThe name PIE CHART is found in 1922 in A. C. Haskell, Graphic Charts in Business (OED2). Pie charts only became common in the 20th century but they seem to have been first used by William Playfair in 1801. See that date in Milestones in the History of Thematic Cartography, Statistical Graphics, and Data Visualization 1800-1849.\n\nPIGEONHOLE PRINCIPLE. The principle itself is attributed to Dirichlet in 1834, although he apparently used the term Schubfachprinzip.\n\nIn Dirichlet's Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Zahlentheorie (Lectures on Number Theory, prepared for publication by Dedekind, first edition 1863), the argument is used in connection with Pell's equation but it bears no specific name [Peter Flor, Gunnar Berg].\n\nIn 1905 in Bachmann's \"Zahlentheorie,\" part 5, the principle is stated as a \"very simple fact\" on which Dirichlet is said to have based his theory of units in number fields; no name is attached to the principle [Peter Flor].\n\nIn 1910 in Geometrie der Zahlen, Minkowski calls it \"a famous method of Dirichlet\" [Peter Flor].\n\nAccording to Peter Flor, \"the term Schubfachschluss, with or without a reference to Dirichlet, was used widely by German speaking number theorists at the universities of Vienna and Hamburg when I studied there in the 1950s. It occurs, among others, in the number theory books by Hasse and by Aigner.\"\n\nIn Swedish, the principle is called (in translation) \"Dirichlets box principle\" [Gunnar Berg]. The French term is \"le principe des tiroirs de Dirichlet,\" which can be translated \"the principle of the drawers of Dirichlet.\" In Portuguese, the term is \"principio da casa dos pombos\" (lit. principle of the house of the pigeons) or \"das gavetas de Dirichlet\" (lit. of the drawers of Dirichlet) [Julio GonzÃ¡lez CabillÃ³n].\n\nPigeonhole principle occurs in English in Raphael M. Robinson's paper \"On the Simultaneous Approximation of Two Real Numbers,\" presented to the American Mathematical Society on November 23, 1940, and published in the Bulletin of the Society in 1941. Cf. volume 47, pp 512-513. In a footnote to this article, Robinson states:\n\nThe method used in this proof (Schubfachprinzip or \"pigeonhole principle\") was first used by Dirichlet in connection with a similar problem. We sketch the proof here in order to compare it with the proof of the theorem below, which also uses that method.\n\nThis citation was provided by Julio GonzÃ¡lez CabillÃ³n.\n\nPaul ErdÅs referred to Dedekind's pigeon-hole principle in \"Combinatorial Problems in Set Theory,\" an address he delivered in 1953 before the AMS [Julio GonzÃ¡lez CabillÃ³n].\n\nPigeon-hole principle occurs in English in Paul ErdÅs and R. Rado, \"A partition calculus in set theory,\" Bull. Am. Math. Soc. 62 (Sept. 1956):\n\nDedekind's pigeon-hole principle, also known as the box argument or the chest of drawers argument (Schubfachprinzip) can be described, rather vaguely, as follows. If sufficiently many objects are distributed over not too many classes, then at least one class contains many of these objects.\n\nE. C. Milner and R. Rado, \"The pigeon-hole principle for ordinal numbers,\" Proc. Lond. Math. Soc., III. Ser. 15 (Oct., 1965) begins similarly:\n\nDirichlet's pigeon-hole principle (chest-of-drawers principle, Schubfachprinzip) asserts, roughly, that if a large number of objects is distributed in any way over not too many classes, then one of these classes contains many of these objects.\n\nPIVOT, PIVOTAL ELEMENT, PIVOTAL CONDENSATION, ETC. in numerical linear algebra. This terminology for Gaussian elimination was introduced by the Edinburgh mathematicians, E. T. Whittaker and his student A. C. Aitken. OED2 gives the following quotations: from Whittaker and G. Robinson's Calculus of Observations (1924) v. 71 \"We prepare the determinant for our subsequent operations by multiplying some row or column by such a number p as will make one of the elements unity, and put 1/p as a factor outside the determinant. This unit element will henceforth be called the pivotal element.\"; from Aitken writing in Proc. Edin. Math. Soc. III, (1933) 211 \"At Stage II we choose another pivot at will ... and cross-multiply with respect to it in the same way, dividing each result, however, by the previous pivot ....\"; from Aitken's Determinants & Matrices (1939) ii. 47 \"A determinant of order n being reduced by a first pivotal condensation to one of order n-1, the latter in its turn can be reduced by a second pivotal condensation to one of order n-2, and so on\" [John Aldrich].\n\nPIVOTAL in Statistics. The term was introduced by R. A. Fisher in his \"The Asymptotic Approach to Behrens's Integral, with Further Tables for the d Test of Significance\", Annals of Eugenics, 11, (1941), 141-172. Fisher wrote, \"In Student's test the quantity t appears in two roles. First, it is the pivotal quantity the distribution of which is independent of the population sampled, and the distribution of which is therefore accepted for the particular sample under consideration ... Secondly it is the quantity tabulated.\" (p. 147) Fisher only used the term \"pivotal\" when expounding the fiducial argument but now the term is used more widely. [John Aldrich, based on information in David (2001)].\n\nPLACE VALUE appears in 1847 in A Treatise on Algebra, Containing the Latest Improvements. Adapted to the Use of Schools and Colleges Charles William Hackley: \"It is clear from this, that if we add the figures of the number without regarding their place value, the sum obtained and the proposed number will have the same minimum residue.\" [Google print search]\n\nThe word PLAGIOGRAPH was coined by James Joseph Sylvester (DSB).\n\nPLANE GEOMETRY appears in English in a letter from John Collins to Oldenburg for Tschirnhaus written in May 1676: \"...Mechanicall tentative Constructions performed by Plaine Geometry are much to be preferred...\" [James A. Landau].\n\nPLATONIC SOLIDS. The five regular polyhedra are discussed by Plato in the Timaeus where they provide the basis for a theory of the universe. Their earlier history is obscure: William C. Waterhouse writes in \"The Discovery of the Regular Solids\" Archive for History of Exact Science, 9, (1972-1973)\n\nThe history of the regular solids thus rests almost entirely on a scholium to Euclid which reads as follows: \"In this book, the 13th, are constructed the 5 figures called Platonic, which however do not belong to Plato. Three of these 5 figures, the cube, pyramid, and dodecahedron, belong to the Pythagoreans; while the octahedron and icosahedron belong to Theaetetus.\"\n\nThis citation was provided by Paul Bien. The five solids are the subject of Book XIII of Euclid's Elements.\n\nIn English, the OED shows a use of Platonicall bodies in 1571 by Thomas Digges and a Google books search found a use of Platonic solids in 1787 in The young geometrician's companion: being a new and comprehensive course of practical geometry by the Reverend Richard Turner.\n\nSee the entries CUBE, POLYHEDRON and PYRAMID.\n\nPLATONISM. In the specific sense now widely used in discussions on the foundations of mathematics, this term was introduced by Paul Bernays (1888-1977) in Sur lÃª platonisme dans les mathematiques, Einseignement Math., 34 (1935-1936), 52-69. We quote the relevant passage:\n\nIf we compare Hilbert's axiom system to Euclid's (...), we notice that Euclid speaks of figures to be constructed, whereas, for Hilbert, systems of points, straight lines, and planes exist from the outset. (...) This example shows already that the tendency (...) consists in viewing the objects as cut off from all links with the reflecting subject. Since this tendency asserted itself especially in the philosophy of Plato, allow me to call it \"platonism\".\n\n(The translation from the French is by Charles Parsons. This entry was contributed by Carlos CÃ©sar de AraÃºjo.)\n\nPLETHYSM. According to Richard P. Stanley in Enumerative Combinatorics, the term was introduced in D. E. Littlewood, \"Invariant theory, tensors and group characters,\" Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London. Ser. A. 239, (1944), 305â365. The term was suggested to Littlewood by M. L. Clark after the Greek word plethysmos (\"multiplication\" in modern Greek). [Information from this web page.]\n\nPLUQUATERNION was coined by Thomas Kirkman (1806-1895), as he attempted to extend further the notion of quaternions.\n\nPLUS and MINUS. From the OED2:\n\nThe quasi-prepositional use (sense I), from which all the other English uses have been developed, did not exist in Latin of any period. It probably originated in the commercial langauge of the Middle Ages. In Germany, and perhaps in other countries, the Latin words plus and minus were used by merchants to mark an excess or deficiency in weight or measure, the amount of which was appended in figures. The earliest known examples of the modern sense of minus are German, of about the same date as our oldest quotation. ... In a somewhat different sense, plus and minus had been employed in 1202 by Leonardo of Pisa for the excess and deficiency in the results of the two suppositions in the Rule of Double Position; and an Italian writer of the 14th century used meno to indicate the subtraction of a number to which it was prefixed.\n\nPLUS OR MINUS. The expression \"plus or minus\" is very old, having been in common use by the Romans to indicate simply \"more or less\" (Smith vol. 2, page 402).\n\nPLUS OR MINUS SIGN. In 1801 Mathematics by Thomas & Andrews has: \"The double or ambiguous sign Â± signifies plus or minus the quantity, which immediately follows it, and being placed between two quantities, it denotes their sum, or difference.\" [Google print search]\n\nThe symbol Â± is called the ambiguous sign in 1811 in An Elementary Investigation of the Theory of Numbers by Peter Barlow [James A. Landau].\n\nPLUS SIGN. Positive sign is found in 1704 in Lexicon Technicum.\n\nAffirmative sign is found in 1752 in The Elements of Algebra: In a New and Easy Method by Nathaniel Hammond. [Google print search]\n\nPlus sign is found in 1835 in Key to professor Young's Algebra by W. H. Spiller and John Radford Young. [Google print search]\n\nPOINT. Definition 1 in the first book of Euclid's Elements states \"A point is that which has no part.\" In the notes to his edition of the Elements T. L Heath (1926, vol. 1, pp. 155-6) describes how sÃªmeion, the term used by Euclid and which elsewhere signified a punctuation mark, replaced stigmÃª, meaning a puncture. Euclid's Latin translators used punctum. Thus Capella (c. 460) translated Euclid's definition as \"Punctum est cuius pars nihil est.\" (Quoted by Smith vol. 2, p. 274.)\n\nThe word appears in English in this sense in John Trevisa's translation (a1398) of the encyclopaedia De Proprietatibus Rerum which was written about 1245 by Bartholomaeus Anglicus. The quotation in the OED is, \"Ã¾e lyne..bigynneÃ¾ at a poynt and endeÃ¾ at a poynt.\" Trevisa's translation was one of the first books to be printed in English (around 1495). The work in its final form (of 1582) has been called \"Shakespeare's encyclopaedia.\"\n\nIn the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the concept of space was broadened to accommodate non-euclidean geometries and abstract spacesâsee the entry SPACE. Elements of these new spaces were called points. Thus Hausdorff introduces a topological space with the words \"Unter einem topologischen Raum verstehen wir einen Menge E, worin den Elementen (Punkten) [a set E, where the elements (points)]...\" GrundzÃ¼ge der Mengenlehre (1914, p. 213).\n\nPOINTLESS (geometry or topology). Forms of geometry (topology) that do not use the point as a primitive concept are called \"pointless\" or \"point-free\" or \"without points.\" Such structures have a long history and titles include \"Topology without Points\" by K. Menger, Rice Institute Pamphlets, 27, (1940), 80-107 and, perhaps inevitably, \"The Point of Pointless Topology\" by P. T. Johnstone, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 8, (1983), 41-53.\n\nPOINT OF ACCUMULATION. See limit point.\n\nThe term POINT-SERIES GEOMETRY was coined by E. A. Weiss [DSB, article: \"Reye\"].\n\nPOINT-SET. The term was introduced in German by Georg Cantor. At first Cantor used the term Punktmannichfaltigkeit; see e.g. his \"Ãber unendliche, lineare Punktmannichfaltigkeiten, (Part 1) Mathematische Annalen, 15 (1879), 1-7. He then changed to Punktmenge; see e.g. his \"Ãber verschiedene Theoreme aus der Theorie der Punktmengen in einem n-fach ausgedehnten stetigen Raume,\" Acta Mathematica, 7, (1885) 105-124.\n\nThe English term is used in E. H. Moore \"Concerning Harnack's Theory of Improper Definite Integrals,\" Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 2, (1901), p. 297. See SET and SET THEORY.\n\nThe term POINT-SET TOPOLOGY was coined by Robert Lee Moore (1882-1974), according to the University of St. Andrews website. Moore's Foundations of point set topology was published in 1932.\n\nPOINT-SLOPE FORM. Slope-point form is found in 1904 in Elements of the Differential and Integral Calculus by William Anthony Granville [James A. Landau].\n\nPoint-slope form is found in 1904 in The Elements of Analytic Geometry by Percey Franklyn Smith and Arthur Sullivan Gale. [Google print search]\n\nSee slope on Earliest Uses of Symbols from Geometry.\n\nPOISSON DISTRIBUTION. S. D. Poisson's result on the limiting form of the binomial appears in the MÃ©moire sur la proportion des naissances des filles et des garcons (1830, pp. 261-2) and is reproduced in the RecherchÃ©s sur la probabilitÃ© des jugements en matiÃ¨re criminelle et matiÃ¨re civil (1837, pp. 205ff). Poisson's 'ownership' of this distribution has been debated for De Moivre had come very close to it in 1712 (Hald (1990, p. 214)) and PoissonÂ \"does not discuss the properties and applications of this distribution\" (Hald (1998, p. 571)). L. J. Bortkiewicz discussed both in his tract Das Gesetz der kleinen Zahlen (1898); this has the famous example of cavalrymen being killed by the kick of a horse.\n\nIn Britain the distribution was not well known at the beginning of the 20th century -- Student actually rediscovered it in his \"On the Error of Counting with a Haemacytometer,\" Biometrika, 5, (1907), 351-360. However Poisson received full attention in two papers published in 1914: Lucy Whitaker's \"On the Poisson Law of Small Numbers,\" Biometrika, 10, 36-71 and Herbert Edward Soper's \"Tables of Poisson's Exponential Binomial Limit\" Biometrika, 10, 25-35Â Whitaker called the distribution the Poisson-exponential, while Soper referred to Poisson's exponential binomial limit or Poisson's exponential series.\n\nPoisson distribution appears in 1922 in R. A. Fisher, H.G. Thornton and W.A. Mackenzie The Accuracy of the Plating Method of Estimating the Density of Bacterial Populations, p. 331: \"When the statistical examination of these data was commenced it was not anticipated that any clear relationship with the Poisson distribution would be obtained\" (OED2). Fisher's Statistical Methods for Research Workers (1925, section 15) established Poisson as 'core repertory.'\n\n[This entry was contributed by John Aldrich, based on Hald (1990 and -98) David (1995).]\n\nPOLAR COORDINATES. According to Daniel L. Klaasen in Historical Topics for the Mathematical Classroom:\n\nIsaac Newton was the first to think of using polar coordinates. In a treatise Method of Fluxions (written about 1671), which dealt with curves defined analytically, Newton showed ten types of coordinate systems that could be used; one of these ten was the system of polar coordinates. However, this work by Newton was not published until 1736; in 1691 Jakob Bernoulli derived and made public the concept of polar coordinates in the Acta eruditorum. The polar system used for reference a point on a line rather than two intersecting lines. The line was called the \"polar axis,\" and the point on the line was called the \"pole.\" The position of any point in a plane was then described first by the length of a vector from the pole to the point and second by the angle the vector made with the polar axis.\n\nAccording to Smith (vol. 2, page 324), \"The idea of polar coordinates seems due to Gregorio Fontana (1735-1803), and the name was used by various Italian writers of the 18th century.\"\n\nPolar co-ordinates is found in English in 1816 in a translation of Lacroix's Differential and Integral Calculus: \"The variables in this equation are what Geometers have called polar co-ordinates\" (OED2).\n\nPOLE and POLAR. The term pÃ´le (in projective geometry) was introduced by FranÃ§ois Joseph Servois (1768-1847) in 1811 (Smith vol. 2, page 334). It was introduced in his first contribution to Gergonne's Annales de mathÃ©matiques pures et appliquÃ©es (DSB).\n\nThe term polar (polaire) was introduced by Joseph-Diez Gergonne in its modern geometric sense in 1813 (Smith vol. II, page 334).\n\nThe term POLAR (with respect to a triangle) was coined by Arthur Cayley. The term is found in Cayley \"Sur quelques thÃ©orÃ¨mes de la gÃ©omÃ©trie de position,\" Crelle's journal 34 (1847) 270-275, or Cayley's collected mathematical papers Vol. 1 # 55, pp. 356-361: \" ...seront situÃ©s (comme on le sait) sur une mÃªme droite, qui est celle que je nomme polaire de O, relative aux cÃ´tÃ©s du triangle, et que M. PlÃ¼cker a nommÃ© \"harmonicale.\" [Ken Pledger]\n\nThe term POLE (in complex analysis) appears in Briot and Bouquet's ThÃ©orie des fonctions elliptiques (1859, p. 15). The concept was used by Cauchy but the term was not. (Grattan-Guinness (1997, p. 388). See the Mathworld entry.\n\nPOLISH SPACE (espace polonaise) was defined in Nicolas Bourbaki, Topologie Generale Chapitre IX, deuziÃ¨me Ã©dition 1958 [Stacy Langton]. See the Wikipedia article.\n\nPÃLYA or PÃLYA-EGGENBERGER DISTRIBUTION, FORMULA, URN MODEL etc. are terms associated with the paper by George PÃ³lya and F. Eggenberger \"Uber die Statistik verketteter VorgÃ¤nge,\" Zeitschrift fur Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik 3 (1923), 279-89. (Reprinted in George PÃ³lya Collected Papers Volume IV.) The term \"PÃ³lya-Eggenberger distribution\" appears in W. Feller \"On a General Class of \"Contagious\" Distributions,\" Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 14, (1943), 389-400. [John Aldrich]\n\nPOLYGON was used in classical Greek. Euclid, however, preferred \"polypleuron,\" designating many sides rather than many vertices.\n\nPolygon appears in English in 1570 in Sir Henry Billingsley's translation of Euclid, folio 125. In an addition after Euclid IV.16, which Billingsley ascribes to Flussates (FranÃ§ois de Foix, Bishop of Aire), he mentions \"Poligonon figures;\" and in a marginal note explains \"A Poligonon figure is a figure consisting of many sides.\" [Ken Pledger]\n\nIn 1571 in A Geometricall Practise, named Pantometria, Thomas Digges (d. 1595) wrote, \"Polygona are such Figures as haue moe than foure sides\" (OED2).\n\nMultangle is found in 1674 in Samuel Jeake, Arith. (1696): \"If 3 [angles] then called a Triangle, if 4 a Quadrangle, if more a Multangle or Polygone\" (OED2).\n\nIn 1768-1771 the first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica has: \"Every other right lined figure, that has more sides than four, is in general called a polygon.\"\n\nIn the 1828 Webster dictionary, the definition of polygon is: \"In geometry, a figure of many angles and sides, and whose perimeter consists at least of more than four sides.\" In this dictionary, the word polygon appears in the definition of the enneagon (nine sides) and the dodecagon, but not in the definitions of figures consisting of fewer than nine sides.\n\nIn 1828, Elements of Geometry and Trigonometry (1832) by David Brewster (a translation of Legendre) has: \"Regular polygons may have any number of sides: the equilateral triangle is one of three sides; the square is one of four.\"\n\nPOLYGONAL NUMBER and FIGURATE NUMBER. Pythagoras was acquainted at least with the triangular numbers, and very probably with square numbers, and the other polygonal numbers were treated by later members of his school (Burton, page 102).\n\nAccording to Diophantus, Hypsicles (c. 190 BC-120 BC) defined polygonal numbers.\n\nNicomachus discussed polygonal numbers in the Introductio.\n\nA tract on polygonal numbers attributed to Diophantus exists in fragmentary form.\n\nBoethius defined figurate numbers as numbers \"qui circa figuras geometricas et earum spatia demensionesque versantur\" (Smith vol. 2, page 24).\n\nIn 1646 ViÃ¨te (1540-1603) referred to triangular and pyramidal numbers: \"In prima adfectione per unitatis crementum, in secunda per numeros triangulos, in tertia per numeros pyramidales, in quarta per numeros triangulo-triangulos, in quinta per numeros triangulo-pyramidales.\"\n\nIn 1665 Pascal wrote his Treatise on Figurative Numbers.\n\nPentagonal number appears in English in 1670 in Collins in Rigaud Corr. Sci. Men (1841): \"It is likewise a pentagonal number, or composed of two, three, four, or five pentagonal numbers\" (OED2).\n\nPyramidal number appears in English in 1674 in Samuel Jeake's Arithmetic: \"Six is called the first Pyramidal Number; for the Units therein may be so placed, as to represent a Pyramis\" (OED2).\n\nPolygonal number is found in English in 1704 in Lexicon Technicum: \"Polygonal Numbers, are such as are the Sums or Aggregates of Series of Numbers in Arithmetical Progression, beginning with Unity; and so placed, that they represent the Form of a Polygon\" (OED2).\n\nFigurate number and triangular (as a noun) appear in English in 1706 in William Jones, Synopsis palmariorum matheseos: \"The Sums of Numbers in a Continued Arithmetic Proportion from Unity are call'sd Figurate ... Numbers. ... In a Rank of Triangulars their Sums are called Triangulars or Figurates of the 3d Order\" (OED2).\n\nTriangular number appears in English in 1796 in Hutton's Math. Dict.: \"The triangular numbers 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, &c\" (OED2).\n\nIn 1811 Peter Barlow used multangular numbers in An Elementary Investigation of the Theory of Numbers [James A. Landau].\n\nPOLYHEDRON. According to Ken Pledger, polyhedron was used by Euclid without a proper definition, just as he used \"parallelogram.\" In I.33 he constructs a parallelogram without naming it; and in I.34 he first refers to a \"parallelogrammic (parallel-lined) area,\" then in the proof shortens it to \"parallelogram.\" In a similar way, XII.17 uses \"polyhedron\" as a descriptive expression for a solid with many faces, then more or less adopts it as a technical term.\n\nHowever, according to Smith (vol. 2, page 295), \"The word 'spolyhedron's is not found in the Elements of Euclid; he uses 'solid,'s 'soctahedron,'s and 'sdodecahedron,'s but does not mention the general solid bounded by planes.\"\n\nIn English, polyhedron is found in 1570 in Sir Henry Billingsley's translation of Euclid XII.17. Early in the proof (folio\n\n377) Billingsley amplifies it to \"...a Polyhedron, or a solide of many sides,...\" [Ken Pledger].\n\nIn English, in the 17th through 19th centuries, the word is often spelled polyedron.\n\nPOLYNOMIAL was used by FranÃ§ois ViÃ¨te (1540-1603) (Cajori 1919, page 139).\n\nThe word is found in English in 1674 in Arithmetic by Samuel Jeake (1623-1690): \"Those knit together by both Signs are called...by some Multinomials, or Polynomials, that is, many named\" (OED2). [According to An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language (1879-1882), by Rev. Walter Skeat, polynomial is \"an ill-formed word, due to the use of binomial. It should rather have been polynominal, and even then would be a hybrid word.\"]\n\nThe term POLYOMINO was coined by Solomon W. Golomb in 1954 (Schwartzman, p. 169).\n\nThe term POLYSTAR was coined by Richard L. Francis in 1988 (Schwartzman, p. 169).\n\nThe word POLYTOPE is a translation of the German Polytop introduced for a four dimensional convex solid by Reinhold Hoppe \"RefelmÃ¤ssige linear begrenzte Figuren von vier Dimensionen,\" Archiv der Mathematik und Physik, 67, (1882), 29-43.\n\nThe English word appears in Alicia Boole Stott \"Geometrical Deduction of Semiregular from Regular Polytopes and Space Fillings,\" Verhandelingen der Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam, 11, (1910), 3-24. See Irene Polo-Blanco \"Alicia Boole Stott, a Geometer in Higher Dimension,\" Historia Mathematica, 35, (2008), 123-139.\n\nPONS ASINORUM usually refers to Proposition 5 of Book I of Euclid. From Smith vol. 2, page 284:\n\nThe proposition represented substantially the limit of instruction in many courses in the Middle Ages. It formed a bridge across which fools could not hope to pass, and was therefore known as the pons asinorum, or bridge of fools. It has also been suggested that the figure given by Euclid resembles the simplest form of a truss bridge, one that even a fool could make. The name seems to be medieval.\n\nThe proposition was also called elefuga, a term which Roger Bacon (c. 1250) explains as meaning the flight of the miserable ones, because at this point they usually abandoned geometry (Smith vol. 2, page 284).\n\nPons asinorum is found in English in 1751 in Smollett, Per. Pic.: \"Peregrine..began to read Euclid..but he had scarce advanced beyond the Pons Asinorum, when his ardor abated\" (OED2).\n\nAccording to Smith, pons asinorum has also been used to refer to the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nPOPULATION and SAMPLE have been linked technical terms in statistics since the turn of the 20th century. In the 19th century population came to be applied to animals and plants and sample, which was primarily a commercial term came, to be applied to objects of scientific interest; the OED quotes T. H. Huxley writing in 1878 (Physiography, xvi. 2), \"numerous samples of the sea bottom were secured.\" The terms were brought into statistics by people interested in the statistical analysis of biological populations.\n\nPopulation and sample acquired a statistical colouring in the work of Francis Galton and W. F. R. Weldon. In \"Typical laws of heredity,\" Nature, 15, (1877), April 19th, p. 532 Galton wrote, \"the population ... will conform to the law of deviation [the normal distribution].\" Weldon applied statistical methods to \"samples\" of crabs in On Certain Correlated Variations in Carcinus moenas, Proceedings of the Royal Society, 54, (1893), 318-329.\n\nThe third founder of biometry, Karl Pearson, further abstracted the terms, brought them together and established the population-sample terminology in theoretical statistics. In \"On the Probable Errors of Frequency Constants,\" Biometrika, 2, (1903) p. 273 he wrote, \"If the whole of a population were taken we should have certain values for its statistical constants, but in actual practice we are only able to take a sample ....\"\n\nIt soon became clear that the population of theoretical statistics was a much more complex concept than the population of a country. In his \"The Probable Error of a Mean\", Biometrika, 6, (1908), pp. 1-25 Student considered a \"normal population\" from which \"random samples\" are drawn. In another paper, \"Probable Error of a Correlation Coefficient,\" (Biometrika, 6, (1908), p. 302), Student explained that the \"indefinitely large population [from which the random sample is obtained] need not actually exist,\" i.e. it may exist only in imagination. R. A. Fisher used the phrase \"hypothetical infinite population\" in \"On the Mathematical Foundations of Theoretical Statistics\", (Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Ser. A, 222, (1922), p. 311) and \"infinite hypothetical population\" in \"Theory of Statistical Estimation,\" Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 22, (1925), 700-725. His prefatory note to the latter (p. 700) tries to clarify what he meant by such a thing.\n\nAlthough Student (1908) had used the phrases, \"mean of the population\" and \"mean of the sample,\" it was not until the 1930s that such terms as sample mean or population standard deviation became prominent. The new sensitivity to the population-sample distinction was largely a response to Fisher's complaint that statisticians had not properly distinguished population and sample quantities, a complaint that led him to introduce the terms parameter and statistic.\n\nThis entry was contributed by John Aldrich. See BIOMETRY, PARAMETER and RANDOM SAMPLE.\n\nPOSET, an abbreviation of \"partially ordered set\", is due to Garret Birkhoff (1911-1996), as said by himself in the second edition (1948, p. 1) of his book Lattice Theory. The term is now firmly established [Carlos CÃ©sar de AraÃºjo].\n\nPOSITIONAL NOTATION is found in 1890 in The Theory of Determinants: In the Historical Order of Development by Thomas Muir: \"Taking this up in order, we observe that Vandermonde proposes for coefficients a positional notation essentially the same as that of Leibnitz, writing 12 where Leibniz wrote 12 or 12.\" [Google print search]\n\nPositional notation is also found in \"Our Symbol for Zero\" by George Bruce Halsted in American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 10, No. 4. (Apr., 1903), pp. 89-90 [JSTOR].\n\nPOSITIVE. In the 15th century the names \"positive\" and \"affirmative\" were used to indicate positive numbers (Smith vol. 2, page 259).\n\nIn 1544 in Arithmetica integra Stifel called positive numbers numeri veri (Smith vol. 2, page 260).\n\nCardan (1545) called positive numbers numeri veri or veri numeri (Smith vol. 2, page 259).\n\nNapier (c. 1600) used the adjective abundantes to designate positive numbers (Smith vol. 2, page 260).\n\nThe OED shows a use of affirmative to mean positive in 1693 by E. Halley, \"Algebra\" in Phil. Trans. XVII: \"Which is affirmative when 2rq is less than dr - dq, otherwise negative.\"\n\nPositive is found in English in the phrase \"the Affirmative or Positive Sign +\" in 1704 in Lexicon technicum, or an universal English dictionary of arts and sciences by John Harris.\n\nIn the French language, zero is a positive number. TrÃ©sor de la Langue FranÃ§aise has \"Nombre positif. Nombre rÃ©el Ã©gal ou supÃ¨rieur Ã zÃ©ro ...\" [William C. Waterhouse].\n\nPOSITIVE DEFINITE appears in 1905 in volume I of The Theory of Functions of Real Variables by James Pierpont [James A. Landau].\n\nPOSTERIOR PROBABILITY and PRIOR PROBABILITY.Â Jakob Bernoulli used the terms a priori and a posteriori to distinguish two ways of deriving probabilities: deduction a priori (without experience) is possible when there are specially constructed devices, like dice but otherwise, \"what you cannot deduce a priori, you can at least deduce a posteriori--i.e., you will be able to make a deduction from many observed outcomes of similar events.\" (Ars Conjectandi (1713) Part IV, Chapter 4.) Cournot uses the term in this sense in Chapter VIII, \"Des probabilitÃ©s Ã posteriori,\" of his Exposition de la ThÃ©orie des Chances et des ProbabilitÃ©s.\n\nIn the course of the 19th century \"a priori probability\" and \"a posteriori probability\" became the standard terms in stating the theorem now called after Bayes. Although Bayes's theorem (the theorem on the probability of causes, the theorem on inverse probability) had an established place in expositions of probability from Laplace's ThÃ©orie Analytique des ProbabilitÃ©s, (1812) onwards, it took some decades for the terminology to become standardised.\n\nIn the English literature W. Lubbock & J. E. Drinkwater-Bethune (On Probability, 1830, p. 25) referred to \"the probability [of the hypothesis] antecedent to the observations under consideration\" as its \"Ã priori probability.\" W. F. Donkin added the term \"a posteriori probability\" (\"On Certain Questions Relating to the Theory of Probabilities,\" Philosophical Magazine, 1, (1851), 353-368). By 1866 Isaac Todhunter was writing in his widely-used textbook, Algebra for the Use of Colleges and Schools (p. 456), that \"a priori probability\" and \"a posteriori probability\" are the \"usual\" terms. Todhunter (following Donkin) wrote the formula as\n\nwhere PrÂ is \"the probability of the hypothesis of the rth cause\" (a priori probability), pr is \"the probability of the event on the hypothesis of the rth cause\" andÂ Qr is \"the probability of the hypothesis of the rth cause estimated after the event\" (a posteriori probability). There was no standard term for pr until Harold Jeffreys adopted R. A. Fisher's term \"likelihood\" in the 1930s. Nor was there a standard term (or symbol) for conditional probability.\n\nThe contractions posterior probability and prior probability were introduced by Dorothy Wrinch and Harold Jeffreys \"On Certain Fundamental Principles of Scientific Inquiry,\" Philosophical Magazine, 42, (1921), 369-390.\n\nHoward Raiffa and Robert Schlaifer introduced the term preposterior, \"choice of a terminal act after an experiment has already been performed ... we call terminal analysis, and choice of the experiment which is to be performed ... we call preposterior analysis.\" (Applied Statistical Decision Theory (1961) p. x.)\n\nThis entry was contributed by John Aldrich, using David (2001) and Hald (1998, p. 162). See also BAYES, CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY, INVERSE PROBABILITY and LIKELIHOOD.\n\nPOSTFIX NOTATION is found in R. M. Graham, \"Bounded Context Translation,\" Proceedings of the Eastern Joint Computer Conference, AFIPS, 25 (1964) [James A. Landau].\n\nPOSTULATE appears in the early translations of Euclid's Elements and was commonly used by the medieval Latin writers (Smith vol. 2, page 280). The Greek original was Î±Î¹ÏÎ·Î¼Î±\\alpha\\iota\\tau\\eta\\mu\\alphaÎ±Î¹ÏÎ·Î¼Î±.\n\nThe most debated of the postulates, the parallel postulate, is postulate 5. In the notes to his edition of the Elements T. L Heath (1926, vol. 1, p. 202) writes, \"From the very beginning ... the Postulate was attacked as such and attempts were made to prove it as a theorem or to get rid of it by adopting some other definition of parallels.\"\n\nIn English, postulate is found in 1646 in Pseudodoxia epidemica or enquiries into very many received tenents by Sir Thomas Browne in the phrase \"the postulate of Euclide\" (OED2).\n\nSee AXIOM.\n\nPOTENTIAL FUNCTION. This term was used by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738 in Hydrodynamica (Kline, page 524).\n\nAccording to Smith (1906) and the Encyclopaedia Britannica (article: \"Green\"), the term potential function was introduced by George Green (1793-1841) in 1828 in Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theory of Electricity and Magnetism: \"Nearly all the attractive and repulsive forces..in nature are such, that if we consider any material point p, the effect, in a given direction, of all the forces acting upon that point, arising from any system of bodies S under consideration, will be expressed by a partial differential of a certain function of the co ordinates which serve to define the point's position in space. The consideration of this function is of great importance in many inquiries... We shall often have occasion to speak of this function, and will therefore, for abridgement, call it the potential function arising from the system S.\" ( Green's Papers, p. 9)\n\nPOTENTIAL as the name of a function was introduced by Gauss in 1840, according to G. F. Becker in Amer. Jrnl. Sci. 1893, Feb. 97. [Cf. Gauss Allgem. LehrsÃ¤tze d. Quadrats d. Entfernung Wks. 1877 V. 200: \"Zur bequemern Handhabung..werden wir uns erlauben dieses V mit einer besonderen Benennung zu belegen, und die GrÃ¶sse das Potential der Massen, worauf sie sich bezieht, nennen.\"]\n\nPOWER appears in English in 1570 in Sir Henry Billingsley's translation of Euclid's Elements: \"The power of a line, is the square of the same line.\"\n\nPOWER (meaning the cardinal number of a set) was coined by Georg Cantor (1845-1918) (Katz, page 734). Cantor used the German word Machtigkeit. See p. 481 of his \" BeitrÃ¤ge zur BegrÃ¼ndung der transfiniten Mengelehre\" [Contributions to the founding of the theory of transfinite numbers], Mathematische Annalen, 46, (1895), 481-512.\n\nPOWER (of a test) is found in 1933 in J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson, \"The Testing of Statistical Hypotheses in Relation to Probabilities A Priori,\" Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 24, 492-510. \"The probability of rejecting the hypothesis tested, H0, when the true hypothesis is Hi, or P(w| Hi), may be termed the power of the critical region w with respect to Hi.\" The concept of a test being more powerful than another is introduced in the same paper, as is the concept of a uniformly more powerful test.\n\nThe term uniformly most powerful test (with a result on the existence of such tests) appears in R. A. Fisher, \"Two New Properties of Mathematical Likelihood\", Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A, vol. 144 (1934) p. 295Â [James A. Landau]. Fisher had not yet started criticising Neyman and Pearson, beyond insisting that their \"interesting new line of approach\" would benefit if they paid more attention to his theory of estimation.\n\nPower function appears in J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson's \"Contributions to the Theory of Testing Statistical Hypotheses,\" Statistical Research Memoirs, 1, (1936), 1-37. (David 2001.)\n\nSee also HYPOTHESIS AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING.\n\nThe expression POWER OF A POINT WITH RESPECT TO A CIRCLE was coined (in German) by Jacob Steiner [Julio GonzÃ¡lez CabillÃ³n].\n\nPOWER SERIES is found in English in 1893 in Theory of Functions of Complex Variable by A. R. Forsyth: \"Any one of the continuations of a uniform function, represented by a power-series, can be derived from any other\" (OED2).\n\nPRECALCULUS is found in 1947 in Mary Draper Boeker, The Status of the Beginning Calculus Students in Pre-Calculus College Mathematics, Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University.\n\nPrecalculus is found as a noun on Dec. 1, 1968, in the Sunday Gazette-Mail of Charleston, W. Va.: \"Although he is chairman of the department, Dr. [James C.] Eaves is now teaching precalculus to about 125 freshmen, and he reportedly knows each by name.\"\n\nPREDICATE CALCULUS. The OED refers to D. Hilbert and R. Ackermann GrundzÃ¼ge der theoretischen Logik (1928) ii. p. 34 for prÃ¤dikatenkalkÃ¼l. A JSTOR search found the English term in 1939 in Laszlo Kalmar \"On the Reduction of the Decision Problem. First Paper. Ackermann Prefix, A Single Binary Predicate,\" Journal of Symbolic Logic, 4, (1939), p. 7.\n\nPREFIX (notation) is found in S. Gorn, \"An axiomatic approach to prefix languages,\" Symbol. Languages in Data Processing, Proc. Sympos., March. 26-31, 1962, 1-21 (1962).\n\nPRENEX NORMAL FORM. According to Webster's Third New International Dictionary, the word comes from Late Latin praenexus (tied up or bound in front), from Latin prae- pre- + nexus, (past participle of nectere to tie, bind).\n\nA JSTOR search finds \"the equivalent prenex form\" in Lazlo Kalmar, \"On the Reduction of the Decision Problem. First Paper. Ackermann Prefix, A Single Binary Predicate,\" The Journal of Symbolic Logic, March 1939.\n\nPrenex normal form is found in 1944 in A. Church, Ann. Math. Stud. xiii. 60 (OED2).\n\nPRESENT VALUE appears in Edmund Halley, \"An Estimate of the Degrees of the Mortality of Mankind,\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, XVII (1693) [James A. Landau].\n\nPRE-WHITENING occurs in G. Hext, \"A note on pre-whitening and recolouring,\" Stanford Univ. Dept. Statist. Tech. Rep no. 13 (1964) [James A. Landau]. The term was probably first used in B. Blackman & J. W. Tukey's \"The Measurement of Power Spectra,\" Bell System Technical Journal, 37, (1958).\n\nPRIMALITY is is found in 1919 in Dickson: \"T. E. Mason described a mechanical device for applying Lucas's method for testing the primality of 24q+3 - 1.\"\n\nPRIME NUMBER. Iamblichus writes that Thymaridas called a prime number rectilinear since it can only be represented one-dimensionally.\n\nIn English prime number is found in Sir Henry Billingsley's 1570 translation of Euclid's Elements (OED2).\n\nSome older textbooks include 1 as a prime number.\n\nIn his Algebra (1770), Euler did not consider 1 a prime [William C. Waterhouse].\n\nIn 1859, Lebesgue stated explicitly that 1 is prime in Exercices d'sanalyse numÃ©rique [Udai Venedem].\n\nIn 1866, Primary Elements of Algebra for Common Schools and Academies by Joseph Ray has:\n\nAll numbers are either prime or composite; and every composite number is the product of two or more prime numbers. The prime numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. The composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, etc.\n\nIn 1873, The New Normal Mental Arithmetic by Edward Brooks has on page 58:\n\nNumbers which cannot be produced by multiplying together two or more numbers, each of which is greater than a unit, are called prime numbers.\n\nIn 1892, Standard Arithmetic by William J. Milne has on page 92:\n\nA number that has no exact divisor except itself and 1 is called a Prime Number. Thus, 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. are prime numbers.\n\nA list of primes to 10,006,721 published in 1914 by D. N. Lehmer includes 1.\n\n[James A. Landau provided some of the above citations.]\n\nPRIME NUMBER THEOREM. The theorem was proved independently by Hadamard and de la VallÃ©e Poussin in 1896. Edmund Landau called it der Primzahlsatz, for brevity and in recognition of the theorem's importance: see Handbuch der Lehre von der Verteilung der Primzahlen (1909, Erster Band, p. vii.) See also Cajori 1919, page 439. The term was quickly translated into English: see the 1915 quotation from Ramanujan in the entry DEEP THEOREM. For further information see Mathworld: PrimeNumberTheorem. [John Aldrich]\n\nPRIMITIVE (in group theory). The German word primitiv appears in Sophus Lie, Theorie der Transformationsgruppen (1888).\n\nPrimitive appears in J. M. Page's exposition of Lie's theory, \"On the Primitive Groups of Transformations in Space of Four Dimensions,\" American Journal of Mathematics 10, (1888), 293-346. Page writes: \"A group in the plane is primitive when with each ordinary point which we hold, no invariant direction is connected.\" (OED). [John Aldrich]\n\nPRIMITIVE FUNCTION. In Theory of Analytic Functions (ThÃ©orie des fonctions analytiques 1797), Joseph Lagrange wrote, in translation:\n\nLet us assign to the variable of a function some increment by adding to this variable an arbitrary quantity; we can, if the function is algebraic, expand it in terms of the powers of this quantity by using the familiar rules of algebra. The first term of the expansion will be the given function, which will be called the primitive function; the following terms will be formed of various functions of the same variable multiplied by the successive powers of the arbitrary quantity. These new functions will depend only on the primitive function from which they are derived and may be called the derivative functions.\n\nThe preceding was taken from Struik, A Source Book in Mathematics, p. 388. [Citation provided by Dave L. Renfro]\n\nLacroix used fonction primitive in TraitÃ© du calcul diffÃ©rentiel et integral (1797-1800). The term appears in English in the 1816 translation of this work.\n\nSee DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS.\n\nPRIMITIVE RECURSIVE FUNCTION was coined by RÃ³zsa PÃ©ter (1905-1977) in \"Ãber den Zusammenhang der verschiedenen Begriffe der rekursiven Funktion,\" Mathematische Annalen, 110, (1934), 612-632.\n\nThe English term appeared in S. C. Kleene \"General Recursive Functions of Natural Numbers,\" Mathematische Annalen, 112, (1936), 727-742.\n\n[John Aldrich, Cesc Rossello, and Dirk Schlimm contributed to this entry].\n\nThe term PRIMITIVE ROOT was introduced by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), according to Dickson, vol. I, page 181.\n\nIn \"Demonstrationes circa residua ex divisione potestatum per numeros primos resultantia,\" Novi commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 18 (1773), Euler wrote: \"Huiusmodi radices progressionis geometricae, quae series residuorum completas producunt, primitivas appellabo\" [Heinz Lueneburg].\n\nPrimitive root is found in English in 1811 in An Elementary Investigation of the Theory of Numbers by Peter Barlow [James A. Landau].\n\nThe method of PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS was introduced by H. Hotelling.\n\ninÂ \"Analysis of a Complex of Statistical Variables into Principal Components,\" Jrnl. Educ. Psychol. â:IV, (1933). On p. 421: \"We..determine the components, not exceeding n in number, and perhaps neglecting those whose contributions to the total variance are small. This we shall call the method of principal components.\" (OED)\n\nThe term PRINCIPAL GROUP was introduced by Felix Klein (1849-1925) (Katz, page 791).\n\nPRINCIPAL SQUARE ROOT appears in 1898 in Text-Book of Algebra by G. E. Fisher and I. J. Schwatt, according to Manning\n\n(1970).\n\nThe term PRINCIPLE OF CONTINUITY was coined by Poncelet (Kline, page 843).\n\nPRINCIPLE OF INDIFFERENCE/INSUFFICIENT REASON. In his Treatise on Probability (1921) J. M. Keynes re-named the principle of insufficient reason the principle of indifference for he thought the older term \"clumsy and unsatisfactory. The essence of the principle was, \"equal probabilites must be assigned to each of several alternatives, if there is an absence of positive ground for assigning unequal ones.\"\n\nThe term principle of insufficient reason was used by Johannes von Kries in his probability textbook in 1871, according to The Emergence of Probability by Ian Hacking [Hans Fischer].\n\nThe principle is usually traced to Jakob Bernoulli's Ars Conjectandi (1713). Later the principle provided a justification for the use of a uniform prior in problems of inverse probability. In the course of the 19th century its use in this role was subject to increasingly heavy criticism.Â R. A. Fisher echoed these criticisms when he discussed the application of the principle to Bayes's problem of inference to the probability of success in Bernoulli trials: \"Apart from evolving a vitally important piece of knowledge, that of the exact form of the distribution of p, out of complete ignorance, it is not even a unique solution. For ... we might equally have measured probability upon an entirely different scale ...\" \"On the Mathematical Foundations of Theoretical Statistics\" (Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. Ser. A. 222, (1922), p. 326).\n\nSee also BAYES, INVERSE PROBABILITY and UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION.\n\n[This entry was contributed by John Aldrich, based on Hacking (op. cit.) and Hald (1998)]\n\nThe term PRINCIPLE OF THE PERMANENCE OF EQUIVALENT FORMS was introduced by George Peacock (1791-1858) (Eves, page 377).\n\nPRISM is found in English in Sir Henry Billingsley's 1570 translation of Euclid's Elements (OED2). See the Elements, XI, def.13.\n\nPRISMATOID (as a geometric figure) occurs in the title Das Prismatoid, by Th. Wittstein (Hannover, 1860) [Tom Foregger].\n\nPrismatoid is found in English in 1881 in Metrical geometry. An elementary treatise on mensuration by George Bruce Halsted: \"â:XIV. A prismatoid is a polyhedron whose bases are any two polygons in parallel planes, and whose lateral faces are determined by so joining the vertices of these bases that each line in order forms a triangle with the preceding line and one side of either base. REMARK. This definition is more general than â:XIII., and allows dihedral angles to be concave or convex, though neither base contain a reentrant angle. Thus, BB's might have been joined instead of A'sC\" [University of Michigan Digital Library].\n\nPRISMOID is found in 1704 in Lexicon Technicum: \"I, Prismoid, is a solid Figure, contained under several Planes whose Bases are rectangular Parallelograms, parallel and alike situate\" [OED2].\n\nThe PRISONER'S DILEMMA was posed by A. W. Tucker in 1950, when addressing an audience of psychologists at Stanford University, where he was a visiting professor. The OED entry includes an account it received from Tucker, \"The Prisoner's Dilemma is my brain child. I concocted it at Stanford in early 1950 as a catchy example to enliven a semi-popular talk on Game Theory... My example became known by the 'grapevine', but I did not publish it.\" It is discussed in the 1957 book by Luce & Raiffa Games & Decisions.\n\nPROBABILISTIC is found in Tosio Kitagawa, Sigeru Huruya, and Takesi Yazima, The probabilistic analysis of the time-series of rare event, Mem. Fac. Sci. Kyusyu Univ., Ser. A 2 (1942).\n\nThe English words PROBABILITY and CHANCE were given new meanings when the mathematics of Pascal, Fermat and Huygens was translated and developed. (The OED traces \"probability\" to the mid 16th century and \"chance\" to the turn of the 14th.)\n\nThe origins of probability theory are usually traced to the 1654 correspondence between Pascal and Fermat, Les Lettres de Blaise Pascal (pp.188-229), or in 20th century English translation. Probability (or probabilitÃ©) does not figure in the letters and the only word a modern reader might want to translate as probability is le hasard, used by Fermat in his letter of September 25th: \"La somme des hasards... ce qui fait en tout 17/27.\" Probability in its modern sense is used the last chapter of La Logique, ou L'Art de Penser (1682) by Pascal's friends Arnauld and Nicole. See La Logique de Port-Royal pp. 365ff.\n\nThe word kans (chance) was used repeatedly by Huygens in his Dutch work Van Rekeningh in Spelen van Geluck. (Kees Verduin) The Latin version of this work, De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae (1657)), was translated into English as The Value of All Chances ... (1714). Here chances are possibilities or opportunities: e.g. \"If the number of Chances I have to gain a, be p, and the number of Chances I have to gain b, be q. Supposing the Chances be equal; my Expectation will then be worth ap+bq / p+q.\" (Prop. III) The expression \"chances are equal,\" which is used a lot, means that the probabilities of the opportunities are the same. The word probability appears once in the expression \"more probability\" and once in \"equal probability.\"\n\nThe term \"probability\" was much more important in De Moivre's The Doctrine of Chances: or, a Method of Calculating the Probability of Events in Play (1718). De Moivre uses \"probability\" in its modern sense, e.g. \"CASE Ist: To find the Probability of throwing an Ace in two throws of one Die.\" The book's opening proposition connects chance and probability: \"The Probability of an Event is greater or less, according to the number of Chances by which it may happen, compared with the whole number of Chances by which it may happen or fail.\" Chances are counted and probabilities are derived from them. In his Essay (1767) Bayes re-defined chance when he wrote, \"By chance I mean the same as probability.\" (Definition 6)\n\nBayes's title, An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances, illustrates the common practice in 18th century England of referring to the subject as the \"doctrine of chances.\" In the 19th century probability was more likely to be in the title: e.g. Laplace's ThÃ©orie Analytique des ProbabilitÃ©s, (1812) and, in English, Lubbock & Drinkwater-Bethune's On Probability (1830) and De Morgan's Essay on Probabilities (1838). The phrase theory of probability came into use in English after 1860, a fashion set by Todhunter's A History of the Mathematical Theory of Probability (1865). Bertrand set the fashion for titles in French with his Calcul des ProbabilitÃ©s (1889).\n\nSince 1840 or so there has been a continuing debate on the nature of probability. Everyone with an interest in probability--mathematicians, philosophers, physicists, economists, etc.--has contributed and a special vocabulary has evolved. The most common terms, such as subjective and objective, are used in a variety of senses and have a complex history. Poisson distinguished two concepts in his Recherches sur la ProbabilitÃ© des Jugements en MatiÃ¨res Criminelles et Matiere Civile (1837): probabilitÃ©, a question of \"the reason we have to believe that [an event] will or will not occur,\" and chance, a question of \"events in themselves and independent of the knowledge we have of them.\" More recently Carnap Logical Foundations of Probability (1950) used \"probability1\" for probability as degree of confirmation and \"probability2\" for probability as relative frequency. Savage Foundations of Statistics (1954) called his probability construction \"personal probability.\" (See I. Hacking The Emergence of Probability and L. Daston \"How Probabilities came to be Objective and Subjective,\" Historia Mathematica, 21, (1994), 330-344. The Poisson translations are Daston's.)\n\nWhen Kolmogorov axiomatised probability in the Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung (1933) he exploited the analogy between the measure of a set and the probability of an event. The development generated new probability terms. A JSTOR search produced the following appearances in English.\n\nProbability measure appears in J. L. Doob \"Stochastic Processes with an Integral Valued Parameter,\" Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 44, (1938), 87-150: \"any non-negative completely additive function of point sets, defined on a Borel field of sets of some abstract space\n\nÎ© will be called a probability measure if the space Î© is itself in the field of definition and if the set function is defined as 1 on the space Î©.\"\n\nProbability space appears in J. L. Doob and R. A. Leibler \"On the Spectral Analysis of a Certain Transformation,\" American Journal of Mathematics, 65, (1943), 263-272: \"we consider an abstract space Î© with a measure P of Lebesgue type--that is, completely additive and non-negative on some Borel field of Î©--with P(Î©) = 1; that is we consider a probability space.\" (p. 268)\n\nChance variable had a brief career around 1935-40 in the sense of random variable. See e.g. Doob's paper on martingales, \"Regularity Properties of Certain Families of Chance Variables,\" Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 47, 455-486.\n\nThe word probabilist has been in English since the 17th century (OED) but it has only been in common use in the sense of a specialist in probability theory since the 1950s (JSTOR). An early sighting is in a 1946 letter from R. A. Fisher \"In Paris recently I found an interesting and perhaps useful distinction being made between statisticians and probabilists, broadly speaking putting me in the first class and Cramer in the second.\" Statistical Inference and Analysis: Selected Correspondence of R. A. Fisher (p. 331)\n\nThis entry was contributed by John Aldrich. A complete list of the probability and statistics terms on this web site is here. See also Symbols in Probability on the Symbols in Probability and Statistics page.\n\nPROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION. Probability function appears in J. E. Hilgard, \"On the verification of the probability function,\" Rep. Brit. Ass. (1872).\n\nWahrscheinlichkeitsdichte appears in 1912 in Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung by A. A. Markov (David, 1998).\n\nIn J. V. Uspensky, Introduction to Mathematical Probability (1937), page 264 reads \"The case of continuous F(t)F(t)F(t), having a continuous derivative f(t)f(t)f(t) (save for a finite set of points of discontinuity), corresponds to a continuous variable distributed with the density f(t)f(t)f(t), since F(t)=â«ââtf(x)dxF(t) = \\int _{-â}^{t} f(x)dxF(t)=â«ââtâf(x)dx\" [James A. Landau].\n\nProbability density appears in 1939 in H. Jeffreys, Theory of Probability: \"We shall usually write this briefly P(dxâ£p)=fâ²s(x)dx,dxP(dx|p) = f's(x)dx, dxP(dxâ£p)=fâ²s(x)dx,dx on the left meaning the proposition that xxx lies in a particular range dxdxdx. fâ²s(x)f's(x)fâ²s(x) is called the probability density\" (OED2).\n\nProbability density function appears in 1946 in an English translation of Mathematical Methods of Statistics by Harald CramÃ©r. The original appeared in Swedish in 1945 [James A. Landau].\n\nSee also the Probability and Statistics section of the companion page on the history of mathematical notation.\n\nPROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION appears in a paper published by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher in 1920 (p. 758) [James A. Landau].\n\nPROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS and STOCHASTIC PROCESSES, NAMES FOR. Several patterns in naming can be identified. The object can be named after a person associated with it (EPONYMY), e.g. CAUCHY, GAUSSIAN, MARKOV, POISSON, WEIBULL, WIENER, WISHART. The object can take its name from the phenomenon with which it is associated, e.g. BRANCHING PROCESS, BROWNIAN MOTION, ERROR, or from the mathematical construction on which it is based, e.g. BETA, BINOMIAL, EXPONENTIAL, GAMMA. The mathematical construction may itself be named after a person, as in the case DIRICHLET. In some cases the symbol used for the random variable has given its name to the distribution, e.g. CHI-SQUARED and"
