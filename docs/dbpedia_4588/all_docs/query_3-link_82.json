        "text": "Kingsborough Community College\n\nThe City University of New York\n\nCollege Now - Syllabus\n\nSCI 1: Issues and Adventures in Science - 3 credits, 3 hours\n\nCourse Coordinator: Dr. Mary Ortiz\n\nCourse Description: Science 1 explores scientific issues through integration of concepts and techniques from the biological, physical and health sciences. Issues examined include humankind's place in the universe, in which the structure and origin of the universe, solar system, Earth and life are considered; humankind's attempts at mastery of the world, which focuses on space and undersea exploration, genetics research and engineering, bio/computer technology and energy/pollution challenges; and humankind's development of self-knowledge as studied through research on aging, the human mind, fertility, immunity, nutrition and alternative medicine.\n\nCatalog Description: SCI 100 ISSUES AND ADVENTURES IN SCIENCE (3 crs. 3 hrs.)\n\nThe most recent and important discoveries in the biological and physical sciences are presented, observed, discussed, and experimented with, to acquaint students with the world around them. Brain research, studies of aging, disease, fertility, immunity, and the origin of life are explored. Studies emphasize relations to mankind's place in the universe, self-explorations and technological achievements.\n\nPrerequisite: Enrollment in \"College Now\" Program\n\nFlexible Core: Scientific World (Group E)\n\nCollege Now Description: Students study concepts and methodologies used to investigate issues dominating current thought in physical, biological and health sciences. Topic examples include brain research, sleep, aging, fertility, immunity, extinction, pollution and disease.\n\nCourse Rationale: Most college-level science courses involve in-depth study of details of specific disciplines (e.g., genetics) within the biological and physical sciences. However, Science 1 is a multidisciplinary survey of modern science with a major goal being the exciting presentation of current areas of scientific research utilizing traditional and Internet-based approaches. Background theory is presented as needed, with the understanding that most students in the course have completed a year of both high school level earth science and biology and that many have completed a year of high school chemistry. The hope is that students will become better informed citizens in an ever-more technologically advancing civilization, and that they might see themselves as becoming part of the scientific effort through their eventual career choices.\n\nPrerequisite/Co-requisite: Enrollment in the \"College Now\" Program.\n\nFlexible Core: Scientific World (Group E) SCI1 satisfies a CUNY Pathways Flexible Core: Scientific World (Group E) requirement.\n\nAcademic Integrity: Academic integrity means that all the work you do in this course (exams, quizzes, reports, papers, etc.) is your OWN work and no one else's. It includes not cheating on exams or quizzes in any way, as well as avoiding plagiarism in your writing. Plagiarism is using anyone else's work or ideas without proper attribution. This means that if you quote, paraphrase, or even describe in your own words, an idea that comes from someone else's writing, you MUST acknowledge that author in parentheses at the end of the sentence or sentences in which you have summarized his or her idea. Plagiarism, whether intentional or not, is taken seriously and can result in a failing grade. It is almost always very obvious if you do it, so don't risk it. If you are not sure how to reference a source, ask the instructor for help. Your instructor adheres to CUNY policy on academic integrity, which can be found in your student handbook or online at: /studentaffairs/student_conduct/academic_integrity.html. These sources explain the policy in detail and give examples. Please be aware that academic dishonesty may result in a failing grade on the exam or in the course, as well as dismissal from the college. Additional websites that may be of use include: turnitin.com, citationmachine.com and plagiarism.org. (Polizzotto, K., personal communication, 2008).\n\nAttendance Policy: Attendance will be taken at the start of each class. Any student not present when attendance is taken will be marked absent. It is the responsibility of students arriving late to see the instructor at the end of class to have an \"absent\" changed to a \"late\". This mark will not be changed after the class has been dismissed.\n\nAccessibility: Access-Ability Services (AAS) serves as a liaison and resource to the KCC community regarding disability issues, promotes equal access to all KCC programs and activities, and makes every reasonable effort to provide appropriate accommodations and assistance to students with disabilities. Please contact this office if you require such accommodations and assistance. Your instructor will be glad to make the accommodations you need, but you must have documentation from the Access-Ability office for any accommodations.\n\nCivility Statement: As an institution of higher education, Kingsborough Community College and its faculty and staff are committed to its entire student body. As such, we strive to interact with each student equitably and professionally while providing an environment of mutual respect and civility. In the event a student has an allegation charge brought against him/her that is a breach of the Henderson Rules to Maintain Public Order or the Campus Code of Conduct, an immediate investigation will commence followed by a conciliation conference to determine the appropriate outcome within a thirty-day period. The Judicial Affairs process at Kingsborough Community College is critical in providing an agenda for safety, yet simultaneously offering protection of the rights of students who may have been accused of being in violation of the Henderson Rules to Maintain Public Order and/or the Campus Code of Conduct. These rights have been afforded to each Kingsborough student under the bylaws that were established in 1969.\n\nEquity and Inclusion Statement:\n\nIn an ideal world, science and mathematics would be objective. However, much of science and mathematics is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices. I acknowledge that much of scientific and mathematic research and publications have been the work of white men. With that in mind, I have tried to select topics and activities that broaden the voice of science and mathematics as well as consider and respect difference. However, although I have tried to address inequities in science and mathematics, there may be both overt and covert biases in the materials you read during the course. Please contact me if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course materials. One of my teaching goals is to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.). To help accomplish this:\n\nI will ask you to tell me the name and/or set of pronouns you would like me to use to address you.\n\nI want to be a resource for you. If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please donâ€™t hesitate to connect with me to talk about it.\n\nLike so many people, I am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. I will make mistakes!\n\nCourse Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to:\n\nDemonstrate scientific thinking by designing an experiment.\n\nIdentify the ways science affects everyday life.\n\nDemonstrate understanding of the interdisciplinary dependence between scientific fields.\n\nDevelop an appreciation for science and its significance in the 21st century.\n\nTopical Course Outline:\n\nHumankind's place in the universe.

Consequently, since 1984, when the College Now program began, hardbound textbooks have been optional for this course. However, each instructor is required to put together readings based on current materials from newspapers (e.g., Tuesday Science Times), and scientific periodicals (e.g., Discover, Scientific American, Natural History). These sources may vary as the instructor's interests and focus change from semester to semester. The constant is that the course syllabus is the ultimate reference for content, sequence and continuity in the course.\n\nTeacher Resource Materials: College Now instructors, as adjuncts in the KCC Department of Biological Sciences, have access to materials and supplies used by the Department of Biological Sciences of Kingsborough Community College. This includes use of dissecting supplies (e.g., brains, hearts, eyes), multimedia supplies and duplicating and library services. Special requests may be honored and should be addressed to the Science I Course Coordinator: Dr. Mary Ortiz (718-368-5724, or Mary.Ortiz@kbcc.cuny.edu).\n\nSelected Bibliography: Newer references are available through any current book providers and ISBN numbers are provided. Older references are excellent also (many are classics) and are available through libraries or, possibly, on loan from the Science I Course Coordinator.\n\nHumankind's Place in the Universe\n\nBronowski, J., The Ascent of Man, Little Brown, Boston 1973.\n\nBronowski, J., Magic, Science, and Civilization, Columbia University Press, NY 1978.\n\nConsolmagno, G., and Davis, D., Turn Left at Orion, Cambridge University Press, NY 1995.\n\nDarling, D., Life Everywhere, Basic Books, NY 2001 0-465-01563-8\n\nDavies, P., God and the New Physics, Simon and Schuster, NY 1983.\n\nDossy, L., Space, Time, and Medicine, Shambhala, Boulder, Colorado, 1982.\n\nFarrington, B., What Darwin Really Said, Schocken Books, NY 1966\n\nFisher, H., The Sex Contract: The Evolution of Human Behavior, Quill, NY 1982.\n\nFraser, G., Lillestal, E., and Sellvag, I., The Search for Infinity, Reed International Books, Ltd., 1995.\n\nGlasser, R., The Body is the Hero, Bantam, NY 1979.\n\nHutchins, R., Nature Invented it First, Dodd, Mead, & Co., NY 1980.\n\nJastrow, R., The Enchanted Loom: The Case Against Creationism, The MIT Press, Cambridge 1982.\n\nMcAleer, N., The Cosmic Mind-Boggling Book, Warner Books, NY 1982.\n\nMorris, D., The Naked Ape, Dell, NY 1967.\n\nSagan, C., Pale Blue Dot, Random House, NY 1994 0-679-76486-0\n\nSagan, C., Cosmos, Random House, NY 1980.\n\nScientific American Offprints, The Physics of Everyday Phenomena, W.H.
