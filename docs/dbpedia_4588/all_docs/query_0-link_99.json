        "text": "Jacques Seligmann & Co. Records are one of the richest resources for provenance research at the Archives of American Art. Jacques Seligmann & Co. were international art galleries established in 1880 in Paris, France, and had a second location in New York which opened in 1904. The Paris Office correspondence, dated 1914 to 1930, the bulk of which dates from 1921 to 1924, primarily documents the time in which the Paris Office was the main headquarters of Jacques Seligmann & Co. It includes letters written by Jacques Seligmann from the Paris office to United States clients, collectors and business associates; and letters concerning possible and realized sales and purchases. This project contains letters from the following correspondents Sachs, Arthur Sachs, Harry Sachs, Paul J. Salomon, William Samuels, Mitchell Satinover, Joseph Schiff, Mortimer L. Schiffer, Jack W. Schiffer, Sam Schinasi, Leon Schuster, Dick Scott & Fowles Severance, John L. Sieben, J. Stern, Mrs. Benjamin Stern, Kenneth Gibson Sterner, Albert Stettenheim, I. M. Steyne, Alan Stotesbury, Mrs. Edward T. Stransky, Josef Straus, Jesse I. Straus, Lionel F. [illegible] Straus, Mrs. S. W. Strauss, Lewis L.\n\nJacques Seligmann & Co. were international art galleries established in 1880 in Paris, France, and had a second location in New York which opened in 1904. The company's clients included most of the major American and European art collectors of the era, and the art that passed through its galleries often ended up in the collection of prominent American and European museums. The firm was active in antiquities, decorative arts, and Renaissance art; and was among the first to foster contemporary European art. During the years following WWII, the firm was involved in the recovery of looted artwork and property, and the sale of several significant collections. These letters, dated 1914 to 1930, the bulk of which date from 1921 to 1924, document the time in which the Paris Office was the main headquarters of Jacques Seligmann & Co. Correspondence includes letters written by Jacques Seligmann from the Paris office to United States clients, collectors and business associates; and letters concerning possible and realized sales and purchases. Read the more in the Jacques Seligmann & Co. Records finding aid on the Archives of American Art website."
