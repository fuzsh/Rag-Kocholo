        "text": "Welcome Back from the Interim President: A Message to the Penn Community\n\nAugust 23, 2024\n\nWelcome back to Penn! For our new students, faculty, staff, and post-docs, welcome to your University.\n\nI have been incredibly fortunate to have spent my adult life on a University campus. The excitement of Move-In Day reminds me of when I arrived at college as a first-year student. Everything, and everyone, was new. I loved literature and was confident I wanted to major in English. But a few years in, an inspiring teacher convinced me to explore the natural sciences, and I discovered an unexpected passion that turned into my career as a physician-scientist. Many of you may have a similar experience as you explore the vast array of courses at Penn.\n\nWhen I started college, the country was embroiled in protests and was politically divided. As we start this academic year, overseas events are again sparking demonstrations, and the country is as politically divided as I’ve ever seen it. While this historic parallel may imply a sense of constancy, universities succeed not just by maintaining traditions of academic excellence into the future, but also by remaining relevant for the present. The protests of the 1970s catalyzed a cultural transformation in civil rights, human rights, environmental protection, and a dramatic shift in the demographics of higher education and the workforce. This evolution of our society is part of the reason we so passionately defend open expression, freedom of inquiry, and civil debate.\n\nHigher education, and Penn specifically, faced many challenges over the last year. We had unanticipated leadership transitions, and received intense scrutiny and criticism from some alumni, the media, and government agencies. I heard from our champions, but I also met with and listened carefully to our critics.\n\nPenn has much to celebrate—just look at the impressive accomplishments of our faculty, staff, and students! But we must always improve and adapt to a changing world. We must reinforce our commitment to excellence and ideological diversity, cultivating an environment in which everyone can fully explore the amazing opportunities offered by the University of Pennsylvania. The challenge we face together, as the Penn community, is to find a balance—supporting open expression and peaceful demonstrations while ensuring safety and a respectful, inclusive culture, that allows all to thrive.\n\nBuilding on Penn’s actions to date, here are some important ways we are supporting our community and enabling Penn’s critical work.\n\nWe are actively implementing the recommendations of the University Task Force on Antisemitism and the Presidential Commission on Countering Hate and Building Community. Many of these recommendations are underway and we will provide regular updates throughout the year.\n\nNew temporary standards and procedures for campus events and demonstrations were announced at the end of the last academic year. These standards support the balance we seek. All members of the Penn community should review these policies.\n\nWe continue bringing the strategic framework, In Principle and Practice, to life. The Provost’s Office will soon announce inaugural leaders to spearhead our work on grand challenges and opportunities like climate and sustainability and the arts. We continue to advance our strength in data science and AI. We will soon announce new grants for dynamic projects that catalyze Penn’s strategic framework. New programs are being launched at Penn Washington as each of our 12 Schools bring scholarship to bear on public policy.\n\nAs the new year starts, I am reminded of those euphoric moments when new knowledge opens a different perspective. A new solution answers a long-standing problem. A new student discovers an unexpected calling. These are the pivots that redirect lives. They are enabled by a community that respects open-minded debate and privileges facts—a community where we put respect and dignity first, and where all are free to make the most of campus life. I believe ours is and will remain that kind of community.\n\nPenn was founded by a scientist and a philosopher, a citizen who challenged the status quo and a statesman who recognized the outsized importance of relationships and diplomacy. Since the time of Franklin, our impressive faculty, students, and alumni have shaped every aspect of society, used knowledge to improve the world, and selflessly served their communities.\n\nTogether, we will continue to prepare the citizens and leaders of the future. Welcome to a new academic year at Penn!\n\n­—J. Larry Jameson, Interim President\n\nNIA Awards $6.9 Million to PSOM to Advance Potential Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment\n\nA multidisciplinary team of scientists led by Kurt Brunden at the Perelman School of Medicine, and Carlo Ballatore at University of California San Diego, has been awarded a $6.9 million grant from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to prepare a potential disease-modifying Alzheimer’s treatment for future clinical trials. In a recently published study about the new compound, called CNDR-51997, the team found it was effective in restoring brain health in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. CNDR-51997 was identified through a joint drug discovery program at Penn and UC San Diego that was supported by grants from the NIA.\n\nThe new grant will help the researchers demonstrate the drug’s safety in the formal studies required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before the initiation of human testing. By the end of the three-year grant period, the researchers hope to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA, which, if approved, would allow for Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is characterized by abnormal deposits of two types of protein in the brain: amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau. The only currently available disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s, lecanemab (Leqembi) and donanemab (Kisunla), target Aβ deposits in the brain. Notably, there are currently no approved therapies that target pathological tau. In mice, the researchers found that CNDR-51997 was able to reduce both Aβ plaques and tau pathology in the brain.\n\nIn addition to Alzheimer’s, there are several other diseases characterized by tau pathology, such as traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), frontotemporal lobar degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and Pick’s disease. The researchers believe that their compound could not only be a future treatment for Alzheimer’s, but also for these other related diseases, collectively called tauopathies.\n\n“Our findings that CNDR-51997 reduces both Aβ plaques and tau inclusions in mouse models suggest that the compound holds considerable promise for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Dr. Brunden, a research professor and the director of drug discovery at Penn’s Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research. “However, there is also a great unmet need for disease-modifying drugs for the other tauopathies. The potential of CNDR-51997 to address tau-related diseases beyond Alzheimer’s is another important aspect of its therapeutic promise.”\n\nOne of the functions of tau is to stabilize microtubules, dynamic tube-like structures that help give cells their shape. In neurons, microtubules play an important role in axonal transport, a process in which proteins and other cellular constituents are distributed to different parts of the long axonal extensions that are involved in brain function.\n\nIn Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies, tau becomes detached from microtubules, which causes them to become disorganized. This leads to axonal transport deficits and neuronal loss. In preclinical studies, the new compound CNDR-51997 was able to correct these imbalances, ultimately reducing both Aβ and tau pathologies.\n\n“Alzheimer’s is a devastating disease with very few treatment options, so we are eager to advance CNDR-51997 through the drug development process,” said Dr. Ballatore, a professor at UC San Diego Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. “This compound has been designed to combat tau-mediated neurodegeneration and our preclinical data suggest that it could be beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimer’s and related dementias.”\n\nBrady Beale and Barbara Dallap-Schaer: Associate Deans at Penn Vet\n\nThe Gilbert S. Kahn Dean of Veterinary Medicine, Andrew M. Hoffman, has announced the appointment of two new associate deans at the school’s veterinary hospitals. These new appointments signify the invaluable impact hospital services have on the school’s three-part mission.\n\nBrady Beale, an associate professor of ophthalmology and Ryan Hospital’s director and chief medical officer, has been appointed to associate dean of clinical enterprise. In this role, she will oversee the management and operations of Ryan Hospital, including future development and implementation of strategic plans; deliver patient-centric care that meets the high clinical training standards for students, interns, residents, and fellows; and guide an environment that is conducive to clinical research and trials.\n\nBarbara Dallap-Schaer, a professor of surgery and emergency & critical care medicine, and hospital director of New Bolton Center, has been appointed associate dean for clinical education and operations for New Bolton Center.\n\nAs associate dean, she will oversee strategic direction for the large animal hospital; prioritize competency-based veterinary education; and optimize clinical rotation educational experiences at New Bolton Center.\n\nThese new appointments ensure the development and continued success of the school’s small and large animal hospitals and clinical services, and support Penn Vet’s compelling vision for the future of veterinary medicine.\n\nWeitzman Faculty Earn Ramboll Foundation Grant to Tackle the Global Urban Heat Crisis with Innovative Cooling Technology\n\nWeitzman faculty members have been selected to receive $149,000 in funding from the Ramboll Foundation to develop an accessible solution to tackle urban heat. The team will partner with architectural firm Henning Larsen to develop KlimaKover, an innovative architectural application of membrane-assisted radiant cooling technology designed for climate resiliency.\n\nThe funding will be used to create a prototype external autonomous pavilion or an indoor replicable element, providing scalable solutions for emergency situations, and for communities susceptible to the urban heat island (UHI) effect.\n\nAs global temperatures soar, cities worldwide are grappling with the effects of extreme heat, projected to persist for nearly half the year. Exposure to these dangerous heat levels has increased by 200% since the 1980s, disproportionately affecting low-income and marginalized communities and exacerbating social inequalities. The traditional air conditioner market is predicted to grow by 1 billion units before the end of the decade, straining local power supplies, contributing to waste heat issues, and ultimately exacerbating global warming.\n\nDesigned to break this cycle, KlimaKover uses a membrane-assisted radiant cooling technology, which was developed by an international team of researchers from institutions in the U.S., Canada, Asia, and Europe, that provides low-energy cooling while allowing for natural ventilation.\n\n“I’ve been fortunate to be part of a major cross-institutional research effort to make radiant cooling possible throughout the globe as an alternative to air conditioning, with the goal of achieving a sustainable and healthy form of cooling,” said Dorit Aviv, an assistant professor of architecture in the Weitzman School and director of the Thermal Architecture Lab. “This grant from the Ramboll foundation and collaboration with Henning Larsen, has the potential to make this technology accessible and deployable in the places that need it the most.”\n\nThe proposed solution takes the shape of a mobile, deployable, and autonomous structure designed for disassembly which can be transported to various locations and tested on developer partner sites. This is a low-energy consuming, condensation-free, radiant comfort product that can function in cooling or heating modes.\n\n“As the impact of climate change becomes more severe, investment in innovative technologies for better climate resilience is crucial, and ensuring a more equitable approach to addressing and adapting to these challenges is vital,” said Kritika Kharbanda, head of sustainability at Henning Larsen. “We are so excited to take this forward with our partners Penn and Ramboll.”\n\nThe Weitzman team includes Dorit Aviv, an assistant professor of architecture; William Braham, the Andrew Gordon Professor of Architecture; and Eric Teitelbaum, a lecturer in architecture. The partnership between Penn, Henning Larsen, and Ramboll marks their first collaboration. Having secured significant funding, they are joining forces for innovation with a focus on design thinking and scalability. Also joining the project are collaborators from Princeton University and the University of British Columbia, who have led the development of the membrane-assisted radiant cooling technology. The project aims to deliver a prototype that demonstrates the technology’s potential by summer 2025.\n\nPenn Association of Senior and Emeritus Faculty 2024 Annual Report\n\nPASEF, the Penn Association of Senior and Emeritus Faculty, is the organization of and for senior (age 55+) and emeritus and retired faculty from all schools and colleges of the University. PASEF encompasses both standing faculty and associated faculty with the rank of associate and full professor on the academic clinician, research, and practice tracks. Per its mission statement, PASEF “informs and advocates on matters of concern to senior and retired faculty through dialogue with the University administration and communication with its members and the larger community.”\n\nPASEF shares important information relevant to senior and emeritus faculty with its members and engages with the administration when matters of concern to the membership arise. PASEF also does much more—see below. The core mission, however, is service to faculty retirees and faculty approaching retirement and advocacy on their behalf. The PASEF officers meet periodically with the Vice Provost for Faculty to discuss issues of concern. We thank Vice Provost Laura Perna for her assistance and willingness to respond to the concerns of retired faculty.\n\nIn the fall, the PASEF officers devoted substantial time to understanding the new FIAP program, which was suddenly announced in early September. Various means were used to communicate this to PASEF members, including a special panel discussion (via Zoom) on October 24. We regularly respond to member questions and provide information when we perceive that members may not be fully aware of how to access benefits—for example, the hearing aid benefit.\n\nPASEF Size and Scope\n\nPASEF’s membership is large and largely Philadelphia-based. As of July 26, 2024, PASEF had 2,214 members, including 1,345 senior faculty and 869 retired faculty. Of the retirees, 693 remain in the Philadelphia area.\n\nThe PASEF Council meets monthly throughout the academic year and attendance at council meetings is high, averaging 85–90%. Our meetings are hybrid, thus allowing those members who live far from Philadelphia or those travelling to participate. PASEF members sit ex-officio on the Faculty Senate Executive Committee and four of the standing committees of the Faculty Senate: Faculty Development, Diversity, and Equity; Faculty and the Academic Mission; Faculty and the Administration; and Students and Educational Policy. PASEF designates a member of Penn’s Committee on Personnel Benefits. And PASEF’s president sits on the Executive Council of our school-based organization, the Association of Senior and Emeritus Faculty of the Perelman School of Medicine (ASEF-PSOM).\n\nPASEF Activities\n\nPASEF’s principal activities consist of membership programs, membership engagement and communication, community service, and engagement with the Penn administration.\n\nMembership programs. PASEF offers retirement-related, academic, and cultural programs for its members. This past year’s retirement-related programs included New FIAP—What are the Issues? (October 24), Exploring Living Options in Retirement (December 6), Medicare and Social Security: Concerns of Retiring and Retired Faculty (January 16), Estate Planning—Special Needs (March 26), The Nuts & Bolts of Retirement (April 25), and our annual Newly Retired & Emeritus Faculty Celebration (May 6).\n\nPASEF’s retirement-related programs draw the largest audiences, around 100 a piece on Zoom. This past year the most popular was New FIAP—What are the Issues?\n\nOur fall speaker event featured Claire Finkelstein on September 2 speaking about Defendant-in-Chief: Understanding the Trump Indictments and the Stakes for U.S. Democracy.\n\nOur academic programs were Christian Terwiesch’s Would ChatGPT get a Wharton Degree? on October 26, Chris Callison-Burch’s Ask an Expert About ChatGPT and Its Potential Uses in Education (November 8), Can You Hear Me Now? An Introduction to Hearing Loss and Hearing Aids with Diane Holstein, AuD, Danielle Leibowitz, AuD, and Stacy Douberly, AuD (February 29); Guthrie P. Ramsey, Jr.’s What I Did with Musicology and What It Gave Me Back (March 14); and Olivia Mitchell’s Longevity Awareness (April 9).\n\nMany people contribute to the success of PASEF’s programs, too many to list, but special thanks go to PASEF Program Committee chair Andy Binns and members Ed George, Eduardo Glandt, and Ann O’Sullivan, who worked tirelessly to make our programs happen.\n\nMembership engagement and communication. Membership in PASEF is automatic, but ongoing engagement of our membership depends on effective communication. Currently, PASEF has three key channels of communication: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Faculty Retirement, PASEF e-newsletters, and the PASEF website.\n\nPASEF’s flagship publication is The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Faculty Retirement, now in its 16th edition. Though not an official publication of the University, the Hitchhiker’s Guide has become the de facto retirement manual for Penn faculty. This year’s membership survey indicated that the Hitchhiker’s Guide is considered an invaluable source of information for those nearing retirement. Annual updates and release notes are published each year, usually in January, although this year it was somewhat delayed due to the extensive changes made to FIAP. Martin Pring and Janet Deatrick have ably managed annual revisions of the Hitchhiker’s Guide.\n\nNine PASEF e-newsletters were sent to members in the 2023-2024 academic year. We also sent one news flash. The newsletter highlights upcoming PASEF activities and, in the president’s column, alerts members to upcoming deadlines and changes in benefits, benefits administration, and other issues affecting retirees. This year’s membership survey revealed that our newsletter has the greatest reach, with 85% of respondents reporting that they read it at least occasionally.\n\nPrivileges of retired members of the associated faculty. Last year we were alerted that some retired associated faculty had problems concerning library privileges. Some other issues cropped up this year, and we have been endeavoring to get a full picture of the situation. Unlike for retired standing faculty, whose privileges are listed in the Faculty Handbook, privileges for retired associated faculty are left to the individual schools, which has seemingly led to some variation. In addition, certain issues require follow-up, including consistent coding of associated faculty in Workday upon retirement and the interface between Workday and the Penn community system.\n\nPASEF Council and Committees. A list of 2023-2024 PASEF Council and committee members is appended. Thanks to all and especially to past president Marshall Meyer and president-elect Mitch Marcus for their counsel and support throughout.\n\nIn Memoriam. At every PASEF Council meeting, we note the passing of Penn faculty members and reminisce about their time at Penn. This year we sadly noted the passing of Anita Summers, who served as PASEF president from 2015-2016.\n\n—Janice R.

Madden, and Janet Deatrick\n\nWelcome Back from the Faculty Senate Chair\n\nDear Faculty Colleagues,\n\nAs we bid farewell to summer and prepare ourselves for a new academic year, I write as chair of the Faculty Senate to welcome you back to campus and to invite you to participate in the work of the Faculty Senate of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWe find ourselves, as a faculty and as a nation, at an extraordinarily complex and challenging juncture. The political, economic, and ideological tensions that are evident nationally are echoed on our campus and show no sign of abating. Major global conflicts continue in Ukraine, the Middle East, and elsewhere; elections in the U.S. and other nations have exposed and exacerbated domestic conflicts; poverty and disease are endemic. Locally, the City of Philadelphia confronts profound economic inequality, a continuing opioid epidemic, and a struggling city center. Over the past academic year, our campus experienced the resignation of President Elizabeth Magill and chair of the Board of Trustees Scott Bok, major protests (ending with police intervention) over the war in Gaza, incidents involving antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate, and an attack on the core principles and values that have made the University of Pennsylvania one of the world’s premier academic institutions for almost three centuries. These are turbulent times.\n\nAlthough the Faculty Senate cannot address all of these challenges, it can and will consistently advocate for the fundamental values that bind us as a community. As chair of the Faculty Senate, I will prioritize and defend three values that are essential to the academic mission. The first is shared governance, articulated over a century ago by the American Association of University Professors in its 1920 “Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities.” Shared governance means that the faculty have the primary say in areas including the curriculum (what is taught and how it is taught), appointments, promotion, tenure, and dismissal. The faculty play an important role in decisions involving the hiring of university leaders, budgeting, planning, student and faculty conduct, and more. In some cases, the faculty can and should work autonomously, and in others, we must work collaboratively with other University leaders. Shared governance has been increasingly challenged in recent years; the Faculty Senate must and will strenuously oppose those efforts.\n\nThe second value crucial to the health of this (and every) campus is open expression. At the heart of all great universities is the open, honest, and respectful exchange of ideas. The essence of our job as members of Penn’s faculty is to think, to listen, to try out new ideas, to critique our own arguments and those of others, and to strive to arrive at the best possible theories, arguments, and explanations in our fields. The same goes for our students: their education depends upon their willingness and ability to freely and openly express their thoughts and ideas, and to engage in thoughtful exchanges with their teachers, colleagues, and community. No campus can live up to the responsibility of educating its students if it does not fully embrace a commitment to open expression. As our community continues to debate the meaning and boundaries of open expression, the many voices of the faculty must be heard.\n\nAcademic freedom is the third value that I will prioritize. Simply put, academic freedom protects faculty and students from punishment, censorship, intimidation, or retribution for the views, findings, or methods that animate their teaching, research, or classroom expression, even when those views, findings, or methods are controversial or unorthodox. As Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the 1957 U.S. Supreme Court opinion Sweezy v. New Hampshire: “Scholarship cannot flourish in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust. Teachers and students must always remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and understanding; otherwise, our civilization will stagnate and die.”\n\nIn addition to the importance of these three values, Penn faces an even broader existential challenge. Americans of all political persuasions increasingly view higher education as a bad investment. A college degree is too often considered an overpriced commodity that does not provide sufficient returns, trust in institutions of higher education is diminishing, and barely half of Gen Z teenagers express interest in pursuing a four-year degree. As a recent article in The Atlantic succinctly put it, “Americans are losing their faith in higher education.” For now, Penn’s application pool remains extraordinarily strong. But we cannot be complacent in the face of this broad skepticism of higher education.\n\nShared governance, open expression, academic freedom, and the future robustness of higher education are not guaranteed, and they must not be taken for granted. I invite you to join me, along with chair-elect Kathleen Brown, past chair Vivian Gadsden, and the other 55 members of the Senate Executive Committee, in protecting the values that make the University of Pennsylvania an exemplary institution of learning. We face powerful headwinds and significant challenges. Your participation and involvement in the Faculty Senate will help to ensure Penn’s future.\n\n—Eric A. Feldman\n\nChair, Faculty Senate\n\nDeputy Dean for International Programs\n\nHeimbold Chair in International Law, and\n\nProfessor of Medical Ethics & Health Policy\n\nPenn Carey Law School\n\nThe Faculty Senate: An Overview\n\nThe Faculty Senate is the representative voice for standing faculty and is led by a tri-chair arrangement in which decisions are made jointly by the chair, the past-chair, and the chair-elect. All standing faculty are members of the Senate, and most of the work is conducted by an elected Senate Executive Committee (SEC) of 58 faculty members that meets monthly, and by several standing and select committees. All standing faculty members are encouraged to become involved in the Senate’s work by contacting the Senate office or your constituency representative.\n\nThe standing committees of the Faculty Senate focus broadly on our campus and community-wide concerns.

China\n\nDawn Bonnell: American Philosophical Society\n\nSenior Vice Provost for Research Dawn Bonnell, who also serves as the Henry Robinson Towne Professor in Materials Science and Engineering, has been elected to the American Philosophical Society.\n\nAt Penn, Dr. Bonnell forges paths that allow Penn engineers to strategically plan and execute pioneering research. Dr. Bonnell plays an important role in developing strategies that anticipate future directions in scientific innovation, feeding the ongoing, thriving research enterprise and providing the underlying structures and programs that enable frontier research at Penn. She has also conducted extensive research across materials science, chemistry and physics.\n\nThe American Philosophical Society is the oldest learned society in the United States, founded in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin for the purpose of “promoting useful knowledge.” Today, the society honors leading scholars, scientists and professionals through elected membership and supports research and discovery through grants and fellowships, lectures, publications, prizes, exhibitions and public education. Dr. Bonnell was welcomed as a member of the society in May 2024.\n\n“It is a great honor to be associated with such distinguished intellectuals, in history and present day,” said Dr. Bonnell. “I am looking forward to meeting colleagues and learning from their ideas and perspectives on topics way beyond my area of research. I am particularly excited to bring the insight I gain from collaboration and interaction with the American Philosophical Society back to the community at Penn.”\n\nEarlier in Dr. Bonnell’s career, she volunteered in professional organizations, including serving as president of one that taught her how to lead groups with diverse goals. She has also served on several federal agency strategy committees, which provided her with insight into trending research directions and how to approach their funding. These experiences enabled Dr. Bonnell to help establish the NanoBio Interface Center at Penn in 2004, and led to her position as Senior Vice Provost for Research at Penn.\n\n“As Senior Vice Provost for Research, I have enjoyed creating programs and partnerships that advance research and enable faculty, graduate students and postdocs to explore new frontiers,” Dr. Bonnell said. “It has also been very rewarding to be able to provide, with partnerships in the schools, the infrastructure required for frontier research and new system technologies that drive our functions.”\n\nDr. Bonnell supports the research endeavors of the greater Penn community, informed by her own roots as a researcher on nanotechnology tools used to measure and image atoms at surfaces and interfaces. Her work studies how to understand the behavior of atoms to manipulate properties that implicate a wide range of future devices, including biomedical sensors, solar cells, computer chips, next-generation batteries, memory storage, and energy harvesting and storage.\n\n“My research has been in fundamental science,” said Dr. Bonnell. “We uncover new knowledge, and it is exciting to be in a position where you know something new that no one else knows, albeit for only a little while. It is then very gratifying to see others build on that knowledge to advance their research.”\n\nThrough Dr. Bonnell’s many roles at Penn, her passion lies in helping others succeed.\n\n“One of the most satisfying components of research is seeing and helping students and postdocs become researchers,” she said. “To watch them develop skills and knowledge and then see the excitement when they make their first discovery or solve a problem is what I look forward to the most.”\n\nAmanda Runyon: AALL Law Library Journal Article of the Year Award\n\nPenn Carey Law School associate dean, director of the Biddle Law Library, and lecturer in law Amanda Runyon has been awarded the 2024 Law Library Journal Article of the Year Award from the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL).\n\nSince 1990, AALL has honored “outstanding achievement in research and writing” in a work published in Law Library Journal. Each year, AALL Awards Jury members review every Law Library Journal article published in the previous year before selecting a winner.\n\nMs. Runyon co-authored “Demonstrating Law Library Value Through Mission-Centered Assessment,” (Law Library Journal Vol. 115, No. 5, 2023) with Amanda Bolles Watson, assistant dean for library and information services at Harvard Law School; Amanda I. Karel, a higher education accreditation, assessment, and planning consultant; and Leslie Street, director of the Wolf Law Library and a clinical professor of legal research at William & Mary Law School.\n\nThe article came from a desire to “positively change the professional conversation around law library quality and find better ways to communicate value,” particularly as U.S. News & World Report adopted new metrics that fundamentally changed how it attempted to measure the value of law libraries in its law school rankings beginning in late 2020.\n\n“Their revised formula placed a heavier emphasis on easily quantifiable metrics about law libraries, such as number of seats, titles owned, and hours open,” said Ms. Runyon. “While convenient to measure, these metrics offered little insight into the true quality of a law library’s services and collections.”\n\nConversations about law library quality became dominated by U.S. News rankings, overshadowing how well libraries actually served their institutions. The focus on U.S. News rankings led to a troubling perception of law libraries as separate entities, not integral parts of the law school with specific needs.\n\nMs. Runyon explained how this new emphasis on U.S. News metrics clashed directly with the American Bar Association (ABA) standards for law libraries. “The ABA requires libraries to develop resources and services tailored to each law school’s unique mission and curriculum,” she said. “Suddenly, law schools and libraries were pressured to prioritize measurable statistics over strategic allocation of resources based on actual needs.”\n\nWhile the article argues against simple quantitative measures defining a law library’s quality and an overreliance on validation from organizations like the ABA and U.S. News, it also urges law librarians and leadership to take an active role in defining and demonstrating law library quality and the many ways in which they support their law schools. “We believed law librarians, as experts, should lead the conversation on what constitutes a quality law library, not outside entities defining quality and driving resource allocation,” said Ms. Runyon.\n\n“Collaboratively authoring this article allowed us to combine our diverse backgrounds and expertise,” she said. “Our goal was to develop a modern framework for effectively demonstrating and communicating the value of law libraries that would be useful to all types of law libraries. Witnessing the positive impact of our efforts on the profession has been immensely rewarding.”\n\nEric Schelter: 2024 Cottrell SEED Award\n\nEric Schelter, the Hirschmann-Makineni Professor of Chemistry in the School of Arts & Sciences, is one of 11 researchers selected by the Research Corporation for Science Advancement to receive its Cottrell SEED (Singular Exceptional Endeavors of Discovery) Awards for 2024. Each award is $60,000.\n\nThe competitive Cottrell SEED Award is designed to support members of the Cottrell Scholar community in high-impact research activities. This year, RCSA expanded SEED Awards to include two categories: New Research Directions and Exceptional Opportunities. Dr. Schelter’s award was for New Research Directions, which supports innovative research projects with potential to lead to a transformative line of inquiry. Dr. Schelter’s SEED project is titled New Directions for Sustainable Separations of Battery Materials.\n\nDr. Schelter’s research focuses mostly on synthetic inorganic and organometallic chemistry to address problems in critical metals separations, develop new materials with quantum properties, understand the roles of f-elements in biology, and gain insight into their unique chemical bonding.\n\nSince 1994, the Cottrell Scholar program has honored and helped to develop outstanding teacher-scholars who are recognized by their scientific communities for the quality and innovation of their research programs and their potential for academic leadership.\n\nThe Research Corporation for Science Advancement is a private foundation that funds basic research in the physical sciences (astronomy, chemistry, physics, and related fields) at colleges and universities in the United States and Canada.\n\nAlice Xu: Harold D. Lasswell Award\n\nThe American Political Science Association (APSA) has announced that assistant professor Alice Xu of Penn’s School of Social Policy & Practice (SP2) is the recipient of its 2024 Harold D. Lasswell Award, presented annually to honor the best doctoral dissertation in the field of public policy. The leading professional organization for the study of political science, the APSA, serves more than 11,000 members in more than 100 countries.\n\nThe citation from the award committee reads, “Amid very strong competition, Alice Xu’s dissertation, ‘Segregation and the Spatial Externalities of Inequality: A Theory of Interdependence and Public Goods in Cities’ stands out. It is theoretically ambitious, methodologically creative, deeply rigorous, expertly executed, and elegantly crafted. This dissertation develops a new and more enlightened understanding of the factors that underlie support for the provision of public goods in urban settings, in the process opening up new methodological possibilities and theoretical lines of inquiry. The committee agrees that this is research of the highest quality and is thoroughly deserving of the Harold D. Lasswell Prize.”\n\nDr. Xu joined Penn in July of 2023 with a primary appointment at SP2 and a secondary appointment in the political science department in the School of Arts and Sciences. Previously a postdoctoral associate at Yale University’s Leitner Program in Political Economy, Dr. Xu studies the comparative political economy of development with a focus on the politics of inequality and social policy, urban and distributive politics, and climate justice and environmental politics in the global south.\n\nUniversity Research Foundation Application Deadline: October 10, 2024\n\nThe Office of the Vice Provost for Research announces that the fall 2024 cycle of the University Research Foundation (URF) opened on August 19 and that applications will be accepted until the October 10, 2024 deadline.
