        "text": "Summary\n\nUniversity physics laboratory, now administrative offices. 1898-1901 by James William Beaumont in collaboration with Professor Arthur Schuster over the interior arrangements.\n\nReasons for Designation\n\nThe Rutherford Building and Hopkinson memorial wing (formerly the Physical Laboratories and John Hopkinson Electrotechnical Laboratory) of 1898-1901 by James William Beaumont is designated at Grade II for the following principal reasons: * Architect: Designed by James William Beaumont, a prominent Manchester architect, with a number of listed buildings to his name, in collaboration with the Professor of Physics, Arthur Schuster, resulting in a well thought-out bespoke university science laboratory building * Historic interest: Ernest Rutherford led the Manchester physics laboratories between 1907 and 1919, and it was in this specific building that he carried out ground-breaking research resulting in his discovery of the nuclear atom in 1911, subsequent splitting of the atom in 1917, and initiation of the field of nuclear physics * Design: The building, which was one of the largest physical laboratories in the world when built, combined the practicalities required to provide first-class teaching facilities covering electrical engineering, electro-chemistry, practical physics, and research, with a judicious use of more elaborate detailing to the building, concentrated on the main entrance which incorporates the university coat of arms and motto, manifesting a sense of civic pride in the provision of this dedicated science building at a provincial university. * Interiors: Much of the original layout survives and the rooms retain their original glazed brick linings which, although more costly, were used to facilitate the cleaning and brightness of the rooms. Other original features include the decorative dado tiling and terrazzo flooring to the wide corridors, original staircases, panelled doors, moulded architraves, moulded cornices, observation balconies, panelled ceiling and wooden roof trusses in the large lecture room. * Group Value: The Rutherford Building forms an important component of the development of the science faculty at the University of Manchester and is located close to a number of other listed university buildings including the Main Quadrangle (Grade II*), the Museum Extensions (Grade II) and Former Department of Metallurgy (Grade II), both on Oxford Road, and the Pharmacy Department, formerly the Medical School, Coupland Road (Grade II).\n\nHistory\n\nThe Rutherford Building was originally known as the Physical Laboratories. Work commenced in 1898, and the building was formally opened in 1901. It was built to designs by James William Beaumont in collaboration with Professor Arthur Schuster over the interior arrangements. When built they were amongst the largest and best-equipped physical laboratories in the world. The building was partially funded by anonymous donations totalling Â£17,000, thought by some to have come from Schuster himself. To the rear of the main building is a contemporary wing referred to on a stone plaque as The John Hopkinson Electrotechnical Laboratory which was erected and equipped in 1899 in memory of Dr John Hopkinson FRS by his parents, relatives and friends. (Hopkinson was an eminent electrical engineer born in Manchester who had studied as a student at Owens College and died in 1898 in an Alpine climbing accident.)\n\nJames William Beaumont was a leading Manchester architect of the late C19 and early C20, whose designs include the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester (Grade II), Pendlebury Hall, Stockport (Grade II), Winters Buildings, 28-32 St Ann Street, Manchester (Grade II), a former packing warehouse on Tariff Street, Manchester (Grade II), and Hyde Town Hall (Grade II).\n\nArthur Schuster had moved as a child to Manchester from Germany in 1869 after the family textile business transferred there. After attending Henry Roscoe's evening classes in science at Owens College, he determined to study physics. He was subsequently appointed professor of applied mathematics at Owens College in 1881, which in the previous year had become the first college of the new Victoria University, and in 1888 became professor of physics. From 1903-5 Schuster was dean of the faculty of science before resigning his chair in 1907, due in part to ill health, having first ensured Ernest Rutherford would become his successor. He also left the laboratory his personal assistant, Hans Geiger, who went on to work closely with Rutherford. Ernest Rutherford led the Manchester laboratory from 1907 to 1919, before leaving to work in Cambridge. It was whilst he was working in Manchester that he discovered the nuclear atom (1911), split the atom (1917), and initiated the field of nuclear physics. In 2006 the University of Manchester renamed the building the Rutherford Building in honour of its most famous former resident.\n\nA contemporary report stated that Beaumont was sent to visit the principal modern laboratories in Germany by the Council of Owens College before drawing up the plans for the building. It also reported that Professor Schuster advocated an internal arrangement with rooms sufficiently large to accommodate at least several students rather than individual rooms for single students (which was the tendency in some contemporary continental laboratories) as experience had taught him the educational value of mixing senior and junior students together. There was a carefully planned system of ventilation designed to exclude dust as far as possible from all the rooms and especially from instrument cases, and many rooms were supplied with water, gas, steam for experimental purposes, and compressed air, conveyed by a series of pipes coloured differently to enable them to be easily distinguished. A 1906 publication describes the building as being arranged so that the ground floor was devoted to electrical engineering and electro-chemistry; the first floor to general instruction in practical physics; and the second floor and basement mainly to research purposes. A large lecture theatre, seating 200, and a smaller lecture room, seating 25, were also situated on the second floor. On the roof was a small astronomical observatory. The Hopkinson memorial wing contained a dynamo house containing seventeen examples of types of direct and alternating-current generators and motors, an accumulator room, photometer room, and the electro-chemical laboratory. It is visible to the rear on a drawing of the building by Beaumont.\n\nDetails"
