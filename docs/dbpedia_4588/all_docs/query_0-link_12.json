It fills a distinct place of its own, between the elementary text-books of practical physics and the more advanced manuals. To some, the fact that it has been primarily written with a view to a particular examination, may be a stumbling-block; but, on close examination, there will be found in it nothing that can be fairly considered as “cram.” The authors are fortunate in having had the very best help in drawing it up, namely, the criticism of successive generations of students who have used the notes from which it is written. In this way it is possible for them to feel certain that, whatever may be the failings of their work, it will at least be intelligible to the average student. An Intermediate Course of Practical Physics. By Arthur Schuster, Langworthy Professor of Physics, &amp;c., Owens College, Manchester, and Charles H. Lees, D.Sc., Senior Assistant Lecturer and Demonstrator in Physics in the Owens College, Manchester. Pp. xv + 248. (London: Macmillan and Co., Ltd. New York: The Macmillan Co., 1896.)",
