Arthur Schuster was a German-English theoretical astronomer born in 1852 in Frankfurt, Germany. He made significant contributions in spectroscopy, electricity in gases, terrestrial magnetism, x-rays, and antimatter. Schuster proposed that x-rays were transverse vibrations of the ether with very small wavelengths. He also conjectured the existence of antimatter decades before it was discovered. Schuster held professorships in applied mathematics and physics at the University of Manchester and led expeditions to observe solar eclipses.",
