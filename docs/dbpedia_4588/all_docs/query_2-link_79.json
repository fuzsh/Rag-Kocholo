        "text": "Dr. Ereshefsky is an internationally recognized key opinion leader in clinical translational central nervous system research with a proven track record in designing and performing first-in-human, proof-of-concept, and a broad range of Phase I clinical pharmacology studies. With over 30 yearsâ€™ experience leading early phase research sites, he is utilized as a global resource within CenExel, providing support to ensure consistency and quality across sites. Dr. Ereshefsky is actively involved in strategic planning for compound development. He helps design translational research programs and define the critical path towards regulatory approval. He has extensive experience working with regulatory agencies and developing strategic plans to address compound differentiation and reimbursement challenges.\n\nDr. Ereshefsky has contributed significantly to many drug approvals, including by providing drug development planning, PK evaluation, and methodological innovation. He has introduced strategies to de-risk early phase drug development through the application of neurocircuitry/biomarker-based (RDoC) strategies, e.g., continuous CSF sampling, QEEG, ERPs, PSG, fMRI, PET, and cognitive and behavioral paradigms.\n\nDr. Ereshefsky is a retired Regents Professor of Pharmacy, Psychiatry, and Pharmacology from The University of Texas at Austin and University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Subsequently, he was EVP and CSO for California Clinical Trials from 2003 to 2008 when it was acquired by Parexel International where his role was VP, Principal Pharmacologist, and Therapeutic Area Leader for CNS Early Phase until his departure in 2016. Dr. Ereshefsky has published almost 150 peer-reviewed scholarly articles and abstracts. He received his Pharm.D. from the University of Southern California. His post Post-Graduate Residency in Psychiatric Pharmacy/Psychopharmacology was completed at Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center (LAC+USC).\n\nDr. Litman is the Medical Director and Principal Investigator for all clinical trials at CenExel CBH. He developed his interest in the treatment of schizophrenia at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he completed his residency in psychiatry. Shortly thereafter, he joined the Experimental Therapeutics Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, NIH, as a Senior Staff Fellow. He remained at NIH until 1995, where he continued to pursue his interest in schizophrenia, including investigating the effects of atypical neuroleptics biological and genetic markers in schizophrenia, as well as the development of better combination therapies for schizophrenia using the alpha-2 antagonist idazoxan. After leaving the NIH, he formed his own clinical trials research organization, first in conjunction with area hospitals, and then as a free-standing inpatient and outpatient clinical research organization now known as CBH Health. Since then, he has conducted over 300 Phase I-IV clinical trials and has participated in many of the important advances in pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia and other brain disorders.\n\nDr. Litman has an extensive background in psychopharmacology, the evaluation and treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar, major depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer disease. He serves as a consultant in psychopharmacology to many area hospitals and group practices, has over 30 academic publications, and frequently speaks about new advances in the field of psychopharmacology, and on the current issues regarding drug development for psychiatric illness. He is currently an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Georgetown University Medical School (where he teaches and trains Psychiatry residents) and a Fellow and Diplomate of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and Diplomate, Added Qualifications in Geriatric Psychiatry.\n\nDr. Diana Shuster, PhD, serves as Vice President of Clinical Sciences at CenExel, bringing over a decade of expertise in Translational and Early Phase central nervous system research. Her role encompasses the design and execution of first-in-human, proof-of-concept, and diverse Phase I clinical pharmacology studies. With a background spanning big pharma, CROs, and TechBio, Dr. Shuster has significantly contributed to advancing rare disease compounds.\n\nIn her capacity as Vice President, Dr. Shuster is dedicated to integrating her multifaceted expertise to ensure consistency and quality across global research sites. Actively engaged in strategic planning, she specializes in designing translational research programs and navigating the critical path to regulatory approval. Driven by a commitment to de-risking early phase drug development, she employs innovative strategies, including continuous CSF sampling, QEEG, ERPs, PSG, fMRI, PET, and cognitive paradigms."
