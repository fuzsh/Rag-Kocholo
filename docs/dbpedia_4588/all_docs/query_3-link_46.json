        "text": "4.1âBritain\n\nIn Britain, the years following World War I sparked state support for, and organisation of, radio research. The establishment of the Radio Research Board (RRB) by the British government in 1920 was motivated by the following three factors of utmost importance: first, the interest in securing long-distance communication throughout the vast British Empire; second, the urge to promote research into valves (whose manufacture considerably increased during the war); and third, the firm conviction in the potential of radio technology. From its inception, the RRB concentrated radio activities in three main centres, namely Ditton Park at Slough, Aldershot Station, and the NPL at Teddington (Gardiner et al., 1982; Pyatt, 1983, pp.Â 91â99). What was initially a civil-type research enterprise progressively turned into military, security-based research in the 1930s. The consequences of this steady militarisation were more conspicuous in the fields of thermionic valves, direction finding and atmospherics, upon which safety in air and sea navigation depended, rather than in radio wave propagation, which held an honourable place as research field in academia, especially at Cambridge and King's College, London (Anduaga, 2009a, pp.Â 18â39). The British radar programme, initiated by Robert Watson Watt and which was crucial in the course of World War II, epitomised this militarisation (Watson Watt, 1957; Pellinen and Brekke, 2011, Porter et al., 2018).\n\nOf the several respects in which the experimental tradition differed from the mathematical physics, two are worthy of note. First, more than half of the experimentalists â among them, EdwardÂ V.Â Appleton, CharlesÂ T.Â R.Â Wilson, JohnÂ A.Â Ratcliffe, and GordonÂ M.Â B.Â Dobson â were Natural Science Tripos graduates and had little knowledge about advanced mathematical physics, especially about electromagnetic theory, compared to their colleagues from the Mathematical Tripos. This is illustrated clearly by a rather obscure historical episode that describes Appleton's efforts to explain how it is that medium- and high-frequency radio waves could propagate beyond optical scopes. From 1928 to 1932, Appleton drew up several versions of a magneto-ionic theory containing equations for the complex refractive index and polarisation of radio waves in two propagation media, i.e. an ionised gas and a magnetic field. It is well known, as Appleton himself publicly acknowledged it, that his theory was mathematically modelled by Douglas R. Hartree in 1932 (in fact, his equations came to be known as the AppletonâHartree equations; Appleton, 1932; Hartree, 1931); yet, it is much less known that he was also assisted by his pupil, Austrian theoretical physicist Wilhelm Altar, in 1925â1926. Appleton appropriated Altar's ideas, hiding Altar's contribution in both his papers and private correspondence. Altar, in fact, wrote a draft that included the magneto-ionic equations in the dielectric tensor form, as GillmorÂ (1982) has credibly shown. In 1947, Appleton was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for his âinvestigations of the physics of the upper atmosphere, especially for the discovery of the so-called Appleton layerâ (Gillmor, 1982; Wilkes, 2011). At their laboratories at King's College and Cambridge, Appleton and Ratcliffe demarcated a clearly experimental territory and circumscribed practices within it, turning to skilful mathematicians to pursue the most demanding and arduous mathematical challenges.\n\nA second defining feature of the British experimental physicists was their ability to open new avenues of research. A comparison of their practices and those of other atmospheric researchers can shed much light in this regard. Both diffraction theorists and theoretical geomagneticians tended to seek rigorous mathematical solutions to problems derived from straightforward, highly idealised physical models. Yet, the lack of verisimilitude often led them to dead ends. This was in sharp contrast to experimentalists who, in their pursuit of the coherence between physical models and experimental data, promoted new stimuli by analogy and replication. The case of Cambridge professor of physics Joseph John Thompson shows how much the mysteries of the upper atmosphere could be revealed in a laboratory setting. AroundÂ 1900, Thompson used electrical discharges to recreate physical processes in vacuum tubes and vessels at Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge (Kim, 1995; Crowther, 1926, 1974). The streams of electrical particles, in theory irradiated by the Sun and impinging upon the higher atmosphere (thereby forming the aurorae), were those that supposedly appeared in the experiments with ionised gases (Lord Rayleigh, 1941, pp.Â 590â591). His investigations on electrical discharges, conducting gases, and cathode rays not only was the result of the signature style of the Cavendish school, characterised by an approach based on reductionism and microphysics, but also opened new perspectives to upper atmospheric geophysics (Kim, 2002). By studying wave propagation through ionised means, the new turn-of-the-century microphysics reinvigorated the Scandinavian interest in magnetism and aurorae, which, in turn, invigorated the emerging area of radio communications (Gillmor, 1997; Buchwald, 1985; Beynon, 1969).\n\nThe effects of this invigoration were almost immediate. The demand of technical training in wireless communication in Britain was such that, in the 1910s, many universities provided wireless telegraphy teaching and made some inroads on radio research as well. In order to fully appreciate the magnitude of this activation, the new research prospects in upper atmospheric geophysics have to be borne in mind. Largely as a result of William Eccles' and other engineering scientists' investigations, the range of radio research lines became broader than that of the diffraction theorists, who were more concerned with longer distances of transmission. In 1912, Eccles formulated the ionic refraction theory that explained three kinds of wireless phenomena, namely the diurnal variations in atmospherics, the wave transmission along the Earth's surface, and questions of directivity in Marconi's aerial (Eccles, 1912). As never before, and stimulated without doubt by the turn towards experimental microphysics, the new wireless investigations encompassed seemingly unrelated phenomena, such as diurnal variation in atmospherics, wave transmission, and antenna directivity. What was initially a geometric optic problem in the 1920s gradually extended to the qualitative behaviour of any kind of wireless phenomenon.\n\nSo the expansion that occurred in atmospheric physics in the 2Â decades following the milestone of Marconi's first transatlantic radio transmission must be regarded, by any standards, as impressive. The interest in atmospheric electricity and the electrical field of thunderstorms which had languished in the late 19th century was revived. When Charles T.R. Wilson invented the cloud chamber to reproduce cloud formation at the Cavendish Laboratory, his concerns circled around condensation questions of ion properties, atmospheric electricity, fog, rain, hail, and so on (Longair, 2016, pp.Â 156â159; Harrison, 2011). His intellectual universe was an incessant circular movement between ionic questions and the nature of atmospheric phenomena. By the late 1920s, his research lines had moved on from cloud chamber and conductivity work to lightning and the polarity and charge of thunderstorms (Blackett, 1960, pp.Â 282â287; Halliday, 1970; Beynon, 1969). Others followed him. Thomas W. Wormell carried out experimental studies of atmospherics and analysed the effects of thunderstorms and lightning discharges on the Earth's electric field. The Cambridge laboratory, headed by Ernest Rutherford, achieved special notoriety in 1932 when John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split the atom for the first time (Longair, 2016). At Cavendish Laboratory, the British-entrenched culture of observation was somewhat laid aside. The upper atmosphere became a realm of experimentation rather than of mere observation.\n\n4.2âThe United States\n\nLaboratory-based experimental physics in the United States was characterised by the variety of research programmes and centres. The most detailed summary on the history of ionospheric physics in this country (Waynick, 1975, pp.Â 12â13) mentions four radio laboratories, two governmental and two industrial, established before 1930. The number of laboratories increased from four toÂ 18 and as such were created in universities and military centres during and after the war. It was mainly in two centres, namely the US National Bureau of Standards (NBS) and the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. (NRL). Both centres were governmental and military in origin, and that cluster of researchers carried out the bulk of investigations. In addition, two radio companies established important electrical engineering laboratories, i.e. the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. and RCA Communications Systems.\n\nThere are several reasons why the United States proved to be a congenial site for the development of electrical engineering. Most important is the presence of committed communities of physicists and telegraph engineers who were able to mould institutions within which the speciality could grow. The first departments of electrical engineering had been established at the universities of Missouri and Cornell in the 1880s. No less important is the fact that the US Navy promoted actions to modernise its fleets as a result of post-bellum industrialisation. Some top-ranking officers soon perceived the need for incorporating wireless telegraphy into the navy. Only well after 1900, when physicists and electrical engineers discovered unanticipated industrial applications of wireless telegraphy, did the field find a secure place in the US Navy (Aitken, 1976, pp.Â 1â28, Aitken, 1985; Hong, 1996, 2001).\n\nAn early episode, which clearly illustrates the spirit of cooperation distinguishing the relations between the NBS and NRL and their shared interests in electrical engineering, concerns the creation of the US Naval Wireless Telegraphic Laboratory (NWTL; Austin, 1912). Plans for this laboratory had been gestating from 1899 when Marconi began to install wireless telegraph sets on warships. But it was not until 1908, when the incorporation of radio technology was recognised as a major need for effective communication, that naval authorities proposed NBS establish a laboratory at the NBS building in Washington, D.C. Military considerations helped spur the interest of NBS, but there were also technical reasons, such as personnel and facilities for electrical research, which prompted its engineers to pursue this avenue (Cochrane, 1966, p.Â 140). Technical evaluations, measurement of wireless devices, and equipment tests proved to be specialised tasks for men who were convinced that competence in electrical engineering was not at odds with physical experimentation. In fact, the point became explicit in Louis Austin's career. From 1908 to 1923, in which he held the post of NWTL's director, Austin conducted long-distance radio measurements and studied the effect of humidity, temperature, and magnetic storms on long-range transmissions. Coming from someone with formal qualifications in physics and laboratory experience (both gained in Europe), his interest in (or approach to) physical experimentation was a logical choice (Weinmeister, 1922, pp.Â 42â43). Moreover, his approach almost certainly represented the collective opinion of NBS. It is hard to imagine that a different route to experimental physics had then been taken in other NBS laboratories.\n\nThe existence of a deeply engrained local tradition was apparent at NBS. The progeny of the 19th century Office of Standard Weights and Measures, NBS had adopted Europe as a model (Cochrane, 1966, pp.Â 49â62). Incorporated into the Department of Commerce from 1903, its policy had been directed towards self-sufficiency and competitiveness, and that aim had been achieved through the creation of measuring instruments and experimental methods to measure electrical quantities. It was, precisely, the models of the British NPL and the German Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (Imperial Institute of Physics and Technology) that were emulated to create the NBS in 1901 as a means of increasing the international competitiveness of national industry. Innovation was an important step, and radio soon became a field of experimentation. From 1914, a split in the NBS electrical division gave way to the radio section, with the young physicist John Howard Dellinger taking charge of the laboratory. In 1920, interest concentrated on high-frequency waves, especially those used in experimental broadcasting stations, and later shifted to long-distance shortwave transmission. By 1927, NBS had launched multi-laboratory programmes to study how fading, skip-zone effect, and atmospheric disturbance influenced radio wave propagation (Snyder and Bragaw, 1986).\n\nThe cooperative nature of the relations between NBS and other agencies in the field of radio wave propagation is illustrated clearly by an episode centred on radio amateurs. It was the American Radio Relay League (ARRL), the largest association of radio hobbyists in the US, which provided the use of its transmitting stations for NBS's fading tests in 1920. At the request of NBS researchers, representatives of NBS, ARRL, NRL, and the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism (DTM) discussed the way to conduct fading tests collectively (Kruse, 1920, pp.Â 5â6). While ARRL was in charge of arranging shortwave stations, coordinating operations, standardising schedules, and collecting data, NBS constructed experiments and analysed all the gathered data. To this end, dozens of stations were mobilised (Yeang, 2013, pp.Â 115â122). As professional radio scientists learnt to devise experiments, the US amateur radio enthusiasts' role became indispensable. Paradoxically, the formation of a NBSâNRLâDTM network in Washington in the early 1920s only hastened the process, since it allowed amateur radio enthusiasts to participate in large-scale scientific experiments for the first time, and many of them who operated in the eastern US at the time seized the opportunity.\n\nAn even more important route by which the Washington network stimulated radio innovation at NBS is illustrated by a case history that begins with a skilful engineer named TheodoreÂ R.Â Gilliland. It was Gilliland, coming from Illinois to NBS in 1928, who turned the experiments probing the Heaviside layer into a regular ionospheric sounding programme. From 1928 to 1931, Gilliland drew upon the DTM's pulse echo method and the NRL's NFK transmitting station in Anacostia, Washington, D.C., to conduct daily pulse echo measurements (Gilliland et al., 1932, pp.Â 286â309). As the DTM's interest in the ionosphere faded, NBS felt it necessary to set up its own pulse transmitter (Synder and Bragaw, 1986, p.Â 207). Over the next few years, Gilliland improved the efficiency of measurement. An initial pulse echo device, with which one could hardly observe the continuous variation in the ionospheric virtual heights, soon evolved into one of far greater efficiency and with automatic recording. His aim was to record critical frequencies as the magneto-ionic theory considered them as an index of the layer's electron density. It is a mark of the NBS expertise that, when a new technology for distinguishing critical frequencies was needed, Gilliland thus invented the automatic sweep frequency recorder, and it became the ionospheric sounder par excellence in the 1930sâ1950s (Gilliland, 1933; Jones-Imhotep, 2001).\n\nHad US ionospheric physics depended solely on the patronage of Carnegie or on the endeavour made by NBS and radio amateurs, it might not have prospered as it did in the interwar years. Hence, if one has to explain its success, epitomised in the confluence of two traditions in the 1920s, one should look not only to private and government patronage but also to the military roots of ionospheric research. In particular, one should look into the NRL and the plans of Thomas Edison behind its foundation in 1923. NRL's genesis is usually associated with a suggestion by Edison to the secretary of the US Navy in 1915 that the navy needed new facilities and funds for research. Although the process was complex (Allison, 1979, 1981, pp.Â 17â38), I will very briefly summarise what historian BruceÂ WilliamÂ Hevly called the Edisonian conception of industrial research (Hevly, 1987, p.Â 16):\n\nFrom its establishment until World War II, NRL did not operate under the assumption that pure research was an immediate necessity for military strength and the national defence. Researchers (at the NRL) did not believe they were engaged in the kind of research that went on at universities. Rather, the assumptions behind the foundation of the NRL lie in the turn of the century context that produced agricultural experiment stations, naval engineering stations, Edison's own research laboratories, and the early industrial laboratories at General Electric, Du Pont, and American Telephone and Telegraph in the US. These attitudes were supported by much of the US's experience in World War I because it meant a fierce intensification of industrial organisation and production. Industrialists and scientists were thrust into closer contact with one another (see, e.g., Wise and Whitney, 1985).\n\nInformation flowed freely between two divisions of the NRL, i.e. the Radio Division and the Heat and Light Division, which later became Physical Optics. This flow of information was much like that at the DTM, and in both places, collaboration between divisions was practised as often as circumstances allowed. Albert Hoyt Taylor, leader of the Radio Division, was captivated by the Edisonian suggestion while working at Western Electric and directing wartime naval communications (Taylor, 1948, 1960). In 1918, he was appointed the head of the Aircraft Radio Laboratory at the Naval Air Station in Anacostia. There, he recruited several amateur radio operators (such as Louis A. Gebhard and Leo C. Young), who had worked on shortwave frequencies during the war and later joined NRL (Gebhard, 1979, pp.Â 31â34 and 45â53). Their mission at NRL was to promote high-frequency radio for naval communications. Taylor's group was unfamiliar with academia. Amateur radio operators were so highly regarded that their knowledge counted as much as Taylor's doctoral degree and perhaps more than his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering (Hevly, 1987, p.Â 21).\n\nScientific policy in Edward O. Hulburt's Light Division was guided by the idea that ionospheric research should be technically useful and, likewise, focused on applied science. From the outset, Hulburt tried to incorporate the data collected by Taylor's group into the growing body of mathematical theory dealing with ionospheric phenomena. In time, his division became the seat of the most academic research. âNone of us were engineers,â recalled Hulburt years later, âwe were pure research physicistsâ (Hevly, 1987, p.Â 26). Yet the disparity of styles was never seen as synonymous with confrontation. Hulburt and Taylor even worked together on such engineering issues as the skip distance, i.e. the shortest distance permitting radio signals to travel from the transmitter to the receiver by ionospheric reflection. In 1926, their alliance culminated in a theory to determine the density of free electrons in the ionosphere (Taylor and Hulburt, 1926). By 1928, the gap was conspicuous between a division that contributed to the physical theory of the ionosphere and the Radio Division, with its massive collection of data on signal strength and transmission ranges at various frequencies. That gap widened over the next decade, at least in terms of quality and originality. The rift was due in part to the successful solving of the problem of skip distance â Hulburt and Taylor had modified Joseph Larmor and Eccles' ionic refraction theory. But it owed more, especially in the 1930s, to the formulation of Hulburt's theory that postulated the action of solar ultraviolet radiation as the causal agent for atmospheric ionisation (Hulburt, 1928, 1938). The success of his ideas is reflected in the NRL's reorientation towards basic research and innovation. Hulburt's theories provided the framework for the experimental programme with V-2 rockets that NRL promoted after World War II (Hevly, 1987).\n\nFor the present purposes, the main contribution of Hulburt's applied physics lies in its function as a model of transition between the Edisonian model of industrial research and the academic model that would emerge in the postwar years. Unlike Taylor's group or the NBS researchers, Hulburt's division was made up of holders of physics doctorates who had no affiliation to industry or magnetic observatories. Hulburt himself earned a doctoral degree in physics at Johns Hopkins University (Hevly, 1987, pp.Â 28â29; Hevly, 1994, pp.Â 144â145). After 2Â years in the army, Hulburt did radio research for 6Â years at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Iowa, during which he saw the importance of combining theory, testing, and development (Howard, 2012). Hulburt's approach to the study of solar terrestrial relations contrasts with the geomagnetic concerns of his British colleagues. Chapman, for example, regarded the ionosphere as the ideal setting to use his experience in magnetic observation and Cambridge mathematical physics knowledge. On the contrary, Hulburt arrived at atmospheric ionisation as part of the NRL promotion of high-frequency radio for naval communications. Nevertheless, his contribution to the mathematical physics theory of the ionosphere can by no means be overlooked (Hulburt, 1974). The institutional realities each had to overcome were certainly very different.\n\nAlthough the Washington network earned its reputation in ionospheric physics chiefly for research bureaus, there were other important institutions in which wave propagation studies were promoted, in varying degrees, through several common interests. I refer to the industrial laboratories of the Bell Telephone Company (founded in 1877), Western Electric (WE, 1872), the American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T, 1885), and the Radio Corporation of America (RCA, 1919). As a rule, the emphasis, in these corporate initiatives, is on exclusively commercial development, with the optimisation of the conditions of wave transmission as the main objective. It is a mistake to underestimate these laboratories as minor agents in the elucidation of the ionospheric layers. In fact, industrial laboratories were typical in the radio and electrical engineering departments, who shared interests and issues with university and military laboratories (McMahon, 1984, pp.Â 133â174).\n\nThe importance of the Washington setting as a propelling force in the history of ionospheric physics in the US must be stressed again. The involvement of the federal government in the physical sciences and the opening of research careers related to terrestrial physics in the capital were trends to which physicists could not close their eyes, even if their prime interest was elsewhere (Reingold, 1991; Hevly, 1994, p.Â 144). It also seems that, among the young newcomers who aspired to posts of professional research in Washington, data collection and recording were more appealing than doing research at universities. This was, in part, an inevitable consequence of the US's 19th century westward expansion, which had led the government to gather physical data and to establish research bureaus for those and other ends in the Washington area (Dupree, 1986, pp.Â 289â299). Undoubtedly, the same is true of the approaches of Edison and other industrialists; many engineers of industrial laboratories (such as Bell Telephone, General Electric, or AT&T) must take much credit for the style of experimental investigation that their successors successfully implemented. The effect of all this is indisputable. Studies of radio wave propagation were fostered beneficially, favouring their confluence with the Humboldtian tradition of terrestrial physics in the 1920s.\n\n4.3âGermany\n\nThe excellence of laboratory-based radio science in the age of the Second German Reich has almost never been doubted. It was an age in which at least three groups of physicists and electrical engineers, led by Adolf Slaby, at the Technical University of Berlin, and Ferdinand Braun and Jonathan Zenneck, at the University of Strasbourg, all for mainly academic reasons, and Adolf Koepsel and Carl Rode, in industrial settings, at the instigation of the military, conducted experimental work on wireless telegraphy. It was an age of an intensive search for means to generate electromagnetic waves through at least four basic technologies, namely spark transmitters, arc transmitters, high-frequency alternators, and vacuum tube transmitters. It was also an age in which not only a dense network of technical universities and several wireless companies but also the German postal, telephone and telegraph administration (Reichspostministerium), operating maritime radio services through the high-power transmitter in Norddeich, were all promoters of experimental studies. Among the wireless companies were Siemens and Halske, Germany's largest manufacturer of radio technology, through research groups such as those of Koepsel and (later) Walter Schottky working on electronic tube noises, the âAllgemeine ElektricitÃ¤ts-Gesellschaftâ (AEG), the âGesellschaft fur drahtlose Telegraphieâ, better known as Telefunken, which intensively worked for the German navy, and its subsidiary TRANSRADIO SenderSysteme Berlin AG, focused on shortwave overseas transmission (Friedewald, 2000; Thumm, 2006).\n\nFrom the start, the threat of what was perceived as a worldwide and perilous monopoly of the Marconi Company was clear for Germany. Despite the Germans' innovative talent in wireless telegraphy, successive German governments strove to rectify what the regarded as a disproportional accumulation of Britain's technological power, which undermined their interests of a policy of imperial expansion and communication. The arguments adduced by the government and industry to establish Telefunken in 1903 were an attempt to counteract British hegemony (RÃ¼ger, 2007; Anduaga, 2009). In Germany, two bodies were especially engaged in this mission for varied reasons. The first was the navy, which believed that wireless was more appropriate for ships than land stations, and that its implementation would help to circumvent a hypothetical communications blockade by the British forces in a world war scenario. Aside from naval interests, the government valued the potential of wireless as a tool to communicate with its colonies in East Asia and South-West Africa (Namibia) without depending on Britain's worldwide telegraph network. Germany sought to escape the British net by devising their own wireless systems and by laying their own submarine cables (Hobsbawm, 1987; Pickworth, 1993; Klein-Arendt, 1996).\n\nAs far as ionospheric studies are concerned, alliance rather separation between industry and academia characterised Germany's experimental physics tradition. To all intents and purposes, Zenneck's career at the chair of experimental physics at the Technical University of Munich (from 1913 until 1936) became the pacesetter. The scholarly reputation of Zenneck and his group have a special significance for our understanding of German ionospheric physics in the interwar years. From a theoretical viewpoint, Zenneck's better-known accomplishment was the diffraction theory of radio wave propagation, to which Zenneck contributed before Sommerfeld, proposing that ground resistance played a crucial role in propagation (Zenneck, 1907). Not less important was his role in the first echo soundings in Germany carried out by his group (led by Georg Goubau in 1929) and their measurements of echo height and critical frequency, magnetic polarisation of radio waves, and radio wave propagation forecasting, among other subjects (Dieminger, 1974, pp.Â 2087â2089). However, for the purposes of this paper, it is perhaps more significant to see the rise of Zenneck and his group as one aspect of the role of industry and the navy as sources of influence and patronage â from 1895 to 1905, he assisted Braun at Strasbourg, conducting wireless experiments to establish a maritime radio service in Cuxhaven, and from 1907 to 1911, he conducted industrial research at the Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik (BASF). Then, as a captain of the marines, he and Braun were sent to the US as technical advisors in a patent case involving Telefunken â all experiences that provided access to the most up-to-date wireless technology (Dieminger, 1961; Schlegel, 2014).\n\nThe new style of experimental radio science was most evident in Zenneck's group, whose members tended to weave close relationships with industry. Although payment in the German technical universities was not determined by the weight of these links, industrial disciplinarity and the access to leading-edge technologies and operational resources seem to have provided the physicists with an important incentive to conduct radio and ionospheric research in universities. This is the case of Hans Rukop, a doctoral student of Richard Mie at Greifswald, who joined Zenneck at Munich in 1913 to work on arc generators and high-frequency machines (Blumtritt, 2005). Industrial immersion was a constant trait in Rukop's career, and as early as 1914 he began working for Telefunken, where he was able to establish a high-vacuum laboratory. Such expectations created in an industrial setting had continuity during the war, when he opened several small factories to produce vacuum tubes, and in the 1920s, when he became head of all Telefunken laboratories. It is true that such accomplishments appear to be unrelated to his appointment in 1927 as professor at the new Institute for Technical Physics at the University of Cologne, but his subsequent achievements in shortwave transmission, radar, and the analysis of echoes from ionospheric reflection cannot obscure the fact that the new institute was built thanks to the collaboration of Telefunken (Rukop, 1928).\n\nIt was clearly in its industrial connections that the strengths of Zenneck's group, as a centre of radio ionospheric research, lay. For their investigations, Zenneck drew on the experimental transmitter of the Herzogstand station in the Bavarian Alps, which was installed and operated by C.Â Lorenz AG, an electrical firm that specialised in radio and vacuum tube manufacture. A primary competitor of Telefunken, the firm developed a radio navigation system (known as the Lorenz beam) which opened wide prospects of progress for aircraft radio business (Klawitter, 2002, pp.Â 85â96). A whole group of Zenneck's pupils based their postgraduate work on observations from Herzogstand. In addition to Goubau and his automatic recorder, it is worth noting that Johannes Plendl, who first worked as a radio engineer for Telefunken, developed the Lorenz beam landing system and made radio wave propagation forecasts for the German air force (Trenkle, 1991). It is also known that the head of this radio wave propagation unit was another of Zenneck's pupils, Walter Dieminger, the future director of the Central Counselling Office for Radio Communication, which was to monitor the ionosphere until the end of World War II. However, the most eminent of this group would be Karl Rawer, then a young doctoral student, who formulated a theory on the reflection of vertical incident radio waves and who worked so deftly with Plendl to optimise shortwave communications in the early 1940s that the French Navy invited him to establish the Service de PrÃ©vision IonosphÃ©rique (Ionosphere Prediction Service) in Germany's French zone after the war (Reinisch, 2014). Although most of their research papers were discussed only in academic circles, there is much evidence that industry and the military stimulated ionospheric investigations and oriented their character (Dieminger, 1974, 1975).\n\nThe diversification of ionospheric research in Germany would not have been so notable had it not become so widespread just at a time, in the mid- and late 1920s, when radio engineering groups and centres were beginning to flourish. And how ironic this was, for these accomplishments owed much to GÃ¶ttingen-trained physicists. For example, in addition to the cases mentioned above, no one did more to promote radio wave propagation and ionospheric investigations in Germany than Karl Willy Wagner, whose doctorate at GÃ¶ttingen enabled him to pursue a brilliant career as professor at the Technical University of Berlin. It was through establishing the Heinrich Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research in 1928 that Wagner provided a favourable institutional setting in Berlin to conduct research in the fields of mechanical, electromagnetic, and acoustic oscillations. It was also through this institute that Wagner organised an expedition to TrÃ¶mso in Norway during the International Polar Year (1932/1933; Schlegel and LÃ¼hr, 2014). As ionospheric research became increasingly integrated in upper atmospheric physics, Wagner's group maintained a lively interest in the influence of auroral disturbances on radio propagation conditions. While other sections engaged in high-frequency engineering, acoustics, and mechanics, this group formed the core of the new Department of Radio Propagation of the German Post Office (Reichspostministerium), under the direction of Friedrich Vilbig (Dieminger, 1974, p.Â 2090). The transition from academia to the civil world became a hallmark of German ionospheric research. While radio engineering largely flourished in industrial and military centres in the United States, technical universities set the pace in Germany.\n\nIn radio science, renown was more readily gained in technical universities, with their acknowledged scholarly journals, than in industries, where results of experimental tests and observations, when they could be conducted at all, were published in obscure and, often, company journals that few read. This does not mean, however, that they fell short of the level of academic research results. Perhaps the most notable example is electrical engineer Hans Ernst MÃ¶gel, who worked for TRANSRADIO at the transcontinental wireless station in Beelitz. MÃ¶gel was able to compare shortwave reception disturbances with geomagnetic data in a statistical way. As a result, he explained the geomagnetic influence on shortwave communication and introduced the concept of âshort-time disturbancesâ in an article published in 1930 in a domestic journal (Telefunken Zeitung and in the German language) that, 5Â years later, saw US engineer John Howard Dellinger publish similar results with no mention of MÃ¶gel's achievements; this omission notwithstanding, the phenomenon is known as MÃ¶gelâDellinger Effect (MÃ¶gel, 1930; Traxler and Schlegel, 2014). By comparison with Zenneck's research subjects, which he regarded as âionospheric physicsâ, MÃ¶gel's approach to research was applied. MÃ¶gel's duties at TRANSRADIO included ensuring reliable operations, investigating disturbances in shortwave transmissions, determining optimal transmission frequencies, and shortwave propagation forecasting.\n\n5.1âBritain\n\nIn Britain, the observatories of Greenwich, Kew, Lerwick, and Eskdalemuir show the scope and scale of this tradition. Greenwich, the seat of observational astronomy from its foundation, had a modest magnetic section which was transferred to Abinger in 1925. Kew, the centre of geomagnetic training, was geared towards the calibration and verification of instruments, as well as the systematic recording of magnetic fields and electrical potential gradient (Simpson, 1928; Barrell,Â 1969, p.Â 171). Yet, emphasis on investigation at Kew was by no means insignificant as compared to its main competitors, i.e. Greenwich and the Scandinavian observatories. Kew director Charles Chree earned his colleagues' respect not only for his prolificacy (over 80 magnetic papers) but also for combating speculation and conjectures, so profuse in geomagnetic science, with a zeal and meticulousness quite unknown at that time. Eskdalemuir and Lerwick benefited from the fact that electric currents associated with magnetic disturbances reached the greatest concentration at those latitudes in the Shetland Isles (Blackwell, 1958; Crichton, 1950). Their records of atmospheric electricity, one of the most esteemed observation series in Britain, and the study of aurorae, ozone, and meteorology, all reflected the commitment to a non-experimental, data recording practice (Harrison, 2003, p.Â 13).\n\nWith the appreciable legacy of Britain's terrestrial magnetism at their disposal and the magnetic records increasing in substantial amounts, the benefits of the observational tradition are evident. The reliable observations of potential gradient at Kew became the largest data bank of its kind in the world (Chree, 1915). Fortunately for Britain, the observatories recruited some of Cambridge's best young brains as assistants. Yet, if the methodological influence of observatories seems clear, the way by which it is exerted is far from it. How far did these observatories enable, say, Chapman to determine the causes of lunar and solar variations of terrestrial magnetism â the basis of his dynamo theory â in 1919? Or to what extent did the systematisation of magnetic and electric observations conduct scientists in the 1920s to formulate theories which, in accuracy and depth, questioned the estimates made until then?\n\nThis fact is unquestionable: the value of such an influence rested not so much on its incentive role for radio research as on the accumulation of geomagnetic data. This does not necessarily imply that observatories underestimated the potential of radio as a tool for observation; indeed, Lerwick was one of the three stations endowed with equipment for direction-finding and atmospherics (Harper, 1950, p.Â 313). But, in the case of Lerwick, the core of the research programme was implemented by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) instead of the Meteorological Office, on which observatories normally depended. Meteorologists and geomagneticians' readiness to engage in radio research was by no means apparent. When George Clark Simpson, a world authority on atmospheric electricity, took charge of the Meteorological Office in 1920, he separated weather service from radio research. At this point, radio research and meteorology in all respects parted company in Britain.\n\nIronically, it was in these very years when a division was completed, that the relationship between geomagnetism and radio physics became closer than ever. Behind this lay, in part, the fact that theoretical geomagneticians pursued a global view of atmospheric physics. The early career of the most prominent geomagnetician, Sydney Chapman, illustrates the reach of this pursuit well. Chapman worked as an assistant at Greenwich from 1910 to 1914. The position was rewarding, both financially and with regards to status (Cowling, 1971, pp.Â 62â63; Anduaga, 2009b). Yet, at that time, at the age of only 22, he soon began to doubt whether he would concentrate on astronomy or on pure mathematics. But his role in the modernisation of the magnetic section and his contacts with Professor Arthur Schuster proved instrumental in defining his research career. Chapman drew on data from over 20 observatories to publish his first results on solar and lunar magnetic variations in terms of dynamo theory and, thereby, extend Schuster's theory to the lunar case. He systematised the preceding theories of Stewart and Schuster and tested them against the collected data, a tedious task entailing the classification of observations. Chapman's strong commitment with research is in sharp contrast with the detachment of most of his colleagues at Greenwich: âIt seems an unfortunate factâ, he stated, âthat the efforts of magneticians are unduly devoted to the accumulation of data, the time and labour spent in their discussion being proportionally inconsiderableâ (Chapman, 1919, p.Â 2). Being, no doubt, fully conscious of these shortcomings, Chapman accepted the challenge, and his theories always rested firmly on data interpretation. His stay at Greenwich and his repeated use of worldwide data helped to cement his belief in the observational-type tradition (Vestine, 1967, p.Â 22)."
