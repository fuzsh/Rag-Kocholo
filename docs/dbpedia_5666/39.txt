Engineering services company Texo Group has today announced the appointment of a former Royal Marines commanding officer to its main board as a non-executive advisor.

Cyber security specialist Major General Martin Smith was Commandant General Royal Marines from 2014 to 2016 and previously commander of 3 Commando Brigade.

He has also been Commanding Officer of 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group and Deputy Commander of 3 Commando Brigade.

Texo Group chief operating officer John Wood said: “I am delighted to welcome Martin to the Group. It is both a personal and professional honour to have someone of Martin’s prominence and experience join our advisory board.

"His vast experience in overcoming the challenges faced during major deployments and extensive maritime operations will be of particular value in developing our broad range of services for our clients, across multiple sectors.

"As a former Royal Marines Commando myself, I know first-hand the importance of leadership and experience and Martin, as his superlative military career proves, has these in abundance.

"Martin will bring a new dimension to our board, providing counsel and support to help us move forward in this high growth stage in our development.”

Smith retired from the military in 2017 and is operations director of cyber security specialists Cyber Prism Maritime Limited.

Aberdeen-based Texo Group provides technology-led services using a multidisciplinary engineering team in sectors including oil and gas, clean energy and renewables, marine, nuclear, telecommunications, utilities and critical civil/infrastructure.

Yesterday it announced the hiring of three directors for its new office in the north east of England.

Smith said: “I relish my new role with Texo; it is an exciting time to be involved with the business. From a standing start it has grown rapidly and has become one of the most dynamic technology and engineering groups in the UK.”
