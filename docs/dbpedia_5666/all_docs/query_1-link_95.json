        "text": "Over 200 people attended Bank Holiday Monday evening's launch reception of Schull Harbour Hotel Calves Week Regatta in West Cork, where Schull Harbour Sailing Club Commodore Mark Murphy released class band allocations for Tuesday's first races in the 61-boat fleet, just nine short of the maximum.\n\nThe event got off to a celebratory start as this is the 40th anniversary of Calves Week, as well as the 140th Anniversary of Schull Regatta so the huge turnout eagerly awaited details of the forthcoming races that will mark the week-long festivities.\n\nIn five boat Class Zero, all from the East Coast (except for Joe Kiernan's First 44.7, Out of Office from Foynes), John Treanor's J112 Valentina looks set to defend last year's title but will no longer have to fend off a challenge from Norbert Reilly's J111 Ghost Raider, as the boat is sold, and Reilly moves to Class Two in a J70, Ghost Raider II.\n\nHowever, the Cork Week champion has plenty of other challenges, including the Round Ireland Race Class Two winner Rockabill VI (Paul O'Higgins), Royal Irish clubmates Patrick Burke's First 40, Prima Forte, and the biggest yacht in the fleet, Frank Whelan's canting keel Elliott 57, Opal.\n\nIn Class One, Leslie Parnell's Black Velvet will again battle fellow Royal Irish J109 competitor Riders on the Storm, sailed by Bobby Kerr, one of three J109s in the ten-boat fleet. The recent Kinsale to Baltimore SCORA race winner IMP (George Radley) is also a late entry into this class.\n\nCalves Week Class Band Allocation 2024\n\nTen boat Class Two sees Royal Cork's Swuzzlebubble return to the fray after July's Cork Week, but rival Half-Tonner Too Farr is not on this year's Calves Week entry list as she is competing at the Half Ton Classics Cup in Belgium, which contains some key local campaigns, including Flor Riordan's Elan 31, 3 Cheers.\n\nIn Class Three, local Schull boat Manzanita promises to be a dark horse following a major winter refit by the Duggan family, while Rob O'Reilly's Bonjourno Part Deux will be the one to beat in six-boat Class 4.\n\nThe two largest fleets are again expected to be White Sail 1 and 2, with former ICRA boat of the year, the Grand Soleil 40, Nieulargo, opting for White Sail One. It will give Kieran O'Brien's Magnet some extra competition as he hopes to again get the better of fellow Royal Cork entry, Frank Caul's Prince of Tides.\n\nIn White Sail 2, the two beautifully restored old ladies: the 1898 Jap from the RCYC and locally based 1902 Lady Min from the host club, will add to the elegance of West Cork's annual regatta highlight.\n\nRace One begins on Tuesday, August 6th, with a Round the Islands Race starting at 11.30 am. See details below.\n\nCalves Week Class 2024 Schedule of Races"
