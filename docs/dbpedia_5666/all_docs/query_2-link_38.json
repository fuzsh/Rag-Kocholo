        "text": "Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.\n\n12 Ultras in 12 Months for £12k - what was I thinking ? There were times when I thought I was a little crazy and a very small amount of time when I wondered why I was putting myself through it.\n\nHowever 11 completed and I’m not done yet!\n\nOn the eve of Run 12 I feel proud of my achievement and unashamed to ask for your SUPPORT…\n\n1. if you want to join me to run / walk / fuel / encourage, please get in touch. It’s a long way when you’re flying solo.\n\n2. PLEASE, if you can, DONATE. Don’t underestimate the difference just £5 can make. For more information on what motivated me to take on this challenge read below for about what the Royal Marines Charity does.\n\nI was ambitious but not deterred by my aim to raise £12k however it transpires that without a celebrity endorsement, and as a non-Marine without a ‘story’, any kind of media coverage is non existent.\n\nI’ve run, walked, hobbled through darkness, wind, rain and also beautiful views and blue skies. I’ve had physical and motivational support from serving & former Marines and, incredibly, also my brother who ran with me some of the way.\n\nI am grateful for every bit of help along the way and will find extra motivation from any bit of financial support you can give.\n\nKeep on keeping on.\n\nThe 12 core values of the Royal Marines are those I try to live my life by. Ultra running is not just about physical capability but mostly about mental battles, determination, humility, adaptability, respect and overcoming. The runs will not be fast, may involve lots of walking, but I am bloody minded enough to finish!\n\nEach of the 12 runs has a connection to the Royal Marines - a location of event that is important to the Corps in some way.\n\nRMA - The Royal Marines Charity exists to help the entire Royal Marines family. Offering a range of services to both serving, veterans and their families.\n\nDonating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity. So it's the most efficient way to donate - saving time and cutting costs for the charity."
