The title has existed since 1943. The role is held by a General who is assisted by a Deputy Commandant General, with the rank of brigadier.[1] This position is not to be confused with Captain General Royal Marines, the ceremonial head. The Commandant General Royal Marines is the counterpart to the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1760 three naval captains were appointed colonels of marines. However, these were naval officers and it meant that the furthest a marine officer could advance was to lieutenant colonel. It was not until 1771 that commandants of the three divisions (Portsmouth, Plymouth and Chatham) were appointed.[3] The first single professional head of the Royal Marine Forces was the Deputy Adjutant-General, a post which existed from 1825[4] until 1914 when the post was re-designated the Adjutant-General:[5][6] the post holder usually held the rank of full general.[7] Since 1943 the professional head of the Royal Marines has been the Commandant-General who held the rank of full general until 1977, the rank of lieutenant general until 1996, the rank of major general until April 2021, the rank of lieutenant general until November 2022, and the rank of full general since 2022.[8] Lieutenant General Robert Magowan was the first person to assume the role twice, serving between 2016 and 2017 and again from 2021 to 2022.[9]\n\nOn 25 November 2022 the Royal Marines announced for the first time since 1977, that a full general would be taking over the role, that person being General Gwyn Jenkins.[10]\n\nFrom 1825 until 1964 his headquarters office which changed location several times was known as the Royal Marine Office.[11][12]\n\nRole\n\n[edit]\n\nThe appointment had been held concurrently with that of Commander United Kingdom Amphibious Forces (COMUKAMPHIBFOR) since the creation of the Fleet Battle Staff in 2001. COMUKAMPHIBFOR was one of two deployable two-star maritime operational commanders (the other being Commander UK Maritime Forces (COMUKMARFOR), now Commander United Kingdom Strike Force,[13] with particular responsibility for amphibious and littoral warfare.[13] Unlike COMUKMARFOR, COMUKAMPHIBFOR is primarily configured to command as a combined joint task force and designed to support a single two star commander.[13] In April 2018, it was announced that the two separate deployable two-star maritime operational commanders (COMUKMARFOR and COMUKAMPHIBFOR) would be merged into a single, larger, maritime battle staff.[14]\n\nIn April 2021, the role passed to a more senior officer in a dual-hatted capacity, and the commandant general's role, as well as being the professional head of the Royal Marines, was identified as championing emerging concepts in amphibious warfare and maintaining critical ties with the US Marine Corps.[15]\n\nGeneral Officers Commanding\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral Officers Commanding have included:[8]\n\nDeputy Adjutant General Royal Marines\n\n[edit]\n\nMajor-General Sir James Campbell 1825–1831\n\nMajor-General Sir John Savage 1831–1836\n\nLieutenant-General Sir John Owen 1836–1854\n\nLieutenant-General Sir Robert Wesley 1854–1862\n\nGeneral Sir George Langley 1862–1867\n\nGeneral Samuel Lowder 1867–1872\n\nGeneral Sir George Schomberg 1872–1875\n\nLieutenant General George Rodney 1875–1878\n\nMajor-General Sir Charles Adair 1878–1883\n\nGeneral Sir John Williams 1883–1888\n\nGeneral Sir Howard Jones 1888–1893\n\nGeneral Sir Henry Tuson 1893–1900\n\nLieutenant-General John Morris 1900–1902\n\nLieutenant-General Sir William Wright 1902–1907\n\nGeneral Sir William Adair 1907–1911\n\nGeneral Sir William Nicholls 1911–1914\n\nAdjutant General Royal Marines\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral Sir William Nicholls 1914–1916\n\nMajor-General Sir David Mercer 1916–1920\n\nMajor-General Gunning Campbell July 1920 – November 1920\n\nGeneral Sir Herbert Blumberg 1920–1924\n\nGeneral Sir Alexander Hutchison 1924–1927\n\nGeneral Sir Lewis Halliday 1927–1930\n\nGeneral Sir Richard Ford 1930–1933[16]\n\nGeneral Sir Richard Foster 1933–1936[17]\n\nGeneral Sir William Godfrey 1936–1939\n\nGeneral Sir Alan Bourne 1939–1943\n\nCommandant General Royal Marines\n\n[edit]\n\nNo. Portrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death) Term of office Ref.
