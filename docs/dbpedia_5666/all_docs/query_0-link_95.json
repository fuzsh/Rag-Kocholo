        "text": "Here Comes the Bus App\n\nConvenience at Your Fingertips: Available for smartphones, tablets, and personal computers, this app makes it easy for parents to monitor the bus's location.\n\nHow to Get Started: To begin using this valuable service, visit Here Comes the Bus for detailed instructions on downloading, registering, and accessing the app. This is a great way to add an extra layer of security and convenience to your daily routine.\n\nRegister 2 Ride\n\nGet Ready for the New School Year: As the new school year approaches, all eligible students must register for bus transportation. This ensures that each student is assigned to a route, allowing for efficient planning and safety.\n\nHow to Register: To secure your spot, visit the Register 2 Ride webpage. The registration process is simple and essential for a smooth start to the 2024/25 school year.\n\nImportant Deadline: Please note that registrations submitted after July 12, 2024, will be processed in the order received.\n\nSpecial Note for ESE Students: If your child is enrolled in an ESE program, they do not need to register through this platform. Instead, reach out directly to your ESE Specialist at the assigned school to arrange transportation services.\n\nView your Bus Assignment: Bus Assignments will be available the second week of August via the Focus Parent Portal.\n\nSchool Bus Safety Tips\n\nExpect Delays: Please be patient as school bus schedules adjust to traffic and new routines during the first few weeks of school.\n\nRoad Safety: With the new school year, there will be more traffic around school zones. Always prioritize safety by stopping for pedestrians and obeying crossing guards.\n\nBus Safety Rules: Remember, it is illegal to pass a stopped school bus with flashing lights or an extended stop arm. Students should arrive at their bus stops 10 minutes early to ensure they are ready for pickup.\n\nRequesting Changes: Major bus stop adjustments will be considered after September 2, once routes have stabilized.\n\nContact Information: For any transportation inquiries, visit Transportation Services or call the helpline for your assigned terminal:\n\nNorth Area: 754-321-4000 (Routes 1000+)\n\nCentral Area: 754-321-4480 (Routes 2000+)\n\nSouth Area: 754-321-4100 (Routes 3000+)\n\nCentral West: 754-321-4150 (Routes 4000+)\n\nSouth West: 754-321-8025 (Routes 5000+)\n\nVolunteering at BCPS\n\nBroward County Public Schools welcomes our dedicated volunteers to the 2024/25 school year! Below is important information to facilitate a successful school year.\n\nAll volunteers must complete the online application for Level 1 screening, which is available at browardschools.com/volunteer. Approved volunteers will receive an email informing them to visit the preferred school listed on their applications.\n\nNOTE: A valid social security number is required to screen all individuals who would like to volunteer with our schools. For more information on the Districtâ€™s screening policy, please contact LaKeshia Smith in the Security Clearance office at 754-321-2374.\n\nLevel 2 screening must be completed for volunteers serving as coaches or overnight chaperones. Your school administrator must send an email to the Security Clearance office.\n\nBCPS employees are not required to complete the online application.
