        "text": "Plus 13 and dry when driving in.\n\nYesterday afternoon was spent watching Archie play cricket at Rockhampton.. It is his second X1 teams last match of the season..\n\nRockhampton is not a great fast bowler’s pitch as it is flat and dead (quote from Archie!).. Having said that it is unbelievably well maintained and a lovely ground.\n\nRacing has always been close to cricket and Gloucestershire are doing their best to hold up the racing connection.\n\nYesterday’s match against Somerset had a very young player making his second X1 debut..Will Sweeting aged 14.. His brother Arthur (15) also plays for Gloucestershire and both are big players for Dumbleton..Dumbleton are through to the Voneous Village Cup Finals at Lord's on September 15.... Will and Arthur will be playing at Lord's and watched by a very proud father.. who is Simon Sweeting of Overbury Stud fame..\n\nDriving there so regularly it is not hard to notice the amazing digging and construction work of the new road at Birdlip.. Truly staggering..It really will be impressive when it is finished..\n\nEd Dunlop has suffered the trainers dreaded nightmare.. Modern life styles causing troubles.. Of course we do worry and I feel very sorry for him..\n\nI put CTV cameras in Alderbook and Master Oats's stables before their important Cheltenham week and all I saw on replay was one of my staff peeing in the corner of the stable..\n\nComing back to today....\n\nCiaran Gethings, Georoid Harney and Johnny Burke were in to ride out..\n\nWe jumped Grand Escaparde, The Kemble Brewery, Destroytheevidence, Faerie Cutlass, Shady Wadey and Guchen,\n\nVince Burmingham, Jane Perks, Lindsey Lewis And Millie Wood was here third lot to see Vince’s KBRS horses Campaign Trail, Phantom Getaway and Does He Know... Vince brought a wonderful selection of sasages from his local butcher. D.W.Walls.\n\nAlso here were Richard Fabian who was here with his daughter Rachel and her two children to see Richard's KBRS horses Does He Know and his half-brother by Sogann, Shantou Express and Isle Of Gold.\n\nUS Open..I watched the last 2 hours of Dan Evan's epic match..Emma Raducanu was beaten... More Tennis\n\nA bit of cricket humour..\n\nDuring his spell for Somerset in County Cricket, Sir Viv Richards produced a legendary retort.\n\nAfter playing and missing at successive deliveries, Glamorgan paceman Greg Thomas made the brave decision to give Viv some verbals as to the appearance of the ball.\n\n\"It’s red, round and weighs about five ounces, in case you were wondering.\"\n\nOf course, the next ball was launched out of the ground by the West Indian legend accompanied with the following words: \"Greg, you know what it looks like. Now go and find it.\"\n\nPlus 16 and dry when driving in.\n\nThat's the Bank Holidays done for the year..Hope you were not stuck in traffic?\n\nToday seems to be Racehorse Retraining Day at Thorndale..\n\nGrand Escaparde and Guchen visited Laura Collett for a videoed schooling session for the ROR as organised by Lucy Jackson...\n\nLaura put the two horses through their paces, over poles, and then told the camera what she does to help horses and what these horses can do when they retire from racing..\n\nPlease don’t think for one minute that either of the two horses that visited her are ready to retire, but they might have different names for the video which is due to be put out at The Cornbury House 3-day event..\n\n18 owners of ROR horses then visited Thorndale to have a discussion and meet our team...\n\nIt was good healthy walk up the gallops followed by a tour and talk while walking around the yard meeting the horses. Then a chat in the office.. Certainly interesting and I hope both sides of the sport have leant something from the morning..\n\nWe pride ourselves on how we approach the next career for our racehorses and many have gone down the ROR route.. hence the visit.\n\nTuesday brings in our vet and this weeks movers and shakers in the BHA handicap charts were Jeudidee down 1 to 107, Gerard Mentor dwon 2 to 86 and Lady Gwen down 2 to 96..\n\nPete Mordaunt sent me this letter and it is worth reading..\n\nUS Open news.. Brits in action..\n\nAlthough Football is not my number one sport Sven-Goran Eriksson's death yesterday was a sad one to read.. We have all followed his journey since he was diagnosed with cancer.. A brave strong man who was good at his profession, and a very interesting character.\n\nDid you watch this??\n\nPlus 14 and dry when driving in. 10mm of rain over the weekend\n\nBank Holiday Monday..\n\nMost of my team went to the Feastival over the weekend..Mat said most of the local racing world was there..\n\nEngland won the first test against Sri Lanka and now the second test starts at Lord's on Thursday\n\nLando Norris won the Dutch Grand Prix..\n\nThe big flat trainers must have loved the fact that a hurdler won their prestigeous Ebor Handicap at York on Saturday..Henry de Bromhead's Magical Zoe simply bolted up.. And by the jump stallion Shantou (Same sire as Chianti Classico!)\n\nSaturday afternoon I was minding my own business when the phone rang.. I was asked if I accepted visitors on a Saturday afternoon.. Yes..\n\nIt turned out that Joanne Salley was driving past on the way to Bristol Airport with her father Nicholas.. Keen to visit and pass the time..Never a problem.. Joanne had been at the opening of Jeremy Clarkson's new pub The Farmers Dog.. In fact, she has been painting the walls.. Murals?\n\nYesterday Mrs B and I had lunch with her brother in Northamptonshire..\n\nThe drive from here to Weedon is probably the worst cross country journey you can have. The roads are like a third world country!.. The lunch was not..\n\nWe drove past my old yard at Preston Capes.. Just to bring back the memories!!\n\nTennis.. The US Open starts today..\n\nA nurse walks into a Bank, exhausted after her 20 hour shift\n\nShe pulls a rectal theomometer out of her pocket and tries to write a cheque with it.\n\nShe looks at the cashier and says.. ''Well, that's just great!.. Some asshole has got my pen!''\n\nPlus 13 and raining when driving in.\n\nBank Holiday weekends are all about rain and looks like this one will start that way.\n\nMrs B went a padel demonstration at Far Peaks last night.. Apparently Padel is the new 'in' game?\n\nA man in the crowd at Old Trafford yesterday took an outrageous one-handed catch while his other hand held his beers.. Brilliant stuff which repeated all over the TV....He is now a internet star...\n\nMany years ago, I was a guest of Jeremy Deeds at the Oval for an Ashes Test, when Allan Border hit the ball high into the stands.. Smugly I held out one hand to catch it.. while also holding two beers......I dropped it.... and that too was replayed all around the ground on TV and on BBC (shows how long ago it was!)..\n\n5 minutes later, when I was trying to hide my embarrassment, my phone rang..it was my ex assistant Eddie Hales ringing from Ireland to lambast me for dropping the catch. ''You could never catch!''\n\nMarcus Amytage who was the person sitting next to me was so amused by the whole incident that he commissioned Peter Curling to sketch a reminder.. the picture now lives in my office!\n\nDave Walters and Ciaran Gethings were in to ride out.\n\nGary and Tracy Betley were here third lot to see their KBRS horse Phantom Getaway.\n\nGood to see Mike Evans here too.. Mike owns and runs the best Golf course in Gloucestershire.. Royal Shipton..\n\nI am not the most avid reader of books (currently reading The Elephant Whisperer) but when I do I have to 'get into them' very quickly.. I enjoyed 'Won't you dance for Virat Kohli' and now the author Rob Harris has sent me another book to keep me amused..The Absurb Life Of Barry White.\n\nKeith Ellis sent me this joke..\n\nA little girl was leaning into a lion's cage.....\n\nSuddenly, the lion grabs her by the collar of her jacket and tries to pull her inside to slaughter her, all under the eyes of her screaming parents:\n\nA biker jumps off his Harley, runs to the cage, and hits the lion square on the nose with a powerful punch...Whimpering from the pain, the lion jumps back, letting go of the girl, and the biker brings the girl to her terrified parents, who thank him endlessly.\n\nA BBC reporter, had watched the whole event and addressing the Harley rider, says, \"Sir, this was the most gallant and bravest thing I've seen a man do in my whole life.”\n\nThe Harley rider replies. \"Why, it was nothing, really. The lion was behind bars. I just saw this little kid in danger and acted as I felt right.”\n\nThe reporter said . \"Well, I'll make sure this won't go unnoticed. I'm a BBC journalist, you know, and tomorrow's news will run this story. So, what do you do for a living, and what political affiliation do you have?”\n\nThe biker replies. \"I'm a Modi supporter who is tirelessly working for future strong India ”\n\nThe journalist leaves.\n\nThe following morning, the biker turns on BBC News to see if it indeed brings news of his actions.\n\nBBC Headline: \"MODI SUPPORTER ASSAULTS AFRICAN IMMIGRANT AND STEALS HIS LUNCH.\"\n\nAnd THAT pretty much sums of the BBC's approach to the news these days..\n\nOn that note..\n\nHave a great weekend and see you on Monday.. Bank holiday Monday!\n\nPlus 16 and dry when driving in. 5mm of rain overnight\n\nThat was an interesting morning yesterday..\n\nLoads of respect for Ginny Thompson and good to see Heros de Romay enjoying his flat work.. Should stand him in good stead for his chasing season..\n\nGinny was a huge help with First Flow.. As she described him yesterday.. a loveable odd ball.. Incidentally First Flow has settled in well to his new home with Kayleigh in Ireland\n\nFrom there to meet Kerry Millership.. What a joy to see her place and see such happy horses doing their pre training. Top Target, I Spy A Diva and Getaweapon.\n\nJohn and Penny Perriss, Mrs B and I headed just down the road for a light lunch at The Bower House in Shipton on Stour.. Their food was a revelation…\n\nRain stopped play in the First Sri Lanka Test..\n\nWe watched Michael Mosely..Wonders Of The Human Body last night.. How could such a remarkable man not be with us..Tragic..\n\nFriday morning and not a great deal happening here which is why Maya, my PA, took early leave to go off and enjoy the Big Feastival weekend.. Yes, we are about to start the last Bank Holiday weekend of the year... On that note happy driving!\"\n\nTom Bellamy was in to ride out.\n\nFriday vet visit..\n\nLove all the captions suggestions from yesterdays blog..\n\nThe winner was, in jest, from Marian Draper..'Do you plait your tail EVERY day? Pulling it would save you so much time'\n\nPlus 16, dry and windy when driving in. I don’t think we will be dry all day?\n\nWorcester…Best grass cover in any paddock..\n\nGerard Mentor completed his first chase well.. jumping well and ran OK.. He will have learnt from the experience and will surely find a race soon..\n\nLady Gwen was for her fairly well behaved, and Tom Bellamy was very relaxed on LG when she was trying or rather thinking about misbehaving..\n\nTom who rode her last time was adamant that 2miles 4 furlongs was what she needed.. Ummmm was my thought, but it was worth the try.. Anyway, she was getting into the race like a horse with a great chance but then 2 furlongs from home the petrol ran out..\n\nTom Bellamy take a bow.. Tom admitted to the owners post-race that he was wrong and LG did not stay..How refreshing..\n\nWorcester might not be on the top of my racecourse list, but it has certainly moved off the bottom. They are trying and the owners and trainers room, although not ideal, at least it had good food which helps ..Owners experience is important..\n\nA postscript to Worcester.. Maya my PA came racing as she knew that I had such a long wait between the first and last race that she could sit me down and make me read through our 2024/2025 brochure..She complained that she can never tie me down in the office??\n\nThose of you who watched Aiden O’Brien take over York yesterday on ITV would have enjoyed listening and watching Ruby Walsh and his post-race analysis of City Of Troy winning the Juddmonte International.. There is no better person at it, he was just brilliant yesterday… Equally brilliant is Aiden O’Brien, who surely will be Champion Flat trainer in England.\n\nGood news from Basingstoke Hospital.. All Pandora’s three girls are now with her..\n\nFirst test.. England had a good day..\n\nThursday morning brought in Phil Case and Richard Dowle.. Phil was here to see his KBRS horses Parc d’Amour, El Rio, Percy Veering and Fair Fronteries.\n\nI went over to Ginny Thompson to watch her ride Heros de Romay.. Ginny is pre training Heros..\n\nFrom there I went to see John Perriss’s horses in pre training with Kerry Millership..Kerry is based near Shipton On Stour\n\nJohn Arlott was quoted as saying...\n\nCricket is a most precarious profession; it is called a team game but, in fact, no one is so lonely as a batsman facing a bowler supported by ten fieldsmen and observed by two umpires to ensure that his error does not go unpunished.\n\nPlus 11 and dry when driving in.\n\nMrs B and I spent part of yesterday afternoon at Rockhampton watching Archie play for Gloucestershire 2nds against my old home county of Essex..\n\nFrom there we were meant to have driven to The John Ratcliffe in Oxford to see my daughter and her three little girls, but she rang early afternoon to tell me that they were moving her, and Savannah and Sienna to Basingstoke..\n\nApparently, the JR needed two of the three HD cots so they looked to moving all three, plus Pandora to either Swindon or Basingstoke, but neither had enough spare HD Cots for three.. so two moved, and hopefully the third Araminta will follow shortly.. All rather stressful..\n\nWhile at Rockhampton watching Archie, a lovely old boy who follows Gloucestershire and lives near Thornbury, asked me if I could find out what has happened, or where Rodney Farrant is/was.. The last he had heard from Rodney was that he was still living just outside Lambourn.. Anyway, if anybody can help please let me know..that would be hugely appreciated and I will pass on the any info..\n\nWednesday morning.\n\nCiaran Gethings was in to ride out..\n\nAlan James, John Battershall and Nick Cook all called in to see their respective KBRS horses..It was a long morning!\n\nI head to Worcester this evening to saddle Gerard Mentor and Lady Gwen.. First and last race.. Anyway, for my thoughts please click here.\n\nBob Mackenzie sent this email over..There were 79 eliminations for Worcester tonight, though many of them will be the same horse eliminated from 2 races. It seems crazy that so many bill paying owners can't get a run. There'll be plenty eliminated from the 0-100 at Abbot on Thursday as well.\n\nThere were 22 eliminated from the 7.35 Worcester. Of the 14 allowed to run, 2 were declared for a similar race on Monday...\n\nMoving on..York Races.. Their top quality 4 day meeting starts today.. I love going to York..\n\nEngland play Sri Lanka at Old Trafford today.. First day of their three match series.\n\nIt was a hot, sultry day, the game was boring, and the two batsmen had put on three runs in the last hour.\n\nSuddenly, outside the ground, the peace was shattered by a car backfiring.\n\nA spectator jumped up and shouted, 'That it! Let's all go home! The scorer's shot himself!'\n\nPlus 16 and drizzling when driving in.\n\nIt was blustery at Worcester, but dry. Fast old ground..\n\nJeudidee has been unlucky on both starts over fences. He fell at the third last when going well at Stratford and yesterday he was nearly brought down at the second and then travelled well into the straight, looking very promising when he slipped on landing at the third last.. That was his race over!..\n\nIt was Ciaran Gethings first ride back from breaking his collarbone, so he was pleased to be back on a racecourse... and completing without any hiccups..\n\nIt was good to see the smiling faces of the Worcester regulars.. Cornelius Lysaght and Nigel Kirby.. Apparently, the new weighing room is that comfortable that Cornelius was thinking of staying there for the next couple of nights.. The traffic could be awful on Wednesday for their Evening meeting and he does not want to be late..\n\nTalking awful...Hard to believe the number of horses balloted out (79) at Worcester for tomorrow’s evening meeting..Both Faerie Cutlass and Samatian were both balloted out.. If you think that the average rating for a jumper is rated 99 then there are just not enough 0/95 races for this time of year.. Two very disappointed owners..\n\nTuesday morning... No movers or shakers as there has been no jump racing for a while.\n\nWhen your lucks out it often remains like that for a while.. To lose Black Collar and then to lose her colt foal is a real double whammy..\n\nMrs B and I are heading to Oxford later to see my daughter Pandora and meet my new grandchildren.. all three of them.\n\nThe best all time Edinburgh Frange jokes..\n\n\"I started dating a zookeeper, but it turned out he was a cheetah.\"\n\n\"I tried to steal spaghetti from the shop, but the female guard saw me and I couldn't get pasta.\"\n\n\"I keep randomly shouting out 'broccoli' and 'cauliflower' - I think I might have florets.\"\n\n\"Working at the Jobcentre has to be a tense job - knowing that if you get fired, you still have to come in the next day.\"\n\n\"I'm not a fan of the new pound coin, but then again, I hate all change.\"\n\n\"My dad suggested I register for a donor card, he is a man after my own heart\"\n\nPlus 10 and dry when driving in.\n\nThat was a weekend of two weddings.. George and Melanie’s on Friday and Figaro’s on Saturday..\n\nFriday weddings seem to have become the new norm..\n\nI find it difficult to get used to as in my day Weddings were usually held on a Saturday and then Sunday followed. Now the whole weekend follows.. so much so that on Saturday night, which felt like a Sunday night, Mrs B and I joined her parents Fred and Cilla for a night at the Opera..\n\nPicnic and Opera at Willowside Farm in Withington..\n\nAbout 150 people brought picnics and laid them out on the front lawn of David and Jane Bruce’s home while watching The Hewlett Opera present The Marriage Of Figaro…. It was certainly different and fun, although not the warm evening most had hoped for. At least it did not rain.\n\nLunch yesterday with Rory and Davina (Mini) Muster\n\nMat was not that happy with his team drawing with Bournemouth.. He was very adamant that a win was the only way to start the season..Why worry it is only Bournemouth I said before the match..but Mat was already out with the excuses when telling me that Bournemouth had spent a fortune on a player....\n\nSad to read that Howard Wright has died. Howard was one of the founding member of the Racing Post and a great man to deal with. Helpful and charming with a great sense of fun. I always enjoy my chats with him..\n\nAlso sad to read that Black Caviar has died.. I saw her win at Royal Ascot.. She was some beast of a horse.\n\nLaura Collett back home..\n\nMonday morning and the start of a new week.. A few more horses back in from grass.\n\nJohn Benson was here third lot to see his KBRS horses Parc D'Amoui, El Rio and Phantom Getaway.\n\nWe have a runner later at Worcester.. Jeudidee heads there and for my thoughts please click here.\n\nTop 5 Edinburgh Fringe jokes..\n\n“I was going to sail around the globe in the world’s smallest ship but I bottled it.” Mark Simmons\n\n“I’ve been taking salsa lessons for months, but I just don’t feel like I’m progressing. It’s just one step forward, two steps back.” Alec Snook\n\n“Ate horse at a restaurant once — wasn’t great. Starter was all right but the mane was dreadful.” Alex Kitson\n\n“I sailed through my driving test. That’s why I failed it.” Arthur Smith\n\n“I love the Olympics. My friend and I invented a new type of relay baton: well, he came up with the idea, I ran with it” Mark Simmons\n\nPlus 11 and dry when waking in Northamptonshire.\n\nThat was a very happy wedding yesterday.\n\nSandie Wilkinson was looking so proud of her daughter Melanie.. Radiant to say the least, as were the new Mr and Mrs George Sweeting.\n\nThat is probably the last wedding we will be attending this year..Christenings next?\n\nCiaran Gethings ad Tom Bellamy were in to ride out.\n\nJoe Goldring was in to see his KBRS horse Parc D'Amour\n\nMat heads North today to watch his beloved football team take on Bournemouth\n\nSaturday morning gripe..\n\nOver the year I am asked to donate 'Mornings On the Gallop' to a quiet a few Charities and I am always delighted to help..\n\nBut I do draw the line when I receive a round robin email asking for something which starts 'Hi' or sometimes not even that..\n\nLast week I was asked to donate £100 towards a charity event which opened with the title as.. 'Good morning'…\n\nPlease, if you would like me to offer a prize could you please put my name in the address bar.. make it personal as it might help?\n\nOne for the weekend...\n\nPaddy went to his local supermarket after a lunchtime session to do some shopping. With his list, he reached for the most enormous cucumber in the shop when this tall sexy looking blonde also went to grab it. “Oh yeah, I bet I know now why you want the biggest one,” he winked.\n\n“You’ve got me”, she giggled, “Do you fancy coming back to mine and watching?”\n\n“No thanks,” said Paddy, “I’ve got better things to do with my time than be standing around watching a woman make sandwiches.”\n\nHave a great weekend and see you on Monday.."
