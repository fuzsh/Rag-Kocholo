        "text": "Clive is a proud former Royal Marine from Edinburgh living with a number of service-related injuries that are seriously impacting his everyday life. He has a bullet fragment in his brain, suffers from memory loss and has been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nStruggling with the cost of living and currently on benefits, Clive nevertheless refuses to give in, and is doing all he can to lead the best life he can. He is working hard to resolve his financial issues and desperately wants to return to work.\n\nCue RMA – The Royal Marines Charity who, having identified Clive’s issues with help from the Royal British Legion, awarded Clive a grant to enable him to continue taking the positive steps to improve his life and overall well-being.\n\nShooting stars\n\nLast weekend, another very successful Royal Marines Browning Charity Clay Shoot took place at the Dunkeld House Hotel in Perthshire. In glorious weather, the 2023 event was well supported by County Clays shoot ground and a number of major sponsors. The weekend was a sell-out with a maximum 198 shooters taking part, constrained only by the number that can sit at the tables during the evening meal and auction.\n\nThe magnificent Corps of Drums was once again present, as was the Naval Regional Commander Scotland and Northern Ireland Brigadier Andy Muddiman ADC and Major General Martin Smith CB, the president of the Royal Marines Association for the Scottish region.\n\nNext year, being the 360th anniversary of the formation of the Corps, organisers Barry and Elaine Barnwell – who have successfully run this event for nine years – are hoping to make it an extra special occasion with VVIPs and a full Royal Marines Marching Band.\n\nThis was, as always, a superb event organised by the Charity’s Regional Chairman (Scotland & Northern Ireland) Barry Barnwell and his wife Elaine (pictured above in middle), who each year put in huge amounts of effort to ensure the event is delivered and everyone has a fantastic time. And overall, when all is tallied up, it is expected to have raised around a whopping £50k!\n\nWe are enormously grateful to them both for their incredible support and dedication to RMA – The Royal Marines Charity.\n\nPhoto: RMA – The Royal Marines Charity’s Chief Executive Ben Curry (right) with Membership Operations Director (East) Richie Puttock (left) and Nick Holloway Relationship Manager, Scotland, Major General Martin Smith CB (third left), Barry & Elaine Barnwell (centre) with Brigadier Andy Muddiman ADC (2nd right).\n\nSimon Jupp MP visit\n\nOur Chief Operating Officer, Si Wright (pictured right) hosted Simon Jupp, local MP for East Devon, during a visit to the Charity’s new HQ in The CHAMP Building at the Lympstone Commando Training Centre Royal Marines (CTCRM).\n\nSi said; “It was fantastic to welcome Simon to our new Charity HQ – The CHAMP Building – this morning. This was his second visit to CTCRM in Lympstone but the first to the RMA-The Royal Marines Charity. CTCRM and the wider Corps family is such a large presence within Simon’s constituency of East Devon, and he has been a great advocate of both since becoming our local MP.\n\nI hope that we gave him a strengthened understanding of the lifelong support we offer as the Royal Marines’ combined charity and Association and that he left also knowing our appreciation for his continued support is valued.”\n\nDuring his tour of the site, Mr Jupp praised the charity’s work at both a local and national level in supporting the serving Corps, veterans and their families. He said; “We owe a great deal to the elite Royal Marines veterans who’ve served our country. I’ve raised the amazing work of The Royal Marines Charity in Parliament on multiple occasions.\n\nWe’re so lucky to have them based in our part of Devon and the new headquarters is a testament to their tireless commitment to those who have sacrificed so much to keep us safe.”\n\nAll fired up!\n\nOur Employment & Education team has been kept busy with two particularly big and influential networking opportunities.\n\nHead of Employment & Education, Zoe Darnbrough (pictured top) had the enormous pleasure of attending another outstanding networking event held by Bootnecks in2 Business at HMS Belfast, with thanks to The Imperial War Museum and Darren Kitching.\n\nBootnecks in2 Business ensures that every former Royal Marines Commando, irrespective of rank or specialisation, leverages the Royal Marines network.\n\nZoe says: “I cannot stress enough the importance of this network in aiding transition. We are extremally proud to be partnered with Bootnecks in2 Business. I can’t thank them enough for the commitment they give to our service leavers and veterans. The network truly works and we would not be able to do so much of what we do within the Employment and Education team, without them.”\n\nMeanwhile, another team member put in miles of walking around the DSEI (Defence and Security Equipment International) exhibition at ExCel London, making the most of the opportunity to meet some of the many companies there from all over the world, as well as catch up with former Royal Marines, including Brigantes’ CEO and E&E Committee Member, Matthew Williams.\n\n“Managing to get talking to people and companies about the work we do as the Royal Marines own charity and exchanging many business cards, the actual work starts now, following up potential opportunities for our service leavers with companies such as Fujitsu, Deloitte, QinetiQ, Babcock to name just a few.”"
