        "text": "Marching proudly in line, the Royal Marines exercised their Freedom of the City of Newcastle for the first time.\n\nCommandos from 43 Commando Royal Marines took part in Saturday’s parade – the first of its kind since the Corps was granted the Freedom of the City of Newcastle in 1989.\n\nAnd their family and friends proudly watched as they gathered in front of the Civic Centre where the Lord Mayor of Newcastle, Coun George Pattison, and Commandant General Royal Marines, Major General Martin Smith MBE, took the salute.\n\nOperations Colour Sgt David Weatherspoon, 34, of Chester-le-Street, County Durham, who has been out to Iraq and Afghanistan, was watched by his wife Nicola and 13-month-old son Joe. He said: “It is a very proud moment to take part and it is the first time Joe has seen dad at work. He’s never seen me like this before.”\n\nWife Nicola, 31, a senior lecturer, said: “It is quite symbolic for Joe to see his dad like this and it is lovely for Joe to be part of it.”\n\nMarine Chris Nisbet, 22, of Wallsend, North Tyneside, said: “It is a very proud time for me to march down the streets I grew up in. I only hope I don’t muck it up.”\n\nColour Sgt Andy Walker, 27, of North Shields, North Tyneside, who has carried out three tours in Afghanistan and one in Sierra Leone, said: “I’m very proud to wear the uniform and take part in the march.”\n\nThe parade proceeded along St Mary’s Place, Northumberland Road, Northumberland, John Dobson, Percy and Blackett streets.\n\nThe Freedom of the City means Royal Marines are able to march through the streets with “bayonets fixed, colours flying and bands playing” and on Saturday the men of 43 Commando were accompanied by the Band of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines Scotland, Royal Marine cadets and members of the Royal Marines Association.\n\nSaturday was the first time the Green Berets have exercised their right to march in Newcastle since Freedom was granted 25 years ago and is made all the more poignant as 2014 marks the 350th anniversary of the Corps’ formation.\n\nFollowing the parade, the Royal Marines took part in various activities around the Newcastle Gateshead Quayside at the City Games venue, including a free concert performance by the Band of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines Scotland, an abseil off the Baltic Tower and an unarmed combat display.\n\nLord Mayor of Newcastle, Coun George Pattison, said: “I am delighted the Royal Marines are marching though our city in celebration of 350 years.”"
