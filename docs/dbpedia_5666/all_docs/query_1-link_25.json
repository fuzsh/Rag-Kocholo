        "text": "School for CEOs prepare business leaders for senior roles - purposefully, pragmatically and personally. We do this by discussing the unique insights of our Faculty of over 90 senior leaders at our programmes, who share their personal experiences and challenges as CEOs, Non-Executive Directors and Chairs.\n\nThis podcast is designed to share some of those stories with you, inviting a diverse range of speakers from CEOs of some of the UK's most successful businesses, to elite sportspeople and military leaders. Episodes are released on the first Monday of each month.\n\nPrevious episodes have featured School for CEOs Managing Partner, David Sole, CEO of Metro Bank, Craig Donaldson, and Inclusion & Diversity specialist Sue Pascoe. Today we are delighted to share our fourth episode, featuring former Royal Marines Officers...\n\nMartin Smith CB MBE and Peter Macdonald have led distinguished careers, both of which began in the special forces. Martin spent over three decades in the Royal Marines, reaching the role of Commandant General and was most recently NATO advisor to the Minister of the Interior in Afghanistan, while Peter transitioned into business after 11 years of service, taking on global leadership roles in Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nMartin participated on the Vital Few programme after leaving the forces in 2018 and joined maritime and oil & gas cyber security specialist Cyber Prism as Chief Operating Officer later that year. Peter is now Chairman of renewable energy company Castle European."
