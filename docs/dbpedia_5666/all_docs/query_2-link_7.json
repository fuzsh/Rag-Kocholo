        "text": "Since joining Manpower UK in 2016, my career has gone from strength to strength.\n\nMy move into recruitment came after 15 years in the Royal Marines and Royal Navy and a successful career spanning life as a Royal Marines Commando and Royal Navy Photographer and Videographer. After being medically discharged with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), I suddenly found himself in search of a new career. Now a Lead Consultant in the Southampton Regional team, I look after Engineering and Technical recruitment across the South Coast.\n\nDiscovering a second career…\n\nI’m not going to lie. When I left the Armed Forces I was lost. I had anticipated a longer career doing the job I had dreamt of since childhood, so for that to be cut short unexpectedly when I was diagnosed with PTSD, left me wondering what I could do next. I felt at a disadvantage not knowing exactly what my career options were – and I had just three months to find the answer.\n\nMy meeting with Manpower was a game-changer. Looking back, I can honestly say I had the full candidate experience. The first consultant I met with took time to talk through my existing skills and the potential roles available to me. The input was excellent and I was surprised at the number of different routes my transferable skills could take me.\n\nTalking through my skills led to a discussion about recruitment, which wasn’t an area I had considered before. But one of the many benefits of being in the Forces is that you are capable of talking to anyone, at every level, whether it’s the CEO or someone on the assembly line. You learn how to engage effectively at the right level and bring the best out of people, which was key to becoming a successful consultant.\n\nEmbracing change and creating a new future…\n\nOnce I had the direction and drive to enter recruitment, the transition was far easier. I joined Manpower via the Career Transition Partnership (CTP) – an agreement between the MoD and Right Management, which provides employment opportunities, careers advice and resettlement support for Service leavers. I embarked on a work trial and the rest they say is history! A lot has changed since 2016 and there have been many highlights, but there are three I’m particularly proud of:\n\nI’ve had the opportunity to be involved in a lot of interesting and meaningful projects for the Army Families Federation, which helps Armed Forces spouses obtain the necessary skills to gain meaningful work. Our research found that many spouses lacked the ability and capability to find meaningful employment and subsequently we set up a working group to support them. We created a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere packed with drop-in sessions such as CV writing techniques, interview preparation and LinkedIn etiquette to support their job search.\n\nWorking on this project filled me with great pride and really resonated with me. My wife returned to work when I left the forces, so it was a challenge I had first-hand experience of.\n\nIn 2017, I was honoured to join Mark Cahill, Managing Director, ManpowerGroup UK, and David Duffy, General Manager UK, Right Management, to represent the organisation when ManpowerGroup achieved the Defence Employer Recognition Scheme (ERS) Gold Award, for demonstrating its commitment to being an Armed Forces-friendly organisation. We are also a signatory of the Armed Forces Covenant, a pledge to ensure that those who serve or have served and their families are treated fairly, and to support the forces through services, policy and projects.\n\nMore recently, I’ve been selected for the European Future Leaders Programme. The 12-month programme instils the blocks of leadership within people and culminates with meeting other European colleagues from across the ManpowerGroup including Experis, Manpower Solutions and Right Management.\n\nI’m the only Manpower UK consultant in the programme, so it’s a great chance to get an insight into what other people do across the wider organisation and what the Group can offer to both clients and candidates. My regional manager, Emma Craney, nominated me and the recognition is amazing and not something I take for granted. I’ve completed two work groups which focus on how to get the very best out of people; an area I can bring my Armed Forces experience to.\n\nEnhancing existing skills and continuously learning…\n\nThe skills I acquired in the Armed Forces continue to aid my development. The Marines and the Navy operate very different leadership models: the Marines lead from the front, whereas the Navy is more inclusive. By blending those skills, I’ve learnt how to become a better leader and now lead two people – Beth White and Natalie Mackay – who are part of the engineering and manufacturing team here.\n\nThere are many other skills I apply to my current role, including discipline. I continue to embrace the Royal Marines ethos of honesty and integrity, as well as courage and determination: all attributes that complement ManpowerGroup’s own values and behaviours.\n\nWe still have much to learn…\n\nWhile it’s great to see positive conversation increasing around PTSD and mental health issues, we still have some way to go. ManpowerGroup is tackling this head on: we have a Mental Health First Aid Instructor who is in the process of training Mental Health First Aiders throughout the group to support our people internally; however, we are going further and offering this as a service to our clients. In other areas, our managers are currently undergoing Mental Health Awareness training so they can support their staff across the full range of mental health needs.\n\nWhen I reflect on the number of personnel deployed to conflict zones during my own career in the Armed Forces… it’s a lot of people to consider in terms of ‘hidden injuries’. Like many people, I try to remain positive even when times are hard. I have a great team and support network and whether you’re struggling at work or at home, I’d encourage anyone to reach out to family, friends, colleagues or a medical professional if they feel they need support.\n\nWatch this short video to hear more!\n\n#ShowYourSupport #Veteran #FormerRoyalMarine #FormerCommando #ManpowerGroup #ManpowerGroupLife"
