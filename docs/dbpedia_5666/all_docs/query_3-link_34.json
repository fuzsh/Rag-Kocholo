        "text": "Robert (Bob) Martin Smith, 96, graduated from his earthly home to the presence of his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on Thursday, April 13, at The Williamsport Home, surrounded by immediate family.\n\nBob is survived by his children, Winnie (Mike) Kremser of Montoursville; Sallie (Norm) Pure, of Ithaca, NY; Jim (Nancy) Smith, of Reading; Eileen (Harry) Bettig, of Cary, NC; grandchildren, Kellie (Matt) Karschner, Erin Kremser, Alissa, Emma, and Tyler (Chelsea) Pure, Brandon (fiancee Jamie Marrs), Kyle (Alexis), and Alex Smith; great-grandchildren, Caden Karschner, Juliet, and Lydia Smith; daughter-in-law, Tina Smith; and step-sister, Sandra Shoemaker.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his wife of 52 years, Betty Patrick Smith; son, John Smith; parents, Earl and Mary Lear Smith; stepmother, Ruth Smith; sisters, Elizabeth Smith, Ruth Williard, Relda Stites, and Martha Houser.\n\nBob was born at home in Grantham, on Nov. 23, 1926. He attended Hershey High School’s vocational program (electric shop). Three days before turning 18, he left high school to fulfill his call to the Merchant Marines, later completing his GED. This service took him to numerous countries, and various adventures with a beloved memory being transporting hundreds of animals for Heifer International. Following this, he served stateside for several years with the U.S. Army.\n\nMaybe his part-time jobs at Hershey Chocolate during high school made him “sweet” on Betty Jane Patrick, a Hershey employee, whom he met on a blind date. They married on June 1, 1957, and quickly grew to a family of seven. During their 52 years of marriage, they traveled to Alaska, Hawaii, and other states to fulfill Betty’s dreams of visiting all 50 states. A highlight of a long road trip in 1999 was renewing their wedding vows at the Little Brown Church in the Vale in Nashua, Iowa.\n\nBob’s post-military career was in the vending industry. His skills and work ethic led him from humble beginnings as a salesman with no experience to operations manager, and eventually manager/part owner.\n\nHis hobby of woodworking was lovingly displayed most often for his children and grandchildren, in projects both large and small. Many will remember him as a “MacGyver” kind of fella — quite handy and able to fix/work out almost anything.\n\nWhen it was time to downsize, Bob and Betty moved to The Williamsport Home apartments, but this certainly did not mean inactivity for him! As long as he was physically able, he served many years on several committees (sometimes as chairman), was active in the monthly hymn sing, ABC Singers, as bingo-caller, pool-player with “the guys,” and other roles in his building.\n\nAdditional volunteer activities, where the circle of those who love and respect Bob always grew, included over two decades at the Divine Providence Hospital, and many years as an usher at the Community Arts Center. He was also an active member, and sometimes club president, of Rotary clubs.\n\nBob will be remembered as a faithful and dedicated husband, dependable, loving and selfless father, a humble servant, who desired to make things better, a man of integrity for whom faith, morals and biblical values were important.\n\nA Celebration of Life Service will be held at St. John’s-Newberry United Methodist Church in Williamsport, at 11 a.m. on Saturday, Sept. 2, 2023.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be made to: Heifer International (heifer.org/give/giving-in-honor), St. John’s-Newberry United Methodist Church (stjnumc.com), 2101 Newberry St., Williamsport, PA 17701), or Trans World Radio/TWR (twr.org/give), PO Box 8700, Cary, NC 27512-8700)."
