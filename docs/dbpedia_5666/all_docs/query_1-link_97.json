        "text": "Noble Marine Marlow Ropes RS200 National Championship at Mount's Bay Sailing Club - Day 4\n\nby MJ Gifford 8 Aug 18:46 BST\n\nSadly, today there was no racing at the Noble Marine Marlow Ropes RS200 UK Nationals. Your intrepid reporter was sent to seek out an alternative story to cover in a grey, windy, drizzly Marazion.\n\nAfter a short ponder I decided to go and interview the spectators from yesterday's racing and get their view on events. After donning my wetsuit and swimming out into the bay, I found the pod of dolphins that had caused such delight among the fleet. I have provided a translation for those that don't speak \"click and whistle\".\n\nDolly the Dolphin - I am so glad you have come out to see us. Where are all your friends?...and where is your boat?\n\nMJG - I am sorry to say that we haven't been allowed to launch today. The race officer said he was worried about losing people.\n\nDtD - That is a shame, we really enjoyed yesterday's racing. There were all these fins zipping around, whizz, whizz, whizz. Then they changed direction, whizz, whizz, whizz again. Some of them changed back, even more whizzing. Then they went round the red mark and whizzed off even faster! The calves loved that bit.\n\nMJG - Do you watch a lot of sailing?\n\nDtD - Oh yes, we watch loads. We travel around to get to the best events but Mounts Bay and the RS200s are our favourites so we were really excited for this week. When we heard who was coming we just had to be here. Imagine getting to watch all these famous sailors all in the same place. I think the class has such a great range of ages, sizes and abilities. Some of the kids are so cute and it is great that the old people are still able to get around the boat. I do worry for them a bit, they are only one slip away from doing themselves a mischief. We watched you all trundle up the mount to meet Lord & Lady St.Levan and we love it when they illuminate the castle for you sailors.\n\nMJG - What have you made of the racing so far?\n\nDtD - We only watched the second race yesterday as we had to go and chase some sardines earlier in the day. That is one of the problems for us, there is always the day job. The racing itself was great. People were up, then down, then back up. The windward marks were pretty hectic and the runs were spectacular. I was really impressed with Ben and Lorna, they had to work pretty hard to get through to the lead. I don't know how Ben managed to keep his concentration with all the squealing that Lorna did when she saw us.\n\nMJG - What plans do you have for tomorrow?\n\nDtD - We will probably watch the first race but I don't think we will manage all three as there is a school of herring due through at about 12:30. I hope we get to catch the finish of the third race though. It is so finally balanced with any of the first four still in contention. The best bit will be all the whizzing though, I am not sure I really mind whether the boats are winning or losing. In some ways the middle of the fleet is the best bit, so many more fins!\n\nMJG - Do you think you will make it to Abersoch next year?\n\nDtD - Definitely, it is another great venue and I am sure the competition will be strong again. Hopefully we will cause a bit more squealing.\n\nMJG - Thanks for your time and for making yesterday such a special day on the water. Is there any chance of a tow back to the beach???\n\nResults after Day 4:"
