        "text": "RACQ calls for Bruce Highway improvement\n\nAhead of the state election in October, RACQ – along with the Local Government Association of Queensland (LGAQ), Queensland Farmers Federation (QFF), Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS Qld), Queensland Trucking Association (QTA), and Queensland Tourism Industry Council (QTIC) – is urging political parties to commit to a 10-year funding plan with the federal government.\n\n“We need a 10-year funding commitment from the state and federal governments to continue upgrading the Bruce Highway by widening narrow sections and bridges, installing more overtaking lanes, and progressively duplicating the road to a dual carriageway standard, like the Hume and Pacific Highways in NSW and Victoria,” said RACQ managing director and CEO David Carter.\n\nBruce Highway AusRAP star rating\n\nThe club’s analysis of AusRAP crash data from 2018 to 2022 indicated that upgrades, such as the installation of dual carriageways on the Hume and Pacific Highways, have nearly eradicated head-on crash risks. Head-on collisions represent a significant portion (81) of the fatalities on the Bruce Highway.\n\nIn comparison, 1,398 kilometres of the Bruce Highway, stretching from Gympie to Cairns, remains single-lane and undivided. This section has an average FSI crash rate three times higher than rural sections of the Pacific Highway and five times higher than those on the Hume Highway.\n\n“The Bruce Highway is the backbone of this state, it’s supposed to be a national highway but when you compare it to the Pacific or Hume, it’s substandard,” he said. “Those interstate highways have rightfully been upgraded to three, four, and five stars out of five for infrastructure safety, yet around half of the Bruce is still a poor two-star rating. In 2024, there is no way Queensland should have any two-star sections on the Bruce Highway.”\n\nCalls for returning to previous funding-split for Bruce Highway enhancement\n\nRACQ and the other organisations are also pushing for a return to the previous 80-20 federal-state funding split for the highway’s improvements. They are seeking commitments for a delegation to Canberra in November to secure this funding arrangement.\n\n“As the level of government closest to their communities, councils see the huge emotional toll that crash deaths and injuries create, even before you come to the economic cost,” she said. “Ensuring more funding flows to improve road safety across our decentralised state is critical to Queensland councils because it is critical to improving the liveability of their local communities.”\n\n“The Bruce Highway is a highway of state significance providing an important conduit for many agriculture industries while also supporting economic development throughout the State,” she said. “Maintaining and enhancing transport and freight infrastructure is not only vital to support agricultural supply chains, which in turn ensures we as consumers have access to affordable Australian produce; it also ensures the safety of regional Queenslanders reliant on these roads.”"
