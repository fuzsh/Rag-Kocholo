With a vast set-list of over 100 pop-punk and emo songs, attendees can choose from a wide array of beloved tracks from bands such as Just Surrender, Freshman 15, Weatherbox, Big D and the Kids Table, Jet Lag Gemini and more.

Sign-ups for performances are on a first-come, first-served basis, so be sure to arrive early to secure your spot. To ensure everyone stays on track, several TVs will display scrolling lyrics, and the band members will be on hand for backup vocals.\n\nThe Vault's new owner Michelle Pimentel shared her excitement about the event, saying, “We have a huge karaoke fan base in our city that needed to be touched upon. I had people bring this event up to me, and the perfect opportunity arose, where people can feel like a rock star and utilize our stage.”\n\nREAD MORE: This New Bedford Bar Was the Ultimate Party Spot and It's Missed\n\nFor those looking to grab a bite before the show, the pub side of The Vault will be open from 2 p.m. Tickets are available for purchase in advance at a discount or can be bought at the door.\n\nThe event is for people 21 and older with valid ID.
