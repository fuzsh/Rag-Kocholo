        "text": "The bodies of 10 British servicemen who died in Iraq have arrived home at RAF Brize Norton.\n\nSenior military officers and public figures are attending the formal arrival of the coffins, draped in Union flags.\n\nThree soldiers died in an advance on Basra at the weekend, bringing the total UK war dead to 30.\n\nOne was 18-year-old Fusilier Kelan John Turrington and another was named as Lance Corporal Ian Malone of the Irish Guards, 28. The third soldier will not be named until his family is informed.\n\nThe following comments reflect the balance of views we have received:\n\nThis debate is now closed. Read your comments below.\n\nYour reaction:\n\nI am very saddened by the pictures on the news of the many victims of war on all sides. Is this the price that we have to pay for peace throughout the world? Why can't we all live in harmony with each other? There is no victory in war, it only leads to more bloodshed. God bless all those families who have lost loved ones on all sides. My thoughts are with you.\n\nCharlyne Williams, England\n\nIt is a really trying time for me that he is involved in this war\n\nCM, UK\n\nAs a girlfriend of serviceman, it is never easy to deal with this war especially since we started facing casualties. Myself working as a humanitarian assistant for refugees, it is a really trying time for me that he is involved in this war. I have not heard from him since it started. Godspeed to all of the troops to come home safely and meet their loved ones soon. Eventually, hope that we all can bring a peaceful environment to people in Iraq, so that they can build a new nation.\n\nCM, UK\n\nWar is sad. The need for war is even sadder. God bless our fallen British friends and their loved ones. God bless your country as well.\n\nTerry Goins, US\n\nNever have I been so proud of the British armed forces. I had an uncle who was a British Tommy at Ypres, Flanders in 1916, another who liberated the Nazi death camps at Dachau. I served in the Royal Air Force and had two brothers who were in the Royal Navy... I now live in California USA... but what our combined forces are doing now has prevented the world from being terrorised by another madman. So I want to say thank you to all the servicemen and women. You are heroes giving the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our freedoms. May God bless you all and keep you safe!\n\nMichael Crowe, USA\n\nThere must be a better way\n\nLee Wilkinson, America\n\nI am a British subject living in the US. I spent two years in Northern Ireland and lost several friends as casualties of war. I am saddened when I read about young men and women losing their lives at such a young age. At eighteen you cannot give your life to your country because you have not at this point lived a life to give. I know there is great pride in serving ones country, a pride which no-one can ever take away from me or any of those who have been willing to sacrifice their life in the course of duty. But there must be a better way. We must remember peace will not be brought on by America or the UK alone, but by a world committed to peace together.\n\nLee Wilkinson, America\n\nGod bless the British, American and Australian troops and their families and friends at this time and god speed them the safe return home. I have nothing left for any other.\n\nMarina , SouthWest, UK\n\nIn response to several comments here regarding how 'proud' we are of our armed forces, I must say that I disagree. This war is illegal and those who participate in it for their own financial gains are acting despicably. I hope that they are tried as war criminals in the future. I would certainly support such a move, because it is time that we learned that each person is responsible for their own actions. It is not acceptable to follow corrupt men such as Bush and Blair blindly. Peace to you all.\n\nLou , UK\n\nBelieve that that your son or daughter has served well and will come home safely\n\nAndrew, London\n\nMy brother was a Royal Marine in the Falklands conflict and so many comparisons and similarities can be drawn. For example the Royal Marines went in to protect the local population and were fighting an army of fanatics and badly trained inexperienced soldiers. Also the Royal Marines lost soldiers to 'Friendly Fire' as the intelligence was all it could be. The worst thing that my family and I were worried about was \"is he that Marine who died, missing or captured\". To the families of the soldiers in the Gulf I can say: believe that that your son or daughter has served well and will come home safely and see you soon.\n\nAndrew, London England\n\nThe brave men and women have died protecting not only us in the free world but the people of Iraq. When you really think about it, it seems unbelievable that the UN that is supposed to stand up for Human Rights and Freedom could not agree on a very simple fact: freeing Iraq's people. It makes me proud of those servicemen that have died, to know that they sacrificed themselves for others. And yet all we hear is complaints from anti-war types. We are all anti-war, but I believe if it means freeing a repressed people it is worth the price. Otherwise, like the UN, we would be talking for another 10 years whilst millions more die.\n\nDele Agyemong, UK\n\nIt's sad, but I¿m sorry to say that this is what it's all about when one joins the army. Whoever joins, knows they are joining to eventually fight for their country (whether their nation agrees with them or not)and therefore the possibility of death is there. It's par of the course. At least the ones who are in the army joined by choice. How about the poor Iraqi innocents who have died, they had NO choice?\n\nRashida, London, UK\n\nOur incredible soldiers fought with honour and dignity and died with honour and dignity. I only pray the Iraqi people will salute their sacrifice by leading their new lives in the same way.\n\nSharon Stearn, England\n\nDoes the casualties' nationality matter?\n\nLB , UK\n\nDoes the casualties' nationality matter? Can a UK or US soldier end up more dead than an Iraqi one? What all have in common is that not a single one among them has initiated this war and while GWB and his devout follower Tony watch the war on TV, not lacking any comfort whatsoever, those men and women, like pawns in a game of chess, are sacrificed to satisfy the players' greater ambitions...\n\nLB , UK\n\nI salute the soldiers, the fallen, and the living. You are our only hope against a regime supported by people claiming to be our brothers. God bless you.\n\nAshraf Alanjjar, Washington DC, USA\n\nEx-Royal Navy (24 years) my heart goes out to all of the families who have lost loved ones in this terrible conflict. As a Brit living and working in the US, I am proud to know that my country and its brave servicemen and women did not flinch when it was time to end the tyranny of Saddam. Godspeed to all of the troops to come home safe and well.\n\nTony Atkinson, US (British citizen)\n\nThis war helps to remind us all of the sacrifice that British troops have given and are giving, none more so than with their lives. I am cuddling my four-year-old daughter as I write this and know that some children will never be cuddled by their dad again and some will never meet their dad. It breaks your heart.\n\nMark Smith, United Kingdom\n\nMany casualties are due to their attempt to not be heavy-handed\n\nStephan, Germany\n\nMany of the casualties suffered by the British troops are due to their attempt to connect with the people and not be heavy-handed. They have my respect for this and their families have my full sympathy. This morning I saw pictures of a very young Iraqi girl crying as she was forced out of her house at gun-point by American soldiers. I couldn't help but cry myself at the American heavy-handedness.\n\nStephan, Germany\n\nMy condolences to all families that have lost loved ones during the war with Iraq. My thoughts and prayers are with you all. For the family of Andy Wilson who died when two Royal Navy Sea King helicopters collided: I have not seen you for a long while but I have not forgotten you. My thoughts go out to you at this sad and difficult time.\n\nLove,\n\nKaryn, UK\n\nObviously war will bring casualties to the troops, but the bizarre way in which they are dying needs serious investigation. Friendly fire is very suspect. But the fact that their have been few casualties (relatively) from the enemy solidifies the point that the regime is falling day by day.\n\nMR R Hawley, UK\n\nI am awaiting news of my daughter who is a captain attached to the logistics component. Once inside Iraq, the communication from her has stopped, and I really sympathise with other families who hear nothing for weeks on end. However, whether in action or through so-called friendly fire, I know as a Christian, that death is not the end or necessarily the worst fate that can happen. My daughter went out there prepared for war. My heart goes out to those families who receive the dreaded phone call from the MOD. I believe they have died in the just cause of removing an evil dictator, and if the politicians can get it right in the aftermath, history will prove that they did not die in vain.\n\nRosemary Prudhoe, UK\n\nI felt sad when I saw the homecoming of the first British servicemen that lost their lives for a just cause. Unfortunately, the world is not a safe place and we still need to be ready to defend our values and our security. As a former officer regular army, I think it's a scandal that the French army isn't fighting side by side with our friends and allies. The British people and its armed forces could be called Europe's best. We will remember them.\n\nAndré-Louis de la Bruyère, France\n\nLet's hope it ends in peace. It is obvious that Bush and Blair are trying to be the peacemakers, but are they going the right way about it? I hope no more lives are lost; it is an expensive price to pay. Good luck.\n\nMichael Costelloe, N. Ireland\n\nI wonder whether it would be possible to at least identify the service or regiment of those who are killed or injured in the conflict? Our son is in the Royal Marines and, like many other parents, we have many anxious hours to wait until we get to know that families have been informed. This could be reduced for ourselves and others if services were identified initially. We would like to send our deepest sympathy to all those who are grieving over the death of loved ones.\n\nHelen Krarup, UK\n\nI am so proud of what the British are doing\n\nElizabeth Woolford, Australia\n\nMy father was a Royal Marine Commando and I am so proud of what the British are doing in Iraq. I pray with all my might they all return safely and that US ceases to destroy allied helpers. My thoughts to all families and friends who have lost serving members.\n\nElizabeth Woolford, Australia\n\nAlthough there are many who protest against this war, I do not think that there is any doubt that every UK citizen is proud of our armed forces and our hearts go out to their families and friends. It is however very disappointing that so many have died in \"friendly fire\". Also let us not forget the people of Iraq who are losing family and friends to this war also. As a parent my heart goes out to the children of ALL these involved in this conflict.\n\nM. Mann, UK\n\nFriendly fire is a sad possibility of war. The unbelievably courageous men and women of the UK and US armed forces know this, thus I would not distinguish how they died, only to say they did so in a noble cause. The best memorial to them would be a free and democratic Iraq; let's hope the politicians will show a fraction of their courage to make that happen.\n\nJustin Wheatley, UK\n\nWe're so thankful for the UK's support and along with our gratitude we send our most heartfelt condolences to the families of fallen heroes.\n\nGC, USA\n\nI openly wept for our heroes on their return home. My deepest sympathy goes to the family and friends of our war dead. As a former long term soldier I am behind our men and women every step of the way but I also yearn for the day when it's over and they can come home to their loved ones. God bless you all.\n\nAndy Kelly, (1991 Gulf veteran) UK\n\nAs an ex-serviceman who served in Cyprus with the UN, I would like to send deepest sympathy to the families of those who gave their lives for the people of Baghdad so that they will have the same freedom as all the free thinking people of this world. God bless all the service personnel fighting this war. They will be able to return to a more honest and less persecuted life in the near future.\n\nB F Randall, England\n\nMy heart breaks to know of the fine young men who are no longer with us. God bless them, their families, and the UK.\n\nRebecca, USA\n\nHuman compassion so great, I am brought to tears\n\nTammie, USA\n\nTo fight and die for freedom for foreigners so far from home is the act of human compassion so great, I am brought to tears. May God comfort you and hold you close. You all are in our daily prayers.\n\nTammie, USA\n\nAlthough I do not support the cause that they have been ordered to fight for, I know these men were good men and feel terrible for their families and friends.\n\nMartin Smith, UK\n\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to those of have lost someone near and dear to them in this war. My only son is a serviceman fighting in Iraq, so I can imagine what these families are going through as you tend to put yourself in their place. The phone call is the one thing you dread, my sympathies to all of you. Our British forces are a credit to their country and I am proud, not only of my son, but to all the men and women who serve for their country.\n\nHelen, England\n\nEach loss is an individual tragedy. Not just a statistic.\n\nTerry, UK\n\nWe should remember the Iraqi soldiers have family, loved ones and friends too\n\nD Niven, UK\n\nThe British soldiers who have died in this war have shown great bravery and heroic sacrifice for their country. Their selflessness is beyond measure. What we in Britain have not heard about however is how many Iraqi soldiers have also died? I imagine the number of Iraqi soldiers who have died in battle reaches a total that would shock us all.\n\nWe should remember that the Iraqi soldiers have family, loved ones and friends too.\n\nD Niven, UK\n\nEveryday I post e-mail to my brother-in-law, who last reported being \"well north of Kuwait\" There is no question of my unwavering support and admiration for his beliefs and bravery. He does not need to hear me casting doubt on the merits of this war. But I remain deeply opposed to what we are doing and it breaks my heart to see the mounting casualties on both sides in this war.\n\nClare, USA\n\nThe loss of loved ones is always traumatic, but the knowledge that the loss was in the noble cause of securing freedom for an oppressed people and making the world safer for all, may be a comfort. May the families of the lost be comforted in their time of trial and may we all stand behind the brave men and women of the US/UK military and their families in this time of testing. God protect and bless them all.\n\nBen Hall, USA\n\nMy love to them and theirs. They keep us with the right to speak our minds and without them we would not have that. Their kin should know that they die not in vain but that we rid the world of scum through them before we become scum ourselves. God rest them and strength to their kin - God bless them all.\n\nRob Canavan, England\n\nI wish I was 20 years younger so I could be with the boys\n\nHenry Stokes, Netherlands\n\nI am an ex-Royal Marine, and wish I was 20 years younger so I could be with the boys. I know we shouldn't think 'we' know best but when people need help and what some mad idiot is doing is not good for the rest of the world, then something has to be done and if it's with force, then so be it. My son is a Royal Marine and if he has to fight then that comes with the job, that's what they train for. That's enough from me or I will start to get too emotional.\n\nHenry Stokes, Netherlands\n\nAs a 19-year-old I find it difficult to imagine the realities of war and knowing that one of the deceased was my age brings the truth home. I send my condolences to the families that have suffered and show my support to the troops and their families as I write this message.\n\nR Knowles, Wales\n\nI feel really bad about the loss of the British servicemen. However they did not die for an unworthy cause. And I am happy to see the Americans and the Brits fighting side by side again. I'm sure when the smoke clears and the fighting stops, the world will see the truth and the Iraqi people will be free.\n\nBrent Chivrell, USA\n\nAs a mother and human being, seeing the dead return to the UK brought tears to my eyes but I strongly believe that this war is the right thing to do. I am angered and frustrated by the reporting of the war on UK TV, I think the US coverage is more patriotic and I think we could do with a little more of that from our own media coverage.\n\nMelanie Reynolds, UK\n\nI cried watching those lads being brought off the plane today accompanied by the Royal Marine Band. Bless them.\n\nBarry, UK\n\nMy heart goes out to their families.\n\nMario, Uruguay\n\nBring them home safely when their job is done\n\nPatty, USA\n\nThese brave men and women are forever in our prayers and hearts. To give so much, not everyone is able to do. We must all know they served and represent two grateful nations. Whenever tyrants destroy innocent people it will always be up to UK and USA to protect the rights of those unfortunate to have existed in such violent nations. God Bless our service men and women. Bring them home safely when their job is done.\n\nPatty, USA\n\nWhen the golden sun is setting, and my mind from care is free, I will always think of you.\n\nAnn, England\n\nAs I watched the arrival of the 10 British soldiers on Sky television, tears ran my eyes for such innocent souls.\n\nMaada Joe-sai Squire, Botswana\n\nMy deepest sympathies to all the thousands of dead UK, US and Iraqi soldiers who have died serving their orders.\n\nRichard Dunn, Cambridge, England\n\nWe owe them a debt than can never be repaid\n\nMarie Howard, UK\n\nThis war, more than any other, has brought home to us how brave and professional the young people in our armed services are. We owe them a debt than can never be repaid. I pray that this country and its people are worthy of their sacrifice and that of many others over the years. My heart and prayers go out to their families.\n\nMarie Howard, UK\n\nHaving been through a war many years ago (Falklands) my heart goes out to the fallen servicemen and their families. They shall not be forgotten.\n\nBrian Stratford, UK\n\nWhether for or against the war we should all respect and honour the soldiers who are out there doing their duty. They train hard and deserve our respect and prayers. Love to the families. Be proud that your loved ones have the courage to stand in the front lines when it is their duty to do so.\n\nBeverley, UK\n\nMy condolences to the families of the British servicemen whose lives where taken.\n\nVicente H Rodriguez, USA\n\nThe British are historically the bravest and best trained warriors in the world and all Americans should be proud to have Britain by our side, I know I am. Saddam has been given more than a fair chance to abide by UN restrictions and has ignored them. This is not something we ran into blindly, it was thought out and planned by the two greatest countries in the world and we will turn Iraq into a safe place to live. So family and friends, know that your loved ones did not die in vain, rather that they died fighting for what they love, freedom. God bless all our troops.\n\nGary, USA\n\nService in the British army gives you memories that last a lifetime. When I saw pictures of men in my old regiment, Household Cavalry, it was an emotional experience, I saw myself behind the gun. British troops are real men, there's something different about coming from Britain. The entire history of Britain on the field of war stands behind you. Anglo Saxons and Celts live again.\n\nAlan Byrom, Canada\n\nThank you for your sons and daughters\n\nMarilyn, New Hampshire, USA\n\nGod bless those families who have lost loved ones in this endeavour. Thank you for your sons and daughters who are joined with us. In the words of one of our past presidents:\n\n\"It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled or where the doer of the deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who know the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the worst, if he falls, at least falls while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\"\n\nThank you and God bless us all.\n\nMarilyn, New Hampshire, USA\n\nMy heart hurts, when I think of the many young men who must leave their life in Iraq. I am mother of two sons, therefore my thoughts are specially with the mothers who have lost loved ones. I'm so sorry... God bless you!\n\nSusan, Switzerland\n\nOur servicemen and women deserve more support from the press who constantly report the negatives and not the contribution that these brave people are making to the safety of Iraq, the region and our world.\n\nP Tucker, UK\n\nI am a Mexican mother, and I am grateful my son is home, and not in war. But my heart and my prayers are with the mothers and families of these brave men that gave their lives for peace on the planet. I hope there were some words I could say, but I know there are none to give comfort. But you are in my prayers. From one human being to another, all my love.\n\nGeorgina Zarate D, Mexico\n\nKnow that your loved ones died performing their duty, and revelling in the glory that their most demanding jobs elicit\n\nEx-rifleman, South Africa\n\nI served in HM armed forces. My heartfelt condolences to those left behind. Know only, that your loved ones died performing their duty, and revelling in the glory that their most demanding jobs elicit.\n\nDo not allow their memory to become pawns in this increasingly ugly political feud. Soldiers die in war. It is a possibility all are aware of, and accept upon commencement of service. Thus, neither side in this political mudslinging, should claim to represent the wishes and feelings of the soldier, as neither side is actually in Iraq, fighting, dying and killing.\n\nEx-rifleman, South Africa\n\nTime will tell what kind of nation Iraq becomes. I hope it will become a home of people who not only enjoy freedom, justice and human rights themselves, but who, like the British soldiers today, are also willing to make the ultimate sacrifice so others might have it too. When the Iraqis are free to tell the world about Saddam's 30 years of crimes, we will know that our soldiers' lives were given for a just and noble cause. I join the others here and offer my sincere condolences and respectful gratitude for the British soldiers and their families.\n\nJohn, USA\n\nMy loving thoughts and prayers to those servicemen who bravely fought. Condolences for their families. Here in Philippines, we're proud of our loved ones who suffered to bring peace to all of us. We do believe that they are going succeed to bring us peace. In spite we lost them their memories will last. They will be heroes of the new generation.\n\nDebbie, Philippines\n\nMy heart goes out to the 20 British servicemen killed in the war in Iraq. I fully support our troops but I do not support our blind rush to follow the Americans to war. We of all nations should have shown more caution and diplomacy, we should have been an example to the rest of the world as to how to balance diplomacy with military action.\n\nRichard Hurstfield, England\n\nI would like to thank the British for making these sacrifices to help us. British soldiers are amongst the best in the world and add skills to the battle that the American military isn't as good at like urban conflict. Thank you.\n\nDavid Peterson, USA\n\nI pray for the UK soldiers who lost their lives for the world peace that comes with a heavy cost. UK and USA will always be blood brothers as they have always been in the past 100 years.\n\nEllen Lin, New York, USA\n\nFriendly fire 18 Iraq 2. These statistics are numbing. It is so hard to believe that one of the best-trained countries in the world could kill more of their countrymen than the enemy. Casualties are a fact of war but to lose a loved one to \"friendly fire\" hurts even more because there is no success, no battle won. My thoughts and prayers go out to the loved ones of all these soldiers.\n\nTara Avey, Canada\n\nUnfortunately, deaths due to friendly fire will happen. In combat at night mistakes can happen. That there are so few speaks of the quality of the training and fire discipline of British troops.\n\nAndy Ross, UK\n\nI am a British ex-Royal Navy lass who happens to be living in the US now. At times like these I miss home and certainly miss the unique closeness that is second nature in all our services. I feel a deep sense of concern for our boys and girls who are in harm's way. I know our servicemen are the best and they will carry out their duties like no others. I hope those who are mourning are able to focus on fond memories and certainly have every reason to hold their hearts high with pride.\n\nJoanne Ferranto, USA\n\nI am saddened greatly by every death in this war. UK losses are more impacting, but even the deaths of Iraqi soldiers makes me sad. No matter how wrong we see the regime in Iraq (and I agree 100% with the action we are taking), the Iraqis believe in all they have ever known, enough to die for defending it. They are human beings like us, and their loss is tragic also.\n\nCraig A Clark, United Kingdom\n\nGod bless all their souls\n\nJoshua Njogolo, Dar-Es-salaam, Tanzania\n\nWe are still praying. As citizens in Tanzania, we feel much sorrow for their families, but we know that the American and British soldiers lost their lives to help the people of Iraq. God bless all their souls.\n\nJoshua Njogolo, Dar-Es-salaam, Tanzania\n\nGod bless and make British army victories in all the battles for liberation of Iraq. I am a ex-Gurkha soldier based in Hong Kong. Our thoughts and prayers are with the fellow British brothers in arms. If you need us, we will be there for you in the battlefield.\n\nDavidraj Rai, Hong Kong\n\nIf I should die think only this of me:\n\nThat there is some corner of a foreign field that is forever England,\n\nThere shall be in that rich earth a richer dust concealed,\n\nA dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,\n\nGave once her flowers to love her ways to roam,\n\nA body of England's breathing English air,\n\nWashed by rivers blest by suns of home.\n\nAnd think, this heart, all evil shed away,\n\nA pulse in eternal mind no less gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given,\n\nHer sights and sounds, dreams happy as her day,\n\nAnd laughter learnt of friends and gentleness,\n\nIn hearts at peace, under an English heaven.\n\nRupert Brooke The Soldier 1914.\n\nMay God bless all our armed forces and bring them safely home.\n\nEmma, England\n\nI have never been so grateful my baby son does not know where Daddy is\n\nLisa, UK\n\nThere is little comfort any of us can offer to the families who have lost these brave soldiers but to express our greatest sympathy and to tell them that they are in our thoughts. I have never been so grateful that my baby son does not know where his Daddy is and I pray that my husband and all the other brave soldiers come home safely.\n\nLisa, UK\n\nUnlike any other war before, the blood and gore is being shown to us, as it is actually happening. Until now, I have found the spectacle quite fascinating but because our boys are being killed, I feel the media should seriously consider restricting what is put in front of our eyes. It is becoming demoralising.\n\nAnon\n\nI feel sorry for all the families and friends of the dead soldiers. May this war be over soon as my boyfriend is out there. I am praying every day for him to come back safely. Jamie, I love you and I am thinking about you all the time.\n\nWendy, Germany\n\nMy heart breaks for all who are suffering with the injury, grief and fear this war brings.\n\nClare, London, UK\n\nWar creates many casualties, none of whom deserve to die\n\nColin McKenna, Scotland\n\nWar creates many casualties, none of whom deserve to die. Even dictators! I hope that the war ends sooner rather than later as I fear many more deaths. All deaths of the coalition forces as well as Iraqi's is a time of great sadness. Let us pray for all.\n\nColin McKenna, Scotland\n\nWe are fortunate that coalition casualties have been this light so far. A number of these fatalities could have easily occurred in training accidents even without the conflict.\n\nJim F, USA\n\nI am heartened to see that the quality and professionalism of the British forces is as high as ever. My thoughts are with the allied troops and also the Iraqi conscripts. May this conflict end as swiftly as possible for all their sakes.\n\nJohn Christian, UK\n\nThey shall not grow old as we who are left grow old.\n\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\n\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them all.\n\nRich, UK\n\nPlease send our heartfelt sympathy to the families of these brave men and women\n\nDavid, Canada\n\nPlease send our heartfelt sympathy to the families of these brave men and women. Our freedom is assured whilst there are people like this to preserve it.\n\nDavid, Canada\n\nWhilst the death of every coalition soldier is saddening and deserves the fullest respect, I cannot but wonder why nearly most of the casualties are attributable to \"friendly\" fire or just accidents.\n\nJurgen W Schulze, USA\n\nI would like to send my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the dead and injured British troops. I hope you are able to gain some comfort in the fact that you loved ones are heroes, and will always be remembered by their grateful country for helping to bring peace to the world and liberate an oppressed people. Their selflessness and courage should be an inspiration to everyone. My thoughts and prayers are with you.\n\nAdrian, British in Australia\n\nIt is irrelevant what you think of the war. The families who have lost someone should be proud of the efforts their loved ones made. It is always a tragedy when someone dies doing their job.\n\nA Legge, UK\n\nMy kid brother (who is twice as tall as me) is with Three Commando group. In Iraq we have an opportunity to change a merciless regime responsible for countless deaths. We should and are taking that opportunity. We are doing it with the best this country has. It is a very great shame that those who object to this war, have been so deathly silent over the excesses of Saddam over the last ten years. These fine soldiers wish only for our thanks, and not to be forgotten for the sacrifices they make.\n\nRichard, England\n\nThank you, Brits - we are proud to fight beside you.\n\nTheresa, USA\n\nI can't imagine how the families feel but I do know there is a huge amount of love and support from those around the world. I am only 15 and I feel so emotional about the whole thing and I will carry on supporting you al the way. Good luck.\n\nJamie-Lee, South Yorkshire, England,\n\nHeroes - giving everything to free those who have nothing.\n\nJon, Atlanta USA\n\nAs an American who enjoys reading your less slanted version of happenings, I want to say it hurts any time there are casualties of war. As a retired army staff sergeant, it hits even closer since I had the privilege of spending time with some British foot soldiers training in America. God bless the Queen and may all your soldiers return.\n\nMark, USA\n\nThe Iraqi people are in debt to your sacrifices\n\nSaad Rashid, UK\n\nAs a Briton of an Iraqi origin, I would like to express my heartfelt condolences and utmost support to the families of the brave British servicemen who lost their lives liberating a subdued nation from the ruthless dictatorship of Saddam's regime. The Iraqi people are in debt to your sacrifices and to the British Government's courageous stand. May God bless the souls of those heroes in heaven and comfort their families and beloved ones with patience.\n\nSaad Rashid, UK\n\nI support the aims of this war, and it is of course extremely sad to hear of the death or injury on any serviceman or woman. It strikes me, however, that 20 deaths after a week of conflict is an incredibly low figure - my Grandmother lost three of her four brothers in a week during World War I. Grief and sadness is for friends and relatives of those killed, but the rest of us, who have fortunately not been touched directly, must keep a sense of historical perspective.\n\nJohn, England\n\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to the families who have lost their loved ones in this war. May our Lord's peace be with you and your family.\n\nAnn, India\n\nMy condolences to the families of our British allies that have lost a loved one in the military operations in Iraq. For those with someone wounded or missing, I pray for their speedy recovery and safe return to you, along with their comrades-in-arms from all coalition nations. May that sacrifice not be in vain and lead to a safer, freer world for all people everywhere.\n\nRay Oney, USA\n\nI grieve with and for those who have lost their lives in this war. I do, however, make some distinctions. Those in the armed forces joined them voluntarily, knowing they may become involved in fighting, and perhaps die. The civilians killed do not have this choice. This does not mean that the grief and suffering of the armed forces personnel and families is less, but neither must we forget the civilians.\n\nTenzin, UK\n\nThey will be remembered for their bravery and courage in fighting for somebody else's freedom\n\nNathan and Johnnie, England\n\nOur thoughts go out to those who have lost a friend or relative in this conflict. They will be remembered for their bravery and courage in fighting for somebody else's freedom. Their sacrifices will not be in vain and we are grateful for the efforts of those who have died and those who valiantly fight on.\n\nNathan and Johnnie, England\n\nMy heart bleeds profusely for every family who may, in one way or another, might have lost a love one through this war. It is a really painful experience, even in a situation where these loved ones have their names on the web. Just accept the fact that it is a national assignment. Accept my heartfelt condolence. But I blame those selfish politicians who send them there.\n\nEdward Adarkwa, Ghana\n\nWe don't have conscription; all our soldiers are in the Gulf because they believe it is their duty. To risk your life doing what you think is right transcends all \"rational\" discussion about the merits of war. These people deserve the greatest respect and admiration. Those using the casualties to promulgate their \"I'm alright Jack\" pacifism can only be dismissed with the most profound disgust and contempt.\n\nAndrew, UK\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot expect a war without casualties, but can someone explain why the United Kingdom has to pay such a proportionally high price in \"friendly fires\"?\n\nHerve Noel, French in Singapore\n\nI cry daily, and mourn each death equally, our brave allied soldiers fighting by choice, and the Iraqis, fighting because they have none. To all my friends, please come home soon. To all the families of lost children, they will never be forgotten, and may God comfort you in your time of grief. My heart breaks for all affected.\n\nLeolani, USA\n\nEvery lost life is tragic from whatever cause\n\nMargaret Jones, Australia\n\nMy heart goes out to families who have lost loved ones. The conditions the forces are fighting in are terrible. Every lost life is tragic from whatever cause. To the families of soldiers who died; many decent people pray for you and grieve with you. To the families of injured soldiers; we also pray for you and for your loved ones safe return. Every soldier is brave!\n\nMargaret Jones, Australia\n\nThey gave their lives for democracy. A good cause often has a high price.\n\nJens, Sweden\n\nWhy are we wasting our soldiers lives and taxpayers' money on these people that, despite being oppressed and victimised by a tyrant, are clearly so brainwashed with anti-Western sentiment that the bulk clearly do not want 'saving'? Leave them to it and save our troops and money!\n\nMark Dowle, UK\n\nTo the friends and families of the British and American troops, our thoughts and prayers are with you.\n\nDave, Newcastle, England.\n\nTo the families of the fallen soldiers of the British troops; our thoughts and prayers are with you.\n\nDavid Terry, USA\n\nThe British soldiers who have died have worn their uniforms with pride, knowing that they are fighting for truth and freedom. A true nation fights while wearing its uniform. A nation run by sadistic liars lets its spineless troops wear civilian clothes while watching the local population starve. These British men have died knowing they are the best.\n\nPaul Hollinsworth, UK\n\nI was about to launch into a passionate defence of our involvement in this war, when I read the comments already posted by Paul Hollinsworth. I was moved to tears.\n\nTony Davy, UK\n\nI have great respect for those brave men and women who have been sent to Iraq by Bush and Blair. They shouldn't be there and I want them all to return safely.\n\nEdward Martin, Northern Ireland\n\nIt is too late to say whether this war is right or wrong. We ALL must back our soldiers and let them know they are in our thoughts. It is their sacrifices that give us our freedom.\n\nRaiyo, UK\n\nIt is a shame that young lives are lost in battle. May God give their families the strength to bear this loss and may the brave live forever in our memories.\n\nParitosh Desai, UK\n\nThe soldiers are brave honest individuals who have been sent into battle by cowardly lying politicians. The daily deceptions broadcast by Bush, Blair and their cronies are shameful when compared to the selflessness of the armed forces.\n\nAllen Ward, UK\n\nThe greatest sacrifice anyone can make is to lay down their life for a stranger\n\nFred Powell, UK\n\nMy heart goes out to the relatives of those who have lost their lives in Iraq. It is one thing to die defending your own country but this war goes beyond that. These people died for the people of Iraq. Trying to remove a corrupt and vicious regime from power and give Iraq back to the Iraqi people. The greatest sacrifice anyone can make is to lay down their life for a stranger. Those who died have made that sacrifice.\n\nFred Powell, UK\n\nI am saddened by the loss of your countrymen. It is my hope that they have not died in vain and that their sacrifice will result in a free Iraq. Freedom is worth fighting for. Even when you are in the minority.\n\nTom Harrington, USA\n\nMy thoughts for the 20 British deaths are desperate sadness and increasing despair - exactly the same as my thoughts for the 683 Iraqis killed, of which 183 were civilians, and the 1,246 Iraqi civilians injured.\n\nJohn, Belgium\n\nI would just like to say how brave those men were and I wish my boyfriend to come home safely as he is out there too, and how deeply sorry I am for the families of those that died.\n\nBecky, UK\n\nI wanted to say thank you to the British forces in Iraq for their courage and bravery. We thank God for them and for fighting this war with us. God bless you!\n\nJoanne, USA\n\nI am fervently anti-war but still incredibly saddened by the deaths of British soldiers. I, like virtually all who are antiwar, bear no malice towards the troops themselves - they have to follow orders. I blame only Bush, his hawkish administration and Blair for this immoral and illegal invasion.\n\nAndrew, Birmingham UK\n\nI didn't agree with the war when it began, but now I'm fully behind the troops, and I hope they will return safely, and that there be no more casualties or deaths.\n\nLiadan, UK\n\nI would like to use this opportunity to express my sorrow and condolences to the families of the fallen. Especially to the wife and child of Sergeant Roberts, as I am an ex-member of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment. Words are hard to find.\n\nPaul Hewitt, UK\n\nTo any bereaved family or loved one that may read this; Take heart from knowing that they gave their lives for a just and honourable cause, with the very best of intentions. Future generations will thank them for their sacrifice. We will remember them.\n\nPaul O'Hagan, London, England\n\nSoldiers of the US and the UK died with honour\n\nGina, US\n\nMy condolences to the families of the RAF soldiers who fought so bravely alongside our US troops in this confusing conflict. We are grateful to Britain's strong loyalty to the US in this war. They were fighting for a cause far greater than each one of us. They fought for freedom which the Iraqi population had been deprived by a vicious dictator. I hope you can be comforted by the fact that soldiers of the US and the UK fought bravely and did not die in vain. They died with honour.\n\nGina, US\n\nMy godson is a Royal Marine serving in Iraq. I just read the report on life with the Marines by your reporter - I hope and pray he comes back safely to his mum, dad and sisters and I smile when I remember him as a baby and toddler and all the high jinks he used to get up to with my daughter when they were little. I still haven't come to the conclusion whether I believe in this war. The whole situation to me is so sad - there are mums and sisters of Iraq's soldiers remembering and feeling exactly like we do. God bless us all.\n\nLynne Wheeler, England.\n\nAs a serving member of the military, whose brothers also serve, I truly feel the sadness of your loss.\n\nFlt Lt Johntson, UK\n\nI hope and pray that this time, and may it be soon, we see the end of Saddam Hussein's reign of terror over innocent human beings. I know it is very tragic for the families who have lost their loved ones, I only hope they did not die in vain, and that this murderous, vile person is brought finally to justice! However that may be.\n\nSusan Penn, England\n\nIt's sad to hear about the deaths and casualties of both Iraqi and British troops. However, one thing I do find appalling is the high number of deaths caused by 'friendly fires'. Those responsible (if they are not dead already) must be punished severely.\n\nJennifer, UK\n\nI am so proud to have allies like you\n\nRita Pinkiewicz, USA\n\nMy deepest sympathy goes to the families of these boys; I am so proud to have allies like you. Even with all these protests going round the world no-one is thinking of these military men doing their job. Being American I am so ashamed of these protesters just thinking of themselves and getting news media. The news media should for one day not televise them as they protest - instead have a day of prayer for all the military UK, American and whoever else is over there fighting. Thank you.\n\nRita Pinkiewicz, USA\n\nThe servicemen and women of the armed forces are some of the finest and bravest in the world. Like their forefathers they are marching into battle in defence of their monarch, country and even of liberty itself. They are added into the pantheon of British heroes. God save the Queen.\n\nBen Rodkin, USA/UK\n\nI feel for anyone who has had loved ones die in this war and I have the greatest respect for any man or woman prepared put their life on the line for this country. Saying this, I still believe this war is wrong. How many people's lives on both sides is our so called national security worth?\n\nGavin Whelan, Ireland/England\n\nThank you for your willingness to stand up and be counted in this war. I am proud and honoured to be a friend of GB. God bless the families of those lost in the war. Our prayers are for the continued safety of everyone in this effort to bring down the heathens in Iraq.\n\nRay Wilson, USA\n\nMy heart goes out to all the servicemen's families who have lost their men in the war. I believe the casualties of the civilians has been low due to the experience of the soldiers and pilots who have been involved during the fighting, all fatalities and casualties are horrendous but any soldier knows that this could happen to them. My thoughts are with them all.\n\nKrissy, Herne Bay, Kent, UK\n\nI would just like to reiterate what all here have said - I feel immense pride in our forces, and deeply sorry for all those families affected by loss of a loved one.\n\nCaroline Reeves, UK\n\nIt is a true display of courage and strength\n\nPaul Beresford, British Guyana / USA\n\nIt is indeed sad to see the loss of life from \"friendly fire\" accidents in this conflict. I would like to express my condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones in this war. Know that whatever your personal feelings are about this conflict your sons died or were wounded doing a job that many of us are incapable of doing. It is a true display of courage and strength. May God bless and keep you all.\n\nPaul Beresford, British Guyana / USA\n\nIt is very sad to hear of servicemen being killed. It must be so difficult for their families and for their fellow servicemen. Those who survive deserve our support and the knowledge that we are behind them 100%.\n\nLaura , Wiltshire, UK\n\nI don't support the war but I do feel sorry for those poor lads. Would Bush or Blair's family be allowed to take part in the war?\n\nDamien, Ireland\n\nI only hope that the conflict ends soon so that the loss of life on both sides can also cease.\n\nMax, England\n\nI have seen it reported that in the last Gulf war 24 British troops died, of which 15 were killed by friendly fire. Whilst I have every sympathy with the troops the simple facts are that they should not be in this position.\n\nChris Bell, England\n\nThey gave their lives for our tomorrow. They are the best of our nation and we should never forget them.\n\nPaul Taylor, England\n\nGod bless them all for their bravery and courage and God bless their families too\n\nKaren, England\n\nMy heart goes out to every family who has a loved one serving in the Gulf. I can only imagine the terror and pressure that these families are under. I do not know any servicemen or women in the gulf, yet I find myself completely choked and filling up every time I hear of a casualty. I only hope that our troops will come home safe and very soon. God bless them all for their bravery and courage and God bless their families too for their bravery, courage and strength.\n\nKaren, England\n\nI would like to say thank you to all the servicemen and their families as their loss will lead to a better future for millions of people. I will always remember their sacrifice.\n\nJon, UK\n\nMy heart goes out to the friends and family of everyone killed or wounded in this war - whether British, American, Iraqi or of any other nationality.\n\nClare, UK\n\nFind comfort in the knowledge they died to end a regime that for generations has caused pain\n\nEx-forces, UK\n\nI hope all the families of these brave people can overcome the pain that comes with the loss of a loved one and find some comfort in the knowledge that they died to end a regime that for generations has caused pain for countless innocent people.\n\nEx-forces, UK\n\nTo all involved, come home safe. Thoughts are with those families who have lost loved ones.\n\nNicky, England\n\nI am for war. We need to overthrow Saddam to free the Iraqi people, and if I was old enough I would like to fight in the war and try to make a difference but I am only 12.\n\nMatthew Biggs, England\n\nAny loss of service personnel is tragic, the more so for their dedication to their role in circumstances that most of us cannot imagine. I hope for all the sense of grief and loss bereaved families are experiencing, that you also feel proud of your loved ones and know the thoughts of the entire nation are with you.\n\nA family in Oxfordshire, UK\n\nAll will have believed in what they were fighting for\n\nElizabeth Ellis, England\n\nNone of my family are in any of the forces. I can't even begin to imagine how any of these boys' families must be feeling. I know that they were all part of a professional fighting force, and the best trained army in the world. All will have believed in what they were fighting for.\n\nElizabeth Ellis, England\n\nI'm behind you troops all the way!\n\nArone Thasan, England\n\nI have a friend in the army, not sure if he's been sent out yet.
