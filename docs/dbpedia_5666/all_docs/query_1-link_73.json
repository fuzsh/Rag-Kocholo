        "text": "This comprises four panels within a frame, all in oak and richly decorated with the Naval crown, carved laurel decorations and a scroll with the carved motto \"Sans peur et sans reproche\" ('Without fear and without reproach'). This Roll, together with the five Silver Memorial Side Drums and a wooden bass drum, comprise the official War Memorial to the Warrant Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and men of the Royal Marine Bands, who were trained at the Royal Naval School of Music, and lost their lives during the First World War. The cost was borne by every member of the Royal Naval School of Music, each of whom donated a day's pay.\n\nThis Roll of Honour was purchased during 1919 and was originally hung in the Concert Hall at Eastney, above the Silver Memorial Drums. It was subsequently transferred each time the School was relocated until, in 2012, it was hung in the new Memorial Room at the Royal Marines School of Music in HMS Nelson, Portsmouth. The Silver Memorial Drums and the wooden bass drum are held, under appropriate conditions, at the Royal Marines Museum.\n\nJohn Ambler, Royal Marines Band Service Historian, March 2014"
