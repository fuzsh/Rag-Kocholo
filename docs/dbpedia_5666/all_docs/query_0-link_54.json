        "text": "As one of the five bands that make up the musical wing of the Royal Navy, RM Band Scotland plays a crucial role in boosting troop morale, supporting international diplomacy and paying tribute to their fallen comrades.\n\nThe master musicians of RM Band Scotland are highly skilled in at least two instruments – and often many more. Together, these versatile and talented musicians undertake a wide variety of ceremonial commitments across Scotland and the North of England.\n\nJust some of the band’s recent engagements include the launch of the new Daring-class destroyers and the commissioning of the submarine HMS Astute.\n\nAs with all Royal Marines Bands, the men and women of RM Band Scotland also perform a vital secondary role supporting the Fleet during active operations, with a number of personnel having seen service in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nRoger has been playing at the highest level with brass bands for over three decades. As a principal player, he has spent 10 years with Black Dyke, 7 with CWS Glasgow, 4 with Grimethorpe and a short spell at Brighouse & Rastrick. Alongside these commitments, Roger has been active as a soloist, visiting over 25 Countries and performing in many of the World’s most prestigious concert halls. For many years, as well as playing in our top brass bands, Roger worked with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra performing and recording some of the great orchestral repertoire.\n\nHis work as a pedagogue is well known, with many of his students past and present making their own mark on the music world. As a psychologist, as well as a musician, Roger helps musicians with areas of social phobia, and in particular performance anxiety – helping each student to achieve their potential and enabling them to deliver their best at all times.\n\nHis latest CD ‘My Heroes’, was recorded at the Guards Chapel adjacent to Buckingham Palace, with the Guards Brass Band for the Help for Heroes charity. Roger continues to work as a soloist and teacher worldwide on trumpet and Cornet. Roger continues to work as a soloist and teacher, giving concerts worldwide on trumpet and Cornet.\n\nCaptain Ann Miller RM was brought up in Insch, Aberdeenshire and joined the Royal Marines Band Service in 1997 following a strong interest in music and military bands from a young age. With flute and saxophone as her instrumental category, during her training at the Royal Marines School of Music she won the Cassel Prize Silver Medal on flute and joined the Band of HM Royal Marines Portsmouth (Royal Band) for her first draft in September 2000. A hugely enjoyable start to her career, Ann particularly enjoyed travelling and performing in different countries including Malta, Gibraltar, America, Australia, Iceland and Italy. In 2003 she was deployed with the band onboard RFA Argus during OP TELIC where working with the medical staff within the hospital was a fulfilling and positive experience she will never forget. Ann has always relished the opportunity to play her flute and one of the main highlights of her career came in 2007 when she performed a solo at the Mountbatten Festival of Music.\n\nFollowing a year as the flute and saxophone instructor at the RMSoM, Ann undertook further musical and military training then embarked on her Bandmasters Course in 2009. Taking on the role of HMS Neptune Volunteer Band Instructor succeeding the BM’s meant a move to Scotland where after a year she then moved across the country to RM Band Scotland. High points during her time here included performing in the Ceilidh Band for the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and traveling once again, to America. Ann then went on to serve in RM Band Collingwood, was the Academic Instructor in the Higher Training Department at the RMSoM and a member of RM Band Service Headquarters before joining RM Band Portsmouth, as Bandmaster, in Summer 2018. After a hugely rewarding year in Portsmouth, she then moved to the West country with her family to become the Bandmaster of RM Band Plymouth. Having the opportunity to conduct, and work alongside the band is a real privilege for Ann and one she relished as a Bandmaster in both Bands. 2020 saw a move to the Higher Training department as Chief Instructor, where she enjoyed instructing and working with the music students who were embarking on their promotional music courses.\n\nGaining experience as a Bandmaster prompted Ann’s decision to become an Officer. Commissioned to Lt RM in January 2021 she completed her SCCO course at CTCRM and worked briefly at the RMSoM before attending the Royal Northern College of Music for two years studying for an MMus in conducting.\n\nReturning to Scotland, this time as Director of Music of RM Band Scotland has been a real privilege for Ann and an experience that she is fully embracing. Married to Fred, a former RMBS flautist and tremendously supportive husband, and with two young daughters, Ann enjoys outdoor swimming, books and spending time with her family exploring the iconic Scottish landscape.\n\nMark Heron is a Scottish conductor known for dynamic and well-rehearsed performances across an unusually wide range of repertoire, and his expertise as an orchestral trainer.\n\nAs guest conductor he has appeared with the BBC Philharmonic, BBC Concert Orchestra, Philharmonia, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Manchester Camerata, Psappha, Meininger Hofkapelle, Orquesta Sinfónica de la Región de Murcia, Pori Sinfonietta, St Petersburg Festival Orchestra and many more.

He has collaborated with leading composers such as Kalevi Aho, George Benjamin, Sir Harrison Birtwistle, Unsuk Chin, Tansy Davies, Detlev Glanert, Heiner Goebbels, Anders Hillborg, Giya Kancheli, Magnus Lindberg, Sir James McMillan, Colin Matthews, Christopher Rouse, Kaija Saariaho, Mark Anthony Turnage and Errollyn Wallen. In 2018 he gave the the world premiere of Adam Gorb’s opera The Path to Heaven, and in 2006 the European premiere of American composer Daron Hagen’s opera, Bandanna. He has recorded dozens of CDs with the RNCM Wind Orchestra featuring contemporary wind repertoire on labels such as Chandos, Naxos, NMC, ASC and Polyphonic.\n\nMark studied at the RSAMD and the RNCM. Following a successful chamber music career and freelance work with many of the UK’s professional symphony orchestras, he undertook conducting studies at the RNCM and in master classes with Neeme & Paavo Järvi, Jorma Panula, and Sir Mark Elder. He worked with Sir Colin Davis and the London Symphony Orchestra on their mentoring programme for young conductors.\n\nAlongside his conducting engagements, Mark is increasingly recognised as one of the world’s foremost conducting teachers, and students of his have achieved notable success. As well as his work across all of the RNCM’s renowned conducting programmes, he developed an elite undergraduate conducting programme at the University of Manchester, is a visiting professor to the Royal Air Force and appears often as a guest at conducting courses and master classes all over the world."
