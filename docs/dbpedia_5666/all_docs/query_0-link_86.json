        "text": "The Florida A&M University (FAMU) Board of Trustees (BOT) approved the 12-month contract of Interim President Timothy L. Beard, Ph.D.\n\nBeard, who served as president of Pasco-Hernando State College (PHSC) from 2015 until his retirement earlier this year, will begin his tenure on August 5. He succeeds President Larry Robinson, Ph.D., who served nearly seven years prior to stepping down. Beard will serve until the next university president is selected. Beard, a FAMU alumnus, addressed the BOT before the unanimous vote.\n\n“Thank you for this opportunity. I am a servant leader and want to make a difference. There are three things I want our students to keep in mind, and that is to learn, earn, and return, which is giving back. We owe a great debt to this institution for what she (FAMU) has done,” said Beard in a statement following the Special BOT meeting.\n\nBeard earned undergraduate degrees from FAMU and Florida State University (FSU) and a doctoral degree from FSU in 1998 in Rehabilitation Counseling with a focus on Higher Education Administration. Two of his daughters and a son-in-law are FAMU alumni.\n\nDuring his 14 years working at FAMU, Beard served as a faculty member, as well as a staff manager. He was an assistant professor in the School of Allied Health Sciences (SOAHS), and SOAHS director of Student Affairs. He also held several roles in the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, including director of Graduate Student Services, director of Instructional Research, and director of Career Services. He also served as an assistant director of the FAMU Career Center.\n\nBOT Chair Kristin Harper hailed Beard’s return to his alma mater. “Welcome back to The ‘Hill.’ We look forward to working together as we continue to Boldly Strike for student success.”"
