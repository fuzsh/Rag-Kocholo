        "text": "A Regiment of Marines consisting of 1,200 land soldiers was raised on 28 October 1664 as the Lord Admiral's Maritime Regiment, to be distributed into HM Fleets prepared for sea service. It ranked as the 3rd Foot and was drafted into the Coldstream Guards. Several Maritime Regiments were raised and disbanded over the years, but between 1755 and 1802, fifty Marine companies were permanently established, and in 1802 became known as the Royal Marines.\n\nIn 1855, His Majesty's Marine Forces were renamed Royal Marines Light Infantry (RMLI) and the name was slightly altered to Royal Marine Light Infantry in 1862. It fought as part of the Royal Naval Brigades during the Great War.\n\nThe Badge of the Royal Marines dates from 1827 when it being found impossible to find room for the innumerable battles on land and sea in which the Corps had participated King George IV combined them all together by bestowing on it The Great Globe itself. At the same time the one Battle Honour Gibraltar was added in commemoration of the capture and defence of the Rock in 1704–1705. The Royal Crest (Lion and Crown) was bestowed in 1802 on account of their steadfast loyalty in the Great Mutinies of 1797. The Laurel Wreath encircling the Globe was gained at the taking of Belleisle in 1761. The Anchor below the globe was granted when the Marine Corps was formed in 1755 as denoting its exclusively belonging to the Admiralty.\n\nOn 27 October 1798, during the occupation of the Maltese Islands by troops of Revolutionary France, Capt Creswell and a number of marines landed in Gozo. The French surrendered to Capt Alexander Ball RN on 28 October.\n\nThe Royal Marines in Malta were part of 3 Commando Bde whose HQ was at St George's Barracks, St George's Bay. In 1947, three Commando Units, 40, 42, and 45 Commando RM, moved from Singapore and Hong Kong to Malta, to form part of Britain's Strategic Reserve in the Near and Middle East. At Malta the Bde practiced its amphibious skills. During the Second World War, the Marines manned the Bofors Anti-Aircraft guns at Fort St Angelo (HMS Egmont).\n\nOn 29 November 1952, The Duke of Edinburgh presented 40 Commando RM, 42 Commando RM, and 45 Commando RM, the units of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines, with their own Colours in recognition of their service during the war.\n\nIn May 1953, the Brigade was ordered to the Suez Canal Zone. When the Anglo-Egyptian Suez agreement was signed in August 1954, the brigade was ordered back to Malta. In autumn 1954 it was decided to send 42 Cdo RM back to England to reduce the ratio of overseas to Home Service in the Royal Marines as a whole. The other two commandos trained in North Africa and in the Mediterranean based on Malta.\n\nOn 4 July 1958, a memorial chapel to those killed on deployment was erected at St Paul's Cathedral Valletta. The final task called of the Royal Marines was the covering of the withdrawal of the British Forces from Malta between 1977 to 1979.\n\nThe Royal Marine Artillery\n\n1905 Royal Marine Artillery\n\nat the Naval Cemetery (Capuccini) in 1905:\n\nGnr George Laishley RMA of HMS Formidable, aged 29 years.\n\nThe Royal Marine Light Infantry\n\n1905 Royal Marine Light Infantry\n\nat the Naval Cemetery (Capuccini) in 1905:\n\nPte Henry Davis RMLI of HMS Egmont, aged 28 years.\n\n1913 Royal Marine Light Infantry\n\nin 1913:\n\nVera May Hobbs born on 4 August 1913, daughter of Eva and Sgt Ernest Hobbs, of No 20, Vilhena Apartments, Floriana.\n\n1914 Royal Marine Light Infantry\n\n1915 Royal Marine Light Infantry\n\n1915 – Royal Marine Light Infantry\n\nin Pietà Military Cemetery in 1915:\n\nPte McDonald T Chatham Bn Royal Marine Light Infantry.\n\nPte Cooper T P aged 34 yrs, Royal Naval Division 3rd Field Ambulance.\n\nPte Titterton A aged 33 yrs, Portsmouth Bn RMLI.\n\nPte Baseley W aged 27 yrs, Portsmouth Bn RMLI.\n\n1916 Royal Marine Light Infantry\n\nat the Naval Cemetery (Capuccini) in 1916:\n\nLt T E L Marsh RM of HMS Russell, aged 19 years.\n\n1917 Royal Marine Light Infantry\n\nin 1917:\n\nArthur Cyril Fletcher born on 4 March 1917, son of QMS Arthur Frederick Fletcher RMLI and Ethel Mary resident at Ghajn Tuffieha was baptised at Ghajn Tuffieha Convalescent Camp.\n\n1918 Royal Marine Light Infantry\n\n1919 Royal Marine Light Infantry\n\n1920 Royal Marine Light Infantry\n\nin 1920:\n\nEdith Grace Walker born on 11 September 1920, daughter of Cpl Alfred George Walker RMLI and Edith May, resident at No 251, Strada Due Porte, Senglea, was baptised in the Barracca Church, Valletta.\n\n40 Commando Royal Marines\n\nIn 1940, a detachment of Royal Marines, under the command of Maj Franklin F.

On 17 June he informed the British Government that he no longer accepted the ten year 1964 Defence and Financial agreement.\n\nIn July 1971, at the request of the Government of Malta the British Government suspended the planned change over between 41 Commando Group and the 1st/Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, pending discussions between the two governments.\n\nAn advance party of 91 marines and 120 wives and children had arrived at the end of June. They were to be followed by the main body of 900 men on HMS Bulwark in mid July.\n\nAn agreement was reached whereby Malta was to receive from the UK £5.25 million a year in rent, and £4.25 million from NATO. However, in December 1971, Mintoff increased his demand for an extra £9.5 million, together with restrictions on the use of the base by other NATO powers and set a dead line of 31 December 1971 for the withdrawal of British Troops.\n\nOn 29 December 1971, Britain responded to Mintoff's ultimatum by announcing the withdrawal of 3,500 troops and 7,000 dependants from Malta.
