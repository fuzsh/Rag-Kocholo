        "text": "NCUA Approves Expansion of “Qualified Charity” to Veterans Organizations Earlier this year, Defense Credit Union Council (DCUC) and NAFCU (National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions) sent a joint letter to the NCUA Board. In the letter, we asked the NCUA to amend the definition of a “qualified charity” as it relates to Charitable Donation Accounts (CDAs) in Part 721.3 of NCUA regulations to include 501(c)(19) veterans’ organizations. Today, our efforts were a great success! The NCUA's decision to grant this revision will not only lessen previous restrictions defense credit unions faced when contributing to veterans' organizations but will also provide all credit unions with more opportunity to better serve their veteran members and communities! DCUC will continue working with each of our member credit unions alongside other veteran service organizations when advocating for the financial prosperity of our Nation's veterans. Lastly, DCUC would like to thank NAFCU for their help in drafting several joint letters, and for their consistent advocacy efforts, along with Abound Credit Union, TruStage, the National Credit Union Foundation (NCUF), and the Credit Union National Association (CUNA). We also want to thank the NCUA Board and staff for making this possible. #veterans #veterancommunity #veteranssupportingveterans #militarycommunity #military\n\n“Our fear is overcome by our conscience and our beliefs and forces us to act.\" - John McCain My son Rex is one of the youngest participating in this year’s New York City SEAL Swim to raise money for The Navy SEAL Foundation which provides critical support for the warriors, veterans, and families of Naval Special Warfare. This event consists of a mile run at the start, a total of 3.5 miles of swimming broken up by 3 stations where they complete 100 honor pushups and 22 pull ups, and a final mile run at the end to the World Trade Center. Please consider helping him in his journey. https://lnkd.in/egt6Wibm “Sworn to protect us from America’s foes. They operate under cover of darkness, against unimaginable odds. Not for status. Not for glory. But to defend our way of life. With strength, courage, and honor.” Funds raised will help provide critical, evidence-based programs for SEALs and their families - programs designed to build strength and resilience, encourage optimal health, enhance opportunities for growth through education, and solidify a sense of community and belonging. - $500 could fund travel for a wounded SEAL or Special Warfare Combat Crewmen (SWCC) in need of specialized care for their return to duty - $250 could provide graduate-level test prep assistance for a transitioning SEAL or SWCC - $150 could fund one session of grief counseling for a Gold Star family member - $100 could pay for a physical rehabilitation session for a SEAL or SWCC - $50 could cover two hours of Respite Child Care for one family of a deployed service member - $25 could provide one meal for a Command Memorial - $10 could fund 1 water bottle for an NSW kid at Summer Camp #SEALswim #NSF #NSFTeammates #NavySEALFoundation #NYCSEALSwim\n\nA Driving Force for SSAFA 2024 - Like the brave men and women of the Armed Forces, we never stop trying to serve the needs of our society… The nation is coming to terms with the unseen impact of sending 150,000 military personnel to conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of those, 636 people sadly made the ultimate sacrifice. Regrettably, tens of thousands more were left with unseen injuries both mentally and physically, which they carry with them each-and-every day. We can probably never relieve them of the burden, but we can certainly help, bringing to bear our passion, enthusiasm and drive as ex-members of the Armed Forces. A Driving Force for SSAFA, born out of the legendary Rally for Heroes, is a biennial charity event, raising funds for SSAFA the Armed Forces charity . It involves one hundred people, in fifty vehicles, including participants and support vehicles, on an exhilarating 10-day driving adventure across France, Spain and Gibraltar from 30 July to 8 August 2024, hoping to raise £120,000 for SSAFA. We also make for a superb spectacle as we travel through the UK and Europe. For 11 years, we have been fundraising through charity driving events, which have taken place across the UK and mainland Europe raising over three quarters of a million pounds for many charities supporting military personnel. The 2022 event managed to raise a staggering £173,000. We have pledged to raise a further £120,000 to support military personnel and their families in partnership with SSAFA through the 2024 event. Since 1885, SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity has shown commitment to ensuring that our service men and women, veterans and their families get the best possible support when they need it. As you know, when anyone in in the Forces family finds themselves in need, SSAFA is the charity they can turn to. Whether it’s financial, practical, or emotional, it provides the right kind of support, ensuring independence and dignity is always protected. We have partnered with SSAFA over the last 10 years. Why? Well, we think that, quite simply, they are the best at what they do in looking after our Veterans and their families. Partnerships such as ours through A Driving Force for SSAFA, are fundamental in helping them help the Armed Forces. We are always seeking new ways to help us, as a society, sustain efforts in supporting UK Service Personnel through the lengthy process of recovery and beyond.

Yet our special operations service members aren’t the only ones who make a large personal sacrifice via their service. Many non-special operations veterans have suffered greatly as well. They also deserve to be recognized for their service, and supported when they need help. Yet the vast majority of non-profit capital and services to support veterans goes to a minority of our special operations divisions. My friend Pat Gault makes this argument clearly and respectfully in this piece he wrote, which you can find on Fortune. As a special ops veteran himself, and a highly respected voice in the veteran community, his message carries a lot of weight. And it’s one of the reasons why I’m proud to serve on the board of Heroic Hearts Project — because we provide care to veterans regardless of rank or division. It was through Heroic Hearts where Pat and I first met. For those interested in supporting our veterans, please take 10 minutes to give this a read.\" Discover our mission, donate to our research, sponsor a veteran(s), or become a volunteer/ambassador for The Heroic Hearts Project, a non-profit connecting struggling veterans to ayahuasca and other psychedelic therapy options in countries where they are legal to heal their mental traumas from war. #mentalhealth, #veterans #specialforces #specialoperations #ptsdrecovery, #suicideprevention #plantmedicine #psychedelicassistedtherapy #indigenoushealingtraditions #sacredmedicine #ayahuasca #ketamineassistedtherapy #psilocybin #ibogaine #neuroplasticity #neurogenesis #heroicheartsproject #heroicheartsuk https://lnkd.in/ghmJf_dk\n\nThe National Auto Body Council (#NABC) recently revealed the establishment of the Changing and Saving Lives Foundation, a 501(c)3 organization to support community involvement and fundraising events. The foundation's primary focus is to assist families in need, military members, veterans, and first responders through various programs, including #NABC Recycled Rides, NABC First Responder Emergency Extrication (F.R.E.E.), and NABC Community Impact initiatives. In the year 2023 alone, the NABC, through these programs, distributed over 200 vehicles to families, veterans, and military members in need of reliable transportation. More than 1,500 first responders received life-saving education on vehicle rescue techniques. With the increasing demand for NABC programs, there is a growing need for resources to manage and expand these initiatives. The Changing and Saving Lives Foundation enables the NABC to actively pursue grants, gifts, and donations actively, providing the necessary means to enhance and broaden their programs. This strategic move will allow the organization to meet the rising demand and make a more substantial impact on communities where NABC members reside and work. #NABCFoundation #CommunityImpact #ChangingLives #AutobodyNews\n\nImproving the Lives of Our US Military, Veterans & Their Families Have you ever thought about making a difference in the lives of those who have served our country?
