SIGNED AS A DELEGATE TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. "Dr. Franklin presents his Respects to the Vice-Presidt, and sends an enclosed Petition (not present), requesting to be informed "what Advice to give the poor Man." Below is a brief postscript: "And desire to know how Mr. Biddle does." Biddle served as Vice-President from 10 October 1785 to 31 October 1787. Franklin, at this date, had been elected as one of Pennsylvania's representatives to the Constitutional Congress, which officially opened on May 25, some two weeks after this note. Franklin was the eldest delegate to the Convention at age 82. "The well-educated Franklin was firmly enshrined in the role of sage," Bernstein notes, but was "visibly old and enfeebled" (Are We to be a Nation?, p.152.)
