Clement's brother Charles Biddle 1745-1821, was a ship captain during the Revolutionary war before starting a successful career in Pennsylvania politics, serving, in 1785 as Benjamin Franklin's Vice President during his Presidential tenure. Franklin also appointed him as acting Chief Executive of the State of Pennsylvnia. In 1787 he was elected to the Pennsylvania Legislature but was unable to assume the position, having already been appointed as Clerk to the Supreme Executive Council. In 1791 he was commissioned Prothonotary of the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia, which he maintained until 1809 when he was elected to the State Senate of Pennsylvania, serving several terms. He was also one of the original members of the Society of Cincinnati, serving as its treasurer in 1811.

Biddle by informing me whether the lands mentioned in your letter are the same that were sold to Mr. Brown, and if not every information that you can give respecting them will be thankfully received".
