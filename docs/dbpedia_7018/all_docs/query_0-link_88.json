        "text": "Indian Echo Caverns is a cave system that has had many names throughout the years. Though no one knows what the Susquehannock tribe called the cave, we do know that the cave has been referred to since as Wilson Cave, Hummelstown Cave, Stoverdale Cave, Giant’s Cave, and Indian Cave before being renamed Indian Echo Caverns in 1929, when it was opened to the public. With its many names come many legends, which have been passed down through the years and have become a part of Pennsylvanian folklore.\n\nThe Susquehannock Indians most likely used the cave for shelter when the weather was harsh, but they disappeared from the area in the late 1600s. Though there is no particular story that I could find about the tribe’s ties to the cave, several modern eye witnesses in the cavern have reported seeing a vision of a Native American warrior holding a human head.\n\nMy favorite story I found while researching the cave is the story of “The Pennsylvania Hermit,” William “Amos” Wilson, and his sister Elizabeth. The siblings moved away from home at sixteen to separate counties across the state. William became a stone carver in West Pennsylvania, and Elizabeth went east to Philadelphia to work at The Indian Queen Tavern. William and Elizabeth were very close, having endured rural life, the death of their mother, and their scornful stepmother together. They wrote each other often and stayed in touch even though they were separated by distance.\n\nElizabeth’s life was in turmoil during these years. She had two children with different men, who each abandoned her before their offspring’s birth. She was asked to leave her employment at The Indian Queen Tavern because of her second pregnancy, and she found herself in a financial ruin. In October of 1784, she went missing. Her children were soon found dead, their bodies hidden in the woods near her home. She was arrested, found guilty of murdering both of her children, and sentenced to hang on December 7th, 1785.\n\nWilliam left work after hearing the news of his sister’s arrest, and arrived at the jail four days before her execution was to take place. Elizabeth told William what had happened. She was supposed to meet a suitor at Newport Square, a man she had been seeing who had helped her financially when she had no job. She went out to meet him and brought her children with her. He came upon her unexpectedly in the woods, killed the children, hid them in the woods, and forced her to run away with him, swearing her to secrecy.\n\nWilliam got a group of officials together to hear Elizabeth’s confession. Her story was heard, and the confession was signed by the witnesses and presented by William to the Supreme Executive Council. The president of the council was Benjamin Franklin, and the vice president was Charles Biddle, who ordered the execution be suspended until January 3rd, 1786, to allow the council more time to determine Elizabeth’s fate.\n\nIn the meantime, William went to hunt down the person Elizabeth claimed had murdered her children. He found the man, who refused to admit even knowing his sister or having any involvement with her children. William then met several witnesses who could link the man to his sister and the city of Philadelphia. Before he could get this information into the hands of law officials, however, William became very ill and had to spend some time recovering at a friend’s house in Philadelphia.\n\nWhen William next arrived at the jail, he realized that he had lost track of time and that Elizabeth’s execution was scheduled for the following day. William rode to Benjamin Franklin’s house, who then sent him to Charles Biddle to have Elizabeth’s execution further postponed. Biddle wrote: “Do not execute Wilson until you hear further from the council.” Biddle understood that members of the council were on Elizabeth Wilson’s side and intended to grant a full pardon. With his order in hand, William set off for Chester to save his sister.\n\n(more…)\n\nPenn’s Cave is located in the Ridge and Valley region in the Appalachian Highlands in central Pennsylvania. The legend that surrounds the cave is a story of love denied. It was originally told by Issac Steele, an old Seneca Indian in 1892.\n\nIn the early 1700’s, the Seneca Indians discovered the cave that is now known as Penn’s Cave. Chief O-Ko-Cho had seven full-grown warrior sons and a daughter, Nita-nee whose beauty was immeasurable and who was guarded by her brothers carefully. A young Frenchmen named Malachi Boyer from Lancaster County came to their camp one day to trade for furs with Chief O-Ko-Cho when he caught a glimpse of Nita-nee and fell in love instantly. When the chief’s sons went out to hunt, he would sneak into the Seneca camp and steal away with Nita-nee. The two fell in love and made plans to run away and marry secretly, since traditions didn’t allow for the Seneca to marry outside their tribe.\n\nWhen the time was ripe, they made their escape into the night. In the morning, when Chief O-Ko-Cho was alerted of his daughter’s absence, he sent his seven sons to track her and Malachi down and bring them back to camp. The brother’s found the runaway couple just outside the eastern settlements and brought them back swiftly. Chief O-Ko-Cho then ordered his sons to throw Malachi into the water cave and guard the entrance to insure that he would not escape and run away with his daughter once more.\n\nFor about a week, Malachi swam back and forth in the dark waters of the cave, probing for an exit that was not guarded by the Seneca, but to no avail. Starving and out of energy, Malachi vowed that Nita-nee’s brothers would not see him die. He traveled to a far recess at one end of the cavern, crawled up to dry bank and died. Nita-nee’s brothers later ventured into the cave with torches, found his body, tied him up with heavy rocks, and threw him in the deepest waters of the cave river by their father’s request. To this day, tour guides and visitors claim that on some occasions, you can hear the Frenchman’s ghost crying out his lost love’s name.\n\nTwo tour guides have admitted hearing her name come from a male voice on separate occasions and believe firmly that the cave is haunted by the ghost of Malachi. Ghost hunters have also visited the cave and found plenty of abnormal behavior, including female voices, Native-American languages being spoken, heavy-breathing, and distant conversations, as well as other strange visions during their stay.\n\nNita-nee, the chief’s beautiful daughter is immortalized in central Pennsylvania as the mascot of Penn State University, the Nittany Lion, as well as local natural monuments: Nittany Mountain and Nittany Valley. Penn Cave opened its doors as a show cave in 1885 and boat tours are available to the public at a reasonable rate.\n\n-Matt Gibson"
