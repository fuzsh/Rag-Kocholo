        "text": "The Biddle family papers preserve almost two hundred years of material related to this prominent Philadelphia family. William Biddle (1630–1712) and Sarah Kemp (1634–1709), were Quakers who emigrated to America from England in 1681 to escape religious persecution. They settled in Mount Hope, New Jersey, with their children, William and Sarah, the only two out of five to survive past infancy.\n\nWilliam Biddle II (1669–1743) married Lydia Wardell of Shrewsbury, New Jersey, and together they had six children (see genealogical chart 1). Their first child, William (1698–1756), married Mary Scull (1709–1790) and together they had ten children, eight of whom survived past infancy. William Biddle relocated his family to Philadelphia, where the family still continues to prosper. The descendants of William Biddle and Mary Scull comprise the first major branch of the Philadelphia Biddles, and their collected papers are housed in Series I.\n\nJames Biddle (1731–1797) was the first child of William and Mary Biddle (see genealogical chart 1). On June 30, 1753, James Biddle married Frances Marks and together they had five children. He received an education in Law from John Ross of Philadelphia, and was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar in 1765. He practiced in Berks, Lancaster, and Northampton counties of Pennsylvania before returning to Philadelphia to become Deputy Prothonotary, and later Deputy Judge of Admiralty under King George III. In December 1776, he resumed his legal practice in Reading, Pennsylvania, but returned to Philadelphia in 1788 to become Prothonotary of the Philadelphia courts. In 1791 James Biddle was made President Judge of the First Judicial District, a position which he held until his death in 1797.\n\nCharles Biddle (1745–1821) was the fifth child of William and Mary Biddle, and the brother of James Biddle (see genealogical chart 1). At an early age he was apprenticed to the Philadelphia merchant William Ball, but left after three years to pursue a seafaring life. His first voyage sailed for Spain in 1763, and later to the West Indies. Responding to rising tensions with the British in January 1776, he joined Captain Cowperwaite’s company of Quaker Light Infantry, in which he served until August 1776. He captained many ships during the Revolution and was a British prisoner-of-war on two separate occasions. In 1778, he married Hannah Shepard of Beaufort, North Carolina, and together they had ten children. In 1778, he was elected to the General Assembly of North Carolina. However, on June 1, 1780 he relocated to Philadelphia and resided in Pennsylvania until his death. In October 1774, he was elected a member of the Supreme Executive Council, and a year later was elected to the Vice-Presidency under Benjamin Franklin’s Presidential tenure. Franklin, largely engaged with other matters, appointed Charles Biddle as acting Chief Executive of the State of Pennsylvania. In 1787, he was elected to the Pennsylvania Legislature, an office which he did not assume as he was appointed at the same time to Clerk of the Supreme Executive Council. In 1791, he was commissioned Prothonotary of the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia and served until 1809. Charles Biddle was elected to the State Senate of Pennsylvania in 1809, and served for several terms. He was also an original member of the Society of Cincinnati, and served as treasurer in 1811. His autobiography, Autobiography of Charles Biddle, Vice President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, 1745–1821, was published by E. Claxton and Company of Philadelphia in 1883.\n\nWilliam Shepard Biddle (1781–1835) was the first child of Charles and Hannah Biddle (see genealogical chart 1). William entered the University of Pennsylvania in 1794 and graduated with the class of 1797. He studied law and was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar in 1801, eventually becoming one of its most distinguished members. He served as director of the Law Library Company of Philadelphia from 1809–1815. He first married Circe Deroncera [or Deroneray], and later married Elizabeth B. Keating, daughter of the honorable Joseph Hopkinson.\n\nNicholas Biddle (1786–1844) was the fourth son of Charles and Hannah Biddle (see genealogical chart 1). A child prodigy, he entered the University of Pennsylvania in 1796 at the age of ten, but was not allowed to receive his degree when he was thirteen on account of his age. He went on to study at the College of New Jersey at Princeton, where he graduated in 1801 as valedictorian. He was an early contributor to Joseph Dennie’s weekly Port Folio. Nicholas Biddle also devoted his time to the study of law, perhaps under his elder brother William S. Biddle (1781–1835). He served as Secretary to General John Armstrong, U.S. minister to France, and attended the coronation of Napoleon in 1804. Nicholas Biddle later served as Secretary to James Monroe, then Minister to England, until 1807. Upon returning to Philadelphia, he continued to study law and was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar in 1809. He served as a trustee to the University of Pennsylvania from 1818 until his death in 1844. In 1811, Nicholas Biddle married Jane M. Craig (b. 1792) and together they had six children (see genealogical chart 2).\n\nCraig Biddle (1823–after 1907) was the third child of Nicholas and Jane Biddle (see genealogical chart 2). He was educated at the College of New Jersey at Princeton, graduating in 1841. He went on to study law in Philadelphia and was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar in 1844. In 1875, he was appointed Judge of Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia, and served in this capacity until his resignation in 1907. He was then appointed Prothonotary of Courts of Philadelphia, but died within a year of assuming the position.\n\nCharles Biddle (fl. 1880–1912) was the grandson of Nicholas Biddle and son of the lawyer and journalist, Charles John Biddle (1819–1873) and Emma Mather (see genealogical chart 2). He was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar in 1880. In 1907, he was a partner in the lawfirm Biddle Ward, but by 1908, he had moved to the firm of Biddle, Paul, Miller, and Jayne. In 1912, he served as an appellant attorney with John G. Johnson (1841–1917) in arguing a case before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. He married Letitia Glenn, and together they had several children.\n\nOn June 27, 1916, he enlisted as a private in the First City Troop (E), First Pennsylvania Cavalry, Twenty-Eighth Division of the National Guard. One year later, he took an examination and recieved a commission as a captain in the United States Army Reserves. In 1920, he was again promoted to major. In 1921, he reenlisted in the Headquarters Troop, 52nd Cavalry Brigade of the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry. He trained as a Reserve Officer and was promoted to corporal and then again to sergeant. His life-long service with the Army reserves earned him the rank of Brigidier General before his death.\n\nIn 1923, Nicholas Biddle established his own insurance brokerage firm, Biddle, Townsend, and Company. After forty-three years of substantial growth, Biddle, Townsend, and Company merged with the insurance brokerage firm of Haughton, Weymouth and Bishop, forming Biddle, Bishop, and Smith, Inc., of which he served as Chairman until his death in the late 1970s.\n\nNicholas Biddle’s wife, Sarah Lippincott, presumably inherited some of her family’s papers. These papers of the Wharton and Lippincott families are represented in Series II.\n\nJoshua Ballinger Lippincott (1813–1886) was the only child of Jacob and Sarah (Ballinger) Lippincott. He was born in Juliustown, New Jersey, and there received a common-school education. He relocated to Philadelphia in 1827 and gained employment with a bookseller. J.B. Lippincott soon mastered the business and assumed its leadership at the age of 18 after his employer went bankrupt. In 1836, he started his own firm, J.B. Lippincott and Company, originally selling bibles, prayer books, and eventually, broader religious writings. In 1849, he purchased Grigg, Elliot, and Company, then the largest publishing house in Philadelphia. The firm reorganized and emerged as Lippincott, Grumbo, and Company in 1850. In 1855, partner Grumbo retired and the company name was changed back to J.B. Lippincott and Company. J.B Lippincott was recognized as the undisputed leader in the publishing field in Philadelphia.\n\nHe served on the boards of Jefferson Medical College and the University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, and served, as well, as the director of the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives and Granting Annuities. He married Josephine Craige on October 16, 1845, and together they had four children.\n\nJoshua Bertram Lippincott (1857–1940) was the only son of Joshua and Josephine Lippincott (see genealogical chart 3). He was born in Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania, and there attended the Episcopal Academy. He entered the University of Pennsylvania in 1878, but withdrew his freshman year to study the publishing business in London, England. Upon his return to Philadelphia, he joined J.B. Lippincott and Company, the family publishing business, in which he was made a full partner by 1884. Upon J. Ballinger’s death on January 5, 1886, J. Bertram assumed the presidency of the company and served in this capacity until his retirement in 1926, at which point he became chairman of the board.\n\nJ. Bertram Lippincott was a director of the Farmers and Mechanics National Bank, president of Philadelphia Veterinary Hospital, and director of the Philadelphia Board of Trade. He received an honorary A.B. in 1907 and an LL.D in 1935 from the University of Pennsylvania, where he served as a Trustee for several years. He also served as a director of both the American Philosophical Society and the Philadelphia Academy of Music. J. Bertram Lippincott married Joanna Wharton on April 22, 1885, and together they had four children.\n\nThe second major branch of the Biddle family descended from John Biddle (1707–1789), the sixth son of William Biddle (1669–1712) and Lydia Wardell. John Biddle married Sarah Owen in 1736.\n\nWilliam Biddle (1806–1887) was the sixth child of John Biddle (1763–1815) and Elizabeth Canby (d. 1832) (see genealogical chart 4).

In 1834, he was elected director of Public Schools in Philadelphia, and later assumed the position of Controller of Public Schools. In 1840, he became Manager of the Magdalen Asylum, and a director of Girard College. In 1849, he was elected to the board of managers of the Pennsylvania Hospital, and was elected its fifteenth president in 1872, a position which he held until his death.\n\nClement Biddle (1740–1814) was the second son of John and Sarah Biddle (see genealogical chart 4). He was born in Philadelphia and entered his father’s shipping and importing business at an early age. Business was interrupted by the onset of the Revolutionary War, when in 1765, Clement and his brother, Owen, signed the non-importation agreement and pursued patriotic activities in Philadelphia. In 1775, Clement Biddle helped to organize a Philadelphia volunteer regiment, the “Quaker Blues.” In July 1776, he was appointed deputy quartermaster-general by Congress, holding the rank of colonel. Clement participated in the battles of Trenton, Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth, and he served under both Washington and General Greene.\n\nHe retired from the military in 1780, and resumed his business as a merchant. In retirement, he was appointed to several military and governmental posts, including Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in 1788, and United States Marshal of Pennsylvania in 1789, a position to which he was appointed by George Washington. He married Mary Richardson, who died in 1773. They had one child, Francis R., who died in infancy. In 1774 Clement married Rebekah Cornell, with whom he had thirteen children.\n\nThomas A. Biddle (1776–1857) was the second child of Clement and Rebekah Biddle (see genealogical chart 5). He entered the University of Pennsylvania in 1788 and graduated with the class of 1791.

William Lyman Biddle attended Dr. Faires’ Classical Institute and went on to study at St. Paul’s in Concord, New Hampshire. He entered the sophomore class of the University of Pennsylvania in 1871 and graduated in 1874. After two years in Europe he entered the New York firm of F.W.

Many of the Rush family papers were inherited by Julia Williams Rush and Alexander Biddle, and these in turn were passed to their children. From these family papers, Alexander Biddle published two volumes of Dr. Benjamin Rush’s letters in 1898. Alexander Biddle’s son, Louis Alexander Biddle, published another volume of Rush material in 1905. After the last of the children of Julia and Alexander Biddle had passed away, in 1943 many of the Rush family papers were sold at the Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York.
