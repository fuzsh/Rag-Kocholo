We all know about the Smith-Cadbury Mansion (1738) and Main Street has at least 11 documented homes built in the 1700s. These homes are easy to keep track of because their Historical Society plaques proclaim their antiquity. But did you know that there are a few 18th century homes that are off the beaten path or hidden from view on the main roads? One such home is set back on the south side of Marne Highway, across from Lockheed Martin’s Gate #5.\n\nAccording to the Moorestown Township Environmental Resource Inventory in the township Master Plan, the oldest portion of the Bispham/Walton House was built c. 1770. But this listing does not reveal the most interesting fact about this beautiful old farm house. Between the years 1812 and 1816, the house was occupied by Commodore Thomas Truxtun (1755-1822), one of the US Navy’s most important early heroes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas Truxton began his career as a merchant seaman when he was 15 and by the age of 20, he achieved his first command. The first four ships that he commanded were privateers. As a commander during the American Revolution, he captured ten enemy ships and he was responsible for the return of Benjamin Franklin to the US from his tour as Ambassador to France. He had a reputation for bravery and tenacity as a disciplined but fair commander and a superior seaman and leader.\n\nTruxtun was appointed as one of the six captains in the new US Navy by President George Washington in 1794 and was assigned to the USS Constellation. He won two important battles against La Vengeance and L’Insurgence during the undeclared war against France between 1798 and 1800. During his time in the Navy he also wrote a well-regarded treatise on latitude and longitude in 1794. He resigned from the Navy in 1802 and retired to Perth Amboy, NJ. On July 22, 1804, Truxton received a visit from his friend, Vice President Aaron Burr who 11 days earlier had shot and killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel in Weehawkin, NJ. According to Eugene S. Ferguson in his book Truxtun of the Constellation , Burr was trying to escape the angry public and press in New York and feared for his life. Truxton entertained his guest overnight and in the morning, personally conveyed him in his carriage to Cranbury, NJ where Burr departed for Philadelphia where he believed he would be met with less hostility. After living in Perth Amboy for a few years, the large Truxtun family moved to Cranbury, NJ in 1808. By 1812, the Truxton family had moved again, this time to a plantation named Woodlawn in Chester Township, just outside of Moorestown. On March 11, 1812 Truxton purchased the 40-acre property which consisted of three tracts from Dr. George Davis. According to the Burlington County Tax Ratables, 1812 [New Jersey State\n\nLibrary]; Call Number: FHL Film 411288; Page Number: 19; Family Number: 3, Truxtun resided on 40 acres in Chester Township. Several letters to his friend Charles Biddle in Philadelphia are signed from him at Woodlawn in Moorestown, according to the Autobiography of Charles Biddle, Vice-President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania written in 1883. Prior to the ownership of George Davis, the property was owned by Joshua Bispham.\n\nIn 1816, at the urging of his friend Charles Biddle, Truxtun ran for Sheriff of Philadelphia and won. The Truxtun family moved yet again to Philadelphia where they remained until he died in 1822. Silas Walton was another notable owner of the plantation in the later 19th century. The house remained in the Walton family until 1983. It is now owned along with the four acre lot it sits on along with two other modern buildings by Virtua Memorial Hospital of Burlington County. Hopefully the current owners realize the important historic legacy over which they have stewardship.\n\n— Stephanie Herz\n\nThe staff of the library continues its ongoing mission – archiving, indexing, filing and researching questions about Moorestown from people near and far. We were especially heartened recently by the news of a substantial anonymous donation directed to the library for the purchase of “administrative items such as new computers, software and archival materials.” This couldn’t have come at a better time as we have been considering the addition and/or updates of all of these items to increase our capabilities in the library! Thank you, Anonymous, from the bottom of our hearts!!"
