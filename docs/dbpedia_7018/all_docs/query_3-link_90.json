        "text": "PUBLICITY KIT\n\nBenjamin Franklin Commemorative Stamps\n\nMarch 2006\n\nDISTRICT MANAGERS, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SALES\n\nPOSTMASTERS\n\nSUBJECT: Benjamin Franklin Commemorative Postage Stamps Kit\n\nThe Postal ServiceTM provides an opportunity to honor Benjamin Franklin, an American icon, during the 300th anniversary year of his birth by issuing four commemorative postage stamps. Each stamp features a collage representing one of four aspects of Franklin's life - as a printer, a postmaster, a scientist, and a statesman.\n\nBenjamin Franklin holds the unique distinction of being the second most popular subject to be commemorated on a postage stamp, with more than 100 stamp issuances in his honor since 1847. His connection to the Postal Service as the first postmaster general under the Continental Congress in 1775 has earned him a cherished place in the history of our organization.\n\nThese 2006 stamps have educational, historical, and scientific value and represent the heritage of the United States and the Postal Service. The stamps will be dedicated on April 7 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the National Constitution Center.\n\nDuring this year-long anniversary celebration, we encourage you to host special events in your community highlighting one or all of the four aspects of Franklin's career depicted on the stamps.\n\nThe enclosed publicity kit serves as a guide to help you plan your local Benjamin Franklin commemorative postage stamp dedication events and activities. Partnering with the organizations listed in this kit will help you generate publicity. In fact, it's likely that these organizations will offer suggestions, provide recommendations for hosting facilities, and allow you to partner with an established event they are hosting. In addition, Postal Facts are included at the end of this kit as valuable information for the media. Our Public Affairs and Communications team members are available to assist you in coordinating publicity efforts. Please feel free to call on them.\n\nThank you for your support and for taking advantage of this exciting opportunity to celebrate our first postmaster general. Your participation in this year's dedication events of the Benjamin Franklin commemorative postage stamps is vital to their success.\n\nAzeezaly S. Jaffer\n\nVice President\n\nPublic Affairs and Communications\n\ncc: Vice Presidents, Area Operations\n\nManager, Capital Metro Operations\n\nOverview\n\nThe Benjamin Franklin commemorative postage stamps will be issued April 7 at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, PA. This stamp release follows the 300th anniversary of Benjamin Franklin's birth on January 17. This is a year-long celebration and you will have many opportunities to hold a dedication or \"second day\" event. The Benjamin Franklin commemorative postage stamps will go on sale nationwide April 8, 2006.\n\nBackground\n\nBenjamin Franklin, Scientist\n\nThe stamp image honoring Franklin as a scientist includes a whimsical 19th-century Currier and Ives lithograph depicting Franklin and his son performing the legendary electricity experiment with a kite; a page from Franklin's 1769 volume Experiments and Observations on Electricity, depicting water spouts and a \"magic square;\" a schematic drawing of Franklin's \"three-wheeled clock\" from the late 18th-century book Select Mechanical Exercises by James Ferguson; and a depiction of Franklin at a writing desk from a mural by Charles Elliott Mills at the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology in Boston, MA. The text on the back of the stamp sheet reads:\n\nRemembered for the pursuits he called \"philosophical amusements,\" Benjamin Franklin was intensely curious about natural phenomena. His observations and experiments in areas such as electricity and meteorology resulted in interesting inventions, including a heating stove, the lightning rod and an early electrical battery.\n\nBenjamin Franklin, Printer\n\nThe image of the stamp honoring Franklin as a printer includes a portrait of him in a printer's smock by illustrator Michael Dooling; a copy of the Pennsylvania Gazette dated Sept. 25 through Oct. 2, 1729; the front of the 1733 edition of Poor Richard's Almanack; and a 5-pound currency note printed by Franklin in 1760. The text on the back of the stamp sheet reads:\n\nFrom his childhood apprenticeship in Boston to his career in Philadelphia as an adult, Benjamin Franklin enjoyed a lifelong association with printing. In addition to the Pennsylvania Gazette and Poor Richard's Almanack, his presses also printed a wide range of materials, such as government pamphlets, religious tracts, currency and books.\n\nB. Free Franklin, Postmaster\n\nThe Continental Congress appointed Franklin as the first Postmaster General of the organization known today as the United States Postal Service. The stamp honoring Franklin as a postmaster includes a graphic device used by the Boston Post-Boy newspaper during the middle 18th century; a colonial postal cover from Marlboro, MD, on a 1775 letter to Philadelphia; a colonial-era date postmark; and a late 18th-century painting of Franklin by Charles Wilson Peale after a portrait by David Martin. The text on the back of the stamp sheet reads:\n\nBenjamin Franklin was vital to the organization of the American postal system, serving as postmaster of Philadelphia and a deputy postmaster for the American colonies before being appointed postmaster general by the Continental Congress in 1775. He marked postage-free letters with his unique personal signature: \"B. Free Franklin.\" Text across the bottom of the stamp reads \"B. Free Franklin, Postmaster,\" a reference to Franklin's personal franking signature.\n\nBenjamin Franklin, Statesman\n\nThe stamp honoring Franklin as a statesman includes a detail from John Trumbull's famous painting of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, painted between 1786 and 1819; a copy of Franklin's 1754 \"Join or Die\" political cartoon urging colonial unity; the top of a printed copy of the Declaration of Independence; a pastel portrait of Franklin by Joseph-Siffred Duplessis, painted during the 1780s; and the French side of the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, which was negotiated and signed by Franklin. The text on the back of the stamp sheet reads:\n\nDeeply involved in politics and civic life, Benjamin Franklin served in the Continental Congress and signed both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Often considered America's first diplomat, Franklin negotiated an alliance with France and helped to secure a peace treaty with Great Britain.\n\nPublicity Ideas to Interest the Media\n\nKeep in mind that these stamps have significant national, historic, and political importance. Senators and congressional representatives, as well as local elected officials, will be interested in this stamp and the events surrounding it. It is a good idea to contact your Postal Service Government Relations representative for guidance in involving elected officials when planning your event.\n\nYour district Public Affairs and Communications representatives are also available and ready to assist you in coordinating publicity for your events.\n\nThere are many ways to interest local media in the Benjamin Franklin commemorative postage stamps by planning local events; partnering with local historic and science museums and organizations; and contacting your local television meteorologists, Benjamin Franklin grade schools, newspaper organizations, and colleges or universities. Following are some suggestions to capture media attention.\n\n• Form an alliance with your local television meteorologist.\n\n• Ask the local television meteorologist to conduct a live broadcast from your local Post OfficeTM, or other event location, when the Benjamin Franklin commemorative postage stamps go on sale or during the weather segment on television. Franklin's impact upon meteorological studies was profound. Provide these talking points to your television meteorologist or weather reporter when showing the Benjamin Franklin stamps. Provide them with the background of the Benjamin Franklin, Scientist stamp (see below).\n\nTalking Points to Provide to Your Television Meteorologist\n\n\"Some are weather-wise, some are otherwise.\" - Benjamin Franklin\n\n• One can find Franklin's first recorded weather forecasts in the 1735, Poor Richard's Almanak, illustrated in the Benjamin Franklin, Printer stamp. In this publication Ben Franklin wrote: \"Some are weather- wise, some are otherwise.\"\n\n• Intellectually curious, Benjamin Franklin was one of the greatest scientists of his day. He was intensely curious about natural phenomena such as electricity, meteorology, magnetism, and the Gulf Stream.\n\n• Franklin's observations and experiments resulted in the progression of atmospheric science.\n\n• As an avid publisher, Franklin kept records of his observations. He observed the weather systems in North America and concluded that storms moved from west to east. This notion of storms traveling eventually led to Franklin's synoptic charts of dynamic meteorology, which ultimately replaced the use of climatology charts.\n\n• Franklin studied oceanography by gathering information from Atlantic Ocean sailors and also kept records of his own travels. In 1768, he published the first map of the Gulf Stream current.\n\n• His investigations into electricity - including his famous kite experiment - formed the basis for numerous discoveries by succeeding generations of scientists.\n\n• His observations and experiments resulted in interesting inventions, including a heating stove, the lightning rod, and an early electrical battery.\n\n• Other aspects that fascinated Franklin were natural events such as volcano eruptions and tornados. Today, many refer to him as the first theorist of volcano-climate interactions.\n\nPartnering With Local Schools\n\nForm an alliance with the hundreds of Benjamin Franklin schools right in your community. Do any of the schools in your area bear Benjamin Franklin's name? If so, this would be an opportune time to honor the school by having a stamp ceremony. They may already have events planned to celebrate the school's namesake. Below is a chart, by state, of many schools named after Benjamin Franklin. However, this list is not final, so do not hesitate to do a search in your area!\n\nArizona BENJAMIN FRANKLIN CHARTER SCHOOL\n\n13732 E WARNER RD\n\nGILBERT AZ 85296-2808\n\nPhone:

Use the following suggestions to generate media exposure.\n\n• Benjamin Franklin's first career was as a printer and newspaper publisher. Provide the editor with the appropriate background (Found in the press release on page 12) and ask that the paper feature an article about the Benjamin Franklin commemorative postage stamps.\n\n• Hold a second-day dedication ceremony at your local newspaper featuring the Benjamin Franklin commemorative postage stamps, specifically emphasizing the Benjamin Franklin, Printer stamp.\n\n• If your area only has a large metropolitan newspaper, share the idea with your neighborhood section's editors.\n\n• Your community newspaper may be a member of the National Newspaper Association (NNA) and participate in the Benjamin Franklin Community Newspaper and Postal Partnership Award of Excellence Program. The NNA and the Postal Service have partnered to choose postal employees that have made significant contributions to community newspapers. Newspapers that are members of the NNA nominate postal employees based on their efforts.\n\n• A postal employee in your area or state may have been nominated or may be the state or national winner! This would be an opportune time to get your community involved and hold a special dedication ceremony with the nominee during a Benjamin Franklin stamp ceremony for the namesake of the award.\n\n• On the next page is a list, categorized by region, of NNA representatives you can contact to find out if your community newspaper is a member.\n\nRegion No. 1\n\n(Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, and\n\nVermont)\n\nMatt Hayes, Publisher\n\nEast Bay Newspapers\n\nmhayes@eastbaynewspapers.com Region No. 2\n\n(New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania)\n\nElizabeth (Liz) K.

It is incredible to think of the everyday things we experience and how most of them can be traced right back to Franklin. From his numerous inventions, the electricity that keeps our society and businesses moving, to the everyday thoughts, ideas, and ways to live, and to the letters and packages that are delivered to our s everyday.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, you, too, have the opportunity to make a difference. One step is to keep Benjamin Franklin's legacy and brilliance alive and take part in the Postal Service's nationwide celebration - for our children and our children's children.\n\nTake the time this year to appreciate history and honor this great teacher, leader, and inventor.
