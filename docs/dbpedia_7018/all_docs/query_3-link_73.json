        "text": "In 1971, the major cultural institutions along the Ben Franklin Parkway conceived of a street festival that would double as a fundraiser.\n\nThe basic premise: close the Parkway to cars for one Sunday and have a big party.\n\nBecause of local blue laws, Philly didn’t have a sterling reputation for Sunday entertainment. As W.C. Fields famously said: “I once spent a year in Philadelphia. I think it was on a Sunday.”\n\nSuper Sunday represented an effort to shed that reputation and revive interest in the city core.\n\nOrganizers picked Oct. 10 for the inaugural gathering. It was a real hodgepodge, combining carnival rides, food vendors, and flea market stalls. The fountain at Logan Circle was stocked with fish for people to catch. There was a boa constrictor named Goliath, Bavarian beer gardens, and the world’s fastest Ferrari.\n\nDespite heavy rain, the first Super Sunday drew tens of thousands to the Parkway. And a tradition was born.\n\nSoon, hundreds of thousands were coming to the annual event.\n\nBy 1974, Super Sunday was such a phenomenon that the New York Times dubbed it the “world’s biggest block party” in a feature piece.\n\nThe event had an anything-goes vibe. Attendees that year “found stands promoting antivivisectionism, the Boy Scouts, the Baptist Church, Buddhism, a rollback in the price of sugar, and the candidacies of three state legislators,” according to the Times.\n\nOver the years, Super Sunday featured a wide array of entertainment options.\n\nIn 1973, you could see a 2,000 pound sculpture of an ice cream sundae.\n\nIn 1974, you could test a new device called the breathalyzer.\n\nIn 1975, you could play tic-tac-toe on a computer.\n\nIn 1978, you could honor the reign of France’s Napoleon III.\n\nIn 1981, you could watch a harness race on the Parkway.\n\nIn 1983, you could get free hugs from members of the Unity Church of Christ.\n\nIn 1987, you could cheer the “Miller Lite arm wrestlers” as they battled.\n\nIn 1988, you could get your picture taken with Alf.\n\nIn 1991, you could help set a record for most people simultaneously doing the “Monster Mash.”\n\nIn 1993, you could see the car used by the “Munsters.”\n\nIn 1995, you could meet the Exxon tiger.\n\nSpeaking of Exxon, in the 90s, the oil giant became the festival’s official sponsor. It was actually rebranded as Exxon Super Sunday. But in 1998, Exxon pulled its sponsorship. After that, the festival’s organizing committee announced the end of Super Sunday.\n\nExxon’s withdrawal was the final blow, but in many ways the festival’s demise was a result of its success.\n\nSuper Sunday had spawned many imitators, both in Philly and elsewhere. Festivals like Unity Day and Welcome America now dotted the city’s events calendar.\n\n“It’s a shame,” deputy mayor Kevin Feeley told the Inquirer. “It was a terrific event, and I think that in a lot of ways, events that in some ways copied it have overtaken it.”\n\nThat’s how it often goes for trailblazers — Super Sunday being no exception."
