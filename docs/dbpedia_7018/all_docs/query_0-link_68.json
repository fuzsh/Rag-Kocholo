To this plantation Mr. Biddle gave the name of 'Mount Hope . . . Mr. Biddle was one of the leading men in the early public affairs of the province,\" continues Dr. Leach, \"and, in 1682, at the organization of the first governor's council, he became a member of that body, and was also commissioned one of the justices of the peace of Burlington County, and a member of the board of Land Commissioners. He was re-elected to the Council in 1683, 1684, and 1685, and again, in 1701, and during the years 1683, 1684, 1685, 1687, and 1697, he was a member of the Assembly.

His first voyage sailed for Spain in 1763, and later to the West Indies. In October 1774, he was elected a member of the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council, and a year later was elected to the Vice-Presidency under Benjamin Franklin's Presidential tenure. Franklin, largely engaged with other matters, appointed Charles Biddle as acting Chief Executive of the State of Pennsylvania. Responding to rising tensions with the British in January 1776, he joined Captain Cowperwaite's company of Quaker Light Infantry, in which he served until August 1776. He captained many ships during the Revolution and was a British prisoner-of-war on two separate occasions.\n\nIn 1778 he married Hannah Shepard of Beaufort, North Carolina, and together they had ten children. Hannah's neice, Catherine Lardner, married John Heysham Gibbon.\n\nIn 1778, he was elected to the General Assembly of North Carolina. However, on June 1, 1780 he relocated to Philadelphia and resided in Pennsylvania until his death. In 1787, he was elected to the Pennsylvania Legislature, an office which he did not assume as he was appointed at the same time to Clerk of the Supreme Executive Council. In 1791, he was commissioned Prothonotary of the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia and served until 1809. Charles Biddle was elected to the State Senate of Pennsylvania in 1809, and served for several terms. He was also an original member of the Society of Cincinnati, and served as treasurer in 1811.

William entered the University of Pennsylvania in 1794 and graduated with the class of 1797. He studied law and was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar in 1801, eventually becoming one of its most distinguished members. He served as director of the Law Library Company of Philadelphia from 1809-1815. He first married Circe Deroncera [or Deroneray], and later married Elizabeth B. Keating, daughter of the honorable Joseph Hopkinson. He died in 1835.\n\n(22) Commodore James Biddle (1783)\n\n(18) William Biddle (1630) (19) William Biddle II (1669) (20) William Biddle III (1698) (21) Charles Biddle (1745)\n\nCommodore in the American Navy and nephew to Captain Nicholas Biddle. He was born on 18 February 1783 in Philadelphia and joined the Navy in 1800. In the war with the Barbary pirates of Tripoli he served as a midshipman on board the PHILADELPHIA under Captain William Bainbridge and became his protege. He was captured and imprisoned by them for 19 months after the loss of the frigate PHILADELPHIA.\n\nHe was first lieutenant of the sloop-of-war WASP in the sea fight with the British sloop-of-war FROLIC, and led the boarders when the decks of the Englishman were carried. He was commander of the HORNET in the action with the British ship PENGUIN when the latter was captured after a furious conflict, her captain being among the list of killed.\n\nAfter the War of 1812, now a Captain, he was sent out in the sloop-of-war ONTARIO in 1817 and took possession of the Oregon territory on the Columbia River in 1818 on behalf of the United States. In March 1822 he was negotiating with the Captain-General of Cuba for the right to pursue pirates into Cuban waters. He then served as one of the representatives of his government in negotiating its first treaty with Turkey in 1826.\n\nIn 1826 he was the Commodore of the South American squadron, assigned to protect American interests on the east coast of that continent. His broad pennant flew aboard the MACEDONIAN. Ensign Matthew Maury served aboard her. Might Lardner Gibbon's later assignment to the Naval Observatory with Maury have something to do with this connection?\n\nIn 1829 President Jackson appointed Commodore Biddle to command the Mediterranean squadron. He was afterwards commander of the Navy Yard and governor at the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia, from 1838 to 1842. Note that it was about this time that Midshipman Lardner Gibbon might have attended the naval school at the Asylum to prepare for his examinations.\n\nIn 1845 he commanded the Navy's East India Squadron onboard his flagship was the USS COLUMBUS. He exchanged ratifications of the first treaty with China and acted as United States commissioner to that country. He also sailed into Tokyo Bay in July 1846 on board the ships COLUMBUS and VINCESSES in hopes of negotiating a treaty with that country, but the Japanese refused and he had to beat a hasty retreat. From there he sailed to the west coast of America where he assumed command of naval forces in the final days of the conquest of California during the Mexican-American War. He died on 1 Oct 1848.

Biddle was a merchant engaged in business in Philadelphia until he failed in 1826, moved to Nashville, Tennessee, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1827. He practiced law and established the Tennessee Reporter in 1832. He was sent by President Andrew Jackson to Central America and New Granada to investigate the possibility of a trans-Isthmian canal in 1835-1836. He traversed the Isthmus via the Chagres River to the City of Panama. He obtained a concession for the Atlantic and Pacific Transportation Company, a private company, of the right to build and maintain a road to Panama, and exclusive right to steam navigation on the Magdalena River. He died on 21 December 1836 in Washington, D.C. See also John M.

Biddle, Jr. (1787)\n\nI had thought this was a son of Commodore Biddle because he was in possession of a silver medal given to Commodore Biddle as a Lieutenant for his part in the capture of the FROLIC. However, Connie Houchins writes,\n\n\"Good afternoon Mr. Hissem:\n\nI came across your web pages regarding different family members relationship to the Biddle family in the course of some research. I noticed a fact which you might want to change to provide accuracy. James Stokes Biddle was a son of Charles Biddle (1787-1836), not Commodore James Biddle who never married. Charles Biddle and the Commodore were brothers, sons of Charles Biddle (1745-1821) and Hannah Shepard, sister of Ann whom I read about on the Lardner page. Charles Biddle (d. 1836) is also featured on one of your pages as surveying for the railroad as well as charged by Jackson to find a route via Panama. I enjoyed reading your different family genealogies, and it is indeed interesting to see how the different families connected over time.\"\n\nHe was born in Philadelphia on 15 January 1818. He was appointed a midshipman in the United States navy on 18 October 1833.

He became the leading target of the Jacksonians in their war against the bank. After the bank failed of recharter, Biddle operated it as a private bank until it collapsed in 1841 as an aftermath of the Panic of 1837. He was charged with fraud but was subsequently acquitted.

On 01 August 1775 he became Commanding Officer of the armed galley FRANKLIN, which had been fitted out by the Pennsylvania Committee of Safety to defend the Delaware. In December 1775, Captain Biddle took command of the 14-gun brig ANDREW DORIA and joined the fleet commanded by Esek Hopkins in the expedition against New Providence. In this action ANDREW DORIA captured numerous armed merchantmen, including two armed transports carrying 400 reinforcements for the British Army in North America.\n\nLater, Captain Biddle assumed command of RANDOLPH, 32 guns, which was manned in part by paroled British prisoners of war. These prisoners mutinied shortly after the ship sailed, but the superb leadership of the 27 year old captain ended the trouble quickly. Violent storms dismasted his ship off the Delaware Capes, but Captain Biddle's superb seamanship brought RANDOLPH into Charleston for repairs. He sailed again for the West Indies on 04 September 1777 and enroute captured HMS TRUE BRITON, along with her three ship convoy. Captain Biddle took his fourth prize back to Charleston and was blockaded there until late February 1778, when he successfully eluded the British patrol and escaped to the open sea.\n\nOn 07 March, 1778 RANDOLPH engaged HMS YARMOUTH, 64 guns. Despite his firepower disadvantage and a severe wound received early in action, Captain Biddle brilliantly directed the cannon fire of his ship, and YARMOUTH's commanding officer later reported that RANDOLPH fired three accurate broadsides to YARMOUTH's one. Tragically, however, fire penetrated RANDOLPH's powder magazines, and the ship exploded and sank instantly. Captain Biddle perished, and his 315 man crew had only four survivors.\n\nSeveral Navy ships have been named for him, most recently a guided missile cruiser, CG-34.\n\n(20) Joseph Biddle (c1705)\n\n(18) William Biddle (1630) (19) William Biddle II (1669)\n\nA farmer of Burlington, West Jersey.\n\n(20) John Biddle (1707)\n\n(18) William Biddle (1630) (19) William Biddle II (1669)\n\nThe youngest son of William Biddle Jr. He was born in 1707.
