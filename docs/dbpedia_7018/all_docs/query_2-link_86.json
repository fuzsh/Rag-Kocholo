Augustin Grignon, at his residence at the Butte des Morts, on Fox river, and spent a couple of weeks with him, from May 26th to June 8th, 1857, in obtaining the following narrative. It is here presented just as I noted it down from his lips at the time, all simple and unadorned — characteristic of the aged chronicler, whose narrative it is of a life time's recollections. It is true, that while the facts and statements are essentially his, the language, order and arrangement are mine, as are sometimes the Inferences and deductions, but in all cases with his approval and adoption.\n\nMr. Grignon, though now seventy-seven years old, is robust and healthy; the hardy life he has led as a trader in the wilderness, with the simplicity of his habits, seems to have toughened his constitution, so that old age does not appear irksome to him. He is cheerful, pleasant and communicative. Intelligent and well read. I was pleased to observe, that he was familiar with that rare and sterling old work, Charlevoix's Histoire de la Nouvelle France, published in three quarto volumes, in 1744. He spends his time mostly between fishing, smoking, and reading the papers, of which one is Le Courier des Stats-Unis.\n\nI have taken great pains to elicit from Mr. Grignon a narrative, as replete as possible, of the men, events, habits, and life of the olden time. I felt that another such opportunity of securing a full account of the early settlement and early men of Eastern Wisconsin, would never again occur; a native of the country, and an intelligent descendant, as he is, of the Sieur Charles De Langlade, emphatically the Father of Wisconsin, and personally acquainted with him, as well also as with Glode, Tomah and other noted Menomone chiefs; and with Reaume, Porlier, Lawe and their fellow pioneers, a participant in the war of 1812, and in the Black Hawk war; with a retentive memory, in no wise disposed to exaggerate, filled with a just and discriminating knowledge of the men and events of Wisconsin for the past seventy-two years, and by tradition for the forty years preceding — such a living chronicle we may never expect to see again in Wisconsin. Very much of this information he alone possessed — the last of the grand-children of Charles De Langlade; and\n\n196\n\nhis narrative is all the more precious, as it covers a period when there were no newspapers in Wisconsin, as there now are, to chronicle the occurrences of each passing day, no diaries kept, and but two or three casual travelers who have left us any memorials of their observations, and those exceedingly meagre. I may over-estimate the historic value of Mr. Grignon's narrative, but I think not; if this generation cannot appreciate it, those who come after us will do so. I cannot but think, that the time will come, when some gifted son or daughter of Wisconsin will weave the interesting story of the Sieur Charles De Langlade into an historic romance or epic poem, that will impart an enduring charm to the wild nomadic times of an hundred years ago on the far-distant shores of the beautiful la Baye des Puants.\n\nCapt. Grignon, now somewhat bent with the weight of almost tour score years, must in his prime have been nearly six feet in height, with a manly, well-proportioned form, an expressive, benignant, hazel eye, a full and pre-possessing countenance. When about twenty-five, he married Miss Nancy McCrea, daughter of a trader of the name of McCrea, and of a Menomonee woman, one of la noblesse — a near relative of the Old King, Tomah, I-om-e-tah and Oshkosh. Six children were the fruit of this marriage, three of whom survive. Mrs. Grignon died at the Butte des Morts, October 24th, 1842, at the age of fifty-three years.\n\nTo Mr. Grignon's son-in-law, Louis B. Porlier, a son of the late Judge Porlier, one of the pioneers of the country, I desire to express my grateful acknowledgements for his generous and constant assistance in the procurement of this narrative, and whose intimate knowledge of the Menomonees enabled him to render both Mr. Grignon and myself essential aid. L. C. D.\n\n197\n\nSeventy-two Years' Recollections of Wisconsin\n\nThe Sieur Augustan De Langlade and his son Charles, may be regarded as the founders of the first permanent settlement in Wisconsin. Augustin De Langlade was a native of France, where he was born about 1695. His family were of the nobility, and had their castle, and it is believed that Augustin served awhile, in early life, in the French marine. He had several relatives in Canada, among them a cousin, named Celleberre, a colonel in the French service; and these probably had some influence in turning his attention to America. New France, as all Canada and the immense North-West were then called, was the great field of enterprise for the young men of France, and especially for the younger nobility, whose inheritance was limited, and whose desire for fame or wealth prompted them to seek their fortunes in the New World. De Langlade must have been quite a young man when he arrived in Canada, and soon engaged in the Indian trade; his first known locality was among the Ottawas, near Mackinaw, as early as about 1720. It is very likely that he accompanied De Lignery's expedition against the Foxes up Fox river, in 1728, as the expedition passed by Mackinaw, and a body of Ottawas joined the French, and De Langlade had then been several years located as a trader among them.\n\nWhile at Mackinaw, he was, so far as I know, only engaged as a trader, and had probably the entire control of the trade\n\n198\n\nat that point, as it was customary to obtain a license from the French government of Canada for that purpose. At Mackinaw, he married the sister of the head Ottawa Chief, King Nis-so-wa-quet, or, as the French called him, La Fourche, or The Fork; and this connection must have largely added to his influence among that nation. Their eldest child was a daughter, named Agate, who was born about 1722, and married for her first husband a Mr. Souligny, who is represented as a man of severity and cruelty, which he had probably learned while an officer in the French service; and he dying, she married Amable Roy, and lived to a great age, and died at Green Bay, having never had any children. Their second child, Charles De Langlade, was born at the Ottawa village at or near Mackinaw, in 1724. There were two younger sons, whose names are not recollected, and a daughter, who married a Mr. De Verville, and had one son, Gautier De Verville. Charles received such an education as the missionaries near Mackinaw could impart. When he was ten years of age, the Ottawas were engaged in a war against some allied tribe of the English, who aided to interrupt the French communication with Louisiana, and whose main village was under the rule of a squaw chief. This village was located on a prairie, protected by such defences as Indians were able to make; and twice had the Ottawas attacked the place, and twice been discomfitted. When urged by the French Commandant, probably at Mackinaw, to make a third attempt upon the enemy's stronghold, they declined; but at length King Nis-so-wa-quet and his brothers, prompted by some superstitions dream, whim, or prestige, said they would again make the trial, provided, they could be accompanied by their young nephew Charles De Langlade and would go on no other condition. The Commandant went to the Sieur Augustin De Langlade, and made known the requirement of the chiefs; and, surprised at the request for such a mere lad to accompany them, and thinking perhaps it was a plan which\n\n199\n\nthe youth had formed, and had desired his uncles to put into effect, M. De Langlade went to his son and asked him concerning the matter, when Charles frankly assured his father that it was no plan or wish of his. \"Well,\" said the father, \"you must go with your uncles; but never let me hear of your showing any marks of cowardice.\" Reaching the place, young Charles and some other lads, also taken along, were placed in the rear, in full view, but out of danger of the attack, which was soon made; and, after a severe assault, the place was taken. Viewing the conflict, Charles used to relate to me, in his old age, that it then seemed like a ball-play to him. Ever after, when the Ottawas went on war expeditions, they were invariably accompanied by young Charles De Langlade.\n\nAt an early age, Charles De Langlade had a son, by an Ottawa Woman at Mackinaw, whom he named after himself, and who, at a proper age, was sent to Canada and educated, and returning, joined his Indian kindred at Mackinaw, and lived to a good old age. He was in the British Indian service at the capture of Mackinaw, in 1812, and acted as interpreter for the Ottawas. Late in life he married an Ottawa woman, by whom he had two sons and two daughters; one of the sons, Louis Langlade, was living eight years since, then a lieutenant in the British service, and stationed at Toronto, unmarried; of the daughters, one was married to one Abram La Brun, and when last heard from, was residing at the Lake of the Two Mountains; the other was living last year, at Mackinaw, with her husband, Francis Luzienias.\n\nAbout 1745, the Sieur Augustin De Langlade and his son Charles, left Mackinaw, and migrated to Green Bay, where they became the principal proprietors of the soil. They settled on the east side of Fox river near its mouth, somewhat above and opposite the old French post, and about\n\n200\n\nwhere Judge Arndt now resides, at the upper end of Green Bay. I do not remember whether my grandfather, Charles De Langlade, made any intention to me as to whether the old French fort was garrisoned when he and his father came there, but presume it was; nor do I remember any particular reasons that induced their settlement at the Bay. It was probably made in consequence of the Sieur Augustin De Langlade either accompanying De Lignery's expedition against the Foxes in 1728, or hearing the officers, soldiers and Ottawas who served under De Lignery, on their return, speak highly of the country, or from being invited to locate and trade there by the surrounding Indians, who may have traded with him at Mackinaw. And it is quite likely that my grandfather, who seems from early life to have been engaged by the Government in the Indian Department, was directed to locate west of Lake Michigan, the better to attend to the interests of the Indians in that quarter, and also to have command of the militia, when the settlement should be made.\n\nAs the date of the first permanent settlement made in Wisconsin may be regarded, as important by the present and future generations, I will state the circumstances upon which I found my belief that the De Langlades commenced their settlement at the period indicated. My grandfather told me he was in the battle with the Sauks (for the Sauks and Foxes were allies,) at Green Bay, which occurred in or shortly before 1746, as stated by Hon. Morgan L. Martin in his Historical Address, at which time my grandfather was twenty-two years of age; and I know also, that previous to his leaving Mackinaw, his son Charles, by an Ottawa woman, was born — which I presume was when my grandfather was about twenty years old, and hence about 1744. This would give the date of the settlement of the Langlades at Green\n\n201\n\nBay, somewhere between 1744 and 1746; and as the engagement with the Sauks may not have occurred quite so late as 1746, the year in which the Sauks and their allies, the Foxes, were finally driven, from the Fox River Valley, I have concluded the settlement was made, as already stated, about 1745.\n\nWith the De Langlades, probably, came but a few settlers, beyond their own family. M. Souligny, the son-in-law of Sieur De Langlade, with his wife; and either then or soon after they were joined by Mons. Carron, who had been many years engaged, in the Indian trade, and had fully twenty years before been among the Menomonees, and he continued to reside at the Bay the remainder of his days. If others then came, their names are not now known; so probably not more than eight persons formed the little colony who commenced the permanent settlement of Wisconsin. That their reception by the Indians inhabiting Green Bay was pleasant, was distinctly told me by my grandfather; but the band of Te-pak-e-ne-nee, or The Night-Man, living about two miles up Menomonee river, at their village of Min-ne-kau-nee, or Pleasant Town, where Marinette or Menomonee City is now located, used to come down, and make their threats that they would take by force Indian goods from Augustin De Langlade's store, or the Government stores in charge of Charles De Langlade, calculating to intimidate, in order to get credit for goods, or have some given to them; but Charles De Langlade would pleasantly say to them, \"Well, my friends, if you have come here to fight, we can cross to the prairie on the other side of the river, and have a little fun.\" But they knew too well his reputation as a soldier even from his boyhood, and declined his invitation, and be had no more difficulty with them. But some time afterwards, Te-pak-e-ne-nee got into a quarrel with a trader named St. Germain, at the mouth of the Menomonee river, and fatally stabbed him. While yet a youth, I remember seeing Te-pak-e-ne-nee,\n\n202\n\nthen an old man. He went with his people to the Upper Mississippi on a hunt, and there fell very sick, and a Chippewa medicine-man, after his incantations, said he would get well, but that he had killed a man, and would die in the same way. Not long after his return, Te-pak-e-ne-nee got into a fight with another Indian at Red River of Green Bay, and worsted him, when the latter, piqued at his discomfiture, took his gun and shot old Te-pak-e-ne-nee dead.\n\nSometime about, this period, a blacksmith of the name of Lammiot came from France, and located himself at Green Bay, and worked at his trade. An Indian, named Ish-qua-ke-ta, left an axe with him to be repaired. At length the Indian came for his axe, and threw down a skin as the price for the work, and took his property; when Lammiot, whose memory was very poor and treacherous, replied that it was not his axe — that he had none, and bid him be off. High words followed, and Lammiot seized the Indian by the neck with his hot tongs, both burning and choking him, when Ish-qua-ke-ta struck Lammiot a heavy blow over the head with the axe, and knocked him down senseless. The Indian hastened to Charles De Langlade, and frankly said, \"I have killed the blacksmith.\" \"What did you do that for?\" \"Why,\" said the Indian, \"look here — see how he choked and burnt me; I had to do it in self defence.\" De Langlade went and found Lammiot, carried him to his bed, and employed an Indian doctress to take care of him. When nearly recovered, an elder brother of Te-pak-e-ne-nee called, and asked to see the blacksmith, as he wanted to see how he was getting along. Upon entering the room, and walking up to the bed, he stabbed him with a knife, and killed him instantly. When asked by the attendant squaw why he killed, Lammiot, he said he pitied the blacksmith, and wished to put an end to his sufferings. The murderer fled to some distant region, and remained till the excitement against him had cooled down, when he returned, and thus escaped a merited punishment. But he\n\n203\n\nwas not long after killed by an Indian in a drunken brawl, while his murderer was at the same time fatally stabbed by another.\n\nOf the legend of the Red Banks, narrated in the 2d vol. of the Society's Collections, as related by O-kee-wah, I may add, that I have known O-kee-wah from my childhood, when her mother used to winter in the Green Bay settlement. O-kee-wah was frequently at my father's house, and I am confident that instead of being over one hundred years of age, she is only about six years my senior — or, in other words, is now about eighty-three years old. I have always regarded her as a good woman, and very industrious; but have my doubts about the correctness of her narrative. In the first place, O-kee-wah is no Menomonee, as she represents herself to be, for nationality is reckoned on the mother's side. Her mother, Non-non-ga-nah, was early captured by the Ottawas from the Pawnees or Osages, or some other Western tribe, and a year or two after being brought to Green Bay had O-kee-wah, some said by Charles De Langlade, and she subsequently had four husbands, all Ottawas except the last, who was a Menomonee, and had children by them all; and O-kee-wah herself has had three husbands, the two former were Chippewas, and the latter a Menomonee — so in no literal sense can she claim to have received such a tradition from her Menomonee grandfather. Besides, the narrative itself is evidently given in an exaggerated style — too many canoes, and the blood ankle deep in the ditches, would remind one of Waterloo or some other sanguinary battle on a large scale. Yet, after all, O-kee-wah may have heard such a tradition from the father of one of her mother's husbands, or the grandfather of one of her own, of whom she was perhaps in the habit of speaking as her grandfather.\n\nI remember, very many years ago, having an aged Ottawa relate to me, as a tradition he had heard in his younger days, from aged people, of his tribe, that the Ottawas used to make\n\n204\n\nwar upon the Winnebagoes, who had their village on the elevated ground, spoken of in O-kee-wah's narrative as the Red Banks, but which has been always known by the French as Le Cap des Puants; that while an Ottawa war party was on the way there, their leader became impressed, from some wrangling between two of his young warriors respecting some fish they had caught, with a presentiment that some misfortune would befall them. But they went on in their canoe, and disembarked at a place called the Maniste river, and pursuing their route by land, they were discovered by the Winnebagoes, who went forth stealthily and way-laid them, and quickly defeated the whole, making the leader of the Ottawas their prisoner, whom they took to their village and tortured to death.\n\nAs the details of the war which eventuated in the expulsion of the Sauks and Foxes from the Fox River Valley in 1746, are of much interest, I shall give them as fully as I have learned them from the lips of my grandfather, Charles De Langlade, who took an active part in some of the occurrences narrated, and from other ancient settlers and Indians.\n\nThe Outagamies or Foxes were at this time located at the Little Butte des Morts, on the western bank of Fox river, and some thirty-seven, miles above Green Bay. Here they made it a point, whenever a trader's boat approached, to place a torch upon the bank, as a signal for the traders to come ashore, and pay the customary tribute which they exacted from all. To refuse this tribute, was sure to incur the displeasure of the Foxes, and robbery would be the mildest punishment inflicted. This haughty, imperious conduct of the Foxes, was a source of no little annoyance to the traders, who made their complaints to the Commandants of the Western posts, and in due time these grievances reached the ears of the Governor of Canada.\n\nCaptain De Velie was at this time Commandant of the small garrison at Green Bay. He was relieved by the arrival of a new officer whose name I have forgotten, and the new\n\n205\n\nCommandant brought with him demands for the Sauks of the village opposite the fort, who had hitherto demeaned themselves well, to deliver up the few Foxes living among them, in consequence of intermarriages or otherwise. All were readily given up, except a Fox boy, who had been adopted by a Sauk woman. De Velie and his successor were dining together, and becoming somewhat influenced by wine, some sharp words passed between them relative to the tardiness of the Sauks in surrendering the Fox boy; when De Velie arose, and taking his gun and a negro servant, crossed the river to the Sauk village, which was surrounded with palisades or pickets. He found the Sauks in council, and was met by the Sauk chief, of whom he demanded the immediate surrender of the remaining Indian. The chief said he and his principal men had just been in council about the matter, and though the adopted mother of the youth was loth to part with him, yet they hoped to prevail upon her peaceably to do so. The chief proceeded to visit the old woman, who still remained obstinate, and De Velie renewing his demands and immediate compliance, again would the chief renew his efforts; and thus three times did he go to the sturdy old woman, and endeavor to prevail upon her to give up the boy, and returning each time without success, but assuring De Velie that if he would be a little patient, he was certain the old squaw would yet comply with his demands, as she seemed to be relenting. But in his warm blood, the Frenchman was in no mood to exercise patience, when he at length drew up his gun and shot the chief dead. Some of the young Sauks were for taking instant revenge, but the older and wiser men present begged them to be cool, and refrain from inflicting injury on their French Father, as they had provoked him to commit the act. By this time De Velie, whose anger was yet unappeased, had got his gun re-loaded by his servant, and wantonly shot down another chief, and then a third one; when a young Sauk, only twelve years of age, named Ma-kau-ta-pe-na-se,\n\n206\n\nor The Black Bird, shot the enraged Frenchman dead.\n\nThe garrison was too weak to attempt the chastisement of the Banks, but upon the arrival of a reinforcement joined by the French settlers, Charles De Langlade among them, the Sauks were attacked at their village, when a severe battle occurred, in which several were killed on both sides, and the Sauks finally driven away. In this Sauk battle, two of my father's uncles were among the slain on the part of the French. The Sauks now retired to the Wisconsin river and located themselves at Sauk Prairie, where they still resided, and had a, fine village, with comfortable houses, and apparently doing something in mining lead, when Carver visited the country in 1766, but which appeared to have been several years deserted when I first saw the place, in 1795, as there were then only a few remains of fire-places and posts to be seen. The brave young Sauk, Black Bird, became a distinguished chief among his people, and Mr. Laurent Fily, an old trader, told me many years since, that he knew Black Bird well at the Sauk village at the mouth of Rock river, and that he lived to a good old age — and Fily added, that he was the same person who in his youth had so fearlessly shot De Velie.\n\nCapt. Morand, a native of France, and a prominent trader among the Sauks, and the Indians on the Mississippi, had a place of deposit on the bank of the Mississippi, I think on the eastern bank of the river, and about eight or nine miles below the mouth of the Wisconsin, called Fort Morand. He had another depot, nine miles west of Mackinaw, also known as Fort Morand. The repeated exactions of the Foxes in the shape of tribute, while prosecuting his trade between Mackinaw and the Mississippi, through Green Bay and Fox river, so vexed Morand, that he resolved on driving them from their position; and raising a small volunteer force at Mackinaw, increased doubtless at Green Bay, and by the friendly Indians,\n\n207\n\nand though I have heard my grandfather repeatedly speak of this expedition both with others in whose day it had occurred, and to his family, yet I cannot positively say that he accompanied Morand — but judging from his military character, the numerous services of the kind in which he participated, and his familiarity with the details of this war, I doubt not he was of the party, and served in all of Morand's expeditions.\n\nMorand's force was deemed sufficient, and his fleet of canoes started from Green Bay up the river — each canoe having a full complement of men, well armed, and an oil-cloth covering large enough to envelop the whole canoe, as was used by the traders to shield their goods from the effects of the weather. Near the Grand Chute, some three miles below the Little Butte de Morts, and not yet within view of the latter, Morand divided his party, one part dis-embarking, and going by land to surround the village, and attack the place when Morand and his water division should open their fire in front. The soldiers in the canoes, with their guns all ready for use, were concealed by the oil-cloth coverings, and only two men were in view to row each canoe, thus presenting the appearance of a trader's fleet.\n\nIn due time the Foxes discovered their approach, and placed out their torch, and squatted themselves thickly along the bank as usual, and patiently awaited the landing of the canoes, and the customary tribute offering. When sufficiently near to be effective, the oil-cloth coverings, were suddenly thrown off, and a deadly volley from a swivel-gun, loaded with grape and canister shot, and the musketry of the soldiers, scattered death and dismay among the unsuspecting Foxes; and this severe fire was almost instantly seconded by the land party in the rear, and quickly repeated by both divisions, so that a large number of the devoted Foxes were slain, and the survivors escaped by rapid flight up the river. As there is a mound here, some six or eight rods in diameter,\n\n208\n\nand perhaps some fifteen feet high, this may be the burial-place of the Foxes slain in the battle, though I never heard any thing stated to that effect.\n\nThe Foxes next took post about three males above the Great Butte des Morts, on the southern or opposite bank of the river, on a high sandy point of land, with a marsh on its eastern border. Here Morand the same season followed them, but of course could not have resorted to his old ruse, and must have approached the town in the night or just before day-break; at all events, according to the general statement given me by my grandfather and aged Indians, another severe battle ensued, and many Foxes were killed, though not so many as at the Little Butte des Morts, and again they were forced to fly. The Indians always spoke of this place as the locality where Morand's second battle with the Foxes took place; and is the spot where Robert Grignon has for the past ten or twelve years resided. My half brother, Perrish Grignon, informed me, that he had seen many years ago, in a crevice or cavity on the rocky shore of Lake Winnebago, some six or eight miles south of Oshkosh, near the old Indian village of Black Wolf, a large number of skulls and other human remains; and I have thought, that perhaps when the Foxes fled from the Little Butte des Morts, they may have passed around the head of Lake Winnebago; and thinking themselves safe from, pursuit, tarried at this point, and gave attention to their wounded, and that the remains of those who died were placed in this cavity. I know of no other explanation for these human remains.\n\nThe surviving Foxes located themselves on the northern bank of the Wisconsin, twenty-one miles above its mouth, and some little distance below the creek next below the mouth of Kickapoo river; when I first passed there, in 1795, I saw some crude remains of this village. As soon as the enterprising Morand heard of the new locality of his determined enemies, who still seemed bent on obstructing his great\n\n209\n\ntrading thorough-fare, he concluded it would be unsafe for him to suffer them to remain there, and consequently lost no time, even though winter had commenced, to collect his tried and trusty band of French and Indians, and make a distant winter expedition against the Foxes. Perhaps he thought, as he had once defeated them by stratagem, and then by the usual mode of Indian warfare, that it would now be policy to push his fortunes by a winter campaign, and fall upon his inveterate foes, and strike a fatal blow, when they would least expect it. Capt. Morand pursued on foot with his troops up Fox River and down the Wisconsin, taking with them snow shoes to meet the exigencies of the season, and pursue their tedious march over the snow for a distance of fully two hundred miles. The Foxes were taken completely by surprise, for Morand's men found them engaged in the amusement of jeu de paille, or game of straw; and surrounding the place, and falling suddenly upon them, killed some, and captured the others. So well planned was Morand's attack, and so complete was the surprise, that not one of the Foxes escaped. Only twenty Fox warriors were taken, with a large number of women and children.\n\nIt must have been on the return of this winter expedition of Capt. Morand's, that the following incident occurred, as related by Capt. Carver, on the authority of an Indian: \"On the return of the French,\" says Carver, \"to Green Bay, one of the Indian chiefs in alliance with them, who had a considerable band of the prisoners under his care, stopped to drink at a brook; in the meantime his companions went on, which being observed by one of the women whom they had made captive, she suddenly seized him with both her hands, while he stooped to drink, by an exquisitely susceptible part, and held him fast till he expired on the spot. As the chief, from the extreme torture he suffered, was unable to call out to his friends, or give any alarm, they passed on, without knowing what had happened; and the woman, having cut\n\n210\n\nthe bands of those of her fellow-prisoners who were in the rear, with them made her escape. This heroine was ever after treated by her nation as their deliverer, and made a chieftess in her own right, with liberty to entail the same honor on her descendants — an unusual distinction, and permitted only on extraordinary occasions.\"\n\nI had been, told that Capt. Morand, having fully conquered the Foxes, and having the last remnant of them in his power, concluded to give them their freedom, but probably required them to retire over, the Mississippi; and that he liberated them at their town where he took them. But from the anecdote preserved by Capt. Carver, and several particulars mentioned by him of Morand's expedition, so well corresponding with the traditionary account I have derived from my grandfather and others, I must conclude that only a part — probably the larger part — of the prisoners were liberated at the place where they were captured; while some friendly chief may have claimed a few to carry back, of whom to make slaves. And it may further be added, that as it was now in winter, and Morand very likely but illy provided with supplies, it would not probably have been practicable to have conveyed all the prisoners so long a distance to Green Bay. And in concluding my reminiscences of this war with the Foxes, I must say, that this tribe appears to me to have shown more warlike spirit and love of martial glory than any other of the Wisconsin tribes; they would, when necessitated to do so, make peace one day, and unhesitatingly break it the next.\n\nOf Captain Morand, I know nothing further. The trader of that name among the Wisconsin Indians, mentioned in Gorrell's Journal, of 1763, in the First Vol. of the Historical Society's Collections, and who was then living, and at the\n\n211\n\nhead of an extensive company of traders, was doubtless the same person who, as a trader, had been so severely taxed in the way of tribute by the Foxes, and whom he had so completely humbled and driven from the country. Now that the field was clear, and he had established a high reputation among the savages for great bravery and enterprise, how natural he should vigorously prosecute his plans of commerce, as we see he was doing in 1763, seventeen years after the final expulsion of the Sauks and Foxes from Wisconsin. My old friend, Mr. Fily, many years ago told me that he had become acquainted with the wife of the celebrated chief Ke-o-kuk and her mother, and that the latter was the daughter, by a Sauk mother, of the same Capt. Morand who had led the early expeditious against the Foxes. But within the next twenty years after 1763, he must have paid the debt of nature, or retired from the Indian trade, or I should have seen or known something more of him.\n\nCapt. Morand's severe chastisement of the Foxes, had the effect to keep the Wisconsin tribes on friendly terms with the whites for many years. Meanwhile the little settlement at Green Bay appears to have increased very slowly, and the little garrison to have been withdrawn at some period after the termination of the Sauk and Fox war, and prior to the commencement of the old French and Indian war of 1754. Augustin De Langlade continued in the Indian trade, and Charles De Langlade as Indian agent, and no event of importance occurred to them, or their little settlement, at this period.\n\nWe do not discover that the progress or result of that long contest, known as the French and Indian war, had any special influence for weal or woe upon the Green Bay settlement, as it was too remote to feel any sensible effects from the operations of the combatants. But it opened a new field for the enterprising spirit of Charles De Langlade. At the breaking out of this war, he was but thirty years of age, in the\n\n212\n\nprime of life, and full of vigor and activity. He had been raised on the extreme frontiers, and though half Indian, yet his educational advantages had been fair; and he had been for many years employed by the Government in the Indian Department. Thus he combined the skill and strategy of the borderer and Indian, and had had much experience in Indian warfare from the tender age of ten, when he accompanied his uncle, King Nis-so-wa-quet, on a war expedition; though unfortunately the details are lost in the long lapse of years, and the general character only, as both numerous and full of intrepidity, are left indelibly impressed upon my memory. I know that while yet a mere youth, and not very far from the time when he first went upon the war-path under Nis-so-wa-quet, his father purchased for him a commission in the French marine, and though he retained this commission many years, I have no evidence or tradition that he was ever actually engaged in the naval service.\n\nSuch was the high standing and reputation of the Sieur Charles De Langlade, his long experience in border service, his personal relationship to the powerful Ottawas, his thorough knowledge of their language and that of the other neighboring tribes, and his great influence over them, that he was at once pointed out to Vaudreuil, the Governor-General of New France and Louisiana, as admirably fitted to head the partisan forces of border French and Indians of the North-West, in the terrible conflict about to commence.\n\nThe first service I remember of my grandfather's in this war, was to raise the tribes of the North-West, I think the Ottawas, Chippewas, Menomonees, Winnebagoes, Pottawottamies, Hurons or Wyandotts, and perhaps others, and repair with their chiefs, to Fort du Quesne, for its defence against the English, and also to carry the war against the frontier settlements and forts of the British Colonies. This was in 1755. What particular chiefs were along, I do not remember hearing my grandfather state, but I doubt not that La Fourche\n\n213\n\nor Nis-so-wa-quet and Pontiac were of the number; nor do I know how large a band my grandfather led from, the North-West; but I remember his saying, that when they assembled at Fort Du Quesne, the total number of French and their Indian allies amounted to not far from fifteen hundred; and my strong impression is, that nearly all the Indian force was composed of the bands led forth by my grandfather, the Sieur Charles De Langlade. Among his party, who served under him on this and most of his subsequent campaigns during the war, were his brother-in-law Souligny, his brave nephew Gautier De Verville, Pierre Caree, La Choisie, La Fortune, Amable, De Gere, Philip De Rocheblave, Louis Hamline, and Machar. The latter was my father's uncle, and the grandfather of the present Mrs. Rosalie Dousman, of Lake Shawanaw.\n\nUpon their arrival at Fort Du Quesne, spies were sent out to discover the enemy's approach, and they soon returned, reporting that Braddock's army was within a half a day's march of the Monongahela, cutting a road as they advanced. It was determined that M. Beaujeu, with what French could be spared, and the Indian force under De Langlade, should go out and meet the enemy at the Monongahela, and attack them while crossing that stream. The English got to the south bank of the Monongahela about noon, halted and prepared for dinner; while the French and Indians were secreted on the other shore. De Langlade went to Beaujeu and told him no time should be lost, but that the attack should be at once commenced. Beaujeu, made no reply. De Langlade then called the chiefs together, and desired them to go to Beaujeu, and demand orders to commence the battle. No reply was made to this demand. Then De Langlade went himself, and urged the necessity of at once attacking the English, saying to Beaujeu, that if he did not intend to fight at all, then it was well to act as he did, but if fighting was to be done, then was the time to do it, while the English were eating,\n\n214\n\ntheir army laid aside, or while attempting to cross the river; that no other so good an opportunity could occur, and that the English were too powerful to be met in open battle. Beaujeu was evidently disheartened, seeing the strength of the English, and seemed in great doubt what to do, but at length gave orders to commence the attack. The action was at once commenced, and the English officers, who had their little towels pinned over their breasts, seized their arms and took part in the conflict; and a good many of them were killed with these napkins still pinned on their coats — showing how suddenly they rushed into the battle. The English occupying the lowest ground, almost invariably over-shot the French, and their cannon balls would strike the trees half way up, among the branches. In the battle, Beaujeu was killed, but the French and Indian loss was very small; and the most who were killed and injured, were not hit by the bullets of the enemy, but by the falling limbs cut from the trees by the over-shooting of the English cannon.\n\nThe English being defeated, and driven back with heavy loss, the first thing to claim De Langlade's attention was, to cause the immense stores and supplies which the English had abandoned, to be searched, and all the liquors poured upon the ground, lest the Indians should indulge so freely in potations as to render them dangerous to the French and to each other. While the Indians looked with sorrow upon this apparent waste of what, in their estimation, is generally regarded as the greatest of worldly comforts, they did not venture to interfere with any directions of their venerated leader. They found enough of excitement, however, at the time, in searching and stripping the bodies of the slain. Most of the British officers were superbly clothed, this being their first campaign since their arrival from Great Britain, and their clothing and equipage were objects of interest and value to the Indians. Nor were the Indians alone engaged in securing the plunder, for the French, or many of them, were also\n\n215\n\neagerly employed in this manner. La Choisie, a young man of De Langlade's party, of much enterprise and promise, discovered the body of an English officer, richly dressed, and Philip De Rocheblave, almost at the same moment, claimed to have discovered it, but La Choisie managed first to get hold of the well-filled purse. Rocheblave stoutly contended for a part of the prize, and they parted in no friendly way. The next morning La Choisie was found assassinated, and his purse of gold missing; and while there was no evidence of De Rocheblave's guilt, he was strongly suspected of the crime. I know nothing further of Philip De Rocheblave, but personally knew two of his nephews, Pierre and Noel De Rocheblave, both engaged in the Indian trade, and Pierre became first a clerk and then a member of the N. W. Fur Company.\n\nAfter Braddock's repulse, I do not know whether my grandfather returned home, or remained at Fort du Quesne to engage in the partisan service. We find Dumas, the Commandant of Du Quesne, giving him orders, on the 9th of August, 1756, to go with a party of French and Indians and make a strike at Fort Cumberland, and make discoveries whether the English were making any movements in the direction of the Ohio; to guard strictly against being surprised or ambuscaded; and if the Indians should take any prisoners, to use his best efforts to prevent their torturing them.\n\nOf De Langlade's partisan services, while at Fort du Quesue, I can only mention one incident which he narrated to me. The Commandant gave him orders to take a party of French and Indians, and go to a certain part of the frontiers, and endeavor to capture a prisoner, from whom to gain information. Reaching a frontier fort, which must have been in Pennsylvania, Maryland, or Virginia, he managed to seize a sentinel in the night; and from him learned that an officer or paymaster\n\n216\n\nwas expected to arrive at that fort at a certain time with a large supply of money for public purposes. So De Langlade took a proper number with him, and among them a French officer who had a little dog along, and they ambuscaded the road upon which the expected prize was to pass. It was good sleighing in winter. At length the small English foot guard preceding the sleigh passed the ambuscade, and soon the sleigh passed by De Langlade who rushed out in the rear of the sleigh, when the French officer was to head the team, but his dog gave the alarm a little too soon, when the English officer suspecting some trap set for him, instantly turned his horses about and commenced retracing his trail, when De Langlade dashed behind, seized hold of the back part of the sleigh; but the officer within, used his whip freely upon his horses, and at the same time drew his pistol, when De Langlade snatched it before he could use it, and then the Englishman used his whip so nimbly and alternately upon his horses and upon De Langlade, that the latter finally gave up any further attempt, and thus lost the much coveted prize. The pistol was his only trophy. To the premature barking of the little dog, he attributed the miscarriage of his scheme; and he used to repeat, with great pleasantry, the incident of his whipping and the exciting race. The English foot-guard were captured. My grandfather, after the war, frequently met this English officer in Canada, and they would rehearse the exploit with much good feeling.\n\nThe year 1757, M. De Langlade was employed in Canada, and served under Montcalm in the capture of Fort William Henry at the head of Lake George. At the close of the campaign, he received the following order:\n\n\"PIERRE RIGAUD DE VAUDREUIL, Governor and Lieutenant-General for the King of all the Country of New France and Louisiana: — \"We order the Sieur Langlade, Ensign of the Troops, detached from the Marine, to start from this city immediately for the post of Michillimackinac, there to serve in the capacity of second in command under the orders of M. De Beaujeu, Commandant at that post.\n\n\"Done at Montreal, Sept. 8th, 1767. VAUDREUIL.\"\n\n217\n\nDe Langlade, the following year, again wended his way to Canada, at the head of his French and Indian force, and shared the dangers and services of that hard campaign. He was among the troops stationed in Fort Ticonderoga — located on a hill, from the top of which down its sides they felled the trees, with the tops downwards, with the ends of the limbs sharpened so as to obstruct the approach of an enemy. When the British under Gen. Abercrombie came, and undertook to drive the French, they failed after much very severe fighting. He took part also in saving Crown Point from falling into the hands of the English. There is reason to believe, from what my grandfather told me, that after the hard service of beating back the English at Ticonderoga, he repaired with his trusty band to Fort du Quesne, which was then threatened by the enemy. If there, he must have had a hand in defeating Col. Grant; and he spoke of the French being too weak to withstand the well-appointed troops coming against them, and therefore set fire to the fort, and retired in canoes and batteaux, down the Ohio — my grandfather probably returning home, as it was then late in the autumn.\n\nI have no distinct recollection about my grandfather being at Fort Niagara in 1759, but presume he was, as he served on every campaign; and I dare say he took part with his French and Indian force in the fighting, that transpired a little distance above the fort; and when there was no longer a prospect of usefulness, retired with his Indians from the fated place.\n\nI know full well that he participated in the great battle before Quebec, on the Plains of Abraham, when his great commander, Montcalm, was killed. I have heard him speak of the battle, as well as Amable De Gere and some aged Menomonees who served under him, there — among them Globe, son of old Carron, O-sau-wish-ke-no, or The Yellow Bird,\n\n218\n\nKa-cha-ka-wa-she-ka, or The Notch-Maker; the old Chief, Carron, was also there, but I never saw him, as he died before my recollection.\n\nDe Gere used to say, that he never saw so perfectly cool and fearless a man on the field of battle as my grandfather; and that either here, at Monongahela, or at Ticonderoga, I have forgotten which, he saw my grandfather, when his gun barrel had got so hot, from repeated and rapid discharges, that he took occasion to stop a little while that it might cool, when he would draw his pipe from his pouch, cut his tobacco, fill his pipe, take a piece of punk-wood, and strike fire with his steel and flint, and light and smoke his pipe, and all with as much sang froid as at his own fireside; and having cooled his gun and refreshed himself, would resume his place, and play well his part in the battle. He mourned the loss of his two brothers, who fell in this desperate conflict. The engagement over, and the surviving French commander resolving to surrender Quebec, De Langlade was among the number who thought there was yet no real necessity for such a measure, and believing it was effected through bribery, retired from, the place with his chosen followers in disgust.\n\nDuring this year, 1759, and probably in the autumn, my grandfather De Langlade was united in marriage to Miss Charlotte Bourassa, a daughter of Laurent Bourassa, a prominent merchant of Montreal. He had probably become acquainted with this lady either on some visits to Montreal, to purchase goods for the Indian Department, or when stationed there while in the service. He took her immediately to his home at Green Bay. She knew nothing of border life, and had a mortal fear of the Indians. On one occasion, some mischief-maker circulated a report that the Indians were coming there with evil designs, when she ran to the next house and told the alarming news, and then hid herself under a board-pile, where she was found, not by the Indians, for none came, but by her friends, snugly stowed away, almost\n\n219\n\nhalf demented with fear. At another time, seeing a number of Menomonee Indians come into the store and house, which were adjoining, and had a connecting door, my grandmother fled to her room, and fastened the door; but her curiosity prompted her to open the door ajar, and peep out, when she discovered all the Indians seated around the room, except one, Pack-kau-sha, who, having no seat, was standing up near her door. She at once concluded he was watching his chance to destroy her, and in her frenzy, without knowing what she was doing, snatched a dull round-bladed case-knife, dashed open the door, and seized the Indian by the collar, and making an effort to stab him, exclaimed, \"Pack-kau-sha, you rogue, you are a dead man!\" The Indians at once discovered that she was greatly excited with fear, and all united in hearty laughter and strong assurances of friendship. Her good husband would quietly say, \"What are you doing, my wife? Go back to your room, and don't disturb us here.\" When she would see a canoe of Indians coming, she would open the door, and exclaim in the most forlorn manner — \"They are coming! they are coming! Now we shall be massacred!\" It was some time before she got the better of her foolish whims and fears about the Indians.\n\nEarly the next year, 1760, Charles De Langlade again repaired to Canada, and found a commission of Lieutenant awaiting him, from the King of France, dated the 1st of February of that year, which evinced in a high degree the confidence of his King and Government. But while he served during the war under commissions of Ensign and Lieutenant, he appears to have held commands quite equal to that of Captain. This year's service must have been very severe and trying, demanding unusual care and anxiety to oppose a much superior force. When all hope of much longer being able to maintain possession of Canada had ceased, Gov. Vaudreuil gave specific directions to Charles De Langlade, at Montreal, on the 3rd of September, 1760, to take charge of\n\n220\n\nand conduct the troops under his command to Mackinaw, and the Indians to their villages, and to see that the latter should not plunder nor insult the voyageurs they might meet by the way; and that if the fortune of war should place the Colony in possession of the British, that peace might soon be hoped to follow; and also directing him to take charge of two companies of English deserters, and send them forward to Louisiana — where, we may infer, they would be beyond the reach of the English, into whose hands all New France would soon fall.\n\nSix days after the date of these instructions, Vaudreuil sent a despatch to Charles De Langlade, notifying him, that in consequence of the great diminution of his troops, and the exhaustion of his means and resources, he had been compelled to surrender all Canada to the British, under Gen. Amherst; that Gen. Amherst came in view of that city on the 6th, three days after he, De Langlade, had taken his departure; that the conditions of the capitulation are advantageous to the colony, and particularly to the inhabitants of Michillimakinac, who have liberty to enjoy their religion, remain in possession of their real and personal property, and their peltries, and to enjoy the privileges of trade the same as the proper subjects of Great Britain; that the same conditions are granted to the military, who may designate some one in their absence to act for them in their behalf, and both the military and citizens in general may sell to the English or French their property, or send it abroad to France or elsewhere, if they see proper to do so; they may keep their negro and Pawnee slaves, but must surrender all those taken from the English; that the English General has declared, that the Canadians becoming subject to His Britannic Majesty, shall not be denied the privileges of the Coutume de Paris, the old French code long in force; the troops are not to serve during the present war, and are to give up their arms before returning to France; that you will assemble all the officers and soldiers at your post, and make them\n\n221\n\nlay down their arms, and will accompany them to such seaport as may be most convenient for their departure for France; that the citizens and inhabitants of Michillimakinac will consequently be under the command of the officer whom Gen. Amherst may order to that post; that you will send a copy of my letter to St. Joseph, and to the posts of that region, presuming that there may be some soldiers there, that they and the inhabitants may conform to it; and I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you, in France with all your friends.\n\nThus ended the long contest between France and Great Britain for American dominion and supremacy. None could have felt more keenly the downfall of France, and the transfer of the government of New France to the British, than did Charles De Langlade. Raised on the frontiers, and having spent his life in the wilderness, he was fond of the unrestrained freedom he enjoyed in common with his border countrymen, and he and they probably dreaded more a change of laws and customs than of rulers; but in this, their fears were groundless, for their conquerors proved quite as lenient and paternal in their government as had the French before them. At this day, we can scarcely realize the hardships attendant on such a partisan service as that in which De Langlade was engaged, with such long and constant marches of thousands of miles through a wilderness country, relying mainly upon wild game for a sustenance. I remember he told me, that on one occasion, when he and his party were nearly starved, they discovered some live rattlesnakes, and by means of forked sticks placed on their necks, severed their heads from their bodies, dressed the meat and made a most savory meal.\n\nI think I may in truth say, that in all this protracted war — a war emphatically of herculean efforts on both sides, for the\n\n222\n\nprize at stake was immense, — no officer in the French service could have traveled so many miles, suffered so many privations and hardships, or taken part in so many services and conflicts, as my grandfather, the Sieur Charles De Langlade. Had the French been successful, his name and fame would doubtless have been better known to history; but the departure of the French leaders, immediately after the war, to their native land, and the natural dislike of the discomfitted party to publish accounts of their deeds and services, however meritorious, together with the far-off and secluded region where De Langlade resided, and the change of Government in his country, must all have contributed to the silence of history in failing to proclaim his distinguished merits and services. I cannot but believe, that Vaudreuil, Montcalm, Dumas, De Beaujeu, and other French leaders, made full reports of my grandfather's arduous and persistent services to the King and Government, for the King must have been made fully aware of his services, or he would not have sent him a commission; and this prompts me to express the hope, that the Legislature of Wisconsin, as other States have wisely done, will, at an early day, authorize the procurement from the archives of both France and Great Britain, a faithful transcript of all documents, not only relating to my grandfather, but to the early expeditions of De Louvigny, De Lignery, and Morand, and all that is preserved of the French and English regime in Wisconsin. They should be procured, and published in the volumes of the Historical Society's Collections.\n\nI do not remember to have heard any thing of the Green Bay land grant of an extensive territory, with the exclusive right of the Indian trade, made by Gov. Vaudreuil, in October, 1759, to Rigaud Vaudreuil and wife, and confirmed by the French King, in January, 1760, at a critical period, just before the subjugation of Canada by the British, and which was in 1766, transferred to William Grant. If any knowledge of it came to the ears of the settlers here at that period, it must\n\n223\n\nhave made them not a little uneasy, and its early rejection had so quieted the matter, that nothing was said of it in my early day.\n\nWhen Mackinaw passed into the possession of the British, Capt. George Etherington, its Commandant, sent word to the principal French settlers of the neighboring settlements dependent upon that post, to report themselves in person at Mackinaw, probably to take the oath of allegiance to the British Government, and advise with reference to the proper persons in their respective settlements to fill the local offices under the new order of things. This was all very proper, and was not only designed to make the British Commandant better acquainted with the condition of things, within the sphere of his command, but was most likely designed to give him an opportunity of assuring the French people of the solicitude of the British Government to consult their wants and feelings, and promote their interests and prosperity. This was both wise and politic on the part of the British authorities, and had a happy effect in winning the affection and confidence of their new subjects. Among those who repaired to Mackinaw, in obedience to this invitation, were the Sieur Augustin and the Sieur Charles De Langlade. They took their families with them, and probably took that occasion to convey to Mackinaw, to exchange for goods for the Indian trade, whatever furs and peltries they had gathered in barter, for they had several Indian servants with them, probably as boatmen and voyageurs. The visit to Capt. Etherington was pleasant, and it may be safely presumed that the British captain took special pains to ingratiate himself into the good graces of so prominent men among both the French and Indians as the De Langlades; and either at this time, or not very long after, Charles De Langlade was re-appointed to superintend the Indians of the Green Bay Department, and re-instated in his\n\n224\n\ncommand of the militia. The following permission to return and reside at Green Bay, is among the very few papers of my grandfather now preserved:\n\n\"MICHILLIMAKINAC, April 13, 1763.\n\n\"I have this date given permission to Messrs. Langlade, father and son, to live at the Post of La Baye, and do hereby order that no person may Interrupt them in their voyage thither with their wives, children, servants and baggage.\n\nGEO. ETHERINGTON, Commandant.\"\n\nWe soon find Charles De Langlade back at Mackinaw, I suppose to purchase goods for his father, or for the Indian Department, and perhaps had to wait there awhile for the arrival of such goods from Montreal. A part of the Ottawas and Chippewas had espoused the cause of Pontiac, and formed the design of surprising the garrison, while the others were opposed to this new attempt to embroil the Indian tribes in difficulties with the English. De Langlade learned the condition of things from his Indian friends who were not a party to the scheme, and went to Capt. Etherington and told him of the designs against the fort. Etherington would then summon before him Match-i-ku-is, and other leading Ottawa chiefs implicated in the plot, when they would stoutly deny it; thereupon Etherington would dismiss both the Indians and their suspicions. Again and again would De Langlade warn him, and with the same result. Finally he went once more, and repeated his firm convictions of the threatened misfortunes; when Etherington replied, \"Mr. De Langlade, I am weary of hearing the stories you so often bring me; they are the foolish twaddle of old women, and unworthy of belief; the Indians have nothing against the English, and cherish no evil designs; I hope, therefore, that you will not trouble me with any more such stuff.\"\n\n225\n\n\"Capt. Etherington,\" said De Langlade, \"I will not trouble you with any more of these old women's stories, as you call them, but I beg you will remember my faithful warnings.\" Etherington was obstinate — the ball-play was had on the Queen's birth-day — he was a spectator — the ball was every now and then purposely knocked over the picketing into the fort, and thrown back to them by the garrison, when at length Etherington ordered the gate to be opened so the Indians could get it themselves. The next time they knocked the ball into the fort, they all rushed in, and commenced to massacre. It was quick work, and soon over; and though M. De Langlade was there, he had no time nor opportunity to be of any service.\n\nCapt. Etherington and Lieut. Leslie, who were among the survivors, and now in the hands of the Indians, came near being burned at the stake; the wood was all ready, and the prisoners pinioned, and the torch would soon have been applied, when M. De Langlade arrived with a party of friendly Indians, and he at once stepped up to the prisoners and cut the cords from their arms, and then, in a firm, determined manner, told the hostile Indians, \"If you are not pleased with what I have done, I am ready to meet you;\" but none came forward; they saw too plainly that he and his friends were well prepared to fight, and they knew that Charles De Langlade was a stranger to fear. Now that he had saved Etherington and Leslie from the stake, he turned to the former and said, \"Now, Capt. Etherington, if you had listened to the old women's stories, of which I timely warned you, you would not now be in your present humiliating situation, with your men nearly all slain.\" The surviving officers and soldiers were sent, under an escort of friendly Indians, to Montreal.\n\nPontiac's plan of surprising all the British posts in the West, included Green Bay; and the capturing of this fort was confided to the mixed band at Milwaukee, composed mostly\n\n226\n\nof Pottawottamies and Ottawas, with some Chippewas and Menomonees. The Menomonee nation were friendly to the English, and their head chief at this time was Cha-kau-cho-ka-ma, or The Old King, and his speaker was the half-breed, Carron, son of the early French trader who joined the Langlades soon after their first settlement at Green Bay. It appears by Gorrel's Journal, that Carron at this time was much thought of by both the French and English. His oldest son Glode, when a mere youth, had shared in the battle of Quebec, under the banner of Charles De Langlade. Carron had married a sister of Wau-pe-se-pin, or The Wild Potatoe, a prominent Menomonee, who visiting Milwaukee, was inveigled into taking part with them in the Pontiac scheme, and was persuaded to bear a red wampum belt to his nation, inviting them to assist in taking the fort. At my father, Pierre Grignon's, then residing at Green Bay, Wau-pe-se-pin was met by Old Garron, who, addressing him, said: \"I know the object of your visit, and the purport of Pontiac's message; I want no such message as that, as I mean to do no wrong to my British friends. Is it possible that you, too, are leagued with the Milwaukee band? Go back, then, to your home among them, and let me see your face no more!\" Failing to influence his brother-in-law Carron, Wau-pe-se-pin gave up his mission as hopeless, and retired to his cabin, instead of re-tracing his steps to Milwaukee. While Carron and his faithful Menomonees were on the alert, strictly watching lest the Milwaukee band might attempt some mischief, which, however, they did not dare attempt, at length Lieut. Gorrell, the Commandant of the fort, receiving instructions to abandon the post, left Green Bay, guarded to Mackinaw by Carron\n\n227\n\nand a party of Menomonees; and for his faithful adherence to the English, and rejection of the counsels of Pontiac, Carron was subsequently presented with a large silver medal by the British authorities, with a certificate of his chieftainship and good services. The tradition mentioned by Judge Lock-wood, in the 2nd volume of the Society's Collections, relative to the abandonment of Green Bay, is without foundation. Tomah, the son of Old Carron, instead of then being at the head of the Menomonees, was a mere child; and nothing transpired, as the tradition represents, that could be construed into the Menomonees disarming, or attempting to disarm, any part of Gorrell's party. It may here be stated, that no more British troops were sent to garrison Green Bay.\n\nPontiac, who was the prime-mover of these troubles at Mackinaw, Green Bay and elsewhere, was always represented to me as a chief of the Hurons, not of the Ottawas, and my grandfather, who knew him personally, spoke of him as an Indian of great intelligence and shrewdness; but I remember nothing further of his history, character or family. Of old Carron's services, I know nothing further with any certainty, though I think he must have served during nearly all the old French and Indian wars under my grandfather, as he was invariably spoken of as being always ready. He died at the old Menomonee village, a short distance above Fort Howard, called the Old King's Village, about the year 1780, about sixty years of age. By his wife, he had seven children, Glode, Tomah, She-qua-ne-ne, I-om-e-tah, and three daughters; I-om-e-tah, a chief, born about 1772, and his younger sister, are yet living at Lake Shawanaw. Old Carron had two children each by two other women — one of them, a Sauk woman, with whom he became acquainted while on a war expedition against the Osages or Pawnees. He was regarded as the handsomest man among the Menomonees; I remember seeing his aged widow at the Bay when I was twelve or fifteen years of age. Of Wau-pe-se-pin, or The Wild Potatoe,\n\n228\n\nwho endeavored to embroil the Menomonees in Pontiac's war, I can say I knew him well; he was no chief, and there was nothing in his career worthy of special note. He died at the Big Kau-kau-lin, about 1805.\n\nAfter the Pontiac war, Augustin De Langlade for several years continued in the Indian trade at Green Bay. My mother, who was born in 1763, related to me, that when she was about seven years of age, she was once in the store, when an Indian came in, and expressed a desire to purchase a small Indian axe, when her grandfather, Augustin De Langlade, handed out one from under the counter; when the Indian inquired if he had any more? M. De Langlade bent down to get some others, and as he arose, the Indian, in mere sport, made a motion as if to strike the old gentleman on the head with the first axe handed out, when my mother exclaimed, \"Grandpa, he is going to cut your neck!\" He arose quickly, and, with one of the small axes, knocked the Indian over. Picking himself up, the Indian apologized to M. De Langlade, that he only intended it for a joke. He was told in reply, that such things were too serious for rude sport, and there the matter ended. This is the latest, occurrence of which I have any knowledge, concerning the Sieur Augustin De Langlade, and hence infer that he died not very long after — say about 1771, at the age of about seventy-five years, and his remains were interred at the old cemetery at Green Bay. He has been represented to me as a very good man, quiet in his demeanor, hut quick to resent an injury. I have no personal knowledge of the Ottawa wife of Augustin De Langlade, and suppose after his death she may have returned to her Indian friends near Mackinaw; but on the 14th September, 1782, Lieut. Gov. Sinclair, of Mackinas, gives \"Madame Langlade permission to go to Green Bay, and enter into possession of her houses, gardens, farms and property, and to take a hired man with her.\" I presume she did not long survive the date of this\n\n229\n\npermission, as I was then over two years of age, and have no recollection of ever having seen her. But for this written permission of Gov. Sinclair's, I should have thought that my great grandmother had died before her husband, as I never remember to have heard my mother speak of her.\n\nUpon the breaking out of the Revolutionary war, Charles De Langlade, who was then fifty-two years old, was persuaded by Capt. De Peyster, commanding at Mackinaw, to take an active part in the war should his services be needed; and this, as De Peyster remarks in his Miscellanies, was equivalent to \"securing all the Western Indians in our interest.\" He was soon required to raise an Indian force, and repair to Canada for its defence, and with a large body of Sioux, Sauka, Foxes, Menomonees, Winnebagoes, Pottawottamies, Ottawas and Chippewas, he marched for Montreal. Upon their arrival there, a grand council was held, a large ox was roasted whole, and served up to the Indians at a war-feast; and when La Rock, the Sioux interpreter, failed to perform his duty, De Langlade supplied his place by having the Sioux render their speeches into the Chippewa tongue, which was pretty generally known among the Indians in the North-West, when he could render it from the Chippewa into French. While in Canada on this service, I remember he served under Gen. Campbell, but forget his particular services rendered. My recollection is, that as occasion required, he went to Canada with his Indian force several times during the war, but I can give no particulars. I presume he was there at the time Gov. Haldimand gave Cha-kau-cha-ka-ma, or The Old King, the great medal and certificate, the latter of which, dated Aug. 17th, 1778, has been deposited in the Cabinet of the Historical Society.\n\nAfter Col. George Rogers Clarke had conquered the Illinois country, the British Lieut. Gov. Hamilton, of Detroit, planned an expedition, in the winter of 1778-79, against Clarke; but, though so far successful as to re-possess Vincennes,\n\n230\n\nHamilton and his forces were suddenly attacked in turn by the gallant Clarke, and made prisoners of war. It had been Hamilton's plan, as the summer of 1779 should roll around, to re-conquer the rest of the Illinois country; but his hopes were suddenly blasted by the daring and gallantry of his wily antagonist. Without, however, knowing anything of Hamilton's misfortune, Capt. De Peyster called a grand council of the North-Western tribes to assemble at l'Arbre Croche, near Mackinaw, early in the summer, for the purpose of embodying an Indian force to make a diversion towards Fort Chartres, in favor of Gov. Hamilton.\n\nPierre Caree had been sent to Milwaukee to invite the Indians there to attend the grand council; and failing of success, Gautier De Verville, De Langlade's nephew, who had served with him during the old French war, and thus far in the Revolutionary contest, and was thoroughly acquainted with the Indians, next went; but he returned, reporting that he had met with no better success — that the Indians had laughed at him. Now De Langlade went, determined to induce them, to attend the council, and take up the hatchet on the side of the British. He talked with them awhile without any apparent favorable results, when he concluded to resort to his knowledge of Indian habits and customs. He built a lodge in the midst of the village, with a door at each end; had several dogs killed, and had the dog-feast prepared; then placed the raw heart of a dog on a stick at each door. Then the Indians partook of the feast, when De Langlade, singing the war song, and marching around within the lodge, as he passed one door he bent down and took a bite of the raw heart, and repeated the same ceremony as he passed the other — an appeal to Indian\n\n231\n\nbravery, that if they possessed brave hearts themselves, they would follow his example, and accompany him to war. They could not resist this ancient and superstitious custom; and so one after another joined in the war song and tasted the dogs' hearts, till all had become followers of De Langlade, and he led them; forth to the grand council at l'Arbre Croche. After the grand council was held, and brave speeches made, the Indian force, under De Langlade and De Verville, embarked upon Lake Michigan; and upon arriving at St. Joseph's, they learned of Hamilton's surrender, and returned much dissatisfied.\n\nMy grandfather, De Langlade, remained in service in the Indian Department till the end of the war; and he and his faithful companion and nephew, Gautier De Verville, both serving as captains. As there were no expeditions by the Americans against the North-West, there was no active service for them to perform.\n\nI will mention what little I know of an event at this period, but in which, however, my grandfather had no part. Jean Marie Ducharme, a trader from Montreal, had wended his way up the Missouri river with goods, and carried on a profitable trade with the Indians, but without license or permission of the Spanish, authorities at Pancore or St. Louis; and the consequence was, that as he descended the Missouri with his boat of furs and peltries, a band of Spaniards intercepted him; the most of his party, when they saw the Spaniards approaching, fled and left him, when he had only a young man whom he had raised, and a Pawnee Indian, remaining with him, who fired upon their assailants. They were too weak, however, to make any successful resistance, and finally fled, and though the Spaniards endeavored to take Ducharme, he eluded them and escaped. His goods were seized and confiscated, to the value of four or five thousand dollars.\n\n232\n\nMaking his way back to Mackinaw, with no very amiable feelings towards the Spaniards at Pancore, he soon managed to get up quite a large expedition, in the spring of 1780, for their chastisement. It appears to have been almost entirely, if not exclusively, a volunteer affair, yet my recollection is that my grandfather told me, that Lieut. Gov. Sinclair, of Mackinaw, gave it his countenance and encouragement The numbers engaged I do not remember, but it was pretty large, and they were mostly Indians. The bold Ottawa chief Match-i-ku-is had the chief command of the Indians, and was honored with the title of General. They came by the way of Green Bay, where they were joined by Po-e-go-na, or The Feather-Shedder, Mu-wa-sha, or The Little Wolf, Le Baron, and other noted Menomonee warriors, and some Winnebagoes. From Green Bay, they took the usual route up Fox river to the Wisconsin Portage, and thence down the Wisconsin and Mississippi. The expedition, however, accomplished but little; they killed a few innocent people around Pancore or St. Louis, and were foiled in their chief design, and returned dissatisfied. About the year 1788, I saw General Match-i-ku-is at Green Bay, who seemed to appreciate the importance of his title, for he wore a bright red British dress coat, with epaulettes, and cut quite a figure. He was then getting old, and was a tall, large-sized Indian. Young as I was, he attracted my attention, and my grandfather told me about him; and his Pancore expedition, otherwise I should not probably have known anything of it. My grandfather had a dislike towards General Match-i-ku-is, and remarked that he was unreliable and treacherous, brave and sanguinary, and probably had more special reference to his treacherous conduct at the surprise of Mackinaw in 1763. I may add, that I am quite confident that my grandfather did not accompany the Pancore expedition, nor do I think any whites at Green Bay joined it.\n\nI do not know much of Jean Marie Ducharme — never\n\n233\n\nhaving seen him; but he was many years engaged in the Indian trade, and finally retired to Lachine, near Montreal, his native region, where he had a fine property, and died there about 1800 to 1805. He had three sons in this country, Joseph, Dominick, and Paul — the former of whom, I remember, went to Lachine to settle his father's estate; and Paul Ducharme yet survives, at about eighty years of age. I have heard that, about 1782, Jean Marie Ducharme once left Mackinaw on a trading expedition, without obtaining the necessary written license or permission from Lieut. Gov. Sinclair, who, on his return, required him, for his disobedience, to provide fifteen hundred bundles of wild hay, weighing some fifteen pounds to the bundle, for the King's public supplies, and paid the penalty. About the same time, one St. Paul De La Croix, a trader, also departed on a trading voyage without permission, and, like Ducharme, was directed to pay the same penalty, for disobedience of a well-known order. But De La Croix, who was rather a hard case to manage, said that the King lived over the ocean, and he didn't believe he needed any hay; if he thought, he really stood in need of any, he would procure some for him; but as it was, he shouldn't get any. Sinclair could not, or did not, enforce the fine. I can only further say of Jean Marie Ducharme, that he had a brother Dominick Ducharme, and a cousin Laurent Ducharme, the latter of whom was at Mackinaw when surprised in 1763, and both were many years engaged in the Indian trade in the North-West.\n\n234\n\nIn or about 1782, Lieut. Gov. Sinclair gave to my grandfather a grant to all his lands at Green Bay, including his improvements and such prairies as he may have used for meadow, and wood lands used for wood, or sugar-making; this document I confided to Col. Isaac Lee, the U. S. Commissioner, in 1820, to examine into the land titles at Green Bay and Prairie du Chien, and he took it to Detroit with him, and dying soon after, I never was able to reclaim it.\n\nAfter the Revolutionary war, my grandfather, De Langlade, remained in his Indian agency at Green Bay, having the general superintendence of the Indians in this quarter, and also continued in command of the militia. It was an ancient custom among the Canadians, on the 1st of May in each year, to have a holiday, raise a flag-pole, and salute it with vollies of discharges, well blackening it over, and all these demonstrations were designed as complimentary to their militia, Commandant; and thus was Charles De Langlade most affectionately reverenced and honored by the simple-hearted people of the settlement.\n\nMr. De Langlade, by his marriage with Miss Bourassa,\n\n235\n\nhad two children, Lalotte, born in 1760 or 1761, who was married to one Barcellou, but, died the next year childless; and my mother Domitelle, born in 1763, who was united in marriage to my father, Pierre Grignon, Sr., in 1776, when she was thirteen years of age. My grandfather spent the remainder of his days at Green Bay, occasionally making a journey to Mackinaw or Toronto on public or private business, for he continued to attend to his Indian agency, and the command of the militia, as long as he Jived. He had a farm which was managed by my father, Pierre Grignon, Sr., and received an annuity of eight hundred dollars while he lived, as half-pay, from the British Government, for his services during the American Revolution, and he also received for those services a grant of 3,000 acres of land on the La Trenche river in Canada. He now felt the weight of years, and in January, 1800, after an illness of two weeks, he died, at the age of seventy-five years, and his remains were buried beside those of his father in the cemetery at Green Bay.\n\nThus passed away the Sieur Charles De Langlade, whose long life was one of varied excitement, replete with martial deeds, and scenes of deepest interest in the forest and among the savages. He had, as he often stated, been in ninety-nine battles, skirmishes, and border forays, and used to express a desire in his old age that he could share in another, so as to make the number one hundred. He was mild and patient, but could never brook an insult; friendly and benevolent in his feelings, and was devotedly loved by all classes of his acquaintances. He was very industrious, and always employed in some useful occupation, often chopping his own wood, and hewing timber for houses. His integrity was proverbial; once, under the old French regime, he made out his account of goods purchased for the Indians in his department, when the French Commissary returned it to him, and suggested that he make it over again; he did so, when it was again handed\n\n236\n\nto him with the same request, and thus repeated four times, and each time, though he made a new transcript, it was precisely the same. At length the Commissary intimated to him, that he had returned it to him, as he saw it was very moderate in size, and the King of France could very well pay it if it were four or five times as large. He simply replied, that that was all just, and he could claim nothing more. He never used his position or opportunities to plunder the public, and died as he had lived, an honest man. The name given him by the Indians, is expressive of their idea of the leading trait of his character — A-ke-wau-ge-ke-tau-so, or He-who-is-fierce-for-the-land, that is, a military Conqueror. Like his father before him, he was un bon Catholique.\n\nHe was of medium height, about five feet nine inches, a square built man, rather heavy, but never corpulent. His head was bald, and in his old age the hair on the sides of his head had a silvery whiteness; his eyes were large and deep black, with very heavy eye-brows grown together. His face was round and full, and he presented altogether a fine appearance. When dressed, as I have often seen him, in his British scarlet, uniform, his military chapeau, his sword and red morocco belt, he exhibited as fine a martial appearance as any officer I ever beheld. The silver buckle of his sword-belt which he used in all his military services in two years, I take pleasure in presenting to the State Historical Society for its Cabinet, and hope it may be long preserved as a personal memorial of the early founder and father of Wisconsin.\n\nMy grandmother, the widow of Charles De Langlade, was a woman rather tall and portly in her old age with a mild, brows eye. She was regarded as quite handsome in her day. After her husband's death, she made her home with her daughter, and died at Green Bay in 1818, at about the age of seventy-five years.\n\nIt is creditable to the intelligence and cultivation of the De\n\n237\n\nLanglades and other early settlers at Green Bay, that a distinguished French nobleman, upon visiting the country many years ago, should express his surprise, at hearing from the natives of the country, the French language spoken with the same purity and elegance, to which he was accustomed to hear it in Paris.\n\nI will now make some mention of such of my grandfathers old companions in arms, as were known to me. I have already said that Gautier De Verville was his nephew, a native of Mackinaw. I can state no specific services of his beyond what I have given in connection with my grandfather's; but I know that he was my grandfather's constant companion in all, or nearly all, his services during the old French and Revolutionary wars, and had a captain's commission during the latter service. He was a tall, spare man, rather full face, brown eye, not handsome, but yet pleasant in all his intercourse. After the war, he continued to make Mackinaw his home, had a farm, and sometimes acted as Indian interpreter for the British Government. He married a Miss Chevallier, of Mackinaw, a tall and handsome woman; they had two daughters, the eldest of whom became the wife of Capt. Henry Monroe Fisher, a reputed nephew of President Monroe, who came to the North-West as a clerk for an English trader named Todd, with whom he remained three years, and then located himself as a trader at Prairie du Chien, where he resided when I first visited the place in 1795. That year Michael Brisbois married the youngest daughter of Gautier De Verville, and the next year, Capt. Fisher went to Mackinaw and married the eldest. Gautier De Verville and his wife went to Prairie du Chien, about 1798, to live with Michael Brisbois; and De Verville died there about 1803, at about the age of sixty-five; his widow survived him several years. Both Fisher and Brisbois were prominent and useful men at Prairie du Chien, and have left worthy descendants, so that the descendants of Sieur Augustin De Langlade,\n\n238\n\nthrough De Verville, are among the most respectable in the country.\n\nAmable De Gere, who was commonly called La Rose, a native of Montreal, early wended his way to Mackinaw, and took part as we have seen, in the old French and Indian war. He was a part of the time employed in the Indian trade for himself, and a part for others. He made Green Bay his home for several years, when not in the Indian country, and finally left for his native region, about 1790, and never returned to the West. He was then getting quite old, was unmarried, and was well regarded by my grandfather and all who knew him.\n\nAnother of the brave and hardy band who served under my grandfather, was Pierre Caree, a native of Canada. Like\n\n239\n\nDe Gere, he was sometimes a clerk for other traders, and sometimes trading for himself. During the war of 1812-15, he acted as interpreter for the British Col. Robert Dickson. In the fall of 1812, Col. Dickson started from Mackinaw with government goods for the Indians around Prairie du Chien, taking with him Carce as interpreter; but winter overtaking them at Winnebago Lake, they became frozen in, and spent the winter on Garlic Island, between the present Oshkosh and Neenah; in the spring they continued on to Prairie du Chien, distributed the goods, and started on their return journey. At the mouth of the Manisle river, a stream emptying into Lake Michigan, above Green Bay, they encamped, and the next morning finding themselves wind-bound, Caree took his gun and went out a hunting, and unfortunately got bewildered and lost. Col. Dickson staid two days endeavoring to find him, but without success, when he continued on to Mackinaw. Caree soon lost his flint from his gun-lock, and though he had ammunition, his gun was useless to him. As it was in May or early June, there were no wild fruits, and he ate roots and almost anything he could find. One day a hawk flying over him with a partridge in its claws, spying Caree, dropped its game, probably from sudden fear, which the half-starved man devoured raw. He at length reached the Lake shore, and there found a half decayed fish, and poor as it was, he made a meal out of it, and kept on up the Lake, and finally reached human habitations, at Point St. Aeneas, six miles from Mackinaw, just fifty days after he got lost. He was so emaciated that he was scarcely recognized by those who knew him well. He had well nigh lost his senses; and had to be nursed some time before his recovery, when he was sent to his friends in Canada. Two years afterwards he was heard from, when he was still with his relatives, and well. He had no family.\n\nLouis Hamline, a native of Canada, and also one of De\n\n240\n\nLanglade's old soldiers, lived at Mackinaw, where he had a family. He was once setting trout-lines under the ice on the border of Lake Michigan, when a heavy wind blew a large body of ice, where he was, quite a distance into the Lake, upon which he remained nine days, without food, when the wind veered about and drove the ice on shore again. He must have died at Mackinaw many years ago.\n\nLa Fortune was another of my grandfather's war followers, a hardy Canadian; he had an Ottawa wife, and lived with the Indians near Mackinaw, among whom he was noted as a great hunter.\n\nMachar, another of the party, was an uncle to my father, and was the grandfather of Mrs. John Dousman, of Lake Shawanaw. He was a native of Canada, a man of great fearlessness, and was long a trader in the North-West. Once when he had his trading post at the Falls of the Chippewa river, with three men with him in his employ, he persuaded a band of Chippewas, encamped some distance above him, and a party of Sioux below, to meet at his post and make a treaty of peace and friendship, for they had been implacable foes from time immemorial. They accepted the invitation, met, and smoked the pipe of peace, with many a pledge of friendship. The Chippewas first took their departure, when the treacherous Sioux managed to get around and then ahead of them, and killed one of their number. The Chippewas then returned to Machar's trading post, and lingered around there till they had exhausted their own supplies, and nearly all the provisions of the traders. They then applied to Machar for further aid, when he gave them ammunition, and bid them go the next morning to hunt for deer, and not fail to bring him all the deer they should kill. The next night they brought in thirty deer. Machar then supplied them with powder, lead, and other necessary articles, and bid them return home and go to hunting, to pay their credits and support their families. They obeyed his directions. And this\n\n241\n\nis only one instance of his influence with the Indians; his firmness and fearlessness always made him respected among them. Machar had three children, two sons and a daughter; he went to Detroit in his old age, to live with one of his sons, and died there, more than fifty years ago.\n\nThe Green Bay settlement, from its inception in 1745 to 1785, a period of forty years, had made but little progress. At my earliest recollection, say 1785, there were but seven families, who with their engages and others did not exceed fifty-six souls; and I feel quite certain, that at no anterior date, did the actual residents amount to more. It may be interesting to preserve the names of the early settlers, with the number of their families, and so I will give them: Charles De Langlade, wife, two Pawnee servants, and three engages; Pierre Grignon, Sr., wife, six children, two Pawnee servants, and twelve engages; Lagral and wife; Baptist Brunet, wife, three children, and one engage; Amable Roy, wife, two Pawnee servants, one engage, and Baptist La Duke, an old trader, living with them; Joseph Roy, wife, five children, and one engage; a young man named Marchand, the agent of a Mackinaw trading company, having a store of Indian goods at the Bay, with four engages — making fifty-six the total population. Of those families, Brunet, Lagral and Joseph Roy, resided on the west side of the river, and De Langlade, Grignon, Amable Roy and Marchand, on the east. As Mr. Grignin and Marchand kept the only trading stores, we see the business was transacted on the cast side of the river. At this time there were no settlers at Depere, nor indeed anywhere on Fox river, except those here mentioned at the Bay.\n\nThe first settler who arrived after my recollection, was Jacques Porlier, from Montreal, in 1791. It was not till the next year, 1792, that Charles Reaume arrived, and took up his residence at the Bay. About this period others began to arrive, almost invariably from Canada — among them, John\n\n242\n\nLawe, in the summer of 1797; so that prior to the commencement of the war of 1812, the following persons, heads of families, had arrived and settled, mostly at the Bay, and from the Bay up as far as Depere; M. Duchano, Louis Gravel, Bartinme Chevalier, Pierre Chalifoux, Pierre Houlrich, Jacob Franks, Yout Brisque, Jacques and Nicholas Vieau, Baptist Cardronne, John Dousman, Pierre Carbonneau, John Vann, Joseph Houll, John Jacobs, Alexander Garriepy, Louis Bauprez, Joseph Duchanne, John Baptist Langerin, who married my mother, Prisque Hyotte, Amable Norman, John Baptist Lavigne, Augustin Bonneterre, Joseph Boucher, Antoine Le Boeuf, Augustin Thibeau, Alexander Dumond, George Fortier, Basil La Rock, Dominick Brunet, and Joseph Jourdin, the father-in-law of Ezekiel Williams; and the following natives of Green Bay had become heads of families prior to 1812, viz.: Perrish Brunet, my half-brother Perrish Grignon, and my brothers, Pierre, Charles, Louis and Baptist Grignon, and myself, and probably a few others. I have no definite idea of the total population at this period, but should think it was not less than two hundred and fifty.\n\nOf some of the early settlers at Green Bay, I must make a more particular mention. My father, Pierre Grignon, Sr., was born Montreal, and early engaged as a voyageur with traders in the Lake Superior country, and having saved his wages, he after awhile engaged as a trader on his own account, and located at Green Bay prior to 1763. He had served on some expeditions, probably during the old French war, but I remember no particulars. By his first wife, a Menomonee woman, he had three children; one of them died young from an injury by a fall, another died while at school at Montreal, and the other, Perrish, grew up, and raised a family. By his marriage with my mother, he raised nine children, and\n\n243\n\ndied in November, 1795, just before the birth of his youngest, at about the age of fifty-five or sixty years. He was a spare man, six feet in height, of light complexion; a man of bravery, and full of animation, but by no means quarrelsome. He was highly esteemed, and was regarded as strictly upright in all his dealings. He was particularly hospitable, and no year passed but he entertained many of the traders going to, or returning from, their winter trading posts.\n\nBaptist Brunei, from Quebec, must have come to Green Bay about 1775, and at first, for a year, engaged in my father's employ; the next year married a natural daughter of Gautier De Verville by a Pawnee servant woman of Chas. De Langlade. He was only a farmer, but a very good one, and died at Green Bay about 1815.\n\nAmiable and Joseph Roy, brothers, and natives of Montreal, found their way to Green Bay not very long after the old French war. Amable Roy married Agate, the daughter of the Sieur Augustin De Langlade, and the widow of M. Souligny; previous to which, he had done something in the Indian trade, and after his marriage, turned his attention to farming. He had no children; his wife died about 1801, willing him all her property, and he died about a year afterwards, and gave his property to young Louis Grignon, who had lived with him from childhood. Joseph Boy had been employed as an engage, and married a Menomonee woman, and raised two sons and four daughters, and survived some years after the war of 1812-15, and his very aged widow was still living but a very few years since. Of Lagral, I need only remark, that he came from Canada with his wife, and settled at the Bay about 1785, or a very little before, for I remember their coming, and remained only about four years, when they sold their place to my father, and left the country.\n\n244\n\nJames Porlier, who came to Green Bay, as already stated, in 1791, proved the most useful man to the settlement of all the French Canadian emigrants who settled there during my day. He was born at Montreal in 1765, and received a good education at a seminary in that city, with a view of the priesthood; but changing his mind, he engaged in his father's employ, who carried on a large business. In 1791, he received from Gov. Alured Clark a commission of Captain-Lieutenant of the militia of Montreal, and the same year left to seek his fortune in the West, coming directly to Green Bay. He engaged at first as a clerk for my father, and thus remained employed for two years; the first winter remaining in the store at Green Bay, and the next he spent at Mr. Grignon's trading post on the St. Croix. He them engaged in the Indian trade for himself, and spent his winters in the Indian country for many years, on the Sauk river, on the Tipper Mississippi, Buffalo river, Pine river, and several points on the Mississippi and Wisconsin, and continued more or less in the trade as long as he lived.\n\nIt was while on the St. Croix, in 1793, that he married Miss Marguerite Griesie, whose father was a Frenchman, the first clerk Pierre Grignon, Sr., had at Green Bay, where he married a Menomonee woman, and afterwards left the country, abandoning his wife and child. Mr. Porlier found Miss Griesie and her mother with a band of the Menomonees spending the hunting season on the St. Croix.\n\nIn January, 1815, Mr. Porlier was commissioned by Gov. George Prevost, of Canada, a Justice of the Peace, and Captain of the militia of Green Bay, under the British Government, which commission was certified by Lieut. Col. McDonall, Commandant at Macknaw; and it would appear from a\n\n245\n\nmemorandum among Mr. Porlier's papers, that he had been commissioned a Justice of the Peace, by the British in 1812; but I have no recollection of his having acted under these commissions. When Brown county was organized, under the American Government, Mr. Porlier was first appointed an Ensign of militia by Gov. Cass in 1819, and three years afterwards a Lieutenant. In September, 1820, he was commissioned by Gov. Cass, Chief Justice of Brown county, as the successor of Matthew Irwin, and by re-appointments continued to serve as Chief Justice till the organization of Wisconsin Territory, in 1836. In 1820, he was also commissioned a Justice of the Peace and County Commissioner; and in 1822, Judge of Probate. He was almost constantly engaged in public service between 1820 and 1836, and yet found time to do something at his old business as a trader. A few years before his death, the right half of his body became partly paralyzed, and he died after two or three days' illness, at Green Bay, July 12th, 1839, at the age of seventy-four years.\n\nJudge Porlier was about five feet, ten inches in height, of medium size, of light complexion, a little bald, very mild, and invariably pleasant to all. The public positions he filled so long and so well, are the best evidences of the esteem for his character, and the confidence reposed in him. Such was his solicitude to fit himself for his judicial position, that he patiently translated from the English, and left in manuscript, the Revised Laws of Michigan Territory, in the French language. His widow survived him about five years; they had several children, three of whom are still living.\n\nCharles Reaume was, I dare say, as my old departed friend Solomon Juneau has stated, a native of La Prairie, nearly\n\n246\n\nopposite to Montreal. His family was very respectable, and he enjoyed good educational advantages. He appears early to have left Montreal, and went to Detroit, where he had relatives, among them a nephew named Alexander Reaume, a trader, but if I ever knew; the particulars of his career there, I have forgotten. He engaged in the Indian trade, and, like most traders, roamed the forests of the North-West, between the great Lakes and the Mississippi, and, I think, spent several years in this way, and made several journeys to Mackinaw, and at last one to Montreal, where he became united in marriage to a Misa Sanguenette, daughter of a prominent merchant of that city, and a lady of great worth. He now managed to commence business in Montreal, I think merchandizing, and mostly on credit, and by bad management, soon failed; and, naturally proud and haughty, he did not care to remain there, and thus left Montreal, abandoning his wife, — they having no children, — and again turned his face westward. He came directly to Green Bay, as I have always understood; this was in 1792, and he accompanied Mr. Porlier in the fall of that year, and spent the winter with him on the St. Croix river. Returning to the Bay the next spring, he went to Mackinaw, and managed to obtain on credit about six or seven hundred dollars worth of goods for the Indian trade, and brought them to the Bay, where, erecting a trader's cabin, of logs, covered with slabs, chinked and daubed, he opened his small store, and commenced operations. In due time he sold out, ate up, and squandered his little stock, probably as he had done at Montreal; and having no returns to make to the Mackinaw merchants, he was unable to obtain a new supply, and this ended his attempts at merchandizing.\n\n247\n\nHe was a singular man — vain, pompous, and fond of show; and his sense of honor and justice was not very high. He led a jolly, easy life, always getting his share of good things whenever within his reach, and never seemed to have a care or thought for the morrow.
