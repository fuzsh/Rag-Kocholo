        "text": "1 vols. 8vo. Condition: Old folds and some tears. 1 vols. 8vo. Clement Biddle 1740-1814, American Revolutionary soldier, b. Philadelphia. Early in the war, he helped organize the \"Quaker Blues,\" a company of volunteers. He later served as deputy quartermaster general of the Pennsylvania and New Jersey militia, commissary general of forage under Nathaniel Greene in the Carolina campaign, and quartermaster general of the Pennsylvania militia. After the war he was (1787-93) U.S. marshal in Pennsylvania, but he gained more note as an importing merchant of Philadelphia. Clement's brother Charles Biddle 1745-1821, was a ship captain during the Revolutionary war before starting a successful career in Pennsylvania politics, serving, in 1785 as Benjamin Franklin's Vice President during his Presidential tenure. Franklin also appointed him as acting Chief Executive of the State of Pennsylvnia. In 1787 he was elected to the Pennsylvania Legislature but was unable to assume the position, having already been appointed as Clerk to the Supreme Executive Council. In 1791 he was commissioned Prothonotary of the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia, which he maintained until 1809 when he was elected to the State Senate of Pennsylvania, serving several terms. He was also one of the original members of the Society of Cincinnati, serving as its treasurer in 1811. A letter regarding Charles' late brother Clement's affairs, specifically concerning land once owned by Clement: \"You will oblige me and confer a favour upon the family of Col. Biddle by informing me whether the lands mentioned in your letter are the same that were sold to Mr. Brown, and if not every information that you can give respecting them will be thankfully received\"."
