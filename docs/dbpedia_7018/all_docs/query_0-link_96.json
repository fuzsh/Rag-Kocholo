        "text": "This is a pretty standard White House photo, the sort of image you have probably noticed dozens of times since President Biden took office a little more than 100 days ago, from newspaper photographs to shots on cable news networks.\n\nBut look just past the president and notice the bust of Robert F. Kennedy behind him.\n\nKennedy crops up a lot these days, observing the scene here a few weeks ago\n\nand nosing in here,\n\nas Winston Churchill did during the Trump administration,\n\nand as Abraham Lincoln did during the Obama administration.\n\nYou will see the bust over and over because of its particular placement next to the fireplace, behind the chair where the president sits during many meetings. Biden has long cited R.F.K. as one of his political heroes, and sees his evolution from a hard-nosed attorney general into a liberal icon as a sign of the capacity to grow.\n\nBut it is only one of the highly symbolic pieces of newly installed art that now saturate the images that come out of the White House.\n\nThe art in the Oval Office is ever-present, carefully chosen and deliberately placed\n\nadding historical weight,\n\nsilently commenting on the moment,\n\nthe present, now more than ever, in constant tension with the past.\n\nWhat if the paintings and sculptures could talk? What if they already do?\n\nIndeed, the paintings and the sculptures that are displayed in the Oval Office represent the choices of each American president — subtle and not so subtle signals every administration sends about its values and view of history.\n\nAnd so although the Oval Office is perhaps not often thought of as an ultra-high-profile rotating exhibition space, in one narrow sense, that is exactly what it is.\n\n“The Oval Office decoration often reflects a president’s view of history and the nature of his hopes for the future,” said Jon Meacham, the presidential biographer whom Biden asked to advise on art for the Oval Office.\n\n“Presidents have a unique place, not only as an object of the historical imagination, but as an architect of it. And so to catalog and take a look around the virtual attic of the Oval Office through the years tells you a lot about what presidents value — not only the stories they are interested in, but the stories they are writing themselves.”\n\nPresidential and art historians say that already, Biden’s approach to art appears distinct from his predecessors. In terms of sheer volume, he has included more sculptures and paintings than other recent presidents, in part, experts say, because he is trying to signal his support for an array of causes: labor, science, the importance of compromise and more.\n\nLook at Biden’s fireplace wall:\n\nMoving to the other side of the Oval Office …\n\nBiden’s office contains at least seven busts of key figures, an unusually high number. They include women, people of color and civil rights champions.\n\nTaken together, the sculptures represent a diverse and inclusive cross-section of America and its history.\n\nThe bust of King was put on view during the Obama administration. The Biden administration has added sculptures of Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks and Chavez. And White House curators believe those artworks are among the first of women and people of color to be displayed in the Oval Office.\n\nNo painted works by artists of color have been prominently displayed in the Oval Office over the last six decades, according to curators. No female painters, with the exception of Elizabeth Shoumatoff who painted a portrait of F.D.R., have ever had their work displayed prominently in the room.\n\nIt was in the 1960s that Jacqueline Kennedy, as first lady, began the transformation of the White House into a sort of grand, living museum. She created the White House Historical Association, hired the first White House curator and established various committees to assist with preserving art. As a result, the White House now has its own art collection, which presidents often tap when it is time to redecorate.\n\nThe Oval Office itself is not very large — around 800 square feet. There are a few places where art traditionally resides.\n\nThe president can request items from federally funded art institutions including the National Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian American Art Museum — or really any other museum that is willing to lend.\n\nYet the collection of paintings that have hung on the walls of the Oval Office since the Kennedy administration is remarkably small — only about 43 different works (and one photograph) spanning 60 years:\n\nMost of the paintings have been portraits of founding-father types and other figures from American history such as Washington, Franklin, Lincoln and Jackson:\n\nThere were also landscapes:\n\nAnd there was a photograph of Earth, hung during the Nixon administration.\n\nAstronauts from the Apollo 8 mission gave Richard M. Nixon the photograph, and he had it reframed so it would become “something more suitable” for the Oval Office. He hung the photo to the right of his desk. But it was later replaced with a painting of the White House.\n\nAt times, the Oval Office has been more functional and homey than it is today. Franklin Roosevelt, who had the office moved to its present location, barely had room to work on his desk because it was covered with tchotchkes. John F. Kennedy kept a coconut shell on his desk as a paperweight to remind him of the time he was stranded at sea during World War II.\n\nYou may have noticed many of the same landscapes and portraits appearing over and over. Or that Kennedy changed tack, filling his office with seascapes and naval scenes. (Go back and scroll fast. It’s kind of fun.)\n\nBiden’s selection of Roosevelt to hang in the prominent spot above the fireplace is a break from nine consecutive administrations that picked a Washington portrait:\n\nTrump’s decorative choices reflected his admiration for Jackson — a president Trump embraced as a populist leader even as some Democrats distanced themselves from him.\n\nObama sought to modernize his home and office, bringing in a California decorator to freshen the spaces and borrowing paintings from the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nDid you notice anything different in that last photo of Biden’s Oval Office?\n\nLook again.\n\nWhere is the Chavez bust? The White House moved it onto a pedestal early on in the administration. It’s on the right in this photo:\n\nThe change means the bust isn’t quite as prominent as it was at first.\n\nBut it won’t look as distracting in pictures."
