        "text": "1961\n\nCongressional Medal of Honor Holders\n\nH.R. 845 — Public Law 87-138, approved August 14, 1961\n\nProposes that persons awarded the Congressional Medal of Honorbe placed on the honor roll at age 50 instead of the present requirement of 65. Authorizes a monthly pension of $100 instead of $10 as is now paid. Those who now hold the Medal of Honor would be paid the increased sum automatically, future holders would receive the increased amount at any time upon request. Thus greater recognition would be given to the holders of this honor.\n\nLincoln's First Inaugural\n\nHouse Joint Resolution 155 — Public Law 87-1, approved March 1, 1961\n\nThe first act signed into public law by President John F. Kennedy was a joint resolution commemorating, with proper ceremonies at the U.S. Capitol on March 4, 1961, the 100th anniversary of the first inaugural of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nMedal — Dr. Thomas a Dooley III\n\nHouse Joint Resolution 306 — Public Law 87-42, approved May 27, 1961\n\nAuthorizes the President to award an appropriate gold medal, in the name of Congress, to the late Dr. Thomas Anthony Dooley III, in recognition of his services to the people of Laos and to peoples in other newly developing countries.\n\nPacific War Memorial\n\nH.R. 44 — Public Law 87-201, approved September 6, 1961\n\nAuthorizes the appropriation of $150,000 to complete the construction of the chapel and memorial shrine of the U.S. Pacific War Memorial at Pearl Harbor. The memorial is to be located on the hulk of the U.S.S. Arizona and is to honor all personnel of our Armed Forces who died during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Three hundred and seventy thousand dollars has already been raised by public subscription and by appropriations from the State of Hawaii; they have been used in completing the first phase of the construction of the memorial. It is hoped that memorial will be completed by December 7, 1961, which will be the 20th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nWoodrow Wilson Memorial Commission\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 51 — Public Law 87-364, approved October 4, 1961\n\nEstablishes the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Commission to consider and formulate plans for the design, construction, and location of a permanent memorial in Washington, D.C., or its environs, to Woodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States.\n\nThe membership is to be composed of: Former Presidents of the United States; two presidential appointees; two Senators appointed by the President of the Senate; two Congressmen to be appointed by the Speaker; and three members to be appointed by the President, one from each of the following— The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, the Woodrow Wilson Centennial Commission, and the Director of the National Park Service or his representative.\n\nThe members are to service without pay but will be reimbursed for necessary expenses. The Commission is to report its plans and recommendations to the President and Congress at the earliest possible date.\n\n1962\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission\n\nHouse Joint Resolution 712 — Public Law 87-842, approved October 18, 1962\n\nAuthorized the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission to determine whether the winning design for the proposed Roosevelt Memorial, submitted by Pedersen and Tilney of New York, can be changed or modified to secure approval by the Commission of Fine Arts. If, however, such changes or modifications are not practical, the Commission, with the advice of the Fine Arts Commission, can select another design and take into consideration a living memorial to President Roosevelt, such as a stadium, an educational institution, an information center, a memorial park, or any other suitable or worthy project.\n\nCommission must report its findings by June 30, 1963.\n\nHouse Office Building\n\nHouse Joint Resolution 711 — Public Law 87-453, approved May 21, 1962.\n\nCongress enacted and President Kennedy signed into law a bill naming the three House Office Buildings in honor of former House Speakers.\n\nThe original building will be known as the William B. Bankhead Building, the second will be the Nicholas Longworth Building, and the one now under construction the Sam Rayburn Building.\n\nThe three former Speakers held office when work on the buildings named for them was started.\n\nMedal — Bob Hope\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 88 — Public Law 87-478, approved June 8, 1962\n\nAuthorized the President to present to Bob Hope, in the name of the people of the United States, a gold medal in recognition of his services to his country and to the cause of world peace.\n\nMacArthur Medal\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 228 — Public Law 87-760, approved October 9, 1962\n\nAuthorized the President, in the name of Congress, to award a gold medal to the General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. Directed the Secretary of Treasury to strike the gold medal with suitable emblems and inscriptions.\n\nSam Rayburn Medal\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 133 — Public Law 87-702, approved September 26, 1962.\n\nAuthorized the Secretary of Treasury to strike and present to the estate of Sam Rayburn a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions to be determined by the Secretary, but to include the phrase \"For services rendered to the people of the United States.\"\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury is also authorized to manufacture and sell bronze duplicates of the medal, under such regulation as he may prescribe, at a price to cover their cost.\n\nIt is very unusual for Congress to recommend the striking of a gold medal for service as a Member of Congress. Prior to this recommendation for striking a medal for Sam Rayburn, the only other gold medal struck for service as a Member of Congress was for Alben W. Barkley while he was Vice President. Congress makes this recommendation only because Sam Rayburn was an extraordinary man, one of the truly great men of his generation.\n\nExcept for the 80th and 83d Congresses, when he was minority leader, Sam Rayburn served as Speaker of the House of Representatives from September 16, 1940, until his death on November 16, 1961. On June 12, 1961, Sam Rayburn reached twice the length of service as Speaker of the House of Representatives attained by his nearest rival in history, Henry Clay. Clay's service as Speaker covered 3,056 days, or 8 years 4 months 11 days. Sam Rayburn, at his death, had served as Speaker for 17 years 62 days.\n\nIn 1912 he ran for office as U.S. Representative from his district in Texas, and was elected, taking his seat in the 63d Congress, which first met in 1913. Thereafter, he was elected to each succeeding Congress through the 87th. From 1931 to 1937 he was chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. In the 75th and 76th Congresses, 1937 to 1940, he was majority leader. On September 16, 1940, he was elected Speaker.\n\nIn his career, Sam Rayburn set many records. At 29, he was the youngest man ever elected speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. When he died, on November 16, 1961, he was 79 years old, and had served in the House of Representatives for 48 years 8 months, consecutively, surpassing the record of consecutive House service set by Adolph Joseph Sabath, of Illinois, which was 45 years 8 months 2 days, and the record of 46 years of nonconsecutive House service set by Joseph Cannon, of Missouri.\n\nOn signing this act, President Kennedy said:\n\nIt is a great source of personal pleasure to sign this joint resolution in the presence of Members of the Congress from the State of Texas who served with Mr. Rayburn and knew him so intimately and are tied to him by the strongest lines of friendship. I join with them in authorizing the striking of the gold medal in recognition of the distinguished services of Sam Rayburn to the people of the United States.\n\nMr. Rayburn had an extremely high sense of public service from the time that he was in the Texas Legislature, where he was speaker there as a young man; with his long service in the House of Representatives, where he had the universal respect and affection of Members of both sides of the aisle, and held the office of Speaker twice as long as any other person in our history, gave freely of his time and energy to all the Members of Congress and those occupants of the White House who served with him, whether they were Republicans or Democrats, and gave unfailing support.\n\nI think his career has been a sources of inspiration to all people in public life. In the State of Texas they love him, and I say I am glad to sign it in the presence of the Vice President, a longtime friend, Senator from Texas, Senator Yarborough, and Members of the Congress, all of whom have been in close association with him.\n\nNational Cultural Center Week\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 214 — Public Law 87-804, approved October 15, 1962\n\nAuthorized the President to proclaim the period from November 26 through December 2, 1962, as National Cultural Center Week.\n\nCongress, by the act of September 2, 1958, established a Board known as the Trustees of the National Cultural Center and authorized the Trustees to operate a National Cultural Center on a designated site in Washington, D.C. That act further emphasized the desire of the Congress that the National Cultural Center should be a national institution serving the American people through its programs.\n\nThe Trustees of the National Cultural Center have developed a program to raise funds both for the National Cultural Center and for the support of cultural and civil organizations at the community level, and this fundraising program will reach a climax on November 29, 1962, in a coast-to-coast, closed-circuit telecast entitled \"An American Pageant of the Arts,\" which will be a presentation of the regional art of our national heritage; and from which local sponsoring committees will keep up to 50 percent of the proceeds. This dual support of both national and local cultural institutions is in keeping with the Center's intentions of strengthening cultural organizations everywhere.\n\nThe proclamation by the President designating the period from November 26, 1962, through December 2, 1962, will call the attention of the American people to the establishment of the National Cultural Center and its need for public support through financial contributions.\n\nWhite House Police Force\n\nH.R. 11261 — Public Law 87-481, approved June 8, 1962\n\nProvided for the creation of a permanent White House Police force, under the control and supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury, to protect the Executive Mansion and Grounds in the District of Columbia, any building in which White House offices are located, the President and members of his immediate family. The members of the force will possess privileges and powers similar to those of members of the Metropolitan Police of the District.\n\nIncreased the number of the White House Police from 170 to 250.\n\nThis bill authorized needed protection under present as well as future conditions and for protection of the President and his family while away from the White House.\n\n1963\n\nAdditional Assistant Secretary of State\n\nS. 1512 — Passed Senate July 16; pending in House Foreign Affairs Committee\n\nAuthorizes, subject to Senate confirmation, one additional Assistant Secretary of State. This position would be filled by the Director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. The Bureau of Intelligence and Research has the dual function of meeting the requirements of the coordinated intelligence community under intelligence directives issued by the National Security Council and also meeting the Department's own research and intelligence needs.\n\nThe bill also authorizes retired Foreign Service officers to accept, with the specific authorization in each case of the Secretary of State, employment as advisors or consultants to foreign governments. This will enable certain newly independent countries to obtain advice and counsel in establishing embassies and setting up foreign service systems and becoming familiar with the international practices of protocol.\n\nAdditional Assistant Secretary of Treasury\n\nS. 1359 — Public Law 88-58, approved July 8, 1963\n\nAuthorizes an additional assistant secretaryship in the Department of Treasury.\n\nAdministrative Conference of the United States\n\nS. 1664 — Passed Senate October 30; pending in House Judiciary Committee\n\nEstablishes a permanent Administrative Conference of the United States to provide machinery where the Federal administrative agencies can, with the active assistance of outside authorities on administrative practices, formulate recommendations to improve their own procedures.\n\nThe basic objective of the Administrative Conference is to cut down on the time and cost of administrative procedures and, at the same time, preserve the necessary elements of due process of law.\n\nThe 11 man Conference will consist of a Chairman, Council, and Assembly, with the Chairman appointed by the President for a 5 year term and confirmed by the Senate. The 10 members, appointed by the President, will serve for 3 year terms.\n\nThe basic powers of the Conference will be to study problems and make recommendations.\n\nAlaska Centennial Commission\n\nS. 49 — Passed Senate August 20; pending in House Judiciary Committee\n\nProvides for the creation of the Alaska Centennial Commission and authorizes the Commission to cooperate with the State of Alaska to study and report on the way in which the United States can participate in the celebration in 1967 of the centennial anniversary of the purchase of Alaska.\n\nAuthorizes an appropriation not to exceed $25,000 for the purposes of the Commission.\n\nAlaska Mineral Lands Selection\n\nS. 1878 — Passed Senate November 27; pending in House Interior Committee\n\nProvides for an additional 5 years from January 3, 1964, within which the new State of Alaska may select lands under Federal mineral lease.\n\nBattle of Lake Erie Sesquicentennial Celebration Commission\n\nS. 1828 — Passed Senate August 20; House Calendar\n\nAmends the joint resolution establishing the Battle of Lake Erie Sesquicentennial Celebration Commission to authorize an appropriation not to exceed $25,000 for the expenses of the Commission.\n\nThe Commission to develop and execute plans for the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Lake Erie was created by the act of October 24, 1962. The 150th anniversary of the Battle of Lake Erie near Put-in Bay, Ohio, will occur on September 8, 1963.\n\nBig Hole National Battlefield\n\nS. 138 —Public Law 85-24, approved May 17, 1963\n\nRedesignates Big Hole Battlefield National Monument in Montana as Big Hole National Battlefield and authorized adding 460 acres to preserve the historic features and sites associated with the Battle of the Big Hole, bringing the total battle area to 666 acres.\n\nThe additions will include the site of the Nez Perce Indian encampment where the first and most important phase of the battle took place; the twin trees from which an Indian sharpshooter punished the retreating troops; and the Army's howitzer pit, which was outflanked and captured by the Nez Perce warriors during the summer of 1877.\n\nBourbon Whisky\n\nSenate Concurrent Resolution 19 — Passed Senate September 25; House Calendar\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress against importing whisky designated as \"bourbon whisky,\" since it is recognized as a distinctive product of the United States.\n\nCoinage of Kennedy 50-cent Pieces\n\nH.R. 9413 — Public Law 88-256, approved December 30, 1963\n\nAuthorizes the Treasury Department to mint new 50-cent pieces with the likeness of the late President John F. Kennedy.\n\nIn requesting the legislation, President Johnson said:\n\nThe U.S. Mint, which operates under the direction of the Treasury Department, must have legislative authority to make this change since the present design of the Benjamin Franklin half dollar piece has been in circulation less than 25 years. If the design of a coin has been in effect longer than this period the Treasury can, on its own, change this design.\n\nSince the assassination of President Kennedy, many Americans have written requesting that his portrait be placed on a U.S. coin. If the Congress accedes to this request, the new half-dollar pieces will have President Kennedy's portrait on the face of the coin and an adaptation of the seal of the President of the United States as the central motif on the reverse side. Both the seal and the portrait, which was sculptured by Gilroy Roberts, chief engraver of the U.S. Mint, appear on President Kennedy's commemorative medal. The new half dollar will also carry the inscription, \"Liberty,\" \"In God We Trust,\" and the year of coinage on its face, while on the reverse side will appear \"United States of America,\" \"Half Dollar\" and \"E Pluribus Unum.\"\n\nSeveral factors entered into the selection of the 50cent piece to carry the likeness of the late President: It is the only subsidiary coin that does not bear the portrait of a President; a new production of half dollars had been scheduled to begin in January; more half dollars could be struck than if the design were used on a silver dollar. Since there is a limited amount of silver held by the Treasury for coinage, the country would benefit by being able to put into circulation more than twice as many coins for the silver used. The cost of making a new coin would be nominal, since the design already exists and the work connected with making new dies would be accomplished within the Treasury Department.\n\nConstitution Day\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 48 — Passed Senate June 11; pending in House Judiciary Committee\n\nPurpose of the joint resolution is to designate the 17th of September in each year as \"Constitution Day,\" and to request the President to issue, annually, a proclamation calling on the people to display our flag on that day in their homes and other suitable places.\n\nDesign Protection\n\nS. 776 — Passed Senate December 6; pending in House Judiciary Committee\n\nGranted effective protection against copying to creators of original ornamental designs of useful articles by providing simple, easily secured, and effective design protection for a period of 5 years, or if renewed, a period of 10 years.\n\nExisting law protects these creators by design patents; however, a design patent may not be issued until a search has been made to determine that such design possesses novelty. Thus the damage may be done before the search is complete.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt Foundation\n\nH.R. 4715 — Public Law 88-11, approved April 23, 1963\n\nAuthorized granting a Federal charter to the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Foundation. Under the terms of the charter, the Foundation will work in the areas of Mrs. Roosevelt's principal interests: relief of the poor and underprivileged; promotion of public health; promotion of economic welfare; and furtherance of international good will.\n\nIn signing the measure into law, the President expressed his appreciation to former Ambassador Philip M. Klutznick, who has accepted the national campaign chairmanship. Hyman H. Bookbinder, on leave from his post as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce will serve as the Director of the Foundation.\n\nPresident Kennedy announced the following members of the Board of Trustees: Ambassador Adlai E. Stevenson, Chairman, New York, N.Y.; Philip M. Klutznick, national campaign chairman, Chicago, Ill.; Marian Anderson, Danbury Conn.; Bernard M. Baruch, Kingstree, S.C.; Robert S. Benjamin, Long Island, N.Y.; William Benton, Phoenix, Ariz.; Chester Bowles, Washington, D.C.; Henry Crown, Chicago, Ill.; David Dubinsky, New York, N.Y.; Myer Feldman, Washington, D.C.; Ralph J. Bunche, New York, N.Y.; Mrs. Marshall Field, New York, N.Y.; Raymond Firestone, Akron, Ohio; Arnold M. Grant, New York, N.Y.; Arthur Hanisch, Pasadena, Calif.; John R. Heller, New York, N.Y.; Mrs. Thomas B. Hess, New York, N.Y.; Mrs. Anna Rosenberg Hoffman, New York, N.Y.; Joseph D. Keenan, Washington, D.C.; Mrs. Joseph Lash, New York, N.Y.; Mrs. Albert D. Lasker, New York, N.Y.; Herbert H. Lehman, New York, N.Y.; Archibald MacLeish, Conway, Mass.; John J. McCloy, New York, N.Y.; Charles Mayo, Rochester, Minn.; George Meany, Washington, D.C.; Mrs. Agnes E. Meyer, Washington, D.C.; Jubal R. Parten, Houston, Tex.; Walter P. Reuther, Detroit, Mich.; Dore Schary, New York, N.Y.; Mrs. Stephen E. Smith, New York, N.Y. Herman Steinkraus, Westport, Conn.; Roy Wilkins, New York, N.Y.; Thomas J. Watson, Jr., Greenwich, Conn.\n\nThe following, Mrs. Roosevelt's five children are ex officio trustees: Mrs. Anna R. Halsted, Birmingham, Mich.; James Roosevelt, Washington, D.C.; Elliott Roosevelt, Miami Beach, Fla.; Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., Washington, D.C.; John A. Roosevelt, New York, N.Y.\n\nIn thanking them, the President said, \"Mrs. Roosevelt, I believe, would be pleased to know that her friends and associates have chosen this way to continue her work, especially because it enables all citizens to take part in deeds rather than just words.\"\n\nThe President expressed confidence that as soon as the American people become aware of the Foundation's \"outstanding leadership and high purposes\" they will respond generously to the appeal for support. The Foundation's financial backing will come from private sources, no Federal revenues are involved. An initial goal of $25 million has been set for a one-time campaign to be completed by October 11, 1964, the 80th birthday of Mrs. Roosevelt.\n\nFormer Presidents\n\nSenate Resolution 78 — Senate adopted October 1, 1963\n\nEntitles former Presidents of the United States to seats in the U.S. Senate as Senators at Large with the right to speak on the floor and to participate in committee activities. It would not extend such a privilege to any former President removed from the Presidency under article II, section 4, of the Constitution or those holding any office to which U.S. Senators would not be eligible.\n\nSenators at Large would not have the right to introduce bills or resolutions, to make motions, or to vote on any matter. They would, however, have suitable office space in the Senate wing or the Senate Office Buildings.\n\nGovernment Contracts\n\nS. 572 — Passed Senate May 27; pending in House Government Operations Committee\n\nTo establish uniformity and equality in contracting for public utility services and in purchasing natural gas, coal, and other utilities. Government contracts for these services are limited to 10 years by this bill.\n\nThe need for this limitation arose because of the interpretation of a provision in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act which permitted natural gas suppliers to enter into 10year contracts to supply Government agencies with natural gas for the production of utilities but denied the same privilege to coal and oil producers.\n\nGuam — Rehabilitation\n\nH.R. 6225 — Public Law 88-170, approved November 4, 1963\n\nAuthorizes appropriations up to $45 million against which the government of Guam may draw to finance public works and community development projects; $10 million will be in grants and $35 million in loans.\n\nProvides for the creation of a joint Federal and Guam Government Committee to prepare a long-range economic development plan for the island.\n\nThe program authorized by this bill will provide for modern schools, governmental buildings, and planned community development including water, sewer, and partial power facilities.\n\nRepayment of the loans will begin in 5 years, June 30, 1968, and will continue for 30 years. The interest rate will be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nGuam — Urban Renewal and Housing\n\nH.R. 6481 — Public Law 88-171, approved November 4, 1963\n\nThis bill ratifies the action of the Legislature of Guam creating a public agency empowered to carry out urban renewal and housing activities and to participate in Federal programs of assistance in this field.\n\nThis act will provide one means by which Guam can assist itself not only in overcoming the disastrous effects of two typhoons, but also in rebuilding its civilian housing accommodations to acceptable standards. These accommodations have been extremely inadequate since World War II when the island was occupied by the Japanese and heavily shelled by our own forces.\n\nThe bill specifically provides that obligations of the Guam Housing and Urban Renewal Authority are not obligations of the United States to the territory.\n\nIndependence Day\n\nS. Con. Res. 25 — Passed Senate June 11; passed House June 26, 1963\n\nPurpose of this concurrent resolution is to declare as the sense of Congress that the anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence should be observed each year by ringing bells throughout the United States at 2 p.m. on the Fourth of July, or at such other time on that day as may be determined by local authority.\n\nThe resolution calls on civic and other community leaders to take appropriate steps and to encourage public participation in the observance.\n\nKennedy Art Center\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 136 — Passed Senate December 18, House Joint Resolution 871— House Calendar\n\nRenames the National Cultural Center as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations in an aggregate amount equal to the gifts, bequests, and devises held by the Board of Trustees but not in excess of $15,500,000.\n\nProvides borrowing authority by issuance of revenue bonds up to $15,400,000 to the Secretary of Treasury to finance necessary parking facilities for the Center.\n\nLicensed Attorneys\n\nS. 1466 — Passed Senate December 6; pending in House Judiciary Committee\n\nPurpose of this legislation is to do away with the special bars for attorneys who appear before certain Federal administrative agencies. In a number of agencies, lawyers have met with delays attempting to deal with even the most routine tasks. Thus this bill eliminated admission requirements for licensed attorneys to allow persons to be represented before all Federal agencies by counsel of their choice, and require agencies to deal with litigant's representatives.\n\nMedals and Medal of Honor Roll\n\nH.R. 2998 — Public Law 88-77, approved July 25, 1963\n\nExpands authority for award of the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, the Air Force Cross, and the Silver Star to permit award of these medals for heroism and gallantry that occur in cold war situations.\n\nThe bill continues authority for the award of these medals for distinguished service while engaged in action against an enemy of the United States. In addition, it would permit award of appropriate medals for persons whose heroism or gallantry occurs: (1) in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or (2) while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against opposing armed forces in which the United States is not a belligerent party.\n\nMrs. Jacqueline Kennedy — Temporary Help and Protection\n\nH.R. 9291 — Public Law 88-195, approved December 11, 1963\n\nProvides for a 12 month period, office space, equipment, and staff for Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy's use, widow of the late President. Provides for a lifetime use of the franking privilege. Authorizes Secret Service protection for a 2 year period for Mrs. Kennedy and her two children.\n\nLimits staff salaries to $50,000 a year and authorizes an appropriation of $65,000 to carry out purposes of the act, $15,000 of which is for the President's burial.\n\nNational Council and National Arts Foundation\n\nS. 2379 — Passed Senate December 20; pending in House Education and Labor Committee\n\nEstablishes in the Executive Office of the President a National Council on the Arts of 25 members appointed by the President from among private citizens widely recognized for their knowledge, experience, and interest in the arts and are to include practicing artists, civic cultural leaders, members of the museum profession, and others professional engaged in the arts.\n\nThe Council is to recommend ways to maintain and increase the cultural resources of the United States and to propose methods to encourage private initiative in the arts.\n\nEstablishes as an independent agency a National Arts Foundation to come into being 90 days after the Council is established. The Foundation is to be governed by a 21 member Board of Trustees selected in the same manner as the Council. The Foundation is to make matching grants to nonprofit professional groups engaged in or concerned with the arts and to States to assist in supporting existing projects and developing new ones.\n\nAuthorizes up to $5 million for grants to groups and to States for fiscal 1964 and up to $10 million for each fiscal year thereafter.\n\nNational Cultural Center\n\nS. 1652 — Public Law 88-100, approved August 19, 1963\n\nExtended to September 2, 1966, the termination date of the National Cultural Center Act.\n\nThe bill also increased the number of general trustees of the National Cultural Center from 15 to 30 and provided staggered terms for the additional trustees. To correspond with the enlargement of the Board of Trustees, provided for a larger quorum requirement.\n\nNational Public Works Week\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 87 — Passed Senate August 20; pending in House Judiciary Committee\n\nAuthorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week commencing September 8, 1963, as National Public Works Week, and calling on the people of the United States to celebrate the week with appropriate activities and ceremonies.\n\nNational Stockpile\n\nS. 1994 — Public Law 88154, approved October 17, 1963\n\nAuthorizes the disposal of approximately 5,800,000 pounds of waterfowl feathers and down from the national stockpile and waives the requirement for a 6 month waiting period before this disposal could begin.\n\nPinkerton - Detective Agencies\n\nS. 1543 — Passed Senate October 17; pending in House Government Operations Committee\n\nPermits Federal agencies and the District government to contract with Pinkerton and other private detective agencies for guards.\n\nIn 1893 Congress enacted legislation prohibiting hiring Pinkerton employees or employees of similar agencies. There had been an outbreak of industrial labor troubles and detective agencies were hired by management to protect property and non-striking employees. It was alleged that Pinkerton had \"the largest trained and armed force in the country, outside the army and the militia. Because of this old law, the Government has been unable to permit detective agency firms to bid on contracts for guard service.\n\nWhile permitting the Government to contract with private agencies for guards, the Senate kept a prohibition against employing such agencies for investigative work.\n\nPresidential Transition\n\nH.R. 4638 — House asks for conference October 31, 1963\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator of General Services to provide, on request, to each President-elect and each Vice President-elect suitable office space, payment of staff salaries, travel expenses, communication services, printing and binding, and postage (subject to appropriations) during the transition period between election and inauguration.\n\nUnder existing law former Presidents are authorized for life an allowance of $25,000 a year, an office staff provided by the Administrator of General Services to be paid an aggregate of no more than $50,000 a year, suitable office space and free mail within the United States and its territories and possessions.\n\nIn addition, this bill authorizes for former Presidents, in connection with winding up the affairs of office and for a 6 month period, office space, compensation for staff personnel and experts, travel expenses for himself and members of his staff, communications, printing and binding, and postal expenses. These temporary 6 month benefits extend to former Vice Presidents who are not now covered by existing law.\n\nLimits the authorized appropriation to $500,000 for necessary expenses during the transition period.\n\nPublic Lands in Alaska\n\nH.R. 6118 — Public Law 88-135, approved October 8, 1963\n\nAmends the Alaska Statehood Act to provide that the State may exercise its right of selection of certain Federal lands for community expansion purposes in tracts of not less than 160 acres.\n\nAt present, under a Department of Interior ruling, the State's selections under the statehood act for community purposes are required to be in blocks of not less than 5,760 acres unless the State can show that a desired area of lesser acreage is in fact an isolated tract. Evidence shows that blocks of 5,760 acres were in many cases unnecessary for community expansion purposes and might well prove an unsound utilization of publicly owned lands, especially in the national forests. Also with the amount of land authorized for community expansion purposes by the statehood act limited to 800,000 acres, the requirement for selection in 5,760 acre blocks may well inhibit community development in Alaska.\n\nPublic Lands in Nevada\n\nS. 873 — Public Law 88-35, approved May 29, 1963\n\nAuthorized the Secretary of Interior to convey 2,844 acres of public land in the State of Nevada to Lincoln County at the fair market value plus any adverse valid claims.\n\nLincoln County has been declared a depressed area, and this bill will permit the county to attempt to develop this land for industrial or other uses. This particular acreage has little value for livestock grazing, recreational, or subdivisional use, and of unknown value for agriculture.\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nH.R. 5945 — Passed Senate amended December 9, 1963\n\nEstablishes a Commission to recommend procedures for settlement of political status of Puerto Rico.\n\nSalem Maritime National Historic Site, Mass.\n\nH.R. 976 — Public Law 88-199, approved December 12, 1963\n\nProvides for acquisition (by purchase or donation) of the 17th century Narbonne House in Salem, Mass., and for its administration as part of the Salem Maritime National Historic Site.\n\nSam Rayburn Dam and Reservoir\n\nH.R. 7594 — Public Law 88-123, approved September 11, 1963\n\nThis bill changes the name of the McGee Bend Dam and Reservoir on the Angelina River, Tex., authorized by the River and Harbor Act of 1945, to the Sam Rayburn Dam and Reservoir, in honor of the late Sam Rayburn, a Member of Congress from Texas and Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nSubmerged Lands\n\nH.R. 2073 — Public Law 88-183, approved November 20, 1963\n\nThis bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, at the request of the Governors of Guam, Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, respectively, to convey to the government of the territory concerned whatever right, title, or interest the United States has in particular tract of tidelands, submerged lands, or filled lands in or adjacent to the territory, subject to certain limitations, if the land is clearly required for specific economic development purposes or to satisfy a compelling public need.\n\nU.S. Waters — Fishing\n\nS. 1988 — Passed Senate October 1; pending in House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries\n\nProhibits fishing in territorial waters or along the Continental Shelf claimed by the United States except by domestic vessels, or as provided by international treaty, or by the Secretary of Treasury issuing licenses to foreign vessels where the Secretary of Interior certifies that permission would be in the national interest and on concurrence of any State, Commonwealth, or territory directly affected.\n\nProvides for penalties involving a fine of $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than a year, or both, for any person violating the provisions of the act. Authority is granted to seize and forfeit the vessel and all fish taken in violation of the act. Present law relating to seizure, forfeiture, and condemnation of cargo for violation of the customs laws is made applicable to seizures and forfeitures incurred under this act.\n\nMakes enforcement a responsibility of the U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Interior, and the U.S. Bureau of Customs. Authorizes officials of appropriate Federal courts to issue warrants or other process as required for enforcement of the act.\n\nAuthorizes Secretary of Treasury to issue regulations."
