        "text": "Histories of racial inequality and the struggle for civil rights in the United States tend to focus on the South, with attention on the aftermath of slavery, the short-lived freedoms of Reconstruction, the rise of intensive state-sanctioned racial segregation, and the emergence of nonviolent protests against Jim Crow in the 1950s. The history of the black freedom struggle outside the South has generally remained in the shadows. The North had a long—if mostly forgotten—history of chattel slavery from the through the early . Many fortunes in banking, textiles, and shipping up North were built on the backs of unfree African American labor. Cities such as Boston, New York, and Philadelphia rose to economic power because of the trade in slaves and the products of plantations in the South and Caribbean, particularly cotton.1\n\nAs slavery waned in the North with gradual emancipation, racial inequality persisted and, in many places, hardened. In the French political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville observed that\n\nin the North the white no longer clearly perceives the barrier that is supposed to separate him from this debased race, and he shuns the Negro all the more assiduously for fear that he might one day become indistinguishable from him.\n\nEven in those northern states that had abolished or prohibited slavery, Tocqueville observed that\n\nthe Negro is free, but he cannot share the rights, pleasures, labors, or sorrows—not even the tomb of him whose equal he has been declared to be. There is no place where the two can come together, whether in life or death.2\n\nIn the decades preceding the Civil War, northern abolitionists worked to destroy slavery both in their own region and in the South. Black and white anti-slavery activists participated in the Underground Railroad, resisted Fugitive Slave Laws, and valiantly fought the Confederacy. In some states, under pressure by civil rights activists, legislatures abolished racially separate schools and extended voting rights to African American men during the decades preceding and immediately following the Civil War. During Reconstruction, several northern states passed laws forbidding discrimination by race in public education and public accommodations.3\n\nThe Great Migration\n\nQuestions of race and civil rights, however, remained minor issues in northern politics until the . As late as , nearly nine out of ten African Americans still lived in the South, and large sections of states outside the old Confederacy had few, if any, non-whites. Most northern blacks were concentrated in a handful of large cities, notably Philadelphia and New York. Those patterns changed profoundly with the Great Migration ( ) of African Americans northward. More than six million African Americans left the South in search of economic opportunities in burgeoning northern industries. Some fled the declining southern agricultural economy. Others were refugees from widespread racial violence. Many migrants saw themselves as part of an exodus to a “promised land” or a “New Canaan,” where they would be free from the indignities and dangers of southern racism.4\n\nThe Great Migration generated intense racial conflict in the North. During the first decades of the , dozens of race riots broke out in northern towns and cities, always instigated by whites threatened by growing black populations. Those riots peaked in times of social and economic instability. During World War I and its aftermath, whites attacked African Americans in East Saint Louis and Chicago.5 During the 1920s, millions of northern whites joined the Ku Klux Klan, an organization committed to nativism, anti-Catholicism, and opposition to equality between African Americans and whites. Members of the Klan gained political power throughout the North. In Detroit, a Klansman lost the mayoral election on technicalities in a city riven by racial tensions. The same year as the near-KKK victory, whites attacked the house of Ossian Sweet, an African American doctor who moved into a white neighborhood.6\n\nJim Crow in Public Accommodations\n\nFew northern states had laws that required the segregation of blacks and whites in public spaces, but Jim Crow was commonly practiced north of the Mason-Dixon line. Movie theaters regularly turned away black customers or confined them to the balconies (colloquially called the “crow’s nests”). Swimming pools, roller rinks, dance halls, bowling alleys, and amusement parks were strictly segregated by race.7 The Young Women’s and Young Men’s Christian Associations (YWCA and YMCA) provided recreation, education, and social services to blacks and whites in racially separate buildings.8 Public parks, beaches, and pools were rigorously segregated by race. In some cities, public swimming facilities sometimes admitted African Americans on a segregated basis, usually on the day before pools were emptied, cleaned, and refilled.9 Few restaurants and hotels in the North that served white patrons allowed African Americans entry. Black travelers relied on The Negro Motorist’s Green Book and on advertisements in African American newspapers to find hotels, campgrounds, and restaurants that were open to them.10\n\nWorkplace Discrimination\n\nDuring the Great Migration, most northern employers refused to hire African Americans at all. For the first third of the , most black men held service jobs, serving as janitors, maintenance men, barbers, and cooks. The vast majority of African American women in the paid workforce in the North through the Great Depression worked as domestics, cooks, or laundry workers. Others worked in informal jobs, ranging from prostitution to numbers running. Few blacks found work in the skilled building trades. Retail jobs that required interaction with white customers were closed to African Americans. Even fewer found white-collar positions. Even African Americans with professional degrees, including doctors, engineers, and lawyers, found it nearly impossible to find work in white-owned businesses or major corporations until the 1960s.11\n\nBefore World War II, African Americans sometimes found work in industry but nearly always in unskilled jobs, often in dangerous or unpleasant settings. In Chicago, black men found work on the killing floors of meatpacking plants. In major steel-producing cities, including Chicago, Gary, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh, black workers generally toiled in the unbearable heat of foundries, pouring molten iron and stoking furnaces with coke, a form of processed coal. In the auto industry, blacks were confined to maintenance jobs or hazardous jobs such as engine lifting and car-body painting. Many employers hired black workers to replace white workers who were on strike and in the process fueled racial resentment by whites who believed that African Americans were stealing their jobs. Other firms instituted a strict system of racial segregation on the shop floor or assembly line, refusing to place black workers in white jobs. Whether as domestics and cooks or assembly line workers, African Americans were almost always paid less than their white counterparts. They were the first to be laid off during economic downturns and the last to be hired. Even companies that employed African American workers often did so as a last resort, particularly during periods of labor shortages, including World War I and World War II. Black workers regularly complained of being turned away when they applied for jobs, even as employers continued to hire whites.12\n\nLabor unions had a mixed record of providing support for African American workers. Most unions in the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which was dominated by skilled labors, regularly endorsed racially discriminatory practices. Construction unions favored the sons, brothers, and relatives of their members, who were usually all white. But the AFL also included all-black unions, including the influential Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, led by Asa Philip Randolph. The Sleeping Car Porters had an outsized role in civil rights organizing, in part because of Randolph’s leadership, in part because as railway workers, porters carried black newspapers, pamphlets, and accounts of black resistance to nearly every town in the United States with a railroad depot and a black population.13\n\nThe Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), founded in , which represented workers in some of the nation’s largest manufacturers, tended to be more open to African American workers. During the Depression and World War II, as the CIO rapidly expanded, its leaders rallied workers around the slogan “black and white, unite and fight.” This slogan was based on the argument that a unified workforce could more effectively challenge employers who profited from pitting the interests of black and white workers against each other. Still, many CIO unions did not challenge employers’ use of racial classifications for assigning work. Even in some of the most racially progressive unions, such as the autoworkers, electrical workers, and steelworkers, blacks were trapped in unskilled jobs and seldom, if ever, were hired or promoted to well-paying skilled jobs.14\n\nSystematic Housing Segregation\n\nDuring the period of the Great Migration, northern whites, acting individually and collectively—and working through banks, real estate firms, and government—imposed a system of nearly complete segregation in the housing market. Racial segregation was not commonplace in the North before the Great Migration. In his pathbreaking study of Philadelphia (the northern city with the largest black population at the end of the ), W. E. B. Du Bois found that blacks and whites lived in close proximity to each other. Later historians writing about Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and New York noted that African Americans tended to live in poor and working-class neighborhoods that were racially and ethnically heterogeneous.15\n\nThat pattern changed rapidly beginning in the 1920s. Nearly every new home built in white neighborhoods between and included racial restrictions in home titles, deeds, and rental agreements. Using the racial and ethnic classifications commonplace in the early , racially restrictive covenants forbade the occupancy or use of properties by groups other than “whites” or “Caucasians,” and prevented the sale or rental of homes to “Negroes” (sometimes called Africans or Ethiopians) as well as Jews and sometimes Asians. Many northern municipalities became “sundown towns,” posting signs forbidding the presence of African Americans after dark.16\n\nResidential segregation took a more systematic form during the Great Depression. New government agencies (the Home Owners Loan Corporation, created in ; the Federal Housing Administration, in , the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in ; and the Veterans Administration, in ), promoted home ownership by guaranteeing affordable home loans and mortgages. As a result of the loosening of credit, rates of homeownership skyrocketed in the United States. But federally backed loans and mortgages were generally unavailable to African Americans. The Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC), collaborating with local bankers and real estate brokers, prepared maps that ranked neighborhoods to determine the eligibility of properties for federally guaranteed mortgages and home loans. The HOLC designated neighborhoods as “the best” (A or green), “still desirable” (B or blue), “definitely declining” (C or yellow), and “hazardous” (D or red). Any neighborhood with even a handful of African Americans, unless they were live-in domestic servants, received a D rating.17\n\nWith access to affordable home mortgages and loans, whites moved in growing numbers to racially homogeneous suburbs, where banks refused to extend mortgages to African Americans. The result was the confinement of African Americans to what some at the time called “ghettos,” including New York’s Harlem, Chicago’s Bronzeville, and Detroit’s Paradise Valley, or in small black suburbs, mostly places with long-established black communities and self-built housing. Because African Americans did not have access to conventional mortgages, they had to resort to various forms of predatory lending, most commonly contract buying, which had high interest rates and substantial monthly charges. The majority of blacks in northern cities were trapped in rental housing, often in deteriorating neighborhoods. By the middle of the , the nation’s most racially segregated metropolitan areas were all in the northeast and Midwest.18\n\nEducational Segregation\n\nMany northern states had laws dating to the that forbade racial separation in schools; however, some states, including New York, New Jersey, and Indiana, permitted racially segregated public schools well into the . But even states where school segregation was forbidden by law, such statutes were seldom honored. In communities with small black populations, school districts built “colored” or “Negro” schools that all African American students were required to attend, regardless of where they lived. A traveler driving across the North could stop in nearly every town with a black population and find a school named after Abraham Lincoln, Thaddeus Stevens, or prominent black intellectuals such as Phyllis Wheatley or Arthur Dunbar and know by the school’s name that it was segregated. If a town’s black student population was not large enough to justify a separate school, districts regularly confined black students to their own classrooms. Some districts even required African Americans students to play in separate playgrounds. In bigger cities, school attendance zones tended to correspond with racially segregated neighborhoods. When the African American population expanded, school districts usually redrew or gerrymandered school boundaries to ensure that schools remained racially heterogeneous. Most districts also refused to hire African American teachers, except to teach African American students. Black teachers were almost always paid less than their white counterparts.19\n\nViolence and Policing\n\nIn many African American neighborhoods in the North, the only whites present wore blue uniforms. Northern police forces were usually all white or nearly all white through the early 1970s. Urban African Americans were deeply distrustful of the police and mostly for good reason. White police officers regularly targeted blacks who ventured into white neighborhoods. They regularly harassed, threatened, and beat black suspects and arrestees. When whites attacked the homes of the first African Americans to move into formerly all-white neighborhoods, the police usually turned a blind eye to window breaking, arson, and other vandalism. They seldom investigated racial incidents. And they usually refused to uphold laws that forbade racial discrimination in public places. Police regularly arrested African Americans who refused to give up their seats at white-only restaurants, even in states where such segregation was illegal. Instead, they often charged black protestors with disturbing the peace, trespassing, or resisting arrest. Even when the police were accused of negligence, harassment, or brutality, they were usually immune from discipline and seldom faced criminal charges. White judges and juries usually sympathized with the police and refused to convict uniformed officers of wrongdoing.20\n\nCommunity Formation and Political Mobilization\n\nThe Great Migration witnessed an intense period of community formation in African American neighborhoods throughout the north. Black-run institutions, including churches, civic clubs, fraternities and sororities, social service organizations, trade unions, and cultural organizations thrived in densely packed African American districts. So-called race businesses provided goods and services that whites would not provide to blacks. Migrant communities gave rise to the thriving culture of the “New Negro,” particularly in Harlem and Chicago, where artists, poets, musicians, and authors used their work to celebrate black culture and challenge racial conventions. The concentration of population fostered a sense of community consciousness and became the basis for political organization and grassroots resistance to discrimination and segregation.21\n\nAs the northern African American population grew, the ranks of black elected officials swelled. Unlike in the South, where only a small percentage of blacks had the right to vote, northern blacks faced fewer obstacles to political participation. African Americans in northern cities used the power of the ballot box to gain patronage jobs and political recognition. In states where the electorate was closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, white politicians heeded the demands of their black constituents as a matter of political expediency. By the mid-1930s, however, urban blacks increasingly cast their political lot with the Democratic Party, largely because they benefited from New Deal social programs. Still, enough African American voters remained in the party of Lincoln through the 1960s to attract the attention of politicians of both parties. By mid-century, nearly all the largest northern cities, led by Chicago, had elected at least a few African Americans to office, including to school boards, city councils, state legislatures, and the US House of Representatives. They used their positions to pressure local, state, and federal governments to hire African Americans. The percentage of black public employees grew steadily in the decades following the New Deal, even if most of them worked in menial jobs, particularly janitorial and sanitation work. African Americans, especially in northern states with intense partisan competition, also pushed (often successfully) for the passage of local and state civil rights legislation, winning support from both parties.22\n\nAfrican Americans—still a small minority in most states—also pushed for social change through non-governmental organizations, most notably civil rights and racial advocacy organizations, many founded during the first wave of black migration northward. Some, like the United Negro Improvement Association, founded in and headquartered in Harlem, argued for black advancement through the creation of black-run businesses. Most northern cities also had vibrant chapters of the Booker T. Washington Business Association, a group that also promoted “race businesses.” During the Depression, the Young Negroes’ Co-Operative League, the Ladies Auxiliary of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and grassroots organizations in cities as diverse as Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Gary, New York, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh established cooperative grocery stores and cooperative credit unions to meet the needs of black consumers ill-served by white- dominated retailers and banks.23\n\nBlack women created a particularly extensive web of organizations committed to advancing the race, most of them particularly active in the North. The National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs (founded in ), the Young Women’s Christian Association, and various churchwomen’s organizations promoted a politics of respectability among African American migrant women. African American sororities had an outsized influence in working to provide charitable assistance to black women. The National Council of Negro Women, founded in , began as an organization promoting self-help and racial respectability but also grew increasingly active in protests and lobbied for local, state, and federal legislation to expand civil rights.24\n\nAlso committed to racial uplift was the National Urban League, founded in . The Urban League conducted research on racial inequality in northern cities and provided social services and job training to black migrants as a vehicle for racial advancement. By the 1930s, the Urban League also joined efforts to challenge discrimination in housing, education, and employment. Urban League officials met with white employers to persuade them to hire black workers. In addition, the Urban League also collaborated with other civil rights organizations to advocate civil rights legislation on the local, state, and national levels, with special attention to laws forbidding workplace discrimination.25\n\nThe most influential civil rights organization in the was the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in . The largest secular African American–dominated mass membership organization in the country, the NAACP pushed for racial equality through anti-discrimination legislation, litigation, and grassroots protest. The NAACP energetically formed local branches in hundreds of cities and towns in the north. Grassroots NAACP activists supported national civil rights efforts, including anti-lynching legislation and the desegregation of the military, but also organized intensively on the local level against segregated housing, discrimination and unemployment, and separate and unequal public education. In the late 1930s, the NAACP took a leftward turn, in part prompted by the rise of the National Negro Congress (NNC), an umbrella organization that included socialists and Communists, churchwomen, and militant trade unionists. The NNC had large chapters in nearly every major northern city, but lost membership when it struggled with factional disputes between Communists and their critics, eventually collapsing during the Cold War. During the same period, the NAACP expanded its mission and grew rapidly. By the end of World War II, the NAACP had more than a half million members nationwide, with the largest share in the urban North. While the NAACP’s central office dedicated its energy toward litigation around housing segregation, military desegregation, voting rights, labor discrimination, and especially southern school desegregation, its local branches, particularly in the North, directed much of their energy to local problems—full employment and fair employment in cities with major industrial unions; racially separate schools in smaller cities and suburbs; and anti-discrimination statutes in major cities—with little interference from the national office. Local branches varied in their base of support and tactics (some chapters were proudly proletarian and protest oriented, others were resolutely middle class and committed to fundraising and quiet lobbying. In large metropolitan areas, branches were always interracial; in smaller communities, they were often mostly black. Some branches were dominated by secular leftists, others closely associated with labor unions and still others tied to moderate religious leaders or black social clubs.26\n\nChallenging Northern Jim Crow\n\nAs early as the 1920s, civil rights activists began to resist Jim Crow in northern public accommodations but only sporadically. Efforts to desegregate public accommodations intensified during World War II, particularly because of wartime anti-fascist rhetoric. How could America be fighting for victory against racist regimes abroad while African Americans faced second-class status at home? In Cincinnati, for example, civil rights activists fought to open up downtown movie theaters to black customers by slowing ticket lines. In Detroit, black activists, many affiliated with the United Automobile Workers, protested against racial exclusion in downtown restaurants, bars, and bowling alleys. The most influential group to challenge segregation in public accommodations was the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), founded in Chicago in . An interracial group, informed by Christian socialism and nonviolence, CORE held sit-ins at city restaurants that refused to serve African Americans. Sit-ins became one of the most successful tactics of the civil rights movement nationwide. CORE members engaged in wade-ins at swimming pools and similar protests at bowling alleys, roller rinks, and amusement parks throughout the North in the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s. Some of CORE’s earliest members, among them Bayard Rustin and James Farmer, would travel southward in the 1950s, spreading the gospel of nonviolent resistance that they had honed in the North. Their efforts shaped the strategies of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, including lunch counter sit-ins and the Freedom Rides.27\n\nAnother tactic pioneered by northern activists was the use of paired black and white “testers,” who visited restaurants and hotels demanding service. If whites were served and blacks were not, activists filed discrimination complaints and publicized their efforts in the African American press. Slowly, these efforts succeeded in breaking down the barriers of segregation in the North and, at the same time, provided models for efforts to resist Jim Crow in commercial establishments south of the Mason-Dixon line. By the early 1960s, most northern restaurants and hotels served black customers, even if civil rights organizations fielded complaints about racial harassment, especially in dining establishments for decades more. But civil rights activists won pyrrhic victories against segregation in public pools, beaches, and amusement parks. Many cities closed pools rather than allowing blacks and whites to swim together. The 1960s witnessed a wave of urban amusement park closings as whites refused to send their children to integrated parks. In densely populated parts of the country, like the New Jersey shore and coastal Connecticut, municipalities restricted the use of beaches to local residents or required expensive beach passes—ostensibly color-blind measures designed to keep racial minorities out.28\n\nOpening the Workplace\n\nCivil rights activists targeted workplaces, particularly during the Great Depression and World War II. One of the major grievances was the lack of jobs for African Americans in neighborhood stores. Some activists, particularly those associated with fledgling black nationalist organizations including the United Negro Improvement Association founded “race” businesses that hired black workers to sell to black customers. Many northern cities had chapters of the Booker T. Washington Business Association, a group founded to promote black business ownership. During the 1930s, black activists launched cooperatives in several cities. The most influential efforts in the 1930s involved “Don’t Buy Where You Can’t Work” campaigns, which boycotted white-owned businesses with no black employees.29\n\nAs African Americans migrated to northern cities in search of industrial employment, civil rights activists turned their attention to undermining workplace discrimination and in expanding job opportunities. Activist women, including Ella Baker and Anna Arnold Hedgeman, investigated and reported on the abysmal conditions of black women laundry workers and domestics who gathered in New York’s infamous “slave market.” The National Negro Congress teamed with labor organizers to promote the unionization of African American workers, particularly in the industrial North. The NAACP collaborated closely with the United Automobile Workers in the 1930s and early 1940s to organize at Ford and other auto and defense plants and fight workplace discrimination. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the left-led National Negro Labor Council challenged workplace discrimination and led opposition to corporations that shut down plants in northern cities and moved production to suburbs, rural areas, and especially to the South, where workplace Jim Crow was nearly universal.30\n\nAs the United States mobilized industries for military production in and , A. Philip Randolph launched the March on Washington Movement (MOWM), using the threat of a mass demonstration in the nation’s capital to pressure President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to open employment in defense industries to black workers. In , in part to prevent the march, the president issued Executive Order 8802, which created Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) to investigate and prevent discrimination.31 Supporters of the MOWM regrouped near the end of World War II to demand the creation of a permanent federal FEPC. At the state and local level, civil rights organizations, led by the NAACP, pushed for laws to forbid workplace discrimination. In California, one of the few states in the mid- with a large multiracial population, labor and civil rights organizers attempted to build a coalition of African American, Mexican, and Asian workers, with mixed success, to challenge workplace discrimination and to expand employment opportunities. By , twenty-four states, all of them in the North and West, had passed laws prohibiting workplace discrimination by race. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which forbade discrimination on the basis of race, as well as sex, national origin, and age, drew its language and legal frameworks from state laws.32\n\nThe passage of anti-discrimination laws did not, however, automatically break down workplace discrimination. Many state laws were relatively toothless. Rather than penalizing employers for the systematic exclusion of blacks, they required efforts to educate employers or put into place mediation programs to resolve discrimination cases on an individual basis. Likewise Title VII of the Civil Rights Act required expensive litigation. By the early 1960s, civil rights activists pushed for more aggressive efforts to open workplaces to African Americans. Increasingly, they turned their attention to the skilled trades, public employment, and the health-care sectors. During the mid- and late 1960s, protesters in Philadelphia, New York, Newark, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and San Francisco mounted dramatic protests against discrimination in the building trades. In Philadelphia in , protesters engaged in sit-ins at the mayor’s office and picketed federally funded construction sites. That year and the next, in Queens, New York, black activists gathered outside a massive housing complex and a hospital, both under construction, and on one occasion chained themselves to a massive crane. In St. Louis, in , demonstrators chained themselves atop the partially built Gateway Arch. All of them demanded more aggressive efforts to open lucrative construction jobs to blacks. In , the Nixon administration, under pressure, required that all federal government contractors engage in affirmative action, setting aside jobs for minority workers.33\n\nUnder pressure from civil rights activists and litigators, local and state governments also instituted their own affirmative action programs, as did many colleges and universities. Anti-discrimination activists also targeted hospitals, usually located in or near urban African American neighborhoods, which provided a wide range of jobs, including janitorial and food service work, nursing, and surgery. In the aftermath of the urban uprisings of the 1960s, black protestors also targeted white-dominated police and fire departments, demanding jobs and usually facing fierce resistance. Although affirmative action was unpopular among whites, such policies led to dramatic increases in the number of black public employees, government-contracted workers, and students in selective colleges and universities. For the first time, big city police forces and fire departments opened their ranks to African American officers in significant numbers. Private employers, even those not bound by affirmative action requirements, also opened jobs to African Americans, especially women. Through the late 1950s, it was uncommon to see black women working in sales positions, or as secretaries, nurses, social workers, or clerks, except in black-owned firms. By the end of the , black women were well-represented in retail, clerical, health care, and social service professions.34\n\nFair Housing\n\nCivil rights activists in the North fought housing segregation, particularly during the World War II era, when segregation created a housing shortage: confining African Americans, especially wartime workers, to overcrowded and expensive housing. Lawyers, often working closely with local branches of the NAACP, filed suits challenging the legality of racially restrictive covenants in St. Louis, Chicago, and Detroit, among others. In California, where blacks, Mexican Americans, and Asian Americans experienced various degrees of discrimination in housing, civil rights activists and litigators attempted with mixed success to build interracial alliances to resist racial covenants and segregation. In a landmark case, Shelley v, Kraemer, the US Supreme Court ruled that racially restrictive covenants were legally unenforceable. Civil rights activists also charged private real estate developers with racial discrimination, including Metropolitan Life, which built large apartment complexes in New York, and builder Arthur Levitt, whose firm developed Levittowns in suburban New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and elsewhere. Private racial discrimination proved more resistant to change. State and federal courts regularly ruled that the government could not interfere in private real estate transactions.35\n\nCivil rights activists took two other tacks in the battle against housing segregation. In the 1940s, a coalition of religious groups and civil rights organizations launched fair or open housing campaigns, attempting to change the hearts and minds of white Americans about the desirability of black neighbors. Through films, pamphlets, and sermons, they made a case that housing discrimination was both immoral and economically irrational. At the same time, fair housing organizations lobbied local and state governments to enact laws that forbade racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. These campaigns bore fruit. By , twenty-four states had enacted fair housing laws. Those laws become a model for the Fair Housing Act, passed by Congress in the aftermath of urban riots and the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.36\n\nAchieving the goal of fair housing proved to be difficult, however, even after the passage of anti-discrimination laws. Those laws were difficult and costly to enforce. Real estate brokers and lenders found all sorts of ways to avoid selling and renting homes to African Americans, including steering black homebuyers away from white neighborhoods and vice versa. Lenders continued to redline African American neighborhoods, leaving black homebuyers to the whims of the subprime and non-conventional lending market, with high interest rates, punitive fees, and a high risk of foreclosure. The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development faced protests and budget cuts, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s, after it attempted to subsidize public housing in suburbia. Many suburban communities enacted zoning laws or used ostensibly color-blind tools such as environmental impact laws to exclude affordable housing. And whites continued to vote with their feet, despite a liberalization of attitudes toward racial integration, picking up and leaving neighborhoods that attracted even a small percentage of African Americans. The result was that racial segregation lessened very slowly, especially in the northern metropolitan areas with large African American populations. In , twenty-one of the nation’s twenty-five most-segregated metropolitan areas were in the Northeast and Midwest.37\n\nDesegregating Public Education\n\nThe challenge to separate and unequal education also proceeded by fits and starts in the North. Throughout the , especially during World War II and the ensuing decade, grassroots activists in racially mixed suburbs and small towns in the North fought to abolish separate schools. Black mothers led school boycotts in dozens of towns, particularly in New York and New Jersey. The NAACP also went to state and federal court in support of parents in places as diverse as Hillburn, Hempstead, and New Rochelle, New York; Cairo, Illinois; and Trenton and Englewood, New Jersey. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, activists increasingly turned their attention to big city school districts, leading massive student walkouts against overcrowded, underfunded, segregated schools in New York, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Chicago, Boston, and other cities throughout the first half of the 1960s.38\n\nCivil rights attorneys, particularly the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, turned to federal courts in the 1960s and first half of the 1970s, backing parents and students who demanded quality, racially balanced schools for their children. Many early federal cases required intradistrict integration in districts that had a record of drawing school boundaries to maintain segregation, including New Rochelle, Pontiac, Michigan, and Denver, Colorado. Intradistrict plans could not, however, adequately deal with the fact that white families mostly avoided racial integration by moving outside of central city districts to majority or all-white suburban schools. As long as northern school district boundaries overlapped with segregated metropolitan housing patterns, it was impossible to create racial balance in public education. But metropolitan-wide desegregation ultimately fell with the Supreme Court’s Milliken v. Bradley ( ) decision, which struck down a plan to bus children between the majority-black Detroit Public Schools and districts in dozens of surrounding all-white suburbs. The most prominent post-Milliken case involved Boston, where a federal court ordered intradistrict busing in lieu of a metropolitan-wide mandatory desegregation plan. Whites in Boston fiercely resisted school integration. Some majority-white suburban districts accepted African American students through a token, voluntary desegregation program; however, the pattern of racial imbalance across the metropolitan area was unchanged. As in Boston, big city school districts throughout the North, left to solve the problem of racial inequality in public education themselves without the option of regional solutions, experienced re-segregation, as whites continued to flee, leaving behind majority-minority public schools.39\n\nWhile most African Americans supported racial integration, they put quality education at the top of their list. When big city districts did not integrate, they looked for alternatives. By the end of the 1960s, some activists, influenced by black power, called for community-controlled schools and, in some cities, pushed for Afrocentric education. Others pushed cities to create special interest or magnet schools that would attract the most talented African American and white students. Some black activists embraced the idea of vouchers to send their children to private schools and school choice programs that would allow them to transfer to majority-white suburban schools. And by the 1990s, a wide interracial coalition of business and religious elites, foundations, and educational reformers advocated for the creation of charter schools, run by non-profits or businesses. From the late 1970s onward, black educational gains stagnated in most big city districts. And the emergence of large minority-dominated districts sapped political will in white-dominated state legislatures and in the US Congress for expanding funding for public education.40\n\nRace, Policing, and the Carceral State\n\nRacial disparities in policing and incarceration remained pressing and unresolved issues in the North. Throughout the (and beyond) civil rights organizations regularly fielded complaints from their constituents about police harassment and brutality. During the 1940s, left-leaning organizations, including the National Negro Congress and the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), publicized incidents of police brutality in both the North and the South. In its manifesto sent to the United Nations, “We Charge Genocide,” the CRC charged that “the wanton killing of Negroes…is no longer a sectional phenomenon.” Charges of police harassment mostly languished in the courts and were usually ignored by police departments. Police communisty relations worsened in the next few decades. Spurred by fears of juvenile delinquency and sensational accounts of gang violence in the 1950s, northern police departments stepped up activity, particularly on the borders of racially changing neighborhoods. Those efforts led to a full-blown crackdown on crime by the early 1960s. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, protests against police brutality intensified, often sparked by media coverage of the police beating and arresting civil rights protestors.\n\nThe fact that the vast majority of northern police were white greatly exacerbated tensions. Black newspapers regularly reported on police beatings, unwarranted arrests, and investigations and harassment of civil rights protestors. By , in a period of intensifying civil rights protest and growing militancy nationwide, police departments began accumulating riot gear, preparing for what many saw as an impending race war. Those fears came to fruition in a series of long, hot summers. In , African Americans angry about police violence took to the streets in Harlem, Rochester, and Philadelphia, looting stores and clashing with law enforcement officials. In , the Watts neighborhood in Los Angeles exploded in the wake of rumors that police killed an unarmed black woman. In , blacks rose up in 163 cities and towns, as small as Nyack, New York, and Plainfield, New Jersey, and as big as Detroit and Newark.\n\nBlack Power\n\nMany observers noted the coincidence of urban uprisings and the growing visibility of a movement demanding black power. The term “black power,” popularized by Harlem-raised activist Stokely Carmichael in the fall of , was less accurate as the description of a singular movement than as a name for a diverse impulse that had coursed through the black freedom struggle in the North at least since the Great Migration. Calls for black self-determination and self-defense waxed and waned in the period from the 1920s through the 1960s, but never fully disappeared. Groups like the Nation of Islam steadily expanded in the period following World War II, mostly without gaining media attention; the UNIA diminished in size but still had active chapters throughout the North; and black support for self-defense and racially separate institutions persisted. In the 1940s and 1950s, black activists in the United States drew inspiration from anticolonial struggles in Africa and Asia and increasingly adopted the language of self-determination. By the late 1950s, many black journalists and intellectuals increasingly argued that the plight of African Americans was like that of Africans yearning to free themselves from the yoke of colonization.41\n\nIn the early 1960s, newly formed black organizations, including the Deacons for Defense and the Revolutionary Action Movement argued that African Americans should take up arms against white oppression. Malcolm X and Robert F. Williams gained large followings in northern cities for their rejection of nonviolence. Calls for black power, self-defense, and separatism took fuel from the failures of civil rights in education, housing, and the workplace during the postwar years. And they drew inspiration from struggles against imperialism in Africa and the Caribbean. For most black power activists, the struggle for freedom in the United States was tied to resistance against apartheid in South Africa; independence movements in Algeria, Ghana, and the Congo; and revolutions in places as diverse as Cuba, Vietnam, and China.42\n\nA growing cadre of black militants called for the celebration of African culture, the creation or reinvigoration of separate black institutions, and the unleashing of black economic power through black-owned businesses. One of the most enduring currents of black power celebrated African and African American cultures through art, music, clothing, and poetry. The Black Arts movement, which thrived in New York, Detroit, and Los Angeles, turned the visual arts, song, and verse into tools to create and reinforce a distinctive black communal ethos. Black power advocates adapted African dress (such as the dashiki), celebrated natural hairstyles, and created new celebrations and rituals (most notably the holiday of Kwanzaa) to create common identities.43 Many of these efforts had analogues in the self-help, artistic, nationalist, and cooperative movements of the Great Migration era.\n\nBut black power was also shaped by distinctive features of postwar American culture. Many black militants called for the reassertion of a strong black masculinity, one that reinforced traditional notions of patriarchy. Some embraced the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, forming gun clubs and openly brandishing weapons on the streets. Others argued that white supremacy had psychologically damaged African Americans, drawing from postwar pop psychology. They argued that an emphasis on black pride and school curricula that valorized black heroes and black culture would bolster self-esteem and that African-influenced education would empower students who were marginalized by white teachers who used textbooks that denigrated people of African descent or ignored them altogether.44\n\nBlack power organizations were mostly small in membership and varied widely in their emphases. One observer hailed the rise of “cement-roots” organizations that promoted black advancement through community-run economic development and job training programs. The Black Panthers embraced Maoist ideas and also created community health and food distribution programs. The Revolutionary Union Movement pushed for black control on the shop floors of the auto industry. The Revolutionary Action Movement armed its small but ardent group of supporters for an upcoming race war. The Republic of New Afrika called for the United States to set aside land for an independent black nation. Nearly all of these organizations, for all of their different visions and strategies, faced intense repression by law enforcement officials, who infiltrated black radical organizations and introduced agents provocateurs who fueled inter-group rivalries and hatched violent schemes. Local police forces frequently raided black radical groups’ offices and storefronts, regularly arrested and sometimes assassinated radical leaders, and charged them (often falsely) with petty and major crimes, including disorderly conduct, murder, and sedition. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s COINTELPRO program infiltrated many black militant organizations, using agents to stir up factional rivalries and frame activists for conspiracies.45\n\nLaw and Order and Its Discontents\n\nThe combination of protest and rebellion led to urgent demands for a harsh new law-and-order politics. President Lyndon Johnson announced an ambitious “war on crime” and dramatically increased federal funding to police departments, which had long been supported by local tax revenue. Police departments purchased expensive military equipment and hired experienced military officials who were previously part of international counterinsurgency programs during the Cold War to provide training. The clamor for law and order became a central issue in local and national politics, leading big city majors to give license to harsh policing tactics and, increasingly, to state legislatures to pass laws that tightened sentencing. Alarmed by fears of a drug-infused counterculture that supposedly emanated from urban black culture, politicians launched a war on narcotics that led to stiffening sentences for the possession and sale of drugs. States also began expanding prison systems to accommodate those swept up in the anti-crime campaign—disproportionately African American men. The prison population expanded dramatically between the 1970s and the end of the first decade of the .46\n\nIn the 1970s, civil rights and black power activists turned their anger toward the prison system. Radical groups publicized the police and FBI infiltration of their organizations, and organized campaigns around the arrests or death of black activists. Mass prison uprisings in the 1970s, the most infamous at Attica in upstate New York, grew from prisoners’ discontent at miserable conditions and everyday brutality behind bars. But prisoners’ rights efforts were small in scale compared to what activists called the rise of the prison-industrial complex, a grim reality worsened by the long-term detention of arrestees and the emergence of long mandatory sentences for many crimes.47\n\nThe persistence of police brutality in the early , well documented by social media and on online news sources, fueled a new wave of outrage and grassroots organizing. In the early 2000s, activists complained of black motorists pulled over and harassed for “driving while black,” leading to investigations of racial profiling. But nothing was more galvanizing than a wave of well-publicized police killings in Ferguson, Missouri, Chicago, Baltimore, New York, Minneapolis, and elsewhere. Beginning in , protestors took to the streets in mass demonstrations on a larger scale than anything since the 1960s. Activists took to Twitter, using the hashtag Black Lives Matter, and sparking a new national movement working—as had past northern protests—through protest, litigation, and legislation, to resist ongoing racial injustice.48\n\nDiscussion of the Literature\n\nUntil recently, the history of civil rights in the South overshadowed the history of the African American freedom struggle in the North.49 The North usually appeared as a tragic coda to the southern freedom struggle, usually in accounts of “the movement moving North” through protests led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Chicago ( ) and accounts of racial conflicts that generated mass media attention, including the rise of the Black Panthers, debates about black power and community control in public education, and battles over school busing.50 Journalists and historians paid disproportionate attention to the supposed backlash of northern working-class whites against black power and liberalism in the 1960s and 1970s, with special attention to just a few places, namely Brooklyn, where black power advocates and urban Jews clashed over public education and affirmative action, and Boston, where blue-collar Irish and Italian Americans fiercely resisted racially integrated schools. Other accounts argued that well-meaning whites were alienated by black radicalism, urban riots, and skyrocketing rates of violent crime in northern cities. With few exceptions, influential accounts of race and politics in the North paid little heed to the deep roots of northern white opposition to racial equality, the long history of official and market-based segregation and discrimination in the North, or to the strategies, motivations, and ideology of black activists who fought for equality and rights.51\n\nConventional narratives of the civil rights movement rest also on a binary distinction between the South and North. They emphasize exceptional nature of southern racism, rooted in slavery, secession, racial terrorism, and systemic Jim Crow. Racism in the South, the conventional argument goes, was de jure—that is, legally mandated. Segregation in the North, by contrast, was de facto, the result of individual actions and prejudices or of ostensibly race-neutral market processes supposedly individualized and subtle. Histories of the freedom struggle in the South focused largely on non-violent struggles against violent, virulent white racism. Scholars downplayed the long history of black militancy and self-defense in the region, largely treating black militancy and black power as northern phenomena.52\n\nSince the early 2000s, however, a slew of local and regional case studies of the black politics and activism outside the South and a handful of synthetic accounts, have reoriented our understandings of the black freedom struggle.53 The most influential books and articles built on decades of work on urban and suburban history, on African American community life, and more generally on social and cultural, labor, and gender history, as well as on innovative work on grassroots politics. African American historiography laid the groundwork. In the aftermath of the urban uprisings of the 1960s, urbanists focused on the rise of segregated black ghettos through detailed case studies of Harlem, Chicago, Cleveland, and Detroit.54 Beginning in the 1980s, many African American historians challenged the paradigm of ghettoization, instead emphasizing community formation, with special attention to the role of black churches, fraternal organizations, and businesses in creating a common racial consciousness.55 In the 1990s and 2000s, urban and political historians turned their attention to the racialization of public space, housing, and labor in the period following the New Deal, in what one historian called “the spatial turn” in American political history. These histories, for all of their strengths, usually gave only scant attention to institutional and grassroots efforts to battle against northern racial inequality.56\n\nBy the early 2000s, Jacqueline Dowd Hall made a strong case for revisionist histories of “the long civil rights movement,” pushing the movement’s chronology backward in time and rejecting “the myth of southern exceptionalism,” thus expanding its geography northward and westward.57 Rather than focusing on the “classic period” of civil rights history in the South from the Montgomery Bus Boycott through the assassination of Rev. King, long civil rights historians researched black-led grassroots social movements in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Newark, New York City, Oakland, Seattle, and St. Louis. Other historians wrote case studies of the black freedom struggle in smaller places such as Grand Rapids, Michigan; coastal Connecticut; and Wichita, Kansas. Many of these books emphasized radical politics and challenged conventional distinctions between civil rights and black power.58\n\nA significant subset of newer northern civil rights histories focused on the origins of northern black activism during the Great Migration, turning their attention to groups that were underrepresented in earlier civil rights historiography, including black women activists and the politics of respectability and black girls and activism, and grassroots black internationalism.59 An explosion of work on black radicalism, nationalism, and militancy, focusing on activism from the interwar years through the 1960s uncovered a history of demands for black self-determination, anti-colonialism, self-defense, and community control that long predated black power.60 Historians of black leftism have offered fresh perspectives on the relationship of socialists and leftists to civil rights politics, including a spectrum of organizations ranging from the National Negro Congress, the Socialist Workers, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and the Communist Party. They have engaged in a robust debate about the Communism and anti-Communism and whether or not the Cold War opened possibilities for civil rights activists or channeled civil rights demands away from a critique of capitalism and toward notions of individual rights.61\n\nScholars of civil rights in the North have also opened up new perspectives on civil rights litigation and legislation. For decades following the civil rights revolution, legal historians focused on key Supreme Court decisions and offered top-down histories of the NAACP’s litigation strategies, usually through biographies of nationally known attorneys and close analyses of legal arguments, briefs, and opinions. Many influential legal scholars treated the NAACP’s litigation strategy as tailored toward the black elite and narrowly focused on integration. Recently, however, a handful of scholars have turned their attention to local and state courts and to lesser-known attorneys, in the process shedding new light on the rich, variegated, and often contradictory history of civil rights lawyering. The history of civil rights law from below, still underdeveloped, has uncovered local cases dealing with restrictive covenants, criminal law, and educational segregation and neighborhood schooling that were often at odds with or irrelevant to the NAACP’s southern-oriented litigation strategy. Recent books on anti-discrimination laws and their enforcement have also fruitfully explored intergroup conflict and collaboration, particularly around affirmative action.62\n\nRecent years have seen an outpouring of scholarship on black power organizations, dominated by work on the Black Panther Party (BPP). The best of the new work on the BPP moves beyond polarized debates about the efficacy of its strategies of self-defense and its leaders’ fiery rhetoric to rich accounts of its health and free breakfast programs, its relationship to a long history of black anticolonialism, its gender politics, and the political and strategic diversity of its many local chapters. Other black power groups, many of which received less media attention than the Panthers and, as a result less have received far less scholarly attention, including CORE (after its shift to black nationalism), Maulana Karenga’s US, the Revolutionary Action Movement, various Revolutionary Union Movements, the Young Lords, and the Republic of New Afrika.63 Revisionists have shed fresh light on black power’s gender politics, business and black power, black power and urban electoral politics, and the relationship of black power to conservatism.64 Biographies of activists who spent much of their lives in the North have greatly enriched our understanding of the connections between civil rights and black power movements, among them Grace Lee Boggs and James Boggs, Stokely Carmichael, Amiri Baraka, Rosa Parks, and Malcolm X.65\n\nSeveral pathbreaking works turned attention to what historian Lisa Levenstein has called “a movement without marches” largely led by black women, to improve public housing, challenge punitive welfare laws, and champion the rights of poor people. Recent books and articles have moved the history of the welfare rights and anti-poverty movements from the margins to the center of the field.66 A topic that long received scant attention by urban, political, and African American historians—racially disparate policing and incarceration—has sparked the rise of a new and rich subfield of books and articles about law and order politics, police brutality, the disparate racial impact of the war on drugs, and prison unrest and prisoner rights movements.67\n\nA growing body of work has focused on connections between religion and the black freedom struggle. African American religious history is a booming subfield, incorporating work on black nationalist sects, including the early Nation of Islam, black churchwomen, and black liberation theology.68 Several studies devoted attention to Roman Catholics who fought against the racial integration of their parishes and neighborhoods, and a small but vocal group of Catholics who supported civil rights.69 Histories of black-Jewish relations have largely moved beyond the bitter debates about black power and allegations of anti-Semitism dating to the late 1960s to explore the complicated relationship between Jewish institutions and leaders who were often staunchly pro-civil rights and Jewish business leaders and ordinary urban Jews, who were frequently indifferent or hostile to racial integration.70 The role of liberal white Protestants as allies of the civil rights movement has also attracted new attention.71\n\nThe scholarship on the black freedom struggle in the North—for all of the sweeping syntheses and detailed local case studies that have been published in recent years—remains incomplete. There are potentially hundreds of local studies to be written because nearly every city and town in the United States has its own, largely untold, civil rights and black power histories, with abundant materials in local archives, in the news media, in the records of national civil rights organizations with local chapters, and in still-to-be conducted oral histories of grassroots activists. Few historians have ventured deeply into the history of civil rights struggles after the 1970s (often misleadingly described as the “post-civil rights” era). Some recent historians have begun considering the legacy of the northern freedom struggle on early politics, especially the election of Barack Obama and rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. As long as racial inequality persists, as long as the struggle for justice continues, the history of the northern freedom struggle will remain urgent.72"
