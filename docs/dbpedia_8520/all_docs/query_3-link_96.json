Read further to learn about our rates, schedules, Parallel Transit, and special services.\n\nNews Items, Service Updates, Changes and Policies\n\nAugust 13, 2024 - Stratford Transit School Specials for 2024/2025\n\nFor the more than 400,000 students we transport yearly, Stratford Transit provides School Special buses weekday mornings and afternoons for Stratford District Secondary School, and St. Michael Catholic Secondary School. Those buses leave from the Terminal and travel to the schools starting in the morning at 7:25 a.m. until 8:45 a.m.\n\nBased on the current student information made available at time of publishing, an updated schedule has been developed in anticipation of ridership volumes. Both the AM and PM Specials will continue as they have in the past with the exception of one less school special, and will travel a few minutes ahead of the scheduled routes.\n\nThe #1 Special (East End/Devon), #3 Special (Queensland/Downie) will arrive at 2:50pm at SDSS at the Oakdale Ave bus stop. Specials #1 and #3 will arrive at St. Michael’s at 3:05pm.\n\nPlease continue to review our School Special and Service Updates and Changes section as these routes could possibly be adjusted frequently over time based on ridership statistics.\n\nFor further information regarding School Specials please call 519-271-0250 extension 405.\n\nApril 2, 2024 - City of Stratford Partners with Magnusmode to introduce customized MagnusCards\n\nThe City of Stratford has partnered with Magnusmode to enchance accessibility by introducing customized MagnusCards.\n\nTransit users can utilize the MagnusCards app to access customized MagnusCards that will cover the following topics:\n\nHow to Buy Transit Fares on Your Mobile App: Simplifying the process of purchasing transit fares using your mobile device, ensuring a seamless experience for all passengers.\n\nWaiting for the Bus to Arrive: Offering valuable tips and strategies for efficiently navigating the wait time at bus stops, enhancing the overall transit experience.\n\nHow to Ride a Bus: Offering step-by-step guidance on boarding, seating, and disembarking from buses, empowering passengers with the knowledge they need to travel confidently.\n\nRiding a Bus with Your Mobility Device: Ensuring accessibility for all by offering comprehensive guidance on safely and comfortably using mobility devices while riding our buses.\n\nRiding the Bus on Weekends: Transit on Demand - Introducing passengers to our innovative transit-on-demand service available on weekends, offering flexible and convenient travel options.\n\nFor more information and to access these customized MagnusCards, please visit magnusmode.com or download the MagnusCards app on your IOS or Android devices.\n\nJuly 8, 2022 - Stratford Transit Introducing Electronic Fare Option\n\nStarting July 18, Stratford Transit will introduce an additional option to pay for Transit fares, using your mobile device.\n\nThe HotSpot app, which is currently used to pay for parking within the City, now includes an electronic feature to pay for Transit fares.

Offer your seat to someone who needs it more than you.\n\nThe Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA) requires businesses and organizations to provide accessible services to people with disabilities. The goal is for Ontario to be fully accessible by 2025.\n\nThe Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (IASR, 191-11), is a standard developed under the AODA which includes 80 accessibility standards relating to transportation, employment, and information and communications. Compliance dates set out in the IASR range from July 2011 through January 2021.\n\nIn compliance with Section 49 of Regulation 191-11, Ontario's public transit authorities now provide Priority seating designated for use by passengers with disabilities.\n\nTransit authorities recognize there are other customers who would also benefit from having a seat near the front of the bus. A Courtesy seating area has been designated for seniors, expectant mothers, adults travelling with infants/small children or any other customer who may benefit from a seat near the front of the bus.\n\nPriority Seating\n\nPriority Seating is for the use of passengers with a disability. These seats are located close to the front of the vehicle. Customers are expected to respect and obey the purpose of the designated seating area, which means if you are sitting in one of these designated seats, you MUST vacate the seat for a passenger with a disability.\n\nPlease note:\n\nA person with a disability occupying a Priority seat is not required to move for another customer with a disability. Use of these seats is on a first come-first served basis.\n\nYou are not required or expected to leave a transit vehicle in order to make room for a customer with a disability.\n\nBus drivers/operators will not intervene to enforce the requirement. We ask, however, that you show consideration for those whose need is greater than your own.\n\nCourtesy Seating\n\nCourtesy Seating is intended to provide additional seating for people who will benefit from having a seat near the front of the vehicle including:\n\nSeniors\n\nExpectant mothers\n\nAdults travelling with infants or small children\n\nAny other passenger who may benefit from a seat.\n\nIf you are sitting in one of these designated seats, please respect its purpose and give up your seat to those who need it.\n\nPlease note: Drivers/operators will not enforce this requirement or intervene in any dispute related to Courtesy Seating. We ask, however, that you respect this designated seating area and show consideration for those whose need is greater than your own.\n\nBack to top\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhy are there both Priority Seating and Courtesy Seating areas on a bus? The Priority Seating area is a regulatory requirement under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. The Courtesy Seating area is provided in addition to the Priority Seating area for passengers who may benefit from a seat, but do not have a disability. I am a passenger with a disability. What do I do if the Priority Seating area is full when I board the bus? Politely remind the customers seated in the Priority Seating area of its intended use and ask that they make room for you. What do I do if the passengers seated in the Priority Seating area refuse to move for me? Please remember that passengers in the Priority Seating area may suffer from a disability that is not easily recognized by others and they may not be comfortable discussing it in public. If the passengers in the Priority Seating area do not move when requested, proceed to the Courtesy Seating area to find a seat. The Priority Seating decal states that other passengers MUST vacate for a passenger with a disability. If someone refuses to move for a passenger with a disability, who will make them obey the sign? The wording on the decal is a legal requirement under Regulation 191-11 but the Regulation does not provide any reference to enforcement. Given the vast number and varying degree of disabilities, many of which are invisible, it would be extremely difficult for a third party to determine who is more entitled to the Priority Seating area. As such, we expect customers to do the right thing. Drivers/operators will not intervene in a dispute between passengers regarding a seat.I am a person with a disability. When I board a bus which is full and people are both seated and standing in the Priority Seating area, do other passengers need to vacate the bus to make room for me in the Priority Seating area? No. Public transit is first come, first served. Other passengers who have paid a fare are not expected to vacate the bus to make room for other passengers. If you are not comfortable completing your trip without a seat, please wait for the next bus."
