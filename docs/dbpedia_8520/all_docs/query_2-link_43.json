        "text": "Archive\n\nReader Comments About DarkeJournal\n\nThanks to your wonderful “for sale” and “garage sale” section. I have used both successfully. Keep up the great reporting.\n\nFrom someone who used the unclassifieds: \"Thanks to DJ we rented [out] the house!\"\n\nWe understand your site really has the best coverage for our county.\n\nDarke Journal is a great website. We kept up with the weather and all the local news on a recent trip. Keep up the GREAT WORK.\n\nKeep up the excellent work with the site. Its refreshing to have such a glowing forum for thought and info in the area!\n\nI'm a huge fan of Darke Journal - thanks for providing this website/email information for the community.\n\nI think we can all agree, this is the best site of its kind for Darke County by far.\n\nYour web site has been a great advertising place for our programs ... we always receive lots of calls. Thanks for all you do.\n\nMust say I think you have done a really great job with the site.\n\nYour web site is such a benefit to the community.\n\n......the journal ROCKS!!!!!\n\nThanks for all your help. Darke Journal is the number one source for Darke County community news.\n\nI have truly enjoyed keeping up with the Darke County news, but the constant reporting on conservative causes is totally inappropriate.\n\nDarke Journal is sure on top of everything.\n\nI really appreciate you running and bumping the garage sale ad over the last few days. My son and I had a really successful sale, and your site was a big help in making that happen (many people told us that they heard about it through DJ).\n\nI am a huge fan of your website. It brings more useful information than the newspaper does and even though I am attending college and am away from home, I still check out your website about once a day to keep up on local events.\n\nI just love your website. It's better than any newspaper or TV program. Keep up the good work.\n\nI like the DJ because it just gives the facts pure and simple. I also like to read what the readers think. You keep up the good work & you will grow!\n\nI am so glad that I found this site. It is so nice to have such an upbeat & unbiased Darke County news. I look forward to checking it each day. I just found it this month. Plus, I can feel free to voice my concerns on issues. Great web site!\n\nWhen I turn on my computer in the morning, I check the weather and Darke Journal before anything else. Thank you for the pix & info on this site. It's nice to know what's going on in our great Darke County.\n\nYou are doing a great service and this is a great media outlet!\n\nIt just gets better and better! Truly, the 'mix' is what makes it so good for all readers.\n\nDJ = nice guy, but should relinquish his website duties.\n\nThis is a wonderful site! I am so glad there is a place in this community where people can voice their opinion about issues. In the past for many years this community seems to be run by so called political people with others hiding in the brush waiting to inform their leaders of those who disagree with an issue on hand, just so they can point them out and try to ruin their life. Again I am so glad finally, an average Joe can make an Anonymous posted opinion and not fear that they will be pointed at or looked down for stating how they feel. Thank you D. J.\n\nIt’s better than most of the media available in and around Darke County.\n\nThe web site has had steadily increasing viewership over the last year or two and, at least in my opinion, has become a major player in getting news and commentary to Darke Countians.\n\nYour site is not a freaking jungle."
