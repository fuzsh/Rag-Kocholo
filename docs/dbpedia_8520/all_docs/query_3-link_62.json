        "text": "RAMIN BAHRANI\n\nWriter/Director Ramin Bahrani's films have premiered and screened at such festivals as Venice, Cannes, Sundance, Berlin and Toronto. He has won numerous awards such as the FIPRESCI prize for best film (MAN PUSH CART, London; GOODBYE SOLO, Venice), the \"Someone to Watch\" Independent Spirit Award (CHOP SHOP), and was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship. He collaborated with Werner Herzog on his short film PLASTIC BAG and recently directed a music video for Sigur Rós. In 2010 Legendary American film critic Roger Ebert proclaimed Bahrani as \"the director of the decade.\"\n\nHis new film, AT ANY PRICE (Dennis Quaid, Zac Efron) premiered in the main competition at the Venice Film Festival where it was nominated for the Golden Lion, and also screened as official selections of The Telluride (2012) and Toronto Film Festivals (2012).\n\nJANE BERLINER\n\nAfter growing up in Beverly Hills to a non-entertainment couple, Jane stepped on a stage joining the all female band The Quisinarts, was a college DJ featuring New Wave and punk music and fell into the entertainment business on her own. As she attended UCLA's theater arts school, she worked with Tim Robbins, Dana Stevens, Shane Black and countless other now successful film and tv artists.\n\nJane found her art after attending the CAA mailroom and training under Ron Meyer. She became a talent agent in 1987 and has been in the entertainment business ever since. After enjoying a talent agent's career for almost 20 years, Jane turned to Handprint Entertainment to head up Benny Medina's production company. Jane then moved to New York and started working in philanthropy with Save the Children, creating and managing their Artist Ambassador Program, which she did for four years before joining Authentic as a talent manager.\n\nHaving been on the ground with artist ambassadors in Africa, Guatemala and the US, Jane is uniquely qualified to manage artists' philanthropy and to consult NGOs in the proper use of celebrity.\n\nEFFIE T. BROWN\n\nLos Angeles based producer Effie T. Brown received a degree in Film Production and Theater from Loyola Marymount University before going on to participate in Film Independent’s Project Involve. There, she quickly worked her way up to become the Director of Development for Tim Burton Productions in 1995.\n\nEager to try her hand at producing, Brown landed assignments as Line Producer on feature films including Desert Blue (1998), But I’m a Cheerleader (1999) and Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her (2000).

Her most recent film The Inheritance starring Golden Brooks won Best Actress at the 2010 American Black Film Festival.\n\nAs stated in VARIETY, Effie T. Brown “is a case study of what it takes to get independent films off the ground in today’s marketplace: large doses of private equity, some location incentives and a little help from fests and script labs...”\n\nRecently, Brown has re-teamed with the award winning producing/directing team of Jon Avnet and Rodrigo Garcia to produce WIGS, a brand new original content channel for Google/YOUTUBE. The channel premiered in May of 2012, with production of the second season currently underway.
