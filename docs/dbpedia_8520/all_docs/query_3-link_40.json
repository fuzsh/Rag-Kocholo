The class partnered with Bad Monkey in West Ocean City where they learned how to make and bake the bread. At the end of the Bread Sale, the students counted the money they raised ($388.87) and donated the proceeds to AGH.\n\nFounded in 1970, WPS is a private, independent Pre-Kindergarten through Grade 12 School, located in Berlin, Maryland.

About 95% of these shoes wind up in landfills and those take an average of 30 to 40 years to decompose.\n\nJames brought forward the Shoe Drive as a joint effort between the WPS Volunteer Club and the Environmental Club. He proposed the idea as a way to not only reduce the number of shoes in landfills but also help educate classmates on the impact that throwing shoes away can have on the environment. In addition, his project helped to reinforce the school’s theme for this year; IMPACT. By collecting and sorting these donations, these students are making an impact on the environment and those in need.\n\nThe shoes collected were sorted into poor or fair condition.
