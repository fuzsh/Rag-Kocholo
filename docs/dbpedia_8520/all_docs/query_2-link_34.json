I have worked with providers for almost 20 years both as a nurse and doing billing but let me tell you this provider truly impressed me. No, he actually exceeded my expectations of what going above and beyond for the patient (and parent) is. He took the time to explain to us the possible treatment plan, took the time to recognize we were self pay and added information for me to have resources even without asking. He took the time to notice my son was special needs and that verbalizing his symptoms was hard, he then acknowledged him for being able to do so well during his first visit. After all this he addressed all my concerns as well as allow my son to ask any questions. My son and I both left there extremely happy, relieved, and hopeful for a positive outcome.

To never let anyone else do the same.\n\nAmazing office and doctor!\n\nDr Foreman was so kind and easy to talk to. He made my teen daughter feel comfortable and she left feeling a lot better about her situation.\n\nHaving the option for telemedicine was fantastic because we live 2 hours away from this clinic and this was a follow up consisting solely of discussion.
