        "text": "Introduction\n\nOn August 2, 2022, Kansas voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have written abortion protections out of the state constitution. Three days later, Indiana passed and signed into law one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the country.\n\nThese events occurred less than two months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, once the twin pillars of the Court’s abortion jurisprudence, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. And, because both events were framed in public debates as referenda on Dobbs and the future of reproductive rights, some commentators suggested that these developments vindicated the Dobbs majority’s assertion that “[i]t is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.”\n\nIt is unsurprising that these two events would prompt such a response. After all, Justice Alito’s majority opinion in Dobbs maintained that the political process was the proper venue for resolving the competing interests at stake in the abortion debate. On the majority’s telling, its decision laying waste to nearly fifty years’ worth of precedent was a necessary corrective to an egregious act of judicial overreach. According to the Dobbs majority, the Court in Roe and Casey had stripped the American people of “the power to address a question of profound moral and social importance.” In so doing, it had “short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who dissented” from these two decisions.\n\nDespite this lofty talk of returning the abortion question “to the people,” the Dobbs majority’s conception of democracy quickly collapses upon close examination. The rhetoric of democracy in Dobbs is both revealing and hollow: it is revealing in that its paeans to democracy flow from strategic choices made in the political sphere about how to criticize and delegitimize the Court’s abortion jurisprudence, as well as from scholarly critiques of Roe; it is hollow in that the conception of democracy it displays is profoundly limited. Indeed, some might argue that the majority’s invocation of the values and vernacular of democracy is at once instrumental and cynical. That is, the Dobbs majority’s interest in returning the abortion question to the American people was likely not in service of the settlement of a vexed and contentious issue. Rather, the majority’s insistence on democratic deliberation may simply be a way station en route to the pro-life movement’s desired resolution: the complete abolition of legal abortion.\n\nThe Article proceeds in five parts. Part I provides an intellectual history of the democratic deliberation argument, tracing the emergence and evolution of the rhetoric of democratic deliberation in the Court’s abortion cases. As we note, although the rhetoric of democratic deliberation is briefly glimpsed in the dissenting opinions in 1973’s Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton and 1992’s Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, the bulk of the initial criticism of these decisions took aim at the Court’s conception of the rights at stake. Put differently, the initial critique of Roe and its recognition of the abortion right — in and outside of the Court — was not about the decision’s disruption of democratic deliberation, but rather about its misapprehension of the nature of fundamental rights.\n\nIn time, as the Court’s personnel changed, social movement mobilization in opposition to abortion intensified, and new scholarly critiques of Roe and abortion rights emerged, the arguments against Roe evolved. Rather than focusing principally on the Court’s misunderstanding of fundamental rights, Roe skeptics (on and off the Court) began to embrace and advance the democracy-grounded arguments that once had been peripheral in abortion discourse. On this emerging account, Roe’s fatal flaw was not simply that it misunderstood fundamental rights; instead, Roe was wrong because it imposed the Court’s policy preferences on the country, wresting the abortion issue from state legislatures, which were in the process of resolving these disputes.\n\nAfter tracing the intellectual history of the democratic deliberation argument in and outside of the Court, Part II considers the jurisprudential implications of the Dobbs Court’s association of Roe with disrupted democratic deliberation. As we explain, the Dobbs Court’s reiteration of the disrupted democratic deliberation narrative went beyond simply justifying overruling Roe and Casey; it also fundamentally altered the scope and substance of the stare decisis calculus. Under Casey, courts were required to consider a range of factors, including the decision’s workability and the quality of its reasoning, in determining whether to depart from an existing precedent. They could also consider whether there is a “convincing justification” that warrants a break from long-standing precedent. On one level, the Dobbs Court’s emphasis on democratic deliberation may simply have created a new justification: the existence of ongoing popular debate on an issue of “profound moral and social importance” about which there exists a “national controversy.” On another level, however, the Dobbs Court’s focus on democratic deliberation may have signaled its willingness to bypass conventional stare decisis analysis altogether if it views a precedent as so contentious and divisive that the underlying question should be decided through the political process, rather than through judicial resolution.\n\nHaving established the Dobbs Court’s interest in democratic deliberation, Parts III and IV pivot to consider the strength of this commitment to democracy. Part III first challenges the Court’s apparent conception of democracy. It then examines both the specific ways the majority opinion invoked the prospect of democratic deliberation, and the deep democratic myopia that undergirded the opinion’s assessment of the current electoral landscape. As we explain, this myopia assumed different forms. First, the Court displayed a crabbed understanding of the venues and contexts in which democratic deliberation occurs, treating democracy as coextensive with state legislative activity and rendering invisible state courts, state executives, the federal government, local officials, and mechanisms of direct democracy. Second, the Court imagined the democracy it sought to facilitate as unidirectional, producing more restrictive, rather than more protective, abortion policies. Third, the Court’s discussion of women’s political participation suggested that political power can be measured by voter turnout alone, overlooking critical metrics like representation in electoral office and in the ecosystem of campaign finance. Finally, the historical method the Court announced and deployed to determine whether the abortion right is constitutionally protected links contemporary constitutional meaning to positive law enacted by a polity in which women and most people of color were utterly absent — an interpretive method that belies any meaningful commitment to democracy.\n\nAfter identifying these deficits in the Dobbs Court’s discussion of democracy, Part IV considers the Court’s actual commitment to the pros­pect of democratic deliberation. As we explain, the Court’s insistence on returning abortion to the people for democratic deliberation stands in stark contrast to its recent decisions actively distorting and disrupting the democratic landscape to which the Court now consigns the abortion question. To this end, this Part also considers the ways in which the Court routinely — and selectively — gestures to the political process and democratic debate as a means of avoiding judicial interventions that would secure the rights and status of underrepresented groups.\n\nFinally, Part V comes full circle to consider the Court, Dobbs, and the relationship between democracy and judicial review. Here, we argue that the Court’s invocation of democracy and democratic deliberation in Dobbs serves both rhetorical and substantive ends. In terms of rhetoric, the appeal to democracy and democratic engagement allows the majority to avoid claims of judicial activism and overreach. Substantively, however, the interest in democratic values may be more profound. As we explain, woven throughout the opinion’s appeals to democracy and democratic deliberation are nods to the interests of the fetus and unborn life. With this in mind, we maintain that the majority’s interest in democracy and democratic deliberation may serve to scaffold an argument that posits the fetus as an entity with constitutional interests that the Court is obliged to protect.\n\nTaken together, this Article’s excavation of the intellectual history of democracy-oriented arguments, in tandem with its discussion of the Dobbs Court’s shallow and myopic commitment to democracy, make plain that Dobbs cannot be genuinely understood to rest on or to further democratic engagement, as the majority insists. Instead, the majority’s invocation of democracy is yet another discursive move that deploys the vernacular and values of democracy for other ends.\n\nI. The Evolution of an Argument\n\nThe majority opinion in Dobbs made much of the notion that Roe v. Wade disrupted ongoing state-level debate over abortion rights. Moreover, according to Justice Alito, Roe’s critics immediately assailed the decision on the ground that it usurped the role of the people, substituting judicial judgment for democratic engagement on a fraught and divisive social issue. Critically, this notion of disrupted democratic engagement ostensibly undergirds much of the majority’s disdain for Roe — and ultimately, its overruling of this nearly fifty-year-old precedent.\n\nThe view that Roe disrupted ongoing democratic debate over abortion rights has long been part of the conventional wisdom around Roe. Most, including the Dobbs majority, accept unquestioningly the account that from the start, Roe was understood as removing the abortion question from the people, who were in the throes of debating the issue for themselves.\n\nBut is this conventional wisdom correct? In the sections that follow, we trace the intellectual history of the disrupted democratic deliberation argument. As we show, although this narrative briefly surfaced in the dissents to Roe v. Wade and Roe’s companion case Doe v. Bolton, it receded almost immediately as critics focused instead on Roe’s logic vis-à-vis the identification of fundamental rights. It was only later, amidst changes in the Court’s personnel, new scholarly critiques, and new grassroots mobilization against abortion, that the narrative of disrupted democratic deliberation took root and flourished as a core objection to Roe and the right it recognized.\n\nA. Roe’s Immediate Aftermath\n\nAlthough it will be remembered as an embattled decision, Roe v. Wade, when it was decided in 1973, reflected relative consensus among the Court’s members. Authored by a Republican appointee, Justice Blackmun, Roe was decided on a 7–2 vote in which both Republican- and Democratic-appointed Justices were in the majority. The dissenting contingent was also bipartisan in nature. Then-Justice Rehnquist, a recent Nixon appointee, objected to both the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction over the case and the majority’s conclusion that abortion was protected as a component of the right to privacy. But Justice Rehnquist’s dissenting opinion gestured only vaguely to the prospect of democracy and popular deliberation, noting debate and “changing” views on abortion and linking the majority’s decision in Roe to Lochner v. New York, a 1905 decision in which the Court invalidated a New York progressive labor law. In 1973, as today, Lochner was widely discredited as anticanonical; although, as Professor Jamal Greene has noted, “the consensus over Lochner’s wrongness obscures deep disagreement over why it is wrong.”\n\nJustice White, a Kennedy appointee, penned a dissent — joined by Justice Rehnquist — opposing both Roe and its companion case, Doe v. Bolton. In that dissent, Justice White invoked democracy more directly. According to Justice White, the majority’s decision in Roe was a stunning exercise of judicial overreach, stripping “the people and the legislatures of the 50 States” of the opportunity “to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand.” The Roe Court’s “exercise of its clear power of choice” was particularly egregious “[i]n a sensitive area such as [abortion], involving as it does issues over which reasonable men may easily and heatedly differ.” In Justice White’s view, such a contested — and contestable — issue “should be left with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs.”\n\nBut to be clear, in the immediate aftermath of Roe, Justice White was largely alone in voicing concern that the Roe Court had usurped an issue best left to the legislatures and to the people. And in the years immediately following Roe, Justice White’s concerns about democratic deliberation appeared to recede as the Court’s Roe skeptics focused on cabining the decision’s reach. Three years after Roe, the Court’s decision in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, invalidating portions of a Missouri abortion statute, prompted few objections that explicitly sounded in the register of democratic deliberation. Certainly, some members of the Court maintained that the parental-consent requirement challenged in Danforth was within the state legislature’s purview to weigh and enact. But, critically, even as members of the Court acknowledged the legislature’s authority to regulate the provision of abortion services, no Justice raised the view that Roe was illegitimate because it improperly disrupted democratic debate on the abortion question. Likewise, in his partial dissent in Danforth, in which Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist joined, Justice White emphasized the state’s authority, even in the face of the interests protected in Roe, to enact the challenged laws. He did not reiterate his earlier position that Roe deprived the people of the opportunity to decide the issue for themselves.\n\nCritically, the notion that Roe’s fatal flaw was its disruption of ongoing democratic deliberation was also not explicit in the academic responses offered in the decision’s immediate aftermath. To be sure, Roe sparked considerable debate among legal scholars, including, famously, Professor John Hart Ely’s Yale Law Journal essay, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade (Wages). But despite the Dobbs majority’s reference to the essay as evidence that Roe drew immediate criticism, in fact, Ely’s critique largely focused on the constitutional basis for the Court’s decision regarding the fundamental nature of the abortion right, the Court’s failure to appropriately weigh the state’s interest in protecting fetal life, and its disregard for the separation of powers. Only later did Ely shift his focus from fundamental rights and state regulatory authority to consider Roe’s implications for democratic deliberation.\n\nIn Wages, Ely charged the Roe Court with creating “this super-protected right [that] is not inferable from the language of the Constitution, the framers’ thinking respecting the specific problem in issue, any general value derivable from the provisions they included, or the nation’s governmental structure.” Ely focused far more on the perceived weakness in the opinion’s reasoning than on its disruption of democratic debate and engagement. And while Ely noted that the Roe majority had improperly “second-guess[ed] legislative balances,” even that brief nod to the legislature appeared to conflate legislative regulatory action with democratic deliberation. But critically, the view that Roe allowed the Court to substitute its policy preferences for legislative action does not squarely encompass the view, later articulated in Dobbs, that Roe’s critical flaw was that it disrupted popular debate on the issue.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Roe, other scholarly critics likewise gestured only vaguely at the notion that the Court’s decision foreclosed popular debate on the abortion question. Reflecting on Roe in the Supreme Court Review, Professor Richard Epstein focused on the Roe majority’s effort to balance the woman’s interest in terminating a pregnancy against the prospect of fetal life. It was only in the final paragraph of his twenty-six-page article that Epstein nodded toward democratic deliberation, questioning why the Court would devote so many decisions to “insur[ing] that the political process will be . . . open and fair” only to circumvent state governments who were “responsive to the majority of [their] citizens.” Such efforts to enhance democratic participation, Epstein mused, were likely unnecessary in the face of the kind of judicial imperialism that Roe reflected.\n\nTo be sure, these early critics’ focus on countermajoritarianism and the identification of fundamental rights undergirded a broader institutional critique that sounded in the register of popular sovereignty: that, in issuing a decision that recognized a fundamental right to abortion, the Court removed the question from the legislative process and insulated the newly recognized right from public objections. Still, in Roe’s immediate aftermath, much of the judicial and scholarly criticism was less than explicit in its objection to frustrated democratic deliberation, focusing instead on the opinion’s reasoning as to the scope and substance of fundamental rights. Though commentators nodded at the prospect of democratic deliberation, it was principally in the context of judicial imperialism in the denomination of fundamental rights. Indeed, it would take roughly ten years for the critique of Roe as disrupting ongoing democratic deliberation on the abortion issue to surface concretely.\n\nB. The Emergence of the Democratic Deliberation Argument\n\nShades of the democratic deliberation argument emerged in fits and starts in the years following Roe. And intriguingly, the interest in majoritarian deliberation of abortion policies and restrictions was most evident in the context of cases involving public funding for abortion services. In cases like Maher v. Roe and Harris v. McRae, both of which concerned the use of public funds for abortion services, briefs filed in support of the government policies emphasized the legislature’s critical role in translating the public’s preferences on abortion into public policy.\n\nBy the time the most robust articulation of the democratic deliberation narrative surfaced again, it was ten years after Roe. In that decade, the membership of the Court changed. Justices Douglas and Stewart, who had been in the Roe majority, retired and were replaced by Justices Stevens and O’Connor. As importantly, backlash against Roe had begun to emerge as antiabortion mobilization intensified. The Court’s consideration of City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc. (Akron I), would reflect these changes on and off the court.\n\nThe Court in Akron I struck down a requirement that all second-trimester abortions be performed in hospitals, while sustaining several other abortion regulations. Although the Court invalidated the challenged restriction, the decision prompted a spirited dissent from Justice O’Connor, a new Reagan appointee. Joined by Justices White and Rehnquist, the Roe dissenters, Justice O’Connor denounced Roe’s trimester framework as “unworkable,” and accused the majority of using analysis “inconsistent both with the methods of analysis employed in previous cases dealing with abortion, and with the Court’s approach to fundamental rights in other areas.” In addition to these concerns about Roe’s reasoning and logic, Justice O’Connor, herself a former state legislator, resurrected Justice White’s earlier view that when presented “with extremely sensitive issues,” like abortion, “the appropriate forum for their resolution . . . is the legislature. We should not forget that ‘legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.’”\n\nPerhaps buoyed by the growing number of Roe skeptics on the Court, Justice White waded back into the fray to press the point that Roe usurped state legislatures’ authority to decide the contested abortion issue — and to connect democratic deliberation to a more controversial point regarding the Court’s duty to adhere to past precedents. Dissenting from the Court’s decision in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists invalidating several provisions of Pennsylvania’s abortion law, Justice White reiterated his view that Roe “‘departs from a proper understanding’ of the Constitution.” But meaningfully, he also went further to make the case that stare decisis was not required in circumstances like Roe, where the decision “involve[s] our assumed power to set aside on grounds of unconstitutionality a state or federal statute representing the democratically expressed will of the people.” As Justice White explained, decisions like Roe, which identified an unenumerated right to choose an abortion, “find in the Constitution principles or values that cannot fairly be read into that document,” and in so doing, “usurp the people’s authority, for such decisions represent choices that the people have never made and that they cannot disavow through corrective legislation.” In such circumstances, Justice White mused, “it is essential that this Court maintain the power to restore authority to its proper possessors by correcting constitutional decisions that, on reconsideration, are found to be mistaken.”\n\nBut if Justice White believed that stare decisis was not an inexorable command in circumstances where a decision intruded upon the prerogatives of the people and their representatives, other members of the Court were less convinced. Responding to Justice White’s assertion that “hotly contested moral and political issue[s] . . . are to be resolved by the will of the people,” Justice Stevens lodged an objection to unfettered majority rule. Recalling Justice White’s earlier vote to invalidate Connecticut’s contraceptive ban in Griswold v. Connecticut, Justice Stevens noted that abortion, like contraception before it, entailed issues “traditionally associated with the ‘sensitive areas of liberty’ protected by the Constitution.” In circumstances involving such sensitive issues, Justice Stevens maintained, “no individual should be compelled to surrender the freedom to make that decision for herself simply because her ‘value preferences’ are not shared by the majority.” That “the ‘abortion decision’ should be made . . . by the majority ‘in the unrestrained imposition of its own, extraconstitutional value preferences,’” was in Justice Stevens’s view, a perversion of the Framers’ intent. After all, he mused, “the lawmakers who placed a special premium on the protection of individual liberty have recognized that certain values are more important than the will of a transient majority.”\n\nStill, despite Justice Stevens’s concerns, others endorsed Justice White’s view that abortion was a sensitive issue best suited for democratic deliberation — and that Roe, because it effectively deprived the people of their right to decide the issue through majoritarian politics, was not entitled to ordinary stare decisis effect. In its brief in Thornburgh in support of Pennsylvania, the United States made the point plain. Stare decisis, it explained, “does not count so strongly” in circumstances “[w]here a judicial formulation affecting the allocation of constitutional powers has proven ‘unsound in principle and unworkable in practice,’ [and] where it ‘leads to inconsistent results at the same time that it disserves principles of democratic self-governance.’”\n\nA few years later, in cases like Webster v. Reproductive Health Services and Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health (Akron II), Justice Scalia, another new Reagan appointee, articulated a related critique of Roe grounded in democratic deliberation. In Webster, decided in 1989, Justice Scalia wrote separately to emphasize that abortion was “a political issue” — and one that “continuously distorts the public perception of the role of this Court.” As a result of Roe, Justice Scalia lamented, the Court was flooded with “carts full of mail from the public, and streets full of demonstrators, urging us — their unelected and life-tenured judges who have been awarded those extraordinary, undemocratic characteristics precisely in order that we might follow the law despite the popular will — to follow the popular will.” To Justice Scalia, Roe — and judicial resolution of issues properly reserved to the political process — risked upending the Court’s institutional role, rendering it merely an adjunct of majoritarian politics. On this account, the Court’s uneasy settlement of the abortion question only provoked more public outcry — and challenges to the Court’s authority. A year later, in Akron II, Justice Scalia made the point more emphatically. Leaving the vexed question of abortion to the people was, he maintained, the only way to “produce compromises satisfying a sufficient mass of the electorate that this deeply felt issue will cease distorting the remainder of our democratic process.” With this in mind, Justice Scalia urged his colleagues to “end [the Court’s] disruptive intrusion into this field as soon as possible.”\n\nBy the time the Court revisited the question of Roe’s continued precedential value in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, the issue of democratic deliberation was front and center in the arguments and decisionmaking. In a lengthy dissent from the plurality opinion reaffirming Roe, Justice Scalia elaborated Justice White’s view of democratic deliberation. Abortion, Justice Scalia insisted, was an issue best left to the people: “The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.” But critically, Justice Scalia went further than Justice White, crafting an argument that Roe had not only wrongfully preempted democratic deliberation on a contested issue, but also, in so doing, provoked a national controversy “by elevating [the abortion question] to the national level where it is infinitely more difficult to resolve.” As Justice Scalia explained, in stark contrast to abortion, the Court had left other contested issues, like the death penalty, to the states and the people — resulting in durable policy compromises that were “worked out at the state level.” By virtue of the Court’s intervention, abortion now assumed national significance, eluding the kind of stable “state-by-state resolution” that characterized these other controversial questions. This stalemate, Justice Scalia insisted, was a direct result of the Roe Court’s wrongheaded intervention. “Pre-Roe . . . political compromise was possible.”\n\nBut if Justice Scalia viewed Roe — and Casey — as precluding popular resolution of a divisive issue, the Casey majority maintained that other popular concerns counseled in favor of retaining Roe and the abortion right. According to the plurality, discarding the principle of stare decisis and overruling Roe would weaken the Court’s legitimacy in the eyes of the public. And “[u]nlike the political branches, a Court thus weakened could not seek to regain its position with a new mandate from the voters,” as “the loss of its principled character could not be retrieved by the casting of so many votes.” Moreover, to the extent that those seeking to overrule Roe emphasized the decision’s impact on “the people,” the plurality noted that “for two decades . . . people have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail.” Though the plurality found it difficult to determine with specificity the reliance interests inherent in Roe, it made clear that there would be costs to overruling the decision “for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case.”\n\nAlthough Justice Scalia did not carry the day in Casey, his objections to Roe were easily translated into — and adopted by other conservative Justices in — the disposition of other controversial culture-war issues, including the legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2015’s Obergefell v. Hodges, a 5–4 decision announcing constitutional protection for same-sex marriage, Justice Scalia bemoaned the Court’s decision expanding the right to marry to include same-sex couples. “Until the courts put a stop to it,” he lamented, “public debate over same-sex marriage displayed American democracy at its best.”\n\nJustice Scalia was not alone on this front. The Chief Justice and Justices Thomas and Alito also raised the issue of frustrated democratic deliberation in the context of the marriage equality debate. Notably, Chief Justice Roberts underscored his interest in democratic deliberation with a pointed reference to the work of another “thoughtful commentator.” In a 1985 article in the North Carolina Law Review, then-Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg famously offered two critiques of the Roe decision: (1) that the Court had moved too aggressively to invalidate all criminal abortion statutes, preempting popular debate and provoking backlash; and (2) that the Court’s understanding of the constitutional rights at stake was too narrowly focused on the privacy of the pregnant woman and the medical judgment of her physician, and failed to consider the equality dimensions of the abortion question. Now that then-Judge Ginsburg was a member of the Court — and one of the five Justices who had voted to legalize same-sex marriage — the invocation of her earlier writing was both strategic and substantive. Pointedly ignoring Judge Ginsburg’s meditation on equality as a doctrinal home for the abortion right, Chief Justice Roberts instead focused on her observation that, prior to Roe, “[t]he political process was moving . . . [and] majoritarian institutions were listening and acting.” The Court’s imperialism, then-Judge Ginsburg mused — and Chief Justice Roberts agreed — “was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, conflict.”\n\nScholars like Professors Reva Siegel and Linda Greenhouse have disputed then-Judge Ginsburg’s assessment of pre-Roe progress on abortion liberalization. As they maintain, the landscape for democratic change was far more complicated than then-Judge Ginsburg’s description suggested. And tellingly, despite her critique, as a member of the Court, Justice Ginsburg consistently voted to maintain the right to access abortion and contraception, linking reproductive freedom to women’s equal citizenship. Likewise, on the question of same-sex marriage, Justice Ginsburg joined Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion in Obergefell, which noted that “democracy is the appropriate process for change” but only “so long as that process does not abridge fundamental rights.” The opinion also observed that within our constitutional scheme, “individuals need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right.”\n\nDespite Justice Ginsburg’s nuanced position on Roe, her democratic-deliberation-inflected critique of the decision has loomed large in both conservative and mainstream legal discourse. Professor Jeffrey Rosen, for example, embraced, as then-Judge Ginsburg did, the equality dimensions of the abortion right, even as he decried the Roe Court’s “aggressive unilateralism.” Professor Cass Sunstein suggested that Roe “may well have created the Moral Majority, helped defeat the equal rights amendment, and undermined the women’s movement by spurring opposition and demobilizing potential adherents.” Meaningfully, Sunstein also repeated the claim that a more durable state legislative resolution of the abortion question was in the offing when Roe short-circuited the process of democratic deliberation. As he explained in a law review article published as the Court was preparing to reconsider the abortion right in Casey, “Roe may have taken national policy too abruptly to a point toward which it was groping more slowly, and in the process may have prevented state legislatures from working out long-lasting solutions based upon broad public consensus.”\n\nThis strain of Justice Ginsburg’s critique of Roe enjoyed pride of place in the majority’s disposition of Dobbs. Justice Alito, who cited few women authors in a decision that would affect countless women, cited then-Judge Ginsburg with obvious relish for the proposition that Roe improperly intervened in an ongoing popular debate, “spark[ing] a national controversy that has embittered our political culture for a half century.”\n\nBut perhaps Justice Alito doth protest too much? On his telling, Roe was not only “egregiously wrong” because it was unmoored from constitutional text; it was wrong — perhaps primarily wrong — because it improperly preempted an ongoing public debate over abortion, provoking a generation’s worth of backlash to abortion rights. However, as we have traced, much of this narrative rests on unstable foundations. First, as several scholars have suggested, the popular debate to which Justice Alito adverted was more muted than his narrative suggested. And, as we have detailed, at least initially, those who objected to the 1973 decision did so principally on the view that the decision misunderstood the nature of the rights at stake and reflected a brand of discredited judicial imperialism.\n\nSecond, the concern that Roe disrupted ongoing popular deliberation only emerged as countermobilization to abortion rights gained prominence. As scholarly and judicial critiques of Roe assumed their now-familiar contours, a related set of developments was unfolding in the antiabortion movement that had begun to coalesce in Roe’s wake. While abortion opponents were insistent on rolling back Roe with a court decision overruling the 1973 precedent, they also trained their attention on ratifying a federal constitutional amendment that would recognize and protect fetal life. These efforts to amend the Constitution primarily took the form of a so-called Human Life Amendment, which would have explicitly protected fetal life. Although some antiabortion politicians of the time introduced or proposed constitutional amendments that would have merely overturned Roe by returning the abortion question to the states, much of the organized antiabortion movement withheld its support from such efforts if they did not also recognize fetal personhood. The National Right to Life Committee, which refocused its efforts in the wake of Roe, even passed a resolution stating that “a ‘States Rights’ amendment would not effectuate . . . rejection of Roe but would rather reaffirm the Court’s decision.” As legal historian Professor Mary Ziegler explains, “most movement members did not object to the Roe decision because the Court had removed the abortion question from the democratic process”; they objected because “the Court erred in leaving the unborn without the protection they deserved.” Banning abortion nationwide, not returning the issue to the states, was the movement’s goal.\n\nIt was only when this effort to enact a constitutional amendment that would enshrine fetal personhood stalled in the late 1970s that abortion opponents adopted new strategies. One strategy — championed by a young Justice Department lawyer named Samuel Alito — involved chipping away at abortion access through regulations that made abortion increasingly difficult, expensive, or logistically complicated both to provide and to access. These efforts included state-level restrictions on abortion funding, and ultimately the Hyde Amendment, a federal appropriations rider that prohibited the use of federal funds, including Medicaid funds, for abortion, which the Court upheld in 1980.\n\nSignificantly, the scuttling of the prospect of a constitutional amendment not only altered the substantive strategic priorities of the antiabortion movement, it also transformed their discursive strategies. With hopes of a fetal-personhood amendment dashed, many antiabortion activists began making arguments that sounded in the register of democratic deliberation — the idea that Roe had involved impermissible judicial overreach, and that abortion regulation should be a matter for states to address. Critically, these arguments were part of a deliberate strategy to articulate an antiabortion position that was more politically palatable than the prospect of banning abortion in all circumstances. To be sure, for movement leaders and many Americans who identified as pro-life, the democracy argument was a second-best, intermediate position — one that was fundamentally incompatible with the substantive position that the fetus was a person, and that any process that terminated a pregnancy was tantamount to murder. From this perspective, allowing the states to decide whether to prohibit or to permit and even protect abortion was difficult to defend. But, with the prospect of a constitutional amendment well out of reach, many activists viewed this intermediate position as a necessary way station on the path that could lead first to Roe’s reversal, and then to the elimination of all protection for abortion. And so, taking the long view, the movement hitched its wagon to the north stars of democracy and popular deliberation.\n\n* * *\n\nAs this history reveals, the democratic deliberation argument that undergirded the Court’s disposition of Dobbs emerged in fits and starts, evolving and transforming over time to take its current form, which insists that Roe improperly preempted and frustrated ongoing democratic deliberation on the abortion question. To be sure, this contemporary articulation of the critique of Roe reflects essential aspects of earlier critiques, including critiques of Roe’s judicial imperialism. But the democratic deliberation argument, in its current form, is nonetheless meaningfully different from that which preceded it. Whereas the objections lodged in the immediate aftermath of Roe focused on the nature of the constitutional rights at stake and the contested nature of the abortion question, the present interest in democratic deliberation goes well beyond these concerns. As it has evolved — in tandem with the social movements opposing abortion in the wake of Roe — the democratic deliberation argument no longer objects to Roe solely on the view that the decision misidentified the right at stake and withdrew a contested issue from majoritarian politics; rather, it makes the case that, in addition to its flawed logic and incongruence with constitutional text, Roe’s countermajoritarianism is the crucial element that justifies abandoning stare decisis in order to overrule it.\n\nWith this in mind, the following Part considers the implications of the Dobbs majority’s embrace of the democratic deliberation argument for stare decisis and the consideration of extant precedents.\n\nII. Democracy and Stare Decisis\n\nIn Dobbs, the Court invoked democracy and disrupted democratic deliberation to justify its decision to overrule Roe and Casey, two long-standing precedents of the Court. Under the principle of stare decisis, courts presumptively defer to past decisions on the same, or similar, issues. And while a court may overturn its own precedent, stare decisis principles favor doing so only in the face of compelling circumstances.\n\nAs we explain here, there are at least two ways to understand the Dobbs Court’s particular moves with respect to the relationship between democracy, public opinion, and stare decisis. The first possibility is that the Court’s invocation of democracy and democratic deliberation gestures toward an entirely new standard for stare decisis — one that holds that a past precedent is not entitled to stare decisis effect where its subject matter involves an issue that the Court believes to be of high salience to the American people, and where, in the Court’s view, the precedent has interrupted the prospect of democratic deliberation of the issue. The second possibility is that an earlier decision’s arguable interruption of democratic deliberation qualifies as a “special justification” that blunts the stare decisis force of a prior opinion. We further consider each of these below. We then investigate the possible implications of the Court’s new approach to stare decisis, however it is best understood, for other important precedents.\n\nA. A New Stare Decisis Test?\n\nAlthough the Dobbs Court made plain its contempt for the core holdings of Roe and Casey, the test it employed in overturning those precedents was remarkably underspecified. The Dobbs majority criticized Casey for affirming “Roe’s ‘central holding’ based solely on the doctrine of stare decisis.” More particularly, the Dobbs majority took the view that “proper application of stare decisis required an assessment of the strength of the grounds on which Roe was based” — an inquiry that, according to the Dobbs majority, the Casey plurality failed to conduct. The Dobbs Court therefore considered afresh “the question that the Casey plurality did not consider”: whether “the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion.” Upon concluding that the right to abortion was not deeply rooted in history and tradition, and not an essential component of ordered liberty, the Dobbs majority then turned to consider explicitly the question of stare decisis. But curiously, even as the Dobbs Court repudiated Casey’s view that the Constitution protected a right to abortion, it was far less clear about what its holding meant for Casey’s other jurisprudential contribution — the test it announced for stare decisis.\n\nFor many years, Casey had supplied the canonical formulation of the Court’s approach to stare decisis. And indeed, Supreme Court nominees have signaled their commitment to judicial restraint and the rule of law by pledging fealty to the principle of stare decisis. Casey spent considerable time elaborating the role of stare decisis in its decision to retain and reaffirm Roe, explaining:\n\n[W]hen this Court reexamines a prior holding, its judgment is customarily informed by a series of prudential and pragmatic considerations designed to test the consistency of overruling a prior decision with the ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective costs of reaffirming and overruling a prior case.\n\nThe decision then proceeded to identify a series of factors that courts should consider in determining whether to defer to an extant precedent, including “practical workability,” “reliance” on the precedent, as well as any significant developments in “related principles of law,” and “whether facts have so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application or justification.” Applying this lens to Roe, the lead opinion in Casey concluded:\n\nBecause neither the factual underpinnings of Roe’s central holding nor our understanding of it has changed (and because no other indication of weakened precedent has been shown), the Court could not pretend to be reexamining the prior law with any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of 1973.\n\nMoreover, the Casey opinion intoned, “a decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided.” With these considerations in mind, Casey affirmed Roe’s “central holding” that the Constitution protected some measure of individual right to choose abortion.\n\nIt is striking that Dobbs did not so much as note Casey’s status as “precedent on precedent” in embarking on its own discussion of stare decisis. Rather, it offered what it described as five factors, that, taken together, “weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey: the nature of their error, the quality of their reasoning, the ‘workability’ of the rules they imposed on the country, their disruptive effect on other areas of the law, and the absence of concrete reliance.” For this five-part analysis, Dobbs cited just two precedents : Janus v. AFSCME, Council 31 and Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence in Ramos v. Louisiana. Meaningfully, in both Janus and Ramos, the Court overruled two 1970s-era precedents, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education and Apodaca v. Oregon.\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that the Dobbs Court focused mainly on Janus and Ramos. These two cases embodied the Roberts Court’s preferred approach to stare decisis — an approach that it honed in a series of other cases where Justices on the newly constituted Court never mentioned Roe and Casey, but nonetheless appeared to be shadow-boxing with the future of a constitutional right to abortion. In Janus, for example, Justice Alito’s majority opinion discussed stare decisis at length without once citing Casey. Instead, the Court’s analysis focused on the merits of the underlying constitutional claim — whether a union fair-share fee arrangement violated the First Amendment — and whether the 1978 Abood case had incorrectly concluded it did not. Forced to reckon with Abood as precedent, the Court dispatched quickly with its five-part stare decisis test, focusing principally on the first two factors — the earlier precedent’s error and its poor reasoning. Relying on these considerations, the Janus Court concluded that these concerns obviated the need to adhere to Abood. In this regard, Janus’s perfunctory performance of stare decisis made clear that the pressing question in determining whether to follow an extant precedent was simply whether the current Court agreed with the earlier Court’s substantive conclusions.\n\nDecided two years after Janus, Ramos approached the question of whether to overrule a long-standing precedent, Apodaca v. Oregon, in a similar fashion. As with Janus, the Ramos majority failed to cite Casey; the Kavanaugh concurrence cited it only to make the point that Casey itself had overruled several abortion precedents (presumably in an effort to broaden support for the position that overruling precedents is sometimes justified). Ramos, like Janus, began with a thorough meditation on the correct answer to the substantive question at issue —whether the Sixth Amendment right to conviction by a unanimous jury applied in state as well as federal court. After concluding that it necessarily did, the Ramos Court then invoked its understanding of the traditional stare decisis factors: “the quality of the decision’s reasoning; its consistency with related decisions; legal developments since the decision; and reliance on the decision.” Justice Gorsuch’s majority opinion then offered a complex rationale under which the key precedent, Apodaca, was not owed full stare decisis effect, given its fractured status.\n\nIn a lengthy concurrence, Justice Kavanaugh sought to clarify this approach to stare decisis, offering a framework that emphasized that under the Court’s “precedents on precedent,” some “special justification” is required “[t]o overrule a constitutional decision.” With this in mind, Justice Kavanaugh collapsed the seven distinct stare decisis factors identified in earlier cases into three broad factors: (1) whether the decision was not just “garden-variety” wrong, but “grievously or egregiously wrong”; (2) whether the prior decision has “caused significant negative jurisprudential or real-world consequences”; and (3) whether “overruling the prior decision [would] unduly upset reliance interests.”\n\nTaken together, Janus, Ramos, and Justice Kavanaugh’s Ramos concurrence offered different versions of Casey’s stare decisis calculus, but not radically different ones. And on its face, the Dobbs majority deployed a stare decisis calculus that resembled the tests used in Janus and Ramos, and even Casey. But in its application of this test, the Dobbs majority may have broken new ground. The five-factor test that the Dobbs majority referenced at the beginning of its stare decisis analysis makes no explicit mention of democracy or democratic deliberation. Yet, the majority opinion emphasized repeatedly the importance or salience of democracy and democratic deliberation — and Roe’s disruption of democratic deliberation.\n\nIn the section titled “The Nature of the Court’s Error,” the Dobbs majority explained that “Roe was on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided, Casey perpetuated its errors, and those errors do not concern some arcane corner of the law of little importance to the American people.” But it was not just that Roe and Casey concerned issues of great import — it was that these were issues that “the Constitution unequivocally leaves for the people.” In this regard, the Court’s decisions in Roe and Casey “usurped” the people’s authority to decide these questions for themselves. To underscore the point, the majority connected its denunciation of Roe and Casey to other historical rulings, citing with approval West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, a 1937 decision in which the Court also “overruled decisions that wrongly removed an issue from the people and the democratic process.”\n\nTo be sure, the Dobbs majority did not suggest that it was reformulating the long-standing test for stare decisis deference. But taken together, the majority’s novel approach to the questions of fidelity to precedent is striking. Under the Dobbs formulation, in addition to the factors announced in Casey and discussed in Janus and Ramos, courts are justified in overruling extant precedents in circumstances where the precedent involves important or sensitive subject matter, and where the Court’s earlier intervention halted or thwarted democratic deliberation. And critically, these democracy-inflected codicils to the traditional stare decisis factors are not only novel — they are almost entirely subjective. That is, it is for the reviewing court to determine whether an issue is of profound importance to the electorate. And it is for the reviewing court to determine whether earlier judicial interventions constitute a disruption of democratic deliberation.\n\nThe same charges of subjectivity also might be lodged against the previously announced stare decisis factors. That is, reliance, workability, and faulty reasoning might all be in the eye of the beholding court. What distinguishes these democracy-inflected factors from the traditional stare decisis factors articulated in Casey and referenced in Janus and Ramos — and indeed, makes them so concerning — is the fact of their rhetorical power. By overruling extant precedents in the name of the people, the Court may take dramatic steps that serve a different brand of judicial imperialism — all while cloaking the maneuver in the mantle of democracy and popular sovereignty.\n\nB. Interrupted Democracy as a “Special Justification”?\n\nAs discussed above, in the years immediately preceding Dobbs, the Justices of the Roberts Court clashed over the nature and strength of stare decisis in a series of cases involving 1970s-era precedents. A number of these cases sought to identify the sort of “special justification” that would justify a departure from stare decisis. In Ramos, Justice Gorsuch’s majority opinion pointed to the fact that the Court’s 1972 opinion in Apodaca v. Oregon “failed to appreciate the ‘racist origins’ of the [challenged] rule” permitting nonunanimous jury verdicts. The earlier Court’s failure to grapple with the racism embedded in the legal rule, the Ramos Court concluded, constituted a “special justification” that justified departing from stare decisis.\n\nAnd in the run-up to Dobbs, it appeared that the Court might rely on some version of this racially inflected argument to strike down Roe and Casey. Indeed, Justice Thomas’s concurrence in the denial of certiorari in 2019’s Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana & Kentucky, Inc. gestured in this direction. There, Justice Thomas “associated abortion with eugenics and the rise of the modern birth control movement,” apparently laying the groundwork for a determination that race — and the imperative of remedying past discrimination in the name of racial justice — furnished the “special justification” required to overrule Roe and Casey.\n\nBut if Ramos and Box prioritized an interest in remedying past racial injustices as a “special justification” in the stare decisis analysis, then Dobbs has gone further to identify remedying past judicial impositions on democracy and ongoing democratic deliberation as constituting a “special justification” for departing from extant precedent.\n\nWhile the introduction of a new special justification category may appear to be a relatively modest change to the existing stare decisis calculus, this development is cause for alarm. The question of whether democratic deliberation was ongoing — and productively moving toward some state-level resolution — is not an objective assessment. As we have discussed, the question of whether Roe interrupted ongoing democratic debate on abortion rights has been — and continues to be — the subject of considerable debate. As the Dobbs majority presented it, the question of whether a past precedent improperly arrested ongoing popular debate is subject entirely to whether five members of the Court agree that it did. Far from remedying judicial imperialism, the introduction of this new special justification is itself the embodiment of judicial imperialism. And, as importantly, the invocation of democratic deliberation provides cover for this kind of judicial imperialism. It insists that the Court is not imposing its own view of extant precedents, but rather is simply overruling these precedents in order to vindicate the rights of the people and to preserve democratic engagement. It is an enlargement of the judicial role under the guise of narrowing it. And it has potentially alarming implications for other cases and issues that may involve similarly fraught and divisive questions.\n\nC. Implications for Other Cases\n\nWhat other precedents of the Court might a new stare decisis formulation implicate? What prior precedents might be affected by a Court that is increasingly willing, even eager, to identify “special justifications” that justify departing from precedent? If the Court’s new vision of stare decisis is concerned with an issue’s “importance to the American people,” and whether an earlier opinion “usurped the power to address a question of profound moral and social importance,” it is likely that Obergefell v. Hodges, in which the Court held that the Constitution did not permit states to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples, is high on the list of possible targets.\n\nThe Court decided Obergefell during a moment of undeniable churn in state marriage laws. Just two Terms earlier, the Court in United States v. Windsor invalidated Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which limited the definition of marriage under federal law to heterosexual couples. Although Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the Court in Windsor singled out “state sovereign choices about who may be married,” pointedly noting that “[t]his opinion and its holding are confined” to those couples “joined in same-sex marriages made lawful by the State,” Justice Scalia was unconvinced. In dissent, he predicted that the majority’s conclusion that “DOMA is motivated by ‘bare . . . desire to harm’” same-sex couples could easily be extended “to reach the same conclusion with regard to state laws denying same-sex couples marital status.”\n\nSharing Justice Scalia’s concerns about the sweeping possibilities of the Windsor majority opinion, Chief Justice Roberts dissented separately to emphasize the states’ “historic and essential authority to define the marital relation.” The point was a subtle defense of state-level democratic deliberation. On Chief Justice Roberts’s telling, the states had long enjoyed the authority to define marriage for their residents, and the chosen definition of marriage ostensibly reflected the preferences of a majority of the state’s voters. Windsor, the Chief Justice underscored, did no more than reaffirm the state’s authority to define marriage, and going forward, states were free to express their residents’ preferences for “the traditional definition of marriage.”\n\nIf the Chief Justice nodded subtly to the prospect of democratic deliberation in defining marriage, Justice Scalia was more straightforward in voicing his concerns. In his lengthy Windsor dissent, Justice Scalia emphasized both the importance of marriage in public life and the importance of debates about marriage equality. As he explained: “Few public controversies touch an institution so central to the lives of so many, and few inspire such attendant passion by good people on all sides.” On this account, he observed, the issue was one that properly was being debated in the political process through “plebiscites, legislation, persuasion, and loud voices — in other words, democracy.”\n\nJustice Alito echoed these objections in his own dissent in Windsor. Explaining that “[o]ur Nation is engaged in a heated debate about same-sex marriage,” Justice Alito insisted that both Edith Windsor, the Windsor respondent, and the federal government were, despite the limited nature of their claims before the Court, intent on disrupting that debate and “enshrin[ing] in the Constitution a particular understanding of marriage under which the sex of the partners makes no difference.” Doing so, Justice Alito maintained, would require the Court to act beyond its constitutionally prescribed role. The Constitution, Justice Alito intoned, “simply does not speak to the issue of same-sex marriage. In our system of government, ultimate sovereignty rests with the people, and the people have the right to control their own destiny. Any change on a question so fundamental should be made by the people through their elected officials.”\n\nTwo years later, in Obergefell v. Hodges, a 5–4 majority of the Court concluded that the Constitution recognized a right to same-sex marriage, answering the question that had lurked at the periphery of Windsor. The decision prompted a series of vehement dissents, all of which underscored the state’s prerogative to define marriage, as well as the democratic underpinnings of such authority. Writing separately, Justice Scalia sounded the alarm, “call[ing] attention to this Court’s threat to American democracy.” Chief Justice Roberts’s dissent struck similar notes, accusing the Court of having “seize[d] for itself a question the Constitution leaves to the people, at a time when the people are engaged in a vibrant debate on that question.” Justices Thomas and Alito agreed: Obergefell, and by that logic, Windsor, represented the Court’s usurpation of issues that were properly being debated and deliberated by the people.\n\nRecalling the language of these dissents in the Court’s consideration of same-sex marriage is revealing. These dissents bear a striking resemblance to much of the stare decisis reasoning on display in Dobbs. The dissenters in Windsor and Obergefell emphasized the presence of an issue of significant salience to the public, in addition to the significant ongoing public debate the Court’s intervention halted. If these indeed are now important factors in identifying a precedent’s likelihood of being overruled, there is every reason to fear that Obergefell could be next.\n\nWhile the Court’s present supermajority suggests that Obergefell could be a likely candidate for reconsideration, in truth, the Dobbs Court’s approach to stare decisis, if fairly applied, could also call into question other recent decisions like District of Columbia v. Heller and New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. Bruen, both of which considered the scope and substance of the Second Amendment. If Obergefell is understood as interrupting ongoing state-level debates on the issue of marriage equality, then surely a similar critique could be levied against Heller and Bruen.\n\nAs with marriage equality, the public was, for years, engaged in an active debate over gun rights and gun safety laws. And often, these debates, like the debates over marriage equality, took on different policy contours in different jurisdictions. In 2007, one year before the Court decided Heller, gun safety laws varied widely across states. In 2021, one year before Bruen was decided, the variance in the number of gun control laws in place per state was similarly notable. Critically, over the past fifteen years since Heller was decided, different states have had vastly different sets of gun control laws. These variations in policy approaches to the issue of gun control and gun violence all make clear that at the time Heller, and subsequently Bruen, were decided, there was no coordinated national policy response to the issue of gun rights, as well as wildly variable views — democratic deliberation, if you will! — within different jurisdictions about the appropriate policy interventions.\n\nAnd yet, despite the wide variation in legislative responses across jurisdictions, the Court in Heller and Bruen interrupted this active debate over gun rights and gun safety to recognize a muscular and expansive right to keep and bear arms. On this account, if judicial disruption of an extant debate over an issue of high salience to the public is the criteria for reconsidering past precedent — however recently decided — then Heller and Bruen, as much as Obergefell, are ripe for reconsideration.\n\nOf course, it is highly unlikely that the Court, as currently constituted, would reconsider Heller and Bruen, the twin pillars of a reinvigorated Second Amendment. Perhaps more likely is the reconsideration of Obergefell — and indeed, at least two members of the current Court have indicated their receptivity to doing so. Further, the addition of the new Trump Justices, whose own views of stare decisis have effected significant changes in the Court’s jurisprudence, suggests that there is a possible majority that, at the very least, would be willing to consider whether judicial resolution of marriage equality went too far, frustrating the will of the people, even as it overlooks such deliberation in other contexts.\n\n* * *\n\nHaving canvassed the implications of Dobbs for stare decisis and the Court’s jurisprudence more generally, the following Part takes seriously the Dobbs majority’s claim that overruling Roe and returning the abortion question to the states — and the people — is the appropriate outcome. As this Part explains, despite the majority’s rhetorical paeans to democracy, its understanding of democracy and democratic deliberation and participation is shockingly myopic and limited. Moreover, due in large part to the Court’s own decisions in the areas of voting rights and election law, the landscape in which democratic deliberation of the abortion question is fated to occur has been woefully distorted, making the prospect of meaningful democratic debate and deliberation elusive.\n\nIII. Myopic Democracy\n\nThe Dobbs majority insisted that its opinion rested on and implemented principles of democracy. But the irony of Dobbs is that it purported to “return” the issue of abortion to the democratic process while revealing an extraordinarily limited, even myopic, conception of democracy. This includes myopia in terms of the processes and institutions that the Court understands as constitutive of democracy; myopia in orientation — that is, the direction of change the opinion expects the mechanisms of democracy to produce; myopia in the opinion’s conception of political power and of who is properly within the political community; and myopia in the Court’s failure to grasp the antidemocratic quality of the method it utilizes for identifying the rights worthy of protection.\n\nThe sections that follow detail these limitations in the Court’s conception of democracy. But in focusing on these limitations, we do not mean to suggest that they are the only such limitations. Indeed, there is perhaps a more fundamental problem with the Court’s conception of democracy, which is that it appears to equate democracy with simple majoritarianism. In fact, however, genuine democracy arguably demands much more.\n\nA. Alternative Conceptions of Democracy\n\nWe do not aim to offer here a novel theory of democracy. But political theorists have identified a number of core features of democracy, and we briefly discuss them in turn. First, and perhaps most impor­tantly, any meaningful conception of democracy requires that citizens enjoy genuine political equality, which Professor Jeremy Waldron has described as “the foundation of democracy.” As a practical matter, this means that all members of the polity must possess both an equal right to participate and an equal and meaningful opportunity to par­ticipate in decisions about collective self-governance. It also means that, in matters of self-governance, individuals must stand in relation to one another as political equals, without distinction and without formal hierarchies.\n\nIn addition, although regular elections are of course a core feature of democracy, the fact of elections is merely a baseline: democracy requires genuine competition and meaningful choice at those elections. It also requires procedures that are conducted “under certain background conditions.” There is, of course, active debate about the character, scope, and necessity of those background conditions, but at a minimum they include features like the opportunity for meaningful deliberation, as well as some key predicates to that deliberation — the opportunity to engage in speech and expression; an independent press; the ability to associate.\n\nDemocracy may also contain, as Professor Nelson Tebbe has suggested, a prohibition on the coercion of citizens “for reasons that are inaccessible to them, or that they could never understand or accept.” This principle does not, of course, require that individuals approve of or desire regulations to which they are subject. But they “must be able to cognize, and contend with, the laws’ purposes.”\n\nThe protection of minorities, who may face impediments in protecting their interests in majoritarian politics, is also a critical aspect of meaningful democracy. As the political philosopher Danielle Allen argues, when it comes to the core features of democracy, “[m]inority-protecting mechanisms . . . are just as important as majority vote.” Those mechanisms can take the form of identifying alternative sites at which, and ways in which, electoral minorities can exercise political power.\n\nRelatedly, on many accounts — including that of political theorist Robert Dahl — pluralism is a central feature of American democracy. Here, we mean pluralism not just in terms of the processes of negotiation, competition, and contestation by which interest groups form shifting coalitions to advance policy goals, but also in the sites and sources of democracy. That is, for America to have a functioning democracy, “[i]nstead of a single center of sovereign power there must be multiple centers of power, none of which is or can be wholly sovereign.” As philosopher Timothy Garton Ash recently explained in an interview: “[W]hat distinguishes a tyranny of the majority from a genuine democracy is precisely pluralism. It’s not majority-takes-all. It’s the fact that there are anti-majoritarian institutions.” This means that a functioning democracy not only reflects the popular will but does so in the face of antimajoritarian influences or devices that coexist within majoritarian institutions. On this account, a true democracy demands institutions that stand somewhat apart from majoritarian politics — including, crucially, independent courts that may serve as a check on majoritarianism.\n\nAgain, this account of the features of a functioning democracy is not intended to be fully detailed and comprehensive. Instead, in offering these broad brushstrokes, we seek only to emphasize that meaningful democracy entails more than a system by which important decisions are made by plurality or majority vote. Against this backdrop, a close examination of the Dobbs Court’s deployment of democracy reveals profound limitations in the Court’s conception of democracy, even on the Court’s own (limited) terms.\n\nB. Examining the Court’s Myopia\n\nMindful of what a more robust conception of democracy might entail, we now turn to the Court’s more limited vision of democracy. As we detail below, even on the Court’s cramped understanding of democracy as coextensive with majoritarianism, a close examination of Dobbs reveals the Court’s appeal to democracy to be shallow, underdeveloped, and profoundly cynical.\n\n1. Institutional Myopia. — First, when the Dobbs majority discussed democracy, it focused almost exclusively on state legislatures, repeatedly invoking those bodies as the paradigmatic representation of democracy. Consider the Court’s claim that its decision to overrule Roe “allows women on both sides of the abortion issue to seek to affect the legislative process.” Or its explanation that “the Casey plurality’s speculations and weighing of the relative importance of the fetus and mother represent a departure from the ‘original constitutional proposition’ that ‘courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.’” Or its insistence that “the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot ‘substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.’”\n\nBut state-level democracy is in no way coextensive with state legislative activity, as Justice Alito seemed to suggest in Dobbs. In fact, as scholars like Professor Miriam Seifter have shown, state legislatures are often the least representative institutions in state government, largely because of the gerrymandering that the Supreme Court has approved. Further, the emphasis on state legislatures as arbiters of democracy belies the role that state judiciaries have played in interpreting state constitutional provisions, including to protect reproductive rights. Surely Justice Alito knew that state courts in places like Iowa and Kansas had found abortion protections in state constitutions, and that in many states, judicial candidates run for office statewide. On this account, some jurists on state high courts are selected by many more voters than select the average member of a state legislature — perhaps by even more voters than select a majority of the state legislature.\n\nTo be clear, the point is not that elected judges “represent” voters in precisely the same way legislative representatives do, or are imagined as doing. Rather, our point is more straightforward and modest: that state judges and state courts are critical players in state-level democracy.\n\nBeyond the role of state courts in state democracy, state executive-branch officials are also important players in forging state law. Executive-branch officials, again in contrast to state legislative officials, are typically elected statewide. Governors may veto restrictive abortion laws, including on grounds of state constitutional principles. Attorneys general, who in most states are elected, may utilize enforcement discretion, and even intervene in ongoing litigation, to implement abortion policy. Other state officials, whether appointed or independently elected, may issue rules and take other regulatory action that facilitate or impede access to abortion. They, too, are absent from the Court’s conception of state-level democracy. So are local officials, who are important players in implementing abortion policy and are similarly absent from the majority’s discussion.\n\nPerhaps even more conspicuous is the Court’s failure to mention the prospect of direct democracy in its discussion of democratic deliberation on the abortion issue. Today, roughly half of the states have at least some mechanisms by which the people can make and change policy directly, without any legislative intermediaries. The post-Dobbs era has already seen significant activity on this front, with a number of states relying on ballot initiatives and voter referenda to protect reproductive rights under state law, as well as attempts — so far unsuccessful — to use direct democracy to curtail those rights.\n\nBeyond overlooking the array of opportunities for state-level de­mocratic deliberation, Justice Alito’s Dobbs opinion was also curiously silent on the prospect of the federal legislature as a site of future democratic deliberation on abortion rights. Congress, of course, could regulate abortion under federal law; indeed, in 2003, Congress prohibited an abortion procedure it termed “partial-birth abortion,” and the Court upheld that law in the 2007 case Gonzales v. Carhart. Despite this recent history, there is not a whisper of the possibility of federal legislation in Justice Alito’s majority opinion — a fact made all the more notable by Justice Kavanaugh’s explicit acknowledgement of this possibility in his concurrence.\n\nIn short, democracy is not coextensive with state legislatures, particularly given the formalized conception of the state legislature on display throughout the Dobbs opinion. But it is nonetheless striking, and likely no accident, that the opinion chose to single out state legislatures as the paradigmatic engine of state-level democratic deliberation. As a result of their inherent structure, as well as the effects of gerrymandering, state legislatures are likely today to be less responsive to and reflective of majority will than other democratic institutions. Tellingly, state legislatures’ failures to implement the policy preferences of voters is particularly stark when it comes to abortion: consider a state like Oklahoma, where fifty-one percent of the population supports access to legal abortion in most or all circumstances, but in which the state legislature has enacted one of the most sweeping abortion bans in the country.\n\n2. Directional Myopia. — In addition to equating democracy with state-level legislative action, the Dobbs majority appeared fixated on deploying democracy in one direction — limiting, rather than expanding, access to abortion. Specifically, the opinion insisted that overturning Roe and returning the issue of abortion to the states (or at least state legislatures) would “allow[] women on both sides of the abortion issue to seek to affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office”; it also noted that “[w]omen are not without electoral or political power.”\n\nBut tellingly, the Court’s repeated references to democratic deliberation imagined democratic interventions that curtail, rather than preserve or expand, reproductive rights. For example, the majority explained: “The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.” Similarly, the opinion reasoned: “The Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who dissented in any respect from Roe. . . . Together, Roe and Casey represent an error that cannot be allowed to stand.” Indeed, the only time the opinion spoke in concrete terms about abortion regulation, it credited potential state efforts to make abortion more restricted, and less accessible. There was one passing mention of a state that might wish to protect abortion. But that reference was paired with a much more detailed reference to the Mississippi law challenged in Dobbs, whose proponents the Court credited as animated by a belief that “abortion destroys an ‘unborn human being.’”\n\nIt is true, of course, that Roe and Casey limited only state efforts to restrict or prohibit abortion. But given the majority’s repeated reminders that, before Roe, debate was occurring and proponents of liberal abortion rights had succeeded in some measure in persuading their fellow citizens of the rightness of their cause, it is curious that the Dobbs opinion did not admit the possibility that democratic deliberation might yield outcomes that are favorable to abortion rights. With all of this in mind, the majority’s failure to make plain that its decision did not impede democratic efforts to protect abortion rights is, by itself, revealing.\n\nThis oversight is especially pronounced when compared to Justice Kavanaugh’s separate concurrence, which despite its praise for the majority’s historical reasoning, staked out a somewhat different position. There, Justice Kavanaugh suggested that states could not seek to prohibit interstate travel for abortion care and reiterated the view that the Constitution is “neutral” on abortion. To wit:\n\nTo be clear . . . the Court’s decision today does not outlaw abortion throughout the United States. On the contrary, the Court’s decision properly leaves the question of abortion for the people and their elected representatives in the democratic process. Through that democratic process, the people and their representatives may decide to allow or limit abortion. As Justice Scalia stated, the “States may, if they wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution does not require them to do so.” Today’s decision therefore does not prevent the numerous States that readily allow abortion from continuing to readily allow abortion.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh’s language is striking — both in its endorsement of a state-by-state settlement of the abortion question, and in highlighting the majority’s neglect of any discussion (or even acknowledgment) of the prospect of state-level democratic efforts to protect abortion rights.\n\n3. Political Power Myopia. — The Dobbs majority opinion’s limited view of the direction of democratic change is matched by its exceedingly limited vision of political power. According to the majority, “[w]omen are not without electoral or political power.” Critically, on this conception, political power is reducible to voting and perhaps running for office. But who decides that women have ample political power? It is true, as Justice Alito noted, that when it comes to participation, women today are registered to vote and turn out to vote at higher rates than men. But — even putting to one side the significant obstacles women, who are often the principal caregivers in the family, must surmount to actually exercise the franchise — if we use any metrics beyond simply voting to measure democratic participation, the empirical portrait looks decidedly different.\n\nWhen it comes to membership in state and local government, for example, women are grossly underrepresented. Today, women occupy 32.7% of the 7,386 seats in state legislatures. In some states, the number of women serving in the state legislature is far lower; in Mississippi, for instance, where Dobbs arose, the state legislature is composed of 14.4% women. In West Virginia the number is 11.9%, and in Tennessee it is 15.2%. This underrepresentation in state legislatures is striking — particularly in view of Justice Alito’s suggestion that democratic deliberation of the abortion question should properly be reserved for state legislatures. State and local executive-branch offices are even more lopsided: Today, in cities and towns with populations over 30,000, only 25.8% of mayors and comparable local officials are women. And governorships fare still worse: a mere twelve U.S. states, and the U.S. territory of Guam, have women in the governor’s mansion.\n\nThe composition of the federal legislature is also uneven in terms of gender representation. Just 25 women serve in the United States Senate, and 125 women serve in the United States House of Representatives. These figures represent only about a quarter of each chamber. And notably, the women who do attain seats in the federal legislature tend to be significantly older than their male counterparts. Research suggests that women enter elected office later in life, often after having children or even after their children have left home. In the 116th Congress, for example, the average age for members was forty-seven; by contrast, the average age for female members was sixty-four, nearly twenty years older. The most recent election, post-Dobbs, reflected a narrowing of this gap, with an average age of forty-six for Congress’s incoming women members, much younger than the average age of women in Congress overall.\n\nState legislatures reflect a similar age imbalance in representation (although data here are more dated). In 2001, 39% of male state legislators were under fifty, while only 24% of female state legislators were under fifty. “While 28 percent of male state senators and 30 percent of male state representatives entered office when they were 40 years old or younger, the same was true of only 11 percent of female state senators and 14 percent of female state representatives.”\n\nWomen are also woefully underrepresented in the ecosystem that surrounds Congress. As scholars have shown, from 2008 to 2015, “wo­men account[ed] for only 37% of the lobbyist[s] . . . in Washington.” Women are also much less likely than men to donate to political candidates. In fact, a 2020 study by the Center for American Women and Politics showed that men out-donated women in state legislative elections by a 2:1 ratio. Studies confirm these disparities in federal elections, both congressional and presidential; a recent paper analyzing contributions from 1980 to 2008 found that in 1980, women made only a little more than 20% of federal campaign contributions and that by 2008 the number was still a little less than 37%. Another recent study found an even starker divide in the context of women of color, who accounted for merely 2% of individual contributions to House races in 2010, despite constituting approximately 18% of the population.\n\nBy any measure, these metrics make plain the enduring disparity in women’s political power at both the state and federal levels. And important recent work reveals the impact of women’s representation (or more often, underrepresentation) on abortion policy: “[T]here is a very significant relationship between women’s presence in the legislature and the degree of permissiveness of abortion policy,” with legislatures that contain higher percentages of women enacting policies that are more protective of abortion access.\n\nFurther, the Court’s uncritical account of women’s political power is linked to its limited understanding of who comprises the polity. On one level, the Court’s vision of the polity is limited to those who have managed to overcome state-imposed obstacles to voting — obstacles that the Court, through many of its voting rights decisions, has credited and blessed. On another level, however, the Court’s vision of democratic deliberation prioritizes and privileges moments of democratic debate that included only some members of the political community. For example, when the Dobbs majority insisted that Roe interrupted state-level debate and deliberation of the abortion issue, it was often referring to mid-twentieth-century debates over whether to repeal or liberalize then-extant abortion restrictions. What is missing from the Court’s account of these debates is the fact that the laws and policies being debated were enacted through democratic processes that were categorically closed to all but white men. That is, they were democratic processes in which “the polity” affirmatively did not include women and people of color. On this account, the “debates” that Roe preempted — and that the Dobbs majority prioritized and sought to vindicate in returning the abortion issue to the states — were debates over whether to retain or liberalize laws enacted under conditions of extreme democratic deficit.\n\nAnd meaningfully, the impulse to tout such laws as reflective of democratic deliberation endures in the aftermath of Dobbs. Consider the recent debate over Wisconsin’s 1849 abortion prohibition. This prohibition, which predates the Nineteenth Amendment by 70 years and the Wisconsin Constitution’s amendment granting women’s suffrage by 85 years, was enacted at a time when women were without formal political power. Despite this demonstrably undemocratic provenance, Republican politicians now argue that post-Dobbs, the state should be permitted to enforce the 1849 law, which remained on the books after Roe in a state of desuetude. And critically, even though women and people of color are eligible to participate, the current “debate” over whether the law should remain in force is unlikely to produce true democratic deliberation. Wisconsin is subject to one of the worst gerrymanders in the country, meaning that there is virtually no prospect of repealing the 1849 law through ordinary legislative processes.\n\n4. Methodological Myopia. — Finally, the method the Court used in overruling Roe and Casey and concluding that the Constitution does not protect the right to terminate a pregnancy reveals the hollowness of the Court’s professed commitment to principles of democracy. The Court held that when determining whether an unenumerated right is nevertheless a protected liberty, courts must look to “history and tradition.” In the words of the opinion: “[G]uided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of our Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the Fourteenth Amendment means by the term ‘liberty.’” Focusing on that question, Justice Alito concluded that “in the present case, the clear answer is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion.”\n\nBut on what does the Court’s history-and-tradition analysis rely? As the Dobbs majority made clear, its prescribed methodology consisted primarily of examining a slew of mid-nineteenth-century statutes. Notably, many of these statutes were enacted during a wave of nativist furor aimed at increasing the birthrate among native-born (white) women. That is the context in which these statutes were enacted. But more than that, the laws that were central to the majority’s conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect abortion rights were, every one of them, enacted in an era in which “women could not vote, run for political office,” or participate in any way as full and equal members of the polity. Apparently oblivious to this democratic deficit, the Dobbs majority compounded it, reaching back still further to cite Sir Matthew Hale, a seventeenth-century barrister and jurist, for the proposition that “abortion of a quick child who died in the womb [is] a ‘great crime’ and a ‘great misprision.’”\n\nPut differently, the Dobbs majority’s method of analysis and interpretation bound the contemporary meaning of the Constitution to a body of law and authority in whose enactment and creation neither women nor people of color played any part, “recogniz[ing] only those rights already recognized by a ruling minority elite, who were chosen to govern through undemocratic (or at best partially democratic) means.” This is a methodological approach that reifies the conditions of democratic deficit — hardly a methodology that values democracy and true democratic engagement.\n\nMore troublingly, the Dobbs decision failed to grapple with the ways in which withdrawing the abortion right would restrict the full democratic participation and equal citizenship of women. There is a powerful argument that women’s full citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, as well as the Nineteenth Amendment’s right to vote, requires control over their reproductive lives. The majority’s refusal even to grapple seriously with those arguments is further evidence of the opinion’s crabbed and thin commitment to democracy.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the initial aftermath of Dobbs, it appears that the public not only does not share the Dobbs majority’s substantive views about abortion — it also does not share its cramped vision of democracy. Instead, Dobbs has fueled considerable public interest in state-level direct democracy — initiatives, referenda, ballot questions and similar devices, all of which allow individual voters to directly register their preferences unmediated by other institutions or actors. As we noted earlier, in the wake of Dobbs, direct democracy initiatives have allowed voters to weigh in on the abortion issue at the state level — and in these circumstances, voters have overwhelmingly registered their preferences for reproductive freedom. Indeed, in the post-Dobbs era, every time voters have gone to the polls to vote directly on abortion, they have voted to protect or expand access to abortion.\n\nThe first such state was Kansas, where in August 2022 a resounding fifty-nine percent of voters rejected an amendment that would have removed abortion-rights protections from the constitution and allowed state legislators to ban or restrict the procedure.\n\nThis trend only accelerated during the November 2022 election, when voters in California, Michigan, and Vermont enshrined abortion protections in their state constitutions. California voters added language to their constitution to explicitly guarantee that “the state shall not deny or interfere with an individual’s reproductive freedom in their most intimate decisions, which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives.” Michigan voters adopted a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights and reproductive freedom, overriding a 1931 abortion ban that might otherwise have taken effect. And in Vermont, where a 2019 law already guaranteed abortion rights, voters used the referendum process to install an additional layer of protection, enacting Article 22, the Reproductive Liberty Amendment, which broadly guarantees “personal reproductive autonomy unless justified by a compelling State interest.”\n\nTo be sure, direct democracy was not simply a vehicle for expanding reproductive freedom; in various states, voters also went to the polls to register their objections to efforts to limit reproductive rights. Following Kansas’s lead, Kentucky voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have made it harder to challenge abortion restrictions. The amendment sought to direct “question[s] of access to abortion to the state’s Republican-controlled legislature and prevent[] [state] courts from . . . interpreting” the state constitution in favor of abortion rights. In Montana, voters rejected LR-131, a ballot initiative that, in cir­cumstances involving unsuccessful abortion procedures, declared those fetuses legal persons with rights to medical care. The proposed initiative also required doctors to provide resuscitative care for newborns with a fatal prognosis, even when no amount of medical care would save them, and despite the wishes of parents. Widely viewed as an effort to stigmatize abortion and constitutionalize fetal personhood, the mea­sure lost by a vote of 53% to 47%.\n\nGiven the robust interest in direct democracy in the post-Dobbs era, it is notable that we also have seen state actors, in particular state legislatures, laboring mightily to limit access to such initiatives. For example, in Ohio, lawmakers convened a special election to raise the threshold for using ballot initiatives as a means of amending the state constitution from fifty percent to sixty percent. The proposal, which was broadly understood as a means of thwarting efforts to amend Ohio’s constitution to protect abortion rights, was roundly defeated in August 2023. The Arkansas legislature was more successful, tripling the number of counties from which signatures must be collected in order to qualify an initiative for the ballot — a move that was widely regarded as a hedge against efforts aimed at protecting and expanding reproductive rights in the state. Likewise, in Mississippi, the state legislature has taken steps to prohibit ballot and voter initiatives in the substantive area of reproductive rights. Similar measures are being pursued in North Dakota and Missouri.\n\nThese dynamics are striking and worthy of further scholarly attention. We will only note here that the Court itself has effectively underwritten these efforts to thwart direct democracy. As we discuss in the following Part, in recent years, the Court has issued a raft of decisions that distort and alter the electoral landscape, making the prospect of true democratic deliberation elusive. To the extent that voters have been able to deploy direct-democracy initiatives to articulate their preference for reproductive freedom, it has been in spite of, not because of, the Roberts Court’s jurisprudence of democracy.\n\nIV. The Court and Democracy: Rhetoric and Reality\n\nConsidering the Dobbs opinion from these perspectives reveals the shallow nature — indeed, the cynicism — of the Court’s paeans to democracy. Dobbs’s hollow commitment to democracy is even more pronounced when considered alongside the Court’s active interventions to distort and disrupt the functioning of the electoral process. Indeed, Dobbs arrives in the wake of a series of high court decisions that, taken together, have made our democracy decidedly less representative and less democratic. These cases, and their evident hostility to voting rights, take on new salience in the context of the Dobbs Court’s insis­tence on returning the question of abortion to non-court entities for resolution. We hasten to note, as we did in the preceding Part, that our discussion here is by design limited: we do not consider democracy in its full scope and breadth, but rather we mostly limit our discussion to the electoral process. The Part that follows turns more directly to what Dobbs tells us about this Court’s role in our democracy.\n\nThis Part begins with the Court’s recent jurisprudence on various aspects of the democratic process. Although the cases involve discrete legal questions, they are remarkably similar in valence and outcome, invariably erecting obstacles to participation or invalidating efforts of state and federal lawmakers to facilitate participation and access to the franchise. After considering the Court’s cases dealing explicitly with the infrastructure of democracy, we then examine a series of cases in which the Court, or some of its members, as in Dobbs, prioritized democratic deliberation ahead of judicial intervention. As we note, in these moments where the Court prioritizes democratic deliberation, it is also avoiding a judicial settlement that would preserve and protect the interests of less politically powerful minority groups.\n\nA. The Infrastructure of Democracy\n\nThe topic of the Court’s democracy-undermining interventions is vast and well canvassed, so our discussion here does not purport to be comprehensive. But we offer examples of the Court’s moves to limit the exercise of the franchise and the prospect of an inclusive democracy. Taken together, these cases have produced a landscape in which any post-Dobbs deliberation will happen under conditions of severe democratic deficit.\n\nFirst, in a series of cases, the Court has hobbled the Voting Rights Act (VRA), a federal statute enacted in 1965 with the explicit purpose of ending racial discrimination in voting. The VRA, in the words of Justice Kagan, “marries two great ideals: democracy and racial equality. And it dedicates our country to carrying them out.” Despite these lofty aspirations, again and again, the Roberts Court has undermined these ideals and the landmark legislation intended to enshrine them as law. In 2013, a 5–4 Court in Shelby County v. Holder struck down a provision of the law that required states and localities with especially egregious histories of race discrimination in voting to obtain pre­approval from a federal court or the Department of Justice before implementing any change to their voting policies or procedures. In invalidating the preclearance formula, the Court gave short shrift to the Act’s reauthorization by overwhelming congressional majorities and the extensive legislative record of the continued disenfranchisement of minority voters compiled in the course of the reauthorization.\n\nIn 2021, in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, the Court continued its assault on the VRA, narrowly interpreting Section 2 of the statute to limit the scope of cases in which litigants can successfully challenge suppressive voting policies. As commentators have noted, the Court’s decision in Brnovich rendered meaningful enforcement of the VRA’s prohibition on discriminatory voting laws exceedingly difficult — although in the 2023 case Allen v. Milligan, the Court maintained a meaningful role for Section 2 in the context of racial gerrymandering.\n\nIn addition to limiting the reach of the VRA, the Court, in 2019’s Rucho v. Common Cause, announced that federal courts will not enforce any limits on partisan gerrymandering, a process that allows self-interested politicians to draw legislative district lines in ways that ensure a particular party’s continued hold on power. The Court’s dramatic 2019 announcement that challenges to political gerrymanders represent nonjusticiable political questions followed a series of cases over several decades in which the Court had signaled serious concerns about the constitutionality of excessive partisan gerrymanders. In 1973, the Court noted in passing that “[a] districting plan may create multimember districts perfectly acceptable under equal population standards, but invidiously discriminatory because they are employed ‘to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population.’” In 1986, a majority of the Court held that challenges to partisan gerrymanders were justiciable, but no majority coalesced around a methodology that courts could deploy to resolve such challenges. In 2004 and 2006, the Court again acknowledged the serious constitutional concerns that excessive partisan gerrymanders posed, but again it could not reach consensus about how to craft a manageable standard for policing the practice.\n\nBut in Rucho, a 5–4 Court held that while excessive partisan gerrymanders are “incompatible with democratic principles” — leading to “results that reasonably seem unjust” — federal courts are nevertheless powerless to stop them. According to the Court, because challenges to partisan gerrymanders present “political questions,” challenges to such efforts to distort the democratic process are better left to other institutions, including state politicians and legislatures — the very actors who stand to benefit from these distortions.\n\nIn the wake of Rucho, state legislators, apparently emboldened by the knowledge that federal courts would not enforce any limits on partisan gerrymanders, have engaged in ever more aggressive gerrymanders. Wisconsin supplies a particularly egregious recent example of the practice. In 2022, the Democratic governor was reelected by a margin of 51.2% to 47.8% statewide, and a Democrat also won the statewide race for attorney general. Yet one of the most aggressively partisan legislative maps in the country meant that Republicans held approximately 64% of "
