        "text": "Obituaries\n\nSpring 2023\n\nTerence Cox J.D. ‘77\n\nTerence Cox (Terry) passed on from this world on January 19, 2023, at home with his loving wife, Kathryn, and his daughter, Chaya by his side. He was primarily a private person and most people who knew Terry had only a small glimpse of his broad-ranging passions and accomplishments. Terry graduated from Redwood High School in 1969. His father died suddenly when Terry was 15 years old, and Terry readily accepted that it was time for him to become self-supporting. He worked as a construction laborer on the weekends to help pay his mother’s rent and left home a year later when he was 16, hitchhiking to Breckenridge, Colorado, where he worked over the next three summers as an apprentice carpenter. Terry worked side by side with carpenters from over a dozen states. He loved their spirit, their hammering nails to the rhythm of country music, and quickly adapted to their hard-work ethic. Terry’s experiences over those three summers led him to seek more adventures that would help him better understand people from diverse backgrounds and deeply embedded values. He learned from listening to their banter that every person has a story to tell. And that listening closely was one of the better ways to understand the best secrets of life. In the fall of 1969, one week before he began his studies at U.C. Berkeley, Terry hitchhiked from Marin to Monterey. He’d learned from meeting an avid jazz fan in Breckenridge that the night before every Monterey Jazz Festival (MJF), its musicians would enjoy a private barbeque together. Terry introduced himself to the backstage crew, many of whom were young and from all over America. They were an eclectic, highly talented crew. They shared his love of adventure and welcomed him to join them as a backstage hand that year. Terry was hired on the spot by the MJF’s two founders, Jimmy Lyons, and Paul Vierrege. Years later, Terry was promoted by Jimmy and Paul to become the MJF’s artist liaison because he related well to musicians. He held that position over the next 25 years, as he hung out backstage with most of the world’s greatest jazz musicians. After 30 years working backstage, Terry decided that he simply wanted to enjoy the music which he did for another twenty-three years with Kathryn by his side. The last MJF Terry attended was in September 2021 his 52nd year at the Festival.Terry graduated from U.C. Berkeley in late 1973 as a U.S. History major. Unsure whether he wanted to undertake graduate studies to become a history teacher, or refine his skills as a carpenter to make it his career, or apply to law school which some of his Berkeley professors had urged, Terry decided to take off for another year of travel. He’d dreamed for years of visiting Kathmandu, Nepal, and sensed that another year of experiences would lead him to his best path into the future.Terry flew to Istanbul in January 1974. A particularly severe winter storm dumped over 10 feet of snow upon his arrival in Turkey, stranding him in Istanbul along with thousands of travelers hoping to head overland to India and Nepal. He finally left by slow train to Tehran, Iran, from where he took an even slower train headed toward Afghanistan. Reaching the border, he rode by bus to Herat, where piles of high snow drifts were more severe. During those two winter months in Afghanistan, Terry reflected upon the horrendous treatment of the citizens that he’d seen in many parts of the world with no freedom or any individual rights. Terry applied to law schools that winter while he was bogged down by snow in Herat. The village’s electricity had been down for days, with no end in sight. No one could locate a pen. Terry had no choice but to write his applications to law schools in pencil by candlelight. In his applications, he described his recent experiences, his increasing awareness of how precious the rights of American citizens are in our world, and how too many Americans take their rights for granted. Three months later, after hitchhiking from Kathmandu back to Istanbul and flying home, Terry began law school. He graduated from Santa Clara University Law School in 1977. The day the California Bar Exam results were announced in November 1977, when Terry learned that he had passed, he bought a one-way ticket to Bangkok. Terry took that trip to spend time: (1) reflecting on his best career path going forward, which he pondered while living in a Thai fisherman’s straw hut on Karon Beach, a then remote, spectacular, three-mile, pearly beach at the southern tip of Phuket, Thailand; and (2) exploring the most magical and wondrous Bali, having been encouraged by his first law professor to stay with a Balinese family who had offered to host him in their beautiful Balinese losmen (guesthouses) where he could immerse himself in the Balinese culture. Those two experiences were invaluable to Terry and led him to embrace the value that guided him for the rest of his life: always take time to appreciate the art, beauty, and grace of life. After his early years practicing maritime law with Derby, Cook, Quinby & Tweedt, Terry started his own law firm, Cox Wootton, in the mid-90s. He and his partner Richard Wootton slowly grew their firm to become one of the best-respected maritime law firms in America. Their firm evolved into representing the largest tug & barge fleet in the world, the best dining cruise fleets of vessels on the West Coast, the best marine repair yard in America, the best marine salvage diving teams on the West Coast, the Port of San Francisco, the owners and operators of some of the fastest sailboats in the world including America’s Cup syndicates and Hollywood studios producing movies filmed on open waters, such as The Flags of our Fathers and Below Deck. Terry was never happier as a lawyer than when he was in a jury trial. Terry proceeded over the next decades to try high-visibility maritime cases throughout the greater Bay Area, the Los Angeles area, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, and Boston and attended maritime arbitrations in New Orleans, London, and Paris.When Terry met Kathryn in 1988, her life as a musician and being a lover of operas could not have meshed better with his. They both loved France and bicycling, particularly in Provence where they had each spent time in their earlier years. Kathryn and Terry were married in Aix en Provence, France in 1991 with a group of friends and relatives joining them. Their European and American friends continued to join them in Aix on each fifth anniversary of their marriage, extending over the next 30 years. Terry and Kathryn’s daughter Chaya was born in 1999, and prior to moving to San Anselmo, the three of them lived for many years on their houseboat in Waldo Point Harbor in Sausalito, overflowing with large wooden carvings they’d found in remote regions of Thailand, Bali, and Cambodia. They camped throughout Chaya’s younger years exploring the mountain states, including Montana where they bought a small piece of property in Red Lodge, Montana. They spent many summers enjoying the beauty of the Beartooth Mountains and the Red Lodge Rodeo in July. Terry was predeceased by his parents, Dr. Thomas and Una Cox, and sister Carolyn Cox. He is survived by his wife Kathryn, daughter Chaya and brother Tom Cox (Sandy). Terry passes on being eternally grateful, knowing that he accomplished more than he could have ever dreamed and that Kathryn and Chaya will carry on his spirit. Terry always much enjoyed George Bernard Shaw’s quote: Life is a splendid torch which I have got hold of for a moment and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to the future generations.Along with Bob Weir’s more recent quote: Death is the last and best reward for a life well lived. Terry encourages everyone to listen to: (1) George Strait’s It’s a Love Without End, Amen (Live at the Astrodome, January 19, 2013); (2) his favorite piece of music Nessum Dorma, sung by Pavarotti (June 7, 2019); and (3) the grand fair well, Halleluiah (K.D. Lange, Vancouver 2010 Opening Ceremony Olympic Games).\n\nKeith R. Gillette LL.M. ‘08\n\nKeith Randall Gillette, loving husband, father, brother, and friend died on July 22, 2022, at his home in Auburn after a battle with cancer.

Keith had a deep love of his favorite hobby, model railroading. The sound of a Western Pacific engine horn in the distance traveling to and from Marysville was something that he loved. His model railroad was based on the Western Pacific operations near Marysville. He also liked nothing better than to gather with friends or family and enjoy his excellent ribs or a really good steak.\n\nHon. Robert A. Glusman J.D. ‘76\n\nRobert Alan Glusman passed away peacefully in Chico on March 6, 2023. Rob was born in Philadelphia, PA in 1951. At age nine, his family moved to California.

Gorman III J.D. ‘89\n\nJohn Lawrence Gorman III died on August 22nd, 2022, in Modesto, where he had lived and worked as an attorney for more than 30 years. Big John, as he was known to family and friends, was born in southern California and attended Mater Dei High School, where he played basketball and made life-long friends. He received his bachelor’s degree from California State University, Fullerton, a master’s degree in psychology from Chico State, and his law degree from Santa Clara University.

Stephen William was born September 18, 1937, in St. Joseph, MO to Stephen David and Mary Ellen Hayes (nee Mooney). He was a graduate of Christian Brothers High School (valedictorian); the University of Missouri; and the University of Santa Clara Law School. The eldest of four siblings and known for his gentle and unassuming nature, Stephen William remembered his hometown fondly and regularly shared stories of its charm ranging from delivering the newspaper to Coleman Hawkins’ mother, his father’s years as a foreman in the stockyards, to seeing Mickey Mantle play minor league ball. Stephen William left St. Joseph for San Francisco in the late 60s where he built a life around the extensive music scene, book collecting, friendships, and travel. In 1982, he moved to Frankfurt am Main. In 1985, he met his wife, Marina Torres del Aguila of Lima, Peru, while vacationing in Rome. They were married in 1988 with ceremonies in Frankfurt; Lima, Peru; and San Francisco before welcoming their child, Stephen Juan, in 1990 in Frankfurt. After returning to the States in 1991, Stephen William and family settled in Montgomery County, MD while working as legal counsel at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in D.C. Stephen William was an able attorney whose legal mind earned him professional awards and the enduring respect of his colleagues. He retired from the Corps in 2013 after more than 40 years of federal service. Stephen William was an avid concertgoer worldwide and spent countless hours in the Alte Oper in Frankfurt, War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, and the Kennedy Center in D.C. A lifelong traveler, Stephen William regularly frequented Lima, Peru; Paris, France; and Frankfurt, Germany with trips to India, Turkey, Brazil, and moreover his 84 years. Stephen William was a kind and generous father who openly shared his interests with his son and lovingly supported his every pursuit. His extensive collection of books and music thoughtfully collected over a lifetime fostered a spirit of intellectual enrichment and curiosity that lives on. A humble and gentle soul to all he met, Stephen William shared his extensive knowledge of literature, music, history, art, and baseball with all. His lifelong love of learning continues in the many who knew him well. His humility and commitment to justice inspire those fortunate to share in it. Stephen William leaves behind his devoted wife, Marina T. Hayes; and his loving son, Stephen Juan Hayes, and daughter-in-law Allison LaCroix. He is also survived by his brother Michael Hayes of Kansas City, MO; sisters Mary Ellen Wolfe of Faucett, MO; and Johannah Hausman, of St. Joseph, MO.\n\nMary Ann M. Herlihy J.D. ‘97\n\nBorn in Chicago, Mary Ann moved to Southern California with her parents at the age of 1, first to Bakersfield and then to Los Angeles to escape earthquakes. Yes, we realize the irony. She spent about six years there before moving to the Bay Area, where she would live the rest of her life and become an integral part of the community. She attended St. Joseph of Cupertino School and would become a dedicated lifelong parishioner, volunteer, Early Childhood Program coordinator, and art teacher and eventually send her own daughters to school there. After graduating from Mother Butler High School, Mary Ann attended San Jose State University, where she majored in history, minored in Spanish, joined the prestigious Black Masque Honor Society, and met her future husband of nearly 51 years, John. Mary Ann and John had two daughters, Shannon and Jennifer, and Mary Ann relished being a mother. She dedicated her life to teaching and volunteering at the girls’ elementary school (St. Joseph’s) and being the best mother, cooking and baking the most delicious food, and attending every game and theater performance there was. And there were a lot. When she was eventually blessed with three grandsons, Hunter, Jax, and Dawson, she continued her outstanding culinary skills and the boys knew, “Nobody cooks as well as Grandma does.” Throughout her life, Mary Ann excelled in several careers, including teaching at several schools in California and Mexico, running her own antique store, and working at Apple. Never content to stop learning, Mary Ann decided to make a career change when her daughters were in high school and pursue her passion for law, returning to school to earn her JD at Santa Clara University. After earning her degree and passing the bar, Mary Ann enjoyed a new career as corporate counsel at various tech companies and taught intellectual property at De Anza College. Mary Ann’s volunteer work was also extremely important to her, dedicating her time to St. Joseph’s, the Cupertino Library, the Red Mass, the St. Thomas More Society, the Saratoga Echo Shop, and her grandsons’ school, St. Frances Cabrini, to name a few. Mary Ann truly enjoyed many things in life, including a well-known lifelong love of rabbits. She was a voracious reader (who we guarantee read more books than you have), loved having tea with her girlfriends, enjoyed watching HGTV and Hallmark (even when the movies were terrible), was a master at sewing, quilting, and Sudoku puzzles, and took excellent care of her garden, filled with delicious fruits, vegetables, and herbs. She also loved to travel (even if she hated flying), making several trips to Hawaii, Europe, the East Coast, the Midwest, Mexico, and Alaska, as well as a few cross-country road trips, and enjoyed spending time at La Selva Beach and Lake Tahoe. Although she leaves behind a heartbroken family (husband John, daughters Shannon and Jennifer, son-in-law Jake, grandsons Hunter, Jax, and Dawson, and brother John), we are grateful that she is no longer in pain and is celebrating in heaven with a glass of Veuve Clicquot and her parents Mary and Vince and brother Michael, all of whom preceded her in death.\n\nHugh F. Jackson III J.D. ‘73\n\nOur beloved husband and father, Hugh, passed away peacefully with his wife Cecilia and children by his side. First of four children, Hugh was born to the late Hugh and Arlene Jackson in Arlington, Massachusetts. The family settled in the Cupertino area, and the summer after he turned 15 he helped his dad and grandfather build the family home on San Juan Road. Hugh never ventured far from the “compound” and lived in Cupertino for most of his life. He was the Senior Class President of the first graduating class of Homestead High School in 1964 and maintained friendships with his classmates throughout his life. Hugh attended Willamette University for a year before returning to the Bay Area to graduate from San Jose State College in 1969. Following graduation, Hugh worked at Lockheed while attending Santa Clara University Law School and became a member of the State Bar of California in 1974. His career spanned over 45 years and he was regarded as one of the preeminent family law attorneys in the county, well respected by his peers and the judiciary. Hugh was a decades-long member of the Santa Clara County and Sunnyvale-Cupertino Bar Associations, and a two-time named “Super Lawyer”. He continuously maintained a Martindale Hubbell AV rating and was often sought by judges to help settle complicated cases as a settlement conference officer or a Judge Pro Tem. He shined in the courtroom and was a tenacious advocate for his clients, but Hugh’s self-proclaimed “greatest accomplishments” were his four children. He was so proud of the kind, compassionate, intelligent, and fun adults they became. His greatest sadness was the death of his oldest daughter, Karen. His greatest joy was bragging about his kids to his friends. Hugh loved to fish, especially with son Glen, taking annual trips to Alaska and the Chetco or Smith Rivers. He loved a good poker game. Daughters, Paige and Grace, learned to play on the laps of his poker buddies at the dining room table during the weekly Wednesday night games. Often accompanied by his pal Jack, Hugh rode 1 of his 4 bikes almost daily, racking up thousands of miles over the last 20 years. A 2009 biking accident resulting in a shattered hip didn’t stop him. He would say, “I’m slow, but I go.” He spent his retirement years with his wife and best friend Cecilia, reading, having lunch with friends, traveling, enjoying his “great backyard”, watching his hummingbirds from the “pavilion”, and of course fishing and playing poker. Hugh’s last week was peaceful and relaxed, even as his giant, generous, fun-loving heart gave out. He will be greatly missed. Hugh is survived by Cecilia and their daughters, Paige and Grace, son Glen (Talita) and granddaughter Juliette, Glen’s mother Jenny Fawcett, siblings Eleanor, Tom (Liz), Harlan (Barbara), and numerous beloved nieces, nephews, and in-laws. In honor of Hugh, the family encourages everyone to take a friend to lunch or fishing or to share an amazing story about Hugh.\n\nSteven D. Jacob J.D. ‘08\n\nNo information is available.\n\nBarry F. McCarthy ‘70, J.D. ‘76\n\nBarry Francis McCarthy passed away peacefully at home surrounded by family. Barry had been suffering from Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) for six years. Barry was born to Vince and Virginia McCarthy on the south side of Chicago, IL, the third of five children. Most of his childhood was spent in Cleveland, OH, where he graduated from St. Dominic’s Catholic School in Shaker Heights, and St. Peter Chanel High School in Bedford. He was an accomplished caddy at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, OH. After two years at Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI, he moved to California with his family in the late ’60s, where he completed his undergraduate work and law degree at Santa Clara University. Barry’s law practice spanned several decades and included extensive work in energy law. He initially worked for the Contra Costa County Legal Services Foundation providing legal assistance to those of low income. He was then hired as an attorney at the City of Santa Clara and went on to become a partner at Duncan, Weinberg, Genzer & Pembroke. He later started his own firm and eventually established a longtime law partnership with Susie Berlin. Barry counseled and advised publicly-owned utilities across the state, guiding them through a changing energy regulatory landscape and helping to usher in a new era of utility regulation. Barry was widely lauded as an expert in the area and was instrumental in mentoring others on legal issues in this field. Barry delighted in telling people he met his wife Carol/CJ McCarthy at a City of Santa Clara hydroelectric dam dedication (this is true) as he did the legal work for the project, and CJ was there representing the city. Former City Manager Jennifer Sparacino took responsibility for this ‘meet cute.’ After retirement from the law, Barry began volunteer work with the Clemency Project and the Pro Bono Project before he became ill in 2017. He was diagnosed with MSA, a rare progressive and degenerative neurological disease. He faced MSA bravely and appreciated the support of family, friends, and caregivers Hannah, Miriam, and, most recently, Julie. Barry was a loving father, husband, brother, and fiercely loyal friend to many. Much to his wife’s chagrin, he charmed many widows at the Westmont of Morgan Hill assisted living facility where he and his wife of 32 years resided for the last 4+ years. In addition to wife CJ, Barry is survived by son Brendan and grandsons Aidan and Robbie, daughter Katie (Plaza), her husband Jakub, and granddaughters Charlotte and Sydney. Barry’s first wife Kris remained close with Barry and CJ. All will miss him terribly. Whether on the playground, in the classroom, on the golf course or in the courtroom, Barry’s talent, creativity, and integrity allowed him to shine. Everything he did, he did well. Along the way, he earned the never-ending love of his family and the unconditional devotion of his numerous friends.\n\nMary Elaine Mielke ‘73, J.D. ‘76\n\nMary Elaine Mielke passed away on July 17, 2022, at the age of 71 after a long illness. She was born in Easton, MD on July 16, 1951, the daughter of the late Herman F. Mielke and Dorothy Williams Mielke. Elaine graduated with the class of 1969 from Easton High School. She continued her education at the University of Maryland, the University of Paris and graduated with honors from the University of Santa Clara, majoring in Political Science. She graduated in 1976 from the University Of Santa Clara School Of Law. After practicing law in California, Elaine moved to Washington, D.C. in 1980, serving as General Counsel to the House Judiciary Committee. Before returning to the Eastern Shore to be with her family, she called Washington, D.C., and Chevy Chase, MD her home, where she had many friends, especially those in the “Book Club”. Elaine treasured her friends and considered them family. She leaves behind her brothers; Allan Mielke (Ellen), and Robert Mielke (Mandy); as well as nieces, nephews, great nieces/nephews, goddaughters, and her dear friend Suzanne Daughters.\n\nFrank Murphy Jr. ‘55, J.D. ‘57\n\nFrank Murphy passed away peacefully, surrounded by family after a short illness at the age of 88. Frank was born to J. Frank Murphy and Marjorie Leibrandt in Santa Cruz, California. Frank graduated from Holy Cross High School and Santa Clara University where he went on to graduate from the law school in 1957. In his youth, Frank enjoyed 2-man beach volleyball and playing as a member of the baseball team at Santa Clara University. An accomplished golfer into his 80s, Frank was also a Life Master bridge player until his last days. Following his graduation from law school, Frank served as a legal specialist in the U.S. Navy and subsequently joined his father’s law firm. Frank practiced family law until he was elected to the District 31 State Assembly Seat, representing his hometown of Santa Cruz and surrounding counties from 1967 through 1972. Frank served as Caucus Chair under Governor Ronald Reagan and held several leadership positions in the state legislature. Following his tenure in the California Assembly, Frank worked as a Legislative Advocate representing numerous clients over the next 30 years. Clients included The California Court Reporters, California Physical Therapy Association, and Golden Gate Fields. Frank wrote the bill that legalized wine to be carried home from restaurants. Frank is a past President of Del Paso Country Club where he enjoyed golf and time with friends and family. Frank retired to Bend, Oregon with his wife Sally in 2004 where they remained until moving to Tucson, Arizona in 2020. Frank is preceded in death by his brothers Peter and Dennis Murphy. Frank is survived by his loving wife of 32 years Sally Murphy, sisters Mary Schuttinger (George, deceased) and Ann Janlois (Mark); Children Michel Murphy, Katie Murphy Foster, Erin Brayer (George), Lisa Buoy (Scott); stepchildren Holly Alexandre (Chris Rowley) and Michael Linn (Anne Remmers) and fifteen grandchildren whom he adored.\n\nJoseph R. Panetta ‘55, J.D. ‘58\n\nIt is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, Joseph Robert Panetta, on December 19, 2022. Joseph was born on August 2, 1933, in Sheridan, Wyoming to Carmelo and Carmelina Panetta, who preceded him in death. He has one brother, Leon E. Panetta. Joseph spent part of his childhood in Monterey, followed by a move to Carmel Valley with his family where he spent the remaining part of his childhood. He attended San Carlos Elementary School and Monterey High School. Joseph then continued his education at Santa Clara University, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1955. Continuing his education at Santa Clara University, Joseph completed law school and passed the bar on his very first try, beginning a long and prestigious career in law. He practiced law in Santa Clara, then moved to Monterey to work in the District Attorney’s Office, followed by many years in private practice. In all, Joseph’s career spanned over 60 years. He gained the respect and admiration of not only those clients he was able to serve, but of the entire law community, including judges, attorneys, and members of the court system. One of the many awards that Joseph received (attesting to this career) was the Chief Justice Phil S. Gibson Award presented to him in 2005. He was also inducted into the Fr. William C. Gainera Society of Santa Clara University that same year. Joseph met the love of his life Anna Chiantelli when they were in high school. They were married on June 25, 1955, and shared 61 years of marriage until Anna’s untimely passing in 2016. Although broken by her passing, he always kept positive and wanted to keep moving forward. Joseph and Anna have three children who survive him: Joanna (Anastacio), Joseph (Julie), and John. Four grandchildren added joy to the family: Anna (Chad), Stephen (Jillian), Brittnie, and Gianna. Five great-grandchildren completed the family: Zander, Kyah, Ella, Miles, and Theo. Family meant everything to Joseph, something he gained from Anna. Besides his career in law, Joseph had many loves including golf, reading, travel, and his love of food. He and Anna traveled to so many places together and he spoke of them often after her passing. Joe was a lifetime member of the Compari Club, a member of the Italian Catholic Federation, the Sons of Italy, and the Jaycees. In addition to his family, Joseph is survived by his brother, Leon (Sylvia) Panetta, nieces, and nephews, as well as cousins in Italy. Joseph also leaves behind many friends and colleagues. We would especially like to thank Steve, JB, Rick, Michael, and Margo. Their friendship, weekly visits, and phone calls, during his illness, meant the world to Joseph and brought him much joy. We would also like to thank Hospice of the Central Coast for the invaluable help and support, with special thanks to Dee, his home health aide, who brought him such joy and comfort with each visit.\n\nPaige R. Parrish J.D. ‘81\n\nPaige passed away peacefully at his home in San Marino, CA on July 28, 2022, after a courageous battle with pancreatic cancer.

Beyers JD ’00, MBA ’01\n\nOn Monday, April 12th, 2021, Dr. Robby Beyers passed away at the age of 62 from complications of ALS.\n\nRobby was born on June 20th in Ann Arbor, MI to Bob and Alice M. Beyers and grew up in the suburbs of Washington D.C. Being one of the most hard-working, intelligent, and stubborn people you’d ever meet, Robby worked his way to having five degrees: an MS, BS, and PHD from Stanford University and an MBA and JD from Santa Clara University.\n\nFor many years Robby worked as a material scientist at the IBM Almaden Research Center, years where, amongst other accomplishments, he co-invented single-wall carbon nanotubes and developed microscopy techniques which are now used throughout the semiconductor industry. His knowledge of material science leant itself well to his next career as a patent attorney, where he authored hundreds of patents, including the “iPhone Patent” (U.S. Patent No. 7,479,949) for the iPhone’s user interface. As a partner at Morgan Lewis LLP he mentored over a hundred aspiring law students.\n\nThe job Robby loved most was being the unofficial photographer for the Stanford Marching Band. For over 40 years he captured the RTFO antics of Stanford University’s famous scatter band. Even after his diagnosis of Lou Gehrig’s Disease in 2018, Robby continued to work on new projects. Despite his growing paralysis, he photographed two more seasons for the band alongside his son Danny, wrote and published a self-help book, compiled decades of band shots into photo books, and even managed to travel across the country to visit his beloved summer home in Vermont. At the time of his death he was participating in an experimental brainwave mapping study through UC San Francisco which will aid future ALS patients and others by allowing computers to directly translate brainwaves into communication. His signature dry humor never wavered throughout his treatment and he was known to claim “ALS Privilege” whenever a situation arose that required him to get preferential attention or an extra serving of his beloved Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.\n\nRobby was preceded in death by his father, Bob. He leaves behind his mother Alice, wife Elena, sons Bobby and Danny, brother Bill, sister Amy and her husband Craig, nephews Kurtis, Kris and Nik, stepson Will, and countless friends, mentees, caregivers, coworkers and band members.\n\nPhilip S. Bianco ’55, JD ’60\n\nIn the courtroom of life, Philip Steven Bianco, Attorney at Law, has rested his case. Following a brief illness, he died peacefully surrounded by family on December 28, 2021, at the age of 88. Phil was born in Visalia, CA, on November 13, 1933, to Luke and Goldie Bianco, owners of Bianco Fine Foods and later, Bianco Wine and Roses. Growing up in the thirties meant struggles for Phil that translated to things like pumping his older (and much bigger) sister, Elinor, to and from school on the handlebars of his bicycle, along with helping in the grocery store every afternoon. He attended George McCann Memorial School, where he was voted class clown, followed by Visalia Union High School, where he medaled in shot put, and graduated with the class of 1951. Anxious to spread his wings, Phil went to college at Santa Clara University where, in addition to his studies, he joined ROTC. He graduated in 1955 with a bachelor’s degree in Political Science. After serving two years in the army, he went back to Santa Clara University for law school, and earned his law degree in 1960. Moving back to Visalia, he initially worked for McKinney & Jordan before hanging the shingle on his own private law practice in 1968. While in law school, Phil met Maureen O’Hara at one of those dances the all-boys’ schools organize to meet women from the all-girls’ schools. They danced that evening and the two started dating. They dated and danced and eventually married on September 12, 1959. They continued to dance through life and marriage for 62 years. Phil is survived by Maureen and his six children, Lisa (William) Marich, Luke (Elie) Bianco, John (Suzanne) Bianco, Deirdre (David) Mangine, Yvonne (Theo) Papanickolas, and David (Megan) Bianco, along with 15 grandchildren. He is also survived by his younger sister, Gloria Bianco. As a father, Phil instilled in his children the value of hard work. Sunday mornings started with church, followed by a hearty breakfast, and then it was get your work clothes on, and everyone headed out to do yard work and chores. In the evening, wages earned that day were recorded in the red book. Very few of his six children ever remember receiving a payout from said red book brilliant from a parent’s perspective. Education was also very important to Phil, and he worked hard to provide each of his children with a college education, fully supporting their individual career endeavors. As a young family, Phil, Maureen, and the kids spent summer vacations at Huntington Lake, often hosting family and friends (most notably, cousin/babysitter Dave Franey). There Phil enjoyed sailing, biking and tennis. Later in life, he caught the travel bug, so he and Maureen took their vacations abroad, visiting several countries over the course of many years. Aside from spinning Maureen on the dance floor during their regular dancing club events, another passion of Phil’s was cooking. His father used to brag that by the time Phil was ten, he could make an entire meal from soup to nuts. Dinner at Phil and Maureen’s was always special, whether they were hosting their gourmet group or cooking Christmas dinner. Phil even taught David Vartanian of the Vintage Press how to make braciole, and he joined him in presenting a master cooking class at the restaurant. Phil looked forward to his Saturday morning coffee with Basil and friends, and enjoyed working in his yard, the occasional football game, and doling out treats to his poodle Mitzi. Never interested in retirement, Phil wanted to die with his boots on. He was a fixture in the Tulare County Superior Court for six decades. He mentored young lawyers, always willing to give advice about their case. He was an old school lawyer, courteous and professional to the other side, and had a true passion for the law. When asked the type of practice he had, he would say that he practiced people law, and that all God’s children need legal representation. He was actively practicing law when he passed away, going into the office five days a week and appearing in court as often. Ask anyone who practiced in Tulare County, and they’ll gladly share a Phil Bianco story, which the family would love to hear.\n\nPhilip T. Bird JD ’75\n\nPhilip T.

Anthony “Tony” De Cristoforo Jr. JD ’58\n\nSacramento, California – Anthony DeCristoforo, Jr. passed away on May 1st at the age of 90. He was the son of Italian immigrant parents, Antonio and Anna DeCristoforo. Antonio immigrated alone in 1906 at the age of 14 from the province of Abruzzo. His only formal education was third grade in Italy. Anna was born in Barrafranca, Sicily, and came with her family to Chicago where she met and married Antonio after his discharge from the United States Army in 1919. She never attended school. Their first born, Joseph, was an Army Captain in World War 11 and in Korea and was chief deputy district attorney in Sacramento before entering private practice with Anthony for ten years. Joseph went on to become a Superior Court Judge and then Justice of the Third District Court of Appeal.\n\nAnthony, known as “Tony” was born in Lodi, California on March 27, 1931 and moved with the family to Sacramento in 1933. He attended Washington Grammar, Sutter Jr. High, Sacramento High and graduated from the University of California in Berkeley and Santa Clara University Law School. He played high school Manhart Legion and Cal baseball briefly and was senior class president, student body boys’ vice president and represented Sac Hi at California Boys State. Before his graduation from law school, he served two years in the U.S.Army and was with the Staff Judge Advocate in Austria and Italy.\n\nAfter practicing law for 26 years, Tony was appointed Superior Court Judge in 1985 where he handled virtually every civil and criminal assignment available to judges. He had an impressive track record for settling cases and bringing parties together. After retirement in 1999, he continued to preside over jury trials as an assigned judge until he devoted his time exclusively to arbitration and mediation before enjoying total retirement. During and after his practice of law he became involved in various community service activities including Mercy Hospital Foundation Board, U.C. Davis Hospital Leadership Council and Jesuit High School Board of Trustees. He was a member of the International Academy of Trial Judges and California Judges Association. He belonged to Del Paso Country Club for many years and achieved lifelong membership in the Sutter Club. He was a member and past president of the Grandfathers Club and enjoyed the comradery of the Over the Hill Gang. In addition, he was elected to the La Salle Club Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nOf greatest importance to him, however, was his wife and family. He considered himself the most fortunate man alive for the happiness he shared with his beautiful wife of 57 years. He married Elinor Templeton on June 29, 1963. And they were blessed with four wonderful children and five grandchildren: Lora (Cindy) and Max, Cara, Tony (Michele) and Elise and A.J., and Joe (Theresa) and Reese, and Joe’s daughter, Cathy. The family met often and regularly and agreed those occasions were the best and most fun gatherings of all their activities. Tony cherished all of his friends-old and new and lived by the mantra “the more the merrier” and was always a gracious host.\n\nTony loved to cook, grow tomatoes and travel. He and Eli, and at various times their children and grandchildren, traveled extensively in various parts of the world, measuring stays from India, Dubai, Singapore, Tahiti and Hawaii, to Rio and Buenos Aires, to Ireland, Scotland, England, Scandinavia, France, Germany, Netherlands, Eastern Europe, Russia, Greece, Turkey, Morocco and of course Italy which they visited over twenty times staying with dear friends in Viareggio.\n\nAmong the expected elements of enjoyment brought by travel, Tony and Eli appreciated the great fortune we have by living in America. His parents came to this country penniless and uneducated. They succeeded in retail business only to lose everything to Chicago hoodlums when their house was blown up and their lives threatened at gunpoint. They came to California and again were successful raising grapes in Lodi only again to lose everything to the Great Depression. Resiliency and determination again prevailed in Sacramento when his father, by now working and tending his own bar, built and established low cost housing units now known as Loaves and Fishes. All was accomplished without financial assistance from outside sources. They were too proud to accept charity and too determined to make it on their own. Tony’s parents instilled the values of dignity, kindness, character and education to their sons. Both boys became judges.\n\nAugust summers at Lake Tahoe were a highlight hosting friends of all ages, water skiing, barbecues, wine and tall tales. Fall Saturdays brought out the Blue and Gold starting with tailgates and ending at Club Pheasant. Whether it was coaching little league or timing swim meets, Tony was the proud and enthusiastic father and grandfather. His family and friends and most of all, the love of his life Eli, brought him immeasurable joy. Tony and Eli’s deep and abiding love for each other has been a beacon to their family. May our Tony, magnificent Husband, Father, Papa, Grampa rest in peace until we meet again. He will be dearly missed by all who knew him.\n\nDonald “Don” J.
