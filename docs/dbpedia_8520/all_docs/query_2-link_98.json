        "text": "Congratulations on the Chancellor's Award for Teaching\n\nHRH The Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh presented the Chancellor's Award for Teaching to John Lee at a gala dinner in the Palace of Holyroodhouse.\n\nJohn Lee has led development of a system known as \"YouTute\", supported by a grant from the Principal's e-Learning Fund (2007-8). In this system, video recordings of tutorial discussions are made available to students. The recordings of entire tutorials (from two cameras and a Smartboard) are streamed in an online environment in which students can extract \"virtual clips\" from the videos, annotate, tag and comment these, share them, and keep them for future reference. The videos are presented accompanied by the tutorial question sheets and, where appropriate, solutions, as well as the relevant lecture slides. This creates a new kind of learning resource, around which the students can develop a collaborative learning activity that will promote reflection, deepen understanding, and add significantly to the value of the original tutorial experience. Students can also observe different approaches to particular problems (and to teaching and learning) as revealed in different tutorial groups' discussions.\n\nA robust prototype system is currently being trialled in Informatics, with great potential also for use in many other areas of the University. Over 50 tutorials were recorded in AY 2007-8 from Informatics 2A/B,which have been made available to all second year Informatics students since then (nearly 400 students). The system was especially appreciated by resit students revising during the summer, who used the system for over 50 hours, suggesting that it may be very helpful for the slower learners.\n\nCollection of tutorials continues. The next step is to integrate recordings of lectures, which are increasingly captured in many subject areas, allowing these also to be re-used in a much more flexible and substantial way. The system is also the focus of research to assist students further by developing automated means of indexing and tagging the videos, exploiting methods developed in existing Informatics research on multi-party meetings.\n\nYouTute exploits vicarious learning, which is learning from exposure to the learning experiences of others. John Lee has a long history of working to develop innovative ways of exploiting the concept of vicarious learning. He has been investigating this idea, with collaborators, in a series of projects since 1995, funded by EPSRC, ESRC, and the Teaching and Learning Research Programme â€” the recent Principal's e-Learning Fund grant has enabled a sharper focus on application to be added to this work. There is clear evidence that vicarious learning has substantial benefits for motivation and attitude as well as discussion skills and learning strategies. Research elsewhere also suggests that vicarious learners learn better if they collaborate with each other. It is to exploit these benefits, and also to evaluate subject-specific learning in much more detail, that practical application has become the focus, leading to the current YouTute deployment.\n\nJohn has been keen to promote innovations in teaching for many years. 10 years ago, in what is now the School of Arts, Culture and Environment, he co-developed the highly successful MSc in Design and Digital Media. He introduced teaching of web design and technologies at a very early stage, and continues to teach these and direct this programme. In his seconded position in Informatics, he was the founding course organiser of the pioneering Informatics Entrepreneurship courses, one of which has also been adapted for use in Design and Digital Media.\n\nLabels: award, chancellor, congratulations, learning, lee, vicarious, youtute\n\nCongratulations to Peter Buneman on his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nA total of eleven past and present distinguished Edinburgh informaticians have been elected to this fellowship. Of these, Peter Buneman, Robin Milner and Gordon Plotkin are current members of the School.\n\nPeter Buneman is distinguished for his advances in uniting programming languages and databases. On the theoretical side this has involved new results in types, monads and structural recursion including (with his student Ohori) type inference for record types, and (with Tannen et al) results that demonstrated a tight connection between monad-based languages and those based on the predicate calculus. On the application side, he used these techniques to demonstrate that -- contrary to an assertion by the US Department of Energy -- queries on existing non-relational genomic databases could be directly evaluated; fruitful collaboration with biologists ensued.\n\nThis research on databases and languages carries over into his recent study of the principles of semistructured or \"web-like\" data of which he is a leading proponent, and co-author of the first text book in this new field. Another recent concern is with the provenance of data on the Web, where data is continually copied and transformed. Already, with Khanna et al. he has built an efficient archiving system for scientific databases; more fundamentally, he seeks a formal basis for tracing provenance.\n\nIn addition to his work in databases, Buneman's early work on mathematical phylogeny underlies most modern phylogenetic reconstruction techniques.\n\nLabels: buneman, edinburgh, FRS, informatics\n\nI am delighted to announce that Robin Milner is returning to the University of Edinburgh, part-time. He will be a SICSA Advanced Research Fellow and will hold the Chair of Computer Science.\n\nRobin Milner graduated from Cambridge in 1958. After short posts he joined the University of Edinburgh in 1973, where he co-founded the Laboratory for Foundation of Computer Science in 1986. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1988, and in 1991 won the ACM's A.M. Turing Award. He joined Cambridge University in 1995, headed the Computer Laboratory there for four years, and retired in 2001. His research achievements (often joint) include: the system LCF, a model for many later systems for interactive reasoning; Standard ML, an industry-scale but rigorously based programming language; the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS); the Pi Calculus.\n\nCurrently he works on Bigraphs, a topographical model which aims to provide a theoretical foundation for mobile interactive systems. Cambridge University Press has just published The Space and Motion of Communicating Agents, Robin's book on this area.\n\nRobin will be giving a short course on bigraphs in Edinburgh on May 13th and 14th 2009. So that we can keep track of numbers, please sign up for the course at http://milner-bigraphs.eventbrite.com (password is milner).\n\nLabels: appointment, bigraphs, computation, edinburgh, forum, informatics, milner, mobility, model, sicsa, ubiquitous\n\nHEFCE has published preliminary results of the RAE.\n\nThese comprise tabulated overall quality profiles per unit of assessment (UoA) and per institution. Each quality profile presents the proportions, rounded to 5 per cent, of research activity in each submission judged to have met each of the quality levels from 4* to unclassified. Alongside the quality profile for each submission, HEFCE publish the full-time equivalent (FTE) number of Category A staff included in the submission.\n\nThe highest, 4* grade is awarded for work that is world-leading; 3* is for internationally excellent, and 2* for internationally recognised research.\n\n4*\n\nQuality that is world-leading in terms of originality, significance, and rigour\n\n3*\n\nQuality that is internationally excellent in terms of originality, significance, and rigour but which nonetheless falls short of the highest standards of excellence\n\n2*\n\nQuality that is recognised internationally in terms of originality, significance, and rigour\n\n1*\n\nQuality that is recognised nationally in terms of originiality, significance, and rigour\n\nU/C\n\nQuality that falls below the standard of nationally recognised work, or which does not meet the published definition of research for the purposes of this assessment\n\nTaking the profile percentages of the FTE staff number gives a research volume profile for each submission.\n\nH-0167 University of Edinburgh\n\nUoA 23 Computer Science and Informatics\n\n4* volume\n\n36.4875\n\n3* volume\n\n52.125\n\n2* volume\n\n15.6375\n\ntotal:\n\n104.25 FTE\n\nThese results confirm that the University of Edinburgh is, once again, the strongest in the UK for research in Informatics and Computer Science.\n\nInformatics at Edinburgh delivers more world-leading (4*) research than anyone else â€” 69% more than our nearest competitor.\n\nWe contribute 10% of the UK's world-leading research in this UoA.\n\nWe deliver more internationally-excellent (3*) or world-leading (4*) research than anyone else â€” 44% more than our nearest competitor. Edinburgh contributes more research that is at least internationally excellent than Oxbridge.\n\nOverall, ours is the largest research grouping in the UK â€” again, 44% larger than our nearest competitor.\n\nAll of our research is internationally recognised, or better (2*, 3* or 4*) â€” and we submitted every eligible member of staff.\n\nRanking\n\nThe use of grade profiles means that there is no single ranking as a result of this RAE.\n\nThe detailed formulae for research funding based on the RAE will not be announced by funding councils for several months. However, future research funding is expected to be based on a weighted sum over the RAE volume profile.\n\nFor any score given as a weighted sum S = Î± 4* + Î² 3* + Î³ 2* + Î´ 1*, where &alpha > 0 and Î± â‰¥ Î² â‰¥ Î³ â‰¥ Î´ â‰¥ 0, Edinburgh scores top in the UK.\n\nProgress\n\nOur volume of world-leading and internationally excellent research (88.6 FTE) exceeds our entire submission to RAE 2001 (80.2 FTE). In addition, we have recently made half a dozen outstanding new appointments, not included in this assessment, that further increase our research excellence and capacity. We have also recently improved our environment by moving into the Informatics Forum â€” acclaimed as the best building in Scotland. This building, designed for interaction, brings an eclectic multidisciplinary collection of over 500 researchers in Informatics and Computer Science together, under one roof.\n\nCollaboration with Linguistics\n\nEdinburgh has the UK's strongest research group in Linguistics, with more world-class (4*) research in Linguistics (10.8 FTE) than any two other submissions combined. Through the Human Communication Research Centre (HCRC) and the Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), we work closely with these colleagues in the areas of Speech and Language Processing, Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Science.\n\nInformatics and Computer Science in Scotland\n\nThe Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA) brings together internationally excellent research from across Scotland, to double the University of Edinburgh's 3* + 4* volume. This critical mass of excellence makes Scotland a match for any leading centre of Informatics and Computer Science, worldwide.\n\nSICSA is actively recruiting, and plans to complete appointments to some 30 new posts by the end of 2010. Our policy is to recruit internationally, to make outstanding appointments that raise our research quality, and further strengthen Scotland's profile in Informatics and Computer Science.\n\nInformatics and Computer Science across the UK\n\nEighty-one submissions were made to UoA 23. The top ten (by 4* volume) account for over 50% of the UK's world-leading research in this UoA.\n\nManchester is our nearest competitor. Cambridge, Oxford, University College, and Imperial College â€” almost indistinguishable from one another â€” come next, followed by Southampton; Bristol, Birmingham and Nottingham complete the top ten.\n\nThe Graph\n\nThe abscissa is a parameter Î²\n\nThe ordinate (plotted on log scale) is V = 4* + Î² 3*\n\nThe point is that whatever reasonable combination of 4* and 3* volume you choose to take, Edinburgh comes out tops.\n\nThe use of a log scale makes it easier to compare relative sizes. For example, the gap between Cambridge and Manchester at the right-hand end of the graph signifies that Manchester has roughly 50% more 3* + 4* volume than Cambridge. A slightly larger gap at the left-hand end between Manchester and Edinburgh signifies that Edinburgh has more than 50% more 4* volume than Manchester.\n\nLabels: 2008, computer science, computing, edinburgh, informatics, linguistics, RAE, Scotland, sicsa, uk"
