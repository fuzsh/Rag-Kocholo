        "text": "In my previous post I briefly mentioned that Jan Van Eyck doubled up the image of Joan of Arc in the Just Judges panel of the Ghent Altarpiece with the English king Richard II. So why would he do this?\n\nBoth Joan and Richard were born on the same date, January 6, the twelfth day of Christmas which is celebrated as the Feast of the Epiphany.\n\nRichard is associated with the date in another sense, a rebellion known as the Epiphany Rising. In January 1400, loyal supporters failed in their attempt to reinstall Richard as king after his throne was usurped by Henry Bolingbroke (Henry IV).\n\nVan Eyck continued with the Joan and Richard Epiphany link in the Singing Angels panel to extend the narrative started in the Just Judges section about Henry Beaufort having fathered an illegitimate daughter. Proof of the mother’s identity has never been satisfactory established, although one name is a popular choice of speculation among historians: Alice Charleton (nee Fitzalan) daughter of Richard Fitzalan, 4th Earl of Arundel. Alice’s father fell foul of Richard II during his reign. He was put on trial and executed by beheading.\n\nBelow is an image of the famous Wilton Diptych, currently on loan to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford from London‘s National Gallery, Although the museum provides extensive coverage about the diptych at its website, there is no mention of its connection to the Ghent Altarpiece and, in particular, how it inspired the Joan and Richard connection in the Just Judges and Singing Angels panels.\n\nThe Epiphany is celebrated as the occasion when three wise men, or kings, travelled from the East to Bethlehem to do homage to “the Infant King of the Jews”. The Wilton Diptych shows three English kings, Edmund Martyr, Edward the Confessor, and a kneeling Richard II alongside John the Baptist holding the Lamb of God.\n\nIn the Just Judges panel Richard II is placed alongside three riders representing kings, Charles V of France, the Dauphin Charles (later crowned as Charles VI), and King René d’Anjou (doubling up as Henry IV King of England).\n\nThe facing panel of the Wilton Diptych shows a heavenly scene depicting the Virgin Mary as the Queen of Angels and carrying the Child Jesus.\n\nThis scene partly inspired Jan van Eyck’s Singing Angels section in the Ghent Altarpiece, except that his angels are without wings and were also inspired by the corbel angels in Cirencester’s parish church of St John the Baptist.\n\nOne feature of the Wilton angels panel that Jan that picked up on and utilised for the singing angels is the extended arms of the angel kneeling in the bottom right corner which point or rest on the Virgin.\n\nThis formation (in reverse) is seen on the foremost singing angel wearing the red cope. Her arms are extended in a similar fashion resting on the lectern and a reference to the Virgin Mary as the Ark of the Covenant, also known as the Ark of Testament, she being the carrier and bearer of Jesus as the Word.\n\nThe faces of the angels in both lineups are all look-a-likes, as are the Cirencester angels. A common feature in all three sets of angels is their curled and wavy hair. Van Eyck utilises this aspect to identify one singing angel in particular and introduce another narrative to why the angels are shown singing, apart from representing seductive Sirens, as I explained in a previous post some time ago.\n\nFaces or visages is another theme that runs through the Ghent Altarpiece. In the narrative of the Epiphany Rising, the face of King Henry IV (who doubles up as King René) is hidden. Later in life Henry’s face became disfigured. Following the death of Richard II, Henry had the former king’s body lie in state with his face uncovered to show the public that no foul play could be suspected in his passing when he was held captive. It was claimed he died of self-imposed starvation.\n\nMy next post will deal with identifying the face of Alice Charleton as it appears in Van Eyck’s Singing Angels panel.\n\nFinally, that the Wilton Diptych is currently exhibited at Oxford is somewhat of an historic reminder of the outcome for many of the rebels who participated in the Epiphany Rising. After their capture they were brought to King Henry IV at the university town to be tried and executed at a place known as the Green Ditch.\n\nThe University’s coat of arms, the Green Ditch, and Richard Fitzalan are all referenced in the Singing Angels panel.\n\nHenry Beaufort served as Chancellor of Oxford University from 1397 to 1399.\n\nIn October 2018, the city of Ghent launched a year long festival in honour of the Flemish painter Jan Van Eyck. The logo produced to identify and name the festival was a boxed figure of speech: OMG! VAN EYCK WAS HERE. It was superimposed on a portrait of an angel from the Singing Angels panel belonging to the Ghent Altarpiece.\n\nThe phrase is in recognition of the Latin inscription featured on the wall above the mirror in Van Eyck’s Arnolfini Portrait. It translates as: “Jan Van Eyck was here 1434”.\n\nI doubt very much if anyone in modern times ever realised there is one significant location apart from Ghent which can also claim that “Jan van Eyck was here” – a town closely linked to not only the Singing Angels but also the Pilgrims panel in the Ghent Altarpiece.\n\nJan van Eyck is said to have travelled widely on behalf of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, predominately to places of pilgrimage. In the Pilgrims panel, a young Van Eyck (circled) can be seen among the group following the towering figure of St Christopher, the patron saint of travellers. His head is shaped to resemble an acorn, the fruit of the oak, and “van Eyck” translates as “of the Oak”. Notice also his pilgrim staff, perhaps made of oak, but also a link to another narrative in the panel that reveals a second identity given to the figure of St Christopher.\n\nThe prominent figure in the Singing Angels group is the one featured as part of the festival logo, but there is a harmonious look to all of the eight angels that suggests they could be from the same family – sisters.\n\nBut their alluring looks and voices could also imply they represent Sirens, island creatures of mythology. Considered symbolic of temptation, the Sirens beauty and beguiling songs would draw ships to wreck on rocky coastlines, and seduce sailors to drown themselves. Sirens are portrayed as birdlike with upper human bodies. They are also sometimes depicted as mermaids.\n\nSo here we see Van Eyck engaged in wordplay, punning Siren and Sister to produce the word Cirencester, a market town in England, famed for its once-thriving wool trade and industry that brought prosperity and riches to the merchants of the town.\n\nA beneficiary of the wool wealth was Cirencester’s parish church of St John the Baptist. Though it originates from the 12th century, its expansion was financed by rich merchants and their families, some of whom were acknowledged with having their coat of arms displayed in the church. And it’s here that the connection and inspiration for Van Eyck’s Singing Angels can be recognised.\n\nThe corbels above the columns in the church appear to be shield-bearing angels, but can also be viewed as sirens of the bird variety. And the heads have a familiar look to Van Eyck’s Singing Angels.\n\nNorth of the church chancel is St Catherine’s Chapel. It dates from around 1150 and contains the residue of a wall painting depicting St Christopher carrying the Child Jesus. This image was the likely source of inspiration for Van Eyck’s Pilgrims panel and probably explains one of the reasons why he painted himself among the group.\n\nThe Child is barely visible against the saint’s shoulder, but Van Eyck echoed the feature by placing a similar head at the shoulder of St Christopher in the Pilgrims panel. Notice also the female figure at the rear in the wall painting. Van Eyck picked up on this and placed the “Wife of Bath” in a similar position. In this instance the young Jan Van Eyck in the Pilgrims panel now became “Jankyn” van Eyck and the woman’s sixth husband in Chaucer’s account of the Wife of Bath in The Canterbury Tales.\n\nAlthough the wall painting is much deteriorated, notice the woman’s focus appears to be on the upper half of St Christopher’s staff and the head to its left. This may also explain why Van Eyck painted himself holding a staff placed ahead of the woman known as “Alice”. As a motif, Van Eyck’s head to the side of the staff is also repeated as the head next to the one held by St Christopher.\n\nBut why Cirencester? Further confirmation of the town and the answer as to why Van Eyck made reference to it can be found in the heads of two other figures in the altarpiece.\n\nThe first is the head of the highest placed angel in the Singing Angels panel. Her head is turned and facing right. She represents Joan of Arc and is formed as the head of a battering ram which I explained in an earlier post – Joan of Arc, battering ram. This is a reference to another location in Cirencester, the Ram Inn. Perhaps Van Eyck boarded there when he visited the town. But there is another narrative that connects to the inn and which Van Eyck embedded in the Just Judges panel of the Ghent Altarpiece.\n\nThere are ten riders in the Just Judges panel. Van Eyck gave each rider four identities and for each identity applied a connection with one of the riders next to it. Two of the identities portrayed by the rider in blue at the back of the group are Joan of Arc and the English king Richard II. They connect in this way: Joan dressed as a man during her heavenly-inspired mission, while Richard II was regarded as presenting a feminine side to his nature while ruling as a king of divine right.\n\nVan Eyck may also have had the famous Wilton Diptych in mind when he painted the Ghent Altarpiece. One half portrays Richard II supported by the English saints King Edmund the Martyr and King Edward the Confessor, alongside his patron Saint John the Baptist. (Two of the riders behind Richard in the Just Judges can also be identified as kings).\n\nIn the diptych’s facing panel, the Virgin Mary is featured bearing the Christ Child, accompanied by a host of heavenly angels, and calls to mind the choir of Van Eyck’s Singing Angels. However, there is seemingly no visual presence of Richard in the panel, unless we take into account the reference to Cirencester.\n\nIn 1399 Henry Bolingbroke, a cousin of Richard II, made a claim for the king’s throne. The outcome was that Richard abdicated and Bolingbroke was crowned king Henry IV. In early January, 1440, a group of Richard’s supporters attempted to restore him as the rightful king but the plot, known as the Epiphany Rising, was uncovered and the ringleaders and their retinue fled West in an attempt to escape and raise support for the rebellion.\n\nThe rebels, with a force of arms, arrived at Cirencester, and the leaders commandeered the Ram Inn as a base to continue the uprising and encourage support for the rebellion against king Henry IV. But the local people were in no mood to join them and within 24 hours four of the leaders were apprehended and beheaded without trial. Other leaders escaped but were soon captured at Bristol, Oxford and Pleshey, and then executed.\n\nThe Singing Angels panel embeds several references to the Epiphany Rising and in particular to the widow of one of the rebels, Joan Stafford. She was the wife of Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey, 3rd Earl of Kent, who was beheaded at Cirencester, pictured here.\n\nThomas had six sisters!\n\nJoan Stafford was also the daughter of Hugh Stafford, 2nd earl of Stafford, KG, (c1342 – October 13, 1386), a second identity given to the St Christopher figure in the Pilgrims panel. Follow the link to find out more about this connection and discover a third identity that Van Eyck applied to the bearded figure. The painter Roger Campin is the fourth identity.\n\nA further connection to the Holland name is the reference Van Eyck made in the Just Judges panel to the Hook and Cod Wars, “a series of wars and battles in the County of Holland between 1350 and 1490.”\n\nRichard II was an uncle to Thomas Holland, as a half brother to his father, also named Thomas.\n\nBarthélemy d’Eyck adapted several features from The Three Marys at the Tomb painting for his composition of the January folio in the Très Riche Heures du Duc de Berry. The field of gold representing the burial shroud of Jesus is one instance. In Barthélemy’s painting the Shroud is the cloth covering the banquet table. Like the field, it glitters with its gold plate and tableware.\n\nIt’s worth remembering that there is more than one narrative attached to the figures and groupings in the January folio. The reason for this was Barthélemy emulating the composition system used by Jan and Hubert van Eyck of embedding several underlying themes and identities in their paintings, notably in the Ghent Altarpiece and The Three Marys at the Tomb.\n\nThe “Field of the Lord” at Saint-Hippolyte-sur-le-Doubs attracted pilgrims for many years because the claimed burial cloth of Jesus, now known as the Shroud of Turin, was displayed there at Eastertime to commemorate the Resurrection of Jesus – a transformation to a new life.\n\nBarthélemy may have likened visiting pilgrims to butterflies, flitting from one pilgrimage destination to another. There were many at that time to choose from, mostly associated with the display of a saintly relic of some sort. But butterflies are also the result of a kind of metamorphosis or transformation, forming their shape through egg, larva and pupa stages to finally become a colorful adult creature of wonder.\n\nGathered around “The Lord’s Table” set for celebrating the Feast of the Epiphany, when the Magi – pilgrims from the East – travelled to Bethlehem to bring gifts and pay homage to the new-born king, are guests of all all types and status, from servants to ‘kings’, all clothed in an array of colours. Even the armoured soldiers fighting in the battlefield tapestry are decked in colourful coats of arms.\n\nArms, representing wings, is the key to recognising the butterfly theme in the January folio, and there is more than one narrative attached to the theme. Arms and wings also link to another theme in the picture, that of warfare and the equipment and methods used for conducting sieges and conquering castles. Notice also some of the figures are placed shoulder to shoulder, i.e. paired or yoked, suggesting they share a fellowship of some kind, or of the same ilk. For instance, take the identical livery colours of two men in the corners or wings of the frame. At top level they represent the Duke of Berry’s servants. However, the kneeling figure also represents Richard II whose father was the Black Prince, Edward of Woodstock. It was also rumoured that Richard was the illegitimate son of one of his mother’s servants. Hence the pairing of livery colours for the two figures.\n\nSo where are the butterfly depictions in the January folio? Apart from bearing in mind the colourful display of some of the men’s garments we can start with the man guzzling at the drinks table, and the man behind eating bread. A list of caterpillar behaviours published on Wikipedia states “Many caterpillars display feeding behaviors which allow the caterpillar to remain hidden from potential predators.” This explains why the faces of the two men are partially hidden. Predators include birds and the drinking man’s hat is meant to represent a pelican arguing with a griffin. An explanation of for this motif is at this link.\n\nFurther along the back line is the blue-collared figure with the floppy head cover. The hat combines with the ear-shaped legs of two soldiers in the tapestry to represent a hare, a play on the word hair and a clue to unravel the connection to the group of three men ahead in the line. The flat cap also represents a sow’s ear. Apart from defining a female pig, a sow is a name given to a slow-moving covered apparatus used in siege situations. This is also echoed in the bell shape collar decorated with musical notes and meant to represent a belfry or siege tower, another slow-moving structure. Notice the collar is fur-trimmed and here we have the first reference to the slow-moving caterpillar known to cause significant destruction to crops. Wikipedia states: “ The English word caterpillar derives from the old French catepelose (hairy cat) but merged with the word piller (pillager). The “Cat” was also a mobile shelter used to approach a castle under siege.\n\nThe next figure in line, and another hidden face, also has a caterpillar collar. The crown of the hat resembles the shape of a torte cake. Torte is a pun on both taught and torque (as in tension). The figure in this instance represents Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV, who rebelled against Richard II and gathered a force against his cousin to usurp the throne. Torque applies to another medieval siege machine, that of a catapult or its larger version the trebuchet. The Old French word trebucher means “overthrow’. Torte also lends itself to the slow-moving tortoise and its tendency not to stick its neck out when danger threatens, hence Bolingbroke’s hidden face.\n\nThe figure representing Henry Bolingbroke is dressed in black and likely a reference to his deteriorating physical health, and being compared to the black and sometimes diseased condition of a caterpillar pupa. It is said that Bolingbroke was “cruelly tormented by festering of the flesh” and his body “completely shrunken and wasted by disease”. He died in 1413 at the early age of 45.\n\nIn this scenario the figure in front of Henry Bolingbroke is the Duke of Gloucester, Thomas of Woodstock. Dressed in silk garments, his fur-lined sleeves represent caterpillars dangling from a tree branch when in the process of creating a silk cocoon. The figure’s face is half covered, his mouth muffled. This motif echoes the muffling feature found in the Just Judges panel of the Ghent Altarpiece and also links to the tonsure feature of Henry’s hat, explained at this link.\n\nThe covering of the mouth is a visual pun on the word moth, a transformation of the silkworm. It is while the moth is in its larvae stage, before its cocoon and adult span that it damages and targets animal-based fabrics such as silk. It can also be understood as damage to the fabric and stability of society, In a sense, the artist has portrayed the Duke of Gloucester as his own worst enemy.\n\nThomas was an uncle to Richard II who made him Earl of Buckingham at his coronation in July 1377. Many of the figures portrayed in the January folio are taken from an extant list of nobles assigned to duties at Richard’s coronation. Thomas was also created Duke of Gloucester in 1485. However, Gloucester was opposed to the king’s royal advisors, namely Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, and Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford. In 1388 Thomas led a group of nobles known as the Lords Appellant to impeach and force the dismissal of some of the king’s royal advisers which included Suffolk and Oxford. Afterwards Richard’s authority as king was somewhat limited but in 1389 with the help of his uncle John of Gaunt he was able to rebuild his power base and exert his authority as king once more. But after further fall-outs with Thomas the king clipped his uncle’s flitting wings and had him arrested and imprisoned in Calais. It is speculated that Richard ordered Thomas’s murder some months later when he was strangled or smothered, or both, and so another reference to the muffled mouth feature in the January folio.\n\nThe Duke of Gloucester did much to undermine his nephew’s authority as the rightful king, prompted in the background by another appellant and claimant for the throne, Henry Bolingbroke. However, Gloucester too would have felt undermined when Richard II’s father, the Black Prince, returned to England to assist in regaining his son’s control over his opponents.\n\nGloucester’s blue headdress is a reference to undermining, and a siege tactic where attackers dig or mine beneath a castle wall to weaken its structure. In medieval times miners believed in underground spirits named Kobolds or Bluecaps. Several legends are associated with them. Miners claimed the Kobbolds lived in the rocks and they could hear the spirits drilling and hammering. This is also a reference to the occupants of a castle under siege hearing the mining attempts of their aggressors on the outside. The colour cobalt blue takes its name from the Kobald spirit, hence the colour of Gloucester’s headdress.\n\nThe mining theme is also reflected in Gloucester’s ‘tunnelled’ sleeves and the ‘castle ramparts’ design of the cape covering his shoulders.\n\nThat Gloucester may have felt undermined on both sides is expressed both in the sense of the chaperon covering his head and as the two men chaperoning him on either side, his brother the Black Prince, and Henry Bolingbroke. Notice two fiendish shapes outlined on either edge of Gloucester’s blue headdress.\n\nThe three men as a group also refer to the maxim “see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil. Bolinbroke has his eyes covered, Gloucester his mouth, and the Black Prince, his ears. This is another motif borrowed from Jan van Eyck’s Just Judges panel in the Ghent Altarpiece.\n\nThe figure wearing the light blue-grey chaperon and dressed in black silk with ‘caterpillar’ trims on the sleeves and collar, is Thomas’s elder brother, Edward of Woodstock, better known in history as the Black Prince. He was the eldest son of king Edward III and heir apparent to the English throne, hence the crown motifs on his black gown. The Black Prince died before his father and it was his son who succeeded to the throne as Richard II, bypassing any claim the duke of Gloucester or Henry Bolinbroke may have considered they had to become king.\n\nThe appearance of the trio warming themselves at the fire is not what it seems to be at first glance. There are other narratives embedded in the composition. Their arms are raised to reveal that there is nohing untoward is hidden in the sleeves of their garments. The marshall, in this instance depicted as Richard de Vere, Earl of Oxford, is inviting the three men to “Approach” but the trio appear hesitant. Hands are raised as if on guard. There are reasons for this: One is the fighting reputation of the marshall and another is the three figures behind him all died from the plague. Not only that the three guests represent English forces that fought on French soil in the Hundred Years War.\n\nThe royal heritage of the brothers Gloucester and the Black Prince is also depicted by their raised arms. The Black Prince strkes the pose of the heraldic Lion Passant Regardent. His head is turned as if looking over his shoulder, possibly wondering if his younger brother, the duke of Gloucester, may have ambitions to usurp his claim to the English throne. Gloucester strikes a similar pose except that both arms are raised to depict him as the heraldic Lion Rampant, while Henry Bolingbroke is shown with only one arm. Like his face, the other is hidden.\n\nThe Black Prince is heir apparent to his father’s throne, and here we have another pun incoporated by the artist – the word heir at the front of the sequence of the four-man group, and hare at the start of the line. In between there are several references to the word hair or hairy caterpillar. The pun is extended to the group of Appellants and the word apparent.\n\nThe identity of the figure at the start of the group is Jean Creton, a French knight and chronicler, who wrote The Metrical History of Richard II, hence the musical notes on his blue collar. The reference to his floppy hat being a sow – a siege apparatus – also points to the word creton as a French term for bacon fat.\n\nReturning to the butterfly theme and the mention of riddles in an earlier post, here’s another:\n\nFirst I was small, and round like a pearl;\n\nThen long and slender, as brave as an earl;\n\nSince, like an hermit, I lived in a cell,\n\nAnd now, like a rogue, in the wide world I dwell\n\nThe answer is butterfly, and I shall explain in my next post how this riddle is translated in the January folio.\n\nAt surface level, the January folio of the Très Riche Heures represents a banquet celebrating the Feast of the Epiphany, but there are other scenarios within the scene that connect to the date of the event, January 6, and the meanining of the word epiphany.\n\nFor instance, one of the identities given to the kneeling figure in the right hand corner is King Richard II. January 6 is the date of his birthday.\n\nPol Limbourg, depicted leaning on the seat behind the Duke of Berry, is one of three brothers associated with illustrating many of the folios in the manuscript. He is named after St Paul the Apostle, who experienced his ‘epiphany’ moment on the Road to Damascus. St Paul’s conversion is celebrated on January 25.\n\nAnother reference which links to the Richard II figure is the Epiphany Rising, the failed rebellion against Henry IV of England in January 1400. Thomas Blount the knight at the table folding the napkin, was one of ‘rebels’ executed. Henry IV is the figure dressed in black placed immediately above him.\n\nThe ‘Rising’ theme is extended to the tablecloth. It represents the burial shroud of Jesus, and his resurrection or ‘Easter Rising’.\n\nThe Resurrection theme extends to the five five figures front of table. Each of them are linked to the three guards and three women featured in the Van Eyck painting titled Three Marys at the Tomb. In fact there are several other references to paintings by Jan and Hubert van Eyck.\n\nFrom these examples we can see how Bathélemy d’Eyck has taken his lead from the Van Eyck brothers to build his composition very much in the ‘jig-saw’ style used by Jan and Hubert in the Ghent Altarpiece, particularly in the Just Judges panel where four identities are applied to each rider. In the January folio the number of identities applied to each figure are usually two, but in the case of the napier in red and white, there are four. This likely a hat-tip to Jan and Hubert van Eyck as the figure behind the napier is Jan and one of the identities given to the napier is Hubert van Eyck (d.1426). The three others are Thomas Blount (d.1400), Amery of Pavy (d.1352), and Geoffroi II de Charny (d.1398) who was the son of the seated Geoffroi de Charny.\n\nThe biblical Epiphany story relates how three Wise Men from the East followed a star to Bethlehem to seek out a new-born king and “do him homage”. They brought with them gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. Hence the tradition of exchanging gifts at Christmas and New Year. So is Bathélemy paying homage to Jan and Hubert va Eyck. Hubert died in 1426, Jan in 1441. The folio is likely to have been painted sometime in the 1440s and probably as a work of homage after Jan had died, hence several pointers to paintings by the Van Eycks.\n\nThe Wise Men of Magi rmade their journey on camels, led by the light of the Star of Bethlehem. The Star and camels are also referenced in the painting.\n\nThe star is introduced by way of Geoffroi de Charny (mentioned in the previous post), a French knight who, along with the French king Jean II, founded the chivalric Order of the Star, sometimes referred to as the Company of the Star, in 1351. Geoffroi de Charney is the bald-headed figure seated opposite the Duke of Berry who also doubles up as King Herod.\n\nThere is an interesting folio (394) which forms part of the Grandes Chroniques de France (14th century) that shows the inception of the Order and some of the knights feasting at table. There can be little doubt that both illustrations were used as a source by Barthélemy for the composition of the January folio. The similarity of the table scene speaks for itself, but the group of knights approaching the French king is echoed in the group of figures huddled together behind the seated Geoffroi de Charney who is dressed in the same colours and style adopted by the Order of the Star.\n\nAs well as being father and son the two Charny figures are connected in two other ways. Charney senior was the first recorded owner of the claimed burial shroud of Jesus, now known as the Turin Shroud. It later passed into the possession of his son, hence the representation of the shroud as the tablecloth. Charney senior also wrote three works on chivalry, the most acclaimed being the Book of Chivalry. However, recent scholarship suggests that this treatise may have instead been written by his son to commerorate his father’s death, in a similar way that Bathélemy d’Eyck has honoured Jan and Hubert van Eyck with his painting of the January folio.\n\n• More revelations about the January folio in my next post.\n\nThere is a key that Pol Limbourg has devised to lock and unlock the composition and its features in the January folio of the Très Riche Heures calendar section, also referred to as “labours of the month”.\n\nHere’s a visual clue. It shows the facing page to the feasting illustration, a list of holy days, or saints’ days, for the month of January, some of which were considered more important than others. At least five of the feast days are referred to in the banquet illustration. There may be others:\n\nJan 1 New Years Day and the Circumcision of the Lord\n\nJan 6 The Epiphany of the Lord\n\nJan 18 St Peter’s Chair, Rome\n\nJan 21 St Agnes, virgin and martyr\n\nJan 25 Conversion of St Paul\n\nThe calendar is not the only list Pol has used to construct his illustration. There are two others, plus references to ‘list’ as a word in itself. The more important of these lists helps identify some of the figures and their placement in the painting. It is a legal document held at the National Archives and provides a list of magnates and their roles in the proceedings at Richard II’s coronation on June 23, 1377. A second list, or inventory, compiled for John duke of Berry, was also utilised by Pol Limbourg. There are three extant inventories covering 1400 to 1416 which list the duke’s possessions during that period. Richard II also produced a ‘treasure roll’ describing the jewels and plate in his possession. It is made up of 40 sheets of parchment and when laid out measures around 28 metres. From this we can see the significance of the tablecloth laden with plate in the Limbourg miniature.\n\nPol Limbourg fuses the lists of Richard and John to create another meaning to ‘lists’ – that of the boundary or partition associated with the sport of jousting, the Middle English word ‘liste’ meaning stripe or strip (of land) on which the knights would compete. He takes the meaning of stripe of strip and applies it another way, almost like a book or page marker. The spine edge of the illustration is a vertical strip or list placed beside the calendar list.\n\nAt the top of the strip is a set of lances and two distinct flags which I am unable to identify, but they probably represent the coming together of two families, possibly in marriage. There is also a steep hill in the background and, combined with the lances, may represent an emerald coloured stone to mount thorns taken from Christ’s crown of thorns, bought by the French king Louis lX in 1238, similar to the thorn mounted on a blue sapphire given to John duke of Berry, mentioned in a previous post.\n\nNext item down is the man wearing a black chaperon, seemingly warming his hands at the fireplace. This is Michael de la Pole, 1st earl of Suffolk. He served as a trusted adviser to Richard II and was once tasked to arrange a marriage for the king. His waving hands are a pointer to his own marriage and wife Katherine Wingfield. A feature of the Wingfield coat of arms are three winged birds, inverted or ‘conjoined in lure’, meaning the tip of the wings point downwards. In this instance the hands or finger tips point upwards, and for two specific reasons.\n\nThe wings are symbolic of the Holy Spirit and the Light of God descending or hovering over Pol Limbourg. It represents a moment of conversion, from darkness to light. Whether Limbourg is implying a conversion experience in his own life, I can’t be sure, but what he is referring to is the Conversion of St Paul on his way to Damascus. St Paul’s feast day is celebrated on January 29 and is listed on the calendar.\n\nNotice also the relaxed pose of Pol Limbourg as he leans forward on the back of the seat in front of him. Observe also that the fabric on the back of the seat is striped. Pol is a spectator or observer in the unfurling events happening before him. He is listless – not a participant. The striped fabric that extends past the end of the table represents the barrier or list between the jousting guests, not for any favours from the absent ladies but from the boy king Richard II and John duke of Berry. Richard’s coronation list provides evidence of competitiveness between high-ranking individuals seeking to be honoured and affirmed.\n\nThe distinct red scarf around Pol’s neck is a reference to the Welsh dragon and relates to another theme in the minature which I will explain in a future post. But it also connects to the next item on the list, the gold, boat-shaped ‘nef’ used as a container for tableware. The boat could be said to be listing, weighed down by its cargo of riches. However, it is kept buoyant and afloat by the saltcellar underneath. The bear and the swan are devices of John duke of Berry. Here the resting Pol Limbourg is referring to the passage from Matthew’s gospel where Jesus invites all who labour and are overburdened to come to him and find rest for the soul as his yoke is easy and his burden light (11:28-30). The ploughing analogy is echoed in the March folio of the Très Riche Heures.\n\nThe three plates are a reference to the tablecloth (a treasure roll) that is another theme Pol has woven into the painting and which I will explain at another time. Likewise the two small cats that represent a play on two words, catalyst and catastrophe.\n\nSo now we arrive at the last item on the list, the young man who has moved from the place of honour to a servant’s role of feeding the white greyhound. As explained in the previous post the placement represents the deposition of Richard ll who was ten years old when crowned king of England, hence the small figure compared to others in the illustration. The white greyhound belongs to the ‘usurper” Henry Bolingbroke, later Henry IV, who coerced Richard into giving up his throne in 1399. The dog at this stage is portrayed in a submissive, begging role, eagerly waiting to be fed by the hand of Richard. The roles later became reversed. Richard’s emblem was a white hart wearing a crown collar. Now it is Bolingbroke’s dog – a hunter – who wears the jewelled collar. It is said that Richard ll starved himself to death after he was captured and later imprisoned in Pontefract Castle. But notice also the black scarf around Richard’s neck. Is this Limbourg suggesting that the king may have been strangled and not starved, or is he referring to the earlier death of one of his enemies, Thomas of Woodstock, who is said to have been murdered while held prisoner at Calais on Richard’s orders? A manuscript of the time depicts Thomas being stangled by his own scarf.\n\nRichard can also be linked to the calendar list. He was born on January 6, Feast of the Epiphany. A failed rebellion against Henry lV to to reinstate Richard ll as king was planned to take place on this feast day in 1400 and resulted in Richard’s capture and eventual death in February that year. It’s at this stage that the black chevron seen on the yellow flag at the top of the list, coupled with the inverted wings above Limbourg’s, head can be recognised as symbolic of hierarchical change. Limbourg has switched the visual references to the order of feasts. Pol, or St Paul, has been raised after falling frorm his horse, while Richard has fallen from grace and occupies the last place. St Paul’s ‘epiphany’ has taken presidence over Richard’s association with the Ephiphany. Richard was a firm believer in the divine right of kings to rule, but here Limbourg demonstrates that divine will is not always “done on earth as it is in heaven”. This links to another aspect of the ‘inverted’ symbols which I shall post on at another time.\n\nOther posts on the January folio of Très Riche Heures:\n\nThoughts on the “wise men”\n\nTelling tales about Chaucer\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nWe’re going on a boar hunt!\n\nThe Pearl Poet… another sighting\n\nA very rich duke and his bear\n\nPlaying hide and seek\n\nA who’s who, what’s what list"
