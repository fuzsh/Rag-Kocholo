        "text": "Annette Joanne Funicello achieved teenage popularity starting in October 1955 after she debuted as a Mouseketeer. Born on October 22, 1942 in Utica, New York, the family had moved to California when she was still young. Walt Disney himself saw her performing the lead role in \"Swan Lake\" at her ballet school's year-end recital in Burbank and decided to have her audition along with two hundred other children. Annette became the last Mouseketeer of the twenty-four that was picked. By the run-through in 1958 of The Mickey Mouse Club (1955) in which she appeared in her own multi-segmented series entitled \"Annette\", she had become the most popular Mousketeer of them all and the only one kept under contract by Walt Disney after he canceled the show. Her popularity was such that by the late 1950s, she was simply known as \"Annette\" -- America's sweetheart and the first \"crush\" for many a teenage baby boomer. Whenever anyone spoke of Annette, no last name was ever needed as everyone knew who you were talking about.\n\nThe popular teenager became synonymous with wholesome entertainment and was borrowed by Danny Thomas in 1959 to play Gina, a foreign exchange student, on Make Room for Daddy (1953) (aka \"The Danny Thomas Show\") and also that same year had a recurring role on the Disney television series Zorro (1957). She made her well as other Disney film vehicles for several years, including Der unheimliche Zotti (1959), Aufruhr im Spielzeugland (1961) and Eine Uni voller Affen (1965). During this time, the modest young singer had a couple of hit singles on the \"Hot 100\" charts, notably, \"Tall Paul\", and as a result, traveled with Dick Clark's caravan on singing tours around the country. At one point, she and teen idol Paul Anka became an item and he wrote both \"Puppy Love\" and \"Put Your Head On My Shoulder\" with her in mind. Their busy careers led to them parting ways.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, American International Films wanted to use her in a fun-on-the-beach movie. They presented the idea to \"Mr. Disney\", as Annette always called him and with whom she was still under contract. To everyone's surprise, he gave his consent, with the only condition being that she make sure her navel was completely covered by a one piece bathing suit. The first movie, aptly titled Beach Party (1963) starred Robert Cummings and Dorothy Malone as the older generation who explore the younger set represented by Annette (as \"Dee Dee\") and her love interest Frankie Avalon (as \"Frankie\"). The \"teenage\" couple (actually she was 20 and he 23) proved so popular in this that they were whisked into a number of sand-and-surf romps (Muscle Beach Party (1964), Bikini Beach (1964), Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) and Das Mädchen vom anderen Strand (1965)) that showcased the actors engaging in harmless fun while singing and dancing in the sand, and falling into silly slapstick.\n\nAfter the surfing craze died out in 1965, Annette married Jack Gilardi, Paul Anka's agent, and became the mother of his three children -- Gina, Jack Jr. and Jason. While appearing in a few other movies that did nothing to further her career, including Morgen holt euch der Teufel (1966), Donner-Teufel (1967) and Head (1968), she appeared as a guest on shows and, most famously, became the spokesperson for Skippy Peanut Butter in a host of commercials. But she phased out her career in favor of family.\n\nShe and Gilardi divorced in 1983. Three years later, she married Glen Holt, a harness racing horse breeder/trainer. Within a year into her second marriage, Annette was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She hid her condition for five years before making a formal announcement (in 1992) for fear that her uncontrollable movements might be characterized as drunkenness. She became the most famous spokesperson for the disease. Annette's life was filmed as a television movie with Annette Funicello - Ein Schicksal (1995) co-starring her good friend, Shelley Fabares. Receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1993, Annette was eventually wheelchair-ridden and went into complete seclusion.\n\nFollowing a tragic March 2011 incident in which their Los Angeles house burnt to the ground and both Annette and husband Glen were hospitalized with smoke inhalation, the couple moved to Bakersfield, California. A little more than a year later, and over 25 years after she was diagnosed with this long and painful illness, Annette passed away on April 8, 2013 from complications at age 70. To the present, her foundation continues to raise money to help find cures for this and other debilitating disorders, including Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\nBonnie Franklin, of the freckled, fair-skinned, hazel-eyed, rosy-cheeked, carrot-haired variety, could light up a room with her buoyant, folksy personality, but she could be quite serious in a take-charge manner when it came to purposeful acting work. It took Norman Lear and a highly popular TV sitcom to finally make the 31-year-old performer a household star in the mid-1970s.\n\nShe was born Bonnie Gail Franklin in Santa Monica, California on January 6, 1944, the daughter of Samuel Benjamin, an investment banker, and Claire (née Hersch) Franklin, both of Jewish descent. She was thrust onto the stage at a very young age as a child tap dancer and became the protégé of consummate tapper Donald O'Connor. At age 9, she performed with O'Connor on NBC's The Colgate Comedy Hour (1950). A year later, she performed as one of the Cratchit daughters in the Shower of Stars (1954) TV version of \"A Christmas Carol\", starring Fredric March and Basil Rathbone as \"Scrooge\" and \"Marley\", respectively. The young girl then appeared, unbilled on film, playing sweet young things in the rural comedy, The Kettles in the Ozarks (1956), Alfred Hitchcock's Der falsche Mann (1956) and the Sandra Dee/Troy Donahue's box office tearjerker, Die Sommerinsel (1959).\n\nAt age 13, the family moved from Santa Monica to upper-scale Beverly Hills. Graduating from Beverly Hills High School in 1961, Bonnie studied at Smith College for a time where the freshman co-ed acted in an Amherst College production of \"Good News\". She then transferred to UCLA and majored in English. Following her studies, she returned to TV and appeared in lightweight comedies that welcomed her perky, pixie-like presence. These included mid-to-late 1960s episodes of Mr. Novak (1963), Gidget (1965), Solo für O.N.K.E.L. (1964), Unser trautes Heim (1965) and Die Munsters (1964). In 1967, she married Ronald Sossi, a playwright best-known for his writing/producing chores on the TV series, The Rat Patrol (1966). The marriage, however, was short-lived and ended in 1970.\n\nIt was on the musical stage that Bonnie found breakthrough success. Following diligent work in \"Drat the Cat!\" (1965), \"Your Own Thing\" (1968), \"George M.!\" (1969) and \"Dames at Sea\" (1969), she took her first Broadway curtain call in \"Applause\", the well-received 1970 musical version of Alles über Eva (1950), starring Lauren Bacall. Bonnie played a theater \"gypsy\", named \"Bonnie\", who sings and dances to the title song backed by her \"band of gypsies\". Bonnie won the Outer Critics and Theatre World awards and a 1970 Tony nomination for her effort here. She continued on the stage with prime roles in \"A Thousand Clowns\" (1971), the title role in \"Peter Pan\" (1973), and the revue \"Oh, Coward!\" (1975).\n\nIt wasn't until Bonnie was handed the prime role of \"Ann Romano\", a divorced mom raising two daughters (Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli) on One Day at a Time (1975), did she become a viable star. Although her contagious cheerfulness and beaming smile was part of her value on the comedy show, Franklin desired to focus on taboo TV subjects such as divorce, birth control, sexual harassment and suicide, as well as getting laughs. While the program didn't match the ground-breaking importance or success of an Es bleibt in der Familie (1971), the show did command consistent and respectable ratings (\"Top 20\" for seven of its nine years) and lasted on CBS until 1984. Bonnie received one Emmy nomination and two Golden Globe nominations during the sitcom's run, and managed to find time to squeeze in a few other TV-movie projects as well -- A Guide for the Married Woman (1978), Breaking Up Is Hard to Do (1979), the title role in Portrait of a Rebel: The Remarkable Mrs. Sanger (1980) and Your Place... or Mine (1983). Bonnie also directed episodes of One Day at a Time (1975), Karen's Song (1987) Charles in Charge (1984) and Familie Munster (1987).\n\nFollowing the show's demise, Bonnie seemed to keep a lower profile on camera, focusing instead on theatre roles and in several humanitarian efforts. Sporadic guest roles on Burkes Gesetz (1994) (revived), Zwei Singles im Doppelbett (1995) and Ein Hauch von Himmel (1994) was highlighted by a 2005 TV reunion with her One Day at a Time (1975) TV family, The One Day at a Time Reunion (2005). Her return to the theatre, after a break of 14 years, included roles in a variety of plays: \"Happy Birthday and Other Humiliations\" (1987), \"Annie Get Your Gun\" (1988) (as \"Annie Oakley\"), \"Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune\" (1988), \"Love and Guilt and the Meaning of Life\" (1990), \"Grace & Glorie\" (1996), \"All I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten\" (1997), \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1999), \"Same Time, Next Year\" (2000), \"Dancing at Lughnasa\" (2003), \"A Touch of the Poet\" (2005), \"A Delicate Balance\" (2007) and as crotchety \"Ouisar\" in \"Steel Magnolias\" (2011). In addition, she put together and toured in her own cabaret act and appeared in nearly a dozen staged readings with Los Angeles' Classic and Contemporary American Playwrights.\n\nBonnie was a tireless activist for a variety of charities and civic-oriented issues, among them AIDS care and research and the Stroke Association of Southern California. More recently, Bonnie reunited with \"One Day at a Time\" daughter Valerie Bertinelli in a 2011 episode of Bertinelli's sitcom, Hot in Cleveland (2010), and, a year later, played a recurring nun in the daytime Schatten der Leidenschaft (1973).\n\nIn September of 2012, Bonnie was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died several months later on March 1, 2013. Her second husband of 29 years, TV/film producer Marvin Minoff, who produced Bonnie's TV movie, Portrait of a Rebel: The Remarkable Mrs. Sanger (1980), as well as the film, Patch Adams (1998), died in 2009.\n\nUsually sized up as an erudite gent, advice-spouting father or uptight, pompous neighbor, the acting talents of Conrad Bain were best utilized on stage and on TV. Born in Lethbridge, Alberta, on February 4, 1923, Conrad Stafford Bain was a twin son (the other was named Bonar) born to Stafford Harrison Bain, a wholesaler, and Jean Agnes (née Young). He enjoyed Canadian sports growing up (ice hockey, speed skating), but picked up an interest in acting while in high school.\n\nElecting to train at Alberta's Banff School of Fine Arts after graduating, he met Monica Marjorie Sloan, an artist, while there. His acting pursuit was interrupted by WWII when he subsequently joined the Canadian army. Picking up here he left off following his discharge, he studied at New York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He also married Ms. Sloan in 1945 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen the following year. The couple went on to have three children -- Jennifer, Mark and Kent.\n\nMaking his stage debut in a Connecticut production of \"Dear Ruth\" in 1947, Bain also appeared in \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" and a tour of \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" before making his off-Broadway debut in a 1956 Circle-in-the-Square revival of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh,\" a production that made a star out of Jason Robards. Following an inauspicious Broadway bow in \"Sixth Finger in a Five Finger Glove\", which closed after only one day, he joined the Stratford (Ontario) Shakespeare Festival for their 1958 season, appearing in \"A Winter's Tale,\" \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and \"Henry IV, Part I.\"\n\nFair in complexion and exceedingly genial in demeanor, the wry and witty blond actor graduated into other Broadway work, particularly drama, with strong roles in \"Candide,\" \"Advise and Consent,\" \"An Enemy of the People,\" \"Twigs\" and \"Uncle Vanya.\" He also built up his regional and repertory credits during the early 1960s with parts in \"King Lear,\" \"The Firebugs,\" \"Death of a Salesman\" and \"The Shadow of Heroes\" at Seattle Rep. Later in the decade he began to focus more intently on TV, usually playing cerebral, white-collar types (district attorneys, stock brokers, doctors, politicos).\n\nBain eventually found an \"in\" with daytime drama, which included a recurring role on Dark Shadows (1966) (as an innkeeper), and a part on The Edge of Night (1956) in 1970. He broke completely away, however, from his trademark dramatics when the 49-year-old actor was \"discovered\" for prime-time TV by Norman Lear and offered a supporting role opposite Bea Arthur and Bill Macy in Norman Lear's landmark, liberally-sliced comedy series Maude (1972), a spin-off of Lear's equally landmark Es bleibt in der Familie (1971) sitcom. Conrad was cast as Rue McClanahan's stuffy, conservative doctor/husband, Arthur Harmon, who usually was at political odds with free-wheeling feminist Maude Finlay.\n\nThe role moved Bain into the prime TV comedy character ranks. Following the show's lengthy run (1972-1978), he was given the green light by Lear to move into his own comedy series with Noch Fragen Arnold? (1978) as the wealthy father of a girl and adoptive father of two African-American children. While young Gary Coleman, the compact, precocious, mouthy dynamo, may have stolen the show, the good-humored Bain remained a strong center and voice of reason until the show's demise in 1986. Three was not a charm when Bain went into a third new comedy series, Mr. President (1987), with Conrad as a loyal aide-de-camp to \"President\" George C. Scott. The show, created not by Lear but by Johnny Carson, lasted only 24 episodes.\n\nDuring and after his lengthy 70s and 80s TV success, Conrad would continue to return to his first love, the stage, in such productions as \"Uncle Vanya,\" \"The Owl and the Pussycat,\" \"On Golden Pond,\" \"The Dining Room\" and \"On Borrowed Time\", the last being a 1992 return to Broadway after nearly two decades. Films, on the other hand, were a non-issue at this point. Earlier minor turns included Clint Eastwood's Coogans großer Bluff (1968), Gene Hackman's Kein Lied für meinen Vater (1970), Woody Allen's Bananas (1971), Sean Connery's Der Anderson-Clan (1971) and Barbra Streisand's Sandkastenspiele (1972). His last stop in films was an engaging part as a befuddled grandpa opposite the perennially crusty Mary Wickes in Grüße aus Hollywood (1990) starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine. One of Bain's last on-camera appearances was recreating his Phillip Drummond role from Noch Fragen Arnold? (1978) on a 1996 episode of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\".\n\nOther than a stage role in \"Ancestral Voices\" in 2000, Conrad turned for a time to screen-writing but later comfortably retired to the Brentwood area of Los Angeles. Moving to a Livermore California retirement home in 2008, wife Monica died a year later. Bain passed away there quietly of natural causes on January 14, 2013, less than a month short of his 90th birthday. His twin brother Bonar died in 2005.\n\nA supremely gifted, versatile player who could reach dramatic depths, as exemplified in her weary-eyed, good-hearted waitress in Die letzte Vorstellung (1971), or comedy heights, as in her sadistic drill captain in Schütze Benjamin (1980), Eileen Brennan managed to transition from lovely Broadway singing ingénue to respected film and television character actress within a decade's time. Her Hollywood career was hustling and bustling at the time of her near-fatal car accident in 1982. With courage and spirit, she recovered from her extensive facial and leg injuries, and returned to performing... slower but wiser. On top of all this, the indomitable Eileen survived a bout of alcoholism and became recognized as a breast cancer survivor, having had a mastectomy in 1990. On camera, she still tosses out those trademark barbs to the delight of all her fans, as demonstrated by her more-recent recurring roles as the prying Mrs. Bink on Eine himmlische Familie (1996) and as Zandra, the disparaging acting coach, on Will & Grace (1998).\n\nShe was born with the highly unlikely marquee name of Verla Eileen Regina Brennan in Los Angeles, California, the child of Irish-Catholic parents Regina (\"Jeanne\") Manahan (or Menehan), a minor silent film player, and John Gerald Brennan, a doctor. Following grade school education, she attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. and appeared in plays with the Mask and Bauble Society during that time. She then went on to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Her lovely soprano coupled with a flair for comedy was the winning combination that earned her the break of her budding career as the not-so-dainty title role in the off-Broadway, tongue-in-cheek operetta \"Little Mary Sunshine\". For this 1959 endeavor, Eileen not only won an Obie Award, but was among an esteemed group of eight other thespians who won the Theatre World Award that year for \"Promising New Personality\", including Warren Beatty, Jane Fonda, Carol Burnett and a very young Patty Duke.\n\nUnwilling to be pigeonholed as a singing comedienne, Eileen took on one of the most arduous and demanding legit roles a young actress could ask for when she portrayed Annie Sullivan role in a major touring production of \"The Miracle Worker\" in 1961. After proving her dramatic mettle, she returned willingly to the musical theatre fold and made a very beguiling Anna in a production of \"The King and I\" (1963). She took her first Broadway bow in another comic operetta, \"The Student Gypsy\" (1963). In the musical, which was an unofficial sequel to her \"Mary Sunshine\" hit, she played a similarly-styled Merry May Glockenspiel, but the show lasted only a couple of weeks. Infinitely more successful was her deft playing of Irene Malloy alongside Carol Channing's Dolly Levi Gallagher in the original Broadway production of \"Hello, Dolly!\" (1964). Eileen stayed with the role for about two years.\n\nBy this time, Hollywood beckoned and Eileen never looked back... or returned to sing on Broadway. After a support role in the film comedy Scheidung auf amerikanisch (1967) starring Debbie Reynolds and Dick Van Dyke, Eileen's talents were selected to be showcased on the irreverent variety show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1967). But what seemed to be an ideal forum to show off her abilities didn't. Overshadowed by the wackier talents of Goldie Hawn, Ruth Buzzi and Jo Anne Worley, who became television comedy stars from this, Eileen seemed out of sync with the knockabout slapstick element. She left the cast before the show barely got off the ground. \"Laugh-In\" (1968-1973) went on to become a huge cult hit.\n\nIn retrospect, this disappointment proved to be a boon to Eileen's dramatic film career. Set in a dusty, barren town, she played up her hard looks and earned terrific reviews for her downbeat role of Genevieve, the careworn waitress, in Peter Bogdanovich's Die letzte Vorstellung (1971). As part of a superb ensemble cast, her hard-knocks vulnerability and earthy sensuality added authenticity to the dreary Texas surroundings. Following this, she scored great marks for her brothel madam/confidante in George Roy Hill's ragtime-era Oscar winner Der Clou (1973). Bogdanovich himself became a fan and used Eileen again and again in his subsequent films -- the ambitious but lackluster Daisy Miller (1974) and At Long Last Love (1975). At least, the latter movie allowed her to show off her singing voice. Her comedic instincts were on full display too in the all-star mystery spoofs Eine Leiche zum Dessert (1976) and Der Schmalspurschnüffler (1978) where she fared quite well playing take-it-on-the-chin dames.\n\nEileen hit the apex of her comic fame playing the spiky and spiteful drill captain who mercilessly taunts and torments tenderfoot Goldie Hawn in the huge box-office hit Schütze Benjamin (1980). She deservedly earned a \"best supporting actress\" Oscar nomination for her scene-stealing contribution and was given the chance to reprise the role on the television series that followed. Starring Lorna Patterson in the Hawn role, Private Benjamin (1981) was less successful in its adaptation to the smaller screen but Eileen was better than great and earned both Emmy and Golden Globe Awards in the process.\n\nDuring the show's run in 1982, Brennan had dinner one evening with good friend Goldie Hawn at a Los Angeles restaurant. They had already parted ways when Brennan was hit and critically injured by a car while crossing a street. Replaced in the television series (by \"Alice\" co-star Polly Holliday), her recovery and rehabilitation lasted three years, which included an addiction to painkillers. She returned to the screen in another amusing all-star comedy whodunit, Alle Mörder sind schon da (1985), in which she played one of the popular game board suspects, Mrs. Peacock. While looking weaker and less mobile, she showed she had lost none of the disarming causticity that made her a character star.\n\nForging ahead, Eileen went on to recreate her tough luck waitress character in Texasville (1990), the sequel to Die letzte Vorstellung (1971), and also appeared with Bette Midler in the overly mawkish Stella (1990). However, for the most part, she lent herself to playing eccentric crab apples in such lightweight fare as Rented Lips (1987), 900.000 $ zuviel (1988), Das Leben geht weiter (1997), Pants on Fire (1998), Jeepers Creepers - Es ist angerichtet (2001), Miss Undercover 2 (2005) and Naked Run (2011). She has also provided crotchety animated voices for series cartoons.\n\nEileen Brennan died at age 80 on July 28, 2013 at her Burbank, California home after a battle with bladder cancer. She is survived by her two sons, Patrick (formerly a basketball player, now an actor) and Sam (a singer), from her first and only marriage in the late 1960s to mid-1970s.\n\nBorn on November 1, 1942, the eldest of three born to an Iowa general storeowner, Marcia Wallace endured a troubled childhood (alcoholism, physical abuse). Performing in high school plays as a teenager, she studied at Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa, where she majored in English and theatre.\n\nMarcia initially induced laughs because of a weight problem, playing plump, self-deprecating characters in such musicals as \"The Music Man\". She also supplemented her very modest income at the time, substitute teaching in the Bronx. Managing to drop much of her excess weight over time, she found, to her delight, that she could still make people laugh. Finding an invaluable training ground with the improvisational comedy group, \"The Fourth Wall\", in 1968, she appeared with the company off-Broadway for a spell. In between times, she studied with acting guru Uta Hagen.\n\nMarcia began to flesh out her on-camera resume at first with bit roles on such shows as \"The Invaders\" (as a courtroom spectator), \"Bewitched\" (as Darrin's secretary), \"The Brady Bunch\" (as a saleswoman), she earned her first on-camera break with recurring appearances on The Merv Griffin Show (1962). As a direct result, she won the best role of her career as \"Carol Kester\", the chatty receptionist on The Bob Newhart Show (1972) after only a year or so in Hollywood. For seven years, Marcia won tons of fans as the slightly ditsy co-worker and confidante who was always looking for that \"special guy\" to walk through the door.\n\nDuring that time and after, she guested and added fun to many popular lightweight 70's and 80's shows of the day, including \"Love, American Style,\" \"The Love Boat,\" \"Fantasy Island,\" \"CHiPS,\" \"Magnium, P.I.,\" \"Gimme a Break,\" \"Finder of Lost Loves,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Alf,\" \"Night Court,' \"Small Wonder\" and \"Charles in Charge.\" She also decorated and perked up a few TV movies -- The Castaways on Gilligan's Island (1979), Highway Chaos (1980), Pray TV (1980) -- and the full length features a few films Teen Witch (1989), Meine Mutter ist ein Werwolf (1989) and Ghoulies III (1990). She went on the enjoy regular work in commercials for over three decades (Kraft a la Carte, Crest, Taster's Choice).\n\nFollowing her TV success on the \"The Newhart Show,\" Marcia kept visible as a recurring game show panelist on such shows as \"The Match Game,\" \"Password,\" \"The $10,000 Pyramid\" and \"Hollywood Squares.\" On the summer stock and dinner theater circuits, Marcia found engaging work in such comedies as \"Plaza Suite,\" \"Born Yesterday,\" \"The Prisoner of Second Avenue,\" \"The Sunshine Boys,\" and \"Last of the Red Hot Lovers,\" as well as the musicals \"Gypsy\" and \"Promises, Promises.\"\n\nIn 1985, Marcia was diagnosed with breast cancer. She eventually became an activist and lecturer on breast cancer awareness, educating the public about early detection. She was also the prime caretaker for her husband, hotelier Denny Hawley, when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He passed away in 1992. They adopted one child, Michael.\n\nMarcia's career would gain a second career wind in voiceovers. Today's generations will recognize her Emmy-winning voice-work as Bart's teacher, \"Mrs. Edna Krabappel\" on the long-running animated series Die Simpsons (1989). Her voice was also utilized on such animated projects as \"Darkwing Duck,\" \"Raw Toonage,\" \"Camp Candy,\" \"Batman: The Animated Series,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"Cow and Chicken,\" \"The Angry Beavers\" and Rugrats\" as well as providing several voices for the animated film Die Monster Uni (2013).\n\nShe has guest-hosted televised comedy clubs and talk shows, and was the actual co-host of a diet show on cable. Marcia remained on the lecture circuit and published her own 2004 memoir (Don't Look Back, We're Not Going That Way!) which gently and admirably laces her myriad of struggles with wit, humor and a positive outlook.\n\nInto the millennium, she was seen as Maggie the housekeeper on the short-lived, irreverent TV series spoof Hier kommt Bush! (2001) starring Timothy Bottoms. In 2009, she was seen as Annie Wilkes on the daytime soaper Schatten der Leidenschaft (1973). A few scattered films appeared on the horizon, including the comedies Forever for Now (2004), Big Stan (2007) and Tru Loved (2008).\n\nMarcia's lengthy battle with illness ended on October 25, 2013, when the 70-year-old actress died of breast cancer complications (pneumonia and sepsis).\n\nMargaret Thatcher was born on October 13, 1925 in Grantham, England, the younger daughter of Alfred and Beatrice Roberts. Her father was a greengrocer and respected town leader, serving as lay-leader with their church, city-alderman and then as mayor. He taught Margaret never to do things because other people are doing them; do what you think is right and persuade others to follow you.\n\nShe attended Oxford University from 1943 to 1947 and earned a degree in Chemistry, but it was clear from early on that politics was her true calling. She stood as a Conservative candidate from Dartford in the 1950 and 1951 elections. She married Denis Thatcher in December 1951 and they had twin children, Mark Thatcher and Carol Thatcher. She practiced tax law for a time in the 1950s, but was elected to Parliament from Finchley in 1959. Two years later, she was appointed to the cabinet as Minister of Pensions. In 1970, she was appointed Minister for Education and earned the title \"Thatcher the Milk Snatcher\", for eliminating free milk for schoolchildren in a round of budget-cutting. After the Conservative Party lost both general elections in 1974, she defeated Edward Heath for the leadership of the party.\n\nShe was elected Prime Minister in May 1979 and served for eleven and a half years, longer than any other British Prime Minister in the 20th Century. As Prime Minister, she was staunchly capitalist and bent on wiping socialism from the face of Britain. During her tenure, she cut direct taxes, spending and regulations, privatized state-industries and state-housing, reformed the education, health and welfare systems, was tough on crime and espoused traditional values. Her time in office was eventful, having to contend with an economic recession, inner-city riots and a miners' strike.\n\nHer first great triumph in office was the Falklands War in 1982, when she sent British troops to reclaim British possessions off the coast of South America that had been invaded and occupied by Argentina. The British won that war and it showed the world that Britain was once again a power to be reckoned with. Her time in office saw unprecedented economic prosperity among the middle and upper classes, but this was contrasted by unemployment levels not seen since the 1930s, a rise in homelessness and the end of Britain's major industries. She was a staunch political ally of Republican American President Ronald Reagan. They both advocated tough foreign and defence policies, but they also developed a constructive relationship with reforming Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev which helped to bring the Cold War to an end. Thatcher also persuaded President George Bush to send troops to Saudi Arabia right after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990.\n\nHer staunch advocacy of the Poll Tax and her refusal to endorse a common currency for Europe led the Conservative party to force her out of office in a bloody internal coup. She was forced to resign as Prime Minister in November 1990. Since she left office, she was introduced to the House of Lords in 1992 as Baroness Thatcher. She travelled the world, touring the lecture circuit promoting her causes and was president of numerous organizations dedicated to her causes. In the last few years, her health suffered and she no longer spoke in public.\n\nWinner was an only child, born in Hampstead, London, England, to Helen (née Zlota) and George Joseph Winner (1910-1975), a company director. His family was Jewish; his mother was Polish and his father of Russian extraction. Following his father's death, Winner's mother gambled recklessly and sold art and furniture worth around £10m at the time, bequeathed to her not only for her life but to Michael thereafter. She died aged 78 in 1984.\n\nHe was educated at St Christopher School, Letchworth, and Downing College, Cambridge, where he read law and economics. He also edited the university's student newspaper, Varsity (he was the youngest ever editor up to that time, both in age and in terms of his university career, being only in the second term of his second year). Winner had earlier written a newspaper column, 'Michael Winner's Showbiz Gossip,' in the Kensington Post from the age of 14. The first issue of Showgirl Glamour Revue in 1955 has him writing another film and showbusiness gossip column, \"Winner's World\". Such jobs allowed him to meet and interview several leading film personalities, including James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich. He also wrote for the New Musical Express.\n\nHe began his screen career as an assistant director of BBC television programmes, cinema shorts, and full-length \"B\" productions, occasionally writing screenplays. In 1957 he directed his first travelogue, This is Belgium, shot largely on location in East Grinstead. His first on-screen credit was earned as a writer for the crime film Man with a Gun (1958) directed by Montgomery Tully. Winner's first credit on a cinema short was Associate Producer on the film Floating Fortress (1959) produced by Harold Baim. Winner's first project as a lead director involved another story he wrote, Shoot to Kill (1960). He would regularly edit his own movies, using the pseudonym \"Arnold Crust\". He graduated to first features with Play It Cool (1962), a pop musical starring Billy Fury.\n\nWinner's first significant film was West 11 (1963), a sympathetic study of rootless drifters in the then seedy Notting Hill area of London. Filmed on location (always Winner's preference), with a script by Willis Hall and Keith Waterhouse, the film remains an interesting contribution to the working-class realism wave of the early 1960s. Following differences with his producer, Daniel Angel, Winner (who had wanted to cast Julie Christie in the main female role) resolved to produce as well as direct his films and set up his own company, Scimitar. The System (1964) and the hectic, dystopian Was kommt danach...? (1967) were paired pieces starring Oliver Reed that continued Winner's exploration of alienated youth adrift in a rising tide of affluence, dreaming of an alternative life they can never achieve. These films and the exuberant 'Swinging London' comedy Minirock und Kronjuwelen (1967), also starring Reed, were well-suited to Winner's restless, intrusive camera style and staccato editing. They were followed by Hannibal Brooks (1969), a witty Second World War comedy written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, which attracted attention in America and led to Winner pursuing a Hollywood career in the 1970s.\n\nWinner now developed a new reputation as an efficient maker of violent action thrillers, often starring Charles Bronson. The most successful and controversial was Ein Mann sieht rot (1974), with Bronson cast as a liberal architect who embraces vengeance after the murder of his wife and daughter. An intelligent analysis of the deep roots of vigilantism in American society, Death Wish is restrained in its depiction of violence. With his obsessive need to work, Winner accepted many inferior projects, including two weak Death Wish sequels, though occasionally he tried to make more prestigious films, notably Das Loch in der Tür (1971), a prequel to Henry James' The Turn of the Screw, made in Britain with Marlon Brando; and Alles nur Theater (1989), a satisfying version of Alan Ayckbourn's bittersweet comedy.\n\nBy the 1990s Winner had become less prolific, and reaped no benefit from the Lottery-prompted rise in genre film-making, which favoured the young and inexperienced. Dirty Weekend (1993), a rape-revenge movie with a female vigilante, aroused considerable controversy, but hardly enhanced Winner's reputation; Parting Shots (1998), a comedy revenge thriller suffused with allusions to Death Wish and restaurant scenes invoking Winner's current incarnation as a food critic, is perhaps his swan song.\n\nIn an interview with The Times newspaper, Winner said liver specialists had told him in summer 2012 that he had between 18 months and two years to live. He said he had researched assisted suicide offered at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, but found the bureaucracy of the process off-putting. Winner died at his home, Woodland House in Holland Park, on 21 January 2013, aged 77. Winner was buried following a traditional Jewish funeral at Willesden Jewish Cemetery.\n\nPaul William Walker IV was born in Glendale, California. He grew up together with his brothers, Caleb and Cody, and sisters, Ashlie and Amie. Their parents, Paul William Walker III, a sewer contractor, and Cheryl (Crabtree) Walker, a model, separated around September 2004. His grandfather, William Walker, was a Pearl Harbor survivor and a Navy middleweight boxing champion, while his maternal grandfather commanded a tank battalion in Italy under General Patton during World War II. Paul grew up active in sports like soccer and surfing. He had English and German ancestry.\n\nPaul was cast for the first season of the family sitcom, Throb (1986) and began modeling until he received a script for the 1994 movie, Tammy and the Teenage T-Rex (1994). He attended high school at Village Christian High School in Sun Valley, California, graduating in 1991. With encouragement from friends and an old casting agent who remembered him as a child, he decided to try his luck again with acting shortly after returning from College.\n\nHe starred in Road Trip ins Chaos (1998), a campy, silly but surprisingly fun film which failed to garner much attention. However, lack of attention would not be a problem for Paul Walker for long. With Pleasantville - Zu schön, um wahr zu sein (1998), he appeared in his first hit. As the town stud (a la 1950s) who more than meets his match in modern day Reese Witherspoon, he was one of the most memorable characters of the film. That same year, Paul and his then-girlfriend Rebecca had a baby girl named Meadow Walker (Meadow Rain Walker). Even though Paul publicly admitted that Meadow was not planned, he said that she is his number one priority. Paul and Rebecca separated and Meadow lives with her mother in Hawaii. She often visited with Paul as his homes in Santa Barbara and Huntington Beach, California.\n\nRoles in the teen hits Varsity Blues (1999), Eine wie keine (1999) and The Skulls - Alle Macht der Welt (2000) cemented Walker's continued rise to celebrity. He was chosen to be one of the young stars featured on the cover of Vanity Fair's annual Hollywood issue in April 2000. While the other stars on the cover, brooded and tried their best to look sexy and serious, Paul smiled brightly and showed why he is not part of the norm. This is one young actor who certainly stood apart from the rest of the crowd, not only with his talent but with his attitude. The Dallas Morning News commented in March of 2000 that, \"Paul is one of the rarest birds in Hollywood- a pretension free movie star.\" The latest blockbuster hit, The Fast and the Furious (2001), had raised his stardom to an even higher level.\n\nHis fighting scenes in movies lead to a passion for martial arts. He has studied various forms of Jujitsu, Taekwondo, Jeet Kune Do and Eskrima. Paul mentioned in a magazine interview that he had hoped enroll in the Keysi Fighting Method when it comes to the United States. Other than practicing martial arts, Paul enjoyed relaxing at home with his daughter, Meadow Rain, surfing near his Huntington Beach abode, walking his dogs and just driving.\n\nWhen Paul seriously did get a break from the entertainment business, he said he loved traveling. Paul had traveled to India, Fiji, Costa Rica, Sarawak, Brunei, Borneo and other parts of the Asian continent. Tragically, Paul Walker died in a car crash on Saturday November 30, 2013, after attending a charity event for \"Reach Out Worldwide\".\n\nSeveral of Paul's films were released after his death, include Hours - Wettlauf gegen die Zeit (2013), Brick Mansions (2014), and his final starring role in The Fast and the Furious series, Fast & Furious 7 (2015), part of which was completed after his death. The film's closing scenes paid tribute to Walker, whose character met with a happy ending, and rode off into the sunset. He appeared archival footage in Fast X (2023)."
