When we say “collective,” we mean people who experience films, interpret them, and identify with them from a certain “subject position,” which is always the intersection of individual experience and communal frameworks. Our national, ethnic, racial and religious, gender, and other communal affiliations, not necessarily in this order, guide our experience of the fictional world—the story, characters, setting, and our perception of the more subtle elements of the cinematic code, like composition and color, mise-en-scène, art, distance and angles, editing, soundtrack, and musical score. When we say “identities,” we refer to transient and always evolving cultural constructs, not fixed entities. Cultural identities are flexible and open identifications and self-perceptions that we keep developing as we go through life. They are reflected in and through our biographies and depend on cultural contexts (be they national, geographical, or ethnic) that are connected to our professional and personal, private affiliations. Motion fiction is one of the most fascinating and relevant media for the study of such “moving” or evolving collective identities. Films are a spectacular vehicle for the dramatization of collective myths and for a ritual consumption of these myths through spectatorship. Through the reworking and retelling of familiar stories in variations, films articulate and form the collective unconscious that yearns to connect to an origin of fixed meaning that will anchor identity in the fertile common ground of the collective: stories that nations repeatedly tell themselves, ritualized mythologies which ix\n\nx\n\nIntroduction\n\nsignify the dreams and the anxieties of these collectives, their utopian aspirations, and their dystopian nightmares. Movies stir us because they tell us something about ourselves and our fellow humans; they can mobilize us to identify with common ideals, devote and even sacrifice our lives for them. They open a window to cultures we are curious about and hold a mirror to the cultures that create them, reflecting that culture, its highlights, and its discontents. In our globalized, postmodern, condensed world, where populations are in constant motion and travel, identities become ever more fluid, contested terrains for negotiation and change. It is in this mobile world that films travel across borders and cultural boundaries and become intercultural arenas for the formation of meaning. Israeli Cinema: Identities in Motion is a collection of essays that examine Israeli cinema as a prism that refracts collective Israeli identities through the medium and art of motion pictures. Israeli cinema, we believe, is a particularly fascinating test case, because it has been created within a national cultural context that has reflexively produced itself since its very beginning at the end of the nineteenth century and is still very much engaged in the formation of the evolving national/collective identity in the second millennium. Israeli culture is a product of a utopian enterprise: Zionism, which started in the late 1880s, was conceived in the contexts of nationalism in Europe and realized in the land of Israel-Palestine as a pioneering endeavor, regarded by some contemporary historians and sociologists as a colonial enterprise. However it is conceptualized, this is clearly an intriguing case of a national community consciously imagining itself, writing its national revival as a new chapter in its ancient collective memory, and reviving its sacred texts and language as a new national secular culture. It is a fascinating case for studying the creation of a unified, cohesive national culture in a territory which existed virtually as a text, in a language used mostly in print and in oral sacred ritual, and on the basis of voluntary and forced immigration from diverse cultural and geographical backgrounds. The evolution of Israeli culture can be placed on the long continuum of Jewish cultural and textual tradition. At the same time, it is also a disruptive revolutionary enterprise in that it forced diverse cultural traditions and collective biographies of the Jewish Diasporas into a “New Hebrew” collective-national mold, later termed “Israeli.” In addition to these diverse ethnic-cultural challenges to the newly re-created community, the evolving national culture took root in the mythological ancient holy land of origin, in which other communal identities were and had been living and forming\n\nIntroduction\n\nxi\n\ntheir own histories, collective memories, lived experiences, oral and print cultures. The encounter with the local Palestinian, Druze, and other communities in the Land of Israel yields a complex cultural clash over collective meanings and dominance. Articles in this anthology by Ben-Zvi-Morad, Gertz and Hermoni, Meiri, and Naaman offer a historical perspective and diverse theoretical positions on the intercultural and interethnic encounters, clashes, and conflicts between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs and on their representations and historiographies in Israeli cinema. Hebrew cinema took an active part in the mobilization and construction of the new national culture. The creation and dissemination of Zionism, the new ideology which in the late 1880s advocated the idea of the return of the Jewish people to their ancient homeland in the Land of Israel, coincided with the evolution and consolidation of cinema as a medium and art, both in Europe and in North America. The pioneering national Zionist enterprise mobilized the moving pictures to stir Jews in the Diaspora to join the efforts of construction and national revival in Palestine. Moreover, both silent and talking films made in Palestine itself as well as those co-produced abroad were a medium for the construction and articulation of the evolving national identity. Films such as This Is the Land (Zot Hee Haʾaretz, Agadati, 1934) documented scenes from the Land of Israel as well as staged scenes of pioneers settling the land, planting trees and expanding agriculture, building diverse communities, and creating new forms of social-communal living, including the urban Tel Aviv and the cooperative kibbutz. The rebirth of the nation was depicted as a productive effort of building and taming the wasteland into a fertile abundance of life and creativity. This reproductive national project was imagined on the silver screen as a masculine teleological endeavor, a forceful movement through the territory to conquer it by a spectacular bodily effort: Western-like generic narratives of a mythic clash between frontier and homesteaders, wasteland and civilization. The persistent taming of the barren, desolate land was almost always by men and their phallic extensions: the body, the hoe, the rifle, the horse. The Palestinian inhabitants of the contested territory were ambivalently depicted as noble savages who thwart the attempt to bring civilization and harmonic order into the chaotic wild East; as model representatives of the ancient biblical forefathers, the shepherds and farmers of the ancient holy land; or as potent “Orientals,” who represented the alternative to a feminized, passive, impotent, victimized Diaspora Jew. This newly created cultural identity used the new medium of film to convey the creative momentum of the new nation. The aesthetics of Soviet cinema—with its dynamic montage editing style, magnifying oblique shoot-\n\nxii\n\nIntroduction\n\ning angles, and ideologically committed pathos—was mobilized to create sequences of lively movement and visual and sonic excess, signifying the new life pulsating in the ancient, prehistoric land. At the same time, early Israeli films also borrowed narratives and iconographies from the American Western, with its resolute pioneers who tame the wasteland as well as the stylized encounters with the local natives as a setting for this spectacular national effort to seize and conquer the old-new frontier land. The hybridization of Soviet and American genres and styles with additional futurist aesthetics—which glorified man and machine, mass production, labor, and industrialization—articulated the new nation as dynamic and Westernized. This pre-state Zionist cinema both expressed and determined the fundamentals of the inchoate Israeli culture, with its masculinist orientations, the centrality of territory and conflict, the emphasis on the collective rather than individual experience, and the primacy of the national over the familial and public over private sphere. Essays by Feldestein, Horak, and Peleg in this anthology offer diverse critical perspectives, interpretations, and re-visions of pioneering cinematic formulations of the Zionist enterprise. The aftermath of the Holocaust and the 1948 war known to Israelis as the War of Independence brought waves of immigrants into the newly declared state of Israel: refugees from the death camps of Europe and Jewish refugees as well as voluntary immigrants from the Middle East. The encounter between Holocaust survivors and the veteran Yishuv is a formative chapter in Israeli history. The Holocaust, which had crucial consequences for the foundation of a state for the Jews in the Land of Israel, continues to fulfill a major role in the Israeli conscious and less conscious collective memory and psyche. Essays by Avisar, Steir-Livny, and Yosef in this anthology reexamine cinematic Israeli negotiations of the Holocaust and its ramifications in Israeli history, society, and identity politics in films from the 1940s to the 2000s. During the 1940s and 1950s films in Hebrew and English were still consciously used to consolidate and create an Israeli community out of the diverse traditions and cultural heritages that the new immigrants brought to the country. In the 1960s and 1970s this intensive and deliberate effort, which cinema continued to deploy in a highly stylized manner, gave way to a “normalized” local cinematic idiom, created as part of the collective, lived everyday experience of a culture that began to be less self-consciously fabricated. Whereas in the United States and parts of Europe television became a popular medium for creating and projecting collective experiences in the 1950s, television in Israel was not genuinely legitimized as a productive commercial industry and medium for the collective dreams and anxieties\n\nIntroduction\n\nxiii\n\nbefore the early 1990s. That role was reserved for the film industry, which remained a significant medium for formulating collective identities that were often contested. In the 1960s films affiliated with the “National Heroic” genre encapsulated the nationalist ethos of survival and cohesiveness, mostly in hybrid narratives and fictional worlds depicted in war films, melodramas, and comedies. These films featured pioneering collectives, warriors, and other socially significant peer groups. As such, they continued to uphold the national collectivist, group-oriented culture and represented the conservative gatekeeping of the boundaries of national identity. For the most part, these films presented a masculine world that relegated women to stereotypical representations, ignored the experiences of immigrants and diverse ethnic traditions, and privileged action and exteriority over the mundane and domestic sphere. Eventually, however, the conservative nationalist genre lost its hold, as audiences increasingly preferred films that better articulated their real experiences and concerns. Israeli films from the 1960s and 1970s—melodramatic war films such as He Walked through the Fields (Yosef Millo, 1967), “group” movies and Bourekas films and comedies like What a Gang! (Zeʾev Khavatzelet, 1962), Halfon Hill Doesn’t Answer (Assi Dayan, 1976), and The Troupe (Avi Nesher, 1978)—projected a cohesive collective, which coalesces out of a diverse and contested multiethnic and multicultural steaming melting pot. The most popular films during the sixties and seventies highlighted the preoccupation of the local film industry, which, like Hollywood studio films, held a mirror to the nation, narrativized the formulaic stories, and projected the images that it wanted to see. The most popular genre of those years was the so-called Bourekas film: generic comedies and melodramas which adapted popular cinematic traditions from the Middle East and Eastern European Jewish folk traditions and re-created interclass and interethnic clashes that usually unfold in the familial sphere. Typically, the clashes of the Bourekas drama are resolved through intermarriage and integration or containment within the family unit. Such “happy endings” confirmed and endorsed the integrative-utopian thrust of the Israeli melting pot ideology by repeatedly dramatizing the merging of diverse identities in the communal mold. But with changing social and cultural realities this mythic and utopian model eventually became irrelevant. Essays in this anthology by Ben Shaul, Gershenson, Shemer, and Talmon offer a dynamic overview of the evolving cinematic idioms of ethnicity, immigration, and interethnic exchanges in Israeli films and their changing formations.\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Israeli military is another unique institution of social integration and co-option. War and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East continue to haunt Israeli consciousness, collective memory, and lived experience. Militarism and war have taken a painful and traumatic toll on Israelis, which Israeli cinema has dealt with directly over the years. Several essays in this anthology discuss the implications of war and its articulations in Israeli cinema through history: Cohen, Kaplan, Zerubavel, Zanger, Munk, and Neʾeman discuss ideological and mythic aspects of collective Jewish and Israeli memory in the cinematic depictions of war in Israel. While popular films in the 1960s and 1970s continued to focus on commonplace themes of community, interethnic exchange, army camaraderie, and the emerging petit bourgeoisie, a counter-elitist genre developed that spoke against the egalitarian and integrative ethos articulated by the more commercial and conservative films. Expressing modernist sensibilities, these new films adopted the avant-garde artistic aesthetics of the French New Wave, Italian neo-realism, and American new Hollywood cinema. Highly stylized, these films proposed progressive as well as reactionary models of Israeli existence, an urban, alienated existentialism, and anti-ideological angst. Such films reversed the masculine worldview and integrative fervor of the collective ethos and offered alternative models of masculinity as well as alienated particularistic, individualistic, and privatized modes of existence. The reality of a nation at war, burdened by internal tensions among ethnic, national, and religious minorities, was suppressed in these aesthetically sophisticated films, reserved for the cinematic elite and detached from their Israeli audiences. These “personal” Israeli films, referred to as the “New Sensibility” cinema, strove to reverse the normative collectivist and masculine militarism of the past. Such films articulated a second transition, if not a real revolution, in Israeli cultural consciousness, setting in motion a new phase in the negotiation of collective identities. At the end of the 1970s Israeli society and culture underwent crucial transitions. The long-lasting hegemony of the socialist labor party (Maʾarakh, Mifleget Haʾavodah) was challenged for the first time in Israeli history in the 1977 elections, which brought to power the nationalist-liberal party (Likud) headed by Menahem Begin. Later that year, the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat came to Jerusalem, initiating what was to become Israel’s first peace treaty with an Arab state. Israeli cinema both reflected and took part in these transformations of Israeli culture toward a new social and political agenda. The vigorous revision of mainstream ideologies in 1980s films took place in the symbolic spaces that formerly defined the cohesive national ethos, such as the army and the kibbutz. These cultural sites, which al-\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nlegorically dramatized and textualized the Sabra myth, were now used to deconstruct this very imagined epitome of collective identity. Israeli films from the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s renegotiate the altruistic tenets of the individual sacrifice of life and self-realization on the national altar in a variety of familiar contexts: the pioneer commune (Once We Were Dreamers, Barbash, 1987), the army (Paratroopers, Neʾeman, 1977; One of Ours, Barbash, 1989; The Troupe, Nesher, 1978; Avanti Popolo, Bukai, 1986), the kibbutz (Noa at 17, Yeshurun, 1982; Atalia, Tevet, 1984), and the peer group (Late Summer Blues, Schorr, 1987; The Wooden Gun, Moshenson, 1979; The Summer of Aviya, Cohen, 1988). These films retell the story of the committed and unified national collective as a countermyth of disintegration and oppression; they shatter the symbolic father and resurrect the repressed feminized diasporic Jew, Holocaust survivor, and excluded Palestinian Arab. The 1990s saw the acceleration of these trends, especially as Israel increasingly opened up to outside influences. Millennial, postmodern sensibilities exercised a particularly strong hold on Israeli culture by emphasizing hybridity and ambiguity; the destabilization of grand narratives; and the fluidity of boundaries between national and global, masculine and feminine, real and virtual, and documentary and fiction. All of these global trends find their articulation in Israeli cinema. Alienated from its audiences by its subversive, deconstructivist political stance throughout the 1980s, Israeli cinema in the 1990s seems threatened by the rapid growth of viable commercial, cable, and satellite television, which have become the most productive sites in popular Israeli culture for the formation of identities. This threat to cinematic dominance and expression was also an advantage, however, as commercial television uses Israeli cinema as a resource to anchor its discourse in a shared visual and narrative cultural memory as well as repertory. Israeli films are constantly recycled on TV, especially in ritual collective times such as national holidays (for example, Independence Day) and in special programming devoted to the screenings of past and contemporary Israeli cinema. Moreover, the commercial television industry frequently employs filmmakers, producers, cinematographers, and other film professionals for its own original productions, and an exchange of generic traditions as well as authorship feeds both arenas of cultural production. Among the transformations created by the free market forces of the 1990s in Israel was an important change to the policies of the Israeli Fund for Quality Films, a public financing committee that dominated film production throughout the 1980s. As one of the only financial resources for Israeli filmmakers, the Israeli Fund traditionally supported more artistic and progressive, radically political films. In the 1990s, however, it began to adjust\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nits support to fit the new and more popular cultural sensibilities. Together with the country’s more commercial media, it became a resource for the formation of a new cinematic idiom, which under the slogan “films from here,” strives for an authentic expression of real and sensually authentic Israeli life in its Mediterranean, Middle Eastern context. The intense yearning for a change in the national agenda toward the end of the millennium was accompanied by a quest for authentic expression in the culture at large and in cinema in particular. A spate of secondgeneration films strove to express these changes through engagement with multiculturalism, collective and multiple biographies and histories, and an almost obsessive return to past traumas. Such films articulate revisionist approaches to representations of the Holocaust, Mizrahim, immigration, national history, and the kibbutz, along with new conceptualization of gender, sexuality, place, and cultural space. New social and cultural groups which were underrepresented within the homogenizing old cinematic discourses, or stereotypically represented in the service of collectivist-nationalist ideologies, are now more visible as well as self-represented. These new discourses of the minor and new sensibilities, which through cinematic expression offer “lines of flight” from obsolete cinematic and ideological paradigms, articulate processes within Israeli cinema and culture as well as larger formations in the postmodern world and global market. Articles by Dushi, Chyutin, Padva, and Kedem discuss such new discourses of old and newly visualized (sub)cultures as well as minorities in Israeli cinema of the current millennium. The central role of gender formations in the cinematic negotiations of collective Israeli identity and the national history cannot be underestimated. National identities and their deconstruction formed mainly by adopting new masculine models and later shattering and dismantling them. The reaction against the victimized and marginalized Jewish positioning in the Diaspora brought hypermasculine overtones to the generic narrative and aesthetic features of early Hebrew and Israeli films. The opening of Israeli culture to alternative, new, and diverse directions is articulated through new approaches to gender and sexuality, which challenge by now obsolete cinematic and cultural models. Several essays in this anthology, although not included under this title, deal with gender and sexuality, as symptoms of ideological and cultural transitions in the culture. The 1993 Oslo Accords were a political manifestation of a fundamental change in Israeli culture, signified in contemporary Israeli cinema by film noir–like dystopias reflecting Israelis’ broken sense of place and control. The masculine paradigm, which had sustained the Zionist-national discourse,\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\nwas replaced by a shift to the feminine aspects of mundane experiences within the private sphere and the legitimization of a personal pursuit of happiness and self-realization. This shift in cultural priorities, which sustained the great support for the peace process and the hopes for “normalization,” was shattered in the early 2000s by the second Palestinian uprising and wave of terror known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada. The violent Palestinian revolt was preceded by the collapse of the peace process and reemphasized the severity of the internal fissures within Israeli society: the growing centrifugal pressures of subcultures, which no longer conform to a dominant Hebrew unifying cultural core, and the ever-growing quest for new leadership and “normalcy” that will finally end the pressures of war, terror, occupation, victimization, and other moral issues that keep haunting Israeli society and culture. This anthology brings the discussion of Israeli cinema as a site of struggle over cultural meanings into this very transitional phase in Israeli culture in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Indeed, Israeli cinema has found a respectable place on the global cinematic scene, where the discourse about identity is integral to cinematic discourse. Yet, in addressing Israeli audiences, Israeli cinema remains a major site of negotiation and revisioning of history. This is an ongoing project of Israeli cinema, as demonstrated by the essays in this anthology, which chart a culture in constant motion that defies its deep longing for a stable and untroubled existence. The very conceptualization of Israeli identity and cinema, which we share as editors of this anthology, makes it difficult for us to conclude with tightly knit ends. We hope that readers will start a discussion rather than summarize and canonize one, because the stories we examine here are part of a history still in the making and a historiography much debated. We hope that those interested in the Israeli story will find these pages instructive and thought provoking. Miri Talmon and Yaron Peleg\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\n1\n\nFilming the Homeland Cinema in Eretz Israel and the Zionist Movement, 1917–1939\n\na ri e l l . fe l d e st e i n The cinematic depiction of the historical return of the Jewish people to their homeland from 1917 through 1939 is the subject of this essay. After four centuries of consecutive Ottoman rule, which left a profound mark on the country, in 1917 the British conquered Eretz Israel, demarcating its political and administrative borders and shaping its regime and legal structure. These transformations contributed to the Zionist movement’s endeavor to establish the Jewish National Home and to bring about the birth of the “New Jew” in Eretz Israel. Various creative disciplines began evolving in the country, including film, which was launched not only as a means of documenting and presenting the historical narrative but also as a method of constructing it. The development of cinema paralleled the fruition of other ventures initiated by members of the first generation of national revival, who experienced a tremendous metamorphosis as a result of their immigration to the country, and was later advanced by the second generation that was born into the new reality. Most of the studies discussing the crystallization of cinema in Eretz Israel have defined the films produced during the first three decades of the twentieth century as “nonart,” the result of filmmakers’ adaptability and compliance with the national needs. Researchers maintained that the films lacked any artistic value, so there was no point in exploring them through that perspective. Some scholars have even gone so far as to point out similarities between the cinematic creation in Eretz Israel and films produced during the same period in totalitarian states such as the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Yet such an approach belittles the artistic aspect of the Eretz 3\n\n4\n\nThe Nation Imagined on Film\n\nIsrael films. The present study questions this monolithic presentation and describes the diversity and differences that can be found among the various filmmakers and films. This essay deals with two complementary issues. First, it is concerned with the way in which the Zionist idea was presented and realized through film. More specifically, it examines the translation or adaptation of the Jewish return to the homeland and the redemption and birth of the “New Jew” through visual expressions. At the core of this discussion is the premise that film is a bona fide historical document, a quintessential product of its time, whose power far exceeds that of written words. The films analyzed here provide a prism through which I explore the ideological components, the social characteristics, and the way real-life actions were interpreted at the time. The second issue I examine is the interaction between filmmakers and national institutions during a highly ideological era. The works analyzed here were all made by filmmakers who immigrated to Palestine to become an integral part of the Jewish Yishuv (Jewish community in Palestine). They include Yaacov Ben Dov, Natan Axelrod, Khaim Halakhmi, Barukh Agadati, and Helmar Lerski.\n\nYaacov Ben Dov Yaacov Ben Dov immigrated to Eretz Israel at the beginning of December 1907, during the Hanukah holiday. Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael began acquiring lands in an organized manner at that time,1 and infrastructures were built in preparation for the establishment of Jewish settlements. In order to implement the agency’s policy efficiently, a Palestine Office was established in Jaffa, headed by Dr. Arthur Rupin. Ben Dov saw these developments as a chance to enhance his activity as a photographer and suggested that Rupin assist in securing him a position as the official photographer of the 1909 eighth Zionist Congress, convening in Hamburg. As far as we know, his request was denied. The Zionist institutions of the time were less than enthusiastic about cooperating with Ben Dov. But he was not discouraged. At every opportunity, he approached Zionist bureaucrats, imploring them to hire him as a photographer. Finally Rupin consented and commissioned him to take several photographs of Hebrew settlements around the country. Ben Dov’s aspiration, however, was to direct films. But he faced an obstacle: he could not finance the purchase of a suitable camera. As a subject of the Ottoman Empire, Ben Dov was recruited into the Ottoman army during World War I and was positioned as a medical photographer in an Austrian unit.\n\nFilming the Homeland\n\n5\n\nAs a token of their appreciation for his devoted service, his superior officers gave Ben Dov a motion-picture camera. The progress of the British army toward Jaffa and Jerusalem at the end of the war, headed by General Edmund Allenby, excited the Yishuv population, who longed to be released from the Ottoman rule. Ben Dov perceived the transformations that occurred in Eretz Israel as a rare opportunity to immortalize history in the making on celluloid and filmed the entrance of Allenby and his troops into Jerusalem in the winter of 1917. That scene would constitute the opening of his first film, Yehuda Haʾmeshukhreret (The Liberated Judea). Through his camera lens Ben Dov witnessed the historical events and transformation transpiring in Eretz Israel. In shaping the historical memory of a nation which was beginning to crystallize its national identity and form as a geopolitical entity, he intended the filmed documentation not only for the people of his time but for future generations as well. This occurred while Eretz Israel was still in a state of war and suffered from a shortage of raw materials and means for filming a motion picture. But Ben Dov was not discouraged. Ignoring the dangers and the hardships, he traveled around the country to document with his camera the historical events and the evolution of the Zionist enterprise, prompted by the British occupation. Ben Dov perceived himself first and foremost as an artist-historian chronicling the drama on film. He considered every frame a testimony to the feats of the Zionist project in Eretz Israel. Most of the scenes were shot from afar, recording and immortalizing the events without intervening or influencing them. Some sequences are more reminiscent of still photos than of film. In addition, the cinematography lacks any aesthetic pretension, because Ben Dov wished to document the event as it “really” was and present it as a historical testimony. Perhaps he also hoped to evoke the viewers’ trust in this way (as well as to express his own enthusiasm concerning the events) and to prevent any possible complaint concerning misleading camera effects. Ben Dov failed to interest Keren Kayemeth in purchasing the film and distributing it among the Jewish communities in the Diaspora. It was eventually lost, and only several sequences and its program have remained. While preparing to produce another film, Ben Dov decided to realize his old dream: in April 1919 he founded the Menorah film company. The cofounder and associate manager was Mordekhai Schwartz. The Zionist Commission to Palestine (Vaʾad Hatzirim) gave its blessing to the establishment of the company, recognizing it as a contribution to the effort of documenting “images of historical events, which have great national value.”2 Yet the com-\n\n6\n\nThe Nation Imagined on Film\n\nmission was not quick to assist with the funding of this company, which fell apart in the early 1920s. During the twenties and early thirties Ben Dov was often frustrated with his cinematic efforts. National institutions did not offer him the support and assistance he expected to receive. Over the years he repeatedly tried to reach the awareness of institutions and the general public, usually at his own expense. Ben Dov even failed in convincing the Keren Kayemeth and Keren Hayesod national funds to acquire the distributing rights for his films. As a last resort he decided to approach Khaim Weizmann, the president of the Zionist Movement, directly and offer his cinematic work to be preserved at the national library on Mount Scopus, for 2,000 Israeli liras. When his offer was declined, he decided to sell the collection to Barukh Agadati for 100 Israeli liras. His dream of presenting future generations with a visual historical documentation of the Jewish people’s return to their national home in Eretz Israel was not realized. A substantial part of his work was lost or ruined over the years, and fragments from his films were integrated into other works without crediting their source. In his cinematic work, Ben Dov focused on recording historical events related to Eretz Israel in general and the establishment of the national home in particular. Acting as a documentary filmmaker, he did not get involved with what was happening in front of the camera, preferring wide angles and long shots. The editing was simple: a depiction of the sequence of occurrences. He wrote the script himself and did not ask permission for the production from institutions. Many of the films were produced at his own expense and only later sold for distribution. Ben Dov viewed himself as part of the Jewish national society forming in Eretz Israel; he defined himself as a Zionist and aspired to express this ideological perception in his work. Unlike filmmakers in other countries, such as the Soviet Union, Ben Dov assisted in national propaganda out of his own free will. No public or private resources could be found to invest in the film industry (as was the case in the movie industry in the United States), so he had to make do with incredibly inferior filming, developing, and editing equipment, which significantly lagged behind the accepted standards in Europe and the United States. Within the framework of these limitations he made an effort to produce high-quality films, in the hope that their content would uplift the spirit of the viewers and compensate for the technical flaws. From a historical perspective, Ben Dov holds a place of honor as the herald of motion pictures in the Land of Israel and as the one who established its foundations. He paved the way for filmmakers who came after him, who\n\nFilming the Homeland\n\n7\n\nrelied on the experience that he had accumulated while laying the foundations of this creative project.3\n\nNatan Axelrod and Khaim Halakhmi During the late 1920s and early 1930s new attempts were made to produce films in Eretz Israel. The most prominent expression of these efforts was the establishment of a production company initiated by two people, Natan Axelrod and Khaim Halakhmi.\n\nOded Hanoded (Oded the Wanderer) The first full-length Eretz Israel feature film, Oded Hanoded, was based on a Tzvi Liberman story. The book’s protagonist is a boy who gets lost during a class field trip. Alone, Oded faces winds and storms but prevails and finds his way back home. During his long journey, Oded reaches a Bedouin tribe and befriends a boy his age who wishes to learn from him. The Bedouins assist Oded in his attempt to return home, and his friend finally joins him and integrates into Oded’s school and the Jewish children’s society. Oded “civilizes” the Bedouin boy, teaching him the secrets of the Western world. Thus the film expresses the approach which asserted not only the Zionist movement’s transformation of the “Old Jew” but also its contribution to the redemption of the other peoples of the land. Oded represents progress and the benefits of Western culture compared to the Bedouin boy’s way of life. The most striking difference between the script of Oded Hanoded and the story it is based on is that the film does not mention the encounter between Oded and the Bedouin tribe. At the heart of the script are Oded and his classmates, who embark on a hiking trip with an American Jewish tourist near a village. They trek across rocky, rugged ground that is quite different from the luscious landscape of their native blooming valley. On the morning of the second day of the trip, Oded is lost. The teacher and the other students search for him with the village guard and some of the parents, including Oded’s father, who join them on horseback. Oded wanders around, unsuccessfully attempting to find his way back. He is injured and his water canteen runs dry, but he does not lose hope and continues his effort to find his way back to the village. Eventually everyone returns safely home, and Oded is restored to his parents. The script, then, focuses on the individual’s endeavor to overcome the natural elements, on the personal effort required for survival and the group’s responsibility toward the individual. The spotlight has shifted from the initiation rite to concern for Oded. The script translates Oded’s effort to cope with the situation, the inter-\n\n8\n\nThe Nation Imagined on Film\n\naction between him and the group, and the Jewish settlement enterprise into images. The film opens with a long panoramic shot of the Jezreel Valley landscapes followed by a series of shots of large buildings, zooming in on village houses embedded in cultivated lands. These images glorify the Jewish settlement movement, before the viewer is even introduced to the movie’s characters. The Zionist project is in fact the film’s major theme, setting the foundation for the plot. The movie’s numerous visual statements integrate into a single plot based on the romantic image of the settlers’ life in the Jezreel Valley in general and the lives of their children in particular. We are presented with a community that supports its members and vouches for them, offering values, serene country living, quality of life, and economic prosperity. The film takes a different turn due to the filmmakers’ decision to exclude the Bedouin boy’s initiation by Oded from the script and present the realization of the Zionist idea as a solution not just for Jews but for the rest of the country’s population as well. Although Ella Shohat mentions this factor, she also discusses the film’s depiction of the tension embedded in the interaction between the pioneers and the land’s “natives.” But Shohat bases her claims on texts and other films of the era and of later periods rather than on Oded Hanoded itself. A movie should be analyzed in reference to the period and culture it was created in, so it seems inappropriate to find fault with it due to reservations about the Zionist endeavor or its approach to the “indigenous people of the land.” “The wilderness toward which he feels alienation,” writes Shohat, “includes the local residents, to whom the camera does not grant any autonomy or individuality beyond being part of the landscape. The teacher’s history lesson, for example, ignores the Arab presence and strips it of any history and geography, as a kind of homological continuation to the Zionist discourse.”4 Yet how can one praise a work of art that consciously ignores that particular disharmony and at the same time object to its disregard for that same factor? The creators of the film chose not to explore this issue. They described the importance of the settlement enterprise and its contribution to the development of the New Jew and to the construction of the identity, body, and soul of the New Jewish/Hebrew child. That was their concern, and hence their work had no room for a visual expression of “individual autonomy” or “the indigenous people of the land.”5 The movie was screened for two months at the Eden movie theater in Tel Aviv, where the audience greeted it enthusiastically. Following the film’s success at cinemas across the country, the producers hoped to distribute it\n\nFilming the Homeland\n\n9\n\nacross the Jewish world and searched for supportive philanthropist Jews for this purpose. The producers also approached Keren Kayemeth, which objected to the absence of images presenting pioneers or the rejuvenation of Eretz Israel. As a result, the filmmakers incorporated the settlement theme and the project of redeeming the Jezreel Valley in the second version of the script, hoping thus to receive assistance with the distribution of the film across the Jewish world. The lack of resources also put a strain on the relationship between Axelrod and Halakhmi. The two argued about the film’s production rights and about each author’s part in it. Axelrod attempted to deny Halakhmi his title as the film’s director, probably unjustly. The shortage of money and the personal animosity caused the bankruptcy of their production company. Khaim Halakhmi was compelled to shelve his dream to create films and gave up working in this field. But Natan Axelrod endured.\n\nBarukh Agadati In 1931, when Axelrod was in the middle of producing the Homeland Newsreel with Yerushalayim Segal, Barukh Agadati decided to quit his dancing career and focus on cinema. Together with his brother Yitzkhak, who was in charge of the technical and organizational aspects, he established a small laboratory in the shed where they were living and started producing Aga Newsreel to compete with Homeland Newsreel. Like other filmmakers in this field, the Agadati brothers requested assistance from the national institutions, but eventually they raised the necessary funds from private investors. One of them was Meir Dizengoff, a businessman and the mayor of Tel Aviv.\n\nZot Hee Haʾaretz (This Is the Land) In the race to produce a feature film, Axelrod and Halakhmi preceded Agadati. Yet their motion pictures were silent, and therefore their triumph could only be considered relative. Aiming to achieve a complete victory, at the end of 1934 Agadati managed to buy the Ofek film company’s equipment. A further step—the purchase of Yaacov Ben Dov’s film archive for one hundred Israeli liras—brought him even closer to the fulfillment of his dream. Now he asked the author Avigdor Hameiri to write a script which incorporated the cinematic materials that had been accumulated. Meiri’s script included sections from the Ben Dov films and newsreels which documented major historical events from the early days of Zionism and the British mandate in Eretz Israel and added sequences from the Aga Newsreel as well as new documentary and fictional footage.\n\n10\n\nThe Nation Imagined on Film\n\nThe plot of Zot Hee Haʾaretz begins in 1881–1882, with the first wave of Jewish immigration. It depicts the pioneers’ effort to build the country and ends with a display of the entire pioneering enterprise. In keeping with the Zionist ethos, the film presents Jews of the Diaspora as soulless and Eretz Israel as a wasteland: the consequence of the people’s neglect of the land. After the Jewish people have returned to their land, the movie suggests, redemption begins. The symbiosis between the people and the land fills an important role in the construction of the Jewish nationality, and the religious yearning for the return to Zion is translated into a national longing. The immigration itself is described as a rebirth. The new life is based on the ideological “negation of the Diaspora” (“Shlilat Hagalut”) and on the cultivation of the land. One of the images representing this idea is a scene illustrating a pioneer’s supreme sacrificial act: the pioneer is seen “redeeming the land” by plowing it, when he suddenly drops dead. A guard on horseback gallops toward the deceased pioneer, identifies him, and hurries to find a replacement. The body merges in a dissolve with the lumps of the plowed land while the dying man shouts, as if conveying a legacy: “Onward! Onward!” (in Hebrew: “Kadima”). The scene ends when the man’s corpse and the land fuse into one, while the substitute pioneer continues to plow the land. The plot also highlights one of the prominent features characterizing the metamorphosis of the diasporic Old Jew into a New Jew: the shift in the approach to the culture of the body. Zionist ideology has presented the rehabilitation of the Jewish body as one of its key goals and a countermeasure against the overly spiritual diasporic Jew. The mythic figure of the Israeliborn Sabra is muscular and powerful, as befits someone who is required to fill a historical role in the redemption of the land. The process of shedding the limp diasporic body is described in a sequence of images showing children and youths exercising in a variety of athletic activities. Most of the scenes depicting Tel Aviv and its residents are teeming with activity and labor. Construction, athletics, and group activities are particularly emphasized. The discrepancy between the life of urban “comfort” and the hardships of the agricultural way of life in the settlements is minimized. The movie culminates in a mass scene of an entire crowd singing “Am Israel Khai” (literally meaning “The People of Israel Live”) while the volume increases along with the accelerated rhythm of the changing scenes. Groups of young men run in the open field toward a group of young women merging into a “Hora” dance circle. The pace of the dance and the spinning human circle gradually increase along with the swelling music, reaching great harmony. The statement is clear: “Am Israel Khai.”\n\nFilming the Homeland\n\n11\n\nZot Hee Haʾaretz was unfavorably received not just by contemporaneous film critics but by later film scholars as well. Thus, for example, Yehuda Harel disagrees with the claim that the production of the film, despite the meager means available at the time, was an achievement in its own right for the Agadati brothers.6 He alludes to the revised version of the film and the adjustments inserted in a laboratory abroad, considerably improving its quality. Margot Klausner sums up her impressions of the film by asserting that its producers “did not provide the script with a main idea that will connect its disintegrated parts.” 7 Igal Bursztyn refers mainly to the film’s quality and technique, which “includes two kinds of face shots: a horizontal camera movement (panning) across the faces of pioneers standing in a group and individual static closeups of pioneers giving speeches.”8 He also criticizes the filming of the dialogues in the film and the acting therein: “It is not the words which are lying, but the actors’ faces. The actors pretend that they are human while in fact they are nothing but a tool, an ideology’s amplifier.”9 Furthermore, “conflicts are spoken about, but not shown. The film prefers words and stylized visual symbols as ‘artistic’ allegories.”10 Bursztyn mainly criticizes the film’s use of actor positioning, acting, and filming techniques to communicate ideological messages. As a result of their desire to convey these messages, he claims, the filmmakers neglected to use the available arsenal of artistic tools at their disposal. Bursztyn reaches these conclusions without first finding out which professional tools Agadati indeed had at his disposal at the time and whether it was even possible for him to achieve the accepted professional levels in the Hollywood and European film industries of his time.11 Zot Hee Haʾaretz did not receive any financing or support from the national institutions. Therefore there was no outside interference with the contents, ideas, and filming of the movie. Keren Kayemeth and Keren Hayesod (literally, the Foundation Fund) even rejected Agadati’s request to assist with the distribution of the film to Jewish communities abroad. The film, which was produced with the aid of private investment, expressed Barukh Agadati’s personal artistic vision, which reveals enthusiasm about the national endeavor and its grandeur. Barukh Agadati proved that with a relatively modest investment a talking movie could be made even in Eretz Israel and a proper level of filmic creation could still be achieved. In fact, this film should be regarded as part of the attempt to develop modern agriculture and industry with local means in Eretz Israel. The national institutions were mobilized in favor of the first two fields, however, while entrepreneurs in the field of cinema usually had to manage on their own.\n\n12\n\nThe Nation Imagined on Film\n\nHelmar Lerski Helmar Lerski was a well-known portrait photographer in Germany who drew the attention of Paul Boroschek, a wealthy German Jew who decided to invest in a film about the achievements of the Zionist project. For that purpose, he established with Banuar Kelter a production company called Tzalmonoʾa, Inc. and allocated four thousand Eretz Israeli liras for the production of the film. Lerski agreed to Boroschek’s offer to act as the film’s cinematographer and arrived in Palestine at the beginning of the 1930s. In his film, Lerski concentrated on water as a vital resource, perhaps the most important resource for the agricultural settlement in Eretz Israel. Most of the movie was filmed using a small amateur camera containing up to fifteen meters of film. He claimed that the small camera had great advantages: versatility, a dynamic movement free of a tripod, and the ability to shoot quickly from every angle and height. The professional camera of those days required heavy cranes and several operators to achieve the same effect. When Lerski photographed portraits, he used lighting to “sculpt” and design them in an expressive manner. The Palestinian sun gave him great pleasure and freed him of the need for artificial lighting.12\n\nAvodah (Work/Labor) The film begins with a quotation from Isaiah 11:12: “And He will lift up a standard for the nations / and assemble the banished ones of Israel / and will gather the dispersed of Judah / from the four corners of the earth,” reminding viewers that the return to Zion in the modern age is a manifestation of the ancient divine promise. The opening sequence focuses on two feet walking resolutely along a railroad track. Closely focused on the marching feet, the “static” camera movement creates a sense of departure from an old place to a new one. Until he arrives in the Promised Land, the closed frame never reveals the identity of the walker, who functions as a symbol of the immigrants returning to Eretz Israel to transform the land. The “pilgrim’s” personal story and exilic past are unimportant. Only his “rebirth” is significant: the moment when he arrives in the country and integrates into the collective that is laying the foundations for the Zionist endeavor. Most of the film’s plot involves the drilling of a water well in a scorched and barren expanse. The drilling sequence is presented in a series of closeups showing pieces of the drilling machine and fragmented body parts of the pioneers who are operating it, with a harmony of rhythm and function between workers and machine. No faces are displayed. The right side of the frame displays a row of men’s feet. At the center are silhouettes of the\n\nFilming the Homeland\n\n13\n\nlaborers, pulling the drill lever up and pushing it down in a coordinated movement. The rhythmic editing and the shadowy shapes of the drill pieces and the muscular body parts create an impression of a single organic body without clear boundaries. The tempo of the drilling, the close-ups of the drill penetrating the ground, and the exposed limbs converge into an erotic dance. The in-and-out movement of the elongated iron rod clearly creates a kind of simulated intercourse between the men and the soil. Indeed, the sequence culminates orgasmically with the eruption of water, which finally bursts out of the ground. With the help of an improvised bell, a pioneer signals to his distant friends the coming of redemption.13 Women show up for the first time in the film, and children swarm around the pump as the overflowing water fills the frame in a long series of images that compensate for the surrounding dryness. As the celebration continues the community’s children sing and dance in a circle, embracing each other and moving together as one united body. Following the children, their parents join the circles of dancers. Water, the essence of life, gushes into the prepared canals and brings life to the land. Cattle, sheep, and children drink from the faucets: the next generation is already enjoying the fruits of the revolution.14 Even if Lerski’s priorities were more aesthetic than ideological, it is clear today that the presentation of a new Jewish body in his films and others shaped Zionism profoundly. But this was not the way Zionist institutions perceived it at the time. Despite the challenges that the movement faced in Palestine and abroad, it failed to realize and utilize the potential of film to spread its word and propagate its cause.15\n\nConclusions During the three decades addressed in this study and particularly in the first half of the 1930s, filmmaking in Eretz Israel contributed to the shaping of long-lasting Zionist symbols, inadvertently as well as by choice. Those filmmakers, who chose Palestine not only as the location for their films but also as their new home, combined the Jewish national idea and their aspirations to express it artistically. As such, they belonged to a larger group of contemporaneous Zionist artists: poets, writers, painters, photographers, and sculptors who were preoccupied with the transformation of Jewish life in Eretz Israel. Can their diverse creations be defined as propaganda? Were they an instrument in the service of national institutions? The answer is clearly no. Unlike Nazi or Soviet films, films in Eretz Israel during the 1930s were private, not institutional, projects. Consequently, filmmakers were not\n\n14\n\nThe Nation Imagined on Film\n\ncompelled to curb their artistic liberty. Impoverished Zionist institutions not only responded unfavorably to their requests for assistance but also did not understand cinema’s potential to convey ideology. They invested in other forms of propaganda while almost completely ignoring film. Notes\n\n1.

Lerski’s Köpfe des Alltags (roughly translated as “Everyday Heads”) brought together intense close-up portraits of supposedly normal working people, not the dregs or the celebrities of societies but rather those nameless masses who go about their daily chores: the butcher, the baker, the charwoman, the tailor, the stoker. Marked by strong lines, weather-beaten skin, deep shadows under pensive eyes, these faces of the commonplace were true to life and at the same time larger than life. Lerski’s extreme camera perspectives and chiaroscuro lighting made them heroic, turning physiognomies into breathtaking landscapes of human desire and despair. His ambition went beyond the documentation of individual human faces to the depiction of the universal in humanity: his subjects are given occupations but no names. In his photographic magnum opus Metamorphosis through Light, Lerski took this tendency to its logical extreme, photographing the same face 175 different ways, bending and slicing rays of sun over Tel Aviv through mirrors to create radically different personalities.1 It is this same dichotomy between Lerski’s desire to reproduce a given social reality and his need to shape his artistic medium that characterizes much of his work, both as a photographer and as an independent filmmaker in Palestine.\n\n16\n\nHelmar Lerski in Israel\n\n17\n\nEarly Career in Germany Born Israel Schmuklerski in Strassbourg in 1871, Helmar Lerski spent his childhood in Switzerland before going to the United States in 1893, where he was soon apprenticed as an actor on the German-language stage.2 After leaving the stage Lerski began his career as a photographer in Milwaukee, shooting portraits of his former colleagues at the Pabst Theater. In 1915 Lerski decided to return to Germany, where he soon found employment as a cameraman in Berlin’s film industry. Helmar Lerski’s film career can be divided into two periods. The second is the primary focus here. As a cameraman in Germany, Lerski subordinated his artistic persona to the commercial demands of his film directors: he was a technician who in the best of situations could develop elements of a visual style with directors who were sympathetic to his concerns. As an independent documentary filmmaker in Palestine, Lerski ideally had control over his films, but that freedom was often subject to the propagandistic demands of his Zionist financiers. Lerski’s consistent formal strategies were common to his film practice in both countries: the use of extreme close-ups in the style of his portraiture and chiaroscuro long shots, which rejected the prevalent industry practice of lighting a scene evenly. In 1916 Lerski was hired by William Wauer, a well-known painter and film director who hoped that Lerski’s radical ideas would add artistic flair to his films. Responsible for “managing all photographic and technical aspects of the operation,” Lerski indeed shaped the company’s goals, as noted in a press release: As its specialty, the W. W. Film Co., Berlin, presents an original photographic treatment of the human face, with all the richness of its expressive features and forms. The photographic artist . . . achieves this perfection in living portraiture . . . through his artistically and technically new usage and placement of light sources, which allow him to capture the human soul, as reflected in the living reality of the face.3\n\nThe human soul’s reflection in a face—a lofty goal—was thus central to Lerski’s aesthetic even at this early date. Reviews of Wauer’s films (of which no footage survives) continually mention the masterly use of light and shadow, although the films seem to have been somewhat literary in other respects. In 1917 Lerski joined producer Hanns Lippmann’s Deutsche Bioscop Film Co., Berlin, as technical director, producing both publicity stills and films\n\n18\n\nThe Nation Imagined on Film\n\nfor director Robert Reinert’s film team. Between 1917 and 1921 Lerski and Reinert completed twenty-two films, including popular successes such as Opium (1919) and Nerves (1919). Although most of their films were apparently pretentious and overladen with symbolism, Ahasver (Ahasuerus, 1917) seems to have been an exception. Lighting and design in Lerski’s portrait of Carl de Vogt as “the eternally wandering Jew” recalled Lerski’s American portrait “An Arab Head” (1912) as well as serving as a precursor to his first project in Tel Aviv, “Jewish Heads” (1931–1935). In 1921 Lerski followed Lippmann to the Gloria Film Co., working for directors such as E. A. Dupont and Hanns Steinhoff. Trade reviews noted repeatedly that Lerski achieved “beautiful, technically difficult” images but that the films failed “to rise above the well-trodden paths of German costume pictures.”4 Not until 1924 did Lerski receive an assignment worthy of his talents when he collaborated with Paul Leni on Waxworks, one of the most famous expressionist films of the era. Yet Lerski’s cinematography has been unjustifiably ignored in favor of Leni’s sets, although the final “Jack the Ripper” sequence was made possible through Lerski’s lighting, which created filmic space solely with light by shooting the murderer against black backdrops and superimposing numerous images. This manipulation of cinematic space created through light matched Lerski’s practice in making closeup portraits: he often used black velvet and wide-angle lenses to eliminate all superfluous visual information in order to explore the landscape of the face, using jupiter lamps and mirrors. Lerski continued to utilize such techniques in films like The Wig (1924) and The Adventures of a Ten Mark Note (1926), both shot for Bertold Viertel; and The Holy Mountain (1926), directed by Dr. Arnold Fanck. Unfortunately, the technical and financial means necessary for Lerski’s light and mirror experiments were substantial, so that the cost-conscious film industry soon labeled him a “commercially feared employee,” whose “Rembrandt atmosphere” embodied aesthetic pretensions that film producers could ill afford.5 In October 1925 Lerski began working as head technician of the newly founded Deutsche-Spiegeltechnik Co., a subsidiary of Ufa (Universum Film Aktiengesellschaft), which had been founded for commercial exploitation of the “Schüfftan Process.” Invented by Eugen Schüfftan, the special-effects system utilized a complicated set of mirrors—Lerski’s specialty—to superimpose models, actors, sets, stills, and even other films onto one image. Companies wishing to use the process were required to hire the equipment and two technicians from the licensee. Although the process was featured in big-budget productions such as Fritz Lang’s Metropolis (1927) and Joe May’s Dagfin (1926), the Ufa staff was said to have sabotaged the undertaking by\n\nHelmar Lerski in Israel\n\n19\n\nfailing to utilize the process when the opportunity arose. After introducing the process in England in 1927, Lerski left the company.6 In 1929 Lerski completed his last “excursion” into German film before returning “regretfully” to photography. He was hired by novice film director and producer Carl Ludwig Achaz-Duisberg, son of the chairman of the board of the giant chemical combine I. G. Farben.7 Utilizing a Soviet style of editing, Achaz-Duisberg’s vanity production Sprengbagger 1010 (1929) presented a paean to a giant steam shovel, which underscored the film’s belief in economic progress and the redemption of the proletariat through socially enlightened capitalism. While the film was generally undistinguished, the experience certainly influenced Lerski’s work on his masterpiece Avodah.\n\nAvodah (1933–1935) In late 1932, after a brief sojourn in Zurich, Lerski and his second wife, Anneliese, settled in Tel Aviv, where they remained until 1948. Since publication efforts of his “Jewish Heads” project had come to a standstill,8 in 1933 Lerski began production on a Zionist documentary, Avodah, possibly at the suggestion of Dr. Ernst Aaron Mechner, the head of the Berlin office of the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael. The film was financed by Paul Boroschek, a Berlin banker who had set up Palestine Pictures Ltd as an investment in the infant film industry of Eretz Israel. Boroschek, who may originally have planned the project with another director and cameraman, also sought financial support for the production, which was to cost approximately £3,000, from Leo Herrmann, general secretary of the Keren Hayesod in Jerusalem.9 Using a small hand-held 35 mm camera which could only hold very short rolls (15 meters), Lerski was his own cameraman, shooting the film without synchronous sound. Although the camera allowed only relatively short shots, its lightness gave Lerski the capability of moving unobtrusively among the workers in the fields, in order to capture details and impromptu moments of the work process which would have been inaccessible to a director working with a larger camera and crew.10 Postproduction, including a very complicated sound mix, was done at the Hunnia Studios in Budapest. The wellknown German composer Paul Dessau wrote and recorded all the music in six weeks, with Laszlo Vajda handling the sound direction and Dr. Gerhard Goldbaum, formerly the head of Ufa’s sound recording department, supervising the exactly timed postsynchronization. The press acclaimed the film, although its artistic and propagandistic goals were thought to be in conflict at times. A critic at the press screening in Jerusalem in April 1935 noted: “It is not a paradox if one says that at\n\n20\n\nThe Nation Imagined on Film\n\ntimes the artistry of Lerski is too great: viewing this supreme achievement one forgets the object of his depiction.”11 Another Jüdische Rundschau critic in Berlin wrote: “Work . . . That is the whole film’s content, its images often intensifying to highest dynamism. Man and machine are its theme. The machine’s stroke, the wheel’s drive, the piston’s hammering, the drill’s clanking. Not since Potemkin have we seen such a rhythm.”12 The Palestine Post was equally ecstatic in its praise: “In this picture Lerski’s artistic skill shows itself at its best. . . . Here the camera shows not only the light of the faces, but the very light of the souls.”13 Comparing the film to Potemkin and Storm over Asia, film critic Hans Feld, formerly of Berlin, wrote: “I have never felt more forcibly the compelling suggestiveness of an epos in pictures.”14 The Zionist newspaper Selbstwehr (Prague), however, complained about its lack of propaganda value: This Palestine film has the peculiar feature of not showing any Jewish cities, not a single settlement, and almost no human beings. Palestine is seemingly devoid of human life. One sees shoes, legs, hands, arms, faces— not whole human beings but only parts—not whole settlements, but only rooms, windows, doors, not complete landscapes, but only fields, beds, weeds.15\n\nThis last opinion seems to have been shared by other members of the Zionist community. Efforts to distribute the film through the Keren Hayesod Fund failed, although Paul Boroschek’s belief that it was blocking exhibition in favor of its own film Land of Promise (1935) was apparently unfounded.16 While Keren Hayesod correspondence demonstrated both positive and negative views of the film, Leo Herrmann agreed to distribute it; but Boroschek lacked the financial means to supply prints or acquire the negative, which was held as collateral by the Hungarian lab.17 After a private screening (attended by an enthusiastic John Grierson) in the house of British Zionist leader Harry Sacher, the film was shown at the Academy Cinema in London’s West End but failed to receive screenings in Germany, the United States, or South America.18 The film did receive limited distribution in Europe through Otto Sonnenfeld’s Slavia Films (Prague).19 In point of fact, Avodah was not really suitable as Zionist propaganda, unlike Land of Promise, which was a straightforward documentary with narration, emphasizing Jewish Palestine’s economic boom and opportunities for capitalist investment while downplaying the more socialist aspects of the kibbutz movement.20 Avodah, in contrast, was essentially a work of art with leftist tendencies and few references to Jewish reconstruction: a quotation from Isaiah, a Star of David, a Hebrew prayer (the only spoken words in the\n\nHelmar Lerski in Israel\n\n21\n\nfilm), and khalutzim (pioneers) singing the anthem of the Hashomer Hatzaʾir (literally, Young Guard, a Zionist-socialist youth movement). Small wonder that one Zionist official at Keren Hayesod characterized the film’s image of Palestine as “a glorification of the dictatorship of the working class, rather than a Jewish land of the future.”21 Scenes of Jewish communal life, customs, religious rituals, and social gatherings were almost totally absent. In point of fact, three reels of outtakes reveal that Lerski originally shot much more traditional material (for example, a Purim festival, the Hebrew University, scenes of Tel Aviv, Allenby Street, the Jewish Agency Building, an Arab market, children playing, and the Western Wall), all of which was eliminated in the final version in favor of a very narrow selection of formal themes.22 The film opens with a pioneer walking to Palestine from Russia (an archetypical image of early Zionist documentaries) and a long, less typical sequence portraying Arab life in the British Mandate. The film’s main theme, reinforced through a recurring image of a water wagon and Dessau’s musical leitmotif, is the need for water for survival. Following sequences on the building of roads and houses in Tel Aviv, the film’s final two reels focus on the often frustrating search for water, culminating in a symphony of gushing water as a drill strikes a subterranean reservoir. Through rapid editing that sequence becomes a symphony of water images flowing over parched land, recalling King Vidor’s similarly constructed sequence in Our Daily Bread (1934), which Lerski may or may not have seen before finishing his own film. Both films are obviously indebted to the Russian montage techniques of Sergei Eisenstein and especially Alexander Dovzhenko. Typical of Lerski’s style, the film utilizes extreme close-ups of machines and men, their facial features, the sweat on their bodies, and the dirt and oil of equipment, highlighted by intensely reflected light. Lerski later circumscribed the photographer’s aesthetic possibilities as follows: “The eye of the image maker is always looking at a portion of the whole, that area where his light falls. It is always merely a cut-out, a shot, a distant close-up.”23 The film is indeed nothing less than a visual symphony of hard physical labor in the desert, fragmented through editing into a formal play of movement, physical shapes, diagonally composed camera angles, shadows and light, music and sound effects. Rather than constructing a unified view of the Zionist project, the idea of work is lifted out of the historically concrete setting of Palestine in the 1930s into a timeless and idealized notion of human progress through labor, through which Lerski is again striving to capture the human spirit in images of beauty. Indeed, in its use of the film medium as raw material for abstract concepts instead of as a referent to the\n\n22\n\nThe Nation Imagined on Film\n\nreal world, Avodah has more in common with avant-garde Neue Sachlichkeit experiments such as Walter Ruttmann’s Berlin—Symphony of a City (1926) than it does with the propagandistic documentary common to the era.\n\nZionist Film Production Early in 1935 Lerski completed the short film Hebrew Melody, which he coproduced with another German Jewish refugee, Walter Kristeller, and the Jewish Kulturbund of Berlin. Lerski shot footage of the world-famous violinist Andreas Weissgerber walking through Jerusalem’s old city and playing the popular tune by Joseph Achron of the film’s title in front of Absalom’s Pillar. Sound recording and postproduction were done by Shabtai Petruschka in Berlin’s Tobis Klangfilm Studios, when Weissgerber toured Berlin in March 1935, with Joseph Rosenstock and the Kulturbund Orchestra accompanying him.24 As in Avodah, Lerski edited numerous close-ups of Weissgerber’s hands, face, and body into sequences that emphasized fragmentation rather than the unity of the musician’s performance. While the film was distributed by the Keren Hayesod, it was apparently not widely seen.25 In spring 1939, after Lerski returned to Palestine from a long stay in England, the executive committee of the Histadrut under Golda Meir and Aharon Remez asked the sixty-eight-year-old filmmaker to help set up a film division. Lerski organized a modest 16 mm film unit, where he trained young filmmakers, including Robert Sziller, Rolf Kneller, and Naftali Rubenstein. In an interview Lerski noted: “At my age I cannot expect to make the Palestinian film of the future. I can only hope to train people who will stand on my shoulders. First small documentary films, then a real Palestinian picture. No Hollywood. Something sprung from the soil. Born out of strife and struggle of this hard land.”26 In 1939–1941 Lerski and his Histadrut film group produced at least four films: Yaddei Hashemesh (Children of the Sun), shot in the Kibbutz Givat Brenner; Amal (Labor), about a technical school of the Histadrut (the Hebrew Worker’s Union in Eretz Israel); Kupat Kholim, about Histadrut’s health care organization; and Labour Palestine, a history of the Histadrut.27 In November 1941 the film workshop was forced to close down, due to the worsening war situation. None of these films were known to have survived, since the labor organization placed little value on moving images. Recently a print of Yaddei Hashemesh was discovered, however, and is now preserved at the Steven Spielberg Film Archive in Jerusalem; it was released under the English title Children of the Sun.28 As the title of this film indicates, its focus is on children in the kibbutz. We first see babies and toddlers in their cribs, outdoors,\n\nHelmar Lerski in Israel\n\n23\n\ngetting lots of fresh air. Older children are then seen playing on a jungle gym and also swimming in the kibbutz pool. Children of all ages are also shown working for the benefit of the kibbutz: feeding chicks, herding and milking cows, planting fields and saplings for new orange trees, and later clearing rocks from new fields for planting. Moving indoors, we see children playing, creating handicrafts, or reading, the implication being that they are also being educated properly and not just functioning as child labor. Another sequence shows slightly older children with paper hats and wooden swords forming teams for war games, a gentle reminder that vigilance and defense of the kibbutz’s perimeter is a fact of life. In contrast to Avodah, Lerski and his team mostly eschew extreme camera angles, focusing instead on showing the children in the kibbutz as integrated members of the community. Given the collaborative nature of the Histadrut film collective, Yaddei Hashemesh is much less formalist and much less consciously aesthetic than Avodah and more of a document visualizing human beings. The last minutes of this short film make an overt pitch for the work of Histadrut, fulfilling the film’s specific propagandistic intentions, which were probably to raise money for more pioneering work. After World War II, Lerski directed another short film, Balaam’s Story (1946), produced in conjunction with the puppeteer Dr. Paul Loewy. Financed by Keren Hayesod, the film was an adaptation of a puppet theater play, taken from the Old Testament Book of Numbers and probably based on Hugo Adler’s play Balak and Baalam (1934). Kurt Weill was originally to have written the music, which was composed by Karol Rathaus, based on Weill’s motifs. Giving human expression to an inanimate puppet through light, Lerski constructed scenes exclusively through close-ups, thus hiding the puppets’ strings, developing their dynamism through camera movement and action within the frame. The animation of the puppets was to create a new kind of cinema, according to Lerski.29 The film’s narration states that “this was a story of a curse, of a people who are cursed with no land and no right to govern their own wish to live together.” While this overt Zionist message could be culled from the story, it is not known whether it matched Lerski’s intentions: the short was never released but instead was incorporated into the feature film Out of Evil (1951), directed by Joseph Krumgold.\n\nTomorrow Is a Wonderful Day (1947) Lerski’s final film, Adamah (1947), was produced by Otto Sonnenfeld for Hadassah (a Zionist women’s organization) and was to become the first feature-length film of the new state of Israel. Shot at Ben Shemen boarding\n\n24\n\nThe Nation Imagined on Film\n\nschool and youth village, the film presented the fate of a young teenaged boy who, having survived the hell of Auschwitz, must learn to overcome his psychic wounds and trust his fellow humans again. The film’s story, typical for the times, was to present Ben Shemen to the American Jewish community as a shining example of the educational work being done in Israel.30 After completing the shooting, which was assisted by Lerski’s pupils from the Histadrut collective, Robert Sziller and Naftali Rubenstein, Lerski sent the rough-cut to the United States for postproduction. As in the case of Avodah, Paul Dessau wrote the musical score, while Shabtai Petruschka handled the orchestration. In New York the film was shortened and reedited by Hazel Greenwald and released by Hadassah under the title Tomorrow Is a Wonderful Day. According to Anneliese Lerski, her husband “was beside himself with anger at the film’s premiere at the Locarno Film Festival” in July 1948, “since it had been completely chopped up, destroying Lerski’s best and most beautiful intentions,” with scenes missing and others (not shot by Lerski) added.31 Given that only the short version of Tomorrow Is a Wonderful Day was known to have survived, it has been difficult to ascertain to what degree the Americans had revised Lerski’s original film or even whether this surviving short version was what was shown in Locarno. Receiving a standing ovation at Locarno, the film was universally praised by the international press. The Baseler Nachrichten wrote: “The entire film makes the impression of a highly significant document through which a gifted film producer addresses to the world forum a life-affirming message in an emotional way.” After the Israeli premiere, the critic for Davar (a Hebrew newspaper associated with the socialist worker movement) wrote: “This film teaches and elucidates, in a sublime form, the chapter of the absorption of the children from exile, and of love of the homeland.”32 The New York Times claimed that “the film’s continuity and photography leave something to be desired” but otherwise praised the semidocumentary quality of the film.33 After opening in New York in April 1949, the film earned four times its original production cost of 100,000 Swiss francs. In terms of its lighting and photography, Tomorrow Is a Wonderful Day was a typical Lerski film. Utilizing numerous close-ups, reflecting the bright sun through mirrors into his youthful actors’ faces, and presenting the skewed vision of its young hero, Benjamin, through oblique camera angles, Lerski gives the village of Ben Shemen a larger-than-life presence. At the same time, Lerski’s fragmented editing and the multitude of spoken languages (reflecting the origins of the children) create a sense of emotional chaos that certainly reflected the atmosphere of the times. In one classroom scene, all the children reveal their origins in various European countries,\n\nHelmar Lerski in Israel\n\n25\n\nmaking it evident that Benjamin is not the only one to have suffered during the Shoʾah. Only slowly does Benjamin learn to sort out at times confusing impressions and come to grips with his new reality. He initially hoards food and refuses to take part in either the play or the work of the children and young adults. Finally, with the help of a young girl his age, Miriam, he begins to realize that this is his new home. He is chosen to carry a torch to the Hanukah celebration, the Festival of Light. Moving from darkness to light, Benjamin’s path from the darkness of the concentration camp to the light of the kibbutz Hanukah celebration thus completes his integration into the community and gives the short version of the film its dramatic high point. Given the discovery of a long version, it can now be surmised that the short version was probably put together by Hadassah for nontheatrical distribution to American audiences after the New York theatrical release. In 2009 a more complete version of Tomorrow Is a Wonderful Day was found in France and rescued by the Steven Spielberg Film Archive in Jerusalem.34 This version is only slightly different from the previously known short version for its first five reels. For example, the scene in the classroom where children name their home countries includes an Arab Jew from Syria, who was later removed. Was he left on the cutting room floor to keep American sympathy focused on the European Shoʾah (Holocaust) victims? In any case, the long version adds two more reels, after the concluding Festival of Light. Included in this edition is a substantial amount of footage of athletes marching in Maccabi-like games, which was probably not shot by Lerski and was at least partially the cause of his irate response at Locarno. Indeed the footage makes little sense and is edited somewhat chaotically. Furthermore, the film now ends with the news of the founding of the state of Israel on May 14, 1948, footage that was most certainly added by Hazel Greenwald at the last minute before the film’s July premiere at Locarno. But most of the footage in the final two reels involves following Benjamin as he joins a group of older teenagers who establish a new kibbutz in an undeveloped desert area. Like Avodah, this section of the film focuses on the absolutely backbreaking work of building barricades, clearing fields, constructing housing, digging wells, defending the land against Arab attacks, and eventually harvesting a first crop. At one point, Lerski centers the frame on a sign in Hebrew that reads “Adamah” (earth, soil), indicating that this new generation of Israeli youth is rooted in the soil. That soil has been Jewish for thousands of years, as a walk through ancient ruins by the youths demonstrates, while an announcer on the radio underscores the notion of this “old-new” Jewish homeland. Another scene shows young girls dancing, dressed in what are supposed to be ancient Hebrew costumes. The film concludes with a mon-\n\n26\n\nThe Nation Imagined on Film\n\ntage of the pioneers, plows, aerial shots of Israel, and close-ups of children’s faces, “the hope of Israel,” an apotheosis that once again recalls Avodah. The long version of Tomorrow Is a Wonderful Day thus moves from the intense subjectivity of Benjamin and his narrative of rescue to the larger story of the founding and development of the modern state of Israel, with its youth firmly leading the way. According to an early treatment of the script, this subjectivity, which was reinforced by concentrating solely on Ben Shemen and the activity of the young immigrants (youth Aliyah), seems to have been what Lerski was striving for. That subjectivity was undermined by Hadassah’s insertion of stereotypical and historical images of Israel’s reconstruction as well as the scenes of independence. In other words, just as Avodah had been pared down to the essential theme of work, Adamah was to be about the rebirth of hope, nourished in the soil of Ben Shemen. To include documentary shots that broadened and generalized the film’s view defeated Lerski’s aesthetic intentions. It is conceivable, however, that Hadassah preferred a more directly propagandistic narrative that could be used for fund-raising purposes and eventually distributed the short version of Tomorrow Is Another Day in America because it focused on the rescue of European Jewish children from the concentration camps while deemphasizing the harshness of life in the kibbutz, which would have been unpleasant for American viewers. Of all the filmmakers to work in Israel before statehood, Helmar Lerski was certainly the most original as a film artist. The single-mindedness of his artistic vision, his formal concerns as a “writer with light,” and his desire to shape his documentary visions into something timeless, a “metamorphosis into eternity,” beyond the more narrow propagandistic concerns of his Zionist funders, have given his films their lasting value. At the same time, it is clear that Lerski’s films failed to accomplish their overtly propagandistic missions as advertisements for Eretz Israel, given their limited distribution and their distribution in “unauthorized” versions. Yet for the Israeli cinema of the future Helmar Lerski’s aesthetic legacy as the nation’s first gifted filmmaker was certainly an auspicious beginning. Notes\n\n1.

The chapter traces these changes in various films, including Siege (Matzor, 1969), Peeping Toms (Metzitzim, 1972), The Wooden Gun (Roveh Khuliot, 1979), Time of Favor (Hahesder, 2000), and Campfire (Medurat Hashevet, 2004). The creation of masculine Jews in early Zionism in opposition to the perceived effeminacy of diasporic Jews has been exhaustively discussed in the past, most recently as part of the post-Zionist debates during the 1990s.1 These discussions form the basis and background for the present examination, without referring to them directly. Moreover, numerous studies of Israeli literature and cinema, including a number of essays in this anthology, are premised on this analysis and demonstrate plausibly and conclusively how early Israeli fiction and films promoted this new Jewish-Israeli masculinity. To mention two of the most representative works which do that, I would point out Moshe Shamir’s 1951 novelistic memoir of his fallen brother, Elik: With His Own Hands (Bemo Yadav: Pirkei Elik) and the 1955 film Hill 24 Doesn’t Answer (Givʾa 24 Eina Ona). In his best-selling novel, Shamir set up one of the most comprehensive images of the Sabra in Israeli literature.2 Like the mythological founder of Athens, Elik is described as symbolically 30\n\nEcce Homo\n\n31\n\nemerging out of the earth or in his case the sea. He is a consummate New Hebrew: tall, handsome, free-spirited, independent, yet loyal, responsible, hard-working, determined, and brave. Elik is dedicated to his family and his friends and above all to his emerging nation, for which he dies in battle as a young officer. The film Hill 24 Doesn’t Answer, which focuses on several fighters in Israel’s War of Independence, presents Elik as the brash and brave David Amiram. The film expands the salubrious effects of Israel and Zionism on Jewish manhood even more in the image of Yehuda Berger, a weak and frightened Holocaust survivor who in the course of the film is transformed into a confident captain in the nascent Israeli army. The history of Israel and its escalating conflict with its Arab neighbors deepened the connection between masculinity and military service, which persisted in Israeli films in the decades that followed independence and continues to this very day. Again, the subject has been well researched,"
