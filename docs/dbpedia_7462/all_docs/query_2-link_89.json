And since March 2020, on Zoom.\n\nBy learning from our holy teachers over a broad spectrum of Jewish thought spanning many times and places — from traditional to Kabbalah to Hasidus to Renewal, and from each other — we also, over time and with God’s help, get the opportunity to become people of wisdom.\n\nThe Torah Circle is about honoring Torah and raising the sparks. Please join us, to listen deeply, to speak, and to learn."
