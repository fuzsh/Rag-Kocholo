These papers supplement testimony at hearings of the Joint Economic Committee on economic problems of women held in July of 1973 under the chairmanship of the Honorable Martha Griffiths. Since then, the influx of women into the American laJbor force has accelerated and their progress toward economic quality with men has risen still higher on the national agenda. Today, more than ever before, the formulation of national economic policy requires both a stronger data base on women's employment, and a broader consensus on how to maximize their further contributions to the U.S. economy. I believe that these papers will be helpful to the members of the Joint Economic Committee and other Members of Congress in their assessment of these critical issues.

DEAR SENATOR HUMPHREY: Transmitted herewith is a compendium of papers entitled \"American Women Workers in a Full Employment Economy.\" This compendium of papers was prepared for the use of the .Subcommittee on Economic Growth and Stabilization. The Joint Economic Committee has involved itself with the economic problems of women since July of 1973 when hearings were held under the chairmanship of Martha Griffiths. These problems have become more complex over time and the steadily increasing number of women coming into the labor force has focused more attention on this phenomenon. It has become increasingly apparent that national economic policy for full employment cannot be developed without incorporating a solution to both the problem and the potential of women in the labor force. For these reasons, we believe that the first step in policy development is a greater understanding on women's labor force participation, their economic progress and supportive social programs. We believe that this compendium has initiated this search for more information in a number of vital areas. The collected studies encompass topics ranging from structural jol:;> discrimination, underemployment, parttime work, education and career training, tax treatment of working wives, to international experience meeting the needs of working women. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis V Twenty-two experts-economists, lawyers, sociologists, educatorswere invited to contribute to this compendium.

In seeking to correct this relative lack of attention, a growing body of economic literature, of which this compendium is a part, has sought to spotlight the past, present, and foreseeable job role of American women, and those factors responsible for change. But events in the form of women's own activity-thei,r extraordinary influx into the labor market-have outdistanced theory and intensified the need for more up-to-date understanding. The single most outstanding phenomenon of our century [is the huge number of women who are entering the work force.] Its long term implications are ab• solutely unchartable in my opinion. It will affect women. men and children and the cumulative consequences of that will only be revealed in the 21st and 22nd century (Eli Ginzberg).1 *Consultant to the committee. Mr. Ginzberg ls Chairman of the National Commission for Manpower Polley and Columbia University economist. New York Times, Sept. 12, 1976, p. 1. 1 https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (1) 2 Even the short-range consequences of women's massive entry into the work force are only beginning to be understood and addressed by society. The root causes of the phenomenon have become clearer, if only in retrospect: the psychological revolution in women's attitude toward themselves, toward men, and toward women's role in society; the change in women's lifestyles, as evidenced by their later age of marriage and childbirth, as well as reduction of the size of family; the desire of married women and men to have two incomes so as, in the case of many couples, to enjoy at least minimal living standards, and in the case of other couples, to achieve more comforts and conveniences; and the increase of separation and divorce, forcing women to be selfsupporting. W'ith so many antecedents, it is not surprising that women's aspirations generate profound pressures of both a quantitative and qualitative nature for increased and improved job opportunities. These pressures are substantial in an economy which has set a limited goal of reducing unemployment somewhat below mid-1970's levels. For an economy that raises its sights to the achievement of full employment, the pressures become still stronger, more complex, and pervasive. Thus, the relationship tends to be reciprocal: women seeking job opportunity and equality urge a national policy of full employment in order to attain their economic goals, and for men to do likewise; once such a national policy is declared, it cannot be fully realized without upgrading women's lagging role in the job market. The goal of this compendium is to view women's overall role in a full employment economy and then their particular problems in fulfilling that role. It begins with an overview by two economists; then continues with 15 chapters by economists, lawyers, educators, and other scholars, arranged in five sections: Overcoming barriers; support services and adjusted conditions; education and employment; Key factors: tax treatment and media images; and international comparisons. In the description which follows, the views of the authors in the compendium have been summarized with only limited interpolation in the inte,rest of communicating directly the tone and substance of their respective views. A. Status of Women Workers Essential to setting future national policy is an awareness as to women's current status in the labor market: why they work, what occupations and industries they work in, problems they encounter, and remedies that might help resolve the problems. As of December 1976, 39 million women aged 16 and over were in the labor force. The proportion of the labor force between the ages of 18 to 64 who were women reached 56 percent. During the past quarter of a century, while the total labor force ~rew by about 31 million, women constituted more than three-fifths of the increase. In every age group, the proportion of women who are working has steadily risen. Particularly notable, the rate for married women with husbands present and with children under the age of 18 increased nearly 2½ times during 1950-75, while for those with children under the age of 6, the rate more than tripled. Women's entry into the labor market has been facilitated by growth of the economy, and of service jobs in particular, but it has not been https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 3 achieved without difficulties. Unemployment among women has consistently averaged higher than for men during the past 30 years. In 1975 women's unemployment hit a post-World War II -peak of 9.3 percent;' it averaged 8.6 percent during 1976. Comparable figures for men were 7.9 percent and 7 percent, respectively. With substantial unemployment among both males and females, family incomes decline, poverty increases, public revenues drop and the Nation utilizes fewer resources to meet the needs of men, women, and children. Women are motivated by a new set of aspirations and needs in their efforts to achieve equality with men. Economic independence is a basic goal for women. Psychological rewards are the \"pull\" behind their desire to work. Women-like men-gain increased self-reliance and confidence, have more power to influence events, and enjoy the satisfaction that comes from contributing their talents to the world at large. New social and economic realities are the \"push\" behind women's need for employment. In 1975, 42 percent of women workers were single, widowed, sepa·rated, or divorced and needed to support themselves and their dependents. An additional 28 percent were married to men who earned less than $10,000 a year. A new sociocultural pattern has emerged : in 49 percent of all marriages, both spouses were working, as of 1975. Once employed, women are likely to want to continue working. A sample of employed women were asked whether they would continue to work for pay even if there were no economic necessity; 59 percent answered yes. Because women are concentrated in a relatively few low-paying occupations and remain at the lower rungs of the job ladder, they continue to earn far less money than men; they earn less than 60 percent of men's earnings. For many years, the median earnings differential on the basis of sex was attributed in large measure to the discontinuity in women's employment. While this was a major factor in earlier years, when a large percentage of working women left the labor force after marriage to have children, the discontinuity of women's employment has decreased in recent years. There is markedly less difference in the worklife expectancy of the two sexes today. B. 11!acroeconomic and Microeconomic Pol-icies The Employment Act of 1946 set forth a mandate \"to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.\" \"Maximum employment\" presumably means employment of those who want to work, and applies equally to men and women. \"Maximum production\" can be construed to mean that people of both sexes should be able to work in jobs where they will be most productive. Even under the limited goals of the 1946 act, assessment of the intention of women to enter and remain in the job market has become essential to optimal economic planning. But the Bureau of Labor Rtatist,ics has consistently underestimated the growth in the female labor force: in 1973, the BLS projected a participation rate for women in 1980 that was already exceeded in 1974. Accurate prediction and planning are particularly important to women's employment prospects, which may be a:ffe.cted by future macroeconomic policy even more than men's prospects. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 4 For instance, the latest Government figures indicate that women, teenagers, and blacks have benefited least from the decline in unemployment over the past 2 years, and experienced male workers have benefited the most. While the decline was approximately 40 percent among experienced workers, it was far less £or new entry and reentry workers, primarily women and youth. Decline was 25 percent for fulltime workers, only 7 percent for those seeking part-time work, again primarily women, and 12 percent for teenagers.1a What would be the effect on women's employment if a Full Employment Act were passed and fully implemented i A proponent, Mary Dublin Keyserling, projects that reducing unemployment to 4 percent by mid-1981 would add about 9 million job holders to the labor force over and above the number employed in 1976. An estimated 60 to 65 percent of these jobs would be available to women, for women represent a very large part of the reservoir of potential workers on which a fully growing economy can draw. Unemployment among women, both as recorded officially and hidden, would be reduced far more percentagewise than among men. Welfare outlays would diminish sharply, for many women now on public assistance would want employment and would be able to obtain it. Healthy rates of economic growth would also encourage wage gains for these now earning sub-subsistence wages, the majority of whom are women. Would these sanguine projections be accompanied, it may be asked, by some adverse consequences for both men and women~ Would further intervention by the Federal Government in the job market, entailing increased Federal spending and taxation, lead to a rising price spiral, an expensive rise in public employment and harmful dislocations in the private economy, as opponents counted Answers to these questions would require a definitive evaluation of full employment policy, per se, as it relates to all segments of the economy. For purposes of the present compendium, the focus is necessarily more limited-to consider some of the implications of future policy and, at this point, to examine job problems of women under present and past national policy. To maintain economic equilibrium between inflation and unemployment, Isabel V. Sawhill suggests that national policy should not rely solely on fiscal and monetary policies. She supports a selective set of employment or income (wage-price) policies. On the employment side, these measures would target programs at those groups which have above average unemployment-women, teenagers, and minorities. With the possible exception of the latter, these groups have a common characteristic of a lack of recent labor market experience. In helping to overcome women's problems of transition from school or home to work, a broad variety of measures are needed: Te provide new skills or upgrade old skills, to end job discrimination and to provide support services for homemakers. Nationwide job policies should take into account the local and regional variation in both the number of jobs available and the number of jobs desired. On the demand side, women's participation in the labor force varies widely by State and by urban, suburban and rural sections. The chief but not sole cause of disparities in participation is the vwriation on the supply side, that is, differences in the local availability of jobs. A further factor on the demand side is the variation in projections of employment_ growth by regions for 1970---1985; 1• \"Jobs Rise Helps Males Most,\" the Washington Star (May 8, 1977), p. A5. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 5 the range in growth rates is from a low of 21 percent in New England to 38 percent in the far west. In addition, projections of the occupational composition of employment in the future reveal disparities between the likely developments in specific job openings and the preparation and wishes of both men and women. There follow now the principal findings and recommendations by the compendium authors ori selective problems experienced by women. II. OVERCOMING BARRIERS Although the Nation is committed by law to job equality between men and women, there is still a wide gap between the goal and its fulfillment. Legal enforcement of programs against discrimination lags; other impediments to equality-economic, cultural, psychological-persist. De facto occupational segregation still restricts an overwhelming number of women to a narrow range of low-paying, dead-end jobs which are traditionally \"female.\" Underemployment is more. characteristic of the female than of the male work force. Mothers' and homemakers' intermittent entry and reentry into the job market is penalized instead of assisted by society. Mature women face special problems in resuming a role in the labor force and would benefit from specialized support measures. A. Legal Action Against Sex-Based Discrimination in Employment Equal employment opportunity-without regard to sex-will not be achieved until judicial decisions more fully implement the provisions of title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other laws and regulations against sex-based discrimination, and the responsible administrative authorities more adequately enforce the antidiscrimination provisions within their jurisdiction. After more than a decade of title VII litigation involving sex discrimination in employment, widespread patterns of stratification, underutilization and disparate compensation continue throughout the Nation's work force. One indicator as to the inadequacy of legal remedy is that from 1965 to 1975, only 13 percent of all sex discrimination court cases were awarded \"class relief.\" This is despite the fact that such,relief is supposed to be awarded under title VII whenever a policy or practice has harmed a protected group by discrimination, necessitating relief to the class to make it whole. While deciding numerous cases concerning racial discrimination claims under title VII, the U.S. Supreme Court had decided but one case concerning a sex discrimination claim under title VII, as o:f Decemb'er 1976. During the past decade, in Federal District and Appelate Courts, express exclusionary policies have been repeatedly deemed to violate title VII, but subtler forms of sex discrimination and those based on statistical demonstrations of disparate treatment of women have received less even treatment by Federal courts. Mary C. Dunlap contends that, with some exceptions, \"judicial standards governing disposition of sex discrimination cases have diverged substantially from standards developed in race discrimination cases under title VII,\" i.e., a double standard is being :followed. She feels that an overall improvement in the courts could be fostered by affirmative action in Federal https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 6 judicial appointments, to help overcome the disproportionate underrepresentation of women. (In 1975, the Federal bench had more than 600 judges. Just six of those judges, including 1 black, were women.) Over and above title VII, there are a number of other Federal prohibitions against sex discrimination in employment, including the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA), Executive Order 11246, and title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. Despite various difficulties, major gains have come from private citizens bringing direct lawsuits. In contrast, Government agencies appear to lack commitment and are found to be inadequately enforcing the sex discrimination laws and regulations for which they are responsible, such as EPA and Executive Order 11246. Under the Equal Pay Act, which is concerned with discrimination in compensation only, the ·wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor can conduct investigations of employers' compliance with the Act, whether or not an employee makes a complaint. Although the Division's actions to date have Been limited, the large sums of money found due to thousands of women, as for example in the American Telephone and Telegraph case, indicate the pervasive nature of sex discrimination in wage rates. As in the case of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,2 which administers title VII, the ba<'k1og of EPA cases awaitin~ action is unduly large. Executive Order 11246 prohibits Federal contract funds from going to employers who discriminate in their employment policies and practices. One of its strong advantages is that it requires contractors to develop affirmative action plans. Its disadvantage is that, unlike tit]e VII and EPA, individuals cannot sue directly, but must rely on the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, or one of the 11 Federal contract compliance agencies, to investigate complaints filed. The Government Accounting Office (GAO), which :recently reviewed the enforcement efforts under this Exooutive order, has :found them seriously ineffective. Virtually no Federal funds have been terminated because of sex discrimination practices. Enforcement of title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in employment or student programs or policies of educational institutions receiving Federal funds, also has been found by the GAO to be seriously inadequate. Since the Government is not carrying out its function, the effectiveness of title IX may hinge on whether individuals and groups can sue schools directly; several pending court cases will determine the answer to this question. Early passage of the Equal Rights Amendment by the three additional States necessary to assure constitutional ratification is urged by Keyserling. Although it is difficult to foresee all the effects of a constitutional amendment, proponents of ERA feel that it will have a strong salutory effect, if only because of the psychological message it will carry-that is, sex-based discrimination must be eradicated. On the congressional front, equal rights advocates seek to undo the decision of December 6, 1976, by the Supreme Court which struck down a lower court ruling that General Electric Co.'s exclusion of pregnancy and childbirth from disability income and sick pay violated • See, for example, \"The EEOC Has Made Limited Progress in Eliminating Emplo:vment DiscriminatiO!,\" a report to the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare (Washington, D.C.: 1.:.teneral Accounting Office, October 1976). https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 7 title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as written. Proponents of corrective legislation regard it as essential in order to close what they view to be a large loophole opened by the Supreme Court in title VII's prohibition against sex-based discrimination. If, £or purposes of disability insurance or sick pay, pregnancy is treated any difierently than a man's elective medical decision, proponents feel the result is to legitimize discrimination against women. The insurance industry pomts out that if pregnancy expenses were uniformlv covered, the resultant costs would be about 6 percent more than is currently being spent for disability income and sick pay plans. These costs would be borne directly and indirectly by both men and women. B. Increasing Access to Nontraditional Jobs 1 Countermeasures are suggested against what is regarded as women's de facto job segregation in traditional jobs-a condition which limits women's economic and psychological satisfactions and lowers the total economic product of society. Forty percent of employed women are still concentrated in 10 traditional fields-secretary, retail trade salesworker, bookkeeper, private household worker, elementary schoolteacher, waitress, typist, cashier, sewer/stitcher and registered nurse. In those 10 fields, women comprise 80 percent or more of the workers, except for retail trade sales personnel, where they make up 69 percent. Male employment shows much less concentration, with less than 20 percent of male workers in the 10 largest occupations. The tendency of women to cluster in a few selected occupations contributes to overcrowding, which in turn is a factor in relatively low wages. A. common characteristic of these occupations is that, with the exception of bookkeepers, teachers and registered nurses, they require comparatively little training; with easy entry, supply tends to exceed demand. A. first step toward ending overconcentration is to improve guidance counseling and widen the range of job training. These efforts will not in themselves alter de facto job segregation; barriers may persist against women's entry into other fields. Even in traditional \"female\" occupations, there is a lack of :promotion opportunities. One study noted that two-thirds of all jobs m New York City municipal hospitals do not have educational or training requirements for entry, but neither do they have promotional possibihties. Analysis of 270 labor market segments in the occupationalindustry matrix showed that only 38 had a considerable proportion of their jobs organized for promotion based on on-the-job training. Few of the 38 had many women employees. A view of overall trends among the Nation's occupations does show that occupational segregation i1:1 beginning to give way-slowly. The rate of growth of women workers in occupations characterized as male intensive (75 percent or more of employment in the occupation is male) has been faster than in women's employment as a whole. But female entry has often occurred in shrinking or dying occupations which men no longer want. Among blue collar and lower level occupations where women have made large gains in their share, total and male employment have either been declining or increasing quite slowly. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 8 In certain occupations where there is \"sluggish\" overall growth, with the number of male jobs increasing, if only slightly, the female proportion has risen, but the outlook for future growth of the field itself is limited. This includes such fields as upholsterers, furniture finishers, bartenders, recreation attendants, and lumber inspectors. Strong growth of female employment in male intensive occupations is closely associated with rapid expansion of total employment m these managers rose approximately 2,000 percent between 1960 and 1974; the female share of employment rose from 9 percent to 21 percent. Women moving from female intensive to male intensive jobs do earn more money than formerly, but tend not to earn the same amount of money as the men who are doing identical work. Thus, opening nontraditional jobs to women will not, of itself, lead to equalized earnings. Nor do all women want nontraditional jobs. Rather, the individual woman will make her choices based not only on I?ay, but on job satisfaction, educational background, working conditions, stability of employment, prestige, husband's type of employment and other factors. For better educated women, the minimal goal of equal access to and participation in suitable jobs is still to be achieved. In male-dominated professions such as law, medicine, and accounting, the proportion of women has increased only slightly. Occupational segregation is more likely to persist if full employment is not achieved. Unless there is a much closer approximation to full employment, the failure to satisfy the demand for jobs in numerical terms will preclude any serious effort on the desegregation front, i.e., to provide the types of jobs which will meet the demand for greater similarity in the occupational distribution of men and women. (Beatrice G. Reubens and Edwin P. Reubens.) 0. Underemployment The reduction of widespread underemployment, with its waste of human resources, will require governmental policies which enable women to obtain jobs that match their abilities and skills. Underemployment is defined as: A.n involuntary employment condition where workers are in jobs, either parttime or full-time, in which their skills, including formal and work experience training, are technically underutilized and thus undervalued relative to those of other individuals of similar ability who have made equivalent investments in skill development. (Gerald P. Glyde.) There is no adequate measure of underemployment at the present time. Employers' inaccurate perceptions :and imperfect labor market information may contribute tto bias against hiring women workers for jobs appropriate to their abilities. Employers may choose not to hire women based on an over-generalization as to women's weaker attachment to the la;bor force. The fact that many women do interrupt their job continuity does not constitute a justification for prejudice by an employer ~gainst all women. A women or number of women applying for a particular vacancy may have as strong or stronger labor force attachment than a particular male applicant or applicants. Internal or within-firm hiring and promotion may likewise be based on_ employer misperceptions. Even though they may have equivalent skills, women \"outsiders\" competing with men \"insiders\" for job https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 9 vacancies above the entry level may tend to have their ability discounted. Women within a firm may also be discounted because of an employer's continued misconception of their anticipated \"quit rate\" and because of occupational segregation. Four other factors contributing to underemployment are: The lack of suitable part-time work; intermittent home and family duties, which can result not only in a decrease of skills, but in women's loss of confidence to compete for jobs; the customary primacy of a husband's career, which may necessitate women's geographic moves; credentialism, although there have been few validations of a correlation between credentials and job performance. Because of women's concentration in a more limited number of educational courses and occupations, and because of the increased entry of women into the labor market, they are less able to compete effectively as the demand for a given skill ebbs. Women ( and men as well) become caught by the time-lag between the period that the market signals a decline m a :particular type of job and the time that college students ( or other tramees) begin to shift away from that particular career choice. Women who are already employed are less able to transfer to new fields because of job segregation, and they are less likely than men to invest in retraining because women's return on that investment will be smaller. Recommendations for remedying women's underemployment tend to be the same or similar to those recurrently proposed throughout the compendium as remedies for a host of other problems--women's unemployment, inadequate access to vocational education, and apprenticeship, etc.: 1. A full employment economy.-Employers, finding it more difficult to hire qualified males, would turn to women and qualified minorities, and in doing so, would become more knowledgeable about women's work performance. 2. Enforcement of antidiscrimination laws in hiring and promotion.-Screening procedures which are genuinely related to job performance should be differentiated from those which are prejudicially discriminatory. 3. lmproved labor market information.-This includes (a) more refined methods of forecasting demand and supply, so as to assure a better match between workers and jobs, and ( b) improved identification of new and emerging occupations and more insight into the link between occupations and the transferability of skills. 4. Gender-neutral career orientation.-Counseling in the classroom from ea-rliest school years on helps to improve women's awareness of the world of work. 5. Incre(J)Jed on-the-job training to prepare workers for vertical job mobility.-One aspect is cooperative education, which combines work experience and formal education. 6. Paraprofessionalism.-Relaxing rigid work rules enables individuals who lack graduate or postgraduate education to acquire skills to perform subprofessional duties under careful supervision. 7. More and better part-time jobs.-This is particularly important for professional and skilled women workers. Handicapped and older workers, as well, would benefit from shorter and more flexible work weeks. 91-6$6-77-2 https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 10 D. Special Problems of lvfature Women Specific governmental policies are necessary to meet the employment problems of mature women, whose years of family responsibilities may entail a pattern of intermittent job entry, withdrawal, and reentry. Mature women who have been out of the job market :for a number of years face a particularly severe problem in finding suitable work. These women include: (a) Mothers who prior to raising children may never have been in the work :force at all, or for only a :few years; ( b) those :forced by a:brupt circumstance&-divorce, separation, desertion, de1ath of spouse-to support themselves. When a woman suddenly becomes head of a family, the economic burdens may be overwhelming. The Jong range effects pervade American life. In 1975, 17 percent of children under 18 lived in a single parent home; 9 out of every 10 of these children lived with their mothers; 44 percent of these femaleheaded :families were poor. The increasing number of divorces makes more and more women economically vulnerable, particularly because almost half of those eligible for child support or alimony never receive it. Of those who do receive financial support, the mean amount meets only about half of a family's subsistence ( that is, poverty level) needs. Only about 3 percent of all eligible female-headed families receive sufficient child support and alimony alone to put them over the official poverty level for their size family. Both mature and younger women's difficulties in finding gainful employment under such conditions may have their origins in decisions they made long before marriage. From precareer on, women tend to underestimate their future labor force participation and to undercommit themselves to formal and on-the-job training. Black women are considerably more realistic than white women in anticipating their future labor participation, but young women of all races need substantially more guidance in preparing for their future lives. When a mature woman seeks reentry, she may confront biases against age, which a mature man also may face. But her problems are compounded by the fact thait if she has been a homemaker, some of her skills are likely to have depreciated during years out of the job market, and she may have been unde,rtrained to begin with. One way by which Government could assist reentry is by encouraging women to use the public employment service more fully, and to direct that such services re,ach out more effectively to women. Currently, only 29 percent of women, compared with 37 percent of men, use State employment services. Another method of assisting reentry is by means of a retraining subsidy, which could be funded from the unemployment compensation fund; this method has been used in some European countries for many years. One type of assistance contemplated under displaced homemaker programs in 26 States aims ,at providing education, retraining, counseling and other jOlb services for special groups of mature women, such as the divorced, widowed and separated. A pilot program is now being conducted in Oakland, Calif., under a 2-year State grant of $200,000. The program is geared toward the homemaker who has lost financial support, is too young for financial aid, or too old or unskilled to find https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 11 work readily. Through workshops, the creation of on-the-job training opportunities, validation of volunteer work and contact with potential employers, the Alliance of Displaced Homemakers is helping many women become financially independent. Other services to homemakers also bear consideration. One possibility is Sawhill's suggestion that husbands with homemaking wives might contribute to State unemployment compensation funds. Another is Grace Ganz Blumberg's social security proposal-to credit one-half of the husband's social security contribution to the homemaker wife's account. Either protection could be a valuable buffer against poverty of the homemaker who becomes \"displaced\" before or after 65. Some European countries give broad categories of women, such as homemakers, mothers and mature women, preferential treatment in counseling, testing, training on-the-job and in the classroom, grantsin-aid for schooling, job placement and other services to help them secure suitable employment. Such aid, somewhat similar to veterans' preferance in the United States, may include subsidies for training, books, relocation, entrance fees, maintenance costs, meals, and sometimes housing and family allowances. Sweden's training program for women is particularly noteworthy. It is based on a government decision to cease recruiting foreign workers in favor of training and employing married Swedish women seeking to enter the labor market. Housewives who want to work report to their local labor office and are enrolled as unemployed; they are then entitled to unemployment benefits, counseling and testing services, which usually result in referral to training programs, with accompanying subsidies. E. Minority Women Minority women, facing heavier economic burdens than white women, may need assistance in coping with their added employment, unemployment, and underemployment problems. Minority women are under greater pressure to be wage earners than white women, because minority men who are family heads have an average income that is lower than white men who head families. These men also have had about twice the rate of unemployment that white male family heads have had throughout the post World War II period. Black female-headed households are more numerous than white. Minority women are even more heavily concentrated in a handful of lowpaying service occupations than white women. Most critical of all, the recorded unemployment rate of minority women was 79 percent higher than among white women, averaging 9.3 percent a year during the past quarter century. Some improvements have occurred in the employment condition of minority women. The wage gap between nonwhite and white women is almost closed. Measured in 1975 dollars, the earnings of nonwhite women for year-round, full-time work increased nearly sixfold from 1969 to 1975. More ·advances can be expected in the future. Length of education for minority and white women is now almost identical. But the quality of educatfon of black women (and men) as compared with that afforded white women (and men) is still an important factor in determining their respective life-long attainments. Very much in black women's favor is the realistic recognition of the likelihood that they will be working most of their adult lives. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 12 F. Teenagers Teenage females, especially minorities, experiencing the highest unemployment rate of any group in the Nation, need special assistance to begin productive careers. In 1976, 19 percent of teenagers of all races and both sexes were officially recorded as out of work, but the rate was 37 percent for minority teenagers and 3½ percent higher for minority girls. These unemployment rates for youth are more understated than for adults because so many teenagers are discouraged from even applying for jobs. One of the most significant factors affecting the likelihood of teenage employment is the employment status or lack of status of one or both parents. In a typically disadvantaged home, a son or daughter does not have the benefit of a helpful job role model if a father is unemployed, underemployed, or absent entirely, or if a mother has a low-paying job or is on welfare. Teenage deprivation, including serious unemployment, is associated with high incidence of crime. One of the most critical events in the life of a young women is the birth of her first child, which may cause her to drop out of school or the labor force, go on welfare, or abandon a career. Those and still earlier choices, as to sexual activity, contraception, and abortion confront an increasing number of teenagers. Urban Institute research indicates that the availability of subsidized family planning services reduces the incidence of premarital pregnancies. Yet only about 40 percent of women estimated to be in need of subsidized family planning services actually obtained them in 1974. For these and the remaining 60 percent of women, widened career options at all ages may hinge on the availability of such services. III. SUFPORT SERVICES AND ADJUSTED CONDITIONS Because women sometimes face double or triple burdens as homemakers, mothers, and workers, they may need support services to help fulfill their multiple roles in society. The homemaker's work is \"work,\" but society neither values it as such, credits her in various ways for her contributions, nor assists her, particularly when she desires to enter the formal work force. Quality child care at an affordable price is basic if the working mother is to meet her job responsibilities without neglecting her children. Work hours could be adapted to women's and men's needs through part-time jobs and flexible work hours. Occupational health problems, especially those affecting the pregnant woman and the fetus, deserve increased attention. A. The Homemaker, the Family, and Employment: Some Interrelationships A meaningful family Iife for the working couple may require support services to help relieve the special burdens of the wife/ mother. Until society abandons the view that ''work\" only includes paid activities, the homemaker will be denied the status to which she is https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 13 entitled and assistance which she may need. Aflluent working parents can make and pay for their own arrangements to fulfill their personal and child care needs. But for millions of other working parents and especially for single parent families, public programs may represent a crucial difference in the quality of adult and child life. In the homemaker's and the family's behalf, Nona Glazer, Linda Majka, Joan Acker, and Christine Bose recommend a broad series of support measures: Round-the-clock child care centers for children up to the age of 15 become more feasible if older children and retired peo• ple are involved in the caring process; Neighborhood Service Houses, rooted in the tradition of Settlement Houses, could offer multiple services, such as job ;reentry counseling, medical day clinics and medical transportation for children, house visitors to facilitate repair services, a distribution point for meals, tools and neighborhood bartering of services, psychological support at times of family stress, and referral to professional help; federally funded holiday camps for employed mothers, modeled after the family holiday camps in Norway, represent another innovative suggestion. Legislation to set up these structures which Glazer et al. recommend would facilitate a change in the structure of national employment standards, they believe. Thus, the lrubor market would accommodate personal human needs, ;rather than the reverse situation which exists today. This would entail such measures as fostering mandatory overtime limits, :flexitime, routine personal leave, paternity as well as maternity leave, and improved status and fringe benefits for part-time work. Precedent for a national family policy is notable in France. Because it is concerned with social, economic, and other elements of family life, France provides a broad set of services for all families, not just the least fortunate. However, French policy is geared, at least in part, to increasing the birth rate so as to compensate for the ravages of war, a situation with which the United States is not faced. Because this country is starting to recognize that we must pick and choose more carefully how the taxpayers' money is spent, and because such family support programs are costly, one approach might be to set up pilot projects. This method of \"sampling\" potential new social programs, then adopting or discarding them, is widely and successfully used in Sweden. B. Economic Aspects of Child Oare A full employment guarantee for women, if it is to be more than an empty promise, would make available a system of child care which is both economically efficient and effective in meeting the needs of young children and their parents. The need for organized child care is indicated by the fact that in 1974, 42 percent of all children under 18-almost 27 million-had working mothers, with more than 22 percent of these children under the age of 6. Yet there are only 1 million spaces available in licensed day care programs for the almost 6 million pre-school children whose mothers work. A wide variety of day care programs coexist: In the child's own home, in another person's home, by their own mothers at work, by https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 14 community, religious and/or business-run centers. Costs in day care centers vary widely, depending on the quality of the staff, their numbers, and education levels, the range of support services, the quantity and quality of food, the nature of the facility and equipment, and whether or not the center is designed to yield a profit. The fact that costs represent an overwhelming barrier to use of day care is confi.rmed by numerous surveys. Private enterprise is discouraged from increasing the sup_ply of formal child care to meet the demand because of the small likelihood of a profitable return from any but upper income users. Whatever the \"mix\" of a child care system, economic planning should take into account the high costs of quality child care and the facts as to parents' willingness or ability to pay. Satisfactory subsidized child care will, in Myra H. Strober's judgment, \"require partial subsidization of even those families with incomes above the median.\" Opponents of subsidization dispute the expenditure of public resources for care of children in families with median or higher incomes. Why, they ask, should a mother who chooses to raise a child entirely by herself and to forego any job income, neither receive nor expect a subsidy, while a woman who transfers part of the child-raising burden to society in order to earn her own income, be subsidized? Even as regards the children of lower income families, critics ask: should taxpayers spend, for example, $5,000 a year to give two children subsidized day care so that the mother can earn perhaps $7,000 to $10,00'0 a year? The arithmetic of each case varies, but day care supporters counter that the taxpayer's investment is repaid directly, if only in part, by the higher taxpaying ability of the working mother. More important, the intangible values of society are strengthened by providing freedom of choice-to work or not to work-to women who would- otherwise lose such choice, and by assuring quality care for the coming generation. Noting that the desire for children care is worldwide, Alice H. Cook compares European and other nations' pra.ctices. One of the issues is whether publicly supported child care should be administered by educational, labor or social service authorities-each of which tends to have a different approach to the child. France provides free child care services for a greater number of 2 to 6 years olds (proportionately) than any other non-Communist country. It, in effect, starts its free education system at the age of two, instead of five, as the United States does. All French day care homes, no matter how small, are registered, inspected and licensed, and must adhere to established standards. All children who are placed in careeven with a close relative-are registered. An unusual service-a shortterm nursery called Halte Garderie (Child Parking)-is available even to nonworking mothers, so that they can be free for shopping or leisure pursuits. France's system emphasizes care at the young formative ages, when assistance is most needed. Sweden has the most all-inclusive and integrated program of preschool and school-age childcare of any country in the non-Communist world; that is, it has the broadest range of services. Before and after https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 15 school care includes supervision 0£ homework and play activities, hobby programs, free activities, breakfast, and mida£ternoon snacks when necessary. While Sweden relies on full-time formal day care centers, it also utilizes family day care to help parents who work irregular hours or need overnight care £or children. Sweden's com:{lrehensive ca,re of sick children ranges from sickrooms at centers, to child visitor services to homes, and includes transportation 0£ ill children. Sweden's system emphasizes total child care around the clock and throughout the year for all ages. The Swedish program was planned by representatives of government, private and public social welfare, and employers' and employees' orgamzations. A plus in the Swedish system is that family day care mothers, who are under Government supervision, have 90-day training programs available to them, as well as such •amenities as insurance coverage, vacations, and established wage rates. This gives reco~ition to the paraprofession 0£ \"family daycare mothering\" and establishes it as a desirable category in the labor force. 0. Part-Time Work Wives, particularly mothers, who choose to work should have the option of career-oriented part-time jobs. A similar option for men would provide greater flexibility in the sharing of parental and household responsibilities, and add to the quality of life. Despite widespread interest, there is a lack 0£ career-oriented part-time work. Practically all part-time jobs today are the lowest paying ones; virtually anyone taking part-time work today suffers substantial career and economic penalties, ranging from lack 0£ opportunity for promotions to loss of fringe benefits. Yet the disadvantages of part-time work are less than those of dropping out all together, which results in depletion of skills, lack 0£ confidence and an image in employers' eyes ,as lacking attachment to the work force. Industry should be encouraged to rethink its own concepts of the workday and work continuity. While experiments in the 4-day week are increasing, most businesses have resisted part-time employment for a variety 0£ philosophical and administrative ,reasons. Contrary to the general perception, part-time work need not increase the cost of benefits, because required statutory benefits can be offset by adjustment of optional benefits. Flex-time, which faces less resistance than part-time work, has been found to be mutually rewarding £or both employer and employee, based on observations 0£ a number 0£ companies where it has been used. Institutionalizing part-time work options-for both men and women-offers these benefits to society: 1. Children benefit. Their emotional and other needs ,are met by the availability of not just one, but both parents, at different times. 2. Parents benefit. The desire of both father and mother to share parental responsibilities is fulfilled. 3. Women benefit. The shorter workday makes it easier £or a woman to work while she retains the psychological benefits of being a \"good mother.\" 4. Business and industry benefit. The \"magnetism\" 0£ part-time work can attract quality employees into the work force. Companies https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 16 may experience greater produotivit_:r and lower unit costs, due to reduced absenteeism, turnover, recrmtment activity and overtime pay. Higher productivity may also occur because ,an employee can maintam a :faster work pace for 4 to 6 hours a day than she/he can for 8 hours. 5. Labor and society benefit. The sharing of work opPortunities would be facilitated in a society where the number of jobs available is not keeping pace with the growth in the number of potential workers. In addition, greater equality of opportunity is assured between men and women. Increased time away from work adds to the quality of life. 7. Taxpayers benefit. The burden of taxpayer-subsidized child-care centers is reduced. Carol S. Greenwald urges structural changes in the occupational system, such as have already begun in Sweden. There, a parents' insurance system, replacing a maternity allowance system, makes it possible for both parents to alternate working part time for a given period after the birth of a child, without any economic or occupational penalty. Greenwald suggests that parental leave (in place of maternity leave) and part-time work options be -required by the Department of Labor as part of the affirmative action program for Federal contractors. The absence of such provisions, she believes, is discriminatory in effect and is not Tequired as a matter of business necessity, but is based on mere cu.c:tom and convenience. Critics view the proposed imposition on employers of mandatory part-time work as unjustified intervention in private enterprise. In their view, consequences may include arbitrary dislocation of efficient work schedules, elevation of personnel and other business costs, and the inflation of prices to the consumer. 1 D. Maternal, and Other Health Needs The topic of support services would not be complete without a brief consideration of women's health as affected by employment, a subject which is not covered by an individual paper within the compendium. The influx of women into the job force and specifically into a broadened range of occupations has outpaced society's alertness as to the health implications to the woman worker, especially the pregnant woman and her unborn child. Few issues represent more of a double-edged sword than that of proposed standards for women under the Occupational Health and Safety Act. On the one hand, rigid standards may result in automatic screening out of women applicants in a way which may be regarded as discriminatory; on the other hand, pregnant women (including those who are not aware that they are pregnant) may risk substantial injury to themselves and to their unborn children in hazardous work environments. The pregnancy-related dilemma faces women even in such traditional occupations as operating room attendant, dental assistant, radiology technician, and flight attendant, where scientific evidence has begun to question the safety of what had formerly been considered relatively healthy work environments. The issue is drawn more sharply as women enter into the chemical, mining, and other heavy industries, where dangerous substances have been suspected for some time and are now becoming increasingly recognized. There is wide agreement that, at the very minimum, women should have the benefit of timely information before entering into such occu https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 17 pations, or, if they are already so employed, as soon as scientific information on hazards is validated. It is obvious that men also are entitled to information concerning occupational health hazards. Health poses a problem to the working woman in othere woman in other ways, as well. Information remarns sparse on the impact of workman's compensation on women; the problem of coverage of pregnancy under disability income and sick paY. protection awaits congressional resolution. The female-headed family and two-worker parents are inadequately served by a health system which does not have flexible hours for child clinics. IV. EDUCATION AND w ORK Improvement in the Nation's system of education and training of women could play an important part in achieving the goal of full employment. Career education is developing as a useful tool to aid women's and men's decisions at each stage of life. Vocational education could be a much more significant aid to women if they could share equally with men in its benefits. Similarly, the apprenticeship system, still largely closed to women, could add to the diversification of their work opportunities and the increase of their earnings. Subsidized training and retraining would enable women to strengthen their human capital. · A. 0 areer E duaatwn Career education can broaden and sharpen individuals' knowledge about both their own abilities and the labor market's opportunities, and can help them arrive at the best decisions about their work lives. Women, in particular, 'benefit from career education, a concept which helps relate current learning to future careers. National tests indicate that 17-year-old girls-the age when career decisions are in the process of being made-have a less realistic understanding about careers and working than do boys of the same age. Another study of adults indicates that sex stereotyping within our society makes it increasingly important that career education be incorporated into our educational system in order to counteract these neg-ative patterns. Substantial literature by both Government and individual employ• ment specialists document the fact that career education can improve individuals' self-assessment and development as workers, their occupational awareness and preparedness for work, and their ability to put it all together through skilled planning and decisionmaking. Lack of career-oriented education and training is one of the strong root causes of women's inability to establish themselves in upwardly mobile careers. Access to genderless-oriented education and training on an equal basis with men is a start towards providing full employment for women. Without it, all other support programs will not, achieve their potential. Recommendations to facilitate the growth of career education include the following: 1. Career education should become mandatory in all schools and encouraged in other community programs. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 18 2. Community career education action councils should be established. 3. Career education concepts should be included as a standard part of the curriculum for educators. 4. Schools should become more flexible---fWith open entry and open exi,t--to serve the job needs of women of all ages. 5. Tax, and other reforms should be used to encourage the retraining and upgrading of women's working skills. B. Vocational Education Vocational education is booming, but present opportunities for girls and women are still limited to clusters of low-paying, traditionally \"feminine\" occupations, and little attempt is being made to open up nontraditional areas. With almost 6½ million women and girls enrolled in public vocational classes in 1972, about 4 out of 5 were being trained in home economics and office practices. Few women are being trained for the 20.1 million jobs that estimates indicate will exist by 1980 in the better paying trades, industrial and technical jobs, and for which high schools offer entry level courses. These latter jdbs, unfortunately, are viewed primarily as male occupations. A 1974 report showed that 98.5 percent of all students in Wisconsin high school industrial classes were boys. In one city, the average expected wage for trades learned by girls was 47 percent lower than for trades learned by boys. At the postsecondary level, admission of women is hindered by inconvenient school hours and location, lack of child care facilities, and limited distribution of publicity about the programs. Some of the following steps would be helpful in upgrading vocational education for women: Improvement in counseling based on more research on how females make career decisions ; an introductory course on the changing career patterns of women, labor market projections and wage differentials of occupations; better literature and audiovisual materials--prescreened against traditional stereotypes; updating of counselors' knowledge and skil1s by summer institutes and inservice training programs; tours for young girls of vocational classrooms and industries; visits to schools by women workers in a broad range of occupations: simulated job experience kits for fields in which expansion is prrojected, 0. Apprenticeship Apprenticeship, one of the most important doors to skilled and well-paid jobs, remains all but closed to women today because of deep-rooted custom and outright discrimination. The reasons for the exclusion of women are multiple: Most apprenticeships are in male-dominated occupations which have historically tended to perpetuate barriers on the ground that the jobs are \"unsuitable\" for women; the stereotypes deter women from a-pplying; jobs traditionally held by women are perceived to require Jess training and therefore are excluded from the apprenticeable trades. Women account for only slightly over 1 percent of all registered apprentices. Over 415 different trades and crafts are apprenticeable, https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 19 according to Federal Government standards; the 21 oonstruction trades account for approximately 64 percent. Thirty-six onehundredths of 1 percent (0.36) of apprentices in the highly paid building trades were women in 1975. Among these key trades, only carpenters and electricians had more than 100 women apprentices at that time. Why is apprenticeship important j It is a bargain for those high school graduates who cannot afford continued classroom education. They can earn a wage while simultaneously acquiring a skill leading to still higher income. Long waiting lists of hopefuls attest to the desirability of being accepted as an apprentice. A forward step taken by the Manpower Administration is the apprenticeship outreaich program, which emphasizes recruiting, counseling, and tutoring women for apprenticeships and which now covers 27 cities. Despite their potential promise, these programs achieved only \"modest results\"-according to a Civil Rights Commission study in 1974. An improve'moot in the apprenlticeship systeln would be to admit women exceeding the maximum aige, as part of affirllll8Jtive action. Overview of the program could be strengthened by correcting underrepresentation of women within the Department of Labor's Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, which has 240 males and only 14 females. It should be borne in mind that recessions have an adverse effect on the numbers of apprenticeships, as it does on so many other programs which offer increased career opportunities. 1 D. Higher Education The component of American society which might best show evidence of the results of women's increased iaspirations is ltih.e segment that has documented and fostered those aspirations, namely, American higher education itself. Women's status as students and members of faculties in colleges and universities is not treated as a separate paper in the compendium, but the ,relative unevenness of women's progress in higher education is noteworthy of comment. The wom.en!s proportion among students in undergradua,te, gradu<ate, and postgraduate instill;ut,es bias continued to rise. By 1974 the proportion of women aged 18 to 19 going to college equalled the proportion of young men. In 1975, more women than men took the scholastic aptitude tests, the first time in the 49 years that the SAT's have been in existence. But, most important, the percentage-24 percent-of women among all faculty on academic year contracts remained the same in 1974 and 1975, while the percentage of women ranked professor, associate professor and instructor actually decreased. The average salaries of these pmfessionals remained less than that of men. Title IX, approved in June 1972, prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in eduCJational progmms which receive Federal funds, including recruitmenit and :admission, fiooncial 1assistance, housing, and h1ring of professional faculty. Title IX, plus other legislation such as the Medical Education Act, have been instrumental in opening the doors to medical and 1Jaw schools and other gradu1ate facilities.

On the other side o:f the coin, affirmative action programs required by title IX have been characterized by college administmators as a \"mixed blessing\" which has lowered standa:vds, led to \"reverse discrimination\" against whilte males, and increased unive,rsity paperwork and other costs. v. KEY FACTORS: TAX TREATMENT AND MEDIA !MAGES Reforms should be considered in both the tax and social security systems in the interest of justice for working as well as nonworking women. Another adverse and pervasive factor is mediadisseminated stereotypes which may handicap girls and women at every stage of their intellectual and economic development. A. Impact of the Tax System and Social Se(}1.l,rity on Labor Force Participation Changes are required in the American tax and social security systems whose. direct or indirect inequities may discourage women from working, or penalize them if they choose to work. Three major problems in the tax treatment o:f the two-earner :family are: (a) The marriage penalty, which substantially increases the tax bill o:f the two-earner :family. (b) The fiscal inequity o:f failing to differentiate between the traditional worker-housewife couple and tho emergent two-earner couple, whose greater earnings are offset with increased but often nondeductible job-related expenses. (c) The work disincentive to potential second family earners, since the second family earner's first taxable dollar is effectively taxed at the first earner's highest tax rate. Suggest10ns offered to overcome these difficulties include: (a) A system of individual tax treatment of earned income, similar to Sweden's, or an option to married taxpayers to choose individual treatment o:f earned income, similar to that o:f England, Norway, and other countries. (b) An allowance to second earners to accommodate the working couple's higher cost o:f earning income. In the social security system, Blumberg identifies the issues and offers several remedies: 1. Worker-housewife couples frequently receive substantially more benefits than two-earner couples, even though earnings and social security payments are equal. To achieve parity in determining benefits, Blumberg suggests that working couples should be permitted to combine their earnings up to the maximum taxable wage base ( rather than as at present, computing benefits :from the separate earnings of two bases). 2. The married working woman realizes little or no benefits from her social security payments because she can only collect from one account (usually her husband's). It has been argued that the married woman does receive benefits because her payments cover more than https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 21 her retirement benefits-her own disability, and survivor's benefits. If this is the rationale, then the married woman's contributions should be adjusted downward to reflect the actual coverage she is purchasing. 3. There are inequities in the calculation of \"replacement income\" for women. Retirement benefits are computed by averaging earnings for all years except the lowest five; employed wives and working mothers may have been home for child rearing and homemaking for a cumulatively longer period than 5 years. Some countries have treated women's absence from the labor market because of pregnancy and child rearing as \"covered employment,\" and credited the married woman's account with some ascribed earnings. 4. In the event of divorce, many nonemployed wives and mothers lose their dependent status and are deprived of their social security eligibility; thus, older housewives may be left entirely without retirement income; younger housewives may not have a basis for an adequate average earning record. A comprehensive solution offered by Blumberg is equal apportionment between husband and wife of all spouse's contributions based on wages. In her opinion, this would \"more profoundly reflect the view that marriage is an economic partnership: * * * that each spouse has an interest in all income generated during a marriage, and that the housewife does make a valuable economic contribution to her family\". B. Effeats of M (J,88 Media Stereotypes on W omerJ,'8 Employment Efforts should be made to reduce sex bias in the content of mass media if a constructive self-realization of women is to be encouraged. While women's role in society and in the labor market has experienced vast changes in the past quarter century, the mass media's unrealistic portrayal of that role is an impediment to women's equality. One television study showed that commercials mentioned 43 different occupations for men, only 18 for women. When TV shows reveal someone's occupation, the worker is most likely to be male. Women's magazines have traditionally focused on women as homemakers, ratlier than as workers, but have recently become more responsive to change. In the Nation's newspapers, news of :food, fashion, weddings, and society-not jobs-has tended to dominate the women's pages. A substantial body o:f research suggests particularly profound effects of media stereotyping in restricting the horizons of young women; these effects may well deter girls from undertaking career-oriented education or training programs. The mass media may also exert a conservative force among adults, which prevents affluent and other women :from seeking employment and discourages women who must work from seeking better jobs or higher goals. Gaye Tuchman recommends a. co~l?lete analysis of the effect of mass media upon women and mmor1ties. She also suggests Federal Trade Commission restrictions on sex-typed advertising during children's viewing hours; banning sex-role stereotypes under the National Association of Broadcasters Code; Federal Communications Commission denial o:f renewal of station licenses if program stereotvping is :found; and priority given to affirmative action programs in the mass media. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 22 CONCLUSION Full employment is a moving target ; it takes a growing number of jobs to provide for a growing labor force, and women are currently the prime movers of the target (Isabel V. Sawhill). The targets are moving as well for government and :for all other institutions-business, labor, education, and social sciences-as they respond to women's rising economic aspirations. To the authors o:f the' compendium, the achievement o:f women's equality in a :full employment economy is the logical and necessary culmination o:f the phenomenon o:f their massive entry into the labor :force and o:f the rights to which they are entitled under law. The authors note that even in the absence o:f a :full employment goal, the success o:f macroeconomic growth policies is affected to a greater degree than ever before by the Nation's ability to estimate, to plan :for and to accommodate the intentions o:f women workers and potential workers. Noninflationary, cost-effective microeconomic policies could help open up career opportunities for groups with special needs, such as mothers with infants and small children, displaced homemakers and mature women, and teenagers-especially minorities. A :fundamental reality o:f this era is that women's economic progress has already attained an inner momentum which will intensify their quest :for job satisfaction and equality. Traditional acceptance by women, as well as by men, o:f substantial unemployment and underemployment is likely to give way to a consensus for national policies which will make better use o:f all human resources. \"'Whether or not these policies become embodied in a :full employment goal, as such, increased effort may be anticipated to end sex-based discrimination and de :facto job segregation, to improve ·women's education and train~ ing so as to :foster sel:f-:fulfillment in jobs, and to expand support services, especially :for the homemaker and working mother. To achieve these and other objectives, the specific recommendations within this compendium carry direct and indirect pri~e tags, as y~t largely unknown. But the :failure to ass~ll'e wome!1's opt_1mal economic role also entails costs o:f both a tangible and mtang1ble nature to women, men, and to all society. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Part I.

Inflation rises and inflicts an especially hard blow on women. Poverty increases, family incomes decline, and business earnings fall. These developments and the resulting reduction in public revenues lessen our N'llltion's capacity to meet the needs of its people. Women, whether wage and salary earners or full-time homemakers, are affected by the consequences to a disproportionate extent. The highly disadvantaged position of women in the American economy today exists despite the fact that their participation in the labor force has advanced rapidly during the last two and one-h:alf decades. In 1940 they represented 29 percent of all workers. By 1976 their proportion had increased to 41 percent. While they have comprised more than three-fifths of the growth in the civilian labor force during this period, they have moved increasingly into the lesser skilled, lower paid jobs. Despite the fact that national legislation directed toward the elimination of discrimination in employment on the basis of sex, among other grounds, has been on the statute books for more than 10 years, the relative employment status of women has shown little improvement in some respects and has actually deteriorated in some more significant ways. •Consulting economist In private practice In Washington, D.C. She was the Director of the Women's Bureau, U.S. Department of Labor, 1964-1969. 1 Full employment In this paper ts based on a level of employment consistent with the rPductlon of unemployment to an overall rate of about 3 percent. This Is treated as the \"frictional\" level of unemployment, that Is, those unemployed are primarily wage and ~alary earners moving from one job to another. This paper assumes that a reasonable and feasible target for the reduction of unemployment 1s to lower the overall rate or unemploymPnt from 7.7 percent In 1976 to 4 percent by mld-1981 (about 3 percent for adults aged 20 and over) and to 3 percent within a year or two thereafter. (25) 91-6S6-77--3 https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 26 Experience during the post-World ·war II years clearly indicates thaJt existing employment inequities strongly resist redress when economic growth rates are slow or the economy declines. When the economy moves into high gear and there are ample numbers o:f jobs available :for those seeking them, gains :for women-and :for all Americans--are very great indeed. This is not to say that strong and specific efforts to eliminate employment discrimina,tion are not needed in periods o:f economic expansion; they clearly are. But such efforts have a better chance o:f achieving their objectives when job opportunities are on the increase. A review o:f where women are in the labor :force and o:f recent trends during times o:f economic advance and decline sheds a revealing light on why :full employment is of signal importance to them. I. WHERE \"\\V'oMEN ARE IN THE LABOR FoRcE As o:f December 1976, 39 million women, aged 16 and over, were in the labor :force-a number which had more than doubled since 1950 and nearly tripled since 1940. Nearly hal:f o:f all women, 16 and over, were employed or actively seeking work. O:f those between the ages 18 and 64, the proportion was 56 percent. Between 1950 and 1976, the total labor :force grew by about 31 million. Women constituted more than three-fifths o:f this increase. With five recessionary interruptions, the economy expanded, although not nearly enough, over this period as a whole. The number o:f jobs was growing and women entered the job market in rapidly increasing numbers. O:f major significance has been the very substantial rise in the proportion o:f women aged 25-64, particula.rly those with children, who sought employment during the quarter century. Among those aged 25-34, there was a 68-percent increase in their labor :force participation rates between 1950 and 1976. The rate of increase :for those aged 35-64 was also very rapid, as is shown in ta:ble. I.

Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, D.C. When 1940 is used as the base year for comparison with 1976, the labor force participation rates for women aged 35-64 had more than doubled. Before World War II, the peak rate of labor force participation was for women aged 20-24, 48 percent of whom were workers. By the https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 27 age of 25, a large proportion of women had already married and the responsibilities of child rearing removed many from the job world. The labor force participation rate of those aged 25-34 was 26 percent lower than among those aged 20-24. It declined another 17 percent among those aged 35-44, and still another 17 percent for those aged 45-54. This continuous decline reflected the greater difficulties of home management than in more recent years, the absence of child day-care facilities, the insufficiency of jobs, and the strong prejudice against hiring middle-aged women, among other factors. After the war, labor force participation rates for women aged 25-34continued to be lower than for those aged 20-24, although to a diminishing degree from 1950 onward. By 1976, women aged 25-34 were 12 percent less likely to be in the labor force than those aged 20-24. Throughout the post-World War II period, the labor force participation rates of women over age 35 have continued to increase. During the past two and one-half decades, the labor force participation of married women with husbands present grew more rapidly than that of other married or single women; it increased nearly 90 percent between 1950 and 1976. The rates for married women with husbands present and with children under the age of 18 increased nearly twoand-a-half-fold during this period; for those with children under the age of six, the rates more than tripled ( see table ]J).

A.. Earnings and Status Most women work for the same reason as most men; they need the money. As of March 1976, 43 percent of all women in the labor force were single, widowed, separated or divorced, and worked to support themselves and their dependents. More than an additional quarter of all women in the labor force were married women whose husbands had earned less than $10,500 in the previous year, or less than what was regarded as needed to meet the minimum requirements of a family of four. Thus, for 7 out of 10 working women, employment is a compelling economic necessity. A large majority of the remaining women also work because they desire to improve their families' economic opportunities. ·while a majority of women of working age are now job holders, they are heavily concentrated in the lower-paid, lesser-skilled posi https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 28 tions which women have traditionally held. In l 975,\" somewhat more than a third of women job holders were in clerical and kindred occupations, and nearly a fifth were in the service trades, excluding private household employment, with median annual earnings in 1974 £or year-round, full-time work of $7,562 and $5,414 respectively. About an additional fifth were sales, craft and kindred workers, and operatives, with median earnings in these three fields combined :for yearround, full-time work in 1974 of $6,100. About 16 percent of working women were in professional and technical occupations, with nearly half of them concentrated in three fields traditionally held by women, also relatively low paid: elementary and preschool teachers, registered nurses, and health technologists and technicans. Because of women's concentration at the lower rungs of the occupational ladder, their median earnings for year-round, full-time work in 1975 were only $7,504, or only 59 percent of the $12,758 median earnings of men for year-round full-time work. Of all women employed year-round and full-time, 22 percent earned less than $5,000. This compares with :fewer than 7 percent of men. At the upper encl of the earnings scale, only 4.5 percent of women earned between $15,000 and $25,000; the percentage of men in this income bracket was six times greater. Fewer than one-half of 1 percent of all these women eanrnd $25,000 or more; the percentage o:f men in this bracket was 20 times higher. 1Vomen's occupational status is very different from that of men. ·while in 1975 they comprised 40 percent of the labor force, they were 99 percent of all secretaries; 98 percent of all household workers and nurses; 96 percent of dressmakers, sewers and stitchers; 85 percent o:f all elementary schoolteachers; 77 percent of all those in clerical occupations; and 58 percent of all nonhousehold related service employees. About three-quarters of all women workers were in these occupations, generally characterized by relatively low average earnings. omen remain poorly represented at the more privileged end of the occupational ladder. In 1974, they were 6 percent of all lawyers and judges, 10 percent of physicians, 14 percent of all chemists, 20 percent of computer specialists, and 31 percent of all college and university teachers, to mention a :few examples. Even within the professions underrepresented by women, they were concentrated at the lower encl of the scale, and some trends have actually been regressive. For instance, in colleges and universities in 1974, women were 9 percent of all full professors-down from 10 percent in 1959-60; they were 15 percent of associate professors-down from 17.5 percent in 1959-60; they were 24 percent of assistant professors and 45 percent of all instructors. These last two ratios were higher than in the base year, but these gains did not compensate for the declines at the higher levels, so that, overall, women lost salarv ground relative to men. At each o:f the teaching levels, the average compensation of women was lower than that of men-the difference of all ranks combined averaging 18 percent lower for women. Another illustration of disparities affecting women is employment in the Federal civil service. The Federal Government might well be ,v • The 1975, rather than 1976, occupational data are used in this connection because, at the time of writing, data with respect to median earnings in 1976, by occupation, for year-round, full-time work, were not yet available. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 29 expected to be the pace setter with respect to affirmative action employment policy, being charged by an Executive order to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. But an analysis of Federal civil service reports indicates that the mandate is far from fulfilled. Women in 1975 were only 35 percent of total white collar Federal employees-about the same proportion as in 1968, and considerably lower than their proportion in the total labor force. Their number in the civil service failed to keep pace with their growing role in the general economy; such progress as they have made at the top, in recent years, has been very slight. In 1975, women were only 2.7 percent of all those in the three highest grades-GS 16, 17, and 18-up from 1.5 percent in 1968. They were only 4.3 percent in the next two highest grades-GS 14 and 15-up from 3.4 percent in 1968. Not only is the overall occupational position of women inferior in relation to that of men; women's relative position in the labor force has been deteriorating in recent years. The comparative median earnings of men and women in year-round, full-time employment were used above as a meaningful index of relative economic status. Comparison of these figures over a period of time shows relative retrogression. Median earnings of women in year-round full-time work were 59 percent those of men in 1975. While this ratio averaged the same in the 1960's, it was considerably lower than the 63 percent average for 195559 and the 64 percent registered in 1955. The wage gap was $3,081 in 1955 (measured in 1975 dollars). It was $5,254 in 1975, or 71 percent larger. B. Work Discontinuity and Work Life EaJpectancy For many years it was argued that the median earnings differential on the basis of sex could be attributed in large measure to the discontinuity in women's employment. This was clearly a major causal factor in earlier periods when a large percentage of working women left the labor force after marriage to bear and rear children. However, while the discontinuity of women's employment has been diminishing very rapidly in recent years, the differences in relative earnings of men and women have increased. Recent studies show that the worklife expectancy of women has continued to lengthen significantly, while it has edged downward for men. As is shown in_ table IV, women's worklife expectancy at birth rose from 6.3 years m 1900 to 12.1 years in 1940, or nearly doubled; by 1970 it had almost doubled again to 22.9 years.
