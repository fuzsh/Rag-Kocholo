        "text": "Bertalan Havasi, Head of the Press Office of the Prime Minister, has informed kormany.hu that Prime Minister Viktor Orbán held talks in the Parliament Building in Budapest with Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs Ibrahim al-Jaafari on the treatment of injured Iraqi soldiers and the fight against Islamic State.\n\nThe parties agreed that defeating Islamic State is essential to establishing security in Europe: if the region cannot be stabilised, terrorism and migration could pose an unprecedented threat to the continent.\n\nMr. Orbán emphasised that Hungary is contributing to the fight against Islamic States in every possible way, and is also offering treatment to twenty injured Iraqi soldiers. The Prime Minister and his guest considered it good news that, despite the unstable security situation, economic relations between Hungary and Iraq are improving, Mr. Havasi said."
