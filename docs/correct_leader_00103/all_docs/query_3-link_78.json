He split from the KDP in 1975 to form the PUK, which controls the south-east of northern Iraq.\n\n9. Abdel-Aziz al-Hakim, Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution (Shia)\n\nNumber two in the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri), the sheikh is the brother of the council's leader Ayatollah Mohammad Baqer al-Hakim, who wants an Islamic regime in Iraq.
