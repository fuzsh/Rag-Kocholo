        "text": "SUSAN STAMBERG, host:\n\nThe prime minister of Iraq begins a two-day visit to Michigan today. That state has this country's largest Iraqi-American population and many of them are very interested in what's going on in their native land. From Michigan Radio, Michael Leland reports.\n\nMICHAEL LELAND reporting:\n\nWhen Iraqis went to the polls back in January to elect a National Assembly, nearly 9,000 people cast their ballots in southeast Michigan. This was among five places in the United States where Iraqi Americans could vote. Many of those same people get a chance tonight to see and perhaps speak to Iraq's Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jafari. He'll host a town hall style meeting at a hotel in Dearborn and meet with the local Iraqi community and religious leaders.\n\nAl-Jafari will also meet with members of the Chaldean American community. Chaldeans are a Christian minority in Iraq, but they comprise the largest segment of Michigan's Iraqi-American population. Martin Manna of the Chaldean American Chamber of Commerce says members of his community want to offer their assistance in Iraq's transition to democracy, but they also want the prime minister to promise his support for protecting Christian villages in Iraq.\n\nMr. MARTIN MANNA (Chaldean American Chamber of Commerce): We need to do that in order to sustain our identity and our culture, because at this point, we have no specific country that protects our language and identity. And since we are the indigenous people of Iraq, you could see how crucial this has become not only for safety reasons but preservation of our identity for years to come.\n\nLELAND: Later in the week, al-Jafari's expected to tour areas of the south affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nFor NPR News, I'm Michael Leland.\n\nCopyright © 2005 NPR.
