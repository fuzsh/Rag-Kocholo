        "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq's Shiite prime minister declared Tuesday he will not be blackmailed into abandoning his bid for a second term, and the Kurdish president bowed to Shiite pressure to delay calling parliament into session until a deadlock is resolved over who should lead a unity government.\n\nPrime Minister Ibrahim Al-Jaafari suggested that the current standoff over his nomination had grown out of a personal dispute with President Jalal Talabani, who is at the center of a campaign by Kurdish, Sunni and some secular Shiite politicians to deny him a second term.\n\n\"No one can make bargains with me by enlarging personal disagreements,\" al-Jaafari told reporters at his office. \"Dr. al-Jaafari will not be subdued by blackmail. Dr. al-Jaafari is not violating the constitution.\"\n\nThe Sunni Arab minority blames him for failing to control Shiite militiamen, who attacked Sunni mosques and clerics after the Feb. 22 bombing of a sacred Shiite shrine in Samarra. Kurds are angry because they believe al-Jaafari is holding up resolution of their claims to control the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.\n\nA political committee representing the seven Shiite parties that make up the United Iraqi Alliance, the largest group in parliament, sent Talabani a letter Tuesday asking him to delay the first session until there is agreement on who should occupy top government positions, said Khaled al-Attiyah, an independent member of the alliance. Parliament speaker Hajim al-Hassani said a new date would be set Thursday.\n\n\"Talks are still under way between the main blocs in the coming parliament,\" he said. \"We hope that during the coming days, we will be able to reach a basic level of agreement on when to call the Council of Representatives to convene.\"\n\nViolence continues\n\nOn Tuesday, scattered bombings, mortar blasts and gunfire killed 16 people.\n\nThe unrelenting violence has complicated already snarled negotiations to form a government reflecting Iraq's main ethnic and religious communities, which the United States and its allies hope will stabilize the country so they can start pulling out troops.\n\nThe senior British general in Baghdad, Lt. Gen. Nick Houghton, told The Daily Telegraph that most of Britain's 8,000 troops could be withdrawn by mid-2008. The Defense Ministry, however, described that as just one possible scenario and said everything depended on conditions on the ground.\n\nA car bomb exploded near a restaurant on the fringe of Baghdad's Sadr City Shiite slum, killing three civilians and wounding three others.\n\nAssailants attacked a Sunni mosque in west Baghdad with guns and grenades, killing a guard and torching two rooms. The gunmen ambushed police when they responded, wounding five officers.\n\nTwo bombs targeting U.S. patrols in two other neighborhoods killed at least one civilian bystander and injured five others, police said. There were no reports of American casualties.\n\nPolice said four Iraqi officers were killed in two separate attacks on police patrols in Baqouba and Beiji, north of Baghdad.\n\nTwo car bombs exploded almost simultaneously at separate sites in the mostly Shiite city of Hillah, south of Baghdad, wounding at least three people, police said.\n\nAt least three other people were reported killed in scattered shootings - a Sunni TV station official and an airport employee in Baghdad, and a police colonel in Beiji. Police found four more bullet-ridden bodies - two of them with their eyes gouged out.\n\nHostages seen on video\n\nA new video broadcast on Arab television, meanwhile, showed three of the four hostage Christian Peacemaker activists. American Tom Fox was not present.\n\nThe Chicago-based Christian Peacemaker Teams said it did not know what to make of Fox's absence from the silent, 25-second video broadcast by Al-Jazeera television.\n\nThe three other hostages shown on the tape dated Feb. 28 were James Loney, 41, and Harmeet Singh Sooden, 32, of Canada; and Norman Kember, 74, of London. Al-Jazeera said the exhausted-looking men appealed to their governments to work for their release.\n\nThe previously unknown Swords of Righteousness Brigades claimed responsibility for kidnapping Fox, 54, of Clear Brook, Va., and the other activists, who disappeared Nov. 26 in Baghdad.\n\nAlso still held hostage in Iraq is American reporter Jill Carroll, 28, who Interior Minister Bayan Jabr has said was being held by the Islamic Army in Iraq."
