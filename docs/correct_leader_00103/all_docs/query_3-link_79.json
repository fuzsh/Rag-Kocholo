        "text": "It happened quickly. Last Thursday, Jawad al-Maliki was in the position of announcing that his boss, Prime Minster Ibrahim al-Jaafari, had given in to the pressure mounting against him and was resigning. A mere two days later, Iraq's powerful alliance of Shiite parties presented none other than al-Maliki himself -- known as a smooth, behind-the-scenes negotiator -- as the new prime minister designate. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice promptly declared him a reliable political partner. After weeks and weeks of waiting, Iraq's political deadlock appears to be over.\n\nThe Shiite from near the holy city of Karbala now has 30 days to form a cabinet. Aspiring ministers planning to implement policies on a religious or ethnic basis aren't welcome, he has explained, promising an inclusive government representing \"all components of Iraqi society.\" After months of violent clashes between Shiite militias and Sunni insurgents -- clashes that have brought Iraq to the brink of civil war -- al-Maliki's statements provide a ray of hope to the embattled country. Al-Jaafari, after all, had proven unable to stop the violence amid Sunni accusations that some in his government were associated with Shiite death squads. Maliki, for his part, has announced his intention to integrate militias into the state's law enforcement apparatus, in order better to control them.\n\nLike his predecessor, al-Maliki is a member of the Hizb al-Dawa party, a Shiite organization that was brutally persecuted under Saddam Hussein. The former despot even condemned al-Maliki to death for his membership in Hizb al-Dawa. Like al-Jafari, al-Maliki went into exile in the early 1980s -- first to Iran and later to Syria, where he directed the \"Jihad Office,\" which coordinated guerrilla operations in Iraq.\n\nAfter the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, al-Maliki returned safely to Iraq. He played an important role in the formation of the new government, though at first he primarily acted behind the scenes. He was deputy chairman of a commission formed to purge Saddam allies from political life and is considered the author of a tough anti-terrorism law intended to crush the Sunni insurgency.\n\nOverzealousness?\n\nCritics accuse him of being overzealous. In fact, some Baath party members thrown out of their positions by al-Maliki were reinstated after it was determined they were mere low level functionaries. His contempt for the Baath party is no secret. Last August he announced his intention to \"put every obstacle in the path of the resurrection of the Baath party and continue to prosecute its leaders.\" But his tough stance may turn out to be a liability -- Sunnis have not shown much enthusiasm for the de-Baathification project.\n\nAl-Maliki has been known to speak candidly on other issues too. In an interview with Ard al-Sawad, a newspaper politically close to the Hizb al-Dawa party, he acknowledged the presence of corrupt officials in Iraq's state apparatus, and last weekend he indicated that the issue would soon become a priority. He was praised in advance by the leading Sunni politician, Saleh al-Mutlak, who said al-Maliki was \"stronger, more insistent and more practical\" than al-Jaafari, in addition to being a good communicator. More than anything, such warm words indicate that several political camps are putting their hopes on al-Maliki.\n\nBut Al-Maliki's nomination as Iraq's new prime minister wasn't just welcomed in Baghdad. London and Washington also got in on the love fest. After weeks of disunity, al-Maliki finally promises to form a government with majority backing -- and he is more popular with both Sunnis and Kurds than his predecessor.\n\nGuido Steinberg, an expert on Iraq at Berlin's Science and Politics Foundation, nevertheless believes al-Maliki's success is far from guaranteed. \"The real issue is who is going to be in charge of the interior and defense ministries,\" Steinberg told SPIEGEL ONLINE. \"If another SCIRI party functionary becomes interior minister, that will lead to conflict.\" The Shiite SCIRI party is blamed for death squad activity by Sunnis. SCIRI stands for \"Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq.\"\n\nOne of al-Maliki's most positive features is that he is less close to radical Shiite leader Muqtada al-Sadr than his predecessor, Steinberg says, adding that it is quite possible al-Maliki, who holds a doctorate in Arab Studies, will succeed in stabilizing Iraq and becoming the first great national leader of the post-war period. But Steinberg also points out that the present situation in Iraq is less than favorable for al-Maliki, and that his success depends in large part on factors beyond his control. Several Arab newspapers have reported that Sunni and Shiite militias are currently preparing for major armed conflict.\n\nNewly elected parliament speaker Mahmoud al-Mashadani had incisive words for those planning such clashes: \"Every hand and every tongue that wants to stall unification by wrong deeds or provocations deserves to be cut off.\" But behind this aggressive rhetoric lies the fear that raw violence may be turn out to be more powerful than politics. Al-Maliki faces a difficult task."
