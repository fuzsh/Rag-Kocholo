The Shiite Coordination Framework, a constellation of Iran-backed parties which made Sudani’s premiership possible, has been expected to press for a reassessment of Iraq’s relationship with the US.\nFailing to reduce Washington’s influence could cost Sudani vital political support. Yet pursuing confrontation with the US could have far-reaching economic and security consequences that could upset the fragile stability Iraq currently enjoys. As a result, the political status quo has largely remained intact since Sudani took office last October.\nTroubled history",
