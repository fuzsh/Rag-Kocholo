        "text": "We got our hands on an MRE — a \"Meal, Ready to Eat\" from the Department of Defense. It's a real marvel of engineering. In one flat bag, there's an imitation McRib, clam chowder, a couple of drinks, and some trail mix, and some note about how by eating this you consent to joining the Marines. All in one flat bag!\n\nSpecial Guest Mike Pesca: This meal disgusts me more before 8 a.m. than most meals disgust me all day.\n\nMiles: I'm going to imitation eat this imitation pork rib.\n\nIan: Anybody got napkins? I'm looking for a few good napkins.\n\nThe MRE really is impressive. It's even got a little heating element you can use to warm up your soup. I got a good sense for how good a soldier I'd make, though, when I lacked the arm strength to open the bag.\n\nPesca: I'm not saying MREs are old, but this thing was bagged during the Ibrahim al-Jaafari administration.\n\nIan: It's so cute how they call the next course Operation Dessert Storm.\n\nPesca: If the Army eats too many of these, it's gonna take a whole new GI Bill to pay for the new GI Bills.\n\nIan: In about an hour, I'm going to dishonorably discharge this.\n\n[The verdict: Fine — not the meal you're going to pick if you don't have to, but a pretty amazing feat to make all that nutrition portable. I'd put the Department of Defense's McRib up against the Golden Arches any day.]\n\nSandwich Monday is a satirical feature from the humorists at Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me!\n\nCopyright 2020 NPR.
