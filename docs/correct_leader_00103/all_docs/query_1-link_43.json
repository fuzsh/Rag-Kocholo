        "text": "The Iraqi diplomat who has travelled to Saudi Arabia for Hajj pilgrimage held a meeting there with Ali Qazi-Askar, the representative of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Hajj and pilgrimage affairs.\n\nIn the meeting, Al-Jaafari said Iran and Iraq have common enemies, pointing to the threat that terrorist groups, such as Daesh (ISIL) and al-Nusra Front, have posed to the entire Muslim society.\n\n“Any disagreement between us (Iran and Iraq) could be solved through dialogue,” he added.\n\nIraq shares 1,400 kilometers of common border with its eastern neighbor Iran, while Saudi Arabia is also its western neighbor, Al-Jaafari said, adding, “Our countries have a lot in common; we can respect each other and stand together considering the geographical and historical position and the interests of the Islamic Ummah (community).”\n\nHighlighting the suitable grounds for stronger unity within the Islamic world, the Iraqi minister went on to say that Muslims should use Hajj as an opportunity to strengthen unity.\n\nIn comments last week, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei described the Hajj pilgrimage as an opportunity for Muslim unity and increased vigilance against the US “satanic policy” of warmongering and support for persecutors."
