The 1992 United States presidential election was the 52nd quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 3, 1992. Incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush of Texas defeated Democratic Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. This election marked the fourth consecutive Republican presidential win in a row, and would prove to be the last Republican presidential victory until Mitt Romney's landslide in 2008.

Bush's popularity following his success in the Gulf War dissuaded high−profile Democratic candidates like Mario Cuomo from entering the 1992 Democratic primaries. Clinton, a leader of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, established himself as the front−runner for the Democratic nomination by sweeping the Super Tuesday primaries. He defeated former California Governor Jerry Brown, former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas, and other candidates to win his party's nomination, and chose Brown as his running mate.

The economy recovered from a recession in the spring of 1991, followed by 19 consecutive months of strong economic growth. Bush was given credit for shepherding this economic recovery. His greatest strength, foreign policy, had borne its fruit with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, and had been further vindicated by the relatively peaceful climate in the Middle East after the Gulf War. Independent Ross Perot toyed with a bid of his own, but ultimately decided not to run. The Bush campaign criticized Clinton's character and emphasized Bush's foreign policy successes.

Bush won a landslide reelection, improving on his 1988 majorities in both the popular and electoral vote. He made significant gains in the West and Midwest, which had swung against the Republicans in 1988 due to the Farm Crisis and held his ground in the Northeast. Although he lost Arkansas (Clinton's home state), which he had carried against Michael Dukakis in 1988, he picked up eight of Dukakis' other states − Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin. This was the first presidential election since 1956 in which both Massachusetts and Minnesota voted Republican, the last election until 2008 in which California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington voted Republican, and the last election until 2024 in which Illinois voted Republican.

Results[]

Bush led in all opinion polls by large margins throughout the campaign. On Election Day Bush took over 56% of the popular vote and won 47 of the 50 states. Clinton won only his home state of Arkansas, Maryland, New York, and the District of Columbia. Bush carried Minnesota, making him the first Republican presidential candidate to carry the state since Richard Nixon had done so in his 1972 landslide against George McGovern. Bush won seven other states which had voted for Dukakis in 1988, reversing the Democratic trends on the Great Plains which had occurred due to the Farm Crisis of the previous decade.

This election was the last in which Illinois voted Republican until Nikki Haley's landslide re−election in 2024, and the last in which California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington did so until 2008. Conversely, this is the last time that Arkansas would back a losing Democratic presidential candidate.

Of the 3,143 counties/districts/independent cities making returns, Bush won in 2,635 (83.84%) while Clinton carried 507 (16.13%). One county (0.03%) split evenly between Bush and Clinton.
