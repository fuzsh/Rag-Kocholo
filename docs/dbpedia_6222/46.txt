Montana

Montana gained statehood in November 1889, just six days after both Dakotas and three days before Washington, in the busiest period for new statehood in U.S. history. Montana has been reliably Republican in recent presidential elections, having voted for only two Democrats since 1952. Interestingly, prior to 1952, the state had voted gone Democratic five times in a row â€“ four times for Franklin Roosevelt and then for Harry Truman. Donald Trump beat Joe Biden by over 16 points in 2020. Montana regained a 2nd congressional district in the 2020 Census; it had lost that in the 1990 Census. As a result, the state will have 4 electoral votes in 2024 and 2028.
