        "text": "There are two main political parties in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. U.S. citizens typically lean to the left, or Democratic, or the right, or Republican.\n\nThe modern-day Democratic Party platform tends to incorporate the views of centrists, liberals, progressives, and left-wing and socialist movements. Democratic politics typically focus on social justice, social equality, regulating economic activity, and ensuring healthcare access. This is in contrast to more conservative or Republican politics, which aim for smaller deregulated government and emphasize the importance of free-market capitalism with little government involvement. In contrast to Republican or conservative politics, Democrats see religion’s influence as less important in American life and politics.\n\nDemocratic politics protect social programs, labor unions, workplace safety regulations, equal opportunity, racial equality, and disability rights. Democrats support abortion rights and the LGBTQ+ community and their rights. Additionally, Democrats tend to focus on the environment, including regulating pollution and supporting clean energy initiatives. When it comes to the economy, a base social safety net provided by the welfare state and strong labor unions have historically been a part of the Democratic platform.\n\nDemocratic, or liberal, states tend to have higher taxes, more laws guaranteeing or supporting individual rights (including LGBTQ+) and equal opportunity, and have more ideologies that do not follow traditional morality, such as that articulated in the Bible.\n\nTo determine which states lean the most democratic, the Cook Partisan Voting Index can be used. The Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) is a measurement of how strongly a U.S. state or congressional district leans toward the Democratic or Republican Party compared to the nation as a whole. For example, if the national average is 51% Democratic, and the Democratic candidate of a state wins 62% of a two-party share, then that state voted 12 percentage points more Democratic than the country, or D+12.\n\nMost Democratic States\n\n1. Vermont\n\nVermont is the most Democratic state in the U.S. with a PVI of D+16. Vermont joined the Union in 1791 and has participated in every presidential election since 1792. Vermont was primarily Republican from 1854, when the party was founded, through 1988 except for the 1964 election. Vermont has been blue (Democratic) since 1992. Vermont is home to the 2020 presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\n2. Massachusetts\n\nMassachusetts is the second-most Democratic state with a PVI of D+15. Massachusetts was one of the 13 colonies and joined the Union in 1788. Massachusetts has participated in every presidential election since then and has voted Democratic every election since 1928 except for four. In the most recent 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden easily beat Donald Trump in the state.\n\n3. Hawaii\n\nWith a PVI of D+14, Hawaii is the third-most democratic state in the United States. Hawaii joined the United States in 1959 and first participated in the presidential election in 1960. Hawaii has voted Democratic in every election except in 1972 and 1984. Hawaii-native President Barack Obama won Hawaii in 2008 and 2012, earning over 70% of the vote in both elections.\n\n4. Maryland\n\nWith a PVI of D+14, Maryland is tied with Hawaii as the third-most Democratic state in the U.S. Being one of the original 13 colonies, Maryland entered the Union in 1788 and has participated in all 58 presidential elections. Maryland has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1992, including in the most recent 2016 and 2020 Presidential elections.\n\n5. California\n\nCalifornia is the fifth-most Democratic state in the U.S. and by far the largest. California has 55 electoral votes, the most of any state, and more than 10% of all available electoral votes. California’s Partisan Voting Index is D+13. California was not always Democratic and voted Republican in every election from 1952 to 1988 except for 1964. The state has consistently been Democratic since 1992.\n\n6. New York\n\nNew York is the sixth-most Democratic state in the U.S. with a PVI of D+10. New York has the third-highest number of electoral votes (29), behind California (55) and Texas (38). New York has voted Democratic since 1988. New York, especially New York City, is known as one of the most progressive states in the nation, with very strict gun laws, a push towards legalizing recreational marijuana, and NYC being one of the nation’s most LGBTQ-friendly cities.\n\n7. Washington\n\nWashington’s PVI of D+8 makes it the seventh-most Democratic state. Washington has voted in every election since joining the Union in 1889, with periods of voting Republican and periods of voting Democratic, including during the Great Depression and World War II. Since 1988, Washington has voted Democratic in every presidential election.\n\n8. Rhode Island\n\nAlso with a PVI of D+8, Rhode Island is tied as the seventh-most Democratic state in the United States. Rhode Island was the last of the 13 colonies to enter the Union in 1790. Rhode Island has also voted reliably Democratic in every election since 1928 except for four. Rhode Island is expected to vote Democratic again in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n9. Connecticut\n\nThe tenth-most Democratic state is Connecticut, with a PVI of D+7. Like neighboring Massachusetts, the state is a Democratic stronghold that has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since 1992.\n\n10. Delaware\n\nTied for the tenth-most Democratic state is Delaware. Delaware is also a D+7 state and the home of current President Joe Biden. Like most other states on the list, the state has voted Democrat in each presidential election since 1992."
