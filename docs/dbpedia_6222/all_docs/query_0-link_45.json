The votes of the public determine electors, who formally choose the president through the electoral college. The number of electors a state receives is determined by the combined number of the stateâ€™s members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. The Twenty-third Amendment, adopted in 1961, provided electoral college representation for Washington, D.C.\n\nThe table provides a list of U.S. electoral votes by state.\n\nTotal: 538.
