        "text": "Americans have voted to elect the 45th US president. Some of the results are in. Here's what is still to watch out for.\n\nThe 50 states and Washington DC voted across six different time zones throughout Tuesday, 8 November.\n\nBut it's not just winning the popular vote that counts. The US's complicated system is a race to secure 270 out of the 538 votes in the electoral college.\n\nMany of the polling stations have closed. So far:\n\nOhio is a bellwether swing state that has backed the winner at every presidential contest except one since World War Two.\n\nThe BBC relies on projections by its US-based partner broadcaster ABC, because it can take days for all the ballots to be counted.\n\nAs for the final result? Stay glued to your phone or TV or set your alarm for 23:00 EST (04:00 GMT). That's when West Coast polls close and history suggests a winner's declared. It was bang on the hour in 2008, and 15 minutes later in 2012.\n\nNorth Carolina, projected for Trump, defines the American divide.\n\n\"It's seen an influx of newcomers. Many of them lean Democrat. But poor white voters tip North Carolina's rural areas towards Donald Trump,\" says the BBC's Katty Kay.\n\nThe key battleground of Florida, which is crucial to the fortunes of any presidential contender, has closed and is a projected win for Trump.\n\nThe state voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, but George W Bush won it in preceding elections - by just 537 votes in 2000. However, that year it took 36 days for Bush to be certified as the winner, as the vote triggered a recount and legal showdown.\n\nWe should hear soon from Pennsylvania, which has swung for the Democrats in the previous six elections. It will be a big blow to Clinton if she doesn't win here.\n\nNew Hampshire (4) will be eagerly watched as the polls suggest it's a dead heat.\n\nThe starkly divided state of Colorado (9), which has a growing Latino population but a strong conservative streak, is projected for Clinton. Historically, it's one of the most widely swinging battleground states, casting its vote for Republican George W Bush in 2004 by a higher percentage than the nation as a whole, but then doing the same thing for Democrat Barack Obama four years later.\n\nThe industrial Midwestern state of Michigan (16) could also cause an upset. Voters there haven't supported a Republican for president since 1988, but a backlash against globalisation has turned the state's heavily populated white, non-college-educated voters to Trump.\n\nKeep an eye on Wisconsin (10), which hasn't gone Republican since 1984. Trump has been making a last-minute push to turn the state red.\n\nNew Mexico (5) is projected for Clinton. It used to be seen as a swing state but Democrats have won five of the past six presidential elections there.\n\nHistorically Republican Nevada (6) looks like it could be a nail-biter, as early voting suggests a Hispanic surge could turn out for Clinton. It's a similar situation in Arizona (11), which has voted Republican in every election since 1952 with the exception of Bill Clinton's win in 1996.\n\nUtah (6) is another interesting one to watch. Former CIA agent and Mormon Evan McMullin, who is running as an independent, is doing well in the polls and could be the only state to hand a loss to both Clinton and Trump, despite backing Republican candidates in the past.\n\nIowa (6) is a must-win for Trump, given his strength among white, non-college-educated voters, but it voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 so it's not a done deal.\n\nMontana (3) has been safely Republican since 1968, bar a single victory for Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\nThe pressure is always on the main American TV networks to be the first to \"call\" the result of a presidential election, before all of the votes have been counted - a process that can take days.\n\nBut there is even more pressure on them to get that announcement right.\n\nNobody wants a repeat of the 2000 election, when the networks had to withdraw their projected result for Florida after prematurely declaring George W Bush the next president.\n\nThe networks have \"decision desks\", groups of statisticians who are kept away from the main news room, and whose job it is to come up with state-by-state projections.\n\nThe BBC is using projections from experts at ABC News - its US broadcast partner - for the presidential race. For the House, Senate and governor races, it will use the Associated Press news agency, which gathers voting data from state and local officials.\n\nMany other networks use AP and Edison Research, which carries out exit polls. The BBC is not conducting its own exit poll as it would at a UK general election.\n\nUnlike most of the US networks, the BBC will not be \"calling\" the result of the election. It will be reporting the projections from the ABC results team, which are made based on expert analysis before all the votes have been counted.\n\nThe president-elect won't actually become the 45th president of the United States until 20 January, which is Inauguration Day. This is explicitly laid out in the US constitution. The president-elect will place his or her hand on the bible and take the Oath of Office at noon. From then, the government is in their hands.\n\nSo is the White House. Usually, the sitting president and their spouse host the incoming First Couple for tea before the ceremony. About six hours later, the new First Family moves in."
