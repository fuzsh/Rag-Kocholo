        "text": "ALASKA\n\nThe race between President Bush and Governor Clinton was too close to call here in this state, which had not given its three electoral votes to the Democrats since 1964. This was the case despite Mr. Clinton's opposition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which Alaskans overwhelmingly favor.\n\nMr. Perot led the polls in early June, but his support faded after his withdrawal and re-entry.\n\nIn the Senate race, Frank H. Murkowski, the Republican incumbent, went into Election Day with a commanding lead over his Democratic opponent, Tony Smith, who suffered a sharp financial disadvantage.\n\nRepresentative Don Young, a 19-year Republican incumbent with 57 overdrafts at the House bank, faced a sharp challenge by John Devens, the former Mayor of Valdez. ARIZONA\n\nThe only state to have voted Republican in every Presidential election since 1952, Arizona gave the Bush campaign the jitters. Recent polls showed Bill Clinton slightly ahead in the contest for the state's eight electoral votes, largely because of voter dissatisfaction with the President's handling of the economy. The state was devastated by the savings and loan troubles and by plummeting commercial and residential real estate prices. Polls indicated that Mr. Perot was hurting Mr. Bush more in Arizona than in any other state except Texas.\n\nAlthough Senator John McCain, a war hero and first-term Republican, was tarnished as one of the five Senators who intervened on behalf of Charles Keating, a savings and loan operator, Mr. McCain was sufficiently confident to join his colleagues on a fact-finding visit to Hanoi earlier this fall.\n\nHis opponents were Claire Sargent, a Democrat who has been active in civic affairs, and former Gov. Evan Meacham, a Republican best known for his opposition to making the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. birthday a state holiday.
