These surveys interviewed voters outside of polling places or early voting sites, or by phone (to account for mail-in voters).\n\nResults from interviews with 15,590 voters are shown below. These numbers have been adjusted to match the actual vote count.\n\nWhile exit polls offer an initial indication of how groups voted on election night, they are not perfect. The polls are not precise enough to distinguish between, say, 53 percent support or 50 percent support from a certain group. Like any survey, they are subject to sampling error, and they rely on estimates of how many people voted in each group.\n\nThese estimates are subject to sampling error. The potential error is greater for smaller subgroups, or for characteristics that are concentrated in a few polling places. They are also subject to other types of errors, such as those that would arise if certain types of people were unwilling to talk to exit poll workers."
