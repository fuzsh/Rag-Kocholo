        "text": "Across the nation, U.S. citizens have different political beliefs. Some citizens lean more to the right – or Republican – with conservative values. In contrast, others lean more to the left and support the more liberal Democratic party.\n\nWhile some states are pretty closely divided, there are others where most residents support one party. One way this is measured is through the Cook Partisan Voting Index, also known as the CPVI. This measures how strongly a state leans Republican or Democratic compared to the entire nation. Following each election, this index is updated to provide the most accurate results.\n\nCPVIs are calculated by taking a look at the average Democratic or Republican share of the last two presidential elections compared to the national average. Results of the CPVI are broken down by congressional district and by state. By using this data, you can quickly determine which states are more Republican or more Democratic.\n\nBased on the latest CPVI data, Wyoming is the most Republican state in the nation. Following behind is West Virginia, then North Dakota takes third place.\n\n1. Wyoming\n\nWyoming is the most Republican state in the U.S. Wyoming has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of +25. Wyoming’s strong Conservative lean is attributed to its large rural, white, and Evangelical populations. Wyoming has voted Republican in every Presidential election since 1952, except for the 1964 election. In the most recent 2016 election, 67.4% of voters voted for the Republican candidate Donald Trump, a 46% advantage over the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.\n\n2. West Virginia\n\nWest Virginia is the second-most Republican state with a voting index of +22. West Virginia has made several shifts between Democratic and Republican since it became a state in 1863, each shift lasting through several elections. West Virginia has voted Republican in every presidential election since 2000. 68.6% of voters voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election vs. 26.5% who voted Democratic.\n\n3. North Dakota\n\nNorth Dakota is the third-most Republican state in the United States. North Dakota has a Republican voting index of +20. Since becoming a state in 1889, North Dakota has participated in 32 presidential elections and has voted Republican in 26 of them. North Dakota has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1968, including the most recent election in 2016, where 63% of voters voted Republican.\n\n4. Oklahoma\n\nOklahoma is tied for the fourth-most Republican state in the United States. Oklahoma’s voting index is +20. Oklahoma has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1952 except for 1964. In the 2016 presidential election, 65.3% of voters voted Republican vs. 28.9% that voted Democratic. There are only four blue counties in the whole state.\n\n5. Idaho\n\nIdaho is the fifth-most Republican state in the U.S., with a voting index of +18. Generally, people in Idaho are concerned with fiscal issues such as budget deficits and lower government spending, leading to a conservative way of thinking. Idaho has consistently voted Republican in every presidential election since 1952 except for 1964. 59.3% of voters voted Republican in the most recent presidential election in 2016.\n\n6. Arkansas\n\nArkansas is the sixth-most Republican state in the U.S., with a voting index of +16. Arkansas has voted Republican in nine of the last 12 presidential elections except in 1976 for Jimmy Carter and 1992 and 1996 for fellow Arkansan Bill Clinton. In the last four elections, the Republican margin of victory has increased each election. In 2016, Donald Trump won the election with a vote of 60.6%.\n\n7. Kentucky\n\nKentucky is the seventh-most Republican state in the U.S., with a voting index of +16. In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump defeated Hilary Clinton 62.5% to 32.7%. Kentucky has voted Democratic for long periods in the past; however, the state has voted Republican since the 2000 presidential election. In Kentucky’s most recent Governor election, voters chose Democratic candidate Andy Beshear.\n\n8. South Dakota\n\nSouth Dakota is the eighth-most Republican state with a voting index of +16. Since becoming a state in 1889, South Dakota has voted Democratic only four times in presidential elections, the last time being in 1964. In the 2016 presidential election, 61.5% of voters voted Republican.\n\n9. Alabama\n\nThe eighth-most Republican state in the country, Alabama, has a PVI of R+15. Alabama has voted Republican in the last eleven presidential elections, and 62.1% of residents voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election and 62% in the 2020 election.\n\n10. Tennessee\n\nRounding out the top ten most Republican states is Tennessee. With 60.7% voting for the Republican presidential candidate in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, Tennessee is a reliable Republican stronghold. The state has a +14 voting margin and, since 1950, has only voted for a Democratic presidential candidate four times."
