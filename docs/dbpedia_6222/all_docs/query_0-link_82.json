        "text": "1912 As leader of the progressive wing of the Republican party, Theodore Roosevelt had won most of the delegates selected by direct primary, but the old guard conservative Republic machine that controlled the convention was determined to nominate William Howard Taft. Roosevelt withdrew and formed the Progressive party, dubbed the “Bull Moose” party. In the general election, Roosevelt defeated Taft, winning 29 percent of the popular vote to Taft’s 25 percent. But the split of the Republican vote permitted Woodrow Wilson to win with 46 percent of the popular vote. That the Roosevelt third-party candidacy profoundly affected the outcome of the election cannot be doubted, arguably the most influential third-party candidacy in American history. 1924 A “progressive” Republican and founder of the Progressive movement, Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin campaigned for president in 1924 under the banner of the Progressive party. He won the endorsement of the American Federation of Labor and received nearly 5 million votes, 16.6 percent of the total cast."
