Entrenched incumbency has reduced voter participation and has led to an electoral system that is less free, less competitive, and less representative than the system established by the Founding Fathers. Therefore, the people of Arkansas, exercising their reserved powers, herein limit the terms of elected officials.\n\n(a) The Arkansas House of Representatives shall consist of members to be chosen every second year by the qualified electors of the several counties.\n\n(b) The Arkansas Senate shall consist of members to be chosen every four years by the qualified electors of the several districts.\n\n(c)(1) A member of the General Assembly shall serve no more than sixteen (16) years, whether consecutive or nonconsecutive. (2) A member who completes his or her sixteenth year of service during a term of office for which he or she has been elected may serve until the completion of that term of office.\n\n(3) The years of service in both the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be added together and included to determine the total number of years in office.\n\n(4) A partial legislative term served as a result of a special election under Article 5, § 6, or a two-year term served as a result of apportionment of the Senate shall not be included in calculating the total number of years served by a member of the General Assembly.\n\n[As amended by Const.

Legislative Branch.\n\n(a) The Arkansas House of Representatives shall consist of members to be chosen every second year by the qualified electors of the several counties. No member of the Arkansas House of Representatives may serve more than three such two year terms.\n\n(b) The Arkansas Senate shall consist of members to be chosen every four years by the qualified electors of the several districts. No member of the Arkansas Senate may serve more than two such four year terms.\n\nSec. 3. Congressional Delegation.\n\n(a) Any person having been elected to three or more terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Arkansas shall not be certified as a candidate and shall not be eligible to have his/her name placed on the ballot for election to the United States House of Representatives from Arkansas.\n\n(b) Any person having been elected to two or more terms as a member of the United States Senate from Arkansas shall not be certified as a candidate and shall not be eligible to have his/her name placed on the ballot for election to the United States Senate from Arkansas.\n\nSec. 4. Severability.\n\nThe provisions of this Amendment are severable, and if any should be held invalid, the remainder shall stand.\n\nSec. 5. Provisions Self-Executing.\n\nProvisions of this Amendment shall be self-executing.\n\nSec. 6. Application.\n\n(a) This Amendment to the Arkansas Constitution shall take effect and be in operation on January 1, 1993, and its provisions shall be applicable to all person thereafter seeking election to the offices specified in this Amendment.\n\n(b) All laws and constitutional provisions which conflict with this Amendment are hereby repealed to the extent that they conflict with this amendment.\n\n[The Arkansas Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court held Section 3 to be unconstitutional.
