Despite scandals and questions about his character, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton won the nomination through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 1992 Democratic National Convention held from July 13 to July 16, 1992, in New York City. Clinton and Tennessee Senator Al Gore were nominated by the convention for president and vice president, respectively.\n\nClinton and Gore went on to take advantage of the chaos and disarray of the Reagan coalition and win the presidential election, defeating incumbent President George H. W. Bush and becoming the first Democratic nominee since Jimmy Carter to win a presidential election.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nReforms\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough the McGovern–Fraser Commission had recommended proportionality as early as 1972, this primary was the first to adopt the proportional 15% rule, still in place today, as the standard throughout the country. Any candidate receiving greater than 15% of the vote in a given congressional district (or in the case of New Jersey, state legislative district) would receive a proportional share of the apportioned delegates for that district or state.[1]\n\nSchedule and results\n\n[edit]\n\nDate\n\n(daily totals)\n\nTotal pledged\n\ndelegates\n\nContest Delegates won and popular vote Bill Clinton Jerry Brown Paul Tsongas Tom Harkin Bob Kerrey February 10 49 Iowa\n\n(caucus)\n\n76 (2.81%)\n\n51 (1.60%)\n\n128 (4.11%) 49\n\n2,314 (76.55%)\n\n72 (2.41%) February 18 18 New Hampshire 9\n\n41,540 (24.78%)\n\n13,659 (8.15%) 9\n\n55,663 (33.20%)\n\n17,063 (10.18%)\n\n18,584 (11.08%) February 22 22 Maine\n\n(caucus)[2][a] 3\n\n515 (15.13%) 7\n\n994 (30.77%) 8\n\n987 (29.31%) 1\n\n174 (4.99%)\n\n105 (3.01%) February 25 15 South Dakota[3] 3\n\n11,421 (19.10%)\n\n2,304 (3.86%)\n\n5,756 (9.62) 5\n\n15,153 (25.23%) 7\n\n23,974 (40.12%) March 3\n\n(380)\n\n47 Colorado[4] 14\n\n64,470 (26.90%) 18\n\n69,073 (28.82%) 15\n\n61,360 (25.61%)\n\n5,866 (2.45%)\n\n29,572 (12.34%) 76 Georgia[4] 54\n\n259,907 (57.17%)\n\n36,808 (8.10%) 22\n\n109,148 (24.01%)\n\n9,479 (2.09%)\n\n22,033 (4.85%) 18 Idaho\n\n(caucus) (11.56%) (4.57%) (28.76%) (29.57%) – 67 Maryland 29\n\n189,905 (35.76%)\n\n46,480 (8.75%) 38\n\n230,490 (43.40%)\n\n32,899 (6.20%)\n\n27,035 (5.09) 78 Minnesota\n\n(caucus) – – (19.2%) (26.7%) – 23 Utah\n\n(caucus) ?\n\n5.780 (18.27%) ?\n\n8,971 (28.36%) ?\n\n10,582 (33.45%)\n\n1,274 (4.03%)\n\n3,447 (10.90%) 71 Washington\n\n(caucus)\n\n561 (13.82%) ?\n\n784 (19.32%) ?\n\n1,299 (32.01%)\n\n305 (7.52%)\n\n249 (6.14%) March 7 41 Arizona\n\n(caucus)\n\n10,607 (29.20%)\n\n9,990 (27.50%) ?\n\n12,496 (34.40%)\n\n2,761 (7.60%) – 43 South Carolina ?\n\n73,221 (62.90%)\n\n6,961 (5.98%) ?\n\n21,338 (18.33%)\n\n7,657 (6.58%)\n\n566 (0.49%) 13 Wyoming\n\n(caucus) ?\n\n78 (28.57%) ?\n\n63 (23.08%)\n\n32 (11.72%)\n\n39 (14.29%) – March 8 17 Nevada\n\n(caucus) ?\n\n355 (26.47%) ?\n\n467 (34.83%)\n\n264 (19.69%)\n\n6 (0.45%) 13 (0.97%) March 10\n\n(Super Tuesday)\n\n(777) 14 Delaware\n\n(caucus) ?\n\n520 (20.78%) ?\n\n488 (19.50%) ?\n\n755 (30.16%) – – 148 Florida ?\n\n554,861 (50.79%)\n\n133,156 (12.19%) ?\n\n379,572 (34.75%)\n\n13,302 (1.22%)\n\n11,557 (1.06%) 14 Hawaii\n\n(caucus) ?\n\n1,552 (51.49%)\n\n410 (13.60%)\n\n431 (14.30%)\n\n383 (12.71%)\n\n12 (0.40%) 60 Louisiana ?\n\n267,029 (69.46%)\n\n25,480 (6.63%)\n\n42,509 (11.06%)\n\n4,033 (1.05%)\n\n2,984 (0.78%) 94 Massachusetts\n\n86,817 (10.95%)\n\n115,746 (14.60%) ?\n\n526,297 (66.38%)\n\n3,764 (0.48%)\n\n5,409 (0.68%) 39 Mississippi ?\n\n139,893 (73.11%)\n\n18,396 (9.61%)\n\n15,538 (8.12%)\n\n2,509 (1.31%)\n\n1,660 (0.87%) 77 Missouri ?\n\n10,148 (45.10%)\n\n1,282 (5.70%)\n\n2,295 (10.20%) – – 45 Oklahoma ?\n\n293,266 (70.47%) ?\n\n69,624 (16.69%) –\n\n14,015 (3.40%)\n\n13,252 (3.20%) 22 Rhode Island ?\n\n10,762 (21.22%) ?\n\n9,541 (18.82%) ?\n\n26,825 (52.90%)\n\n319 (0.63%)\n\n469 (0.92%) 68 Tennessee ?\n\n214,485 (67.35%)\n\n25,560 (8.02%) ?\n\n61,717 (19.38%)\n\n2,099 (0.66%)\n\n1,638 (0.51%) 196 Texas ?\n\n972,235 (65.56%)\n\n118,869 (8.02%) ?\n\n285,224 (19.23%)\n\n19,618 (1.32%)\n\n20,298 (1.37%) March 17\n\n(295)\n\n164 Illinois ?\n\n776,829 (51.65%)\n\n220,346 (14.65%) ?\n\n387,891 (25.79%)\n\n30,710 (2.04%)\n\n10,916 (0.73%) 131 Michigan ?\n\n297,280 (50.73%) ?\n\n97,017 (16.56%) ?\n\n151,400 (25.84%)\n\n6,265 (1.07%)\n\n3,219 (0.55%) March 19 ?

W. Bush's approval ratings were high. At one point after the successful performance by U.S. forces in Kuwait, President Bush had an 89% approval rating.[14]\n\nAs a result of Bush's high popularity, major high-profile Democratic candidates feared a high likelihood of defeat in the 1992 general election. This fear was \"captured perfectly by Saturday Night Live in a skit called 'Campaign '92: The Race to Avoid Being the Guy Who Loses to Bush,'\" in which each prospective major candidate \"tried to top the other in explaining why they were unfit to run\" for the presidency.[15][16][17]\n\nMario Cuomo and Jesse Jackson declined to seek the Democratic nomination for president, as did U.S. Senator and eventual Vice President Al Gore, whose son had been struck by a car and was undergoing extensive surgery and physical therapy.[18] However, Governors Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown and U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas opted to run for president.\n\nNominee\n\n[edit]\n\nCandidate Most recent office Home state Campaign\n\nWithdrawal date\n\nPopular\n\nvote\n\nContests won Running mate Bill Clinton Governor of Arkansas\n\n(1979–1981, 1983–1992)\n\nArkansas\n\n(Campaign • Positions)\n\nSecured nomination: June 2, 1992 10,482,411\n\n(52.01%) 37\n\nNY, NJ, PA, OH, WV, VA, NC, SC, GA, FL, MI, WI, IL, IN, KY, TN, AL, MS, LA, AR, NE, KS, OK, TX, NM, WY, MT, OR, CA, HI, DC, PR Al Gore\n\nWithdrew during primaries or convention\n\n[edit]\n\nCandidate Most recent office Home state Campaign\n\nWithdrawal date\n\nPopular vote Contests won Jerry Brown Governor of California\n\n(1975–1983, 2011–2019)\n\nCalifornia\n\nWithdrew at convention\n\n4,071,232\n\n(20.20%) 6\n\nAK, CO, CT, ME, NV, VT Paul Tsongas U.S. Senator\n\nfrom Massachusetts\n\n(1979–1985)\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWithdrew: March 19 3,656,010\n\n(18.14%) 9\n\nAZ, DA, DE, MD, MA, NH, RI, UT, WA Bob Kerrey U.S. Senator\n\nfrom Nebraska\n\n(1989–2001)\n\nNebraska\n\nWithdrew: March 5 318,457\n\n(1.58%) 1\n\nSD Tom Harkin U.S. Senator\n\nfrom Iowa\n\n(1985–2015)\n\nIowa\n\n(Campaign)\n\nWithdrew: March 9 280,304\n\n(1.39%) 3\n\nID caucus, IA, MN caucus\n\nOther notable individuals campaigning for the nomination but receiving less than 1% of the national vote included:\n\nActivist and conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche\n\nActor Tom Laughlin\n\nFormer Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota\n\nFormer Mayor of Irvine, California Larry Agran\n\nDeclined\n\n[edit]\n\nSenator and 1988 vice-presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen of Texas\n\nSenator Joe Biden of Delaware\n\nFormer vice president and 1984 presidential nominee Walter Mondale of Minnesota\n\nSenator Bill Bradley of New Jersey\n\nSenator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas\n\nGovernor Mario Cuomo of New York\n\nFormer governor and 1988 presidential nominee Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts\n\nHouse Majority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri\n\nSenator Al Gore of Tennessee\n\nReverend Jesse Jackson of the District of Columbia[19]\n\nFormer senator and 1972 presidential nominee George McGovern of South Dakota\n\nSenator Sam Nunn of Georgia\n\nSenator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia\n\nGovernor Ann Richards of Texas\n\nFormer senator Pierre Salinger of California\n\nPolling\n\n[edit]\n\nNationwide\n\n[edit]\n\nPoll source Publication\n\nJerry Brown\n\nBill Clinton\n\nTom Harkin\n\nBob Kerrey\n\nPaul Tsongas\n\nOther\n\nUndecided\n\nGallup[20] Sep. 1991 21% 6% 6% 5% 5% ? — Gallup[20] Nov. 1991 21% 9% 10% 10% 7% ? — Gallup[20] Jan. 1992 21% 17% 9% 11% 6% ? — New York Times/CBS News[21] Jan. 1992 ? 22% ? ? 10% ? — Gallup[20] Feb. 2, 1992 21% 42% 9% 10% 9% ? — New York Times/CBS News[21] Feb. 22, 1992 10% 29% 3% 4% 24% 4%[b] 26%\n\nState polling\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n[edit]\n\nPoll source Publication Sample size MoE\n\nJerry Brown\n\nBill Clinton\n\nMario Cuomo\n\nTom Harkin\n\nBob Kerrey\n\nPaul Tsongas\n\nOther\n\nUndecided\n\nUSA Today–CNN–Gallup[22] Feb. 12–14 600 V ±5% 6% 23% – 14% 10% 39% – 8% Boston Globe–WBZ-TV[22] Feb. 13–14 400 LV ±5% 5% 25% 4% 11% 11% 32% 4% 8% Mason-Dixon[22] Feb. 13–15 433 V ±5% 4% 21% 4% 9% 8% 34% – 20%\n\nPrimary race\n\n[edit]\n\nClinton, a Southerner with experience governing a more conservative state, positioned himself as a centrist New Democrat. He prepared for a run in 1992 amidst a crowded field seeking to beat the incumbent President George H. W. Bush. In the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, Bush seemed unbeatable, but an economic recession—which ultimately proved to be small by historical standards—spurred the Democrats on. Tom Harkin won his native Iowa without much surprise. Clinton, meanwhile, was still a relatively unknown national candidate before the primary season when a woman named Gennifer Flowers appeared in the press to reveal allegations of an affair.[23] Clinton sought damage control by appearing on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary Clinton, for an interview with Steve Kroft. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts won the primary in neighboring New Hampshire but Clinton's second-place finish – strengthened by Clinton's speech labeling himself \"The Comeback Kid\" – re-energized his campaign. Clinton swept nearly all of the Southern Super Tuesday primaries, making him the solid front runner. Jerry Brown, however, began to run a surprising insurgent campaign, particularly through use of a 1-800 number to receive grassroots funding. Brown \"seemed to be the most left-wing and right-wing man in the field. [He] called for term limits, a flat tax, and the abolition of the Department of Education.\"[24] Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut and Colorado.\n\nOn March 17, Tsongas left the race when he decisively lost both the Illinois and Michigan primaries to Clinton, with Brown as a distant third. Exactly one week later, Brown eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought Connecticut primary. As the press focused on the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a serious gaffe: he announced to an audience of various leaders of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider the Reverend Jesse Jackson as a vice presidential candidate. Jackson was still a controversial figure in that community and Brown's polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Clinton in Wisconsin (37–34), and dramatically in New York (41–26). In addition, his \"willingness to break with liberal orthodoxy on taxes led to denunciations from the party regulars, but by the end of the race he had been embraced by much of the Left.\"[24]\n\nAlthough Brown continued to campaign in a number of states, he won no further primaries. Despite this, he still had a sizable number of delegates, and a big win in his home state of California would have deprived Clinton of sufficient support to win the nomination. After nearly a month of intense campaigning and multiple debates between the two candidates, Clinton managed to defeat Brown in the California primary by a margin of 47% to 40%. Clinton became the second candidate after George McGovern in 1972 to win the nomination without winning Iowa or New Hampshire. The same feat would be repeated nearly 30 years later by Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nThe convention\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 1992 Democratic National Convention\n\nThe convention met in New York City, and the official tally was:\n\nBill Clinton 3,372\n\nJerry Brown 596\n\nPaul Tsongas 209\n\nPenn. Gov. Robert P. Casey 10\n\nRep. Pat Schroeder 8\n\nLarry Agran 3\n\nRon Daniels 1\n\nAl Gore 1\n\nJoe Simonetta 1\n\nClinton chose U.S. Senator Albert A. Gore Jr. (D-Tennessee) to be his running mate on July 9, 1992. Choosing Gore, who is from Clinton's neighboring state of Tennessee, went against the popular strategy of balancing a Southern candidate with a Northern partner. Gore did serve to balance the ticket in other ways, as he was perceived as strong on foreign policy and environmental issues, while Clinton was not.[25] Also, Gore's similarities to Clinton allowed him to push some of his key campaign themes, such as centrism and generational change.[26]\n\nBefore Gore's selection, other politicians were mentioned as a possible running-mate, e.g. Bob Kerrey, Dick Gephardt, Mario Cuomo, Indiana Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Pennsylvania Senator Harris Wofford, Florida Senator Bob Graham, and Massachusetts Senator John Kerry.\n\nThe Democratic Convention in New York City was essentially a solidification of the party around Clinton and Gore, though there was controversy over whether Jerry Brown, who did not endorse Clinton, would be allowed to speak. Brown did speak at the convention by seconding his own nomination.\n\nAnother additional controversy concerned Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey, who sought a speaking slot at the convention but was not granted one. Casey complained that it was because of his outspoken anti-abortion views: he had warned the platform committee that Democrats were committing political suicide because of their support for abortion rights.[27] Clinton supporters have said that Casey was not allowed to speak because he had not endorsed the ticket.[28]\n\nPopular vote results\n\n[edit]\n\nTotal popular vote number in primaries:[29]\n\nBill Clinton - 10,482,411 (52.01%)\n\nJerry Brown - 4,071,232 (20.20%)\n\nPaul Tsongas - 3,656,010 (18.14%)\n\nUnpledged - 750,873 (3.73%)\n\nBob Kerrey - 318,457 (1.58%)\n\nTom Harkin - 280,304 (1.39%)\n\nLyndon LaRouche - 154,599 (0.77%)\n\nEugene McCarthy - 108,678 (0.54%)\n\nCharles Woods - 88,948 (0.44%)\n\nLarry Agran - 58,611 (0.29%)\n\nRoss Perot - 54,755 (0.27%)\n\nRalph Nader - 35,935 (0.18%)\n\nLouis Stokes - 29,983 (0.15%)\n\nAngus Wheeler McDonald - 9,900 (0.05%)\n\nJ.
