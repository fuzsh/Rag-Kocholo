        "text": "The 1992 United States presidential election in Montana was held on November 3, 1992, as part of the 1992 United States presidential election. Voters chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\n\nMontana was won by Governor Bill Clinton (D-Arkansas) with a 37.63% plurality of the popular vote over incumbent President George H. W. Bush's (R-Texas) 35.12%, and businessman Ross Perot's (I-Texas) 26.12%.[3][4] As of 2020, this is the last time Montana voted for the Democratic candidate and is currently the only time a Democratic presidential nominee has carried the state since 1964, setting it apart from its neighboring states (Wyoming, Idaho, North Dakota, and South Dakota), all of which have maintained their Republican streak since 1964. Similarly, this marks the second of two times that Montana has voted for a different candidate than neighboring Idaho, the first being 1892, both states' first election since statehood. This was also one of eight states where Perot earned over 25 percent of the vote."
