They lead for positive change in our communities and nations.\n\nOur world is in urgent need of those skills.\n\nFord School MPP and MPA alumni come from diverse academic and professional backgrounds. And they go on to lead nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and in the private sector. Some hold political office, or they advise policymakers on strategy and policy, and others passionately advocate for issues they care about.\n\nOur Bachelor of Arts in public policy graduates go on to a diverse array of careersâ€”on Capitol Hill, in classrooms, at hospitals, nonprofits, consulting practices, and law firms. They include the chief of staff for a Member of Congress, an assistant attorney general, and a judge."
