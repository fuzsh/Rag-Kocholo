        "text": "Award Description | Presentation | Nomination Criteria and Process | Prior Recipients\n\nAward Description\n\nThe James R. Gillette Award is presented each year for two outstanding papers published in Drug Metabolism and Disposition, one each in the broad categories of a) Drug Metabolism and b) Disposition and Pharmacokinetics.\n\nPresentation\n\nThe award is presented annually. The award consists of:\n\nInvitation to the first author to present the work at a platform session at the annual meeting\n\nTravel support and complimentary registration at the annual meeting\n\nCash award of $250 for the first author\n\nNomination Criteria and Process\n\nAll manuscripts published in Drug Metabolism and Disposition (DMD) in a given calendar year are eligible. After the last issue of the year has closed, the DMD editor provides a list of the nominated manuscripts to the Drug Metabolism and Disposition Division.\n\nSelections are made based on the primary review of the manuscript for publication, followed by a secondary review by the James R. Gillette Best Paper Award Committee. The Award Committee consists of members of the executive committee, is chaired by the Division for Drug Metabolism and Disposition’s Past-Chair, and may include outside expertise as necessary. Award winners are selected at the end of the calendar year, and notified in January or February. Current division chairs and secretary/treasurers and the ASPET Council president and secretary/treasurer are ineligible for division awards during their active tenure.\n\nAward Recipients\n\n2023\n\nMetabolism category: Asami Toshima, Pharmacokinetic Research Laboratories, Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd, for the paper titled \"Comprehensive Analyses of the Intracellular and in Vivo Disposition of Fab–Small Interfering RNA Conjugate to Identify Key Issues to Improve Its in Vivo Activity.”\n\nPharmacokinetics/Drug Transporters category: Yueping Zhang, Bristol-Myers Squibb, for the paper titled \"Metabolomic Profiling and Drug Interaction Characterization Reveal Riboflavin as a Breast Cancer Resistance Protein–Specific Endogenous Biomarker That Demonstrates Prediction of Transporter Activity In Vivo.\"\n\n2022\n\nMetabolism category: Kazuyoshi Michiba from the Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacokinetics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo for the paper titled \"Usefulness of human jejunal spheroid-derived differentiated intestinal epithelial cells for the prediction of intestinal drug absorption in humans.\"\n\nPharmacokinetics/Drug Transporters category: Daniel Rizzolo from the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers University for the paper titled “Effects of Overexpression of Fibroblast Growth Factor 15/19 on Hepatic Drug Metabolizing Enzymes.\"\n\n2021\n\nMetabolism category: Co-first authors Shida Qiao from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Sisi Feng from Shanghai Hexaell Biotech Co., Ltd. for the paper titled “Functional Proliferating Human Hepatocytes: In Vitro Hepatocyte Model for Drug Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity.”\n\nPharmacokinetics/Drug Transporters category: Sara Shum from the University of Washington for the paper titled \"Predicting Maternal-Fetal Disposition of Fentanyl Following Intravenous and Epidural Administration Using Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling\"\n\n2020\n\nMetabolism category: Bridget L.
