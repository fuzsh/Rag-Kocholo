        "text": "Molly Buckley is a Legal Fellow* on EFF’s civil liberties team, where she works on free speech, privacy, transparency, and surveillance issues. During law school, Molly worked as an intern at EFF and at the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security program, and on disability and workers’ rights issues as a student attorney in UT’s Advanced Civil Rights and Transnational Workers’ Rights Clinics. She was also Vice President of the Human Rights Law Society and a National Security Law Fellow with the Strauss Center for International Security and Law. Previously, Molly was a paralegal in the ACLU’s National Security Project, an elected bargaining representative of the ACLU Support Staff Union, and program assistant to the Social Science Research Council’s Anxieties of Democracy program. Molly holds a J.D. from the University of Texas School of Law and a B.A. in media studies and political science from Vassar College. In spare time she loves playing music and gardening.\n\n*Seeking admission—not licensed to practice.\n\nBill Budington is a longtime activist, cryptography enthusiast, and a Senior Staff Technologist on EFF's Public Interest Technology team. His research has been featured in The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, and cited by the U.S. Congress. He is the lead developer of Cover Your Tracks, apkeep, led HTTPS Everywhere from 2015 to 2018, and has contributed to projects like Let's Encrypt and SecureDrop. Bill has spoken at USENIX Enigma (2016), HOPE (2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2024), DEF CON (2023), CCC (2017), InfoSec Southwest (2017), ShmooCon (2019, 2020), and other infosec conferences. Bill's primary interest lies in dismantling systems of oppression, building up collaborative alternatives and, to borrow a phrase from Zapatismo, fighting for a 'world in which many worlds fit.' He loves hacker spaces and getting together with other techies to tinker, code, share, and build the technological commons.\n\nCindy Cohn is the Executive Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. From 2000-2015 she served as EFF’s Legal Director as well as its General Counsel. Ms. Cohn first became involved with EFF in 1993, when EFF asked her to serve as the outside lead attorney in Bernstein v. Dept. of Justice, the successful First Amendment challenge to the U.S. export restrictions on cryptography.\n\nMs. Cohn has been named to TheNonProfitTimes 2020 Power & Influence TOP 50 list, honoring 2020's movers and shakers. In 2018, Forbes included Ms. Cohn as one of America's Top 50 Women in Tech. The National Law Journal named Ms. Cohn one of 100 most influential lawyers in America in 2013, noting: \"[I]f Big Brother is watching, he better look out for Cindy Cohn.\" She was also named in 2006 for \"rushing to the barricades wherever freedom and civil liberties are at stake online.\" In 2007 the National Law Journal named her one of the 50 most influential women lawyers in America. In 2010 the Intellectual Property Section of the State Bar of California awarded her its Intellectual Property Vanguard Award and in 2012 the Northern California Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists awarded her the James Madison Freedom of Information Award.\n\nSophia Cope is a Senior Staff Attorney on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's civil liberties team, working on a variety of free speech and privacy issues. Key topics include border searches of electronic devices, surveillance and human rights, the right to record the police, Section 230, and student speech and student privacy online. She has been a civil liberties attorney for two decades and has experience in both litigation and policy advocacy. Her writing has appeared in the New York Times, Guardian, Slate, and Huffington Post.\n\nPrior to joining EFF, Sophia spent eight years in Washington, D.C. She worked at the Newspaper Association of America (now the News Media Alliance) on freedom of the press and digital media issues, with a focus on protecting journalists' confidential sources. She advocated for a federal shield law, a warrant-for-content requirement under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and improvements to the Freedom of Information Act. She also wrote a chapter for a book published by the American Bar Association entitled \"Whistleblowers, Leaks and the Media: The First Amendment and National Security\" and spoke out against NSA surveillance.\n\nPrior to NAA, Sophia worked at the Center for Democracy & Technology on a variety of civil liberties and human rights issues related to the Internet and technology, including the regulation of content on the Internet and broadcast television, and the privacy implications of government identification programs. She also worked on the development and launch of the Global Network Initiative.\n\nBefore moving to Washington, D.C., Sophia litigated at the First Amendment Project in Oakland, California, where she defended an environmental activist against a frivolous lawsuit and a video journalist against a federal subpoena seeking his unpublished footage. She also counseled clients on how to obtain greater access to public records and public meetings.\n\nSophia was an adjunct professor of media law for nearly four years, teaching Washington, D.C.-area undergraduate communication and journalism students. She is on the boards of the Public Participation Project and Open Vallejo. She is a graduate of Santa Clara University and University of California College of the Law, San Francisco (UC Law SF, formerly UC Hastings). She is proud to be a native Californian.\n\nLisa Femia is a Staff Attorney on EFF’s civil liberties team. Her work focuses on surveillance, privacy, free speech, and the impact of technology on civil rights and civil liberties. Lisa came to EFF from Hogan Lovells US LLP, where she maintained a robust pro bono practice centered on democracy reform, criminal justice, and civil rights. Prior to joining Hogan, Lisa worked on privacy and government surveillance issues as a clinic student and post-graduate intern at the Brennan Center for Justice. Lisa additionally served as an NYU International Law and Human Rights Fellow while in law school. In that role, she advocated for press freedom and media rights in Kampala, Uganda.\n\nPrior to law school, Lisa worked as the government relations manager of a national nonprofit foundation in Washington, D.C. Lisa holds a J.D. from New York University School of Law and a bachelor's degree from Princeton University.\n\n*Admitted in New York and Washington, D.C., only; not admitted in California\n\nEva Galperin is EFF's Director of Cybersecurity.
