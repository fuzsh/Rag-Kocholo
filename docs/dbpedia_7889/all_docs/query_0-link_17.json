        "text": "China's top political advisory body concluded its plenary session on Wednesday in Beijing, expelling a senior Hong Kong lawmaker for remarks against HK's Leung Chun-ying.\n\nJames Tien Pei-chun was voted out of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) for his public remarks against HK Chief Executive and the HK government's governing in line with law, the Standing Committee of the 12th CPPCC National Committee said in a statement released after its eighth session.\n\nTien's behavior has seriously violated the constitution of the CPPCC, the statement added.\n\nPolitical advisors voiced their support for the decision on comprehensively advancing the rule of law which was adopted at the fourth plenary session of the 18th Communist Party of China Central Committee on October 23.\n\nThe decision which outlines a blueprint of governing the country according to law, has shown the Party's resolution to build a socialist country under the rule of law, said the political advisors at the session.\n\nPolitical advisors from non-CPC parties put forward their suggestion concerning the reform of legal system, establishing law-abiding government and giving full play to lawyers in promoting rule of law.\n\nYu Zhengsheng, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, called on participants to learn the fourth plenary session spirit of law and make contributions to the country's promotion of rule of law."
