        "text": "Bruce Lee\n\nBruce Lee would’ve celebrated his 78th birthday on November 27, 2018. The martial arts expert completed only a handful of films before his untimely death in 1973 at the age of 32. But how many of those titles are classics? In honor of his birthday, let’s take a look back at all 6 of his films, ranked worst to best.\n\nBorn in the Chinatown neighborhood of San Francisco, CA, in 1940, Lee was raised with his family in Kowloon, Hong Kong. He began appearing in several films as a child, often in small bit roles, but abandoned acting to pursue a career in martial arts.\n\nHis hiatus from the screen didn’t last long. In 1966, Lee was cast as Kato in the short-lived television adventure “The Green Hornet,” later making appearances as the character on “Batman.” He played a small role in the mystery film “Marlowe” (1969) as a kung fu fighter who destroys private eye James Garner’s office before suffering a tragic demise.\n\nLee became a leading man after returning to Hong Kong to make “The Big Boss” (1971). It was the first in a series of martial arts films the actor would headline, including “Fist of Fury” (1972), “The Way of the Dragon” (1973), and the posthumously released “Game of Death” (1978).\n\nHollywood came calling once again with “Enter the Dragon” (1973), a big budget spectacular that could have launched the actor to superstardom had he not died from cerebral edema three weeks before it opened. (In a sad irony, Lee’s son, Brandon, died in 1993 at the age of 28 while filming “The Crow” when an improperly loaded prop gun misfired.)\n\nTour our gallery of Bruce Lee movies, and see if your favorite topped the list."
