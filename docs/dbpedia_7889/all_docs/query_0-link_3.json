        "text": "Outgoing Legco president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing, who had earlier cast doubt on Chow’s claims, called for more clarity.\n\n“It’s hard to comment on it,” the veteran pro-establishment politician said. “People involved should come clean on the whole truth, and then we can analyse what were the illegal acts. If people only talk about part of what happened, there will be speculations and negative effects.”\n\nTien said he did not follow the instructions by the unnamed liaison office representatives, quoting them as saying Chow’s bid could hurt the chances of Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, who ended up winning the ninth and final seat in New Territories West.\n\n“Beijing needs to find out if the office has gone beyond its liaison role and become an executive department in Hong Kong ... The credibility of Hong Kong elections is at stake,” Tien said.\n\nDespite his combative stance, it is understood that Beijing still regards the Liberals as allies, and the party itself rarely criticises the central government.\n\nLau Siu-kai, vice-chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said the party’s ties with Beijing were unlikely to worsen over the latest drama, as the Liberals were not accusing the central government of meddling in the city’s affairs.\n\n“The Liberals have four lawmakers in the coming Legco term; they can still play a critical role in the Beijing-loyalist camp,” Lau said.\n\nHe suggested Beijing should look into Chow’s complaints, but he found Tien’s claims to be less problematic. “In Beijing’s eyes, it’s not meddling with Hong Kong affairs to talk to [the pro-establishment] camp on electoral strategies,” he said, explaining that the central government considered such communication necessary for strengthening the camp.\n\nLiberal Party honorary chairwoman Miriam Lau Kin-yee did not seem worried about their ties with Beijing. “There were often such discussions about electoral strategies, so I cannot rule out what Tien said,” she said.\n\nShe and fellow chairwoman Selina Chow Liang Shuk-yee have already written to state leaders Zhang Dejiang and Yu Zhengsheng, urging them to look into Chow’s case.\n\nTien dropped his political bombshell during a Commercial Radio show in the morning when asked to comment on Chow’s claims: “Officials from the liaison office also talked to me in the course of the summer. They said I should ask Chow to quit because he could not win, but I said: ‘How do you know?’\n\nChow told the Post he was unaware the liaison office had approached Tien.\n\nDemocratic Party lawmaker James To Kun-sun cited the Basic Law in stating that mainland authorities should not meddle in Hong Kong affairs, including elections.\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: ‘Bad boy’ Tien adds fuel to political fire‘Bad boy’ Tien adds fuel to political fire"
