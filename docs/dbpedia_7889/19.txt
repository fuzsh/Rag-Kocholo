BEIJING - Hong Kong politician James Tien Pei-chun was voted out of China's top political advisory body on Wednesday for improper remarks.

James Tien was deaf to persuasion and made public remarks against HK Chief Executive and the HK government's governing in line with law, which has seriously violated the constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), according to a statement released after a CPPCC Standing Committee meeting.
