        "text": "Key Points\n\nNorwegian author Jon Fosse has said he is \"overwhelmed and grateful\" after receiving the Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nThe Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, said his \"innovative plays and prose ... give voice to the unsayable\".\n\nFosse is the fourth Norwegian writer to be awarded the Nobel.\n\nNorwegian author Jon Fosse, whose sprawling body of work ranging from plays to novels and children's books, has won the Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nAnders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel Literature Committee, said Fosse's work was rooted \"in the language and nature of his Norwegian background\".\n\n\"I am overwhelmed and grateful,\" Fosse, 64, said in a statement released by his publishing house, Samlaget.\n\n\"I see this as an award to the literature that first and foremost aims to be literature, without other considerations.\"\n\nOne of his country's most-performed dramatists, Fosse has written some 40 plays as well as novels, short stories, children's books, poetry and essays.\n\nThe Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, said it was \"for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable\".\n\nMats Malm, permanent secretary of the academy, reached Fosse by telephone to inform him of the win.\n\nHe said the writer was driving in the countryside and promised to drive home carefully.\n\nFosse is the fourth Norwegian writer to be awarded the Nobel.\n\nBjørnstjerne Bjørnson received it in 1903, Knut Hamsun was awarded it in 1920 and Sigrid Undset in 1928.\n\nFosse's work A New Name: Septology VI-VII - described by Olsson as Fosse's \"magnum opus\" - was a finalist for the International Booker Prize in 2022.\n\nJon Fosse poses for a photo in Stockholm in 2021. Source: AP / Jessica Gow\n\nAnders Olsson, chair of the Nobel Literature Committee, said Fosse's work was rooted \"in the language and nature of his Norwegian background\".\n\nThe Nobel Prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.6 million) from a bequest left by their creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.\n\nWinners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma at the award ceremonies in December.\n\nFosse joins an illustrious list of past winners that ranges from Toni Morrison to Ernest Hemingway and Jean-Paul Sartre - who turned down the prize in 1964.\n\nLast year, French author Annie Ernaux won the prize for what the prize-giving Swedish Academy called \"the courage and clinical acuity\" of books rooted in her small-town background in the Normandy region of northwest France.\n\nErnaux was just the 17th woman among the 119 Nobel literature laureates.\n\nThe literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too focused on European and North American writers, as well as too male-dominated.\n\nIn 2018, the award was postponed after sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy, which names the Nobel Literature Committee, and sparked an exodus of members.\n\nThe academy revamped itself but faced more criticism for giving the 2019 award to Austria's Peter Handke, who has been called an apologist for Serbian war crimes.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nNobel Prize awarded to scientists whose work enabled mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\n\nOn Wednesday, the chemistry prize was awarded to Moungi Bawendi of MIT, Louis Brus of Columbia University, and Alexei Ekimov of Nanocrystals Technology Inc.\n\nThey were honoured for their work with tiny particles called quantum dots - which can release very bright-coloured light and whose applications in everyday life include electronics and medical imaging.\n\nHungarian-American Katalin Karikó and American Drew Weissman won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.\n\nOn Tuesday, the physics prize went to French-Swedish physicist Anne L'Huillier, French scientist Pierre Agostini and Hungarian-born Ferenc Krausz for producing the first split-second glimpse into the super-fast world of spinning electrons.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is awarded on Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences ends the awards season on Monday."
