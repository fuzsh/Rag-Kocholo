        "text": "Norweigian writer Jon Fosse has been named the recipient of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable.\"\n\nThe 11 million Swedish kronor (approx. $1.4 million Cdn) prize which has been given out since 1901, recognizes authors who have \"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.\"\n\nOne of his country's most-performed dramatists, Fosse, 64, has written some 40 plays as well as novels, short stories, children's books, poetry and essays.\n\nAnders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel literature committee, said Fosse's work is rooted \"in the language and nature of his Norwegian background.\"\n\nMats Malm, permanent secretary of the academy who announced the prize, reached Fosse by telephone to inform him of the win. He said the writer was driving in the countryside and promised to drive home carefully.\n\nFosse is the fourth Norwegian writer to get the Nobel. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson got it in 1903, Knut Hamsun was awarded it in 1920 and Sigrid Undset in 1928.\n\nHis work \"A New Name: Septology VI-VII\" — described by Olsson as Fosse's \"magnum opus\" — was a finalist for the International Booker Prize in 2022.\n\nBorn on a small farm in the Hardanger region of Norway, Fosse has been a full-time writer for most of his adult life. He also worked as a journalist, a teacher at the Academy of Writing in Hordaland and a literary consultant.\n\nHis first novel, Raudt, svart, published in English as Red, Black, was released in 1983. After that, he continued to publish poems, prose and children's books. His breakthrough novel, however, was the 1989 Naustet, published in English as Boathouse.\n\nFosse then turned to drama, writing his first play, Nokon kjem til å kome, in 1992. Since then, he's written more than 30 plays that have been preformed both locally and internationally as well as Septology, a seven-volume work that has garnered critical acclaim.\n\nHis writing style is characterized by its musicality, inner monologues and repetition.\n\n74 works of Canadian fiction to read in fall 2023\n\nLast year's Nobel prize winner in literature was French writer Anne Ernaux.\n\nTwo Canadians have won the prize in the past: Saul Bellow (a Canadian-born American) in 1976 and Alice Munro in 2013.\n\n80 things to know about master short story writer Alice Munro\n\nOther past winners include American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, Russian historian and essayist Svetlana Alexievich, Irish poet Seamus Heaney and American novelist Toni Morrison.\n\nWATCH | The 2023 Nobel Prize in Literature announcement:\n\nOther Nobel Prizes awarded this week\n\nNobel prizes are also given for chemistry, physics, medicine, peace and economic science.\n\nScientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the prize in physiology or medicine for discoveries that enabled the development of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.\n\nThe physics prize was awarded to French-Swedish physicist Anne L'Huillier, French scientist Pierre Agostini and Hungarian-born Ferenc Krausz for their work with the tiny part of each atom that races around the centre.\n\nAnne L'Huillier is only the fifth woman to win the physics prize.\n\nScientists Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Alexi Ekimov won the chemistry prize for their work on quantum dots. Their win was leaked before the announcement.\n\nThe peace prize recipient will be revealed on Friday, Oct. 6. The economic sciences prize winner will be announced on Oct. 9."
