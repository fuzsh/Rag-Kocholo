In 1903 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nIn 1901, Bjørnson proclaimed, \"I'm a Pan-Germanist, I'm a Teuton, and the greatest dream of my life is for the South Germanic peoples and the North Germanic peoples and their brothers in diaspora to unite in a fellow confederation.\"\n\nBjørnson had done as much as any other man to rouse Norwegian nationalistic feeling, but in 1903, on the verge of the rupture between Norway and Sweden, he preached conciliation and moderation to the Norwegians. However, in 1905 he largely remained silent.\n\nWhen Norway was attempting to dissolve the forced union with Sweden, Bjørnson sent a telegram to the Norwegian Prime minister stating, \"Now is the time to unite.\" The minister replied, \"Now is the time to shut up.\"\n\nThis was in fact a satirical illustration published in Vikingen, but the story got so popular and widespread that Bjørnson had to deny it, claiming that \"Michelsen has never asked me to shut up; it would not help if he did\".\n\nHe died on 26 April 1910 in Paris, where for some years he had spent his winters, and was buried at home with every mark of honour. The Norwegian coastal defence ship HNoMS Norge was sent to convey his remains back to his own land.\n\nLeaderboard\n\nIanto0:16\n\nspotto0:18\n\nNinja20230:18\n\npedro11110:20\n\nBigR0:22\n\nsteve59110:23\n\ngizi050:25\n\nMarrufo10:25\n\nJennyG660:27\n\nVolltar0:29"
