        "text": "September 8, 2015\n\nThis is a truly moving short story. I've arranged my thoughts into a haiku, but I can't do it justice:\n\n\"The course of one's life,\n\nDenoted by what he gives\n\nIn paternal grief.\"\n\nAugust 17, 2016\n\nThis is a lovely short story. About a father and how he raised his son seen through the eyes of another. I liked reading it. There's something incredibly lonely about this tale. 3 stars.\n\nFebruary 5, 2017\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nThe Father is a touching and sad tale of a man's life with his son through the eyes of the priest as they pass each milestone in the son's life.\n\nShort and to the point, this well written tale jumps from one milestone to the next, the changes in each space apparent from what is happening in the moment. It's a story meant to remind one truly of what matters in life, as well as to show how each milestone impacts the father's views of money and spirituality. The translation is very clearly done, although I am uncertain of who translated this particular edition.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone looking for a sad and touching story to read in a short span of time.\n\nMarch 29, 2018\n\nNovellen \"Fadern\" är skriven av Björnstjerne Björnson som med några sidor lyckades väcka nyfikenhet hos mig för att tolka det som står mellan raderna. Författaren tar oss på en resa i en fars live från det ögonblicket han fått ett barn tills barnet dör och hur olika omständigheter kan påverka oss.\n\nFörfattaren beskriver hur faderns utseende inte har ändrats genom åren på grund av glädje, medan under ett år av sorg blev han gammal och prästen kände inte honom. Dessutom förmedlar författaren oss att pengar inte kan ge oss glädje.\n\nJag tycker att novellen är mycket gripande och mycket välskriven därför att den väcker olika känslor i läsaren bland annat nyfikenhet,lycka, kärlek och sorg\n\nSeptember 20, 2018\n\nIt is a rather tragic tale of a father who thinks that he has completely his responsibilities to his son, and is quite mistaken in the end.\n\nJanuary 4, 2022\n\nA terrific short story that I read and re-read at least a dozen times and ultimately ended up narrating/sharing on my podcast.\n\nIt left me thinking a lot about the meaning behind the story, was it a beautiful story of a father's love for his son, a tale of grief, or a tale of regrets.\n\nEither way, it's a quick read but one that was enjoyable.\n\nYou can listen to me narrate it here:\n\nhttps://aicpod.com/2022/01/04/faded-w...\n\nAugust 6, 2018\n\nI really hate this \"there's freedom in suffering\" bs, ESPECIALLY when it involves the church, the least suffering of all.\n\nDecember 4, 2020\n\nAlthough I didn't love it, there's something charming about it.\n\nAugust 31, 2022\n\nEn kritikk av faderrollen og hva den kan føre til. Veldig fyldig kort fortelling.\n\nMarch 22, 2023\n\nWritten by 1903 Nobel Prize in Lit. winner. tells a tale of pride and humility.\n\nOctober 12, 2023\n\nA father, a son and a priest over the course of time. It tells how the father's different encounters with the priest according to each phase of the life of his son.\n\nDecember 20, 2023\n\nRead this in class I loved how short it was and the general way the story was told.\n\nJanuary 2, 2024\n\nread this twice to digest it. and the third time made me a bit sad for the father's loss.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 14, 2024\n\nI denne korte og bevegande novella viser Bjørnson kva effekt ein sønns død kan gagne ein rik og likegydlig mann. Han tapte sin sønn og vant livet!\n\nMarch 20, 2017\n\nsynes det er en fin novelle fra den poetisk realisme. jeg tror fortsatt at jeg foretrekker Camilla Collett, men ikke si det til noen. (Amtmandens døtre ❤)\n\nmen godt jobba Bjørnson. ikke det at det betyr noe nå, men jeg liker skrivestilen din. tenkte å prøve meg på En Hanske neste gang.\n\nMay 18, 2024\n\nAn understated short story about a rich man, his son and a priest. I read it from Works of Björnsterne Björnson. Translated from Norse by Rasmus B. Anderson. 1882. As a parent, I'd recommend it for age 11 and up."
