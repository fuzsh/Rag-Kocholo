        "text": "AP, STOCKHOLM\n\nNorwegian writer Jon Fosse won the Nobel Prize in Literature yesterday, for plays and prose that “give voice to the unsayable,” the Swedish Academy said.\n\nOne of his country’s most-performed dramatists, Fosse, 64, has written about 40 plays as well as novels, short stories, children’s books, poetry and essays.\n\nNobel literature committee chair Anders Olsson said Fosse’s work is rooted “in the language and nature of his Norwegian background.”\n\nSwedish Academy permanent secretary Mats Malm, who announced the prize, reached Fosse by telephone to inform him of the win.\n\nHe said the writer was driving in the countryside and promised to drive home carefully.\n\nFosse is the fourth Norwegian writer to win the Nobel. Bjornstjerne Bjornson won it in 1903, Knut Hamsun was awarded it in 1920 and Sigrid Undset in 1928.\n\nHis work A New Name: Septology VI-VII — described by Olsson as Fosse’s “magnum opus” — was a finalist for the International Booker Prize last year.\n\nThe Nobel Prizes carry a cash award of 11 million kronor (US$998,080) from a bequest left by their creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. Winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma at the award ceremonies in December.\n\nLast year, French author Annie Ernaux won the prize for what the prize-giving Swedish Academy called “the courage and clinical acuity” of books rooted in her small-town background in the Normandy region of northwest France.\n\nErnaux was just the 17th woman among the 119 Nobel literature laureates. The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too focused on European and North American writers, as well as being too male-dominated."
