        "text": "Here you can see a facsimile of Bjørnson's letter to the engraver Throndsen.\n\nBjørnstjerne Bjørnson was one of Norway's most prominent writers and participants in public debate in the 19th century. After writing a series of superb stories and plays he received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1903. Bjørnson acquired a reputation for enjoying the limelight and for a considerable degree of personal vanity.\n\nIn 1895 the coin engraver Ivar Throndsen was working on a medal motif of the writers Bjørnson and Henrik Ibsen, reflecting their importance to Norwegian cultural life. The medal was never issued but the model was preserved. The design of this medal was the topic of a personal letter written by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson to the coin engraver Throndsen, in reply to an initial letter from Throndsen concerning the medal. At the time of this correspondence Bjørnson was living in Schwaz in Tyrol."
