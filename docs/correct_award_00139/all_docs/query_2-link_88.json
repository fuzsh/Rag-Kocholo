        "text": "from an Old Norse personal name composed of the elements anu âancestorâ + leifr âheir, descendantâ. St Olaf , King of Norway ( 995â1030 ), aided the spread of Christianity in his kingdom. The name was introduced to Britain before the Norman Conquest, but modern use as a given name in the English-speaking world originated in America, where it was taken by recent Scandinavian immigrants."
