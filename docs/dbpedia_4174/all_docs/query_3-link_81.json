        "text": "Devil May Cry 3 was one of those games you would play to take off the stress and enjoy a little while Dante battles through countless monsters and unleashes his awesome moves with his awesome collection of weapons. This game is coming back from a stalemate after a long time! Capcom celebrates the coming of Devil May Cry 3 to Nintendo Switch with a trailer that has released something fans of this franchise did not yet expect! Devil May Cry 3 now has a co-op mode!\n\nDevil May Cry had an amazing concept\n\nGoing outside the game world, developers took their time to find the right concept for this game. Dante's Inferno was a book written way in the past but has been a prestige marker for history as a brilliant work of art! The concept of Devil May Cry came from the book Dante's Inferno, but everything about the game is a twist on the story. Dante from the game has other motives for going through the circles of hell and battling his way to the bottom. However, the stages of hell are very much similar to those described in the book.\n\nThe Co-op mode allows both Dante and Vergil to be used at the same time\n\nThe new co-op mode makes both Dante and Vergil playable on one screen! In order to access this specific feature, players would first have to complete the introductory mission before going to Bloody Palace and picking out the co-op mode. Devil May Cry 3 has been an interesting hack and slash game, which is why it is now more fun to play in co-op mode!\n\nThe one thing we love about Devil May Cry 3 is still on Switch\n\nOne thing admittedly loved about Devil May Cry 3 aside from just the characters, or the graphics are the weapons! Dante has a pretty cool way of using his special looking weapons, each with their own unique style, damage, and cinematography! Shown in the trailer is how the weapon and style switching runs so smoothly! This is another advantage that the Nintendo Switch has on Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition.\n\nRead Also: Saber Interactive Brings The Witcher 3 Switch Patch 3.6 That Enables Players To Pick Various Graphic Options\n\nThe fly switching style has already been present in the previous Devil May Cry games, which is why this Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition holds a strong nostalgic string that pulls the best parts of Devil May Cry games to one console, the Nintendo Switch.\n\nRead Also: Surprising First-Person Shooter Game Releases on Nintendo Switch! Warface is Here!\n\nNintendo Switch is the perfect host for this game\n\nThis game has been around other platforms before, and although it has still seen success, the Nintendo Switch might be the perfect host for this game as it is not only portable, but it is also a great way to play co-op mode. Fans of this franchise would be happy to know that the Devil May Cry team has not left fans waiting and is now releasing Devil May Cry 3 on Nintendo Switch!\n\nâ“’ 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.
