        "text": "I got the Switch version on sale for like 3 bucks last year, and I figured it would make for a good October game. Problem is I actually have never played a DMC or Bayonetta game, and reading through some guides the amount of systems and combos in place seem overwhelming. I'm not expecting to SSS every mission on my first try, but I wonder if I should even focus on combis starting on.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the game front loads a lot of settings options (gold vs yellow? What? Original vs Freestyle?). I don't mind difficult games so I'm not put up by the game's hard reputation, but it does seem like this release is tailored for people with lots of previous experience.\n\nDon't worry about SSS, it's not that hard, just keep on changing your combo and add in a taunt, gets even easier the moment you get your second weapon.\n\nIt's not that hard, bosses always has a set of attacks, let them finish their attack then swoop in for a full combo and repeat.\n\nThere is a temptation to go far and use guns, don't. Guns barely do any damage, mostly to juggle enemies for points. Don't be afraid to get close to enemies, bait and dodge, and in the event you manage to attack at the same time, you will actually parry the enemy, and it gives you combo points.\n\nHave fun, it's a great action game.\n\nMy best advice is to not worry about it too much.\n\nSo, Gold vs Yellow is an interesting thing. I recommend Gold for a new player. It's basically how the game handles continues. With Gold you can continue from a checkpoint infinitely and have an item to revive on the spot. With Yellow you have an item to continue at a checkpoint and if you run out you have to start the mission over.\n\nOriginal vs Freestyle is a Switch port only thing. Basically the Switch port adds in features from DMC4 that allows you to switch styles and weapons freely. I personally think it might be a bit overwhelming for a new player but it's up to you, the original version is definitely more limiting.\n\nIn regards to style, I suggest sticking with Trickster and Swordmaster for now. Trickster gives you good dodges which will make the game easier. Swordmaster gives you a whole second melee moveset which lets you add in more variety to your moveset for style. Both are good for learning the game on depending on the situation.\n\nBut whatever options you choose as long as you go in not expecting to be a pro, you'll likely be fine. The game eases you into all your moves by needing to level up styles and buy new abilities, so you'll be starting simple. Master the basics and then unlock more. People telling you to learn about perfect i-frames and jump cancelling and all that, I would ignore those for now. That's pro level shit. Worry about that if you come back for higher difficulties (and even then, it's never mandatory to be a master).\n\nEdit: Actually, super big advice. Play around with the button layout if you need to. I never stick to default DMC controls. Mess around replaying the first mission a few times with different layouts if you want to, it's fully customizable. Personally I like putting lock-on on R2 and gun on L2, for example. I put melee on square, weapon switch on triangle, and style on circle. I find that easier for me but what layout works for you will be up to you to discover.\n\nThose options weren't there in the base game, which is why you're not given a lot of context for them.\n\nAnyway, Gold and Original is recommended.\n\nFor styles, Trickster is ideal for boss fights. Otherwise, feel free to experiment. But maybe focus on learning just one or two. Trickster and Swordmaster as suggested above are good beginner options.\n\nStyles level up as you use them, and you're not gonna fully level more than one over the course of a playthrough. Trickster level 2 gives you air dash, which is very useful.\n\nOne style meter tip is that it really loves crowds, so if you get two or more enemies caught in a Million Stab, you're gonna get a pretty hefty style increase.\n\nFor leveling, focus on getting Stinger right away, and Stinger 2 and Air Hike very soon. Getting the forward and back moves for the weapons is prudent (except Cerberus' back attack)\n\nExactly.\n\nIt's better, but not much better.\n\nThose options weren't there in the base game, which is why you're not given a lot of context for them.\n\nAnyway, Gold and Original is recommended.\n\nFor styles, Trickster is ideal for boss fights.

Hope you enjoy one of the best action games ever made.\n\nJust a few things off the top of my head:\n\n- As others have said, do not worry about getting a great score the first time, you can always replay levels to get better scores later and some levels (and secret missions) become easier once you obtain better weapons and skills later on.\n\n- Grab Stinger as soon as you can. It's a great for just plowing through enemies and knocking them down. You also have unique mobility options (example: If you stinger next to a ledge, Dante will \"Super Jump\"). You can use this move to chase down opponents you have knocked too far away\n\n- Abuse weapon switching. Switching your weapon will cancel it's recovery animation and doing so on the fly mid combo will keep your combo going longer. Most of your combos will end in some kind of knockdown or pushback and this will allow you to keep extending/hammering away at them without them being able to recover (this is for most trash mobs, bosses and certain special enemies are excluded). This can also be done with all guns and, once you get the rocket launcher, you can cancel the recovery time between rockets, giving you good dps.\n\n- All enemies have specific weaknesses to certain weapons (example: Spiders are weak to the flame/wind dual swords and Chess statues are weak to fists). Most of the bosses also have a specific way to \"cheese\" them if you are having too much difficulty.\n\n- Budget for enemy-step/double jump, and grab them as soon as you can. Jumping off of an enemy is another good evasive tool and, at the intermediate level, it can extend the time you are in the air and extend combos. This absolutely destroys an early-mid game boss\n\n- If you are having trouble early on with the games first few bosses, just grind levels 1-3 to level your styles and grind orbs for better moves. the game becomes much easier once more moves are available to you. I'd recommend getting trickster to level 2 early on so that you have access to double dash and air dash, you can negate a lot of attacks in the game simply by dashing through them with good timing.\n\n- Feel free to change the control setup to suit your liking. I usually change it so that jump is closer to attack so that it's easier for me to jump cancel.\n\nIf you don't care to be spoiled, or if you reached a point in the game where you are ready to level up you tech, here is some reading material that has helped me tremendously:\n\n- https://devils-lair.org/dmc3tutorial.php\n\n- https://devils-lair.org/dmc3strategy.php\n\nYou'll be kicking demon ass in no time!\n\nI got the Switch version on sale for like 3 bucks last year, and I figured it would make for a good October game. Problem is I actually have never played a DMC or Bayonetta game, and reading through some guides the amount of systems and combos in place seem overwhelming. I'm not expecting to SSS every mission on my first try, but I wonder if I should even focus on combos starting on.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the game front loads a lot of settings options (gold vs yellow? What? Original vs Freestyle?). I don't mind difficult games so I'm not put up by the game's hard reputation, but it does seem like this release is tailored for people with lots of previous experience.\n\nAs others have said pick Gold for your first run, it really helps the over all experience.\n\nI will also say do not worry about raking right now, at the start of the game its very normal to get C, B or even D ranking, you can replay them anytime you want and to be honest you really don't have the moves, arsenal and options to make a higher raking at the start.\n\nI know its has been said but I cant really stress enough how much of a life saver Jumping is, I can tell you right now I almost never used the dodge even on higher difficulties.\n\nAnother thing do not feel bad if you die a lot, DMC3 start way tougher and it becomes easier as you get more things.\n\nOverall just enjoy the game, take your time with as many options and styles DMC3 gets it can get overwhelming but as long as you find something you like stick with it and experiment here and there when you have time and remember that you can always replay all any mission at any time.\n\nI got the Switch version on sale for like 3 bucks last year, and I figured it would make for a good October game.

The Switch port has nasty input lag.\n\nThanks for all the recommendations. I'll start tonight with Gold / Freestyle options. I was concerned that the game was not actually designed around those in mind, but it seems I'm going to have my hands full regardless of that. Are there any missables or stuff like that I should worry about for a first playthrough?\n\nThe game may not have been designed for it, but it became the standard for the franchise moving forward so, y'know, who cares.\n\nThere are also things like Secret Missions and blue orb fragments that you'll probably miss on your first playthrough. The game works with a mission select that you can go back to collect those things or even just save that stuff for a playthrough on another difficulty. Upgrades are a save-file level unlock, not a single-playthrough level unlock, if that makes sense.\n\n...Reading through some guides the amount of systems and combos in place seem overwhelming. I'm not expecting to SSS every mission on my first try, but I wonder if I should even focus on combos starting on.\n\nDMC3 shockingly doesn't have an overwhelming combo system from the jump. It's actually probably the simplest action game to get into on that front. Unlike God of War, Ninja Gaiden or Bayonetta where you can have dozens of individual button combinations that do dramatically different things mapped between two melee buttons; you have either two or three weapon combos that branch off your normal Melee-Melee-Melee string with input delays to branch (I.E. Melee - (Pause) Melee, Melee), a lock on + forward + melee, and a lock on + back + melee special moves that usually propel you forward or launch the enemy respectively, along with an air attack.\n\nDMC3's combo depth is extremely modular, coming from trying to weapon-switch between your weapons, and weaving your style/gun actions to extend your combos. All of these things on a basic level are super easy, intuitive and fun to do. Don't overthink it. There is an entire world of jump cancels and combo set-ups for some over-the-top shit and all the nonsense those enable, but they aren't relevant until you're ready to seek that stuff out."
