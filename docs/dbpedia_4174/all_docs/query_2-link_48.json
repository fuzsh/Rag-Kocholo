        "text": "Friday 21 July 2006\n\nFact: if you haven't played Devil May Cry 3, you don't understand how hard it is. You might think you know - you might even have had a chuckle at people who complain about it - but you just don't get it. DMC was that special sort of hard that doesn't care about focus-testing or everyone seeing all the beautifully-designed later levels.\n\nDon't get us wrong, compared to most games, this Special Edition's still harder than Batman - it just won't make you cry any more. The biggest change is the Continue option. Previously, DMC made you go through each level - boss and all - at one go.\n\nIf you wanted to continue, you had to use a yellow Vital Star, which were expensive and only guaranteed one more go anyway. If you made a mistake - say, getting a bit careless with the low-level monsters - it was almost worth starting again. If you made a bigger blunder - like not bothering to buy the Air Hike ability before the third boss - you might have to redo two levels."
