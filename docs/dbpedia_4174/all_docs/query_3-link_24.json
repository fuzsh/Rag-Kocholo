        "text": "Developer: Capcom| Publisher: Capcom| Release Date: 20/02/2020\n\nPrice: $19.99/£15.99 | Review Code Provided by The Publishers | Genre: Action, Adventure, Other| Platform: Nintendo Switch\n\nDescription\n\nSet before the events of the original Devil May Cry, this action classic sees Dante facing off against his twin brother, Vergil, who has designs on unlocking a gate to the demonic realm, to which Dante himself holds the key… Featuring selectable combat styles such as Swordmaster and Gunslinger, Devil May Cry 3 brings an extra level of strategy to the series’ renowned stylish gameplay.\n\nThis edition includes all of the Special Edition content, including the ability to play as Vergil, and even includes extra bonus features exclusive to the Nintendo Switch.\n\nOverview\n\nFrom the DMC 1 & 2, and now we get to play the third installment on Nintendo Switch, awesome idea!!!\n\nSo everyone’s favorite demon hunter is back on the third installment of the Devil May Cry gaming series, with some changes on Nintendo Switch according to Capcom and while playing I saw some changes but still, they retained the game’s visual graphics, moves, and Dante’s cockery wist.\n\nSo now in this special version, you can now play as Dante’s twin brother, Vergil as well as playing new game modes such as Blood Palace and Turbo modes.\n\nJust to let you know, this is my first time playing one of the previous installments, recently played and finished DMC 5 (well-deserved Action game of the year award winner).\n\nSo I want to briefly discuss the graphics, gameplay/control and audio.\n\nGameplay/Controls\n\nThe Switch version retains the game’s controls and gameplay but added a few changes from the 2005 version of the game.\n\nI came across the changes from the game and I ain’t giving spoilers to the game, just giving details of what I saw.\n\nSo there are two options to choose from but starting the game such as “Original” and “Free Style”, so in my case, I choose the original, so as to experience the original gameplay of the 2005 PlayStation version before choosing the “Free Style” gameplay.\n\nSo “Freestyle” gameplay is giving players the chance to switch styles such as gunslinger, swordmaster or trickster freely while playing the game, unlike the “original” gameplay in which you’re to change the style one by one.\n\nSame controls as the previous installments, same fun to play with.\n\nGraphics\n\nI’ll say the game has retained the same visual graphics as the 2005 PlayStation version but they made it a bit enhanced for the Switch, such as Better visual effects and Better textures in a way that Capcom made it fit for Nintendo Switch and also they made some improvement on the graphics lighting to the game.\n\nAudio\n\nVoice-acting and soundtrack are totally the same as I mentioned and they’re awesome.\n\nCan’t complain.\n\nVerdict\n\nGameplay/Controls – 7.9/10\n\nGraphics – 8/10\n\nStory – 8.5/10\n\nAudio – 8/10\n\nOverall – 8.9/10\n\nThanks for reading my blog and SHOUTOUT to the publishers for giving me the opportunity to do a review of this awesome work.\n\nImaging DMC 4 and 5 being ported to Nintendo Switch, hmmm.\n\nGuess we’ll have to wait and see for that to happen."
