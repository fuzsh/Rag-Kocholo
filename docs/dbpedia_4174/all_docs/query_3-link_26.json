        "text": "Lately, I've been trying really hard to enjoy DMC3, but after getting the HD collection I've come to realize that the game just isn't good. I've beaten it once on Easy, and got half way through Normal... Just yesterday I played it a bit, and managed to do two missions before stopping... throughout those two missions, I had one moment of fun (against the first enemies introduced).\n\nThe combat imo was an improvement from DMC1... I'm not fond of the style system at all, but it gave the combat some extra meat... but I've found the enemy designs, and level designs to be simply aggravating. It's just not fun, and I have no idea how I enjoyed the game as a kid. It was the first DMC game I played... so maybe that's why.\n\nWith the enemies, only 3 of them are fun for me. Two of them were in the first mission, and the last one near the end of the game... all of which had feet, hands, and a scythe. Other than those guys, the rest either bore me, or annoy me. I've found the Spiders and Blood Bats to be the most silly. They took enemies from DMC1 and ruined them... the blood bats have to be turned into stone first, which always feels like a chore, and if you try damaging them otherwise they multiply. I enjoyed fighting the bats in DMC1 since it was a fun challenge to beat them with a sword, while in DMC3 there's really only one way of dealing with them... at least, it's like that for me.\n\nThen there are the spiders in DMC3... two things went wrong with them. They spit webs at you, and once they die they dissolve into dozens of small annoying ticks that jump on you. Bah, that completely ruins any fun I would have had. I don't like to be stunned, in any way... and here's an enemy, that has two ways of doing it.\n\nOther than the first two levels, I can't say I like any of them. I find them all annoying and aggravating to play through. Some levels have annoying traps that damage you, and only you... if you're fighting an enemy, well... tough luck. They're immune to sharp blades. For whatever reason, I also get annoyed by all the backtracking in DMC3... something about it is just incredibly boring... and maybe it's just me, but the atmosphere in DMC3 is almost non-existant.\n\nIt's a bit silly, but I also wished DMC3 had some type of parry, and even more importantly... enemy weaknesses like in the first game. Even though DMC1 was more simple as far as combat went, it had a wider variety of challenges I could give myself. Such as, parry certain attacks instead of dodging them, or kill every enemy within 10 seconds of having them appear... and even after unlocking everything in the game, I'm still finding new attacks to parry in the game.\n\nOverall, I guess DMC3 just isn't for me anymore. Felt like sharing.\n\nI can understand some of your complaints and you don't liking some features on the game, but some of them have their purpose or you don't had take your time to look at them, as they exists and works great within the game.\n\nThey took enemies from DMC1 and ruined them... the blood bats have to be turned into stone first, which always feels like a chore, and if you try damaging them otherwise they multiply.\n\nThey are actually intended to be the \"annoying-type\" enemy, exactly like the Plasmas on DMC1 (that die fast even in DMD, and those you kill in human form are most likely being multiplied too) that's why most of the Bloodgoyles encounters are in areas that you have to do a little plataforming or have pass them avoiding their attacks instead of just staying and fighting; they serve as a complement to fights were most enemies that cannot fight back well when being comboed and stunned. They add a measure of uncertainty and challenge to an otherwise easy battle, just like Soul Eaters do when on the same group of a Dullahan or Vanguard.\n\nThen there are the spiders in DMC3... two things went wrong with them. They spit webs at you, and once they die they dissolve into dozens of small annoying ticks that jump on you.\n\nDT is an universal tool to get rid of both these \"wrong things\", you don't need even to charge DTE, just using DT you get rid of both the web and the Arachne babies. Plus, when they jump in the walls mostly of the time them shots webs at you, is a very good time to deal great chunks of damage JCing A&R/Reb/Beo/Cerb on them as they most likely will stay still, while in the ground they move a lot and have great resistence to attack stunning making it hard to juggle or combo them for too long.\n\nIt's a bit silly, but I also wished DMC3 had some type of parry, and even more importantly... enemy weaknesses like in the first game.\n\nThe entire Royalguard style is built around parries. A well timed Just-release can parry nearly everything in the game. Enemies actually have weakenesses, both by specific weapons and some specific moments you attack the monsters, examples are: Cerberus to Abyss, A&R to Arachnes, Yamato to The Fallen; Stinger one Arachne after they do that \"backdash\" or that \"taunt\" by raising his claws, most of times they will get stunned because in that time they expose their \"mouths\", launch a Bloodgoyle to the air when they're about to get back to \"blood-form\", hit Geryon's head in the right time with any attack, hit Beowulf's eyes when he does any attack that exposes it, and so on. To implement the critical hits just like they were in DMC1 would mostly kill the entire combat system of DMC3, would render it useless as you would have a much more simpler ways to dispatch enemies like in DMC1.\n\nEven though DMC1 was more simple as far as combat went, it had a wider variety of challenges I could give myself. Such as, parry certain attacks instead of dodging them, or kill every enemy within 10 seconds of having them appear... and even after unlocking everything in the game, I'm still finding new attacks to parry in the game.\n\nAll this you said can be done in DMC3 and with a more diverse moveset and strategies to work out. Just for the sake of demonstrating how much variety the styles can bring to the gameplay and to show you some of enemies weakeness that are clearly demonstrate on some of these vids:\n\nLook at this Vergil 3 fight done by Heretic with RG style (my favourite in the game):\n\nBrea fighting Fallens and Abysses with TS style:\n\nMoe beasting Abysses and Archnes with SM style:\n\nAlexx being a weapon of mass destruction with GL style:\n\nMy two complaints, first, with all of the first three Devil May Cry titles... was the dialogue at times, I mean, I cannot stand some of it. Dante's dialogue whenever he goes self righteous/pinnacle of morality usually results in some of the worst lines I've ever known.\n\nE.g.\n\n\"I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with light!\" - Devil May Cry\n\n\"And my soul, is telling me that it wants to stop you!\" - Devil May Cry 3\n\nAnd whenever Dante talks in Devil May Cry 2 it makes me love the mute button more than I probably should.\n\nI admit, DMC 3 has some good dialogue, but a lot of it is still bad, and slowly destroys the story for me over time, and stuff like that scores badly with me.\n\nSecond; the environment. I do love the environment in Devil May Cry 3, but it's a pain too me, and something I love too. Yes, some of it looks nice, and plays out well within the context, and it plays part to the story as well for most of it, but even then, lot of it just feels rehashed and unoriginal, and there's no life to a lot of it either, particularly in earlier levels.\n\nI love DMC 3, but I can't help but hate those two points at times."
