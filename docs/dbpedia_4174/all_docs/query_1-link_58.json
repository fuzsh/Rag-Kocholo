        "text": "Ahead of Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition’s release on the Nintendo Switch next month, Capcom has revealed a huge new feature for the Switch version of DMC3.\n\nWe’d previously been teased that something extra was going to be included on the Switch port of Devil May Cry 3, and now Capcom has revealed that players will actually be able to switch gameplay styles at the drop of a button.\n\nThis feature will basically make Devil May Cry 3 play in a similar way to Devil May Cry 4 and 5, with the implementation of the Style Change option meaning that players can switch between fight styles and weapons on the fly. It also, of course, means that combos become more fluid and unique for those looking to elegantly slice ‘n’ dice their way through the action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven that Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition has already been released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as part the Devil May Cry HD Collection, it remains to be seen whether this added feature will eventually make its way to these systems, or whether it will simply be exclusive to the Switch.\n\nDevil May Cry 3: Special Edition will hit Nintendo Switch on February 20th."
