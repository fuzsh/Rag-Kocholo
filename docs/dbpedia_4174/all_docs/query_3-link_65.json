        "text": "Reviewed By: Aaron Ploof\n\nVOLUNTEER GUEST REVIEWER\n\nGAME TECH INFO Computer Platform: Playstation 2\n\nProduced by: Capcom\n\nPrice Range: $41-50\n\nAge level: Mature Teen to Adult\n\nESRB Rating: M (Mature)\n\nOverall Rating:\n\nGenre: Action\n\nChristian Rating: 2 of 5\n\n(offensive)\n\nGameplay: 5 of 5\n\n(excellent)\n\nViolence: 2 of 5\n\n(heavy)\n\nAdult Content: 3 of 5\n\n(mild)\n\nDevil May Cry was released about 4 years ago. It was a gothic horror action/adventure game. Of course, with it's title having the word “devil” in it, it might not appeal to many Christians. But if you were mature enough, you were in a for a treat. Now, \"Devil May Cry 3\", the prequel to \"Devil May Cry\", is out. Is it awesome? Yes! Is it offensive? Sort of. Can you handle the difficulty? If you're not a pro, you don't have very much of a chance.\n\nIn Devil may Cry 3, you play the role of Dante, a half-demon, half-human, demon hunter. His father, Sparda, sealed off the demon realm 2,000 years ago. Now Dante's evil twin brother is trying to open the realm once again.\n\nThe goal of this game is to traverse a huge tower that has risen from the depths of Hell. As Dante, a demi-human, you have to stop your evil twin brother, Vergil, from opening the portal.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is extremely difficult to catch on to, but it's awesome. You'll be doing backflips, running up walls, spinning in the air, shooting in two directions at once, running down the sides of buildings, you name it. This game is so difficult that even the easy mode is hard. If you are a novice player, I highly suggest turning on the automatic mode; it attacks for you. Gameplay 5/5\n\nThis game has some pretty heavy occultic symbolism. There are evil demons, and of course just the name of the game is kina sketchy. However, most of the symbolism is used by the evil people. Christians might find this game offensive because Dante is half demon, and is a good guy;we all know demons are evil. Dante uses magic to attack his enemies and has an evil looking sword his father used. However, taking into context that his father used to be an evil demon, but turned to the good side, you can easily shrug this off. I don't find this game to be overly offensive because Dante is on the good side. Occultish 3/5\n\nNow, this game also has some pretty violent scenes in it. In just the opening scene, Dante gets stabbed in the chest by about ten swords, and still walks around with them in his chest. When he rips them out, blood splatters everywhere. Your moves are kinda violent as well. You use guns, nunchucks, and swords to make the devils cry. Overall, I think a 16 year old could handle the violence in this game. on a scale of violence : 2/5\n\nThe sexuality, doesn't go overboard in this game, except for one scene. One of the bosses is not wearing a top, and it's a girl. This demon is a seductress, and Dante starts asking her if she will treat him well. Of course we all know that Dante is just trash talking the demon. On an offensive scale 3/5.\n\nDante's attitude is pretty rough. He's a really cocky kid. He repeatedly mocks the bosses, and uses phrases such as \"This is going to be one hell of a party!\". However, we can all look up to Dante for fighting his inner demon.\n\nOverall, this game can be offensive. I suggest 16+ to play this game. If you think it might be too hard or offensive, rent it first. If you can handle material that doesn't exactly fit with your beliefs, get it right now! It's that good!\n\nYear of Release—2005\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this Christian Spotlight review are those of the reviewer (both ratings and recommendations), and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Films for Christ or the Christian Answers Network."
