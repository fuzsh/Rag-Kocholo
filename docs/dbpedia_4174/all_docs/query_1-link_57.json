However, it turns out there is a second bottom to the whole thing and eventually both heroes join forces in order to face the common enemy. Mechanics-wise, the game hasn't changed significantly from the previous installments of the series and concentrates on dynamic fights with groups of opponents and difficult bosses. In combat Nero uses his sword and firearms.

Depending on personal preferences, the style can emphasize powerful melee attacks (Swordmaster), defense & counterattacks (Royal Guard), firearms (Gunslinger), or mobility (Trickster). Other gameplay elements remain the same – the player will face numerous opponents at once and participate in dynamic action sequences while accompanied by a heavy metal soundtrack.\n\nPCSwitchPS2\n\nDevil May Cry 2\n\nAction 25 January 2003\n\nA continuation of the third-person perspective hack and slash released by Capcom in 2001, which told a story of Dante – a half-demon and destroyer of evil. In this part, his adventures combine with the story of a warrior called Lucia – they both intend to stop a businessman named Arius from resurrecting a demon and acquiring superhuman powers that would make him rule the world. Mechanics remain almost unchanged, but there is a change of scenery – instead of the dark, gothic style, Devil May Cry 2 features contemporary cities with skyscrapers and mazes of streets. Gameplay is divided into two independent campaigns in which you can play with both heroes. Each of them offers a slightly different style – in contrast to the strong, but slow Dante, Lucia is fast and nimble. Both characters have the ability to transform into a demon, which is the special power known from the first installment.\n\nSwitchPS2\n\nDevil May Cry\n\nAction 16 October 2001\n\nDeveloped by an internal development studio of Capcom, a third-person perspective action game emphasizing its dynamic, very spectacular combat system.

During gameplay you follow a dark warrior named Dante – half-man, half-demon – who must face the ruler of the underground world Mundus, who was defeated thousands of years before by Dante’s father. The action revolves around skillful elimination of waves of enemies with the use of gradually-upgraded tools of destruction. Each stage is rated on a special scale that examines your time, fighting style, items used, and damage received. Interestingly, Dante can transform into a demon for a short period of time, during which, surrounded by a special aura, he spreads destruction even more vigorously.\n\nSwitchPS2"
