        "text": "Following a disappointing sequel and almost two years of rehabilitation, Dante's all set to storm the gaming scene again with his third PlayStation 2 blood-fest, Devil May Cry 3 -- Almost. While DMC3 isn't quite ready to go just yet, and a stateside release planned for February 2005, the game does seem to be shaping up into a must-have title; judging by a short demo bundled with the recent Japanese release of Biohazard Outbreak File #2.\n\nThe demo begins in Dante's office just prior to its having been opened for business. Dante comes out from the shower to meet a man who has taken a great interest in the amulet that both he and Dante's twin brother are in possession of. Following a bloody entanglement with a few dozen enemies, Dante grabs his trademark red leather coat and, with the words \"Looks like this is gonna be a hell of a party,\" heads off on what's presumably his first adventure (Devil May Cry 3 is a prequel to the original, after all).\n\nThis opening sequence alone offers convincing evidence that Devil May Cry 3 retains all the over-the-top humor that makes the series so fun. Dante may be a newbie in this prequel, but he's already cool enough to pound on his table and make the telephone receiver leap perfectly into his hands. He knows just when to say such lines as \"This party's getting crazy,\" right before he pounds a juke box to start pumping the Goth tunes required for a good gun and sword massacre. The son of Sparda sends enemies flying with a kick between the legs plays a deadly game of pool with his attackers and surfs on fallen foes and all because someone stepped on his pizza. The opening sequence is the most absurd thing we've ever seen in a game for quite a long time, but we hope the rest of Devil May Cry 3 features even more of it!\n\nSurprisingly, most of the things Dante does to his foes in the opening sequence can be replicated by the player as well. Dante has more moves than ever in his latest installment, and thanks to the refined control system and some awesome lighting and animation, doing all the stuff in-game is just as fun as when watching it in a cinema sequence; at least in the couple of stages offered up by the demo. You can't make Dante kill enemies with a bunch of pool balls, but you can surf on fallen foes.\n\nAs mentioned in our look at the game from E3, Dante's big list of moves is separated into four distinct fighting styles. Players can switch between the four styles prior to the start of a mission or at special statues found within a mission. The demo includes three of the four styles, letting players try out Sword Master, Gunslinger and Trickster styles, but leaving Royal Guard Dante locked away for the final version.\n\nThe functionality of the circle button changes with the choice of style. Under the Trickster style, the circle button acts as a dash move. While using this style, Dante can dash to avoid enemies and, when facing a wall, can run up the wall and along the ceiling. Sword Master makes the circle button perform a shredding move with Dante's sword, slashing away at nearby enemies. With Gunslinger style, the circle button can make a jumping Dante flip over and release a shower of bullets. Gunslinger style also lets players control the direction of Dante's second gun; when pressing the circle button to fire, one gun shoots forward while the other fires in the direction players tilts the right thumb pad.\n\nThe demo doesn't seem to contain any of the character building elements hinted at during Capcom's E3 unveiling of Devil May Cry 3, but even in their most basic states, the styles each make for a very unique Dante. We get the feeling that Sword Master is meant for players who prefer up close combat compared to Gunslinger which is for long distance gun-based combat and Trickster which is more aversion (and acrobatic) based. The demo didn't require that we choose one particular style, so we found ourselves sticking with our favorite.\n\nWhile changing your style will force you to change the way you play, Dante has a large set of moves, many inherited from previous titles, that works regardless of the current style. You can pull off melee moves using the triangle button in different combinations, sending enemies flying into the air and even smashing down at them from above. Dante's twin guns can be used quite skillfully using just the square button. As with the original, you can make Dante slowly glide down from a jump, blasting away at foes right in front of him. Dante's set of basic moves is huge; you may end up pulling things off without knowing how to replicate them.\n\nCarrying over from the last installment, Devil May Cry 3 lets you equip Dante with different swords and guns, switching off between them on the fly. The demo includes a shot gun on top of Dante's twin guns. The shot gun changes not just Dante's standard gun attacks but the special attacks from his Gunslinger style as well. Once you've collected lots of guns and blades and have access to all four styles, there should be plenty of room to play as your preferred form of Dante.\n\nThere's plenty of encouragement to use all of Dante's many skills in Devil May Cry 3. The game has a progressive combo system where you're rated based on how long you combine attacks. Get combos going and a meter appears on the screen with, initially, the word \"Dope\" above it. Continue the combo until you fill up the Dope meter and a new meter appears on screen with the word \"Crazy\" above it. This is followed by B, A and S levels. The meter depletes as you let your combo lag without a hit, depleting faster with higher rank. Once you get to S level, you'll have to connect moves almost instantly or the meter will disappear. To get the combo up to high levels, you'll have to perform consecutive attacks quickly -- and not just the same attack over and over again, but a variety of attacks.\n\nHaving at last played through a demo outside of a frantic game show or press event, we're more excited than ever about getting our hands on the final version of Devil May Cry 3. We're certainly far more excited about DMC3 than we were of DMC2 having played a Japanese demo of that title prior to its release. The action seems to be more focused than it was in DMC2, with tighter environments (at least in the couple of levels that we've played). Add to that the combo system and style selection systems, and Capcom may have next year's must play slash and shoot experience.\n\nThe demo is, incidentally, playable completely in English, with English voiceovers, subtitles and text. If you're interested in getting a shot at Devil May Cry 3 in advance, and you have a PS2 capable of playing Japanese games, then you should definitely check with your importer about obtaining the demo with Resident Evil Outbreak File 2 as soon as you can.\n\nWe'll be back with more, soon."
