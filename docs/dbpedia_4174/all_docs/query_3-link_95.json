        "text": "Devil May Cry 3\n\nThis is it, the last game on our journey. For many this may be the hardest Devil May Cry they have faced yet. For some it will be extremely fun as this is by far the best developed game of the three but also the most complex to grasp when it comes to combos. Before we even get started on the walkthrough I will go over the really big changes here that you will need to get used to fairly quickly. Most of these are in the hints and tips page but this is more for a refresher.\n\nFirst of all the mechanics are mostly back from the main game. You have to purchase your abilities again and guns are once again fairly useless for most battles (as always there will be exceptions). You have access once you go through the game to multiple melee weapons that actually make a ton of difference now. Instead of the 3 weapons from DMC 1, you have now 5 different melee weapons and 5 different guns in this game. Also secret missions are once again challenging as they all offer very different types of obstacles and challenges to pass rather than just rooms to kill things like DMC 2 did. The only thing that really returns from DMC 2 is that there are a lot of boss battles, but now I can actually pronounce their names and some of these battles are truly epic and difficult. There are 15 unique boss battles over 20 missions so there is going to be a lot to learn.\n\nHide ads\n\nThere are four very big differences to start learning in DMC 3. First are styles. No longer do you have access to all your moves per weapon, you actually will have to pick styles to be able to execute certain moves. Now assigned to the B button on the controller is your style button. This button will change what it does based on the style you have equipped along with the weapon you have equipped. For example, when you have your main sword rebellion equipped if you are in one style and hit be you will do a quick dash out of the way, and in another style you will flip the sword in a circle knocking enemies in the air. The other catch to this is you can only change styles before missions and at the shop statues throughout the game, so you are stuck in the style you chose for quite some time in many cases. Another interesting bit is that styles level up (to Level 3 max) as you use them/kill things while in the style. Progressing to higher levels in each style gives you even more extra moves at your disposal and there is an achievement associated with getting all the styles to level 3. The four styles are Trickster, Swordmaster, Gunslinger, and Royal Guard. I will do my best to break each one down below to describe what they do and how they might help you.\n\nTrickster\n\nIf there is one good thing that came from DMC 2, it was the dodge button. Trickster essentially brings the dodge button back in a different form of a dash. As you upgrade the trickster style you can dash out of the way of things multiple times in a row, or even dash in midair to reach things that normally would be impossible to get. This is very helpful during battle to get out of the way of a last minute attack that might just bring you down or to close the gap between you and a stunned enemy. You will need this style many other times to access secret missions or blue orb slices. Overall however this style is used more for defense, and is probably the second if not most useful style in the game for me.\n\nSwordmaster\n\nI probably don’t have to tell you that this is the offensive style of the game. Swordmaster adds as whole other layer to your attacks and abilities with every weapon. What makes this style so unique and hard to master is the B button has its own input commands along with it changes depending on what weapon you are using. Add that to you can switch weapons on the fly in mid combat and things really can start to get out of control fast. This is the most useful style in the game up there with trickster. Either one can be looked at as the best depending on what you are trying to do. I could spend a few pages going through each weapon but will for now leave this style for the time being. I will go over weapons as they are collected.\n\nGunslinger\n\nLike swordmaster, gunslinger has the same effect on guns that swordmaster has on melee weapons. You can now shoot in two different directions at once with the B button and start doing some crazy air gun attacks. While all these moves look amazingly cool, they are just not that helpful in a game where you need to melee almost all of your foes. I rarely if ever used this style since guns were never my main approach so it was not helpful to me.\n\nRoyal Guard\n\nThis is argued by the best players of the game to be the best style in the whole game as it is the absolute hardest to use properly. A defensive style in nature, the B button is used as a block command for attacks with a catch. The catch is if you time your blocks PERFECTLY (meaning right when the strike is going to hit you) you will instead of blocking some of the damage absorb all the damage and store it to reflect it back at enemies in a blast. Sounds amazing right? The problem here is you need to be a master of timing to get anything out of this style. If you can master it, I hear it has amazing properties. I unfortunately did not put enough time to master it and therefore never got the hang of it. Don’t think the block is a stop all attacks too. There are attacks that negate the block if not timed perfectly and still will knock you on your butt.\n\nSo here is my advice, try the styles out and find out which ones work for you and then use them. Since they were my most effective styles I chose to use the Swordmaster and Trickster styles so a lot of my strategies will revolve around them. Do not worry change in style will not make or break you in boss battles or fights, just add more options.\n\nThe second big difference is invincibility frames. Learn them well. The BEST invincibility frame to master throughout the whole game is the jump button. Whenever you jump you negate any damage that could occur to you on the UP portion of the jump ONLY. When you are coming down you are fair game. You could have an enemy explode right next to you that would normally kill you but if you jump at the exact right time of the explosion you will walk away without a scratch. Keep this in mind at all times and use it to your advantage. It is still hard to master the timing but can help you out of a lot of bad situations. Along with jumping, the dash move in Trickster has a small invincibility frame on the FIRST DASH ONLY. If you can dash multiple times it will not save you on the second or third. So if you are in trickster you pretty much have two ways to avoid attacks but again, timing must be spot on.\n\nThe third difference to the game is now you can change your weapons on the fly in the middle of a fight or even a combo. This leads to quite a vast variety of combos you can start unleashing and in theory be as creative as you want to. This is not needed but can unleash some crazy damage in the game. The main reason you want to know about how to chain combos is for Rank Statues (called Combat Adjudicators) in the game, something that is newly introduced in DMC 3 and carried into DMC 4. There will be statues that you have to use a single weapon on and raise your style rank to either B, A, S, or the new ranks SS and SSS. There is a lot of information out there about how to chain attacks, which ones go together the best, how to create infinite loops of pain but having pretty much never ending combos, and how to properly use the canceling technique which is how you chain one combo to the next. This is what I meant by the intro when I cannot teach you how to make super cool YouTube videos for DMC 3. The players that master this are truly a sight to behold. If you can do it, awesome. Unfortunately I can only do baby combos and teach you how to get by with basic switches and techniques.\n\nThe last change comes to the devil trigger. No worries, it is still there and makes you very powerful but there are more options to it now. First there is a devil trigger blast, which is available once you have more than three gages on your devil trigger bar. What this does is if you hold the devil trigger button instead of taping it, a charge starts to build for any orbs you have beyond 3. The more you charge, the bigger the explosion and the more damage you can do. This can be a kill all things at once button and also push your style meter to insane heights. You will also gain a doppelganger devil trigger ability and another devil trigger ability to slow time completely to bash things apart for as long as your meter holds up. You will have to make the choice (of course based on when you unlock it) just like your styles of which of the three abilities you want to use once they become available. Until later playthroughs I stick with the basic devil trigger with the blast mode.\n\nThe other challenging part to this game is there is so much to buy at the shop between leveling up your weapons, unlocking specific abilities for each weapon, and the usual blue and purple orbs that it can be difficult to decide what you want to get. There are ways to grind out orbs in this game if you want to max yourself out earlier but we will focus on that after the first walkthrough.\n\nWell, now that we have covered the starting basics it is pretty much time to jump right into the game. Again for the first walkthrough we will start on normal and be doing all blue orb slices, (you may miss a few based on what you buy and don’t buy ability wise in the shops and also how you level up your styles) doing all secret missions, and by the end we will wreck some havoc on the credits screen.\n\nMission 01: Crazy Party\n\nOh yeah, forgot to mention the missions actually have names again. Also as we get going I would mention that the story is worth watching along with all the cut scenes. Just for a bit of reference, this is a prequel so all of this happens before the events of DMC 1.\n\nThe first mission is straight forward and a nice introduction to the combat, since all you are going to do is fight some enemies in a small room. The game will teach you some of the new mechanics I explained right away as well before you get going. The first enemies you will be introduced to belong to the Seven Hells Army, and are appropriately named after the seven deadly sins. The first will be Pride, which as the puppets from DMC 1 and the skeletons in DMC 2 are your basic enemy and fodder for most levels. They carry scythes and are slow and easy to combo and to see their attacks coming. The really don’t do much other than stalk you and swing their scythes at you in a wide arch. After you kill a few pride enemies you will be introduced to Lust, a red enemy with a scythe as well but faster and more aggressive. Lusts main attack is to jump far away from you and hesitate a second before charging you with its scythe. This can be painful and if you don’t keep your eye on them hard to predict. Also in this Devil May Cry you have some camera control finally. Most of the time again if you keep an enemy off camera they will not attack you until you can see them. Lust will still hit you if you see it before jumping off camera to charge you so watch out. Chain your attacks if you can to bring up your style rank and avoid being hit also if possible. This is the first game where you are really penalized for not changing up your attacks at all in style points. Also the guns are no longer going to keep your style alive like DMC 2 so close the gap fast between enemies. The only real combos you have in the beginning is to attack with three straight hits (The Y Button 3 times with equal presses) The round tip combo (a personal favorite of mine which is Y, hesitate, Y, Y) and the usual hang time combo from DMC 1 along with downward slash. For future reference this is a great mission to S rank, but don’t worry about that for now as we eventually will need to S rank every mission in one play though for an achievement. That will come much later. This can also be a fun place to grind for orbs or just get used to combat in general. Finishing the fight will finish the mission.\n\nMission 02: The Blood Link\n\nMission 02 is a lot like mission 1, a straight up fight just in a larger area. You will still have the same enemies you faced earlier with Pride and Lust. Right when you start there is a vital star next to the stairs on Dantes left. After the fight goes for a bit a new enemy will warp in carrying a huge looking boulder on its back. This is Wrath, and it has one purpose…to blow up. If you see Wraith the goal is to get away from it and shoot it with your guns to make it explode. If other enemies get caught in the blast they will also be injured. The fight will continue some more with now all three of the enemies that have been introduced to you. Once you clear the group out your first “boss battle” begins.\n\nBoss Battle: Hell Vanguard\n\nThe Hell Vanguard looks like death, but the reason that I put boss battle in quotations is while this is the final boss fight for mission 2, you will start facing hell vanguards during regular fights paired with other enemies throughout the game and on harder difficulties. Consider this more of a mini boss.\n\nSo the Hell Vanguard is a bit more of a threat then the other enemies you have been dealing with. First off he will block and parry your attacks (and at the same time you can parry his). He will take a wide swing at you with his scythe and you can parry him up to 3-4 times before he normally will win this battle and hit you. The good part about parrying his sword is it brings your style meter up really fast. Best thing you can do is to parry him once or twice, then dodge out to the way when he swings and hit him a few times from behind. Be warned if you get hit he can combo you for about 3-5 hits. The Hell Vanguard can also teleport and tends to like to teleport right behind you during a fight so pay attention to where he is going at all times and where he appears. The really main attack the Hell Vanguard has is when you see him scream and you hear a death toll bell and then he teleports away. When this happens he will do one of three moves (in this first battle however he normally only uses the first one I will mention). The Hell Vanguard will dash at you on the ground level and attempt to slice you once he teleports in sight. Normally you can see a ripple before he teleports in to avoid this. Later he also will come straight up through the ground (again seen by a ripple where you are standing) that you can dodge, and his last attack is if you like to jump a lot and stay in mid-air he will do a mid-air dash and take you down that way. All of these moves hurt and there is no counter attack to hurt the Hell Vanguard during them. Once he is done his death toll move (not sure if it is called that, but I like the name now that I’ve written it since it goes with a death toll bell) He will teleport on street level standing still spinning his scythe.\n\nSo the best way to approach the Hell Vanguard is to be aggressive and go right at him head on. Parry his attacks a few times then roll (or if you are using Trickster dash with B) to the side and then combo him. If he teleports gage where he is going to be and attack accordingly. This fight is really not that hard as long as you do a bit of dodging and pay attention.\n\nBeating the Hell Vanguard will start a cut scene and then the mission will end.\n\nMission 3: The Devil’s Tower\n\nAlright, the game will actually begin now. This mission will start the blue orb hunts, secret missions, and combat adjudicators along with introducing some of the real bosses to the game. After a cut scene you will be on the street again and see a club off in the distance. You do have the option of turning around and going back to the front of your “shop” and getting in another big fight with the enemies you have met so far. This is a great place to also farm red orbs if you want to get some extra abilities now. If you wish to grind I highly recommend buying stinger (you know this move from DMC 1 the best and it is still wonderfully useful here) and as silly as it might sound upgrading your pistols to their max level for a boss fight strategy we will be using. You can buy other moves and blue/purple orbs too if you wish but as always it is really up to you and your fighting style. In the end we have to buy all of it anyways for achievements.\n\nHead off towards the club ahead and a small cut scene will introduce Enigmas to you. These are actually one of the most dangerous enemies in the whole game, but won’t appear to be until you start hitting Very Hard and Dante Must Die mode. They act like archers shooting arched and straight shots of blue and red “arrows” at you. There is a high pitch sound that stays (it sounds like something is charging) before they are going to shoot you. They have no other attacks other than to shoot the arrows at you but again, this can drain you fast. The reason they tend to be deadly is there is almost always more than one of them around and also other melee enemies that join them, so they are filling you up with arrows while you are fighting Prides and Lusts. To make sure that doesn’t happen, bum rush the Enigmas right away and melee them to death. Once you got them all on the roofs you can start fighting the Pride and Lust enemies that start appearing. Make sure you stay back from some of the walls/doors as well as the red barrels (the barrels can explode and hurt you badly along with enemies) since the enemies will come through the walls and sometimes swipe at you while you can’t see them on the other side of the wall. For future reference you don’t have to stick this fight out and can just run into the door but for red orbs sake and for practice I would kick the enemies around. Head in the door to the left (the nightclub) once the fight is over.\n\nIn the bar, you will see your first blue seal (which as the game will tell you mean you have to solve some sort of puzzle or activate something to proceed) and also let you know about the red seals. Unlike DMC 1, red seals mean you have to kill all the enemies in the room and not buy your way out with red orbs. There are many destructible items in here and actually it would be a good idea to take a mental note of where they all are for a secret mission later. For a quick reference since you can get orbs from almost all the items here, make sure you go behind the bar and break the barrels and all the glasses on the back wall and hanging rack. There are bottles and tables on the main floor to break, and a few more barrels on top of the bar. Once you make your way to the left of the seal, break the machines there to show an emblem to hit and light up. These work just like the emblems in DMC 1, and once you get it activated the seal will drop and you can pick up the shotgun to add to your gun collection. Like the melee weapons (which I will discuss more lately) you can now switch you guns in real time without going to the menu. You can only do this however with the two you currently have equipped but does mean you can in theory be shooting an enemy from far away and see one snuck up behind you and then hit the left trigger and turn around and blast him with the shotgun right away (why you wouldn’t hit him with the sword however would be beyond me so chances are this situation will never happen). The point is you can seamlessly switch weapons in the middle of combat. Head through the door behind the seal now.\n\nYou have now actually entered the club and if you head to the dance floor there is a good amount of breakable sofas and chairs around the stage. Head towards the exit to start another mandatory battle since the red seal shows itself this time. A small scene will introduce another new enemy to you, Sloth. Sloth while moving really slowly (hence the name) can be quite deceptive since they have the ability to teleport right next to you and start attacking right away. In large numbers they can be devastating if you get three that surround you and teleport at the same time. Sloth is easy to stun however and can be used to create some of the best and longest combos in the game since they have a fair amount of health compared to Pride and Lust. Speaking of which as you fight the Sloths, Pride and Lust enemies will also start showing up to join the fun. Even though for me it had no real helpful use, for shits and giggles you can go to the pole on the stage and spin around if the enemies are close enough to hit them as you spin. Once this battle is complete, notice there is a green orb above the door on the staircase in case you lost some health and exit the club.\n\nAs you exit the club you can jump on the hanging sign that says love for a secret red orb spot and pick up some red orbs along the way to the tower ahead. Make sure to check the left side for some rubble that you can open up on the building before it ends to find a red orb statue you can bust up for some red orbs. Afterwards there is a dumpster you can break to get a green orb, but hold off on that for a little bit. Jump up to the left of the dumpster to find the first combat adjudicator for rebellion. These statues are straight forward but in some cases (later on actually) be VERY hard to succeed at. This one is for Rebellion (the only sword you own now anyways) and you have to hit it until you can bring your rank up to B to destroy it and get a blue orb slice. The best way to raise your rank is to pick three moves and keep cycling through the moves in the same order. If you have four moves you can cycle through even better (i.e. Stinger, then Hang time, then Round Tip, then Regular attack with Million Stabs, then Stinger, then Hang time…you get the idea).\n\nBlue Orb Slice 1/32\n\nNow head across to the other side of the street and jump up to collect the blue orb slice in plain sight.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 2/32\n\nAfter getting the first two slices jump down and inspect the door right below the last blue orb slice you just got to start your first secret mission.\n\nSecret Mission 1: The Exorcist\n\nThis mission will take place in the club room you just left during you last fight. The fight will be the same but now you only have 1 minute to defeat all the enemies. Use everything you know to kill the enemies as quickly as possible. If you fail you can try again by inspecting the door right afterwards. Once you succeed you will get another blue orb slice and an achievement by doing your first secret mission.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 3/32\n\nSecret Mission 1/12\n\nWorst Kept Secret\n\nDMC3:Completed a Secret Mission with any character\n\nNow that all those things are out of the way, hit the dumpster for your green orb to regain your health (see, I told you to wait for a good reason). Head up toward the tower now and stop at the shop statue if you wish (yes I know they are called Divinity Statues, but Shop Statues make more sense to me still). I would recommend to power up your pistols again as far as you can for the upcoming area. If you can also afford Air Hike or Stinger buy them. Drive can wait till later (but is still a fantastic move). Head towards the bright light and prepare yourself. Once you enter the chamber and head toward the door covered with ice a cut scene will occur and you will come face to face with…\n\nBoss Battle: Cerberus\n\nFor an early boss battle this guy can be a real bitch (no pun intended). The damage he deals out is intense especially with the super small health bar you start out with. He has melee and distance attacks and they are quite varied so you will have to know how to read him. If you charge in and just start hacking away you will die. I guarantee that.\n\nSince I will be recommending you stay away from him, I will at least warn you what to expect if you got up close to Cerberus. He will either swipe you with his paw, bite you with his active head (will cover the head thing in a moment), or slam his whole body down on you. Point is stay away, this dog bites.\n\nCerberus’s heads actually work similar to Trismagia back in DMC 2. Each of his three heads does something different for an attack but all are based on ice attacks instead. The active head is always the one closest to the ground (or in the center; however you want to look at it). One head will shoot a projectile ice block at you to hit you. Another one sprays a large radius ice beam across the ground which will freeze you in place along with hurting you. The last one will roar up in the air and ice shards will fall from the ceiling down on you in a fairly big range. To make matters worse each head is encased in ice which acts as a defense barrier you have to break through to start actually hurting him and he can roar to recover himself with it at any time. Also while staying away from Cerberus he will sometimes rear back and lunge at you from across the room and then slowly drag himself back to his starting position. All this makes it pretty much so no place in the room is safe even though this mutt is chained to the wall.\n\nOkay I lied; there is one safe place since fortunately someone out there found a really cheap way to fight Cerberus to make this battle really long but painless. You want to hug the far left side of the room as far as you can go and right about where the wall curves up a little. From this point, only two of Cerberus’s attacks actually have a chance of hitting you. The ice beam across the floor can barely touch you but is easily avoided by jumping (using Air Hike if you bought it gives you a little extra boost to so you can avoid it) and the ice shards falling from the ceiling can hit you. Still, that eliminates most of Cerberus’s attacks just by standing in that spot. You will be blasting Cerberus from this spot with your pistols like the world is ending. Second thing is to point out you can target each individual head by using the Right Bumper while locked on shooting. If you damage each head enough it will actually explode and be rendered useless. You may be following my logic here already but here is what you should do to make the fight easier. Get to the spot I mentioned and start shooting but pay attention to what each head does when Cerberus has it active. As soon as you can tell which head make ice shards fall from the ceiling target it and NEVER LET IT GO. Blast that head and that head only until it is destroyed and now you only have to worry about the ice beam on the floor. Guess which is the next head you are going to target? You guessed it, the ice floor beam shooting head. Yup, once the ice beam and ice shard attack heads are gone Cerberus can’t touch you. He will lunge at you in vain and try and hit you with the ice block/boulder but be unable to hit you. While you are taking those heads out if the ice beam is going to be used just jump when it is on your side and then target the head you need to and keep shooting. The only time you really need to move from your spot is when the ice shard head is active and roaring in the air to drop crap on you. Dodge to the right as far as you can and then get back to your spot when the attack is over and commence. If you use this cheap strategy you will win. Not graceful but certainly effective. Defeating Cerberus will end with a cut scene and an achievement.\n\nMan's Best Friend\n\nDMC3:Defeated Cerberus\n\nYou now have your first weapon…Cerberus! This is a three sided nun chuck with ice qualities in its attack. Who would have guessed that? This weapon also has moves you can buy for it and extra additional moves that are possible when in the swordmaster style. Because you now have two weapons you will be able to switch melee weapons in mid combat between Cerberus and Rebellion using the right trigger. For now however enjoy the cut scene where Dante shows off some of the capabilities of Cerberus and the mission will end as you approach the door and get another story cut scene.\n\nMission 4: The Uninvited One\n\nStarting now in the tower (and looking a lot like the games roots from DMC 1 as I am sure you can tell) the game will also quickly tell you how to access the mini map. It can be a good tool if you do get lost as there are a few levels where you may find it hard to figure out where to go next or where you have been. For reference there is a shop statue to the right side of the bottom on the stairs here which is good to know if you ever want to change your weapons or styles for later. For now head up the stairs and when you reach the back of them jump up to the next level following the red orb path till you reach a teal (or blue or green depending on how you see it) door and enter. In this small hallway some Pride enemies will appear in a quick fight. Again watch out for the walls as a Pride enemy may be walking through the wall and smack you with their scythe when you can’t see them at first. Head around the corner and enter the next room at the far end. A small camera cut will show you where you need to go and then show you quite a few Enigmas waiting for you. Be careful as again from a distance these guys can be deadly later on. Dodge what you can and get up and personal with them with Rebellion or Cerberus (whichever you prefer) and if you can with Rebellion launch some strikes that can stun all the Enigmas at once. Also be aware there are some Enigmas above you to the right and left on the upper platform so don’t forget to dispatch them too. Some Lust enemies will also start joining the fight but always get rid of Enigmas first before focusing on them. Finishing this fight will unlock the seal on the door at the top of the small set of stairs (opposite of the one you entered).\n\nThe next room will be filled with a few statues along with an emblem on the wall you can light up. Go around and break the statues first. For reference the statues are actually chess pieces that you will get more familiar with later (the ones in this room consist of the Pawns and Bishops). The chess pieces sit on an elevator which is the main reason you need to dispose of them. There is also a red orb statue in the back to pad you pockets a bit more for abilities and items. Once they are gone light up the emblem and jump on the platform in the middle the chess pieces were on to ascend to the next room. Reaching the top will start another red seal mandatory fight with another new enemy, Gluttony. These demons work a lot like Pride, and are not particularly fast. Their main attack is at a distance they will rear back and start spewing dust/sand from their mount straight at you. The attack has a decent distance so keep an eye on them at all times and make sure you don’t get caught off guard by this. More will spawn by the red seal door along with Sloth enemies eventually. Try to get them all away from the door as the red seal hand will come out and hurt you if you fight to close to it. Once all the enemies are defeated there are some red orbs above where the elevator came up (just jump to get them) and above the exit door is a blue orb slice. You need to jump on the top of the gate, then onto the pipe, and then double jump to get it. Might take a few tries but it shouldn’t be too hard.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 4/32\n\nOnce you exit you will be back in the main part of the tower again where you started the mission, only up higher. The camera will pan and show you the yellow door you need to reach to exit. Head around the stairs and enter the door collecting some more red orbs along the way. The next room will have both doors sealed and no enemies in sight to fight. Head up the stairs to Dante's left to solve that issue and trigger a fight with a large group of Wrath, Lust, and Sloth demons. Once defeated you will gain access to a teleport pad and be brought up to the two doors where you fell but now their seals are broken. Enter the large red door to start your next boss fight.\n\nBoss Battle: Gigapede\n\nThis is probably one of the easiest if not the easiest boss battles of the whole game so enjoy it now while it lasts.\n\nSo here is the rule with Gigapede, don’t stand under him and let him come to you. Gigapedes attacks and moves are based on where you are in relation to him and what you are doing. There really isn’t a consistent pattern in which he flies but I tend to stay near the door where you came in (above the cave that goes under the door). Gigapede will fly around the room going from one cave to the next. Where you are often determines which cave Gigapede will come out of or go into each time he emerges. Mainly if you stay by the door you entered and chill above that cave Gigapede will often A) Go into that cave from the other side of the room and more importantly B) come out from that cave when he emerges. As for attacks Gigapede mostly focuses on attacks when you are below him. He has the ability to electrify literally anything underneath him with an insane amount of lightning bolts (everything would be light blue in color) and also he can generate up to 8 large purple orbs that will seek you out and put a hurt on you. Normally these only show up if you are standing below him (the orbs can be generated when you are riding him as well, but we will cover that in a bit). As a defense for riding Gigapede (standing on him that is) he will electrify his body before doing a corkscrew move to get you off.\n\nThat is pretty much it for dangers. You will notice of course that Gigapede has a head and that is what you are aiming for (you can hurt him by hitting his body but the head will do some more damage from what I have been able to tell. The goal is when he goes into the cave below you, jump on his back and hit him a few times before he goes all the way in. If you see electricity going throughout his body jump back off and up to the ledge in front of the door above and wait. When he emerges again (hopefully right below you) as soon as his head shows up jump down right between his head and first portion of his body and bash on his head. As usual he will eventually corkscrew around to throw you off so just jump off and abandon the attacks at that point. Each time you leave him go back to your starting point in front of the red door (not too close however as the red hand can smack you around). Every now and again the purple orbs may be generated while you are riding him buy normally don’t show up until he is about to do his corkscrew move so as long as you are running away back to the start point each time they shouldn’t really be an issue. I was able to get through this fight most of the time without getting hit more than once. This strategy may take a bit of time (especially on higher difficulties) but is the best and safest approach for Gigapede. When you defeat him you will earn the following achievement and the seals will be lifted on both ends of the room.\n\nPest Control\n\nDMC3:Defeated Gigapede\n\nHead now to the far end of the room (away from the red door we camped at) and enter the room there and inspect the glowing object in this small room to pick up the Astronomical Board. Doing this and then moving away will finish the mission. Enjoy the cut scene; it is entertaining (at least it was to me).\n\nMission 5: Of Devils and Swords\n\nI would highly recommend changing your style to Trickster at the mission start menu if you are not in it already for a few things coming up. Starting off in this mission you will be introduced to another new enemy, the Blood Goyles. While they are red and flying you can’t really hurt them. They will dive bomb you constantly and in large packs can be annoying. They only way to hurt them is to shoot them with your gun of choice to turn them into statues briefly and then bash them up with your melee weapon of choice. For now Ebony and Ivory will do just fine to shoot them (the shotgun at close range is an almost guaranteed one hit to get them into statue mode so that works well too) and then just mess them up afterwards. They are more dangerous combined with other enemies or in large packs but in the end not that terrifying. Once the blood goyles are dealt with a large portal will appear in the middle of the room. Go to it to start your first of a few battles with…\n\nBoss Battle: Jester\n\nWith the exception of this fight, Jester is an optional boss battle at different times during the game. Since there is an achievement for defeating him in every available fight we are going to focus on that in this run. Jester is at least very predictable and has a set pattern. Right away he will dodge everything you throw at him and dance around bullets. Once you exhaust him from dodging bullets he stands still for a few combo moves before teleporting to the middle of the arena. You will see three portals appear above him that will start releasing what looks like large electricity balls. They will float around the arena at random movements. Jester then repeats the first two sets of this routine, but when he teleports the next time he will have a single portal above his head that shoots electricity balls out in rapid succession (normally 4 at a time) that spread out as they hurl across the arena at you. After again doing the dodging moves and being open to combos on the third teleport he will send orbs out again that will act like bouncy balls covering a good portion of the arena. That is his whole routine.\n\nSo of course the good news is Jester is predictable, the bad news is the orb movements are not so you need to be able to dodge them. This is why I recommended Trickster is the dash can work wonders here along with your up jump invincibility frames. If you focus on using the dash when you are about to get hit and keep shooting at Jester when the orbs are out you can avoid getting hit through most of this fight. Just keep shooting at him when the orbs stop and when he is winded open up a can of whoop ass with the melee weapons as much as you can. Following this for the first fight will make things fairly easy on you.\n\nWhen Jester is defeated another portal will appear along with red orbs for smacking him around. You will be back in the Gigapede fight room and the large red door will be unsealed now so head over to it. Take a left and go out the yellow door in the next room to get back to the large stairwell and start heading up the stairs (there will be red orbs to follow) until you get to a small block that is to the left of all the cogs in the window. Interact with this to use the Astronomical Board which will activate the cogs and open up a small area down below you shown by the small cut scene. Head down to that open spot to collect Vajura. We now have to backtrack to the room that had the Enigmas in it so you are looking for the blue/teal colored door. If you head down the stairs to the right from the Vajura you will come across it fairly quickly. Enter and fight some more Pride enemies and then go in the door at the end to get back to the Living Statue room we were looking for (this is again where you first fought the Enigmas in the tower). Head up to the second level of this room and go to the large gear above the door you entered and inspect it to use Vajura. This will raise the cage in the middle allowing you to collect the Soul of Steel and by doing so will bring in more Enigma enemies and Gluttony enemies. As always focus on the Enigmas first and try to keep them off camera if they are at a distance so they won’t shoot you if you need to fight other enemies. There will be about 4 Enigmas on the upper level and then two more plus the Gluttony enemies on the lower area. Defeating them will break the seals and from there you can head back out to the hallway (the way you came in) past the pride enemies and back into the main hallway. You are now looking for the yellow door on the higher area of the main tower. Don’t forget there is a platform in the middle of the floor now to bounce you up to the higher levels if you wish to jump up higher quickly (or if you fall down by accident). Make your way back to the yellow door and once you go in start walking over the chasm where the stairs used to be. The Soul of Steel allows you to walk on the air here to reach the door on the far side. Before you enter it equip Cerberus as there is a Combat Adjudicator to the right here that you can break for a blue orb slice with it. You need to exclusively use Cerberus to do this and be able to raise your rank to an A with the statue. Again make sure you have at least three moves you can cycle through and use consistently.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 5/32\n\nAfter finishing getting the orb place the Soul of Steel in the large door in the middle to release the seal over the door here. Enter the door and head to the back of the room where you will see an emblem you can hit and light up along with a red skull plaque. Inspect the red skull to start the next secret mission.\n\nSecret Mission 2: Untouchable\n\nThis mission is just as it sounds, you need to kill all enemies without getting hit once yourself. The fun part is that all the enemies are Enigmas to really mess with you. This was another reason I mentioned to have Trickster equipped as your style was for this mission. Start off by going right or left shooting at the nearest Enigma. When you see them getting ready to fire start dodging/dashing out of the way to the opposite side you started on and blast the other one on the far end and throw in some quick melee moves if you can. If you can take out the two Enigmas on the ends without getting hit you will be in good shape. This will probably take you a few tires but with enough practice you will get it. You can keep restarting the mission over and over if you need to (chances are however you will need health. If that is the case activate the elevator we will talk about next and kill enemies till you get a green orb then just drop down to start over the secret mission).\n\nBlue Orb Slice 6/32\n\nSecret Mission 2/12\n\nThat is it for blue orbs here. Now activate the emblem on the wall and Jump on the center platform. Pride enemies will start showing up and you need to kill them quickly or they will weigh down the elevator and you will have to start over again at the bottom. Shouldn’t be too difficult. Once you reach the top follow the path till you come to another shop statue and some breakable objects. Here it is up to you whether to stick with Trickster or Swordmaster (I recommend Swordmaster but really is up to your style). Buy some moves or blue orbs if you like (however I would recommend saving some orbs for something coming soon) and then enter the door and walk ahead to trigger a scene followed by a particularly nasty boss fight.\n\nBoss Battle: Agni & Rudra\n\nThis is what I meant by this game has some brutal boss battles. Chances are you have little to no health as of now unless you grinded for orbs early and now you have to worry about not one, but TWO guys at once. Let’s go over their attacks and some things that will be your downfall if you don’t know about them.\n\nEach has their own full health bar so no small favors there. You will notice each health bar is flanked by a red or blue tab so you can tell who you need to beat up on(more on this during the strategy). Agni (red) & Rudra (blue) always start by running to one of the far ends of the room and space out on the right then left. Once there each one will rush at you one at a time and do some sort of air slamming attack directly at you with their sword. Once they have both charged you normally the one closest to you will attack. They can either do a direct swipe at you or a sort of “stinger” move where they dash at you with their sword. These attacks can be parried if your timing is spot on. They also will block you often if you do not hit them from behind and just spam attacks. Every now and again you will also see either one step back and run their hand along the sword (setting it on fire for Agni and adding wind for Rudra) to power themselves up. This will add a new devastating attack to their arsenal when this happens. Angi will shoot a fire whirlwind at you and also jump in the air and attempt to squash you with fire with his sword. Rudra does a similar tornado attack close to him and also can try to squash you. The worst thing that can happen is once you kill one of them, the other will take the sword of the fallen brother and go into ape shit mode bringing death to all around him. This super brother will jump right at you and smash the ground with an area attack of wind and fire, spin both swords furiously at you and do other sorts of surrounding area attacks like throwing the swords to create about 6-10 explosions around the area in front of him, creating a wind vortex to protect himself, and other nasty dashing attacks. The moral of this story is NEVER let one of the brothers get both of the swords or you are going to end up dead.\n\nSo how do we accomplish this? As I mentioned above you need to keep a close eye on the health bars of both brothers and keep them EVEN as much as possible. If you have been beating down Agni, start focusing on Rudra on purpose to get his health bar to the same level and vice versa. When one brother is near death, DO NOT KILL HIM! Start focusing on the other brother completely and be cautious of where the other brother is so you don’t accidentally hit him. Focus on attacks from behind if you can for safety reasons and always keep an eye on the other brother if they plan on lunging at you (also remember if the other brother is off screen chances are they will not attack you). If you are able to parry their attacks it is possible to knock the sword out of their hands and stun them for a long period of time and thus opening them up to a devastating combo. When they run to the other end to attack again, shoot at the one with more health to keep leveling the health bars out. The BEST thing to learn her is your jump invincibility frames. When the brother charge at you, jump before they are about to hit you and you will laugh at them as you get away without a scratch. Every time they are going to swipe at you do the same thing, just keep in mind you are only invincible on your way up. When either one puts the element on their sword make sure you are extra aware of their attacks and parry them if you can so you can nullify the element on their sword.\n\nOnce both brothers are down to a sliver of health each, go ahead and land the killing blow on one and then ASAP kill the other to prevent them going into insane mode. Best time to start the killing blows is right after they charge at you from one side of the room to start their whole attack routine (otherwise the other brother may retreat to the far end of the room before you can put him down).\n\nFor finishing this fight and completing the mission, you get the sweet new swords Agni & Rudra (which have some of the best moves in the game but is debatable as always) along with the following achievement.\n\nDouble Trouble\n\nDMC3:Defeated Agni and Rudra\n\nMission 06: Family Ties\n\nNo Michael J. Fox does not exist in this mission (holy crap I am dating myself here). Before this mission begins I would suggest looking into some of the abilities for Agni & Rudra to consider buying one or two of them. Not only is it a helpful weapon to use in the game but you will need some decent moves for a combat adjudicator coming up. You begin this mission heading up some stairs to a statue in the middle that is holding a glowing object. If you jump on top of the statue you can get some hidden red orbs. Keep heading straight into the door on the other side of the room. In this room are three trials that are symbolized by the blue, red, and green colors on each pedestal. They are an agility trial, strength trial (green), and wisdom trial. We are going to do all three to get a weapon a little bit later. We will start with the strength trial so head up the green path.\n\nThe strength trial is mostly just a fight with a twist. You will face a variety of the enemies you have seen thus far in the game but they will be invincible unless you activate two emblems on either side of the room. You can tell the enemies are invincible as they have a purple haze that surrounds them when it is active (which is also how they will look when they go into devil trigger mode on higher difficulties). From here the challenge is straight forward, keep the emblems activated when they die out and kill all enemies. You will face Pride, Wraith, Sloth, Lust, and Gluttony enemies throughout the fight. Once they are all defeated the walls that were raised at the beginning will lower and you can collect the Essence of Fighting item. One down, two to go. We will go up the middle path next which is the trial of agility. There will be spikes coming down the corridor at you in different patterns that make you either have to walk to the left or right, or jump over spikes on the left or right. You just need to keep an eye on where the gaps are coming at you down the path to prepare for what you need Dante to be. Just keep at it and you will make it all the way to the next item which is the Essence of Technique. Once you grab the item some Blood Goyles and Gluttony enemies will show up on your way back to the entrance. Take care of the enemies as you head back and once you exit now we will head to the third and last path on the far left for the trial of wisdom. This trial is very simple as it follows the riddle of the sphinx. For any who are not familiar it is the riddle “What creature walks on four legs in the beginning, two legs in the middle, and 3 legs at the end?” or something along those lines. The riddle here is shown by the doors in each room and the red lights above each door. Go through the wrong door and you get put in a fight and have to restart the “maze”. The progression is easy…go through the door with the 4 red lights above it first, then the one with 2 red lights, then last the one with 3 red lights. In the middle of the room once you have entered all three doors will be the item Essence of Intelligence. Grab it and head back out the single light door and return to the statue in the beginning of this mission. On one side of the statue you can inspect it and place all three Essence items into it to blow open a new path in the room to proceed and by having all three items you will cause it to drop a new weapon, the Artemis. It is a ranged weapon that I never really used, but feel free to experiment with it if you wish. Head through the new door that the rubble was cleared away from.\n\nIn this next room right to Dante's left is a combat adjudicator for Agni & Rudra. For this one you need to raise your style meter up to A to break it and get another blue orb slice. Again make sure to switch between at least 3 different types of attacks (normal attacks, holding back and then pressing Y to do a high rise type attack, and if you purchased it a stinger like attack) and keep the same progression as you alternate between these type of attacks.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 7/32\n\nHead up the path from the statue and around the corner (picking up a red orb or two along the way) to get a cut scene that will end the mission.\n\nMission 07: A Chance Meeting\n\nRight as the mission starts there are a lot of red orbs to get back down the last hallway. There are large red orbs above each archway and a few to the side of the door we entered. Collect what you want (I would get all you can since there will be many abilities to buy) and then head to the door by the rubble. Jump up beside the door to reach and alcove with a red light in it and inspect it to find yet another secret mission.\n\nSecret Mission 3: Death From Above\n\nThis is another unique mission in which the only goal is to stay in the air for 20 seconds or more. There is a neat trick on how to do this fairly easily. The room this is done in is similar to the wisdom trial room and the only enemies that get warped in are Pride enemies. Head to the corner closest to you and hug one of the corners and start jumping in the corner using wall hike. Over time all the Pride enemies will come over to you and be trying to hit you. If you time your jumps when you land on them you will start jumping off the enemies along with wall/air hiking. Once the enemies are all below you just keep jumping off of them hugging that corner the whole time and you should be able to stay in the air by jumping off them for 20 seconds with no problems. Once you hit 20 seconds you will pass the mission and receive a blue orb slice.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 8/32\n\nSecret Mission 3/12\n\nOnce the secret mission is complete head through the door right next to where the mission ended. Drop to the bottom of this next long tower room and enter the door at the very bottom of the tower to go into a library. There will be a blue seal that shows up to indicate a puzzle to solve how to leave this room. You will notice some statues along the outer walls as you go around the room and some will have some blue lighting to them. Once you hit these statues they will start moving and attack you. These are the chess piece enemies, which there will be one for every chess piece on a normal chess board. For now, these are only the Damned Pawns. The move towards you and when their swords turn from blue to red they will slash them in a downward fashion that would best be avoided. This is their only attack and they are quite harmless unless you are not paying attention to them. Just watch for the attack and get away before they hit you. When you reach a group of 3 Damned Pawns (I will just call them Pawns going forward. It is easier and also more PG) one of them will move when it attacks you and show a sparkle underneath of it. Grab this item to get the Orihalcon Fragment and continue to destroy the rest of the Pawns in the room for more red orbs if you wish. Getting the fragment will release the blue seal and allow you to exit. Once you leave the library use the jump pads to ascend the tower to the very top (collecting a holy water on one level along the way if you wish) and enter the green door at the top of the tower. In this next small hallway there is yet another blue orb slice on the archways above the small stairwell. Start by jumping on the arches on from the top of the stairs and work your way to the blue orb slice. You may fall quite a few times but at least you will also get red orbs along the way. Just keep trying and you will get there.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 9/32\n\nGo through the next door to run into some more Pawns in the long hallway up. Once they are dealt with take a left down a side hallway and pick up a Vital Star S on the right before entering another door. The red seals will be another dead giveaway that a fight is to be had. When you approach the altar there will be a new demon that appears that is holding a very large looking object. This is Greed. Greed can actually along with Enigmas be one of the most dangerous regular enemies in the whole game. Their attacks are easy to predict and see. They will take their large looking casket and swing it at you and then plant it in the ground for a bit. That is it for attacks, so you may think to yourself “You crazy guide writer, they are not dangerous at all!” The real problem the pose is they summon other enemies constantly each time they plant their casket in the ground. Throughout the game they can summon Pride, Lust, or Sloth enemies until you kill them. For this reason whenever you see a group of enemies with Greed among them KILL GREED FIRST! The last thing you need is a room full of endless demons smashing you from all directions. Anyways, deal with the all the Greed enemies and all their summoned friends to have an item drop down and unseal the doors. Pick up the item at the altar for a Siren’s Shriek and then exit through the large doors directly across from the altar. In this room there will be a small staircase and to the right of that is yet another combat adjudicator for Rebellion. I hope you have been practicing your move switches because you need to get this one up to a SSS combo to break it open for the blue orb. High time, downward slash, round tip combo, million stabs, and regular hits are a great group of moves to cycle through in the same order. This will take some practice and it might help to write down what you plan on doing in what order and then keep a mental note on what move you are doing and what is the next move after to make sure you keep cycling 3 different moves before getting back to the first one. Million stab is a great move to end with to get the gauge from SS to SSS but again just keep at it and you will be able to pull off the SSS style ranking.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 10/32\n\nThat is it for the blue orbs in this level. Now head up the stairs and inspect another altar to open a gate to an elevator. Get on the elevator that just opened at it will bring you all the way back to the very first part of the tower you entered after you fought Cerberus. Head to the center and up the left stairs to the swirling fire that is in front of a door and use the Siren’s Shriek to put the fire out. Now that you put the fire out head through the door and take a slight detour to the left to grab a gold orb and the go back up the other direction and take care of some Lust enemies and a Wraith before entering the next room. This room will have a breakable wall that leads to an emblem. Activate the emblem and a ball will hang down from a chain in the middle of the room. You need to bash this ball open for another item, which you can do by hitting and then projecting where it is going to swing or you can take the cheap approach and jump on the ball first and just ride it while you smash it. Either way works. Grab the Crystal Skull item that it drops to start a fight with Greed and Lust demons. As always focus on Greed first and then clear out Lust after no more enemies can be spawned. Backtrack all the way back to the elevator you used to get here, and then backtrack some more to the room where you picked up the Siren’s Shriek from the altar for anther fight with Greed and Pride enemies, finishing with a Hell Vanguard fight for fun. Use your same strategies that you did back in Mission 2 to deal with the Hell Vanguard. The seal will be broken and you can now exit back into the hallway you fought the Pawns in. Down this hallway make a left and use the Crystal Skull on the pillar by the door to continue with the level. Outside there will be a red orb statue you can wail on for some more currency. As you head along there is another shop statue that I highly recommend you visit and purchase the Rebellion move Stinger (if you don’t have it already) and change your fighting style to Trickster if you are not using it already. Head through the doors and up the stairs for an epic encounter with…\n\nBoss Battle: Vergil\n\nBrother vs brother here. This fight is actually not that hard if you know what to expect from Vergil. He is fast, he teleports often, and he can combo you quickly and inflict a lot of damage if you let him. On the plus side Vergil gives you lots of openings to combo him; you just have to show some restraint and only use a few moves and not get caught trying to go all out on him.\n\nVergil will start from a distance and then teleport right next to you and start a three slash combo with his weapon Yamato. Once he finishes his final slash he will slowly put Yamato back in its sheath. You can get about 6-7 hits in on Vergil before he parries you and then does a stinger like move that knocks you over right afterwards (hence why you want to show some restraint and make sure you don’t keep getting caught by that move). You can sometimes combo him again for another one or two hits afterwards but Vergil will quickly parry you and then hit you with a 2 or 3 combo slash. If you try to shoot Vergil from a distance he often will spin Yamato and block all your shots with that as well. As the fight goes along and Vergil is hurt more, he will start a ranged slash move that has a low sound that precedes it. It will normally show Vergil slash and then a purple orb appears away from him that does about 5 slashes in it. You will want to dash/roll away from this as it happens.\n\nThat is really all of Vergils attacks in this fight. The problem most folks have is they think he is a pushover or get cocky and rush in and just try to mash him to death with attacks. Those folks end up not dodging in the fight and get killed. So here is the simple strategy. Shoot Vergil till he teleports to you and then dash away from his three move slash. Stinger him and hit him another 5-6 times before dashing back and letting him either A) Teleport next to you again repeating step one B) Attempt to Stinger you in which case you dash again and follow up with one or two hits or C) Start the three hit slash combo that you dodge and then hit him again 5-6 times (this only happens if you are close to him when you back up). As a rule, if Vergil every parries you GET OUT OF THERE! You cannot win a parry battle with him and unlike Hells Vanguard there will only be one parry before he gets the jump on you and wins that battle. The parry is actually a good opportunity to dash away from an attack and then follow up with another 2-3 hits on Vergil. Once the fight has worn on and he starts doing his ranged attacks, dash to the side of each of his ranged slash and then stinger towards him to interrupt it and get another 4-6 hits in on him. Stinger is great for this as it can help negate this move all together and help make the fight shorter at the end. If you are patient and time your attacks and counter attacks wisely you can get through this fight no problem and possibly not even get hit (learning all this will help A LOT on DMD mode). Once the fight is over, you will earn the following achievement and the mission will end.\n\nSibling Rivalry\n\nDMC3:Survived an encounter with Vergil\n\nMission 8: A Renewed Fear\n\nAfter a long cut scene you will be inside a very large monster. As the previous scenes showed you access to devil trigger has finally been granted to you as well. Consider start buying a purple orb or two to help with some fights later on in the game. As for this new environment, stay out of any liquid as it will hurt you (it represents stomach acid, so the gross factor should keep you out of there anyway) and most of the doors will have to be hacked open. Think back to what hell/the underworld looked like in DMC 1 and this is very similar in many ways. Right away there are a few blue orbs you can take a stab at (one we may have to wait on due to lack of a certain item right now). To get started there is an odd looking pillar right next to Dante when you start the mission. Hack it and you will see an opening in the wall that is covered by multiple spikes/veins/whatever the heck those things are that do not allow you to enter. One of these will retract when you hit the object so the goal for now become clear, find all the other pillars and hit them till you can pass through the door. Keep on the ledge and move to the other end for the next pillar, but do not drop down afterwards. There is ship a bit off in the distance if you keep going along the ledge that you can see. With a very well timed double jump and trickster air dash (if you unlocked that yet or you can get it later on another play through when we have the weapon that allows us to buy and use air raid where you can fly over there) you can jump onto the ship and snag yet another blue orb slice. Try the air hike jump a few times and you should be able to get it.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 11/32\n\nI am going to point out the next secret mission even though chances are we will not be able to complete it yet. Jump off the ship once you get the last blue orb slice and you should see a few boards blocking an opening under the ship leading to a large stone tablet. Break the boards and inspect the tablet to start the next secret mission.\n\nSecret Mission 04: Devil’s Teetor-totter\n\nI personally think that name is hilarious as the devil on a teetor-totter as a mental image is just ridiculous. Anyways, the point of this mission is you will activate the elevator that is just like an earlier mission, and as you go up Pride enemies will come down and weight the elevator down. If you have more than 4 enemies on the lift it will fall to the bottom and you have to restart the elevator. On top of that all of the enemies will be in Devil Trigger mode which gives them more health and makes them harder to kill and stun. With our limited strength and abilities this can be quite a challenge and problem right now. I would suggest till waiting till another playthough (the next one actually) when we have the rocket launcher to blow enemies off the edge quickly as they drop down. If you want to try destroying them quickly with just your normal weapons go nuts, but just be warned it is very VERY hard to do so without the rocket launcher. If you did make it to the top, congrats and enjoy your blue orb slice. I will remind us of this secret mission later but will count it for the walkthrough sake.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 12/32\n\nSecret Mission 4/12\n\nNow on the bottom of the cave head away from the ship avoiding the green puddles and find another pillar before a bus. 2 more to go at this point. Jump over the bus and avoid more green acid and turn right into a small tunnel to lead you to an acid waterfall and the 4th pillar. Jump up the right side of the room here and work your way up to a bridge leading to a red orb statue and the final pillar on the far right. Drop down grabbing more red orbs as you go and head to the top of the bus which is right where the opening you just freed up is. Head down a long hallway avoiding more acid as you go and pass a shop statue (grab Cerberus as your secondary weapon real quick while you are here since you will need it shortly)and then slice through the next “door.” Take a mental note of this next room is behind the membranous wall is the boss for this level. We don’t have the item to fight it now so just run on past it and through the next doorway. As you run down the next hall a worm like create will chase you that you can fight or run from. This is a great chance to make full use of the jump invincibility frames. Let the worm catch up to you and just jump each time it takes a bite at you and then slash at it with your sword. You will be able to kill it really quickly and if you jump above it after it dies earn a few more red orbs. If you feel like running from it instead no big deal. As soon as you can turn to Dante's right and slash through another door do so. You are now in another hallway where you will fight more enemies…Envy. These guys are just like Pride and should be attacked the same way. They really don’t pose much of a threat but can be an issue in large groups. Once the group of Pride demons are dealt with head down the long path and enter another door to reach a room where the center is pulling red orbs into it. More Pride demons will show up and you will have to kill quite a few of them in order to have the center open up and reveal the Ignis Fatuus item that you will need to collect. Once you have this the lights will go out in the level and the exit to the room (which is the way you came in) will open up. As you head back the way you came, keep an eye on your left on the way back. You will pass two optional paths on your left you could detour down. Look for the second one that you come to and head down to find a Cerberus combat adjudicator. You will need a SS combo to break this one open and get another blue orb slice. The same rules keep applying and hopefully you have bought enough moves to have enough to cycle through to get your style meter that high. Swordmaster style helps a lot with this since the B button is another unique attack in many cases.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 13/32\n\nGo back and keep heading way down the path till you enter another doorway. Another worm will start chasing you that you can run from or kill. I again choose to kill it but it really is up to you. At the end of the path enter the door to Dante's right and you will find yourself in the main room you first started in, only Pride enemies are all over the place now. Head back through the door above the bus and avoid the pools of acid on your way down the hallway again till you reach the shop statue. Switch your style to Swordmaster and equip Rebellion and Agni & Rudra before going in the last door. You are back in the boss room I pointed out earlier and this time use the Ignis Fatuus to be able to reach it.\n\nBoss Battle: Heart of Leviathan\n\nYup, this boss battle is against a few major organs. There are a few things to this fight. First of all Pride demons will keep spawning constantly and never stop no matter how many you kill so get used to them. You will also notice three health bars for the boss at the bottom. The top long one is the center heart which is your goal to destroy all the way. The two smaller bars represent the left and right organs (red one is left and blue one is right as they are on screen). Each of the side organs do a different thing to screw Dante over. The right organ sucks up your entire devil trigger gauge if left unchecked. The left red organ sucks up all orbs dropped by Pride demons that get killed which rob you of gaining more health from green orbs dropped or any red orbs at all. Both suck and you have to pick the lesser of two evils. The middle organ is invincible until you “destroy” either the left or right organ. The middle one will either turn green at this point and be vulnerable to attacks or turn red and shoot a red laser beam or beams sweeping across the floor of the room. While the other two organs are both active the center can also still shoot out its red laser beam. The only positive to the beam is it kills the Pride demons too. The center heart can also release three blue electricity balls out that will slowly home in on Dante which you will have to run and dodge to avoid.\n\nSo this is a really good time to learn a new style of attacking and also learning how to cancel moves and do frame canceling. The reason you wanted Rebellion and Agni & Rudra for this boss is they are the second best combination to do this particular frame cancel attack (there is another weapon that is best used with Agni & Rudra but we haven’t gotten it yet unfortunately). Here is the technique. Of the two organs I would suggest picking the right (blue) one to knock out so you keep your devil trigger gauge intact for when you can attack the middle. You really can do either one but it is just my suggestion. Go right up to the organ you are picking to start off with and do a double air hike jump, and then quickly (with very slight hesitation) hit to attack, to switch weapons, right away to attack with the other weapon, to switch weapons, to attack, and keep repeating. This needs to be done fairly quickly but with just a little hesitation before each button press. If done right, Dante will almost hover in the air and slowly descend while constantly hitting the organ alternating the two weapons. This will keep you above the Pride demons while you destroy the side organ and also keep you above the red laser if the middle decides to shoot it out. It is a GREAT tactic to learn here for this boss. Once the side organ is done for go and attack the middle. You can use the same hover cancel attack to keep above the pride demons and go nuts on the middle heart till the side organ gets rejuvenated and then just keep repeating. It really can be that easy. Can you beat the Heart of Leviathan by staying on the ground and just watching the Pride demons and being cautions to dodge while hitting the organs? Yes you can, but the hover method is sooooooo much easier and good practice that starts leading into advanced combos later in the game where you switch weapons in mid combos and commands to string together devastating moves.\n\nOnce you beat the Heart of Leviathan the mission will end with another cut scene and you will earn the following achievement.\n\nInside Out\n\nDMC3:Defeated the Heart of Leviathan\n\nMission 09: Faded Memories\n\nSo a heads up before you start this mission, if you have not already gotten your Trickster level up to 2 yet there is a blue orb that you will be unable to get here. Again if you are not able to do it don’t fret as you can always grab the orb on another run.\n\nAfter the cut scenes head the only way that is available to you across the bridge and into the next room. In here you will start a mandatory fight against some new enemies, the Arachne. They are pretty much big tough spiders that can swipe at you with their claws and pincers, climb the walls and pounce on you, and shoot webs at you to freeze you in place to make you easier to attack. All of those things suck of course. The good news is they are weak to fire, so Agni & Rudra are great against these guys. The green versions of Arachne are just a little more powerful and can take a bit more damage. They can be stunned and combos do work well on them but just keep an eye out so you can dodge their lunges at you. Just stay mobile and dodge. When they are all defeated the red seals will be released and we can proceed. Once in the next area you will see a shop statue to your left as you enter the outside area. Just above and to the left of this statue is an alcove that you can only reach with level 2 Trickster active. You need to double jump as high as you can go and the air dash at the peak into the alcove to reach a blue orb slice hidden away up there. Again if you can’t grab it now make sure you go for it on another run later.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 14/32\n\nA little further ahead you will see a small light puzzle. The goal here is to direct the light beam from the starting point to the other statue holding a mirror. The only thing you can do is destroy the reflectors that point the light different directions or reset the puzzle to the beginning by hitting the emblem on the far side of this platform. These puzzles are not hard, and I always find it easiest to work backwards from where you want the light to go to figure them out (very helpful for the later puzzles like these that are much larger and complex). I am sure you can solve this on your own, but for those that want the quick solution, here it is in the spoiler below.\n\nThis will break the blue barrier and allow you to go through the next door. Before you do make sure you jump and stand on the tombstone right before the puzzle for some bonus red orbs. This next long area is going to suck on higher difficulties. There is a long path that goes all the way up and then comes back down with quite a few Enigma enemies on either side of the paths shooting at you. Run and dodge as fast as you can up the path towards the first lone Enigma at the top of the path before it turns to the right. Another Enigma will spawn on the bridge as you start to head to the right and down the next path. Finally there will be 3 Enigmas on your route to the last door. Get used to this area as a secret mission will be in this exact setup later that we will have to deal with. Head through the door at the end of the path and into the next room with saw blade pillars and two Greed enemies standing in the middle. Proceed to fight Greed with caution to stay away from the pillars while dodging his attacks. Once all the Greed and summoned Pride enemies are dead keep going till you reach another large area outside. There are many red orbs to be had here starting to the right of the screen (or Dante's left as he is exiting the door). Jump over the lower break in the wall on the side to grab some red orbs on the ground. Afterwards jump on the broken section of the wall and then hike up to the upper area to find some more red orbs and a green orb as well. Now we can head the other direction to the next door on the right wall next to the shop statue. Before entering the door however keep going around past the waterfall and jump up the pillar on the left side of the platform for another red orb. From there jump on the larger platform a little farther down and you will see a blinking item you can pick up. This is Spiral, another ranged weapon that is like a rifle that frankly I never found any use for. Now backtrack to the door and enter.\n\nThe next hallways have more blade pillars and Enigma enemies shooting at you from either end of them. Use the pillars to your advantage and wait until the Enigma is done firing to run around them and take the Enigma out. Repeat the process with the next Enigma and head through the large door and collect the item in this room, Ambrosia. This starts yet another fight with more Arachne so remember to use fire on them to help shorten the fight some. Backtrack all the way back to the waterfall near the shop statue taking out the Enigmas on the way again. Run through the waterfall to reach a cave hidden behind it. Go to the right a little and look for a small opening a little above Dante on the wall of the cavern. There should be a red light glowing from it. Head to the source of the red light and inspect it to find another secret mission.\n\nSecret Mission 5: Destroyer\n\nThis mission may take you a few tries, but the good news is there is a 0% chance of you getting hurt at all during it. Remember the little bar you went into during mission 3 when you first grabbed the shotgun? You are going back to this bar and you have 40 seconds to destroy all 50 items in the room. This is why I pointed out early on to take a mental note of where the breakable items are. You need to be quick. I will break down the best path and items you should be smashing.\n\n1) Marketing sign next to the door and where you start\n\n2 & 3) Two tables right in front of starting point\n\n4 – 8) Whiskey bottles along the ledge on left wall from start\n\n9 & 10) Table next to pillar in center of room (across from whiskey bottles)\n\n11 – 15) The 5 stools in front of the bar\n\n16 – 18) 3 Barrels on top of bar roof\n\n19 – 26) All the bottles on the back right panel of the bar\n\n27 – 32) All the bottles on the back left panel of the bar\n\n33 & 34) Barrels on the floor behind the bar against the wall\n\n33 – 40) All the bottles hanging on the rack on the front side of the bar\n\n41 – 43) Three barrels to the right of the entrance behind the bar\n\n44 – 48) Three machines and barrels leading to the hidden wall emblem (to the right of the last three barrels)\n\n49 & 50) Two barrels leading to the exit to the club, next to where you found the shotgun on the wall\n\nDo all this in 40 seconds or less and another blue orb slice will appear for you. Again it will probably take a few tries but keep at it and you will succeed eventually.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 15/32\n\nSecret Mission 5/12\n\nBack in the cavern, backtrack to the waterfall and follow the path down until you run into a few Pride and Glutton demons. Fight them all off and then keep down the path till you reach a statue that you can place the Ambrosia in to reveal a new door. Enter inside to meet your next challenge…\n\nBoss Battle: Nevan\n\nHere is another fun and challenging boss battle where you need to learn the patterns in which the boss will attack you and how to prepare for them. As far as weapons and styles go, you probably will want trickster to give yourself a little extra hang time for one attack but you really can use any style you are comfortable with here.\n\nAs usual let’s start with Nevans attacks and patterns. Everything Nevan does focuses on electrical based attacks. She will start by teleporting to either the stage or the door you entered (it will always be which location is farthest away from you) and you will notice she is surrounded by bats or some sort of shield. She is unable to be hurt properly while the bats are circling her and you need to remove this “barrier” to get some real damage in with melee attacks. Every time she teleports she regenerates this shield as well. Get in close when she teleports and she will do a swirl standing attack that uses her cape like a blade. She will rotate a few times and then stop, giving you an opening to attack her some more. Nevan will follow up afterwards while floating around by shooting multiple electricity balls that home in on you which need to be dodged. Before I start getting into her pattern too much let me finish the attacks. Nevan also can have blades rise out of the floor like spikes at you sort of like the shadows attacks from DMC 1. You just need to run to avoid these. She also can teleport to one side of the room and you will see the floor flicker like it is about to light up. She will then electrocute the entire floor for a few seconds. The only way to avoid this is to air hike high up and shoot to suspend yourself in the air, air dash with trickster to give yourself a few extra moments up in the air, or do the air cancel attack I taught you for the boss on the last mission. Either way, when she lights up the ground don’t stand on it. When you manage to take her bat shield off she will be stunned and you can get a good 6-8 hits on her. After that she will create a black hole underneath her and then teleport. If you are caught in the black hole it will damage you, so once you get your few hits in retreat to avoid this attack. Also like Griffin in DMC 1 Nevan will shoot pillars of electricity at you that you will need to dodge between if you stand far away from her often. Her final attack is sort of a sucker move. When she is really close to death, she will teleport to the middle of the room and drop her bat shield making you think “All right, I got her now and am gonna finish this fight!” This is a sucker move as she will drift towards you when she does this and grab you, sucking away your health and replenishing hers at the same time. If she teleports to the middle of the room and drops her shield when you didn’t hit her, STAY AWAY until she teleports again!\n\nSo much like other bosses in the DMC series, Nevan chooses moves based on how you fight her so you can force her to do certain moves by where you are in relation to her during the battle. For example when she first teleports if you stay far away from here and shoot at her she will start by throwing lighting balls at you right away while floating around the floor. She will always do her spinning blade attack when you are close to her unless she has just finished doing that move prior. The rest of her pattern depends on her health bar. She doesn’t start electrocuting the floor until she is roughly past a quarter of her health depleted and starts the draining move when she is around a quarter of health left total.\n\nSo here is the strategy pattern. I can’t guarantee she will always behave the same way but if you look for her attacks you should do just fine in this fight. When she first teleports get close to her with a stinger move and then back up as she starts her spinning blade attack. As soon as she stops hack away at her shield. Chances are you will not get her shield off right away and Nevan will start one of her electric distance attacks (either with the balls or with the pillars you have to dodge. Keep close and drop her shield and then devil trigger (if you have it) and get about 6-9 shots in on her. You will see the black hole under Nevan widening while she is stunned so make sure it is not too wide before you jump out of there to avoid some damage. Normally I found that as soon as you get the first good chunk of damage in on her she teleports to the other end of the room and then electrocutes the floor. Time your jump right before the shock starts, and then double jump and shoot/dash to stay in the air till it is safe to come down. Get right back in Nevans face and force her to do the spinning blade attack by keeping close and then back up and repeat the first few steps. This will be the main pattern for about 3/4ths of the fight. Once Nevan is down to the last quarter health she gets annoying since it takes time to get her shield off of her and she starts her life draining attack. It is always tempting to go and hit her when she drops her shield in the middle but stay away. If she grabs you the fight will go on much longer. Just keep picking your spots and follow up on the spinning blade attacks and after lighting based attacks till you can stun her again and finish the fight.\n\nAn amusing cut scene will occur once the fight is over, and you will get a new and complex weapon Nevan along with the following achievement.\n\nLightning In A Bottle\n\nDMC3:Defeated Nevan\n\nHead to the other door not sealed and you will trigger another scene and the chapter will end.\n\nMission 10: The Job\n\nNow that you have acquired Nevan you have what is probably the most complex of all Dantes melee weapons in your arsenal. This is one of the few I never got the hang of and couldn’t use it properly in the heat of battle. The best use I ever got out of it was using the air attack cancel move I taught you when you fought the Heart of Leviathan as Nevan is a great weapon to do that cancel move with. Experiment with it if you can, most experts of the game say it is fantastic especially for advanced combos. You still will need to learn it decently to pull off the combat adjudicator ranks needed for some blue orb slices in the game.\n\nStarting off this mission follow the short path and pick up the Stone Mask item on a small altar here. Turn around and backtrack your way out of the cave all the way through the waterfall facing some Glutton, Pride, and Sloth demons along the way. Once on the other side of the waterfall take a detour to the left (Dantes right from leaving the waterfall) to find a combat adjudicator for Nevan. You need a B rank to bust this one open. Keep alternating Nevans attacks like you do with every other weapon in cycles of three. Since Nevan has a slow response time when attacking these will be the hardest combat adjudicators to do especially when you need SS or SSS rankings to bust them up. If you are having trouble knowing the moves open the menu at the shop statue where you buy abilities for a small list of attacks. Once you succeed you will get another blue orb slice.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 16/32\n\nMake sure to keep Nevan in your inventory and possibly change styles (you may want swordmaster/trickster soon. I would recommend swordmaster but that is just me) at the shop statue and if you can buy the devil trigger ability for Nevan Air Raid for a secret mission coming up. When you are done examine the carving to the right of the door close to the shop statue to use the Stone Mask. This will raise a bridge to another large statue out across the water. Head to the statue and run to the right of it to find some skulls on the far right corner and inspect them to start another secret mission.\n\nSecret Mission 6: Flight of the Demon\n\nThe reason you need Air Raid from Nevan is for this secret mission. You need to jump and fly to collect all the red/white orbs in the air in this level in 30 seconds. Jump almost right away and get on the level with the white orb above you and activate Air raid. Grab the white orb and then fly out to the first few red orbs following the path it makes. Once you have cleared the top level of orbs go to the far wall where you can see the orbs going down a bit. Deactivate Air Raid to drop through these orbs onto a small platform and then jump again and activate Air Raid one more time flying under the archway and to the ship to get the rest of the red orbs in this area. This will almost certainly take you a few tries to finish this but remember practice makes perfect. Once you have succeeded a blue orb slice will fall from the sky so you can go collect it. Feel free to switch out Nevan for any other weapon later when you get to a shop statue again.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 17/32\n\nSecret Mission 6/12\n\nAlrighty then, now head to the front of the statue to collect the Neo-Generator. The red orbs on the far side of the area here have also respawned so feel free to pick them up too. Once that is done head through the door on the far end you first entered this outside area from. This brings you back to the room with the spinning blade pillars again and you will get trapped in here while the game introduces yet another new enemy to you, Dullahan. These are floating knights that have shields to protect them, and on top of that the shields have blades spinning around the edges of them. Other than float up and down in a direct pattern, these enemies actually don’t attack you. The closest the come to attacking you is if they rev up their shields and do a silly little dash at you, however this group won’t do that. All they really are is annoying. The only way you can hurt them is to attack them from behind so do your best to jump over them or get around them and get a slash or two on the back of them. As long as you mind your surroundings while you fight them they shouldn’t give you too many problems.\n\nWhen they are gone continue along the direction you were heading and back up the long path littered with Enigmas again. Take them out quickly while dodging and return all the way back to the bridge where we first started the last mission, fighting some more Arachne in the room that is pretty much dedicated to them (you fought Arachne in this same room in Mission 09). If you leveled up your trickster style between now and the last mission and didn’t get the blue orb in the alcove above the shop statue don’t forget to detour back there before the Arachne room. Once at the bridge Dante will automatically use the Neo-Generator to re-align the bridge and lead Dante to a new Marble hallway. This will start another cut scene and finish the mission.\n\nMission 11: Revenge\n\nGetting started head over to the large gears on the other side of the pillars directly in front of you and look out for two Enigmas, one on the left hand side guarding some red orbs and the other on the second gear behind the pillar (or center of the gear). Use this gear pillar to your advantage and take out each Enigma while shielding yourself from the other. When they are both disposed of, drop down and make your way across some more gears until you see a glowing item on a ledge on the far side of the screen. Jump up and grab it to receive a devil star. Now for a tricky jump to get the next secret mission. You can attempt this from the ledge but it is just as well to try it from the base of the last gear pillar. You want to jump up and at the peak of the jump air hike higher and then get to a higher ledge on the far side of the screen that has a large red jewel on the wall. You may need the trickster air dash to do this properly but it is possible without it. Keep trying till you reach the ledge and then inspect the large looking ruby to start another secret mission.\n\nSecret Mission 7: Hang 10\n\nThis is one of the more annoying/challenging secret missions that you will do. Remember that long pathway from mission 9 with all the Enigmas on it I told you to get used to because it was part of a secret mission? This is it. You have 30 seconds to get all the way around to the other door where the blue orb sits along with having Gluttony demons in your way. I highly recommend having a decent sized devil trigger bar for this one to help give you a good speed boost here. This is the goal unless you have unlocked the super unfair Dante character for beating Dante Must Die mode (which we clearly haven’t yet) you are going to devil trigger right away and get as far as your fast legs will carry you which should hopefully be at least up the large ledge on the first section of the bridge. From there you want to run till you get to the small bridge connecting to the other side and knock the Gluttony demon to the ground and then jump on him to ride him like a skate board (haven’t told you about this move yet but it really has no other practical uses in the game other than this secret mission) and steer him down the far stairs towards the orb until your character jumps off automatically. If you are really quick and VERY good at steering while riding the demons you should be able to get the orb in time. This one may take 10 or more tries to finally get it but keep pushing forward. If you run out of devil trigger, start the secret mission and just beat up on the few Gluttony demons to refill your meter and then try again. Once you succeed be proud and collect your blue orb slice.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 18/32\n\nSecret Mission 7/12\n\nHead through the door at the bottom by the gears now, and immediately jump up the wall on the right (Dante's left) to get on some pipes and you should see another blue orb slice in an alcove far above. Keep working you way up to it using the pipes for footing and grab it.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 19/32\n\nHead down the long hallway now and about halfway down you will encounter another new enemy, the Soul Eater. These guys are quite annoying as they tend to stay in fog form instead of solid form whenever you are looking at them. The trick to getting them to appear is to look away or put your back to them and then attack quickly. If the Soul Eater happens to grab you going into devil trigger mode will release them right away. Keep working on them one at a time and you should be able to defeat them all and release the red seal on the door at the far end. Head through the door and you will notice this room gets the blue seal on the door right away indicating a puzzle to figure out. Head towards the altar in this cathedral like room and look for the red orbs above a statues weapon on the left. Jump on the weapon sticking out and use it to reach the balcony above. There will be a large square stone with faces on it to the left of where you jump up. Go to the far side of the stone and using your sword or whatever melee weapon you have equipped start hitting it towards the red light to the side of the altar. When you hit it all the way in a small scene will show that freakish looking faces on the altar are weeping bloody tears. You will need to find one more stone on the far side of the balcony. Run around the upper balcony until you see a large wall with a crack in it as you turn to the other side and smash open the wall to find the second square stone. Hit it all the way up the other side of the balcony to the second red light to the other side of the altar and it will open a path below you showing you a new door and then seal it with the red “you have to fight crap here” seal. Some Soul Eaters and a Hell’s Vanguard will show up to fight. I prefer to deal with the Hell’s Vanguard first using the usual attack patterns and strategies that we have gone over since we started fighting them. Once the Vanguard is gone focus on the Soul Eaters by again turning away from them to get them into solid from and then busting them up. Head now to the newly opened pathway and go through the door to reach an underground area. First you can hit a statue at the bottom of the stairs to reveal a drop down section to get a green orb as well as a holy water item. Jump back up and head to the far end of the lower section of the platform to find another combat adjudicator for Agni & Rudra. You should know the routine by now of how to swap attacks to bring up your style meter. For this one you need to get to a SS rank to break it open for another blue orb slice. Keep at it until you do.\n\nBlue Orb Slice 20/32\n\nJump on the cart/train now to have it take you off into a long tunnel for quite a long ride. Getting used to this will help for yet another secret mission down the road. While you are on the cart you will be attacked by Gluttony, Wrath, Pride, & Lust demons along with some Enigmas. Do you best to focus on everything on your cart and only worry about the Enigmas or Wrath demons when you are free from the melee danger on your side. With weapons that have a fairly wide attack range you should use that to your advantage to hit multiple enemies at the same time in that small area. When the cart come to a stop head up the steps to a shop statue by a large door. Make sure you are in Swordmaster style and equip Rebellion along with Agni & Rudra if you have not already. Head through the door and run toward the object in here to face…\n\nBoss Battle: Beowulf\n\nBeowulf is a tough boss as he hits hard and moves fast. One of his moves even serves as a kill all things sort of move and is almost impossible to dodge. There are a few tricks to teach you to make this fight easier but really in the end this is just going to be one of those keep grinding out and fighting him type of bosses till you succeed.\n\nStarting with attacks, Beowulf has quite a few of them to be wary of. First of all he does a cross punch followed by and uppercut that will hurt quite a bit if it connects. He can also just do a single strong swipe with one hand as well. Similar to these attacks he will swipe sideways with each arm and then pound the ground with his fist, taking a few moments to get up. Rolling away and using your jump invincibility frames is a good way to avoid all of these attacks. Once he takes a bit of damage and is stunned for a second he will say something like “I will kill you” (it is hard to make out) he will flex his wings out and do a large area of attack for a pretty big radius. If you see him get ready for this get as far away from him as you can. This marks a change in the fight and Beowulf will get down on all fours and start charging at you and around the room. If you stand far away enough from him he will stomp the ground bringing down metal cages and punch them in your direction. Dodge these and him by again rolling and using invincibility frames. Pretty much always keep on the move during these attacks. When on all fours Beowulf also may do a jumping lunge at you that you will want to again jump away from. As he reverts back to punching again he will start to do a slamming fist attack that causes a large explosion of light from where he hits the ground. The last mega move he can do is when he flexes his wings again and shoots out beams of light from his wings that all home in on you. I have yet to find a suitable way to avoid this attack, so I just try to jump through the invincibility frames with it and pray for the best.\n\nSo yeah, as I said, Beowulf moves fast and hits hard. So here are some of the tactics you should use for the fight. Keep in mind his moves are sort of random so this will be more of a general guideline for the fight and how to react based on each situation. The reason I recommended you go into swordmaster style is so you can jump in the air and hit to swipe with your sword. As soon as the fight begins dodge his punches and see if you can get up to his faces level and hit to try and nail Beowulf in the eye. This will cause him to flail wildly and swing/miss you allowing you to get another 2 or 3 attacks in on him. Do this for a bit while dodging until he is stunned. When he is stunned nail him another 3-4 times and then retreat far away before he says his I will kill you phrase and does the area of attack.\n\nNow he should be on all fours charging you. Dodge him until he starts calling down cages to smash at you and get close to him again, preferably on his side or behind him. Keep circling him and he will call cages and miss hitting them at you while you can beat him down for a bit. It is possible while doing this he may just start swinging at you like he always does again, go on all fours and run away and then pounce you, or start his smash the ground area attack. You have to just play off the situation. If he is trying to hit you go for his eye again while dodging. If he goes to pound the ground get out of the way and behind him to keep attacking if you can. If he ends up on all fours watch for the pounce and dodge, get him to start hitting cages again, and get close. Use devil trigger when you have an opening for 3 or more attacks for some extra dama"
