Between the two which one had the better climax at the end based on the build up in both gamesn.\n\nDMC3, where Dante has a final showdown with Vergil:\n\nDMC5:\n\nWhere both Dante and Nero have a final showdown with Vergil:\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#3\n\nEasily 3. It's my favourite game of the whole series, it's not even a contest. lol\n\nI give 5 the unlockable after credits cutscene though. That one's gold. Pre special edition, though. I don't really like the new dialogue they put in there in the SE.\n\nE: To explain it a bit further. 3 is very emotional for me and feels very round storywise and you can see how Dante changed a bit through the whole journey. How his motives, goals and look on things changed.\n\n5 is somewhat hype, I give it that, but the ending in itself feels forced and rushed storywise. I'm also not a fan of Nero, so it turns me off in this regard as well.\n\nTyrantGuardian\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n4,293\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#4\n\n3 was fantastic but 5 had my favorite kind of fanservice at the end. Beyond satisfying and hit every single beat I was hoping it would in ways I somehow wasn't expecting.\n\nTheWill\n\nSep 24, 2018\n\n124\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#5\n\nHonestly, I don't think 5 even comes close in regards to the story.\n\n5 is a phenomenal game, but it was tied down to being a love letter to the series (which makes sense considering the 10 year or however hiatus). The real story/characters should be expected from 6, onwards now that we've concluded the \"Sons of Sparda\" arc.\n\nDeleted member 1102\n\nAccount closed at user request\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n13,295\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#6\n\n5 broke it's own back trying to redeem Vergil at the end which ended up kinda ruining the whole thing so I give it to 3.\n\nChocobo Blade\n\nThe Wise Ones\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n2,943\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#8\n\n3 hands down. 5's ending was a mess with the only good parts being the callbacks to 3.\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#9\n\nAbsolutely 3. 5 has become one my favorite games gameplay wise but while the story had its moments, it doesn't really stick the landing and decides to focus on the wrong thing at the end.\n\n(even though Nero's sequence is absolutely incredible)\n\nJimnymebob\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n20,259\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#10\n\n3 easy. 5 has an awful end section, and Vergil is absolutely wasted there and Flanderized to hell. It's too fanservice heavy.\n\nNico and Nero in the truck was fun though.\n\n404LinkNotFound\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n9,264\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#11\n\n5 is my fave dmc game but 3 has the better story\n\nVee\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n1,571\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#12\n\n5 is an amazing game but I was let down that the story was all about Vergil.

Any \"arc\" if there was one ended with 3 which wrapped around back to 1 explaining Nelo Angelo. Everything in 5 is just a weak excuse to bring back Vergil from death.\n\nLast edited: Oct 10, 2021\n\nHost Samurai\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n12,584\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#21\n\nHard to choose, I think 3 slightly wins overall as half of DMCV's environments are red flesh rooms.\n\njaymzi\n\nJul 22, 2019\n\n6,773\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#22\n\nI think Dante vs Vergil peaked with their 1st encounter in DMC3 at the top of the tower.\n\nSento\n\nNov 1, 2017\n\n5,593\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#23\n\nI love DMC3 but I gotta give it to 5, final segment of the game was hype as fuck, specially with that music.\n\nTemascos\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n12,902\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#25\n\nDMC3\n\nThe finale to that game had a lot more emotion to it, with Lady killing Arkham who despite all her (justified) hate towards him was still her father, and the sibling rage between Dante and Vergil.\n\nVergil's redemption is a little too quick I guess for DMC5. It's an entertaining final couple of missions, but it feels a shame that V was no longer part of the story. I get the technicality that he is part of Vergil but he was a good character in his own right. As for Nero him getting his DT and arm back through sheer emotion and caring for a father he never even knew he had was a bit of a stretch.\n\nOh, and Lady and Trish's roles in DMC5 were delegated to eye candy. If you had never played the previous games you'd think Dante talking about how badass they are was completely made up. Nico was an interesting character and hopefully if there's a future game we see more of her.\n\nChumunga64\n\nJun 22, 2018\n\n15,100\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#26\n\nDMC 3 actually has a pretty decent story for an action game with some actual emotional depth and pacing\n\nDMC 5 while better gameplay wise just leaned in too hard into the memes and the self aware crap that just reminds me of platinum games stories that I just do not like\n\nRutger\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n10,767\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#27\n\n5 has the better final battle as far as the gameplay is concerned, and that's the most important part to me.\n\nNightShift\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n9,358\n\nAustralia\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#28\n\nThe build up to fighting Vergil for the last time in DMC3 is so fucking good. I don't think any game has had a better build up to a single boss fight only for it to pay off so well. Plus fighting alongside him just before that felt great too.\n\nI think DMC5 is the better game overall but Nero vs Vergil was disappointing as fuck. Having Nero suddenly be so much stronger than him sucked for both the story and especially for the gameplay. I wanted a proper fight between the two so bad.\n\nmedyej\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n6,822\n\nOct 10, 2021\n\n#29\n\nI think the insane wait for 5 puts it over the top for me.

Boss 1 was cool in how if you lower his health enough his hair falls down.\n\nOct 11, 2021\n\n#31\n\nBoss 1 was cool in how if you lower his health enough his hair falls down.\n\nWith all the fanservice and call-backs squeezed into 5, that's the one thing they didn't do.

Just imagine: Vergil revives but with his hair down. Slowly he turns around to the camera and now slicks his hair back. I'm getting goosebumps just from typing this. @o@\n\nAlso the taunt looks goofy af and comes across pretty mean spirited.

Just watching the video in the OP gives me chills.\n\nDMC3 does a lot of things right, above and beyond being a cool ass action game. That musical motif is something special.\n\nAnimeAvatar\n\nApr 28, 2021\n\n665\n\nOct 11, 2021\n\n#42\n\nDMC3 has one of the best final bosses in gaming history. So yeah that one.\n\nhydruxo\n\n▲ Legend ▲\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n20,884\n\nOct 11, 2021\n\n#43\n\nStory was completely forgettable in DMC5 so 3 wins by default.\n\nBackwardCap\n\nThe King of Games - One Winged Slayer\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n2,558\n\nOct 11, 2021\n\n#44\n\nDmc5's story only hits if you've played the other games, but 3's works on its own.\n\nDeadeyeNull\n\n▲ Legend ▲\n\nDec 26, 2018\n\n1,922\n\nOct 11, 2021\n\n#45\n\nThe build up and payoff is better in 3, but the gameplay and actual battle is more fun in 5. That has more to do with Vergil presence throughout the story of 3. I'm voting 5 because gameplay is far more important to devil may cry then story. Also for the final battle of Vergil's story in special edition which was also a ton of fun.\n\nLunatious\n\nDec 18, 2018\n\n901\n\nOct 11, 2021\n\n#46\n\nI liked DMC5's story but the final showdown with Vergil was a bit underwhelming compared to the high emotions and stakes of DMC3. The last Urizen fight should've been a way bigger deal to what it was (something like the Mundus fight in DMC1), and while I get that the last fight in 5 was all about Nero I do think it would've been cool if we got to fight Vergil & Dante at the same time as they try to keep fighting each other. Would've made that last chunk feel bigger.\n\nVillage\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n11,868\n\nOct 11, 2021\n\n#47\n\nI like both equally for different reasons.\n\nHowever 5's vergil ending is the best because it implies he would have won and helped anyway\n\nAnd that level of petty I appreciate\n\nDeadmangaming\n\nNov 24, 2020\n\n147\n\nOct 11, 2021\n\n#48\n\nHowever 5's vergil ending is the best because it implies he would have won and helped anyway\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nTransEuropaExpress\n\nDec 6, 2017\n\n11,196\n\nUS\n\nOct 11, 2021\n\n#49\n\nAbsolutely DMC3. I like everything about DMC3 infinitely more than DMC5 really."
