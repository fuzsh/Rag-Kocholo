Fresh evidence pointing to a Devil May Cry HD Collection has surfaced online via a filing on the ESRB’s official website.

The U.S. ratings body has listed Devil May Cry, Devil May Cry 2 and Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening for release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 alongside their original formats, indicating a HD bundle is in the pipeline.

The fact it appears to be coming out on Microsoft’s console is of particular note, as up until now the bundle has only been rumored for PS3.

Chatter on a DMC HD Collection dates back a few months now, with the pack originally spotted on the website of a Spanish retailer. With the Tokyo Game Show just around the corner, expect an announcement to drop any time now.

Stay tuned.
