        "text": "Fresh Taste\n\nI’ve always loved Farmer’s Markets – not just because of the beautiful, fresh herbs, fruit, vegetables, cheeses and meats, but because of the farmers -- their passion for growing sustainably, and feeding local communities inspires me to want to use seasonal, local products as often as possible, and to eat with the seasons. Depending on where you live, you may not be able to get local produce year-round, and I certainly often buy produce that has been shipped across country, but whenever you can, I hope you will support your local farmers, creameries, bakers, and meat producers --- great ingredients are the best way to get wonderful fresh taste into your cooking.\n\nMade with Love\n\nI always wondered why food made by my grandmother tasted so amazing and, so different than when someone else made the exact same dish, using the same recipe. Then, I figured it out – food made with love, just tastes better! Somehow when you are unhappy, or stressed, or angry, no matter how closely you follow the recipe, it just doesn’t taste as good, as when you enjoy the process, and make it with love for the ingredients and the people who will be eating it (even if that is just you!).\n\nTaste the Difference\n\nThe Mediterranean Diet (I refer to it as the Mediterranean Lifestyle) has been named the best diet to follow by multiple sources including the US News & World Report that put it at number one in 2019. My husband and I certainly follow the concepts of this approach to eating, but since I grew up in India, I often incorporate flavor profiles reminiscent of my childhood or my favorite cuisines (which include Thai, Cambodian, and Moroccan flavors). To me, our goal in creating our meals is to follow the essence of the Mediterranean way of eating – but I like to BE BRAVE with the flavor profiles, use ingredients from other parts of the world, and substitute healthy alternatives to the classic recipes. Join me in my journey and taste the difference."
