        "text": "“The present is a time of overwhelming interest to all living. Rulers and statesmen, men who occupy positions of trust and authority, thinking men and women of all classes, have their attention fixed upon the events taking place about us…they recognize that something great and decisive is about to take place – that the world is on the verge of a stupendous crisis.” Patriarchs and Prophets 537\n\nFires, floods, hurricanes, pandemics, pestilence, earthquakes, disasters by air, land and sea, riots. Never before in modern times have such things burst upon the world with such intensity as now. The Bible speaks of these very conditions happening just before the coming of Jesus. The good news is that God has not left us alone, without hope.\n\nKenneth Cox Ministries is a worldwide Bible-based ministry whose sole purpose is to prepare a people to meet the Lord. The book of Revelation is not a secret. As its name indicates, it is to be revealed - understood.\n\nBelow, you will see available books on Bible prophecy. You will also find many DVD packages recorded at evangelistic series given all over the world by Pastor Kenneth Cox. You will be amazed at the clarity of his presentations as he opens the Bible to whole new levels of understanding. Recently we received a phone call from one of our viewers, a widow of a former pastor. She was so excited about all the new truths she was “hearing from the Bible, things I had never heard before”."
