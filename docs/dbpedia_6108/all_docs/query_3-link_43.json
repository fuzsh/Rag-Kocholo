        "text": "Keith Kelly was born in SC. Whether ministering to local non-churched families and individuals or riding around as a law enforcement chaplain, Pastor Keith absolutely loves having the opportunity to serve God in Greer. Keith is careful to give all glory and honor to God. After all, as he says, “it’s all about Jesus anyway!”\n\nWhile His Vineyard’s ministerial reach is far, he loves being a husband, Dad and Pops more than anything in the world."
