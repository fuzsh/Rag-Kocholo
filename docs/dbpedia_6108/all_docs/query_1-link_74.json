        "text": "Today, we find the song ranked 15th among the best Southern Gospel radio songs of the 1980’s.\n\nQuinton Mills, a native American singer/songwriter from the Lumberton North Carolina area releases his first single to Southern Gospel radio and it becomes one of the biggest songs of the decade.\n\nMills recorded the now classic, “I Found The Lily In My Valley” on his 1987 album, Uncompromised. By the summer of 1988 the song peaked at #2 on the Southern Gospel radio singles chart. I believe the song would have become a #1 hit for Quinton if Gold City wasn’t dominating at this same time with “Midnight Cry”.\n\nToday we go in to the vault and look back 29 years at a top ten back then selection from August 1989.\n\nQuinton Mills had one of the biggest songs of 1988 with “I Found The Lily In My Valley”. This song would go on to be a signature song for Mills. The song was still sitting in the Southern Gospel top 80 chart in August of ’89, for a 22nd month.\n\nBut it was Quinton’s second top ten hit that was sitting at #9 in August of 1989; “I’ve Been To The Potter’s House”. Mills was also the songwriter of this top ten selection.\n\nOther Memorable Moments from August 1989:\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds (baseball) scored a record-breaking 14 runs in the first inning of the ball game.\n\nVoyager Two discovers (2) partial rings of Neptune.\n\nPoland elected their first non-communist president.\n\nNolan Ryan received his 5,000th strike out.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?: On this Indigenous People’s Day, we honor America’s Native American heritage and culture. It is important we remember those who made America home way before European settlers arrived. And for many, like myself, it is a time to honor our Native American ancestry.\n\nDid you know, Southern Gospel music, has been graced with several Native American artists. The first and most prominent would be the Klaudt Indian Family out of North Dakota. Their history in music dates back to 1929.\n\nMore recently Southern Gospel music had the Jody Brown Indian Family and solo artist Quinton Mills.\n\nHappy Tuesday. It is time to take a look at another page from my Southern Gospel notebook. As a kid, into my teen years, I wrote down my twenty favorite songs every month.\n\nI started this in July 1982 and continued until December 1994. Today’s post took my notebook entry from August 1991. These were my twenty favorite songs. Enjoy!\n\n**Music is on the sidebar as a playlist**\n\nAs is the case with most individuals, Southern Gospel music begins for them at the time they start listening. I have a firm belief that a majority of new listeners (who became associated with Southern Gospel in the last 5 to 10 years) don’t really care about what happened in Southern Gospel prior to their introduction.\n\nThis new series will try to shed light on some forgotten hits of Southern Gospel’s past. These songs had impact at the time of their success, but have since been forgotten by today’s listening audience.\n\nThe first song in the series was a hit radio single in 1988. Quinton Mills was a solo artist touring at a time when solo artists were few. He had a powerful testimony of being pronounced dead after a fatal car accident but being brought back. He would follow-up his powerful story with his signature song, “I Found The Lily In My Valley”.\n\nThe song was penned by Mills and was a huge radio hit in 1988. If not for the huge success of Gold City’s “Midnight Cry”, “I Found The Lily In My Valley” would have been a #1 song. Instead it settled at #2 for a couple of months. The song went on the be #2 for the entire year.\n\nQuinton recorded a live album in 1994 at the LJVM Coliseum in Winston-Salem NC in front of 12,000 people. His performance of “I Found The Lily In My Valley” was one of the most powerful Southern Gospel live performances caught on video. Here is a YouTube clip of that performance (published by QuintonMills). Enjoy!"
