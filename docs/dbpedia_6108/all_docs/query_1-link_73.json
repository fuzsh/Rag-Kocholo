So why do so many of us try to impress a date by acting like someone else? Whether we fake interest in their hobbies or we exaggerate (lie) about our accomplishments, we think becoming a version of someone they might like is better than being just plain old us. But no one wants to date a poser, so our panel delves into a spirited discussion on the topic and gives encouragement to be real, whatever the cost.\n\nLeave Us a Voicemail\n\nCulture: Lessons From a Lifelong Single (Part 1)\n\nKris Swiatocho had a rough start as a young adult. She admits she wasn’t walking with the Lord, so after a season of partying and poor relationship choices, Kris saw the chance to join a Christian community — and took it. After witnessing what churches do well and not so well in ministering to the unmarried, she started The Singles Network Ministries. Today she speaks to singles around the world about friendship, dating, finding community, and following Jesus — whatever your relationship status.\n\nVisit Kris’s Website\n\nInbox: After She’s Friendzoned You\n\nA girl at church has already friendzoned him. Should he still try to ask her out, or just let it be? Counselor Patrick Hill weighs in.\n\nLink to Counseling Services\n\nFind us on YouTube ​\n\nBrazilian Singles Ministry\n\nGreat opportunity to speak (with a translator, Pastor Fernando De Paula) about singles ministry and needs to leaders from Brazil.\n\nSingle Adult Ministry Training Event Success\n\nOn May 21st, we hosted an amazing Single Adult Ministry Zoom Training event. We had 25 experts teaching on various topics, from how to start a singles ministry, leadership and teamwork development, single parent and burnout, social events, keeping singles connected, mission trips, and starting a bible study, including Intentional Relationships for Singles. The feedback has been great. So many of those who attended were encouraged and supported. Thanks to our experts, our team, and those who showed up, investing in the ministry God had called them into. It will make an eternal difference.\n\nWGGS: Niteline\n\nSo thankful to WGGS who continues to care about single adults. Watch the show!\n\nBishop Dr. Daniel Vassell, another hero of singles ministry has passed\n\n​THE PASSING OF BISHOP DR DANIEL VASSELL\n\nWe are heartbroken to hear of the passing of Bishop Daniel Vassell, former International Coordinator of SAM, who passed away recently unexpectedly. Nearly twenty years ago, he pioneered a new era of singles ministry within the Church of God denomination and beyond. Members of the UK SAM team ministered with Bishop Vassell at various engagements including an International Singles Symposium in Cleveland, TN, three Singles Cruises (Florida to Caribbean), two International Leadership Advance conferences in Belgium, a ministry trip to South Africa and most notably, a short UK tour in 2007. He was a faithful soldier of the cross and will be extremely missed. Our thoughts and our prayers are with his wife Jenny and their children at this difficult time.\n\nWinner: CSLN Awards: Janet Wolfe Lifetime Achievement and World Ministry of 20 Years\n\nI was so honored to be chosen for the Janet Wolfe Lifetime Achievement award and an aware for being in full-time ministry for 20 years. Thanks to Janet, CSLN and my other honorees for your work in singles ministry. Let's serve another 20 years.\n\nLinda Hardin, A Pioneer and Hero of Singles Ministry, RIP\n\nWe have lost a great supporter and love of single adult ministry. This past March, Linda Hardin lost her battle with cancer and went into the arms of Jesus. When I first met Linda 25 plus years ago, she was the National Nazarene Coordinator of Single Adult’s, Women’s, and Young Adult Ministries. She was a pioneer in helping churches start and grow the singles ministry. I remember the day I met her personally. I told her I had a copy of her book and I wanted her to sign it. She looked at me, rolled her eyes, smiled, and in a humble response, really, an autograph, lol? While she had such a quiet and gentle spirit, she was a hero, a star to me. She encouraged me to do the work God had called me to do. To reach singles adults for Christ. To help churches understand who we are. To continue the fight. Thank you, Linda, for being a part of my journey. For the many conversations and support. Thanks for living and finishing well. Read her obit, click here.

By Leonardo Blair, Senior Features Reporter, Christian Post\n\nFor young adults today, more Americans agree that it’s easier for them than their parents’ generation to stay in touch with friends and family, get into college or find a job. But when it comes to saving for the future, paying for college, buying a house or finding a spouse, most Americans say young adults have it a lot harder.

Many years ago, Michaela was searching for help in starting a singles ministry in Prague. She found The Singles Network Ministries website and the work I was doing in Europe. She contacted us for help. We became instant friends. I had the honor of training her to start and grow singles ministry in Prague. She would invite me to come and speak following years. Michaela, like most young singles also desired to be married. Three years ago God brought her George. Today he shared with me that he was with her as she exhaled her last breath on earth, only to inhale her next one in heaven. She was a warrior for Christ. Please join me in prayer for her family and friends and the next steps of the ministry she left behind.\n\nTBN: WGGS: Intentional Relationships\n\nWGGS TV, Ms. Annie Broughton interview, Click here to watch, Wed, Dec 8th, 2021\n\nCSLN, UK\n\nCongratulations to our nominee Kris Swiatocho.

He pastored singles at HBC in Clarksville, TN, for many years as well as served as a singles ministry trainer with Lifeway for the state of TN. The first time I met Max was at the Labor Day Singles Retreat, where he gave me a business card that said “S.P.L.A.S.H”..an acronym for his singles ministry. At first, I was like, how can this man, who has been married his whole life, understand singleness. Well, Max agreed with me. He had been married his whole life; however, God has given him the heart to listen, understand, and offer compassion to singles of all ages and backgrounds. He would become a great friend and mentor. I will forever be changed by all I learned from Max and thankful he cared.\n\nPartial Obit: Maxie Gene Holt, age 75, of Mt. Juliet, TN, and formerly of Clarksville, TN, died April 27, 2021. Mr. Holt was a member and Sunday School teacher at First Baptist Church of Mt. Juliet. His Sunday School Class was broadcasted internationally online weekly. He retired, after 22 years, at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel from the U.S. Army. After his military career, Mr. Holt was a minister and preacher of the gospel of Jesus Christ in Texas and at Robertson Avenue Baptist Church in Copperas Cove Texas and at Hilldale Baptist Church in Clarksville, TN. Mr. Holt founded Max Holt Media Publishing in May of 2015 to publish his family's books and to provide Christian Single resources for singles and churches. He loved to travel and had visited over 40 countries and 28 states. Mr. Holt was a Silver Medalist in Ping Pong in the Senior Olympics. He was an accomplished musician and enjoyed playing the guitar, banjo, mandolin and fiddle.\n\nBill was another great friend and huge supporter of the singles ministry. A single adult himself, he understood the many struggles singles could have. But he also knew the victories. I met Bill through hearing him teach at a singles retreat in NC. His heart and love for others were radiant. He would attend the Labor Day Retreat I lead as well as become a supporter of Kris Swiatocho Ministries. In my last text from him, just two days before he passed, he told me how much he appreciated all I was doing for singles and to keep going. He believed in me! Thank you, Bill, for loving me and for loving others. Thank you also for your dear fiance and friend, Pat Rostron.\n\n​Partial Obit: Bill passed away unexpectedly in his home on April 22, 2021. He was 67 years old. He was born in Portsmouth, VA to the late John J. McCarron and Alice E. Travers nee’ Marcum. He was an associate pastor at Courtland Baptist Church.He had recently become engaged to his fiancée, Pat Rostron of Raleigh, NC.\n\nBill loved to laugh and tell stories, many of which may have been slightly embellished, but fun none-the-less. He often began laughing so hard at his own stories, that those around him would be laughing at his laughing. He loved the Lord and loved to share the Lord with others. He loved to travel, spend time with friends, enjoyed sports, watching movies, and reading. He also loved going to Busch Gardens as frequently as he could, especially during Christmas season for Christmastown. Bill enjoyed many hats throughout life: a softball commissioner for the church league in which he was inducted into the Softball Hall of Fame, a coach and player for the Virginia Beach First Church of the Nazarene softball team which won 5 National Championships, a welder, a teacher, a business manager, and numerous other areas. His laughter would carry and make everyone else laugh around him. He will be greatly missed.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pat.rostron.3/posts/10226344451944144\n\n$1030 Raised to Send Books to Uganda\n\nThank you for supporting ministry to single adults in Uganda by donating over $1000 towards the coast to ship 100 of our studies to Pastor Obong in Lira, Uganda.

In fact, you aren’t sure 2021 is going to be much better. I have decided the best way to see the value of 2020 is to view it through God’s eyes. What has God done for me personally and through the ministry despite?

Leader after leader shared their connection to Janet and how she help them in various ways---including Kris Swiatocho, The Singles Network Ministry. Janet was our first contact 8 plus years ago. She contacted Kris Swiatocho in hopes of gaining some resources to lead ministry, network and build a friendship. She would ask Kris if she would ever come to the UK to speak and train. Kris accept this request and the rest is history. From speaking all over the UK and Europe, to developing leaders, the ministry all started with that first contact with Janet and her vision of what God could do in the UK. Thanks Janet for loving singles and for reaching out to The Singles Network ministries.\n\nWe Made the Press: Baptist Press\n\nInterview Little Rock Church\n\nSupporting Single Parents\n\nIncredible time at First Baptist Church in Houston, TX.

I shared her story with everyone at the Labor Day Singles Retreat this past summer. Botum, who we rescued, went through our restoration program and then eventually went through our vocational training program to learn how to sew. Her mother was given a microloan to purchase a food cart and started making almost 6 times what she used to make! Now here is the exciting update. Botum has recently become the Children’s Director at her church. God is so good. You are helping make dreams like this beautiful young woman come true for children all over the world.

Instead, these churches are choosing to integrate singles into their broader adult ministries. The Witness has spent the past several weeks taking a look at the implications of this trend by talking to unmarried adults and the churches that are trying to serve them.

We departed from Port Canaveral upon the Royal Caribbean, Mariner of The Seas, headed to the Dominican Republic and the private island of Coco Cay.\n\nWe had around 70 singles join us from all over the US and one from Canada. Everyone was pretty excited to be going to the Caribbean, celebrating Christmas early, and making new friends. And while we did all do those things, something much bigger happened that would change our lives.\n\nBecause anyone can go on a cruise, with or without a group, I wanted to make sure this cruise would be something different. I have personally spoken on 12 other cruises, each with its unique leadership, speakers, worship, attendees, staff, kind of ship, and destination. So, how would things be different and memorable for this cruise? Sure, I had planned a fun Christmas party, many icebreakers and games for folks to get to know each other, and our meals together, but I knew God had brought us all together for something bigger. In the past, I encouraged folks to share their faith with their steward, staff, other cruisers, etc. I had even suggested bringing a Bible to give out, praying for God to open doors to share our faith. On some of the cruises, we were able to do a mission project, including giving out tracks in other countries. But how could we go the next step with this cruise? How could we measure to see if our efforts were returning anything? Well, by being more intentional, with more prayer, setting goals, and then allowing folks to share daily what God had done.\n\nBRING A BIBLE: I told everyone before cruising (and reminded) to bring at least one Bible (English or another language) to giveaway for a special mission project. Some folks brought several, including Bible covers, bookmarks, and tracks.\n\nNote: Todd, a Gideon, brought 2 cases of smaller Bibles (200) for us to give out. I didn’t realize it then, but this helped us give them out as they fit in our bags and easily in people’s hands.\n\nPRAY FOR GOD TO OPEN DOORS: At our first session on the first day at Sea, I talked about the mission project of giving a Bible(s) away. We then went into prayer groups, praying for God to give them the boldness and courage to share their faith. I encourage them to tell their story of how they came to know the Lord and then give away the Bible. We suggested their steward (with a great tip), waiter(s), staff, other cruisers, and those at the ports. Some people wrote messages in their Bibles, sending them to the book of John to read and underlining scripture. One lady named Patty said God woke her up the last night, and she wrote a 3-page letter to her steward and put it in the Bible with a gift.\n\nSHARE TESTIMONIALS: When we regathered each day, we allowed time for folks to share what God did. And boy, did He open up doors all over the place. One lady in particular, Sandra, gave away 8 Bibles in one area of the ship and had to come back for me. So many of the staff were hungry for God’s word—even those who were Muslim and Hindi.\n\nREMINDERS: I reminded folks daily of the importance of being the light, of showing others who Christ was through their actions and attitudes. To continue to pray for God to open doors. We heard story after story of some of the staff getting Bibles from others in our group but took another one to give to a friend. We were also finding tracks all over the ship left by David. On the last day, I challenged folks to write one of their stories of faith they could give away as a personal track.\n\nWORSHIP: One of the servers, Antonio, a Christian worship leader from the Philippines, led us in worship each night in the dining room, allowing others to hear us worship the Lord. Have you ever been on a cruise ship? Almost 2000 people were dining simultaneously, and could you hear the music? We found out later that Antonio led a small group of believers on the ship each Tuesday at 11 pm after they got off work. We prayed on the cruise to bless him and raised $1500 to give him. We invited him to our meeting room to honor him, and in return, he honored us by leading us in worship. Don't forget those who are in areas of our world where they don’t have access to Amazon, Bibles, and resources.\n\nCELEBRATE: When it was all done, there were over 100 testimonials given publicly with some people sharing multiples (not counting the ones I didn’t hear), 300 plus Bibles given out, $3000 in donations that I am aware of, hundreds of hugs and thank you’s. Personally, I shared more on this cruise than I have in weeks---so much fun. One particular story was shared about Jesus with our amazing group coordinator, Ming. She had no real belief in anything but was open to listening and learning. Her Christian workmate told me that because I shared with Ming (in her presence), it opened the door for her (Shannan) to share with Ming. She said if I had not shared, she would not have been able due to work limits. Wow, isn’t God good? Thank you, Lord, thank you for using a group of singles who came on a ship to make some friends, get a tan, swim with the dolphins, and eat, but did much more to change their lives and the lives of others.\n\nCHALLENGE: Here's the thing: the more people are allowed to share what God is doing, the more they will share. Maybe it’s time your ministry has a training 101 class and prayer. Then, send them out into the community to see what God will do, then bring everyone back to share. Send them out with Bibles, money, or tracks...just send them.\n\nAlso, I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.
