        "text": "Pastor Mark Sowersby has a testimony to share about how he was set free from a nightmare of abuse and years of suffering. Condemnation, shame, and guilt were replaced with forgiveness, joy, and life in abundance.\n\nMark’s ministry, Forgiving The Nightmare is on mission to help those who have experienced hurt, abuse, and pain find freedom and peace through God’s love and the many facets of forgiveness.\n\nHis testimony, told to live audiences, on television, and through his book, is a powerful reflection of the love of our Savior. Since 2019, he’s been sharing his story around the world of how he went from hurting to health, from death to life.\n\nForgiving The Nightmare is a short film based on the book and life of Mark Sowersby, who was sexually abused as a child by his stepfather, but overcomes his past trauma by confronting his abuser and forgiving him.\n\nThe film is about the power of forgiving others even when they don’t deserve it or have asked for it. It’s about the biblical principle of forgiveness found in Matthew 6:12-13.\n\nLearn more about this film, its producer Henrique Franhani, and the film’s cast and crew by visiting https://forgivingthenightmarefilm.com\n\nIn 2019 Pastor Mark went through a time of great healing. He began speaking about the experiences and abuse of his past and God’s grace and the transformational work of forgiveness in his life.\n\nHis message is a message of hope. Forgiving the nightmare is more than just forgiving the abuse. It’s walking in forgiveness. It’s walking in joy. It’s not allowing the things of the past to have control over the things of the future."
