        "text": "\"Spartanburg\" redirects here. For other uses, see Spartanburg (disambiguation).\n\nNot to be confused with Spartansburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nCity in South Carolina\n\nSpartanburg is a city in and the seat of Spartanburg County, South Carolina, United States.[9] The city had a population of 38,732 as of the 2020 census, making it the 11th-most populous city in the state.[10] The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) groups Spartanburg and Union counties together as the Spartanburg, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area.[11]\n\nSpartanburg is the second-largest city in the greater Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, SC Combined Statistical Area, which had an estimated population of 1,590,636 in 2023.[8] It is part of a ten-county region of northwestern South Carolina known as \"The Upstate\", and is located 98 miles (158 km) northwest of Columbia, 80 miles (130 km) west of Charlotte, North Carolina, and about 190 miles (310 km) northeast of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nSpartanburg is the home of Wofford College, Converse University, Spartanburg Community College, and Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine and the area is home to USC Upstate, Sherman College of Chiropractic and Spartanburg Methodist College. It is also the site of Denny's corporate headquarters.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSpartanburg was formed in 1785, after a deal was made with the Cherokee in 1753, and was named after a local militia called the Spartan Regiment in the American Revolutionary War. The Spartan Regiment, commanded by Andrew Pickens, participated in the nearby Battle of Cowpens. In 1831, Spartanburg was incorporated, later becoming known as the \"Hub City\"; railroad lines radiated from the city forming the shape of a wheel hub.\n\nIt became a center of textile manufacturing in the late 19th century, with around 40 textile mills being established through the early 1900s.\n\nIn 1911, under the sponsorship of the Spartanburg Herald and the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the city erected a confederate monument at the intersection of South Church and Henry Streets, overlooking downtown.[12] It was moved in 1966 to Duncan Park.[13]\n\nDuring World War I, Camp Wadsworth was used to train 100,000 soldiers for the war. Camp Croft trained soldiers during World War II. The facility was transferred to the state and adapted as Croft State Park.\n\nBy the 1950s, the production in these mills began to decline as wages increased. Most textile manufacturing jobs were moved offshore by the companies.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 20.37 square miles (52.8 km2), of which 20.25 square miles (52.4 km2) is land and 0.11 square miles (0.28 km2) (0.54%) is water.[4] The most common soil series is Cecil.[14] The bedrock is mostly biotite gneiss.[15]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Spartanburg has a humid subtropical climate with long, hot, and humid summers, and cool to semimild winters. The average annual temperature is 61.6 °F (16.4 °C). In the summer from June through September, average highs are in the 80s °F (20s °C) to low 90s °F (30s °C), while in the winter, average highs are in the mid-50s °F (10s °C). Annual rainfall is spread fairly evenly throughout the whole year. Spartanburg receives very little snowfall, with the annual average being only 1.4 inches (3.6 cm). Average precipitation is 51.3 inches (130 cm) and the average growing season is 231 days.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18501,176—18601,2163.4%18701,080−11.2%18803,253201.2%18905,54470.4%190011,395105.5%191017,51753.7%192022,63829.2%193028,72326.9%194032,24912.3%195036,79514.1%196044,35220.5%197044,5460.4%198043,826−1.6%199043,467−0.8%200039,673−8.7%201037,013−6.7%202038,7324.6%2023 (est.)39,040[10]0.8%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nSpartanburg racial composition[20] Race Num.

This has resulted in a remodeling of Morgan Square, the restoration of a number of historic structures and the relocation of several businesses and company headquarters to the downtown vicinity. These new developments include a nine-floor, 240-room Marriott hotel.\n\nSpartanburg is home to many large companies, including Denny's, KYMCO, Smith Drug Company, Advance America Cash Advance, Southern Conference, Spartanburg Herald-Journal, RJ Rockers Brewing Company, American Credit Acceptance, and Upward Sports.\n\nThe economy of Spartanburg benefits from the BMW manufacturing facility located in the city of Greer, South Carolina, which is in Spartanburg County. As of February 2017, the plant employed around 8,800 people with an average daily output of about 1,400 vehicles.\n\nSpartanburg is also home to the world headquarters and research facility for Milliken & Company, a textile and chemical manufacturer.\n\nTop employers\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Spartanburg's 2022 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[21] the principal employers in the city are:\n\n# Employer # of employees 1 Spartanburg Regional 9,648 2 Spartanburg County 1,515 3 Spartanburg School District 7 1,273 4 RedSail Technologies, LLC 485 5 Wofford College 421 6 City of Spartanburg 416 7 Spartanburg Hospital for Restorative Care 300 8 Converse College 260 9 Denny's Corporate Office 250 10 Advance America, Inc. 233\n\nArts and culture\n\n[edit]\n\nCultural events and institutions in the city include:\n\nChapman Cultural Center,[22] Spartanburg's cultural anchor for history, art, theatre, dance, music, and science, is located in a three-building complex on the northern edge of downtown. Opened in October 2007, the Center was designed by David M. Schwarz Architects of Washington, D.C. It houses the Spartanburg Art Museum, Spartanburg County Regional History Museum, Science Center, Little Theatre, Ballet, Music Foundation, and other groups that were formerly located in The Arts Center[23] on South Spring Street. It is owned and operated by The Arts Partnership of Greater Spartanburg, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting arts and cultural agencies in Spartanburg County.\n\nConverse University[24] is a nationally known four-year liberal arts institution recognized for its strong music and visual art programs. It hosts events open to the community throughout the year. Twichell Auditorium is located on the campus of Converse University. Home of the Greater Spartanburg Philharmonic Orchestra, Twichell Auditorium has served as hosts to other groups such as the Spartanburg All-County High School Band and Boston Brass. Twichell Auditorium was built in 1899 and renovated for the school's centennial celebration in 1989. The 1500-seat auditorium is home to a 57-rank Casavant organ with 2,600+ pipes. Theatre Converse puts on several plays a year, and Converse puts on an opera annually, as well as opera scenes. The university has had major concerts in recent years with such artists as Caedmon's Call, Jason Mraz, Corey Smith, and Colbie Caillat.\n\nHub City Writers Project, serves the community as a local publishing company and independent bookstore.\n\nSpartanburg County Public Library headquarters,[25] housed in an innovative building on South Church Street, is home to a voluminous collection of fiction, nonfiction, children's literature, A/V materials and items relating to local history and genealogy. The library hosts many meetings, concerts and presentations. The County Librarian is Todd Stephens.[26]\n\nSpartanburg Memorial Auditorium is located on N. Church Street, across from the municipal building in the northwest end of the city of Spartanburg. The \"SMA\" has hosted acts such as Bob Dylan, Crosby Stills and Nash, B.B. King, Billy Joel, David Copperfield, Lewis Grizzard, Harry Connick, Jr., Gerald Levert, Dave Chappelle, Jerry Seinfeld, Phish, A Prairie Home Companion, and many others. Originally built in an Art Deco style and was renovated c. 2002 including a new facade and backstage with loading area.\n\nWofford College,[27] liberal arts college. Not traditionally known for its arts and cultural strength, Wofford has made notable strides to develop arts programs in recent years. Poet and environmental writer John E. Lane, theater artist Mark Ferguson, and visual artist Kris Neely are all graduates of Wofford. Each returned to their alma mater to develop curricular and co-curricular opportunities in the Arts, including a Creative Writing program, a Theatre Major, and a minor in Studio Art. John Lane was also a critical visionary in the creation of the Goodall Environmental Studies Center in Glendale.\n\nPoints of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nCottonwood Trail, walking trail located in the Edwin M. Griffin Nature Preserve that runs along part of Lawson's Fork Creek. The trail includes picnic areas, a raised path over an extensive wetlands area and access to sporadic sandbars. Located just east of downtown, it is used frequently by cyclists, joggers and walkers. Since the Lawson's Fork floodplain is not suitable for development, wildlife populate the area. Larger animals that can be found here include white-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, pileated woodpeckers, mallard ducks, Canada geese and snapping turtles.[28][29]\n\nHampton Heights Historic District, the city's oldest intact downtown neighborhood, located a couple of blocks south of Morgan Square. Architectural styles in this neighborhood range from large Queen Anne and Neoclassical homes to cozy early 20th-century bungalows.\n\nHatcher Garden and Woodland Preserve, preserve located in the midst of an urban environment. Retired social activist Harold Hatcher and his wife Josephine transformed an eroding gully into a thick woods and flower garden which now provides a haven for birds and other wildlife.[30]\n\nEarly European settlers to this area included French fur trappers, English woodsmen, and Scots-Irish farmers. Few remnants survive from these early pioneering days, but traces can be found in the more rural areas of the county.\n\nLawson's Fork Creek, tributary of the Pacolet River, was once known for its plentiful wildlife and crystal clear waters. Parks and woodlands line much of its banks (which lie entirely within Spartanburg County), and rocky shoals and natural waterfalls can be found throughout its course. It stretches from the northern end of the county to the eastern end, where it empties into the Pacolet River.\n\nJammie Seay House, another 18th-century home, is a more typical representative of a pioneer home. Its single stone fireplace and simple construction were common traits of farmsteads from this period.\n\nFirst established in the 1780s as a courthouse village, Spartanburg may have been named for the Spartan regiment of the South Carolina militia. The city was incorporated in 1831, at the time of the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Cowpens, a pivotal fight of the American Revolution that took place only a few miles away. The city's streets and architectural record reflect the changes of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nMagnolia Street Train Depot, one of the older buildings in Spartanburg and stands as a reminder of Spartanburg's old nickname \"the Hub City,\" referring to the many transportation routes that connected Spartanburg with cities throughout the region.[31] It is now the home of the Amtrak station, the Hub City Railroad Museum, and the Hub City Farmers' Market.\n\nMorgan Square, the city's primary downtown hub, is the original courthouse village. It was founded adjacent to a small spring (now underground) on the western slope of a ridge, which forms the border of the Tyger and Pacolet River watersheds. The square's name derives from Daniel Morgan, the general who commanded the American forces at Cowpens. A statue of Morgan was placed in the square in 1881. The oldest existing buildings on Morgan Square date to the 1880s.\n\nThe Price House, the third 18th-century home maintained by the Historical Association, is unique. Its sturdy Flemish-bond brick construction and three stories are less common in this area. By carefully examining the original inventory lists of the house, the Historical Association has been able to retrieve period pieces that approximate the original contents of the house.\n\nWalnut Grove Plantation, an 18th-century farmhouse, has been preserved by The Spartanburg County Historical Association. The site of a locally famous skirmish during the American Revolutionary War, it was the home of the Moore family. The plantation lies south of Spartanburg near the town of Roebuck, and is open to the public for tours and during annual festivals.\n\nCotton mills have abounded in the Spartanburg area since 1816, earning Spartanburg the reputation as the \"Lowell of the South.\" Although there were few mills in the area before the Civil War, technological advances, northern capital, and out-migration from the poor farms that made white labor available, created a wave of postbellum mill development here and in much of the Piedmont South. Additionally, the abundant streams and rivers in the area are just beginning their descent towards the lower-lying Midlands region. In many places, these waterways descend abruptly, providing a source for plentiful waterpower. Cotton mills were built along these rivers to harness this power, and so began the region's servitude to King Cotton.
