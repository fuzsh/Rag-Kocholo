        "text": "Author\n\nGeorge Shamblin\n\nIn the summer of 1995, George Shamblin left a successful career in pharmaceutical sales to enroll at Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi. Though he experienced more than his share of challenges and setbacks over the next 28 years, it's a decision he never regretted. Since 2012, Shamblin has been a pastor at The Center for Executive Leadership in Birmingham, Alabama, where he teaches Bible Studies and disciples others at various stages of spiritual growth. He serves on the board of Reel-Life International and has been an adjunct professor at Birmingham Theological Seminary. In 2023, he and his brother Keith co-founded a missions ministry, The Overseas Initiative. Shamblin published his first book, The Relay, in 2020 and was inducted into Marquis Who's Who that same year. An avid outdoorsman, as well as a Master Gardener, George and his wife of 30 years, Jill, have four children Sydney, Bailey, Miller, and George Jr."
