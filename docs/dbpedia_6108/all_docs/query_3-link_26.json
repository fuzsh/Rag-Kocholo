        "text": "Encourager – Every Sunday our Prayer Line Encouragers are overwhelmingly blessed by our television viewers who “go to church” with us via television and then call our Prayer Line to talk and pray with a Prayer Line Encourager. The testimonies are heart-touching…the blessings are great. The number of phone calls has increased dramatically. As a result, we need more Prayer Line Encouragers to add to our present number. Pray about being a part of this ministry to our television viewers. No experience necessary. Just a heart for serving one Sunday (or more) per month. Questions? Contact 343.8558 or by email.\n\nClosed Captioning – This ministry is required by the FCC in order to broadcast our services regionally. We have installed state of the art voice-recognition software and began captioning our broadcast services in early 2007. The software allows a captioner to listen to the musicians/speakers and to repeat the words into a microphone, which is then translated into the closed caption bar along the bottom of your television screen. We normally have two people stationed at the equipment – one to do the captioning and one to assist. This position requires someone who is an excellent listener and requires your undivided attention for the entire worship hour. Attention to detail is important. If you are willing to learn, we can use your assistance one or two Sundays a month.\n\nIf interested in serving in the Closed Captioning Ministry, send us an email.\n\nArchiving – We are currently in the process of planning an archive of all First Baptist videos to date. We are also in the process of transferring all of our analog recordings to a longer lasting digital medium. Either one of these tasks can be done at your leisure.\n\nMastering – In order to provide all of the content available immediately following each service, someone must master the sermons live. This requires a bit of technical skill which would be taught by our media staff.\n\nIf Interested in serving in the DDS Ministry send us an email.\n\nLive Worship Support – With simultaneous events happening across the entire building on a Sunday, a Wednesday or a Saturday wedding or a seminar, there is a place for anyone with an ear for quality and a heart for ministry. Sunday morning worship requires a total of four audio board operators…two for broadcast and two for Front of House. If you think you’ve got the “Golden Ear” let us know and we would love to get you plugged in.\n\nPodcasting – One of our newest advances in the Media Ministry, we now offer sermon audio from the pastor’s message. Through our Podcasting service, listeners may listen online, download, or subscribe to the podcast service, allowing people to take the message with them. The Podcast process is relatively simple.\n\nAudio Editing – From archiving old sermons, to preparing sermons for podcasting, there is always plenty of editing to be done. We use Pro-Tools editing software.\n\nIf Interested in serving in the audio ministry send us an email.\n\nStage Managers – Responsible for the platform before, during, and after special performances, the stage manager has a key role. During performances, the stage manager is the key link in communication from the platform to the tech team. Before and after each performance, the stage manager manages the set-up of the platform before and during the show, and the strike at the end.\n\nStage Hands – Assist in the set up of the stage, placing mics on speakers, singers or performers, and also perform lesser stage management roles during special performances.\n\nIf interested in serving in the Stage Management Ministry, send us an email.\n\nSystems Maintenance – With all of the technology in the building, someone has to keep it all running. Whether testing a new DVD player, installing a new tape deck, making new cables or even soldering or crimping cables there is a place for you.\n\nSystems Integration – As we expand our horizons we are looking for able bodied people to help implement new systems.\n\nIf Interested in serving in the Engineering Ministry send us an email."
