Many who have never been to church, perhaps drug and alcohol addicted, lonely, depressed, marriage problems, identity problems, anger problems and the list goes on, will tune in and listen to our message. CHOOSE LIFE with Deborah Ross addresses all of these issues by teaching people how to live according to God's Word. CHOOSE LIFE TV PROGRAMS are making our communities happier, stronger and safer - one life at a time.\n\nYour support and contributions will enable us to pay for studio production and air time. Your generous donations impact the lives of those around you.\n\nThank you!"
