I just received a message letting me know that a Pastor friend, whom Iâ€™ve not seen in a few years, ended his life last night. ðŸ˜ž. We can definitely make a difference if we just love loudly and unconditionally. Depression is very real and uncontrollable, alone. ðŸ’”!!! If you were struggling with depression, donâ€™t do it alone. Reach out to someone who loves you and be transparent to them. Please know that will be a shoulder for you to lean on and I will be a friend who will walk through the darkness with you. Here is a song demo that I Co-wrote with Barbara Fairchild and Michael Lee, that says, HELP SOMEONE TODAY. WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!!
