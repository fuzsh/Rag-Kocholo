        "text": "Nättraby is a locality in the province of Blekinge in southern Sweden. This is a growing residential area with short commutes to the nearby towns of Karlskrona and Ronneby. With a population of around 3.300 inhabitants, this is one of the larger urban areas within Karlskrona Municipality.\n\nA Short History of Nättraby\n\nNättraby was once the center of the local parish with a small settlement that grew around the church. The parish had its origins in the Middle Ages and the church was built in the 12th century. The next major development mentioned in the area’s history is the establishment of the railway between Nättraby and Alnaryd in 1895. It was soon after extended to Älmeboda in 1910, making its total length 49 kilometers. The railway was decommissioned already in 1946. The top speed was up until 1933 20 kilometers per hour, it was at that time increased to 33 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe parish did not survive until the opening of the railway. It was split between the civil government of the Nättraby Municipality and the church congregation during the reforms of 1862. In 1974, the municipality merged with the much larger Karlskrona municipality. Nättraby Congregation was later, in 2010, merged with Hasslö Congregation creating Nättraby-Hasslö Congregation.\n\nThe population has in the more recent decades increased sharply in Nättraby. At the start of the 1960s, the population was only around 1.300 inhabitants. The numbers had surpassed 3.000 by the year 2005.\n\nThings to Do and See\n\nThis is a locality with easy access to transportation to the larger urban areas in the region, such as Karlskrona and Ronneby. It is also an area with easy access to the surrounding nature and the Baltic Sea.\n\nNättraby Vägmuseum\n\nNättraby Vägmuseum claims to the “the world’s first open-air museum of history on country roads, rail, water, and ice”. Located right next to highway E22 it is within easy access for many people who are just passing by. Its most iconic sight is probably the old vault stone bridge over the Nättrabyån River.\n\nNättraby Church\n\nNättraby Church is the most prominent and historical building in the locality and has a history dating back to the 12th century. The original church most likely survived until the 1560s when it was burned down during the Northern Seven Years’ War. The white stone church has since been rebuilt with the last of many restorations being completed in 2018.\n\nNättrabyån River\n\nNättrabyån River runs through the central parts of the locality and offers not only nice scenery but also green outdoor areas for anyone looking to spend time in nature without heading far from home.\n\nTallholmen\n\nTallholmen is a peninsula to the south. This is where you will find the local beach as well as a marina, and an outdoor area right along the shores of the Baltic Sea.\n\nHow to Get to Nättraby\n\nFlights: The closest airport is Ronneby Airport (RNB) 24 kilometers away. The airport has a few domestic routes as well as seasonal charter flights.\n\nCar: Nättraby along road E22 between Ronneby and Karlskrona.\n\nBus: Buses from Blekingetrafiken connect Nättraby with the surrounding region.\n\nThe driving distance from 5 major Swedish cities, according to Google Maps:\n\nStockholm – 493 kilometers (5 h 39 min)\n\nGothenburg – 326 kilometers (4 h 6 min)\n\nMalmö – 192 kilometers (2 h 4 min)\n\nLinköping – 303 kilometers (3 h 56 min)\n\nKiruna – 1723 kilometers (19 h 35 min)\n\nExplore More of Blekinge and Sweden"
