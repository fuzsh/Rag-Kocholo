        "text": "On December 5, 2023, the Swedish Supreme Court, reversing a decision by the Appeals Court for Skåne and Bleking, issued a judgment in the “PFAS case.” In its decision, the court declared that high per-and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) levels in the blood of residents in Ronneby caused by PFAS-contaminated drinking water constitutes a personal injury under the Product Liability Act (Produktansvarslagen (1992:18)). (Swedish Supreme Court Decision (Högstadomstolen), T486-23.)\n\nBackground to the Case\n\nIn 2013, the company Ronneby Miljö och Teknik AB (Miljöteknik), owned by the Ronneby municipality, discovered that the drinking water it provided to residents of Ronneby and Kallinge from the Brantafors Water Works had been contaminated with PFAS, measuring 10,380 nanograms per liter, far exceeding the approved threshold value of 4 nanograms per liter. The contamination had been ongoing for several years as a result of firefighting foam leaking from a fire drill site at the nearby Swedish Air Force Base (Blekinge flygflottilj) into the ground water. Consumers of the water brought suit claiming personal injury from elevated PFAS values in their blood caused by a product with a “safety defect” (säkerhetsbrist) under the Product Liability Act.\n\nApplicability of the Product Liability Act\n\nThe Supreme Court had already held in a separate opinion in this case that the water Miljöteknik supplied to the residents of Blekinge met the standard for a product that was subject to the Product Liability Act. (Supreme Court Case No. Ö 4746-17, “Dricksvattnet” (“The Drinking Water”) Nytt Juridiskt Arkiv (NJA) 2018 s. 475.)\n\nThe Issue Before the Court\n\nThe issue before the court was whether, as a matter of principle, Miljöteknik was liable for damages for the elevated levels of PFAS in the blood because these elevated levels constituted a personal injury. (Supreme Court Case T486-23, ¶¶ 8, 28.) The scope of the decision would not include determining the amount of a potential liability for damages. (¶ 33.) The parties conceded that the claimants had an elevated level of PFAS in their blood caused by the elevated levels of PFAS from the drinking water. (¶ 27.) However, they did not agree as to whether the increased level of PFAS in the blood was a personal injury. (¶ 28.)\n\nPersonal Injury and the Product Liability Act\n\nThe Swedish Product Liability Act implements the Product Liability Directive (EU Council Directive of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products (85/374/EEC)). Under the act, product liability rules require that compensation be paid for an injury caused by a product’s lack of safety. The personal injury need not be caused by carelessness by the producer of the product. (1 § Product Liability Act.) The liability is thus a strict liability.\n\nThe court determined that neither the EU Product Liability Directive nor the Swedish Product Liability Act define the legal term “personal injury.” (Supreme Court Case T486-23, ¶ 10.) However, the court in its decision established that “[a]ccording to the European Court of Justice a wide margin of appreciation is provided in order that those who have suffered an injury as a result of a defective product receive correct and complete compensation.” (¶ 11 (citing European Court of Justice decisions Veedfald, C- 203/99, EU:C:2001:258, p. 25–29 and Boston Scientific Medizintechnik, Joined Cases C-503/13 and C-504/13, EU:C:2015:148, pp. 46 & 47).)\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, because personal injury is not defined in the Product Liability Act, the term “personal injury” should be defined the same way as it is in the Swedish Tort Act. (Supreme Court Case T486-23, ¶ 12 (referring to Supreme Court Decision “Flänsämnena” NJA 1996 s. 68).) The court further explained that while the term is not explicitly defined in the Tort Act, personal injury is mentioned several times in the legislative history. (¶ 13 (referring to SOU 1964:31, p. 80; Prop. 1972:5, p. 576; SOU 1973:51, p. 36 f.; Prop. 1975:12, p. 20; SOU 1995:33, p. 61; and Prop. 2000/01:68, p. 17 f.).)\n\nThus, the court determined that for a physical defect to qualify as a personal injury, there must be a change on or in the body and that the change must objectively be seen as a deterioration. The deterioration may be either temporary or permanent, visible or invisible, and may include a deterioration of the body’s immune system. (Supreme Court Case T486-23, ¶ 15.)\n\nWith reference to this specific case, the court determined that:\n\n31. Overall the investigation can be considered as providing sufficient support that the contaminated drinking water has had a significant negative impact on the claimants’ bodies. The elevated risks for negative health effects in the future do not on their own constitute a personal injury. However, the considerable physical deterioration that is manifested by the high PFAS blood levels for each of the claimants is considered to constitute a physical defect that with respect to tort law constitutes a personal injury.\n\n32. Therefore, the prerequisites for establishing that Miljöteknik is responsible for compensating the complainants for these personal injuries is met.\n\nThe Court’s Decision\n\nThe court ruled that the increased level of PFAS found in the claimants’ blood, averaging 600 ng/ml, compared to the less than 10 ng/ml for the average Swede, made the claimants eligible for compensation attributable to a personal injury as defined in the Product Liability Act. (¶¶ 29–31.) The court did not rule on the amount of the compensation. (¶ 33.) The claimants must now seek compensation before the local district court. One member of the five-judge bench, Anders Perklev, dissented and argued that the risk of a future illness due to the increased PFAS levels in the blood could not on its own be considered a personal injury.\n\nElin Hofverberg, Law Library of Congress\n\nMarch 7, 2024"
