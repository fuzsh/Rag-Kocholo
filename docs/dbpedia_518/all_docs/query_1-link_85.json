Its estimated population of 32 people will become residents of surrounding Maywood Township.\n\nRonneby had struggled for years, lacking a tax base to pay expenses and finding few people willing to run for local office.\n\n“I wish it could have been kept a city, but there’s just not enough funds in a small community like this to be feasible,” said Jason Janssen, owner of Goodfella’s Bar & Grill on Ronneby’s main street.\n\nRonneby wasn’t always so small. At the turn of the 20th century, the Benton County city boasted a hotel, a newspaper, a wood mill and three stores, making it bigger than nearby Foley, home to 2,400 people today.\n\nAccording to local lore, a long-forgotten dispute caused a significant number of residents to leave town in the early 1900s, some taking businesses with them. The decline of the railroad and the rerouting of Minnesota 23 away from the town center also sapped vitality.\n\nResidents voted once before to dissolve the city, in 1998. But city officials failed to follow the proper procedure with the state, rendering the vote invalid.\n\nThere was another blow in 2000, when a state audit revealed that Ronneby’s clerk-treasurer had stolen $14,000 from the city.\n\nSince then, some residents tried to make improvements to remaining businesses. But it might have been too late.\n\n“There’s nothing here,” said Marlene Anderson, a city council member. Finding people to run for office is difficult, she said, because “they want to give you advice, but they don’t want to be on the council.”\n\nIn an August hearing, city officials told an administrative law judge that Ronneby lacks a municipal well, a city sewer system, and a fire and police department. Council members volunteered their own time to maintain the streets, which total less than a mile.\n\nMinnesota cities rarely take the step of dissolution, said Jim Mogen, an attorney who represented the city. He said the only other example he could find in the past 30 years was the Koochiching County community of Island View, which dissolved in 1992. It’s been more common for townships to incorporate into cities.\n\nAnderson said she doubted most Ronneby residents would see much change after dissolution, except for maybe a slightly smaller property tax bill.\n\n“I don’t think they’re going to notice anything,” she said.\n\nOriginally Published: May 3, 2009 at 11:01 p.m."
