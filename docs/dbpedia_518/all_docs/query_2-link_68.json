        "text": "Along the coast, the archipelago turns into sandy beaches by the time you reach the western corner of the county. Instead of an archipelago, it has beaches—many long ones with beautiful fine sand. In Sölvesborg, there is a beach for every day of the week and even more. Some of them are full of life and offer kiosks, restaurants, and playgrounds, while others are quiet and hidden.\n\nDive into a day of aquatic fun at Brunnsbadet Water Park, where an array of thrilling attractions awaits. Experience the excitement of water slides, navigate through stream channels, and enjoy the soothing swirls of lagoons. For the little ones, there are specially designed children's pools. Take a break from the aquatic adventures to relax in the hot tub or indulge in a water massage. Whether you prefer sunbathing, sipping coffee, or socialising, Brunnsbadet has it all. With amenities like an ice cream kiosk and a restaurant, the water park ensures everything you need for a memorable day with the whole family.\n\nLocated in Kallinge, about 8 kilometres north of Ronneby, Ronneby Airport (RNB) is a key international gateway for the region, easily accessible via transfer buses that stop at the airport. Information about public transportation options can be found on Blekingetrafiken's website. Daily flights connect Ronneby Airport to Stockholm, serving both Bromma and Arlanda airports with a flight duration of approximately 50 minutes. The airport is strategically positioned, with distances of 33 kilometres to Karlskrona, 32 kilometres to Karlshamn, 60 kilometres to Olofström, and 59 kilometres to Sölvesborg.\n\nSweden can be visited visa-free for up to 90 days by citizens of most European countries, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Israel, UAE and most countries in America. If you are unsure whether or not you need to apply for a visa, we recommend contacting the embassy or consulate in your country. International (non-Schengen) travellers need a passport that is valid for at least 3 months after the end of their intended trip in order to enter the Schengen zone. Citizens of Schengen countries can travel without a passport but must have a valid ID with them during their stay.\n\nIf you see a blue flag flying at a guest harbour or bathing beach that you are visiting, it means that it is well-managed, clean and has the least possible impact on the environment. They must also meet service, information and safety requirements. The guest harbours at both Kristianopel and Hanö have Blue Flags.\n\nBlekingetrafiken runs public bus services across municipalities in Blekinge, covering central towns and urban transport in Karlskrona, Ronneby, Karlshamn, and Sölvesborg. City bus services operate in Karlskrona (lines 1–9 and 12), Ronneby (lines 1–4), and Karlshamn (lines 1–3). The express bus, Kustbussen, provides quick and comfortable travel between Blekinge's central towns, Kalmar, and Växjö, with modern double-decker buses servicing key routes, including Karlskrona–Ronneby–Karlshamn–Olofström (line 600) and Karlskrona–Kalmar (line 500). Line 600, the Coastal bus, complements the Öresund train service, ensuring a half-hourly service throughout Blekinge."
