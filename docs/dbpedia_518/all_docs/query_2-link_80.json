        "text": "Ronneby Brunnspark offers a historical environment and a fantastically beautiful park. Once upon a time, people came here to drink the well and take health baths. Today you can enjoy the lovely park, stay in a spa hotel, swim in the pools or, perhaps, eat almond cake.\n\nRonneby Brunnspark\n\nRonneby Brunnspark became a cultural reserve in 2003 and in 2005 it was named Sweden's most beautiful park. And it is indeed beautiful! There's everything from rhododendron bushes and wooden villas with ornate towers to magical forests and lush themed gardens.\n\nRonneby brunnspark is located in Blekinge, at the southern end of Ronneby. The park is less than 20 miles west of Karlskrona.\n\nRonneby brunnspark - once Sweden's leading health resort\n\nIn the early 18th century, the first health-promoting well was opened on the banks of the Ronneby River. Initially, the operation was limited - you had to row three kilometres from Ronneby to get to the well - but over time the operation developed.\n\nIn 1846, the 'Brunnskällan', which today is the oldest building in the park, was built and a decade later the spa was visited by 1400 spa guests in just one year. Ronneby soon became the country's leading health resort, and by 1907 the number of guests had increased to 2774 in one year.\n\nThe well water can still be drunk, but from a pump right next to the old well source. Does it taste good? No, we can't say it does. But it used to be considered very healthy.\n\nImagine a time when wealthy people travelled here to spend a few weeks on retreat. Often, at the beginning of the season, a doctor would prescribe the frequency of bathing, drinking well water, exercise, diet and other health-promoting activities.\n\nHotels, spas and baths today\n\nThe large, beautiful Brunnshotel burned down in 1959. When you see photos of the beautiful building, it feels sad, but perhaps the new large hotel that was completed in 1961 was more profitable.\n\nToday you can book into Ronneby Brunn for conference, spa and resort, and it is popular to book different packages. Outside there are large beautiful pools that can be used by both hotel guests and the public (but this season under limited conditions so that the number of visitors is kept down).\n\nBrunnsvillorna\n\nIn Ronneby brunnspark there are a large number of beautiful wooden villas, the so-called brunnsvillorna, which are reminiscent of the time that has passed. The villas are listed and carefully renovated, and today they house various businesses, such as hostels, cafés, shops and offices.\n\nWalking in Ronneby brunnspark\n\nIt is fantastic to walk around in Ronneby brunnspark. Here you will find several different walks and areas.\n\nThe park also has natural areas that offer wild \"troll forest\". You can choose to walk the nature trail (1.5 km), the Trollsjöslingan (2 km) or the light trail (2.5 km).\n\nIn the park area itself, there are many different areas, including the \"Brunnshallarna\", where events with music and entertainment or a flea market are usually organised during the summer.\n\nRododendron in Ronneby brunnspark.\n\nThere are lots of big rhododendron bushes in Ronneby brunnspark, and we came at the perfect time (early June) to see them bloom. Absolutely fantastic! The bushes are huge and colourful, and also reflect beautifully in the water.\n\nJapanese Garden and Fragrance Garden\n\nWe also walked to the Japanese garden, and to the fragrance garden. Before entering the Japanese garden, we read an information sign about \"Japanese garden philosophy\" and about what prevents us Westerners from appreciating the value of such a garden. Interesting!\n\nWe then found the fragrance garden, which offers a wide range of fragrant plants.\n\nNature centre\n\nAfter touring the park, we took a look at the Naturum, which is also located in the park area. Here you can learn more about nature and culture in the area. We talked for a long time with one of the men who worked here, who had a lot to tell and many good tips. A very nice and interesting visit!\n\nThe Naturum is housed in a building that once served as a gymnasium. Here, the guests of the well did various gymnastic programmes as part of their health weeks.\n\nCafé Mandeltårtan\n\nAfter all the adventures in Ronneby brunnspark, we decided to visit Café Mandeltårtan. So fantastically charming and cosy! We of course wanted to order the almond cake, but it was out of stock so we ended up with a cheesecake and a raspberry mousse cake instead. Both were really good!\n\nAn excursion to Äggaboden\n\nAbout five kilometres from Ronneby Brunnspark, at Gärestad 16, is the farm shop Äggaboden. We took the motorhome here when we left Ronneby. Very nice if you want to buy some goodies, or maybe some gifts. We bought eggs, game sausages and a packet of Otto ice cream.\n\nWhere can you stay or park your motorhome?\n\nIf you want to stay at a hotel in Ronneby, you can stay at Ronneby brunn or any of the smaller hotels in the town. For those travelling with a motorhome, there are several sites to choose from. We stood on Motorhome parking area Östra piren in Ronneby harbour. We thought we were fantastically nice here, and in addition there is a service house with fresh showers and all other services you need. The price including electricity was 200 SEK/day (2021).\n\nThere is also a site at Ronneby Golf Club, even closer to Ronneby Brunnspark. In addition to this, there are three more sites or car parks for motorhomes in the municipality. Really good, we think! We stayed in Ronneby for two nights, and we were surprised at how few motorhomes were parked on these sites. Very nice!\n\nSee more in the neighbourhood\n\nDon't miss visit Karlskrona with its interesting Marine Museum and all the lovely islands. If you like good food, you can also stop by Askunga dovvilt, with its farm shop and café. It is also nice to visit the charming and historic Kristianopel. If you go in a south-westerly direction instead, you can discover Karlshamn, Sölvesborg or Kristianstad.\n\nHave you been to Ronneby Brunnspark?\n\nHow was your experience? Do you have any additional tips for Ronneby or the surrounding area?"
