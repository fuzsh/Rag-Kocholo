Everything was just perfect; check in, service at bars, boarding, I have health problems so what a difference it made to me! Brought joy back to travelling again, a massive thankyou to all!\n\nFrom the friendly guy on the Check-in desk in June and the extremely helpful and supportive security lady we were thrilled with the experience. So much so we haven’t stopped telling everyone how marvellous the staff and convenient the airport is.\n\nThe Bannatyne girl, the coffee shop lady even the Border Control all a credit to the airport. Helps the planet too as we don’t have to add further to our carbon footprint by flying local instead of driving hours to Manchester or London.\n\nJust come through your airport for the first time and WOW!!! What a great place! Staff so friendly, very relaxing, very easy check in, thorough security and polite, excellent refreshments and seating area!!! The best airport I’ve ever been to – thank you so much to you all."
