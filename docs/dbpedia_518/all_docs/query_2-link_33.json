        "text": "BTH has campuses in two cities – Karlskrona, where our main campus is located, and Karlshamn, where our smaller campus is located. Both campuses are located right by the Baltic Sea, which offers a fantastic work environment. No matter where you choose to live, you will find that there are short distances in Blekinge. There are only 40 minutes between our two campuses – and you can commute easily by train or bus. The airport, Ronneby Airport, is located close to both cities.\n\nThe city of Karlskrona was founded in 1680 as the site of the country’s new naval port and has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1998, thanks to its grand churches and squares, parade streets and naval base that attract visitors from all over the world. And all this in the middle of the archipelago – an archipelago that Unesco has designated as one of seven biosphere reserves in Sweden. Karlskrona also offers a richly varied business community in unique environments where the old meets the new. Close cooperation between BTH and the business sector has led several of Karlskrona’s companies to become leaders in a number of new knowledge areas."
