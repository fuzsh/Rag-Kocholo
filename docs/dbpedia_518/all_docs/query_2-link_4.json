        "text": "The area around the central town Ronneby has beaches at a picturesque archipelago, dense forests, over 300 lakes and more than 30 nature reserves for a relaxing vacation. The area is also an ancient cultural landscape wiht well-preserved witnesses from a historical early period.\n\nRonneby became famous because of Ronneby Brunn, the health resort at the outskirts of the city. The more than 300-year-old park Ronneby Brunnspark is one of the most beautiful parks in Europe with beautiful old buildings and a varied design.\n\nSeveral different artists' studios and one of the largest art galleries of southern Sweden in Ronneby Kulturcentrum are the evidence of the importance of art and culture in the region.\n\nThe traces of a very troubled past can still be seen clearly on the Heliga Kors Kyrka (Holy cross church) in Ronneby. The doors has the marks of battle axes from Danish soldiers who broke the doors open in 1564 and murdered townspeople who fled into the church.\n\nVery well-preserved evidence of a much earlier era can be found near the small village Listerby. Hjortsberga Gravfält is considered the best preserved Iron Age burial ground in Blekinge and the four-meters-high rune stone Björketorpsstenen from the 7th century is the second highest rune stone in Sweden.\n\nThe municipality Ronneby consists of a total of 9 places with more than 200 residents. By far the largest city and the main place of municipality is the small city Ronneby with 12,000 inhabitants. The next largest towns are Kallinge (4,600 inhabitants), Bräckne-Hoby (1,700 inhabitants) and Listerby and Johannishus with about 880 and 750 inhabitants."
