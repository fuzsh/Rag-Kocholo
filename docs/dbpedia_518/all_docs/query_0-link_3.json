The directive applies to you who are a Ukrainian citizen and were a resident of Ukraine before February 24, 2022 you who have a residence permit as a refugee or have subsidiary protec­tion status in Ukraine family members of the above two.\n\nTo be covered by the directive, you must have come to Sweden on 30 October 2021 or later, and have remained in Sweden since you entered the country. This means that if you come from Ukraine, you can get a tempo­rary residence permit in Sweden.\n\nTo apply, you must register and present a biometric national passport or other Ukrainian identity documents. You will also need to provide your fingerprints and be photographed as part of the registration process. You will receive a decision about your application for a residence permit within a few days.
