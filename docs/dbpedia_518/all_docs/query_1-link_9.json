        "text": "Ronneby is the oldest town in the region of Blekinge. The municipality has 29 000 inhabitants and is situated in the south-east of Sweden. Ronneby has a long tradition as a health resort where people from the cities in northern Europe bathed, drank life-giving water and walked in the beautiful park. With a unique position around the waterfalls and streams of the Ronneby river, and with the town centre only three kilometres from the sea and the archipelago, Ronneby is rich in natural value.\n\nIn 2011 Ronneby became officially inspired by Cradle to CradleÂ®. Today all municipal building and planning projects in Ronneby have a circular approach, aiming to use healthy materials which can be reused in cycles without losing value whilst adding to biodiversity, social cohesion and aesthetical value.\n\nFor Ronneby BAMB is a way to build knowledge and help enable a circular built environment. Cefur (Centre for Research and Development in Ronneby) is driving this effort within the municipality."
