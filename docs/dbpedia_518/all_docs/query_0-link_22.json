A city once created for the sole purpose of providing Sweden with ships in an ice-free environment and this naval competence still very much lives on – but now in a hyper modern version.

Karlskrona is a completely unique city that is also given the status of “World Heritage” by Unesco.\n\nSölvesborg\n\nEntrepreneurial spirit, heavy metal and picturesque fishing villages\n\nBeautifully located on a peninsula in western Blekinge, an hour from both Karlskrona and Malmö, is the medieval town of Sölvesborg. A town filled with driven people living their dream. Warmth, closeness and engagement are all traits of the town and the municipality is all the time actively working for the best for the people living here.\n\nIn addition to the fantastic people, a few things are significant to Sölvesborg: Our town center with Danish and medieval influences, “Listerlandet” with sandy beaches and picturesque fishing villages, Europe’s longest pedestrian bridge “Sölvesborgsbron” built in 2013, and internationally famous “Sweden Rock Festival”. Scandinavia’s largest rock festival is every summer welcoming some 35.000 visitors from all over the world and – there to listen to heavy metal super stars such as Alice Cooper, Guns N’ Roses, Kiss and Iron Maiden rocking. In Sölvesborg there is Mjällby AIF, a football team that belongs to the elite of Swedish football and who attracts a few thousand spectators during home games.\n\nIn Sölvesborg the sea is playing with the meadows and the cobble stones with white beaches. The pride of Sölvesborg, the island of “Hanö” some way out from the coastline, every year attract 40.000 visitors to a unique nature and experience.\n\nThe entrepreneurial spirit is especially strong in Sölvesborg with the town being one of the densest places in Sweden when it comes to number companies per person. Fishing villages are sharing the attention with multiple successful companies such as TitanX, Atria, Stål- och rörmontage and DOT."
