        "text": "Ronneby was incorporated on August 31, 1899. It was originally named Saint Francis, but changed when the post office was established in 1897, because that name was already in use.

In November 2008, citizens voted 18â€“9 to dissolve the city.[8] The city had also voted to dissolve in 1998 but proper procedures were not followed and the vote was invalidated.[9] In May 2009, the city became part of Maywood Township.

Ronneby had a population of 156 in 1900, 132 in 1910, and 76 in 1920.[10]\n\nRonneby was named from Ronneby, Sweden, the seat of Ronneby Municipality, near Karlskrona in Blekinge County, on the River Ronneby near its mouth in the Baltic Sea.[11]\n\nAs of the census[3] of 2000, there were 16 people, 6 households, and 3 families residing in the city.
