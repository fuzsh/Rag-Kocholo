        "text": "The aim is to increase the understanding of Nature Based Solutions (NBS) and how they contribute to improved environmental conditions for the Baltic Sea with the long term goal that a better knowledge foundation will lead to more frequent and adequate use of NBS in planning processes, as well as land- and seascape management. During the project, a number of NBS Learning Sites will be developed particularly focused on NBS connected to Multifunctional Wetlands, Coastal Water Habitats, and Watercourse Restoration. The project will pilot 1) Methods of establishing NBS Learning Sites through collaborative multi-stakeholder approaches (learning by doing), and 2) Methods to increase understanding of NBS through activities at Learning Sites (learning by experiencing). The partnership is biosphere reserves and universities in the Baltic Sea Region since their mission is to develop sustainable solutions, they involve a broad spectra of local stakeholders to enhance sustainability, and they have capacity to increase ocean literacy but are in need of areas for demonstration and knowledge generation. As endusers of the project output, BRs ensure its durability. The development of NBS Learning Sites will involve municipal technical staff, university programs with landscape approach, students, NGOs, and interest groups. After joint evaluation and refining of pilots, a broader implementation amongst project partners is applied and showcased as good practices outside the partnership."
