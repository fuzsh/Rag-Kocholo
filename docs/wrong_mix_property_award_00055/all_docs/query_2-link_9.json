        "text": "Description\n\nIn over thirty interviews conducted between 1982 and 2022, Conversations with Orhan Pamuk reveals a writer of intense literary and political engagement.\n\nNobel laureate Orhan Pamuk (b. 1952) is a foremost practitioner of the global novel today. His books have been translated into over sixty languages and sold over fifteen million copies globally.\n\nThe interviews in this volume open windows onto Pamuk's everyday life, craft, and process, constituting an alternative literary history that provides insights into the novelist's influences, method, form, and content. These conversations reveal that a Pamuk novel is predicated on methodical research, at times archival and scholarly, investigative and journalistic, or ethnographic. They are necessarily instructive and edifying as much as they are entertaining, providing a discursive space of literary history where writing, politics, and the everyday intersect and where the politics of literature can be located."
