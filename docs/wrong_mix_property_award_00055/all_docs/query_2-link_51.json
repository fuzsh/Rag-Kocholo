The leaked documents pointed to a long history of corruption, serious war crimes, and a lack of respect for the sovereignty of other democratic nations by the United States government in international dealings. â¦. The revelations she helped disclose have fueled democratic uprisings around the world, including a democratic revolution in Tunisia. According to journalistic, academic, and intellectual scrutiny her actions helped motivate the democratic Arab Spring movements, shed light on secret corporate influence on foreign and domestic policies of European nations, and, also contributed to the Obama Administrationâs agreement to withdraw all U.S. troops from occupied Iraq. â¦.The profound information that was revealed by this courageous whistleblower helped to foster public dialogue on the legitimacy, suitability, and relevancy of the military interventions carried out by US troops both in Iraq and Afghanistan. [and] led directly to calls demanding the full withdrawal of the military forces from these countries, as well as investigating committees on the treatment of detainees in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\"\n\nNote from NPPW to the Nobel Committee: The nomination was sent to the Committee the day after the new time limit (Monday 31. Jan at 12 p.m.), but within time under the time limit that has applied earlier. As argued by the Pirate Party It would be unreasonable to give the new, shorter, time limit immediate effect. NPPW will treat this a valid nomination. The committee members may use their right to confirm the Manning nomination in their first meeting in 2017. Snowden is nominated in time for 2017 in several other nominations.\n\n\"Edward Snowden (born June 21, 1983) â¦. disclosed top secret NSA documents to several media outlets, initiating the NSA leaks, which reveal operational details of a global surveillance apparatus run by the NSA and other members of the Five Eyes alliance, along with numerous corporate and international partners. â¦ He has, with great risk to his personal well-being and future, revealed the horrific scope of the global espionage network of the Anglo-American spy agencies. By releasing documents regarding the activities of clandestine agencies he has not only unveiled the global scale of mass surveillance which endanger a wide array of civil liberties (cornerstones of our liberties such as free speech and the right to privacy), he has also given the people of the world the necessary tools to counter the ever invasive path towards mass surveillance. Blatant violations to fundamental human rights have been institutionalized by US government agencies while privacy is a basic element of all the major international human rights charters and declarations. â¦ The debate on mass surveillance cannot take place without the disclosure of the basic structures and methods of the corresponding secret spy programs.\n\nRead the full nomination here\n\nNominated by Prof. of sociology Stellan Vinthagen, Uni of Massachusetts at Amherst, USA\n\nCombatants for Peace, Israel/Palestine\n\n\"Combatants for Peace is a true sign of the ability of people to find common ground and stand up for humanity in the midst of hatred, oppression and violence. These men and women have shown the amazing courage to go against the armed discourse within their respective community and collaborate with the âenemyâ, replacing the guns and bombs with nonviolent means of struggle, and stand united together in their cry for peace and justice. Together they make marches, nonviolent activism, educations for peace and they commemorate the victims on all sides. Every time they speak and represent the organization they are two persons: one Palestinian and one Israeli. Every position in the organization is having two persons: one Palestinian and one Israeli. They are a true sign of humanity and hope in a time and in a situation of violence and despair.\n\nIn line with the explicit criteria in the Alfred Nobel will Combatants for Peace have through their organization and work reduced standing armies and created peace conferences that reduces the likelihood of war.\"\n\nRead the full nomination here:\n\nNote from NPPW to the Nobel Committee: The proposal is dated Feb. 2 and thus, under the rules, is a valid nomination for 2018. The nomination addresses a local/regional problem, not in itself the global co-operation on disarmament reflected in the language on peace congresses and \"creating the brotherhood of nations\" that Nobel had in mind writing his will. However, the nomination presents the Combatants for Peace as a role model, their method to improve the relation between two nations showing the way for the world as a whole. Nobel committee members should consider using their right to table this nomination in the committeeÂ´s first meeting for 2017.\n\nNominated by Marit Arnstad, MP Norway\n\nDaniel Ellsberg, USA\n\nHigh-resolution photo here\n\n\"Has won recognition as the Â«grand old manÂ» among whistleblowers\"\n\nÂ« â¦. I 2016 er Ellsberg ogsÃ¥ blitt tildelt byen Dresdens fredspris. Seremonien ble filmet i sin helhet og er lagt ut pÃ¥ nett her. Ellsbergs tale ved seremonien starter etter en time (lÃ¸per fra 1:05 til 1:44) demonstrerer hvordan han belyser de store spÃ¸rsmÃ¥l om menneskenes sikkerhet og fremtid â og vÃ¥rt individuelle ansvar for Ã¥ hindre misbruk av militÃ¦r og politisk makt. Hans tema, Ã¥ forebygge og hindre militÃ¦r maktbruk, er selve kjerneideen i Â«prisen for fredsforkjempereÂ» som Nobel beskrev i sitt testament.\n\nGjennom media og foredrag bidrar Daniel Ellsberg til at stadig nye generasjoner blir opplyst om de utfordringene det sivile samfunn stÃ¥r overfor nÃ¥r det gjelder hemmelighold, kanskje sÃ¦rlig i situasjoner hvor forsvarsinteresser fÃ¸ler at den offentlige oppmerksomheten blir for nÃ¦rgÃ¥ende. Det er sÃ¦rlig gledelig at dokumentarskapere interesserer seg for hans livsskjebne og hans budskap.

Their work has received 16 nominations fot NobelÂ´s peace prize; the PeaceJam Foundation has been nominated 9 times for the holding of Peace Congresses worldwide, as well; and the One Billion Acts of Peace Campaign has been nominated 8 times. The key principle that underlies all of their work is our strong belief that humanity can create non-militaristic, non-killing societies, ending the proliferation of weapons and ending war.\n\nIn 2016 they launch a new initiative in Europe to help build peace between groups with ethnic backgrounds, in the wake of the Paris and Brussels bombings and the large influx of new migrants to Europe, many of whom are Muslim.\n\nNote to Nobel Committee: This is a broad mobilization of youth for peace and understanding over a long period of time, working with inspiring models of high international status (several Nobel laureates). Peace Jam (rather than the Campaign Â«One billion Acts for PeaceÂ») has a rather broad range of concerns. It would, considering NobelÂ´s intention, seem to be possible to describe the Peace Jam activity sufficiently clear in its direction against weapons and militarism to make a peace prize legitimate.\n\nRead the full nomination here.\n\nNominated by Jan Oberg, Director Transnational Foundation for Peace and Future Research, Sweden and Prof Farzeen Nasri, Ventura College, USA:\n\nRichard Falk, USA\n\nHigh-resolution photo here\n\nA legal scholar working with world order models, global governance, nuclear disarmament to realize UN Charter and peace by peaceful means\n\n\"I noticed with considerable satisfaction the emphasis the Nobel Committee chair, Kaci Kullmann Five, placed on Alfred Nobel and his will in her opening words in the Nobel speech on Dec. 10, 2015.\n\nThe reference to dialogue, negotiations, and disarmament as central aspects of Nobel's peace vision was in fine harmony with NobelÂ´s specific recipe for preventing wars by global co-operation on disarmament.\n\nProfessor Richard A. Falk, USA, is a world renown scholar who has invested unique skills and energy in a life-long commitment to Nobel's stated goals through consistent work with world order models as well as global governance based on the rule of law and a strong democratic civil society.\n\nHis immense production - based on both academic and on-the-ground work - directly points to the many opportunities for creating a world in which there are no nuclear weapons and most conflicts are solved in adherence with the UN Charter's highest norm (Article 1) that peace shall be created by peaceful means - a term which by definition implies nuclear abolition, de-militarisation and the achievement of the world community's decade old commitment to general and complete disarmament.\n\nRead the full nomination Here (Nasri) and here (Oberg)\n\nNominated by Prof. of Philosophy and Religion Hope May, Central Michigan Uni, USA:\n\nBenjamin Ferencz, USA\n\nAt 96, he reminds us of the work that we have yet to accomplish â such as criminalizing aggressive war â\n\nand realizing Nobelâs vision to build a world order where the Law takes precedence over Power, and\n\nwhere the Power of Law is stronger than the Law of Power. He appeals to young people to continue this\n\nintergenerational project. For these efforts, Ferencz deserves to be recognized by the worldâs population\n\nand to be seen as a most ardent worker in the full awakening of the human conscience, slow and halting\n\nthough it is.\n\nRead the full nomination here\n\nEarlier nomination, here\n\nNominated by Prof. em of Law and International organization Richard Falk, Uni of Princeton:\n\nJohan Galtung, Norway\n\n\"Johan Galtung has been the sort of dedicated warrior for peace that it seems to me the Nobel Prize was created to honor and by so doing raise public consciousness of what must happen if we are to overcome the war system and enjoy the material, political, and spiritual benefits of living in a world of peace premised on the nonviolent resolution of disputes among sovereign states and respect for the authority of international law.\n\nFor decades Johan Galtung has been an inspirational presence in the field of peace studies broadly conceived. His exceptional vitality and mobility has brought this message of understanding and insight into peace with justice to the four corners of the planet in a remarkable fashion that is truly unique in its educational and activist impact. It is no exaggeration to write that he invented and established the field of peace studies as a respected subject of study in institutions of higher learning throughout the world. As a consequence of his charismatic speaking ability and seminal writing Johan Galtung has reached the hearts and minds of thousands of people throughout the world, conveying the belief above all that peace is possible through the dedicated efforts of ordinary people if they are work to change the political climate sufficiently to educate the public and exert pressure on the political leaders of the world as well as on global media.\n\nWith all due respect, the time is long overdue to honor those who through thought and deed have brought Alfred Nobelâs vision to life for students and activists of all civilizational backgrounds. It is only by creating this global peace consciousness at the grassroots level that we can have any realistic hope of overcoming the entrenched militarism and autocratic politics that remains so dominant in governmental bureaucracies throughout the world.\"\n\nFull nomination here.\n\nEarlier nomination here.\n\nNominated by Director of a peace research institute, the Basel Peace Office, Alyn Ware, Switzerland:\n\nGlobal Zero, international organization\n\nNursultan Nazarbayev, President of Kazakhstan\n\nKaripbek Kuyukov, Kazakhstan\n\n\"Nuclear weapons are primarily a political weapon, not one currently used in the battlefield. As such, there is no single approach to eliminating the threat. Success in achieving nuclear abolition will require a combination of approaches, some emphasizing the inhumanity and illegality of nuclear weapons, others emphasizing the economic and political costs, and others emphasizing the possibilities to achieve security without relying on nuclear deterrence. â¦. Global Zero leaders include very influential legislators and former officials from the nuclear armed and allied States. They produce influential reports and hold effective consultations and meetings in the capitals of nuclear- armed states.\n\nGlobal Zero youth have been instrumental in raising the issue through social media, at international conferences, in mainstream media, and most recently in the US presidential election campaign, where they managed to raise the nuclear weapons issue in town hall meetings with most of the presidential candidates.Â»\n\nPresident Nazarbayev:\n\nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev stands out as a leader who has taken a number of significant nuclear disarmament initiatives during his 22 years as leader of Kazakhstan. â¦.not only has a commitment to the achievement of a nuclear-weapons-free world, but continues to take a number of initiatives that are influential in the process to achieve such a world.

Furthermore, the successful nominee should meet the criteria specified by Alfred Nobel in his will.\n\nIt is clearly unrealistic to expect in the foreseeable future âthe abolition or reduction of standing armies,â but the reduction and abolition of nuclear armaments is a feasible and, indeed, urgent task of the world community. It is also an obligation under Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This was reiterated in the unanimous opinion of the International Court of Justice issued on July 8, 1996, which stated that âthere exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament.â\"\n\nRead the full nomination here (a shorter version was posted in the new online nomination system)\n\nRead earlier nomination(s) here\n\nNominated (2016) by Christian Juhl, MP, Denmark (also in 2015):\n\nDr. Jan Oberg, Sweden\n\n\"In 2015, Mr. Oberg used the occasion of TFF's 30th Anniversary, to mobilize the foundationÂ´s great network\n\nfor an international seminar with its Associates, webcast live around the world and resulting in 15 videos on\n\ninternational affairs.

Instrumental individuals in the creation of the organization has been Kathy Kelly of Voices in the Wilderness (now Voices for Creative Nonviolence), who herself repeatedly has brought medicine into Iraqi people despite the sanctions during the 1990s, and Medea Benjamin of the feminist peace organization Code Pink. â¦.\n\nSeptember 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows has been nominated both 2003 and 2004 but now, in the period of the failed War on Terror it should be obvious to people how the reconciliation work of this organization is the way forward, not the kind of escalations, warmaking and illegal drone attacks that the US, France, UK and others have emphasized. Their website: http://peacefultomorrows.org\"\n\nNOTE, NPPW to the Nobel Committee: The nomination mentions the organization, but also clearly points to two central persons. Since Alfred Nobel primarily saw his prizes as meant for individuals, it would be right (in the committeeÂ´s first meeting) to consider this as a nomination of all three.\n\nRead the full nomination (2016) here. Kathy Kelly and Medea Benjamin have been renominated for 2017.\n\nNominated by Members of Parliament, Sweden: Jens Holm, Annika Lillemets, Wiwi-Anne Johansson, Carl Schlyter, Lotta Johnsson Fornarve, Amineh Kakabaveh, Valter Mutt, Daniel Sestrajcic, Annika Hirvonen Falk, Hans Linde\n\nEdward Snowden, USA (in exile)\n\nHigh-resolution photo here\n\nAlfred Nobel intended that the Peace Prize would promote disarmament. Today, militaries around the world place ever greater emphasis on engagement in cyberspace, with its almost unlimited possibilities for spying, disruption, and destruction. No one has sounded the alarm more eloquently than Edward Snowden as regards military encroachment upon the world's systems of electronic communication, and how such encroachment violates rights of privacy and threatens the continued existence of democracy.\n\nEdward Snowden became one of history's great whistleblowers when he revealed to leading journalists that the United States conducts all-encompassing mass surveillance around the world. In a conscientious and responsible manner, he exposed a system in which the phone, internet and other communications of individuals and whole nations are intercepted and permanently stored. Snowden insisted that it must be up to an informed global citizenry to decide whether they wish to live in a world in which they are constantly monitored by the United States military. With courage and careful judgment, he initiated a global debate about surveillance systems that operate beyond democratic control and the rule of law. Many states are now trying to build up similar capacities as the US. SnowdenÂ´s work has permitted an open and democratic debate, globally, about the risks of cyberwarfare and global surveillance.\n\nSnowden's contribution is of particular importance today, when the American military's capacities for interception and disruption in cyberspace are under the authority of a new commander-in-chief. President Donald J. Trump has expressed little intention to respect legal or ethical limits on the use of his power. It is therefore a particularly suitable moment to award the Nobel Prize for Peace to Edward Snowden.\n\nNominated (2016) by Prof. Jeff Bachman, American Uni, Washington, USA\n\nDavid Swanson, USA\n\nHigh-resolution photo here\n\n\"In 2015, World Beyond War grew dramatically under Swanson's direction to include people in 129 nations. World Beyond War produced a book authored by Swanson titled A Global Security System: An Alternative to War that has had an impact on discussions of U.S. foreign policy. Swanson has been a consistent and determined advocate for change in U.S.\n\nIn 2015, Swanson published numerous articles and gave many speeches advocating peace and the abolition of war. His articles are collected at DavidSwanson.org. He was an advocate of the nuclear agreement with Iran. Swanson visited Cuba in 2015, met with the staff of the not-yet U.S. embassy, and advocated for better and more just relations, including an end to the embargo and the return to Cuba of its land in Guantanamo. Also in 2015, Swanson has been active in the community of activists who oppose the entire institution of war, as well as in the general public through writing and speaking for reducing militarism and rethinking the idea that war is inevitable.\n\nIt is also important to note Swanson's role with RootsAction.org. In 2015, Swanson worked as campaign coordinator for the online activist site. Through a combination of online and \"real world\" activism, RootsAction.org has successfully brought pressure to achieve numerous steps toward peace, while building an online activist membership of 650,000 people for future action. In December 2015, a RootsAction.org and World Beyond War petition urged the Congressional Research Service to resume reporting on international weapons sales after a three year hiatus. Within weeks, the CRS released a new report. â¦ In January 2015, after a RootsAction.org petition pushed the United States to negotiate with North Korea rather than rejecting its offer to halt nuclear tests, the U.S. did begin negotiating -- with outcome yet to be determined. \"\n\nSee the full 2016 nomination here\n\nRenominated for 2017 by Prof. Phillip Naylor, Marquette Uni, Milwaukee, USA\n\nRead the full nomination here\n\nNobel laureate Desmond Tutu has given warm recognition for David SwansonÂ´s World Beyond War, see this video\n\nNominated by Prof Alf Petter HÃ¸gberg, Uni of Oslo (also in 2015, with co-nominators Nils Christie and StÃ¥le Eskeland):\n\nÂ«I resubmit the nomination for 2015, ... In addition I would like to mention that in 2015, âthe last expired year,â IALANA, Peter Weiss, and the German section have continued to clarify the illegality of nuclear weapons law cooperating with and backing the case Marshall Islands is conducting at the UN Court, ICJ, on the obligations of nuclear-armed nations to engage in efficient procedures to abolish nuclear weapons. IALANA makes valiant efforts to develop international law through a treaty banning nuclear weapons adopted in international diplomacy.\n\nThe German IALANA branch is particularly active in a âPeace trough Lawâ project seeking to strengthen international law and make it a well known and operative feature of national and international relations. This work is at the core of NobelÂ´s idea of a âprize for the champions of peace.â The resort to court instead of arms was a key component of the peace thinking of Bertha von Suttner (arbitration and Schiedsgerichte) and the work of the âchampions of peaceâ that Alfred Nobel wished to support by his prize.\n\nâ¦ To develop a world governed by law, not power, was a central concern of Nobel using the term Â«brotherhood of nationsÂ» in his will and is central to the activities of the IALANA community.\n\nÂ«\n\nSee the full 2016 nomination here , the 2015 nomination here.\n\nRenominatâed 2017, by Prof Alf Petter HÃ¸gberg, Uni of Oslo here.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize Watch\n\nGUIDELINES\n\nfor screening nominations qualified to win the Nobel âprize for the champions of peaceâ:\n\nWhile others, the committee, parliamentarians, peace researchers, even peace people base\n\ntheir views on a VERY wide understanding of Â«peaceÂ» (= they use the prize as they like) the\n\nNPPW list is based on studies of what counts under the law, what Nobel actually wanted.\n\nThe best, most direct, access to NobelÂ´s own understanding of the âchampions of peaceâ he\n\ndescribed in his will lies in his correspondence with Bertha von Suttner, the leading peace\n\nprotagonist of the period. The letters deal with breaking the arms race-driving logic of the old\n\nsaying: âIf you wish peace, prepare for warâ and how to make countries agree on this.\n\nThus the purpose of Nobel - to liberate all nations from weapons, warriors and wars â has\n\nbeen decisive in our screening. The prize is primarily meant to prevent wars, not resolve old\n\nconflicts. It is not a prize for good deeds, but for a basic reform of international relations.\n\nCandidates that work for global co-operation on international law and disarmament directly\n\nare the primary winners â but also important work that indirectly serves to illustrate the\n\nimperative need for international demilitarization should be considered. But to deserve\n\nthe Nobel prize activities should point beyond resolution of local situations.\n\nAt the time of Nobel many statesmen listened to the voices for peace and disarmament,\n\ntoday very few officials and politicians hold the peace view that Nobel wished to support. In\n\nour view the prize must keep up with the times and in todayÂ´s world belongs mainly to the\n\ngrassroots, civil society, that contest the official culture of violence, not to leaders who just\n\nrespond to political processes as they are supposed to in a democracy.\n\n\"I like to believe that people, in the long run, are going to do more to promote peace\n\nthan our governments. Indeed, I think that people want peace so much that one of\n\nthese days governments had better get out of the way and let them have it.\" US\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower 1959\n\nAlfred Nobel would have liked to see his committee think along the same lines.\n\nNobel Peace Prize Watch, Feb 2, 2016"
