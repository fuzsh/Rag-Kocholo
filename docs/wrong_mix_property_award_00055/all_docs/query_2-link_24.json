        "text": "STOCKHOLM (CBSNewYork/AP) -- How does it feel?\n\nFive days after Bob Dylan was named the winner of the Nobel Prize in literature, no one knows how he feels about the prestigious award -- not even the Nobel judges.\n\nMore: Celebrity Birthdays | Albums By Dylan\n\nThe Swedish Academy, which bestows the annual honor, says it hasn't been able to reach Dylan since the award was announced last Thursday.\n\nPermanent Secretary Sara Danius told Swedish Radio she's been in contact with a close associate of Dylan, but not the laureate himself.\n\nThe literature award was the last of this year's Nobel Prizes to be announced. The six awards will be handed out on Dec. 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896.\n\nShe said the academy isn't making further efforts to reach him, but hopes he will accept the invitation to collect his award.\n\nDanius said: \"I have a feeling that he will get in touch.''\n\nThe musician did post an announcement on his official Twitter account following the honor on Oct. 13.\n\nThe legendary poet-musician was born on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota. He moved to New York City in the early 1960s, settling down at a home on West 4th Street, which is believed to be the inspiration for his song \"Positively 4th Street.\"\n\nDylan won an Academy Award in 2001 for the song \"Things Have Changed\" and received a lifetime achievement award from the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in 1991. In 2008, he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his contributions to music and American culture.\n\nDylan is the most unorthodox Nobel literature prize winner since 1997, when the award went to Italian playwright Dario Fo, whose works some say also need to be performed to be fully appreciated.\n\n(TM and Â© Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
