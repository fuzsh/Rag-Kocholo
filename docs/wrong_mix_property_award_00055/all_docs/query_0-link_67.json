        "text": "As voluntary agents of global change, the issues addressed by the lectures are globally relevant to the sustenance of man and the continuity of his world. They depict the revolutionary fervour in us as individual and collective stakeholders in both local and international communities.\n\nThe themes and subject matters are iconic indexes of the rhetorics of revolutionary change and principally constitute the pyratical ideology of Wole Soyinka, on whose birthday occasions they were delivered. The only thing to add, at this point, as the reader goes through the pages of this book is to reiterate the need for him or her to join the like minds, whose opinions have been expressed herein, in re-shaping humanity â€“ our common heritage. Our global humanity traverses the boundaries of race, colour, language, continent, and development.\n\nTo change the globe into a space of freedom for all, thereby fashioning a new humanity is the ultimate quest of the Pyrate. The globe is the constituency of Seadogs in their pursuit of this supreme quest.\n\nAs a non-profit organisation, NAS is given and have retained publishing rights to the papers presented and papers gotten out of transcribed speeches given at Wole Soyinka Lecture Series, and the speakers have their consented to the use of the papers either oline or to published in book form by National Association of Seadogs and its subsidiary NASCOM publications, and use the proceeds generated to support the Lecture and other charitable and advocacy initiatives of NAS.\n\nNational Association of Seadogs (NAS) retains the publishing rights to the papers (and transcribed speeches) presented at the Wole Soyinka Lecture Series. This is because the speakers have consented to the use of the papers either online or to publish in book form by NAS publishing arm, NASCOM publications, and that the proceeds should be used in full to support the Lecture and other charitable and advocacy initiatives of NAS.\n\nTHE AGREEMENT\n\n1.
