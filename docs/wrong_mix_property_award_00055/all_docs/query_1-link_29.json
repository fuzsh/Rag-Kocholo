        "text": "Nobel Prize-winning playwright Wole Soyinka, who holds the Elias Ghanem Endowed Chair in Creative Writing at UNLV, will present a public lecture Oct. 29 at the university.\n\nSoyinka's presentation, \"Faith, Rights, Terror,\" will focus on recent world events and is cosponsored by the International Institute of Modern Letters and the Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing Program at UNLV.\n\nHis talk, which will be introduced by UNLV President Carol C. Harter, is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. in the ballroom of the Moyer Student Union. It is free and open to the public.\n\nA playwright, poet, novelist, essayist, and theater director, Soyinka won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986. In 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctor of humane letters degree by UNLV because of his achievements as a statesman, an artist, and a contributor to the international dialogue on human rights - accomplishments stemming primarily from his creative works.\n\nFor additional information about the upcoming event, call the UNLV English department at 895-3533."
