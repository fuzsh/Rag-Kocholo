An enquiry into Indonesia’s lack of research culture and the failure of its post-merdeka universities Breaking the Barriers - Building World-Class Universities in Indonesia - The Case of the Humanities & Social Sciences [Based on a paper originally presented at the KIS-AIPI (Social Science Commission of Indonesian Academy of Sciences) International Seminar on “Social Sciences and Humanities in the Light of the Challenges of a Globalized World”, St Paul College, Ruteng, Flores, NTT, 18-19 November 2017] by Peter Carey [Fellow Emeritus, Trinity College, Oxford / Adjunct (Visiting) Professor FIB-UI] Introduction: Why is it that Indonesia, alone amongst the ten largest countries in the world (now ranked fourth after the US with 280 million people), is the only country not to have won a Nobel of any category since merdeka (independence, 1945)? Near neighbors like East Timor (Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo SDB, José Ramos-Horta 1996), Vietnam (Lê Dúc Tho [1911-90] 1973), Burma (Daw Aung San Suu Kyi 1991) and the Philippines (Maria Ressa 2021) have won prizes—all in the peace category—and countries of similar size from the developing world like Pakistan (Muhammad Abdus Salam [1926-96], Physics 1979, and Malala Yousafzai, Peace 2014); Brazil (Sir Peter Medawar [1915-87], joint Brazilian-British national, medicine / physiology 1960) and Bangladesh (Muhammad Yunus/Grameen Bank Peace Prize 2006)—have also been successful. It is also the case that Indonesia in its previous incarnation as the Netherlands Indies (1816-1942) was closely linked to a Nobel Prize in physiology (medicine). This was awarded in 1929 to the physiologist (medical doctor) Dr Christiaan Eijkman (1858-1930) whose discovery of Vitamin B1 (thiamine; iron) deficiency as the origin of beri-beri or Ricketts disease, opened up the whole field of Vitamins in diet. Now Eijkman was a Dutchman, although one who had spent much\n\n2 of his early career in the Indies, first as a young medical officer in Semarang, Cilacap, and Padang Sidempuan in North Sumatra (1883-85), then as Director of the Geneeskundig Laboratorium (Medical Laboratory, post-1930 Eijkman Institute) in the Military Hospital in Batavia (1888-96). But some of his research team were Indonesians. Professor Dr Achmad Mochtar (1892-1945). Photo courtesy of Wikipedia. The importance of these pribumi researchers was evidenced in the person of Professor Dr. Achmad Mochtar (1890-1945), who became the first Indonesian head of the Eijkman Institute in 1942. An outstanding molecular biologist, Mochtar successfully defended his 1926 PhD thesis at the University of Amsterdam on various strains of leptospirosis, one of which ( leptospira icteroides ) he confirmed to be the origin of Yellow Fever (Mochtar 1927). His supervisor was none other than the famous German pathologist-epidemiologist, Wilhelm August Paul Schüffner (1867-"
