        "text": "STOCKHOLM (CBSNewYork/AP) -- American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan won the 2016 Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday, a stunning announcement that for the first time bestowed the prestigious award on a musician.\n\nThe Swedish Academy cited Dylan for \"having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\"\n\nMore: Celebrity Birthdays | Albums By Dylan\n\nReporters and others gathered for the announcement at the academy's headquarters in Stockholm's Old Town reacted with a loud cheer as his name was read out.\n\nDylan had been mentioned in the Nobel speculation for years, but few experts expected the academy to extend the prestigious award to a genre such as popular music.\n\nThe academy's permanent secretary, Sara Danius, said that while Dylan performs his poetry in the form of songs, that's no different from the ancient Greeks, whose works were often performed to music.\n\n\"Bob Dylan writes poetry for the ear,\" she said. \"But it's perfectly fine to read his works as poetry.\"\n\nDylan was born on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota. He grew up in a Jewish middle-class family. He's the first American winner of the Nobel literature prize since Toni Morrison in 1992.\n\nBy his early 20s, he had taken the folk music world by storm. \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are A-Changin\" became anthems for the anti-war and civil rights movements of the 1960s. Dylan was also awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 2008 for his contributions to music and American culture.\n\nDylan moved to New York city in the early 1960s, settling down at a home at 161 West 4th Street in the West Village. The 1963 cover photo for Dylan's second studio album 'The Freewheelin Bob Dylan'' was taken nearby.\n\nThe literature award was the last of this year's Nobel Prizes to be announced. The six awards will be handed out on Dec. 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896.\n\n(TM and Â© Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
