        "text": "1. Character Study of The Swamp Dweller Hitesh Galthariya Roll No :- 08 M.A. Sem :- 04 Year :- 2015-16 Paper :- 14 The African Literature Submitted to :- Smt.S.B. Gardi Department of English M.K.Bhav.University\n\n2. Wole Soyinka is a Nigerian playwright, poet, author, teacher and political activist who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986. Wole Soyinka was born on July 13, 1934, in Nigeria and educated in England. In 1986, the playwright and political activist became the first African to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. He dedicated his Nobel acceptance speech to Nelson Mandela. Soyinka has published hundreds of works, including drama, novels, essays and poetry, and colleges all over the world seek him out as a visiting professor.\n\n3. The play is set in the swamp in the southern Nigeria. The characters include: 1 . Alu 2 . Awuchike 3 . Desala 4 . Igwezu 5 . Kadiye 6 . Makuri 7 . The Beggar The Swamp Dweller\n\n4. Alu Alu is the wife of Makuri. She is the mother of Igwezu and Awuchike. She is aged about sixty. She believes in the custom of the swamps. She thinks that the river bed is the ideal bridal bed. She has more concern for Awuchike who is in the city. She has anxiety for his safety. Her anxiety makes her shoot questions. Her questions make Makuri think of her as a fussy neurotic wife. She is hospitable like Makuri. Her reaction to the words of Kadiye shows her to be a traditionalist. Though she is outspoken, she is not for change. Alu’s understanding of the world is very limited. Igwezu’s words about his brother Awuchike set her anxiety at rest. All said, Alu is a loving and a loveable mother.\n\n5. Awuchike Awuchike is the twin brother of Igwezu. He does not appear as a character in the play. It is through telling Soyinka portrays the character of Awuchike. Ten years ago he left the swamp. The glamour of city life has changed his character. He has become a total city dweller. He is in timber business. Money making carries him off his feet. He has snapped ties with the kinsmen in the swamp. He is not a man of fair dealing. Doing business in city has made him ruthless and heartless. He goes to the extent of taking Desala from his brother Igwezu. He is a betrayer. He exemplifies the statement “city turns brother against brother”.\n\n6. Desala Desala does not appear in the play as a character. But, she is spoken off. Desala is the embodiment of the corrupt nature of the city life. Thecharacter also echoes the materialistic attitude of city dwellers. Desala marries Igwezu. Igwezu later becomes poor owing to bad returns from his business. Desala found Awuchike prospering in his business. So, Desala leaves Igwezu and marries Awuchike. It shows how city life has become morally void.\n\n7. Igwezu Igwezu is the son of Alu and Makuri. He is twin with Awuchike. He is the centre of the play. The Swamp Dwellers is a drama of revelation and Igwezu gets education through experience both in the city and in the swamp. Igwezu’s discovery of the deficiencies of the village life and the city life constitutes the primary thematic content of the play. Igwezu plays a pivotal role in the play as a truth teller. He is a character in the play who has tasted the ups and downs of life both in the village and in the city. As a swamp dweller he knows how life goes in the southern part of Nigeria. It is through him Soyinka criticizes the corrupt religious practices of Kadiye. Familial ties have meaning for him. In that aspect, Igwezu is unlike his brother Awuchike, a city dweller.\n\n8. As a city dweller for eight months, Igwezu knows the break and bounce of city life. He knows how people like Awuchike are ruthless in making money. He is a broke in business. He comes back home. His land is flooded. His hope of getting a good harvest is blasted. He is betrayed by his own brother. Desala, his wife betrays him. She changes hand. Igwezu has a frank talk with Kadiye. The talk exposes the serpent cult as a sham. Igwezu welcomes modernization to the swamp. He is ready for a change of mind. For all his thinking in terms of modernization, Igwezu does not have the grit to reclaim the land from the swamp. Igwezu’s experience of life, both in the city and in the village disillusions him. He reflects critically on his situation. He doubts the value system cherished by the community. Returning to the city again is like returning to one slough from another. He decides to entrust the land to the beggar. He rejects the Beggar’s help because he does not like one blind man leading another.\n\n9. Kadiye In physical appearance Kadiye is a contrast to the beggar. He is bulky. His fingers are heavily ringed. He is prosperous in the midst of poverty. He is a man of self‐importance. As the priest of the serpent he fleeces the swamp dwellers. He betrays the trust of the villagers. He encourages the serpent cult. He has set his eye on Igwezu’s money. As a priest he is not bothered about Igwezu’s lot. He exploits the villagers knowing full well they are in straits. Soyinka satirizes the corrupt practices ail the society living in superstition living in superstition through Kadiye.\n\n10. Makuri Makuri is the father of Igwezu and Awuchike. He is the husband of Alu. As a husband he is conceited. He is fond of teasing his wife. His continuous bickering with his wife is only a show. He has perfect mutual understanding with his wife. He is a good host. He offers canebrew to the beggar. He gives himself totally to the serpent cult. Though he is seemingly angry he has consideration for his fussy wife Alu. He represents the note of tradition in the play. His affection for his wife is unsentimental. He is more intelligent than his wife. Igwezu exposes Kadiye’s corrupt practice. Makuri feels offended over it. He is afraid of facing the wrath of the villagers. Soyinka through Makuri emphasizes the importance and the value of marital ties between husband and wife. He does not have delusions about the character of Awuchike. Nor does he have it in him to console Igwezu who has come back betrayed by his wife Desala."
