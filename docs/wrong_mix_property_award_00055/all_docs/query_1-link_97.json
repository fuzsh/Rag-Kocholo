He is a descendant of the rulers of Isara. At the time, Nigeria was a British colony. He is the second of seven children.\n\nHis siblings are Atinuke Tinu Aina Soyinka, Femi Soyinka, Yeside Soyinka, Omofolabo Folabo Ajayi-Soyinka, and Kayode Soyinka. Folashade Soyinka, his younger sister, died on her first birthday. The cultural and religious diversity of his upbringing, coupled with his early access to electricity and radio, no doubt contributed to the depth and complexity of his literary works.\n\nAs the second of seven siblings, Soyinka Soyinka was born into a family with strong ties to Nigeriaâs founding fathers. His father, Samuel Ayodele Soyinka, was an Anglican minister and headmaster, while his mother, Grace Eniola Soyinka, was a political activist and devout Anglican. Despite being raised in a religious household that blended YorÃ¹bÃ¡ and Christian beliefs and practices, he eventually lost his faith as he grew older.\n\nThe religious and cultural diversity of Wole Soyinkaâs community, as well as his access to various forms of media, undoubtedly influenced his writing. His plays, novels, poems, and essays often incorporate elements of Nigerian folklore and mythology while also addressing pressing political and social issues. Wole Soyinkaâs incisive wit and an unerring commitment to truth and justice have earned him the esteemed Nobel Prize for Literature, making him a veritable sibyl for the African continent.\n\nEducation\n\nFrom a young age, Wole Soyinka showed a writing talent and was awarded several prizes for his compositions while attending Abeokuta Grammar School. In 1946, he was accepted into Government College in Ibadan, one of Nigeriaâs premier high schools.\n\nHe then pursued higher education at University Of Ibadan, affiliated with the University of London, from 1952 to 1954. There, he studied English and Greek literature and Western history under the tutelage of British literary scholar Molly Mahood, among others. In 1954, Wole Soyinka wrote and produced the radio play Keffiâs Birthday Treat for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service. He also co-founded the Pyrates Confraternity, the first fraternity in Nigeria, during his time at university.\n\nWole Soyinkaâs early education laid the foundation for his later success as a writer and political activist. His plays, novels, poems, and essays have earned him numerous awards and accolades, including the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986. He continues to be a prominent and influential figure in Nigeria and around the world, using his writing and his voice to promote justice and freedom.\n\nAfter completing his studies at University College Ibadan in 1954, Wole Soyinka embarked on a prolific and celebrated career as a writer and political activist. In 1959, he published his debut collection of poems, Idanre and Other Poems, which earned him widespread acclaim and solidified his reputation as a leading voice in Nigeriaâs literary scene.\n\nIn the 1960s, Wole Soyinkaâs plays, such as The Trials of Brother Jero and The Lion and the Jewel, became prominent fixtures in Nigeriaâs cultural landscape. These works, which addressed themes of corruption, injustice, and abuse of power, helped raise awareness about Nigeriaâs challenges during its military dictatorships.\n\nThroughout his career, Wole Soyinka has fearlessly used his writing and voice to advocate for justice and freedom. His efforts have been recognized with numerous awards, including the esteemed Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986. He remains a preeminent and influential figure in Nigeria and beyond, using his prodigious talents to inspire and empower others.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAs a distinguished scribe and Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka has been thrice wed and twice divorced. His first nuptials were to the now-deceased British author Barbara Skeath, whom he met at the University of Leeds in the 1950s. From this union, he sired two progeny: Olaokun Soyinka and Morenike Soyinka. In 1963, he espoused a Nigerian librarian named Olaide Idowu, and they begat four more offspring: Makin Soyinka, Moremi Soyinka-Onijala, Iyetade Apampa (who has since passed), and Peyibomi Soyinka-Airewele. He also has a son named Oretunlewa Soyinka from a previous union.\n\nWole Soyinkaâs youngest daughter is named Amani Soyinka. In 1989, he tied the knot with Folake Doherty-Soyinka, and they have three sons together: Tunlewa Soyinka, Bojode Soyinka, and Eniara Soyinka. In 2014, Wole Soyinka divulged to the public that he was combatting prostate cancer.\n\nWole Soyinka is an accomplished wordsmith, having published several novels, plays, and poems throughout his career. He is renowned for his political activism, often using his writing as a vehicle to critique the Nigerian government. He was once imprisoned for his opposition to the countryâs military dictatorship in the 1960s and was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986.\n\nIn addition to his writing and activism, Wole Soyinka is a venerated academic. He studied at the University of Leeds, obtaining a degree in English literature, and later taught at various universities in Nigeria and abroad. He holds the title of professor emeritus at Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria.\n\nDespite his many accomplishments, Wole Soyinka remains modest and continues to utilize his platform to speak out against injustice. He continues to write and engage in political activism, remaining an esteemed figure in the literary world and Nigerian politics.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter obtaining his MA from the University of Leeds, Wole Soyinka set sights on crafting plays that amalgamated European theater styles with those from his YorÃ¹bÃ¡ heritage. His inaugural major play, The Swamp Dwellers, debuted in 1958, and the following year, his comedy The Lion and the Jewel piqued the interest of several individuals at Londonâs Royal Court Theatre.\n\nBuoyed by this response, Wole Soyinka relocated to London and secured employment as a play reader for the Royal Court Theatre. His plays continued to delve into Nigeriaâs fraught relationship between progress and tradition. The Invention, his first play to be staged at the Royal Court Theatre, premiered in 1957. In addition to his plays, he also published poems such as The Immigrant and My Next Door Neighbor in the Nigerian magazine Black Orpheus.\n\nWole Soyinkaâs literary prowess was celebrated in 1986 when he became the first person from Africa to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. He was hailed as an individual âwho in a wide cultural perspective and with poetic overtones fashions the drama of existence.â\n\nReed Way Dasenbrock has opined that bestowing the Nobel Prize in Literature upon Wole Soyinka is âlikely to occasion a great deal of controversy but is thoroughly merited.â He also points out that this marks the first time the Nobel Prize has been awarded to an African writer or to any writer from the ânew literatureâ in English that has emerged from the former British colonies.\n\nIn his Nobel acceptance speech, âThis Past Must Address Its Present,â Wole Soyinka addressed Nelson Mandela and his struggle for freedom in South Africa. His speech was a direct critique of apartheid and the racial segregation policies the National South African government enforced upon most of the population. In 1986, he was also honored with the Agip Prize for literature.\n\nIn August 2014, Wole Soyinka presented a recorded version of his speech, From Chibok with Love to the World Humanist Congress in Oxford, hosted by the International Humanist and Ethical Union and the British Humanist Association. The Congress theme was Freedom of thought and expression: Forging a 21st Century Enlightenment, and he was awarded the 2014 International Humanist Award. He has also served as scholar-in-residence at NYUâs Institute of African American Affairs.\n\nNet Worth\n\nWole Soyinka is a celebrated Nigerian playwright renowned for his works, which have garnered numerous accolades, including the Nobel Prize in Literature. He is also a fervent political activist, often taking a stance against the Nigerian government.\n\nIt is believed that Wole Soyinka possesses a net worth of $15 million, which he has employed to support a range of causes, such as the arts and human rights.\n\nSocial Media\n\nInstagram handle: @Wolesoyinka\n\nTwitter handle: @Wolesoyinkacentre\n\nPlays\n\nKeffiâs Birthday Treat\n\nThe Invention\n\nThe Swamp Dwellers\n\nA Quality of Violence\n\nThe Lion and the Jewel\n\nThe Trials of Brother Jero\n\nA Dance of the Forests\n\nMy Fatherâs Burden\n\nThe Strong Breed\n\nBefore the Blackout\n\nKongiâs Harvest\n\nThe Road\n\nMadmen and Specialists\n\nThe Bacchae of Euripides\n\nCamwood on the Leaves\n\nJeroâs Metamorphosis\n\nDeath and the Kingâs Horseman\n\nOpera Wonyosi\n\nRequiem for a Futurologist\n\nA Play of Giants\n\nChilde Internationale\n\nFrom Zia with Love\n\nThe Detainee\n\nA Scourge of Hyacinths\n\nThe Beatification of Area Boy\n\nDocument of Identity\n\nKing Baabu\n\nEtiki Revu Wetin\n\nAlapata Apata\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BfobJuv86yoKejkWKvqrvGq5ipoKlixKrCxKxkqaSRrsBurcaeZJunn6DAbrrErWSwp6KptW6vx6KjnaqVo3qvu8Geo2aoop7HpnnEnaycmaSevK95z6icpqtdnby2v8RmqK6npJrAcA%3D%3D"
