The Polish writer is one of the most important contemporary European authors. Her work has been translated into 37 languages and has received numerous awards.\n\nOlga Tokarczuk, born in Sulechów, Poland, in 1962, studied psychology in Warsaw and now lives in Wrocław. Her novel The Books of Jacob, was a bestseller in Poland and won the country’s highest literary honor, the Nike Literature Award, in 2015 and the Jan Michalski Prize for Literature in 2018. Also in 2018, she won the Man Booker International Prize for her novel \"Flights\", and she was nominated for the prize again in 2019, when her novel \"Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead\" was shortlisted. Her complete works are published in German by Kampa Verlag, Zurich.
