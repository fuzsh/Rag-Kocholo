But at the same time there are plenty that are, alas, less frustrating.\n\nFull Review | Dec 17, 2007\n\nNo twist is too farfetched for this Dino De Laurentiis epic.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Oct 27, 2007\n\nA good cast wallow about in a story you can't believe for a moment.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Oct 19, 2007\n\nColin Firth is not an actor who projects sparkling joie de vivre at the best of times, and The Last Legion, a cod-Roman reimagining of Arthurian myth, is very much not the best of times.\n\nFull Review | Oct 19, 2007\n\nA hunk of old Brie, left all day in the glove compartment in a car on a hot summer's day, could not smell more ripe than this absurd sword'n'sandal Roman movie.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Oct 19, 2007\n\nA novel hybrid of swords, sandals, horned helmets and furs, this really is a load of old rubbish, but there's some fun to be had, especially for boys who like to have mock sword fights with wooden sticks.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Oct 19, 2007\n\nPaper-thin characters, stilted conversations and abrupt editing mean this is hard to get involved with, and its link with Arthurian legend feels contrived and clich√©d.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Oct 19, 2007\n\nThe action sequences are handled well enough but the CGI isn't up to snuff in a tale that barely merits the retelling.\n\nFull Review | Oct 19, 2007\n\nThis attempt at reimagining the Arthurian legend fails to raise the pulse due to some leaden dialogue and unconvincing performances.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Oct 19, 2007\n\n...makes a hash of history, but...just think of it as a nifty adventure dreamed by an imaginative boy who dozed off in his grandfather's library.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Aug 31, 2007\n\nWhile it's almost certainly guaranteed to be a box office bomb, I'm suspecting this goofy little adventure will earn a few bemused fans once it hits DVD.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Aug 26, 2007"
