It is something I appreciate and want for everyone else to have…\n\nFor that reason, I am sharing the most important things we learned along the way.\n\n3 Lessons I’m Celebrating on Our 20-Year Anniversary\n\nIf you know Grant and my unconventional love story, you know we both were hard-headed in the beginning…\n\nThat, of course, did not make things easy. However, it was that same stubbornness that kept us from giving up as well.\n\nNow, here we are 20 years and two kids later.\n\nThat being said, these are the top three lessons we learned that have helped us overcome any obstacle…\n\nCommitting to and Understanding Our Roles\n\nI am going to go ahead and give you the number one lesson first…\n\nDO NOT SEEK AN “EQUAL” PARTNERSHIP. INSTEAD, DEFINE AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ROLES BASED ON YOUR STRENGTHS.\n\nAs I reflect on our 20-year anniversary, this realization is when everything fell into place. From there, it is easier to divide and conquer large and small problems alike.\n\nI encourage you to sit down with your partner and clearly define what’s needed and wanted in the relationship. Then, decide who will be the main person responsible for various aspects of it.\n\nNext, it is all about ensuring the other is the best they can be in your relationship and life.\n\nSupporting Each Other’s Growth\n\nNo matter how nice it sounds, “loving someone the way they are” is not the foundation of a good partnership.\n\nHappiness in life is dependent on continuing to learn and go after bigger and better targets.\n\nBeing alongside your spouse on that journey is what will get you to your own 20-year anniversary and beyond.\n\nNonetheless, as things change for the better, you two need to be flexible with one another…\n\nBeing Able to Adapt\n\nThe thing about life in general is that by nature unpredictable. And unfortunately, there are things we can only have so much control over.\n\nYou must be able to work with the other person as they need to pay more attention to other things.\n\nThat can look like picking up the kids so the other doesn’t have to struggle juggling family and their career. Whatever it is, as long as it moves you as a couple forward be willing to accommodate.\n\nThose are the three lessons I wanted to impart from Grant and my 20-year anniversary. But, I have another bonus piece of advice I want to share with you…\n\nKey Part of Making It to Our 20-Year Anniversary\n\nThe last thing I attribute to the success of my marriage to Grant is not a lesson per se…\n\nBut it makes a difference.\n\nThat is we always celebrate each and every victory we achieve separately and as a couple.\n\nDoing this keeps our eyes on the prize and brings us closer together. Further, it shows that all the tough times were worth it.\n\nNow that I think about it, my ability to write this on our 20-year anniversary is yet another one of those wins.\n\nI hope this article helps you achieve a similar one.\n\nFind the one you trust and build an empire.\n\n— Elena Cardone\n\nDisclaimer: This content is intended to be used for educational and informational purposes only.
