        "text": "1.\n\nWar Machine 02:16\n\nYou say I’ve got a lizard brain and it’s running down my spine. You’re living on a different plane. I’ve got a one-dimensional mind. I used to fight for heat on the ocean floor. You were waiting in the trees when I crawled upon the shore. I don’t know what you expect from me, I don’t do anything. I’m just a war machine. I don’t know what you expect from me, I don’t get to think. You built a war machine. You say I’ve got a nervous system and it’s telling me what to do. You don’t mean what you say but I listen, so that’s my point of view. Next time we meet we’ll be in different forms, but the cycle will repeat. Waging endless war.\n\n2.\n\nFangs 02:45\n\nHis instinct was to talk about the company he keeps, but predators don’t listen to the warnings of their meat. Hid in the shadows so long he forgot that spiders bite, so he scattered like an insect getting caught out in the light. Better hold up in your cave. Gotta watch out for the fangs. Don’t go out, it’s not safe. Gotta watch out for the fangs. He confused his weapons with the strength of natural might. He got put out with the trash but he was too dumb to die. You might not think they’re watching but they’re always keeping score, you better check for webs when you walk out your front door.\n\n3.\n\nSlippery and slick sick children in heat. We’re tied forever to the first ones that we meet. You grow up to live alone and you hunt for what you need. We’re feral animals spreading our seed. Hide away in memory. Tangled nerves and spoiled meat. The animals we used to be. Futures we’ll never see of standing on two feet. The animals we used to be. Running free in the street. You look at me like we’re not the same. They clipped our tails and they gave us all new names. You can put me on a leash and tell me that I’m tame, but who’s really in control, the body or the brain? Do you remember me, did we ever meet the animals we used to be? I doubt my memory, I wonder how we’d greet the animals we used to be, running free in the street.\n\n4.\n\nBehind the Concrete Veil 02:13\n\nYou drained my blood in a single bite and then drank me off on a Tuesday night. When the sun goes down your fangs come out and I’m fighting for my life. They took my shoes and locked the door they said they’d be back when they knew some more. They fed pills that glued me to the floor. I’m living in a different world behind the concrete veil. You knew I’d taste like gasoline cause you were pouring it out for me. But you got eyes like broken glass and I don’t know what you see. They strapped me to bed and asked about the angels in my head. I didn’t give up your name, but I told them what you said.\n\n5.\n\nStaring Down the Valley 02:09\n\nFrightened out of sleep, try to find my eyes. Hammered in the skull with a digital light. He’s got hands for feet, something isn’t right. Is this reality? His face looks just like mine. Staring down the valley. The difference is perceived. Staring down the valley. Mistaking you for me. It’s a long way down Boiling my brain, I’m not sure what is real. There’s a man inside my phone and he tells me how to feel. I try to get a job, I try to pay the bills. But I can’t get ahead while I’m falling down the hill.\n\n6.\n\nSilhouettes In Blue Light 02:46\n\nYou left the car in a hurry, you’ve got justice on your side. Your father raised you to be afraid of the the other side of the line. The upper hand at your hip. 300 years of rage bursting out the barrel of an ape we paid to train. We don’t need you, we get along just fine. We don’t need you and now we’re taking sides. You grew up hearing stories, the pieces were all in place. A big, supportive family proud of the hero that they raised. Take away their room to breathe, don’t wait for the fight. There was nothing there to see. Just silhouettes in blue light.\n\n7.\n\nCold // Hot 02:13\n\nI did my best just to hide it away but it comes and goes and it likes to play. I felt him reaching out for you. I kept thinking I was in control but it lies to me. I don’t feel the pull and I’m afraid of what he might do. Demons waking up. Tearing at my eyes. Crawling from the inside. Reaching out for the light. I followed you into this hole you made. There’s no way out and I’m so afraid that I don’t know which one is the dream. It’s got to be something wrong with me, I don’t blame you. I’m missing a piece, but I know you’re not exactly what you seem.\n\n8.\n\nDisposed 01:49\n\nIn this transaction I watch you grow. I make you profit, you let me go. You let me know I am disposed. The transportation of human souls. To punch a timecard then decompose. Their business grows, we will explode. Habituation becomes their goal. Potential prospects blindly controlled. The pressure grows. We will explode. In this transaction I watch you grow. I make you profit, you let me go. You let me know I am disposed. The corporation, the status quo. Accumulation of workers woes. We're toe to toe, public knows. We’re toe to toe.\n\n9.\n\nPrimitive 03:03\n\nYou’re a predator and you don’t even know it, but you got eyes right there in the front of your head. You’re a primitive and everyone can see it. You’re a slave to chemicals inside of your head. You’re the end goal. You’re a product of war, but they took your spear and put you on meds. You’re a predator and you don’t even know it, but you got eyes right there in the front of your head.\n\n10.\n\nThe Big Sleep 03:12"
