One of these people will become Uther Pendragon, but before we get into all that, you’ll have questions. Below, Genevieve helpfully talks you, the Unsuspecting Viewer, through this godforsaken film.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So, Ben Kingsley’s in this?\n\nGenevieve: Yup. He’s a Druid! Or a magician. Or a Jedi. They never say.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Where is he from? That accent’s really shitty.\n\nGenevieve: Foreignlandia.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: And this is Rome?\n\nGenevieve: Yup.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Like, This! Is! Roooo –\n\nGenevieve: Stop.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So, Colin Firth’s in this?\n\nGenevieve: Yup. He’s a General. General Politeness.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Aww. Thomas Sangster! He’s so adorable.\n\nGenevieve: Yup.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Is…that a token black dude?\n\nGenevieve: …yeah.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So they catch the kid playing around with the armor and threaten to cut off his hand, to much amusement. Is it funny to joke about cutting a kid’s hand off?\n\nGenevieve: Rome had a different sense of what was funny.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Is that Orlando Bloom as one of the special extras?\n\nGenevieve: Nah, his face moves too much.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Is it…weird the way Colin is looking at this kid?\n\nGenevieve: Yup.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Oh my God, is Ben Kinglsey actually supposed to be a Jedi for real with that staff?\n\nGenevieve: I’m sure it’s just the latent properties of his Qui-Gon Jinn wig.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Oh my God, is that Roman senator John Hannah?\n\nGenevieve: Hey, it’s been a decade since The Mummy! Rent was due!\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So, what’s the plot so far?\n\nGenevieve: Uh, this kid climbs statues, and Colin Firth is a general, and Ben Kingsley is a Jedi. And there’s a big parade! A hundred, no– two hundred extras ate for free that day! Then Kiddo’s crowned Caesar in a Byzantine temple with a huge Christian cross!\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: OMG Byzantium? In Rome?\n\nGenevieve: OMG RIGHT?\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: …but that’s weird.\n\nGenevieve: I know. Anyway, Kingsey’s fired by the Emperor’s daddy for having a shitacular accent. Colin Firth walks him out for a little Druidy exposition about protection and honor and duty and fate and stuff. Then it’s a quick conference with John Hannah and home in time to become the new head of Kiddo’s personal guard.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Is it…weird the way Colin is looking at Ben Kingsley?\n\nGenevieve: Yup.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Is it…weird the way Colin is looking at John Hannah?\n\nGenevieve: Yup.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Look, does Colin just walk around making bedroom eyes for two hours?\n\nGenevieve: Yup. Is that okay with you?\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Hell yes it is. Go on.\n\nGenevieve: So anyway, they’re betrayed and attacked! By some Celty people who apparently want one-third of Rome and Colin Firth’s hot body.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Oh my God, is that Celtic barbarian guy KEVIN MCKIDD?\n\nGenevieve: RENT WAS DUE.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: You’re secretly enjoying this, aren’t you?\n\nGenevieve: Look, Colin Firth just survived the sack of Whatever City This Is. I’m going to keep enjoying it until he takes the big sleep, okay?\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Oh my God, is that random messenger DOCTOR BASHIR?\n\nGenevieve: RENT.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: I’m sorry, the bad guy’s name is Odawaka?\n\nGenevieve: Something like that. I didn’t make up the names.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So on the way to Capri, Colin Firth is going to single-handedly get the kid back and then run to the “Eastern Empire” for sanctuary just because Dr. Bashir said it would be totally cool?\n\nGenevieve: Look, this is about the fall of Rome. And Rome fell because of Colin Firth being a moron, okay?\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: And Aishwarya Rai?\n\nGenevieve: Look, unmarried wimmins were constantly running around being warriors and shit in the Eastern Empire of Foreignlandia, okay?!\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Okay, okay!\n\nGenevieve: I just wish you’d get off my back sometimes about things I can’t help, you know?\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: I’m sorry. So how’s she doing?\n\nGenevieve: She walks in slow motion towards a lusty fisherman and then punches him right off the dock so they can steal his boat.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: …huh!\n\nGenevieve: Sadly, that’s more interesting then the next part where Ben Kingsley gets strung up by Kevin McCeltic and he sees Excalibur. In Capri. Just…in a house in Capri. You know, whatever. Oh, also, Romulus “Kiddo” Caesar finds Excalibur in one of the Lara Croft reject scenarios where you push on some mosaic’s eyelids and drop three stories through some wooden beams and remain utterly unhurt.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: I played that one when I was thirteen!\n\nGenevieve: I’ll bet you did.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Shut up.\n\nGenevieve: Anyway, then Aishwarya handles the huge lance between Colin’s legs until he shoots it straight into the sky.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: WHAT?\n\nGenevieve: Look, I just report the news, okay?\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Ugh. What the hell. Talk about the kid, that other stuff’s disgusting.\n\nGenevieve: He finds a sword. Whatever. I’m sure it’s not important.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: And then?\n\nGenevieve: Oh, I dunno, Aishwarya Rai takes out, like, six dudes with a big sword-dance thing, right in front of all the special extras who are standing around feeling like dorkasses.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: …you’re ENJOYING this.\n\nGenevieve: Oh, so sorry, how selfish of me to enjoy a movie scene! Let me slap Aztec Rex in my DVD player right away!\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Okay, okay, calm down. So Aishwarya kicks ass and takes names. That’s nice.\n\nGenevieve: Yeah. Then Colin rescues Kiddo.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Um, is it weird how Kiddo is hugging Colin tightly and Colin’s staring kind of soulfully into Kiddo’s eyes in the middle of –\n\nGenevieve: Yup.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Wait, so everyone bails? And Colin’s fighting the same twelve extras, like, four more times! What about his special extras?\n\nGenevieve: In the boat, being extra-y, waiting for Colin and Aishwarya to jump off the cliff and get in the boat already.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: God, they’re so selfish! I hate when people keep me waiting.\n\nGenevieve: Right?\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So, the sword?\n\nGenevieve: Belonged to Julius Caesar.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Oh, of COURSE.\n\nGenevieve: Listen, Ben Kingsley says so. Jedi don’t lie.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Sometimes they do.\n\nGenevieve: Okay, save it for Comic-Con. Look, beach! Bashir and John Hannah look like they spent the day in a sunbeaten-squinting contest. If one of them didn’t rat out the Romans to the Celts I’m going to be very surprised.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: And the young Caesar?\n\nGenevieve: Oh, he’s only a little boy. A creepy, needy little boy who is constantly hugging people as soon as they come within reach of his freakish, spidery arms.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Dude, Bashir and John Hannah were BOTH in on the plot to sell out the Romans! Colin and crew are gonna have to kill some character actors and bust out!\n\nGenevieve: Damn, I’m good.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So wait, Ben Kingsley’s Gandalf the Molotov Cocktail-thrower now?\n\nGenevieve: …I just report the news. Anyway, Colin kills John Hannah, and Aishwarya kills Bashir, and now they’re both outlaws and whatever!\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Ooh, a well-composed shot! At the fifty-four minute mark.\n\nGenevieve: It’s like a treat for making it halfway through.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Is it weird how Kiddo is looking at Colin –\n\nGenevieve: YES, IT IS WEIRD, WHAT CAN I DO.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: …holy shit, is their mountain pass the Pass of Carahdras?\n\nGenevieve: Dude, it totally is! I call shenanigans!\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: …and didn’t they land at the same beach they just left?\n\nGenevieve: I guess they ran out the budget flying to New Zealand for the mountain-pass shot.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So how do you get from the mountain passes to the beach with no indication of a boat.\n\nGenevieve: Colin Firth threw them across the sea one at a time.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: …IS THE CELTIC RUFFIAN GUY A LUCHA LIBRE WRESTLER?\n\nGenevieve: NO COMMENT.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Okay, so in the face of El Celtico over there, what do the Romans do?\n\nGenevieve: Uh…Hadrian’s Wall something something taking refuge in a village something.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: You were lost in Colin Firth’s eyes, weren’t you?\n\nGenevieve: They’re like puppies. Beautiful brown puppies.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Well, can you wake up and explain why Ben Kingsley is Marion the Librarian at story hour over at the village?\n\nGenevieve: Look, when metal falls from the sky someone has to tell someone else about it, or how else would you know from what the magical sword of Julius Caesar was forged?\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Okay, I don’t even know where to begin with all the wrong in that sentence.\n\nGenevieve: I know. Just concentrate on Colin Firth and Aishwarya pretending to flirt. And then fighting with swords!\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Oh, just make out, you guys.\n\nGenevieve: RIGHT?\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Is it weird how the twelve-year-old Kiddo asks to get in bed with Aishwar –\n\nGenevieve: YES.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Was there supposed to be a Roman legion around here someplace?\n\nGenevieve: Look, I can’t help you. Every time they show Colin Firth I forgive the movie everything.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: …is this LORD OF THE RINGS MUSIC?\n\nGenevieve: Well, I won’t be forgiving THAT.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Do they ever explain why everyone has British accents except Ben Kingsley?\n\nGenevieve: Nope.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So, is Kingsley like a Druid, or a wizard, or – I mean, really, is Jedi our best guess?\n\nGenevieve: Dude, may the Force be with you.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Oh my God, are Colin and Aishwarya getting it on?\n\nGenevieve: Hell yes they are!\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: But no kissing?\n\nGenevieve: Aishwarya don’t play that.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Can I kiss him instead?\n\nGenevieve: Get in line.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Uh, is it weird the way Colin is kneeling and passionately grabbing Kiddo by the shoulders and hugging him and –\n\nGenevieve: I CANNOT HELP YOU.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: This movie is sick.\n\nGenevieve: No argument. Look, a nice wholesome fight scene!\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Ooh, more than five extras at a time!\n\nGenevieve: We pull out all the stops here in Foreignlandia.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Oh my God, is this true gay love between the two main extras, one of whom is about to meet his maker?\n\nGenevieve: It is! At last, a reason to rent. Well, that and the big battle with the legion!\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: What the fuck, the legion showed up? Was it over at Grandma’s house this whole time or something?\n\nGenevieve: I have no clue.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So were the villagers actually Roman soldiers?\n\nGenevieve: I don’t know.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: But they have all this armor –\n\nGenevieve: THIS MOVIE HAS NO PLOT, OKAY?\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Why is Aishwarya, the only woman, the one running after the kid like a babysitter?\n\nGenevieve: Oh, you know chicks. They’re way into child-rearing.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: We’re in the middle of a BATTLE.\n\nGenevieve: Well, then there’s no time to lose! She better rear that kid post-haste!\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So Kiddo kills Kevin McCeltic but good, and we’re all going to live happily ever – holy shit, Colin Firth is going to die five minutes from the end from one slap with a stick?\n\nGenevieve: Look, you saw Gladiator, right? You knew this was coming.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Is it weird that I have all these…strange…feelings about the Kiddo when he’s being all commanding and kingly and –\n\nGenevieve: YES IT IS. STOP THAT.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: So he’s not Arthur.\n\nGenevieve: No.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: He’s Arthur’s dad.\n\nGenevieve: I guess.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: And what about poor Aishwarya, who will never make out with Colin again?!\n\nGenevieve: Well, technically she didn’t make out with him the first time.\n\nUnsuspecting Viewer: Is there still a line for that?"
