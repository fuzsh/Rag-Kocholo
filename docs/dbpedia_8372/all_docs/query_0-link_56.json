Accompanied by his friends and a mysterious envoy from Constantinople, Romulus travels to Britannia in search of the Last Legion â€” the fabled Dragon Legion. There, Romulus will fight alongside his friends to make his last stand for Rome, and take his first steps to becoming the man and the King who started the Arthurian legend."
