        "text": "A few years on from Daniel Craig's 007 departure, and we're still none the wiser as to who will play the next James Bond.\n\nWe have some ideas, though. As of writing, there is one clear frontrunner emerging, plus a handful of names who have been talked about as the next James Bond or responded to the endless speculation surrounding the part.\n\nHere's what we do know about the situation pre-Bond 26: Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson want someone who can play the the next James Bond for a decade and a \"thirty-something\" Bond. That might knock some long-term favorites out of the running. One such contender, Idris Elba, has seemingly stepped aside anyway. Another actor who's taken themselves out of consideration is Taron Egerton, who curiously told Total Film: \"Yeah. I mean, I think they've already got someone, and it's not me.\"\n\nSo who is the next 007? We've got the likeliest candidates below, as well as a few wildcard entries for good measure. Grab your martini and settle in for our roundup of the 25 actors we think could be the next James Bond.\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson\n\nPreviously, Aaron Taylor-Johnson hadn't been widely seen as a frontrunner to replace Daniel Craig as Bond. Multiple new reports from The Sun, however, changed things. The UK newspaper says the Kick-Ass and Bullet Train actor had a screen test in September 2022 and producer Barbara Broccoli \"loved him.\" 18 months later and sources close to the same publication said, \"Bond is Aaron's job, should he wish to accept it.\" Might we be looking at the next 007?\n\nTom Hardy\n\nObvious? Maybe. But there’s a reason why the British actor’s currently one of the bookies’ favorites to take over from Daniel Craig. Hardy has showcased his action chops in the likes of The Dark Knight Rises and Mad Max: Fury Road, showing a physical transformation throughout his career that would lend itself well to a hard-hitting Bond.\n\nOne thing that may count against Hardy – especially if the Bond producers are thinking long-term – is his age. Hardy will be nearing his 50s by the time the cameras get rolling. It’s no real roadblock for someone of Hardy’s talents – but the franchise could go in a different, younger direction. Roger Moore in A View to a Kill should be a cautionary tale.\n\nHenry Cavill\n\nAnother household name, another Bond frontrunner. Those who have seen Henry Cavill in The Man from UNCLE will know that stepping into a tux won’t be much of a problem for the Man of Steel actor. He’s got the looks, charm, and could easily slide into the role with minimum fuss. Cavill even previously auditioned for the role, losing out to Craig in 2005 when he was just 22 years old.\n\nThere are many marks against Cavill, though none are of his own making. He has departed The Witcher after three seasons, and any Superman-shaped holes in his schedule have disappeared despite the character's return in Black Adam. Can he hold down a franchise anymore? The fact that the Bond head honchos don’t usually go for an actor with huge name recognition also counts against him. That’s not their style; Cavill might be ruled out on that alone.\n\nIdris Elba\n\nIdris Elba is bloody cool, isn’t he? On that alone, he should be Bond. Then you look at his body of work: from The Wire to Beasts of No Nation and beyond, Elba has showcased his considerable talents across big-budget blockbusters, small-scale crime dramas, and even Knuckles.\n\nIt’s Luther, the BBC series that sees Elba play a London detective, that offers the most compelling case for the British star to become the first Black actor to play Bond. His presence is unmatched, and Luther has gone toe-to-toe (and often punch for punch) with a rogues’ gallery that wouldn’t look out of place in a 007 flick. Did we also mention he’s really, really cool?\n\nAgain, age could work against the actor – Elba’s 51. Plus, for his part, Elba told Capital XTRA in early 2021 that he’s aware of the rumors – but content with his lot. \"I know the rumors about Bond have always chased me,\" he said. \"Listen, my poor mum is like ‘One day you’re going to get it!’ I was like ‘Mum, I’m good, I’ve got Luther!’ I’m definitely doing that.\"\n\nMore recently, he told ITV that he's definitively \"not going to be the next James Bond.\" End of story? Maybe. Maybe not. Producer Barbara Broccoli told Deadline that his long-term link to the role has been \"part of the conversation\" and added that the pair were friends, calling him a \"magnificent actor.\"\n\nElba has also lately reaffirmed that he's sticking with Luther, telling the World Government Summit in Dubai: \"You know, a lot of people talk about another character that begins with 'J' and ends with 'B,' but I'm not going to be that guy. I'm going to be John Luther. That's who I am.\" (H/T The Independent)\n\nRege-Jean Page\n\nThanks to his role as the Duke of Hastings in Netflix’s Bridgerton, Rege-Jean Pagewas once at the front of some observer's next James Bond lists (including some bookies), establishing himself as a charming favourite – and the most likely to leave audiences feeling a little hot under the collar.\n\nPage even has a former Bond’s seal of approval, with Pierce Brosnan telling Entertainment Tonight that he would be a \"wonderful\" choice to replace Bond.\n\nEven if the whole Bond thing doesn’t shake out (and it has gone a little quiet on that front), Page has another spy project in the works. Ironically, it’s a reboot of The Saint, the show that put Roger Moore on the map before he made the leap to the Bond franchise.\n\nLashana Lynch\n\nLashana Lynch, who played new 007 agent Nomi in No Time to Die, is someone who has been spoken about in hushed tones as someone who could maybe, just maybe, take over as the series’ new lead. Her performance in Daniel Craig's Bond swan song was met with positive reviews, with critics citing her character’s straight-shooting attitude and clear aptitude with a quip or two always ready in the holster.\n\nLynch becoming the new lead would be a major step forward, and would mean rethinking how audiences see the franchise – potentially as a series without James Bond at the center, but a new 007.\n\nOn the topic of a potential female James Bond, however, the creatives behind the series look set to keep the character male. Producer Barbara Broccoli told the Press Association (H/T The Independent) that \"James Bond is a male character,\" while Daniel Craig said James Bond shouldn’t be played by a woman – because there’s a need for strong female roles away from the long shadow of an iconic male character.\n\n\"The answer to that is very simple,\" he said in a Radio Times interview. “There should simply be better parts for women and actors of color. Why should a woman play James Bond when there should be a part just as good as James Bond, but for a woman?”\n\nNomi’s certainly a great female part – the question remains whether the producers are ready to move forward without James Bond as the series’ lead.\n\nCillian Murphy\n\nA good secret agent needs to be a jack of all trades. Cillian Murphy is a step above that, often disappearing into his roles in everything from his Oscar-winning turn in Oppenheimer and Peaky Blinders to a member of a horror ensemble in A Quiet Place Part 2. And those are just some of his recent projects.\n\nThere’s little wonder, then, that Murphy’s in the frame to play James Bond – he’s got the action chops, the looks, the style, the swagger, and just about anything else that’s ever been associated with the role. The only question mark might be whether Murphy can truly hold up a franchise - and he answered that emphatically with his role in Oppenheimer.\n\nMurphy, however, is now also one of the older candidates at 47 years old.\n\nSam Heughan\n\nAnyone who has seen Sam Heughan in either Outlander or SAS: Red Notice will know the Scot would comfortably marry Daniel Craig’s softer sensibilities with the modern-day muscular tendencies required to be an all-out action hero. Red Notice, more than most projects, felt like a secret audition for Bond – one passed with flying colours.\n\nHeughan is one of many actors to address speculation on whether he’d want to play Bond. He told Esquire: \"He's a great character, and would certainly be a fascinating character study and place to kick off.\" At 43, though, Heughan risks falling into the 'not quite spritely enough to lead a new action franchise for the next 20 years' – a category many speculators believe the next James Bond will likely fall into.\n\nSope Dirisu\n\nThose who know Sope Dirisu from Gangs of London have already seen a starmaking performance bolstered by the action chops and physical presence required for a modern-day 007. He’s also someone who had admitted he tries to do all his own stunts – which could give him the edge in any potential audition process.\n\nTime, too, is on his side. At 33, he’s among the youngest of the leading names for the gig – and Dirisu himself is aware that his name has been in the frame for a while.\n\n\"It’s something that has crept up over time,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter of his name being linked to the Bond franchise. \"But then you do a Gangs of London, and the world gets to see you.\"\n\nRichard Madden\n\nRichard Madden certainly fits the mold of the next Bond: a recognisable actor, but not too much of a big name; stoic when he needs to be, and always has a one-liner handy. Madden’s career so far has seen him lead and lead well – The Bodyguard and Game of Thrones are both highly adept performances that should have producers eyeing him up as a potential Bond.\n\nAt 37, Madden is around the same age Daniel Craig was when cast as 007, so the franchise’s long-term future would be in safe hands.\n\nJack Lowden\n\nJack Lowden has shot to the top of a handful Bond wishlists after his turn as agent River Cartwright in the critically acclaimed Apple series Slow Horses.\n\nAs is tradition, seemingly every thirtysomething actor (especially someone in a spy series) is linked with Bond – or has commented on it. Lowden is no different.\n\nSpeaking to Radio Times, he said he doesn’t \"envy\" the task of picking a replacement, though his co-star Kristin Scott Thomas suggested he’d be \"very good\" at picking up the Bond baton from Daniel Craig.\n\nDev Patel\n\nThe mere thought of having a Bond born in the ‘90s may turn some of us to dust, but Dev Patel would fit the character like a glove. His age counts in his favor, but it’s his continually more accomplished performances throughout his relatively short career that make him rise above most other candidates.\n\nThe Green Knight has cemented Patel as one of Hollywood’s leading lights, while stints in The Newsroom and The Personal History of David Copperfield show off a more restrained side that’s often required for the Bond job. The acclaim around Monkey Man bolsters his case further.\n\nSpeaking to Total Film, Patel expressed faint bemusement at being linked with Bond, but is happy to be part of the conversation. \"I don’t know why that is,” he said. “I guess that I should take it as a compliment. But I feel like hasn’t every young British actor been associated with Bond at some point, I’m sure?\" Sorry, Dev. As this article shows, we're probably not helping at this point.\n\nHarris Dickinson\n\nAs resumes go, they don't get far more impressive at 27 than Harris Dickinson. So far in his fledgling career, he's appeared in the likes of Triangle of Sadness, The King's Man, and The Iron Claw. That effortless straddling between blockbuster and indie darlings is likely to endear himself to those involved in the casting process.\n\nFor his part, he told ES Magazine in 2022 that he doesn't think he will be in the frame for the next James Bond. An MI6-style ruse or merely keeping his cards close to his chest? Either way, those are tactics that will make for a good 007.\n\nTom Hiddleston\n\nTom Hiddleston may lack the physical presence of a Daniel Craig or Sean Connery but you only need to look at his lead role in BBC miniseries The Night Manager (which is making a surprise return soon) to see why he’s tailor made to be the next Bond. Emphasis on tailor.\n\nYes, he looks annoyingly good in a suit and, yes, he seems to ooze charisma across from any female lead (both hallmarks of any Bond actor), but he’s also got a believably silver tongue and would look just as comfortable striding the halls of MI6 as he would in some far-flung Mediterranean locale. Barbara Broccoli may not want to opt for the easy Bond choice but, if she does, Tom Hiddleston is right there. The only issue may be balancing Bond with future Marvel work. Hiddleston's schedule may be lighter after where his character ended up in Loki season 2, however.\n\nJames Norton\n\nIf you believe the bookmakers, James Norton is never too far away from being the next Bond.\n\nHis McMafia character, Alex, may be the polar opposite to Bond in a lot of respects, but they share the same fabric. Each commands a room and each presents a growling façade that can be peeled away at any moment to show off a more brutal, narcissistic side.\n\nAs the above entries have made clear, a lot of boxes need to be ticked for Bond – not least a not-too-lofty celebrity presence and not too many years on the birth certificate. James Norton hasn’t been overexposed and has many decades as a sterling actor ahead – so now could be the perfect time for him to be the next James Bond.\n\nJonathan Bailey\n\nWhile not as prominent as some of the household names on his list, Jonathan Bailey – who most will know as Anthony in Bridgerton – has built up a considerable body of work (Broadchurch, Crashing) on both stage and screen. At 36, he’s also primed to lead Bond for the next decade or so, and feels like a Brosnan-esque mix of charm, good looks, and carrying the twin weapons of a wry smile and a killer instinct.\n\nHenry Golding\n\n\"It is the opportunity for change,\" Henry Golding told The Guardian back in September 2020 when asked about James Bond. \"Be it female, male, bi, gay, straight, trans, Asian, black, Latina.\"\n\nGolding could be part of that wave of change, becoming the first Asian actor to play Bond. He’s already built up a solid resume, starring in Snake Eyes, Crazy Rich Asians, The Gentlemen, and Last Christmas. Arguably, each showcases a different side to Bond, from action hero, all the way through to tender heart. However, Snake Eyes proved a box-office bomb, which may work against Golding.\n\nJamie Bell\n\nFrom Billy Elliot to James Bond? It’s not too much of a stretch to suggest Jamie Bell could take on the role – especially as his path follows Daniel Craig’s own career trajectory of knocking it out of the park in smaller budget films before making the leap to MI6.\n\nThose who only know him from the ill-fated 2015 Fantastic Four reboot should seek out Snowpiercer, Rocketman, and his BAFTA-nominated role in Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool for a taste of his talents. Bell’s yet to have that blockbuster leading role – perhaps Bond could finally be it.\n\nJohn Boyega\n\nBoyega’s already thrown his hat into the ring to be the next Bond. \"We could show them something different,\" he told MTV when asked about starring as Bond in a movie with Small Axe collaborator Steve McQueen. \"We still bring this sophistication. You know, James Bond has to be James Bond. But we could do something with that.\"\n\nBoyega would certainly be a popular and comfortable choice given his days anchoring the Star Wars sequel trilogy as ex-Stormtrooper Finn. Plus, the actor has shown to be capable of starring in other big blockbusters, having been at the center of Pacific Rim Uprising and Kathryn Bigelow’s Detroit. Working against Boyega would be his name recognition.\n\nWill Poulter\n\nWill Poulter has long been a favorite for James Bond, but his dance card might already be full with his role as Adam Warlock in the MCU – which could potentially evolve into a long-term position.\n\nWhile Poulter hasn’t addressed any talk of him playing 007 next, he has plenty of ideas of where the Bond franchise should go. \"The more psychologically complex and granular they get with Bond the better, because I think it's a mistake to ever treat Bond as a caricature,\" Poulter told GQ at an event celebrating Bond’s 60th anniversary.\n\nDan Stevens\n\nWith a one billion-dollar movie already under his belt in Beauty and the Beast, Dan Stevens already has the Goldfinger-like Midas touch – though the actor was, of course, cloaked in CGI as the titular Beast.\n\nWithout the effects, can Stevens be a truly intimidating physical threat like Bond? Well, look at the actor’s work in Legion, the X-Men spin-off series, and you can see the potential for an introspective, yet frenetic 00-agent to shoot down the barrel. Or, better yet, a glance at Netflix’s Eurovision movie showcases the actor’s sheer amount of range. There’s no doubting his abilities – perhaps Bond could be the role he was born to play. He might have to beat off a few actors to get the gig, though.\n\nDaniel Kaluuya\n\nJames Bond movies don’t always bring in multi-faceted actors to play 007. Roger Moore could be one-note, while Timothy Dalton always played his Bond harder than most. Make no mistake: Daniel Kaluuya wouldn’t be quite so one-dimensional.\n\nOne of the finest actors of his generation, Kaluuya can juggle the demands of the role. It may not be the 35-year-old’s most notable work, but his role in Widows highlights the dangerous presence needed for Bond. Then there’s his Oscar-winning performance in Judas and the Black Messiah that proves Kaluuya can be the most dominant presence in any room. Again, arguably an already known name – and that’s not quite Bond’s style. But Kaluuya has the ability to take the role in any direction.\n\nAlthough, a drawback is that Kaluuya has said he'd be more interested in playing a Bond villain than 007 himself... but never say never.\n\nClive Standen\n\nNot yet a household name – a good thing for a prospective Bond – Clive Standen has starred in Vikings, Camelot, and BBC series Robin Hood, each role allowing him to showcase all manner of style and suaveness across the ages, capturing the timeless quality that Bond requires. Perhaps his most obvious Bond-like role is playing the lead character in the Taken TV series, based on the Liam Neeson-starring Taken movies.\n\nCuriously, Standen’s one of the few consistent frontrunners with bookmakers. Do they know something we don’t?\n\nTom Hopper\n\nThe Umbrella Academy's Tom Hopper once launched to the front of the next James Bond conversation after a sudden surge in the betting market. The actor certainly has action chops and the look, but would he be interested?\n\nHe told We Got This Covered, \"Any British actor will be lying if they say that James Bond wasn’t up there as a dream role. So, you know, it’s very nice to be in that conversation.\" Mark this one down as an outside possibility.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor has long been linked as the next James Bond, and has quietly built up an extensive body of work that would rank among any other actor on this list. His Academy Award nomination for 12 Years a Slave and his work in blockbusters, including The Lion King and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, show off an actor who gives his all, no matter the film. The best Bonds can wear many hats; Ejiofor, in that sense, is more than capable of straddling the line between nuanced character work and explosive physical performances.\n\nThe search may be ongoing, but the above names could all be the ones to take the James Bond franchise into the future."
