        "text": "A hunk of old Brie, left all day in the glove compartment in a car on a hot summer's day, could not smell more ripe than this absurd sword'n'sandal Roman movie produced by Hollywood veteran Dino De Laurentiis. It's about Rome's last emperor, young Romulus Augustus, played by the 12-year-old Thomas Sangster, under threat from beastly Goths, who are for some reason all played by Scottish actors. He is protected by his noble commander Aurelius (Colin Firth) and his twinkly-eyed mentor Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley). Aishwarya Rai plays a beautiful martial arts warrior. It's all very silly but not without entertainment value, especially when they fetch up in sun-drenched Capri, home of the former emperor Tiberius, described reverently as a \"great\" ruler. (Ooo-er. That's not how we remember him from I, Claudius on the telly.)"
