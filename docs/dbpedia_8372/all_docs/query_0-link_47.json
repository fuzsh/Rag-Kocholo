        "text": "(B, Pa, VV, S, N, M) The dominant worldview is a biblical clash of good vs evil, but there are some pagan elements primarily in the attitude of the villains; no obscenities or profanities, though the word “Hell” is used but not as a profanity; considerable battle violence but it is not gory in its presentation, including twice people impaled by some object are shown with the item protruding but with little or no blood evident; a sexual relationship is implied between a couple that later gets married, but no sexual activity is shown; lead female character is dressed in revealing clothing twice (once while wet); no alcohol; no smoking; and, one scene shows an act of revenge while another shows a man wanting revenge but deciding against pursuing it and one character uses magic but it is shown not to be supernatural.\n\nLong time Italian producer Dino Del Lorentis and his family have produced a 1950s style sword swinging adventure with a Bollywood twist. The movie opens with the evil Goths capturing Rome just as 12-year-old Romulus Augustus (Thomas Sangster) is named Caesar. He is forced to flee with the help of his teacher Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley), the faithful Legion commander Aurelius (Colin Firth), and the mysterious female super soldier Mira (Aishwarya Rai, from Bollywood).\n\nRome has crumbled, the Goths are in control and young Romulus will be hunted down if they can’t get to Brittany (England) where they believe the last Roman legion exists. After several stirring adventures where Mira proves herself to be a worthy soldier and an attractive love interest for Commander Aurelius, they make it to Britannia where they learn Rome has abandoned the legion and the legion has largely disbanded to take up farming. Britannia is ruled by the sinister Vortgyn (Harry Van Gorkum), who has a grudge against Ambrosinus.\n\nThe movie contains no bad language and the battle violence is largely Errol Flynn style, instead of BRAVEHEART style. Ms. Rai on two occasions is shown in revealing outfits (once wet) and she does lie down beside Commander Aurelius the evening before the big battle, but no sexual activity is shown.\n\nMOVIEGUIDE® advises caution largely because of the fight scenes. The Ambrosinus character is shown on several occasions to be a magician, but it is made clear he is not a sorcerer. His tricks are not supernatural. There is an element of revenge, but it is not a dominant theme. The primary theme is good vs evil.\n\nOne lesson from THE LAST LEGION is that in movies writers determine who is good and who is evil. In many movies the Romans are made to look sinister – as if they enjoy stringing people up on crosses. In this movie, they look like champions of truth and freedom compared to the Goths who, mask and all, are presented as the evil empire of the age."
