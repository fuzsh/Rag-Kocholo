        "text": "It all started when….\n\nLaura Ingalls Wilder and her family moved to the De Smet area in 1879 at the beginning of the book By the Shores of Silver Lake. Charles worked for the railroad and the family lived in the Surveyors House through that winter before moving out to the quarter-section of land Pa chose as his homestead in the spring of 1880. Like many other settlers arriving in the 1880s, free land lured the Ingalls family to Dakota Territory.\n\nSchool, church, and a part-time job were important to Charles Ingalls and his family. Ingalls Homestead met their wishes for it is only a mile from De Smet. This land was perfect in many ways. It had good water and he could easily dig a well. He filed on this homestead at the land office in Brookings in February of 1880. He built a small shanty on the homestead and the family moved to the land that spring. The family lived and worked on the homestead except for the winter months of 1880-1881 and 1880-1882 when they moved into town in the room above Pa's store.\n\nAlmanzo Wilder and Laura Ingalls married on August 25, 1885. Laura had lived on the homestead for over four years. The rest of the family lived on the homestead for another three years, until they moved into the house that Pa built in town. In 1886 Charles filed final papers and put the declaration in the De Smet News. This 157.25 acre homestead cost Charles and Caroline $16.00 in filing fees.\n\nHow can I learn more about Laura Ingalls Wilder and the Ingalls Homestead?\n\nThere are many wonderful resources to learn about Laura and her family.\n\nThe US National Archives has Charles Ingalls's Homestead Papers digitized and available for online viewing. Page 10 is especially interesting because it details the improvements Charles made to the homestead land, which was a requirement of homesteading.\n\nMany of Laura's papers are held at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library in West Branch, Iowa. They have created the Laura Ingalls Wilder Index, which has resources and activities for children and adults.\n\nBeyond Little House is the home of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Research and Legacy Association. The LIW Research and Legacy Association hosts a biannual research conference at various Laura-related sites throughout the US. This group also holds read-alongs throughout the year and is a great resource for Laura news.\n\nAnd of course, there are books- many, many books about Laura. While the Little House books are partially autobiographical, they are considered historical novels because she changed details of her life to craft the books into the lovely stories they are. There are wonderful books for both children and adults that explore the history of Laura Ingalls Wilder and her family. Some of our favorites are listed below.
