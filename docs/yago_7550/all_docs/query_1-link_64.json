        "text": "As a child, Little House on the Prairie was one of my favorite shows. I fell in love with Laura and her life as a young girl myself. I’m fairly sure this girl was born in the wrong generation. Their simple living just fascinated me, it still does!\n\nI admit, anytime there is a rerun on I can’t pass it up. Watching them as an adult with children of my own gave me a new perspective than I had before. I’ve realized just how many great life lessons there are in their shows, lessons today’s shows just don’t hold a candle to.\n\nForgiveness\n\nCaroline Ingalls: When you love somebody, it’s worth putting your pride behind you.\n\nIf anyone was good at forgiving, it was Caroline and Charles. If they had a tiff, you could count on it being resolved quickly. They would quickly put their pride aside, forgive each other and move on.\n\nGod wants our love to be sweet, soft-hearted and lovely. And He wants it overflowing with forgiveness. By offering forgiveness, we are offering the grace that God has given us. Don’t cling to prior offenses, tucking them in your pocket to use later. Simply wipe the slate clean as soon as the offense happens. This will not only set your husband free, but you as well. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. {Colossians 3:13}\n\nHumility\n\nCharles: I still have my lady, and I want you to know that you mean more to me than anything in this world.\n\nCaroline: Oh, Charles!\n\nThey both practiced humility. When Charles would make a remark about her beauty, she humbly replied, “Oh, Charles,” and tossed her head to the side in such a beautiful fashion. Later in the episode the family remarks about how much she deserves a new dress because she never gets anything new. So humbled by their kindness, she breaks out in tears.\n\nI’m slowly realizing that humility is one of the most important ingredients in marriage. To have humility and submission, our desire to come first must be put aside. We have to put it aside for the good of another. With humility, you’ll be sensitive towards others without complaining. When we come together honestly and humbly, it gives us space to forgive each other when necessary. And you’ll feel such thankfulness and gratitude at the jobs God assigns you.\n\n(Visited 178 times, 1 visits today)"
