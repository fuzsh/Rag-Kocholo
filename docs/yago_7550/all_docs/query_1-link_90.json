        "text": "Description\n\nIn the frigid days of February, 1870, Caroline Ingalls and her family leave the familiar comforts of the Big Woods of Wisconsin for a new life in Kansas's Indian Territory. Packing what they can carry in their wagon, Caroline, her husband, Charles, and their little girls, Mary and Laura, head west to settle in a beautiful, unpredictable land full of promise and peril. This is the story of a pregnant woman whose life is filled with perils and tender joys. In adapting to this strange new place, Caroline must draw on untapped wells of strength she did not know she possesses. Authorized by Little House Heritage Trust."
