        "text": "Here I will describe the happenings of Laura's friends and family after the events in the books.\n\nLaura's Family\n\nPa (Charles Ingalls) lived the rest of his life in peace and died in De Smet in 1902. Ma (Caroline Ingalls) died in 1924.\n\nMa and Pa\n\nAfter 1889, when she finished School for the Blind, Mary lived with Grace and her husband until she died at Carrie's house in 1928. She never married.\n\nA Picture of Mary\n\nCaroline Celestia Ingalls, better known as Carrie, became a typesetter for the De Smet News, and later other bigger newspapers throughout the state. She spent her youth traveling the country, visiting family in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and going to Laura's home in Mansfield, Missouri.\n\nCarrie\n\nGrace became a teacher like her sisters did, and was one until she married in 1901. I couldn't find a picture of her at an older age, but here is a picture of baby grace.\n\nLaura's paternal grandmother died in 1883, and her grandfather died in 1896.\n\nLaura's maternal grandfather died in 1884, and her grandmother re-married, and died in 1886.\n\n\"Uncle Tom\" died in 1903. Aunt Docia (pictured below) died in 1913.\n\nAlmanzo's Family\n\nRoyal, Almanzo's older brother, left De Smet in 1890 and returned to Spring Valley and his family home. He opened up a variety store on Broadway. It was he that nursed Laura and Almanzo back to health when they fell ill.\n\nThere, he met and married Electa Hutchinson, who already had 4 children. He and Electa had 3 children of their own. One baby died at birth, and baby Susie died when she was only 5 months old. The third, Bernice Angeline, lived to attend school in Spring Valley, marry, and move away.\n\nAt the age of 42 in 1892, Eliza Jane married Thomas Jefferson Thayer, a twice-married Spring Valley merchant with 6 children. In June of 1894, Walcott Thayer was born, named after Thomas, his father, and was nicknamed Wilder. In 1899, Thomas died, and his estate was left to Etta, his daughter from a previous marriage.\n\nEliza Jane\n\nAlmanzo's father died in 1899, and his mother died in 1905.\n\nÂ¡@\n\nFriends\n\nGap Garland, the teenager who was with Almanzo when he went and saved everyone during \"The Long Winter,\" died in a threshing machine accident a little while after Laura and Almanzo married.\n\nMr. Edwards, the man who brought the Ingalls girls Christmas presents, was actually a made-up character, created in the books by Laura to reflect on the many people who did the Ingalls kind deeds.\n\nMary Powers, one of Laura's best friends from school, apparently lost touch with Laura. The letter that Laura wrote to readers that says that Mary Powers died at an early age proved wrong. She moved to the state Washington with her husband, and this is probably why they lost touch."
