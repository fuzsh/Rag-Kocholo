        "text": "Caroline (black and white tuxie girl) came to us on January 17, 2019 and Charles (brown tabby and white boy) on January 18, 2019. They’d been turned in to a high-kill shelter in Athens, Alabama by their owner (who was relocating due to a recent job loss). They hadn’t been spayed and neutered, and so Caroline is pregnant.\n\nCaroline is 8 months old. Charles is 18 months old. We have never had a pregnant cat who was this young, and we’ve also never had a father cat present, so this is sure to be interesting. (The day we got her, Caroline weighed in at 6 pounds. Charles weighed in at 10 pounds, 12 ounces. So yeah, there’s quite a size difference!)\n\nCharles was neutered the day he came to us.\n\nThey’re named Charles and Caroline after Ma and Pa Ingalls – their kittens will be given names from the Little House on the Prairie show/books.\n\nBoth cats are super friendly love bugs who are strongly bonded to each other and will only be adopted as a pair. They love to play with each other, cuddle together, and just generally be in each other’s company most of the time.\n\nAfter making us wait for nearly 4 weeks, Caroline had her kittens on the morning of February 13, 2019. She gave birth to 5 very healthy kittens in the course of about two hours. They’re all brown tabbies, 2 girls and 3 boys: Mary, Laura, Almanzo, Albert and Willie.\n\nYou can read about Caroline beginning here, and Charles beginning here. Posts about the kittens start with Caroline’s birth story, here. There are links at the top and bottom of each entry; click on the one on the right to take you to the next entry.\n\nYou can see all the pictures taken of the family here at Flickr, or scroll through them below.\n\nAdoptions.\n\nLaura and Mary were adopted (together!) on May 31, 2019!\n\nAlbert and Willie were adopted (together!) on June 1, 2019! and now live in the Nashville, Tennessee area. You can follow them on Instagram, here.\n\nAlmanzo was adopted on June 6, 2019! He’s now Cooper, and you can follow him on Facebook or on Instagram!\n\nCharles and Caroline were adopted – together! – on June 8, 2019, and now live in Michigan! You can follow them on Facebook here, or on Instagram, here!"
