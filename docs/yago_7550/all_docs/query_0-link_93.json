        "text": "What Do You Mean By Real?\n\nNow that begs the question what are you talking about as THE real fiddle? There are a couple of fiddles that might be considered the real fiddle. The two most important are the fiddle that Michael Landon “played” on the Little House TV show and the real fiddle played by the real Charles Ingalls.\n\nWill the Real Charles Ingalls Please Play the Fiddle?\n\nThe real fiddle that the real Charles Ingalls played is in the museum in Mansfield, Missouri. According to the story “Grandpa’s Fiddle,” Pa told Laura she was to have it after he passed when they left De Smet, South Dakota for Mansfield, Missouri. As the sisters were trying to deal with the stuff Ma and Mary had left behind when they passed they decided to donate Pa’s fiddle to the South Dakota Historical Society with the condition it be displayed prominently and played at least four times a year every year – it wasn’t. (See Note) When the Laura Ingalls Wilder and Rose Wilder Lane Home and Museum was established in Mansfield after everyone in the immediate Ingalls family passed Rose asked to borrow the fiddle for the Mansfield museum Rose was then supporting. SDHS didn’t value it so they let her have it and that was that.\n\nToday it’s on display in the relatively new museum on Rocky Ridge Farm in Mansfield, Missouri. You can see the fiddle any day you visit in a case. During Wilder Days is the one set day for the fiddle to be played. You may come across them playing it.\n\nAs Seen on TV!\n\nThe real fiddle that Michael Landon pretended to play on the TV show is in the museum in Walnut Grove, Minnesota. Melissa Gilbert did have it and you might still find video of interviews or news stories where she talks about having them, especially the red dress that she had framed on her wall. When Gilbert moved to New York she and her current husband actor Timothy Busfield held an action. They said they needed the money and they not only sold things that were mementos from both of their careers, but also anything not nailed down in their Michigan home they weren’t taking to New York.\n\nGilbert sold 3 things she had from Little House on the Prairie:\n\nPa’s fiddle\n\nHer little red dress costume\n\nA costume of Mr. Edwards.\n\nThe Laura Ingalls Wilder Museum in Walnut Grove was able to buy the fiddle (which is good that’s where it belongs) and Mr. Edward’s costume and they’re now on display. They also got a giant signed photo of the cast and they now sell copies of that in the museum gift shop.\n\nMichael Landon couldn’t actually play the fiddle. The music was added afterward as a sound effect. It’s just an ordinary run of the mill fiddle. Most musicians say it’s painfully obvious that Landon isn’t playing that he doesn’t even fake it very well, but he convinced a lot of people. Seeing the TV real fiddle means a lot to people.\n\nThe last thing in the auction was the little red dress that was Gilbert’s costume on the show. The bid went way high at the auction and the museum couldn’t afford it. A fan bought the red dress and is known as Scary Closet on Instagram. It is now in their private collection. They’ve posted photos that they’d brought it to one signing event. They were hoping to get to Simi Valley. They didn’t make it, but I imagine you’ll see them at some future events.\n\nIs It THE Fiddle?\n\nOne of the biggest Little House on the Prairie events of the 50th Anniversary year in 2024 was at Simi Valley, California where they actually did the major exterior filming for the show. Another part of the event were recreations of the sets as sets. In the Little House set they had A fiddle. There were a lot of questions asked in Little House on the Prairie groups after the Simi Valley reunion event in 2024. One that came up several times was “was that really THE fiddle on the Little House set rebuild?” No, it wasn’t.\n\nSarah S.

This started, but they never come back and tell how it ended. So today I’m telling you the rest of the story. Learn a little bit more about the Ingalls plot in my post about them removing the stone for repair.\n\nDe Smet Cemetery\n\nI should start by saying I didn’t make it out to De Smet last year. I thought I would…but something came up and I had to drive directly back home from Walnut Grove. So I didn’t get these photos, but I asked my friend Jenny Ward and she was nice enough to get me these and give permission for me to use them in this post.\n\nAssembling a Tombstone\n\nI’ve lived with cemeteries my whole life so I know how they go. Although stones look quite imposing what holds them together is only gravity – they stay together because they are heavy. Usually there is no glue or any kind of adhesive involved so the wooden wedges you can see in the photo above are helping to level and nudge the stone to just the right spot.\n\nTombstones are VERY heavy. One of this style got knocked over when a tree fell over in our local township cemetery and we had to have a tombstone company come out and bring in special hoist equipment to get it back up. Between the pieces of stone they put in pennies to give it a little breathing room.\n\nPa’s stone was removed during October 2021 for repair and returned to the cemetery in May 2022. Read about the restoration in the Kingsbury Journal.\n\nThe Story of Pa’s Stone\n\nSo Pa’s stone was the only stone for the family originally and was put in place shortly after his death. This type of stone was considered a family stone; that is one family member’s information is carved on each side of the stone. For unknown reasons – probably because of the cost – neither Mary nor Ma’s name and information were added to the stone. When Carrie had died she’d instructed money be spent to get stones for Mary and Ma, but it never happened. Carrie’s estate did buy tombstones for Carrie, her husband, and her stepson. These stones were matching even though Carrie’s was the only one of them for De Smet.\n\nIn 1950 Evelyn Wenzel visited De Smet as part of her work on her thesis. She reported: “Mrs. Keating was of the opinion that the Ingalls family had been buried there, but a search revealed a marked grave only for Carrie who died in 1946.” She included a photograph showing Carrie’s original stone. Pa’s stone was right there and they were actively searching for the rest of the family and they couldn’t read the stone at that point.\n\nIn 1959 Rose Wilder Lane paid to get the stone recarved. One of the first projects of the De Smet Memorial Society was to get stones for those Ingalls family members that didn’t have them. They replaced Carrie’s so they all matched except Pa’s and Pa’s stone was recarved at that time. A verse was carved in under the information (not sure if it was original or added at that point), but the verse was not recarved in 2022.\n\nPa’s stone was originally placed as a headstone and when they were added the new stones were put in as footstones. Sometime in the late 1970s Pa’s stone was moved into the position with the rest of the footstones. The difference is that headstones are put by the body’s head and footstones are put in by the body’s feet. Most cemeteries have one or the other as the rule so all the stones line up. It’s odd to have one family’s stones not follow the cemetery pattern, but maybe it was so no one would walk on the family’s graves. (See Note 1)\n\nMade of Marble\n\nI wasn’t sure what kind of stone Pa’s tombstone was. From a distance it looks like marble, but up close the surface texture is closer to sandstone. I hadn’t wondered about the type of stone when I was there, but since I was talking about the recarving I thought I should find out. Not being there to look I decided to ask our local tombstone place. I called them up and from the description of the texture, when it was put up, and how often it had to be re-carved they thought it was probably sandstone. But I thought it looks like marble, another popular 19th century tombstone material. But isn’t marble a stronger stone than that? I did a little research on that and it turns out not so much. Marble is also relatively soft & quick to wear when used for tombstones. When I sent them a photo of Pa’s stone they said it had to be marble. Rausch Brothers Monument Company, Inc. from Ortonville, Minnesota, recarved the marker and remounted it at the De Smet Cemetery. They confirmed in the Kingsbury Journal that it was marble.\n\nAlthough it was very popular in the 19th century for tombstones, sandstone makes a terrible tombstone. It has a tendency to break down making them hard to read and dangerous to clean. You always think of marble being a stronger material, but apparently tombstone people rate it almost as soft, just not as soft as sandstone. Marble’s relative softness explains why Pa’s stone has needed to be recarved at least twice.\n\nStone Rubbing\n\nPa’s tombstone is a frequent target of tombstone rubbing. At its least destructive people hold paper on a tombstone and run crayon or pencil on it to make an impression of what was carved in the tombstone. However, rubbing tombstones have been shown to be a danger to stones. In some states it’s actually illegal to make a tombstone rubbing because of the damage tombstone rubbing can cause.\n\nPa’s stone is particularly vulnerable to rubbing. It isn’t just one family member making a single copy of a stone in the middle of nowhere. Pa’s stone is rubbed repeatedly, for a big chunk of the year it’s probably rubbed multiple times daily. I’ve seen multiple people do it myself in the few times I’ve been there. The design of Pa’s stone also makes it particularly susceptible to being knocked over because of its high center of gravity. Since you know it’s not the original carving now and that the stone is vulnerable to people rubbing on it, I hope you won’t increase the risk. (See note 2)\n\nTo There And Back Again\n\nSo Pa’s stone is safely back in place again. It will look a little different this summer because they expanded the cemetery. I can’t wait to visit the De Smet Cemetery again.\n\nKingsbury Journal\n\nYou have to subscribe and be logged in to read these articles.\n\n“Pa’s Grave Marker Gone.” Kingsbury Journal. October 20, 2021.\n\nhttps://www.kingsburyjournal.com/stories/pas-grave-marker-gone,4841?\n\n“Pa’s Grave Marker Returns Home.” Kingsbury Journal. May 18, 2022. https://www.kingsburyjournal.com/stories/pas-grave-marker-back-home,6246?\n\nNOTE 1: The Mansfield, Missouri cemetery where Laura is buried is a footstone cemetery so Laura, Manly, and Rose’s graves are all behind their stones. The plate type stone by Laura’s tombstone is actually a headstone for the grave you are standing on when you look at the front of the graves. Subnote: Yes, there was at least 40 years between when Laura was buried there and when the people behind her were buried so WHY the cemetery didn’t just swap the other people out another lot so Laura fans would have a respectful place to stand (with a cement sidewalk like De Smet’s) and all the future photos of Laura’s stone wouldn’t have the other headstone ruining the shot I do NOT know.\n\nNOTE 2: Although it’s still not a great thing, rubbing the type of stone used for Ma, Mary, Carrie, and Baby Boy Wilder’s stones have much less chance of actually causing damage by rubbing than Pa’s type of stone. I haven’t seen anybody do a rubbing on one of theirs. I only have seen people doing Pa’s so…what’s up with that?\n\nSarah S.

January 10th is the birthday of both Mary Ingalls and her father Charles Ingalls. The APH Museum is the historic arm of American Printing House for the Blind which creates and sells equipment to help those dealing with blindness. Both the business and the museum are located in Louisville, Kentucky. The APH Museum has hosted a party on Mary’s birthday for the past several years, skipping last year in order to host a Louis Braille birthday party instead. This year the party is back and bigger than ever.\n\nTheir announcement:\n\nA BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR MARY INGALLS\n\nNational Braille Literacy Month\n\nSaturday, January 10, 2015, 10:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m.\n\n“My sister Mary is the reason I am a writer,” said Laura Ingalls Wilder, author of the Little House books. Mary lost her sight at age fourteen, and Laura became her sister’s eyes, describing the world so her sister could “see” as well. Find out about her richly rewarding life and the challenges she faced as a blind woman a hundred years ago. Sing along with some of Pa’s fiddle tunes, weave a beaded bracelet (the same as those Mary made for her sisters), and enjoy birthday cake made from Ma’s recipe. Free to the public but space is limited so registration is required. Call 899-2213 by January 9 to register. For adults and children age 5 and up.\n\nIf you have any questions, contact the museum at:\n\nThe American Printing House for the Blind, Inc.\n\n1839 Frankfort Avenue\n\nP.O.

Laura referred to it as Braille in her writing, but by that time Braille had completely OBLITERATED New York Point (think Blu-Ray and DVD-HD) and rather than explain the difference it’s fairly likely that she used Braille in her writing as a more general term in the way, for example, you might call a facial tissue a Kleenex when it’s in fact a totally different brand.\n\nLearn more about Mary’s time at the Blind School and scroll down to find the bit about the War of the Dots in this post:https://trundlebedtales.wordpress.com/2013/12/13/vinton-and-the-mary-ingalls-society\n\nSarah S.

It’s ironic that I got to play Mary more when we played Laura at recess at school because it was hard to get anybody else to take the role and she really is necessary for play acting out a lot of the stories, but I didn’t enjoy it. However, I think I’ve developed a bit more appreciation for the Mary beyond the books, what she overcame, and how she contributed to her family and her community. Early on the series was known as the Laura and Mary books and Mary got equal billing. I think we need to bring a bit more of that back. To remember it wasn’t only Laura born in Pepin, WI, but Mary too. To point out the Mary dolls, drawings, etc.\n\nTwo things recently brought this home to me:\n\n1. I started doing the Facebook page for the Mary Ingalls Society and wanting to link to things I just assumed I’d be able to find once I took the trouble to look (for instance something on the Pepin museum website that said Mary was also born there) weren’t there.\n\n2. I started looking for photos that I could take to use to wish Mary Happy Birthday since I have three e-cards to create now and it got me thinking about images of Mary which lead me on to another thought. There are Laura, Nellie, and Almanzo contests, but is there a Mary one anywhere?\n\nIt just suddenly struck me as unfair, so this year as one of my resolutions I hope to focus on Mary a little bit more and I hope that you loyal readers will help me out. If you see Mary somewhere, if you have a Mary doll, or a drawing or anything like that, please share and let’s help put the Mary back in the Laura and Mary fandom.\n\nSarah S.

As I always tell people the main reason Mansfield has the lion’s share of the Ingalls-Wilder artifacts is that Laura outlived everybody in her family and they lived in Mansfield so long that they tended to collect stuff. That’s true, but some stuff was actively collected or gifted to the museum. One such gift came from Mary Swanzey Harris, Carrie’s step-daughter. She had come to the museum one day in 1959 with her son-in-law Wayne Upshaw and her daughter Sue Upshaw. Mary thought about her visit and on a subsequent visit she donated a box of Carrie’s family possessions. This collection included the Ingalls Family Bible (which Laura did not have to refer to while writing the books), Carrie’s autograph book, the flowered fairy box described in On the Banks of Plum Creek, the now familiar tintype of the 3 sisters, Mary Ingalls’s clothing, handiwork, and personal belongings, including her Braille slate, Mary’s college diploma and probably Charles and Caroline’s wedding certificate. Read more about it in the Winter 2009-2010 of Rocky Ridge Review.\n\nUPDATE: This is another of my top 10 posts for all time views and shows up regularly in the posts people have hit by searching. I’m not exactly sure why it comes up, maybe people are just looking for a list of some of the things on display at the Laura Ingalls Wilder Home and Museum in Mansfield, Missouri. Maybe people want to know more about their newsletter, The Rocky Ridge Review. Maybe they are tracking the Harris or Upshaw family, I don’t know, but I want to more briefly address what the two comments are about, the current status of Mary Swanzey Harris. Laura’s genealogy hasn’t been a special focus of mine, although some people are doing great work in that area. This donation came in the late 1950s right after the museum opened. I’m sure Mary Swanzey Harris has passed on by now, even though I don’t have a death date. I did a little further searching and it looks like the son-in-law mentioned in the story, Wayne Upshaw, passed away in September 2004. A stripped version of his obituary is available here and it looks like his wife, Sue Harris Upshaw was still alive at that time. Her obituary has not appeared in the newspaper that carried his since then, but that’s all I can say.\n\nhttp://genforum.genealogy.com/upshaw/messages/314.html\n\nSarah S.
