        "text": "The Woman Behind the Legend\n\nBy JOHN E. MILLER\n\nUniversity of Missouri Press\n\nRead the Review\n\nPioneer Girl\n\n1867-1879\n\nThe Civil War was only two years past when a baby girl was born in a cabin on the edge of the \"Big Woods\" in the Chippewa River valley region of Wisconsin, just a few miles from the Mississippi River. She was the second child of Charles P. and Caroline Quiner Ingalls, and they named her Laura Elizabeth after Charles's mother, Laura Louise Colby Ingalls. The young couple had moved to this remote agricultural region of western Wisconsin with Charles's parents and the rest of his family five years earlier.\n\nLaura Ingalls was born on Thursday, February 7, 1867. The big news story of the day was the release in the nation's capital of the report of a special committee of the House of Representatives exonerating U.S. Asst. Treas. H. H. Van Dyck, who had been accused of interfering with the gold market. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate was debating a 20 percent pay increase for Treasury Department clerks. This was the day that navigation on the Ohio River fully resumed for the season. In St. Louis former slave Frederick Douglass lectured at Fireman's Hall. Douglass County, Kansas, voters approved the issuance of three hundred thousand dollars in bonds for purchasing capital stock in the Leavenworth, Lawrence, and Galveston Railroad. Across the ocean the Pope was considering a proposal to canonize Columbus. A new Atlantic Telegraph Company was forming, intending to lay an underwater cable from the Azores to Halifax.\n\nSuch goings-on had little relevance to people so far removed from them. The Ingalls's major concern was to carve out of the wilderness a sustenance for themselves, remote from the cities and industries that were rapidly transforming the United States from a rural, agrarian society into an urban, industrial one. As the forward edge of settlement relentlessly crept forward, wilderness areas were soon transformed into populated, settled territory. By the end of the Civil War railroad tracks already connected the East Coast with the Mississippi River, and during the next several years they quickly linked the continent from coast to coast.\n\nSteamboats regularly plied the Mississippi River. Boats frequently came to shore to tie up at Pepin Landing, seven miles from the Ingalls cabin, where they took on passengers and unloaded merchandise ordered by local storekeepers. Even before the Civil War, early settlers who had entered the region were shipping out several thousand bushels of wheat every year from Pepin on steamboats bound for St. Louis and elsewhere. Potatoes and other commodities were sent in lesser quantities to points south. By the 1860s, more and more farmers drifted into the area, seeking choice locations on which to make a living from the land. In an early 1862 edition of the Pepin County Press, newspaper editor U. B. Shaver noted poetically--and perhaps with some degree of exaggeration--how quickly civilization was taking hold in the region. As the Indians continually were being pushed farther to the west, frontiersmen arriving from the east took their places. \"Broad fields lay extended in sunlight where but a short time before wild beasts formed their coverts and hunted their prey,\" the editor enthusiastically announced.\n\nAcre after acre waved with bending wheat and rye, and gleamed with the yellow sheen of ripening corn. Cabins dotted the hill sides, and mill wheels flashed in the running streams; and ponderous rafts of pine lumber floated down our great inland sea and found a market hundreds of miles distant. Our village of Pepin at length set up its busy hum, and the air was alive with the sounds and voices of intelligent and independent industry.\n\nIf the editor waxed somewhat overenthusiastic in describing the progress of the region, Laura Ingalls would be guilty seventy years later of exaggerating the primitiveness of the place where she had been born. The first lines of Little House in the Big Woods describe her family's cabin as virtually isolated, far from people and civilization. \"As far as a man could go to the north in a day, or a week, or a whole month, there was nothing but woods,\" she wrote, describing a place that had no houses, no roads, no people--just forest and the wild animals inhabiting it. Wolves and bears and other animals certainly did pose serious dangers to the settlers. As agriculturalists carved out clearings in the woods and appropriated meadows used earlier by Indians for their fields, one could listen to the busy axes of nearby lumbermen, who floated their logs down the Chippewa River into Beef Slough at its mouth, where it connected with the Mississippi on the eastern edge of the county.\n\nThe lumber industry of northern Wisconsin had begun to expand rapidly during the 1840s. The Chippewa River valley, containing about one-sixth of all the pine timber west of the Appalachians, emerged as the largest and most important lumber district in the state. It was called \"a logger's paradise.\" The depression of 1857 dealt the region a major setback, ruining many lumbermen, but the Civil War restored prosperity to the industry, and during the 1860s the number of board feet logged annually in the region ballooned from 60 million to 436 million. For several decades the region would supply logs for dozens of sawmills along the Mississippi River, which then shipped the sawed lumber by rail all over the Midwest and the northern plains.\n\nThe Wisconsin frontier may have seemed remote to most Americans, but it lay in a region rapidly filling up with farmers, lumbermen, merchants, lawyers, and other go-getters. Wherever the frontier proceeded during the late nineteenth century, civilization did not lag far behind. People who moved to the edge of settlement hoped both to take advantage of the economic opportunities available in a fluid, expanding environment and to quickly establish the kinds of social relations and institutions that they had been familiar with and enjoyed farther east.\n\nSuch visions of economic development and social refinement influenced Lansford and Laura Ingalls and their family to move west to Pepin County around 1862. Their second son, Charles, and his wife of two years, the former Caroline Quiner, joined a family migration that included the entire Ingalls clan. Such extended family migration to frontier regions was not uncommon after the Civil War.\n\nThe Ingallses and the Quiners joined the many who migrated west from New England during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, through New York and northern Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, into and beyond Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and the Dakotas. The migrants carried with them habits, practices, values, and institutions tinged with the Puritan past. Heavily Protestant (and often Congregationalist), reformist in social orientation, Republican in politics, optimistic and hardworking, independent and self-reliant, while also cooperative and community minded, these former New Englanders impressed their values and their ways on social life wherever they went.\n\nThe Ingalls family traced its roots back to the earliest Puritan migration to Massachusetts. Edmund Ingalls, born at Skirbeck in Lincolnshire in east-central England, was about thirty when he arrived in Salem, Massachusetts, in Gov. John Endecott's company in 1628. With a brother and four others Edmund started a settlement at Lynn the following year. Tragically, he drowned in the Saugus River in March 1648 while riding horseback to Boston. Lansford Whiting Ingalls, born in Canada in 1812, was an eighth-generation Ingalls in America. His family returned to the United States when the War of 1812 broke out and his father, Samuel Ingalls, enlisted in the army. After the war the family settled in western New York. Lansford married Laura Louise Colby, who was born in 1810, and, like many of their cohorts, the couple raised a large family: six boys and four girls (not counting one who died at a young age). Charles Philip was born near Cuba, New York, in the southwestern part of the state, on January 10, 1836, the third child and the second to live to adulthood. From his father, according to Donald Zochert, the blue-eyed Charles derived high-spiritedness, and from his mother, a former schoolteacher who had married at the age of eighteen, he derived a sturdy sense of self-discipline.\n\nWith their family growing larger, Lansford and Laura Ingalls decided to take the five children they had at the time farther west to try their luck closer to his brothers. Charles was nine years old when they moved to the Illinois prairie about forty miles west of Chicago, which at that time was a growing boomtown of about 15,000 people. In 1853 the family moved again, this time to Jefferson County, Wisconsin, near the little village of Concord. The second county to the west of Milwaukee, which, like Chicago, was experiencing an initial growth surge, Jefferson County in 1840 had numbered just 914 free white persons, largely made up of farmers deriving from Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio; within a decade the population had burgeoned to 15,317. Another 15,000 were added during the 1850s, but during the Civil War growth slowed to only 3,500. Many Indians still inhabited the area mostly of the Winnebago tribe. During the Ingalls's stay there, the edge of the frontier moved farther west, and the country around them filled up and was settled.\n\nGrowing up on a nearby farm was a young girl just three years younger than Charles. Caroline Lake Quiner was the fifth of seven children (three boys and four girls, one of whom died at just four years of age) of Henry N. and Charlotte Tucker Quiner, who had married in 1831. Originating in Connecticut, the Quiners, like the Ingallses, joined the migration to the Midwest. The family lived for a time in Ohio and Indiana before moving to the Wisconsin frontier just west of Milwaukee near the village of Brookfield, where Caroline was born on December 12, 1839.\n\nTragedy struck in 1844 when Henry Quiner, who had engaged in trading with the Indians, drowned in a shipwreck on Lake Michigan during a violent storm. Life was hard for the fatherless family for the next several years. When Caroline was eight, her widowed mother purchased some government land bordering on the Oconomowoc River farther west in Jefferson County, two miles from Concord. The following year Charlotte married Frederick Holbrook, a Connecticut farmer, who bought some land adjoining that of his new wife, making for an enlarged farm. He became a good stepfather for the Quiner children.\n\nEducation was an important value for this frontier family. Charlotte Quiner had taught school before her first marriage, and when Caroline completed her own schooling at the age of sixteen, she began teaching in the same school that she had attended as a student. Meanwhile, with her family living close to the Ingalls farm, she and her siblings became acquainted with their children. Eventually, three sets of brothers and sisters from the two families would fall in love and get married. Henry Quiner and Polly Ingalls were the first to pair off, in 1859. A year later, on February 1, 1860, Caroline Quitter married Charles Ingalls in Concord. The following year Eliza Quiner married Peter Ingalls.\n\nMeanwhile, however, things were not going well for the Ingalls family patriarch. In 1857, the year Lansford Ingalls took out a mortgage on his land, the United States slid into a sharp economic depression, the effects of which reached all the way to the Wisconsin frontier. Unable to repay all of the money that he had borrowed when it came due three years later, Lansford lost title to his land. Instead of becoming discouraged, however, he made plans to move farther west and start over. In addition to him and his wife and their seven children still at home, their three married children decided to go with them and try their luck in the new environment. Back East, meanwhile, political events were spiraling out of control, with shots fired at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861, instigating the Civil War.\n\nAt a time when many young men his age were being called to military service, Charles Ingalls managed to avoid conscription. Whether he, Henry, and Peter believed that moving to the frontier might have the effect of sparing them from military duty is uncertain. Approximately eighty thousand Wisconsinites--about one-half of all white males in the state between the ages of eighteen and forty-five--twelve thousand of whom died, served during the war. In February 1865, during the last year of the war, Charles signed a petition to hold a special town meeting to appropriate two hundred dollars for every volunteer who stepped forward to fill the local quota. Two of his brothers as well as Caroline's brother Joseph did serve in Union blue. The latter, tragically, died from wounds suffered in the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, three months after he had enlisted. By January 3, 1865, when Hiram and James (who went by his middle name rather than his first name of Lansford) Ingalls crossed the Mississippi River and went to Lake City to enlist in the First Regiment of Heavy Artillery in the Minnesota Volunteers, the war was nearly over.\n\nLeaving Jefferson County around 1862, the Ingalls clan decided to take their chances in the Chippewa River lumbering region, at the forward edge of settlement at the time. Just as they had in Illinois and Wisconsin, they encountered other people with the same surname. One of them, Louisa Ingalls, had moved from Fort Madison, Iowa, a decade earlier to teach in the Pepin school. The village, although only several years old, had already experienced its share of ups and downs. Its location on the eastern bank of Lake Pepin, which was a widening of the Mississippi River, was strikingly beautiful, affording a panoramic view of tall bluffs on the Minnesota side. All around were stands of trees bordering on the Big Woods, with hardwood timber such as elm, oak, ash, maple, basswood, butternut, and birch. The area, while still rough and primitive, was rapidly transformed by the settlement process. The nearby Durand Times ran the following story in December 1865 about the killing of a big wolf: \"Mr. Nathan Brown, a `mighty hunter' in these parts, last week killed a monstrous grey wolf about a mile above Darwin's Mill. He is supposed to be among the very few, if not the last remaining number, of this race of animals that were abundant here but a few years ago. The grey wolf never stays long on the borders of civilization but seeks the more remote and secluded portions of the country.\"\n\nIndian mounds dotted the county. A band of Dakotas, led by Wabasha, had roamed the region just a few years earlier, clashing frequently with rival Chippewas. Although the Dakotas had relinquished their claim to the land in a treaty in 1837, war parties had continued to crisscross the valley into the 1850s. But after the Great Sioux Uprising of 1862 in Minnesota, which left hundreds of settlers dead and resulted in the hanging of thirty-eight of the alleged ringleaders, the remaining Indians in the area around Pepin all but disappeared. The earliest white settlement began in 1846, but not until 1855 was the town of Pepin (called North Pepin in the beginning) platted, followed the next year by the construction of several stores, a Methodist Episcopal church, and a scattering of houses. In 1857 a schoolhouse was erected, and the first newspaper, the Pepin County Independent, was started. Town boosters predicted that the nascent village would soon become a flourishing city and took to referring to it as the \"Queen City of Lake Pepin\" and the \"Gate City of Chippewa.\" Located several miles upstream from the mouth of the Chippewa River, Pepin gave promise of becoming the natural outlet for the Chippewa trade. A modest economic boom commenced. Men traveling up the Mississippi on steamboats disembarked at Pepin Landing and walked or took stagecoaches to the Chippewa pineries before commencing their return journey, shepherding thousands of logs to the milling centers at Winona, La Crosse, and elsewhere. Agriculturalists were entering claims and taking up land nearby. Town lots were selling for good prices. Four dry-goods stores and three hotels were in operation. Though free-roaming hogs sometimes posed a nuisance in the streets, lodges such as the Free Masons, Good Templars, Odd Fellows, and Sons of Malta conferred on the town a tone of progressiveness. It was not long before a literary society took shape, and an agricultural society made an appearance, too, only to fizzle out. The Pepin Independent boasted that with approximately one hundred dwellings, the population of the town was approaching seven hundred. Even allowing for some exaggeration, the prospects of the community and the surrounding region appeared to be bright.\n\nThen the bottom fell out, with the financial panic of 1857. The economy stalled, and population growth halted. Subsequently, one observer noted that as a result of the nationwide economic depression, along with the harmful effects of eastern land speculators, \"the town was passed into a sleep from which it has never awakened.\" Even obtaining initial designation in 1858 as the county seat failed to turn things around, because Durand, located along the banks of the Chippewa River eighteen miles to the northeast, managed to wrest the title in a popular vote in 1861.\n\nPepin suffered several other setbacks during the late 1850s and early 1860s. Its boat landing was inadequate, and especially when water levels were low it was difficult, if not impossible, for steamboats to unload or take on passengers and freight. In addition, shallow-draft steamboats that began plying the Chippewa River soon cut heavily into the stage traffic between Pepin and the pineries, which previously had brought considerable business to the town. The opening of Beef Slough several miles south of town, at the mouth of the Chippewa River, as a collecting point for logs floated down the river further diverted traffic and business away from the town. Finally, when railroads began operating on the Minnesota side of the Mississippi River after 1870, the market potential of the town was reduced even further, destroying any chance for the town to become a major center of business and trade.\n\nNevertheless, even while the Civil War continued to rage, new settlers continued to drift into the hills and valleys extending from the Mississippi River around Pepin. The county's population doubled during the 1860s, from 2,392 to 4,649. (The pace of growth slowed during the 1870s, the population rising to only 6,226 by 1880.) The Ingalls family made up part of this influx. It took them a while to locate the kind of land they were looking for and to arrange for its purchase. Charles Ingalls and his brother Peter (who was three years older) were able to earn money as harvest hands in Minnesota for a while. On September 22, 1863, Charles teamed up with Caroline's brother Henry to purchase a quarter-section of land from an Englishman named Charles Nunn, who worked as a druggist in the village of Reed's Landing on the other side of Lake Pepin. They paid him $335 for the property, advancing only $35 in cash and taking out a mortgage on the rest. The parcel was on high ground, seven miles mainly north and a little west of Pepin. It was largely covered with trees but also contained some clearings where they could begin planting crops. Henry agreed to work the north eighty acres, with Charles taking the south half of the property.\n\nThe two brothers-in-law were only a year apart in age (Henry being the older of the two), and they made a good team. They frequently traded work, helping each other clear the land and harvest their crops as well as going out together to hunt and trap and fish. Earlier arrivals were already shipping small amounts of wheat and potatoes and other commodities down the Mississippi River by the time the Ingalls clan arrived. While Charles and Henry may have participated to some degree in these markets, they, like most of the other settlers in the area, remained largely self-sufficient. They planted gardens, milked their own cows, butchered hogs that roamed more or less freely in the woods, and hunted and trapped wild game. Everyone participated actively in the fall butchering process, which was vividly described many years later by Laura Ingalls Wilder in Little House in the Big Woods. She also wrote about hickory-smoking meat, converting deer hides into leather, churning butter, making cheese, baking bread, gathering honey, molding bullets, and manufacturing maple sugar. Charles bundled up furs that he had trapped and carried them on his back to Pepin. For Caroline there was a constant round of cooking, tending garden, sewing, and keeping house. The work for both of them was never-ending and energy draining.\n\nAnd then the household became larger. On January 10, 1865, on Charles's twenty-ninth birthday and just short of their fifth wedding anniversary, the couple had their first child, a girl they named Mary Amelia. A little more than two years later, on February 7, 1867, a second daughter arrived. They named her Laura Elizabeth. She had blue eyes, like her father, and brown hair. There was nothing about her to lead her parents to suspect that some day she would become a celebrated personality.\n\nA new baby meant that now there would be four mouths to feed. Meanwhile, depressed economic conditions afflicted Wisconsin and the rest of the country between 1867 and 1871, leading Charles and Caroline to begin thinking seriously about moving someplace else to try their luck under new conditions. If we believe Laura's rendition of the story sixty years later, it was Charles--not Caroline--who pushed for venturing out again. On the frontier, talk abounded about land deals and economic opportunities that were open to people who were adventurous and willing to take advantage of them. In November 1867, Charles Ingalls and Henry Quiner signed legal papers dividing up their quarter-section of land, allowing either to sell his half and move if he desired. Five months later each family sold their half of the property for $1,012.50 to a Swedish settler named Gustaf Gustafson, who arranged to pay them for it in installments.\n\nIn the meantime, apparently, the brothers-in-law either had seen an advertisement or had talked to a land agent from Chariton County, Missouri, prompting them to try their luck in the rolling hills of central Missouri, just north of the Missouri River. Charles and Henry agreed to pay Adamantine Johnson, a big Missouri land dealer, for their plots in installments. At the end of May 1868 each signed promissory notes of $900 for eighty acres of fertile, partially wooded land.\n\nIt is not entirely clear whether the two families actually moved to Missouri during the summer of 1868. Laura did not write about this episode later in her autobiography or in her novels, nor did she leave behind any record of it. If, in fact, the families did attempt to start farming in Chariton County, things must not have worked out. Within a year's time, the Ingallses were living on the treeless prairies of southeastern Kansas, which were quickly filling up during the late 1860s. It is likely that the Ingallses never set eyes on the mortgaged land they had purchased in Missouri, and on February 25, 1870, while they were living in Kansas, Charles Ingalls legally returned title to the land to Adamantine Johnson.\n\nNortheastern Kansas had been the scene of bloody skirmishes between Yankee abolitionists and Southern slaveholders after it was opened up for settlement by the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. The ensuing war between the states had temporarily slowed migration to Kansas, but by 1868 and 1869 settlers were rushing into the southeastern part of the state in response to invitations and advertisements of land speculators and town boosters who stood to gain from an influx of people.\n\nOnce again, just as back in Wisconsin, the Ingallses were moving into a new region that was rapidly filling up, arriving just ahead of the bulk of newcomers. In September 1869, shortly after crossing the Verdigris River, Charles and Caroline Ingalls and their two daughters came to the new town of Independence, just a few weeks after the first crude buildings had been erected. That same month there appeared the first issue of the Independence Pioneer, which was published for several weeks in Oswego, a town several miles farther east, until a printing press could be brought to independence. This rawest of frontier towns was referred to as \"Hayhouse Town\" or \"Haytown\" by local Indians, because the roofs of many of the houses were made of hay. Montgomery County had been split off from Wilson County just two years earlier. Verdigris City, on the banks of the river after which it was named, and Montgomery City, both of which were also founded in 1869, shared county-seat aspirations with Independence. But they conceded the title to the latter after an election and a subsequent district-court decision handed down in May 1870.\n\nAfter no doubt inquiring about available land in the area and after stocking up on provisions, the Ingallses proceeded southwesterly from Independence, halting at a spot in Rutland Township on the western side of Walnut Creek, about thirteen miles from town. This was largely treeless land, flat to gently rolling in terrain, cut through by creeks and streams. In the distance to the northwest, a line of bluffs were etched against the sky. With immigrants pouring into the area and the town of Independence growing rapidly, Charles may have found sporadic employment as a carpenter, just as he would in other places later. His occupation was listed as \"carpenter\"--not \"farmer\"--in the 1870 census.\n\nFirst, however, there was plenty of work to be done in getting settled before winter, once they had decided on a location. How they intended to obtain title to the land or whether they actually realized what their legal status was there is uncertain. They should have known that they had moved into the fifty-mile-wide Osage Indian Reserve that ran east to west across two-thirds of the southern part of the state. As such, they were intruders illegally squatting on the land, but they had plenty of company in what they were doing. When the census taker made his rounds the following year, among the neighbors listed on the forms were A. K. Johnson, a thirty-six-year-old farmer from Illinois with his twenty-eight-year-old Ohio-born wife and their four children; G. L. Rowles, a twenty-four-year-old single farmer from Maryland; an elderly black couple from Pennsylvania named Tann and their thirty-four-year-old son, George, a physician; G. N. Lucker, a twenty-seven-year-old farmer born in Iowa and his eighteen-year-old Illinois-born wife; another single farmer, Ed Mason, age twenty-five and born in England; and a Kentucky farm couple, Robert and Mary Gilmore, fifty-two and forty-four, respectively, and their five children, ranging in age from sixteen to three.\n\nAlthough a healthy representation of Missourians and Kentuckians were listed as living in Rutland Township in the 1870 census, Ohio and Indiana furnished by far the largest number of residents, with strong showings from Illinois and New York and smaller contributions from Virginia, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan, and England. These were to a large degree the same kinds of people the Ingallses had encountered in Wisconsin, minus the heavy leavening of Scandinavian immigrants.\n\nAll of them were there to get a start on the land. Whether individuals hoped to take out homestead claims after the Indians departed or whether they intended to purchase land from the railroad or acquire it in some other fashion is not entirely clear. Most likely, all the recent arrivals had been lured by advertisements and predictions that Indian control would shortly be extinguished and that white settlers would then be free to take ownership.\n\nNot surprisingly, much of Laura's attention in her fictionalized version of the episode in Little House on the Prairie focused upon the family's concern about and relationships with the Osage Indians as that tribe's members tried to grapple with the difficult dilemma confronting them. The Osages were clearly in a no-win situation. Driven west, like other tribes, by the constant pressure of westward-moving white settlers and by treaties promising them that each forced move would be the last, they now faced the prospect of being pushed out one more time and having to move south to a much smaller area set aside for them in Oklahoma.\n\nAlthough Laura later had to rely on stories related by her parents rather than on her own childhood memories to describe the family's year on the Kansas prairie, her descriptions of frequent powwows and drums in the night, Indians walking into cabins to take settlers' food and tobacco, and other anxious moments between the settlers and the Indians conform to the historical record. The pressure of settlers entering the region caused the Osages to worry that they would be forced to move off their reserve. Although there was plenty of land in the region that could have been obtained free under the provisions of the Homestead Act of 1862 or that could have been purchased for $1.25 an acre under the Preemption Act of 1841, settlers demonstrated a \"decided mania\" for moving onto Indian lands. It seemed to be a kind of game for many of them.\n\nRailroads had pushed west across Kansas beginning in 1865. Some railroad buccaneers had turned their glance longingly south toward the Gulf of Mexico, a path directly traversing tribal reserves that had been set aside for the Cherokees and the Osages. Directors of the Kansas and Neosho Valley Railroad, through skillful political lobbying in Washington, negotiated a deal in 1867 to purchase the Cherokee Neutral Tract in the southeastern corner of the state for only $1.00 an acre. Realizing that they had little choice in the matter, the Cherokees reluctantly accepted the $800,000 being offered them for the land rather than pressing for the $12,000,000 they had originally sought.\n\nThe Osage lands, the last major Indian reserve in the state, contained close to 9 million acres, making it by far the largest. It is little wonder that many white settlers impatiently awaited its opening. When the Ingalls family arrived in September 1869 they found themselves in the middle of the maneuvering and contention. The Osage Treaty of September 1865 had ceded a little more than 4 million acres to the federal government, about one-fifth of it for $300,000 in cash and the other four-fifths to be held in trust and sold over time, with the proceeds going to the Indians. Three years later, however, through the use of bribes, presents, and other pressures, the Leavenworth, Lawrence, and Galveston Railroad managed to negotiate a draft treaty that would have allowed it to purchase 8 million acres of the Osage Reserve for the absurdly low price of $.20 an acre over a fifteen-year period. Angry protests and political pressures mounted by rival railroad groups and by settlers who did not want to have to purchase land from the railroad at premium prices blocked confirmation of the treaty in the U.S. Senate. Meanwhile, the Settlers' Protective Association went into operation. Its leaders estimated that between twelve and fifteen thousand settlers were already squatting on the Osage lands by 1868. Early the following year newcomers to the region could read newspaper editorials condemning the railroad's attempted land grab and encouraging them to move onto the Osage Diminished Reserve (even though it was illegal to do so) in order to guarantee that hardworking farmers--not greedy businessmen--would be the beneficiaries when the Osages finally moved to Oklahoma.\n\nInto this complex set of circumstances Charles and Caroline Ingalls brought their girls. Like the other settlers, they were squatting illegally on the land, waiting for the time--soon, they hoped--when Indian title would be relinquished so that they would be able to claim ownership for themselves. Presumably, they opposed railroad acquisition of the land, which would have necessitated their paying more for the land than it would cost to buy it from the government. Undoubtedly, they welcomed the prospect of the Indians' departure, but they were somewhat ambivalent in their attitudes toward them. In Laura's version of the story, her mother was fearful of them, but her father frequently managed to put himself in their shoes and to understand their way of thinking.\n\nIt was neither the railroad nor the Indians themselves, however, who bore the brunt of criticism in Little House on the Prairie. Rather, the federal government played the villain's role for its alleged misleading of the settlers by encouraging them to move in and then reneging on the deal and ordering them off the land. Soldiers, in fact, did sometimes attempt to enforce the law and make the illegal squatters leave, but if anyone was encouraging the settlers to move onto the Osage Traci before 1870, it probably was the settlers' groups and the local town boosters, not the federal government.\n\nLaura's descriptions of night-time drumbeating and of increased traffic along the trail running next to their cabin coincide with the stories told by historians about the distress and sense of crisis pervading the Osage camps. Grasshoppers, drought, and inability to follow the buffalo herds, as they customarily had done, reduced the Osages' food supplies, leaving them in \"a deplorable condition.\" A newly formed Board of Indian Commissioners, set up in 1868 as a watchdog agency for Indian affairs, plaintively observed that even though the Osages were reconciled to their ultimate removal. \"They are human beings, they have rights.\" The final chapter of the story was written on July 15, 1870, when Congress legislated for the survey and sale of the remaining Osage trust lands. With that, the members of the tribe bowed to the inevitable and prepared to leave for a reservation in Oklahoma.\n\nHow aware the Ingallses were of all the goings-on in Washington and other places we cannot know. They were not alone on the prairie and lived only thirteen miles from the county seat. Little House on the Prairie leaves what they knew and why they decided to leave obscure. Was it simply pique at the government and at the soldiers who were sent to order illegal squatters off the land? Was it lack of information? A year later there was a big rush of settlers into the county. In the meantime, there had hardly been any time to try their luck at farming in Kansas. They spent only about a year in the state. What kinds of crops Charles Ingalls may have planted in that time we do not know, if he planted any at all. The stories Laura told later were about building a cabin, digging a well, getting sick with \"fever and ague\" (probably malaria), helping with cattle drives going past their place, and interacting with the Indians. In August 1870, shortly before the census was taken, a baby sister was born, Caroline Celestia, whom the family called Carrie.\n\nWhile they were considering what to do, a letter arrived from Gustaf Gustafson in Pepin saying that he was unable to make any more payments on the land that he had bought from them and that he wanted them to take it back. The offer sounded inviting. They were discouraged with what had happened to them in Kansas, and now the opportunity to go back home to relatives and friends was welcome. So they packed their things into the wagon and headed back to Wisconsin, retracing their steps through Missouri and Iowa. There was a big welcome waiting for them from Grandpa and Grandma Ingalls, Peter and Eliza and their family, and the others.\n\nPeople continued to move into the area, and some of the families who once had lived near Charles and Caroline Ingalls had departed in their absence. A new family living near the Ingallses was that of Thomas Huleatt (or Hewlet), who had been born in Ireland, and his wife, Maria, a Pennsylvanian. Their house was just a mile down the road. Many years later in Little House in the Big Woods, Laura mentioned them and their children, Clarence, who was a year older than she, and Eva, who was three years younger. \"Laura and Clarence ran and shouted and climbed trees,\" she wrote, \"while Mary and Eva walked nicely together and talked.\" Even allowing for some exaggeration in the way she described the opposing temperaments of herself and her sister Mary, we can presume that Laura was essentially being truthful in identifying herself as a tomboy. The adventurous streak that led her to want to climb trees, ride ponies, go wading in creeks, and assume leadership roles among her peers no doubt showed itself early, and it would continue to set her apart later in life.\n\nBesides the Huleatts, Laura also mentioned a childless couple, the Petersons, who were Swedish. Early migration into the area had been heavily Scandinavian. Except for Pennsylvania, the most common birthplace for adults residing in Pepin Township, as recorded by the census taker in 1870, was Sweden. Almost as many had been) born in the combined area of Prussia, Bavaria, and the other German states, and about a third that many came from Ireland. There were, in addition, handfuls who derived from Canada, Norway, Scotland, France, and Switzerland. New York ranked second behind Pennsylvania as an American birthplace, with about half as many coming from there. Ohio and Vermont each had about one-quarter as many as Pennsylvania, and other states, such as Connecticut, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Indiana, Maine, and Maryland each contributed up to a half dozen of the adults residing in the township in 1870. It was a population slightly more native than foreign-born in origin and heavily weighted toward the Middle Atlantic, New England, and Midwestern states as starting points.\n\nLaura later wrote in Little House in the Big Woods about some of the family gatherings and activities that she remembered. Henry Quiner and Charles Ingalls frequently traded work, helping each other during planting and harvest seasons, and they cooperated with other chores and activities, such as butchering. Agriculturalists were making some progress in carving out farms from the surrounding forests, as was indicated in a story published in the Durand Times in October 1871 after the reporter had made a quick trip around the county. Threshing was just about completed, the newspaper story noted. \"Corn and potatoes are excellent,\" the article continued. \"The farmers are building and otherwise improving their farms and adding to their own comforts many little things that go to make up a world of enjoyment by the many conveniences.\"\n\nJust before Christmas, Uncle Peter and Aunt Eliza brought cousins Peter, Alice, and Ella over to meet baby Carrie and to play with Mary and Laura. As Laura wrote later, her father's brothers George and James came to a dance at Grandpa Ingalls's house. George played his bugle for the girls. Another time Laura and Mary met more cousins when they went for a day to the home of Caroline's sister Martha and her husband, Charles Carpenter.\n\nFor a short time, until the Gustafsons moved out of their cabin, Laura and her family lived with Uncle Henry and Aunt Polly Quiner and their cousins Louisa, Charley, Albert, and Lottie. The Ingalls extended family was mostly still around. Now that the family was back in home territory, the girls could see Grandma and Grandpa Ingalls and Uncle Peter and Aunt Eliza Ingalls and that group of cousins, Peter, Alice, Ella, and Edith. Uncle Tom Quiner, who would spend more than twenty years working for the Laird-Norton Lumber Company, came from Eau Claire to visit his sister and brother-in-law and nieces.\n\nSince she had turned six by the time the family returned to Wisconsin, Mary was enrolled for the summer term in the Barry Corner School. The schoolhouse was only about half a mile down the road from their cabin. The teacher, Anna Barry, lived nearby with her parents, after whom the crossroads was named. They had been among the earliest arrivals in the area, coming from near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during the mid-1850s. Among the twenty students enrolled for the term besides Mary were Uncle Henry and Aunt Polly's four children as well as Clarence Huleatt.\n\nLaura was lonesome, and perhaps slightly jealous, when Mary went to school, leaving her home in the cabin with her mother and little sister while her father was often hunting or working in the fields. In October, when the fall term started, her parents allowed her to go to school with Mary, even though she was still only four years old. The experiment lasted only until Christmas, however, and after that Laura was kept home from school until she was a little older.\n\nBoth of her parents, but especially her mother, were interested in obtaining a good education for Laura and her sisters. Even while living in primitive log cabins, they valued books and tried to ensure that their children would, too. Always on Sundays and often on other days, Caroline read to the family from novels such as Norwood or Millbank, church papers, magazines, newspapers, or anything else they could get their hands on. A favorite of the girls was Charles's big green-covered volume titled A Description of Man and Nature in the Polar and Equatorial Regions of the Globe. Most important, of course, was the \"Good Book\"--the Bible. Laura liked to look at the pictures in the family's big Bible, especially one of Adam giving names to the animals.\n\nEverywhere the family lived, if there was a church nearby they attended services. But there is no record of their attending while they were living in Pepin County. They were too far out in the country to easily get to the Methodist church in town, so they made do on their own by reading the Bible and saying their prayers before going to bed. There was little in the way of social events or community activity on the ridge where they lived, so families there had to entertain themselves mostly and relish occasional visits with neighbors and get-togethers with relatives. Charles Ingalls fulfilled his civic responsibilities by casting ballots in township elections and serving as treasurer of the Barry Corner school district. Township supervisors met at least once in the family's cabin. In this open, fluid frontier society, a sort of grass-roots democracy quickly emerged, reliant upon heavy personal involvement in community affairs.\n\nWithin the family circle, Charles was a loving father who enjoyed romping with his girls and sharing his infectious brand of good humor. Laura remembered best his story-telling and fiddling abilities, but he also had enough of the kid in him to get down on all fours with his girls and play \"Mad Dog\" with them. His affectionate nature shone through in the tenderness he displayed toward his daughters and in the amount of time he devoted to them. Much as she loved her mother, Laura always identified more closely with her father, to whom she was his \"little half-pint of cider half drunk up.\"\n\nIf the example set by Laura's father engendered spiritedness and spunkiness in her, her mother instructed her in the ways of becoming a woman in an environment that presented girls with few alternatives beyond marrying and raising a family. Laura and Mary assisted their mother with chores around the house. They helped by washing dishes, making beds, and cleaning house. They also learned about washing and ironing, mending and sewing, baking and cooking. The primary image Laura retained of her mother was one of her sitting in a rocker, sewing by lamplight, while her father played his fiddle or told a story.\n\nIf her autobiography and novels are at all accurate, Laura and her sisters grew up in a warm, nurturing environment, loved by their parents and imbued with a sense of self-worth and significance. Though the family may have been financially unstable, the girls were enveloped with a sense of security and love. They understood that their parents were always there to protect and take care of them. The picture Laura later portrayed of her family was one of togetherness and warmth. Whatever dangers lurked outside, inside their little houses life was cozy and comfortable.\n\nIt may have been inevitable that, having tasted prairie life in Kansas, Charles Ingalls would eventually tire of the wooded--and increasingly crowded--country around Pepin. Laura later described him as the typically restless type of frontiersman who was always looking toward the horizon where people were not crowding him and where he had ample elbowroom. Caroline, who longed for settled conditions and civilized practices, did not stand in the way of her husband when he started talking once again about moving, despite her reluctance. This time they looked directly westward toward lands that were opening up in southwestern Minnesota as rail lines were built in the region. Charles's brother Peter and his wife, Eliza, had been looking that way, too, and decided to depart with them but not go as far. Instead, they planned to find a farm near the Zumbro River in the southeastern part of the state.\n\nIt took several months for the two families to prepare for the move. Charles and Caroline obtained $1,000 for the land they had paid $167.50 for seven years earlier. They sold it to Andrew Anderson on October 28, 1873, and then went to visit Charles's parents and to stay with Peter and Eliza and their family for several months until the weather improved. They needed to cross the Mississippi River while the ice was still thick enough to support their wagons. So they said their good-byes to friends and family one day in early February, just before Laura's eighth birthday, and set out. They soon found an empty house that the two families stayed in for several weeks until the weather was warmer. Peter had rented a farm near the Zumbro River, and when they got to it, Charles and Caroline and the girls waved good-bye and turned their eyes toward the western horizon.\n\nAlong the way Laura saw her first train. Their destination now was near the end of the line of a new railroad whose tracks had just been laid the year before. The Winona and St. Peter Railroad was a branch of the great Chicago and North Western system, with headquarters in Chicago. The extension of its tracks west through Mankato and New Ulm, as with new lines everywhere, had led to the quick establishment of communities planted around the depots, which were set down every eight or twelve miles or so. New towns appeared at places such as Lamberton, Walnut Station, and Tracy, before the route turned to the northwest toward Marshall and ultimately to Lake Kampeska in Dakota Territory.\n\nOnce again, the Ingallses found themselves in the vanguard of settlement. Pepin had been only several years old when they got there, and Independence had been only a few weeks old upon their arrival. The town they settled near this time, Walnut Station (its name was later changed to Walnut Grove), had just gotten started in 1873, the year the trains started running, and it was formally platted by surveyors only a few weeks before the Ingallses arrived. Redwood County had been established in 1862, and settlement began in earnest two years later. For more than a century, it had been part of the territory of the Santee Sioux; before that, a succession of other tribal groups, including Cheyennes, Iowas, and Otoes, crisscrossed the region in search of game and fish. In 1851, in the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, the Santees ceded their vast hunting grounds in return for annuities and a ten-mile-wide strip of land along each side of the Minnesota River. The Ingalls family's experiences with the Osages in Kansas had reinforced Caroline's wariness toward Indians. Now there was more for her to be worried about. On their journey across Minnesota, they came across several shells of buildings and other reminders of the bloody Sioux Uprising in 1862.\n\nThe Indian disturbances of 1862 had driven out the first white settler in the area around the future Walnut Station, a man named Brown. He had arrived a year earlier and squatted south of town near a grove of walnut trees straddling Plum Creek. Surveyors came through several years later, pitching their tents in the grove and marking off the townships around them. The first permanent settler, a Norwegian immigrant named Eleck Nelson, arrived with his wife, Alena, in 1870 and commenced farming. This Lutheran family, which eventually included seven children, was typical of the large Scandinavian element that settled the region.\n\nThe town sprang up following the arrival of the railroad in 1873. J. H. Anderson and Gustave Sunwall owned the first store in town, which carried a general line of goods. Two brothers, Elias and Lafayette Bedal, played prominent roles in the community early on, the former going in the grain-buying business and the latter taking over as postmaster. The first school was held in Lafayette Bedal's home during the winter of 1873-1874 with fifteen students. The brothers also were responsible for having the town platted. Despite high hopes, however, Walnut Station grew slowly, its development inhibited in part by competition from Tracy, seven miles farther down the line. Nor did it have an opportunity to become a county seat like Independence or Pepin, since Redwood Falls, thirty miles to the northeast, captured the prize.\n\nExcept for the unusual walnut grove south of town and other growths of trees along creeks and riverbeds and around lakes and other natural firebreaks, the terrain that the Ingallses encountered when they arrived in Redwood County was bare of timber. The soil was fertile, a dark, rich loam, two to three feet thick and well drained by the numerous streams that fed into the Minnesota River. The field notes composed by an early surveyor named Moore hinted at why the land seemed to be so enticing: \"The country is the richest quality of gently rolling prairie. It rolls in swelling billows as far as the eye can reach. Standing on a gentle eminence, one can look away to where the prairie meets the horizon in a dark blue line, resembling a belt of timber.\" There were few trees that needed to be cleared in preparation for planting crops, but the tough prairie grasses--thickly matted and deep rooted--resisted the plow initially and made breaking the soil a difficult task.\n\nHaving traveled nearly two hundred miles across southern Minnesota, the Ingallses were looking for a place to turn the fertile prairie grassland into a producing farm. About two miles north of town along Plum Creek they found a quarter-section available for purchase. Charles paid a Norwegian settler $430.00 for the 172-acre farm, and the family moved into the dwelling, which, like many in the area during the first few years of settlement, was a sod house. More precisely, it was a dugout, built into the bank along the creek. By now Laura was old enough to have experiences such as living in sod houses register keenly in her memory. The creek and the dugout and the surrounding terrain would provide many interesting stories for her later, as she reconstructed them in On the Banks of Plum Creek. She would recall the delights of wading in the creek, walking through dazzlingly colorful beds of wildflowers, and watching beautiful sunrises as well as the fears engendered by overflowing creek beds, howling blizzards, and rampaging grasshoppers.\n\nUnfortunately, the Ingallses arrived in Redwood County simultaneously with a severe invasion of locusts. The year before the county had been seriously affected by the pests, but 1874 and 1875 proved to be disastrous for farmers, as clouds of the creatures darkened the sky and then marched relentlessly across fields and anything else that stood in their way, stripping every living thing and depositing their eggs in the ground, guaranteeing that they would be back the following year. Charles Ingalls must have heard something before he moved about the previous year's infestation of locusts and grasshoppers; most likely the farmer who sold out to him left the area to escape the grasshoppers. Undaunted, Charles went to work for his closest neighbor, Eleck Nelson, in order to earn some cash and get ready for putting in a crop the following year.\n\nMeanwhile, although the two miles lying between them and the town kept the family on the farm most of the time, they did go to church services and to shop, and Mary and Laura were enrolled in the town school. For the first time in her short life Laura now had considerable opportunity to interact with other children, and she began to develop some of the personality traits that would become so prominent later in life, such as spunkiness, generosity, competitiveness, and resentment toward snobbery. Later, while working on her novel about Plum Creek, she drew a little map of the town, showing the railroad, the post office, a couple of stores and houses, the church, and the schoolhouse. Her memories of the village were fading by then, but in fact Walnut Grove was a slow-growing town, its population reaching only 153 by the 1880 census.\n\nFor the first time the Ingallses had a chance to attend church regularly. Both Charles and Caroline had been brought up in religious atmospheres, and they made Bible-reading and prayers an important part of their family life. Rev. Edwin H. Alden, a thirty-eight-year-old Dartmouth-educated Congregational minister from Waseca, which lay a hundred miles east along the railroad, arrived in the community in August 1874 under the auspices of the Home Missionary Society to organize a new congregation. Charles and Caroline were among the dozen or so charter members and took advantage of the opportunity to be baptized. Another charter member, Julie Tower, became Laura's Sunday school teacher. A church building quickly materialized on the south end of the tiny town, with Charles Ingalls contributing a sacrificial $26.15 to help pay for the bell that was installed in the bell tower. Laura later noted that he had to forego a much needed pair of new boots to do it, but she wrote that the contribution had been only $3.00. She also described the gifts and the festivities that were held in the church five days before Christmas, when the building was formally dedicated. Small as it was, the little congregation was unable financially to support a full-time pastor for several years. For Laura's mother the church, in addition to what spiritual significance it possessed, stood out as a bulwark of civilization in the midst of a still forming, rough frontier culture. Her father, who was elected a trustee of the congregation, loved to sing at the services and to play gospel tunes on his fiddle. Biblical teachings and precepts became an integral part of Laura's life, all the more meaningful and significant because they were seldom called into question. If she did not always completely live up to their admonitions, she was not a doubter or a hypocrite about the teachings.\n\nThe building of a schoolhouse the following year allowed instruction to move out of Lafayette Bedal's house. Besides the \"Three R's,\" Laura now started learning some important things about getting along with others. She began to divide her peers into ones she liked, such as Nettie Kennedy, and ones she did not much like, such as Nellie Owens (later a model for Nellie Oleson in her novels). She learned something about social democracy and about being kind and fair to schoolmates. But she also learned about the sweetness of revenge and the temptation to deceive one's parents, at least until one was discovered.\n\nMost of the time, though, Laura and Mary were busy on the farm, doing things that little girls did, helping their mother around the house or playing games or running around the creek and the nearby tableland. There were many ways for eight- or ten-year-old girls to be helpful in the family. They could wash the dishes, help clean, run errands, drive the cows out to pasture, and watch Carrie. By the end of their first summer, their little sister had turned four and was capable of getting into lots of mischief. They could play house on a flat rock on top of the creek bank, pick wildflowers, have fun with their dolls, and occasionally have a party. Their mother read them Bible stories and other things. There were prairie gophers to run after and other wildlife to examine. On the Fourth of July they all went to a picnic, where there were speeches, singing, and games for everyone.\n\nThe girls were not too young to realize that the family's financial situation was precarious. Living as close as they did to the land, they were aware that the family's well-being--perhaps even its survival--depended on how well the crops fared and on what kind of a price could be obtained for them. In the spring of 1875, with the help of Eleck Nelson, Charles built a new little wooden house for them on the other side of Plum Creek. He planted a crop of wheat that looked splendid until hordes of grasshoppers descended on it and methodically destroyed it. All over the region stores closed their doors, people moved out, and farmers who stayed behind looked for temporary employment in the harvest fields of eastern Minnesota, which had been untouched by the locusts. Charles Ingalls joined this migration, returning home at the end of the season with some much needed cash, allowing the family to hold out until another planting season.\n\nThat fall the family moved into town into a little house behind the Congregational church, so that it would be easier on Caroline when their expected baby arrived. On November 1, the three sisters got a baby brother, who was named Charles Frederick, but they called him Freddie. Charles may have found work in town during the winter, carpentering or clerking in one of the town's businesses, but he had no intention of doing so permanently.\n\nThe following spring he was back in the fields, optimistically planting a new crop of wheat, hopeful that this time he would get a good harvest and be able to pay his bills. Laura and Mary walked to town to attend school for the term that went from spring into the summer. Once again clouds of grasshoppers darkened the horizon, once again they devoured everything in sight, and once again the crop was ruined. This time the parents concluded that enough was enough and they would try their luck somewhere else. Many other families were packing up and leaving, too. Friends of theirs in town, the Steadmans, who were fellow charter members of the Congregational church, indicated that they were going to buy a little hotel in the village of Burr Oak in northeastern Iowa, and they invited the Ingallses to join them on the venture and help operate it. By now Charles was desperate enough to abandon the idea of farming temporarily and willing to try living in town.\n\nThey sold their farm for four hundred dollars in July to Abraham and Margaret Keller and headed east along the trail that had brought them to Walnut Grove little more than two years earlier. First they stayed with Peter and Eliza at their farm along the Zumbro River in southeastern Minnesota until it was time to join the Steadmans in Burr Oak. The girls had fun playing with their cousins Peter, Alice, Ella, and Edith and with their baby brother, Lansford. There were chores and work to be done but time for play, too. Laura especially enjoyed going to get the cows and driving them home to be milked. Then tragedy struck. It was no less a tragedy for being so common on the frontier. Freddie took ill, and suddenly he was gone. It was Sunday, August 27, 1876; he was only nine months old.\n\nSoon they were on their way again, to meet the Steadmans in Burr Oak and help run the hotel there, as had been planned. Grief over Freddie, along with the chilly fall rains, darkened the family's mood. It was a cold, miserable journey for the girls and their parents. They drove directly south along dirt roads and then three miles beyond the Iowa state line.\n\nThe road they were traveling merged into State Street, which ran north and south through the center of town, flanked by East and West Streets, and crossed perpendicularly by seven or eight side streets. Only about two hundred residents inhabited the several dozen houses that were scattered about the little community. The town's prospects for attracting people were minimal. It possessed no railroad connection. Despite some vague talk about building one, nothing ever came of it. In 1869 the tracks had reached Decorah, the county seat twelve miles south. Lacking such a transportation link, Burr Oak was destined to remain a small, out-of-the way farming village, largely isolated from currents of change that were transforming American life after the Civil War.\n\nAlthough not as new as the other places they had lived in, the little town was not so old either, having gotten its start in 1851. A rush of settlers into Winneshiek County after 1848 had occurred directly after the removal of the Winnebago Indians, who had been the predominant native presence there, sharing and sometimes contesting the territory with the Sauk and the Fox tribes. A large influx of settlement had come in 1850, with the founding of Decorah, Bloomfield, Springfield, and several other nearby communities. Soon German, Bohemian, Swiss, Norwegian, English, and Scottish immigrants rushed in.\n\nStanding on a major route to the west during the early phase of settlement in northeastern Iowa, Burr Oak had shared for a brief time in the activity and excitement of the westward movement. However, by the time the Ingalls family arrived, life had settled into humdrum routine. On July 4, 1876, the Old Settlers' Association was organized to recognize the accomplishments of the pioneers who had been trailblazers in the country a quarter-century before. The two hotels in town still attracted a respectable amount of business, both from transients passing through the area and from permanent residents, but the long-term economic prospects of the town were severely limited. It was undoubtedly a measure of the family's financial desperation in Walnut Grove that Charles and Caroline had decided to take their chances in a partnership with the Steadmans in the Burr Oak House. The establishment was also known as the Masters Hotel, after its previous owner, William Masters, who sold it to the Steadmans when he moved from Burr Oak to Walnut Grove.\n\nTo a nine-going-on-ten year old like Laura, the hotel probably seemed much grander than it actually was. Built into a hillside that sloped down toward Silver Creek, which ran through the lot behind it, the eleven-room structure occupied three levels, the middle one opening onto the street in front. Customers could enter the establishment through two doors on the front porch, the one on the right leading into the parlor and the one on the left into the barroom. A single bedroom behind the parlor and several more upstairs accommodated guests and permanent residents. A night's lodging cost twenty-five cents, as did a meal. A gallon of wine could be had for the same and a shot of liquor for one-fourth the cost. Down below on the lower level were the dining room, kitchen, and a bedroom where the Ingallses slept--father, mother, and their three girls.\n\nLaura and Mary helped with waiting on tables and doing the dishes, while their parents occupied themselves with cooking and cleaning and other duties, but the work itself in the tiny establishment could not have been very heavy. The hotel's location on a hillside, with a creek curving through its backyard and a little fishpond and springhouse, made for a picturesque setting. The girls were able to play with the older two Steadman boys, Johnny and Reuben, and often were left to look after the Steadman baby, Tommy. Laura was beginning to observe foibles in human behavior, things that would have eluded her a year or two earlier. She noticed one reason that little Tommy cried so much was that his mother shook him and slapped him a lot. And Johnny, whose lameness should have occasioned sympathetic feelings in her, only elicited her scorn because of his nastiness. He was always pinching and pulling people's hair, breaking playthings, and generally making a nuisance of himself.\n\nThe girls' parents worried mainly about the potentially bad influence of the boarders and the men who frequented the barroom upstairs. Some of the men, such as Will Reed, who taught at the school on the hill, were admirable people. That label even applied to Mr. Bisby, who later rented a house to the Ingallses. But he annoyed Laura by fancying himself as someone who could teach her how to sing. Since the family was somewhat dependent upon his goodwill as a patron, Laura had to play along with his conceit. Their major concern, however, was with the drunks who shot holes in doors or who allegedly burned their lungs out by igniting fumes in their throats left by bouts with the bottle.\n\nWhen the two-room school situated on the hill two blocks east of the hotel was in session, the girls enjoyed attending it. There they made friends with the other schoolchildren and worked on their lessons. Laura found multiplication tables to be difficult at first, but she shone as a reader and enjoyed reading her lessons aloud at night. They included stories and poems such as \"The Burial of Sir John Moore,\" \"The Bison Track,\" \"Paul Revere's Ride,\" \"The Pied Piper,\" \"Tubal Cain,\" and \"The Village Blacksmith.\" Laura later remembered with gratitude the excellent training in reading that Will Reed, the school's principal, gave her. There were few diversions in the little town, but from time to time amateur theatricals were staged, there was a brass band, and temperance meetings and religious revivals also provided some diversions for the Ingallses and their neighbors. But except for a fire scare or a fistfight now and then, life must have been awfully dull in Burr Oak.\n\nThe small amount of work that he had to do at the hotel left Charles with plenty of time to go into partnership with J. H. Porter, who ran a grinding mill. In addition, Charles did odd jobs and may have done some carpentering when opportunities arose. Worried about the hotel's bad influence on their girls, the Ingallses moved out of it and into a second-floor apartment above the grocery store just down the street to the south in January 1877. Later that spring Charles sold his interest in the gristmill and prepared to look for jobs in the fields during spring planting. The family moved a second time, to Mr. Bisby's small red-brick house, located several blocks north up State Street and two blocks west, close to the Congregational church.\n\nLaura enjoyed living near the edge of an oak wood and once again having a cow. She was responsible for taking it out to pasture every morning and bringing it back every night. \"I loved to wander along the creek and look at the flowers and wriggle my toes among the cool, lush grasses,\" she later wrote in \"Pioneer Girl.\" \"I was such a great girl now that I wore my shoes all day, but I always went barefoot after the cow.\" She also enjoyed wandering around with her chum Alice Ward in the graveyard at the other end of town, peering at the names on the gravestones and reading the inscriptions. Further enlivening the household was the arrival of a new sister, Grace, Pearl, born on May 23, 1877. The new baby had golden hair like Marys and blue eyes like their father's.\n\nIt must have been somewhat disconcerting to Laura to discover that a woman living across the street wanted to adopt her. The daughters of Mrs. Starr, the wife of a doctor who also served as town clerk, had moved away to teach. The woman told Caroline that she was lonesome and wished that Laura could come live with her and her husband and keep her company and help her around the house. The thought that her parents might actually abandon her like that could have been traumatic for a ten year old. The way in which Laura related the episode in a humorous vein many years later, however, suggests how secure she felt within her family circle and how confident she was in the love and protection that encompassed her and her sisters while they were growing up. Describing the scene in her autobiography, she wrote, \"But Ma smiled at me and said she couldn't possibly spare me. So Mrs. Star[r] went away looking very disappointed.\"\n\nWith four girls to feed and take care of, the need for more income became insistent. The Ingallses had come to Burr Oak because the grasshopper invasion had driven them out of Minnesota and they had desperately needed to find something--anything--to help them get by temporarily. Now, after a year in Burr Oak and nothing but temporary jobs between them and destitution, they decided to return to Walnut Grove and give it another try. At least Charles would be with his girls again; the various jobs he had taken were keeping him away from home most of the time now. The grasshopper infestation had receded, and the economic depression that had been going on since 1873 was beginning to lift. It was time to try farming again.\n\nCharles was in high spirits as the family traveled along, joking and laughing and singing. In the West, where the population was sparse, even the air seemed fresher. At night by their campfire, after the sun went down, he played his fiddle. As the notes of \"Yankee Doodle,\" \"Buffalo Gals,\" \"Arkansas Traveler,\" and \"Marching through Georgia\" wafted gently through the evening air, the girls and their parents wondered what to expect when they returned to Walnut Grove.\n\nA warm welcome awaited them when they drove into town. The Ensign family invited the Ingallses to stay with them until Charles was able to build a new house. He took a job in a store to earn some money, and the two families split household expenses. Mary, Laura, and Carrie, meanwhile, went to school with the three Ensign children, Willard, Anna, and Howard. They all studied their grammar, geography, history, and arithmetic lessons from the same books, although some of the children were further along than the others. Laura especially enjoyed spelling, remembering later her successes in the spelling bees. At Friday night \"spelling school,\" the entire town would come with their lamps and lanterns to witness the competitions.\n\nNow ten, almost eleven, Laura was learning something new every day about how people behaved and treated each other. Until then, most of the things she had learned had come from her parents; increasingly it would be from her peers and within the broader social context that she would pick up on instances of human greed and generosity, thoughtfulness and meanness, pride and ambition. In the schoolyard she could observe cliques forming, one around Carrie and the younger girls, the other around Mary and the older girls, leaving her in the middle. Being more independent-minded than the rest, Laura emerged as a natural leader and soon had the younger girls entering into such boys' games as Ante-I-Over, Pullaway, Prisoner's Base, and even baseball. Mary and her friends were scandalized by Laura's tomboyish behavior, and their mother apparently told her that she was getting to be too big to be playing with the boys like that.\n\nShe was beginning to look at boys somewhat differently now. When Howard Ensign asked her to promise to marry him one day, she considered the proposition seriously until he got jealous and cried when she played with another boy. That so disgusted Laura that she told Howard to forget the idea. But if puppy love was part of growing up, beginning to observe more closely and with more understanding the world of adult relationships was part of it, too. She discovered that the unhappy milliner who created such beautiful hats out of lace and ribbons and artificial flowers was gloomy all the time because she had been divorced from her husband. Laura saw farm wives come into town to take their drunken husbands home from the saloon, sisters trick each other out of inheritances, young women spite each other in competing for the affections of eligible young bachelors, and parents drive suitors away in order to prevent their grown children from getting married and abandoning them. She noticed how a male schoolteacher absentmindedly fondled young girls' hands and was disillusioned to discover that a Sunday school teacher had appropriated a lemon pie that Laura's mother had baked for a picnic and then told the other teachers that she had baked it herself.\n\nLaura went to work for Emeline Masters in the hotel during the summer of 1878. She earned fifty cents a week washing dishes, sweeping floors, dusting, making beds, setting tables, and baby-sitting the Masters's grandchild. In the hotel she only had to keep her ears and eyes open to learn about things that she not only would not have heard about at home but also sometimes did not entirely understand. Although she was still a schoolgirl, she bore a sturdy sense of responsibility. Her work contributed to the welfare of the family, and it was needed. Laura realized that her family was poor, but, looking around her, she could see that few of the other families in town were much better off.\n\nFrom William Masters her father bought a lot in the pasture behind the hotel and built another little house for the family in the spring of 1878. Afterward he rented a room downtown and began operating a butcher shop in it. Most families ran out of home-butchered meat by the end of winter. Business was brisk for a time, but Charles sold the business at summer's end since people would be doing their own butchering again as soon as cold weather set in. With winter approaching, he hired out his carpentry skills to Mr. Masters, who was erecting a new store building next to his hotel, with a meeting hall on the second floor.\n\nAlthough he still lacked a steady source of income, Charles Ingalls was not without respect in the community. He was elected as a trustee of the Union Congregational church. In the winter of 1879, when a Good Templars unit formed in Walnut Grove, he and Caroline joined. The following March he was elected justice of the peace in the first election ever held in the town, capturing twenty-three out of the twenty-nine votes that were cast. He used the front room of their house for an office, listening to the cases that were brought in to him. When this happened, Caroline would shoo the girls into the kitchen, but they eagerly listened through the door to hear what was going on in the next room. Laura learned something more about greed and treachery in some of these proceedings. There was, for example, the case of a woman who obtained revenge on her sister for having married the man she loved by tricking her out of property back in New York State.\n\nEven church took on a different color in the mind of the eleven year old. Religious revivals enlivened Walnut Grove as they did in towns all over America, but Laura felt uncomfortable listening to people publicly testify about their personal beliefs. It violated her sense of privacy. If she was more reticent than some people, however, she did not resist going to church and Sunday school every week at the Congregational church. When the opportunity arose, she topped that by attending Methodist services and Sunday school in the afternoon. The church was conducting a contest to see who could memorize the most Bible verses (called Golden Texts and Central Truths), and Laura tied for the top prize, winning a reference Bible for her efforts.\n\nHow long the family would have stayed in Walnut Grove had not a new opportunity arisen is hard to say. People continued to move into the area, economic activity began to pick up, and the frontier pushed ever farther west. During the five years after 1875 the population of Redwood County jumped from 2,982 to 5,375. Charles Ingalls probably would have obtained another plot of land and tried his hand at farming again soon, but a new possibility emerged when his sister Ladocia unexpectedly came through town one day and made him a tempting offer."
