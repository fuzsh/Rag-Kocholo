        "text": "Little House on the Prairie is one of the most beloved TV shows of all time. The series premiered September 11, 1974, and ended after nine seasons on May 10, 1982. In 1982-1983, the spin-off Little House: A New Beginning aired, absent lead characters Michael Landon and Karen Grassle.\n\nThe show followed the adventures of Laura Ingalls and her family, who lived in the small town of Walnut Grove, Minnesota, in the 1870s-1890s. It was an adaptation of Laura Ingalls Wilder’s best-selling series of Little House books.\n\nThe series has aired so many times that most Americans can name at least one of the stars or cite some of the well-known characters.\n\nAs Seen on TV\n\nFamily researchers know all too well that family stories are sometimes exaggerated, adapted to make a point, inaccurate or simply not the truth. Well the same is true with Little House on the Prairie, after-all, it was just a television show.\n\nIf you’ve enjoyed the series, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between facts and stories simply produced for television. Not everything is “as seen on TV.”\n\nThe series explored many different storylines —faith, adoption, blindness, drug addiction and alcoholism, poverty, child abuse, prejudice, and many other themes. In doing so, dozens of cast members and guest stars were introduced to viewers.\n\nSome actors were well-known, like Ernest Borgnine, Burl Ives, and Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Special appearances also included many who played roles in other westerns. Then there were cast members who went on to become famous actors, like Jason Bateman and Shannen Doherty.\n\nA number of actors played the role of an Ingalls or Wilder relative. But playing a role on TV and actually being a relative from a genealogy perspective is where fiction and reality were blurred.\n\nIngalls & Wilder Connections\n\nFamily researchers and genealogists are by their very nature curious individuals. They enjoy the challenge of a good puzzle and are thrilled when the pieces come together. So invigorated, fans of the series have created thousands of Laura and Charles Ingalls family trees on popular genealogy sites.\n\nWhile some trees were created to explore the possibility of a genuine connection to the Ingalls or Wilder families; the majority were simply generated by curious fans.\n\nIf you have tried to create a tree for the Ingalls or Wilder families, or perhaps for one of the other families featured in the series – Oleson, Garvey, Carter, Edwards, Baker, you were likely met with some genealogical challenges.\n\nAccording to Laura Wilder’s memoir, Pioneer Girl, the Ingalls family thought their daughter, Mary, at age 14, lost her sight because of scarlet fever. But they were never sure. They also pondered whether it could have been the measles, a stroke or other medical event.\n\nWas there a Nellie Oleson?\n\nWhat about Nellie Oleson, surely there was a real person named Nellie in Walnut Grove. Laura Ingalls Wilder did a masterful job of creating the character of Nellie Oleson, as well as others who were portrayed in her books in a somewhat negative light. Ready for another shocker – Nellie wasn’t a real person either. Instead, she was a composite of three girls Laura knew from childhood, Nellie Owens, Genevieve Masters, and Estella Gilbert.\n\nWell, I better stop here. If you are a fan of the show you might be feeling a bit disappointed. But don’t despair, there were real Ingalls and Wilder families and you may still be a distant relative. So keep enjoying the search for answers.\n\nStarting an Ingalls Tree\n\nRelated"
