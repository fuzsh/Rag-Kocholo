        "text": "Hello dear friends! Recently a picture has been circulating of the author Laura Ingalls Wilder which many of you have sent to me. It truly is a charming photograph. I decided to write a post with all of the homes of Laura Ingalls Wilder listed.\n\nThe photo below is indeed Laura. She is standing on the porch of the Mansfield home that was first rented, then purchased, by Almanzo’s parents. They lived here while saving money to build what would become Rocky Ridge Farm. The house still stands today.\n\nThe Homes of Laura Ingalls Wilder\n\nThis post will provide a bit more information about each of the homes that Laura lived in. Some are original and some have been recreated in the style of the time.\n\nHere is an overall map of the homes that will be shared.\n\nCharles and Caroline Ingalls moved to the big woods of Wisconsin in 1863.\n\nLittle House in the Big Woods\n\nLaura Elizabeth Ingalls was born on February 7, 1867 in the big woods of Pepin County, Wisconsin. She was named after her father’s mother, Laura Colby Ingalls. (This is also the Laura that I was named for. My great-great grandfather, Lansford “James” Ingalls, and Charles were brothers.)\n\nA replica of the cabin where the Ingalls family lived has been built. This was the setting for “Little House in the Big Woods”.\n\nI first saw the site when I was eleven years old. My grandfather, Roy A. Ingalls and my great aunt, Dorothy Ingalls Farrell, were sharing our family history with me. They had to console me initially as I was a bit devastated to discover that the cabin was no longer surrounded by big woods. I went on to have a lovely afternoon collecting water from the outdoor hand pump among other activities.\n\nThe Pepin cabin is open every day year round. Admission is free, however, there are no lights at the site. The address is N3228 Cty CC, Stockholm, WI 54769\n\nThere is also a Laura Ingalls Wilder museum located at 306 3rd St., in the town of Pepin. The Museum is open 10 AM – 5 PM daily from May 13th – Oct 16th.\n\nLittle House on the Prairie\n\nWhile Laura was a baby the family moved to a farm in Keytesville, Missouri for about a year. There is no home site here.\n\nFrom there the family moved to prairie land 13 miles outside of Independence, Kansas in 1869.\n\nA replica of the cabin has been built. This site is the setting for “Little House on the Prairie”.\n\nThe cabin is open six days a week in April through September and Friday through Sunday in October. The hours are Tuesday – Saturday: 10 AM – 5 PM and Sundays: 1-5 PM. Admission is $3 for adults and $1 for children under the age of 18.\n\nIt is located south of Highway 75, 13 miles southwest of Independence, Kansas 67301.\n\nYou can find additional information on the website.\n\nOn The Banks Of Plum Creek\n\nAfter just two years the Ingalls discovered that the Kansas land that they were living on belonged to the Osage Indians. They returned to the little cabin in the big woods of Wisconsin and lived there for another three years.\n\nIn 1874 they sold their big woods farm and moved to Walnut Grove, Minnesota. They lived for a few months in an abandoned cabin and then moved to a farm located on the banks of Plum Creek.\n\nThe dugout (also known as a sod house) is no longer standing but a replica has been made on the museum site. The Laura Ingalls Wilder Museum has a very nice collection of artifacts and memorabilia. It has various opening hours which you can find HERE. Admission is as follows: ages 4 & under, free, 5-12, $ 4.00 and 13 & over, $ 7.00.\n\nThe museum is located at 330 8th Street Walnut Grove, MN 56180.\n\nBurr Oak, Iowa\n\nAfter three consecutive crop failures, the Ingalls family left Walnut Grove in 1876. They had considerable debt and moved to Burr Oak, Iowa to help the Steadman’s operate the Masters Hotel. It was a very difficult time for the family and Laura never wrote about it in any of the “Little House” books.\n\nThe Master’s Hotel is the only childhood home of Laura’s that remains on its original site. It is registered on the National Register of Historic Places. The museum is located at 3603 236th Ave. Burr Oak, Iowa 52101\n\nAfter a year in Iowa, the family returned to Walnut Grove. They lived in town and it was during this time that Mary went blind. This photo of Carrie, Mary (seated) and Laura was taken around 1880.\n\nBy The Shores Of Silver Lake\n\nAfter falling into debt once again Charles became a bookkeeper for the Dakota Central Railroad. The family moved to what would become the little town of De Smet, South Dakota.\n\nLaura would live here for thirteen years and she wrote about this time in “By the Shores of Silver Lake”, “The Long Winter”, and “Little Town on the Prairie”.\n\nThere are several sites in the area. This is the surveyor’s house:\n\nLittle Town On The Prairie\n\nYou can also visit Ma and Pa’s house in town.\n\nThe museum operating hours and location can be found on the Discover Laura site.\n\nYou can visit the homestead which has been recreated on the outskirts of town on the original land. It offers several activities and is located at 20812 Homestead Rd De Smet, SD 57231.\n\nThese Happy Golden Years\n\nThe stories of her life with Almanzo, whom she married in 1885, continued. The books were “These Happy Golden Years” and “The First Four Years”.\n\nLife was not easy for Almanzo and Laura. Their home burned to the ground in 1889, their infant son died and Almanzo’s health suffered as a result of diphtheria. The couple moved with their daughter, Rose, first to Spring Valley, Minnesota. There is no home site here.\n\nAbout a year later they moved to New Hope, Florida in the hopes that the warm climate would help Almanzo. They stayed with Laura’s cousin, Peter Franklin Ingalls, and his wife Mary. But they would return to De Smet within a year.\n\nRocky Ridge Farm\n\nIn August of 1894, they left De Smet and traveled 650 miles to Mansfield, Missouri in a covered wagon pulled by two horses. The journey took six weeks. The wagon contained some furniture and a stray dog named Fido that Laura adopted somewhere in Kansas. Their entire life savings, in the form of a $100 bill, was hidden in Laura’s lap desk that rarely left her side during the journey. With the $100 they bought a piece of land that they named Rocky Ridge.\n\nLaura at the Rocky Ridge Ravine around 1900.\n\nThey lived in a rented house in town for several years while they cleared the land and planted hundreds of apple trees. Laura also raised hens.\n\nEventually, Almanzo was able to build a one-room cabin on the site of their farm.\n\nAfter saving for nearly 20 years they were able to start building the house we know to be Rocky Ridge in 1913. Almanzo customized the kitchen to fit Laura’s tiny 4’11” stature.\n\nThe house was furnished simply but comfortably.\n\nThe Rock House\n\nThe Wilder’s daughter, Rose, was also a famous author in her own right. She was once the highest paid female journalist of her time. Rose used some of her royalties to build her parents what would become known as “The Rock House” as a Christmas gift. Laura and Almanzo lived here from 1928 until 1936.\n\nIt was in the Rock House that Laura’s hand wrote the first four books in the “Little House” series.\n\nThe design of the Rock House came from plans out of the Sears Modern Homes catalog. Rose had the house built using local materials and not pre-cut materials delivered from Sears. Rose wanted a stone exterior versus the standard of wood shingles. It was estimated that it cost over $11,000 to build as the interior was also customized with all of the modern conveniences available in the 1920’s.\n\nIn 1936 Rose moved to Connecticut and the Wilders decided to move back to their beloved farmhouse. The Wilders sold the Rock House and the adjoining 40 acres to a neighbor. Today it is a museum.\n\nAlmanzo, Laura, and Nero the dog in front of the Rock House.\n\nThe Rocky Ridge farmhouse is also now a museum.\n\nLaura’s Later Days\n\nThe couple lived very simply in the farmhouse until their deaths. Almanzo passed on in 1949 at the age of 92 and Laura died in 1957 at the age of 93.\n\nThe new Laura Ingalls Wilder library and museum has just recently opened. It contains Wilder’s original handwritten manuscripts, her desk, type-writer and Pa’s fiddle.\n\nIt is located at 3068 Highway A Mansfield, Missouri 65704.\n\nFarmer Boy\n\nIn addition to the sites where Laura lived, you can also visit Almanzo’s boyhood home at 177 Stacy Rd in Malone, NY 12953.\n\nI have had the privilege of visiting all of the sites with the exception of the Masters Hotel in Iowa and of course the newest library which just opened this past March. All of the sites are run by generous volunteers and/or dedicated workers. I offer my many thanks and deepest appreciation to all for keeping the “Little House” books and Laura’s legacy alive.\n\nA bit of fun trivia~\n\n“Home is the nicest word there is.”\n\nThis fairly famous quote was never actually said by Laura the writer. It was said in Season 1, Episode 1 of the television show “Little House On The Prairie”. I still love it all the same.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed Laura’s homes.\n\nLaura Ingalls Gunn\n\nYou might also enjoy:\n\nBecoming Laura."
