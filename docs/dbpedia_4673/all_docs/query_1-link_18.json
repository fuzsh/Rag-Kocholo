        "text": "German singer-songwriter-producer Philine Sonny and Los Angeles artist Miya Folick join forces in an absorbing new single, “Shame,” out today. This dynamic collaboration between two emerging talents showcases a seamless blend of voices and vibes, delivering an enthralling and fervently charged listening experience with a powerful message about gender and societal norms.\n\nPhiline Sonny, known for her honest and vulnerable demeanor in her music, expresses admiration for Miya Folick’s ability to convey rage in a loud yet vulnerable manner. “Shame” is a deeply intimate song for Sonny, who emphasizes Folick’s voice and presence as the perfect addition to the track. “Miya really helped me get my frustration across and supported me in my message as I think she understood the kind of deeply rooted feeling that comes with not being a cis-man in this world,” shares Sonny.\n\nMiya Folick reveals, “When Philine sent me this song, I was struck first by her production. The way the drums entered was so emotional and exciting to me. I also appreciated the nontraditional form of the song. It’s like a stream of consciousness–a torrent of rage. I really related to the emotions that Philine conveys in ‘Shame,’ and I was honored to get to sing (and scream) on it.”\n\nPhiline Sonny just performed at The Great Escape festival in the UK and recently wrapped up her own headline tour in Europe. Miya Folick is coming off several sold-out dates supporting Mitski and The Japanese House. She can be seen next opening for The Japanese House in June and performing at Seattle’s Day In Day Out Festival and Portland’s Project Pabst festival. Full list of summer shows here. Additionally, Folick’s score for the film Cora Bora, will finally be heard by audiences across the country when the film sees its wide release on June 14th. Both artists are currently working on new music."
