        "text": "She was born in 1955 to an unmarried couple — a relationship status that was shameful and taboo in Irish Catholic Boston at the time. When she was a baby, her mother needed time to prepare for parenthood and sent my mother to live with family in Nova Scotia. When my grandmother eventually married another man a few years later, she went to retrieve her.\n\nMy mother described suffering severe emotional and physical abuse at the hands of her alcoholic stepfather, a man she was raised to believe was her biological father. Despite her hardships, she took refuge in reading, writing, and listening to folk music. As a teenager, she worked to pay her own tuition at a private high school.\n\nShe often said that education helped her to survive and to see beyond her difficult environment.\n\nMy father, a lifelong alcoholic, abandoned our family when I was 3 weeks old. Being left to care for two young children alone caused my mother an incredible amount of stress and anguish. She also faced additional social obstacles as a woman, a poor person, and as a single mother. Luckily, our extended family and friends helped us during that time. Despite us being poor and on welfare, we always had food and shelter and our material needs were met.\n\nMy mother excelled at ensuring my sister and I received a good education. She worked hard to make sure we got into good schools, despite our poverty. Education was her liberation from her own traumatic childhood, and she wanted it to be ours too.\n\nDespite her strengths, my mother’s mental health issues often got in the way of her ability to maintain stable relationships. She struggled with borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. She was abusive to her children and grandchildren in many ways. Oftentimes, she’d explode in rage, completely cutting people out of her life for long stretches of time. Or she’d romanticize a person, place, or thing and then denounce it soon after. She couldn’t manage money and declared bankruptcy several times. These things are common for a complex trauma survivor. And since she was not shown secure love as a child, she didn’t know how to healthily parent my sister or me.\n\nI’d like to say I was shocked when I found out that my mother died by suicide, but I wasn’t. She had two major near-fatal suicide attempts in the last 25 years. Both times, she told my sister and me it was our fault. After each attempt, we would visit her in hospitals and psychiatric wards and work with her care team, encouraging her to engage in their aftercare treatment plan. But once out of the hospital, she’d cease her treatment. She would often threaten or suggest self harm when she was mad at us.\n\nOne of her major suicide attempts happened when I was 20 years old; we needed the fire department to break into the apartment she locked herself in. That time, we narrowly saved her, and it was the first time I read one of her suicide notes. Recently, I read her final one.\n\nWhen we got things from my mother’s apartment after she died, I was given a sealed box that she labeled for me. Enclosed was every journal she kept throughout her life. I read through most of her entries and found that she was always depressed and suicidal. Her first serious suicide attempt was when she was 14 years old, shortly after she found out that her abusive stepfather was not her biological father. She even went so far as to write — 30 years ago — that she had “no doubt” that her life would end by suicide.\n\nMy mother tried to keep up appearances outside of our family and often people did not see her abusive sides. I fully accept that some people knew a different person than I knew. I do not seek to take anything away from anyone who had only good experiences with her. I also cherish the good experiences I had with her.\n\nHer shortcomings never kept me from loving her. But my empathy could not extend to fully sacrificing my mental health.\n\nFive years ago, I chose to cease contact with my mother because I couldn’t navigate a relationship with her without dangerously dissociating — something I couldn’t afford to do as a new parent, trauma survivor, and person in recovery from addiction.\n\nWhen a child deliberately distances themself from a parent, people are often confused and judgmental. This is especially true if, like me, you’re from an Irish Catholic background — a culture where you don’t talk about emotions and you stay in toxic relationships, no matter what. Recently, one of my uncles tried to get me to change my mother’s published obituary because he was embarrassed that she was born to a different father than the rest of her siblings. I refused. Later, he told me and my sister, “Your mother died of a broken heart. I blame both of you.”\n\nI actively try to buck the toxic tradition of family secrets and shame. After many years of therapy and working with other trauma survivors, I’ve learned that children don’t separate from their parents unless they’ve tried every other recourse to fix the relationship; this certainly was my experience.\n\nDespite all the hardship and distance between my mom and me, I’m proud of all she persevered through. By always championing the power of education, she gave me the tools to find my own liberation. The tragic irony is that the very path of liberation she sought for me was the path that eventually separated us.\n\nThe decision to separate from a parent is a tortured one; we make it carefully, and we are often empathetic about the plight of our abusers. Adults who estrange themselves from an abusive parent deserve the same grace and understanding that a survivor of intimate partner abuse is often granted. Only then will we be able to come out of the shadows and build a public community, dedicated to eliminating toxic generational patterns."
