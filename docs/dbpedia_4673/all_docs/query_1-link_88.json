        "text": "Lead singer of Sugar Ray will appear with Bret Michaels in Melbourne.\n\nMark McGrath, lead singer of '90s pop phenomenon Sugar Ray, will appear as a special guest with Bret Michaels on Friday night at the King Center in Melbourne. Sugar Ray, known for hits such as \"Fly,\" \"Every Morning,\" \"Someday\" and \"When It’s Over,\" has sold more than 10 million records worldwide and continues to tour successfully today.\n\nI spoke with Mark about his career, his future and about being a father to two children. So let’s “Shake, Rattle & Know”: Mark McGrath\n\nQUESTION: I recently read about your involvement in Little League baseball, so as one Little League coach to another, how much fun do you have coaching?\n\nANSWER: I am having so much fun. I am an assistant coach for my 5-year-old son’s team, so it’s all about mechanics and strategies, and it is so fun. At this age things change so much, too — the difference between a 5-year-old player and a 6-year-old player are huge; it is like night and day. Some can catch and play first base and some can even turn double plays, and the skill levels are all over the place. Of course, to me, my son is the greatest player out there but maybe no one else sees it that way. I am just glad to help accelerate their learning process and fortunate to have this opportunity to develop them. At this age, he isn’t playing year-round ball, so we have time to enjoy it.\n\nQ: Musically, will you release new material as a solo artist or as Sugar Ray?\n\nA: Over the summer I released an EP called \"Summertime’s Coming.\" I had no label and did it just for fun. It was a solo project, but it sounds like a Sugar Ray record would sound. I did it all by myself and feel I gave the audience something they would want to hear. It was a self-financed project, and I was able to make a little money off of it. I think I will release a few songs every six months and not pressure myself to make music. The music business has changed a lot and I will perform a lot more than I record. I always like to have that outlet to create something, and release it just for the joy of making music. I am not doing music for the commerce of it, but I have been pleased with the results.\n\nQ: Is it hard to balance life on the road, your TV obligations and being a parent?\n\nA: It is more difficult in the summer when I am touring more. We did the \"Under the Sun\" tour with a lot of bands form the '90s and played a lot of great theaters. It is great that individually we (the band) might not be able to even get into some of the theaters and venues we were playing if on our own, but collectively we can sell these places out. As my kids get older it will be even harder, though. My son and daughter are my very best friends. I thank God for Facetime when I am on the road. I am fortunate to have a wife of 21 years that I have lived the ups and downs with and knows what this business is like. I am actually home a lot, though. In baseball I am always the assistant coach, never the head coach since my time wouldn’t allow for that. I am home a lot more than I ever was before, so that’s good.\n\nQ: At the height of your popularity there was a lot of focus on your looks and your image. Do you feel this ever took away from the merits of your music?\n\nA: I am sure that it did to some degree. And I am sure some wanted to brand us as a one-hit wonder despite our success. We wrote great songs and those songs are still popular with audiences today. I can guarantee you the people coming to see our shows now aren’t coming to see me take my shirt off anymore. We wrote six Top 40 songs that withstood the test of time. We were a band first and foremost, and we came up the hard way. We wrote our own music and busted our butts. I am sure image helped us because there was a visual to go along with it, but now people come see us because of the music and we were a part of people’s life landscape.\n\nQ: You have written songs for other artists, but has there ever been a song you wrote for someone that you wished you had kept for yourself?\n\nA: No, not really. I am more of a collaborative songwriter. Even in the '90s we weren’t songwriters. We told our record label we had 40 songs when we really only had 4 just to get a deal. Back then labels were scooping everyone up, but we had to look like we had a bigger footprint than we did.\n\nQ: Now that you mention record labels and how different things are now, do you think the music business is better off or worse than it was before?\n\nA: You know it has changed, but all I can say is that the good thing is everyone can do it now; the bad thing is everyone can do it now. People aren’t plugged into the bands anymore. With everyone making records and releasing them everywhere it’s hard to follow anyone. Bands from the '90s are still going strong and still selling out shows because record labels aren’t making new bands anymore. Pollstar shows the biggest selling tours are bands from the '90s when the record labels were still going strong. We never ended our run. There is no industry anymore and no way to receive music anymore. People used to go buy a record because they wanted something tangible, they wanted to see it, feel it, touch it and play it. Now they download a song off the Internet and might forget they had it until they are going down the street and have their device on shuffle and the song comes on. I miss the tangible side of the business and it’s a real art that seems gone. People like nostalgia — that is not a bad thing. I will take nostalgia all day long. People have gotten so picky now when U2 gave away their album for free people were like, “how dare you invade my iPod.” People were mad they got a free record. Back in the day if U2 gave away a free record there would be people lined up around the block for it, but that is where our delivery systems have gone now. It is not the same.\n\nQ: What was your most embarrassing onstage moment?\n\nA: I have had times where I had too much to drink, but I don’t remember any of those because, well, I was drunk (laughing). Personally the worst was when we got to open for KISS in 1995. They had just started putting the makeup on so it was a very big deal and they were nice enough to let a lot of up-and-coming bands open for them. It is funny because Paul Stanley’s daughter and my daughter did a ballet together, and there we are in the audience and it was all a little surreal. Anyway, I was doing this show with them in Seattle and was battling laryngitis. I was taking medicine because back then they didn’t have steroid shots and stuff you could take, and was determined to make this show. Back then we were a lot harder band than people remember ... so I was determined the first note would be this real guttural yell and when I did, I thought I had farted on the stage but realized I had actually pooped myself. I exploded in my pants on the first note and had 44 minutes left to do. I have a picture of me with Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley right after the performance and they both have a look on their face like, “Good Lord, what is that smell?” So, that would be it, are you sorry you asked? (laughing)\n\nQ: You are doing this show with Bret Michaels in Melbourne, but do you plan to do more \"Under the Sun\" tours?\n\nA: Yes, Melbourne is a one-off for me (one show). Bret asked me if I would come play with his band and I couldn’t say no. It will be the first time we have done something like this. I will be playing with Bret’s band, and it’s a one-time thing. Bret is the real deal and one of the classiest people in this business; it doesn’t get much better than Bret. The \"Under the Sun\" tour will go on forever, it is something I just love to do. I like to celebrate music and help make memories.\n\nIf you have an artist/band you’d like to recommend for review, contact Nunez at srkmusic@cfl.rr.com or follow Mike on Twitter: @srkmusicflorida\n\n------\n\nThe details\n\nWho: Bret Michaels with special guest Mark McGrath\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Friday\n\nWhere: King Center, 3865 N.
