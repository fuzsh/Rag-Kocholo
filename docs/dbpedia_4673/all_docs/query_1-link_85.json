        "text": "We’ve got another great interview today. An entrepreneur, actor, musician, singer-songwriter, and music executive...hip-hop artist Lecrae joins me in a personal conversation about shame and grief. We get really honest about his life, where he came from, what influenced his Threeness, a real identity crisis that he hit at the height of his fame, and what role therapy has played in his healing and restoration.\n\nLecrae is an American Christian hip hop recording artist, songwriter, music executive, actor, and entrepreneur. He is the president, co-owner and co-founder of the independent record label Reach Records, and was the co-founder and president of the now-defunct non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries. To date, he has released ten studio albums and three mixtapes as a solo artist, and has released three studio albums, a remix album, one EP, and numerous singles as the leader of the hip hop group 116 Clique. He produced much of his earlier material along with other early Reach Records releases. Lecrae, in reference to his label as a Christian rapper, has stated that his music is just hip hop, though it reflects his Christian faith.\n\nCONNECT WITH IAN\n\nInstagramTwitterFacebook\n\nCONNECT WITH LECRAE\n\nFacebookInstagramI Am Restored: How I Lost My Religion\n\nbut Found My FaithYouTube\n\nSPONSORS"
