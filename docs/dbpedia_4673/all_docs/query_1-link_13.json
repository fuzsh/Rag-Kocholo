Why has it been so long since I played it?\"\n\nList them here.\n\nHere's what got me started thinking about this:\n\nSurprised? Disappointed? Laughing?\n\nWell, it's quite a good album. Two great songs, IMO. The rest are pretty good, maybe one filler - which is pleasant enough and not terrible. One would be good if Paul hadn't thought he should let Linda sing lead (ugh! - and ironically it's called \"I Am Your Singer\"). But the playing and singing are otherwise good, and the recording is pretty basic for the most part and sounds good. It's fun to listen to.\n\nBrinsley Schwarz (1970)\n\nAlthough labeled as a British pub rock band, the group saw themselves as a folk-rock band with psychedelic pretentions. This, their eponymous first album, is, in fact, comprised entirely of country-inflected rock/pop ballads, and I think it's great.\n\nTheir first American performance was as the opening act for for Van Morrison and Quicksilver at the Fillmore East in NYC, in April, 1970. It did not go well, and and the band received a flood of negative press over the following weeks, including bad reviews of this record. However, they released five more albums over the next four years to much more postive reviews before the group dispanded, and bass player Nick Lowe went on to an illustrious career, first with Dave Edmunds and Rockpile, then as a solo artist/songwriter/producer.\n\nGuitarist Brinsley Schwarz and keyboardist Bob Andrews remained together as members of The Rumour, who were known primarily as Graham Parker's backing band. I saw them play about a year ago on their reunion tour, and they were great.\n\nThe Notting Hillbillies: Missing ... Presumed Having A Good Time\n\nAt the time this came out, I just started my life in Hifi, and really like Dire Straits (still like them somehow).\n\nHowever, Mark Knopfler's excursion into Country remained just that, country. And well, that's actually not my cup of tea in general.\n\nThat said, both Bewildered and Your Own Sweet Way are very enjoyable."
