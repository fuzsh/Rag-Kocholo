        "text": "what are some bands or artists you are embarrassed to like? Although i mainly like 70s prog rock, i am embarrassed to say i like new kids on the block\n\nI donâ€™t have a band In particular, but I have a playlist of individual tracks called guilty secrets on my iTunes. It includes things like Let the music play (Shannon) and Viva Forever (Spice Girls).\n\nIf you like what you like, be proud of it.\n\nDon't let those 'too cool for school' types get you down.\n\nA \"friend\" said it \"gives him a corny feeling\" that I like Judy Garland.\n\nSo obviously he was somewhat embarrassed.\n\nBut I certainly wasn't.\n\nFor a long time (circa '80s) The Carpenters and The Monkees were deemed uncool by most of my friends.\n\nI didn't give a $hit -- good is good.\n\nI don't tell tons of people how much I love Barry Manilow's \"Mandy\", however\n\n.\n\nThere isn't much I don't listen to, if anything. Sure I like some stuff more than other stuff, but i am definitely not embarrassed about any of it.\n\nIt doesn't matter what you like or dislike, there is a group of folks who will think it is lame, and a group of folks that will think it is cool....\n\nI have never cared about being cool, life's too short\n\nIt's kinda funny how hated Manilow and Bolton and all those guys are ... what a waste of energy... I don't think i have ever bought anything by either of them, but they both had songs I thought were pretty good\n\nWhen I was at school in the 80s, I was embarrassed that my tastes were mainly 60s inspired...Beatles, Kinks, The Who etc . Then 10 years later, Britpop happened and suddenly everyone was into that stuff and so I was proved right. And I could have a Beatles mop haircut if I wanted to and not feel silly.\n\nNone.\n\nI did for a bit, but once you're older than 17 it's easy to go from Renaissance to REM to Genesis to OMD to Klaus Schulze to... you get the idea."
