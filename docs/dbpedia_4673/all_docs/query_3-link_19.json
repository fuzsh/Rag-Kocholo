        "text": "(Images not included)\n\nIntroduction to Artification and Orientalism:\n\nOne of the most visible trends in the fashion industry is working with Asian designers partly because of the way collections have been received, often with an emphasis on Japanese designers and artists. The narrative and historical context of the crafts from Asia is interesting because of the way orientalism is often romanticized as art. When we look historically in the early 20th century, fashion becomes a way to differentiate oneself and in doing so, was an industry that found novelty in the idea of the “other.” The “other” brings about a certain form of newness that often used techniques and ideas that were not seen in the leading European fashion capitals at that time. As fashion discourse was largely Euro-centric at the time, the coutourier Paul Poiret and his peers often looked to Asia and the “orient” — a broad construct — for finding inspiration. Call it either appropriation or appreciation, introducing foreign novelty has been a recurring theme in fashion since then.\n\nIn our contemporary world, many Japanese designers as an artistic group have been well received and often are used as standout examples of how talent from non-European countries can succeed in the fashion industry. Fashion often is tied to a geographical origin, with Rei Kawakubo, Kenzo, Takashi Murakami, and Yoji Yamamoto, and Yayoi Kusama, often mentioned as artists and designer groups who were subject to orientalist artification. Oriental artification, in this paper, seeks to combine the theory of orientalism and artification. One of the reasons why is that through fashion patterns and created discourses, we see that there is a fetishization of Asian artists within fashion. In creating fashion and in understanding the fashion system, it is important to look backwards at these historical contexts which gave rise to the oriental artification happening now, with the art system often an institution used to fetishize art, and the “other,” and the new. In this paper, the intersectionalities and the interrelationship between fashion and art will also be looked upon.\n\nLuxury fashion houses use art product collaborations, connotations to art, and associations to art to market their products because they want to differentiate their products and improve their branding. By working with artists, fashion brands can create and develop new and innovative designs to attract a broader and more contemporary audience, while still maintaining their brand reputation. The preservation of a brand reputation and appearance is vital, but also important to adopt the artist’s values to acquire a larger customer base and attain a more sophisticated audience.[1] The process of artification consists of a positioning strategy with a purpose of universality, aimed at providing luxury brands with enhanced legitimacy, reputation, and differentiation, and in this case, specifically tied to the idea of the orient. Artification as a concept transforms products not traditionally deemed as art into art, and in collaborations with Japanese artists, often intertwines with the idea of orientalism. [2][3]\n\nEdward Said writes that European discourse has a fascination with the orient as a “place of romance, exotic beings, haunting memories and landscapes, and remarkable experiences.”[4] This is a discourse that is helpful to understand cultural appropriation. Orientalism and the Westernization of Japan followed historically during the beginning of trade relations, when countries began to trade in the 19th century. It is important to note that the orientalist gaze that permeated Europe’s fascination with Japan differed in some ways from that discussed in Edward Said’s Orientalism. Said writes in his last chapter that the “’Orient’ is itself a constituted entity, and the notion that there are geographical spaces of indigenous, radically ‘different’ inhabitants who can be defined in the bases of some religion, culture, or racial essence proper to that geographical space is equally a highly debatable idea.”[5]\n\nWhen applied to Japan, orientalism transitioned to Japonisme, with many elements such as architectural angles, straight cutting, and kimonos and other “native” clothing being widely popular when taken from the local setting and applied into European fashion. Interestingly, Japan was not colonized but instead a colonizer itself; starting in 1895, Japan sacked its neighboring countries, brutally conquering areas in Korea and China. Japan’s lack of natural resources and ubiquitous military prowess made it undesirable for conquest, and Europeans did not actively participated in the “dominating, restructuring, and having authority over the Orient” in Japan, actions that Said understands as a vital component for the study of Orientalism.[6] Perhaps the fascination with Japanese artists then stems from this position of both power and ambiguous romanticization. According to Said, the Orient is a “semi-mythical construct” imposed on a set of countries east of Europe although the term has been mostly used to describe countries in East and South Asia.[7] Said argues that the desire to understand a different culture than our own in order to co-exist with it too often happened and resulted in years of colonization, arbitrary drawing of frontiers and the over-simplification of a multitude of civilizations and cultures under one stereotypical denomination: The Orient. With this idea, many varying cultures are collapsed into a single entity often romanticized and inaccurate.\n\nThis paper seeks to build on the artification theory as it applies to Edward Said’s theory of orientalism — which is that art forms, artists, and cultural symbols of the orient, particularly in Japan, are consistently being appropriated into European luxury products, often with defining qualities such as hyper-sexualization, novelty, and non-European qualities. The allure of Japanese style became a coveted inspiration for aesthetic art and design.[8]\n\nHistorical Context Japonisme and Orientalism in Fashion\n\nWhen Paul Poiret was designing his in the 19th century, modernity for him was often about the non-European experience.[9] In removing the corset and looking to Asian fashion as an example of increased movement — such as Chinese traditional clothing and Japanese kimonos, we see how ideas from these 2 nations primarily influenced Parisian tastes and designs. A large part of the spread of Japonisme — coined in 1867 when Japan opens its products to the rest of the world, was a function of economic production and an ability to trade across international borders. Some of the ways in which this type of clothing was characterized by is having a soft and sleek body and transparent stockings, which were different from the tighter European corsets at the time.[10]\n\nPoiret’s interest in the “Far East” was found to be used in Harper’s Bazaar as an inclusive term which could indicate Chinese, Japanese, or both. He loved how women looked in vivid colors and oriental lines, which was seen as “vogue” or “avant-garde” for European audiences at the time. Poiret was also inspired by the Ballet Russe, an itinerant ballet company begun in Paris that performed between 1909 and 1929 throughout Europe, which had oriental styles of work similar to the set and costume design of the performance. Because Poiret had never traveled to Asia, he created “a galaxy of fantasies.”[11]\n\nPoiret had an affinity with all things “Eastern,” claiming to have been a Persian prince in a previous life. Significantly, the first Asian­inspired piece he ever designed, while still at Worth, was controversial. A simple Chinese­style cloak called Confucius, it offended the occidental sensibilities of an important client, a Russian princess. To her grand eyes it seemed shockingly simple, the kind of thing a peasant might wear; when Poiret opened his own establishment such mandarin robe style cloaks would be best­sellers.[12] For Poiret, he was influenced by the Orient in his application of geometric style choices, favoring clothing cut along straight lines and constructed from rectangles. This structural simplicity represented a crucial moment in the emergence of Modernism and established a new paradigm of fashion at that time.[13] We will see similar themes in simplicity with the Japanese artists investigated later. Overall, Poiret’s intent in using orientalism can be found in his primary sources such as his evening dress, shoes, turban, shawl (1912), autobiography (1930) and magazines (American Vogue Feb 1920, Sep 1920). His new styles and colors, which were largely influenced by the orient, were successfully commercially and helped to define the fashion in his period.[14]\n\nIn Britain, similar obsessions with orientialism as it tied to fashion occurred in the late 19th century. Japanese representation in art and design brought about an age when, according to a reporter at a 1878 international exhibition in Paris, “even the greatest mistresses of European crafts lay down their weapons in shame.” women’s fashions were able to transcend national borders through the development of Japanese designs, Orientalist ideals, and the importance of the body. Eastern eroticism was heightened through British designers, as seen in the development of the Western kimono. From Fetish to Fashion focuses on how the relationship between the state and culture can be established by an unexpected medium: women’s fashion.[15]\n\nBritish women’s fashion designers of the second half of the nineteenth century accessed themes of Japanese design following the opening of Japan to foreign trade. It also examines the nexus of state politics and culture in an Orientalist frame, exposing the relationship of Japanese trade and the rising fascination with Japanese culture. By incorporating traditional Japanese motifs of naturalism and the symbolism of the geisha seen in exhibitions and expositions, designers were able to produce a new genre of fashion that would influence the relationship between Britain and Japan leading up to the twentieth century. Japonisme in fashion ushered in a wave of Orientalism toward Japan, creating a cultural fascination that would grow into a unique form of cultural appropriation.\n\nFashion has a unique quality in which it is able to be manipulated for a certain purpose, whether for interpersonal persuasion, manifestation of a popular culture, or validation of an artistic expression. Art and design undoubtedly have similar traits, but fashion combines the two in a distinct way, allowing for individual expression and representation of a larger culture.[16] Unlike art and design, fashion could be marketed and traded in such a way that reflected the power of the producer and the inspirations and desires of the consumer, making it an ideal medium in which capitalism and Orientalism intersect.[17] British fashion that incorporated Japanese motifs eventually transformed from a solely economic commodity to an artistic one, further ingraining Japonisme into British culture. Second, fashion is an exemplary method of examining the importance of the body. As Elizabeth Grosz discusses in her essay, “Bodies of Knowledges: Feminism and the Crisis of Reason,” clothing and fashion play an instrumental role in discussing social and cultural indicators, “binding individuals to systems of significance in which they become signs to be read by others and themselves.”[18] Clothing is indicative not only of social class, but also of individual preferences inspired by one’s surroundings. For these reasons, fashion in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries can be seen as an economic and cultural tapestry, one that can be easily interrogated to expose an Orientalist frame.[19]\n\nArtification Theory: Turning Narratives of the Exotic into Art\n\nArtification, defined as the process in which “something that is not regarded as art in the traditional sense of the word is changed into something art-like or into something that takes influences from artistic ways of thinking and acting”.[20] In essence, artifying a product is about de-commodifying it through narratives and designs that are considered art, that put emphasis on creativity over functionality.\n\nThe artification process often yields financial and perception benefits. Previous academic research proved the existence of the art infusion effect, which is the general and positive “influence of the presence of art on consumer perceptions and evaluations of products with which it is associated.”[21] With this effect, the “perceptions of luxury associated with visual art spill over from the artwork onto products with which it is associated, leading to more favorable evaluations of these products.”[22] These evaluations then lead to increased margins, prices, and brand reputation and associations. Tying artification to classical philosophers in political economy, Marx wrote that distancing labor from the product helps to conceal labor, thereby enabling brands to charge higher fees. In crafting the narrative for its art products, LV can obscure different elements like history, craft making, the idea of the “orient”, luxury, material costs, and labor costs into am ambiguous whole and therefore charge a high premium for this storytelling. By clearly delineating the region of consumption in Europe and the production of ideas in Asia, much of the value that is carried over is created in the form of storytelling and artification, in its mysterious allure.\n\nFor Veblen, artification is about conspicuous consumption and status, and purchasing luxury goods that have a direct relationship to art or is branded as art signals their tastes as being elevated. From a capitalistic standpoint, it is often noted that the higher the price, the lower the demand, but this is the opposite case for luxury goods and art. This phenomenon is a principle that LV benefits largely from and continues to use through its artification strategies.\n\nLouis Vuitton and Takashi Murakami Collaboration — Bold and Colorful Status Symbols:\n\nIn artifying luxury products, Louis Vuitton has an interesting history of successfully collaborating with contemporary Japanese artist Takashi Murakami. In 2002, their collaboration used modern colors and paintings, which found harmony in “Speedy,” for which Murakami used 12 colors, but retained its Louis Vuitton heritage and revealed its unknown potential to expand the product portfolio.[23] An example bag from this collaboration is shown in Figure 1 of the appendix. The company collaborated with Murakami again in 2008.\n\nIn 2008, the relationship between Takashi Murakami and Louis Vuitton reached an even higher level. During a retrospective dedicated to the artist at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles, the artist took the opportunity to install Louis Vuitton’s popup store at the heart of the exhibition, as if it were a work of art itself rather than a commercial section of the museum. The temporary store exhibited the collection created in collaboration with the artist, and visitors could buy the products displayed.[24] The experimental collaboration between Marc Jacobs, who was the creative director at LV at the time and Takashi Murakami rejuvenated the brand and its target audience, such that the products combining Vuitton & Murakami became best sellers.\n\nLouis Vuitton x Takashi Murakami Speedy HL (2003)\n\nVisually, Murakami often uses multiple, vibrant colors in his artworks, and this also became a prominent feature of his first collaboration with Louis Vuitton in 2003. Whereas the monogram pattern was traditionally screen printed in a single color (gold), Murakami’s design — the so-called Eye Love Monogram — included 30 colors. This was radical, but also very popular, departure from the relatively muted look of the brand’s traditional assortment. According to a press release on September 12, 2003 from LVMH, the design was so popular that customer waiting lists had to be created. [25] Brands like LV try to add value to the brand as well as the goods. Although, instead of leaving something behind, the luxury brands manage to take with them their ‘old’ values adding new ones continually. Once again using the illustration of Louis Vuitton and the release of the ‘Murakami’ bags; the brand was strong, very much centered round the logo, taking these strong values with them and adding the dimension of personalization.[26]\n\n“Curating artists to collaborate on projects surrounding the brand as well as on the design of products has been a significant way for Louis Vuitton to associate itself with the world to fine art, including the art market, and this practice has arguably played a key role in the transformation of Louis Vuitton from “the brand your mother bought: expensive and well made, but boring and out of date” to an edgier contemporary and living brand.\n\nThe term curating is here being used to describe how the company selects certain artists to associate with its brand name.[27]” These associations add perception value to the products that are being turned into art, through spaces of legitimacy like the store, which functions as a place where objects transform from being materials only to having symbolic value beyond materiality. By collaborating with Murakami, “art collaborations help luxury brands to regain their lost distance towards competing (masstige) brands and non-targeted “middle-market” customers by building on the strong social demarcation function of art.”[28] This conscious appeal to a more sophisticated demographic is their strategy as the artistic sphere is one that is not effortlessly accessible for the mediocre consumer. When luxury brands interact with the art world, they are introduced to the exclusivity of the artistic sphere and are able to “affirm their distinctive connoisseurship and emphasize their belonging to elitist networks.”[29] These elitist networks are rooted in scarcity and the exotic, the idea of a “far away” land that is romanticized. As Pierre Bourdieu reminds us, a whole system of words and images is interposed between producers and consumers of fashion. This system acts as a screen which participates in an act of ‘collective belief’.[30] The collective belief is what grants fashion its power and luxury effect, as discourses are centralized into making the public believe in the importance of the product as something that is so aspirational and that signals class and taste.\n\nSotheby’s writes of LV and Murakami’s collaboration — “style has never been so prominent, and sporting a LV x Murakami design is the ultimate status symbol. This monumental collaboration paved the way for collections to come, with Louis Vuitton giving artists like Richard Prince and Yayoi Kusama free reign to transform the brand’s leather goods.”[31]\n\nLouis Vuitton and Yayoi Kusama Collaboration:\n\nDue to the success of the Murakami collections in 2012, Louis Vuitton repeated the co-branding strategy with another internationally renowned Japanese artist named Yayoi Kusama. Marc Jacobs met Yayoi Kusama during his trip to Japan in 2006. The now 89-year-old visionary artist has built her philosophy on the idea that “The earth is only a small polka dot in the universe”. From this statement, one may understand why almost all of her work is characterized by the distinctive use of dot patterns. These dot patterns repeated endlessly represent the first point of convergence between the artist and Louis Vuitton, a brand known for its repeated monogram.\n\nThe collaboration between Yayoi Kusama and Louis Vuitton was launched in the summer of 2012 and was probably the largest artistic collaboration held by a luxury or fashion company. These artistic collaborations comprise a mix of patronage, cooperation, and sponsorship activities. They reached higher levels of involvement than did previous collaborations. The support of the brand’s entire strategic direction led to cooperation with the two Japanese artists for the purpose of appealing to younger consumers. Through these artistic collaborations, Louis Vuitton wanted to reach new consumers through communication dedicated to the colorful and fresh design of its collection. After recent changes that affected the managerial and artistic direction of the French Maison, the LV artification strategy has evolved as well toward a focus on international recognition.[32] The appeal of Kusama follows a similar appeal to Murakami — both artists use repetition immensely, both artists are often successful in auction sales, and this prestige of the art world lends itself to the branding of LV.\n\nThe “Infinity Dots” theme of the new Louis Vuitton x Yayoi Kusama collaboration gives the LVxYK Alma BB an upbeat arty look. Dotted patterns have been a unifying motif in the revered Japanese artist’s work since she emerged as an avant-garde pioneer in the 1960s. For this precious bag, dazzling black dots are printed on yellow Epi cowhide, accented with a charm shaped like a pumpkin — another of Kusama’s emblems.\n\nLouis Vuitton write sin its website that it “continues its creative dialogue with world-renowned Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama for a colorful collaboration featuring signature pieces adorned with the artist’s original motifs.”[33] Through the art-based collections, LV offers highly recognizable products that are profoundly different from the classical Louis Vuitton collection, such as the colorful and witty design by Takashi Murakami, or the bright polka dots by Yayoi Kusama. All those collections are targeted to appeal young consumers; this is why prices were “on target” with a €225 for a slip-swimsuit and €215 for an infinity dots scarf, very low-level price for LV.[34] The realization of ready-to-wear capsules collections with artists would allow luxury brands to increase sales while also avoiding the trap of commoditization. For the collaborations with Takashi Murakami and Yayoi Kusama, this anti-commoditization effect seems to have been successful, as limited collection products have become cult products, also sold via art auction houses as limited pieces. For customers who purchase luxury goods as a reflection of their personalities and values, buying a collaboration in this sense helps communicate luxury but also sophistication in the fine arts.\n\nThe art-based strategies of Louis Vuitton will continuously evolve to increase ready-to-wear sales to a more profitable percentage, particularly by realizing capsule collections with artists to avoid commoditization. Due to recent structural changes in Louis Vuitton’s management and artistic direction, corporate strategies concerning art-related strategies will\n\nchange as well, orienting even more toward culture and the arts.\n\n10 years later, LV collaborated with Kusama again. The original collection spanned both accessories and apparel, Kusama-fied with dots. This new chapter sees “Kusama’s talismanic objects, motifs and imaginings of infinity take over the maison and all of its product categories,” the brand said, “from bags to menswear; womenswear to sunglasses; fragrances to shoes and accessories. In turn, there’s an evolution of some of Louis Vuitton’s own emblematic pieces, making them equally part of their own and Kusama’s transformative world.”[35] The primary difference between this collection and the Murakami collections is that there is an increased emphasis on uneven circular dots, and the background of the bags is often in a color that is not white, like red, or yellow, or black.\n\nVogue India writes that For Louis Vuitton, Kusama’s floral patterns have been stippled in jacquard over men’s suits and embroidered over blouses, while they come embossed over men’s accessories like the Keepall. For women, the artwork takes over as the main attraction, with spots enlarged to cover the surfaces of Capucines and wrap skirts. Clothing, shoes and bags have all been enveloped into her universe with careful deliberation, where the spots are woven into 3D knits printed onto silks and embossed. Not to miss the little details, the spots proliferate on the soles of loafers as well as on the metal hardware — strong signatures of the brand that fit into their new versions with natural ease.[36]\n\nJimmy Choo Collaboration with Sailor Moon\n\nWe also aim to see the artification of Japanese manga/ pop culture anime appropriation in luxury brands — for example in the case of Sailor Moon and Jimmy Choo on the red boot. From the website of Jimmy Choo, the language being used to describe this collaboration is empowerment and not sexualization, though the latter seems to be implied in the color and the style of Sailor Moon, which is known to be a show featuring anime women in short schoolgirl skirts. Sailor Moon is also blonde and has blue-eyes, so it even hints at how diffusion of culture can be somewhat two-way. Jimmy Choo unveiled a whole collection in honor of the 30th anniversary of the Naoko Takeuchi Manga. The collection was assembled by Jimmy Choo’s creative director, Sandra Choi, who aimed to pay homage to Takeuchi’s vision and the influence that her Manga has had on pop culture. The highlight of the collection has to be its bold boots, platforms, and pumps fashioned after the pastel colors of each of the Sailor Scouts. However, the collaboration also includes some cool bags and even an LP of Sailor Moon-inspired tracks put together by Honey Dijon.[37]\n\nJimmy Choo’s website writes “This collaboration highlights our shared values, not only the empowerment of women, but also the ability of fashion to inspire inclusiveness and individuality through personality and self-confidence. The notion of transformation through fashion is at the heart of Naoko Takeuchi’s work, and clothes play a determining role in the identity of her superheroines, in particular their shoes which have a real transformative power.[38] This style of empowerment seems to coincide with third-wave feminism, which arose in the 1990s and often saw feminine themes like intersectionality, sex positivity, and taking control of your sexual appearance. The long boots and short skirt look often has been sexualized and was predominant in the rock and punk subculture.\n\nThe offering of products includes a selection of Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury and Sailor Jupiter boots, Sailor Mars high heels and Sailor Venus pumps. The Sailor Moon boots arrive in a knee-high stretch silhouette, complete with a vibrant pink lacquered kick-heel, followed by green Sailor Jupiter lace-up leather combat boots, complete with a rubber lug sole and block heel. Rounding out the boot offering is the Sailor Mercury ankle boots, designed in glossy patent leather. Elsewhere, the collection includes red Sailor Mars high heels and satin Sailor Venus platform pumps in a vibrant orange.[39] The Harajuku-esque fashion of this collaboration has links to female sexuality, with schoolgirl type skirts linked to innocent girlhood and sexual fantasies related to that form of sexual fetishization.[40] Schoolgirl fantasy was also rooted in the historical context of these schoolgirls in Japan who were wealthy daughters of elite families. As Japanese studies scholar Melanie Czarnecki has noted, these “social princesses” were the symbols of both “ethereally sweet and innocent” girlhood as well as of “moral degeneracy”.[41] The latter conception was largely predicated on their progressive and liberated behaviors.[42]\n\nAn example of a hyper sexualized schoolgirl princess in Sailor Moon, Usagi in her Super Sailor Moon form as seen in the SuperS series of the 1990s anime\n\nWith this collaboration, what was not considered “Art” in Sailor Moon drawings was turned into fine art through systems of rationalizations and productions of meaning through art dialogues. Deepening the comprehension of the role of the art content in the art infusion effect, Hagtvedt and Patrick (2011) investigated across three studies the distinction between art content and manner, providing evidence of the fact that, while “artwork as art” is context-independent, “artwork as an illustration” is context-dependent. Content and manner represent two components of the artwork: while the former concerns “what is depicted” and conveys information, the latter concerns “how it is depicted” and distinguishes artworks from mere illustrations. The Sailor Moon art actually reminds one of Murakami’s otaku art, which was an idea that Japanese cute was a blurry mix of sweet Lolitas and Gwen Stefani’s version of Harajuku. In this sense, the Murakami and Sailor moon collaborations are often viewed as hip Tokyo street fashion but this is actually not ground in any particular street culture, but actually several made up and mixed up aesthetics from fashion, mass market, product design, and popular media.[43]\n\nJimmy Choo X Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\n\nWith the artification of Sailor Moon, we see how certain artwork content can sell if it is stressed, but if it is not stressed, it doesn’t affect product evaluation. Conversely, when the artwork is no longer perceived as art because of the shift of emphasis from manner to content, product evaluation is affected by the fit between the artwork content and the product. Moreover, consumers’ mindsets can drive them to process the artwork as either art or mere illustration. Since abstract mindsets are “associated with higher-level construals and schematic, global processing”, they are more focused on the visual art and thus will be unaffected by artwork content. Essentially, with the artistic branding that is narrated by Jimmy Choo, partnerships with brands that are not traditionally luxurious can become fine art as well.[44]\n\n“I am extremely happy that the characters and stories that came from my imagination are now loved by many people around the world,” adds Sailor Moon author, Naoko Takeuchi. “What has always been truly important to me is the youthful, pure imagination and power of the young girls. I believe that the Jimmy Choo brand also has these qualities,” she continues.[45]\n\nThemes within Oriental Artification\n\nWith the case studies investigated, it appears that the orientalism in artification relies on 1) vibrant visual colors with repetition of shapes 2) structured simplicity and 3) memorable fantasy-like personas. These traits are not exclusive to oriental art, but are recurring trends in fashion and art collaborations.\n\nWith vibrant visual colors, Murakami and Kusama are both artists who use bold colors such as yellow, orange, and red in various iterations in simple patterns — for Murakami he repeats his flowers often and his character Mr. Dob, whereas Kusama is interested in the idea of the infinite, which she portrays with many dots and lines. These bold visual colors\n\nWith the use of structured simplicity, both use these shapes in a fractal like manner, where sequences of the same shape is reiterated countless times, often in different colors. Their drawings are not overly complex as individual pieces, but as a whole, create attractive and memorable patterns which often can be translated to leather goods or clothing effectively.\n\nWith the persona of these artists, Takashi Murakami is a comedic, playful, quirky, and childish character who loves to dress in costumes and various outfits including large hats. For Kusama, she loves to wear all red, and even has red hair with a signature bowl cut, which makes her brand image iconic and easily identifiable.\n\nFor the art collaborations with Japanese artists, sexualization is limited and often it is the cartoon-characters and simple yet structured patterns that take center stage. For the Sailor Moon collaboration, the sexualization of the boot is overt and yet seems to be secondary to the functions of popularity, novelty, and recognized iconography.\n\nAs mentioned, artification is often pulled at one’s desire to signal status and the desire for distinction. A consistent part of luxury consumers’ purchases of luxury products is a way to demonstrate their higher social standing and wealth to the ones that can’t afford it. Consumers who buy these products, compared to the ones that show a lower desire to signal status, are “more interested in buying luxury products promoted in advertisements that feature recognizable artworks rather than non-recognizable artworks”. Hence, throughout these collaborations, it is apparent that the products reference distinct colors in iconic artworks that the collaborating artists are known for. At the same time, other consumers purchase luxury products to differentiate themselves from other consumers and to convey their uniqueness. These consumers generally use uncommon signals of luxuriousness and thus prefer rare, special, or non-conforming luxury products. Previous academic research has proved that these consumers, compared to the ones who are animated by a lower desire for distinction, are “more interested in buying luxury products promoted in advertisements featuring non-recognizable artworks rather than recognizable artworks.”[46] The understanding of the subtleties of consumer ostentation help these companies plan collaborations well with artists and comics.\n\nFurther, one has to evaluate the economics of the artification of orientalism model, as capitalism is the primary form of socio-economic governance and thus, business logic underpins many decisions being undertaken. We wonder if oriental artification is about quality, and the specific appeal of Japanese crafts is the people’s familial traditions being effectively passed down, and not wiped out by colonial invasions. A business of fashion article writes that Luxury giants are increasingly obsessed with small Japanese suppliers. The article writes that “A growing number of both luxury and mass market players are collaborating with masters of historical crafts, ranging from enamelware to woodwork, on designs for a global audience.”[47]\n\nOne may also wonder if the orientalism model is based on the rhetoric of scarcity and limited quantities in knowledge production. Another factor is the linkage of Japan as a more economically developed country and its ties with the “West” as Japan does have a similar line of colonizer history, instead of being the oppressed and invaded party, particularly in World War 2.\n\nIn tying Japanese success to art, these 2 artists — Kusama and Takashi Murakami often top auctions and hold the records for being the some of the most expensive artists today.\n\nConclusion — Luxury and Art collaborations that exoticize the East are historically rooted, popular, and will likely continue\n\nLinks between fashion, luxury, and art are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary as the events, marketing, and discourse around these creative fields are similarly about product differentiation and making a mark in history. While Asian, primarily Chinese, and Japanese art forms have often been looked to as inspiration, almost appropriated even, it is unclear if in the current 21st century, whether the collaborations between artists of LV have to do with orientalism, or pop culture, or the “quality” of the work as there seems to be intersectionality within these fields. The artistic characteristics of the orient if used, seem to be presented in styles that show indigenous characteristics of each country, for example, Chinese styles in a dragon pattern and other times Japanese styles in flower designs.\n\nIn her study of Japanese designers Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto, Mears writes that when they address international audiences, Japanese designers tend to be perceived as sharing identical aesthetic visions, for ‘modern Japanese fashion has often been viewed less as the result of individual designers’ efforts than as a form of collective expression’. This emphasis on the “Japaneseness” relates to the process of “othering”.[48]\n\nMimicking this artistic expression, Western artists and designers added their own eroticized understandings of the country to create a new genre of cultural expression in the form of Japonisme. To the Europeans, especially the British, “kimono-style dress was all but a transmutation of harem dress with its limitless erotic undertones; the geisha became the modern counterpart of the romantic harem-dweller.”[49] This unique and poignant appropriation acts as a definition of Japonisme. Veblen coined this term in his 1899 book, The Theory of Leisure and Class, in the middle of the transformation of Japonism from trend to culture in Britain. Britain’s fascination with Japan gradually evolved throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, starting from the eroticized rumors about Japanese women and growing to an acceptance of Japanese culture into the British lifestyle. Artist and designers such as Whistler, Dresser, Liberty, Worth, and Poiret, indeed, did help perpetuate the rise of Japanese influence in women’s fashion, yet it was nature of haute couture fashion itself that was the deciding factor that fostered Orientalism in Britain and the legacy of this orientalism and art continues to exist today.[50]\n\n[1] Sandra Krim, “Conceptualizing The Media of Artification: Contribution to the Theory of Artification of Luxury Brands,” Roma, International Marketing Trends Conference, 2022, https://www.researchgate.net/publication\n\n/358087286_Conceptualizing_the_media_of_artification_A_contribution_to_the_theory_of_artification_of_luxury_brands.\n\n[2]Sandra Krim, “Conceptualizing The Media of Artification: Contribution to the Theory of Artification of Luxury Brands,” Roma, International Marketing Trends Conference, 2022, https://www.researchgate.net/publication\n\n/358087286_Conceptualizing_the_media_of_artification_A_contribution_to_the_theory_of_artification_of_luxury_brands.\n\n[3] Sandra Krim, “Conceptualizing The Media of Artification: Contribution to the Theory of Artification of Luxury Brands,” Roma, International Marketing Trends Conference, 2022, https://www.researchgate.net/publication\n\n/358087286_Conceptualizing_the_media_of_artification_A_contribution_to_the_theory_of_artification_of_luxury_brands.\n\n[4]M.
