        "text": "In the world of K-pop, male idol groups must always be mindful of the government statute that requires every South Korean male to serve in the military for at least two years. As this must be completed before a certain age, sometimes groups will promote a record while certain members are absent, or all the members will volunteer to go at a similar time. BIG BANG, one of the biggest and most influential hip-hop-oriented boy bands in modern K-pop history, opted for the latter route, with multiple members signing up for service in 2017 and 2018, leaving their fans with a \"goodbye single\" before they left. Before the core members of T.O.P., Taeyang, Daesung, and perpetual bad boy G-Dragon returned from service, member Seungri retired from the entertainment industry following his involvement in the horrific Burning Sun nightclub scandal. Upon return, the remaining quartet planned to continue and envisioned a 2020 reunion at Coachella before COVID-19 upended their plans. As much as generation-defining songs like \"Fantastic Baby\" and \"Bang Bang Bang\" are best heard in huge crowds, the boys had to be patient. Lucky for fans, in April 2022, their long-awaited comeback ballad \"Still Life\" dropped and instantly shot to the top of the Korean charts. Almost two decades into their career, they're as BIG as ever.\n\nFor some, the 2018 revelation that Canadian post-rock icons Frog Eyes were breaking up was devastating (especially for the writers at Cokemachineglow). After all, Carey Mercer's unique brand of yelping chaos and wincing pathos felt elevated above his scene peers. Even though Mercer formed new band Soft Plastics with other members of Frog Eyes, the audience retention wasn't the same. Thus, many were shocked that out of nowhere, following all the exit interviews where Mercer claimed that having eight albums was a perfect way to leave his legacy, it was announced in February 2022 that the band was back and had already completed their ninth full-length record \"The Bees\", which showed signs of the group happy to be back to their rocking old selves. Regardless of the circumstances for both the breakup and rebirth, it's clear that the loyalty of the Frog Eyes fandom has been richly rewarded.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, emo rock was all the rage, and My Chemical Romance stood out from the back with their tight hooks, inventive music videos, and the wild appearance of frontman Gerard Way. Yet one thing about MCR is that they never stayed in the same place: each album had a new twist to their sound, ranging from the rock opera of 2006's \"The Black Parade\" to the odd electro concept record that was 2010's \"Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys\". Yet while recording a new album, the group announced in 2013 that they were heading their separate ways, Way indicating because they had too many disagreements. Every member engaged in some sort of solo venture in the intervening years, including Way seeing his \"Umbrella Academy\" graphic novel turned into a popular TV show. Yet in 2019, the group announced a reunion show and revealed they had been working as a unit a full two years prior. They had a full North American reunion tour slated for 2020 that was pushed back twice due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but the band is still adamant about fulfilling those dates. They may be famous last words, but we still believe they're trying to do the right thing.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest's influence on hip-hop is incalculable, and throughout the early '90s, their streak of game-changing, groundbreaking albums was close to unmatched. Yet when 1996's \"Beats, Rhymes and Life\" dropped, Phife Dawg noted how members Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Q-Tip converting to Islam left him feeling like an outsider when it came to determining the group's sound. When 1998's \"The Love Movement\" was released, the group announced it would be their last, with all members going on to pursue solo projects. While Q-Tip and Phife managed to set aside their differences for some occasional guest verses, the group managed to start touring in 2006 onward, partially reuniting to help find a way to pay for Phife's burgeoning medical expenses. They began recording a new album in secrecy in 2015, but the record was incomplete following Phife Dawg's passing the following year. With a literal who's-who of rap superstars coming in to help complete the vision of the record, \"We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service\" was finally released shortly after the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, and it was immediately heralded as a modern-day masterpiece. It's a fitting swan song for one of the greatest rap groups to ever exist.\n\nThe first few years of The Go-Go's existence can best be described as a whirlwind. Their 1981 debut \"Beauty and the Beat\" and their 1982 follow-up record \"Vacation\" were both sizable New Wave hits, cementing this all-female group as a huge new player on rock radio. Yet that \"classic lineup\" of Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin, Charlotte Caffey, Gina Schock, and Kathy Valentine was full of strong personalities, and by the time 1984's \"Talk Show\" hit, the group was in constant conflict with each other. While The Go-Go's tried to move on following a split with Wiedlin, the result was that the girls were growing increasingly disinterested in the project, so they decided to disband. The group, somewhat amazingly, has reunited and broken up a few times over now, going on two different farewell tours while members came, went, sued the band, and then rejoined. It's been a wild journey, but we've been happy to still have them around; they even recorded a new song as recently as 2020 to go along with their documentary about their career. They nailed the sentiments of how we feel with the title of their final studio album: 2001's \"God Bless The Go-Go's\".\n\nYou can't talk about famous band breakups without talking about The Pixies, full stop. The Boston-bred indie-rock all-stars helped popularize a soft-loud style of songwriting that was addictive as it was abrasive and influenced people like Kurt Cobain, who publicly declared his love of the band often. Following the group's opening slot for a U2 tour in 1992, coupled with the fact that the band's output was increasingly becoming a showcase for frontman Black Francis and no one else, the group disbanded, with Francis infamously informing members Kim Deal and Dave Lovering of the news via fax. For the next decade, they all pursued various solo projects, with Deal becoming an alt-rock star in her own right with her new band, The Breeders. Yet in 2003 and per their own admission of doing it for the money, the band reunited for a tour that sold out nearly instantaneously. The tour was lucrative enough that they kept making festival appearances and doing album-oriented anniversary runs around the country. In 2013, Kim Deal left the band permanently, and soon new music came flowing out of the group, even if all three \"post-reunion\" records have met a muted reception.\n\nTechnically, Fall Out Boy never broke up -- but you couldn't tell the fans otherwise. Following the decidedly mixed reception to 2008's \"Folie à Deux\", the members of Fall Out Boy needed a break from each other, each pursuing music in their own way, forming bands and getting studio and songwriting work for a few years. None of their projects proved successful, and after singer Patrick Stump put out a blog post detailing the cruel comments he received from fans as he tried to go solo, bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz reached out with empathy. Soon the quartet decided to give it another ago. What's different about Fall Out Boy's reuniting is that they did it in secret, sneaking into studios and crafting new songs without the public or press knowing, largely because if it didn't work out, they could walk away from it without letting anyone down. Fortunately, it did work out, and when they announced they were back and had a new album ready to go in early 2013, it lit their fanbase on fire. \"Save Rock and Roll\" was a commercial and critical comeback for the group, who has put out two more studio full-lengths since then, each topping the U.S. charts. Guess they really did save rock and roll after all ...\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins knew how to end their trailblazing alternative-rock career: by putting out their last major studio album (2000's \"Machina/The Machines of God\"), putting out a secret sequel record to their fans on the down-low, and then playing their epic four-hour final show at the first major venue to ever house them: Chicago's Metro. It was perfect, for a spell, but frontman Billy Corgan's post-Pumpkins career didn't immediately have the same level of success he was accustomed to. His first new venture, a more pop-rock-minded group called Zwan, fractured quickly as members weren't taking it as seriously as he would like. Then, the day that his dark electro solo album \"TheFutureEmbrace\" came out in 2005, he put out a full-page ad in the Chicago Tribune that bluntly said, \"I want my band back.\" He did reform The Smashing Pumpkins, but there was only one problem: the only returning members were Corgan and ace drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Everyone else was a new hire, and the albums the \"nu-Pumpkins\" put out didn't strike fans in the same way as their peak '90s output. While original guitarist James Iha eventually rejoined the group around 2016, it was too little too late, as most fans had largely decided to pass on Corgan's new material (which was a shame, given that their live shows were garnering sensational reviews). You know what they say: the end is the beginning is the end.\n\nIt's amazing how much impact The Stone Roses had on rock music despite only have two studio albums to their name. Galvanizing the emerging dance-rock scene in the U.K. known as \"Madchester,\" the Roses' trademark mix of hip-hop drum beats and swirling psychedelic guitars sounded like little else out there. When mixed with singer Ian Brown's high-and-mighty lyrics, it felt like every song of their self-titled debut was both fresh and ageless at the same time. The band toiled in the studio for years idly working on their sophomore album, draining the record company of their dollars as each band member grew further apart from each other, with drummer Reni leaving right before the release of 1994's \"Second Coming\" and god-level guitarist John Squire leaving during the subsequent tour. The group formally dissolved in 1996, but in 2011, rumors swirled in the press about a reunion that, amazingly, turned out to be true. The reunited original quartet toured with decent regularity over the next several years, even putting out a pair of new songs in 2016. The following year, while performing in Glasgow, Brown told the crowd, \"Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened.\" The following day, he confirmed that the group had disbanded again, and this time it is likely permanent.\n\nAt the height of the mid-'90s Britpop wars, Oasis and Blur were constantly at odds with each other, with Blur's witty lad-pop running concurrently with the Gallagher brothers' pub-centric Beatles cosplay. While the group's aesthetics were fundamentally different, what truly separated the bands was their worldwide appeal, as Oasis broke through in America long before Blur released their American rock one-off \"Song 2\", which soon itself became a radio staple. Blur's sound continued to grow and change, but while singer Damon Albarn spent time focusing on his new group Gorillaz, the fraught and frustrating sessions of a new Blur album lead guitarist Graham Coxon to quit in 2002. The band's \"Think Tank\" still was released in 2003, but the tour that followed had the group hire multiple guitarists to try and replicate what Coxon could do all on his own. Blur went into hiatus as each member pursued new musical muses while also writing books and even exploring political runs. Yet in 2008, the boys' tensions had thawed, and they were ready to play shows again. Their big reunion dates eventually led to an oddball new album of studio noodles called \"The Magic Whip\", released in 2015. Since then, the group has effectively been on hiatus, but no one's ruled out the possibility of another reunion.\n\nLove them or hate them, the Eagles were one of the biggest bands of the '70s, and 1976's \"Hotel California\" got about as big as blockbuster albums could get. Touring it, however, was a different matter, as the band got in frequent arguments with each other, culminating in the loss of founding member Randy Meisner, leaving the group as soon as the tour was finished. Ego clashes peppered much of the sessions leading up to 1979's \"The Long Run\" and the tour that followed, with one show ending with members threatening physical harm on each other. A decade-plus hiatus followed, with all the members pursuing their solo muses. Yet a chance Travis Tritt music video for an Eagles cover he recorded ended up bringing all the boys back into the same room. Before long, they were performing again, dropping a live album in 1994 with the genius title of \"Hell Freezes Over\". This time on the road, tensions were cooled, and by the time 2007 rolled around, the band released their first new collection of brand new material in decades: \"Long Road Out of Eden\". They really did take it to the limit.\n\nThe Band is many things: a team of individual songwriters, peak-era collaborators for the likes of Bob Dylan, and also a music group with a distinct identity in its own right. While the musicianship was always of top-tier quality, Robbie Robertson ultimately seized control of the band, becoming the primary songwriter. Tried of touring, he fashioned a big send-off for the group called \"The Last Waltz\", which was a Thanksgiving celebration that was eventually filmed by Martin Scorsese. The resulting concert movie is considered one of the best ever made, but the group ended up pursuing their own muses for a spell. Yet in 1982, the remaining members toured under The Band name without Robertson. Following the tragic suıcide of Richard Manuel in 1986, the moniker became a showcase for Rick Danko and Levon Helm. They didn't return to recording new material until 1993, but they dropped a trio of albums in the '90s that sadly did little to further the group's legacy. While Helm and Robertson spent years at odds with each other finances and songwriting credits, The Band will always be remembered as true innovators to the form, long-simmering tears of rage notwithstanding.\n\nIt may seem strange to count a one-off reunion gig as a full entry for a list such as this, but when the band in question is Led Zeppelin, who dares argue otherwise? Following John Bonham's tragic death in 1980 (he was age 32 at the time), the remaining members of Led Zeppelin could not continue without him, disbanding quite abruptly. Decades passed wherein Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and Robert Plant all pursued solo success, and while they would sometimes meet in passing, the legacy of one of the greatest hard rock groups of all time seemed fully intact. Yet in 2007, a tribute concert was being held for legendary Atlantic Records executive Ahmet Ertegun, who was instrumental in Zep's success. He may very well be the only person the band was going to reunite for, and at the O2 Arena in London, the original group (with Bonham's son Jason filling in for him on drums) did a full concert set to the thrill of music lovers the world over. As soon as it was over, fans and journalists began buzzing over the prospect of a reunited Led Zeppelin touring or even recording again. While Jones and Page were all for it, Robert Plant felt it was too gimmicky a prospect. Other vocalists were auditioned, but at the end of the day, the hopes of a new era of Zeppelin dominance never materialized.\n\nOh, you're a Guided By Voices fan? Then name 13 of their albums! All jokes aside, Guided By Voices frontman Robert Pollard simply cannot stop writing songs. While his buzzy lo-fi rock outfit put out their first album in 1987, they have managed to put an additional 29 albums since then, on top of countless EPs and box sets of material, to say nothing of side projects and solo albums. As such, when the band's 15th album \"Half Smiles of the Decomposed\" dropped in 2004, Pollard announced that it felt like the kind of album you wanted to end a career on, and the group mounted a massive farewell tour to mark the occasion. Pollard dropped a litany of solo albums since then. Yet in 2010, the band's longtime label Matador Records announce that the GBV \"Classic '93–'96 Lineup\" would be performing at the label's 21st-anniversary celebration; a full reunion tour was announced shortly after that. Then in 2012, a new GBV album dropped called \"Let's Go Eat the Factory\". Then a few more. Then came \"English Little League\", which Pollard said would be their final release. Then they put out another one. Then another. Then they disbanded mid-tour in 2014. Then they came back in 2016. Then they put out next to a dozen new full-length albums after that. At this point, Guided By Voices can break up again, but honestly, we're not going to believe it.\n\nDublin's own My Bloody Valentine managed to craft the epitome of shoegaze rock music with the endlessly swirling, texture-filled, damn-near-groundbreaking 1991 masterwork \"Loveless\". The only problem with it? It was a cult record with niche appeal, so it did sell modestly but nearly bankrupted their record label in the process, with frontman Kevin Shields having taken over two years to craft an album that his label was convinced could be recorded in five days. Creation Records dropped them following the release of \"Loveless\". The band signed with Island Records but ended up recording nothing more than stray cuts, with members soon leaving after it became clear that Shields was going through a heavy amount of writer's block and became increasingly isolated. My Bloody Valentine was all but dead, and rumors swirled that several albums of material were recorded but never realized. However, in 2007, many were surprised to hear that the band was reuniting for a comeback tour, and amazingly, they did. In 2008, they played a multitude of festivals, and after years of promises and breathless anticipation, they finally released their third album, \"m b v\", in 2013, with demand for the album so high that their website crashed upon release. Promises of new material were sprinkled about in the ensuing years. In March 2021, the band signed to Domino Records, hinting that maybe we won't have to wait over two decades for a new album from the perpetual studio tinkerers.\n\nNot the JoBros! While the trio of musical brothers grew famous off their tween audience cultivated via their many projects on the Disney Channel, their passionate fanbase helped propel them beyond the Radio Disney confines in the late 2000s, with tracks like \"Burnin' Up\" getting big crossover radio play. Yet following 2009's horrendously titled \"Lines, Vines, and Trying Times\" and a brief hiatus, a 2013 attempt to record and perform lead to a full creative falling out, leaving their half-recorded new album in the wind and the band formally defunct. Nick formed his own band and then went the full sexy popstar route to surprising success. Joe didn't find solo gold until he had a fluke hit with his weirdo pop group DNCE. Kevin created a reality show that his other brothers seemed to resent being on. After years of side-projects and differences, the JoBros came back in a big way in 2019, starting with a new single called \"Sucker\" that ended up becoming their first-ever chart-topper. The resulting new full-length \"Happiness Begins\" (and the corresponding documentary \"Chasing Happiness\") brought the boys back in a big way, reestablishing their pop credentials while selling out multiple dates of their follow-up world tour. At this rate, they may be touring all the way into the year 3000.\n\nWhen Mötley Crüe broke up, they were serious about it. Intending to stop touring before calling it quits, the band signed a \"cessation of touring agreement,\" which they claimed was a legally binding document that would prevent anyone from touring in the Crüe name after their final tour date. That final performance was done on New Years' Eve 2015 and filmed for a concert documentary rather definitively titled \"Mötley Crüe: THE END\". In most cases, this would definitively be the final word on a band's career, but in 2019, following the gangbusters reaction to the Netflix biopic about the Crüe's rise called \"The Dirt\", the band reunited in a video that showed them burning up that legally binding document, promising to hit the road again now that they have a whole new generation of fans being introduced to their music. This tour, unfortunately, hit a snag when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down most venues and stadiums. Still, the band promises that the show will go on, potentially under the keen medical advisement of Dr. Feelgood.\n\nAlthough they got looped into the grunge movement of the early '90s, Soundgarden's artistic temperament was always more akin to alternative metal than full-on grunge. Following their blockbuster 1994 album \"Superunknown\", they nonetheless became superstars and figureheads of the genre, with lead single \"Black Hole Sun\" becoming a defining track of the era. Recording a follow-up was going to be difficult, and while 1996's \"Down on the Upside\" showed a more striking acoustic side to the band's sound, the sessions were fraught with tension, and the worldwide tour that followed didn't help matters at all, forcing the band to break up in 1997. After over a decade apart -- which included singer Chris Cornell starting and even ending a new successful band called Audioslave -- Soundgarden managed to put aside their differences and was formally reunited in 2010. They managed to play dates without a hitch and even recorded a new album, 2012's \"King Animal\". Box sets of rarities were released, and the band was working on new material up until Cornell was found dead by suıcide in 2017. The remaining members canceled their planned tour and retired the name out of respect for Cornell's legacy and influence.\n\nFans of Phish knew how to be patient. When the band embarked on a hiatus in the middle of 2000, it only took a few years (and a cameo in \"The Simpsons\") to bring everyone back together. Yet in 2004, a band meeting had singer/guitarist Trey Anastasio letting the group know that he feels the group had run its course and that \"we were faced with the opportunity to graciously step away in unison, as a group, united in our friendship and our feelings of gratitude.\" That year they had their final performances, soon venturing off into various solo ventures while remaining friendly. It was a badge of honor among Phish fans to have been at their final show ... at least until they announced more. In October 2018, they announced that they had reunited, and the following year, put out \"Joy\", their 12th studio album and first under their own record label. They've been touring fairly consistently since coming back together and carrying on long-loved traditions like dedicating their Halloween setlist to a song-for-song cover of another artist's album. On that 2018 spooky show, they went one step further to cover the \"rare\" Scanadanavian prog-rock band Kasvot Växt for Halloween, only for fans to later discover that they created a fictional band, recorded a full album, and planted reviews in certain press databases to make it seem real. Phish aren't just back to business in their 2.0 iteration: they're goofier than ever.\n\nThe Who were breakthrough mod-rockers with a heavy artistic bent, and as the '60s rolled into the '70s, the band (and specifically songwriter/guitarist Pete Townshend) got more ambitious, conceiving of rock operas and intricate concept albums that still managed to spin off hit singles despite the heady ideas. Yet as the '70s rolled on, visionary drummer Keith Moon was going through numerous struggles with his health. As Townshend and singer Roger Daltry wanted to pull back from touring, Moon was losing his talent, eventually dying of an accidental overdose in 1978. The band powered on and continued touring, but even with a few more hits under their flashy belts, tensions between members reached a breaking point, and in late 1983, Daltry left The Who, ending their run. Yet no less than six years later, the group jumped onto a reunion tour bandwagon. Since then, The Who have toured on and off, sometimes doing large performances of the epic \"Quadrophenia\" and other times hitting a round of locations with special guests in tow. After bassist John Entwistle passed away the day before their 2002 U.S. tour was to start, Daltry and Townshend again pressed on with The Who, even performing during the 2010 Super Bowl halftime show and putting out a new studio album in 2019. People wrote them off as finished before, but this time around, fans won't get fooled again.\n\nWhere would we be without the otherworldly weirdness of Gene and Dean Ween? The duo (real names Aaron Freeman and Mickey Melchiondo) slowly rose to prominence in the college rock scene of the '90s with their distinct brand of offbeat and sometimes pitch-black humor. Yet their songs were not mere jokes, largely due in part to their genius-level musicality; Ween's appeal rested in the fact that they could tackle any genre and make it their own. While their audience loved their daring catalog of songs, two decades in a musical partnership is enough to wear anyone down. Following a 2011 tour that saw Dean lay on the stage screaming and singing off-key, Gene released a bunch of era-specific demos online, allegedly without informing his bandmate. This, coupled with Gene's need to get sober, lead to the band splitting. Yet only four years after their breakup (and a few notable side-projects from each), Ween announced a live reunion tour, and their dates sold out close to instantaneously. Since reforming, they haven't released any major studio works but have managed to remain a consistent touring act up until the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The Boognish would be proud of their continued partnership.\n\nThere is arguably no band out there today as polarizing as Death Grips. You either love their abrasive, anti-industry brand of industrial hip-hop, or you hate their aggressive sound and publicity-stunt behavior. While said stunts ranged from the outrageous (like leaking their major label album online because they didn't want to wait for the label's rollout plan; also, the album cover was an erect penıs) to the controversial (\"playing\" a Lollapalooza aftershow by not showing up and projecting a fan's suıcide note over a playlist), no one was sure if their note posted on Facebook in 2014 about breaking up was real or not. \"Death Grips is over,\" it read, scribbled onto a napkin, \"We have officially stopped.\" They canceled their touring slots opening for Nine Inch Nails, and the following year, they dropped a surprise instrumental release while its members explored side-projects. Yet little over a year after their Facebook post, bizarre videos started showing up on their YouTube page, soon leading to a bevy of EPs being uploaded for free and a series of new albums coming out of their vanity label. Love them or loathe them, it seems Death Grips' unique brand of in-your-face rage isn't going away anytime soon.\n\nJames Murphy's moniker/band/project LCD Soundsystem had dance-punk in its bones but pop music in its heart. Oscillating between sung lyrics and pointed monologues, Murphy's road to commercial and critical success was long and arduous. He worked on his music while also serving as a producer and co-founder of the influential DFA Records. As the band grew in popularity and became a tight touring act, Murphy realized that he was missing out on other great opportunities like producing for Arcade Fire due to his ongoing LCD commitments. After the release of his third LCD full-length \"This Is Happening\" in 2010, he later went on to say that it would probably be their last album, something all but confirmed when in 2011 it was announced that LCD Soundsystem would play its last show ever at Madison Square Garden. True to his word, Murphy did go on to do things he wanted to do in his post-LCD life, like producing the next Arcade Fire record and playing percussion on David Bowie's final full-length, \"Blackstar\". Yet as the years went on, rumors started to swirl of the band reuniting, only for such whispers to be swiped down ... at least until the first week of 2016, when it was revealed that LCD would be headlining Coachella, then launching a big tour to celebrate the occasion. Murphy always noted that one of his biggest dreams was to have a chart-topping album, and when 2017's \"American Dream\" arrived, he finally got his wish.\n\nWhen At the Drive-In's third album \"Relationship of Command\" came out in 2000, these post-hardcore rockers began picking up major steam: radio was supporting the single \"One Armed Scissor\", critics were lavishing praise on the record, and their tour dates kept piling up, the band playing to bigger and bigger crowds. Then, in a flash, it was gone. In early 2001, the group announced an \"indefinite\" hiatus, as the hype, the relentless schedule, and the use of drugs lead to all the band members being completely exhausted with each other. The group splintered into two different factions: the rhythm section formed the more \"traditional\" alt-rock band Sparta. In contrast, singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala and virtuoso guitarist Omar Rodríguez-López formed the experimental prog outfit The Mars Volta. Against all odds, it was the latter project that ended up taking off, finding a wild new audience that sustained the outfit for nearly a decade. A brief reunion of ATDI in 2012 lead to a lot of tour dates but no studio work, leaving the group to dissolve again in 2013. Two years later, they joined up again, this time releasing a new album in 2017. Then, in 2019, it was over again, with fans constantly speculating who is mad at whom this time out. Yet if you're a fan of the band and especially Omar Rodríguez-López, you're in luck: he's only managed to put out approximately 49 solo studio albums as of this writing, so you got a good amount of back catalog to work through.\n\nMany bands say that they've been performing together forever, but in the case of Nickel Creek, it's actually true. This bluegrass trio played their first show in 1989, with fiddle player Sara Watkins and mandolinist Chris Thile being eight years old at the time (guitarist Sean Watkins was the eldest at 12). As they recorded and toured together throughout the next decade, they started to pick up some mainstream momentum when Alison Krauss produced their self-titled debut, releasing right after the \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" soundtrack became a generational hit and fueled the group's surprising rise to Platinum status. Following their slightly-more-abrasive fifth album \"Why Should the Fire Die?\" in 2005, it was clear that the trio needed time apart to explore their own musical interests, planning the \"Farewell (For Now)\" tour in 2007 before announcing the dreaded \"indefinite hiatus.\" Each member easily slid into their own solo and band projects, with Sean becoming a bit of a rocker, Sara becoming a bit of a traditionalist, and Chris diving into everything from alt-rock to chamber-pop to classical. The trio remained on good terms, and when 2014 ended up being their 25th anniversary year as a bluegrass outfit, they marked the occasion by releasing a new studio album (\"A Dotted Line\") and touring once again. They reunite for one-off performances now and then and have been doing some live stream concerts at the tail end of the Covid-19 pandemic. Not many bands can still be recording and performing over three decades since forming, but then again, not many bands are Nickel Creek."
