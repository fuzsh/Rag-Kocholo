        "text": "Shame are embarking on their second South By Southwest campaign this week, with manager Paul Jones hoping to “capitalise” on the band’s inaugural trip to the Austin event in 2017.\n\nJones, who manages the London quintet through his Gross Management company, told Music Week: “I hope we can capitalise and build on the shows we played there last year which was a major success.”\n\nSigned to Dead Oceans, Shame hit No.32 with debut album Songs Of Praise in January. The record has since accumulated 6,791 sales (OCC), while the band continue to sell out shows at home and overseas.\n\nJones sees SXSW 2017 as a key milestone in Shame’s story so far. “SXSW gives UK acts the opportunity to play and showcase their music in the USA to industry figures and festival bookers from all around the world,” he said.\n\n“I feel that artists also benefit from playing in a completely new environment, gain new experiences and bond new ties with other bands.”\n\nBBC Radio 6 Music presenter Steve Lamacq is a veteran of SXSW, and the station hosted a set from Shame at the British Music Embassy in 2017.\n\n“If a band plays a reasonably good gig, word of mouth does the rest for you,” Lamacq told Music Week. “It creates a certain level of interest, which then leads to college radio and other things. It’s not a bad starting point if you get it right.”\n\nLamacq said Shame stand to benefit from their experience last year, too. “Going back when the record is out, they’re absolutely ready for it, they understand how big it is and what the audiences are looking for. They’re probably much better prepared now to win over the audience. They’re one of the most compelling new bands I’ve seen over the last two years.”\n\nThe DJ also pointed out that Shame and Idles, who also played last year and return to Austin for 2018, formed a bond at the festival. “Bands can learn from other bands, Shame and Idles was a connection that wouldn’t have been made in the UK.\"\n\nJones said that festivals like SXSW “should be encouraged” because they “can champion, promote and showcase new exciting bands that most people haven’t seen yet from everywhere in one great city.”\n\nThe pair were speaking to Music Week for our special SXSW report, which features inside our latest edition.\n\nSubscribers can read the report in full here.\n\nRead Music Week’s SXSW interview with UK Music chief executive Michael Dugher here."
