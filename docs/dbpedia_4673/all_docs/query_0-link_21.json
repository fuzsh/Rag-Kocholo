I suspect they didn’t arise all at once and most of them are no longer used or recognized by English speakers today. But what was the rationale for their invention and use in the first place (e.g., why a specific name for a group of gerbils)? Many sound like names a poet or prose writer would come up with.\n\nYou already mentioned a murder of crows. For ravens, its an ‘unkindness’ or a ‘conspiracy’. I like corvids though, so I don’t particularly like those names. I’d propose a ‘conversation’ of crows instead and perhaps a ‘ruffle’ of ravens.\n\nIt’s always fun to read these lists, but you must remember that many of them are the creation of a single poet or writer who was trying to conjure up an image with a phrase that had never been used previously. It’s not like the origin is “lost in folklore.”"
