        "text": "1980 single by Madness\n\n\"Embarrassment\"Single by Madnessfrom the album Absolutely Released14 November 1980Recorded1980Genre\n\nNew wave\n\npop\n\nLength3:10LabelStiffComposer(s)Mike BarsonLyricist(s)Lee ThompsonProducer(s)\n\nClive Langer\n\nAlan Winstanley\n\nMadness singles chronology\n\n\"Baggy Trousers\"\n\n(1980) \"Embarrassment\"\n\n(1980) \"The Return of the Los Palmas 7\"\n\n(1981)\n\n\"Embarrassment\" is a song recorded by ska/pop band Madness, predominantly written by Lee Thompson, but partially credited to Mike Barson.[1][2] The band first began performing the song at live shows in April 1980,[3] and it was featured on their second studio album, Absolutely.\n\nThe song was released as a single on 14 November 1980 and spent 12 weeks in the UK singles chart, reaching a high of number 4.[3] The song was remixed for issue as a single, which is different from the album version, although they both have the same running time.\n\nLyrical content\n\n[edit]\n\nThe meaning behind the song was particularly dark, considering the band's previous material. Primarily written by Lee Thompson, the plot of the song reflected the unfolding turmoil following the news that his teenage sister, Tracy, had become pregnant and was carrying a black man's child. The subsequent rejection by her family, and the shame felt, was reflected in the song.[4]\n\nAs Thompson was on the road with the band, he only heard snippets of the story, through phone calls and letters, but this was enough for him to piece the story together. The song is a clear indication of changing attitudes (see miscegenation). The real-life story had a happy ending, however; Thompson later stated that when her daughter Hayley was born, the antipathy of Tracy's relatives dissolved.[1][5]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music video for the single was filmed in Embassy Club, London, on 7 and 8 November 1980.[3] The music video was particularly dark for Madness, corresponding to the lyrical content of the song. The video mainly features Suggs at a gloomy bar, interspersed with shots of the band playing various brass instruments.\n\nAppearances\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to its single release and appearance on the album Absolutely, \"Embarrassment\" also appears on the Madness collections Divine Madness (a.k.a. The Heavy Heavy Hits), Complete Madness, It's... Madness, The Business, Our House and the US compilation Ultimate Collection.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Embarrassment\" (Barson/Thompson) - 3:10\n\n\"Crying Shame\" (Barson) - 2:36\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications and sales\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales United Kingdom (BPI)[13] Gold 500,000^\n\n^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
