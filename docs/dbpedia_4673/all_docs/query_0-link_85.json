        "text": "My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and when it’s just the two of us we get on really well. On the surface we are total opposites – I’m very outgoing, chatty and have a lot of friends, while he is very quiet and doesn’t have many friends or a social life.\n\nHe has had the same job for ever and leads a quiet, ordered life, whereas I can be a bit type A and always anxious that I’m not doing enough. He helps to calm me and is always so supportive of me. I like that he is the opposite to most of my friends who are high achievers and probably a bit competitive.\n\nThe issue is that when we go out with my friends it’s awkward and I feel embarrassed. I imagine them looking at us thinking, what is she doing with him? He wears weird clothes and can say strange things when he is under pressure. He doesn’t have a big job and a lot of my friends are very successful.\n\nHe says he’d rather I saw them without him because he doesn’t enjoy these nights out, but for some reason I keep putting pressure on him to join, even though it stresses me out too.\n\nI was single for a long time and I think I always imagined that when I was a couple we could do these couple-y things like going out for dinner with other couples and maybe even on group holidays. That won’t happen with him and I know that it shouldn’t bother me so much but it does. How do I let it go? Surely what matters is how we are when it’s just the two of us? Or does it matter to have the approval of your friends? And why, when I’m 32, am I so hung up on having friends’ approval?\n\nI feel ashamed how much I worry about what they think of him and what they, in turn, think of me. When we are out I judge him for what he’s wearing and how quiet he is, but when it’s the two of us I don’t care what he is wearing and his quietness is a relief because I can relax with him in a way that I don’t relax with many people.\n\nHilda Burke psychotherapist, couple counsellor and author of The Phone Addiction Workbook says:\n\nYou say you’ve been single for a while and perhaps in that time you’ve built up some idea of what couples do and couples don’t do. Going on couples holidays and going out with a group of all couples, that’s not something that all couples do. It’s a thing that some couples do, but it’s not by any means the norm. What matters is what works for you and your boyfriend.\n\nSo what does work for you two? That’s the main thing to think about, rather than comparing yourself with others. It seems like you have quite a strong fear of being judged and that might be something to look at. Are you afraid of others questioning your choice? If so, why does that matter to you? Is that causing you to question your choice? If so, it can be helpful to say the phrase “I choose my choice”.\n\nReminding yourself of what you like about your partner and why it works for you would be a good idea. Maybe your friends have different ideas of what constitutes a partner. They have different needs and that’s fine. They are not you. Learn to listen to yourself. If you don’t enjoy the group dynamic with your partner and he doesn’t enjoy it either, why put yourself through it?\n\nI wonder if these old friends were chosen at a different point in your life when different things were important. They are competitive and outgoing and maybe when you were younger those values were more important, but perhaps your partner is closer to your values now. Maybe he is a better fit than some of your legacy friends.\n\nHow do you feel when you are around them? You are very conscious of their response to him but are you actually, even without him, happy in those relationships?\n\nAs told to Marianne Power"
