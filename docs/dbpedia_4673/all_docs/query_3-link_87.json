        "text": "ART OUT WEST! When strolling through Slottsskogen you’ll find tons of great art made by some magnificent artists. Coinciding with Way Out West are the fashion days at the Röhsska Museum of Design & Craft in Gothenburg. With a valid Way Out West ticket, you are welcome to watch a special part of the exhibiton, co-presented by Way Out West.\n\nHere’s a presentation of the artists behind this year’s art pieces.\n\nKarin Lindgren (Likben, @likben) is a multidisciplinary designer and artist with an interest in narrative spaces, interactive & surreal worlds, and queer hybrids.\n\nTwo installations at the festival activate in-between spaces. Between dream and reality and between spaces. One is a floating bed in the small pond. The other is swings located by the large pond.\n\nGorm Boberg (b. 1968), born and raised in Gothenburg. One of Sweden’s first professional skateboarders and prominent in Swedish graffiti. Art and skateboarding have gone hand in hand in Gorm’s life. Through his many notable skateboard graphics and work with various skateboard brands over the years, his art has made a lasting impact on the skateboarding world.\n\nEllen Macke Alström (b. 1989, Falköping) lives and works in Gothenburg. Her art takes place in a figurative world, with stories about emotional life, belonging, and re-enchantment. With drawing, text, and sculpture, Ellen, after her master’s degree in fine arts, has exhibited in Gothenburg, Umeå, Stockholm, and Leipzig. She has created artwork for, among others, theater performances, punk bands, and small clothing companies. Walls are painted in various secret and non-secret locations in the city.\n\nYmer Billie (b. 2000) born and active in Gothenburg. Graduated from Dômen Art School in 2021. Ymer’s art is grotesque and embarrassing, bizarre and supernatural. Most recently exhibited at Galleri Betan in Stockholm. Friend of Way Out West Skate Garden.\n\nPernilla Åsberg & S Camilla E Boström Pernilla Åsberg is an interior/set designer/prop master with assignments in Sweden and internationally. She has mainly worked on commercial & editorial assignments as well as within events, TV & film. S Camilla E Boström is a designer MFA & artist. Best known for mural painting. She works cross-border between design and art.\n\nFor WOW, Pernilla & Camilla collaborate to create an eye-catching and “festival-like” environment with recycled textiles and bird silhouettes.\n\nDesignklubben Designklubben in Biskopsgården is a club for, with, and by children and young people in the area. Local Design Ambassadors, educators from the Röhsska Museum, explore, together with children and young people living in the area, the designed living environment to strengthen social sustainability. This year, during the summer, Design Ambassadors, children, and young people in Drakparken will create a work that will take place during the festival in Slottsskogen. The project is carried out together with the Röhsska Museum.\n\nDômen Art School Under a copper beech tree positioned below Dômen Art School, between the Azalea and Flamingo stages, you will find Dômen Art School’s festival tent.\n\nWelcome in and participate in a creative implosion of installations, pen tattoos, psychedelic colors, and general drawing fever – Make a sculpture out of clay dug up from Gothenburg’s canals, or create a portrait of Benjamin Ingrosso or your very best festival friend. Drop by and create together with the students from the school’s various departments – sculpture, graphics, and painting. Peace.\n\nHere are the pieces present at Röhsska:"
