        "text": "Shri. Yashwant Wasudeo Athalye; Ratnagiri\n\nThe First Jagannath Shankarshet Scholarship for standing first in Sanskrit at Matriculation Examination commenced from 1865, and the First recepient of the scholarship was Shri. Y. W. Athalye; a Karhaadaa! (Credit of this entry goes to Shri. Harshad Sarpotdar)\n\nShri. Shashishekhar Kashinath Athlye Guruji (Ex-MLA) Deole, Ratnagiri\n\nMany Karhaadaas gained respects and honours as the true care-takers, as MPs, MLCs and MLAs for many years till today. Necessary qualities of a people's leader are said to be his being thoroughly selfless, adhering to principles, being always objectively analytical and not surrendering to any personality cult, having a sense of responsibility, able to logically and convincingly decipher decision, unquestionable sincerity and of course the original ability to lead people. I could surely point out such a personality, a very much living and exemplary ideal for all those functioning as representatives of people in legislative councils of States or the Nation, in whom all these qualities are as if conglomerated! Only one example I would quote of this 98 years old living legendary personality!\n\nFor 15 years he was the MLA from Ratnagiri/Lanja area and was a true and most effective elected member of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, Mumbai. He appeared such a simple personality due to his clothes that he was once mistook as being a helper in Parel State Transport Bus Station. A bus traveller asked him to put his luggage on the top of the bus. When the work was accomplished he was not taking the money being offered by the traveller for the job. Mr. Athlye Guruji refused to take it saying \"I have done my duties to help a needy person\". The traveller was puzzled. A person from a distance recognised Shri. Athlye Guruji and rushed to the spot and flayed the person who asked the MLA to put the luggage on the top. The Guruji calmed him down. The traveller really regretted a lot!\n\nEven to see such a personality creates in you a feeling of being honoured! His wealth, naturally is the wealth in the form of qualities - which I have mentioned above; and which has no value in todays naked practicality! Guruji, I am really proud of you! You are the known one and selectively First and extreme example of honour among elected personalities of people!\n\nShri. Bhaskarbuva Bakhle - Baroda, Pune\n\nThe First Indian Classical Music maestro in whom there was a confluence of three noted classical music gharanas (Classical Music Styles named on place of origin) and they were - Gwalior, Jaipur and Agra; is Bakhle Buva.\n\nThe First musicologist who realised the importance of music which provides primarily entertainment and further is the cause of containtment and there, it should be attractive in its tonal culture or tonality! He is the First to introduce the beauty of music to the masses. He brought the musical beauty from palaces and closed rooms to public platform like Marathi stage. In Maharashtra, the \"stage song\" has become the distinctive semi-classical or light music variety for which the credit goes to this greatest visionary, who popularised music among common man and trained their ears for the same through Marathi stage for drama. For this the credit goes as per the impartial music lovers are convinced, mainly to the incessant efforts of this great Pandit Bhaskarbuva Bakhle and a line of his disciples like Kesharbai Kerkar, Bal Gandharva, Madam Shirodkar, Master Krishnarao, Bapusaheb Ketkar and so many other great artists. It was said in Northern India that in the world of music, there was only one Bhaskar (The Sun). This high appreciation befittingly denotes his place in the field of music.\n\nInterested people may like to read the article of eminent critic of musicians and music, Shri. P. L. Deshpande who compared Bhaskarbuva Bakhle's place with other known contemporary musicologists in Maharashtra with highly spirited and profound appreciation for Pandit Bhaskarbuva Bakhle. Bhaskarbuva was known among deconditioned and real music lovers as a divine or celestial singer, the \"DEVAGANDHARVA\". These are people with free and frank heart who after realising that it is never possible to see such a great artist on this earth, he is described as Godly person and his art is heavenly i.e. celestial! Panditji, on this thorny land full of chronic jealousy and cultivated wickedness for qualitative people, there are some oases, like Shri. P. L. Deshpande, Shri. Wamanrao Deshpande etc. who even after many years of your departure, heartily remember your unforgettable and unparallel qualities.\n\nShri. C. S. Bakhle, ICS, New Delhi\n\nThe First commissioner (Chief) of Indian Railways was Shri. C. S. Bakhle, ICS.\n\nShri. B. R. Bhagwat, Kasheli, Mumbai, Pune; Death-27-10-2005\n\nHe was the honourable and popular writer for children, wrote more than 175 books for Children. He was the First elected president of the Child Literary gathering for Marathi child writers. His literary child hero \"Faster Phene\" was very popular among children. Popularly known in Marathi circles as \"Bhaa Raa Bhagwat\"!\n\nDr. Kamalaa Bhagwat, Mumbai; Death - 8-9-1997\n\nThe First Indian woman scientist Dr. Smt. Kamalaa Bhagwat comes from the eminent Karhaada scholarly house of Pandit Rajaramshastri Bhagwat from Kasheli, Taluka Rajapur, District Ratnagiri. Her sister was another great scholastic personality Smt. Durga Bhagwat. Dr. Kamalaa Bhagwat married to one Mr. Sohoni, a chitpavan and became Kamal Sohoni. Her genotype is a Karhaadaa family which is a very spirited and refined family which has history of scholarship for 900 years. It is said that just for seeing her ancestor Pandit Govind Bhagwat, the Shilahar King Bhoja II visited Kasheli village. She was the eminence of this family!\n\nShri. Sakharam Harishchandra Bhatavadekar alias Save Dada - Mumbai\n\nHe was a still photographer and equipment dealer who had his studio at the Kennedy Bridge in Mumbai (Bombay). He was the First Indian film maker. The films shot by Sawe Dada were two short documentary films Â— The Wrestlers and Man & Monkey both released in November 1899.\n\nDr. R. G. Bhatavadekar, New Delhi\n\nVery eminent metallurgist and founder of \"Indian Metallurgical Association\". He was a fellow of Royal Institute of Metallurgy, London. He was the First Maharashtrian Chairman of Indian Railway Public Service Commission. He was a metallurgical advisor to the Tata Company and the Kirloskar Company. Late Prime Minister of India Shri. Lal Bahadur Shastri had aptly described him as the \"Diamond of Indian Railways\". Dr. Bhatavadekar was the First also to receive this type of valued appreciation from the visionary and ever great Prime Minister of India.\n\nShri. Chakrapani alias Changdeva Raul - Phaltan, District Satara - Dwarka\n\nBorn on the 9th day of Ashwin 1121 AD at Phaltan, prior to Sant Shri. Jnaneshwar by several decades, Shri. Chakrapani Raul was the First greatest ever known yogi who had initiated 52 eminent disciples and hundreds of others elevated to spiritual field. He was the First saint propounding the principles of casteless society about 900 years before us and established the Mahaanubhaava panth in spirituality. Please read more about him in the earlier chapter (Karhaadaa Inheritance)\n\nShri. Wasudeva Gopal Chirmulye, Satara\n\nA legendary and illustrious personality respectfully remembered even today for his enterprising, courageous nature and for his tenacity in carrying out his dreams about economic factual progress which does not remain limited to learned gossips in closed doors. He was truely the ever greatest visionary. The First founder of Insurance company established in Satara and also the founder of the First Maharashtrian Bank - The United Western Bank Ltd., in Satara. On his name an award of Rs. One Lakh has been annually given to eminent personalities like Dr. Manmohan Singh, Dr. Raghunath Mashelkar and alike.\n\nWe salute this ever great outwardly simple but inwardly Himalayan visionary personality coming from a very qualitative Karhaadaa community!\n\nShri. Sakharam Ganesh Deuskar, Kolkata [1869 - 1912]\n\nAnother great name of honour is Shri. S. G. Deuskar, editor of \"Hitawaad\", a Bengali language daily. He is the First Maharashtrian editor of a Bengali Newspaper.\n\nKarhaadaas have been prominently spread in Northern India whose contribution in socio-cultural fields including constructive politics is respectfully remembered even today. Bharatratna Pandit Govind Vallabh Pant Paradkar of Gadhwal, Shri. L. N. Garde and Shri. Baburaoji Paradkar of Benaras, Shri. Anand Laxman Khandekar from Kota - Rajasthan, the editor of \"Rashtradoota\" a Hindi daily, The Newalkar family, Tambe family, Dike family, Pandit Gunye from Gwalior - Guru in classical music of Amjad Ali Khan (Sarod maestro), Dr. Tatke a great surgeon from Guna, Shri. Nawathey and Shri. Nawalekar from Jabalpur, Shri. Shriniwas Hardikar, a great historian from Kanpur, Dr. Padmashree Shalinitai Moghe, Sarawatye, Bhavalkar from Indore, Shree. Seetarampant Kher and Sudhakar raoji Mulye from Sagar, Shree. Narayan rao Krishna Shejwalkar and his son Shri. Vivek ji both of them were Mayors of Gwalior Municipal Corporation, Shri. G. V. Mavalankar and his son Purushottam G. Mavalankar, Shri. Mukund Sakharam Newalkar, speaker of MP State, Shri. Hemchandra Khandekar, Parliamentary Secretary, Shri. Laxman Atmaram Katdare, a Senior Communist Leader, New Delhi, Sardar Madhav rao Kibe from Indore, Padmabhooshan and the constitution committee member Shri. V. S. Sarawate, Shri. Pitre from Allahabad, ever great Sanskrit Pandits - Pandit Krishna Bhatta Bakhale (1583), Pandit Bhairava Bhatta Kowai (1582), Pandit Vasudeva Bhatta Kowai (1031), Pandit Narayan Bhatta Ardye (1640) really really countless is this list and I am sure my Karhaadaa brothers and sisters will be happy to learn that this tradition is kept up with the same glitterance and majesty by many Karhaadaas in other states also.\n\nA group of Karhaadaa Brahmanas was there in Benaras and their leader's signature was required on all most important religious documents. Dr. Indumati Tikekar, one of the greatest social thinkers and social workers is presently functioning in Himachal Pradesh. In his speech at Tilak Smarak Mandir, Pune on 28-2-2000, Dr. Sunderlalji Bahuguna told the audience that \"while experiencing closely the ceaseless social work of Dr. Indumati Tikekar I feel that even today, Maharashtra is alive!\" The founder of Nagari Pracharini Sabha, Benaras, Shri. Madhavrao ji Sapre was from Raypur, Justice Mulye, Justice Golwalkar, Justice Tambe, Justice Deo, Justice Hardikar and poets like B. R. Tambe, Shri. R. A. Kalele are all ... all these are the illustrious Karhaadaas. Let us be proud of all those as our illustrious ancestors, who have not been known for creating intimidating atmosphere, nor even for the attitudes full of baseness and contemptous disgusting culture! Many of these people are so assimilated with local people that even these people, I am afraid, might not be distinctively aware of the fact that they belong to the great Karhaadaa community migrated from Maharashtra and Karnataka. I remember these names with utmost respect for their qualities which are distinctively the qualities of Karhaadaa genotypes. They are free from contentious feelings and not based on hatred for others born out of false superiority complexes cultivated generations after generations! Let us be worthy and deserving to understand their distinctive inborn qualities and openly appreciate the same.\n\nShri. Kashinath Narayan Deexit; Mumbai/ Delhi\n\nThe First Director General of \"Archeological Survey of India\". Even the idea of having an Institute by this name was that of Shri. Deexit only. He was very studious and having profound scholarship in several fields.\n\nDr. Vijay Dhavale - Mumbai, Canada\n\nThe eminent citizens of Canada were felicitated on the occasion of completion of 100 years of Canada's independance and then again, on the occassion of completing 50 years of Britain's Queen ascending the throne. The First Maharashtrian who was felicitated both the times was Dr. Vijay Dhawale. Again when Canada observed 125 years of independance in 1992, he was awarded a Gold medal with appreciation of his service to humanity. Dr. Dhawale was the First Asian to have received the medal twice.\n\nA man of principle, patriotic, an orator, politico-social-cultural worker, cricket, chess & carrom player, researcher, connected with 16 social organisations, has bagged 63 prizes (by 2003) in his insurance business, has a company for advising investments, journeys 3 lakh miles yearly. He collected Rs. 40 crores for the earthquake affected people in Gujarat. A real conglomeration of many humanitarian qualities. The Brihan Maharashtra Mandal of North America had honoured him with \"The most outstanding Maharashtrian among Marathi speaking community\". His father was a renowned engineer in a public company which built the bridge on the river Yamuna.\n\nLet us follow this path trodden by personalities like Dr. Vijay Dhavale.\n\nShri. Ashutosh Gowarikar; Mumbai\n\nBelonging to the Karhaadaa community, he is the ablest and First Maharashtrian Cine Director, whose film reached the final round of Oscar awards. After Raja Nawathey, Gowarikar has proved his artisitic direction coupled with illustrious management. (Credit of this entry goes to Shri. Harshad Sarpotdar)\n\nShri. Jagannath Gangadhar Shastri Gunye, alias Swami Kuvalayananda; Lonavala/Pune\n\nShri. Swamiji's full name is as given above and he was a great and kind yogi. After taking Sanyas, he became Swami Kuvalayananda. An erudite yogi, he was the First in establishing an altogether different type of Institute for learning and researching in \"Paatanjala Yogavidyaa\". We see nowadays that abundant shops under the label of Yoga have opened and they have spread the notion that Yoga means learning acrobatics! While Paatanjali Yoga-vidya is dealing with the subject of disciplining, regulating, purifying and improving the mind quality and innate of individual for realising his own esential nature. The various asanaas or body-postures are 1/8th part of yoga pertaining to the body and Patanjali, out of his 195 rules presented in formulative language in his book, has summed up the bodily posture in three rules only. An ever great and person with erudition Shri. Gunye's contribution to Yogavidyaa is one of the pioneering in India. I have experienced as to how a disproportionate publicity through strong journalistic movement was managed to a publicised person. He is unable to differentiate between ritualistic and spiritualtic activities; leaving a message for thinkers that any illogical utterances of this type of made great persons could easily be sold in the already infatuated market of masses and real gems like Shri. Gunye remained in dark forever, as there is no managed publicity!\n\nShri. Laxman Shastri Maheshwar Halbe, Wai\n\nThe Fist novel \"Muktaamaalaa\" in Marathi, which is a beautiful fiction of Marathi literature is written by Shri. Halbe. Its topic was widow marriage.\n\nDr. Ashutosh Awadhoot Hardikar, Pune\n\nRare it is, in my knowledge, to always claim the First rank with more than distinction marks and also with a Gold Medal (in surgery) - in continuously succeeding examinations, without any gap for any reason in the higher examinations conducted by different Universities/Institutes, commencing with MBBS, MS, DNB, MCH. First two exams from Pune University, DNB from Delhi and MCH from Bombay University with record marks. He is also FRCS (Glasgow, England).\n\nAny sensible father will be proud of his son having such a glittering academic record with superb skills in cardiothorasic surgery. A very good orater and a very successful cardiac surgeon. He has gained fruitful experience in Adelaide, Australia for about 4 years and presently is with Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, Pune. He is also attached with several Hospitals as a honourary visiting Surgeon. I am truely proud of him!\n\nTill the time his father, i.e. myself comes to know about anyone prior to my son having successfully gone through with the same glitterance, I thought, let his name be included in the galaxy of most qualitative Karhaadaa personalities who are Firsts in several fields. Recently in a public lecture arranged in a big compact hall of Tilak smarak Mandir. Pune, a selfless eminent personality described Dr. Ashutosh Hardikar as the \"Rising Star\". Appreciations received from many other corners complelled me to include his name in this list, not because he is my son but because of his unparallel proven qualities!\n\nPadmabhushan Dr. Narayan Subbarao Hardikar, Tilawalli/Ghataprabha; Birth - 7-5-1889\n\nFor selfless and devoted service of the Nation, the youth is required to be disciplined and trained, right from its childhood, its moulding age. Then alone the required force for selfless service for the Nation could be constantly provided with. This truth was long back conceived by a visionary and ever great personality Dr. N. S. Hardikar. He established for this purpose the First Indian organisation of vibrant and dedicated youth called \"Hindusthani Seva Dal\" in the year 1923 at Nagpur. This novel concept was backed by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Unfortunately, many leaders of the then Congress party including Mahatma Gandhi could not forsee the importance of this type of training for youth. Some of them were even opposing the idea. As a result, it could not be possible for Dr. Hardikar to go ahead with his plans. People are aware that the same Nagpur saw in 1924 a political party established there called \"Hindu Mahasabha\" and in 1925 on Dasara the Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangha (RSS). Dr. N. S. Hardikar's efforts, sincerety, devotion and dedication was amply praised by Pt. Nehru, which we can read through their correspondence. He was, the first visionary to have realised the importance of preparing the dedicated youth, full of determination and undeviated love and faith for service of the Nation. The force of youth could be utilised for building constructive National character, which is the most essential thing for any Nation. The want of which could be the problem in future and this was first understood by this great son of the soil Dr. N. S. Hardikar. The Government of India issued a postal stamp in his memory.\n\nThe most revered and Godly personality Shri. Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar Guruji had cultivated the same culture and was the supreme cause for steadily and practically expanding RSS for a prolonged period of 33 years through his incessant and tireless efforts through thorny political, social and cultural conditions.\n\nShri. Balshastri Jambhekar, Pombhurle/Mumbai, Birth - 20-2-1812; Death - 17-05-1846\n\nThe ever great person from whom only the rennaissance of modern Maharashtra commenced, is late Shri. Balshastri Jambhekar. This could be stated very safely from his view points, vigorous and intellectual activities in the socio-cultural-religious fields, which were planned, guided and actively participated by this greatest ever son of the soil. Many impartial thinkers and persons free from the clutches of any sort of complexes like late Shri. Mahadeo Govind Ranade, Shri. Y. D. Phadke, have amply eulogised late Shri. Balshastri Jambhekar's contributions in several fields of human activities. Shri. Y. D. Phadke lamented that Shri. Balshastri Jambhekar's contributions in several fields was not remembered, later on debated and denied even. But it is Mr. Y. D. Phadke, who called him \"Navavicharanche Janak; yanchya pasoon navavichaar suru hotaat\" to say \"He was the father of new thought in Maharashtra and from him alone new thought commenced\"! How many Firsts could we enumerate on his name? How could thinkers even among Karhaadaas have altogether forgotten him?\n\ni. He was the First who propagated importance of indigenous (swadeshi) productions. In 1834, in his monthly magazine \"Digdarshan\", he emphasises, \"aayatit vastoomule aapale ajnan prakatate va apakeerti hote\" i.e. \"because of imported things, which itself is the manifestation of our ignorance in several fields becomes vivid and brings us disgrace\".\n\nii. He was the First Native State Education Officer of Bombay State\n\niii. He was the First Native Secretary at his Age of 19\n\niv. He was the First Native, graded as Professor\n\nv. He was the First Director of Colaba observatory\n\nvi. The First Marathi newspaper \"Darpan\" was edited and published by him on 6-1-1832\n\nvii. Father of renaissance, responsible for bringing modernity in Maharashtra. In that respect too, he was the only & First.\n\nviii. The First marathi grammar book in the format of dialogue written by him in 1836 for children [In the province of Marathi grammer, the three persons Dadoba Tarkhadkar, Gangadhar Shastri Phadke and Balshastri Jambhekar are called Munitraya i.e. three great seers]. The popularity of the book could be known by the fact that by 1863 this book had seen 14 editions ix. He was also the First to start a bilingual newspaper in Marathi and English\n\nHe was a very eminent thinker, educationist, was master of several languages and even was the most respected and treated as Guru by the grand father of this nation - late Shri. Dadabhai Navaroji, Shri. Kerunaanaa Chhatre, Bhau Daji, Mandlik and Kashinath Shastri Telang among others, who were his students. Either suffering from the jaundice of caste, position, ego-gained superiority complexes or due to overpowering wickedness for more qualitative people which has become an inseparable quality as it were, it is not possible for us to remember the contribution and the intrinsic qualities of these type of persons. We are skillful in praising others provided if there is some benefit in sight, but we are very much lacking in appreciating the quality. Even in an advertisement of a 24 hours Marathi News Channel currently shown, although Lokmanya Tilak was born three decades after the birth of Darpan (and five decades after Balshastri), he is shown first and Balshastri Jambhekar is purposefully shown second from Tilak. Implying that Lokmanya Tilak was the first, thereby breaking all the norms of chronological principles. Why?\n\nTo sum-up one could state that in this imperfect world and full of relativity, Balshastri Jambhekar attained the pinnacle of perfection in many fields. Had there not been one Mr. Gangadhar Jambhekar, an educationist thinker and a true family lover, who brought out Late Balshastri's biography in three volumes, the robbers possessing hyena-mentality in their thorny forest of culture would have by now, established someone from their own community as the first marathi journalist like they did in other several fields of human activities. Interested bretheren may please read the biography, not for entertainment but to learn as to how the enriched potential of unkind and wicked mentality works for their gains; without bothering for any norm of human-society including truth! It is really becoming to their boastful, but known culture!\n\nThe great contribution for which Indian Astrology owes a lot to late Balshastri Jambhekar is his replacement of original Greek mythological names given to arbitrary configurations of stars (constellations. In his days the number was 88, now it is established as 110) useful for star gazing/mapping etc. No reference of these is stressed in Vaidik literature. It is the intuitive intelligence of erudite Jambhekar to study them deeply and thoroughly and had given them new terminology that suits Indian mythology rather than Greek mythology. The constellation (Nakshatram) is an arbitrary configuration of stars. These stars have been given names suitable to Indian thought. For example, the Punarvasu constellation has four stars, out of which two stars named from Greek mythology were Craster and Polax. Pandit Balashastri named them as \"KASHA\" and \"PLAXA\". Likewise, he had given an Indianised names to these stars. He was in this, the First great Indian scholar having vision and originality and not a mere follower or copier.\n\nPadmashree Vasant Shankar Kanetkar, Nasik; Death: 3-1-2001\n\nThe First marathi playwright who wrote Forty plays and dominated Marathi stage for Fifty years was Professor Vasantrao Kanetkar, worthy son of illustrious father Poet Girish, alias Shankar Keshav Kanetkar. He was respectfully regarded as a prominent personality in both Marathi literature & Marathi drama and known for creating his era on Marathi stage. Most of his plays were staged by another ever great Karhaadaa and most respected actor Shri. Prabhakar Panshikar, on whose name the Government of Maharashtra has constituted an annual award with effect from July 2006 of Rs. One Lakh for the best actors on Marathi stage. Shri. V. S. Kanetkar was without parallel among his predecessors in presenting with utmost delicacy, the interwoven and mostly subtle and complicated relations of human beings. He used his capabilities to establish new norms of behavioural attitudes and solving them with tender care and thereby creating altogether independent style of presentation of human relations! Shri. Kanetkar earned his name as \"Era\" establisher. On the name of Shri. Vasant Kanetkar, a big award for playawriters is constituted in Nashik.\n\nPandit Bhalachandra Shastri Karambelkar, Rajapur - Pune\n\nMany Vaidik books have been preserved through not the books but through the oral memorising system. Only when paper was discovered and available in the market, the writing down of Vaidik literature has come into practice. Even then, only the Vaidik Mantras and Vaidik Hymns have been written. There are some other ways for preserving such as keeping them memorised word by word and they are called \"vikrities\" that is the specific ways made for preserving Vedas. They are Padapaatha, Jataa, Krama, Ghana. These things are not in written form. Only the mantras are kept in written. Only the Shakala branch of Rigveda has 10,586 mantras. The book of the mantras is called \"Samhitaa\".\n\nThe need was felt First time by great Vaidik scholar Shri. Bhalachandra Shastri Karambelkar and it had become his life time job. A thankless, without appreciation and tedious job, without any aid or publicity or help. The lone task very First time in the world. I have all the respects in the world for these ever great people. A Himalayan work! Even if one receives the idea, he would crumble down!\n\nShri. Vishnoo Sakharam Khandekar, Shiroda, Sawantwadi, Kolhapur\n\nHe was the First Jnanapeeth Award winning Maharashtrian for Marathi literary excellence, perceived by noble hearted impartial committee members for the same, selecting his novel \"YAYAATI\" as a peak of his literary creations. Yes, we have to give credit to the selection committee members who must have defeated all the opponents creating obstacles in declaring his name. I do vividly remember Acharya Atre, when interviewed as to how he got the first award for his Marathi movie \"Shamchi Aai\" in 1952, he told the interviewer \"because on the committee, there might have been no one from Maharashtra to oppose it\". A very much pious, noble, straightforward, super sensitive and majestic ever great connoisseur Padmabhooshan Shri. V. S. Khandekar was a model literary figure for many up and coming future generation people! Many South Indians in my knowledge, have named their children as \"Khandekar\" as the boys first name, a tribute to this great respectful personality!! The Government of India had issued a postal stamp on his great son!\n\nThe human life was the subject of his conscious mind. A human life, is a constantly and progressively ever changing phenomenon. In this world, full of relativity of which human life is an unforgettable chief constituent, and hence it is with full of delicacy one should try to perceive the complexities of human life. Naturally, the Art which is a creation of humans i.e. which he has created for his own entertainment is not and cannot escape from this relativity and is secondary to human life; since its utility is for the human being. Therefore, the hypothetical thinking i.e. Art is for Art sake which presupposes, the supreme importance of Art and not the man for whom it exists is a thinking of infatuated mind. Any artistic creation has got a purpose and that is to make the things easily acceptable. Hence the need is to make or present the thing artistically viable. In literature, a thought useful for life is presented artistically and in such a process the thought in literature takes help of Art. The whole process is conducted to increase the acceptability of the thought. Hence as compared to human-life which is progressively enriched by self thinking & by thoughts of great thinkers, the position of Art is evidently secondary - i.e. helping to increase acceptability. Hence Art is for enriching human-life. Literature of any community of any country is very much useful for improving the standard of culture of the society. If we become unmindful about this then the very purpose of literature will be irrepairably damaged.\n\nHe was also the First short essay writer of Marathi literature (=Laghunibandhakaara) according to the critic of Marathi literature Prof. Anand Yadav, an impartial and true critic who had exposed some established sciolists and writers on the basis of logical inferences based on facts. He had shown in his article in daily \"Sakal\" dated 25-1-1997 as to how taking the name of Professor N. S. Phadke as the first Marathi short essay writer is wrong.\n\nIt is interesting to note, a point for inclusion in the history of Marathi literature, about persons who propagated, as it were, some writers and uplifted them to the status of ever great writer, then corrected their own opinion by writing another article and also a series of articles to prove as to how they were actually not so great! One Mr. Kolhatkar who vehemently proved Prof. N. S. Phadke as the \"Yugapurush\" writer i.e. a \"great writer of the era\", had later on erased his opinion by publishing a series of articles in \"Sobat\" a Marathi weekly, edited by Shri. Behere and proved as to how Mr. Phadke was a poor one, both first as a person and then a writer also. Another person is Shri. G. T. Madkholkar, Ex Editor, Tarun Bharat, Nagpur who had earlier appreciated Keshavasuta and later on withdrew his opinion by writing another article to show as to how he was not so.\n\n\"Keshavasuta\" is a nickname of poet Shri. Krishnaji Keshav Damle, whom the intelligent Marathi history writers had established as the first \"Modern Marathi poet\". A very intelligent move to eliminate the really great poets like Mukteshvara, Raghunath Pandit, Kavi Waman, Shri. Moropant Paradkar, Saint Shri. Jnaneshwar, Saint Shri. Tukaram Maharaj and many others including Sant Ramdas etc. and establish the man of their interest. This was done maybe since he belonged to their own caste; as none in the list of great Marathi poets was a poet of their caste. The term Adhunik is created for Shri. Damle. Nowadays even this term is dropped. The term ADHUNIK has according to them, got unimaginable elasticity. Infact, the novelty of Marathi poetry considering its rate of depiction, emotions, delineation, imaginative beauty, striking elements, charm, perception, feelings being free from dimension of place and time, durability - in all respects Shri. Bhaskar Ramachandra Tambe's poetry was superceding and of better quality, and had become the model for several poets who got inspiration from him. But since he was a Karhaadaa, he was naturally dropped from consideration. If Keshavasuta belonging to the 19th century is ADHUNIK then who is the ADHUNIK of the 20th century? The natural reply of the names like Mardhekar, Suresh Bhatt, Sudhir Moghe will not be acceptable and hence the intelligentia is sleeping as it were.\n\nLeaving all these stories of dirty politics aside on which the acceptibility, recognition and durability of the poetry and the poets' names are not at all dependant and which is simply displaying the negative quality of cultural atmosphere; let us get ourselves introduced with the real yardsticks of anthropomorphic critical observation not bothering what these people say. And then we find a very few names remain on paper, among them the following Karhaadaa names representing the quality about which I have mentioned above are given here. They are really born great poets, never shadowed by even an iota of this type of artificially made poets or writers and one will find that their greatness was not an imposed one! They are Moropant Paradkar, V. S. Khandekar, Kalele, Kavi Girish, Vasant Kanetkar, Durga Bhagwat, Suresh Bhatt, Anand Sadhale, Madhav Keshav Katdare, Kavi Pandit Sapre, Sudheer Moghe, Anant Shevade, D. V. Potdar, G. T. Madkholkar and many many others.\n\nThe writing of V. S. Khandekar had enlivened the spirit and strong will of many towards life, as to how to look at it without surrendering the transitory feelings and at the same time imbibing within us the value of true humane emotions. To lead life not with frustration but with grace and imperial charm. Such people adorn prestigous Awards rather than the Award adorning them! Even while presenting this award, a person present on the dias and claiming to have brought Khandekar in the limelight was rushing forward, but the President came forward and felicitated Khandekar only himself. That was the grace of the Award! As usual, a writer in Marathi, used to comment on till recently as to how the Jnanapeeth Awardees (Khandekar and Shirwadkar) for Marathi were not upto the mark. He is seemingly unaware that people in general have learnt by now, as how and why not to frame a mind-set by uninhibited and apparently intelligent guided opinions!\n\nShri. Bal Gangadhar Kher - Ratnagiri, Mumbai\n\nThe First Chief Minister (then designated as Prime Minister) of the then Bombay State Shri. B. G. Kher, was an eminent Judicial expert and a true Gandhian Social Worker. The First Chief minister, when expired, was in debt of the Bank. He was also the First High Commissioner to Great Britian, selected from Maharashtra. The First Chief Minister who was a vibrant scholar of Bombay University and was awarded the Zala Vedant Prize for standing First in M.A. examination, was thousand miles away from self-interest. A true model of the Gandhian concept of trusteeship, he was very much away from publicity. The best ever administrator, it was not possible for his detractors to drown him even after several socio-political and adminstrative tactics.\n\nShri. Sharad Kirane (Bhagwat); Mumbai\n\nAradhana Travels is his company and through this he is the First travel agent to organise tours to Far East regions like Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Leh, Ladakh and Cambodia, Vietnam, China etc. (Credit of this entry goes to Shri. Harshad Sarpotdar)\n\nShri. Balawant Pandurang alias Annasaheb Kirloskar - Gurlhassor/Pune\n\nThe First marathi play staged for general public, was a translation of Kalidasa's \"Abhijnan Shakuntal\" in Pune on 31-10-1880 in the present day Vijay theatre. This was the real beginning of Marathi stage in which music played a prominent role and was in the true sense a play. He wrote several plays, formed a company for presenting Marathi plays called \"Kirloskar Natak Company\". The base and aim of the company was to entertain public in general and it was because of this that Marathi stage flourished with eminent actors, singers, music composers and that period was in the real sense a dawn of Marathi stage. The period dominated by Annasaheb Kirloskar is known as the \"Kirloskar era\".\n\nShri. Laxmanrao Kirloskar - Kirloskarwadi\n\nHe was the father of the ever great Industrialist and visionary, Padmabhushan Shri. Shantanurao Kirloskar. He was the First great visionary for Industrial development of Maharashtra in particular and India in general. He established the Kirloskar company in the year 1889. This company has celebrated its centenary. The great visionary, unparallal entrepreneur and illustrious father figure for many began his production for village farmers from the small bullock pulled, traditional ploughing instrument to the water pump. A middle class, pious and devoted family engaged in preserving Indological sciences including vedas sprung up to the status of empire providing jobs for more than sixty thousand workers, and many small companies could grow well under their umbrella. He was the inspiring spirit for many Maharashtrians. The Government of India issued a postal stamp in memory of Shri. Laxmanrao Kirloskar and the Kirloskar company centenary in 1989.\n\nPadmabhushan Shri. Shantanurao L. Kirloskar; Pune\n\nHe was a visionary Maharashtrian Industrialist and chiefly responsible for creating an empire of the great Kirloskar family. A fruitful and creative visionary. It was basically a family company and till this nature of the company was intact, due to very much sincere, loyal, faithful, trustworthy, devoted with love, spirited force of Karhaadaas was there - like Shri. Shambhurao Jambhekar, Shri. Nanasaheb Gurjar, Shri. C. R. Bondre, Shri. Tikekar, Shri. Hardikar and many many others, the grace of the company was always in ascending order. The company, under the leadership of this vibrant visionary was among the first twenty industrial companies of India and we used to be proud to read even a line about them in the Newspapers. The Government of India released a stamp in memory of Shri. Shantanurao Kirloskar in 2003.\n\nShri. Nitin Kirtane; Pune; Born-1975\n\nHe was the First in claiming the National Championship thrice in Tennis in the under 16 age-group. He was also the champion on elderly group at National level in 1996, defeating Shri. Wasudeva Ruddy. A superb phenomenon also First of its kind, that all three brothers Sandeep, Nitin and Salil are champions in Tennis only. The Karhaadaas!\n\nShri. Vinayak Janardan Kirtane - Pune\n\nThe First man who was eminently known prior to the Kirloskar era and dominated Marathi stage for 18-20 years for presenting prose dramas, was Shri. V. J. Kirtane. His first play was on an independant subject and not that of a translation titled as \"Thorale Madhavrao Peshawe\" published in 1861 and staged in 1862 by Ichalkaranjikar Natak Company. His prolonged essay on Marathi Bakhar, was also the first of its kind. It was published in 1867 AD and had given him a high status in the historian circle. Shri. Wasudeo Shastri Khare was inspired in his youth because of Shri. Keertane's bakhar and decided to make a career in historical research.\n\nShri. G. T. Madkholkar, Sawantwadi/Nagpur, ( - 27-11-1976)\n\nHe was the editor of \"Tarun Bharat\", a popular Marathi daily from Nagpur. Eminent thinker and known as socio politico-literacy avtivist, Shri. Madkholkar was the First novelist, whose novels in marathi are chiefly dealing with the politico-socio subjects based on entertainment principle.\n\nShri. Balawant Ramachandra Manerikar; Mumbai\n\nShri. B. R. Manerikar was the First Editor-Publisher of a Marathi monthly magazine. The name of this monthly magazine was \"Induprakaash\". He was earlier the Chief Secretary (Diwan) of Indore State.\n\nShri. Keshavrao Mavalankar - Mumbai, Pune, London\n\nIn the Hammar Smith area of London (Britian) on the banks of the river Thames, Shri. Keshavrao Mavalankar established his factory \"Pheonix Chemical Works\". He was the First Maharashtrian to start an Industry in Foreign countries, specially in Britian in the year 1920 AD. He was a teacher in N. M. V. High School, Pune. He owned two factories and three houses in London. It was Shri. Mavalankar's idea to start the Institute \"Indian Chamber of Commerce\" in London and under his guidance and effective leadership, the \"Chambers\" came up. I salute the enterprising spirit of Shri. Keshavrao Mavalankar!\n\nShri. Ganesh Wasudeva Mavalankar - Ratnagiri, Ahmedabad\n\nThe First speaker of the then Bombay State Legislative Assembly and also the First speaker of Lok Sabha. The Mavalankar Hall of Delhi Parliament House is in the memory of this First speaker. He was a very eminent pleader and True Social Worker. As all Deshastha Brahmanas residing in Konkan from historical period have maintained their separate identity and even existance of community name; the hypothetical inference arrived at, even by Shri. Vishnupant Athalye in his book in Marathi called \"History of Karhade Brahmans\" that this Mavalankar family is originally Deshastha Barhmanas etc. holds no ground. They are as true Karhaadaas as Athlye, Tembye, Moghe, Kher etc. though happened to migrate from \"Desh\" area to \"Konkan\" area. Even their whole family is firm in this traditional notion.\n\nShri. Gaurav Natekar, Mumbai\n\nHe was the First in winning Two Gold Medals in Tennis in the Asian games of 1994. He was also the champion in the under 16 tournament in 1989; and First in the Tennis final of 1992. The final match was between two Karhaadaas only - Shri. Sandeep Kirtane and Shri. Gaurav Natekar! He was a recipient of the Arjun Award at the National level also.\n\nShri. Nandu Natekar, Mumbai/Pune\n\nA very much respected and noted personality in Badminton. The First Arjun Award was awarded to him in the year of its commencement in 1961. Here is a pleasant confluence of an eminent player and genuinely good natured illustrious personality! He is a model as to how a noted person keeps himself up with modesty! Below is a list of his achievements:\n\nSix times national singles badminton champion, four times runner-up\n\nSix times national doubles badminton champion, three times runner-up\n\nThree times national mixed doubles badminton champion\n\nWon a total of 134 national badminton titles, singles, doubles and mixed doubles\n\nWon the Kings Cup badminton championships in Bangkok in 1963\n\nWon the Selangor and Merdeka championships in Malaysia\n\nRepresenting India in the Thomas Cup, won 12 singles matches from a total of 16 in just the 1954 - 55 season\n\nWinner of the Arjuna award in 1961\n\nRunner-up to Ramananthan Krishnan in the national hard court tennis championships in 1951\n\nShri. Harshavardhan Vinayak Nawathe; Ghatkopar, Mumbai\n\nThere is hardly anyone among Maharashtrian, nay Indian youth who has not heard his name. Claiming at the very First time Rs. One Crore in a competition conducted by Star Plus TV under the title \"Kaun Banega Carodpati\" - \"Who would become the owner of a Crore\". This was a contest open for public in general of judging the General Knowledge and intelligence of the person participating in the contest. In this competition, the First winner at the very First time was Shri. H. V. Nawathey, a young lad from Mumbai on 19-10-2000. This program was seen all over India. Even in this type of competition the Karhaadaa proved his mettle.\n\nPadmavibhushan Dr. Jayant Vishnu Naralikar; Kolhapur, Benaras, Pune\n\nOne of the greatest scholars in the field of Mathematics, Astrophysics and Astronomy and Scientist of repute is Wrangler Dr. J. V. Naralikar. After slightly understanding the eminence of Dr. J. V. Naralikar alone, I could understand the meaning of the dictum \"Logic and Mathematics are basic Sciences\"! His paternal and maternal heritage is known for learning in several fields and branches of human knowledge. His father Wrangler Dr. Vishnupant Naralikar, brother Wrangler Dr. Anant Naralikar and mother a great scholar of Sanskrit coming from reputed Hujurbazar (= Shrikhande) family of Kolhapur. Maternal uncle and former HOD of Pune University Professor Hujurbazar was a reputed mathematician. Through many angles, the ever shining and glittering star Dr. Jayant Naralikar was the First chosen Director of \"Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics\", Pune (IUCAA). He came to the International platform of eminent scientists because of Havel-Naralikar theory in Astrophysics. Seldom is there any personality nearing him in comparison to the wealth he is receiving in the form of Internationally acclaimed scholarship, honours and respects from several Institutes of world repute and public appreciation in general, worldwide. Gone is the memory of that personality, continually eulogised locally at that time (inserted in the news everytime about Dr. Narlikar used to appear in the media). An interesting thing even in the world of scholarship was, as to how even the befittingly earned name and not created or managed fame through media is not digestible due to traditional malevolence very deeply rooted for greater and true quality! However, this method was clever enough to impose on public mind the falsehood.\n\nForgetting all those human weaknesses, let me just try to remember his main achievements showered upon him by many quality appreciators. Very few are mentioned below:\n\n1978 - Prestigous S. S. Bhatnagar Award\n\n1981 - Richly felicitated with the title \"Rashtrabhooshan\" (The valuable gem of the Nation)\n\n1990 - \"Indira Gandhi Award\" by Indian National Science Academy\n\n1993 - B. M. Birla Award\n\n1993 - Doctorate by Benaras Hindu University\n\n1993 - Padmabhooshan Award by the President of India\n\n1996 - Kalinga Award\n\n2004 - Padmavibhooshan Award by the President of India\n\nThere are many such families in the Karhaadaa community who have earned name and eminence, generations after generations due to their individual born greatness. It was never a managed fame but an earned one! And the Naralikar family is one such glittering family!\n\nEminent Scholar Pandit Raghunathbhatta Ganeshbhatta Nawathey; Ratnagiri, Chaphal, Tanjaur (1650-1713)\n\nContemporary and close friend of Sant Shri. Ramdas; sheltered in his later age by Queen Smt. Deepabai, wife of King Shri. Ekoji Bhosale of Tanjore, Pandit Nawathey was a very eminent and dynamic Vaidik and Sanskrit scholar. He was the First great Vaidik scholar, who since knowing the complicated methods of ritualistics, had created, composed and disciplined these methods in a system called \"PRAYOGA\". This is a variety of Hindu ritualistic rites which are handed down for generations and on which the priesthood is today living by following word to word those rites which are called \"YAJNIKI\". All these have been composed by this great Southernised Maharashtrian Karhaadaa scholar. The First scholar who accomplishes the ritualistics needs to do so in a strict disciplined way for the benefits of those following strict Vaidik way of daily life! The present day Prayogas in which the priests are supposedly experts like \"Upanayana Prayoga\", \"Vivaha Prayoga\" etc. are composed by him only. His father was Ganeshbhatta, Grandfather was Raghunathbhatta and Great Grandfather was Hariharbhatta. The whole family appears to be eminent scholars of Vaidik literature and Sanskrit shastras. His Guru's name was Pandit Anand Deo. I surmise that this Nawathey family must be originally belonging to the village Bhoo, Taluka Rajapur, District Ratnagiri. There were many Nawathey's in that area since historical period (including Cine Director Shri. Raja Nawathey). Some of them later on became Deo, which is a story by itself. The Adil Shah of Vijapur has conferred this title upon them. Mr. Aravind Deo, Indian High Commissioner in Germany and Ex-Joint Foreign Secretary of Government of India comes from this family. The perfume dealers, residing in Kochi, Kerala State, also Deo, are from this Bhoo village. All those families in the vicinity of bhoo are great Vaidik and Sanskrit scholars and they contributed a lot of things to humanity.\n\nPandit Raghunathbhatta Sanskritised his family name Nawathey as \"Navahastha\" means Nawathey only. Dr. P. V. Kane, in his book \"History of Dharmashastra\" Volume I, Part II page 1208 agrees to this assertion. Not only Vaidik ritualistic compositions but some other books were written by him - some of them are \"Prayogaratnamanjoosha\", \"Sahityakutoohalam\", \"Dharmamitramahodadhi\", \"Janaardanamahodadhi\", \"Kashimeemansa\", \"Bhojanakutoohalam\", \"Praayashchittakutoohalam\" etc. It is learnt that he had also written a book in Marathi \"Narakavarnanam\".\n\nWe begin our auspicious rituals with \"Punyaahawachanam\". It is composed by this scholar. Pandit Raghunathbhatta Nawathey or Navahasta where \"Nava\" means Nine and \"Hasta\" means Hand i.e. 'one whose contribution is nine times greater than an average human being'. This is what he must have been wanting to imply. His mild aggressive authority could be perceived through his writing and therefore he might have been neglected later and usual jealousy for qualitative people might have kept him without any mention even, for which we are known for a long time!\n\nLeaving it aside, I invoke my bretheren that, let us be worthy of understanding the qualities of these great, greater and greatest Karhaadaas. Let our egoes permit them to enter into the province of our positive treatment for them. Let us be proud of our own greatest Karhaadaaa personalities who reigned the public mind for all the time and we must try to imbibe those qualities which took them to ever glittering condition. Let us not follow or imitate those belonging to other castes and possessing jealousy and spreading hatred for qualitative people all the time. Shri. Nawathey's books composed in Tanjour and some of them are published at Trivandrum in Kerala State.\n\nProfessor (Dr.) Shamakant Nawathey, USA\n\nDr. Nawathey stood First in Matriculation examination in Maharashtra, the then Bombay State. He is now an eminent Professor in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), USA. His text book on Computer Science is a very popular one in the US.\n\nThe Queen of Jhansi - Ever Greatest Smt. Laxmibai Newalkar; Jhansi\n\nThe vibrant daughter of Shri. Moropant Tambe and queen of Shri. Newalkar, King of Jhansi was the First Maharashtrian Queen who fought against the tyrant foreign enemy, very much on the battlefield and was killed there. She refused to accept the ungraceful life of adorning a subservient position which many Kings had long back accepted for a living and later on termed as adjustment with situation. I salute this embodiement of bravery and courage. Even 150 years after her departure, people capable of understanding the rarest quality and free from conditionality do appreciate and praise her qualities profoundly.\n\nVedasamraat Sakharambhatta Maheshvarabhatta Padhye; Koladhe, Ichalkaranji, Dombivali\n\nA religously very important tradition of preserving our Vaidik and allied literature and Indological sciences, that is regarded as wealth, had been kept alive by cramming and thus kept intact - without missing a letter of the word nay even the accent of the letter. The whole Vaidik system has come down to us in a very disciplined manner and every sensible scholarly person owes to these people a lot for preserving it exactly as it was recited thousands of years before. Karhaadaas have had, through generations after generation took it as our prime duty for long long periods with utmost true devotion and without any gap to vehemently preserve it without any botheration whether in the process they are inviting poverty, malice, malevolence and all those distinctive features caused due to poverty. It has even led them to lose their respect in the ever changing social atmosphere and factually degraded standard with an unpredictable mood of society in general, finally bringing them down to the level of fulfiling day to day ritualistic needs of people, people who are incapable in grasping as to which level of austerity and with what untired penance this vaidik scholar has been studying.\n\nFor more than a 1500 to 1600 years period, Karhaadaas have carried this responsibility, earned respects in historical period including from Adi Shankaracharya. Shankaracharya placed at every important Hindu pilgrimage place, a Karhaadaa Brahman only and even today, they are on the top. Vedasamrat S. M. Padhye Guruji is one such eminent Vaidik Scholar.\n\nThere was a hot debate between two great German scholars Dr. Roth and Dr. Max Mueller for determining the meaning of a Vaidik mantra. In finding the definition of Vaidik mantras, the accent of the letter is highly important. Both of them were translating Vedas and Dr. Max Mueller was of the opinion that since they are away from the tradition they ought to take help from Brahmanas (i.e. Brahmins) from India. Dr. Roth said that it will not be helpful but Dr. Max Mueller went on searching and to his amazement, he observed that in a ocean of Vaidik literature throughout India, Dr. Max Mueller opines only 7 or 8 places are there, where the accents of the letter are not placed properly. The number is negligible. It was a wonder of the world that how the Brahmins without missing even the accents had memorised it years after years when there was no paper or even writing instruments. I am giving this story in the briefest possible manner to inform my readers as to what degree, it is difficult to preserve vedas. Karhaadaas have had the biggest contribution in this field.\n\nA very clear pronounciation, unparallel capability of conspicously showing in their utterances the minute distinctive differences between the parts of every word in a mantra, the exact placement in showing of accent of the letter and the sweetest tonality, all these characteristics with peculiar Karhaadaa style of presentations are the distinctive traditional characteristics of Karhaadaa Vaidik scholars. These characteristics are seen in a long long history of noted Karhaadaa people, known to even Adi Shankaracharya (780 - 812 AD) of Kerala. I am still observing it with most curious and sensitive trained ears that even the parted Karhaadas settled in Kerala have preserved this tradition! The number of qualitative Karhaadaa scholars always, therefore, surpassing the number of any other comunity. For the eminent Vaidik scholars, one may kindly see the list later in this book.\n\nIn recent history, i.e. about 60 years before, a great scholar was examined by several Vaidik scholars in Benaras (Kashi). All ten books pertaining to Rigveda were there as subject of his oral exam; and this event was attended by even the King of Kashi. A young lad Pandit Sakhaaramabhatta Padhye stood First and it was a ceremonious feliciation arranged for this Vaidik scholar. After riding him on an elephant procession on the roads of Kashi, the meeting of Vaidik Sanskrit Scholars conferred on him the title \"VEDASAMRAT\" i.e. \"The King of Kings among Vaidik scholars\". He was the First to have received felicitation and a title like that, with an yearly reward of Rs. 1,200 from the King of Kashi which he used to enjoy till recently. He left for the heavenly abode on 11 January 2009 leaving behind a vaccum that probably will never be filled.\n\nShri. Gajannan Balkrishna Palsule; Pune\n\nHe was awarded the First Kalidasa Award constituted by Kalidas University, Ramtek, Nagpur. This was for his epic in Sanskrit, based on the biography of Veer Savarkar. He was also declared as the National Sanskrit Pandit. (Credit of this entry goes to Shri. Harshad Sarpotdar)\n\nShri. Vishnoo Parashuram Shastri Pandit, Mumbai\n\nA great Pandit who did his learning through traditional system was the First in propagating widow-marriage. He was a scholar of Sanskrit and English and was the ablest personality in harmoniously explaining the cross references of religous books and in handling them with delicacy and with equal felicity!\n\nHe did not approve of the petrified condition of religion or ritualistic religion. Widow marriage propagation was not a liability nor even an imposition of any kind in his case. Whatever he was convinced about, he vehemently went on telling people the same. He was the owner of \"Induprakash\" Printing press. Sir Bartalphere, the then Governer of Bombay on recommendation of Mr. Grant assigned the grand project of collecting, compiling, researching and editing all the Abhangas of Saint Shri. Tukaram Maharaj with this great scholar; and under the critical and scholarly observation of another great scholar Shri. Shankar Pandurang Pandit, he accomplished the project. The true scholars have amply appreciated the standard of work. The then British Government published Part I in 1869 and Part II in 1873. This work became an important one and scholars like M M Datto Vaman Potdar used to call it \"Shankar Pandurangi edition\". As usual, the people who could not digest this, cast harsh criticism on Shri. S. P. Pandit and Shri. V. P. Pandit including caste reference of Saint Shri. Tukaram Maharaj. This was exposed by an intelligent secretary Shri. Purushottam Mangesh Laad. He had shown futility of all the charges made by Shri. Vishnushastri Chiplunkar and Shri. Bhave. Shri. V. P. Pandit also published the Sanskrit-Marathi Dhatukosh & English Marathi Kosh. A great scholar indeed. Very firm and spirited!\n\nShri. Prabhakar Panshikar; Mumbai; Born: 14-3-1931\n\nAn Actor, Producer, Director, a quick-character actor, owner of a company staging plays, original thinker about stage and its progressive place in the contemporary artistic presentation, setting new trends and styles on Marathi stage, making several records, representing a family having spent several generations in Indological research and erudition in several branches, and the rarest among rarest personality who was recepient of the First Award constituted by Maharashtra Government on his name itself! The rarest honour one could receive during his lifetime for one's contribution to his chosen field. He is in reality, a himalayan figure for Marathi stage, next only to Shri. Annasaheb Kirloskar. He was selected twice as Presient of Marathi Natya Sammelan. Several honours came to him for adorning themselves. A national award winner of Sangeet Natak Academi, Vishnudas Bhave Gold Medal winner, felicitation with conferring him the title \"Maharashtra Gaurav\" (The great person who is the glory of Maharashtra); recepient of Dinanath Mangeshkar Award, President of Maharashtra Censor board, Chaturang Jeevan Gaurav Puraskar etc.\n\nHe was First in enacting the roles as a character actor through 30-35 plays during the period 1955 to 2000. First in producing 40-45 plays staged by \"Natya Sampadaa\", the company he established for presenting plays and the number of performances is more than 8,000. The First actor who staged two plays in each of which, he enacted his roles more than One Thousand Times - \"To Mee Navhech\" character Lakhoba Lokhande continually 2592 times and \"Ashrunchi Jhali Phule\" character Professor Vidyanand 1070 times till the year 2000. The First enterprising Producer-Director and owner of the company (Natya Sampadaa) which had presented Marathi plays throughout Maharashtra by taking along with him the stage of play which was portable, mobile and interchangable. He is very much intelligent and capable of exacting his conceived notions. One has to remember forever the contributions of four great seers of Marathi stage: Late Shri. Annasaheb Kirloskar, Shri. Bhalchandra Bapusaheb Pendharkar, Shri. Prabhakar Panshikar and Shri. Govindrao Tembye as stage Institute owners. Also remember Shri. Bhaskarbuva Bakhle, Shri. Govindrao Tembye, Shri. V. S. Gurjar, Prof. Vasant Kanetkar, Shri. Sha. Na. Navare, Shri. Jitendra Abhisheki, Shri. Daji Bhatawadekar, Smt. Smita Talwalkar, Shri. Sharad Talwalkar and Baabaa Dikey from Indore etc.\n\nShri. Baburao Vishnu Paradkar, Banares\n\nThe founder editor and owner of the newspaper \"Aaj\" in Hindi. \"Aaj\" is a daily newspaper of Benaras (Kashi). Staying far away from Maharashtra, inspiring people with constructive information and providing with required education in that old city of religious and cultural importance, Shri. Baburaoji Paradkar was a very very respectable personality in whom there was an enchanting confluence of being a great social selfless worker, constructive thinker and a superclass journalist. \"Paradkar Bhavan\" is still an inspiring building for all in Uttar Pradesh and in Northern States of India. Government of India had issued a postal stamp on this eminent personality. He was the First Maharashtrian Journalist of a Hindi language daily newspaper and founder editor. He was the disciple of another great journalist Shri. Sakharam Ganesh Deuskar, Kolkata, editor of Bengali daily \"Hitawaad\" whose another great disciple was Shri. Laxman Narayan Garde, also a Karhaadaa.\n\nBharatratna Shri. Govind Ballabh Pant Paradkar; Kotapur, Gadhwal, New Delhi, (Birth: 10-9-1887/Death: 1962)\n\nHe was the ablest First Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Two big states at that time, Uttar Pradesh and the then Bombay State (inclusive of Maharashtra and Gujarat) were having Chief Ministers, each of which was from the Karhaadaa community. Shri. G B Pant was thereafter, known as the Home minister of this Nation. We feel proud of the political situation of the then Nation for which Karhaadaa community had provided One Home Minister, Two Chief Ministers, One First Speaker of Lok Sabha and Three Speakers of State Legislative Assembly besides many MPs, MLCs, Presients of PCCs, Political and Cultural thinkers, all of them were prossessing constructive approach in solving socio-political problems which has been the intrinsic basic quality of Karhaadaas.\n\nHis surname or family name was Pant-Paradkar as he told this to Late Shri. B. G. Kher, the First Chief Minister of the then Bombay State. The villagers from Kotapur, Taluka Rajapur, District Ratnagiri told me this while pointing out the plinth area of Pant-Paradkar family's home. About 55 years before, one Mr. M. A. Navare, a social leader told me as to how about 175 years before, one Shri. Jayaram Pant Paradkar (Pant Paradkar, Pant Vaidya are the family names of Karhaadaa community) from that house went to Northern India as a pilgrim and remained there only. Khandekar and Navare's houses were adjacent to Pant-Paradkar's house therefore they knew everything about them. Late Shri. G. B. Pant Paradkar was very much aware of the fact that they are the Karhaadaas from Rajapur Tehsil & Ratnagiri district of Konkan. In the absence of communication, in those days say about 250 years before, many have gone to UP side and settled there. Let us be establishing contact with our own bretheren who have long back migrated to several states like Himachal Pradesh, UP, Bihar, Orissa, Bengal, MP, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu etc.\n\nAdditional achievements about Shri. G B Pant are below:\n\nUP Congress President (Simultaneously, the Congress President in Maharashtra was Shri. Shankarrao Deo)\n\nFounded Kumaun Parishad which undertook the study of Backward Class people\n\nMember of Constitution Committee\n\nFirst Chief Minister of UP in 1935. Remained the CM for a long period (Simultaneously, the CM in Maharashtra was Shri. B. G. Kher)\n\nRecepient of the Bharat Ratna in 1957\n\nProminent and illustrious role as Home Minister of India\n\nShri. Moropant Paradkar - Panhaala, Baramati, 1729 - 1794\n\nThe First Marathi poet known for not only making a metre of poem known as his province only, but also for his diction, attractive meaningful compositions, delineation, apt metre, mastery over the language, striking imagination and living even after 210 years of his death in the minds of true poetry lovers. In all respects, he was an ever great Marathi poet. The Metre \"Aaryaa\" became popular because of him. He was the First poet in quantity and more so, quality. Dr. Nandapurkar placed him next to Shri. Jnaneshwar Maharaj only. The intelligent but ignoble move to include him in the category of \"Learned Poet\" (Pandit Kavi) became his additional epithet. The device to diminish the impact of this great poet from the people's minds was futile. In order to make their desired and caste fellow first, they used the adjective \"Adhunik Marathi kaviteche janak\" i.e. \"the father of modern marathi poetry\"; and even when the word modern lost its meaning a century back, continue it even today - the period which is dominated by poets like Suresh Bhatt, Sudheer Moghe, Grace, Indira Sant and others. A critic like Shri. G. T. Madkholkar has shown the place of \"Adhunik\" in his article.\n\nMiss Meena Parande - Nagpur, Pune\n\nBorn on 12 December 1931, Miss Meena Parande was the First woman Table Tennis champion. During 1948 to 1965, she was the National Champion Four times. She represented India to England in 1954 and to Japan in 1956. On the International level, she had toured Singapore, Bangkok, Vietnam, Pakistan and Shri Lanka. She received training from Mr. Chandorkar of Nagpur. After retiring, she trained many players for Table Tennis from 1965 to 1985. Known ones among these are Dr. Charudatta Apte, Rajeev Bodas, Suhas Kulkarni, Ajeya Sidhaye, Neela Kulkarni, Nandini Kulkarni and Sunanda Kane.\n\nShri. Bhalachandra Bapusaheb Pendharkar, Mumbai\n\nSeveral great Institutes founded or even run by Karhaadaas could celebrate their centenary. Some of them are, Kirloskar Company, Dhavale Publication Company, Lalita Kalaadarsha - a Marathi play staging company. On Marathi stage, the companies established by Karhaadaas or run by Karhaadaas have become renowned. Kirloskar Natak company of Annasaheb Kirloskar, Lalita Kalaadarsh of Shri. Pendharkar family, Natyasampadaa of Prabhakar Panshikar are some of the noted companies.\n\nLalita Kalaadarsha was founded by Shri. Keshavrao Bhonsale, a disciple of great music artist of Kolhapur Shri. Dattopant Jambhekar, also a Karhaadaa. Shri. Bhonsale was confident that Shri. Bapusaheb Pendharkar could efficiently look after his company and had by a will, given the whole company to Baburao Pendharkar. After him, the responsibility of the company came on the shoulders of young Shri. Bhalachandra a great singer artist, who for the last 70 years with a spartan warrior's spirit is carrying the flag of enlivening the spirit of preserving the Marathi stage in touring throughout the country.\n\nDue to his strong wish, determination and true love for stage-song prominent Marathi Drama; he has recorded all the marathi dramas. He is First in doing that. He was also First in booking the whole compartment of Indian railways for more than a year's period and touring all over India, by staging Marathi Plays/Dramas without botheration for loss! It had never taken place in the history of 150 years of Marathi stage. The Pendharkar family is the First of the type whose three generations are there in running the Institute. This is also a First of its kind. We are proud of you Mr. Bhalachandra ji!\n\nThis undaunted spirit and perseverance for the accomplishments for the desired goal are the basic intrinsic qualities of spirited Karhaadaas. I pray almighty, let everyone in this community be continuously inspired and fired up for his/her achieving goal with steeled strength and unparallel vigour and that marvellous illustrious nobility of Karhaadaa cells. Accomplishing the great task in every odd situation is itself a Himalayan work. I strongly feel, if sincerity is alive, one cannot easily overlook the contributions of three ever great Karhaadaas Shri. Annasaheb Kirloskar, Shri. Bhalchandraji Pendharkar and Shri. Prabhakar Panshikar as running Marathi stage companies, which yielded no profits.\n\nThe glittering Karhaadaa quality of this field is kept vibrant by one ever great devoted artist Shri. Baabaa Dikey in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. His efforts are unparallel indeed!\n\nShri. Gajannan Pendharkar; Mumbai\n\nThe person responsible for manufacturing and selling the First Ayurvedic toothpaste under the brand name now famous as VICCO Vajradanti is an illustrious Karhaadaa! (Credit of this entry goes to Shri. Harshad Sarpotdar)\n\nShri. R. K. Prabhudesai, Mumbai\n\nA great individual and not institutional perseverate with keen desire aiming at completing the \"Devikosha\" in Five big volumes requires continuous and systematic endeavour for accomplishing the Himalayan Task. We have closely seen the standard of some such Koshas, which are run on public grants and rather with help from people and even then the condition is not up to the mark. This is the First individual creation, that too is accomplished by a person whose service was in Police department and is a voluminous work of high standard in which one would get information about all noted places where Godess is worshipped. The Shaktipeeths and related many things such as Matrikaa Poojanam, Ten Mahavidyaa, Adishakti, Devi Peethas etc. are delineated. He has established theory which is important for the devotees of Godess (Shaktaas) that the original yoginees are in due time elevated to the position of maatrikaas. Shri. Prabhudesai has accomplished the Himalayan task without anybody's help/aid and only for self satisfaction, which has become now a reference book, and that too a reliable one.\n\nMany sciolists are amply benefited by such type of work, without a bit of credit to Shri. Prabhudesai. As many astrologers are benefited because of Shri. Govind Ramchandra Moghe's book called \"Jyotirmayookh\", on Astrology or erudite Baba Bhatta Padhye's book \"Dharmasindhu\" depending on which many judgement like statements are made without giving credit to respective great people or book even. It is like that! To illustrate further what I have asserted above, I may request my readers to please go through the aided project of \"Sanskriti Kosha\" by Shri. Mahadeo Shastri Joshi and his skills in providing information with partial attitude about Karhaadaas and Kokanasthaas. The implied meaning could be quickly perceived by any knowledgeable person who is aware of the type of mentality!\n\nI salute great people like Shri. Padhye, Shri. Moghe and Shri. Prabhudesai who have established the standard of reference books, have been thoroughly reliable and their work has become the treasure forever for some thieves to display their scholarship(?) without any credit to those respective originators.\n\nShri. Keshavaswami Purohit; Katawali - Deorukh\n\nDuring the time of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, many qualitative Karhaadaa people flourished and gained name with respect. Even from the time of Shilaharas, Chalukyas and Kadambas, many Karhaadaas gained name and positions. Many surnames in Karhaadaas like Karkhanis, Tophkhane, Sirluskar, Sarmokadam, Potdar, Mutalik, Adhikari, Desai, Prabhoo, Sabnis, Sarpotdar, Mirashi have clung to them because of their occupation and position. Many Diwans, Ministers, Administrators, Accountants gained name during Shri. Shivaji Maharaj's period. The great mediator Shri. Krishnaji Bhaskar Pandit known for negotiations between Shri. Shivaji Maharaj at Pratapgad and Afzal Khan who settled temporarily at Wai was a Karhaadaa. The First Purohit appointed by Shri. Shivaji Maharaj was Shri. Keshavswami Purohit and then after he became the Rajpurohit of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj also. (Credit of this entry goes to Shri. Harshad Sarpotdar)\n\nLate Pandit Vishwanath Rao Ringe alias \"Taanaranga\"; Sagar/Indore\n\nHe was a Hindustani Classical music-vocalist and the best composer. He belonged to Gwalior Gharana and composed more than 2,000 Bandishis in about 200 ragas. This is the First time in the history of musicologists and musicians that a maestro in classical vocal music, on his own, writing down Bandishis which run 2,000 in number and in 200 ragaas in various Taalas - Ektal, Deepchandi, Trital, Tilwada, Chinchar, Dadra, Kehrawa, Jhaptal, Ada Chantal, Roopak etc. nothing of which either borrowed from anyone or stolen.\n\nI am reminded of one great Maharashtrian name who was sued in court on charges of stealing the Bandishis of an eminent music artist. Being a compiler/ music lover how he was rid off is another matter not to be discussed here. This is not the case with Shri. Vishwanathrao Ringeji. He wrote several books on music - they are \"Sangeetanjali\", \"Swaranjali\" and a recent one \"Acharya Taanaranga ki Badishen\". \"Taanaranga\" was his nick-name. In the language of Panditraj Jagannath, I would say that since he was a \"Kasturee-mriga\" i.e. the special variety of deer producing Kasturee, who does not need to go to the garden for smelling variety of flowers! Pandit Ringeji was of the same type. He was the disciple of Pandit Krishnarao Pandit, Gwalior.\n\nPandit Ringe established a Music school named \"Bharateeya Sangeet Kalaa Mandir\" in Saagar, MP in 1939. This was later on shifted to Indore in 1968. Besides, he himself composed a raaga \"Hemashri\" for AIR programmes.\n\nHe is also the First about whom we find references in 5-6 Internationally reputed mediums; as follows:\n\n1. Limca Book of records in the year 1999 (Page 222)\n\n2. Indo-American Who's Who Vol. II in 1999 (Page 493)\n\n3. Reference Asia Volume II in 1996 (Page 524)\n\n4. Biography International Vol. III and Vol. IV (Page 810)\n\n5. Indo European Who's Who Vol I in 1996\n\nI feel very irritated that no mdedia is providing us with any information about these people (compared to him who was sued in the court on charges of stealing Bandishis and who was a music lover and not a performer). Pandit Ringe was both the top grade performer and composer of Bandishis. People who are otherwise boastful about the welfare of Maharashtrians never take names of these really noteworthy, original (and not living on borrowed or stolen matter) artists in Mumbai-Pune media. They are Pandit Ringeji, Pandit Vishnupant Chinchalkar, Dike, Shejwalkar, Shalini tai Moghe, Sarvatye, Pandit Husurkar, Katdare, Pandit Lalit, Sardar Mulye, Sardar Kibey and hundreds of other noteworthy persons. Never were they ever mentioned ... Why?\n\nI realised after reading a compilation type book on Yogavidya. At the end, the writer gives the bibliography of writers on the subject and in that, there is not even a mention of one great name i.e. Prof. I. K. Taimini who translated with ample convincing notes the book of Patanjali Yoga Sutras. Prof. Taimini is so sincere that where he was not sure, he did not give any imaginary thinking like some propagated Maharashtrians have done. Here he expressed his sorryful mind for not getting the meaning. See for example his commets \"Saptadhaa Prantabhoomih Prajnaa\" = \"Seven fold varieties of Prajnaa\".\n\nIn this book above, I saw his thoughts framed in particular phrases and words which are the same used by Professor Taimini in his book and never is there any mention of his name or his book. The intelligent way of supressing the name for hideous self-gain! Likewise - not mentioning Pandit Ringe's contribution could enable someone in future to name many of his Bandishis on his own name. Thieves in the field of various branches of cultural field are ample as they are even in Professional advanced researchers fields in pure sciences. I know some musicians who stole many musical compositions of other persons and due to position, earned name in musical field. A music composer, once prayed Pandit Bhimsenji, due to his so-called friendly association with him and got his name on Pandit Bhimsenji's LP (Audio recording) as music composer of which the music was composed by Pandit Joshi himself. Later on, on public rostrums, the adopted composer boastfully said that \"these great musicians earned name because of us\"! That fellow was really a pigmy before Pandit Bhimsenji who himself was very much capable and had composed the devotional songs/abhangas etc. What and how Panditji reacted on this is history which I cannot write here.\n\nThe cultivated hyena culture is really very dangerous and you would come to know your loss only when the people of this culture have robbed you off fully and got the credit for that including your wealth permanently, calling you a fool. The naive Karhaadaa people and some similar communities were thus loosers, being unattentive to the fact, that they are surrounded by this hyena culture; and the fact could be understood when they were and are totally robbed and left in a completely pitiable condition. Even then, this mettle called Karhaadaa, never has been broken, vanished or completely destroyed.\n\nA very small community, as per my observations gave 65 persons as Firsts in different fields. Many of them again proved as several Firsts each, is itself a great contribution. This is seldom matched by any other manifold bigger community. Each one of us must be proud of this fact. Now our people would realise as to what makes others possess enimical feelings for us. When they see even a bright Karhaadaa boy appearing for an examination as their enemy and try to eliminate him as skillfully as possible. (For this, the interested people can go through the article published in Sanskrit quarterly \"Gunjarava\" of April-June 2006. It is introducing great Pandit Shri. Balkrishna Ganesh Hardikar, guru of Shri. Pandurang Shastri Athavale and uncle of Shri. Awadhoot Hardikar and written by Shri. Awadhoot Hardikar.) Our possessing superior quality itself had created this situation! Let us be firm and improve ourselves from every possible way with the glittering qualities our heritage bestowed upon us! Learning from them that even hyenas are required to be fed in the jungle.\n\nOn the background of these very very bad stories, today I am very happy to read Pandit Bhimsen Joshi's sincere remarks about Pandit Bhaskarbuwa Bakhale; in Sawai Gandharva festival held in Pune. His interview was shown on the TV, in which he said that when he was in Kabul, he invited the great royal musician vocalist Ustad Mohammed Hussain of Kabul, Afganisthan for participating in the Sawai Gandharva festival of Pune. The Ustad with a happy note told Pandit Bhimsenji Joshi \"Bhaskarbuwa Bakhalejee kaa woh gaon hain' ham jaruur sevaa karenge\"! (That is the native place of Pandit BhaskarBuwa Bakhale. I will surely come there to entertain its residents). I salute Bhmsenji for this truthful account. This was the incidence of many decades past. He could have conveniently told any cash-name but the great is really great for all the times! I was happy to know today, while reading it in \"Sakal\" Pune (8th December 2007) that even after many years of Pandit Bhaskarbuwa's departure, a gem in Kabul, knew \"Pune\" as the \"place of Bakhalebuwaa\"! The dedication, love for art, sincerety and assimilation as it were, with the place was so thick of Bakhalebuwaa with Pune that both of these names became synonyms! This is to be learnt by heart!!\n\nShri. Ramachandra Sapre, Mumbai\n\nThe First champion of National Chess competition in 1955 was Shri. R. S. Sapre. He was a Guru of Gurus in Chess. He reigned the empire of Chess for fifteen years continuously from 1949 to 1964. He represented India in 1956 in the Olympics; was ex-president of Maharashtra Chess Mahasangha, a regulatory body. He was the most respected personality and was honourably invited in those early years on international level. Alas! He was a Karhaada otherwise, a memorial building could have been erected, atleast in Maharashtra in his memory for his untiring endeavouring for popularising chess. We are yet to learn the technique of constant propagation, image building, glorifying personality at least proportionately. All these things are useful for your practical existence as a community. Even when granting the idealogical viewpoint of keeping ourselves at a distance from the business of conventional image building; let us be frank ourselves in appreciating the qualitative personalities whenever the opportunity comes. Why not speak a word of appreciation of our own family person or community persons? Shall we start from today at this moment?\n\nShri. Sharatchandra Balkrishna Sarvate, Indore\n\nYou will find a very good and lovable name of a great achiever who finds a place in The Limca Book of World Records - Shri. S. B. Sarvate of Indore. His record is in the field of scientifically demolishing buildings/constructions in thickly populated cities. He is the First to hold a certificate of competency of mine managing and a Chartered Engineer of India. He was the First expert to give his services to earthquake hit Gujarat and especially traumatised residences of partially damaged buildings in Ahmedabad. \"His implosion technique is unique and had demolished between 9-11-1996 to 10-10-2003 one hundred and fifteen buildings without adversely affecting neighouring houses even only 10 feet away.\" This is as per Limca Book of Records. He is First among many Firsts among Maharashtrian/Indian families in this field and we are proud of him.\n\nShri. Govind Sakharam Sardesai - Baroda, Kamshet\n\nHe was the great historian having mastery over several subjects including English language and literature. He was in his youthful days selected for teaching English to Shri. Sayajirao Maharaj Gaekwad, King of Baroda State, who was a great connoisseur of quality people. Therefore, many qualitative personalities and less intelligent mischief mongers were taken to Baroda. Shri. Yashwant D. Pendharkar the great poet, Shri. Tambe and Shri. Hardikar the great Aurvedic experts, Mr. Tambe a judiciary expert, Yogi Shri. Lele etc. many up and coming youth flourished because of Shri. Sayajirao. Shri. Bhaskarbuva Bakhle and Shri. Babasaheb Ambedkar received patronage from the State.\n\nDue to his love and colossal reading of History, he undertook to write \"Marathi Riyasat\" a book of history with detailed account of happenings in chronological order with full details of facts, including episodes of the events put together in a very orderly fashion. It was the First successful effort of the kind and there is no side-taking business or arrogant view one would find, with spirited advocacy for his own caste people etc. nor any affection or love shown to or hatred displayed for any community which was the sweet job of some other historians.\n\nGreatness of Shri. G. S. Sardesai lies in inviting with honour Shri. Tryambak Shankar Shejwalkar a young boy, who then was just a blossoming flower of 23 years of age but adorned with razor sharp intelligence to write the preface for this voluminous book. In that also, he was the First. There were many renowned historians in Maharashtra in those days but since Shri. Sardesai knew the difference between face value and true value; he assigned the work to Shri. Shejwalkar. As real quality sees no age, gender, name and fame ... never the caste etc. including status. There were/are proven naive Karhaadaas like Satavalekar, Tambe etc. who assigned such type of work without knowing this difference and made the job of already conditioned minds easy! It is interesting to read this scholarly preface!!\n\nBrahmarshi Shreepad Damodar Satavalekar - Sawantwadi, Mumbai, Lahore, Aundh, Pardi\n\nThe First editor of three monthly magazines published simultaneously in different languages viz. \"Purusharth\" in Marathi, \"Vaidik Dharma\" in Hindi and \"Veda Sandesh\" in Gujarati. Besides being so engaged, he had 404 books at his credit - written by him and not compiled and credited ones! He lived a life of 103 years! He was also the First in receiving the Mayo Award for painting twice. Coming from a remote village in Maharashtra, he established his studio at Lahore. He was the First Maharashtrian to do that. His multifaceted intellectual potential caused the learned people to confer on him the prestigous title \"BRAHMARSHI\" and he was truely like one. Just read his commentary \"Purusharthbodhini\" on Shreemad Bhagawad Geeta and you will realise, what really a person Pandit S. D. Satavalekar was. More than two dozen institutes in India felicitated him with degrees and honours.\n\nDr. Prabhakar Chintaman Shejwalkar\n\nRight from historical period to this date, the Karhaadaa community is marching ahead with the same glitterance in many fields of human activity establishing their unparallel illustrious eminence in that particular field. The \"Karhaadaa\" is really a long lived culture and long lived cultures have always progressively sound potential. You may mention any positive field; a Karhaadaa with bright eminence would be there; with something of his own, contributing richly to that field and proving himself a GEM!\n\nHere, I am introducing one such eminent personality who has to his credit a qualitatively and even quantitatively illustrious contribution to the field of management science. By the date 31 December 2007, the number of his students who secured a Doctoral Degree (PhD) under his ablest guidance is Seventy Eight (78). Today he is 80 years of age. This is not only the State level or National level record but probably a World record! Besides, 35 students received guidance from him for their M.Phil. In a very briefest possible manner, I would go through his achievements:\n\nThe former Dean of faculty of Management was also the Dean of faculty of Commerce, Pune University, nominated as Professor Emiritus of Commerce & Management Sciences, Chairman of Board of studies in Knowledge Management, Founder Director of The Institute of Management Development and Research (IMDR), Pune. Teaching higher education for Fifty Four years, he trained more than 11,000 Agents and 5,000 Development Officers of LIC since 1982, founder Chairman and Director of Shejwalkar Education Society since 1987, Founder Director and President of Shejwalkar Institute of Business Management Education Research, former Director of Pune Stock Exchange, fellow membership conferred by All India Management Association, advisor in several management Institutes, author and co-author of more than 30 text books and other books, 600 articles and had given more than 4,000 public lectures.\n\nPresident of many educational Institutes, recepient of many awards including lifetime achievement Award from National Institute of Personal Management ... a long and prolong list of achievements. Dr. P. C. Shejwalkar himself is a magnanimous Institution.\n\nShri. Bebi Talwalkar, Mumbai\n\nThe First Montessory school in Sanskrit medium was started in Girgaon, Mumbai by this scholarly lady. after marrying Mr. Chakradev, a Chitpavan she became Smt. Malati Chakradev, however she was born of Karhaadaa parents in the eminent Talwalkar family of Mumbai which is known for Doctors, Surgeons, Gymnasium, CAs, Drama, Merchants, Business, Industries etc.\n\nShri. Vishnu Talwalkar; Mumbai\n\nWhen there was no concept even to modernise the traditional body-exercise centres, there was one Mr. Vishnupant Talwalkar, whose pioneering work in the field of Nationwide chains of fitness clubs under the brand-name \"Talwalkars\" was the First in this field. A First from Maharashtra and from a Karhaadaa! (Credit of this entry goes to Shri. Harshad Sarpotdar)\n\nBrahmeebhoota Shri. Ganesh Wasudev Tembye Swamiji alias - Shri. WasudevanandSaraswati\n\nBorn - Shravan Krishna Panchami 1854 AD at Mangaon, Sindhudurg Death - 23-06-1914 at Garudeshwar, Gujarath\n\nThe First spiritually elevated personality with topmost practical knowledge of Paatanjala yogavidyaa which he earned out of his own efforts by strictly following the rules laid down in Indological occult sciences. As such, he was an enchanting confluence of spirituality (=Adhyaatma) and yogic expertise. He was the great Yogi. Not even an iota of thought was there to commercialise his expertise and make self the Maharaj etc. People rushed to him wherever he went for their solace of which marketing was not allowed by him. Instead, disciples like Yogi Shri. Wamanraoji Gulawani Maharaj of Pune, walked in search of him for more than 1400 Km and then alone could see him. It was Shri. Wamanraoji whose efforts are mainly responsible to bring into light more than 25 books, telling about his devotion, hymns, Sanskrit/Marathi compositions and his own thoughts on Spirituality and Yogavidyaa. Shri. P. P. Gokhale of Karad wrote that Swamiji has written 4-5 books, a purportive miserly reference about him. Kindly do not trust these types of writing born out of chronic conditionality. Kindly also do not get carried away by Shri. Shankarrao Abhyankar's references to Shri. Wasudevanandaji in singular denomination. That is the fashion for indirectly enhancing self-image. Simply by referring to a great name in singular terms, majority of people would start apprehending that this person is greater since he is referring to the greatest known persons like Shri. Wasudevanandaji in singular terms, a very low-level usage, not used in Marathi culture. It is a born great device!\n\nKarhaadaas are known from the very historical period for incessantly endeavouring people for spiritual realisation, gaining expertise in Yogic processes without bothering for outside world. Only one Tembye family has begotten twelve such elevated souls. Among them Shri. Wasudevanandaji from Mangaon, Shri. Shivaanandaji from Pangre, Shri. Seetaram Maharaj Tembye from Kharaghat, Shri. Prabhakar Maharaj Tembye from Solapur are well-known in the respective areas.\n\nPeople who think about spirituality as a deal in practical life sometimes create amusement like the one you would find in the commercial advertisements. When caught and brought to the notice of the appropriate authority with agreeable proof, then alone it is an offence (provided an honourable person holding judicial post, says so!). Otherwise cases like that go on in practical life as if unnoticed. I got similarly amused when I saw one news about one name \"Shri. Wasudevaananta Saraswati\". There is a very little phonetic difference between \"ta\" and \"da\"; but it does create the required futuristic planned effect. Leaving the point for appropriability among learned for observance, I am sure, this reference might have come out of a juxtapositional feeling of reverance for Shri. Tembye Swamiji.\n\nAnother striking observation I must note with interest. A book entitled \"Sadhu Santaanchaa Devayan Panth\" written in Marathi by Shri. S. M. Vaidya has got reference book value, as he had compiled opinions of many saints on different spiritual terminologies. This book has five full pages of introductory remarks by known philosophical scholar Dr. R. D. Ranade. The book is dedicated with deep devotion to Shri. Waasudevanandaji Tembye Swami by the writer. In this introductory remarks, nowhere is a reference for Shri. Tembye Swamiji to whom the book is dedicated with reverence. Prof. R. D. Ranade was fully within his framework to write about the topic but I found, that he could not resist himself in writing eulogical paras for the writer.\n\nThis may, though striking, appear as very much mild-natured treatment. I was about to faint while reading a biographical sketch of Shri. Swami Samarth of Akkalkot by his pupil one Shri. Gopalbuwa alias Shri. Gopal Ramachandra Kelkar alias Preetinand Swami Kumar. This Swamiji is said to be a spiritually elevated personality, meaning he has conquered all types of conditionalities and purified his innate. But his inborn wrath was apparently disturbing him so much, that he mentioned in this biography published by Anmol Prakashan, 1st edition page 119 that \"Once a Karhaadyaa came to see Swamiji\" a vivid display of jealousy brought out with a naked abusive term! While referring to other communities, however, his spiritual condition used to be intact! Even Swamijis are unable to overcome the conditioned mind! I have fullest reverence at my command for the truest elevated souls!\n\nI could say here with confidence, that the only spiritually elevated personality whose experiements they have either told to their disciples like Shri. Wamanraoji Gulwani Maharaj or advised through their writing have been universally experienced by hundreds and thousands of persons, was Shri. Tembye Swamiji. His advise was used on self experience, tested time and again and delightfully came as cent per cent true! It was not the knowledge already booked in Yogic upanishads and displayed by him, but it was of his own!\n\nShri. Govindrao Tembye - Kolhapur\n\nEvergreat musicologist, not only maestro but very prominent and widely appreciated composer of Marathi stage songs, a great disciplined music conductor, top-class guide and a lovable authority on the subject of music in particular and Art in general. In the dignified way he was the most gracious \"mae-sto-so\"! A majestic personality wherein, there was a superb and well designed confluence of erudition, artistic presentation and impressive beautiful personality. The name of this wizard of harmonium was Shri. Govindrao Tembye!\n\nHe was the First Marathi hero of the First marathi movie \"Ayodhyecha Rajaa\". He was primarily responsible for giving musical compositions for Marathi stage songs with greater variety of moods and a top class visionary who being a top-class connoisseur know the chemistry of presentation, blending well in selecting the proper raaga which appropriately suited the quintessential meaning of the song. Both Pt. Bhaskarbuva Bakhle and Pt. Govindrao Tembye were the greatest ever seers in this particular aspect of musicology! They were great friends and their accomplishments were complementary to one another as was the case with Vasant Kanetkar and Prabhakar Panshikar or Baabaa Bhatta Padhye and Moropant Paradkar.\n\nShri. Tembye was chosen the President of the precious gathering of marathi play lovers in Pune; was ever in-demand writer like Shri. Ramakrishna Bakre on plays, Dramas, biographical sketches, music and all aspects of music etc. He had also written musical operas like Jayadeva, Mahashveta, Pratima etc. He was the First in writing the songs in Marathi giving the characteristics of different raagas which is called \"Lakshanageeta\" or scientific information about the raaga of Hindustani music. Even in this all things were interwoven like - musical definition of raaga, characteristics of the same, feelings of the song corresponding to the mood of the raaga with time theory in mind ... one has to meditate upon even to think about all these!\n\nSuch a qualitative, ever great personality is born once in a hundred or two hundred years. Let us be worthy in perceiving these celestial qualities.\n\nSmt. Anuja Thakur; Mumbai\n\nThe First Indian woman to be the world Billiards Champion is from our Karhaadaa community! We are proud of her! (Credit of this entry goes to Shri. Harshad Sarpotdar)\n\nShri. Shreepad Babajee Thakurdesai - ICS\n\nThe first ICS selected from the then Bombay state from First Batch for ICS.\n\nPadmavibhooshan Vishnoo Shreedhar Wakankar, Ujjaini\n\nA great and widely respected name among Archeological researchers, his chief contribution among many is his tracing out, for the very First time, with ample scientific proofs the exact location, provinces and the geographical way of flowing of river Saraswati which is said to have vanished and there are mysterious stories about it. Dr. V. S. Wakankar was born as it were to establish the truth after researches that it was flowing through deserts of Rajasthan and due to natural calamities it got lost to us. It was a very sound finding and he was honoured for that by the President of India.\n\nShri. Waakhale, Sagar\n\nThe first Maharashtrian on whose name there is a Hindusthani Classical Music gharanaa is a Shri. Waakhale, from Sagar, MP. Gharanaa is a respectable and popular terminology for differentiating one style of classical music presentation from that of other styles. There are the Gharaanaas known in classical music such as Gwalior, Jaipur, Agra, Mewati etc. but in Northern India, a Gharaanaa on the name of Shri. Waakhale is respected and reputed. It may, perhaps from this time or any other the musical schools, known as place names as given above, started knowing from the Guru's names. Nowadays we find references of this type for remembering the contribution of the Gharana Guru by that person's name. For example, Bakhale Gharaana, the eminent Kashalkar Gharaanaa, Gunidas alias Jagannathbuwa Purohit Gharaanaa, Suresh Talwalkar Gharaanaa in Tablaa, like wise Yashwant Buva Mirashi, Shankarrao Sapre, Paradkar, Jitendra Abhisheki, Govindrao Tembye etc. are the Gharaanaas / very much respected names from Karhaadaa Brahman community. The eminent violinist Shri. Joag, the disciple of Shri. Waakhale is one such among many North Indian musicians."
