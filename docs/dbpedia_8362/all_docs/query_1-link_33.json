It is a broader process that is taking place all over the country. We are all aware how prominent intellectuals, lawyers’ writers, poets, activists, students, leaders, they are all put into jail because they have expressed their dissent or raised questions about the ruling powers of India.

As long as the fight for jal-jangal-jameen remains, as long as the fight of Dalits, Adivasis, workers, peasants, oppressed nationalities remains, as long as the question of creating a better world for all people and a better state for all people remains, the fight of all political prisoners will rage on. At the end of the day, I am a bard who sings the songs of the people and I will continue to echo their cries.

The 84-year-old Jesuit priest and tribal rights activist – arrested over alleged links to Naxals – was the country’s oldest inmate charged under the anti-terror law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. “But we still sing in chorus. A caged bird can still sing,” he famously wrote in a letter from jail. But a storied life – of fighting injustice and defending human rights – came to a poor, undignified end, as Swamy battled not only with advanced Parkinson’s disease and coronavirus while awaiting trial, but also the apathy of the State that denied him basic amenities like socks, a sweater, and a blanket to stave off the cold of his jail cell, and a a straw and a sipper to drink water.\n\nRead more\n\nFather Stan Swamy remembered in Bengaluru on second death anniversary\n\n07/07/2023\n\nThe indian Express / by Express News Service\n\nFather Frazer Mascarenhas, the former principal of St Xaviers College in Mumbai, in whose care Fr Swamy was in his last days, termed the Jharkhand-based activist as a committed Jesuit and scholar and recalled his activism towards the welfare of the tribal communities.\n\nFather Stan Swamy, the Jesuit priest who died while in judicial custody in connection with Elgaar Parishad case, was remembered on his second death anniversary at an event held in Bengaluru on Wednesday.\n\nRead more\n\nPanel discussion on civic literacy held to commemorate Father Stan Swamy’s second death anniversary\n\n06/07/2023\n\nThe Telegraph / by Pheroze L.

Stan Swamy’s Legacy Today!\n\n04/07/2023\n\nCountercurrents.org / by Cedric Prakash\n\n… Given the grim realities which throttle the nation today, one person whose physical presence is greatly missed today is that of Jesuit Father Stan Swamy. Two years ago on 5 July 2021, he said ‘good-bye’ to us, having completed his pilgrimage here on earth. He was arrested on 8 October 2020 on fabricated charges, incarcerated in the Taloja jail where he suffered very much. His terrible and untimely death is regarded by many as ‘institutional murder’. He has still not been declared ‘innocent’ by the courts. However, Stan (as he was called by all very lovingly) the man, mission and message -lives on in the hearts and lives of thousands everywhere. He has left us with a rich legacy and challenges us to live that legacy today.\n\nRead more\n\nAlso read/watch:\n\nVideo: Testimony of Stan Swamy, two days before his arrest on 8 October 2020.\n\nen | 7:48 min | Oct 6, 2020\n\nWatch video\n\nI am not a Silent Spectator – Why Truth has become so bitter, Dissent so intolarable, Justice so out of reach\n\nAn Autobiographical Fragment, Memory and Reflection\n\nIndian Social Institute, Bangalore | by Stan Swamy | August 2021\n\nEdition: Aug 2021\n\nPublisher: Indian Social Institute, Bangalore\n\nLanguage: English\n\nPaperback: 149 pages\n\nAccess a free PDF copy of the book here"
