        "text": "'Chandrashala' - Awishkar's children's theatre wing to be revived...\n\nMTG editorial\n\nIn order to keep Awishkar's rich tradition of Marathi children's theatre going, Mohan Joshi, the Chairman of the Marathi Natya Parishad extended his support to the revival of Awishkar's children's theatre wing - 'Chandrashala'. This would be a befitting tribute to Sulabha Deshpande who was the founder of Chandrashala. Joshi said this at the recently held memorial service of Sulabha Deshpande at Yashwant Natyamandir in Matunga. The veteran actress passed away on 4th June 2016.\n\nSulabha Deshpande was remembered as much for her warm smile, effortless acting, as for her relentless crusade for experimental theatre.\n\nInterestingly, the plot of land on which the Marathi Natya Parishad stands today, was once allotted to Chandrashala by the BMC Government. However, due to the paucity of funds, Awishkar could not avail of the reward granted to it and so Prabhakar Panshikar, the then Chairman of the Natya Parishad, urged the Government to transfer the land to the Natya Parishad, which in turn would provide space for Chandrashala. Although the Natya Parishad flourished on the plot of land originally pledged to Awishkar, Chandrashala was never accommodated in it. Promises were not kept. Sulabha Deshpande along with Vijay Tendulkar and Damu Kenkre had raised their voice for the rightful place for children's theatre but to no avail.\n\nVeteran actor, Chandrakant Kulkarni jogged everybody's memory about this bone of contention upon Deshpande's demise. Mohan Joshi promptly pledged to make amends and revive Chandrashala by providing it an appropriate place.\n\nThe memorial service was attended by Sulabha Deshpande's family members. Many others who had known her and shared a close association with her were present too. The condolence meeting concluded with Chandrashala's song rendered by its former theatre artistes - all grown-up women now who recalled their days as Chandrashala's child artistes - the many Durgas of its famous production - DURGA ZAALI GAURI.\n\nread / post your comments\n\nMore on Theatre Update\n\n- 22 Plays, 22 Languages, 1 Stage - Prem Utsav 2024 by Mujeeb Khan (new)\n\n- Makrand Deshpande announces ''ANSH MANCH'' Theatre Festival at Prithvi\n\n- An exquisite evening of Theatre and Performing Arts held in Hyderabad National icons light up the stage\n\n- Unicorn Actors Studio pays tribute to late Tripurari Sharma\n\n- USHA KI KIRAN - A Five-Day Summer Theatre Festival in Kolkata\n\n- Plays Happening this week: 29th May - 02nd June 2024\n\n- AI fever hits Marathi play AAJJI BAI JORAT!\n\n- Interesting Plays Happening This Weekend\n\n- Lists Of Plays Happening This Weekend\n\n- Don't miss: Ila Arun - K K Raina's AJAATSHATRU\n\n- Ebrahim Alkazi's Biography Released\n\n- Theatre Community Pays Tribute to Begum Razia Baig\n\n- World Theatre Day 2024 message by Jon FOSSE\n\n- WORLD THEATRE DAY 2024: Check Out what theatre fraternity has to speak\n\n- RAGHUNATH SWEEPS META\n\nTheatre Update Archives\n\nDiscussion Board"
