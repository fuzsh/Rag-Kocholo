        "text": "Ani… Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar is a Marathi biographical drama film directed by Abhijeet Deshpande. This film follows through the ups and downs of the life of legendary Marathi play and film actor Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar. The film is based on a biography titled “Nath Ha Maza” written by his second wife Kanchan Ghanekar.\n\nThe film sets in the golden era of Marathi play and film industry, specifically from 1960 to 1986. The film depicts the incredible journey of a dental surgeon and renowned stage actor Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar (Subodh Bhave) to the peak of fame, and events that shaken his personal and professional life, and which has ultimately brought him down. Kashinath was said to be the first superstar of the Marathi stage with a lot of glamour, and he was the highest paid star from the years 1960 to 1980 (from wiki).\n\nThe film which is based on a biography has to put efforts on deciding what parts it needs to focus on, and what it should not. And this film does this thing flawlessly, it focusses on the most important moments in the lead character’s life. The defining moments in Kashinath’s life are very well represented on screen, one of which is when he gets the role of Sambhaji in the play “Raigadhala Jevha Jaag Yete” (When Raigad awakens), and which made him a popular actor ever since. The arc of Kashinath’s life has been represented in such a beautiful way that even when the film ends and names start rolling on a screen you’ll definitely crave for a little more of it.\n\nThis film is definitely the nostalgic and surprising treat for the people who have actually witnessed this era. Along with Kashinath Ghanekar, the characters like Vasant Kanetkar (Anand Ingle), Balaji Pendarkar (Mohan Joshi), Sulochana Didi (Sonali Kulkarni), Prabhakar Panshikar (Prasad Oak), Master Dattaram (Suhas Palshikar), and Dr. Shriram Lagoo (Sumeet Raghvan) gets alive on screen one after the other. And seeing all these pioneers of Marathi film industry on screen is a just mesmerizing experience. A cold war between Dr. Kashinath Ghanekar and his rival Dr. Shriram Lagoo is a sheer fun to watch.\n\nEach and every cast member of the film has delivered the solid and compelling performances. Dialogues and conversations between characters give more depth to them. The production design of the film is impressive, the recreated set pieces can be identified but never creates the distraction. As the film goes on, it feels choppy in some places and gets a bit slow, but the surprising series of events and the addition of new characters keep the film alive.\n\nVerdict : Language and content-wise it is a regional film but for the solid script and the powerful performances it’s a worth watch.\n\nRating : 4/5"
