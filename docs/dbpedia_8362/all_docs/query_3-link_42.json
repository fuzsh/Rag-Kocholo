        "text": "At 11, Raghunandan began his formal study of music in Mumbai under the tutelage of the late Pandit Vasantrao Kulkarni. Six years later, he commenced training with the doyen of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana, Gaan Saraswati Smt. Kishori Amonkar. Over the next 20 years up to the year 2000, under Kishori-ji's keen guidance, he worked painstakingly to imbibe her complex and unique musical style through rigorous daily riyaaz. During this time, Raghunandan was also fortunate to learn from Kishori-ji's mother and guru, the late Gaan Tapaswini Smt. Mogubai Kurdikar, who had learned directly from the the late Sangeet Samrat Ustad Alladiya Khan, founder of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana. By training with both Mogubai-ji and Kishori-ji, Raghunandan achieved an authenticity in many aspects of the Jaipur-Atrauli style - a full throated akaar, dazzling taans, a sophisticated use of techniques such as meend and gamak, and a clever grasp of the intricacies of layakari.\n\nHowever, it is sometimes very difficult to keep a truly creative soul bound within the walls of a single school. Today, Raghunandan's âGayakiâ has evolved into a unique and original style enriched immensely by influences of several contemporary maestros. Decades of relentless âriyazâ and complete surrender to Music are now reflecting very clearly in his performances. He has rightfully earned his place among the topmost vocalists of his generation.\n\nIn addition to a mastery of the presentation of classical raags, Raghunandan's command of semi-classical genres (thumri, ghazal, bhajan, abhang, natya sangeet, bhaawgeet etc) accounts for his versatility & singularity among Hindustani vocalists. Over the years, Raghunandan has developed an innate, emotive vocal quality and honed his Hindi/Urdu, Marathi, and Sanskrit diction. Raghunandan has recorded numerous classical vocal albums under reputed record labels such as HMV (Mumbai), Sony, Times Music and Alurkar Music House (Pune).\n\nThe magic of Raghunandan's voice has charmed audiences throughout India and abroad. Very early in his musical career, he has already been conferred with numerous awards.\n\nThe restless creative urge within, has however taken Raghunandan far beyond the confines of a typical vocalistâs accomplishments.\n\nPlayback Singing :\n\nThe Hindi art-film by Govind Nihalani, âDrishtiâ, whose music was composed by Kishori-ji.\n\nAlbums as a Music Composer/Director :\n\nSeveral albums solely composed by him have been released by reputed Music companies\n\nThe series of âHealth Mantraâ by Times Music\n\nâManas Pujaâ and Devi by HMV Sa Re Ga Ma\n\nOmkaranand Darshanam\n\nOmkaranand Vandanam\n\nâKaivari Hanumanâ\n\nRamakrishna Bhajanamrut\n\nâMore Sawariyaâ (Fusion music)\n\nAlbums as a lead singer :\n\nHe has also worked for several noted music directors for their albums such as\n\nKaushal Inamdar\n\nMithilesh Patankar\n\nNilesh Mohrir\n\nJeevan Dharmadhikari\n\nNarendra Bhide\n\nKedar Pandit\n\nDr. Sunil Kale\n\nMilind Joshi\n\nNotable Awards :\n\nSmt.Manik Verma Puraskar (2005, Pune)\n\n'Dattopant Deshpande Puraskar' (1992, Pune)\n\nâSangeet Kala Ratna Puraskarâ (2000, Patna)\n\nUpadhye Smriti Puraskar for contribution in Indian Classical Music\n\nPrabha Atre Gaurav Puraskar\n\nMusic Direction for Marathi Theatre :\n\nRaghunandan has earned accolades for original music score for the Marathi play 'Avagha Ranga Ekachi Jala' written by Dr. Meena Nerurkar and produced by Natyasampada.\n\nZee Gaurav Puraskar\n\nMaharashtra Times Sanman\n\nAn Award from the Government of Maharashtra\n\nPt.
