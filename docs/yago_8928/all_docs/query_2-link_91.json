        "text": "Here are some annotated bibliographies that do a good job of locating reliable sources and annotating those sources so that we know how they are relevant to the author’s essential question. They may also help you locate some additional sources for your own comparative analysis. I recommend that you read these as models of what you should do in your research and how you should synthesize that research in your annotated bibliography:\n\nAshley’s Annotated Bibliography\n\nCharlotte’s Annotated Bibliography\n\nJohn’s Annotated Bibliography\n\nStephanie’s Annotated Bibliography\n\nFranz Kafka (1883-1924) was born in Prague and was unknown as a writer during his life. Kafka was plagued by feelings of unworthiness and debilitating anxiety due to his Jewish background, his emotionally abusive relationship with his father, and his health problems (he was diagnosed with tuberculosis at 34 and eventually died from it 7 years later). It was not until after his death that his writings began to be translated and he gained international status as a foundational figure in Modernist literature. In fact, his small body of work has become so influential that it led to a new word: Kafkaesque, which means senseless, disorienting complexity; a sense of impending danger or surreal distortion; or nightmarish. Kafka’s work often presents characters who are trapped in absurd situations that reflect realistic problems.\n\nThese absurd situations are often allegories, or stories that signify a universal lesson by presenting characters, plots, and images that symbolize another actual situation. The lesson to be learned from an allegory has a religious, social, moral, or political significance and characters are often personifications of abstract ideas such as greed, charity, or envy. Many critics read The Metamorphosis as an allegory about modern life.\n\nThe storyline of The Metamorphosis can be read as a remix of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, a mock-epic poem which relates various tales of human transformation from Greek mythology. This slideshow will help you to better understand both Kafka and The Metamorphosis:\n\nHere’s a short film that dramatizes The Metamorphosis (it’s no substitute for reading the story, though):"
