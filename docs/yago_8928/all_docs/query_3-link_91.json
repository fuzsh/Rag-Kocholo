        "text": "Invaders from Proxima B shows the Jankins family — a loving and endearing household in the middle of contending with the dad’s work schedule that requires him to be on the road often. The Jankins family gets thrown for a loop when a funny, mysterious, and loveable alien named Chuck. The film premiered last year at the Austin Film Festival and is directed and written by Ward Roberts, who also plays the father, Howie Jankins.\n\nGood Story\n\nIn Roberts’ first effort writing and directing a full-length film, Invaders from Proxima B features a well-written and creative plot that may catch the average viewer off guard. However, the story starts to work against the rest of the production as the final act features many moving parts, numerous characters, and a campy but fun action sequence. The plot also lends itself well to a solid screenplay that allows viewers to get to know all the characters throughout the movie.\n\nThe film’s tone is well-set early as the reciprocated love between Howie and his family is put on display. Chuck’s arrival, both on Earth and in the story, only improves and builds on the feel-good nature of the movie. Chuck’s presence does a great job of inviting all other characters to traverse and explore their whacky natures of themselves that they may not have otherwise had to face. Chuck is what allows the story to take the heart-warming family ties and elevate them to something more expected from a sci-fi comedy.\n\nDespite being a roughly 90-minute production, the movie does have some pacing issues, especially as the story is being wrapped up. The plot lends enough intrigue to engage the viewers and build interest in the characters and their fate, however, there are points that seem to drag and risk losing the attention and interest of a viewer. This is an interesting issue, considering the movie is at its best when featuring fast-paced quirky sequences. Although noticeable, these shortcomings by no means condemn the entire film.\n\nFun Performances\n\nAlthough there are a handful of familiar faces, Samantha Sloyan gives a suitable performance as Howie’s wife, Jane Jankins. Sloyan is mostly known for her work in horror (Midnight Mass, Hush, The Haunting of Hill House) and drama (Grey’s Anatomy, SEAL Team). Fans will likely be happy to see Sloyan in an opportunity to lend her talents to a more lighthearted project. Another familiar face is Richard Riehle, who boasts a long career in Hollywood, including a brief but memorable cameo in the 2001 movie Joe Dirt. Riehle utilizes his screen presence as Willy Felson, one of the few humans on Earth aware of the existence of aliens. Willy and his son Marvin play well to the humorous nature of the story. Perhaps the most noteworthy performance comes from the youngest member of the cast, Bo Roberts. Roberts plays Howie’s daughter, Ruby Jankins, and gives a near-seamless portrayal. Her apparent comfort in delivering her lines is quite remarkable. Sarah Lassez and Jeremiah Birkett also joined the cast and helped give life to two of the more zany characters in the movie, Ester Terrestrial and Nathan Droogal. Their intentionally over-the-top portrayals play well in their respective spoof commercials shown during the film. Scenes such as the commercials seem to indicate the amount of fun that was likely had during the production of Invaders. Chuck’s character is slightly reminiscent of the movie Paul and its title character. Although it’s difficult to understand Chuck’s true intentions at times, his good nature shines through with ease.\n\nFilmFactor Score: 5 / 10\n\nStory/Plot: 1.5 | Acting: 0.5 | Direction: 0.5 | Screenplay/Dialogue: 0.5 | Overall Production: 0.5 | Entertainment Value: 0.5\n\nJe Ne Sais Quoi: 1\n\nEngaging\n\nAlthough not a glaring issue throughout the movie, there are moments that can benefit from more mindful lighting or better angle utilization. Despite this, most of the shots are very engaging and the overall experience is rather intimate for the viewer. There is a brilliant scene where Jane is about to make first physical contact with Chuck and the camera work helps build anticipation. This is one of those scenes in the industry that can easily lose its luster with any lack of intention or attentiveness to the craft. The entire production was about doing more with less. With a bigger budget, Chuck would’ve likely been rendered using CGI but instead, he was portrayed by a puppet. Immediately, this restricts some shots and limits the on-screen capability of Chuck but Roberts deserves a lot of credit for making this a virtual non-issue throughout the movie. Roberts didn’t just hide and mask this limitation during filming, he tested bounds and demonstrated his creativity to put Chuck into humorous spots that came across well in a comedy. There is an almost inescapable level of campiness that low-budget films must contend with. Fortunately for Invaders, this isn’t as noticeable in all genres.\n\nOut of the entire movie, the action sequence in the third act could’ve benefited the most from extra consideration. It seemed caught between going for the gag and trying to deliver compelling action but ultimately both were sacrificed. Movies such as the 1990 live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, have shown that this balance is more than achievable. Gratuitous camera shaking during the scene didn’t help matters.\n\nVerdict\n\nInvaders from Proxima B is an all-around fun movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family. Films such as this do a great job of capturing the wonder of not only fans but also aspiring filmmakers. It delivers on expectations and is a welcome addition to the subgenre of friendly alien encounters. It would be no surprise if Chuck is able to capture the hearts and imaginations of younger audiences that would likely be interested in repeat viewings, especially with the potential for a sequel."
