        "text": "AFI Fest - Film #6\n\n\"Will you die before me?\"\n\nIn a beautifully shot movie where the characters speak French, English, German, and Russian, Eva Green stars as Sarah Loreau, a woman who earns the chance to go up into space. Mike Shannon (Matt Dillon) will join her on her mission. He needles her constantly about being a woman and French:\n\n-\"French women are really good when it comes to... cooking.\"\n\n-When you were a kid singing \"Frere Jacques\"\n\n-He also refers to her as \"space tourist\"\n\nMost of the time is spent at space bootcamp in Russia. I would have preferred more of a story instead of showing her train so much. However, the movie revolves around being a…\n\nProxima uses the logistics of space travel as a frame to explore its implications for Sarah, a French astronaut and the only woman on her crew of three going to Mars. Sarah is also a mother and her job – as much as it is a dream come true – means separation from her young daughter, Stella. The process starts early, with weeks of training at a Russian camp. Each copes with it in their own way, holding back the powerful emotions threatening to burst when they keep missing each other, but nothing can make up for the emptiness and longing they feel.\n\nCareful and delicate in its approach, Proxima doesn’t force Sarah to choose between her job and motherhood.…\n\nLook folks, I’m not a monster. The relationship between Eva Green’s character Sarah and her daughter is sweet; I’m not denying that. Before the screening, writer/director Alice Winocour spoke about how she drew on her own relationship with her daughter when making Proxima. I very much feel that she understood the mindset and idiosyncrasies of a seven-year-old. The film was shot in the space exploration facilities in which it was set, and this authenticity sure shone through.\n\nDespite this, Proxima was only marginally rewarding. Sadly, the elements that stand out in my mind were the ones that left a sour taste in my mouth. Despite being directed by Winocour who has two features under her belt (not including this one),…\n\nIf you’re going into this expecting a flashy sci-fi space romp, then you’ll be very disappointed. Instead what Proxima is is a very emotional look at motherhood and parenting, driven by an Oscar-calibre performance by Eva Green. It’s truly beautiful, very delicate in the way it tells the story of this woman torn between her duty as an astronaut and her duty as a mother.\n\nEva Green has never not been good, she’s an actress that’s always impressed me with her bold choices and daring acting style. This is a whole new kind of Eva Green that is in Proxima though, perhaps this is a new direction for her after playing the bad girl for so long. She’s very very…\n\n\"There's no such thing as a perfect astronaut, just like there's no such thing as a perfect mother.\"\n\n...\n\nProxima is an astronaut movie that is partly reminiscent of a documentary due to the photographs of female astronauts with their children in the end credits but very boring... Having a story inspired by many astronaut mothers may be an example of feminist direction, but the course of the story, especially the last scenes, is a bit disappointing. Apparently the author thinks that only female astronauts are 'parents' or that male astronauts don't care about their relationships with their children. In the final scene, the lead role does something truly stupid for her daughter and out of maternal feelings that no…"
