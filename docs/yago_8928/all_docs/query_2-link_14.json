        "text": "Solaris. cinema texts publishes the new book by Carlos Atanes\n\nAn exercise in film memory that questions, addresses and analyzes, in a light but rigorous key, the relationship between the cinematographic act and the dream world.\n\nIn the presentation of the projection of Cemetery of Splendor (Rak ti Khon Kaen, 2015) at the Gijón Festival, its author, the taiApichatpong Weerasethakul, apart from trying to offer an expeditious path to the pronunciation of his name, gave several keys to face his cinema, a classic on the festival circuit, far removed from any commercial conception. The main, and most surprising, was to suggest to the viewer that, if he \"felt like it\", he should not be afraid to \"take a nap\" during the course of his film, which was \"part of the experience\" of his cinema. A statement that, of course, aroused laughter among the public but, nevertheless, it is not negligible, since many of his films move on that limit that separates consciousness from subconsciousness.\n\nA precept that is also defended by the Filipino Lav Diaz, whose filmography is made up of titles that in some cases extend over eight hours of footage. For Diaz, sleeping during the exhibition of one of his works allows the viewer to unite both experiences, altering the interpretation according to the moment in which the subject returns to the state of vigilance – if that is the case. A risky but enormously interesting approach because in the end the cinema would be a process of «inception», uniting the two aforementioned authors with another whose conception of this art is at another extreme: Christopher Nolan and his From (Inception, 2010). Cinema as the seed of a sensation, of a feeling, of a state of euphoria or denial.\n\nfilm dreams\n\nPrecisely, the book by Carlos Atanes begins with an anecdote film dreams (2021), published by Solaris. cinema texts – by the way, the most attractive publishing house that has emerged in the last five years, which theorizes about cinema with the same quality that aesthetically wraps your texts. The anecdote in question places us at the moment in which Billy Wilder, with his mandatory decalogue at the ready, anticipates what will be the commercial destiny of the new Louis Malle film, The Unicorn (Black Moon, 1975); at a time when the box office seemed to mark the survival and extinction of any film, whatever its nature.\n\nMalle had described to Wilder that his film would be about \"a dream within a dream.\" Wilder immediately responded: \"Now you can say goodbye to your two and a half million dollars\", with regard to the budget that the Thumerie director had managed to raise for his work. Wilder argued that there could be nothing more boring than bringing a dream to the screen. A belief that went against the thinking of the pioneers who laid the foundations of film art. The rise of the psychoanalytic of dreams, which has as its axis The interpretation of dreams (Die Traumdeutung, Sigmund Freud, 1900), precisely coincided with the first steps of the cinematograph in the middle of the patent war.\n\nIs not the cinema, perhaps, the embodiment of consciousness and subconsciousness projected on a surface?\n\nThis question joins others raised by Atanes: \"To what extent is it really possible to film dreams?\", \"Is a film a dream?\", \"How is dreaming similar to the act of shooting a film?\", \"Does cinema have an inherent link with the world of dreams that is superior to that of other arts?\" or \"Does cinema serve to unravel the secrets of our dreams?\" Labyrinthine issues in a certain way that the author resolves with humor and, above all, rigor. Because behind Atanes' reflections lies a deep love for the act of creating and watching cinema, and this passion is captured with clairvoyance, also opening the way to all those films and publications that support his thinking. The truth is that, returning to the anecdote about The Unicorn, Wilder erred about the (little) interest that the dream has and its filmic translation, in which it was a slave assertion of a present. Cinema is probably the ability to daydream. A quality that celebrates the essential prose of Atanes.\n\nfilm dreams. Orbits Collection. Number 1. Edition date: October 2021. Pages: 140.
