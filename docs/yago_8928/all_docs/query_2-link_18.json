His work forms a cocktail of dream worlds, black comedy,, philosophical provocations, parallel dimensions, dystopias, and narrative transgressions. He has always conceived his work in different media, both narrative and non- fiction, as a tool to explore the interstices and fissures in the walls of consensual reality.\n\nTom Bessoir\n\nBorn in New York City in 1957, Tom Bessoir attended The Bronx High School of Science and studied electrical engineering and mathematics at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. While at The Cooper Union, he studied filmmaking with Robert Breer, Joshua Pines, and Sandy Moore. Tom Bessoir’s experimental films often use mathematics to explore perception and the structure of film. In the arts, Tom Bessoir is best known for Microfilm (1979), Digits of Pi (2019), and his photography documenting downtown NYC.\n\nMatthew Carlson\n\nMatthew Carlson is a moving image artist living and working in Queens, New York. He received a BFA in Film/Video from Pratt Institute in 2015 and worked with Artforum, Marina Abramović, and the production company Faliro House. His work has been included in multiple group screenings at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Pratt Manhattan, and the Robert Rauschenberg gallery in South Florida. He currently spends his days as a trailer editor and social media manager for the Film-Makers’ Cooperative.\n\nAbigail Child\n\nAbigail Child is a filmmaker, poet, and writer who has been active in experimental writing and media since the 1970s. She has completed more than thirty film and video works and installations, and six books. Child's early film work addressed the interplay between sound and image through reshaping narrative tropes, prefiguring many concerns of contemporary film and media.\n\nMichelle Handelman\n\nMichelle Handelman uses video, live performance and photography to make confrontational works that explore the sublime in its various forms of excess and nothingness. Her background is a study in opposites – raised during the late 60s/early 70s, Handelman split her time between Chicago, where her mother was a fixture in the art world, and Los Angeles, where her father was a player in the counterculture sex industry. Over the years Handelman has voraciously traversed both these worlds, developing a body of work that investigates ways of looking at the forbidden and revealing dark, subconscious layers of outsider agency.\n\nKen Jacobs\n\n\"One of the founders of the American avant-garde cinema, Ken Jacobs (b. 1933) has been working ceaselessly and boundlessly in film, video and moving image performance for over fifty years. Jacobs began working in a mode of guerilla cinema, shooting anarchic and exuberant – yet also politically astute – theatrics in the streets of his native New York in the early 1950s, including a number of prescient and Beat infused works – Little Stabs at Happiness, the shorts included in The Whirled – made with a very young Jack Smith.\n\nFascinated with early cinema and experimental film from a young age, Jacobs gradually turned to found footage as a dominant inspiration, a breakthrough marked by his seminal deconstruction of cinematic narrative and illusionism Tom, Tom the Piper’s Son (1969), which famously manipulates and expands a 1905 film of the same name to create a breathless and revelatory work of pure cinema. Early “primitive” cinema, and increasingly, nineteenth century photography, has remained a touchstone in Jacobs’ work and a principal tool to launch an extended critique of the aesthetic, ideological and technological limits defining film and the cinematic apparatus itself. In the 1970s Jacobs took this critique to another level, defining what he termed “paracinema,” a radical mode of moving image performance that included his Nervous System Performances, transformative film experiences that use two simultaneous 16mm projectors and a variety of live sound and music to explore those audio-visual dimensions hidden within the film strip. Endlessly curious about technology, Jacobs embraced the possibilities of video in a meeting of the digital, early film/photography and 3-D imagery that magically bridges the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries and has given way to such powerful and sublimely beautiful works as Krypton is Doomed, and, most recently, Razzle Dazzle: The Lost World. Among Jacobs’ most important inventions is his Nervous Magic Lantern, a mysterious and mesmerizing performance of light and shadow that returns to cinema’s most essential roots, and which he evocatively describes as 'cinema without film or electronics.'\" - Harvard Film Archive\n\nKen Kobland\n\nKen Kobland is a New York born and based filmmaker who has been working since the seventies. He has been recognized in a plethora of festivals and collaborated with the Wooster Group.\n\nLewis Klahr\n\nLewis Klahr (born 1956) is a Los Angeles based collage artist who uses found images and sound to explore the intersection of memory and history. He is primarily known for his uniquely idiosyncratic films, which he began creating in 1977 and have screened extensively in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Lewis Klahr teaches in the Theater School of the California Institute of the Arts.\n\nMichael Siporin Levine\n\nMichael Siporin Levine is a visual artist living and working in Brooklyn, NY. Working across disciplines, he creates prints, drawings, films, animations, and installations that mix autobiography with abstraction and invention. Michael has shown his work both nationally and internationally. Some recent noteworthy residencies and fellowships include a summer residency at Goggleworks Center for the Arts in Reading, PA (2019); a visiting Artist in Residency at Wesleyan College (2019, Macon, GA); a residency and solo exhibition/performance at Galeria Wschodnia (2018, Łódź, Poland); and a summer residency at Vermont Studio Center (2017).\n\nAnn Deborah Levy\n\nAnn Deborah Levy, whose work is informed by her beginnings in painting, is a filmmaker focused on perception and natural imagery.\n\nCynthia Madansky\n\nIntegrating hybrid forms and narrative traditions, the films of Cynthia Madansky engage with cultural and political themes, foregrounding human experience and personal testimony. Recently Madansky has begun integrating drawing on celluloid, creating a series of new work which experiments with optical printing, hand processing and painting.\n\nArcangelo Mazzoleni\n\nGraduated in direction from Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia of Rome and in Modern and Contemporary Italian Literature, he's a total artist: poet, documentary filmmaker, photographer and visual artist, writer of books on film language and theory. He taught film at University, Screenwriting at Rai-Italian Radio and Television. He works in collaboration with his wife Mariella Buscemi, screenwriter and author.
