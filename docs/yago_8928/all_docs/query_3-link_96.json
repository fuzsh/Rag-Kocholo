        "text": "Dir: Alice Winocour; Starring: Eva Green, Zélie Boulant-Lemesle, Matt Dillon, Lars Eidinger, Sandra Hüller, Aleksey Fateev. 12A cert, 107 min\n\nWe’ve long got used to films taking us into space – so much so that the Soviet astronaut Alexey Leonov felt he’d been there twice, both when he became the first human to spacewalk in 1965, and then when he saw 2001: A Space Odyssey three years later.\n\nUnique in its genre, Proxima does something rather radical in contemplating the heavens. For starters, it renders the nuts and bolts of preparation so realistically that they’re defamiliarised, giving us the docu-style build-up to a space mission rather than the mission itself. Instead of thrusting hastily into orbit, it’s about the downward gravitational pull of Mother Earth, and of motherhood.\n\nEva Green plays Sarah, a French astronaut given the chance to step in as someone’s late replacement for a year-long stint on the International Space Station. Her thrill at the opportunity is laced with guilt and worry about her eight-year-old daughter Stella (Zélie Boulant-Lemesle), a tough tyke from whose father (Lars Eidinger) Sarah is amicably separated.\n\nNaturally, other high-octane careers can separate parents from their children for long, emotionally difficult stretches. But Sarah’s is the only known job which will require her daughter, once pre-flight quarantine is over, to watch her literally leaving the planet.\n\nOver two years, the director, Alice Winocour, researched the training process at the European Space Agency in Cologne, and in particular she looked at the challenges women faced to hold their own in a traditionally male field. Sarah has to check in with a veteran American captain, Mike (Matt Dillon, hinting at a Trumpian smarm), who can hardly resist implying she’s a space tourist: when he introduces her to the team with a quip about French women and their cooking abilities, the narrowing of Green’s eyes suggests an asp that’s just had its nest poked.\n\nGetting match-fit for their mission involves a daunting regime of physical workouts and trial scenarios, many done in an underwater simulator. Sarah is forever strapping on pieces of hi-tech kit – an artificial arm, say – or practising space work cocooned inside an Oculus Rift VR setup, as if auditioning to function as a human machine. At the same time, her body keeps openly rejecting this forced evolution as something unnatural. After reaching G-Force 9 in a centrifuge, she throws up; and a festering leg wound stubbornly refuses to heal with days to go.\n\nThese all feel like psychosomatic symptoms of the pending separation with Stella – her mother’s Proxima, you might say, in the sense of its closest satellite star. In the wonderfully named Zélie Boulant-Lemesle, Winocour has found a young actress who is very believably Green’s daughter, and matches her at times for fire and grit: when Stella wanders off unattended during a draggy briefing session, sparks fly when she’s found; and Sarah immediately checks herself for fear of inflicting some further last-minute trauma.\n\nWinocour has given this low-key, earthbound picture some smart dramatic shape, by making it trace the contours of a tense space mission, complete with a sequence in which Sarah breaks protocol and must bypass security to make her daughter feel safe – a little like Sigourney Weaver braving the alien lair to rescue Newt in Aliens. The contrast makes its own point, reinforcing this film’s brand of tender, hand-made credibility.\n\nIn Green, who can put on such a show of defiant assurance while subtly falling apart, we have the ideal star for this innerspace war, in which Sarah feels like a stricken mutineer to both sides of herself. Getting up into space is palpably tougher for her than for any of her male colleagues; the sacrifices more intense.\n\nStanding apart from a genre (First Man, Ad Astra, Interstellar, High Life) that can be remorselessly dad-obsessed, this one goes out – with photos at the end to prove it – to the 65 female space travellers, many of them mothers, who have so far snagged a seat.\n\nProxima is in cinemas from Friday"
