        "text": "Carlos Atanes was born in Barcelona, Spain on 1971 and has been making underground movies since the last century. His work forms a cocktail of dream worlds, black comedy, black comedy, philosophical provocations, parallel dimensions, dystopias, narrative transgressions and cultural influences (underground film, viennese actionism, comics, arte povera, esotericism, science fiction, new german cinema...). He has always conceived his work in different media, both narrative and non- fiction, as a tool to explore the interstices and fissures in the walls of consensual reality."
