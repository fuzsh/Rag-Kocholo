[These worlds are inhabited] if not exactly as our own, and if not more nobly, at least no less inhabited and no less nobly.\"[1] Allusions to inhabitants of other stars' planetary systems remained rare in literature for many centuries thereafter. One of these is found in Voltaire's Micromégas (1752), which features a traveller from Sirius.[2]\n\nAs science fiction became established in the early 20th century, destinations such as the Moon, Mars, Venus and other bodies within the Solar System began to seem stale. Authors invoked a variety of mechanisms for superluminal travel and placed their stories on worlds in planetary systems around other stars, a shift that gave them the freedom to construct exotic fictional planets and themes. This tendency became predominant once the exploration of the Solar System was complete enough to conclusively demonstrate the unlikelihood of any highly developed form of extraterrestrial life there.\n\nAlthough some of the stars named in works of science fiction are purely imaginary, many authors and artists have preferred to use the names of real stars that are well known to astronomers, either because they are notably bright in the sky or because they are relatively close to Earth.\n\nThe brightest stars\n\nDespite the increasing tempo of discovery of extrasolar planets in the galactic vicinity of the Sun, the prospects for the realization of imagined habitable worlds around the brightest stars are not good. Assuming that the Earth is typical, these stars are poor candidates to host planets supporting advanced life. The Solar System was already a billion years old before life appeared on Earth; complex life appeared in the Cambrian explosion three billion years later. Inherently bright stars like Sirius and Vega have total life-times of only about 1 billion years, and are unlikely to have nurtured the development of the rich biospheres essential to the existence of \"interesting\" inhabitants, or even bare habitability. Red giant stars are in a relatively short phase near the end of their lifetimes and are a scorching 100 times brighter than their original luminosity. Variable stars achieve significant brightness, but it may fluctuate over the long run by a total factor of several thousands, as their radii vary by up to 25%.\n\nExcept for a few unusually close stars,[3] those stars which are not so intrinsically bright as to be subject to the constraints of brief lifespan or waxing luminosity are at the same time so inconspicuous in the Earth's sky that they lack the proper names[4] that would make them attractive to science fiction authors. And so, plausibly or not, the creators of planets in various science fiction genres have very often cast their imagined habitable — or inhabited — worlds into orbits around the brightest stars in the sky.\n\nThe closest stars\n\nOf the 15 stars closest to the Sun, ten are red dwarfs, the exceptions being Alpha Centauri AB (classes G and K), Sirius AB (both class A), and Epsilon Eridani (class K). Four of the red dwarfs (Proxima Centauri, Barnard's Star, Wolf 359, and UV Ceti) are known or suspected to be flare stars, which may increase in brightness by a factor of 75 over a period of 20 seconds — a poor recommendation for habitability. On the other hand, stars of spectral type G and K are well suited for life.[5] Thus, nine of the closest 15 stars may possess viable Goldilocks zones. Of these, the yellow-orange star Epsilon Eridani actually hosts two asteroid belts and at least two long suspected but unconfirmed (as of 2011) planets, though these would lie beyond its habitable zone.\n\nAlthough the remaining red dwarfs nearest Earth may well harbour planets, their suitability for life is subject to debate on several grounds. Moreover, none of these dwarfs are visible to the unaided eye and most only through large telescopes, so that their names are technical star-list designations rather than evocative mythological ones. Nonetheless their very proximity, as well as the favorable availability of Alpha Centauri and Epsilon Eridani, has made them all (even the flare stars) popular choices for fictional accounts of humanity's first extrasolar voyages.\n\nPlanetary romances\n\nThe fictional genres that appear in the list below include films, television serials, interactive games, and print (among others). Of all these, the print genre, and specifically novels and novellas, are of note because they are very often planetary romances. Any science fiction tale whose primary venue is a planet, and whose plot turns on the nature of the planet, can be described as a planetary romance. It is not enough that the story simply be set on a world. For example, James Blish's A Case of Conscience is set on the planet Lithia, but it is not a planetary romance because the nature or description of this world has little bearing on the story being told. In the hard science fiction novels by Hal Clement ((see 61 Cygni: A Mission of Gravity below) and Robert L. Forward ((see Barnard's Star: Rocheworld below), the worlds on which they are set amount to little more than the sum of the physical and logical problems that they illustrate, and that their protagonists solve. In the true planetary romance, the world itself encompasses — and survives — the tale that temporarily illuminates it.[6] One seminal practitioner of the planetary romance was Edgar Rice Burroughs, as for example in his Barsoom (Mars) series (1912–1943). However, as with most writers of his era, his imagination did not extend beyond our own Solar System, so that his work is not found in this article.[7]\n\nGeneral uses of star names\n\nStars may be referred to in fictional works for their metaphorical (meta) or mythological (myth) associations, or else as points of light (light) in the sky of Earth, but not as locations in space or centers of planetary systems:\n\nThe Iliad (c. eighth cent BCE), epic poem attributed to Homer. Homer describes the final approach of the Greeks' shining warrior, Achilles, toward Troy by comparing him to the dazzling star Sirius: The aged Priam was the first of all whose eyes saw him / as he swept across the flat land in full shining, like that star / which comes on in the autumn and whose conspicuous brightness / far outshines the stars that are numbered in the night's darkening, / the star they give the name of Orion's Dog, which is brightest / among the stars, and yet is wrought as a sign of evil / and brings on the great fever for unfortunate mortals. / Such was the flare of the bronze that girt his chest in his running.[8] (light, myth)\n\nOedipus Rex (c. 429 BCE), play by Sophocles. In Scene IV the Corinthian shepherd describes keeping his flocks alongside those of the Theban shepherd all during three distant summers, from spring / Till rose Arcturus. He is trying to stimulate the Theban's memory about their long acquaintance prior to a fateful event: the Theban's entrusting the infant Oedipus to him, to be raised in Corinth, rather than killing the child as instructed by King Laius of Thebes.[9] (light)\n\nMetamorphoses (8 CE), Latin narrative poem by Ovid. The Roman poet describes the apotheosis of the murdered Julius Caesar as Caesar's Comet (C/-43 K1), possibly the brightest daylight comet in recorded history[10]: Kindly Venus, although seen by none, stood in the middle of the Senate-house, and caught from the dying limbs and trunk of her own Caesar his departing soul. She did not give it time so that it could dissolve in air, but bore it quickly up, toward all the stars of heaven; and on the way, she saw it gleam and blaze and set it free. Above the moon it mounted into heaven, leaving behind a long and fiery trail, and as a star it glittered in the sky.[11] (myth)\n\nJulius Caesar (1599), play written by William Shakespeare. In Act III, Scene I, Cassius proclaims his steadfastness, comparing himself to the star Polaris: But I am constant as the northern star, / Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality / There is no fellow in the firmament.[12] (light, meta)\n\n\"Polaris\" (1920), short story by H. P. Lovecraft. The narrator of the story experiences a series of increasingly substantial dreams about Olathoë, a city of marble lying on a plateau between two peaks, with the \"malign presence\" of Polaris ever watching in the night sky. At the end of the story, he is convinced that his waking life is not real but a dream from which he cannot awaken. (light)\n\nMary Poppins (1934), novel by P. L. Travers. One of Mary Poppins' unusual acquaintances, a personified Maia, arrives in London to do some Christmas shopping for the \"other stars in the Pleiades.\" One of 12 Mary Shepard illustrations in the book depicts Maia as a young girl in a diaphanous shift, clutching a parcel of purchases, and mounting an invisible staircase back to her place in the heavens.[13] (meta)\n\nJustine (1957), Alexandria Quartet novel by Lawrence Durrell. The fourth paragraph of this first novel in the quartet describes the effect of Arcturus, the brightest star in the northern sky, on the narrator's somber ruminations: I have had to come so far away from it in order to understand it all! Living on this bare promontory, snatched every night from darkness by Arcturus, far from the lime-laden dust of those summer afternoons, I see at last that none of us is properly to be judged for what happened in the past. It is the city which should be judged though we, its children, must may the price.[14] (light)\n\nThe Truelove (1993), Aubrey-Maturin novel (titled Clarissa Oakes in the UK) written by Patrick O'Brian. Jack Aubrey establishes his ship's longitude in the Pacific Ocean without the aid of a marine chronometer by taking \"two beautiful lunar[ distance]s (angle readings), the one on Mars, the other on Fomalhaut.\"[15] (light)\n\n\"Dream — The Heart of a Star\" (2003), Chapter 3 of the graphic novel The Sandman: Endless Nights written by Neil Gaiman. Mizar appears as a female of blue flame. She is the host of an assembly of various cosmic entities, and the creator of the palace where they meet. (meta)\n\nMelancholia (2011), film written and directed by Lars von Trier. The planet Melancholia, a Counter-Earth long hidden behind the Sun, emerges from cover and appears headed for a close encounter with the Earth, the first evidence of its approach being its dramatic, symbolic occultation of the star Antares. Melancholia passes spectacularly and safely by in the sky, as predicted by astronomers, but then unexpectedly returns and collides with the Earth, bringing about an end to all life on the planet. As this cosmic catastrophe unfolds in the heavens, the film's progagonists huddle futilely in a crude shelter built of wooden sticks. (light)\n\nList of planetary systems in fiction\n\nPlanetary systems (mostly hypothetical or imaginary) of real stars appearing in fiction are:\n\n36 Ophiuchi\n\nDune (1965) and other novels in the Dune universe by Frank Herbert. 36 Ophiuchi B is orbited by the planet Giedi Prime, the homeworld of House Harkonnen.[16]\n\nFrontier: Elite II (1993) and Frontier: First Encounters (1995), computer games written by David Braben et al. 36 Ophiuchi is a mining system. The population of the system is centered around a moon in the system of 36 Ophiuchi C.\n\n40 Eridani\n\nDune (1965) and other novels in the Dune universe by Frank Herbert. \"Eridani A\" is orbited by the planet Richese (the fourth planet in orbit). Richese and Ix (qv) are \"supreme in machine culture\"; their devices are commonplace and considered essential throughout the Dune universe, though they sometimes test the limits of the anti-technology proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad.[16]\n\nStar Trek (1966- ), film and television franchise originated by Gene Roddenberry. 40 Eridani A is the home system of the planet Vulcan, origin of the Vulcan species. Although it is not explicitly stated in any TV show or film, both the authorized Star Trek book Star Trek: Star Charts[17] and Roddenberry himself[18] give this location. In addition, Commander Tucker's statement in Star Trek: Enterprise that Vulcan is 16 light years from Earth supports this location, as 40 Eridani A is 16.39 ly from the Sun.[19]\n\n2300 AD (1986), role-playing game designed by the Game Designers' Workshop. Montana (Spanish: Montaña) a habitable garden world, is the second planet of o2 Eridani (omicron two), and it houses the joint Argentinan-Mexican colony of Montana. While Argentina and Mexico originally placed two separate colonies within cooperating distance of each other, the distinctions have long since vanished. The Argentines first settled the continent of Chimborazo, while the Mexicans settled West Island, the largest of the three main islands of the planet. o2 Eridani is part of the Latin systems.\n\nSilicon Dreams trilogy (1986), interactive fiction games published by Firebird in the US and Rainbird in Europe. The first installment takes place within the system, as the colony ship Snowball 9 is on a collision course with one of the suns, possibly 40 Eridani A. The other two installments take place on the fictional planet Eden, also located in this star system.\n\n47 Ursae Majoris\n\nCoyote (2002), trilogy by Allen Steele. Much of the action of the series takes place on Coyote, a fictional habitable moon of 47 Ursae Majoris b, a planet given the name Bear. Altogether, Bear has six fictional satellites — Dog, Hawk, Eagle, Coyote, Snake and Goat — although only Coyote is habitable. 47 Ursae Majoris c is known as Wolf,and there are two fictional terrestrial planets, Fox and Raven, which orbit inward from Bear and Wolf.\n\n61 Cygni\n\nFoundation series (1951- ), novels by Isaac Asimov. The star system 61 Cygni, in the Sirius Sector, is advanced by Lord Dorwin as a potential site for the planet of origin of the human species.\n\nTime and Again (1951), novel by Clifford D. Simak. 61 Cygni is a mysterious system whose planets are impossible to approach.\n\nMission of Gravity (1953), novel by Hal Clement. The binary 61 Cygni star system is home to the supermassive planet Mesklin, which rotates rapidly and is highly oblate, with a gravity of 3 g at the equator and 700 g at the poles. A human explorer lands at the equator and engages a crew of the intelligent, centipede-like Mesklinites to retrieve a vital component from a space probe that has crashed at one of the poles. Although the 61 Cygni binary is known to be the home system of Mesklin,[20] and is often seen in the sky, it is never actually named in the book: 61 Cygni A is always called simply \"the sun,\" while 61 Cygni B, fainter by a full apparent magnitude, bears the Mesklinite name Esstes.[21] In the same magazine article where he identified 61 Cygni, Clement described the painstaking physics that went into the creation of his tale. The result is an intriguingly plausible world, inhabited by his most interesting aliens; the book is consistently rated as one of the best-loved novels of science fiction, due as much to the admirable qualities of the Mesklinite Captain Barlennan as to the inherent fascination of the hard-science challenges posed by the planet and overcome by him and his crew.[22]\n\nDanny Dunn and the Voice from Space (1967), children's book written by Raymond Abrashkin and Jay Williams. A modulated radio signal coming from 61 Cygni turns out to be an encoded pictogram sent by extraterrestrials.\n\nStar Fleet Technical Manual (1975), fiction reference book by Franz Joseph Schnaubelt. The technical manual depicts the flag and seal of the \"United Planets of 61 Cygni,\" which is identified by secondary Star Trek materials as the location of Tellar, home of the Tellarite species.\n\nTricentennial (1977), Hugo award-winning short story by Joe Haldeman. Radio message from 61 Cygni compels scientists to head for the star system on board the Daedalus, a nuclear fusion-propelled spaceship. See also: Project Daedalus, a British study of interstellar spacecraft design.\n\nTraveller (1977- ), suite of role-playing games designed by the Game Designers' Workshop. 61 Cygni is the home star of Nusku, a major colony world of strategic importance during the interstellar wars of the 22nd century.\n\nBlake's 7 (1978- ), television program created by Terry Nation. The region around 61 Cygni, known as the Darkling Zone, is the only volume of space near Earth that has never been surveyed, since it is home to an alien race which is hostile to mankind and has even released a virus at a Terran Federation base, using a piece of space debris as a vector.\n\nDownbelow Station (1981) and other Alliance-Union universe works, novels by C.J. Cherryh. 61 Cygni is the site of Bryant's Star Station, one of the stations on the \"Great Circle\" chain of space stations that terminates at Pell Station in the Tau Ceti system.\n\nPortal (1986), interactive novel by Brad Fregger. In this novel the player, assuming the role of the unnamed astronaut protagonist, returns from a failed 100 year voyage to 61 Cygni to find the Earth devoid of humans.\n\nFrontier: Elite II (1993) and Frontier: First Encounters (1995), computer games written by David Braben et al. The terraformed Cygnan planet Scott is notorious for its harsh, icy environment. Nonetheless, its sustaining planetwide fishing industry is well supplemented by a thriving ecotourism industry — visitors from nearby mining systems would never otherwise experience an outdoor environment. 61 Cygni is a member of the Federation.\n\nRevelation Space universe (2000- ), novels and stories by Alastair Reynolds. 61 Cygni is the home star of the planet Sky's Edge, an earthlike planet in a perpetual state of war between settler families.\n\nEarth & Beyond (2002), online role-playing game published by Electronic Arts. 61 Cygni is a system in the outskirts of the game universe.\n\n61 Ursae Majoris\n\nThe Warriors (1966), Known Space short story by Larry Niven published in the collection The Shape of Space (1969). 61 Ursae Majoris is the star system of the planet Kzin, homeworld of the Kzinti (singular Kzin), a warlike and bloodthirsty race of cat-like aliens in Niven's Known Space series.[23]\n\nStar Trek (1966- ), film and television franchise originated by Gene Roddenberry. 61 Ursae Majoris is orbited by the class M planet Archer IV.\n\n2300 AD (1986), role-playing game designed by the Game Designers' Workshop. Home system of Joi, a habitable garden world that has four ethnic colonies (Azanian, British, German, and Japanese), as well as the free neation of Elysia, a former French colony.\n\nMass Effect (2007), videogame published by Microsoft Game Studios. Birth system of the character of Gunnery Chief Ashley Williams.\n\n70 Ophiuchi\n\nDune (1965) and other novels in the Dune universe by Frank Herbert. Sikun is the third planet from 70 Ophiuchi.\n\n\"Miri\" (1966), episode of Star Trek: The Original Series written by Adrian Spies, as part of the film and television franchise originated by Gene Roddenberry. In the James Blish treatment of this episode, the events take place on a planet in the 70 Ophiuchi star system. This planet is an exact duplicate of the Earth in every detail.\n\nStarforce: Alpha Centauri (1974), science fiction board game published by Simulation Publications based on a concept by Redmond Simonsen. In this game as well as in the spin-off game StarSoldier, 70 Ophiuchi is the home of the Rame, an advanced, space-faring race.\n\nThe Ophiuchi Hotline (1977), novel by John Varley. Humanity survives with the aid of a technology derived from information in the Ophiuchi Hotline, a radio signal apparently beamed from the star 70 Ophiuchi.\n\nFrontier: Elite II (1993) and Frontier: First Encounters (1995), computer games written by David Braben et al. The 70 Ophiuchi system has an economy based on mining and heavy industry, which makes its population (in the hundreds of thousands) uncharacteristically large.\n\nRise: The Vieneo Province (2006- ), online virtual world developed and published by Unistellar Industries. This MMORPG takes place on a moon of the 70 Ophiuchi system.\n\n82 Eridani\n\nOrbit Unlimited (1961), fix-up novel by Poul Anderson. The novel recounts the colonisation of the planet Rustum, a fictional terrestrial world orbiting 82 Eridani, by a group of refugees from an authoritarian planet Earth. Although habitable, Rustum's atmospheric pressure is so great that only its mountains and high plateaus are suitable for human settlement. There is confusion about the distinction between 82 Eridani and Epsilon Eridani, which is addressed in the \"Science background\" section of the Orbit Unlimited article.\n\nEnigma (1986), second installment of the The Trigon Disunity series of novels by Michael P. Kube-McDowell. The 82 Eridani system is home to a small, primitive human colony called Muschynka.\n\nArk (2009), novel by Stephen Baxter. 82 Eridani is the home sun of an earthlike planet, Earth II, whose significant axial tilt and eccentric orbit produce seasonal variations extreme enough to discourage colonization.\n\n94 Aquarii\n\n\"Unexpected\" (2001), episode of Star Trek: Enterprise written by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, as part of the film and television franchise originated by Gene Roddenberry. The episode makes reference to the Fellebian civilization. The fictional reference book Star Trek Star Charts (2002) depicts 94 Aquarii as a trinary star with two class G components and a class K component. The trinary is orbited by the planet Fellebia.\n\n107 Piscium\n\nAbsolution Gap (2003), novel by Alastair Reynolds. 107 Piscium is orbited by the gas giant Haldora which is in turn orbited by the habitable moon Hela, colonized in the 27th century.\n\nAcamar (Theta Eridani)\n\nThe Wounded Sky (1983), Star Trek novel by Diane Duane, as part of the film and television franchise originated by Gene Roddenberry. The Enterprise sets a course for Acamar before it is overtaken by several Klingon battle-cruisers.\n\n\"The Vengeance Factor\" (1989), episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation written by Sam Rolfe, as part of the film and television franchise originated by Gene Roddenberry.

As Dune it is the eponymous planet of the franchise.[16] Arrakis, with its giant sandworms, its Bedouin-like human inhabitants (the Fremen) clinging to the most precarious of ecological niches through fanatical scrupulousness in water conservation, and its overall concern with ecological themes, is possibly the most convincing planetary romance environment created by any science fiction author.[44] Herbert may have been influenced in his choice of Canopus as Arrakis' primary by one of the common etymologial derivations of the star’s name, as a Latinization (through Greek Kanobos) from the Coptic Kahi Nub (\"Golden Earth\"), which refers to how Canopus would have appeared over the southern desert horizon in ancient Egypt, reddened by atmospheric absorption.[45]\n\n\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" (1966), episode of Star Trek: The Original Series written by Samuel A. Peeples, as part of the film and television franchise originated by Gene Roddenberry.

The time travelers are transported to a planet orbiting Canopus to rescue Dr. Ann MacGregor, whose abductor left behind a metallic computer card providing the coordinates. In the episode, the distance from the Earth to Canopus is given as 98 light-years, a value within the broad range of distances considered possible by astronomers in 1967. With data provided by the Hipparcos satellite telescope (1989–1993) this distance is now known to be 310 light-years.\n\n\"The Ultimate Computer\" (1968), episode of Star Trek: The Original Series written by D.

While exploring, the crew meets the Lactrans, a group of twenty foot slugs with intellectual capacities far beyond their own. The team is captured by the Lactrans to be made part of a zoo collection.\n\nShikasta (1979), first novel in the Canopus in Argos series by literature Nobelist Doris Lessing. The series fictionally reinterprets the past history of the planet Shikasta (Earth) as playing out under the influence of three galactic empires: Canopus, Sirius, and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. The novel Shikasta is presented in the form of a series of reports by Canopean emissaries to Shikasta — but at a deeper level, it is a record of their struggle to come to terms with human sexuality, politics, and mortality, all through the lens of Sufi mysticism.[46]\n\nBattleTech (1984), wargame and related products launched by The FASA Corporation. The Magistracy of Canopus is an interstellar nation in the fictional setting of BattleTech.

Canopus has colonies dedicated to mining, including two dwarf planets that share the name Camp Lawrence.\n\nCapella (Alpha Aurigae)\n\nThe Exiles of Capella (1949), spiritualist Portuguese language novel (Os Exilados da Capela) by the Brazilian author Edgard Armond. In this novel, some of the natives of a Capellan planet are reborn in a pre-historical age on Earth due to their own misfortune and moral fall, and they help primitive humans' evolution. In the book, these fallen spirits are also responsible for the rise of early real or mythical human civilizations, such as those of Egypt, China, India and even Atlantis.\n\nLone Star Planet (1958), novel by H. Beam Piper. The planet of New Texas is Capella IV. The tongue-in-cheek tale, based on a satirical 1924 essay by H. L. Mencken,[47] features a planet of Texans whose dinosaur-sized cattle have to be herded with tanks, and where assault or murder upon government employees is considered altogether justifiable.\n\nStarship Troopers (1959), novel by Robert A. Heinlein. The troop transport Tours is one big ship. She has the speed and the lift to deliver a double load of starship troopers to just about anywhere in fighting trim: \"Under Cherenkov drive she cranks Mike 400 or better — say Sol to Capella, forty-six light-years, in under six weeks.\"[48] From the numbers given by Heinlein it is evident that Mike 1 is intended to be equal to the speed of light[49] — just as Mach 1 equals the speed of sound in the atmosphere of the Earth.\n\n\"Friday's Child\" (1967), episode of Star Trek: The Original Series written by D.C.

Making his way to the glittering white city Daille, he learns that his late father's carved screen REMEMBER ME is treasured as a priceless artifact in the Museum of Glory. The sky of Maastricht is a rich, soft blue with the sun, Capella, surrounded by a zone of pale glimmer.[51] Vance draws Maastricht, its landscape, and its people with an exotic palette and flashing actinic brightness: he is an influential creator of imaginary worlds. \"The first full-fleged modern planetary romance is therefore probably Jack Vance's ... [he] supplied sf writers with a model to exploit.\" Vancian worlds provide a rich environment together with off-world protagonists (In the case of Maastricht: Ghyl Tarvoke) whose need to travel across the planet provides a quest plot and a rationale for the lessons in anthropology and sociology so common to the form.[6] Emphyrio is one of three novels showing Jack Vance's planet-building talents at their fullest stretch.[52]\n\nThe Listeners (1972), novel by James Gunn. The novel revolves around a radio message received from Capella.\n\nTime's Last Gift (1972), Tarzan novel by Philip José Farmer.

They say the men of Fomalhaut have to learn practically a new language to be understood at the Emperor's court on Trantor.\"[58] Pebble was Asimov's first published novel, set early in the galactic empire of the Foundation stories but having little connection with them; it is considered a slight effort.

The main characters belong to one of two major groups: the Tevarans, a tribe of humanoid extraterrestrials indigenous to the planet, and a dwindling colony of Earth humans who detest them, marooned on the planet in their stone city Landin.[64] Alterra's prodigously extended seasons afford Le Guin ample scope to pursue her favorite narrative theme: a man is set in an alien world; he must pursue a frozen winter quest until he makes a conceptual breakthrough; he then becomes an agent of reconciliation between former antagonists.[65]\n\nThe Last Castle (1966), novella by Jack Vance.

Delany. Bellatrix is the star system of the Alliance War Yards at Armsedge, where Rydra Wong witnesses a berserker attack by an Invader agent controlled by the weapon/language Babel-17.[67] The author's vividly kaleidoscopic descriptions of Armsedge, and the fateful banquet set-piece where the assassin runs amok, are instances of recurring themes in Delany's work: the quest (in this case, to decode and disarm Babel-17), a damaged protagonist (Wong), and an economical use of colorful detail to flesh out the social background of his stories (the remarkable Armsedge itself).[68] Presumably the planet's name \"Armsedge\" derives from Bellatrix' (Gamma Orionis') situation at the outer edge of the Orion arm of the Milky Way galaxy, with an additional war-yard play on the word arms.\n\nBlade Runner (1982), film written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples and directed by Ridley Scott, loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. Betelgeuse is the right shoulder, and Bellatrix is the left shoulder of the constellation Orion.

Groombridge 34 is a possible location of the fictitious \"Groombridge 1816\" (Helios) system, stated to be 11.7 light-years[69] from the Solar System, about the same as the actual distance to Groombridge 34 (11.62 ly). The planet Eden in the fictional 1816 system is the location of the New Edwards Test Flight Center[70] and its major metropolis, Eden City. The name Groombridge 1816 may be an alteration of the name of the actual although unrelated star Groombridge 1618 (see next entry).\n\n\"Pilot, Part 1\" and \"Mutiny\" (1995), first and fourth episodes of Space: Above and Beyond, a television series created by Glen Morgan and James Wong.

This novel extrapolates the theory[73][74] propounded by Duncan Lunan in 1973 that there was a space probe orbiting around the Moon, sent there by inhabitants of a planet in the Epsilon Boötis system.\n\nKapteyn's Star\n\nFrontier: Elite II (1993) and Frontier: First Encounters (1995), computer games written by David Braben et al. The Kapteyn's planetary system can be visited in the Frontier series, but it is uninhabited.\n\nFallen Gods (2003), novella written by Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman based on the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Kapteyn's Star is the sun of a planetary system whose planets are home to several dozen sentient species occupying a variety of terrestrial and aquatic ecological niches. This richness enables the intelligent and complex plotting that is a hallmark of the children's series, as well as its many spin-off novellas, novels, encyclopedias, annuals and even scholarly articles.[75]\n\nKruger 60\n\nDownbelow Station (1981) and other Alliance-Union universe works, novels by C.J. Cherryh. Kruger 60 is the site of Venture Station, one of the stations on the \"Great Circle\" chain of space stations that terminates at Pell Station in the Tau Ceti system.\n\nLacaille 9352\n\nRevelation Space universe (2000- ), novels and stories by Alastair Reynolds. Lacaille 9352 is the sun the planet Fand, home of the Fand \"screech mat.\"\n\nLalande 21185\n\nLalande 21185 is a red dwarf of apparent magnitude 7 and is thus too dim to be seen with the unaided eye. However, at approximately 8.3 light-years away it is the fourth closest stellar system to the Sun; only the Alpha Centauri system, Barnard's Star and Wolf 359 are known to be closer. For this reason the star has attracted the attention of science fiction authors and game developers.\n\nRogue Queen (1951), novel by L. Sprague de Camp. On the planet of the star Lalande 21185 known to Terrans as Ormazd, the dominant humanoid species is organized into hive societies much like those of Earth's ants and bees. These societies are inadvertently but inevitably undermined and transformed by contact with Terrans.\n\nLalande 21185 (1966), Polish language novel by Janusz Zajdel. Zajdel's dystopian themes of totalitarian states and collapsed societies are explored in the Lalande 21185 system.\n\nStar Light (1971), novel by Hal Clement. The story takes place on the supergiant planet Dhrawn, which some suspect of being a failed star, in orbit around Lalande 21185. The gravity at the surface is 40 times the Earth's, and a Dhrawn day lasts 1500 Earth hours. A consortium of spacefaring races, including humans, recruits Mesklinites, the centipede-like natives of the high-gravity planet Mesklin (see 61 Cygni: Mission of Gravity above), to explore Dhrawn.[76]\n\nAcross the Sea of Suns (1984), novel in the Galactic Center Saga by Gregory Benford. Radio astronomy on the Moon in 2021 reveals the presence of life in the system of nearby red dwarf star Lalande 21185, on the tidally locked planet Isis. An expedition is dispatched which discovers a primitive race of alien nomads broadcasting en-masse with organs adapted to emit and receive electromagnetic radiation. The biotic basis of the transmissions is emblematic of Benford's vision in his \"water-themed\" novels of a Universe-wide struggle between organic lifeforms and self-replicating machines.[77]\n\nMarooned in Realtime (1986), novel by Vernor Vinge. A character has returned from an expedition to Lalande 21185, referred to in the novel as \"Gatewood's Star\" after astronomer George G. Gatewood, a pioneer in the search for extrasolar planets by astrometry who in 1996 claimed to have detected planets orbiting Lalande 21185.\n\nTimemaster (1992), novel by Robert L. Forward. Three astronauts make the slow sub-lightspeed trip to Lalande 21185 between 2043 and 2052 with the intention of establishing a wormhole terminus, enabling instantaneous travel to and from the Earth.\n\nFrontier: Elite II (1993) and Frontier: First Encounters (1995), computer games written by David Braben et al. Lalande 21185 is dedicated to heavy industry. With a colony on the innermost planet of the system and a space station orbiting the planet, this industry-based system is more developed than most others in the games.\n\nCivilization II: Test of Time (1999), strategy game developed by MicroProse and published by Hasbro Interactive. Humans and an alien species both crashland on the earthlike second planet of Lalande 21185, Funestis. The object of play is to get back to Earth. Other planets in this system include rocky Naumachia and the gas giant Nona.\n\nRevelation Space universe (2000- ), novels and stories by Alastair Reynolds.

Lalande 21185 is an important crossroads, and features the minor planet Diva.\n\nStar Corps (2006), first novel in the Legacy Trilogy by Ian Douglas. The gas giant plant Marduk in orbit around Lalande 21185 has the earthlike moon Ishtar, where the alien race of Froggers holds humans in slavery, resulting in a force of US Marines being sent in 2148 to free them.\n\nLalande 46650\n\nCyteen (1988) and Regenesis (2009), novels in the Alliance-Union universe by C.J. Cherryh. Lalande 46650 is the star system containing the planet Cyteen as well as a space station with the same name. Cyteen is the home planet of the ruthless, expansionist Union, and Cherryh limns its intricacies with plays on genetics, identity, family, and power. These novels go against type for her in that they are planet-centric rather than being set in artificial environments in space. They can also be seen to represent a shift from themes of honor (typical of preliterate \"shame\" cultures) to the responsibility of power (a problem central to literate \"guilt\" cultures).[78]\n\nLambda Scorpii (Shaula)\n\nThe Transformers (2005- ), comic book series written by Simon Furman et al for IDW Publishing. Cybertron is the homeworld of the Transformers in the various fictional incarnations of the Transformer metaseries (Marvel, Dreamwave, IDW).

Just before a worldwide ecological catastrophe devastates the Earth, space explorers discover that Lambda Serpentis II is a habitable ocean planet; they give it the name Poseidon. One major colony ship is sent before civilization collapses on Earth.\n\nHalo (2001- ), video game franchise created by Bungie and published by Microsoft Game Studios. The Lambda Serpentis system is home to the human colony planet Jericho VII.[79][80]\n\n\"Acquisition\" (2002), episode of Star Trek: Enterprise written by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, as part of the film and television franchise originated by Gene Roddenberry. The episode makes reference to the planet Stameris. The fictional reference book Star Trek Star Charts (2002) depicts Lambda Serpentis as a binary star with two class G components, and identifies it as the location of Stameris.[17]\n\nMaia (20 Tauri)\n\nOperation Bororo (1973), Czechoslovak science fiction film written by I. Drahnovská et al and directed by Otakar Fuka. A man and a woman (Ori-Ana) from a planet orbiting Maia come to the Earth to get a cure for a disease that threatens to eradicate their civilization, a drug made only by the Amazonian Bororo people.\n\nMarkab / Markeb (Kappa Velorum)\n\nTékumel (~1940- ), novels and games by Professor Muhammad Barker. Markeb is the home sun of the Hokún, or Glass Monsters.\n\nBabylon 5 (1993–1998), television series developed and written by J. Michael Straczynski. The Markab species from this star became largely extinct in 2259 due to the Drafa Plague. They were members of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds. There may still be some isolated colonies or outposts, but for all intents and purposes the Markab are a dead race.\n\nMintaka (Delta Orionis)\n\nCluster (1977–1982), series of novels written by Piers Anthony. Mintaka, like the Earth (\"Sol\") is the center of a galactic sphere of influence. Melody of Mintaka, a direct descendant of Flint of Outworld and his Andromedan nemesis, is a major character in the second and third books of the series.\n\n\"Who Watches the Watchers\" (1989), episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation written by Richard Manning and Hans Beimler, as part of the film and television franchise originated by Gene Roddenberry. Mintaka III is inhabited by the Mintakans, a preindustrial Vulcan-like race that is under observation by the Federation. After the events in this episode, a tapestry given by them to Captain Jean-Luc Picard would be seen adorning the chair in his office or quarters.\n\n\"Durka Returns\" (1999), episode 15 of the television series Farscape. Mintaka III is home to the Nebari, a race that sees violence and nonconformity as unacceptable traits that should be involuntarily excised. In the episode, a collision with a Nebari ship brings a Nebari \"criminal\" named Chiana to the Leviathan ship Moya.\n\nBaten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean (2003), video game developed by tri-Crescendo and Monolith Soft and published by Namco. Mintaka is the capital of the Alfard Empire.\n\nBaten Kaitos Origins (2006), video game developed by tri-Crescendo and Monolith Soft and published by Nintendo. Mintaka is the capital of the Alfard Empire.\n\nMira (Omicron Ceti)\n\nMira, a variable star, would actually be a poor candidate for the home sun of any of the \"habitable\" planets described below, since its brightness fluctuates over the long run by a total factor of around 1700, with each individual cycle lasting about 300 days.\n\nThe War against the Rull (1959), fixup assembled by A. E. van Vogt. Protagonist Trevor Jamieson, chief scientist of the Interstellar Military Commission (!), is hypnotized when he glances at an intricate Rull pattern coded in fine lines. Upon awakening, he finds that Rull agents have transported him to Mira XXIII, a ravenous jungle world home to the dreaded progeny of the lymph beast. A beast-assisted assassination attempt on him follows (he escapes).[81] The abrupt twist that places Jamieson on Mira XXIII is a dreamily disjointed non sequitur typical of van Vogt's plotting style; the astonishingly savage jungle in which the protagonist finds himself is a favored planetary setting of the author, and the second jungle world encountered in the novel (the first, Eristan II, orbits a fictional star). The episode is drawn in crude, dark colors and with occasionally awkward prose, but its ferocious sense of wonder is conveyed with a hallucinatory conviction.[82]\n\n\"A Relic of the Empire\" (1966), Known Space short story by Larry Niven published in the collection Neutron Star (1968).
