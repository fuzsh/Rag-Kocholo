A source said: \"Miranda was also at Ralf's earlier in the week. They have become very close recently and spend time at his local pub with his mates.\"\n\nMiranda first met Ralf earlier this year when they were filming ITV1 comedy drama Married, Single, Other, to be screened early next year.\n\nBut pals say their friendship has blossomed recently.\n\nMiranda met Raza, 34, on the Spooks set in 2005.\n\nShe married the actor, who played undercover operative Zafar Younis, in 2007 at Aldeburgh, Suffolk, near her childhood home. But cracks appeared in the relationship after Raza quit the show two years ago.\n\nRalf dated TV presenter Lisa Rogers in 2001.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nCLOSE: Ralf & Miranda 11.25AM Relaxed Ralf leaves house 11.15AM Smiling Miranda yesterday 11.48 PM Miranda with duvet as she arrives at Ralf's place Picture: JON BUSHELL/ MATRIXPHOTOS.COM"
