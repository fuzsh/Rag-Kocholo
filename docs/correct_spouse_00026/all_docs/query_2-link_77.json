        "text": "So… I decided that, due to a combination of boredom and a large number of pictures taking up space on my hard drive, that I’d do a picspam/ meme thingy. As shown below.\n\nRules:\n\n- Name your top 20 list of lust (celebrities, fictional characters, real people).\n\n- Include pictures if you can.\n\nSo here goes. I must admit, it was pretty difficult to pick, and my criteria seemed to change like a zillion times throughout. Some people are here due to the fact that they are insanely pretty, others because their personality/characters make them gorgeous, or because they are simply incredible actors. But all I adore. And that’s all that matters, right?\n\nCaution: this is NOT dial-up friendly. Not at all.\n\nAnd? I had to make it 21. Sorry.\n\n21. Raza Jefferey (Spooks)\n\nAh… to start us off, it’s the man that makes me squeal such eloquent phrases as “OMG! It’s Hot!Zaf!” every time I see him. As you can probably judge by now, I find him Quite Attractive. He’s married to Miranda Raison, and my god, they make a gorgeous couple! But yes, back to my point… He’s lovely. Just lovely.\n\n20. James May/Captain Slow (Top Gear)\n\nThere’s something about James May I find quite adorable. It might be something to do with his lack of dress sense, or constant need for a haircut, or the fact that he’s says words like vulgar and generally acts as if he belongs in a timeline different to everyone else.. Whatever it is, it’s brilliant. He’s awkward and self-conscious, and really, just another part of the wonderful Top Gear team.\n\n19. Robert Sean Leonard (House)\n\nThis probably developed during my obsession with House (that promptly ended around season 3- but that’s a whole new topic in itself), and has just stuck. There’s just something about him that’s rather wonderful. It helps that Wilson continues to be one of the only characters I actually still like on House. And still manages to be sexy in the process.\n\n18. Dylan Moran (Black Books)\n\nNot hugely attractive (not too bad, mind), he’s here because he is… how do I say this? Freaking hilarious! Doing stand up, he’s just wonderful. There’s something strangely sexy about him, too, The man smokes like a chimney, drinks non-stop, is in a state of permanent dishevelment, yet still sexy. Impressive, wouldn’t you say?\n\n17. John Simm (Life On Mars, Doctor Who)\n\nOne of my celebrity major crushes, I just fell in love with him when obsessing about watching Life On Mars. Not only is he damn good-looking, but he’s also a very talented actor. He played Sam beautifully- he was just awesomely convincing in the role (one reason why I can’t stomach the American LOM- no way does their Sam match up!) but really people… Isn’t that smile reason enough?\n\n16. Yvonne Strahovski (Chuck)\n\nI hate her. No, really. Absolutely despise her. I mean, who gave her the right to be so utterly adorable and gorgeous all the time? It’s not fair to the rest of us. I love Sarah as well- she’s a good, strong female lead, with awesome kung-fu abilities and a HOT fascinating relationship with Chuck.\n\n15. Billie Piper (Doctor Who)\n\nAs mush as my sister had tried to convince me otherwise, I cannot stand her music. But everything else? Awesome! her portrayal of Rose is just lovely, and I seriously cannot understand how anyone could hate her. She’s a brilliant crier (the kind that always ends up making you cry as well), and although sometimes a little off, she’s usually a pretty good actress. Plus? She’s gorgeous. And that’s what this is all about.\n\n14. Richard “Hamster” Hammond (Top Gear)\n\nGod I love this Top Gear team. Take Richard Hammond. He’s short, and is constantly teased about it. He’s got very white teeth and is constantly teased about them. But the beauty of it all is that he gets his own back. Hammond’s not (usually) afraid to give as good as he gets, or to challenge one of Jeremy’s more ridiculous arguments. He can be very, very funny, and, to top it off, he’s pretty good-looking, a hair disaster or two aside. A true character, and I just love him.\n\n13. Simon Pegg + Nick Frost (Shaun Of The Dead, Hot Fuzz)\n\nShaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz. Reason enough to love these two? I mean, those are my two favourite movies ever. They are just indescribably clever. My sister and I have watched both over 10 times, and each time, we notice new things that just make the whole thing even funnier. Seriously, if you haven’t watched these movies yet, what are you waiting for? Individually, both are also awesome- Simon in Run Fat Boy Run and Spaced, and Nick in Hyperdrive, but together, they are just incredible. And while not particularly attractive, their sheer brilliance outshines everything.\n\n12. Catherine Tate (Doctor Who, Catherine Tate Show)\n\nAn admission first: when I first heard Catherine Tate was joining in season 4 of Doctor Who as a permanent companion, I was very disappointed. Maybe even annoyed. The first time I watched Runaway Bride, I was not impressed: Donna was loud and screechy and I wanted my Rose back! But then I watched it again. And again. Each time, I liked her more, and I slowly became excited about season 4. I wasn’t disappointed. Catherine Tate’s acting as Donna is just first-class. Donna is my favourite character in Doctor Who, even over Rose and The Doctor himself. And her abilities don’t end there: I normally hate sketch shows, but The Catherine Tate Show can be hilarious. You disagree? I ain’t boverred!\n\n11. Rob Lowe (Brothers & Sisters)\n\nSo… A largely shallow choice here. He’s just really handsome, in the traditional, square-jawed kind of way I normally don’t go for. I also really like the character of Robert, who happens to do one of my favourite things: rolls his shirt-sleeves up to the elbow. Like I said… SHALLOW!\n\n10. Jeremy Clarkson (Top Gear)\n\nWhat can I say about Jeremy Clarkson that hasn’t already been said? He’s cruel, argumentative to a fault, is often completely illogical when voicing his opinions, always has to be right. And I love him for it all. He just makes Top Gear for me: without him goading Hammond about being short and Captain Slow being, well… slow, without his constant cry for “POWER!!!” or his insanely witty one liners, without him falling in love with inappropriate guest stars (*cough* Will Young *cough*), where would it be? He is, quite possibly, the best car show presenter……………………………………………………………. in the world!\n\n9. Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks, Persuasion)\n\nThis is an interesting one, because, to be brutally honest, I really dislike the character he portrays in Spooks sometimes. He can be such an absolute wanker. But alas, RPJ is still insanely gorgeous, which is probably what keeps me from out-and-out hating him (I did warn about shallowness!). He is also a pretty good actor, and quite lovely as Wentworth (see Persuasion), but honestly… he’s just hot.\n\n8. Jennifer Morrison (House)\n\nAh… JMo. You continue to be awesome. Really, her portrayal of Cameron is the only reason I ever bother to watch House these days. She just gives Cameron such an amazing level of complexity. She’s got amazing chemistry with Hugh Laurie- each look is just loaded with so much. She’s quite lovely off-screen too, always humble, always excited about being part of the show. Also, can I just say… her looks make me so jealous. Her hair is just beautiful, no matter how it’s styled, and I really wish mine looked even slightly as good as hers.\n\nWe can but dream.\n\n7. Hugh Laurie (House, Fry & Laurie)\n\nI really don’t know what it is, but there’s something I find endlessly sexy about Hugh Laurie. Is it the unbelievably striking blue eyes? Or the insanely endearing awkwardness and generally self-effacing manner? Sure, he’s more than twice my age, but I can’t help it: he’s just hot. Also, he is quite the actor: which other actor could pull of the character of House so well, let alone having to put on an American accent all the time? Even though I’m not that keen on the show anymore, you can’t, in any way, fault his performance. Plus, he’s best friends with Stephen Fry (!!!) and Robert Sean Leonard. And, as evidenced by the clip below, is very, very funny.\n\n6. Michael Vartan (Alias, Rogue)\n\nMy first ever true love! God, he was just so lovely in Alias. For the first season and a half, Vaughn is the type of male character I usually hate: the one that angsts over the girl he can’t have. But he made Vaughn so utterly adorable, it was impossible to hate him. Really, I want Michael Vartan to be my boyfriend. And why not? He loves Australia, so he can come move in with me, he loves labradors (so do I) and has one of his own (so do I). Perfect match!\n\n5. Jenna Fischer & Angela Kinsey (The Office)\n\nWhat can I say? They are just so cute!!! They are basically enemies in the show, but pretty much the best of friends in real life. I mean, the whole cast of The Office is so tight knit it’s not even funny: they just all genuinely get on so incredibly well! And Jenna and Angela are no exception. I love how wide-eyed they are. There’s nothing pompous or big-headed about either of them. I think this video speaks for itself.\n\n4. Robson Green (Wire in the Blood)\n\nHe’s a mix of everything: he’s rather sexy, I love the character he portrays, and he’s an incredible actor. He’s quite often enthralling as Tony, and the intensity just adds to his sex appeal. He also plays the dorky, vague side to perfection. The way Robson plays Tony, all the mannerisms and the speech patterns, just add so much depth to his character. Has there been a better partnership of than Robson Green and Hermione Norris? I mean, the combined acting ability is just astonishing. Must also give him major credit for his role in the Ultimate OTP of Tony/Carol- the chemistry he has with Hermione is just mind-blowing.\n\nDid I mention I like forearms? Well I do. And his are nice. So there.\n\n3. Richard Armitage (Spooks, North & South)\n\nHere, I lay down a challenge for you: if you’ve seen him before in things and have not been impressed, watch North & South. Right now. If you’re still not convinced of how sexy he is after that, I’ll give you a million dollars. And recommend you see an optometrist to get your eyes tested. The man is simply gorgeous. I was thrilled when I heard he was joining Spooks, and he didn’t disappoint: Lucas is wonderful.\n\nAlso, Richard Armitage and Hermione Norris filming Spooks together in Russia? BEST. IDEA. EVER. They muck around with silly hats! She has to do his make-up because they have such a small crew!\n\n2. David Tennant (Doctor Who)\n\nAh David Tennant… Really, I have my sister to blame for this. She spent months going on about this “Doctor Who” and how hot talented the lead actor was, and I eventually gave in and watched an episode. And immediately got hooked. Really, Ten is just such an amazingly layered and complex character, and David is just unbelievably good in the role. I mean, he has the ability to just make you feel everything he does. When he cries, I cry, when he grins, I grin.\n\nDid I mention that he hangs out with fellow awesome people? Or that him and Billie Piper make the most adorable pair in the world?\n\n1. Hermione Norris (Wire in the Blood, Spooks, Cold Feet, Kingdom)\n\nSo here we are… My number 1. What can I say about Hermione? From the first time I ever saw her (Wire in the Blood), I adored her. She’s just amazing. Definitely my favourite actor ever. In whatever show she’s in, her character is always my favourite: Carol in WitB (my favourite character in anything- show wasn’t the same without her!), Ros in Spooks, Karen in Cold Feet… The list goes on. Even in The Kindness Of Strangers, where her character was evil, I still loved her. Her acting is quite often incredible. She often doesn’t even need dialogue to express emotion- she has this wonderful ability to convey everything through facial expressions and her eyes that surpasses anything I’ve seen before. Watching/reading interviews and behind the scenes videos, she just seems so wonderfully smart and funny and down to earth, and really, just gorgeous. Can she be my best friend? Please?"
