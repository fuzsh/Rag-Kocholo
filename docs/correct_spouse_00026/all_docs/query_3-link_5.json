He grew up in London, attended Dulwich College and later studied English and Drama at Manchester University with dreams of being a pilot.[2] Raza became interested in the acting business after playing in a rock band and performing in plays[2] at Manchester University.[3] He went on to study at The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and take post-graduate courses. After graduating, the actor began a long stint in the theater, appearing in such shows as Romeo and Juliet, Cyrano de Bergerac, East is East, and 14 Songs, 2 Weddings and a Funeral.
