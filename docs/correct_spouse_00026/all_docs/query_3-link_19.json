In 2014, he played Pakistani Lieutenant Colonel Aasar Khan in season 4 of the Showtime series Homeland.\n\nView the Raza Jaffrey Gallery.[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nJaffrey was born in Liverpool, Merseyside, the son of an Indian sea captain from Agra and an English mother from Liverpool. He grew up in London and was educated at Dulwich College (1986â€“1991), alongside fellow Spooks actor Rupert Penry-Jones. He studied English and Drama at Manchester University, and studied acting at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He intended to join the Royal Air Force as a pilot after leaving Manchester University.\n\nWhile at university, he appeared in a number of plays at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, including The London Vertigo by Brian Friel, and at the Pendley Open Air Shakespeare Festival, including Henry VIII and A Comedy of Errors. In his final year at Manchester, he worked with Royal Shakespeare Company chief associate director Gregory Doran, which he has cited as one of the things that led him to apply for Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and eventually go on to become a professional actor. Throughout his time at Manchester, he was also the lead singer of a jazz funk band. He also participated on America's Next Top Model.\n\nCareer[]\n\nJaffrey has worked extensively on stage, appearing in Romeo and Juliet (Haymarket Theatre), Cyrano De Bergerac (Theatre Royal), East Is East (Oldham Coliseum), and 14 Songs 2 Weddings and A Funeral (Lyric Hammersmith, Birmingham Repertory Theatre). His break came in 2001 when he was cast as Sky in Mamma Mia! at the Prince Edward Theatre, London, directed by Phyllida Lloyd. From this, he went on to land the leading role in Andrew Lloyd Webber's production of A. R. Rahman's Bombay Dreams at the Apollo Theatre, London, directed by Steven Pimlott. He won rave reviews for his performance, with the BBC hailing him as \"the most exciting new leading man to emerge in a London musical since Hugh Jackman became an overnight star in the National Theatre production of Oklahoma\".\n\nAfter leaving Bombay Dreams he appeared in ITV1's M.I.T.: Murder Investigation Team, the HBO/BBC co-production Dirty War, and the three part BBC drama Life Isn't All Ha Ha Hee Hee. In 2005, he began work on the BBC One spy drama series Spooks as agent Zafar Younis. During this time, he returned to the stage, playing Orsino in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night at the Albery Theatre, London, and was cast in the David Cronenberg film Eastern Promises.\n\nJaffrey left Spooks to join the BBC One drama series Mistresses and went on to star in Sharpe's Peril and the films Infinite Justice, for which he won the Best Supporting Actor Award at the Kara Film Festival, The Crew, and Harry Brown. In 2010, he appeared in Sex and the City 2 as Gaurav. He then went on to star as cheating boyfriend Mike in the BBC1 comedy Accidental Farmer.\n\nIn 2011, he appeared as the French supervillain Cain on the NBC superhero drama The Cape before working for NBC again on the Steven Spielberg produced drama Smash, airing in early 2012. In Smash, he played Dev, the English boyfriend of a rising Broadway star, working as a press officer in the New York Mayor's office. He did not return to the show for its second season.\n\nJaffrey still continues to sing and has performed in a number of concert productions, including singing at the London Palladium with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and with the BBC Concert Orchestra for BBC Radio 2. He was also the creator and co-producer of the dance show RED, a celebration of dozens of styles of movement and dance, brought together by their influences on and from India. He took the show to Johannesburg's Nelson Mandela Theatre. He played the role of Billy Flynn in Chicago at the Garrick Theatre in London.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nJaffrey married fellow Spooks actress Miranda Raison in September 2007, shortly after he left the show. They divorced in November 2009.\n\nIn late 2011, Jaffrey began dating another Spooks actress, Lara Pulver, and the two were married on 27 December 2014. The couple had a son in February 2017.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Title Type Role 1998 Picking up the Pieces TV Series Frank 1999 EastEnders TV Series Mr. Dattani 2002 Casualty TV Series Hakkan Tahsin 2002 Bombay Dreams Akaash 2004 Dirty War TV Movie Rashid Dhar 2004 - 2007 Spooks TV Series Zafar Younis 2005 M.I.T.: Murder Investigation Team TV Series Kareem Dobar 2005 Life Isn't All Ha Ha Hee Hee TV Series Krishan 2006 Infinite Justice Kamal Khan 2007 Sex, the City and Me TV Movie Shafi Amid 2007 Eastern Promises Doctor Aziz 2008 The Crew Keith Thompson 2008 Sharpe's Peril TV Movie Lance Naik Singh 2008 Daily Politics TV Series Guest Presenter 2008 - 2009 Mistresses TV Series Hari / Hari Dhillon 2009 Theatre Live!
