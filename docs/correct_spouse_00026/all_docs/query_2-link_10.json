        "text": "Miranda Caroline Raison was born on November 18, 1977, in Norfolk, England, into a proverbial Renaissance family: her father was a jazz pianist, her mother a newscaster, her uncle a politician, her grandfather a cricket player, and her great-uncle a British peer. Raison pursued a career in acting via tutelage at The Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. Upon graduation, she began collected small roles in projects like the Dutch movie \"Suzy Q\" (1999) and the British television show \"Perfect Strangers\" (BBC Two 2001). Soon enough, Raison nabbed roles of greater note. She costarred on the spy drama series \"Spooks\" (BBC One 2002-2011) between its fourth and eighth seasons. At the same time, Raison also began appearing in American films like Woody Allen's \"Match Point\" (2005) and the comedy film \"Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo\" (2005). In 2007, she married her \"Spooks\" costar Raza Jaffrey, but the couple divorced in 2009. Two years later, Raison appeared in a supporting role in the high-profile Marilyn Monroe biography feature \"My Week with Marilyn\" (2011), which she followed up with roles on high profile TV series like \"Vexed\" (BBC Two 2010-12), \"Silk\" (BBC One 2011-14), and the reboot \"24: Live Another Day\" (Fox 2014). All the while, Raison contributed to the renowned \"Thomas & Friends\" children's entertainment franchise, lending her voice to a number of short segments between 2013 and 2015. Next, Raison joined the cast of the crime dramedy series \"Spotless\" (Canal+ 2015-), playing a woman whose family life is undone following the reappearance of her troublesome estranged brother-in-law."
