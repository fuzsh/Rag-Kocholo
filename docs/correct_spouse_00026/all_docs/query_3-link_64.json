        "text": "SPOOKS star Miranda Raison admits it's been hard keeping the secret of her survival, especially when faced with fans out in the real world. \"Yes, ever since last December quite a few people have been asking, `Are you alive?' And, obviously, I'm back,\" she smiles.\n\nThe answer was provided when the hit spy drama returned last night, with Jo Portman alive, if not entirely well. At the end of the last series, MI5 officer Jo, played by Miranda, lay lifeless after begging colleague Adam (Rupert Penry-Jones) to kill her. Held hostage and raped by a group known as the Red Backs, she could not face further torture.\n\n\"I had some rather posh women in Chelsea say to me recently, `I'd have done exactly the same thing if that happened to me. I'd just say - kill me now'.\"\n\nBut as we now know, Adam did not do the deed. He told Jo to play dead and she got her revenge when the pair were rescued by special forces.\n\nTragic\n\nHowever, last night's opening story saw Adam killed in a huge blast, having driven a car bomb to a safe location to save others. His tragic death prompted Jo to return to work, explaining: \"It's the only way I have to pay my respects.\"\n\nSpooks (BBC1, 9pm) continues with Head of Counter-Terrorism Harry (Peter Firth) out for revenge against the Russian spymaster in London responsible for Adam's murder. And the nightmare is far from over for Jo. Aside from flashbacks to her ordeal, she faces another life or death situation in next Monday's third BBC1 episode, which can be seen on BBC3 at 11pm tonight.\n\n\"We filmed a big sequence in a market place and I enjoyed being the main artist for that day. You can really get into it and you feel important.\" Miranda says the scenes where Jo was held captive are among the most chilling she has ever played. But at the same time it gave her a chance to shine.\n\n\"When you get a script, we totally count our lines,\" she laughs, sitting in her dressing room on the Spooks set in London. \"There were rumours about the cliffhanger ending of the last series but it wasn't until I saw it all written down, that I thought, `That's going to be good'. But it was the toughest day of filming.\"\n\nAs fans mourn Adam's demise and Rupert's exit from the series, Richard Armitage has arrived as double agent Lucas North. He has to walk a dangerous tightrope between MI5 and the Russians.\n\n\"He's a hearthrob with this Armitage Army surrounding the set when we're out on location. But there's no ego on him whatsoever, which is extraordinary,\" says Miranda.\n\nThe Norfolk-born actress missed three weeks of filming last year after suffering a head injury. She tripped while filming an action scene and crashed into a metal door. \"I lost my nerve for a week or so after coming back from that but I'm very happy to run around.\n\nExtraordinary"
