        "text": "If your day job involved pretending to be an MI5 secret agent on a mission to save the world (well, London), you would probably expect to get to play with some of the world's most hi-tech gadgets: tracking devices, secret cameras, hidden microphones, phone tappers, emergency enemy eradicators...\n\nWell, let's not let our imaginations run away with us. The reality of working behind the scenes on Spooks (BBC TV's espionage drama) is not quite that James Bond, although there is a lot of 'rolling around on cars', apparently.\n\n'Mostly it's \"cut off the end of a washing up bottle\"-type gizmos,' says Raza Jaffrey, who plays spook Zaf Younis. 'But the set does have some techy things too - Apple Macs and lots of boys' toys, which are great. I suppose I am a bit of a gadget boy really.' Lucky for us, since we picked Raza to test five digital cameras.\n\n'I love having a camera I can just throw in my bag. Most of all, I love playing about with pictures on my computer, cropping them and editing them and changing colours... Do I sound like a real geek now?'\n\nSlightly, but we don't mind - although Raza's wife (co-star Miranda Raison, who plays the young ex-journalist spook Jo) might. 'I'm always spending my money on gadgets and cars. It's my downfall,' he says. 'I'm completely obsessed with them.' So obsessed, in fact, that he took all five cameras on his honeymoon to test them out for us - although he's resigned himself to giving up some of his gadget-lust. 'Now I'm just going to be buying things like sofas for our new house.'\n\nRaza's just finished filming a BBC series called Mistresses and appears in a mystery movie, Eastern Promises, due out next month. As for Spooks, will Zaf be next in line to die for his country? 'There's always three or four of us who bite the bullet every series... but you'll just have to wait and see.'\n\n· The new series of Spooks start on BBC1 on 16 October at 9pm. 'Cash' has five box sets of series five on DVD to give away (worth £39.99 each). Send a postcard to Observer Cash, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London, EC1R 5EJ, before 11 October to be in with a chance to win one.\n\n1. Olympus Mju 760 digital camera (£159)\n\nThey say\n\nExpress yourself in style with the super-chic, silver-finish Olympus Mju 760. This metal-bodied head-turner features a powerful 3x optical zoom lens (37-111mm) to capture refined detail in your shooting and get a closer look at the action. An imaging sensor with 7.1 million pixels ensures pictures are crisp and detailed, while a weatherproof, full-metal casing means you can take it to the surf or slopes without fear of letting in moisture.\n\n...And Raza says\n\nThis felt quite dated. The lens sticks out and gives the camera an unusual shape - it's not particularly sleek and wouldn't fit in my pocket. I found this a bit big for a digital camera, but at least it was light. I wasn't impressed by the picture quality either - they weren't especially sharp and the colours didn't look great, but it did work in low light. The menu was complicated, with loads of different modes - not very intuitive.\n\n2. Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ2EB-S digital camera (£269)\n\nThey say\n\nThis camera has a remarkable 10x optical zoom and a 28mm wide-angle lens in a stylish, compact body. The 28mm lens allows you easily to capture a large group of people or expansive architectural structures and landscapes with dynamic width and rich perspective. The Optical Image Stabiliser will minimise any jitter from shaky hands, preventing blurry photos and ensuring your images are captured with excellent clarity and sharpness. Uses a 6 megapixel resolution.\n\n...And Raza says\n\nThe picture quality wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about. The camera looked dated and quite bulky - the bulkiest of the lot in fact. The image quality was better than the Olympus and it had a really good zoom, but I thought that this was way too expensive for something that was quite a routine digital camera.\n\n3. Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T100S digital camera, (£329)\n\nThey say\n\nThis camera displays crystal clear, 8.1 megapixel images on a massive, three-inch LCD screen. Intuitive touch-screen menus enable a sleeker design, while dynamic slide show features offer four selectable modes. Includes double anti-blur technology and Super SteadyShot optical image stabilisation, plus highlight sensitivity, minimising blur when capturing fast-moving subjects or shooting at faster shutter speeds when the flash cannot be used.\n\n...And Raza says\n\nThis looks great - it's sleek and slim - but I was disappointed. I've always had a Sony camera and loved it, but this has a shutter on the front that moves back to turn on, and it would turn itself on in my pocket. It also has many superfluous features - if I'd wanted that many, I'd have bought an SLR. On the plus side, it has a beautiful screen with magnificent colours.\n\n4. Canon IXUS 70 digital camera (£159)\n\nThey say\n\nThe Canon Digital IXUS 70 brings contemporary style to the original minimalist masterpiece. A 7.1 megapixel CCD image sensor captures your scene in razor-sharp detail. A 3x optical zoom gets you up close to your subject and there's a high resolution 2.5-inch LCD screen to frame and play back your shots. Canon's advanced DIGIC III processor ensures quick responses, superb image quality and noise reduction for a sharper, clearer photo. There are also 17 shooting modes to help you find the perfect shot.\n\n...And Raza says\n\nThis is my favourite; it produced great images. It's got a sharp face-finder feature that finds people and then lets you half-click to focus on them - I really liked that. It coped well in low light and came up trumps in bright sunlight on the beach. It's got a smaller zoom than some of the others, but makes up for this with its clarity of shots. It's a clever little thing, takes the best pictures and is the best value for money.\n\n5. Casio EXILIM EX-V7 digital camera (£199.95)\n\nThey say\n\nThe Casio EX-V7 is the world's slimmest digital camera, with a 7x optical lens and 7.2 megapixels - just snap away and then slip it into a shirt pocket or small handbag. The EX-V7 introduces innovative functions for reducing blur, made possible by its mechanical CCD shift technology. It will automatically analyse the velocity and vector of a moving subject and set the most appropriate ISO sensitivity and shutter speed. Casio's Anti Shake system also reduces any blur from shaky hands. An exceptionally portable, great-looking digital camera with a powerful zoom lens.\n\n...And Raza says\n\nSecond only to the Canon. The zoom is fantastic and produced really nice photos, even capturing detail in low light. And most people will love the fact that it's so easy to use. But I was let down by the fact that it just didn't feel very portable, even though Canon insists it is. It comes with a docking case and charger, but they are quite big - I wouldn't want to carry those around with me.\n\nPersonal shopper\n\nLook at the resolution - the higher the resolution, the sharper the image. Don't forget that a digital camera's internal memory cannot store many pictures on its own - you'll have to buy a separate memory card to store more images.\n\nThere are many other features to consider, such as shutter speed (some cameras let you select the speed yourself so that you control and capture action shots), image stabilisers (to counteract camera shake) and LCD screen viewfinders. You can order cameras online, but go into the store and try one out before you buy. Play around with the features and functions you might need and pick the one you like."
