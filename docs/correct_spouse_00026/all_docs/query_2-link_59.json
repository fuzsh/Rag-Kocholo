        "text": "Popular spy series Spooks is set to return to our TV screens in the autumn, it has been announced. Rupert Penry-Jones, Hermione Norris and Peter Firth return as officers Adam, Ros and Harry of Section D, MI5 in the 10-episode BBC series. Raza Jaffrey, Miranda Raison and Hugh Simon also reprise their roles as Zaf, Jo and Malcolm, and welcome new arrival Connie, played by Gemma Jones. The series sees Iran's covert scheme to become a nuclear power leading to growing mistrust between the British, American and Iranian governments. The volatile climate culminates in a series of high-risk operations both at home and abroad. The opening episode sees Zaf, undercover in Tehran, placing a bomb on a civilian train in an effort to flush out a key Iranian spy. Producer Katie Swinden said: \"For the first time ever, we've chosen to explore one theme throughout the series, and one which is an ongoing concern in today's world affairs agenda. The relationship between Britain, Iran and the US is such a delicate and topical issue that it opens up a wealth of new storyline possibilities to us. \"Audiences will be able to follow Adam, Harry, Ros and the team as they take on their most challenging operation to date, and will get to see them in a whole new range of dangerous and exciting situations.\""
