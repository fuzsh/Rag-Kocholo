        "text": "Spring Awakening\n\nAmaro's (Danny Pino) recklessness once again makes him the target of Internal Affairs, and he has no choice but to face the consequences. With his professional and personal life at risk, he looks to his friend John Munch (Belzer) for advice. Meanwhile, an online ad for escorts leads to the rape and robbery of several male tourists, and one of the suspects has a surprising connection to Sergeant Benson (Mariska Hargitay) that may change her life forever.\n\nEnough Nemesis to go Around\n\nHolmes returns to New York with a new apprentice and a renewed interest in working with the NYPD after being fired by London's MI6. However, Captain Gregson won't let him resume consulting for the department without permission from his former partner, Watson, the NYPD's new go-to private investigator. Gina Gershon and Ophelia Lovibond guest star.\n\nBella\n\nWhen a groundbreaking artificial intelligence software program is stolen, Sherlock agrees to take on the case, but enlists Joan's assistance in solving it when he becomes more interested in disproving the computer's abilities than finding the thief. Meanwhile, Joan confronts Sherlock about his motives after she learns he has been in direct contact with her boyfriend, Andrew, without her knowledge.\n\nJust a Regular Irregular\n\nSherlock helps a math genius from his network of \"Irregulars\" experts after he stumbles upon a body while participating in a math puzzle competition. Meanwhile, Joan attempts to extend an olive branch after she learns about Kitty's past. NFL legend Phil Simms guest stars.\n\nHemlock\n\nWhen a debt collector is murdered, Holmes and Watson attempt to narrow down a suspect pool of thousands of consumers who owed the man money. Meanwhile, Watson's relationship with Andrew progresses when he asks her to meet his father for the first time."
