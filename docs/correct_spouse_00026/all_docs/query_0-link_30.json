        "text": "Halfway through our talk about his developing role in Homeland, Raza Jaffrey shatters the frail romantic hopes of a fair swathe of the UK population. For three years, the saturninely handsome 39-year-old, a female favourite in Spooks, Mistresses and Smash, has been living in Los Angeles with the bewitching Lara Pulver, 34, whose artful nude scene in Sherlock remains seared on the minds of most men who saw it.\n\n“Lara is such a fantastic girl, she really is, and we… we... we are really excited about getting married this year,” he blurts. Wow. Damn. Congratulations! “Thank you. That’s partly why I am racing around, back in London. We are trying to sort out arrangements because we are getting married here in the UK at Christmas. We were getting married in the States but a lot of our friends and family are here.”\n\nHaving said the word “married” three times in 30 seconds, a measure of reticence kicks back in. The wedding will be “in town” and the honeymoon probably in New Zealand “because we love being out in nature and stuff”. Last year Pulver suggested she might want children soonish. “Um, I don’t really want to talk about that,” mumbles Jaffrey. “I’ll let what she said stand.”\n\nBut where previously he’s talked in the first person singular, suddenly it’s all “we”. He and Pulver love Los Angeles because of its newness. “We live on Mulholland Drive: you can stand up there and look downtown, and there was nothing there 100 years ago, just scrubland.” They hike and explore California together, but they also have the use of a friend’s flat in Marylebone when they come back. “I miss London on nights in June or in October. Something Lara and I tend to do each time we get back to London is take that walk across Waterloo Bridge and along the Thames, out east as far as we can go before we get tired. It reminds you of where you are and how great the city is.”\n\nThey miss friends here too, and the theatre. “There isn’t really a theatre culture in LA, which is odd when there are so many brilliant actors there.” Pulver has just finished an acclaimed run in Gypsy at Chichester Festival Theatre, during which Jaffrey jetted back from shooting Homeland in South Africa for snatched romantic weekends. “I had seen her on stage before but never in a musical,” he enthuses, “and seeing how she tackled Gypsy and what she has done with the character — I have more and more respect for her as an actress as well as a person as time has gone on. She’s a wonderful actress. But even if she wasn’t I’d still be getting married.” All right, rub it in, why don’t you.\n\nWe turn back to Homeland. Interest in the US show is almost as fevered as interest in Jaffrey and Pulver. After a wonky third season culminated in the death of Damian Lewis’s antihero Brody, the fourth is back with a bang, the bulk of the action dramatically relocated to Pakistan (actually Cape Town in disguise). So far we’ve seen Claire Danes’s bipolar CIA agent Carrie abandon her and Brody’s baby, order a drone strike that wiped out a wedding party, and seduce the young nephew of an alleged terrorist. We’ve only had a taster of Jaffrey’s character Aaser Khan, an officer in the Pakistani intelligence service ISI, as he locks horns with Carrie’s mentor, Saul, and with his hardline colleague Tasneem Kureishi, but his role ramps up in coming weeks. Is he behind Saul’s kidnapping at the end of the last episode?\n\n“Khan doesn’t know as much about what’s going on in ISI as he gives the impression he does,” says Jaffrey darkly. “The new guard is Tasneem, played brilliantly by Nimrat Kaur, who is far more revolutionary in her outlook for Pakistan. Khan represents the English-educated, more northern European philosophy of the old guard, in young form. It’s another way of [the writers] saying how complicated Pakistan is. Khan is caught up [in internal politics] but he also has sympathies for Carrie and respects her as an officer.”\n\nIn forthcoming episodes Khan and Carrie both have to face up to the moral dimension of their actions (MAJOR SPOILER ALERT). “There’s a drone strike coming up in episode six where Carrie has to take some very tough decisions about Saul’s life,” says Jaffrey. “And in episode seven there are some really great scenes involving the ISI getting hold of her medication.” He talked to some people in the security services in advance — “I was wary of Googling that stuff in case I was put in an orange jumpsuit” — but trusts the writers to create complex, intelligent, well-researched characters. “Homeland is not a sensationalist show.”\n\nJaffrey thinks the relocation of this series from America to Pakistan, and the moral ambivalence infecting every character, testify to the refusal of Homeland’s creators ever to go for the easy option. Carrie’s seduction of young Aayan is “a dark moment that has consequences. But I think we would be naive to believe that kind of thing wouldn’t go on. If you’ve got to turn an asset, what are you gonna do?” Similarly, if we focus on Carrie’s lack of maternal instincts or her erratic mental state, we are missing a major point: “She is damn good at what she does. People often say the CIA would never hang on to someone like that, but if her instincts are good enough, you’ve got to wonder if they wouldn’t take risks on her behaviour.”\n\nHe is full of praise for Danes’s investment in her character, but also her ability to step out of it once the director yells “cut”. “It’s an extraordinary talent of hers that she can turn it on and turn it off again, take after take,” he says. “There are some scenes coming up when she is reaching the depths of despair. She was having to sob and sob and sob, time and time again, and she just did it with such grace.”\n\nJaffrey thinks British actors do well in Los Angeles because “they bring their A-game”: at auditions, you can tell the Brits by their ironed shirts and shined shoes, while the Americans are all in T-shirts. He doesn’t think US TV is any better than ours, there’s just more of it. He also torpedoes the idea that America is some sort of haven for non-white actors who are underused in the UK.\n\nIn both Mistresses and in Smash he was partnered with white actresses, and his ethnicity wasn’t an issue, but lead roles are few and far between on both sides of the Atlantic. Besides, though he is gracious about my inevitable questions on race in the industry, he balks at being labelled an “Asian” actor. “I am very proud of having mixed-race heritage,” he says. “Being a product of those two cultures and being relatively well adjusted is something to talk about as well as being black or Asian or white.”"
