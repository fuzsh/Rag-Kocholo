        "text": "Spooks star Miranda Raison has spent the night at actor Ralf Little's house - only weeks after splitting from her husband.\n\nMiranda, 29 - agent Jo Portman in the BBC1 drama - arrived at the actor's west London home clutching a duvet and large handbag at 11.48pm on Friday.\n\nThe blonde, who broke up with former Spooks co-star husband Raza Jaffrey last month, emerged at 11.15am yesterday - minus bedding.\n\nRalf, 28, who shot to fame as Antony in The Royle Family, left 10 minutes later to join pals at a football match. A source said: \"Miranda was also at Ralf's earlier in the week. They have become very close recently and spend time at his local pub with his mates.\"\n\nMiranda first met Ralf earlier this year when they were filming ITV1 comedy drama Married, Single, Other, to be screened early next year.\n\nBut pals say their friendship has blossomed recently.\n\nMiranda met Raza, 34, on the Spooks set in 2005.\n\nShe married the actor, who played undercover operative Zafar Younis, in 2007 at Aldeburgh, Suffolk, near her childhood home. But cracks appeared in the relationship after Raza quit the show two years ago.\n\nRalf dated TV presenter Lisa Rogers in 2001."
