        "text": "FANS of our favourite TV spies know what to expect. It won't be easy, but we'll have to watch to the bitter end.\n\nThe rollercoaster ride of the current series reaches a point of no return for Ros (Hermione Norris) in episode eight of\n\nSpooks (BBC1, Tuesday, 9pm)\n\n.\n\nCan World War Three be averted? Will everyone survive? And, although some of the plot devices are plain daft, can it get any more exciting?\n\nThis week's code cracking with half-a-second to spare prize goes to MI5 spook Jo Portman, played by Miranda Raison (pictured).\n\nWith two more episodes to come after this, the drama is far from over for Jo, amid the emergence of another rogue organisation which tortures spies to extract intelligence.\n\nFor now, double agent group Yalta are out to knock out America's satellite system in this week's thriller, which includes a shock for Harry (Peter Firth).\n\nBy the end of the series we find out exactly what happened to agent Zaf Younis.\n\nHe was played by Raza Jaffrey, who found real life romance with Miranda on the set of Spooks. The couple married in September.\n\nFortunately, an occupational hazard of her role had healed by the time of the wedding, but Miranda missed three weeks of filming after picking up a head injury while shooting an action scene.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I couldn't blame it on anyone but myself,\" she smiles.\n\n\"We were filming a scene all morning, hurdling these bollards. But it was the last scene of the day and we were all tired.\n\n\"I fell and whacked my head on a heavy door - so I had to take time off. They couldn't cover it up.\n\n\"It was painful at the time but then it was just boring because I felt fine and wanted to come back.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can run in a straight line now. I try to stay quite fit, anyway. But you're certainly more aware of it working on this. You want to look in good nick.\" She adds: \"Hermione trained as a ballet dancer and she's fantastic at choreography. I have to work a bit harder with the action and fight scenes.\n\n\"It's often easier when you're fighting with stunt men because they can compensate for your weaknesses. It's when you're fighting actor-on-actor that people get a bit over-excited and a bit nervous.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Miranda played 1930s New York showgirl Tallulha in two episodes of Doctor Who, as the Daleks invaded Manhattan.\n\nHer on-screen transformation was such that even some dedicated Spooks viewers may have failed to recognise her.\n\nComfortable\n\n\"I was quite comfortable with the accent but I was really nervous about the singing. I was convinced they were going to dub over her. But they didn't. I got an availability check for Chicago after that!\n\n\"Filming Doctor Who is so incredibly different to Spooks. Near to the surface, there's quite a silly atmosphere. A lot of the times you're on the verge of giggles because it's so over the top.\n\n\"David Tennant is the nicest guy in the world, but it's just crazy and you're constantly in hysterics, thinking how surreal it all is. I was genuinely frightened when I saw the Daleks. These ridiculous-looking things absolutely get to the core of you when you're standing in front of one.\n\n\"I've had more fan mail from Doctor Who than anything. People love the show so passionately.\n\n\"My brother and sister are still at school and I went to give a talk.\n\n\"They know far more about Spooks and Doctor Who than they do about geography.\"\n\nIn October, Miranda appeared alongside former Blue star Duncan James in Plus One, part of Channel 4's Comedy Showcase series.\n\nShe also features as teacher Madame Blanche in a forthcoming ITV1 Poirot film called Cat Among The Pigeons.\n\nNorfolk-born Miranda, 27, admits the MI5 drama has given her pause for thought.\n\nThat's when she returns to see her mum in Norfolk and dad in Suffolk. \"It does make you think about what the people you are playing are doing. There are times, on the tube or wherever, where you're suddenly very aware of everything.\n\n\"I'm a country girl. I disappear to Suffolk and distance myself from it.\n\n\"I spend as much time as possible there. It does feel so ridiculously safe, so far away from anything. You could still get hit by a tractor, but...\"\n\nFor all the latest news from the world of television, check out Ian Wylie's blog, The Life of\n\nWylie\n\n."
