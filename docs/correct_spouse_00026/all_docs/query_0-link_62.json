        "text": "RE: Departure of Grid Members?\n\nNicola left in Series 5 to have her baby didn't she?\n\nAnd I'm sure Miranda Raison was an unamicable one, because I can remember reading an article she did with her mum in which she thanked her for her helping her when she got told she was out of Spooks. And I think there was some press about it at the time too.\n\nRE: [spoilers] Departure of Grid Members?\n\nI believe Olga left of her own accord due to being pregnant as did NW in S5. I'm sure I recall David saying in an interview he'd chosen to go, he had something else in the pipeline, can't remember what. Shauna just disappeared didn't she, she wasn't even given an exit other than some mention about being devastated. The others, I don't know. That's the nature of show biz I suppose!\n\nRE: [spoilers] Departure of Grid Members?\n\nRPJ did an interview on season 6 extras where he said that everybody bar one left of their own accord, on their own terms. I am sure that Hugh Simon and Gemma Jones did too and as has already been pointed out Nicola certainly did, as did David and Olga.\n\nI am surprised to hear that Miranda's leaving might not have been amicable. I don't remember reading anything like that at the time and I couldn't find anything on a quick google search. She worked on the show across five seasons and if there was bad blood I am sure we would have heard about it at the time. Then again, she did spill the beans on a GMTV interview about her leaving which pissed a lot of people off.\n\nMany thanks to Tyger for a terrific signature RE: [spoilers] Departure of Grid Members?\n\nFor such a small cast, there were a lot of pregnancies eh? Case of take care which chair you sit on ^^\n\nSlightly off topic, but MM and KH also met and fell in love on the spooks set (both of them married at the time). Now I'm not judging, just saying that Spooks means something entirely different to the viewers than it does the cast. It's their job and their lives. I don't think the public ever really know what influences casting decisions from either POV of production company or cast. Often the PR/press info is about face saving, or what they think the viewer wants to hear and never about the truth. The actor needs to work again in a very small pond. Peter Firth (the legend himself) once said - listen to what a producer tells you and believe the opposite. Or words to that effect. Show biz is far more of a game than spying, IMO!\n\nRE: [spoilers] Departure of Grid Members?\n\n(02-11-2011 05:08 PM)JHyde Wrote: RPJ did an interview on season 6 extras where he said that everybody bar one left of their own accord, on their own terms.

This would have been before Miranda Raison.\n\nIt does seem that Kudos didn't just decide to axe characters indiscriminately.\n\nThanks everyone for the replies."
