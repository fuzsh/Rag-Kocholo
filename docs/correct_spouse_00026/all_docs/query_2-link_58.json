        "text": "When you hear the word, Spooks it is probably closely followed by that opening melody of 'dun dun, dundundun' playing in your head.\n\nThe much-loved London espionage drama picked up an army of fans during its 10 series.\n\nIt makes us feel old to think the first episode aired 19 years ago in 2002.\n\nThough if you gave in to temptation and binge-watched the MI5 drama on iPlayer during lockdown, you'll know the show has stood the test of time, even if some of the tech is a bit dated.\n\nLike a lot of spy dramas, the body count has been rather high.\n\nSpoiler alert, fans were horrified when much-loved characters such as Adam Carter, Jo Portman and even tech operative Colin Wells, were killed off in high octane operations.\n\nI don’t need to talk about the famous chip pan fat fryer scene for you to get who I am talking about.\n\nAfter the show, the actors who played the iconic roles went on to do all sorts of different things.\n\nLet’s take a look at what they have been up to since the show ended in 2011.\n\nPeter Firth\n\nThe firm but respected head of section D counter-terrorism department, Harry Pearce was not to be messed with.\n\nThe experienced former field agent for MI6 was exactly the type of person you would want in charge during a crisis, but my God did he see a lot of his colleagues killed.\n\nThe divorced dad of two, with a soft spot for Ruth Evershed which later blossomed into love, was played by Yorkshireman Peter Firth.\n\nThe actor, who can do an impressive London accent, went on to star in BBC period drama Dickensian, ITV’s Regal series Victoria and also had a stint in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\n\nHe also reprised his spy role for the 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good, though we can’t imagine a world where Harry and Ruth are not together.\n\nIn real life, he has been married three times and has four children.\n\nNicola Walker\n\nThe brainy senior Intelligence Analyst Ruth Evershed, played by Nicola Walker, was fluent in eight languages - though her Cantonese was famously 'horrible' - and was a core member of the team.\n\nShe joined in series 2 as a GCHQ spy but became a trusted member of section D working out obscure connections and helping the operatives save the day.\n\nHer character was unlucky in love, to say the least, and after lame dates, her eventual husband was killed. Her office romance with Harry took a long time to build but when the timing was finally right, and they agreed to leave the service and retire together, disaster struck,\n\nThe son of Harry’s former lover dramatically stabbed her on the edge of a hill.\n\nIt was pretty emotional seeing such a beautiful landscape juxtaposed against Ruth collapsing in her partner’s arms - damn you BBC for taking us on this rollercoaster!\n\nIt still brings tears to our eyes today, remembering Harry visiting the house where they were going to move to after she died.\n\nNicola Walker took a break from the series in 2006 to have a baby before returning in 2009.\n\nShe has since gone on to take the lead role of DCI Cassie Stuart in Unforgotten, played Gillian Greenwood in the Last Tango in Halifax and even voiced the part of Síle de Tansarville in the video game Witcher 2 and 3.\n\nThe Stepney-born actress is married to fellow thespian Barnaby Kay and together they share a son, Harry, about whom we wonder whether he was named after the legendary Mr Pearce.\n\nMatthew Macfadyen\n\nChief of section D, Matthew Macfadyen's Tom Quinn was known for his brooding leadership and calm strategic planning.\n\nBoth a blessing and a curse, he was deeply analytical, which caused him to eventually question the brutal aspects of his job.\n\nAfter an explosive two seasons, in which he was framed for murder, wounded Harry and led a life on the run as a homeless person, he finally cleared his name.\n\nBy after he was reinstated at Thames House, he had a mental breakdown after battling thoughts about the so-called greater good he was fighting for.\n\nHis dating life was equally complicated and he went out with a single mum, before his work put her child at risk, then dated a CIA worker he was professionally often in conflict with.\n\nUnlike lots of other key characters, however, he did not leave in a body bag and left the service on two feet.\n\nBut it wasn’t the last time audiences would see Matthew in the role and he returned for a cameo part in the final episode of series 10, much to the delight of fans.\n\nMatthew met his wife on the show, Ashes to Ashes star Keely Hawkes.\n\nThey married in 2004 and went on to have two children together, with Matthew becoming stepfather to her son from a previous marriage.\n\nToday the 46-year-old, who was born in Great Yarmouth, has gone on to some pretty impressive roles.\n\nAs well as starring in Succession, he played an unforgettable Mr Darcy for an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.\n\nRupert Penry-Jones\n\nA crush for a lot of people watching the show, Rupert Penry-Jones' charismatic Adam Carter took over section D after Tom’s departure.\n\nAlthough fans took a while to warm up to him.\n\nHe was very different from his predecessor and brought with him experience as an M16 agent.\n\nThe married father of one also showed what it was like to have a family while protecting the capital from the threat of terrorism.\n\nBut as his son went to boarding school, the couple didn’t have to worry themselves about last minute child care plans when a bomb was about to go off in London.\n\nHowever, they did play with fire, jointly taking part in dangerous missions that could have easily ended in death.\n\nOne such operation did go wrong for his on-screen wife Fiona, and a plot involving her former husband eventually ended in her demise.\n\nHe continued to work and hired a nanny who he briefly dated, but suffered from nightmares about his dead wife and wished he could have died instead.\n\nHe also has romantic relations with the wife of the Iranian Special Consul, Dariush Bakhshi and colleague Ros Myers.\n\nHe gets more and more reckless as the series progresses especially after a member of his team has been tortured and another was raped,\n\nIn an explosive exit, which was voted fourth most shocking death in the series by Radio Times readers, he was blown up in a car bomb, leaving Wes an orphan.\n\nRupert Penry-Jones went on to star in much loved legal drama Silk taking the part of Clive Reader and took the lead role as a detective inspector in Whitechapel.\n\nHe has big things planned for 2022 and will star alongside Robert Patterson in The Batman movie.\n\nKeely Hawes\n\nOxford graduate Zoe Reynolds, played by Keely Hawes, had a keen linguistic ability and joined the team as a junior case officer at the start of the show.\n\nShe moved in with colleague Danny Hunter and although they had a brother and sister love-hate relationship, there were underlying romantic tensions at the time.\n\nThis came to the foreground when she met and became engaged to photographer Will North.\n\nHowever just as she had risen the ranks at Thames House and found the man of her dreams it all went a bit wrong. Can't one MI5 character ride off into the sunset? Ok we know, we know!\n\nShe was found guilty in court with conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nHer team stepped in and arranged for her to secretly escape to Chile instead of spending a decade behind bars.\n\nDanny put all his ill-feeling towards her fiance behind him and took a risk telling Will where she was.\n\nThe couple rejoined and sent him a postcard from South America.\n\nActress Keely Hawes who went on to become a firm favourite in British drama series.\n\nShe appeared in Ashes to Ashes, The Bodyguard, Line of Duty and The Missing.\n\nMarried to Matthew Macfadyen, she has one child from a previous relationship and another two with her co-star.\n\nDavid Oyelowo\n\nThe well-dressed analyst with a penchant for leather jackets, David Oyelowo's Danny Hunter excelled in high-pressurised environments.\n\nHe got into a little trouble with finances early on but more than made up for it by the second series when he went undercover as a trader.\n\nHe met his end on the show after being captured along with colleague Fiona Carter by Iraqi terrorists.\n\nWhen they try to escape and kill one of their captors, the leader declares that one of them must die.\n\nHe gives the choice to section D leader Adam, who is married to Fiona and rings him up on the phone.\n\nAfter saying a prayer, Danny provokes the terrorist to save his colleagues from making the awful decision.\n\nHe is then shot in the head.\n\nHis team arrives on the scene and Ruth cradles him but there is nothing anyone can do.\n\nAfter Spooks, David Oyelowo took parts in The Good Wife, Selma, United Kingdom, Planet of the Apes and Jack Reacher.\n\nHe is married to fellow actress Jessica and the couple live with their four children in Los Angeles.\n\nRichard Armitage\n\nRichard Armitage's character Lucas North is brought into the show in series seven and he has an impressive backstory.\n\nThe former head of section D before Tom, he was imprisoned during an operation in Russia and brought back to the UK after eight years behind bars.\n\nHaving once been the best in the field, viewers were not sure whether the character should be trusted or was working as a double agent.\n\nHe found it hard adjusting to his old life and would have flashbacks about being tortured (although he kept it hidden from his team) and emotional fall out from talking to his ex-wife\n\nAlthough Lucas works hard at getting section D to trust him, he doesn't always follow the rules but manages to toes the line till season eight when he comes into contact with one of his former interrogators from prison.\n\nJuggling these emotions along with new CIA flame Sarah Caufield proves troublesome.\n\nSeries nine is where he really becomes undone and after a colleague's death (yes another one) his dark past and former lover is revealed.\n\nHe leaves the show after jumping off a tall building in front of Harry.\n\nArmitage, went on to star in Captain America, The Hobbit,

learning her father Sir Jocelyn Myers is funding a conspiracy.\n\nShe helps the team foil the plot and is offered a job by Adam.\n\nQuite cold and pragmatic, Ros will do whatever it takes to get the job done, keeping her emotions locked inside.\n\nWhile on a rescue mission she is kidnapped by Yalta which is opposed to American hegemony and they torture her before recruiting her.\n\nThey also brainwash her into thinking the US is manipulating the UK during peal deals with Iran.\n\nWhen the CIA starts killing off members of the group, Ros admits to section D she has been working for them but says she want to help bring them down.\n\nIn trues Spooks style she is injected with poison by a high-ranking Yalta member, but not all is as it seems.\n\nAdams managers to switch the jab with a
