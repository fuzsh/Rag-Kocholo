        "text": "Q You’re back! We thought your character Jo in Spooks has been killed off.\n\nNewlywed Miranda Raison’s ‘back from the dead’ as Jo Portman in Spooks – with a new leading man for company\n\nQ You’re back! We thought your character Jo in Spooks has been killed off.\n\nA No, she was kidnapped and raped by a rogue terrorist group, the Redbacks. During the final scenes, Jo begged her fellow captive and superior officer Adam Carter to kill her rather than let her be subjected to a brutal torture. It was a classic cliffhanger. The final shot depicted Adam slumped in the corner of their cell, with Jo’s lifeless body across his lap.\n\nQ So he hadn’t done what she’d asked then.\n\nA That’s right. It’s great having that element of surprise, though. I knew I was coming back for series seven by that point, but we did shoot alternative endings for the series, you know, because people reserve the right to change their minds, on both sides. We actually ending up using the ‘Jo’s dead’ ending to show her lying in Adam’s arms anyway, we just didn’t go all the way with it.\n\nQ You’re back but the actor who played Adam, Rupert Penry-Jones, is gone. Does it feel very different without him?\n\nA It’s been very, very different without him around. We were close, and I’ve known him a long time now. I think Adam always saw Jo as the newbie, because he recruited her. Now Lucas (Richard Armitage) is around, that has changed and he sees her in a different way. With the way things happened in the first episode, Adam being blown up like that, characters don’t get goodbyes or to say what they want to say. I was just glad that Rupert and I had some really nice scenes together before he left, some of the nicest stuff that we’ve done together, quite moving I think.\n\nQ It’s a show that has built a reputation for killing off its main characters at unexpected moments. Do you spend time thinking about how they’re going to do away with you?\n\nA It’d have to be taking a bullet for Harry (Section D boss, played by Peter Firth), that’d be the ultimate, wouldn’t it? Leaping in front of him and taking multiple bullets, that’s how I’d like to go. I think everyone believes the cast don’t know when they’re going to get killed off until they read it in the script, but you do get a warning. You just hope that if you go, it’s by mutual consent and you’re not getting chucked and bumped off.\n\nQ Of screen, what’s been happening with you?\n\nA Loads, I’ve got married to Raza Jaffrey (who played the now-deceased Zaf Younis between series three and six in Spooks). But I don’t feel like a grown-up! I’ve never felt like that, yet getting married is such a grown-up thing to do. We had friends over recently, and we realised we were all married couples, which was strange. I’m beginning to realise being grown-up isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Nothing’s been that different since getting married, though. You probably notice it more if you change your name, but I’m still Miranda Raison, although I might be Miranda Jaffrey if I’m writing to Raza’s family. I’m not changing my name because it doesn’t make sense with work. Jessica Stephenson has done it, though, and it’s a hard thing to do, although she is very well established and known – I think I’d just be shooting myself in the foot if I did it!\n\nQ What’s the best thing about being married?\n\nA Having those networks of family – he’s got a massive family, I’ve got a massive family, and everyone’s now linked for good. That’s the main difference, there hasn’t been anything too freaky or smug about it, it’s just lovely.\n\nSpooks is on Monday on BBC One at 9pm."
