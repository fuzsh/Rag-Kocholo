(The first time the banners of the forum started featuring each Spooks' character when it was Zoe's I thought 'why does she look so familiar?' )\n\nAs for Matthew McFadyen even if I'm 23 I saw Colin's P&P first and then MM's so I do like much better Colin's Mr.Darcy.\n\nLNF\n\nRE: Spooks Actors--former projects thread\n\nHas anyone seen Raza Jaffrey in Mistresses? I thought he was amazing and absolutely completely adorable as the poor betrayed husband. And a fantastic actor, esp. that scene when he finds out he's not the father :'(\n\nJust rewatched Bridget Jones again today and Gemma Jones as the mum still makes me laugh sooo much even after the millionth time I've seen haha\n\nRE: Spooks Actors--former projects thread\n\nHaven't seen Raza in Mistresses, but the advert looked good\n\nGemma Jones is just hilarious in Bridget Jones' Diary - the lavender wedding in the second film is just\n\nAnd I think she's very good as Madam Pomfrey in the Harry Potter films!\n\nRE: Spooks Actors--former projects thread\n\nI haven't realize it was Gemma Jones who played Bridget's mom! Now I just want to re-watch just to see her. I remember the character and I can't place her as 'Connie'\n\n(31-01-2010 08:07 PM)Nia M Wrote: And I think she's very good as Madam Pomfrey in the Harry Potter films!\n\nI discovered that a couple of months ago, so when I watched the Half Blood Prince I looked for her and just grinned when she appeared\n\nLNF\n\nRE: Spooks Actors--former projects thread\n\nI was shocked when I was watching Mr Bean and suddenly MM appeared!! I nearly recognised him.\n\nHere is the video if you want to see him\n\n\"Our doubts are traitors, and make us lose the good we oft might win, by fearing to attempt\"\n\nPactum serva RE: Spooks Actors--former projects thread\n\nSaw Tim McInnerny (Oliver Mace) last night in Miss Marple. I am still seeing an average of one spooks actor a day, I'm not sure if this means I need to get out more!!!\n\nWe move on from this\n\nIt's the realisation that I make a negligible difference\n\nSometimes you have to give a man a chance"
