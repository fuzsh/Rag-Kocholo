Spooks stars Raza Jaffrey and Miranda Raison are dating.

The pair fell for each other during filming for the BBC One spy drama, and were recently spotted enjoying a romantic break together in New York.

"The attraction between them was pretty instant," a source on the show told The Mirror. "They didn't want everyone to make a big thing of it, especially as Miranda is new to the show, but they couldn't help themselves.

"They tried to keep things as low-key as possible but they're very happy. It's an open secret. There's real chemistry between them and they're enjoying spending time together."

Another insider added, "[Miranda] and Raza got together at the wrap party in August after filming had finished. They were concerned what the bosses might say, but everyone's been great about it."

Raza is better known as Zafar Younis on the series, while Miranda plays Jo Portman.
