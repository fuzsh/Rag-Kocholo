It consists of a classified, indexed, and anno­ tated bibliography of the secondary literature on the history of mathe­ matics preceded by a brief manual on methodology. The bibliography contains about 31,000 entries under about 3,700 topics. There is appended a coded list of about 3,000 periodicals in which papers on mathematics and its history have appeared. The introductions to the parts and chapters give further descriptive details. The scientific literature of mathematics (excluding populariza� tions and elementary textbooks) now consists of about half a million titles and is growing at the rate of more than 15,000 titles a year (see K. 0. May, \"Quantitative Growth of the Mathematical Litera­ ture,\" Science, 154 [1966], 16721673). This enormous collection is not indexed. No one knows its nature or contents.' Preliminary studies suggest that there is a vast amount of duplication, and that the important information is contained in perhaps as little as 10 per cent of the titles (see K. 0. May, \"Growth and Quality of the Mathematical Literature,\" Isis, 59 [1968], 363-371). No one has suggested a way of measuring mathe­ matical information, but it is certainly true that many publica­ tions contain several new mathe­ matical results. It seems likely\n\nthat the number of items of mathe­ matical information is of the order of one million. It may well be most efficient in the long run to code and index the entire literature, but there is no possibility of doing this in the near future. The problem then remains of obtaining effective entry to this storehouse so as to find information, orienta­ tion, and enlightenment. Often the best path to primary sources of mathematical information is through materials prepared with historical motives. These include bibliographies, bibliographical works, and historical studies of topics, periods, and other categor­ ies around which the mathematical enterprise can be organized con­ ceptually. The historical litera­ ture in this broad sense is valuable in itself, is often the most useful point of entry in any information retrieval problem, and is necessary in planning further indexing of the mathematical literature. It is for this reason that I attack it first, leaving for the future the much bigger problem of indexing the sub­ stantive mathematical literature. The manual for information re­ trieval and handling, which forms Part I of this book, is inspired by experience in research and teaching the history of mathematics over a number of years. I hope that it will save some readers the many hours that are often wasted by those unfamiliar with information sources, efficient procedures for information handling, and standards of scholarly communication. It is based in part on material in a syllabus prepared with support from\n\nthe United States Office of Educa­ tion and used at the University of Toronto (Mathematics since 1800: Syllabus for a Course [University of Toronto, 1967; 2nd ed., 1969]). The bibliography in Part II developed from information-collect­ ing activities that were at first quite personal. Turning to pro­ fessional work in the history of mathematics rather late in my career, I was soon aware of the necessity for efficient, time­ saving methods. Laborious searches of the historical literature would have been required to locate infor­ mation on a number of related topics in which I was interested. It appeared most efficient to search for all of them at once and not much more difficult to index the entire historical literature simultaneously meeting my own needs and saving future scholars from similar tedious searches. Thanks to a Science Faculty Fellowship from the National Science Foundation I was able to devote myself largely to historical research during the years 1962-1965. A grant from the American Philo­ sophical Society supported the initial search of abstracting journals. Grants from the Society of Sigma Xi and the American Council of Learned Societies made possible special projects and studies. During the last six years, the Canada Council has generously supported the most tedious part of the work - completing bibliographic searches, coding, checking, and editing. Many colleagues here and abroad supplied titles or helped identify obscure references. These include G. S. Andonie, G. Arrighi, K.-R. Biermann, P. Bockstaele, C. B. Boyer, R. P. Broughton, H. S. M. Coxeter, P. Delsedime, R. Diesch­ bourg, J. Folta, H. Freudenthal,\n\nTheo. Gerardy, A. Gloden, B. R. Goldstein, J. Itard, G. Maheu, R. M. MacLeod, I. Namioka, L. Novy, M. L. O'Malley, C. J. Scriba, D. J. Struik, R. Taton, K. Vogel, E. P. Wolfers, A. P. Yushkevich. Librarians at the University of Toronto and elsewhere cheerfully handled a heavy load of inquiries and inter-library loans, often finding answers in \"impossible\" cases. The work of searching, recording, checking, and proofreading has been done largely by students and re­ search associates. These include Charles Aronson, Holly Gardner, Charles V. Jones, Gregory H. Moore, Steve Regoczei, Dan Sunday, Henry S. Tropp, Dagney Wakfer, and James H. Willox. Harold P. Anderson identi­ fied and coded journal titles, a task whose difficulty can be appre­ ciated only by someone who has attempted it. He and Henry S. Tropp assisted with the final edit­ ing of the bibliographic chapters. Typing the manuscript for photo­ graphic reproduction was mainly the work of Jill Stiles, who performed this and many other secretarial tasks with her unusual diligence and efficiency. The final checking, editing, and typing of the coded serial list was carried through by Constance Gardner with a care and thoughtfulness that would have reduced error to zero if my impa­ tience had not intervened. Others who assisted with clerical tasks were Gary Adamowicz, Edith Charlot, Sue L. Cline, Bob Holmes, Marilyn Luciano, Miriam May, Gail Pool, Nina Moore, Shirley Ann Sky, Fran Soule, and R. S. Winslow. The College of Education at the University of Toronto supplied office space and photocopy services. I am responsible for planning, choice of sources, classification, selection of entries to be included, and, of course, for all faults and\n\nmistakes. I hope that users will become collaborators by correcting errors and omissions. The present work is based on a growing mathematical information bank of about 200,000 slips con­ taining data on the history, bib­ liography, terminology, and results of mathematics. I hope over the next few years to make more of this information generally available in a mathematical dictionary and other publications. KENNETH O • MAY\n\nToronto, March 1972\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe mathematician, user of mathemat­ ics, or student may approach the mathematical literature with a vari­ ety of motives. He may wish merely to discover the meaning of a word, to find a formula, a theorem, the bare facts about an individual, or the essentials of a topic or branch of mathematics. At a deeper level, he may seek insights provided by the history of an idea, an expository survey of a field, or an account of applications. To lay the basis for a substantive contribution to mathe­ matics, he may wish to know what has already been done. He may be doing research on which to base a contri­ bution of his own to the secondary literature. In every case, he will have to solve problems of retrieving, storing, handling, analysing, and presenting information. It is the purpose of the brief manual to sug­ gest appropriate techniques for at­ tacking such problems efficiently and effectively. The goal of information retrieval is history in the broadest sense - an understandable account of past activ­ ity and results. In some cases, this may appear to involve no histor­ ical (time-dependent) component, such as when a person wants only a mathematical \"fact.\" But even math­ ematical facts are dated, and an apparently timeless piece of mathe­ matical information is simply one that has had a long and stable life. Accordingly I discuss all information retrieval from a historical point of view and consider any non-historical\n\n(\"timeless\") question as a special case. Figure 1 suggests the general pro­ cedure to be followed in doing his­ torical research. The goal is histo­ ry. The raw material for historical analysis is chronology, that is a time-ordered list of events. Chro­ nology is established by searching sources, and it is with this search that I deal in Chapter 1. The con­ struction of a personal information file and the use of this file for analysis and writing are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. Figure 1 shows the investigator starting with topics, consulting ref­ erence sources for bibliographic and chronological information, then sec­ ondary and primary sources, and fi­ nally engaging in analysis and the production of history. To avoid a maze, I have not shown the constant feedback and recycling between sources on the left and records on the right. The investigator does not \"start\" anywhere. He comes to his problem with some information, he uses it to enter the flow where con­ venient, and he moves back and forth between different sources according to opportunity and knowledge. At every stage he records and uses mathe­ matical, historical, and bibliograph­ ical information. From the beginning he critically analyses his stock of information (and misinformation), makes conjectures, draws conclusions, and reconsiders. There should be constant interaction between re­ trieval, storage and use.\n\nFigure 1\n\n1 INFORMATION RETRIEVAL\n\nThe enormous amount of information now in storage in the world presents real problems for the person wishing to retrieve items of interest to him. In part the difficulties arise from the inadequacy of reference tools, but by far the most important factor is ignorance of the facilities already available. This ignorance often leads people to seek answers by picking accessible brains when more reliable information could be obtained easily from printed sources. Information retrieval is not taught in our educational system, even in the education of scholars. It can be fully mastered only by experience, but one can benefit also from the experience of others and from learning general procedures. There are few profound difficulties for most people, and every increase in skill produces immediate rewards. The following brief sketch is not intended as a complete guide but rather as a suggestive survey of activities. Combined with practice it should enable anyone to find the information he needs quickly and surely. TYPES OF SOURCES It is convenient to divide informa­ tion sources according to their proximity to the events. Primary sources are direct rec­ ords or evidence. The most important examples in mathematics are original publications containing contributions to mathematical know­ ledge. Other primary sources include letters, manuscripts, artifacts, reports by witnesses (e.g. notes on lectures), films, pictures, and tapes. Secondary sources are writings based on primary sources. These­ include historical publications, survey treatises, and some textbooks. It often happens that a single pub-\n\nlication contains both primary and secondary materials. The same source may be primary for one purpose and secondary for another. For example, a historical article is a secondary source on its subject and a primary source on its author. Tertiary sources are those based on secondary sources. Typical ex­ amples are dictionaries, encyclo­ paedias, bibliographies, and some textbooks. It is tempting to con­ tinue the classification, since for every n there appear to be n-ary textbooks, and one might even define w-ary sources as those of an entire­ ly speculative character. Primary sources are the essential raw materials for the historian as well as for the mathematician. Nev­ ertheless, secondarY. and tertiary sources are no less essential to the mathematical and scholarly enter­ prise as a whole. Frequently, the primary source on a mathematical topic is quite useless to the mathe­ matician and of interest only to the historian. Moreover, when retrieving information, it is often most effi­ cient to proceed from the tertiary to the primary sources in reverse historical order. Generally it is only from secondary and tertiary sources that one can find out what and where the primary sources are. In some cases, tertiary sources supply all the information required. The desirability and necessity of penetrating toward the primary sources is proportional to the depth and difficulty of the problem. It is usually assumed that an n-ary source is always less reliable than an (n-1)-ary source. In fact, however, sources of all types are subject to error. Primary sources may intentionally or unintentionally misrepresent the facts, and tertiary sources may be entirely accurate and reliable. Every source should be\n\n6 / Information Retrieval\n\nBecause most materials are derived from others of the same type, mere agreement is no proof of accuracy. It is necessary to examine and com­ pare sources with care, weighing the reliability of evidence as does the jury in a trial, and being par­ ticularly wary of generalizations and unsupported conjectures. BRAINPICKING\n\nWhat about persons as sources? Questioning an \"expert\" verbally or by correspondence is the best pro­ cedure when the information desired is known by an accessible individual and can be communicated easily. Ex­ perts can often give effective sug­ gestions on reliable sources, good expositions, or individual facts. But consulting persons has severe lim­ itations. Usually they enjoy answer­ ing a question that they can answer easily, but they seldom are willing to look up things for you, to be consulted very often, or to spend much time on your concerns. Moreover, even the most \"expert\" consultant is not infallible, especially in matters peripheral to his interests. Individ­ uals are primary sources on their own opinions, observations, and direct knowledge. On other matters they may be secondary, tertiary, or n-ary. For individual facts, even about themselves, they are often very unreliable. Verbal communica­ tions are usually made with less care than written ones. They are also subject to faulty reception, record­ ing, and remembering. Those who rely on brainpicking should ponder the possibility that their sources may have the same habit! The alleged expert opinion may be hardly more than verbal tradition, hearsay, or rumour, no longer, if ever, corres­ ponding to reality. There are also social reasons for considered sceptically and critically.\n\nnot relying mainly on personal com­ munications. The store of informa­ tion available and the part of it relevant to any particular problem are far too vast to be \"known\" by individuals or to be transmitted verbally. If everyone obtained his information orally, in a generation we should be reduced to the state of knowledge characterizing primitive societies, which had to depend on individual memory and verbal com­ munication. Our complex culture, especially its technological and scientific base, requires a social bank of information from which in­ dividuals may retrieve information. The invention of writing first made this possible, and improvements, such as printing and electronic information processing, have simply increased capacity and accessibility. Verbal communication is as vigorous as ever, of course, but without interaction with recorded knowledge it soon becomes an exchange of mis­ information. TOPICS It seems obvious that one must choose a topic before beginning work, but it is equally true that one should consider a set of related topics and modify it as the study progresses. A little thought at the start and continued alertness will pay. Consider synonyms (including different names of persons, obsolete terms, near synonyms), antonyms, subtopics, related topics (including persons, mathematical and non-mathe­ matical topics), and topics related to the mathematical, scientific, and social environment (including organ­ izations, institutions, places, and general history of the times). A glance through the topics in Part II may be suggestive.\n\n7 / Information Retrieval\n\nREFERENCE MATERIALS\n\nFew realize the enormous amount of information available in the refer­ ence departments of libraries. Often one can quickly acquire all the in­ formation needed for a specific purpose by consulting the reference shelves. For anyone making more than superficial investigations it is worth while to become quite familiar with the reference collection of the library he is using. A \"walk through\" the entire collection, careful exam­ ination of the catalogue or other guides, and discussion with the staff librarians will lay the basis for a never-ending increase in one's ability to find information. Selected reference sources are listed in Part II, Chapters 1, 4, and 5, but one should take advantage of whatever is available in the li­ brary he is using. It would be im­ possible (and tiresome if it were possible) to describe the many skills of a craft that can be learned only by practice, but below are a few comments on particular types of reference materials. We describe sources in a system­ atic order, but it is not suggested that the investigator make a thor­ ough search in each category before going on to the next. As suggested in Figure 1, he should cycle back and forth among different sources from tertiary to primary, with em­ phasis on the latter in proportion to the seriousness and depth of his purpose. To avoid difficulties later it is essential to keep good records from the beginning of an investigation, including precise information on the source of each note. This is dis­ cussed in detail in Chapter 2. General Dictionaries. ·oiction­ aries should be consulted as a first step. Recent editions of the una­ bridged Webster's International and\n\nthe Random House are fairly up to date. The great Oxford English Dic­ tionary contains much historical information. Do not overlook older dictionaries and those in foreign languages. Biographic Dictionaries. For living mathematicians consult Amer­\n\nican Men of Science, Who's Who in America, and similar publications\n\n8 / Information Retrieval\n\nhistorians have contributed. Several older encyclopaedias are excellent, such as the Penny Cyclopaedia (18331843) for which De Morgan wrote the mathematics and mathematical biog­ raphy. Always consult the index of the encyclopaedia you are using.\n\n(See Part II, Chapter 5.)\n\nMathematical Encyclopaedias.\n\nThere is at this writing no encyclo­ paedia of mathematics in English, in other countries.

In 1930, a second abstracting journal (Zentralblatt der Mathematik) was founded. It in­ tended to publish abstracts as quickly as they were received with­ out trying to cover the publications of a single year in one volume. In practice this speeded things up less than expected. Because of Nazi in­ terference, these abstracting jour­ nals became less useful during the thirties, and the Mathematical Re­ views was founded in 1940. This is now the most useful abstracting journal for English-speaking people. The Russian Referativni Zhurnal founded in 1935 is also good. The Revue Semestrielle, founded in 1893 and merged with the Zentralblatt in 1934, duplicated the Jahrbuch for the most part, but listed book re­ views as well as books and articles. There is also a French abstracting service called the Bulletin Signal­ etique. All these abstracting jour­ nals arrange abstracts by subjects and are partially indexed by author and subject. Browsing through them can be very rewarding. They all have separate sections on history. Author indexes are included in each volume, and Mathematical Reviews has cumula­ tive author indexes. These are ex­ cellent sources for a person's bib­ liography. Newspaper Indexes. With the ap­ proximate date of death of an indi­ vidual, you' may be able to find an obituary through the indexes of the New York Times or the London Times, or by searching in local papers.\n\n9 I Information Retrieval bibliographies of bibliographies. (See Part II, Chapter 5.) Usually each country has one or more biblio­ graphic services, such as Books in Print and the Cumulative Book Index, which record information on all books published. Serial Guides. There are several very fine guides (e.g. The Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature),\n\nwhich index current journal articles by author, title, and subject (with cross-references). They do not cover technical mathematical publications but may often lead to useful bio­ graphical papers, popularizations, philosophical discussions, and so on, that are not usually covered by the mathematical abstracting serv­ ices. Science Citation Index. This is an important new source. Under each article are listed all those articles that cite the article. Thus from an article on a topic one can locate later articles on related topics. Serial Directories. You will soon find that one of the vexing problems in historical research is identifying journals and locating libraries that hold them. The dif­ ficulty arises from the insufficient or inaccurate information given by authors, the many variations in names of the same journal, and the nasty habit of translating journal titles. Get acquainted with the Union List of Serials and other directories. Historical Treatises. General histories and treatises on particu­ lar periods or topics often supply a surprising amount of information in Indexes of Individual Journals. historical context (use the index!). Consult the annual and general in­ However, keep in mind that the in­ dexes of individual periodicals. formation may be misinformation. Sometimes these are classified by Record sources and check with other subject (for example, the long-run indexes to the American Mathematical and more direct sources. Reference Librarians.

There are many these professionals are trained to specialized bibliographies and even\n\nhelp the searcher by answering in­ quiries, by assisting in information retrieval, and even by carrying out searches themselves on the user's behalf. Examples of appropriate questions to ask a reference librarian are: Where is the guide (catalogue, floor plan) of the reference collection? Where can I find a directory of manuscript collections? I need to know the year and place of publica­ tion of this book but I cannot find it anywhere; can you help me? I can­ not identify this journal; can you help me? Can you suggest how I might get started to find some information on ___ ? Of course, one should not impose unduly on a reference librarian's time, but assisting with information retrieval is their work, not a dis­ traction. Usually they are glad to take up a challenging problem. SECONDARY SOURCES From reference sources (including Part II of this guide) you will have constructed a bibliography of sec­ ondary sources. Read these critical­ ly for chronology, possible inter­ pretations, and indications of the most important primary sources. Note which are derivative from other secondary sources and which are based on direct knowledge of primary sources. Distinguish facts from in­ ferences and speculations. If you can find a carefully written and comprehensive monograph or paper on the topic of your interest, your task may be limited to examining it critically and bringing it up to date. But this will seldom happen. Surprisingly little satisfactory work has been done. In addition to titles listed in bibliographies, you may find addi­ tional materials in older reference\n\n10 / Information Retrieval\n\nworks, in mathematical treatises (the best of which have historical and bibliographical sections, com­ ments, or notes), and in publications relating to a particular person (lo­ cal newspapers, school publications, institutional histories, commemora­ tive volumes, biographies of asso­ ciates and relatives, etc.). Look for obituaries. Often a man will move in several circles, and valuable information about him may be found in publications ordinarily unrelated to mathematics or the history of science. Random search (\"browsing\") in journals and books may be expected to produce unexpectedly useful in­ formation, perhaps because the world is really rather small and highly interrelated. PRIMARY SOURCES Useful and essential as secondary and reference sources are, it is the primary sources that offer the greatest joy and profit to the in­ vestigator. Here and here alone is the original source of reliable in­ formation on what actually happened-. -For a person, the most important sources are his own writings. Col­ lected works, translations, and edited versions may be convenient, but they are often incomplete or unfaithful to the originals. Similar­ ly, published letters may be expur­ gated, and volumes of correspondence may be incomplete. Primary sources must be examined as critically as all others. If possible, one should\n\ngo direct to the first editions, manuscripts, notebooks, diaries, personal possessions (especially books in which notes may have been made), artifacts (inventions, in­ struments, equipment), mementos, monuments, etc. In recent times, photographs, films, sound tapes, video tapes, etc. should be sought\n\nout. Also important are contemporary records made by other people - biog� raphies, related scientific publica­ tions, criticisms, reviews, commen­ taries, and documents (legal, finan­ cial, political, educational, med­ ical, etc.). How far to go in study­ ing all aspects of the man's envi­ ronment depends on the depth of understanding desired. For a subject, relevant material may be much harder to locate because information is more thoroughly in­ dexed by persons than by topics. Most important are publications and other records of communications on the subject. An idea becomes part of history only when it is communicated. It may be necessary to search ex­ tensively. Skimming entire journal files and library collections will turn out to be more feasible and rewarding than the tyro imagines. Often one can centre the study on the greatest contributors, but this distorts the story by underestima­ ting the role played by many \"unim­ portant\" and little-known partici­ pants. Each project is different. When the easily available library re­ sources have been exploited, the researcher must depend on his imagination, ingenuity, and per­ severance. For example, he may track down elusive documents, interview principals or witnesses (producing the \"oral history\" on sound-tracks), or search for evidence in unexpected places. Such detective work is fascinating in itself and has many fringe benefits. OBTAINING MATERIALS Even the greatest libraries do not have everything, and it is surpris­ ing how soon a thorough investiga­ tion will exhaust local resources. But this need not discourage the\n\n11 / Information Retrieval patient investigator. Through inter­ library loan or purchase of a photo­ copy, microfilm, or microfiche almost anything in any library or archive in the world can be obtained, pro­ vided it can be identified and located. (The italicized condition is a prime reason for recording com­ plete, accurate information and the sources of information. Librarians\n\ndo not care for wild goose chases and want to be sure the item you request really exists!) Fortunately for the travel-loving scholar there are always exceptions - items too rare to risk possible damage by copy­ ing, items in private hands, col­ lections that are uncatalogued and too large to be copied in their entirety, etc. Usually, however, it is better to move copies of materials to one's place of work than it is to move oneself about. Here is where the reference librarian is invaluable. The essential thing is to supply full information and to be patient_. It may take the library staff a very long time, involving much correspon­ dence, to locate and secure an item. For this reason one should plan ahead and order needed items as soon as one knows of them, without wait­ ing until they are to be used immedi­ ately. Sometimes materials can be secured directly through colleagues, who may be able to buy, lend, or copy an item. Often archivists, li­ brarians, or individuals will be extraordinarily helpful if one shows serious interest in a matter that is valued by them. Correspondence may save a trip or make one more profit­ able.\n\n2\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION STORAGE\n\nAlmost all the contents of the world's libraries and archives are available to one who knows how to ask, as was suggested in the last chapter. Thanks to modern transport and copying meth­ ods one ,can visit, borrow by inter­ library loan, or get photocopies or microfilms·. Automated storage and re­ trieval systems will undoubtedly in­ crease the efficiency and universality of access still further� But this in no way decreases the importance of the individual's personal store of infor­ mation with content and arrangement suited to his own needs.\n\nMEMORY The centre of any personal information storage system is one's own memory, but it is foolish to rely on it too much. Human memories are very un� reliable, and they have the dangerous habit of being often most certain of their least reliable contents. More­ over, the mind is used to manipulate information as well as to store it, and there is some evidence that too much remembering inhibits thinking. The whole point of a personal infor­ mation storage system is to minimize the use of one's own mind for storage and routine handling of information so as to free it for functions not effectively performed by books, notes files, instruments, computers, and other devices. The individual who develops his own system of work along these lines will be following the historical pattern of communications technology, which tends to transform the intellectual worker from one who knows into one who knows how.\n\nBOOKS A personal working library (I am not concerned here with collections for autotelic or commercial purposes) may\n\nconsist of a single book (which should be a dictionary!) or a collection re­ quiring the services of a librarian. If not adapted to the individual's needs it can be a burden. When care­ fully selected and organized as part of a system, it can be a powerful tool. The essential thing is to choose only books that are frequently used for reference or intensively studied over a long period of time. Do not try to duplicate institutional libraries. Instead, supplement your own library by a shifting collection of borrowings from them. Constantly weed your library of books that are no longer appropriate. Of every book, ask whether it would not be better to borrow it from a library when needed. If the book is rare and unavailable in libraries, you may find it better to place it in a library - to make it more accessible to others and also to save yourself the responsibility of caring for it. How should a personal library be arranged? According to the whim of the owner, and in no other way! Like tools on a work-bench, books should be arranged according to convenience (usually frequency of usage) and not rigidly according to any logical schema. However, any collection that is very large had better be arranged in some systematic way if the owner does not wish to waste time searching or find himself buying or going to the library for a book \"lost\" on his own shelves! There is much to be said for straight alphabetical arrange­ ment by author. Any subject matter schema fails to fit realities, gets out of date, and is ambiguous. In any case, a good library, like a good garden, requires constant cultivation, weeding, and replenishing. EXCERPTS Parts of books or journals in the form of reprints, photocopies, or\n\n13 / Personal Information Storage\n\ntear sheets are essential. The pub­ lications from which they come would be too bulky to keep and too expen­ sive to own. Excerpts can be collec­ ted and kept conveniently at hand while working on a topic, whereas the corresponding complete volumes would· be physically unmanageable. But these materials can become just a pile of waste paper unless they are selected, stored systematically, and weeded. For short-run purposes, col­ lections by subject matter do well. In the long run, it is better to file strictly by author in filing cabinets and to have a catalogue by authors (and subjects if required) on 3 by 5 inch slips according to standard li­ brary practices. This catalogue may be incorporated into the general file of slips to be described below, provided the slips for material owned have some special code. Photocopying devices now make it feasible to incorporate in one's own files far more excerpt material than was possible when copying had to be done by hand. Many people have not yet fully adjusted to these possi­ bilities and still copy by hand or paraphrase passages from books. If a book contains a passage that is wanted for later reference, make and file a photocopy. It will be much easier to retrieve than the book it­ self and more accurate than any note you could make by hand. Be sure to write on the photocopy full descrip­ tive information, or else attach a\n\nphotocopy of the title-page and other pages required for complete identi­ cation. In addition, write code words that identify the file location. For example, for filing by author (the most trouble-free system), a code such as \"Smith 1928 abacus\" will serve to indicate that it is to be filed under Smith and then by date 1928, the subject code serving for further identification.\n\n14 / Personal Information Storage published posthumously, and his fa­ mous journal did not come to light until 50 years after his death.

Gauss is an extreme case. Most of what he wrote has been lectures of others, preliminary edi-\n\nMANUSCRIPTS\n\n15 / Personal Information Storage tions for local use, etc. He should keep photographs, sound recordings, apparatus, and mementos that throw light on the course of an investi­ gation, the environment in which it took place, the organizations in­ volved, etc. Of course, not everything is worth preserving. But the mathematician should keep in mind that future gen­ erations will be interested in math­ ematicians as well as in their fin­ ished work, and that muc� of what is familiar to all of us will be unknown in the future unless some record of it is preserved. Not only historians of mathematics, but also a very wide scientific and lay public, are as in­ terested in the origin and develop­ ment of a mathematical theory as they are in specific mathematical results. Scholars generally are concerned with the whole range of mathematics as a component of civilization, and \"per­ sonal\" details of the lives of mathe­ maticians frequently are of scientif­ ic and historical, as well as human interest. We live in a period of rapid change in mathematics itself and in the many activities that make up the mathemat­ ical enterprise and its relations with other aspects of culture. Many of these changes will be of the greatest interest to future genera­ tions. Organizations should take care to preserve their own records and to arrange for their deposit and permanent accessibility. This ap­ plies especially to the many curric­ ular reform groups, committees, and research groups whose records, memo­ randa, bulletins, and draft publica­ tions will be of the greatest inter­ est to historians of the future and will enable them to understand events that today are familiar to all of us, but which may well appear quite mys­ terious some years from now. It does little good for the mathe­ matician to keep his papers unless\n\nhe makes provision for their proper handling after his death. The best time to do this is in advance, by arranging for the deposit of papers in a library or other institution. In any case the mathematician should make provision in his will for materials that have not previously been pro­ vided for. The families of mathematicians of­ ten play a key role in preserving docu­ ments. The best procedure for the lay­ man is to consult mathematicians, his­ torians of science, librarians, and archivists who can give advice based on knowledge of the materials and the means for preserving them. An important responsibility rests also on departments of mathematics and mathematical organizations. They should establish their own archives which can serve as sources for the future historian. They should also see to it that the papers of deceased colleagues are not ignored until too late. Where should materials be deposited? A natural place to consider first is an institution with which the mathe­ matician has been associated. For example, government employees may approach the National Archives or the Library of Congress. Professors may find their own institutions appropri­ ate, provided the library has an in­ terest and adequate facilities. Of­ ten local museums, academies, or his­ torical societies have archives. Many universities systematically collect materials on the history of science. Some private organizations, such as the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, the Niels Bohr Library of the American Institute of Physics and the New York Public Library, col­ lect documents. A good source of in­ formation on depositories is A Guide to Archives and Manuscripts in the United States, by P. M. Hamer (Yale Univer·sity Press, 1961). It happens sometimes that prompt\n\n16 / Personal Information Storage\n\nunusable or irretrievable. Even more often notes are made to no purpose at all. Most notes serve only to impress ideas on the memory and are never again consulted. Yet properly made notes can enormously enhance the ef­ fectiveness or research activity. By \"properly made notes\" I mean simply those that are made with a definite purpose and so as to meet this purpose effectively. First of all one should not attempt to duplicate material by taking notes. Handwritten copies, detailed abstracts, or digests are less reliable than the original. When used as the basis for writing they may encourage the illu­ sion of originality without helping the researcher to create his own syn­ thesis. If one composes directly from such notes or from other people's writing without absorbing the ideas, he is simply \"cutting and pasting\" his own paraphrases of other people's expositions, often without being clear as to his sources. The result is hack work at best, plagiarism at worst. Such methods are reflected in the witticism: \"To copy from one source is plagiarism; to copy from three is research.\" The most common kind of note-taking arises from the habit, originating in school-days, of taking notes on lec­ tures. Where the lecture represents a contribution not to be found in print, notes may be valuable or in­ dispensable, but most such notes are NOTES poor records of material that appears Personal notes should be valuable and more clearly and completely in print. Notes on lectures should be confined useful records of information pecul­ iar to the individual's needs. Yet to general outlines plus a record of specific items of information or opin­ much scholarly effort is wasted through the failure to make good ion that appear to be important or Sometimes an important item notes. unique. But most students acquire the habit of \"taking down\" what the (an idea, calculation, observation, teacher says, in part exactly and in citation) is not recorded and for­ gotten before it can be used. More part paraphrased. The practice has been obsolete since the invention of commonly, a note is made so badly (incompletely, illegibly) or is so printing. It becomes quite absurd when carried over from a lecture to poorly stored and indexed that it is\n\nsteps to preserve archival materials are not taken because the task of arranging and sorting appears formi­ dable. Actually this task should be done by experts in any case. The best procedure for the possessor of a collection is to consult the insti­ tution where the materials may be preserved and to encourage its staff to do the work. Arbitrary removal of materials, editing or rearrange­ ment can be very damaging. Materials that are appropriately deposited will be properly organized and catalogued. Listing in The National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections, published by the Library of Congress, will make them available to scholars. The do­ nor can, of course, place limita­ tions on use in terms of time and circumstance, but restrictions are awkward to administer and should be kept to a minimum. To sum up, we ask all those who are in possession of archival mate­ rials in mathematics to arrange for their proper preservation so that our mathematical work will be firmly linked both to the past and to the future. Members of the Advisory Committee would be glad to advise and assist in placing collections and would welcome information about mate­ rials not yet listed in the National Union Catalogue.\n\nprinted matter. Nevertheless, when gathering material for a talk or pa­ per, students often take notes that are merely diluted versions of the originals. From such notes on sev­ eral sources they work toward what they imagine is their own product, but which is actually a hodge-podge whose sources are unclear to them­ selves. If it is harmful to use notes as a substitute for the original or as an intermediate stage in the hidden copying of other people's ideas, it does not follow that note-taking is useless. Quite the contrary. Among the highly useful kinds of notes are: (1) records of one's own obser­ vations, calculations, conclusions, and plans; (2) abstracts, outlines, and commentaries by yourself of other people's work; and (3) records of \"hard facts\" (bibliographic, his­ torical, mathematical) including the facts that certain people hold cer­ tain opinions. The best method of handling (3) is the classic 3 by S or S by 8 slip, whose use we consider below. The following general obser­ vations apply to all notes. 1. Do not take notes where the original or photocopy can be used. 2. Label all notes completely as to subject, meaning of notations, source, nature, and date. If there is more than one loose sheet, label each one. 3. Write so that someone else can understand. Later you will be that someone else to whom your own notes may have become meaningless! 4. If notes are not on individual slips filed for quick retrieval, in­ dex each note by making a 3 by S slip. For example, 1f you take notes in bound volumes, number the volumes systematically, number each item within the volume, and file index slips referring to volume and item numbers. A note that cannot be found is\n\n17 / Personal Information Storage waste paper. A note that is not im­ portant enough to record systemati­ cally and to index in some way is not worth keeping. It may still be worth making, of course, for temporary storage of information or to assist in thinking or remembering. Paradoxi­ cally, one often remembers just those items whose recording seems to have made remembering unnecessary! But the original record is still valuable for later checking, since memory is seldom complete or accurate. SLIPS The usefulness of 3 by S slips (and for some purposes 4 by 6 or S by 8) has been established by generations of librarians, bibliographers, his­ torians, and office managers. For files (such as library catalogues) that are heavily used by many people, cards of substantial thickness are needed, but for personal files such cards are wastefully bulky. Thin paper slips are inexpensive, univer­ sally obtainable in convenient pads (usually called memo pads), fit a variety of filing equipment, and are quite strong enough if treated with a little care. The basic feature of the slip, which makes it so useful for inform­ ation storage and retrieval, is that each one contains a separate item of information that can be filed (and refiled!) for efficient retrieval. If index slips that give the location of materials in other forms are in­ cluded, a file of slips can serve as the main personal information store and as the index to all other deposits in which the individual is interested. Each individual's system should be adapted to his own needs, but the following general guide-lines apply to all systems: (1) In terms of your needs, decide on definite procedures\n\n18 / Personal Information Storage and modify them as your needs change. (2) Work through your files periodi­ cally, weeding and rearranging. (3) Record only one item on each slip. (One item may be defined as a message that cannot be split without being incomplete, e.g., the full biblio­ graphic description of a publication, the definition of a word, or a per­ son's name and address. Of course, the meaning of \"complete\" depends on the purpose.) (4) For each slip decide on a key word (or words) under which it will be filed. This (these) shoufd be the word(s) under which you are most likely to think of look­ ing for it. File one slip for each key word used, each with the complete message, or (more often) a master slip and other slips referring to it. Do not be concerned at inevitable variations in your choices, since when you come to recover slips you will also try various key words and achieve uniformity if you wish. ( 5 ) Be explicit, clear, complete, and legible. If you use abbreviations, make slips for them! Where a personal information sys­ tem is very large and subject to fre­ quent manipulation, it may be advis­ able to consider automation, and especially the use of computer filing, manipulation, and storage. However, before information can be fed into a computer it must somehow be recorded and coded, so slips or equivalents must be made anyway. For most per­ sonal files, computerization is in­ convenient and expensive. Only where the number of slips is very large (at least of the order of 10 5 ) and sub­ ject to heavy manipulations, long calculations, and constant retrieval is computerization advantageous. Feeding information into a computer memory requires expensive operations (the preparation of cards, tapes, or other hardware), and retrieval re­ quires that the information be in the computer memory for handling (subject\n\nto delay, unless one can afford ar­ rangements for immediate access). In any case, computerization should be viewed as an addition to personal files rather than as a substitute for them. It is hard to imagine a personal information system more convenient than one based on a 3 by 5 memo pad that can be carried everywhere and on a file of slips that can be consulted instantly in order to find the original record. The building of a personal file of slips is a very common practice among scholars. In 1908 one of the most crea­ tive men of the age gave the following advice:\n\nMoreover, procure, in lots of twenty thousand or more, slips of stiff. paper of the size of postcards, made up into pads of fifty or so. Have a pad always about you, and note upon one of them anything worthy of note, the subject being stated at the top and reference being made below to available books or to your own note books. If your mind is active, a day will seldom pass when you do not find a dozen items worth such recording; and at the end of twenty years, the slips having been classified and ar­ ranged and rearranged, from time to time, you will find yourself in pos­ session of an encyclopaedia adapted to your own special wants. It is es­ pecially the small points that are thus to be noted; for the large ideas you will carry in your hea� (From the Collected Papers of Charles Saunders Peirce, edited by C. Hartshorne and\n\nP. Weiss, Harvard University Press, 1933, vol. 4, paragraph 597.) Each person should build his own system. What follows is the descrip­ tion of one that has proved very suitable for research in the history of mathematics. It is based on four types of slips (author-title slips, historical slips, chronology slips, and note slips) to be filed in a sin­ gle alphabetical file under key words.\n\n19 / Personal Information Storage system is described in some detail, Such a file contains records of pub­ lications owned, consulted, or to be not under the illusion that anyone consulted, of dated events, and notes will wish to copy it exactly, but in order to give a specific example. on facts of every description. The Author-title slips These are similar to the familiar cards that appear in library cata­ logues. The individual may wish to omit some of the information that usually appears on library cards\n\nand to add data of interest to him­ self. Typical slips are illustrated below. Uniformity of format is im­ portant for ease of filing and re­ covery.\n\nFigure 2. Author slip for a book\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10.\n\nYear of publication.

They are secondary sources. A publication that is an event in the history of mathematics is not recorded here but on a c-slip described in the following section. Figure 4.\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n\nFor example, an article about a proof by Gauss in 1799 is recorded on an h-slip. The publication in which the proof occurred would be recorded on a c-slip.

However, it may be desir­ able to make notes of various kinds in order to assemble information by topics cutting across time. Such slips are indicated by the letter Figure 11.\n\nFigure 12.\n\n\"n\" following the subject. They may be used to file all sorts of infor­ mation about a subject that you wish to collect by topic rather than by time. They may be filed at random or according to the subtopic. They may be used to index other slips by topics.\n\nNote slip on an alias\n\nNote giving a definition\n\n26 / Personal Information Storage Figure 13.\n\nNotes on subtopics\n\n27 I Personal Information Storage Filing slips A variety of containers are useful for storing and filing slips: ordi­ nary letter envelopes (for blanks, for carrying slips, and for filing a small collection), small boxes holding several hundred slips (for collecting slips on a topic or at a convenient location), large card­ board boxes, filing drawers, and cabinets. Be generous with dividers, which can be made cheaply in a vari­ ety of colours by cutting 3 by 5 cards to 3 by 3 1/2. It pays to in­ sert dividers (alphabetical or chronological) generously so as to\n\nlimit searches to a very small batch of less than 30 cards that can be picked out and riff led with finger or eraser (the best procedure for slips though not for cards). Slips can be filed in many ways, and it matters little as long as some system is adopted. Usually the best is a single alphabetical order by author and topic, with an agreed order for author slips, h-slips, c-slips, and n-slips in the same lo­ cation. But inevitably it will be convenient to have separate special purpose files.\n\n3\n\nHISTORICAL ANALYSIS AND WRITING\n\nHaving discussed the collection of information in Chapter 1 and its storage in Chapter 2, I now come to its utilization to produce history. Of course this division of the dis­ cussion and its order are not in­ tended to correspond to separate, unrelated, and ordered activities. There should be constant interaction between collection, organization, and analysis of information. Before writing or, better yet, before beginning work one should have in mind topics, audiences, places of publication, ends and means. APPROACHES TO HISTORY History has far more facets than can be described here. One can focus on the development of ideas, biography, periods, civilizations, countries, cities, institutions, terms, symbols, topical fields, education, communi­ cation, bibliography, sociology of mathematics, and so on. No one ap­ proach can give a complete picture. Each one and every combination has value. But a choice will help to guide information collection as well as analysis and writing. CHRONOLOGY VERSUS HISTORY Chronology, the time-ordered array of events, is the raw material of history, just as experimental data and observations are the raw mater­ ial of natural science. History arises when chronology is selected, organized, related, and explained. The result may be, and usually is, a coherent descriptive account that attempts no very broad generaliza­ tions, or it may be a theory arising from the description and verifiable (or falsifiable) by further referenc to the record or by comparison of predictions with future experience.\n\n29 To give rules for the production of history is as difficult as to tell someone how to discover a theorem or construct a new proof. It is easier to suggest some things to avoid.\n\nI Historical Analysis\n\nvestigated. In general, a healthy scepticism backed by an analysis of sources of information is essential. PRIORITITIS\n\nIt is soon apparent to the historian that people often do not get the credit they deserve. But it is quix­ otic to try to provide everyone with The historical and mathematical lit­ erature contains many errors. Some his due.

The amateur historian examines a mathematical paper of the past as if its author were taking an examination in math­ ematics today and amuses himself by finding \"errors.\" Often he looks at past events in terms of the extent to which they appear to lead to the mathematics of today, as if that were the final form and criterion by which everything must be judged. Or he may force the ideas of one period into an inappropriate framework of another. Of course, it is important to see how modern ideas originated and de­ veloped, but a full understanding of this development requires consider­ ing things as they were at the time and in terms of conditions of that time. In particular it must be re­\n\nmembered that words mean different things at different times. Failure to take this into account can lead to ludicrous errors. The matter was summed up well by Augustus De Morgan in a letter to Sir William Rowan Hamilton in 1853: \"In reading an old mathematician you will not read his riddle unless you plow his heifer; you must see with his light, if you want to know how much he saw.\" (27 January. Quoted from R. P. Graves, Life of Sir William Rowan Hamilton,\n\nvol. III [Dublin, 1889], p. 438.)\n\nthat consists in simply fabricating an account of how something might have happened (for example, how counting might have first been in­ vented) and then coming to regard this as a fact. Perhaps the most pernicious form of this aberration is the formulation of historical theories based on superficial in­ formation or prejudice and then the \"verification\" of them by making up a suitable historical narrative. THE MATTHEW SYNDROME In the Gospel according to Matthew it is said that to those who already have much, more shall be given, and this seems to be true of the alloca­ tion of fame. The importance, ability, and achievements of well-known fig­ ures are exaggerated due to the fact that their papers and publications are more likely to be preserved, they are more often cited, and interest in them results in publications that create an audience and trigger fur­ ther work. The result is a distorted picture of the history of mathematics as the work of a few \"stars.\" The historian should be on guard against this \"halo effect\" and strive to give a balanced picture that includes \"minor\" as well as \"major\" person­ alities. PLAGIARISM\n\nI close this incomplete catalogue of historical sins with one that is most distasteful to scholars. Pla­ SPECULATIVE HISTORY giarism is ·�opying or imitating the language, ideas, and thoughts of an­ other and passing off the same as It is often necessary, and quite one's original work\" (American Col­ legitimate, to supply missing in­ lege Dictionary [Random House, formation by deduction from estab­ 1959]), i.e., \"to steal or purloin lished facts, or even by plausible inference, if it is labelled as such. and pass off as one's own the ideas, words, artistic production, etc., of But there is a style of \"history\"\n\n31 / Historical Analysis another; to use without due credit the ideas, expressions, or produc­ tions of another\" (Webster's Inter­ national Dictionary, 1947). Clearly the offence involves both theft and fraud. It is to be dis­ tinguished from violations of copy­ right, which involves the improper use of copyrighted material whether or not any misrepresentation is in­ volved. For example, extensive quo­ tation from a copyright book with due credit but without permission, or a pirated printing of an entire book without permission, involves no plagiarism but is an infringement of copyright. There is no danger of copyright violation if the writer gets permission for any extensive quotations and gives credit to his sources, of if he uses his own words. Most plagiarism does not involve copyright questions because it is only the form of presentation that can be copyrighted. Ideas are not subject to the copyright law. Never­ theless, ideas are of the greatest importance to the intellectual com­ munity. The intellectual worker wishes his ideas to spread and to be used by others. He does not want to restrict their use. However, he wishes full credit for what he has done, and this may be of great im­ portance to him professionally and financially. Accordingly, the of­ fence of plagiarism is above all an offence against the intellectual community and a violation of schol­ arly ethics. The offender forfeits the trust of this community and may be very severely penalized by it. Offending students may lose credit or be expelled'. More mature offenders may find their careers cut short, and are certain to lose the respect of their fellow scholars. A careful writer who is genuinely anxious to do his own work, to give full credit to others, to reveal his sources frankly, and to take credit\n\nonly for his own contributions will not be guilty of plagiarism. One who is careless about such matters may commit the offence without intent. The following examples suggest the many possibilities. The most blatant type of plagiar­ ism is the copying of an entire work, substituting the offender's name for that of the true author. In previous centuries there are many examples, but this offence is rather rare now for a published book or paper, be­ cause the size and vigilance of the academic community as well as the copyright laws make it extremely dangerous. Today the offence is more often committed by students who wish to produce a paper in a hurry and who copy one from a printed source or from an old paper written by another student, or who hire a ghost writer. If the original author is agreeable, no theft is involved, but the fraud in this case is no less unethical. One of my students once copied most of an article from the Encyclopedia Britannica without even noticing that I was the author! A rather common type of plagiarism is quotation without quotation marks and acknowledgment. To avoid this, use quotation marks for every quo­ tation, no matter how short, and give the source accurately. Unacknowledged paraphrase is also plagiarism. Common as the practice is, the rewriting of another's work in one's own words without acknowledg­ ment clearly falls within the dic­ tionary definitions given above. To avoid this, accompany a paraphrase by an acknowledgment. This may be done in a footnote or by a phrase such as \"according to __ (with ex­ act reference)\" or \"the following exposition is based on.... \" Such ac­ knowledgment does not relieve the writer of the obligation of using quotation marks when the original author is being quoted.\n\n32 / Historical Analysis Extensive paraphrasing or quota­ tion is seldom justified. An author should base his production on the assimilation of many sources, and he should not have to fall back on what is practically copying, even if he is honest about it. \"Cutting and pasting\" by quotation from several sources, even if they are properly acknowledged, is not to be confused with an original product based on reworking of assimilated material. Equally a case of plagiarism is unacknowledged use of translation.\n\nA translated passage or a paraphrase of one must be treated no different­ ly than the original. The actual source must be given, and the writer must indicate that he is the trans­ lator if that is not evident. Another type of plagiarism is false citation, which usually in­ volves citing a primary source for a quotation or idea when actually the source was a secondary source that cited the primary source! This kind of plagiarism involves both theft and fraud. The writer is making use of the work of the man who wrote the secondary sources without giving him credit. He is also pretending to have consulted the primary source, when in fact he has not done so. In addition to the violation of ethics, this practice is very undesirable be­ cause it perpetuates whatever errors appear in secondary sources. When quoting an author, the exact citation must be given. This cita­ tion should be the source from which the writer actually got the quota­ tion. If he got it from someone else's translation, from an anthol­ ogy, or from another source that quoted the original source, this must be indicated by a footnote of the type \"Quoted from... , page....\" A more subtle form of plagiarism is failure to acknowledge the actual source of an idea. This may appear as a judgment stated as if it were\n\nbased on one's own research when actually it is taken from a secondary source. Such a misdemeanour may be avoided by including a phrase such as \"Smith concludes that...\" together with an exact reference. Another common device is to say at the be­ ginning of a portion of the manu­ script something like \"The following conclusions are due to...\" and then give the precise reference in a foot­ note. Bibliographies serve both to in­ dicate sources and to suggest possi­ ble additional titles of interest to the reader. The writer should make sure that his bibliography does not confuse these two functions. He may give a single list with indication of which sources have been consulted. He may list a reference with a nota­ tion that \"this source was not con­ sulted.\" The essential thing is not\n\nto give a false impression of the materials that have actually been used.\n\nIn order to avoid these and other kinds of plagiarism, the author may ask himself: \"ls what I have just written my own idea, or did I get it from elsewhere?\" In almost every case the idea comes from another source. If it is a matter of general know­ ledge obtainable in many sources, there is no need to give a specific source. The reader will understand that no claim for originality is being made. If the matter is one on which there may be some doubt or disagreement, or if the idea is ap­ parently new, the actual source used by the writer must be indicated.\n\nThis discussion makes obvious the importance of taking notes and of recording the source of every note that is taken. Moreover, notes shoul indicate whether a listed source has actually been consulted directly. Quotations should be distinguished from paraphrase. Unless such careful records are made, it is impossible\n\n33 / Historical Analysis for the author to present an honest and accurate picture of his work and results.\n\nPLANNING A PAPER Planning a paper involves choosing a topic, approach, style, and format. One should think about these matters over a period of time and while do­ ing other things. One should revise one's plans while conducting re­ search. Make outlines and possibly draft sample passages (e.g., an in­ troduction), but do not begin the writing too soon. It is easier to change ideas in your head than on paper! If you are working systemat­ ically, much of the organizing work will be done automatically. You will have an ordered collection of slips giving sources, chronologies, and notes. How should you present your mater­ ial? Consider various possibilities. Dream about the topic and your audi­ ence. Ask such questions as: In this material what ideas, patterns, facts are of interest to my audience to­ day? Or ought to be of interest? What light does this information throw on the development of mathematics and its state today? How is this matter related to other events of the time, to the development of science, to general social and political history? What do I find most interesting? What will my audience find most in­ teresting? How would I tell a friend about it? Do I have a thesis or the­ ses that I wish to assert and sup­ port? Do I have the evidence to back my hunches? What are the main ideas I wish to communicate? If you don't have some satisfying answers to these or similar questions, withhold your pen! Population control is needed also in this area.\n\nWRITING Outline in your head or on paper. Think before you write, imagine what you are going to write, and write. As you write, document or other­ wise justify every claim. The extent to which you will include footnotes giving sources will depend on the nature of your writing and its place of publication, but you must possess a source or argument for every state­ ment. In mathematics, rigor means precise proof from explicit axioms and definitions according to explicit methods (or the citation of such proofs). In history, rigor means documentation of every claim or its establishment by argument from docu­ mented facts. You should write noth­ ing that cannot be so justified, even though you may refrain from complete documentation or argument in a popularization or other work where it is not expected. You should always give some indication of your sources and be prepared to give com­ plete documentation if it is request­ ed. One who fails to have proper documentation is comparable to an experimental scientist who claims certain results without giving suf­ ficient information to enable another scientist to retrace his steps and without keeping the records on which his results are based. When you have finished the first draft of your paper, reconsider ev­ erything, let it rest for a time, and show it to colleagues. Then be ready to rewrite, many times if re­ quired. Is what you have written going to be clear to your audience? Could it be cut without loss of con­ tent? Consider the writing really finished only when you feel that all that can be done now has been done. Then be ready to revise again when referees and editors report on it. Many writers revise a manuscript a half dozen times or more, and too\n\n34 / Historical Analysis many publications would have bene­ fitted from several revisions. The discussion above has stressed revision. It is hard to imagine any paper that could not be improved. Still the striving for perfection can become a fault. The scholarly paper or book is supposed to be a contribution to an ongoing social process of collective research. It can never be the final word. The\n\nauthor should work only until he has a worthy contribution that fulfills limited objectives. Extraneous ideas should be put aside for inclusion in a later publication. When a compro­ mise has been reached between unat­ tainable perfection and inexcusable carelessness, the time has come to send off the package and turn to other projects.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe following bibliography is a first rough approximation to a com­ plete bibliography of published writings on the history, biography, and bibliography of mathematics. It is directed toward historians and mathematicians and focuses on util­ ity for information retrieval rather than on matters of antiquarian in­ terest. COVERAGE AND SOURCES The main sources are the Jahrbuch ueber die Fortschritte der Mathematik (1868-1940), Revue Semestrielle des Publications Mathematiques (18931932), Zentralblatt der Mathematik und ihre Grenzgebiete (1930-1965), Mathematical Reviews (1940-1966), Isis Bibliographies (1913-1966), and Cecil B. Read's bibliography cover­ ing seven expository mathematical journals to 1965 (in School Science and Mathematics, 66 [1966], 147-179). Other sources are numerous spe­ cial bibliographies, indexes of mathematical journals, historical treatises by M. Cantor, H. Wieleit­ ner, F. Cajori, etc., encyclopaedia articles, guides to the literature by G. Sarton, G. Loria, N. G. Parke, J. E. Pemberton, G. A. Miller, F. Mueller, etc., and hundreds of other books and papers. The following have been deliber­ ately excluded, except in a few cases of unusual merit or lack of other sources: 1. Articles within reference works. (But reference works are list­ ed in Chapters 1 and 5.) 2. Collected and selected works, and articles within them.\n\n3. Chapters and parts of general historical treatises. (But treatises are listed in Chapter 4.) 4. Translations, revisions, and reprints other than the major ones. 5. Ephemeral materials that are effectively unavailable. These in­ clude many theses and \"Program\" pub­ lications of German gymnasia, sepa­ rate reprints of journal articles, privately published and circulated materials, manuscripts, publications not available in major libraries, and unidentifiable items. The first four categories are valuable parts of the literature and should be consulted in any investi­ gation. They are excluded here be­ cause they can be located so easily. The last would have led the user of this guide to many a wild goose chase of the kind I have \"enjoyed\" during the last few years. In a few cases titles have turned out to be antici­ pations never actually published. In others, information given was insuf­ ficient to locate the item through diligent search by reference librar­ ians at several libraries and corre­ spondence with scholars familiar with the field, or else such a search established that the publication was practically inaccessible (e.g., not available even in central libraries of its country of origin!) and not of sufficient importance to justify the trouble of obtaining a copy. I have not attempted to decide whether an item is or is not rele­ vant to mathematics. A topic is in­ cluded if titles about it are cited in mathematical sources. Similarly, I have not excluded titles because of judgrnents of quality. \"Unimpor­ tant\" writings are sometimes useful,\n\n38 / Introduction and works of low quality are part of ceded by an introduction containing the historiographic record. information helpful to the user.

It is pos­ sible to do this kind of work very quickly for a few hours a day, but with full-time effort the hourly output drops sharply. The cost fig­ ures do not include the visible and hidden overhead for space, facili­ ties, supplies, equipment, and so on. If these were added, the total cost would probably reach about 75� plus author's time per entry. For the whole bibliography this leads to a substantial total of about $23,000 plus about 620 hours of author's time, but this cost is quite low compared to the professional time that will be saved in the future. The possibility of using compu­ ters was considered several times. But all the work we did up to the final typing of the manuscript would have been required in order to pre­ pare copy to be keyboarded into the computer, and the cost of keyboard­ ing would have been about the same as that of typing and proofreading the manuscript. In short, the cost of getting our information into the computer would have been about the same as the cost of the project.\n\nPerhaps in a much larger project, in which full-time workers keyboarded information direct from sources into a computer programmed to do all in­ dexing, identification, sorting, checking, and editing, much of the work we did might be automated, but at present such an approach is of greater interest to experimental computer scientists than to those wishing to do a job of this kind cheaply. Of course, this bibliogra­ phy and serial list offer part of the information needed to construct an automated procedure. CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS There are severe limitations to what can be done by one person, even with plentiful assistance, in one loca­ tion. If this bibliography is to be improved substantially, it will be by the collaboration of others. I appeal to all readers to call atten­ tion to errors, omissions, further sources, and so on. Please give complete information (redundancy is helpful) and supply reprints, photo­ copies of title pages, etc., if pos­ sible. All help will be acknowledged gratefully.\n\n1\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nThis chapter contains systematic clas­ sifications in the first four sections, the remainder of the chapter being ar­ ranged alphabetically by name. Where an individual has several names, we have chosen the most famil­ iar one. Modern German names involv­ ing \"von\" are alphabetized under the name following the \"von,\" but where the individual has anglicized his name and included \"Von\" as part of it, al­ phabetization follows this usage. Sim­ ilar remarks apply to \"de\" and \"De,\" but Dutch names are alphabetized under \"Van.\" Medieval names such as Robert of England (and similar forms involv­ ing equivalents of \"of\" in other lan­ guages) are alphabetized under the preceding name, since the place name is not a family name. The criterion for inclusion of a person is simply that biographical material about him has appeared in the literature of mathematics or his­ tory of mathematics. The number of titles on an individual is not my decision. In some cases, worthy math­ ematicians (e.g. Frobenius) have been given little or no biographical no­ tice. In many others, quite minor figures in the development of mathe­ matics have received attention for a variety of reasons. I do not attempt complete coverage of individuals whose main fields are non-mathematical, but exclude titles not of mathematical in­ terest. The reader is reminded that the best initial source for biographical information is usually a reference work.
