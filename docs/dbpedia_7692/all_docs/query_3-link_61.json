        "text": "Introduction\n\nMathematics has always been a fundamental component of human thought and culture, and the growth of technology in recent times has further increased its importance. UNC–Chapel Hill offers several degrees in mathematics and the mathematical sciences, providing students a choice of careers in this field. Among the jobs in industry, government, and the academic world that involve mathematics are actuary, data analyst, modeler, optimizer, statistician, and computer analyst.\n\nThe UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST) Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate mathematics (and science) majors interested in teaching middle and high school mathematics the opportunity to earn their degree and obtain licensure as a North Carolina middle and high school teacher in four years. For more details, visit the School of Education website.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor assigned in ConnectCarolina. Students should regularly meet with their advisors and review their Tar Heel Trackers to be sure that they are satisfying distribution and degree requirements. In addition, drop in advising is available each semester in the math department. Students who have declared a math major and have completed MATH 233 are required to attend a math department advising session to discuss course selections and any other questions before a hold on registration is lifted. The department’s director of undergraduate studies and manager of student services (see contact tab above) are also available by appointment. Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s website.\n\nPlacement into Mathematics Courses\n\nStandardized test scores such as the Advanced Placement (AP) or the American College Test (ACT) or Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) can be used for placement into mathematics courses. Students who do not have placement scores via the AP, ACT or SAT may take the department's ALEKS Placement Test. Please visit the placement page of the department’s website for specific information regarding placement and departmental placement tests.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities"
