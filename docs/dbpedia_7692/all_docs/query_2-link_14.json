        "text": "The celebrated and famous Weierstrass approximation theorem characterizes the set of continuous functions on a compact interval via uniform approximation by algebraic polynomials. This theorem is the first significant result in Approximation Theory of one real variable and plays a key role in the development of General Approximation Theory. Our aim is to investigate some new results relative to such theorem, to present a history of the subject, and to introduce some open problems.\n\nThis manuscript presents shortly the results obtained by participants of the scientific seminar which is held more than twenty years under leadership of the author at Donetsk University. In the list of references main publications are given. These results are published in serious scientific journals and reported at various conferences, including international ones at Moscow,ICM66; Kaluga,1975; Kiev,1983; Haifa,1994; Z\\&quot;urich,ICM94; Moscow,1995. The area of investigation is the Fourier analysis and the theory of approximation of functions. Used are methods of classical analysis including special functions, Banach spaces, etc., of harmonic analysis in finitedimensional Euclidean space, of Diophantine analysis, of random choice, etc. The results due to the author and active participants of the seminar, namely E. S. Belinskii, O. I. Kuznetsova, E. R. Liflyand, Yu. L. Nosenko, V. A. Glukhov, V. P. Zastavny, Val. V. Volchkov, V. O. Leontyev, and others, are given. Besides the partici...\n\nTwo elementary proofs of Weierstrass approximation theorem, respective of Stone-Weierstrass theorem are given. The paper is based on the previous papers [2] and [4]. Besides some simplifications of the proofs given in these two papers, the author also obtained two new results: Theorem 1 and Corollary 3. Mathematics Subject Classifications: 41A10."
