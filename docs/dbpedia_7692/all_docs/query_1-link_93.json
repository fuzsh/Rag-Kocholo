The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that takes the value 1 with probability p and the value 0 with probability 1-p. It models experiments with two possible outcomes, like the outcome of a single coin toss. The probability mass function of the Bernoulli distribution is f(k; p) = pk(1-p)(1-k). The expected value is p and the variance is p(1-p). The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution and is a member of the exponential family.",
