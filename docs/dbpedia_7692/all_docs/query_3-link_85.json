        "text": "Adolf Hurwitz was born in Hildesheim in 1859. Fascinated by the work of the mathematician Felix Klein, he began his mathematical studies at the Technische Hochschule München in 1877. For three semesters he attended the seminars of Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker in Berlin. Afterwards, he began an active personal exchange with Klein, whom he followed to Leipzig in 1880.\n\nAfter attaining his habilitation in Göttingen, Hurwitz was appointed Professor at Königsberg in 1884. There he developed a lifelong friendship with his younger colleagues David Hilbert and Hermann Minkowski. In 1892 Hurwitz was called to take up a professorship at the Eidgenössische Polytechnikum in Zürich, where he remained for 27 years until his death in 1919.\n\nAdolf Hurwitz was a brilliant researcher and one of the most outstanding and successful mathematical teachers of his time. To the present day, he remains a role model for many – both as a person and as a teacher.\n\nIn 1881, he attached the following CV to his dissertation \"Grundlagen einer independenten Theorie der elliptischen Modulfunktionen\"."
