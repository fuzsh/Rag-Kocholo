Advisor Tree (back to the 19th century) || Dissertations directories (contain additional information)

The advisor tree exists in more complete form in the Mathematics Genealogy Project. There are famous mathematicians in our academic ancestry:

David Hilbert (1885) - Erhard Schmidt (1905) - Heinz Hopf (1925) - Ernst Specker, my 2. advisor (1949) - Karl Lieberherr (1977).

Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1799) - Christoph Gudermann (1841) - Karl Weierstrass (1854) - Georg Frobenius (1870) - Edmund Landau (1899) - Paul Bernays (1912) - Erwin Engeler, my advisor (1958) - Karl Lieberherr (1977).

The first three students are Princeton University PhDs.
