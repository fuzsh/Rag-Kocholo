Of course in reality there are many books that do not weigh what an \"average book\" weighs so there are times when we need to requote shipping, just as there are times when we are in position to refund some of the shipping. Please rest assured we try to get your order to you for a reasonable price, as quickly and as well packed (we carefully pack all of our parcels in book boxes) as possible."
