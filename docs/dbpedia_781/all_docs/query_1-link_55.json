        "text": "I wanted to do a map based on Germany gaining occult powers, and also was influenced by TNO. This is the result.\n\nHimmlers Dead Men: The Greater German Reich in 1960\n\nThe PoD is Hitler dies before Operation Barbarossa, Barbarossa goes slightly slower than OTL but Himmlers studies in the occult yield results. He resurrects Hitler and nearly a million German soldiers through one of the largest rituals of all time. Zombie Hitler and the Dead SS are able to make Russia capitulate and make Reichskommissariat in Russia. Three years later, Himmler teleports the Dead SS (using another gigantic ritual) from Brittany to London. The surrounded British surrender and the UK becomes a Reichskommissariat.\n\nAfterwards, the majority of Europe was under Germany. Ulster, seeing a bad future ahead seceded from the UK and joined Ireland as an autonomous territory. Scotland is a major hotbed for rebellion, and the entirety of the UK is near ungovernable even with genocide.\n\nIn France, the Free French were massacred, while collaborators were rewarded. The Free French have been practically wiped out, with only the colonial Free French remaining to continue the resistance\n\nThe Balkans were split between Italy and Germany, with Italy researching how to harness the power of God,successfully turning Vatican City into a holy weapon that protected the entirety of the greater Italian sphere. Mussolini began reforms and made the country more religious as faith was the fuel for the Vatican. Italy is leaving the sphere of the Reich, as they do not like the godless pagans\n\nThe USSR was practically destroyed after the war, with Stalin killed in war and Beria and Molotov taking over. Several warlord states seceded from Russia, and Beria was fighting a losing war, when he finally decided to use Russian pagan symbols to resurrect Stalin. Zombie Stalin consolidated the USSR, and drove out many warlords with only the West Siberian League, a organization consisting of three republics in Siberia, remaining.\n\nIn Turkey, shocked by the closeness of the Third Reich, Turkey was able to resurrect Kemal Ataturk. Seeing the atrocities done by the Reich,Zombie Kemal knew that there was no chance of peace, instead invading the Middle Eastern Reichskommissariats, taking them for Turkey and puppeting Egypt. He industrialized for nearly 10 years. Germany attempted to send the Dead SS to Ankara, but Kemal routed them and defeated the undefeatable. He then freed Sudan from the Reich, making it an independent kingdom. He was also able to setup a protection field in the Haga Sophia.\n\nIndia is controlled by the Azad Hind. They broke away from the Axis, and are currently in a protracted border conflict with China.\n\nJapan continues to be occupied by the US.\n\nFrance fights major wars in Africa, with a military blockade of their one non landlocked country.\n\nAmerica funds anti-German states across the world, and does their own research into the occult. They have gained Spain as an ally, and it is their land base in Europe\n\nWith Scotland, Ireland, Spain, France, the USSR and Turkey planning a great war on the Reich, their ally Italy leaving them due to not being Christian, internal strife dividing the Reich, and a bad economy, the Reich will fall. The question is: when will it be?\n\nAnother map from my timeline, this time showing the Great Anarchy of 1524.\n\nEssentially, a large number of events that occurred in OTL are expedited by Charles Brandon's defeat at Edinburgh in 1523 which left the Duke of Albany in control of Cumberland and Northumberland. In order to pay for fresh forces to expel the Scots, Henry VIII tasks Cardinal Wolsey with extorting funds from the commons. As in our timeline, the attempts go badly, but instead of relenting, the king doubles down on his efforts. As a result, there are riots and peasant rebellions in East Anglia and Cornwall.\n\nMeanwhile, unrest in Wales under Rhys ap Gruffydd (head of House Dynevor, his grandfather dying a year earlier ITTL) and in Royal Ireland under Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare, spill over into the troubles in England proper. Richard de la Pole (known as the White Rose), freshly returned from the French victory in Milan, is then backed as a pretender to the English throne (again as in OTL) by Francis and secures Dynevor and Geraldine backing.\n\nSuffolk manages to beat the Scots at Easingwold just north of York, but his men are badly mauled in the process, leaving them weakened to face de la Pole's invasion force of Irish and continental mercenaries at Wakefield. The Second Battle of Wakefield ends in a decisive Yorkist victory, leaving much of northern England in the hands of the White Rose. In a last ditch attempt to save his crown, Henry VIII leads one last Tudor army to Oxford, where monarch and pretender fight face to face. Unfortunately, the knight-errantly Henry is killed in action, forcing his wife and daughter to flee into exile on the continent.\n\nMade in Adobe Illustrator\n\nBase maps from:\n\nSpruner, Karl & von Menke, Theodor: Hand-Atlas f√ºr die Geschichte des Mittelalters und der neueren Zeit (Gotha, 1880)\n\nSmith, Brendan et al.: The Cambridge History of Ireland: Volume 1, 600-1550 (Cambridge University Press, 2018)"
