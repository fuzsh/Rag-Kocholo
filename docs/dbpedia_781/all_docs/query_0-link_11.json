Karl Theodor Menke (September 13, 1791 - 1861) was a German malacologist and balneologist who was a native of Bremen. He is remembered for his research on snails. Menke studied medicine at the University of Göttingen, and worked as a physician at the spa in Bad Pyrmont. In 1844 he founded the journal Zeitschrift für Malakozoologie (from 1854 titled Malakozoologische Blatten). With Ludwig Karl Georg Pfeiffer (18051877), he was editor of the magazine. During his lifetime, Menke amassed a large collection of snail shells, which were purchased by dealer M.J. Landauer of Frankfurt after his death. The sea snail species Cerithium menkei and Natica menkeana are named in honor of Menke. Signé par l'auteur."
