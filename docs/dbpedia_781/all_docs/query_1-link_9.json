As Dr. Casey Means explains in this book, nearly every health problem we face can be explained by how well the cells in our body create and use energy. To live free from frustrating symptoms and life-threatening disease, we need our cells to be optimally powered so that they can create “good energy,” the essential fuel that impacts every aspect of our wellbeing.\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\noverzealous author\n\nBy Anonymous User on 05-20-24\n\nFourth Wing\n\nEmpyrean, Book 1\n\nBy: Rebecca Yarros\n\nNarrated by: Rebecca Soler, Teddy Hamilton\n\nLength: 21 hrs and 22 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 33,811\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 31,342\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 31,346\n\nTwenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history.
