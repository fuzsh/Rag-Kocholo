A brave fight for life was lost by Kenneth Lang, a North Side boy Friday night, when Death claimed him at the home of his parents Mr. and Mrs. Harry Lang, 616 Buffalo street. The dead boy was 21 years of age and a victim of that insiduous foe, consumption. Last June, his health failing, he was taken to the sanitarium at Wales where he remained until five weeks ago, returning home when hope of his recovery was abandoned, and for several days past his life had been hanging in the balance. The death of Mr. Lang is pathetically sad and will awaken sympathy for the bereaved family. A young man of bright mind, ambitious and with the promise of a successful career before him, he was popular and respected and his death will be deplored by many who knew him. Besides his parents, he is survived by two sisters, Margaret and Genevieve and one brother Sydney. The funeral will be held Monday afternoon from St. Paul's M.E. church.

LAPOTKO MESSSAGES OF ENDEARMENT CAME TOO LATE Perhaps it was co-incidence, a trick of fate to prove that after all we are but pawns of destiny, that brought to the home of Mike Lutz of the Jonas Jansky Clothing company two registered letters containing endearing messages from brothers and sisters in far off Russia this morning a few hours after his father had passed away at the hospital. For fifteen months not a word had been heard from the family in Russia and the worry added to internal ills from which he was a sufferer, hastened the death of Gregory Lapotko, father of Mr. Lutz who had been making his home with him from the last ten years. Born in Russia Born in Russia September 29, 1870, Mr. Lapotko came to the United States in 1913 and came to Manitowoc where his son was located. Then came the war and his son served across with the U.S. troops. Mr. Lapotko's family, a wife, three daughters and two sons were living in Russia where the father had himself served with the Russian army. Here he became an employe of the Aluminum Goods company with whom he remained until his death. Besides the son here, Mike Lutz, 430 South Twenty-sixth street, the widow, three daughters, Mrs. Marie Lapotko, Mr. Xenia Wiskwiko and Miss Eulokia Lapotka and two sons Vasilic and Vladimir Lapotko live at Blevekiczy, Russia.
