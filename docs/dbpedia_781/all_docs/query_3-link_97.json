        "text": "Hi Guys, I though I would bring this old thread back up with the info I found about the battle and the German units involved:\n\nFight for Lebus 1945\n\nIn late January 1945, the Red Army, with their spearheads on the borders of the former district Lebus and thus approached our home town of Lebus. After Jan 12th 1945 from the Vistula - Baranov bridgehead they started out their winter offensive, the vanguard of 1st Belorussian Front under the command of Marshal Zhukov. On the way to Berlin, here the furthest Soviet advance was halted, as Zhukov had to turn the main force to cover the right flank to the north.\n\nTo prepare for the assault on Berlin, 1st Belorussian Front established and consolidated the Front in the period from February to April 1945 at the Oder a beachhead 44km-10km wide and 7km deep, extending from south to north in the Lebus Kienitz. Lebus was part of this gigantic bulwark and was held by the Soviet 247th Rifle Division.\n\nOn February 2nd continuing south Küstrin Göritz was taken, the 4th Guards Rifle Corps is under the command of Colonel General Chuikov (8th Guards Army) on the still frozen river Oder. The following day reinforced the 28th Guards Rifle Corps, at Göritz the bridgehead on the west bank of the Oder. Göritz (or Reitwein) was to become one of the most important and greatest battlefield of the Second World War on German soil. The bridgehead Göritz was also the starting point for exploring the city of Lebus. Taking our home town by the Red Army was out of the north and both sides brought losses of more than 1000 dead. 9th Armee led by General Theodor Busse, was prepared for the rapid Soviet advance to the Oder hardly had the onslaught of the North to the fortress-proclaimed city of Frankfurt / Oder had only little to counter.\n\nIt was only on February 2nd Volkssturm Battalion 7 / 108 francs with his four companies of the western bank of the Oder between Frankfurt and Lebus. Further north at the gaping Or even an 8km-long gap to the front used in Reiwein RAD battalion. The battalion staff of the Franks moved into first place in the Lebus in the neighborhood bakery Grunwald. On February 2nd after the battle group of Colonel Settler, from February 3rd reinforced by a SS group took over the defense of Lebus, the staff of the Franks moved on February 4th, under heavy fire in the mill valley south of Lebus in the middle mill. The northern flank of the battalion Frankish one must now begin in the south of the so-called height or \"Nose of Lebus\". Only a few days earlier, was recruited this battalion in Ansbach. \"The majority has never been a soldier, has never had a gun in his hand and is already marked by age and illness,\" Baron von Freytag Loringhofen, adjutant to the side of the first captain Battaillonskommandeurs Rieger. With the Franks were scattered members of the Wehrmacht, who could instruct the men in the use of arms.\n\nFor days now the Lebus residents heard approaching gunfire and cannon fire which could be seen beyond the Oder and fire and columns of smoke rising into the sky. A mile-long chain of refugees moved on to the ferry Lebus' wagons, wounded soldiers, women with prams, old men walking with a lot of luggage, a sad picture. On February 3rd the Soviet forces reached the northern outskirts of Lebus. The same day, Soviet military was also seen in the right of Lebus. The Lebus ferry had to be blown up. Another source relates that already one day earlier on the phone the local farmers Von Krogh, a Russian voice answered. A then 14-year-old remembers a commando operation. It was used to rescue the family Anton who was stuck on the east bank of the Oder. It had a Soviet-gun position, which was located in the attic of the east, behind the Dam Fährgaststätte be kept in check. Furthermore, he observed in the street or a Croatian unit whose armored vehicles toward Lebus - In the bush moving. A Lebus witness reported: \"refugee trains by wagon and on foot from the east, in cold weather pouring on the road past us ... We tried to alleviate the misery with hot drinks and food. At 3:02 there were numerous German soldiers swam through the icy and sought refuge in our homes. ... In Caffee Wöhler an office for stragglers had been set up ... but there was a lack of food. We had neighbors who brought over hot drinks and food. \" It is also reported that the butchers and bakery Grunwald delivered food.\n\nWhen the Soviet artillery, more and more included Lebus, people sought refuge from the threatened areas in the basements of the (no longer existing) mansion house. Others sought shelter in the property of Black farmers. After a grenade hit, there was also injured, and these people took refuge in the basement of the mansion in the garden office. The windmills of Matthias and Bretsch hit and burned. The soldiers asked for the residents for spades and entrenching tools for work. Leading political men of Lebus, as local leader Rush, nor disseminated then, that there would be no danger when the military already been urged to evacuate the town. The local group leader tried to approach the front to list the local Volkssturm company. This, however, no preparations had been made. Command to activate the Lebus Volkssturm company received Corporal Menke. He had experience of war, because he was in the front line until September 1941 and in 1944 he attended military school in two weeks, the Meseritz. The Lebus Volkssturm unit was pulled together in the basement of the parsonage of Pastor Kunze. The train from the right of Lebus turned out there was already the Red Army. The equipment consisted of men of Italian guns, each with five rounds of ammunition and several Panzerfausts. Given their desperate situation, the men went to a cease-fire along the railway embankment towards Booß and then by Peter Hagen. They contacted the 712th Grenadierdivision on which there had obtained command post.\n\nAt the last minute, 4th February evacuation orders were issued for Lebus. Mayor Dornfield should have let two trains to evacuate the station provide Schönfließ. For the evacuation of the Lebus before that date he had previously not received any permission. Soviet snipers fired from the east bank of the Oder on everything that moved. In the street widths were equal to the Deutsches Haus and blankets stretched Dünow as screens and ball catcher. A Lebuserin may recall that on February 4th already in a sudden attack Soviet forces occupied the site of the official mansion garden. From the north comes Lebus February 4th, riding in the area wine-Wuhden Klessin, the Mechanized Infantry Division \"Kurmark\" under Major Hopffgarten was used. Manages to become the command post with Podelzig operating division Kurmark it no longer, to push back the Soviet bridgehead Goritz. The division set up its command post in the Good Libbenichen. New local commander of Lebus was Ritterkreuzträger Major Koenig, who replaced the embattled Officer. On the grounds of the Frankfurt street in Dr.Bieler's, a dressing station was established. An eye-witness reports of many deaths he has seen. Of 06.02. marks the completion of the escape of nearly all citizens Lebus, the German forces retreated from tactical ground back from the Lebus suburbs.\n\nOn February 7th XI SS Panzer Corps under SS Obergruppenführer Kleinheisterkamp transfers the Pz Gren Division \"Kurmark\" about 18 km north of Frankfurt to Veteidigungslinie Reitweiner in the area. This keeps them in great losses to mid-April 1945. The further Soviet advance came to this main line of battle, which led through the village and the area around Lebus, and its course several times by the fighting changed, to be tentative. The height of the edge of the Oderbruch remained largely under German control. The Soviets succeeded in the individual or bridgehead between State Highway 1 and south to connect Lebus, expand and consolidate. The strategically important height 81.5 Reitweiner on the northern spur, which was taken by Belarusian Guard units on 3rd February but remained occupied by the Soviets. Here were the first headquarters of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, and later the Marshal Zhukov. On the night of February 6th/7th, 69th Soviet Army also continued in Lebus bush on the Oder. Began to be built here in the amount of homestead Schmidt a bridge of a high load capacity. A day later, the Soviets invaded in to Kietzer road, and attacked in Mill Valley to the Franks. Because retreat of Franconia company commander was arrested Captain Rieger, and the captain of the fortress Lettow Frankfurt took over command of the Volkssturm battalion. Is reported by a railway gun. An armored train came over the Booß distance to the Saharan desert, then Gleisdreieck Kunersdorf. The gun was then brought into position. As a defense against Soviet tanks, which had advanced from the north to Lebus was the Jadg Panther Abt.2 (with 4 assault guns, 88 mm ). At 09.02. Lutwaffe ace Hans Ulrich Rudel flew with his squadron several attacks on Soviet tanks (some type of Stalin tank), who were up north Anglerheim progressed. Stationed in Mallnow was III.SS-Artillerie-Lehr-Regiment under SS-Sturmbannführer Hermann Schünemann. It was specialized in the rocket launcher. The were used flexibly. They were taken to the Lebus station and pulled back into position after firing from the danger area.\n\nUnder the command of Himmler's Army Group Vistula recorded the loss of Lebus to 12.02. Lebus was now mainly in Soviet possession, the main battle line ran along the railway line. The staff of Soviet 247th Rifle Division moved from the east bank of the Oder on Feb 14th \"in a brick house\" in Lebus (school buildings). The commander of 909th Rifle Regt, Choroschawin describes the fighting:\n\n\"We ran into fierce German resistance fought tough .. the fascists, some of the houses changed hands several times, the fascists wanted to throw our warriors in the Oder and conquer the bridgehead. Fascist artillery and planes bombarded the city and bombed relentlessly, where our armed forces, Infantry and tanks took turns. A major contribution to the successful conduct of hostilities in Lebus was the political department of the 247th Rifle Div ... With fiery speeches, the political commissars ... the moral of its soldiers fighting spirit lifted, and if it was necessary to lead they are fighting in the battle. \"\n\nThe Red Army began in Lebus. Leaflets rained down on German lines. On these speakers and German soldiers were called on to run in their native language, you promised peaceful life and good food. In between they played German military marches.\n\nHastily reinforced the German side, especially now with spare units and Volkssturm battalions in the front section or Lebus Reitwein. The feeding was carried out by the station Schönfließ. The command structures of 9th Armee were placed under SS units. According to a reserve army command-formed one cadet regiments, which were composed of 50% of the Volkssturm, 25% and 25% reserve army cadets from military schools. Such an entity that is known from Wetzlar Fhj.Gren.Rgt.1241 coming, as people moved into Grenadier Regiment 1241, on February 9th with 6 companies in the first position and Lebus Lindenhof could temporarily push the Soviets back. When they were forced to evade the Soviet counterattack, one dig located west of the railway line. Another Fhj.Gren.Rgt.1242 Wetzlar assumed the Div.303 Döberitz, as well as the short-established tank divisions \"Jüterbog\" and \"Müncheberg\" reinforced the front line. The Fhj.Gren.Reg.1243 Potsdam and Dresden in 1235, which came to reinforce the Pz.Gren.Div.Kurmark operated for use in the front section of Lebus. The regiment was stationed in Potsdam Klessin. On February 14th they overran the Soviets with several regiments and tank support fast moving second held by the Fhj.Gren.Reg.1235Dresden in the northwest section of Lebus. The leading corps took command then, staggered by 17th February, more companies of Wetzlar (1241) in order to secure the gap in the front line Lebus / NW Klessin. Another unit, which drew in Vienna Fhj.Gren.Rgt.1239 hastily put together by Major Landmark, on Feb 15th, positioned west of the railway embankment south of the station to the amount wilderness Lebuser Kunersdorf. It was in the Association of v.Siegstroth 712th Grenadierdivision, commanded by a Maj. Gen. At this time the Soviets are in part directly opposite on the other side of the embankment. The Viennese unit also increased the operating further south Volkssturm Battalion 7 / 108 francs. A day later attack the meantime further reinforced the Vienna Elise Berg. This was already secured by positions and minefields impregnable part of the Soviet bridgehead, so that the attack would be unsuccessful. The Viennese dug themselves trenches and winter-proof shelters.\n\nTwo major thrusts of German units with the aim to push back the Soviet bridgehead in Lebus. On 18th February pushed the Fhj.Gren.Rgt.1241 Wetzlar with artillery bombardment, tank (Panther) and air support (Me-109) in thickness from 3rd Battalion from the north along the front towards Kietzer Chausse Lebus. At the northern edge of this attack was in the Soviet barrage lie. It led to a low income area, which dug in Wetzlar. The Soviet counter-attack was not stopped south of Shepherd reason, the Lindenhof was transferred to the Soviet side. Another corps commanded by the superior height of the first attack had 55 (Görschberg) to the destination. There is a connection between the attack and the scope of the Berlin Museum for Pre-and Early History in the Lebus mansion outsourced \"Ancestral Heritage\". The attack was carried out by the Haakengrund few days and was crowned with success, until the Red Army recaptured the Görschberg. The weeks until the start of the Soviet offensive is described as follows: In order to prevent local German counter-attacks, \"there is a ceaseless attrition and weakening our deployed there units, the artillery and mortars were brought in around the clock and her disruptive and well camouflaged snipers picked off men. They daily sacrificed. \"\n\nIn early April reinforced the 9th Armee the main battle line north through the Lebus 169th Infanteriedivision (Lieutenant General Karl Radzieje). He set up the command post in New Mahlisch. Overall, however, the overwhelming numerical superiority of the Red Army against the 9th Armee not be compensated. On the Oder Front, soldiers at 3: 1, in artillery and mortars at 5.7: 1 and 4.1 for vehicles: 1 in favor of the Red Army. With the beginning of the Soviet offensive on 16th April at 03.00 left in the bridgehead Lebus content provided combat troops broke through our home town and in the course of two days the storm-layered German defenses in order to Berlin.\n\nSome more info on the \"Kurmark\" division can be found here:\n\nEinheiten-Mitte\n\nCheers, Ade\n\nAttached Images"
