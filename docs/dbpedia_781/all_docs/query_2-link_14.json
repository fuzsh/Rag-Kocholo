        "text": "Demure British beauty Jean Simmons was born January 31, 1929, in Crouch End, London. As a 14-year-old dance student, she was plucked from her school to play Margaret Lockwood's precocious sister in Give Us the Moon (1944). She had a small part as a harpist in the high-profile Caesar und Cleopatra (1945), produced by Gabriel Pascal, starring Vivien Leigh, and co-starring her future husband Stewart Granger. Pascal saw potential in Simmons, and in 1945 he signed her to a seven-year contract to the J. Arthur Rank Organization, and she went on to make a name for herself in such major British productions as Die großen Erwartungen (1946) (as the spoiled, selfish Estella), Die schwarze Narzisse (1947) (as a sultry native beauty), Hamlet (1948) (playing Ophelia to Laurence Olivier's great Dane and earning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination), Die blaue Lagune (1949) and Paris um Mitternacht (1950), among others.\n\nIn 1950, she married Stewart Granger, and that same year, she moved to Hollywood. While Granger was signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Rank sold her contract to Howard Hughes, who then owned RKO Pictures. Hughes was eager to start a sexual relationship with Simmons, but Granger put a stop to his advances. Her first Hollywood film was Androkles und der Löwe (1952), produced by Pascal and co-starring Victor Mature. It was followed by Engelsgesicht (1952), directed by Otto Preminger with Robert Mitchum. To further punish Simmons and Granger, Hughes refused to lend her to Paramount, where William Wyler wanted to cast her in the female lead for his film Ein Herz und eine Krone (1953); the role made a star of Audrey Hepburn. A court case freed Simmons from the contract with Hughes in 1952. They settled out of court; part of the arrangement was that Simmons would do one more film for no additional money. Simmons also agreed to make three more movies under the auspices of RKO, but not actually at that studio - she would be lent out. MGM cast her in the lead of Die Thronfolgerin (1953) playing a young Queen Elizabeth I with Granger. She went back to RKO to do the extra film under the settlement with Hughes, titled Ein Mann ohne Bedeutung (1953) with Mature; it flopped.\n\nSimmons went over to 20th Century Fox to play the female lead in Das Gewand (1953), the first CinemaScope movie and an enormous financial success. Less popular was Theaterfieber (1953) at MGM alongside Spencer Tracy, despite superb reviews; it was one of her personal favorites. Fox asked Simmons back for Sinuhe, der Ägypter (1954), another epic, but it was not especially popular. She had the lead in Columbia's Eine Kugel wartet (1954). More popular with moviegoers was Desirée (1954), where Simmons played Désirée Clary to Marlon Brando's Napoleon Bonaparte. Simmons and Granger returned to England to make the thriller Zwischen Haß und Liebe (1955). She then starred in the musical Schwere Jungen, leichte Mädchen (1955) with Brando and Frank Sinatra; she used her own singing voice and earned her first Golden Globe Award. Simmons played the title role in Hilda Crane (1956) at Fox, a commercial failure. So, too, were Kein Platz für feine Damen (1957) and Land ohne Männer (1957), both at MGM. Simmons had a big success, though, in Weites Land (1958), directed by Wyler. She starred in Bevor die Nacht anbricht (1958) at Warner Bros. and Diese Erde ist mein (1959) with Rock Hudson at Universal.\n\nSimmons divorced Granger in 1960 and almost immediately married writer-director Richard Brooks, who cast her as Sister Sharon opposite Burt Lancaster in Elmer Gantry - Gott ist im Geschäft (1960), a memorable adaptation of the Sinclair Lewis novel. That same year, she co-starred with Kirk Douglas in Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus (1960) and played a would-be homewrecker opposite Cary Grant in Vor Hausfreunden wird gewarnt (1960).\n\nOff the screen for a few years, Jean captivated moviegoers with a brilliant performance as the mother in All the Way Home (1963), a literate, tasteful adaptation of James Agee's \"A Death in the Family\". However, after that, she found quality projects somewhat harder to come by, and took work in Ein Platz ganz oben (1965), Gesicht ohne Namen (1966), Scheidung auf amerikanisch (1967), Als Jim Dolan kam (1967), Happy-End für eine Ehe (1969) (a Richard Brooks film for which she was again Oscar-nominated, this time as Best Actress).\n\nJean continued making films well into the 1970s. In the 1980s, she appeared mainly in television miniseries, such as Fackeln im Sturm (1985) and Die Dornenvögel (1983). She made a comeback to films in 1995 in Ein amerikanischer Quilt (1995) co-starring Winona Ryder and Anne Bancroft, and most recently voiced the elderly Sophie in the English version of Hayao Miyazaki's Das wandelnde Schloss (2004). She now resided in Santa Monica, California, with her dog, Mr. Gates, and her two cats, Adisson and Megan. Jean Simmons died of lung cancer on January 22, 2010, nine days before her 81st birthday.\n\nActress of both the English and American stage and screen, Lynn Redgrave was born in Marylebone, London, England, into one of the world's most famous acting dynasties. As the daughter of Rachel Kempson and Sir Michael Redgrave, sister of Vanessa Redgrave and Corin Redgrave, and granddaughter of Roy Redgrave and Margaret Scudamore, all of whom were actors, her early aspirations were surprisingly to become an equestrienne or a chef. It was not until the age of 15 that she became more and more involved in acting and her father's stage performances.\n\nAttending London's Central School of Music and Drama, she made her stage debut in 1962 and began film work a year later. It wasn't until her lovable role as the ugly-duckling in Georgy Girl (1966), that she was taken notice and, as a result, won both the Golden Globe, New York Film Critics Circle Award and a nomination for the coveted Best Actress at the 1967 Academy Awards. Despite this promising performance, Lynn struggled to find promising follow-up work, she played the lead in the fluffy Smashing Time (1967) and Rekruten im Todesdschungel (1969), low-key films that were relevant at the time of London's swinging 60s, but very quickly became largely forgotten. She married stage actor/director John Clark and her sister, Vanessa Redgrave, who was also Oscar-nominated the same year for Protest (1966), was also gaining exposure and critical success if not surpassing Lynn, on both the British stage and films and was largely considered the leading face of England's breakout actresses of the '60s, alongside Julie Christie and other high-profile actresses.\n\nBecoming the label of Vanessa Redgrave's younger and chubbier sister \"that did that film a few years ago\" didn't sit well with Lynn and, as a result, she lost considerable weight and permanently settled in the U.S. in 1974 to distance herself from this. Primarily based in southern California, she regularly commuted to New York and became notable particularly on the Broadway stage, and had successful runs in \"Black Comedy/White Lies\" (1967), \"My Fat Friend\" (1974), \"Mrs. Warren's Profession\" (1976), \"Knock Knock\" (1976), \"Saint Joan\" (1977-1978), \"Aren't We All\" (1985) and \"Sweet Sue\" (1987). She was prolifically hired by major networks to appear on a variety of TV talk and game shows and held the position of co-host for a few seasons of Not for Women Only (1968), while acting on prime-time TV, whether it was guest spots, mini-series or short-lived TV series. For over 20 years, Redgrave's film career was infrequent and admittedly \"terrible\" by the actress herself, she notoriously played the title character in the critically-bashed, The Happy Hooker (1975), and the all-star cast misfire, Die haarsträubende Reise in einem verrückten Bus (1976), and, in the 1980s, she focused in a different direction, becoming a spokesperson and commercial actress for \"Weight Watchers\". This coincided with the release of her well- received book: \"This Is Living: How I Found Health and Happiness\", that detailed her weight issues and eating binges, it was also revealed that for years she suffered bulimia. In the mid-to-late '90s, Redgrave had somewhat of a resurgence in her career, from 1993-1994, she spent over 8 months on Broadway, as well as touring across the world, performing her own personally written show of \"Shakespeare for My Father\", that explored the bisexuality, aloof persona and intimidating resume of her father. In 1996, Scott Hicks reignited her film career after many years of inactivity by casting her in the Australian Oscar-winning hit, Shine - Der Weg ins Licht (1996), in which she gave a short yet tender performance as \"Gillian\", the woman Geoffrey Rush's character falls in love with. Another Golden Globe win/Oscar nomination followed (this time in the supporting category) for her role as the Hungarian housekeeper in Gods and Monsters (1998). Her marriage abruptly ended in 1999, when infidelity was discovered on her husband's behalf and a nasty divorced followed, they produced three children Benjamin, Kelly Clark and Annabel Clark.\n\nContinually working her way through film, television and stage performances in the '00s, recently awarded the OBE, Lynn Redgrave was shocked to discover lumps on her body and was diagnosed with breast cancer. As a result, she took time to write \"Journal: A Mother and Daughter's Recovery from Breast Cancer\" with her youngest daughter, Annabel Clark, in 2003 and tragically lost her 7-year battle on 2 May 2010 (aged 67) in her family home, surrounded by her loved ones. Her diagnosis led her to realize the beauty and simplicities of life, and she was quoted as saying: \"there isn't any such thing as a bad day. Yes, bad things happen. But any day that I'm still here, able to feel and think and share things with people, then how could that possibly be a bad day?\".\n\nMulti-talented and unconventional actor/director regarded by many as one of the true \"enfant terribles\" of Hollywood who led an amazing cinematic career for more than five decades, Dennis Hopper was born on May 17, 1936, in Dodge City, Kansas. The young Hopper expressed interest in acting from a young age and first appeared in a slew of 1950s television shows, including Medic (1954), Cheyenne (1955) and Sugarfoot (1957). His first film role was in ...denn sie wissen nicht, was sie tun (1955), quickly followed by Giganten (1956) and Zwei rechnen ab (1957). Hopper actually became good friends with James Dean and was shattered when Dean was killed in a car crash in September 1955.\n\nHopper portrayed a young Napoléon Bonaparte (!) in the star-spangled The Story of Mankind (1957) and regularly appeared on screen throughout the 1960s, often in rather undemanding parts, usually as a villain in westerns such as Der Marshal (1969) and Hängt ihn höher (1968). However, in early 1969, Hopper, fellow actor Peter Fonda and writer Terry Southern, wrote a counterculture road movie script and managed to scrape together $400,000 in financial backing. Hopper directed the low-budget film, titled Easy Rider (1969), starring Fonda, Hopper and a young Jack Nicholson. The film was a phenomenal box-office success, appealing to the anti-establishment youth culture of the times. It changed the Hollywood landscape almost overnight and major studios all jumped onto the anti-establishment bandwagon, pumping out low-budget films about rebellious hippies, bikers, draft dodgers and pot smokers. However, Hopper's next directorial effort, The Last Movie (1971), was a critical and financial failure, and he has admitted that during the 1970s he was seriously abusing various substances, both legal and illegal, which led to a downturn in the quality of his work. He appeared in a sparse collection of European-produced films over the next eight years, before cropping up in a memorable performance as a pot-smoking photographer alongside Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He also received acclaim for his work in both acting and direction for Out of the Blue (1980).\n\nWith these two notable efforts, the beginning of the 1980s saw a renaissance of interest by Hollywood in the talents of Dennis Hopper and exorcising the demons of drugs and alcohol via a rehabilitation program meant a return to invigorating and provoking performances. He was superb in Rumble Fish (1983), co-starred in the tepid spy thriller Das Osterman-Weekend (1983), played a groovy school teacher in Future Project - Das Geheimprojekt (1985), was a despicable and deranged drug dealer in Das Messer am Ufer (1986) and, most memorably, electrified audiences as foul-mouthed Frank Booth in the eerie and erotic David Lynch film Blue Velvet (1986). Interestingly, the offbeat Hopper was selected in the early 1980s to provide the voice of \"The StoryTeller\" in the animated series of \"Rabbit Ears\" children's films based upon the works of Hans Christian Andersen!\n\nHopper returned to film direction in the late 1980s and was at the helm of the controversial gang film Colors - Farben der Gewalt (1988), which was well received by both critics and audiences. He was back in front of the cameras for roles in Super Mario Bros. (1993), got on the wrong side of gangster Christopher Walken in True Romance (1993), led police officer Keanu Reeves and bus passenger Sandra Bullock on a deadly ride in Speed (1994) and challenged gill-man Kevin Costner for world supremacy in Waterworld (1995). The enigmatic Hopper continued to remain busy through the 1990s and into the new century with performances in The Night We Called It a Day (2003), The Keeper (2004) and Land of the Dead (2005).\n\nAs well as his acting/directing talents, Hopper was a skilled photographer and painter, having had his works displayed in galleries in both the United States and overseas. He was additionally a dedicated and knowledgeable collector of modern art and had one of the most extensive collections in the United States. Dennis died of prostate cancer on May 29, 2010, less than two weeks after his 74th birthday.\n\nTall, slim and exceedingly good-looking American leading man Robert Culp, a former cartoonist in his teen years, appeared off-Broadway in the 1950s before settling into polished, clean-cut film leads and \"other man\" supports a decade later. Hitting the popular TV boards in the hip, racially ground-breaking espionage program Tennisschläger und Kanonen (1965), he made a slick (but never smarmy), sardonic name for himself during his over five-decade career with his sly humor, casual banter and tongue-in-cheek sexiness. Though he had the requisite looks and smooth, manly appeal (not to mention acting talent) for superstardom, a cool but cynical and somewhat detached persona may have prevented him from attaining it full-out.\n\nHe was born Robert Martin Culp on August 16, 1930, in Oakland California. The son of attorney Crozie Culp and his wife, Bethel Collins, who was employed at a Berkeley chemical company, he offset his only-child loneliness by playacting in local theater productions. Culp also showed a talent for art while young and earned money as a cartoonist for Bay Area magazines and newspapers in high school, but the fascination with becoming an actor proved much stronger. He attended Berkeley High School and graduated in 1947. The athletically-inclined Culp dominated at track and field events and, as a result, earned athletic scholarships to six different universities. He selected the relatively minor College of the Pacific in Stockton, California primarily because of its active theater department. Transferring to various other colleges of higher learning (including San Francisco State in 1949), he never earned a degree. After performing in some theatre in the San Francisco area, he moved to Seattle and then New York in 1951.\n\nStudying under famed teacher Herbert Berghof and supporting himself during this time teaching speech and phonetics, Bob eventually found work on the theatre scene, making his 1953 Broadway debut (as Robert M. Culp) in \"The Prescott Proposals\" with Katharine Cornell. He eventually returned to Broadway with \"Diary of a Scoundrel\" starring Blanche Yurka and Roddy McDowall in 1956 and with a strong role in \"A Clearing in the Woods\" (alongside Kim Stanley) a year later. He earned an off-Broadway Obie Award for his very fine work in \"He Who Gets Slapped\" in 1956, and also appeared in the plays \"Daily Life\" and \"Easter\".\n\nGracing a few live-TV dramas during his New York days, he returned to his native California for his first major TV role. It was an auspicious one as post-Civil War Texas Ranger \"Hoby Gilman\" in the western series Trackdown (1957). He earned widespread attention in the series that based many of its stories from actual Texas Ranger files, and the show itself received the official approval not only of the Rangers themselves but by the State of Texas. The series led to a CBS spin-off of its own: Der Kopfgeldjäger (1958), which made a TV star out of Steve McQueen.\n\nFrom there, Culp guested on a number of series dramas: Bonanza (1959), Westlich von Santa Fe (1958), Tausend Meilen Staub (1959), Kein Fall für FBI (1959), Ben Casey (1961), The Outer Limits (1963), Gnadenlose Stadt (1958) and Combat! (1962). He also starred in the two-part Disney family-styled program \"Sammy the Way Out Seal\" (1962), which was subsequently released as a feature in Europe. He and Patricia Barry played the hapless parents of precocious Bill Mumy and Michael McGreevey whose \"adopted\" pet animal unleashes major chaos in their suburban neighborhood.\n\nDuring this time, Bob began to seek lead and supporting work in films. Despite his co-starring with Cliff Robertson, Rod Taylor and the very perky Jane Fonda (as her straight-laced boyfriend) in the sparkling Broadway-based sexcapade Sonntag in New York (1963); playing Robertson's naval mate in the popular John F. Kennedy biopic Patrouillenboot PT 109 (1963); recreating the legendary \"Wild Bill\" Hickok in the western tale Die rauhen Reiter von Texas (1963); and heading up the adventurous cast of the Ivan Tors' African yarn Safari zur Hölle (1964) (which included Harry Guardino and the very fetching British import Shirley Eaton), Culp wasn't able to make a serious dent in the medium.\n\nTV remained his best arena and gave him more lucrative offers, professionally. It rewarded him quite richly in 1965 with the debonair series lead \"Kelly Robinson\", a jet-setting, pro-circuit tennis player who leads a double life as an international secret agent in Tennisschläger und Kanonen (1965). Running three seasons, Culp co-starred with fellow secret agent Bill Cosby, who, as \"Alexander Scott\", posed as Culp's tennis trainer. The role was tailor-made for the suave, Ivy-League-looking actor. He looked effortlessly cool posing in sunglasses amid the posh continental settings and remained handsomely unflinching in the face of danger. It was the first U.S. prime-time network drama to feature an African-American actor in a full-out starring role and the relationship between the two meshed perfectly and charismatically on screen. Both were nominated for acting Emmys in all three of its seasons, with Cosby coming out the victor each time. Filmed on location in such cities as Hong Kong, Acapulco and Tokyo, Culp also wrote and directed certain episodes of the show He also met his third wife, the gorgeous Eurasian actress France Nuyen, while on the set. They married in 1967 but divorced three years later. At this stage, the actor already had four children (by second wife, sometime actress Nancy Ashe).\n\nFollowing the series' demise, Culp took on perhaps his most-famous and controversial film role as Natalie Wood's husband \"Bob\" in the titillating but ultimately teasing \"flower power\" era film Bob & Caroline & Ted & Alice (1969), with Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon as the other-half couple who examine the late 60s \"free love\" idea of wife-swapping. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards (two went to supporting actors Gould and Cannon). The movie did not reignite Culp's popularity on the large screen, but it did lead to his rather strange pairing with buxom Raquel Welch in the violent-edged western In einem Sattel mit dem Tod (1971) and a reunion with his Tennisschläger und Kanonen (1965) pal Cosby in the far-more entertaining Magnum Heat (1972), which reestablished their great tongue-in-cheek rapport as two weary-eyed private eyes. Culp also directed the film while his real-life wife, actress Sheila Sullivan, played his screen wife as well.\n\nThe late 1970s produced a flood of routine mini-movies and B-pictures, the latter including Inside Out - Ein genialer Bluff (1975), Auf der Fährte des Adlers (1976), Ein Orkan von Blei (1976), Der Supermann des Wilden Westens (1976), Die Flut bricht los (1976), Der Agent (1979) and Hot Rod (1979). While he remained a sturdy and standard presence in such mini-movies as Houston, bitte kommen... (1974), Spectre (1977) and Der Model-Killer (1984), his better TV-movie roles were in Der eiskalte Tod (1973), Outrage (1973), A Cry for Help (1975) and as \"Lyle Pettyjohn\" in the acclaimed mini-series sequel Roots - Die nächsten Generationen (1979).\n\nBob returned to series TV as stern FBI Special Agent \"Bill Maxwell\", whose job was to work with handsome William Katt, who starred as an ersatz The Greatest American Hero (1981). The show lasted three seasons. Other series guest spots, both comedic and dramatic, included Hotel (1983), Ein Engel auf Erden (1984), Golden Girls (1985) and an episode of his old buddy's show Die Bill Cosby Show (1984). He was also a guest murderer in three of the \"Columbo\" episodes. Although he was relegated to appearing in such film fodder as Das Schlitzohr (1985), Big Bad Mama 2 (1987) and Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog (1989), the 1990s offered him one of his best film roles in years as the ill-fated President in the Denzel Washington/Julia Roberts political thriller Die Akte (1993). A year later, he again reteamed with Cosby in the TV-movie Bill Cosby & Co. - Die Rückkehr der Superspione (1994).\n\nCulp became very active in the 1960s Civil Rights movement and later became a prominent face in local civic causes, joining in a lawsuit to cease construction of an elephant exhibit at the Los Angeles Zoo and accusing officials there of mistreatment. In the long run, however, the construction was given the green light. Culp also married a fifth time to Candace Faulkner and, by her, had daughter Samantha Culp in 1982. Older sons Jason Culp (born 1961) and Joseph Culp (born 1963) became actors, while another son, Joshua Culp (born 1958), entered the visual effects field. Daughter Rachel, an outré clothing designer for rock stars, was born in 1964.\n\nIn later years, Culp could be seen occasionally as Ray Romano's father-in-law on the hugely popular Alle lieben Raymond (1996). His last film, the family drama The Assignment (2010), was unreleased at the time of his death. On March 24, 2010, the 79-year-old Culp collapsed from an apparent heart attack while walking near the lower entrance to Runyon Canyon Park, a popular hiking area in the Hollywood Hills. Found by a hiker, Culp was transported to a nearby hospital where he died from the head injuries he sustained in the fall. Five grandchildren also survive.\n\nJames Mitchell was an American actor and dancer of English descent. He was one the leading dancers for choreographer Agnes de Mille (1905-1993). As an actor, Mitchell is primarily remembered for his role as diabolical businessman Palmer Cortlandt in the long-running soap opera \"All My Children\". Mitchell played this role from 1979 to 2010, and Cortlandt was one of the series' major characters until 2002.\n\nIn 1920, Mitchell was born in Sacramento, California. His parents were English immigrants who operated a fruit farm in Turlock, an agricultural settlement in Stanislaus County, California. In 1923, his parents separated. His mother returned to England, and took Mitchell's siblings with her. Unable to raise Mitchell on his own, his father entrusted him to the care of vaudevillians Gene and Katherine King. While the senior Mitchell eventually reclaimed custody over his son, Mitchell became interested in a show business career of his own.\n\nMitchell left Turlock in 1937, in order to seek education as an actor. He studied drama at Los Angeles City College, and was trained in modern dance by famed choreographer Lester Horton (1906-1953). Following his graduation, Mitchell formally joined the Lester Horton Dancers (1932-1944), Horton's own dance company.\n\nIn 1944, Horton dissolved his dance company and moved to New York City, taking Mitchell with him. Horton attempted to form a new dance company there for dancer Sonia Shaw, and his main investor was Shaw's husband. The investor reneged on the deal, and Horton's company went bankrupt before its debut performance. Mitchell was left unemployed for the first time in his career.\n\nMitchell had trouble finding acting or dancing jobs in New York City, where there were many available performers. Mitchell himself had no connections in the city. He eventually applied for a job as a dancer in the musical \"Bloomer Girl\" (1944), where Agnes de Mille was the choreographer. She asked him to perform ballet moves, unaware that Mitchell had little to no training in ballet. Instead Mitchell performed a dance improvisation. De Mille was sufficiently impressed by his style to offer him the dual position of principal dancer and assistant choreographer in the show. He took the offer.\n\nMitchell's professional relationship with de Mille lasted from 1944 to 1969. In her autobiography, she praised Mitchell, commenting that he gad \"probably the strongest arms in the business, and the adagio style developed by him and his partners has become since a valued addition to ballet vocabulary.\"\n\nMitchell remained primarily a theatrical actor in the 1940s, though he appeared as a dancer and uncredited extra in film musicals and westerns. He was eventually offered a contract with Warner Brothers by producer Michael Curtiz (1886-1962). Mitchell only appeared in two Warner Brothers-produced film. His most notable there was playing gangster Duke Harris in the Western \"Colorado Territory\" (1949).\n\nMitcell was next signed to a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), where he played supporting roles in films from 1949 to 1955. His film appearances included the film noir \"Border Incident\" (1949), the Western \"Stars in My Crown\" (1950), and the musical comedy \"The Band Wagon\" (1953). His last MGM-produced film was the Biblical epic \"The Prodigal\" (1955), a notorious box office flop that resulted in losses of 771,000 dollars by the company. Mitchell's contract was terminated shortly afterward.\n\nIn 1956, Mitchell gained his first lead role in a film, playing gunfighter Terrall Butler in the Western \"The Peacemaker\" (1956). It was a low-budget production by independent producer Hal R. Makelim, and the film eventually only had a limited release. It was Mitchell's last film role for decades.\n\nMitchell was able to find steady work as an actor in television productions. In 1964, he gained the recurring role of corrupt Captain Lloyd Griffin in the soap opera \"The Edge of Night\" (1956-1975). He eventually gained the lead role of professor of literature Julian Hathaway in another soap opera, \"Where the Heart Is\" (1969-1973). The series had \"fairly healthy ratings\" for its entire run, but it was typically the lowest-rated soap on CBS' daytime schedule. It was eventually canceled and replaced by a more successful soap opera, called \"The Young and the Restless\" (1973-).\n\nFor much to the 1970s, Mitchell was reduced to sporadic guest star appearances in television. He financially supported himself as an acting teacher at Juilliard, Yale University, and Drake University. He was eventually offered the new role of businessman Palmer Cortlandt in the soap opera \"All My Children\", a role he played for 31 years.\n\nBy 2008, Mitchell was forced to reduce his television appearances due to health problems. He was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, an obstructive lung disease characterized by long-term breathing problems and poor airflow. He formally retired from acting in 2009, but made return appearances in 2010. He died in January 2010, his death caused by his chronic disease and complications by pneumonia. He was 89-years-old.\n\nIn a career spanning more than four decades, James MacArthur developed a body of work which is wonderfully dynamic in both scope and range. Portraying everything from crazed killer to stalwart defender of law and order, frustrated teenager to cynical senior supervisor, he has appeared in numerous films, television programs, and stage productions since his career officially began back in 1955. Although he had been performing in parts during summer stock productions since 1949, making his stage debut in \"The Corn Is Green\", his real acting career did not begin until he starred as the complex and misunderstood teenager in John Frankenheimer's \"Deal a Blow\". Broadcast live on the Climax! (1954) television anthology series, the program told the story of \"Hal Ditmar\", a relatively ordinary youngster on the verge of manhood who finds himself caught up in a snowballing world of trouble with his parents, the law, and virtually everyone in authority after a minor infraction of the rules at a movie theater. The story was so well-crafted and MacArthur's performance so compelling that a year later it was remade by Frankenheimer into his first theatrical release, Das nackte Gesicht (1957). The movie received much critical acclaim and earned its star a BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) Film Award nomination as Most Promising Newcomer (1958) and won a film festival in Switzerland. Next up was the Disney movie of Conrad Richter's novel, Das Herz eines Indianers (1958). Set in the late 18th century in the burgeoning United States, it told the tale of a young man who had been kidnapped by Indians as a baby and raised as the son of a chief. A respected and accepted member of the tribe, the boy, known as \"True Son\", is ripped away from the only life he has ever known and forced to return to his biological parents due to a treaty signed by people of whom he has no knowledge and who cannot possibly have any interest in his individual welfare. His subsequent struggles to find out exactly where he fits in and to gain the trust and sanction of his new community are told in a way which is as wrenching and relevant to today's society as it was then. The corollaries between this story and the custody battles which seem to occur with alarming frequency in our own time are strong and thought provoking. It seems the question regarding when in a child's life his biological parentage begins to be outweighed by the environment in which he is being raised is one which has yet to be answered. The depth with which MacArthur imbued the role makes his performance both truthful and unforgettable. Before its release in theaters, Das Herz eines Indianers (1958) was preceded by three more appearances in live teleplays, including another outstanding performance in the Studio One (1948) production of \"Tongues of Angels\" as \"Ben Adams\", a young man with a devastating stuttering problem who pretends to be a deaf/mute in order to hide his infirmity. A string of meaty roles quickly followed, including the Disney classic films Entführt - Die Abenteuer des David Balfour (1960), Der dritte Mann im Berg (1959) and Dschungel der 1000 Gefahren (1960); television programs such as Chicago 1930 (1959), Bus Stop (1961) and Wagon Train (1957); and two more live teleplays. As sociopathic killer and racketeer \"Johnny Lubin\" in Chicago 1930 (1959) episode \"Death for Sale\", MacArthur for the first time portrayed an unsympathetic character. The heart-stopping realism of his performance provided definitive proof of his abilities as a multifaceted and talented actor. In what he described in one interview as his first \"mature\" role, he then appeared as a doctor-in-the-making in Männer, die das Leben lieben (1962), turning in a fine performance as a somewhat naive young man who grows up rather quickly when presented with several tough choices and life-defining situations. After that came more television, the underrated yet stirring film, Kugeltanz nach Mitternacht (1963), and Sommer der Erwartung (1963), the highly successful precursor to the popular television series Die Waltons (1972). Once again, in both films, MacArthur played young men whose lives are changed by circumstances beyond their control and who must dig deep within themselves to find the inner strength and fortitude to deal with those events. Having by now amassed an impressive list of film and television credits in addition to stage performances on Broadway and other venues, MacArthur then turned to the pivotal role of \"Ensign Ralston\" in the tense and nerve-wracking Cold War yarn, Zwischenfall im Atlantik (1965). His performance as the eager to-please and earnest young officer carried a subtlety and intensity hard to believe of someone not yet thirty years old. The role of \"William Ashton\" in the light-hearted romance, The Truth About Spring (1965) came next, almost immediately followed by yet another coming-of-age performance as \"Lt. Weaver\" in the blockbuster WWII saga, Die letzte Schlacht (1965). Westerns and war dramas predominated the next phase of MacArthur's career with appearances in television programs such as Geächtet (1965), 12 O'Clock High (1964), Rauchende Colts (1955), Combat! (1962), Hondo (1967), Bonanza (1959), and Im wilden Westen (1952), in addition to the films Der Tag der Abrechnung (1966), \"Mosby's Marauders\" (1966) and Hängt ihn höher (1968). It was his appearance in this last movie that would ultimately lead him into the role of \"Dan Williams\" on Hawaii Fünf-Null (1968). When Leonard Freeman found himself looking for a replacement to play the complex sidekick to Jack Lord's powerful \"Steve McGarrett\", he went looking for the young actor he remembered from just two or three days' work on his low-budget spaghetti Western. The juxtaposition of MacArthur's still-boyish good looks with his ability to bring a convincing toughness and sincerity to the role made him one of the best-remembered and well-admired actors of 1960s and 1970s popular television. Even today, more than twenty years after the program stopped production, it is broadcast in syndication in markets all over the world. Its \"Book 'im, Danno\" catchphrase is still as much a part of our popular culture as that famed line from another show of the same era: \"Beam me up, Scotty\". Departing \"Five-O\" prior to its 12th and final season, MacArthur's appearances became less frequent, yet still memorable. He was featured in such popular television shows as Love Boat (1977), Vegas (1978), Fantasy Island (1977), and Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984) and starred in two made-for-television movies: Irwin Allen's The Night the Bridge Fell Down (1980) and Alcatraz (1980). His poignant portrayal of hapless \"Walt Stomer\" in the latter provided a fine example that his skills as an actor had not waned in the 25 years since that first television appearance. He concentrated on the stage for a while then, performing in productions such as \"Arsenic and Old Lace\", \"A Bedfull of Foreigners\" and \"Love Letters\", as well as the occasional live appearance at charity and celebrity sporting events. In 1998, after nearly a decade away from television screens, he took up the role of \"Frank Del Rio\" in the Family Channel movie Storm Chasers - Im Auge des Sturms (1998). With the new century, MacArthur returned to a more active professional schedule, continuing to make a number of personal appearances to sign autographs and greet fans, as well as several speaking engagements such as northeast Ohio's \"One Book, Two Counties: An Evening With James MacArthur\", The Cinema Audio Society Annual Awards Banquet and AdventureCon in Knoxville, Tennessee. In addition, he has been featured in several television specials and interview programs, including Emme & Friends, Entertainment Tonight (1981), Inside TVLand, and Christopher Closeup. The increasing popularity of the DVD market has seen the re-release of Dschungel der 1000 Gefahren (1960) with a new behind-the-scenes documentary narrated by MacArthur and a lengthy on-screen interview covering many aspects of his career. Planned for re-release in July 2003, the 1956 version of Anastasia (1956) is expected to include an on-screen interview with MacArthur discussing his mother, Helen Hayes, and her work in that movie. April 2003 marked his return to the stage as \"Father Madison\" in Joe Moore's original play Dirty Laundry. On 6 November 2003, the Hawaii International Film Festival chose James MacArthur and Hawaii Fünf-Null (1968) as the recipient of their annual \"Film in Hawaii\" award, an honor both well-deserved and especially significant, coming as it did from the people and the State of Hawaii. Plans were being made to feature MacArthur in a new television series set in the Hawaiian Islands, though nothing more definitive had ever been arranged."
