Mrs. Alma Williams was born in Sandusky, Wis., January1st, 1879 and died at her home in Moro January 26th, 1901, after a lingering illness with consumption, age 22 years and 25 days. In November 20, 1898 she was married to Clyde Williams, who preceded her to the glory about three months. Williams was converted several years ago, and united with the UB Church, of which she was a faithful member till death, when the Lord called her from the church militant to the church triumphant. She always performed her duty faithfully. She was ever ready to assist in whatever she found to do and will be greatly missed. Her end was peace; for the Lord was her shepherd. The close of her life was full of hope, and reliance on the promise of God. She was looking forward to her final reward. She leaves sorrowing parents, three brothers, three sisters and other relatives, and friends to mourn their loss, but their loss is her eternal gain. –Dearest daughter you have left us, And our loss we deeply feel. But ’tis God that has bereft us He can call our sorrows heal. Sister here your place is vacant. Vacant in our hearts and home, But in heaven it is taken Where the Savior bade you come. Yes, we know you are in heaven, While we’re left to sorrow here But the joys that shall be given, There will wipe away our tears.\n\nFebruary 15, 1901\n\nDeath of S.P. Ornduff. Samuel P.

One little pair of feet are still That a few days ago were so light. Our hearts are sad and dreary, Tho’ the fire burns warm and bright, For we miss our dear little Edwin Around our hearth tonight.

Brief Masonic services were conducted at the grave, the first work of the kind of our new lodge. The funeral procession which followed the remains to the cemetery was the largest seen here for years. Business in the city was suspended during the hours of the sad last rites. Many friends sympathize with the sorrowing relatives in this most trying hour, but the power that gave life to frail humanity has always called loved ones away from earthly scenes, and will continue to do so until time shall be nor more. We cannot understand the ways of Omnipotence. It is not necessary that we should. When the final summons comes let us all be as well prepared to obey as was our Brother Cushman.

Buckham and Hon. B.F. Milkey, of the State Normal School.\n\nAugust 23, 1901\n\nMiss Molesworth’s letter on the death of Miss Maude Belshee is a tender tribute to a lovely character, a model woman and a true christian.

They were only out about five minutes when they heard Mable, their other little girl, cry out that Bertha was burning.

[Etta]\n\nMay 2, 1902\n\nMay 9, 1902\n\nThe south bound CS Ry train ran over and killed an unknown man, lying between the rails, in a short curve, about half a mile north of Kent, Monday afternoon. Coroner Idleman, accompanied by Dr. Goffin, drove to the scene and proceeded to hold an inquest. The verdict of the jury was suicide. The position of the body on the track clearly indicated that deceased had premeditated the deed, having braced himself to receive full force of the shocking collision. The body was fearfully mangled. Deceased was a young man apparently about 5 ft. 4 inches of stature, weighing perhaps 130 lbs, light curly hair, light blue eyes, small round chin, small nose, sandy mustache, small soft hands. He had been seen in the vicinity the better part of the day, but nobody knew him and there was nothing upon his person to lead to identification.

Suddenly and unushered, death stalked in the new and comfortable home of M.H. Poole Sunday afternoon rendering that happy circle inconsolably stricken — taking away the good wife and mother with no warning of the sorrowful incident. The news spread rapidly through the city and many were the hearts sickened at the recital and instantly extended in sympathy to those in distress. Death always carries with it grief and sorrow, no matter how it comes, but in this instance it is doubly deplorable. Mrs. Poole was a most gentle and estimable woman, universally loved in the neighborhood where she was known so well. It is a sad blow to the husband, and doubly so for the daughters, who are deprived of a mother’s loving care and companionship. The funeral took place in Moro ME Church, under the auspices of the Rebecca and Odd Fellow orders, of which Mr. and Mrs. Poole were members. The church was filled, and the discourse by Rev. Hoskinson was very impressive. Touching upon the Orders here so largely represented today the speaker said that “Odd Fellowship and Rebekah lodges were designed to comfort the sick and take care of the orphan; to provide a passport or letter of introduction, when among strangers in a strange city; it was a temporal institution, to look after the present welfare of members and not like the church, provide in any sense a spiritual future. Odd Fellowship and Rebekahs had to look to the churches for spiritual comfort.” At the grave the beautiful burial service was recited closing with the Rebekah funeral hymn: Sister thou wast mild and lovely, Gentle as the summer breeze, Pleasant as the air of evening, When it floats among the trees. Peaceful by the silent slumber, Peaceful in the grave so low, Thou no more shalt join our number Thou no more our songs shalt know. Yet again we hope to meet thee, When the day of life hath flown, And in heaven we hope to greet thee Where no farewell tear is known.

Last Tuesday evening Attorney R.E. Hoskinson of this city was so suddenly stricken unto death by heart failure at his residence that it was utterly impossible to secure any aid whatever, and it is very certain that aid would have availed nothing as the messenger of death came as the lightning’s stroke comes, and as quickly the white-winged spirit of our friend took its departure to the land where no shadows fall upon the scene. “Asleep in Jesus, blessed sleep from which none ever waken to weep.” The funeral was largely attended from the ME Church Wednesday afternoon, business and the schools having suspended during the time. Reverends Evans and Elder each paid worthy tribute to the high moral character and manhood of deceased. To his wife and infant, to his little orphaned boy, and to all sorrowing friends, The Observer extends heart felt sympathy, in the midst of their great sorrow.

Two shots were fired, but one, it is thought, was produced by nerve reaction as the body fell to the floor.\n\nThere was a large turnout at the funeral of T. Belchee Monday. A more sympathetic and heart felt attendance is seldom assembled. School mates, and associates from boyhood, old men and women, who had know Jim all his life, shed tears of sorrow at his grave. None knew the deceased but to love him. He had faults, but who has not? but at heart James Belchee was an honest faithful friend. The funeral was conducted under auspices of the Odd Fellows, at Moro ME Church, Rev. Elder preaching a memorable sermon.

His trouble was teethings and bowel complaint.—-P.S. — Alas, Hope told a flattering story. Wednesday evening the little Love and Death departed together, leaving us all in sorrow. [DeWitt Lewis Ireland]\n\nOctober 30, 1903\n\nThat was a sweet, sad funeral, from Moro ME Church last Friday, when dear little Lewis, son of Abbie and Francis Ireland was laid to rest. The little coffin was buried in flowers, and four little girls dressed in white acted as pall bearers. Evans prayer, Rev. Elder’s talk, and the soft music of the choir was touching, tending to relax sorrowing hearts with the hope of again meeting the lost one where no sorrow is known. On behalf of the stricken parents and sad kindred, we take occasion to say that cold type cannot possibly convey to the many kind neighbors and friends in any sense the gratitude we all feel for attentions bestowed during this trying ordeal.\n\nNovember 6, 1903\n\nand Mrs. C.E.

About noon today, while coming to Biggs with a load of wheat, Willis Gallaway, who has been working on the farm of Mr. Harding, was accidentally shot. V. Harding, a young man, who was riding with Gallaway, had a loaded shotgun. Some sacks of wheat were about to fall from the wagon, and young Harding handed the gun to Gallaway while he replaced the sacks. He had just left the seat, when he heard the report of a gun, and looked around in time to see Gallaway fall. The charge entered Gallaway’s arm, just above the elbow, ranging upward, shattering the bone and badly lacerating the arm. Gallaway was brought to Biggs. The arm will have to be amputated at the shoulder. He was taken to the Dalles.\n\nNovember 20, 1903\n\nWillis Gallaway, the young man who was shot at Biggs and whose arm was amputated died in The Dalles hospital. The body was taken to Hillsboro for burial.

Mrs. Kunsman was very highly respected by all who knew her, and the attendance at the funeral which was held in Moro ME Church Monday forenoon, attested her worth. Rev.

Drowned In The Icy Waters of The John Day River, While Hunting. N. McCaleb was drowned in the John Day river Wednesday afternoon Feb. 3d, presumably while swimming out from the shore after a wild goose which he had shot. With Henry Wright, Mr. McCaleb was working on his homestead until about 4 p.m. of the above date, at which time he left camp, saying he wanted to shoot some geese. Not returning, a search was made for him with the result of finding his horse and gun, a dead goose, and his clothing, which looked as if he had stripped himself while running towards the river, as the garments were scattered from his gun and the goose to near the river’s edge. Search was kept up for the body, Thursday and Friday, a rope having been stretched across the river to which a boat was secured, with occupants using hooks to drag the bottom of the river,. By this means the body was found about noon Friday, by Ira Axtell and Roy Hulse. The remains were brought to Moro and a coroner’s jury, composed of R.J. Ginn, W.B. McCoy, G.W. Brock, A.N. Montgomery, J.M. Dunahoo, and J.B. Mowry, rendered a verdict of accidental drowning. Opinions differ as to whether deceased took with a cramp or, being over heated, the cold water was too much for his heart action. Where Mr. McCaleb entered the water to 70 yards below, where his body was found, the depth averages from 5 to 7 feet across the river with a rather heavy current, the water being icy cold. The remains were taken to Monmouth for interment at which place the parents of Mr. and Mrs. McCaleb reside. Deceased leaves a wife and child in Moro, and parents in Monmouth to whom, in this hour of trouble, The Observer extends the sympathy of the community. CORONERS INQUEST. Coroner Ray W. Logan held an inquest over the remains, Friday evening, the jury at which returned a verdict of accidental drowning. The principal witnesses were Henry Wright and Frank Sayrs. HENRY WRIGHT. Testified “I have been acquainted with the deceased for over five years. I went over on the John Day to help him haul lumber for his homestead on Tuesday morning last. I was working on his homestead all Wednesday forenoon, and in the afternoon, between 4 and 5 o’clock, he took his gun and horse and crossed the John Day river for the purpose of shooting geese. I heard him shoot several times. He did not return that night and next morning (Thursday) we searched for him along the river, with the result that his clothing was found near the water’s edge, also his rifle and a dead goose. We continued our search for him, and early in the afternoon of Friday we found his body in the river.” FRANK SAYRS. Testified: “I went over to the John Day river to help search for the body as I had heard of his being drowned while goose hunting. A short time after 11 o’clock this morning Feb. 5th, we found the clothes of the deceased near the river on the Gilliam county side, also his gun, a sweater and a dead goose. They looked as if he had taken them off before going into the river. After searching awhile along the river we found the body in the river about 50 feet from the bank, and in about 5 feet of water. It was about 75 yards below where we found his clothes. The body had on a pair of drawers and a pair of socks.” Sunday evening Rev. SC Elder preached a memorial sermon in the Presbyterian church, which was a worthy tribute to a worthy man, whose sudden death should be a warning to others not to run into any kind of danger.

Dr. Guisendorffer of the Dalles and Dr. Taylor of Grass Valley, assisted Dr. Ray W. Logan of this city, in a very critical operation Tuesday in the case of Mrs. A. N. Montgomery. The patient failed to rally after the operation and death followed Wednesday afternoon, rending one of the happiest homes in Sherman county desolate. The funeral was held in the M.E. Church yesterday afternoon, attended by a large and a sad gathering of friends and neighbors. Mrs. Montgomery was the daughter of Hon. W.H. Moore, who is stricken with grief at the sorrowful event. Deceased is survived by a husband whose sorrowing heart is buoyed by the tenderest sympathy of all who know him, also by two lovable children, a little girl three years old and a sweet baby daughter, about one month old, little darlings that can never know a mothers’ love. Mrs. Montgomery was truly a most estimable lady and the community mourns her death. [Mabel Moore]\n\nApril 1, 1904\n\nDeath of Miss Mary Peoples.

Touching Tribute to the Memory of Miss Mary Peoples. (Communicated.) Leaves have their time to fall, And flowers to wither at the north wind’s breath, And stars to set – but all, Thou hast all seasons for thine own, Oh, Death! The truthfulness of Death’s untimely visitations, as portrayed in the last lines, were never more forcibly felt than when the sad news was flashed over the wires from Spokane last week that Miss Mary Peoples lay cold in the icy embrace of death in that city. It was not wholly unexpected, but it was hard for her numerous friends to realized the truth of sorrowful announcement. Harder still to think that genial Miss Mary would no longer brighten loving circles in Moro with her presence. Indeed, does Death love a “shining mark,” and such he found in our departed friend. Her heart, the receptacle of all that was true, noble and good, won for her the love of all who were so fortunate as to know her. No shadows ever lingered in her presence. An undercurrent of quiet humor; which she could so well adapt to all circumstances, made sunshine reign wherever she went. Truly None knew her but to love her, None named her but to praise. The funeral in Moro M. E. Church was a very sad service. John Evans, assisted by Rev. S. C. Elder conducted the ceremony. The church was draped in the emblems of mourning with a profusion of cut flowers and potted plants about the altar. Mesdames McPherson, Bright, Porter and Edgington were among the friends present from Wasco, bringing several choice calla lilies as a last tribute to their departed colaborer in the good work of the WCTU, and kindred organizations.\n\nA Card of Thanks. By request of Mr. Montgomery and the sorrowing ones stricken with him at the loss of his loving wife, Mrs. Mabel Moore Montgomery, The Observer attempts to return sincere thanks to all the many loving friends who, in the midst of this affliction, did so much to relieve the distress at the death and burial of Mrs. Montgomery. Resolutions of Condolence. Whereas, In the providence of God our beloved sister, Mabel Moore Montgomery, has been called to her heavenly home; Be it Resolved, That we bow in submission to our heavenly fathers will, and out of the darkness may we hear the Master, saying: “What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shall know hereafter.” Resolved, That we bear our testimony to the noble character and consecrated life of the deceased, who, in loyalty to the church, and in devotion to every good work, truly did not live for self, but for the glory of God and for the good of others. Resolved, That while our hearts go in sympathy for the husband and the loved ones in their bereavement, that we also lift up our voices in prayer to God for his sustaining grace and presence in this dark hour of need. Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be kept in the minute book of the church and that they be published in The Observer.

At a quarter past eight o’clock Sunday evening Martin Clum walked out of Wiley’s saloon at Kent, crossed the street, drew a pistol and shot himself in the right temple. Several saw him do the deed and a crowd quickly gathered around him as he lay where he had fallen. Death was instantaneous and as soon as those present were assured nothing could be done for him the body was carried into the old post office building, where it lay while a messenger was sent for Coroner Logan. On the arrival of the coroner, who was accompanied by Attorney Littlefield, a jury was impaneled, the following verdict being brought in after weighing the evidence in the case; “We the jury impaneled by the Coroner of Sherman county, to ascertain the cause of death of Martin Clum, find that the deceased came to his death as the result of a pistol shot fired by himself with suicidal intent. (Signed) Joseph Walton, Geo. A. Sink, Wm. Rudolf, J.H. Bottemiller, R. W. Montgomery, John J. Schaffer.” Mr. Clum has been a resident of this county, with the exception of a year spent near Prineville, for six years past: first working for Johnson, south of Moro. For the last two years he has been located at Kent and was under bonds to appear at the next term of the circuit court to answer a charge of robbing a saloon at Kent. This charge has worried him a good deal and he has often been heard to say that he would commit suicide, but his friends never thought he was serious in the matter until Sunday evening when he committed the rash deed.\n\nThe Last Farewell. William Thomas Tomlin died at the home of his parents in this city Saturday afternoon at 4:27 o’clock and was buried in Moro cemetery from the Methodist Episcopal church at 11 o’clock Sunday morning. Rev Stull of Grass Valley, officiating at the services. The church was filled by sorrowing and sympathetic friends before the funeral cortege arrived, escorted by Messrs. Henry Whitely, L. Barnum, F. M. Smith, D. Heydt, John Biggerstaff, and W. St Johns who acted as pallbearers. Several floral wreaths and bouquets were placed on the casket by friends as a last tribute to the deceased. In his remarks Rev. Still called attention to the Christian faith which in the greatest hour of need is always such a staff to sorrowing hearts made heavy by grief, helping them to bear the burden with the hope of meeting beyond. The text “Now is the Harvest Time,” compared the spiritual harvest with the material harvest; saying some flowers are allowed to ripen and mature while others are plucked and crushed under foot; why, we know not. “Pete” Tomlin, as he was familiarly named by all who knew him, was born in Missouri, October 28, 1878, being 26 years of age when the grim summons came. He, with his parents, moved to Moro in 1888 and has resided in this vicinity ever since, with the exception of the last two years when he has been working in Morrow county and for Elrod & Moore on their Horse Heaven farm. He came home the Wednesday before his death suffering from rheumatic fever, but the disease had gained such a hold that it could not be eradicated, running into brain fever, and he gave way under its ravages. Willie was one of the pioneer boys of Moro, went to school here, and has lived to see the town grow from a small hamlet to its present proportion and municipal ownership of public franchisees. He had up to within three months of his death carried an insurance policy in the AOUW in favor of his mother, but had thoughtlessly let it lapse. He was a good boy, a kind comrade, a dutiful and loving son. He faced much promise of a useful life, but was cut down, as is the beautiful flower, ere fruitage time had come. Such a boy will be missed and to those who will miss him most The Observer extends the sympathy of the entire community in their hour of sorrow.\n\nCard of Thanks. We desire to thank all the people of this vicinity, through the columns of the Sherman County Observer, for the many acts of kindness and sympathy shown us during our recent bereavement.

In some manner while signaling to the engineer Mr. H. fell and was run over by the tender before it could be stopped, the wheels severing the right leg at the hip. The unfortunate man was conscious from the time of the accident until anesthetics were given at the hospital but he never recovered from its effects, the loss of blood and the shock to the system having been too great. Mrs. Haley, them Miss Ginn, visited in Moro last year and has a number of friends here who are shocked at the loss sustained by her.\n\nSeptember 2, 1904\n\nSeptember 9, 1904\n\nThe Watts Marble Works of The Dalles has erected a family monument at Rose cemetery on the James family plot to commemorate the last resting place of G.

Annie Bell Henton, daughter of Major L and Alice White, was born January 20th, 1868, at Marincie, Lenawee county, Mich. Her mother died when she was but a small child and her father had her cared for as best he could until he was married the second time. The family moved to Oregon in 1874, making their home at Corvallis, Albany and Independence in the Willamette valley. She was married to Rev. M. F. S. Henton, at her father’s residence, in Independence, Polk county, Oregon, September 12th, 1888. They resided in Polk county until they moved to Sherman county, reaching here May 2, 1894, where they have since made their home. By this union there were seven children, viz: Dora Agnes, Edna Alice, Wiley Logan, Ray Fuller, Amos Omar, Nettie Eunice and Cassie Esther, who with her husband survive her. Mrs. H. was converted, which to her was a real experience, at the age of 17, and united with the Methodist. In April, 1890, she united with the Baptist church and was baptized by her husband. She remained in fellowship with this denomination to the time of her death. Mrs. Henton was unassuming in her manner yet made lasting friends on every hand, she was a devoted wife, a model mother, a good temperance and Sunday school worker, an excellent singer, and an earnest consecrated Christian. She manifested great patience and an unshaken confidence in her Saviour during her illness. She realized every thing to the last, calling her loved ones to her bed side only short time before she died, biding them good bye and telling them she was going where Jesus was. After an illness of about one year, with consumption, she departed this life, September 26th, 1904, in Grass Valley, Oregon, at the age of 36 years, 8 months and 6 days. The funeral was preached in the Baptist church by Rev. Wm. Nortridge, from 2d Timothy, 4th chapter, 6th and 8th verses, after which the body was interred in the Odd Fellows Cemetery. She leaves her husband and children, two brothers and two sisters, a number of relatives and a host of friends to mourn her loss.\n\nThe little one born to Mr. and Mrs. J.K. Craig in Antelope, was taken from them by death on the 29th. The Herald says the sad parents have the deep sympathy of the community in the loss of this little one, whose appearance in their home less than two weeks before promised them so much happiness.\n\nOctober 14, 1904\n\nOctober 21, 1904\n\nAn unknown made his end of miss spent life at Rufus this week, a suicide, by hanging.\n\nOctober 28, 1904\n\nW.H.

Death visits the home of W.D. Smith of Dufur. Death in any form is sad. But when it comes as it did in Dufur, Tuesday evening, and removes the mother of four little ones of tender age it is more than sad. Tamar Smith, sister of Mrs. Laura Thomas Ireland, was stricken with typhoid, and while the physicians, nurses, and relatives thought she would recover, and Mrs. Ireland returned to Moro Tuesday, the final message came at 8 pm and Leonard and Laura left early Wednesday to aid the stricken father in his sorrow, and make arrangements for the funeral rites. Alas: When the parted streams of life Join beyond all jarred strife, And the flowers that withered lay Blossom in immortal May — When the voices hushed and dear Thrill once more the raptured ear, We shall feel and know and see God knew better far than we.\n\nNovember 25, 1904\n\nIn Memoriam. Intensely Sad Ceremonials at the Burial of Mrs. Smith. Mrs. Tamar Thomas Smith, whose sad death in Dufur was reported in The Observer last week, was buried from Moro M.E. church Wednesday evening, November 17th, the remains having been conveyed by teams, accompanied by sorrowing friends, over a long, tedious drive from Dufur. Friends in Moro had decorated the chancel for the occasion, and assisted by Rev. Evans and a full choir in harmony with the surroundings Rev. Adams delivered an eloquent sermon. Smith leaves a husband, Wm D. Smith, and four children here, a father, Samuel Thomas, and sister, Mrs. Charles Anderson, at Randall, Minnesota, sister, Mrs. Laura Ireland, at Moro, and a brother, Frank Thomas, at Little Falls, Minnesota, to mourn her death. Mrs. Smith was born August, 1872, near Mt. Brydges, Ontario, Canada, moving when young with her parents to Minnesota, where she grew to womanhood. She was married at Little Falls, Minnesota, to W.D. Smith, July 2, 1892, they continuing to reside in that state until their removal this year. Though a resident of Dufur but a short time, Mrs. Smith endeared herself to a large number of friends, who were painfully shocked at her untimely demise, and they extend their sympathy to the sorrowing relatives. Speak not of death, Nor count that loss Which plucks from earth A flower to bloom in Heaven. * * * * Birth is a mystery, Life gives no one its key, But this grim messenger, This ceaseless wanderer. What does he call us to When we are gone? What brings he to our view. — Sunset or dawn?\n\nAddie Thompson, brother of Mrs. N.W. Thompson, died of typhoid on the 18th, in Brandon, Manitoba hospital.

McDonald answered Death’s Summons in the Dalles Sunday, and the funeral was held in Wasco, 7th, many Sherman county friends and neighbors attending. All of his suffering are now at an end. His loss throws a pall over the settlement where he has lived so many years, with great open heart and hand, ever ready to relieve distress of others, and many mourn with his sorrowing family in sincere affection. Well might our generous friend have said with the poet – Good night, old world. Good bye to all your joys, Your sorrows, pleasures, passions, pomps and noise. I leave you for the eternal silence of the stars — The deafness of unbounded space, where bars No longer hold the soul in durance vile. Where naught can wound and nothing can defile. There the pure spirit shall despise the things The sense on earth hath loved. On wings Bathed in the ether of eternity — How sweet to feel from every passion free! And yet — it is an awful leap to take Into the great unknown! Perchance to wake To greater woes, indeed, than those we have And hoped to bury in the silent grave.

We have been called upon to write some expression of the feelings of thankfulness actuating the hearts of our friends, Mr. and Mrs. W.J. Martin, to those who so generously extended the helping hand and the tender sympathy, at the death and burial of their infant, Roy. What pathos there is, surrounding the birth, the life, the death and burial of that sweet little innocent, all in less than one week. His birth occasioned much rejoicing, but so brief its life, ending so gloomily that it racked and distracted the families in two counties. Baby Roy was a child of much more than ordinary promise. But the key to the riddle of his life, could he have lived, is safely hidden away, like the little garment he was clothed with, unfolding only memories of his bright little existence, and that last beseeching look as he sank away to his final rest, so pure, so loved. — How sweeter than words that the Angels say, is the Love that lives forever, “He rests in God.” “Tis all we heed, The mold’ring stone reveals no more. “In God.” Of other words what need? These span the broad eternal shore. Sleep on, sleep on, thou pulseless heart Where jasmine stars drop golden rain, From every troubled thought apart, Forgotten every earthly pain. Sleep on, thy long repose is sweet, Tender and cool the grassy sod. O, trav’ler; stay thy hurrying feet — Step softly here. “He rests in God.”\n\nGus Porchet was called to Portland to attend the funeral of his sister, who died Saturday.

Smith, six miles south of Moro. The family were recently from the Willamette valley, and the remains were taken to Jefferson for burial. One of the greatest losses any family suffers is the removal from its midst of the good old mother who have come in and out among children with their sweet kindly faces and old-fashioned ways, and to who all looked for counsel for so many years. Such a one was called to her eternal rest at the death of Mrs. Lynes. To the bereaved ones we tender our sympathies.\n\nMarch 10, 1905\n\nGrandpa Vinton, long and well known in this country, died in Portland on the 3d, aged 75 years.

Upon the loss of such a father; how precious the thought — There is no death! The stars go down To rise upon some fairer shore, And bright in heaven’s jeweled crown They shine forevermore. There is no death! But angle forms Walk o’er the earth with silent tread; They bear our best loved things away, And then we call them dead.\n\nAlma M. Patterson, mother of Mrs. C.A. Buckley, died on the 4th in her 75th year. The funeral occurred in Grass Valley Sunday, and the remains were taken to Portland Monday for interment.\n\nA little child of Thos.
