        "text": "Our bodies are the convergence zones of past, present and future, and carry physical and emotional wounds for us, waiting for both healing and integration of change. We often experience multilayered shame about our bodies: we find our health, our strength, resiliency and well-being, or our physical appearance insufficient to the task of life. Are there ways to use our different shames to reveal our deepest wisdom? How can constellation work support this exploration? Join Sarah Peyton for a 3-day, 15-hour workshop to investigate the leverage constellation work can bring us in these areas.\n\nConstellations are a way of unwinding and unraveling the frozen strands of trauma and buried nervous-system vows from our essential beings, so that we can flourish, live, and contribute our gifts with ease. In this series, we will use constellations and learning about constellation facilitation as frames through which to investigate how our work with our deepest wounds opens us to contribute most fully with others, and the ways in which our shame is a doorway that helps us to discover this pattern in our lives and in our bodies. Join Sarah Peyton for this exploration of what neuroscience and constellations can do for us.\n\nThis is part 3 of a 3-part constellation masterclass series on woundedness and shame. You are welcome to register for any of the three individual events in the 3-part series; however, registering for the full 3-part immersion might be a good fit if you’d like to learn to use constellations in your work or your life, as well as receive access to the bonuses and savings.\n\nOver this 3-day workshop series participants will:\n\nDiscover the multiple layers of body-connected shame\n\nRelease contracts that prevent us from fully inhabiting and enjoying our bodies and our sexuality/emergence\n\nWork with 3-5 mini-constellations that support the exploration of the relationship between the body and woundedness and healing work.\n\nLook for relic-patterns from infancy that depress our life energy\n\nWork with the foundational skills of constellation facilitation\n\nImprove constellation facilitation confidence, humility and practices for general practice\n\nHave the opportunity to participate in a large-group constellation facilitated by Sarah\n\nHave the opportunity to participate in a large-group constellation facilitated by a student and supported by Sarah\n\nHave multiple opportunities to be in lotteries to be a client or to student-facilitate large group constellations\n\nThe schedule will be as follows (All times are in the Pacific Time zone.
