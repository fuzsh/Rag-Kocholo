        "text": "Return to main page\n\nPart VII. Discussion and Conclusions\n\nOutside of Time: The Art of the Liminal Realm\n\nNorte Chico Artifact, Peru, 2250 BCE , on the left is the earliest known depiction of the serpent-jaguar Andean Staff god or goddess, the main Andean deity for thousands of years, that was displayed in the context of Twisted Gourd symbolism (Haas et al., 2003; summa, Piscitelli, 2014; Staller, Stosser, 2013). (Photographer: Jonathan Haas, Fields Museum. The image of the Twisted Gourd symbol has been rotated 90 degrees and slightly enhanced by contrast to eliminate glare. This form is stylistically referred to as Greek keys and stepped frets in the tDAR Mimbres Pottery Digital Database: see 2085, 2277, 8014, 3665).\n\nTop: The great cosmic serpent comprising a series of interlocked Twisted Gourd symbols on a Mimbres Mogollon vessel 750-1000 CE from the Wind Mountain site on the upper Gila (image courtesy of tDAR 8014). Bottom: Vessels showing the great serpent of the Anasazi Puebloans and the Mogollon in his Heshanavaiya form as Snake-Antelope, a sun-water construct (“life giving,” author of the sacred directions and semi-divine human rulers), Left, Pueblo Bonito c. Pueblo II; Right, Mattocks site c. 1000-1150 CE, Mimbres Mogollon culture (courtesy of Maxwell Museum).\n\nThe View from “30,000 Feet”\n\nThere is no doubt that the ancestral Puebloans (formerly “Anasazi”) of the American southwest participated in the cosmology and cosmogony known to the Maya divine kings who descended from the Feathered Serpent and revered it as their divine ancestor, the source of life, death, and resurrection, and the source of prosperity. That said, many data gaps remain, and much interpretive material requires clarification, as the story of Twisted Gourd symbolism unfolds over a period of nearly four thousand years and over 4,000 miles.\n\nThe miracle is that Puebloan tribes such as the Hopi and Keres still understand the symbolism and preserve Twisted Gourd symbolism in their art and ritual. Besides Twisted Gourd symbolism, one very significant story, in particular, involving a stone artifact called the tcamahia (tsamaiya), may signify the historical inflection point at which the earliest corn cultures in the American southwest, the Basketmakers, who possessed the sacred stone, were transformed into social hierarchies where Twisted Gourd symbolism prevailed to establish an ideology of hereditary rulership, whose elite warriors also owned the tcamahia. Perhaps its symbolism had been hijacked by a new group of corn people, which is what the Zuni origin myth suggests, or at least a new mythology had been associated with the tcamahia, on the way to establishing a hierarchical social order.\n\nFrom a “big picture” view, it appears that ownership of the tcamahia was equated with authority and social order, and was the means of bridging myth, time, and culture as multiple tribes speaking at least five or six languages came together to build the spectacular Great Houses in Chaco Canyon. It is an amazing story of the development of civilization in the semi-arid regions of the American southwest through a gathering of tribes under one theology of the provision of water and light as mediated by a divine one who had been born to rule. Hopefully, an intrepid and patient student will follow its trail and further illuminate the role of the mythical Hero War Twins, the sons of the sun and grandchildren of the great cosmic water serpent, who were kin to the Mesoamerican Hero Twins and gave the Puebloan Tcamahia Snake chief, the twin of the ruling Antelope Sun Priest, the magic weapon, which formerly had been an agricultural hoe of the ancestors.\n\nThese findings offer an unparalleled window into the religious-political beliefs of a pan-Amerindian cosmovision that was associated with Twisted Gourd symbolism and the rise of early hierarchically structured agricultural societies, which was based on the belief that one class or race of people, which by the rise of the Maya had been refined to the idea of one bloodline, had been born to rule. As readers might agree after reaching the end of this study, this idea of an authoritarian religious-political aristocracy that embodied a deity is also seen worldwide in the social elites of Semitic cultures of the Middle East, the Habsburg kings and queens of Europe, and even in the racial elitism of American slave owners who interpreted biblical texts to mean that the Creator had intended for the world to be ruled by white Christian men who were “the body of Christ.” The idea of the incarnate deity united heaven and earth and produced the abundance by which humankind could survive and prosper. Interestingly, the quadripartite equal-arm cross worn by kings, priests, and warriors is seen nearly universally as the symbol for this cosmically ordained earthly authority, whether the bearer was a Moche or Maya ruler representing the law-and-order function of the cosmic Serpent c. 300 BCE–900 CE or an American Klansman asserting the law-and-order function of the Christian church in the United States c. 2020 CE. The cross signified a cosmic imprint on the earth, both in the form of a cosmic Tree of Life in the vertical direction and the soltitial paths of the sun on the horizontal plane. Equally interesting is the fact that earthly authority was mediated through a sacred mountain in the context of a vertically triadic cosmos unified by the Tree of Life, which, although now reduced to a metaphysical metaphor in Western traditions, remains to this day a physical fact in the indigenous religion of the Americas as encoded in the Twisted Gourd symbol. In that sense, the Twisted Gourd symbol as a Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud/lightning origin narrative of social elites localized in a cosmic Centerpoint, the navel of the earth from which all directions (“roads”) extend and return, is the alpha point from which extends the many cultural narratives that comprise the work of Americanist archaeologists and ethnographers. Although a multitude of cultural nuances disguise the alpha point, in terms of an animating core belief in what constituted a legitimate central authority, there is little difference between the autocratic Maya king who traced his lineage back to the cosmic Serpent and a founding ancestor from the first days of the new creation and a Hebrew king who traced his lineage through Abraham back to Adam and the origin story of the new earth in Genesis. In other words, the core elements of an origin story, a mytho-cosmology of world creation, ordering, human origins, and ruling authority, share interesting parallels that may possibly suggest that we may be looking at a global myth of the early agricultural societies whose founders had traveled across multiple continents using the same navigational stars the ancestral Puebloans had used to get their bearings, which became gods of war, providence, water, and light (see celestial House of the North). Or, maybe people who had in common a knowledge of astronomy and a set of common problems associated with growing seeds came up with similar ideas about origins. Whatever the case, first we have to look at the myth and a shared symbolism that was associated with the development of civilization among the earliest agricultural societies in the Americas.\n\nFrom the beginning, the earliest known religious art of the Americas displayed by the earliest known civilization of the Americas at Caral, Peru, developed as the art of the liminal world of myth where human ancestors, their identity hybridized with the spirits of plants and a trinity of archetypal animal lords, would be instructed by the gods to serve as priestly intermediaries between the temporal material world and the eternal liminal realm that gave birth to the visible and regenerated its mortal remains. The Twisted Gourd symbol is the earliest known example of design as agency on durable surfaces–gourds, stone monuments, ceramics– that will come to represent a religious-political cosmovision of social theocracy of the early agricultural communities that saw the Milky Way as a cosmic Serpent with both a radiant and a hidden nature that materialized as clouds and lightning to unify the triadic realms and sustain its jewel of a center, the earth. Twisted Gourd symbolism has endured for over 5,000 years as the symbolic language of America’s indigenous cosmovision. It is currently preserved as the life-way of the descendants of the Anasazi Puebloans who lived in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, where one of the earliest complex societies in North America will surely be ranked among the most capable of Mesoamerica’s architects and masons, work that signified a complementary Maker (Designer)-Modeler (Doer) pair that was the Maya’s first name of the cosmic Serpent as the creative agency that was embodied in Kukulcan, the quetzal-bird–Serpent (Tedlock, 1996: 63).\n\nThe Designer-Doer dyad as the name and agency of the sovereign source of knowledge and sustainer of life was reflected in the sovereign Plumed Serpent’s Heart of Sky-Heart of Earth construct, the axis mundi that bloomed as the Tree of Life. The same construct was also reflected in the deity : human dyad of hereditary rulership as the form of governance mediated by the divine ancestors of kings, or by whatever title the Doer at the peak of the social pyramid, literally represented by the Twisted Gourd symbol–the stepped abode of the ancestral Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud ideogram–was known. The sacred name of the cosmic Plumed Serpent, whose antecedent was South America’s feathered amaru (“big snake”), was one of the ethnographic cultural markers that tracked with the archaeological marker of the Twisted Gourd symbol as the Maker-Doer cosmovision– the Sky-Earth construct that connected cosmic agency with humanity in the sacred precinct at the heart of the ancestral Mountain/cave–moved north out of South America in the context of Twisted Gourd symbolism.\n\nThe Designer-Doer name of the supreme spiritual agency in the clouds of the Milky Way is still preserved among the Zuni Puebloans as Awon-a-wilona (Stevenson, 1904:88; Parsons, 1920:97 fn 2; Cushing, 1894:9), the Thinking cosmic Serpent as Sky Father, the Designer of the roads of life that extended from the axis mundi in the context of Twisted Gourd symbolism– the mythological narrative of the cosmic Centerpoint associated with hereditary rulership (divine ancestry). Among the Hopi Puebloans the Ancient of the Six Points as the axis mundi and source of warm winds (thought, speech, song, spirit, breath of life) was called Heshanavaiya/Four Winds, the horned Plumed Serpent and life-giver (Fewkes, 1894; Stevenson, 1904; Stirling, 1942). Among the Acoma Keres Puebloans the pan-Amerindian cosmogonic construct that from “four skies up” formed the axis mundi and generated the Corn mother in the heart of the earth was Tsichtinako (Stirling, 1942: 1:2, 25). While the ethnic name and narrative details of the Designer-Doer pair differed among the Puebloans, the most legendary being the Tsamaiya (tcamahia), a mytho-historical warrior medicine priest and namesake of Heshanavaiya, the father of the Snake-Antelopes, the semantics and function of the divine agency as the designer of the sacred roads, mytho-historical clan ancient as the ancestral doer in ritual, and cosmovision of an integrated universe where the radiant divine agency (unified sun-water nature of the cosmic Serpent) and its human Speaker remained distinct.\n\nThe fact that, in the context of Twisted Gourd symbolism, the Maya and the ancestral Puebloans shared the vertically triadic and horizontally quartered cosmos, the same concept for the six points of the sacred roads (directions), the same concept for a celestial House of the North from which extended the axis mundi, the same concept for the Maker-Doer creator that was integrally connected with the ancestry of an elite social stratum, the same Heart of Sky-Heart of Earth axis, the same concept for the apotheosis of a dead ruler who returned to the celestial House of the North as a revered ancestor, and the same concept of a cosmic circulatory system of “dew” and living breath that were aspects of the Plumed Serpent clearly indicate that the ideology of rulership that was based on the sacred directions through which “dew” as a blessed substance flowed was in fact the cosmovision of the centerplace–the Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud/lightning narrative– that was represented by the Twisted Gourd symbol. The documentary evidence that reconstructed the axis mundi of the ancestral Puebloans in this monograph as extending from celestial North parallels the architectural evidence from Pueblo Bonito that the “Ancients” also conceived of the axis mundi as extending from celestial North (Ashmore, 2008: 179, 184-186). With that being the case and in the context of Twisted Gourd symbolism we now have a clear picture of the Chacoan’s religious-political cosmovision and their basis of social hierarchy.\n\nThe fact that the ancestral Puebloan Snake-Antelope ceremony concerned itself with the birth of the sun around August 13, the date that the Mesoamericans celebrated the birth of the sun, has important implications. First, it adds ethnological evidence that the Zuni origin story (Cushing, 1896), which describes the creation of the sun via the Plumed Serpent, was shared with the Hopi and Keres. Second, since the first sunrise was associated with the beginning of time when the sacred directions authored by the Plumed Serpent gave shape to the cosmos and established the seasons, the Snake-Antelopes, by representing the unity of fire (sun, Antelopes, singers) and water (cosmic Serpent, Milky Way, warriors), surely occupied the top position in the social hierarchy since they were responsible for the life-death-resurrection paradigm. Third, these facts point back to the dynastic crypt at Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon and the identity of its occupants, who had all-but-certain Mogollon ties with the ceremonial complex observed further south in the Mogollon-Pueblo Blue Mountain Archaeological Zone. Fourth, two types of cranial modification distinguished the ruling family at Pueblo Bonito– occipital and lambdoid— which very strongly suggests that these are archaeological markers for the Antelopes and Snakes, respectively. The Snake-lambdoid association is all but certain, since the nearby Gallina were defined by the lambdoid cranial modification and by their numerous Snake towers; the association between the Snake chiefs and the Snake towers was established by the Snake origin story (Stephen, 1929). And finally, by identifying the Snake-Antelopes as central to ancestral Puebloan religion and governance, we have the origin myth, rituals, prayers, and addditional ethnological detail, such as for the Tcamahia warriors and the Hero/War Twins, that unlock our understanding of this unique civilization and places it in its international context. With the distinctive tcamahia artifact alone we are able to detect the presence of the Snake warriors across the ancient Puebloan landscape in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest. Since the Twisted Gourd indexical symbol internationally represented the ideology of rulership that governed the ancient agricultural civilizations, we can be certain that it was owned by the Snake-Antelopes at Pueblo Bonito.\n\nThe Sky-Earth Construct of the Ancestral Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud Lord with Snake-Jaguar Spirit Who Wore the Milky Way (Bicephalic Serpent) and Displayed the Twisted Gourd Symbol\n\nLeft, top to bottom: The Moche’s creator deity materialized as their dynastic patron and ancestor, Aia Paec, who wears interconnected Twisted Gourd symbols as a crown in the context of jaguar paws (ML002995, 200 BCE-600 CE); the double-headed serpent bar (royal scepter that materialized the cosmic Serpent/Milky Way river of life) derived from interconnected Twisted Gourd symbols–a Sky-Earth construct that inferred lightning– and pan-Amerindian emblem of divinely empowered rule through the cosmic bicephalic Serpent, Peru, (ML015591, 800-200 BCE).\n\nRight, top to bottom: Phallic male clay figurines decorated with interconnected Twisted Gourd symbols found at two Great Houses separated by 125 mi., Pueblo Bonito (Pepper, 1920: fig. 60;), Chaco Canyon, NM, and Mitchell Springs, Colorado (photo courtesy of David Dove, Four Corners Research, southwestern Colorado); right, bottom, The double-headed cloud-serpent bar as the sky-earth construct of Pueblo Bonito’s “Chaco signature” and their dominant dynastic visual program of Twisted Gourd symbolism (Bonito phase, 850-1150 CE) seen earlier in the Pueblo-Mogollon Blue Mountain archaeological zone, San Francisco phase 600-750 CE (Hough, 1914:fig. 126, map).\n\nTwisted Gourd symbolism comprised the primary Twisted Gourd (“Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud ancestral home”) in the context of the chakana, checkerboard, kan-k’in, double-headed Serpent bar, and lightning/thunder symbols. The facts of identical iconography in the context of Twisted Gourd symbolism and achieved using Andean visual conventions, which were based on a material (temporal) : liminal (timeless) dualism and horizontally quartered (temporal) : vertically triadic (timeless) cosmic construct leave no doubt that the social elites among the early Chaco and Mogollon ancestral Puebloans were related through kinship and ceremonial ties.\n\nWhile this monograph represents a start and much remains to be learned about the cosmovision and political organization of the ancestral Puebloans (Anasazi) who occupied the Four Corners region of the American Southwest, there are three things that we know with certainty:\n\nTheir cosmovision and ideology of rulership was based on Twisted Gourd symbolism that had its roots in Formative period Andean culture c. 2250-800 BCE and direct antecedents in the Pueblo-Mogollon culture of southern Arizona and New Mexico;\n\nPueblo Bonito was the ancestral centerplace of the “corn people” (materialization of sun + water + skin scraping/fat of a god) in the Chaco sphere of influence where patron deities– the Plumed Serpent (amaru) ‘and the Corn mother as the supernatural kinfolk of the Bonitian dynasty– were venerated with feasting and libation rituals; and\n\nThe two nearly identical phallic effigies that were decorated with interconnected Twisted Gourds, a pan-Amerindian symbol of ancestral kinship among divinely empowered social elites and found at two geographically separated Great Houses, have pan-Amerindian parallels that indicate the Bonitians spread their authority through a Great House system of kinship ties that inferred their supernatural descent from creator deities, which was the ideology of rulership that was associated with Twisted Gourd symbolism. Clearly, as one moves to higher levels of integration and organization of archetypal concepts derived from the same symbolic narratives that were preserved as a symbol set over a period of 5,000 years and a distance of 4,000 miles, what until now has been referred to as an indigenous Mesoamerican worldview becomes a pan-Amerindian worldview. The bare bones of a pan-Amerindian religious-political science with astronomical and ecological implications come into focus that comprised a quincunx of four sacred mountains with a fifth at the centerpoint, wherein the cosmic Serpent was materialized in the heart of the chakana; the work of patron deities, especially the Plumed Serpent as patron to elite dynastic bloodlines, and divinized and revered ancestors, was integrated with the work of a dynastic leader, who was associated with the Twisted Gourd symbol; and the overarching integrative concept was “place of mist” that connoted the connection between the Above, Middle, and Below, the nexus of the encounter in the shared liminal state between patron deities, rulership, and revered ancestors, respectively. Collectively, there is now a great deal of contextualized visual evidence from the Moche, Maya, and Anasazi Puebloans, including epigraphic evidence from the Maya (Prager, 2015), that the checkerboard symbol, which along with the quadripartite symbol and the Twisted Gourd “water connectors,” the earliest evidence of Twisted Gourd symbolism and a pan-Amerindian worldview at the Basketmaker-to-Pueblo I transition, did in fact mean “place of mist.” In other words, the checkerboard was objectively the Milky Way-sky and river of life as described in pan-Amerindian indigenous narratives, but subjectively its esoteric, liminal meaning was “place of mist,” the T594 checkerboard glyph which Prager (2015) documented epigraphically and interpreted as “cloth, cover, textile.” This was the constant association of the Twisted Gourd symbol with the checkerboard pattern rendered as a royal mat in Peruvian textiles. It meant the cosmic heart-soul of the Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud ideogram–the Twisted Gourd symbol– as the centerpoint of the “place of mist,” which in fact comprised the triadic realm of the spirit of the cosmic water Serpent, the misty space out of which the entire creation materialized. That is the “in the beginning” foundational statement upon which Twisted Gourd symbolism and the pan-Amerindian worldview as an ideology of rulership evolved. It evolved out of a worldview that saw the creation as a woven tapestry in which was seen in the warp what was hidden in the weave. The pan-Amerindian worldview equated the nature of the cosmic Serpent and its materialization as the Milky Way-sky with the place of mist, light-irradiated water, visionary states, knowledge, and wisdom. The place of mist was the centerpoint where the illusion of time was transcended by priestly warrior-kings who were kinfolk in the lineage of the cosmic Serpent.\n\nAs proof of principle, the interpretation of the checkerboard pattern as the overarching context for the concept of “place of mist” as a liminal cloud-state not only is supported by the Snake-Mountain/cave-cloud narrative for the Twisted gourd symbol as an ideology of rulership but it also explains all the clouds, lightning, thunder, mountains, serpents, and Twisted Gourd water connectors that dominate the visual program of the Bonitian dynasty.\n\nA bullet-style and briefest overview on the meaning of Twisted Gourd symbolism includes the following findings:\n\nI. Twisted Gourd symbolism represented a pan-Amerindian cosmovision among early agriculturalists who formed themselves into complex, theocratic societies based on an ideology of legitimate leadership. The cosmovision answered key questions related to the origin of life, the purpose of human life, the roles played by different sectors of society, and the regeneration of new life from the dead. The terrestrial plane was a self-contained, self-sustained bubble in space with known seasonally defined checkpoints that were authored by the gods and a routine system of maintenance — sometimes through crisis management– in the hands of high-status priests whom, with the assistance of their “pets” (the liminal animal lords), and knowledge (skilled wizardry, possession of proper wi-mi given to them by the gods to conduct effective ritual), could communicate with the creator gods in order to sustain the world and design interventions if necessary.\n\nII. The structure of the cosmos and the identity of those who served at the peak of social organization were integrally connected through the metaphor of an axis mundi, the World Tree, that extended from the celestial northern polar region as the apex of the trunk of the World Tree to its nadir– its roots in the underworld. The mechanics of that structural necessity that linked the vertically triadic cosmos–the Above, Center terrestrial plane, Below– and created the “dew, nectar” that would sustain the materialized cosmos in a circulatory movement of “dew” involved a trinity of archetypal (liminal cosmogonic category) predatory animal lords– Principal Snake, Feline, and Bird. The soul/spirit of those animal lords from a past material age that had been destroyed and recreated on three previous occasions were the anthropomorphic ancestors of hereditary lineages that had established a basis for legitimate rulership of the Sun of the Fourth World (Aztecs established the Fifth Sun mythology). By definition the herediatry ruler embodied the axis mundi and the god agency (Maker and Finisher of the Roads of life) that had authored it as radiant living water–a conduit of spirit– by materializing as personified zoomorphic forms that in fact had all extended from the Maker, the cosmic water Serpent that had first taken form as the Sun to establish the time-bound material world.\n\nIII The indexical metaphor was that of “centerplace” as the place of mist in the center of a three-dimensional, color-coded system of six celestial and terrestrial coordinates that each related to the centerplace. The fourth dimension of that triadic cosmos was the liminal space of “mist” as a metaphor for the dual nature of the cosmic radiant Serpent (the source of dew), which embodied all forms of visible water and gave rise to the other elements– fire, wind, and stone. The liminal place of mist where gods, living-dead ancestors who were revered because they were god-like through supernatural ancestry, and the officiants of terrestrial rulership came together (a “tinkuy”) to be heard linked the cosmic navel and hearth of the terrestrial plane with the Above and Below to sustain the flow of dew along the zenith-nadir axis and thereby sustain the materialization of the gods and their surrogates. Dew extended from the centerplace to all color-coded sacred directions based on proper ritual, gratitude, and chromatic prayer. The metric of the flow of dew between gods and nature was the ritual balance between predator and prey (predator : prey dyad) that was mirrored between the liminal realm of agency and the material world of visible and auditory acts (Maker : Doer paradigm). The wealth of the dew of the centerplace that was sustained by proper ritual and reciprocity–the basis of libation and feasting rituals and chromatic prayer– was extended out to the terrestrial cardinal and intercardinal directional through the correlates of dew– sunlight/fire and rain, the Igneous : Aquatic paradigm)– the metric of which was the balance between fertility and sacrifice (fertility : sacrifice dyad).\n\nIV. The indexical symbol for the misty centerplace (cosmic navel) and its visible terrestrial mirrors was the Twisted Gourd symbol, an idea symbolized by nested light and dark stepped triangles (staircase between realms, a bridge). That design reflected the mythical misty ancestral Mountain/cave in the context of a visible sacred mountain where ancestor veneration was practiced. The link between the triadic realms and the liminal and visible aspects of that design was the cosmic radiant water Serpent, shown as a stepped fret. Twisted Gourd symbolism was a Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud/lightning narrative of the primordial misty state– the time of the new that was symbolized by the catalytic quality of lightning–that was extended by a celestial narrative symbolized by an integrated system of quadripartite, quincunx, kan-kin, chakana, and checkerboard patterns that all pointed to stepped triangular forms that inferred movement between liminal and material states.\n\nThis symbolic language of an indigenous pan-Amerindian cosmovision and ideology of rulership revealed an interconnected cosmos that linked the Big Boss of a centerplace with the creator god(s), wherein the roles of the “god” agency (Maker and shaper of the Roads), Big Boss (Keeper and doer of the Roads– the proper traditions and rituals of the corn life-way), and commoner (grist for sustaining the divine Roads of communication based on the position of the Milky Way World Tree and east-to-west path of the ecliptic that took the sun through the underworld) were defined and mandatory. The rest is investigative detail and the archaeological and ethnographic proofs that supported this ancient cosmogonic model.\n\nThe primary goal of this investigation was to establish a foundation of comparative information about pan-Amerindian Twisted Gourd symbolism that expressed the theocratic politics of social elites who shared a worldview that validated their supernatural identity and capacity for leadership. Twisted Gourd symbolism was developed in Peru by social elites who did not possess a written language but rather had strongly narrative visual programs (pictures of snails = onset of rainy season ergo proper ritual response, etc) that relied upon knowledge of naked-eye astronomy and the ecosystem to create visual tropes associated with the vital roles of social elites. These images were displayed on ceramics and as temple art in a manner not unlike a picture book without speech balloons. A hypothetical example would be the integrated display of three images of the patron deity co-identified with the priest-king that showed him as an agricultural product, sitting in a quatrefoil symbol with water signs (Mountain/cave as home of ancestor(s), and sitting inside the ancestral Mountain/cave during the course of a human sacrifice. The message was that social elites mediated the cosmic balance between sacrifice and abundance, the main determinant of social well-being, and the fate of souls in the cycle of life, death and rebirth. More sophisticated visual conventions included contour rivalry to create well known visual kennings and puns that extended meanings and an authoritative narrative that could be understood by different language groups. The intent of social elites was always to show how the powers of the liminal Otherworld determined material reality, and it was those local dynastic elites who, through patronage, served as the intermediaries between the liminal and material realms through kinship with a creator deity that produced abundance for the people.\n\nTwisted Gourd symbolism was further developed among the Maya by the early Snake kings who did develop a hieroglyphic language that validated the authority of divine kings, and it was illuminated among the ancestral Puebloans who did not possess a written language but who were represented by dynastic elites whose visual program developed a symbolic language of lightning, thunder and rain clouds to demonstrate the supernatural ancestral powers possessed by the dynasty that occupied Pueblo Bonito in Chaco canyon.\n\nIt took those three case studies to compare and validate the continuity in meaning of Twisted Gourd symbolism over time and distance as an ideology of dynastic rulership, which was in fact the basis of a pan-Amerindian mytho-cosmology and theocratic worldview that dated to the Formative period of the early agricultural societies. The first finding was that Twisted Gourd symbolism in fact was an international ideology of supernaturally sanctioned rulership over time and distance. The Twisted Gourd symbol itself was an iconic Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud/lightning ancestral narrative–a concept of cosmic Centerplace– co-identified with the birthplace of social elites that was supported by mythic origin stories of supernatural descent from an anthropomorphic agricultural deity who had been created by the cosmic avian-Serpent to embody the agencies of sun and water. As First Father, the personified Sun who was born of (snake) water, gave life to the plant world and human ancestors.\n\nThe second finding was that the Puebloans and Mayans integrated cosmology, mythology, and the ideology of theocratic rulership through the metaphor of the axis mundi, the World Tree, which was embodied by the priest-king by virtue of his supernatural ancestry. The canopy of the World Tree was the Milky Way river of life, e.g., the cosmic Serpent, and it was rooted in the primordial ocean from which life emerged, e.g., the cosmic Serpent. The spirit of the cosmic Serpent could materialize in any form of life.\n\nIn turn, the third finding was that the Puebloans established a detailed axis mundi as a Plumed Serpent with triadic forms, e.g., fit for a triadic Above-Middle-Below cosmos, that as the Milky Way in its stand-up position had its head in the celestial House of the North, the vast area of black space demarcated by the rotation of the Big Dipper and centered on the northern polestar, which currently is Polaris. In other words, the cosmic Plumed Serpent (water), from which the sun and the agricultural deity had materialized, occupied the celestial House of the North, and it was from the celestial House of the North that the “seeds” of deity were planted in the womb of the earth to establish the Heart of Sky-Heart of Earth axis mundi. From that seed, the supernatural descent of earthly priest-kings was established, e.g., the basis of the axis mundi and the ancestry of kings and queens are one and the same thing, which results in the co-identification of royal blood and water (spirit of the cosmic Serpent).\n\nTaken together, the above evidence suggests a pattern of social organization based on two ritual spheres of interaction– an “above” group that represented the center, corn agriculture, and the daytime sun that represented fertility and growth, and a “below” group that represented the feline-snake, the night sun as it journeyed through the underworld after sunset, which elsewhere in Mesoamerica was associated with ritual warfare and sacrifice. The Plumed Serpent in Above-Below forms was the tutelary deity of both groups, and the antecedents were Mesoamerican, probably filtered through the Pueblo-Mogollon culture.\n\nTo summarize up to this point, out of all of the evidence of Chacoan material culture gathered at Pueblo Bonito, the clearest evidence of a regional organization, a shared ritual orthodoxy, and perhaps even something akin to representative governance that included all aspects of the ideology of rulership associated with Twisted Gourd symbolism was the large array of ceremonial bowls shown above from several regions that were found in rm. 326, one of the rooms of the western burial vault (ground plan) that “illustrate almost the entire range of ceramic history at Pueblo Bonito” (Judd, 1954: pl. 54). Note the preponderance of designs– checkerboard, five-mountain quincunx, hourglass, pinwheel/swastika, amaru/cosmic Serpent, and double-headed serpent scroll, the unfolded Chaco signature– that are also seen at the Zuni Village of the Great Kivas, a Chaco outlier built after the proto-Zuni and People of Dew merged, and in the Upper Gila (Roberts, 1932; Hough, 1914).\n\nWho Were the People of Dew? The Acoma Keres were co-identified with the Tsamaiya (“Chama’hia”) by the Hopi, as was the lightning celt/hoe called the tcamahia that was the weapon of the Hero/War Twins which was delivered by the Chiefs of the Directions, Stephen, 1936a: 675, 625, 679, 707); the Tsamaiya were protectors of the Hopi (ibid., 585); the Tsamaiya were co-identified with the Snake-Antelopes (ibid, 679; Stephen, 1929: 45); the Tsamaiya traveled to Zuni, Isleta (intersection with Jornada Mogollon), and Laguna, Stephen, 1936a: 679); the Tsamaiya were co-identified with the People of Dew via the Po “dew” priest (Poshaiyanne, the culture hero) who emerged in the land of the Tsamaiya and was transformed into the stone Puma (a Stone Ancient) at the Village of the Stone Lions (Stevenson, 1904); and the land of the Tsamaiya was co-identified with the land of the Stone Ancients and the Antelope medicine chief called the Tsamaiya (Stephen, 1936a: 707-708), who was the Twin of the Acoma Antelope chief called Tiamunyi (Stirling, 1942: 37-39). “The chama’hia came from the Below, were at Toko’nabi and at A’kokyabi (Acoma)” (Stephen, 1936a: 745), which was confirmed in the Hopi Snake legends (Stephen, 1929).\n\nThe Zuni and Hopi merged with the People of Dew in subordinate roles (Cushing, 1896; Stephen, 1929). The People of Dew were Acoma Keres, who were the Tsamaiya snake masters and Stone Ancients who occupied the land of the Tsamaiya Stone People on the Potrero de Vacas, which was a ceremonial center that is associated with the nearby site of Acoma Pueblo. Given the shared and central importance of the Tsamaiya ritual and ideological complex to the Keres, Zuni, and Hopi, and the correlates of the Tsamaiya complex to the material evidence found in the northern burial crypt at Pueblo Bonito as well as the distribution of the tcamahia in the Chacoan sphere, there is every reason to believe that Twisted Gourd symbolism was owned and introduced by the People of Dew– Acoma Keres who spoke the language of the underworld– who introduced the mythology of the Stone Ancients/Hero-War Twins that reflected the supernatural powers of the twinned Tiamunyi and Tsamaiya, the religious-political leadership in the Chacoan sphere of influence. The Keresan pair, authorized by the Keres Kapina altar, was reflected in the mythological roles of the Hero/War Twins that persisted into modern-era Puebloan culture as a model of dual governance.\n\nIt is all but certain that the Puebloans and Mayans shared this mytho-cosmology of descent of the “corn people” via the Puebloan’s triadic Plumed Serpent and the Maya’s GI-GII-GIII triadic deity as the axis mundi, the mythology of Mesoamerica’s first agricultural society (corn people”) that was preserved in the Maya’s Popol vuh. While it is clear that Andeans did associate Twisted Gourd symbolism with a cosmic Mountain/cave Centerplace, there is little visual and/or ethnographic evidence that proves the Andeans co-identified their cosmic Centerplace with the axis mundi functionally represented as a World Tree and embodied by a priest-king. Instead, the Moche’s deified ancestor was co-identified with an omnipresent, fanged Maker-Doer mountain deity wearing a snake belt (the Milky Way). I found no conclusive visual evidence of a Heart of Sky-Heart of Earth axial construct that extended from the celestial House of the North into the Mountain/cave womb of the earth, e.g., a myth of descent that explained the ritual duties of an agricultural life-way and the supernatural ancestry of social elites. That said, these findings call for a more detailed examination of the Moche’s coca ceremonies with their Presentation/Sacrifice themes to look for celestial symbols that did in fact point to an awareness of a connection between the sky and earth that was conceptualized as a connection between the celestial House of the North and the ancestral Mountain/cave womb on earth. Andeans could see a partial rotation of the Big Dipper during their December solstice that they associated with the onset of the rainy season and abundance (Sparavigna, 2012). The survival into the modern era of that one significant piece of information suggests that it had been an important detail associated with their ancestral cosmogonic theories. And yet, the earliest known interconnected Twisted Gourd symbols in the context of a symbolic visual narrative from a well described culture came from the Cupisnique/Chavin horizon 500-300 BCE (ML040330; see circulatory cosmos), the antecedent of the Moche culture, and it shows a direct connection between the terrestrial plane and the underworld. This direct parallel to the Below aspect of the Puebloan’s axis mundi in the context of Twisted Gourd symbolism suggests a couple of things. First, the Above axial construct of Heart of Sky-Heart of Earth that was well documented among the ancestral Puebloans and the Maya formed a believable narrative concerning the supernatural ancestry of rulers, while the Below aspect narrated the fate of the souls of the living-dead and their participation in the fertility (abundance) : sacrifice dyad as part of the regeneration of life. Functionally the axis mundi had to extend from the Above to the Below by passing through the Centerplace of the triadic cosmos to account for the origin of seeds, the ancestry and power of priest-kings, the cycle of life-death-regeneration of both plants and humans, and the necessity of reciprocity that flowed between the liminal and visible realms in order to sustain life.\n\nWhat Puebloans and Andeans shared without doubt was the mythology and visual concept of the rainbow amaru (“big snake” as the Milky Way), which functionally, as an overarching concept, related to the stand-up position of the Milky Way (flow of abundance into terrestrial life) and to the circulatory nature of the cosmos (water cycle of life, death, rebirth of ancestors). Whereas the Andeans may not have required so visual a rendering as a cosmic Tree that represented the sun-water cycle that sustained and regenerated life through the roles of social elites, clearly there was an internationally shared sense of a source of living, sentient water that sustained the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. It was kinship with that living (snake spirit) water, which was integral to the role of the ancestral Mountain/cave Centerplace, that created a class of social elites in the earliest agricultural civilizations. Andeans, Mayans, and Puebloans shared in common a triadic cosmos, the Mountain/cave Centerplace, and the idea that the Milky Way was a cosmic Serpent and river of life. Many other animating concepts, such as prophetic speech, breath of life, sacred dew, and sacred directions, extended from that central archetype. This mytho-cosmology as an ideology of rulership, which was co-identified with an ancestral Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud/lightning narrative of supernatural descent and the terrestrial Centerplace (navel of the cosmos), was materialized by elites through visual programs of Twisted Gourd symbolism.\n\nIn other words, the Puebloans preserved into the modern era both cosmogonic “strands”– the Mesoamerican axis mundi and the Andean amaru— which suggests that both strands shared the same cosmological underpinnings. Ethnological evidence from the Keres, Zuni, and Hopi provided proof of how the ancestral Puebloans conceived of the axis mundi as a triadic cosmic Serpent extending from the celestial House of the North through the Centerplace and into the underworld (Ancient of the Six Directions); archaeological evidence provided proof for how the first Chacoan’s visual program extended from Twisted Gourd symbolism, first seen in Peru c. 2250 BCE, and how the “Chaco signature” was derived from a Peruvian antecedent for the amaru c. 800-200 BCE (ML015591), which established the cosmological and mythological basis for the supernatural double-headed serpent bar that was carried by Maya rulers as their emblem of power and display of kinship with the Milky Way’s cosmic Serpent. The many parallels in how social authority was defined and exerted among the Andeans, Mayans, and Puebloans in places where Twisted Gourd symbolism took root can be detected in close readings of ethnographic and archaeological evidence. The evidence points to what became a shared international cosmovision that could be documented in the Maya’s Formative period (Rice, 2007). Each leg of the evolution of this 4,000-year-old pan-Amerindian cosmovision that structured the religious beliefs and social organization of ancient agricultural communities contributes to our understanding of the earliest known theocratic movement in the Americas, which was constructed around the Milky Way as the road of life of the cosmic Serpent. Fundamentally, we can see from the ethnographic and archaeological evidence that this was an ecocosmovision of “living water” (spirit of the big Snake) as the source of abundance, sacred breath, the “blessed substance” dew, and empowered leadership, the loci of which was the ancestral Mountain/cave on earth in the cosmic navel where ancestral gods and priest-kings could become one.\n\nTo summarize the meaning of Twisted Gourd symbolism, the overarching constructs of its meaning were Ancestors, Mountain/cave, and Place of Mist. All of its references– the patron deities associated with royal blood, the regional centerplaces where they ruled, the privileges, duties and authority of ruling lineages at the top of the social pyramid, visual programs of Twisted Gourd symbolism that represented the ruling class– can be subsumed under the overarching indexical concept of “Ancestors” that were integral to the Tree of Life. The Twisted Gourd symbol referred to a cosmic (“misty,” liminal space) Snake House (see chakana), and Twisted Gourd symbolism signified the ancestry, both divine and human, of a ruling lineage and the sacred precinct where living-dead Ancestors could be accessed and propitiated. Moche art demonstrated the clear connection between Twisted Gourd symbolism and Ancestors in the representations of the Priests of the Bicephalic Arch (cosmic Serpent as the Milky Way), where three living-dead ancestors sitting on clouds, materialized ritually under the Milky Way arch by the chthonic feline fetish of the ruling lineage, and covered with Twisted Gourd symbolism participate in a priestly rite (section 3). The centrality of Ancestors–veneration of those immortal ancestral gods, including the beast gods, and deified, living-dead clan ancients– and their archetypal Snake-Mountain/cave abode (Twisted Gourd) as the reference point of Twisted Gourd symbolism was carried north to the Maya (Dominguez, 2009; Part III-Maya), to the Zapotecs in Oaxaca (see Mitla), and to the ancestral Puebloans (Part VI-Puebloan Cosmology). In each of those cultures the primary Ancestor as the grandfather of ruling dynasties and author of the sacred Roads (time-space) was the cosmic Plumed Serpent, the Milky Way river of life. Among the ancestral Puebloans of the northern American Southwest (Anasazi) the Ancestors were called the Stone Ancients, a direct reference to a passage in the foundational Mesoamerican corn myth preserved as the Popol vuh (Tedlock, 1996:161).\n\nCollectively, there is now a great deal of contextualized visual evidence from the Moche, Maya, and Anasazi Puebloans, including epigraphic evidence from the Maya (Prager, 2015), that the checkerboard symbol, which along with the quadripartite symbol and the Twisted Gourd “water connectors,” the earliest evidence of Twisted Gourd symbolism and a pan-Amerindian worldview at the Basketmaker-to-Pueblo I transition, did in fact mean “place of mist.” In other words, the checkerboard was objectively the Milky Way-sky and river of life as described in pan-Amerindian indigenous narratives, but subjectively its esoteric, liminal meaning was “place of mist,” the T594 checkerboard glyph which Prager (2015) documented epigraphically and interpreted as “cloth, cover, textile.” This was the constant association of the Twisted Gourd symbol with the checkerboard pattern rendered as a royal mat in Peruvian textiles. It meant the cosmic heart-soul of the Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud ideogram–the Twisted Gourd symbol– as the centerpoint of the “place of mist,” which in fact comprised the triadic realm of the spirit of the cosmic water Serpent, the misty space out of which the entire creation materialized. That is the “in the beginning” foundational statement upon which Twisted Gourd symbolism and the pan-Amerindian worldview as an ideology of rulership evolved. It evolved out of a worldview that saw the creation as a woven tapestry in which was seen in the warp what was hidden in the weave. The pan-Amerindian worldview equated the nature of the cosmic Serpent and its materialization as the Milky Way-sky with the place of mist, light-irradiated water, visionary states, knowledge, and wisdom. The place of mist was the centerpoint where the illusion of time was transcended by priestly warrior-kings who were kinfolk in the lineage of the cosmic Serpent. In terms of a modern universal vernacular we would call the place of mist or having a “sky” mind and seeing the light (things as they truly are) a fully aware human consciousness.\n\nAn association with the checkerboard symbol marks an object found at Pueblo Bonito as being part of the concept of “place of mist,” a liminal cloud-state suffused by the spirit of the cosmic Serpent and the focal point of Twisted Gourd symbolism’s ideology of rulership. In the examples above, the checkered puma (Judd, 1954:fig 50e) is identified as a mythical underworld actor with an obvious parallel to the Maya’s Jaguar lord of fire. Other vessels found at Pueblo Bonito show the checkerboard pattern as the Milky Way-sky dome (above, left: rm. 326, Judd, 1954: pl. 54) and in the “misty” state of a ceremonial water pitcher (A336405, Smithsonian digital collection from Pueblo Bonito).\n\nNote that the slanted checkered pattern on the Puma has been associated specifically with the cosmic Plumed Serpent in the American Southwest. This is interesting because it suggests that the ancestral Puebloan case further informs the meaning of the Maya’s GIII checkerboard glyph and hence the kan-k’in symbol. The Maya Jaguar lord of the underworld was an aspect of the sun god (Tuszyńska, 2011). We know from Zuni mythology (Cushing, 1896) in an origin myth of the corn life-way that was transmitted to them by the Keres People of Dew that the sun god was born of water from the Plumed Serpent called Awonawilona, a reference to the Maker of sacred directions and the Doer, lightning. Although the Popol vuh provides much less cosmogonic detail (Tedlock, 1996), a close reading suggests that the Maya’s origin story of the corn life-way that begins with the sovereign Plumed Serpent also has the cosmic Serpent as the progenitor of the sun god. The Puma of the Bonitian dynasty and the Jaguar of the Palenque dynasty in the context of Twisted Gourd symbolism and the trinity of animal lords are both associated with the “place of mist” by both the Twisted Gourd symbol and the checkerboard symbol. When the trinity of animal lords appears together in a visual program in that context, it says “cosmos” (Above, Middleplace, Below) and infers the axis mundi (a liminal concept) as the seamless unity of life, death, and regeneration.\n\nTaken together, it is apparent that GIII is a radiant snake-jaguar by ancestry, which is the crux of the king’s name as well– K’inich (sun-faced) Chan (sky, serpent, number four) Balam (Jaguar) II. He was named after a revered ancestor in Palenque’s line of kings, K’inich Kan Bahlam, who had been directly linked with Palenque’s Triad God (GI-GII-GIII) with a mother-child relationship glyph (Tuszynska, 2011). Two things in that example run parallel with the ancestral Keres Puebloan’s supreme ruler, the Tiamunyi: 1) the naming of the ruler after a supernatural parent as the sign of a claimed royal kinship, and 2) the fact that Chan Balam had a supreme warrior title, kaloom-te,’ which undoubtedly was “supreme” because it likely approached the supernatural endowments of the Tiamunyi’s male aspect, the Tsamaiya (Tcamahia) warrior/hunter.\n\nThis evidence indicates that there is history and ethnographic evidence to be found by understanding the dynastic ancestry of gods relative to the trinity of animal lords and their naming conventions, which run parallel to the dynastic ancestry of kings, their naming conventions, and the iconography that related them to the animal lords. Among the Moche, Maya, and ancestral Puebloans the function and claim to authority of the centerplace ruler of a triadic cosmos was a claim to the assistance of the triadic animal lords by way of a revered deified ancestor who had been born of the animal gods. Te’ in the kaloom-te’ title was a reference to tree, which suggests that a name like K’inick Kan Bahlam, kaloom-te ‘ (sun-snake-jaguar, tree) was tantamount to saying “born of the tree,” the world tree, the axis mundi of the cosmos. That was how rulers could make a convincing claim in their visual programs that their family lineage in fact embodied the supernatural ancestry that constituted the axis mundi, which was a Bird-Feline-Snake construct. The bottom line is, the triadic cosmos, the triadic gods, the triadic axis mundi, and triadic naming conventions as corollaries to the triadic cosmos all pointed to the centrality of this ideological complex in the pan-Amerindian ideology of rulership associated with Twisted Gourd symbolism. It appears that the overarching metaphor of the foregoing foundational principle was “place of mist” as a metaphor for the powerful nature of the everywhere-present spirit of the cosmic Serpent, which was represented by the Twisted Gourd symbol in the context of the checkerboard symbol and the trinity of animal lords. By every measure of evidence and by the fact that it is the cosmic Serpent that is attached to the stepped triangle in the Twisted Gourd symbol, the supreme animal lord and author of the misty state was the cosmic Plumed Serpent, the medium of sun-water as a connector that could achieve catalytic unitive states between sky, terrestrial, and underworld realms. Hereditary rulers, e.g., “misty” and therefore immortal by supernatural ancestry but mortal in flesh, were like-in-kind with the “misty” state of the cosmic Serpent (Milky Way-sky), and their Bird and Feline ancestry provided agencies that made it possible to equate the cosmic axis mundi with human rulership. Hereditary rulers, e.g., “misty” and therefore immortal by supernatural ancestry but mortal in flesh, were like-in-kind with the “misty” state of the cosmic Serpent (Milky Way-sky), and their Bird and Feline ancestry provided agencies that made it possible to equate the cosmic axis mundi with hereditary human rule.\n\nThere are multiple examples in ancestral Puebloan archaeological art (left) of a design similar to the (right) Maya’s GIII’s name phrase containing the T594 checkerboard glyph, where GIII represented the underworld in their dynastic Triad God GI-GII-GIII. The Puebloan example shows an embellished variant of the “Chaco signature” which was derived from the Twisted Gourd symbol crossing the unfolded version of the Chaco signature, e.g., the S form of the cosmic bicephalic serpent.\n\nThe GIII checkerboard glyph has never been deciphered, but this evidence suggests that the Palenque royals viewed the light-dark checkerboard pattern as a reference to the cosmic Serpent in the context of the underworld night sun (GIII), which in effect is a fire : water unity due to the sun god’s ancestry that reflects the pan-Amerindian igneous : aquatic creation paradigm and the concept of time itself. That is the cosmogonic principle boiled down to a nutshell that is associated with “the place of mist” as an ideology of rulership associated with Twisted Gourd symbolism, and it is a paradigm that both the Maya at Palenque and the Bonitians in Chaco canyon shared. Since the Moche’s Aia Paec tutelary deity and ancestor was also a radiant snake-jaguar Mountain/cave construct (ML001557; note the checkerboard/Milky Way-sky symbol of the cosmic Serpent around his waist in lieu of his customary bicephalic serpent belt), we perhaps can assume that the origin of this newly recognized aspect of the pan-Amerindian igneous : aquatic paradigm associated with the ancestry of rulers was also in Peru, and the antecedent was very likely the anthropomorphic snake-jaguar shaman that posed next to the original Twisted Gourd symbol c. 2250 BCE (Haas, et al., 2003).\n\nIn light of this evidence, the kan-k’in symbol as a single unit of the checkerboard pattern, wherein the solstitial paths of the sun are superimposed on the Serpent’s quad cross (the Serpent’s Venus avatar –the Eye of the Sun– is also represented by the quad cross), can also without error be read as a radiant cosmic Serpent that defines the “misty” context of the centerpoint of the Mountain/cave, the home of the Jaguar lord at the cosmic hearth. Since the symbol refers explicitly to the name of GIII, the underworld Jaguar lord of fire and the night sun, we can take the cross-hatched black k’in portion of the symbol as a reference to the night sun and the cross-hatched black (liminal, “misty”) centerpoint as the heart of the archetypal Mountain/cave. It is another integrative fire : water construct that relates to the pan-Amerindian igneous : aquatic paradigm of creation as a quality of the supernatural ancestry of rulership and a functional quality of the cosmos.\n\nWith deeper research dives into the symbolic visual narratives of Andean, Mayan, and Puebloan elites we should expect to find the same pan-Amerindian axial cosmogony in the context of Twisted Gourd symbolism, especially in reference to objects marked with a checkerboard pattern (Milky Way-sky, place of mist, dark-light cycle, e.g., time), regardless of what the cosmic center pole is called or how the avian-Serpent (cosmic Serpent) might be decked out with local symbolic references. The Puebloans called that construct Heshanavaiya, the Plumed Serpent as the Ancient of the Directions, which is the only name we may ever securely know; Heshanavaiya was Pueblo Bonito’s amaru and the ancestral Puebloan’s axis mundi. Both the South American and ancestral Puebloan amaru was decorated with feathers–a clear reference to a cosmic avian-Serpent as the Above-Below flow of the Milky Way and the “living spirit of water”– and that construct will be key to establishing the ancient basis of a pan-Amerindian cosmovision that became a world religion persisting to this day among indigenous traditionalists. The important pieces have been assembled in this monograph, but missing details remain to be discovered to establish beyond any reasonable doubt its spread (probably through royal marriages), the roles and agency of social elites, and the growth of their civilizing dynastic centers–each a royal Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud topocosm– that regionally served ceremonial, judicial, and economic functions.\n\nThe starting point for a deep dive would begin with the remarkable parallels between the Hopi, Keres, and Zuni cosmogonies and the Maya’s cosmogony preserved in the Popol vuh as established in this monograph. “The primary purpose of world view is to give a sense of order and control to life. At its most basic level, world view explains the creation of life and provides a means for maintaining and renewing it. The Maya were corn farmers living in a tropical environment with a distinct wet and dry season that dictated the timing of the corn cycle. This shaped their world view. The stories concerning the creation of the earth and the first human beings focus on the establishment of the rain and corn cycle and on the creator deities who brought about these cycles” (Bassie, 2002: 1).\n\nAt a foundational level, then, the Maya and the ancestral Pueblos shared a belief that the origin of the triadic cosmos began with a primordial mist, e.g., the liminal nature of the cosmic Serpent, that gave rise to the sun god, meaning the origin of time and a material world that had a mirrored liminal twin, which was the fire : water paradigm of the life, death, and regeneration cycle. The social context for that cosmogonic construct was pan-Amerindian Twisted Gourd symbolism, which represented the cosmogony of the “place of mist,” the cosmology of ancestors of those who would be born to rule the earth under the authority of the Hero/War Twins, and the source of sustenance of both humans and creator gods.\n\nSignificant Findings\n\nCorn had been domesticated in the Rio Balsas region of Guerrero, Mexico, by 6,660 BCE (Hastorf, 2009) and had diffused into the Four Corners region of the American Southwest by 2100 BCE (Merrill., et al., 2009). In solving for pattern the early corn agriculturalists called the ancestral Puebloans who became known as the Keres, Zuni, Hopi, and Tanoan speakers of the historical period shared a common cultural pattern that ethnographically and archaeologically was identifiable at the Basket-maker to Pueblo transition (BM III-PI) and defined by Pueblo I, 750-900 CE, as a distinctive “Anasazi” cultural pattern. Evidence suggests that in the beginning, rather than being an important part of the food economy, maize was primarily a ritual plant used to prepare beverages for ritual feasting and for gift exchanges (Staller, et al., 2016). Atole, a ceremonial beverage made of corn and cacao by elites, was one of those beverages. Evidence early in Puebloan development tends to support those findings with the discovery that early decorated pottery at the 8th-century Site 13 in the Alkali Ridge community at the border of southeastern Utah and southwestern Colorado during the BMIII-PI transition may have had cacao residues (Washburn, et al., 2013; map; Washburn’s findings are disputed). Undisputed is the fact that special ceremonial cylinder vessels with cacao residues were found in the ancestral northern burial crypt at Pueblo Bonito (Washburn, et al., 2011; Crown, Hurst, 2009). The ceremonial cylinder vases were dated to 900-1000 to 1130 CE and in form and function correlated to Maya cylinder vases with hieroglyphic text that stated the vases were used for cacao consumption by elites. “[D]rinking rituals in Chaco intensified in the AD 1000s, followed by upheaval with the termination and rejection of their most iconic vessel form around AD 1100” (Crown, 2018: 387).\n\nThe narrative for the Alkali Ridge-to-Tokonabi (Navajo mountain) region has been developed in this report as Chi-pia #4, the northwest corner (winter solstice sunset) of the Chacoan sphere of influence that was a known “misty” location where Snake initiations occurred that would have been associated with the “living water” of a Shipap, a place of emergence where gods and ancestors could move between the terrestrial and liminal realms. The difference between a regional Shipap and the sipapu of a clan’s private kiva was multi-ethnic function: pilgrimages of groups that spoke different languages, namely Hopi speakers from the northwest quadrant and Zuni speakers from the southwest quadrant, traveled to a Keres’ Shipap in the southeast quadrant of the Chacoan sphere to receive a god, initiation into his cult, emblems of authority, and secret songs in the Keresan language of ritual, and hence these functions identified a regional Shipap as a “place of mist” (sacred precinct) and regenerative water.\n\nThere is every reason to believe that ritual imported from Mesoamerica and related to the growth cycle of corn shaped ancestral Pueblo culture. “Like the natives in isolated pockets of Mexico and Guatemala, our living Pueblo people still are perpetuating on this northern periphery their derivative form of basic concepts once common to all Mesoamerica” (Ellis, Hammack, 1968:42). As Krober observed (1917:140), “…a single, precise scheme pervades the clan organization of all the Pueblos. It is almost as if one complete pattern had been stamped upon the social life of every community in the area.” As indigenous sources attest, “The Moquis and Zunis have an identical religion, and depend upon each other for help in their sacred ceremonies”(Bourke, 1884:193). They had a secret ritual language (ibid., 191) that has been identified in this report as Keresan. Frank Cushing identified an early merging of nomadic seed gatherers with an “elder nation” that introduced maize ritual to them, and it was the latter culture called the People of Dew with whom the Zuni became “one people” that defined what is known as Zuni cu;ture today. Cushing identified the People of Dew as “comparatively unchanged descendants of the famous cliff- dwellers of the Mancos, San Juan, and other canyons of Utah, Colorado, and northern New Mexico” (Cushing, 1896:343). A consensus of opinion developed around the idea that the seat of ancestral Puebloan culture had developed in southwestern Colorado (Roberts, 1930; Morris, 1919, 1927; Potter, 2010), a view that this research report came to strongly support, but I amend the conclusion with the fact that what developed in southwestern Colorado was maize ritual authorized by Keresan priests located at Chi-pia #1, the only ancestral Puebloans to claim supernatural blood ancestry with the Sky or First Father, e.g., a metaphysical basis for rulership wherein royal blood was equivalent to the spiritual power of water as embodied by the cosmic Plumed Serpent. The Acoma Keres emerged from a Shipap in southwestern Colorado (Chi-pia #1) and based their legitimate claim to authority on their direct celestial descent from the author of life and sustainer of corn agriculture, the Plumed Serpent. The great cosmic serpent was the snake fret of the Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud ideogram that narrated the meaning of the Twisted Gourd symbol and generated the personified Sun as Sky/First Father. This sun-water metaphysical construct materialized as the Sky father of the Corn mother who resided in the celestial House of the North, where Heart of Sky as Four Winds (Plumed Serpent) authored the six sacred directions that were collectively represented by the checkerboard and kan-k’in symbols. I further argue that the antecedent to the Snake-Antelope and Horn-Flute ritual complex that was identified as Keres in origin (Ellis, 1967, 1969, 1988; Ellis, Hammack, 1968) came from the upper Gila River in the Pueblo-Mogollon Blue Mountain archaeological zone (map). This was a location where macaw feathers, crook canes, flutes, tcamahias and Twisted Gourd symbolism were associated with cave ritualism by 650-850 CE, e.g., precisely the Pueblo I time period during which Chacoan culture centered around Pueblo Bonito first developed as a transition from the Basketmaker period. Based on pottery sherds and an intact vessel found in the burial crypt, Puebloan Bonito apparently maintained a cultural tie with the Blue Mountain region through the exchange of Tularosa pottery. Those findings are supported by the crook canes and flutes that were found in the dynastic burial vault (room 33), which were all but identical to the ritual paraphernalia found in Tularosa cave and used in the historical period by the Snake-Antelope and Horn-Flute societies (Hough, 1914; Martin, et al., 1952; Pepper, 1920).\n\n1. The supernatural basis of corn ritual among the ancestral Puebloans of the American Southwest (Anasazi) originated in the House of the Seven Stars, the Big Dipper, whose rotation around the polestar created a celestial zone called Heart of Sky. Each star of the Big Dipper represented one the seven color-coded Corn maidens that on the terrestrial plane materialized the six sacred directions (north, west, south, east, Above, Below) and the seventh direction as the rainbow center of them all. The Corn maidens as daughters of the Corn mother were the mythological bridge between the supernaturals that established corn agriculture and the heads of corn clans (chiefs of the colored roads) that were founded by women that equated divinized human flesh (the “corn people,” because they ate sacred maize as descendants of the ancestors who were made from maize by a deity, Tedlock, 1996:145-146) with an ear of corn that symbolized the Corn mother (Stirling, 1942:31-32). Both Puebloans and Mayans still self-identify as “corn people,” hence civilized and following the correct path of life.\n\nThe Corn maidens had seven sisters that were their reflections on pools of water on the terrestrial surface, and these were the Flute (water, dew) maidens that created living water (note the light-struck water construct as a materialization of the pan-Amerindian igneous : aquatic paradigm). Their grandfather, the Sky father of their Corn mother, was the polestar around which the Big Dipper circulated to materialize the god called Four Winds, which was the Plumed Serpent as the wind god Queztalcoatl-Ehecatl who, when he died, changed himself into the Morning star (Venus) and as such became the God of Dawn (“The cross,” says Brinton, ” is the symbol of the four winds; the bird and serpent, the rebus of the air god, their ruler” (Bancroft, 1875:135). This is one of three major contact points between the corn myths of Mesoamerica and the American Southwest. Paiyatamu, the ancestral Puebloan god of dawn and dew, was the god at the center of corn ritual who appeared with the Morning star at dawn on the day that they first received the Seed of seeds (color-coded corn) from the priests of their elder brothers, the People of Dew, and became one people. Their tutelary deity was Paiyatamu, whose Flute maidens (starlight of the Big Dipper) fertilized the water of life (Milky Way). It is highly significant that their songs were sung in the Keres language that clearly co-identified the People of Dew with elite Keresan priests and the corn life-way, which points directly to the Acoma Keres origin story that established the corn life-way as the foundational documentary source for the religious-political beliefs of ancestral Puebloans. This is the contact point between the corn life-way, system of sacred directions, Keresan as an authoritative pan-Puebloan ritual language, and Chaco culture centered at Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon.\n\nThe overarching creator deity was the self-existent Thinker that materialized itself as the sovereign Plumed Serpent, the god of the Four Winds (celestial House of the North, maker of the Roads) and the avatar–god of dew and dawn (Morning star). These ground-breaking findings not only in terms of ancestral Puebloan cosmology but also in terms of the celestial associations, nature of the axis mundi and sacred “roads,” and ritual of Quetzalcoatl cults in Mesoamerica among Mayan and Mexican priestly elites who were associated with rulership and the corn life-way directly link elite Anasazi Pueblo warrior-priests with Mesoamerican counterparts.\n\n2. The evidence pointed to a startling conclusion and second major point of contact that what linked a pan-Amerindian ideology of rulership through Twisted Gourd symbolism was the axis mundi that extended from the celestial House of the North at the polestar to its nadir in a mythologized House of the South, perhaps even the Southern Cross given the origin of Twisted Gourd symbolism in the region where that asterism is revered. The axis mundi that extended from the celestial House of the North to the House of the South comprised three aspects of a bicephalic Plumed Serpent. Those lineages that would lead the corn life-way embodied the axis mundi because their supernatural ancestry extended from the Plumed Serpent. The fact that both the Maya’s GI and the ancestral Puebloan’s Four Winds placed Four Winds (polestar + rotational sphere of the Big Dipper = Heart of Sky) in the celestial House of the North and then extended that deity through a tri-partite axis mundi (GI-GII-GIII for the Maya; Plumed Serpent as Four Winds, Katoya, and Heshanavaiya for the ancestral Puebloans) supports that conclusion.\n\n3. It took a large corpus of Moche and Maya art to begin to see patterns and relationships and ultimately to see the Twisted Gourd for what it was and always had been– it was a Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud ideogram of the cosmic navel whose structure and function mirrored the form of the Big Dipper as a royal celestial House of the North wherein the authors of life and the supernatural parents of kings lived. Among ancestral Puebloans this authoritarian figure that embodied the corn life-way was Keres and called the Tiamunyi. His was a dual supernatural authority in that the two daughters of the First (Sky) Father became his wife (Corn mother, his aunt the mother of corn people) and mother (mother of everyone except the corn people; sired by the rainbow Serpent). In effect, through his supernatural ancestry the supremacy of the corn life-way was established on the one hand and his lordship over all people was legitimated on the other.\n\nThe Twisted Gourd symbol that defined the cosmogonic and ontological purpose of the archetypal Mountain/cave at the cosmic navel was a light-water tinkuy (meeting, encounter, in both metaphysical and physical senses) that generated observational sciences hand-in-hand with a richly embellished metaphysical theory of the ancestral divine authority of elite priests whose ancestry began at Heart of Sky, who ruled as the embodied axis mundi from the terrestrial Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud/lightning Centerplace. His was the water into which elites entered the water” at death, only to be resurrected to new life in the river of life called the Milky Way, where they served their communities thereafter as the rain- and lightning-makers collectively called the kopishtaiya. The directional aspects of both Maya and Puebloan cosmology began with the raising of the sky of the fourth world and the establishment of the celestial House of the North wherein the sacred directions organized around an axis mundi authored by the Sky father, e.g., the celestial Plumed Serpent as Four Winds, the polestar god of the axis mundi that moved the sky dome by the rotation of the Big Dipper.\n\n4. The Twisted Gourd symbol was confirmed in these studies to represent a Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud/lightning ideogram that was shared internationally by elites who claimed ancestry from the celestial House of the North. Among ancestral Puebloans it represented an ideology of leadership and social organization that was implemented through the Tsamaiya and Awona ideological complexes, which defined a six-point system of sacred directions with all directions represented by the central seventh direction, e.g., the terrestrial Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud/lightning Shipap or primary ancestral cave of emergence that was characterized by rainbow narratives. A royal dynasty was co-identified with that point of emergence whose authority, based on their supernatural ancestry that established the axis mundi, was instituted as a form of dual governance through the Tiamunyi, who embodied the axis mundi, and his Tsamaiya medicine priest, who linked the male aspect of the Tiamunyi’s authority with the Hero War twins that together represented the Above and Below as supernaturals that acted on the terrestrial middleplane, e.g., the mythic Twins represented governance over the totality of existence that was reflected in the rituals of the corn life-way. As grandsons of the Plumed Serpent and sons of the Sun the Hero War twins (note the light-water construct, a tinkuy) were given dominion over the earth (Cushing, 1896) as models for rulership, as exemplified by the Maya lords of Palenque (Freidel, et al., 2001:69). The Tsamaiya complex directly linked a fire-snake priesthood with a creation event and the Hero/War Twins that created the “Stone Ancients,” which established the fact that stone relics and idols used in ritual for wi’mi retained the spark of fire of governing supernatural authorities from the primordial world, where the source of fire, heat, and light was the Sun. Although the pan-Amerindian fire : water connection (igneous : aquatic paradigm) remains for the most part obscure due to lack of narrative resources, there is ample evidence to strongly suggest that fire-water was regarded as one substance, for lack of a better word, or better perhaps, one intertwined spiritual (metaphysical) entity, hence iconic twisted ropes and umbilical cords, wherein all fire-water representations signified eternity, when Spirit entered Time: it was out of the misty nature of the cosmic Serpent (pregnant, moist space) that clouds formed and the spirit of the personified Sun signified by radiant plumes (sun rays = luminous feathers) took form as the triadic space-time realm of the immortal Plumed Serpent.\n\nA bullet-style and briefest overview on the meaning of Twisted Gourd symbolism includes the following findings:\n\nI. Twisted Gourd symbolism represented a pan-Amerindian cosmovision among early agriculturalists who formed themselves into complex, theocratic societies based on an ideology of legitimate leadership. The cosmovision answered key questions related to the origin of life, the purpose of human life, the roles played by different sectors of society, and the regeneration of new life from the dead. The terrestrial plane was a self-contained, self-sustained bubble in space with known seasonally defined checkpoints that were authored by the gods and a routine system of maintenance — sometimes through crisis management– in the hands of high-status priests whom, with the assistance of their “pets” (the liminal animal lords), and knowledge (skilled wizardry, possession of proper wi-mi given to them by the gods to conduct effective ritual), could communicate with the creator gods in order to sustain the world and design interventions if necessary.\n\nII. The structure of the cosmos and the identity of those who served at the peak of social organization were integrally connected through the metaphor of an axis mundi, the World Tree, that extended from the celestial northern polar region as the apex of the trunk of the World Tree to its nadir– its roots in the underworld. The mechanics of that structural necessity that linked the vertically triadic cosmos–the Above, Center terrestrial plane, Below– and created the “dew, nectar” that would sustain the materialized cosmos in a circulatory movement of “dew” involved a trinity of archetypal (liminal cosmogonic category) predatory animal lords– Principal Snake, Feline, and Bird. The soul/spirit of those animal lords from a past material age that had been destroyed and recreated on three previous occasions were the anthropomorphic ancestors of hereditary lineages that had established a basis for legitimate rulership of the Sun of the Fourth World (Aztecs established the Fifth Sun mythology). By definition the herediatry ruler embodied the axis mundi and the god agency (Maker and Finisher of the Roads of life) that had authored it as radiant living water–a conduit of spirit– by materializing as personified zoomorphic forms that in fact had all extended from the Maker, the cosmic water Serpent that had first taken form as the Sun to establish the time-bound material world.\n\nIII The indexical metaphor was that of “centerplace” as the place of mist in the center of a three-dimensional, color-coded system of six celestial and terrestrial coordinates that each related to the centerplace. The fourth dimension of that triadic cosmos was the liminal space of “mist” as a metaphor for the dual nature of the cosmic radiant Serpent (the source of dew), which embodied all forms of visible water and gave rise to the other elements– fire, wind, and stone. The liminal place of mist where gods, living-dead ancestors who were revered because they were god-like through supernatural ancestry, and the officiants of terrestrial rulership came together (a “tinkuy”) to be heard linked the cosmic navel and hearth of the terrestrial plane with the Above and Below to sustain the flow of dew along the zenith-nadir axis and thereby sustain the materialization of the gods and their surrogates. Dew extended from the centerplace to all color-coded sacred directions based on proper ritual, gratitude, and chromatic prayer. The metric of the flow of dew between gods and nature was the ritual balance between predator and prey (predator : prey dyad) that was mirrored between the liminal realm of agency and the material world of visible and auditory acts (Maker : Doer paradigm). The wealth of the dew of the centerplace that was sustained by proper ritual and reciprocity–the basis of libation and feasting rituals and chromatic prayer– was extended out to the terrestrial cardinal and intercardinal directional through the correlates of dew– sunlight/fire and rain, the Igneous : Aquatic paradigm)– the metric of which was the balance between fertility and sacrifice (fertility : sacrifice dyad).\n\nIV. The indexical symbol for the misty centerplace (cosmic navel) and its visible terrestrial mirrors was the Twisted Gourd symbol, an idea symbolized by nested light and dark stepped triangles (staircase between realms, a bridge). That design reflected the mythical misty ancestral Mountain/cave in the context of a visible sacred mountain where ancestor veneration was practiced. The link between the triadic realms and the liminal and visible aspects of that design was the cosmic radiant water Serpent, shown as a stepped fret. Twisted Gourd symbolism was a Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud/lightning narrative of the primordial misty state– the time of the new that was symbolized by the catalytic quality of lightning–that was extended by a celestial narrative symbolized by an integrated system of quadripartite, quincunx, kan-kin, chakana, and checkerboard patterns that all pointed to stepped triangular forms that inferred movement between liminal and material states.\n\nThis symbolic language of an indigenous pan-Amerindian cosmovision and ideology of rulership revealed an interconnected cosmos that linked the Big Boss of a centerplace with the creator god(s), wherein the roles of the “god” agency (Maker and shaper of the Roads), Big Boss (Keeper and doer of the Roads– the proper traditions and rituals of the corn life-way), and commoner (grist for sustaining the divine Roads of communication based on the position of the Milky Way World Tree and east-to-west path of the ecliptic that took the sun through the underworld) were defined and mandatory. The rest is investigative detail and the archaeological and ethnographic proofs that supported this ancient cosmogonic model.\n\nIn its deepest sense, then, it is to Eternity and this triadic metaphysical reality that the Twisted Gourd symbol referred as a Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud-Lightning narrative pointing to the archetypal place materialized as the visible Temple/cave wherein the descendants of the first men and women made by the creator gods and the gods–the Road Makers– could become one. In functional terms the Twisted Gourd can be read as a Snake-Mountain/cave and a Cloud-Mountain/cave rebus where Snake and Cloud are all but synonymous. However, to get a resonant sense of the parallel liminal and visible worlds it represents, it should be viewed as one of the most notable, if not the most notable, pan-Amerindian visual kennings that, like traditional literary kennings of Maya hieroglyphics, Aztec literature, and Puebloan prayer-poems, charged visual representations and ritualized vocal expressions through their deep metaphysical roots in supernatural agencies that connected the immortal living-dead shades of animal and anthropomorphic clan ancients with their living descendants (Hull, 2011; Jones, K.L., 2010; see visual conventions). In short, the symbolism and language of ritual, replete with diphrastic kennings that vocalized the completion of what was humanly desired through the agency of ancestors, was the creative language of materialization.\n\nIt is notable that all Puebloan ritual centers around “thinkers” and singers who could establish the consecrated ritual space and roads for this reunion, which was also an idea formulated by Greek philosophers and after them by Immanuel Kant, who said that metaphysics was the queen of the sciences because it was that which gave birth to all physical phenomena. The idea that the visible world was the output of individual and hence collective thought (“communities of thought,” scientific paradigms, etc.) was given more credence, and once again aligned with indigenous people’s thought, when the Nobel laureate physicist Max Planck said, “I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as a derivative of consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing postulates consciousness” (The Observer, London, 1931). “As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much: There is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter” (The Nature of Matter, 1944).\n\nRitual was prayer, and like prayer observed the world over it was an organized, collective metaphysical response by the Road Keepers to what was observed in the visible world. Prayer was always and still is a return to the original source material, and through feathered prayer sticks the Puebloans made a directions-based (color-coded roads) science of it. The color-coded roads of the Milky Way that were traveled by the Hero Twins was a concept that was preserved in a foundational corn myth of the Maya, which likely was the basis for this widely shared cosmology that was materialized as ritual agency (Tedlock, 1996:36; San Bartolo murals c. 150 BCE). The Stone Ancients called the Tsamaiya (Tcamahia, a mythological warrior) are directly linked to the broader category of kopishtaiya stone idols that included the Hero/War Twins, Venus as the warrior for the sun and avatar of the Plumed Serpent, stone animal fetishes, and ancestral rainbow- and lightning-makers. The Stone Ancients placed on altars established a liminal (nontemporal) ritual environment that revivified the primordial state during rituals that were based in the supernatural powers of the “roads” of the six directions and the supernatural that ultimately empowered and unified them, the Plumed Serpent. More precisely, the six directions of the universe comprised the vertically triadic cosmos (Above, Center, Below) extended across a horizontally quadripartite terrestrial plane (north, west, south, east, Center) to represent the integrated concept of cosmos, divinity, and rulership. All roads led to and passed through the Center.\n\nThis event, the third major point of direct contact between the early Puebloans and Mayan cosmology, had a direct parallel with a nearly identical event that established the power and authority of stone relics and gods of a Maya Quetzalcoatl cult whose story was preserved in the Mesoamerican foundational corn myth, the Popol vuh. The Tsamaiya complex proved conclusively that supernatural ancestry was the basis of religious status and was tied to political authority through hereditary Keresan leadership of Snake-Antelope and Horn-Flute clans that were all related through Snake woman and the Tiamunyi/Tsamaiya twin. This finding was attested by the artifacts found in the Bonitian northern ancestral burial crypt and Snake ritual and folklore among the descendants of the Chacoans. The enormous power and influence of the Tsamaiya (Tcamahia) war medicine priest, in relation to the power of the Tiamunyi, who was the “mother-father” of his community, has a strong parallel in the high priest at the priestly center of Mitla in Oaxaca, a shrine to Twisted Gourd symbolism, where the Zapotecan king bowed to his high priest, followed his instructions, and was at death entombed by him.\n\nThe mythology of the Stone Ancients was barely documented in ethnographic reporting, but enough of an outline could be reconstructed working across all Puebloan documentary resources to identify 1) the centrality of its authority in Puebloan ritual culture and social status, 2) the fact that “Stone Ancients” co-identified with an actual location called Chi-pia, “place of beginnings”, and their descendants, the high priests who worked there, and 3) the ways in which the story of the Stone Ancients was materialized and preserved through the possession of high-value relics (wi’mi). While a great deal remains to be learned about the Keres Tsamaiya Stone Ancients (alt. spellings: Tcamahia, Chama-hiya, Chamahia), our current basis for understanding rests on a very strong parallel between Pueblo origin stories and the Maya’s Popol vuh regarding the way in which the creator/beast gods working through the Hero/War Twins formed the metaphysical bridge between the (liminal) Third and the currently visible Fourth World through authoritative mythology that described how it was that anthropomorphic and zoomorphic stone fetishes and idols came in power as the agencies of the initiation, weather, war, and healing rituals of this world.\n\nMain Conclusions:\n\nThe visual narrative of the Twisted Gourd symbol as an ideogram was as a timeless and therefore enduring Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud/lightning “born of the gods” origin story of hereditary rulership. The task of Andean, Mayan, and Puebloan visual arts in the context of Twisted Gourd symbolism was to show the everywhere-present liminal “misty” state of the creator gods that was co-identified with “living water” and the timeless misty place of the ancestors as the vital biography of hereditary rulers in a hierarchically organized society. The mythology of the first organized religion of the first hierarchically organized civilizations of the Americas as encoded in Twisted Gourd symbolism begins and ends with the role of the cosmic Serpent as primordial mist (liminal space), whose omniscient spirit was embodied in the water cycle, the primary metaphor of which was the Milky Way-sky river of life. That one metaphor was the basis of all storm mythology in relation to divinity, the materialized signs of which were wind, lightning, thunder, clouds, and seasonal water cycles. Out of the mists of the Serpent the sun god materialized, which formed the basis of all light and heat, hence the igneous : aquatic paradigm as materialized by the cosmic Plumed Serpent and the supernatural lineages that extended from it that were embodied in the offices of a hierarchical social organization. It is also important to realize that in the omniscient, everywhere-present misty space of the cosmic Serpent, a space that it organized into sacred roads (directions) to serve the material world just as a developer would first lay out the grid of roads for a new community, the possibilities of the seeds of all life forms also resided. The checkerboard pattern was at once a symbol for the Milky Way-sky as the realm of the cosmic bicephalic Serpent and also the overarching concept of the place of dualism, wherein the liminal and material realms met in the Mountain/cave. In terms of an archetypal ordering principle the Mountain/cave had mirrored forms as houses in the Above, Middle, and Below, e.g., the axis mundi conceived as a vertically triadic centerpole linking three great houses along a “road.” Stories of the Hero/War Twins, the daily birth of the sun god from a cave in the east, clouds, lightning, wind, rivers, and the provision of seeds all referred to the backstory of the archetypal Mountain/cave as the centerplace of origin and the birth of the sun, when time began.\n\nThis study concludes that the Bonitian dynasty, a Keresan-speaking family that probably worked through a council constituted by Great House elites, exerted strong influence if not complete control over the religious and executive functions that governed the Chacoan world through dynastic Snake-Antelope and Horn/Flute clans. The co-identification of the Keres with Snake ancestry, ancestral Stone Ancients, the Hero War twins, and Keresan as “the language of the underworld” defined their right to establish the rituals of the corn life-way as controlled by medicine priests, e.g., the rules of the Roads (sacred directions). The Chacoan system of Great Houses and the Chi-pia initiation centers at NE, SE, SW, and NW corners of the Chaco world represented a “rainbow” state-in-the-making based on a system of six color-coded sacred directions that met at a centerpoint wherein the vertical North-South celestial axis constituted the axis mundi that was embodied in the Tiamunyi and his Tsamaiya twin. The mythological basis of the axis mundi was attested by the Plumed Serpent, a tripartite liminal entity embodied in nature powers that represented Above, Middle, and Below Sun-Cloud functions in the cosmic scheme that extended from the celestial House of the North to the Mountain/cave cosmic navel on the terrestrial plane. In the Popol vuh this same construct was called “Heart of Sky/Heart of the Earth.” The celestial House of the North comprised an area of space centered on the northern polestar that was circumscribed by the rotation of the Big Dipper and known to both Mayans and Puebloans as “Heart of Sky,” another major point of contact between Maya and Pueblo cultures.\n\nThe overarching point of contact between a South- Meso-, and North American ideology of leadership based in the ancestral Mountain/cave centerpoint of the sacred directions, e.g., the navel of the cosmos, was the Twisted Gourd symbol. The Twisted Gourd symbol was a pan-Amerindian Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud/lightning ideogram that was associated with ceremonial centers established by ruling dynasties that associated themselves with the primordial and mythological Mountain/cave of the origin of life. This mythological cave was liminal in nature, meaning that it represented the invisible and nontemporal aspect of the supernatural creators of life and the sun-water creative processes they embodied, wherein “sun” stood for all processes related to heat, light, and fire and “water” stood for all phases of water ranging from the invisible spirit of water to mist, steam, ice, and rainfall. The union of fire and water as a cosmogonic agency became the basis of the pan-Amerindian igneous : aquatic paradigm. The liminal Mountain/cave as the interior “navel” of the earth (“Heart of Earth”) extended onto the terrestrial plane as a system of four sacred mountains connected to the celestial North-South axis mundi. This six-point cosmogram (“sacred roads”) arranged around a Centerpoint, e.g., the seventh direction, in the context of Twisted Gourd symbolism and very similar ideas about its mythological constituents that were encoded by all the terms represented herein in quotes (navel, Heart of Sky, etc) was clearly identified among the ancestral Puebloans of the American Southwest and the Maya of southern Mexico and the Yucatan peninsula. This cosmology fundamentally brought together the Maker(s) of the Roads, e.g., the Plumed Serpent (radiant water) and the path of the sun, and the Keepers of the Roads, e.g., a dynastic lineage that embodied the axis mundi through supernatural ancestry that extended from the makers of sun, water, and the seeds of life. At the nexus of this association are found the Hero War twins who descended from the Makers of the Roads (totality of visible life extending from the unified liminal realm of sun-water supernaturals) and become the supernatural patrons of the dynastic human lineages that constituted the Keepers of the Roads. Together the Hero War twins constituted the “Above” (elder brother) and “Below” (younger brother), that fundamentally materialized the life-to-death-to-rebirth processes of the balanced life cycle, which can further be broken down under the theme of “reciprocity” (balance) as predator : prey and fertility : sacrifice dyads that were first documented in Cupisnique art during the Formative period in Peru and associated with Twisted Gourd symbolism. In the transmission of this ideology of leadership to the Maya by 300-150 BCE we must recognize these dyads as code for ruler and ruled and the Hero War twins as the divinely sanctioned law-and-order agency of rulership.\n\nThe social implications of this cannot be overstated. It meant, for starters, that obedience to the Keepers of the Roads constituted veneration of the Makers of the Roads, and nourishment of the Makers that sustained life required like-in-kind sacrifice in forms of blood, tribute, and service.\n\nThis cosmo-mythology extending across a bridge of myth-history and into the actual governance of early agricultural societies through the corn life-way is such a consistently strong pattern associated with Twisted Gourd symbolism that it strongly suggests that the system of governance the ancestral Puebloans adopted was in fact a pan-Amerindian ideology of leadership that fostered hierarchically organized early agricultural communities based on the lineage that “owned” the Twisted Gourd symbol, e.g., the lineage that through supernatural ancestry had kinship ties with the Makers of the Roads and could influence time, space, and the materialization of benefits.\n\nImportance of the Work. What must be emphasized first, even before the dozen or more significant findings that led to this point, was the contribution the ancestral Puebloans and their modern descendants made towards informing the basis of social governance and organization in the rise of civilization in early agricultural societies. The relevant factors were a compelling ideology and how leadership was defined. By the time the ancestral Puebloans received it by no later than 800 CE, the ideology of leadership based in Twisted Gourd symbolism and the Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud complex was already over 1,000 years old based solely on the Mesoamerican evidence and not the older evidence from Central and South America.\n\nIn the Puebloan case study it was demonstrated how an international ideology of leadership cast in cosmological and cosmogonic terms related to the axis mundi and sacred directions was embraced by ancestral Puebloans and reframed in local terms as seen in the preeminence of the Antelope and Snake clans. The Acoma origin myth provided a step-by-step guide as to how that was accomplished and pointed out the significance of rainbow symbolism as the “all directions” Centerplace to which the color-coded directions led and where they united as the genius of water. The rainbow was and remains a tinkuy, the union of light and water that signified sky-earth complementary pairs. In pan-Mesoamerican terms elucidated by Dr. Alfredo López Austin, the rainbow was the resolution of the igneous : aquatic paradigm that undergirded the purpose of ritual to connect the male ancestor of the sky with the female ancestor of earth as those supernatural parents were expressed in a ruling human pair in which the male role was dominant. When a leader such as a tiamunyi, pekwin, or cacique was called a mother-father of his people, it was the relationship that actor had with the supernatural CNP-nadir axis mundi, literally a parental tree of life, that gave him his authority and established the basis of ritual to sustain the corn life-way. The supernatural that established the axis mundi parentage of the ancestral Keres Tiamunyi and his medicine priest called the Tsamaiya was the Plumed Serpent.\n\nIn this report the South American amaru and the Puebloan’s Heshanavaiya were co-identified. As a “two-headed” androgynous rainbow snake, a master entity of light and fertile water, it connected the CNP-nadir and E-W axes that integrated the source of water, the Milky Way river cycling through the underworld primordial ocean, with the source of light, the path of the sun. What that does is to open up a great deal of pan-Amerindian ethnographic material as the informant to the local case in order to ask the right questions. The rainbow Centerplace of a Snake-Mountain/cave-Cloud ideogram called the Twisted Gourd symbol was key to understanding how supernatural actors that embodied light and water were embodied in human rulers who established ritual. The Puebloan case turned out to be an astonishing trove of ethnographic and archaeological material that shed new light on a 4,000-year-old cosmology that defined religion and politics.\n\nThis investigation also identified the Mexicanized-Maya basis of the identity of the Puebloan’s Hero War twins and established the fact that the Popol vuh, the foundational Mesoamerican corn myth, informed the Puebloan case. That again opens up a pan-Mesoamerican research database that will continue to inform the Puebloan case. The first fruit of that co-identity was to look at Puebloan material with the understanding that the Hero Twins had been the cosmological model for rulership and political charter for governance that had been developed by Maya kings and af"
