        "text": "“Our writers call these stars Vergiliae, because they rise after spring. They have still greater honour than the others, too, because their rising is a sign of summer, their setting of winter – a thing is not true of the other constellations.”\n\nHyginus, Astronomica 2.21\n\nIn the winter sky at Samhain, the Pleiades lie on the shoulder of the bull which is the constellation of Taurus. The bull faces east towards Orion the Hunter, who apparently extends his left hand towards the bull, maybe to offer it something or maybe to club it. Below Orion is Lepus the Hare, and behind him are the two hunting dogs, Canis Major [which has the bright star Sirius as its left eye] and Canis Minor. The Pleiades are a bright star cluster and while they are called often the Seven Sisters usually only six stars can be seen with the naked eye, though in ideal conditions, up to nine or more can be discerned; in 1579, well before the invention of the telescope, the astronomer Moestlin drew eleven Pleiades stars, while Kepler quoted observations of up to fourteen. Actually, they number several hundred. They often appear to have a bluish tinge, which prompted Alfred, Lord Tennyson to describe them as “a swarm of fireflies, tangled in a silver braid.”\n\nThough Samhain is usually just calculated as a cross quarter day between the autumn equinox and winter solstice, the real astronomical marker for Samhain is the position of the Pleiades. During November the stars of the Pleiades rise in the east as the sun sets, reach their highest place in the sky – almost directly overhead – at midnight, and then set at sunrise. They can be seen in the sky for nearly the entire night. At Samhain the sun and the Pleiades are in opposition [on opposite sides of us], which happens only once in each Wheel of the Year. The Pleiades pass though the zenith of the heavens quite often, but only through the zenith at midnight on one day each year.\n\nConversely, starting about the middle of May [Beltane Old Style] the sun is aligned between the Earth and the stars of the Pleiades i.e., the Sun is conjunct to the Pleiades, and because of this the cluster is not visible at any time of the night; it seems to disappear from the sky for a time. The heliacal rising of the Pleiades [i.e., at dawn] in early June heralds the coming of the summer rain. In Lithuania, the Sietynas [Pleiades] were associated with the start of the rainy days and the Romans even used the word Pleiades as a poetic kenning for thunder and rain showers.\n\nNoting and honouring the position of the Pleiades in the night sky was extremely important for the ancients and continued to be so in many parts of the world well into the twentieth century. They were mentioned by Homer, in both Iliad and Odyssey [about 750 B.C.-720 BC] and Hesiod [about 700 BC]. Ancient Greek astronomers Eudoxus of Knidos (c. 403-350 BC) and Aratos of Phainomena (c. 270 BC) listed them as The Clusterers. There are three references to the Pleiades in the Bible. Many ancient monuments including some British standing stone circles, Polynesian temples, and the pyramids in Egypt and South America were aligned to the rising of the star constellation of the Pleiades at October’s end. In ancient Greece several temples were lined up with the rising and setting of the Seven Sisters, including the Parthenon and Hecatompedon for the rising, and the temple of Bacchus in Athens, Ascelpieion at Epidaurus and Sunium for their setting. In Mexico the Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan was orientated to the setting of the Pleiades on the horizon, as were all of the city’s westerly running streets. The Pleiades are also believed to be connected to the Great Pyramid of Giza; at times in history they have been perfectly aligned with the southern entrance and their light could be seen within.\n\nThe ancients used the heavens as their visible calendar, and we often underestimate the power and importance of star cycles and star myths in the ancient world. The turning stars, the course of the sun and the waxing and waning of the moon were used to plot the passage of time, in days, months, years and greater cycles still, like the fifty-two year cycle of the Pleiades midnight zenith, called a Great Year [every fifty-two years a celebration in Mesoamerica was timed to when the Pleiades were directly overhead at midnight.].\n\nMany calendar systems, whether sacred or pastoral, utilized the positions of the Pleiades. An ancient pre-Vedic calendar was discovered in Tirvalon naming the month which roughly equates to our November as Kartica, the Pleiades. In the Doric era of ancient Greece, the calendar was also regulated by the position of the Pleiades. It had two prime times, at the beginning of May and the beginning of November, relating to the location of the Pleiades. Between May and November it was safe to sail, and some think the name of the stars means ‘to sail’. Furthermore, Hippocrates divided the year into four seasons based on the Pleiades and their relationship to the Sun and referred to the “Pleiad-month” that begins “on the day of midnight culmination” – about November 17th [near Old Style Samhain].\n\nThe Pleiades in Spring heralded the seasons of planting [certain South African tribes called them the ‘hoeing stars’, since their spring appearance in the sky was a signal to plant], and then seasonal decline when they are again significant at the start of winter and linked with festivals of the dead and death. Various cultures held celebrations of the dead when the Pleiades were at their highest point in the midnight sky, from the Mexicans, Aztecs, Hindus, Persians and Japanese, to the ancient Egyptians. Samhain, the Celtic festival of the dead fell at the midpoint between the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice, and the Celts knew exactly when that was because it took place when the Pleiades culminated at midnight. Moreover, for some, they signalled not only the Night of the Dead, but the end of the world itself. The energy of this period was considered so powerful and potentially dangerous, that it was the time when major cataclysms were reputed to have happened such as the biblical flood or the sinking of Atlantis.\n\nThe Greeks thought that the Pleiades led the eternal dance of the stars around the heavens. The Greek word “Pleiades” is still the name we know the stars by today. It may be derived from either the word for “to sail”, or from pleios meaning “full” or “many”, though Lamprocles said that the Pleiades have the same name as the doves (peleiades). 1 The visible stars are named for the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione: Alcyone, Asterope (a double star, also sometimes called Sterope), Electra, Maia, Merope, Taygeta and Celaeno. According to the myth, the great hunter Orion, overcome by lust, attempted to rape them and Zeus, pitying their plight, turned them into doves and placed them in the heavens. Orion still follows them closely through the night sky, hoping to catch up with them and have his wicked way. The reason that only six of the seven known stars could be seen was attributed to the fact that while six mated with gods, Merope was said to have been the wife of the human Sisyphus. Because of her shame, her star is dim.\n\nThe Greeks set their seeding and harvests by the Pleiades. According to Hesiod “When the Pleiades are rising begin your harvest, and your ploughing when they are going to set. Forty nights and days they are hidden and appear again as the year moves round, when first you sharpen your sickle.” 2\n\nThe Pleiades were also harbingers of storms and bad weather in the winter, and thus the end of the sailing season. Hesiod again: “… if desire for uncomfortable sea-faring seize you; when the Pleiades plunge into the misty sea [end of October] to escape Orion’s rude strength, then truly gales of all kinds rage,”3 and “but when they spied vessels, the billows swelled with rage, and the hurricane arose against man. Then the Pleiades and the Olenian Goat [the constellation Capra whose rising denoted the beginning of stormy weather] grew dark with storm, and Orion was more wrathful than his wont.” 4\n\nNatives of the Tonga Islands called the Pleiades Matarii or the Little Eyes. The two seasons of the year were divided by the Pleiades; the first, Matarrii i nia, the Pleiades Above, began when, in the evening, they appeared on the horizon. The other season, Mararrii i raro, the Pleiades Below, began when, at sunset, they ceased to be visible. 5\n\nThe Japanese have over sixty terms for the Pleiades, with Subaru being the best known through its recent use as the name of a car. Subaru is generally thought to mean “united” or “getting together”. In some agricultural areas of Japan, the word Suharu (“group tied”) has been used instead of Subaru, referring to grain tied in a bundle. In other farming areas, the stars of Subaru were simply seen as seeds, and their rising with the sun in Spring signalled a time to plant seeds. In some coastal areas, Japanese fishermen viewed them as a kind of fishing net made of stones and bamboo (Sumaru) and used the rising and setting of the bright “net” to determine when to cast their own nets.\n\nTo the Adnyamathanha people of South Australia, the stars in the Pleiades were a group of women called the ‘Makara’ married to some of the stars in the constellation of Orion. The Makara were known for their great beauty, with long flowing hair and their bodies covered in icicles. As the Makara first rise in the eastern sky a layer of frost is spread across the ground as they travel, the result of ice falling from their bodies.\n\nIn Lithuania, the Pleiades are known as Sietynas which is usually translated as ‘lustre’, though a more archaic version of the name is Sietas meaning ‘sieve’ or Dangaus sietas ‘heavenly sieve’, the stars being the holes of the sieve. It was noted that the stars travelled through the sky during the long nights of November along the similar trajectory as the Sun in summer, hence the saying: “The Sietynas goes along the same road as the Sun in summer’ and ‘…[the Pleiades] go around the Earth at the same time as the Sun; only the Sun goes in the day-time and it moves at night’. People would even tell time by their position, ‘‘When the Sietynas is coming up it is before midnight but when it goes down it is past midnight’ “. About the time of the zenith, they are said to be located ‘in the middle of the sky’ or ‘right above the head’. By the end of April the Sietynas dissolve in the evening-glow and remain invisible throughout the summer nights and signified the start of the spring and the farming season. It was said ‘The Sietas disappears – the cuckoo starts its song’. 6\n\nFor the Aztecs the Pleiades were Tianquiztli: ‘Marketplace’ or ‘Gathering Place’, and for the Incas, The Seed Scatterer or Sower. The Aztecs linked the date when the constellation reached its highest point at midnight with the end of the world. They believed that every fifty-two years, when their 365-day sun calendar and 260-day ritual calendar came into alignment, the possibility existed that the heavens would cease to move and demons would fall from the sky. However, if the Pleiades reached their zenith at midnight and then continued harmlessly across the sky, all would be well. The Aztec and Maya not only believed that the world would come to an end on one of these Pleiades overhead-at-midnight points, but were convinced that the world had already been destroyed and recreated four times on just such a night. The end of this fifty-two-year cycle was celebrated with the New Fire ceremony, which involved a human sacrifice. The last recorded New Fire ceremony occurred on November 14th 1507.\n\nThe date of the midnight zenith of the Pleiades is subject to precession; both the Pleiadian zenith passage at midnight in November and the sun-Pleiades conjunction in May move forward though the year with precession. The date of the Pleiades’s exact midnight zenith [every fifty-two years] defines an event that always occurs exactly six year later: the exact conjunction of the Pleiades with the sun. In the tropics, the sun can pass through the zenith (the exact centre of the sky) twice every year. Every fifty two or one hundred and four years, the New Fire festival date needed to be adjusted by shifting it one day forward. Precession can be tracked by noticing the changing rise times of stars. In doing so, the astronomers noted that the sun and Pleiades in conjunction were moving closer and closer to the exact zenith of the sky, which was symbolised by the serpent-bird deity Quetzalcoatl, via precession, slowly approaching his throne in the zenith of the heavens. John Major Jenkins points out that this may be represented at the Pyramid of Kukulcan [Quetzalcoatl ]at Chichen Itza.7 At every equinox a shadow-serpent appears and slithers down the stairs of the northern balustrade. In the Yucatec Maya language, the word for a snake’s rattle, tzab, is the same word for the Pleiades. During his accession rites, a Mayan king would have to undergo a similar shamanic journey to the Cosmic Centre, situated in the Milky Way.\n\nIn ancient Egypt the Pleiades were called Chu and said to represent the goddess Net or Neith, the “divine mother and lady of heaven”, a sky goddess associated with war and wisdom, often shown with a line of stars across her back. Her title “Opener of the Sun’s paths in all her stations” may refer to the appearance of the Pleiades at the rising and setting of the sun at different times of year. She is often referred to in Egyptian texts as the “eldest,” and even as the “first” deity, self created and she may have had some function as the creator of stars and the giver of life and rebirth.\n\nThe Pleiades may also represent the Seven Hathors, the goddesses who appear at birth and death, and in this form, be connected with doves, as they were in Greek legend. In many mythologies, the dove or some other bird represents the soul after death, and it seems that the Pleiades were intimately connected with the mysteries of death- at Samhain, and rebirth – at Beltane. It may be that they were thought to guard the gates of the afterlife, opening them at Samhain so that contact with the dead could be made, or even conveying the dead souls into the afterlife during that period. In Northern European Countries there was an All Souls Day tradition of offering prayers for the dead in the direction of the Pleiades, though this was actively suppressed by the Church.\n\n© Anna Franklin"
