        "text": "Greek Mythology >> Star Myths (Constellations)\n\nSTAR MYTHS\n\nThe Greek word for constellations was katasterismoi. Of these, the twelve signs whose paths intersect with the dawn rising of the sun were known as zodiakos (the zodiac) or zodiakos kyrklos (circle of small animals). The constellations, as described in Greek mythology, were mostly god-favoured heroes and beasts who received a place amongst the stars as a memorial of their deeds. They were regarded as semi-divine spirits--living, conscious entities which strode across the heavens.\n\nThe main sources of Greek star myths were the lost astronomical poems of Hesiod and Pherecydes and later works by Pseudo-Eratosthenes, Aratus and Hyginus.\n\nI. THE ZODIAC\n\nII. OTHER CONSTELLATIONS\n\nREVOLUTIONS OF THE CONSTELLATIONS\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the basic visible mechanics of constellar movement, what follows is a brief outline, including Greek beliefs regarding the behaviour of the stars.\n\nThe constellations revolve round a central point in the northern sky known as the pole star, or heavenly axis (Greek polos). Because of its far northern location, most of the stars are seen to rise in the east and set in the west. Only those few closest to the pole--namely, Ursa Major and Minor (the Bears), and Draco (the Dragon)--appear to travel at night in an eternal circle around the pole.\n\nNot all of the constellations are visible in the night sky throughout the year. The first appearance of a constellation in the sky, occurs on the western horizon just prior to dawn (its so-called heliacal rising). As the months progress it is seen to rise earlier and earlier in the night, and gradually assumes a higher position in the heavens prior to dawn, until one evening, it has reached the western horizon, before dissappearing completely from view (which is known as the constellation's astronomical setting).\n\nThe most important of the heliacal risings were those of the twelve constellations of the zodiac. They were said to rule the heavens for the period in which their position on the eastern horizon prior to dawn was replaced by the rising sun. So, for example, Gemini first rises above the eastern horizon in late May, appearing in the sky just prior to dawn, where its position is immediately replaced by the rising sun. As the constellation gradually rises earlier and earlier in the night, its place on the solar horizon at dawn is eventually replaced by the next constellation of the zodiac, namely Cancer, in mid June.\n\nThe Greeks imagined the heavens as a great, solid dome, which, some say, was forged of bronze, and upon which the heavenly constellations were fixed. The Titan Atlas, who stood either beneath the axis of heaven in the far north (in the land of the Hyperboreans), or at heaven's western rim in by the Atlas mountains in North Africa, was said to spin the dome around upon his shoulders, causing the stars to rise and set.\n\nPart of the heavenly dome always lay beneath the horizon. Here the constellations were apparently believed to dwell deep beneath the earth in the misty pit of Tartaros, or else within the lands of the dead. When they rose up into the heavens, the constellations were first bathed in the purifying waters of the great earth-encircling river Okeano. Various myths describe the birth and death of the semi-immortal constellations: such as the Gemini twins, or Dioskouroi, who were said to divide their time equally between Heaven and Haides. Orion was also described by Homer both striding across the heavens and hunting wild beasts in the underworld.\n\nIMAGES OF THE CONSTELLATIONS\n\nThere are very few surviving depictions of the constellations in classical art: at most, a few Roman mosaics, and a partial depiction on the famous Farnese statue of the Titan Atlas.\n\nThe images on this page are from a Renaissance-era ceiling fresco (circa 1573) decorating the Villa Farnese in Caprarola, Italy.\n\nKEY TO INDIVIDUAL ENTRIES\n\nHEADING The common English name for the constellation.\n\nLatin : the Roman name of the constellation (usually the same as the one used in English today)\n\nGreek : The Greek name of the constellation.\n\nAkkadian & Sumerian : The old Eastern name for the constellation, predating the Greek. *\n\nNAME A character associated with the constellation in surviving compilations of star myths.\n\n* The form and arrangment of the heavenly constellations was adopted by the Greeks from the sea-trading Phoenicians of the East, who in turn had received them from the Assyrians, and they from their forefathers the ancient Sumerians. As a result the Greeks had a number of alternate myths describing each of the star groups, as the foreign traditions were translated in different ways by the various regions and poetical traditions of ancient Greece.\n\nSUMERIAN & AKKADIAN CONSTELLATIONS\n\nFor a list of Sumerian and Akkadian constellation names see : The Star Catalogue (external link).\n\nCONSTELLATIONS & THE ADVENTURES OF HERACLES\n\nHeracles, \"glory of the air,\" had his labours represented amongst the stars of heaven. The formula was evidently adopted from eastern sources, in particular the star myths of the so-called \"Phoenician Heracles,\" the hero-god of Lebanon, Melqart. A number of his labours, although missing from the late Greek constellar arrangements, are perhaps recognisable in their older Eastern forms.\n\nThe adventures of Heracles can be paired with the following constellations : (1) the Nemean Lion, constellation Leo; (2) the Hydra and Crab, constellations Hydra and Cancer; (3) the Stymphalian Birds, constellations Lyra and Cygnus; (4) the Cretan Bull, constellation Taurus; (5) the Hesperian Dragon, constellation Serpens; (6) Herakles wrestling Apollon, constellation Gemini; (7) Prometheus and the Caucasian Eagle, constellations Hercules and Aquilla; (8) the centaur Cheiron or Pholus, constellation Saggitarius or Centaurus; et. al.\n\nANDROMEDA\n\nLatin : Andromeda\n\nGreek : AndromedÃª\n\nSumerian : LU.LIM (the Stag)\n\nAkkadian : Lulimu (the Stag)\n\nANDROMEDA A Princess of Ethiopia, daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopea. Her mother offended the gods by boasting that the girl was more beautiful than the Nereids. Poseidon in wrath sent a sea-monster to devour the girl. When she was chained to the rocks, the hero Perseus spied her, slew the beast, and carried her off as his wife. The gods as a memorial, set the whole family amongst the stars as constellations. (Hyginus 2.11, Aratus 197.)\n\nAQUARIUS\n\nLatin : Aquarius (Water Bearer)\n\nGreek : Hydrokhoos (Water-Bearer)\n\nSumerian : GU.LA (the Great)\n\nGANYMEDES A handsome Trojan prince. He was seized and carried off to heaven by an eagle sent down by Zeus, to become the cup-bearer of the gods. The eagle and boy were subsequently placed amongst the stars as the constellations Aquila and Aquarius. (Hyginus 2.16 & 2.29.)\n\nDEUCALION An early Greek king who managed to survive the great Deluge that was sent by Zeus to destroy mankind. Because so much rain fell during his reign he was represented amongst the stars as the Water-Pourer. (Hyginus 2.29 on Hegesianax.)\n\nCECROPS An early king of Athens who was the first to pour libations in honour of the gods. In memory of this he was placed in the heavens as the water-pourer Aquarius. (Hyginus 2.29 on Eubulus.)\n\nAQUILA\n\nLatin : Aquila (the Eagle)\n\nGreek : AiÃªtos (the Eagle)\n\nAkkadian : ErÃ» (the Eagle)\n\nSumerian : Ã.MUSHEN (the Eagle)\n\nEAGLE OF APHRODITE When Zeus wished to seduce the goddess Nemesis, he transformed himself into a swan, and bade Aphrodite pursue him into her lap in the guise of an eagle. In this way he accomplished his seduction and in memorial placed an eagle and swan amongst the stars. (Hyginus 2.8.)\n\nEAGLE OF PROMETHEUS An eagle which was set by Zeus feed on the liver of the chained Titan Prometheus. When Heracles freed him from his chains, he slew the eagle with an arrow, and Zeus placed the pair amongst the stars as Aquila (eagle) and Sagitta (arrow). (Hyginus 2.15.)\n\nEAGLE OF ZEUS 1 The eagle which Zeus sent to snatch the handsome Trojan youth Ganymedes up to heaven. The boy and eagle were placed amongst the stars as the adjacent constellations Aquarius and Aquila. (Hyginus 2.16.)\n\nEAGLE OF ZEUS 2 An eagle which appeared to Zeus as a sign of good omen when he was sacrificing on an altar prior to the commencement of his war against the Titans. To commemorate the event he placed the eagle and altar amongst the stars as the constellations Aquila and Ara. (Hyginus 2.16.)\n\nEAGLE OF ZEUS 3 When Hermes was wooing the goddess Aphrodite she spurned his advances. Zeus, pitying his son, sent an eagle which snatched away her sandal and delivered it the god, which he used to barter for her favours. The eagle was rewarded with a place amonst the stars. (Hyginus 2.16.)\n\nMEROPES A King of Cos whose wife was killed by Artemis for spurning her worship. When he was about to commit suicide in his grief, Hera transformed Meropes into an eagle and placed him amongst the stars in the form of Aquila. (Hyginus 2.16 on Aglaosthenes.)\n\nARA\n\nLatin : Ara (the Altar)\n\nGreek : ThytÃªrios (the Altar)\n\nALTAR OF ZEUS When Zeus had gathered allies for the Titan War, they made sacrifices on an atlar constructed by the Cyclopes to pledge their alliegance. In memorial the god placed it amongst the stars as the constellation Ara. The rising of its stars heralded the storms of late autumn. (Hyginus 2.39.)\n\nALTAR OF PHOLUS The kindly centaur Pholus was set amongst the stars by Zeus for his skill in augury. He was depicted pouring libations at the atlar in the form of the three constellations Ara (the Altar), Crater (the Cup), and Centaurus (the Centaur). (Hyginus 2.38.)\n\nARGO\n\nLatin : Argo\n\nGreek : ArgÃ´ (the Silver (Ship)\n\nARGO The ship of the hero Argonauts which was constructed by Argus and Athena, with a talking beam placed on its prow. After their voyage in search of the Golden Fleece, the ship was placed amongst the stars in memorial as the constellation Argo.

Upon reaching Colchis the ram shed its golden fleece for Phrixus who hung it in a sacred grove, and flew up to the heavens to take a place amongst the stars as the dimly shining constellation Aries. (Hyginus 2.20 on Hesiod & Pherecydes & Eratosthenes.)\n\nRAM OF AMMON 1 When the god Dionysus led his armies into Africa and they were suffering in the desert, a ram appeared and guided him to the springs of Ammon. As a memorial the god set the creature amongst the stars as the constellation Aries, first of the twelve signs of the zodiac. {Hyginus 2.20 on Hermippus.)\n\nRAM OF AMMON 2 An Egyptian (god) named Hammon was the first to herd flocks of sheep. To honour his gift to mankind, a ram was set amongst the stars.

(Hyginus 2.13 on Eratosthenes.)\n\nMYRTILUS The charioteer of King Oinomaos of Pisa, and a son of the god Hermes. When he was murdered by Pelops, his father set him in the heavens as the constellation Auriga. (Hyginus 2.13.)\n\nORSILOCHUS An Argive man who in local legend was the inventor of the chariot. The gods placed him amongst the stars as Auriga in memorial. (Hyginus 2.13.)\n\nAEX OF HELIUS A goatish daughter of Helius the sun, who was hidden away in a cave by the Titan gods because of her fearsome face. When Zeus sought to overthrow these same Titans he was told by an oracle to make a goat-skin cape, and so he slew Aex and crafted the aegis. He then placed Aex among the stars as Capra. (Hyginus 2.13.)\n\nAEX OF PAN The goatish wife of the god Pan. Zeus coupled with her and she bore the god Aegipan. Because Zeus was fond of both he placed the pair amongst the stars as the constellations Capra and Capricorn. (Hyginus 2.13 on Euhemerus.)\n\nAMALTHEA & THE KIDS A she-goat which nursed the infant Zeus with milk on the Cretan Mount Ida. As a reward for its service the god placed the goat and its two kids amongst the stars about the constellation Auriga: Capra the goat sitting on his left shoulder, and the Kids in his left hand. (Hyginus 2.13 on Parmeniscus, Aratus 161.)\n\nBOOTES\n\nLatin : Bootes\n\nGreek : BoÃ´tes (the Wagon-Driver) or Arktophylax (the Bear-Watcher)\n\nAkkadian : Niru (the Yoke)\n\nSumerian : SHUDUN (the Yoke)\n\nARCAS An early king of Arkadia.

(Hyginus 2.23.)\n\nASSES OF DIONYSUS 1 The Asses were two stars set on the back of the constellation Cancer. They were a pair of donkeys who helped Dionysus cross a swamp when he was on his way to Dodona in search of a curse for the madness inflicted upon him by Hera. Upon recovering, the god awarded the pair with a place in the heavens as stars. (Hyginus 2.23.)\n\nASSES OF DIONYSUS 2 The two asses of Cancer were also said to have been placed there as a reward for their service in the Giant War. For when Dionysus and Silenus rode into battle upon their backs, the strange sound of their braying put the Giants into a rout. (Hyginus 2.23.)\n\nASS OF SILENUS The donkey mount of the old rustic god Silenus. The beast once entered into a contest with Priapus over the size of their erect members.

The last of these set it to hunt down the Teumessian fox, which was destined never to be caught. To resolve the contrary fates of the two animals, Zeus placed them amongst the stars as the constellations Canis Major and Minor to play out the chase unresolved for eternity. (Hyginus 2.35.)\n\nDOG OF ORION The dog of the giant hunter Orion who stands above it in the heavens. He leads it in the chase of the hare (Lepus) or the fox (Canis Minor). (Hyginus 2.35.)\n\nMAERA The dog of Icarius, a devotee of the god Dionysus. When his master was murdered, and his mistress committed suicide, the dog threw himself down a well. All three were then placed amongst the stars as Procyon (Canis Minor), Bootes and Virgo. (Hyginus 2.4 & 2.35.)\n\nSIRIUS The dog-star which crowns the head of the constellation Canis Major. Its rising in conjunction with the sun at dawn was thought to bring on the scorching heat of mid-summer. The Egyptians called it the star of Isis. (Hyginus 2.35.)\n\nCANIS MINOR\n\nLatin : Canicula (the Little Dog)\n\nGreek : ProkyÃ´n (the Fore Dog)\n\nAkkadian : Shelebu (the Fox)\n\nSumerian : KA.A (the Fox)\n\nTEUMESSIAN FOX A monstrous fox which ravaged the Boeotian countryside. The hero Cephalus set the magical dog Laelaps to hunt it down. But because the pair had conflicting fates - one was destined never to be caught, and the other never to surrender the chase--Zeus transferred the pair to the heavens to play out their contest unresolved for all eternity. (Hyginus 2.35.)\n\nOTHER DOGS The dogs of Icarius and Orion were sometimes identified with Canis Minor instead of the usual Canis Major.

As thanks for his help the god set him amongst the stars as the goat-fish constellation Capricorn. (Hyginus 2.28 on Eratosthenes.)\n\nAEGIPAN 2 When the monster Typhon attacked Olympus, the gods fled in a body to Egypt and hid themselves away in the form of animals. The god Pan transformed himself into a goat-fish and hid dived into a river. Later after Zeus had been disabled by the giant, Aegipan recovered his stolen sinews and so restored him. For this service he was awarded with a place amongst the stars as the constellation Capricorn. (Hyginus 2.28.)\n\nCASSIOPEIA\n\nLatin : Cassiopeia\n\nGreek : Kassiepeia\n\nCASSIOPEIA A queen of Ethiopia, mother of the lovely Andromeda. When she boasted that her daughter was more beautiful than the Nereids, Poseidon sent a sea monster to devour the girl. She was rescued by Perseus, who slew the beast.

(Hyginus 2.10 on Euripides & Sophocles.)\n\nCENTAURUS\n\nLatin : Centaurus (the Centaur)\n\nGreek : Kentauros (the Centaur)\n\nAkkadian : Habasiranu\n\nSumerian : EN.TE.NA.BAR.HUM\n\nCHIRON The wisest of the Centaurs, a son of the Titan Cronus. He once entertained Heracles, but when examining his poisonous arrows dropped one on his foot. Because of the unbearable pain of the wound, he surrendered his immortality and was placed amongst the stars as the constellation Centaurus. Others say he became Saggitarius. (Hyginus 2.38.)\n\nPHOLUS A centaur of Mount Pholoe in Arcadia who entertained Heracles in his cave. But when he opened the wine, the smell drew the other centaurs who attacked. Heracles slew them, but Pholus examining one of the poisonous arrows let it fall on his foot and died. The gods placed him amongst the stars as the constellation Centaurus, along with his drinking cup Crater. Some say Centaurus is depicted pouring a libation at the altar, Ara. (Hyginus 2.38.)\n\nCEPHEUS\n\nLatin : Cepheus\n\nGreek : KÃªpheus\n\nCEPHEUS A King of Aethiopia and father of the lovely Andromeda. He was forced to sacrifice his daughter to a sea monster because the boasts of his wife Cassiopea offended the gods. But the hero Perseus slew the beast and rescued her. As a memorial the whole family--Cepheus, Cassiopea, Andromeda and Perseus--were placed amongst the stars. (Hyginus 2.9.)\n\nCETUS\n\nLatin : Cetus (the Sea Monster or Whale)\n\nGreek : KÃªtos (the Sea Monster or Whale)\n\nETHIOPIAN CETUS A sea monster which was sent by Poseidon to ravage the land of Ethiopia to punish Queen Cassiopea for her prideful boasts comparing her daughter Andromeda to the Nereids. The girl was offered up as sacrifice to the monster, but was rescued by the hero Perseus. To commemorate the event, the monster was placed amongst the stars as the constellation Cetus, along with Perseus and Andromeda. (Hyginus 2.31.)\n\nCORONA\n\nLatin : Corona (the Crown)\n\nGreek : Stephanos (the Crown)\n\nAkkadian : A-nim (the Crown of Anu)\n\nSumerian : AGA (the Crown of Anu)\n\nCROWN OF ARIADNE The crown of the Cretan princess Ariadne.

He received it as a gift from Aphrodite and after his return from the underworld with his mother Semele he set it amongst the stars in memorial of the event. (Hyginus 2.5 on the Argolica.)\n\nCROWN OF THESEUS The crown of the Athenian hero Theseus which he received from the goddess Amphitrite as a mark of his divine paternity. He in turn gave it to Ariadne as reward for the assistance she provided him in navigating the passages of the Labyrinth. At her death it was placed amongst the stars.
