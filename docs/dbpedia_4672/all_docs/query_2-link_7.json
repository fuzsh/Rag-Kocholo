        "text": "Month: March 2024\n\nStatistics Saturday: Unsolved Mysteries About The Blocks Of Chocolate Smeared On The Side Of My Mask\n\nThat there are multiple blocks of chocolate wedged into the mask, as if I didn’t know to take it off before eating.\n\nThat I have no memory of eating chocolate anywhere near a mask-wearing experience.\n\nThat the blocks are in several separate locations, like I jabbed a bar of chocolate in several different spots until it worked.\n\nThat the chocolate is solid, not melted at all, as though I dropped some chips in and they stayed stuck by static cling or a desire to continue embarrassing me.\n\nThat they are on the way side of my mask, where it covers my cheek, as though there were several ways I didn’t understand how to eat.\n\nThat I wore this without replacing it at least two days after my dear love warned me there was chocolate on the mask. (Well, that one I can explain: I forgot I was told and, you know, it’s not like I see that side of it.)\n\nReference: Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Lutz D Schmadel.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Potion of Bubbles versus Self-Checkout\n\nPotion of Bubbles\n\nThe Case For: Unstoppable, unceasing stream of bubbles emerging from your mouth, nose, and ears for a full week.\n\nThe Case Against: None.\n\nSelf-Checkout\n\nThe Case For: Allows you to buy the week’s groceries without having to interact with anybody except the three different store employees who have to clear your good name from the AI camera that thinks you pocketed an 18-pack of Charmin Extra Charm.\n\nThe Case Against: How the person in line waiting for a register to open up glares at you, convinced of your incompetence, when the register demands you insert a coupon you’ve already dropped in and blown into the slot and pushed another coupon into the slot to rattle around some and it still won’t register.\n\nMiSTed: Altered Destiny, Part 32\n\nWe have reached the end. Keith A—‘s Sonic the Hedgehog fan fiction Altered Destiny reached its conclusion, with Keith-turned-Chris set up in a nice new home on a new planet with a girlfriend and he’s now a cyborg raccoon and everything. What is there to do but share the concluding host sketch, and my final thoughts about the story, as seen in 1997.\n\nThe whole of the MiSTing of Altered Destiny should be at this link. I’ll share some last thoughts after this ends.\n\n[ INT SOL. CROW, JOEL, and TOM are baking cookies. There’s an amazing mess of batter, flour, eggshells, and such all over the entire set. CROW is reading from a cookbook. ]\n\nCROW: Add two tbsps baking powder.\n\nTOM: Two tbsps?\n\nJOEL: Two tablespoons, right. [ Sprinkles it into the central bowl; starts stirring. ]\n\nCROW: No, two tbsps.\n\nJOEL: Guys…\n\nTOM: I’ve got the baking pans all greased up, Joel.\n\nJOEL: Ah, good.\n\n[ JOEL reaches under and pulls up the baking trays. JOEL starts dabbing spoonfuls of batter onto the trays. ]\n\nJOEL: So, do you two feel like you learned anything from this fanfic?\n\nTOM: Learned anything?\n\nCROW: What’s to learn from *this*?\n\nJOEL: Well, how about that sometimes you have to give up your comfortable old home in order to do something meaningful with your life?\n\nCROW: Like Keith-slash-Chris did?\n\nJOEL: [ Continuing to place cookies ] Yeah.\n\nTOM: But all Keith gave up was certain, horrible death.\n\nCROW: And the only meaningful thing he did with his new life was get a girlfriend.\n\nJOEL: That’s still pretty meaningful. Okay, how about learning, like Sally and the other Mobians did, about not accepting matters at face value, and withholding judgement until one learns the full truth of a situation?\n\nCROW: You mean the way they unquestioningly took Keith into their ranks, and later repeated it when he became Chris, without even a cursory questioning to determine if he presented any sort of security risk, as if they knew he was the protagonist?\n\nJOEL: All right, guys. Maybe what you should really draw from the story isn’t something directly shown in the text, but rather in the questions raised by the storyline.\n\nCROW: Like what?\n\nJOEL: Well…\n\n[ JOEL takes the baking trays and places them underneath the desk, as though putting them in the oven. ]\n\nJOEL: How much trust can you extend to a person, and how does a stranger earn your trust?\n\nCROW: Ooh. Or you could ask what that Death Egg thing had to do with the story.\n\nTOM:Or, you could ask, Sonic the Hedgehog: Why? Why? Why why WHY Sonic the Hedgehog already?\n\nCROW: Hey, if the Internet had gotten big a decade earlier they might have been inflicting \"Pound Puppies\" fanfics on us.\n\nJOEL: [ Shakes his head, reaches under to pull out trays of baked cookies. ] You two are incorrigible.\n\nCROW: So stop incorriging us.\n\nJOEL: [ Eating one of the cookies. ] What do you think, sirs?\n\n[ D13. DR. FORRESTER and TV’s FRANK are sitting; TV’s FRANK still in the cardboard car and covered with red paint; but they are trying to scrub him clean. Little progress has been made. ]\n\nDR.F: You know something, Frank?\n\nFRANK: What’s that, Clayton?\n\nDR.F: They’ve got to be feeling pretty darned smug up there.\n\nFRANK: Because you didn’t manage to crush their souls with another \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" fanfic?\n\nDR.F: Grrr…anyway, yes, that’s the problem.\n\nFRANK: Oh, I’m sure you have a plan.\n\nDR.F: That I do, yes. You see, they can feel proud for having passed through this one…\n\nFRANK: But you’ve got more lined up?\n\nDR.F: More lined up than you can even imagine, Frank. More stories from this same author…\n\nFRANK: Wow.\n\nDR.F: More and more fans writing their very first fanfic every day…\n\nFRANK: Oh, that can be painful.\n\nDR.F: Yes…we’ve gone easy on them so far.\n\nFRANK: I can imagine, yes.\n\nDR.F: So we’re going to let them be lulled into a sense of security now.\n\nFRANK: You can destroy them later, certainly.\n\nDR.F: Precisely, Frank. Would you press the button, please?\n\nFRANK: Glad to.\n\n[ TV’S FRANK stands up; hits DR. FORRESTER with the front of his cardboard car. ]\n\nDR.F: Oouch!\n\nFRANK: [ Oblivious ] Where was that button?\n\n[ TV’S FRANK turns around; hits DR. FORRESTER again. ]\n\nDR.F: Aagh!\n\n[ TV’S FRANK turns around again; hits DR. FORRESTER again. ]\n\nDR.F: Ooorg!\n\nFRANK: There it is.\n\nDR.F: FRANK!\n\nFRANK: Oops…\n\n[ TV’S FRANK pushes the button. ]\n\n\\ | / \\ | / \\|/ ---o--- /|\\ / | \\ / | \\\n\n[ * Pwooom * ]\n\nMystery Science Theater 3000 and its related characters and situations are trademarks of and Copyright 1997 Best Brains, Inc. \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" characters are trademarks of and Copyright Sega, Archie Comics, and DIC.

This MiSTing is intended solely for personal entertainment and is not meant to be an insult to the creators or fans of the Sonic the Hedgehog products, and certainly not to Keith A—, who knew what he was getting into when he mentioned he had some Sonic fanfics too. The \"Eclectic/Cool, I collect stuff too\" joke was originally\n\nwritten by Ginger V. Tuttle for The Rutgers Review, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\n> It was a detailed set of blueprints\n\n>for something called a Death Egg.\n\nSo some last thoughts. My recollection is that I impressed Keith A— with having a concluding sketch that actually thought about the themes of the story, especially since he hadn’t thought there was much of a theme in it. There is some part of me that longs to be an English major, and always has. This sketch — and others like it in a lot of the fanfiction MiSTings I did — show off the part of me that, decades later, would strive to find good things to say about god-awful Jack Kinney Popeye cartoons and the like.\n\nBut there’s reason for it besides liking the stunt of finding this meaning. I don’t like just making fun of the source text. I chose to read it. In fact, went out of my way to make it part of my life. The actual show at least occasionally got stuck with something because they had a deadline and no better candidate films.\n\nAlso, it does bother me that doing MST3K fan fiction is a copyright infringement mess. You see the block of text, more or less copied from other MiSTers, at the end of this, and it’s all useless stuff. The only thing that could possibly excuse using Best Brains’s stuff is if I can do something that’s fair use. That’s normally things like using the original property for educational purposes or critiques or some kind of transformative effort that can’t be done without using the copyrighted material. The more a MiSTing uses the source material to think about something, the closer to fair use it gets.\n\nYes, I’m aware this only really excuses using the original fan fiction, the thing that gets critiqued the most explicitly, and that I didn’t need cover for since the author gave me permission. But could I do the criticism as well without Crow and Tom Servo and Joel Robinson delivering it? Maybe there’s an argument to be made there. I don’t know, and hope I don’t ever have to face it.\n\nThough Keith A— was happy to have me MiST other of his stories I never did. I forget whether he never showed me another or whether I forgot to ask.\n\nJoel making the much-discussed cookies was a thing I did because I love when a host sketch includes some unnecessary but visually appealing bit of business. Think of it as the Jiffy-Pop stuff in Eegah!, which might have been my most explicit model. Putting the tray under the desk and immediately pulling out a tray of baked cookies feels true to the show to me. My recollection is I worked out the riffs so that Crow and Tom Servo owed each other the same number of cookies, but what am I going to do, check my work? Someone else can do that. (They won’t.)\n\nNext week: who knows?\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Spice Racks versus Singing\n\nSpice Racks\n\nThe Case For: Orderly place to keep your lifetime supply of eight bay leaves.\n\nThe Case Against: In addition to being an atrocity, information gathered from spices this way is filled with confabulation, and so is operationally useless.\n\nSinging\n\nThe Case For: It’s like talking but with even more complicated rules!\n\nThe Case Against: Turns out nearly all songs were not authored by Joe Raposo to be sung by Muppets.\n\nWhat’s Going On In Prince Valiant? Who is this Flamberge that’s been captured? January – March 2024\n\n“Flamberge”, held captive by a tribe of cave dwellers in the current Prince Valiant story, is Prince Valiant’s named sword, the one that until this story I thought was just called the Singing Sword. But it’s a real class of cool-looking swords, based on named swords that appeared in various romances and epics and such.\n\nWith this, I hope to bring you up to late March 2024 in Mark Schultz and Thomas Yeates’s Prince Valiant. As ever, if you’re reading these scrolls in the future — say, after June 2024 — there’s probably a more up-to-date plot recap at this link. Meanwhile, let’s enjoy the first of my What’s Going On In … posts to cover entirely material revealed to us this calendar year.\n\nPrince Valiant.\n\n7 January – 24 March 2024.\n\nValiant, his son Arn, and their party were ashore, in a deserted fishing village, with Valiant’s Singing Sword getting all vibrate-y. Valiant follows a stag’s lead to a strange cave, where he finds his perception checks failing and a flock of small, shadowy creatures who grab the Singing Sword. Bronwyn says it’s the snake people. In any case, the shadowy figures leave a message on a rock. It says they have Flamberge and orders Valiant’s team to come to the high point tonight.\n\nBaedwulf believes they’ve got a case of Tuatha here, creatures driven underworld by the Gaels at the dawn of time, and still seeking revenge. The Tuatha, though, say they were living peacefully until the humans violated their world. A mad Saxon attacked them, killing many Tuatha, and stealing their sacred Black Stone. So Valiant can see their side of things. Also Witgar rounded up the population of the fishing village and drowned them all. They claim the thief and war criminal was Witgar, a name Valiant recognizes but I don’t seem to have in my notes. Fortunately Witgar turns up soon enough; he’s the chief at Dyfflin, where they’d been heading before this abandoned village and all.\n\nWitgar is all weird and paranoid about seeing Baedwulf again. The peace in Gwynedd that they’ve negotiated thanks to Valiant and Arn sounds to Witgar like enemies gathering against him. Also, maybe they heard about the drowned village or something. Our Heroes, plus Baedwulf’s fiancee Bronwyn, are treated to quite nice apartments as long as they don’t leave or anything so you know what’s up. But they notice the cat who’d stowed away on their boat is able to sneak through the walls. Turns out there’s passageways hidden behind the tapestries.\n\nValiant and Baedwulf follow the cat, and a tunnel, and find Witgar doing some weird mumbling incantation stuff with the Black Stone. Witgar notices them, and flees with the stone, sending a party of 1d4+2 guards after Our Heroes. Then Witgar goes to the women’s apartment, declaring that Bronwyn is going to marry him instead, on the grounds that Baedwulf and Valiant et al are traitors and going to be executed. Right after the ceremony. And that’s where we are now.\n\nNext Week!\n\nBut enough of tales of old-timey folks and their old-fashioned ways. It’s on to Jim Scancarelli’s Gasoline Alley next week — if it still is Gasoline Alley by then! Confused? I’ll explain soon.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Laundry Chutes versus Agreeing To Help The Neighbor\n\nLaundry Chutes\n\nThe Case For: Rare socially acceptable chute one can still have in the home.\n\nThe Case Against: Clothes getting hung up on a very slightly loose nail or a part where one panel isn’t quite a perfect match to the one below that’s always eight feet away from any opening you can stick a broom handle through effectively and you have to just keep jabbing the laundry logjam around until something finally comes through and you get the dread Pantsvalanche raining down on your head.\n\nAgreeing To Help The Neighbor\n\nThe Case For: Lets you appear to be friendly even to the guy in the rusted-out van who says he lives two blocks over and, by the Benjamin Franklin effect of psychology, makes you like the guy more.\n\nThe Case Against: After he’s explained twice that he’s trying to find his heavy green 507 (something) that his son saw in the yard just yesterday you can’t ask what it was he was looking for again and have to just promise you’ll keep an eye out in case you see it and then be stuck the rest of the day trying to think what would be a bright green 507 (something) a guy might be looking for.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: 90s Web Comics versus Horse People\n\n90s Web Comics\n\nThe Case For: Introduced readers to the new creative potential of discovering a refreshing comic and then doing an archive-dive through years of material watching it evolve from a sketchy thing about mismatched college roommates into something with real dramatic and humorous maturity, in time for the cartoonist to go on hiatus a year, then post an apology about life and then post three comics in three weeks rebooting the series from the start, only way better-drawn and without the charm, before disappearing from the Internet forever.\n\nThe Case Against: Maybe there was something unintendedly wrong about the secondary character who’s part of the secret conspiracy that rules the world.\n\nHorse People\n\nThe Case For: Are living beings who are somehow not intimidated by horses.\n\nThe Case Against: Every horse is a bundle of 284 freakish and complicated life-threatening health issues slouching against each other, so every Horse Person has a story they’re ready to deploy on you of the time this past week that sixteen of the issues started acting up and they had to spend four hundred hours hip-deep in horse innards and organic secretions in colors that don’t even exist, but it’s okay because their horse showed their appreciation by biting their ear hard enough they had to go to the emergency room.\n\nStatistics Saturday: Episodes Of _Too Close For Comfort_ I Distinctly Remember Forty Years After Watching Them All\n\nThe one where Ted Knight’s character dreams about what it would be like if he died without a will and it’s his surviving family all living in the downstairs apartment chanting about how their miseries are all because he left them no will.\n\nTed Knight’s character gets an honorary degree from the University of South Cabana or something like that and he’s over the moon that he’s got a degree from some USC, even if it’s not the famous one.\n\nThat one with Jm J Bullock’s character that got Internet Famous like a decade ago although I can’t swear that I remember it from the original airing or from everyone on the Internet going “wait, this dumb little show did that?” like a decade ago. Also, if you’re thinking of going and looking it up you should be warned that it involves sexual assault and that’s heavy material for a sitcom about a guy who draws a comic strip that’s Flash Gordon But A Cow even though his grown-up daughters live in the apartment downstairs.\n\nPretty sure there was one where they were painting the downstairs apartment and that was just full of shenanigannery.\n\nReference: The Lunar Men: The Friends Who Made The Future, Jenny Uglow.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Sponges versus That One Dream\n\nSponges\n\nThe Case For: Excellent way to transport dampness to new locations.\n\nThe Case Against: Freezing up with the memory that they’re animals and wondering what you should feel about this for upwards of twenty minutes instead of just wiping the F-R-O-G jam off the counter.\n\nThat One Dream\n\nThe Case For: It’s amazing how well you did keeping the refrigerator and the oven balanced on such precarious 18-inch-long flimsy sticks of woods despite all the people running around and threatening to knock it over or do some other mayhem!\n\nThe Case Against: Offers you no insight into how to balance your fridge or oven even three inches off the floor, let alone eighteen inches.\n\nMiSTed: Altered Destiny, Part 31\n\nPreviously in Keith A—‘s Sonic the Hedgehog fan fiction Altered Destiny? Author-turned-protagonist-turned-raccoon-named-Chris has got a computer in his arm, a guitar on his arm, and a girlfriend named Rebecca who got beaten up pretty badly during a raid on Robotropolis. With nothing to do but wait for her to recover, he’s playing the guitar.\n\nThis is the final segment of fan fiction! Next week is a host sketch to wrap things up. The entirety of my Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan fiction should appear at this link. And there’ll be a couple notes at the end of this piece, too..\n\n>\n\n> Bookshire’d nearly cried when he heard that.\n\n>Reflecting later, he figured that the song was more for him,\n\nCROW: Since he believed he was the center of the universe anyway.\n\n>considering its content.

Medical stuff.\n\n> He thought it would\n\n>be good if Chris got off the chair every now and then.

Every now and then other villagers would come in and\n\n>visit, talking to Chris,\n\nTOM: Howl at the moon a little…\n\n> offering words of assurance, and in\n\n>general making sure he was all right.

I’m just so relieved… I thought you were gone\n\n>for good.\n\nCROW: Uh…I already moved all my stuff into your room…\n\n> I love you, Rebecca.\" Though it was a great\n\n>effort, she raised her arm and laid it on her head. \"I love\n\n>you too, Chris.\n\nTOM: Hey, something or other was making this awful music-like noise all week; could you find out what it is and stop it?\n\n> Thank you for being there with me.\" He\n\n>sniffled. \"I promised, didn’t I?\n\nJOEL: Yeah, just in time to have to live up to that promise, too.\n\n> I always make good on my\n\n>promises.\" Bookshire came over. \"Right now, Chris, I think\n\n>it’s best if you went home and got some sleep.\n\nCROW: Now that there’s some emotional payoff to the vigil.\n\n> You’ve been\n\n>awake for a week straight. She’s fine now,\n\nTOM: All medical problems vanish when you just wake up again.\n\n> I can take it\n\n>from here. Go on, you need your sleep. You can come back\n\n>after you’ve rested.\"\n\nJOEL: When she’s had the chance to slip back into unconsciousness.\n\n>\n\n> Chris nodded, and stood up. \"I guess you’re right.\"\n\nCROW: Way to keep that promise not to leave her side.\n\n>He looked at himself. \"I think I need a shower, too.\n\nTOM: And the entire village thanks him.\n\n>Well,\" he knelt down and kissed Rebecca’s forehead. \"I’ll\n\n>be back later, dear. Don’t go anywhere, okay?\" She smiled.\n\n>\"I don’t think you’ll have to worry about that, honey.\n\nCROW: \"Last month some nice fellows from the National Park Service put a radio-transmitter collar on me.\"\n\n> Go\n\n>on, you look like you were up for a week.\" Remembering what\n\n>Bookshire had said, she suddenly became serious.\n\nJOEL: Hey! You’ve been awake for 179 hours and 43 minutes!\n\n> \"You were,\n\n>weren’t you? You didn’t leave my side for a week! Dear\n\n>Destiny,\n\nTOM: Won’t you come out to play?\n\n> you really meant it!

Just\n\n>promise me you’ll still be here when I’m up?\"\n\nCROW: [ As Rebecca, sharply ] \"I’m not planning to flee the moment your back is turned!\"\n\n>\n\n> \"I promise. Now, go!\" He turned and headed out, still\n\n>chuckling.\n\nJOEL: It is funny, isn’t it?\n\nTOM: What?\n\nJOEL: You know, the funny stuff.\n\n> Rebecca turned to Bookshire. \"He really does\n\n>love me, doesn’t he?\" Bookshire’s face grew wistful.\n\nCROW: The term is ‘codependence.’\n\n> \"More\n\n>than you may ever know, Rebecca.

Not sure anything else needs explaining … oh, well, “codependency” it turns out isn’t a thing. It doesn’t have a clear definition or scientific research showing it exists and it’s never been recognized as a psychological disorder and when you consider some of the stuff that was, wow. If word of this leaks to Mary Worth the world will never be the same!\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Mnemonics versus Constellations\n\nMnemonics\n\nThe Case For: Puts your brain’s power to remember anything embarrassingly dumb to work for you.\n\nThe Case Against: So you remember stuff like how many counties are in Ohio.\n\nConstellations\n\nThe Case For: Organizes random patterns by giving them names that make sense if you see four times as many stars as you can anymore and remember the myth where Antipodes tricked the gods into making us forget what we came into the room for.\n\nThe Case Against: Carl Sagan did this projection for Cosmos where in like a hundred thousand years the Big Dipper is going to look more like a radio telescope even though now, only 45 years after Cosmos, radio telescopes don’t look like that anymore.\n\nWhat’s Going On In Dick Tracy? Why is Dick Tracy all about Little Orphan Annie again? December 2023 – March 2024\n\nThis year is the centennial of the debut of Little Orphan Annie. While Annie is no longer in production, Mike Curtis has been glad to make his tenure on Dick Tracy a guest home for them. In celebration, then, we’re getting a backstory that seems to tie in to some Annie plot I don’t know anything about, the case of one Boris Sirob, and how it brought Annie to an orphanage.\n\nThis all, then, should catch you up to mid-March 2024 in Mike Curtis, Shelley Pleger, Charles Ettinger, and Shane Fisher’s Dick Tracy. At this link are all my Dick Tracy posts, so if you’re reading this after about June 2024 and want to know what’s going on, try here. There might be something you want to know.\n\nAlso: The past couple months saw the transition from Shelley Pleger as main artist to Charles Ettinger. I don’t think the style has changed that dramatically, but if you were wondering why it’s changed at all, that’s why. Nothing like Rod Whigham taking over the art on Judge Parker while Mike Manley recovers his health.\n\nDick Tracy.\n\n24 December 2023 – 16 March 2024.\n\nWe were at the close of a story, last time I checked in, so this time starts with the boards nice and clear.\n\nSo our story began with comic book celebrity guest stars Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster stopping in to visit Dick Tracy because … they’re related to the Plenty clan and can work with relative Plentia Kopz on something that hasn’t come to light yet.\n\nSo our story actually begins with Rikki Mortis, onetime assistant to Abner Kadaver, getting out of jail on the support and secret messages of Fata Morgana. Morgana’s a travelling stage magician and occasional hit person and, apparently, Kadaver’s understudy. And needs an assistant to carry out some work. First is the murder of Patrick Throughton, who’d been scheduled to testify against drug lord Jon Pertwee. No, I don’t get what the Doctor Who Actor Names thing is teasing either or why they’re picking on Jon Pertwee. Still, it’s a clean hit, calling Throughton up on stage and sawing him in half with a chainsaw, and then later that night he dies of poison.\n\nMorgana gets another job. It’s a hit on Tess Tracy. She hasn’t been in enough stories lately, so the Bosco crime family steps in to want her gone. Mortis can’t have any part of this, not after Dick Tracy let her say goodbye to the dying Abner. Morgana can work with this. She goes to the Tess Tracy Detective Agency, spinning a story of being afraid of a stalker. Bad luck for the hit: Tess is caught in traffic, and her partner Johnny Adonis accidentally gets jabbed with Morgana’s poison pen.\n\nMorgana figures to disappear a while, doing so mid-show, alongside an elephant. And she disguises herself as Bob Baxter, okay enough magician who sometimes fills in when Morgana does one of her vanishing acts. That cover would be decent if George Bosco — alarmed by Dick Tracy asking to see his organization’s books — didn’t go to Baxter on the off chance that he can make people disappear too.\n\nUnlucky for Bosco, Dick Tracy’s there. I think the implication is he followed Bosco, but my initial read was that Tracy was there to ask Baxter some more questions about Morgana’s disappearance. Anyway, in the scrum of arresting Bosco, Baxter escapes into the bootlegger’s tunnels underneath. She sheds her disguise, goes back to recover Baxter’s performing rabbit Harvey, and meets up with Rikki Mortis to get the heck out of the story. And that, the 10th of February, ends our introduction to Fata Morgana and the fall of the Bosco crime syndicate.\n\nThe 10th of February also ends our time with Shelley Pleger as main artist for the strip. After that is a two-week Minit Mystery written by Eric Costello and drawn by Dee Fish, a fresh poisoning puzzle that also has a solution in stage magic. Or at least stage magic-style trickery.\n\nThe current story, and Charles Ettinger’s tenure as main artist, began the 26th of February. This with a phone call from Oliver Warbucks, at the Hotel Siam. We get a mention of J P McKee and Captain Easy. The name “J P McKee” means nothing to me. Captain Easy I recognize as the concept-drift champion comic strip Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy, which I never read either. Anyway the important business is: Warbucks has made contact with Bob Smith, a figure we saw in a teaser back in May 2023. Smith has a picture of Annie’s parents.\n\nFrom here we get into a flashback, explaining how Annie came to be orphaned. Way back in the day gangster-coded palindrome Boris Sirob planned to kidnap Not-Yet-Daddy Warbucks. Tracy was guarding him. Also guarding him: two FBI agents, Harold and Winifred Gray. You may recognize the name “Harold Gray” as the person who, in our history, created the comic strip. Go ahead and guess what Actual Harold Gray’s wife was named.\n\nIn the story, in flashback, the Grays are undercover agents planted in Sirob’s organization. Harold and the extremely pregnant Winifred get the task with doing the actual kidnapping. They’re happy to subvert the kidnapping and let Tracy arrest the getaway driver, but now they can’t go back to Sirob without giving themselves away. And they’re thinking very hard about their imminent daughter, and the orphanage they’ve seen many times over the course of this assignment.\n\nHow does that all come together? I have some guesses, but obviously, no telling yet. I imagine the next month or two will answer it all and then I can get back to you in June to retell it, in fewer words.\n\nNext Week!\n\nOne of my easy weeks! Yes! I recap a mere dozen comic strips as we go back to the time of King Arthur in Mark Schultz and Thomas Yeates’s Prince Valiant, all going well. See you then.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Ideas Written Down in the Middle of the Night versus Etymology\n\nIdeas Written Down in the Middle of the Night\n\nThe Case For: Free ideas you didn’t even have to think to have!\n\nThe Case Against: Idea is “tuna banjo but elevated”.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Case For: Every word has a story, and those words are made of other stories, so there’s plenty of story-hearing to get.\n\nThe Case Against: Those stories are all some nonsense like “bad first appeared in 13th century English as a word meaning ‘the part of an apricot which one eats’ and by metaphor came to mean any of the bounty of creation and by Chaucer’s time meant ‘the beard of God’ and so by a 16th century stage tradition of twin brothers who enter the priesthood or go to sea so took on a meaning of ‘sailing’, from which it came to mean the arrival of tropical birds promising easy sailing’ and so by the 18th century meant ‘the moment a shipwreck becomes inevitable’ and, by 1974 had generalized to its modern sense of any unpleasant situation or event or person”.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Harmlessly Weird Weather versus Candles\n\nHarmlessly Weird Weather\n\nThe Case For: Child-like glee at how it’s white-out conditions but the precipitate is all this light fluffy ball stuff that doesn’t even make the sidewalks slippery.\n\nThe Case Against: Gets weird freak names like ‘graupel’.\n\nCandles\n\nThe Case For: Most convenient way to bring fire to any tabletop cake.\n\nThe Case Against: Candlepower?

They had scenes that went longer, yes, but not so much as to learn about Rebecca. (Who, to be fair again, might have been an already-established character, in other fan fiction if not in the show, so she may have needed less attention.) I don’t know why I referred to it as tragic to have “MacArthur Park” lingering in the mind. Maybe my tastes were different then.\n\nWest Side Story is not so overstuffed with musical numbers as to make that riff make logical sense. But it’s a title that takes the place name well enough. Better might have been West Sonic Story, except Sonic is too small a player this story to support the riff. There’s probably a better musical to slot a Sonic or Mobius or something into.\n\nTom’s line about the greatest gift of all being fifteen hundred dollars is lifted from the episode of Taxi where Latka and Simka want to get married, but have to answer the priest’s questions first, including what the greatest gift of all is. Simka offered the $1500 and was correct and I’m coming to see that as a pretty good answer, really. Like, there’s nobody you know whose life wouldn’t be made much better if you gave them $1500 right now. But it’s a modest enough amount that they could plausibly pay you back, so your relationship stays balanced.\n\nTom’s riff about being easier to “Nupe It” references a painkiller advertisement of the 90s that I suppose has to have been for Nuprin, which I only today realize was a name riffing on “new aspirin”. “CREEP” references Richard Nixon’s 1972 Campaign to Reelect the President, which was in the news back a ways for something or other. Plomeek soup is a Star Trek thing.\n\nI don’t know why it’s only Tom Servo riffs that needed explaining this time. The assignment of riffs is approximately random but sometimes some line sounds better in his voice than another Brain’s.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Hair (the musical) versus Geography\n\nHair (the musical)\n\nThe Case For: Every viewing lets you wonder what’s the part where Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell walked out, after he’d gone and named his Lunar Module after that song from it and everything.\n\nThe Case Against: Wanting the lyric to be “o say, can you see my two eyes” because you think that’ll make the scansion work better and they sing it wrong every time. If it is the scansion. Maybe it’s the portcullis. Or the lepidoptera. Ask a music major.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Case For: If there’s an easier way to get a series of maps of Mid-Atlantic and New England municipal population growth divided by dwindling revenues of canals within a 15-mile radius from 1819 through 1907 nobody has thought of it yet.\n\nThe Case Against: The geography department has posters up promising potential majors that “Geographers Know Where It’s At!”\n\nWhat’s Going On In The Phantom (Weekdays)? Why does every comic look funny these days? December 2023 – March 2024\n\nMore likely than not, whatever strip you’re reading looks funny because of Mike Manley’s health problems. This forced him to take leave of The Phantom weekday edition as well as Judge Parker. The weekday Phantom has been drawn by Jeff Weigel and then Bret Blevins. Judge Parker, D D Degg observed at The Daily Cartoonist, is being filled in now (without credit) by Rod Whigham of Gil Thorp renown.\n\nSo some happy news: Manley posted to his Facebook that he’s scheduled to return to The Phantom with the strip for Monday, the 10th of June. I don’t know whether that coincides with the start of a new story. It may represent just being a comfortable margin. I have no word on when he’ll return to Judge Parker. I am also not clear whether Rod Whigham’s tenure at Judge Parker is just for the week — which, must admit, the Comics Kingdom redesign lets us see early — or is until Manley’s return.\n\nSo this should catch you up to mid-March 2024 in Tony DePaul and Jeff Weigel and Bret Blevins’s The Phantom (Weekdays). You’ll find all my essays about the comic at this link, as well as any news, so if you’re looking for an explanation of what’s going on and it’s after June 2024 for you? Try there.\n\nThe Phantom (weekdays).\n\n18 December 2023 – 9 March 2024.\n\nLast time, we were looking at the denouement of Tony DePaul’s more-than-two-year story about the death of The Phantom. Spoiler: The Phantom does not die. But he does spend time wondering what he can learn from diverting what seems like his destiny. Despite everything, Savarna Devi does learn that her former enslaver, Constable Jampa, is in the Mountain City, and goes after him. She seems to shoot him dead, although there is room for deniability in case DePaul wants to tell of Devi keeping her promise not to seek vengeance. (I believe her sincerity in her promise, but this may be irresistible temptation.)\n\nWith the 13th of January the sixth and final chapter of this story ended, and we began “The Chain”. It begins with something I imagine was a bit of DePaul teasing readers upset at so long an imaginary story: The Phantom talking about what a weird dream he had last night.\n\nThis was not the Wrack and Ruin story. No, the dream he has is of a story that ran from February to May 1953, a Sundays story also called “The Chain”. Tony DePaul wrote about this as his story began. Part of it is meant to re-evaluate a story that he found fundamentally flawed. (The essay’s well worth reading, not least for revealing stuff I didn’t know about Lee Falk’s career, including having a hand in bringing Paul Robeson to the stage in Othello.)\n\nThe important points of the 1950s “The Chain” are that our The Phantom is having a right lousy time of it, unable to stop a war between the Llongo and the Wambesi and feeling sorry for himself over it. In the 2020s “The Chain” our The Phantom — and his family — chuckle over the weirdness of him not even liking being The Phantom. (As ever, I’m more forgiving of the 1950s author in this. While one of The Phantom’s defining traits is that he enjoys being The Phantom and feels his work is worthwhile and appreciated, everyone’s entitled to sometimes doubting themselves.) In the 1950s/the dream, a previously unnoticed Bangallan named Woru tells the story that explains the previously unnoticed chain hung on The Phantom’s throne in Skull Cave.\n\nIt seems that a tinpot dictator of a prince spots the woman who’d become the 20th Phantom’s wife and has his lackeys kidnap her. The 20th Phantom rides to her rescue, of course, but gets caught. And chained to the water well, forced to walk in circles to pump water to the animals, right where his future bride can see but not help. 20th notices, though, that every rotation the chain gets caught a little bit on this one stone, and after months of work, the chain finally snaps. In one bound he’s free, his future wife’s free, the prince who cares about, and he brings the chain back as a reminder of the need for patience.\n\n(In the 1953 story Woru also explains this is a lesson about humility, 20th Phantom having got himself captured by going in guns blazing and hugely vulnerable. This was relevant to the 21st Phantom, 1953 edition, as his troubles with the Llongo and the Wambesi amounted to being annoyed they wouldn’t stop the tribal war already! Don’t they know they’re embarrassing the white guy in the jungle? Although when he goes back, he mostly just demands the tribes talk to each other and doesn’t tell them how to be peaceful. Not The Phantom’s phinest hour but at least he figured how to use his reputation for good?)\n\nAmong the things Kit Junior and all criticize: if this is an important lesson the Phantom needed to learn, why not mention it when he’s growing up? Or in the Phantom Chronicles? Why entrust the story to a lone tribesman who might well die before passing the message on? And isn’t this more a lesson about perseverance, rather than patience? Are we sure this moral was narratively justified?\n\nKit Junior then thanks his father for teaching him and Heloise the things they need to know to be viable Phantoms. He mentions a story from 2006 — “The Jungle Trek” — in which he and Heloise are guided through a series of physical and, more, intellectual challenges. The only one he gets to here is a cliff-climbing exercise, where they lose their focus and come terribly near falling. Diana isn’t sure she wants to hear more, which, fair enough. Writing up this recap I see the thematic connection here, although I don’t have guesses about where that’s going.\n\nKit Junior, convinced that Heloise is just not coming back to the Deep Woods, plans to leave for Mawitaan despite knowing his sister’s trying to set him up with Kadia. But he comes back to talk with his father more. And that’s where we are today.\n\nNext Week!\n\nAnother comic strip having a change of artist! But one that, so far as I know, is not related to health issues. It’s to be Mike Curtis, Shelley Pleger, Charles Ettinger and Shane Fisher’s Dick Tracy next Tuesday, all going to plan.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Cheese Nevada versus HDMI\n\nCheese Nevada\n\nThe Case For: Makes more grilled cheese sandwiches than actual Nevada.\n\nThe Case Against: Somehow, also makes fewer grilled cheese sandwiches than actual Nevada.\n\nHDMI\n\nThe Case For: Plugs into the TV, seems to do whatever TVs need plugging-in for.\n\nThe Case Against: Your really tech-oriented friend has strong opinions that seem negative but the only way to find out is to ask them and when you do that they start telling you.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: House Paint versus Jigsaw Puzzles\n\nHouse Paint\n\nThe Case For: Is a socially acceptable way to make your house larger, but just by a little bit each time.\n\nThe Case Against: The previous layer is so awful it has to be scraped off, setting back progress in growing your house to absorb the neighborhood.\n\nJigsaw Puzzles\n\nThe Case For: Finally a way to stump your jigsaws!\n\nThe Case Against: Will round off the number of puzzles so, like, the 1000-piece puzzle is actually 992 pieces or 1023 and they figure nobody is going to care!\n\nStatistics Saturday: What You Use Your Time Machine for as a Kid Versus as a Mature Person\n\nWhen Young When Mature Preventing Hitler Setting the nice glass away from the edge of the counter so it can’t fall off when you close the door too fast Recording the Sermon on the Mount Spend the weekend of Woodstock trying to find the Art Fair that was supposed to be going on too, maybe buy some lanyards or nice bookmarks or something Saving some cool dinosaurs from the meteor Sleeping in as late as you want and going back to when the alarm clock goes off\n\nReference: Platonic and Archimedean Solids, Daud Sutton.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Debauchery versus Vaseline\n\nDebauchery\n\nThe Case For: You hear stories that make it sound like quite a bit of fun.\n\nThe Case Against: It’s comfortable having a life of bauchery and it would be so nice to stay in tonight and re-watch The Wrath of Khan instead.\n\nVaseline\n\nThe Case For: Can serve as an eye-rhyme to “baseline” in a poem emergency.\n\nThe Case Against: No eye-rhymes ever work.\n\nMiSTed: Altered Destiny, Part 29\n\nRecently in Altered Destiny, author-turned-cyborg-raccoon Chris Petrucci had gone on one of those raids of Robotropolis that Sonic the Hedgehog characters are always doing in fan fiction. But! He and Rebecca are captured by the evil Robotnik’s evil forces of evil! Is there any hope of getting help when all they have on their side is Chris’s ability to telepathically command his arm computer to call for help?\n\nThe whole of my 1997-era Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan fiction of Altered Destiny should be at this link.

Like, Crow’s line about “they’re not that near, and they’re going away”? That’s not reflecting anything in-story. Tom’s riff saying “you never outlined a second course of action for me” is a fine joke except it comes right after Chris’s laying out of the second course of action, and I even had Tom riff on that second-ness, with “Two, we form a lacrosse team”. I have no explanation for my sloppiness here. I’m going to suppose I wrote these riffs in separate writing sessions from the text that went before, so that I was missing context. At this remove I don’t know. But neither my test-readers nor Keith A—, whom I gave a pre-publication read and chance to veto any unfair jokes, raised any complaints. So I guess I got away with it.\n\nWhat I should have riffed on, but didn’t, is how Sasha’s message starting “SALLY, CHRIS AND REBECCA HAVE BEEN CAPTURED” makes Sally sound like one of the captives. That could have made for a good runner and made it sound like I was paying good attention. Ah well.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Mall Directories versus Infinite Scroll\n\nMall Directories\n\nThe Case For: Even Ozymandias can’t top that feeling of the impermanence of existence from knowing that You Are Here but the adequate shoe store promised to be in the Bamberger’s wing is not.\n\nThe Case Against: 75% of all the store categories are Boring Stuff but subdivided even more.\n\nInfinite Scroll\n\nThe Case For: Not truly infinite.\n\nThe Case Against: Not truly a scroll.\n\nWhat’s Going On In Alley Oop? What happened to King Guz? December 2023 – March 2024\n\nThe current story in Jonathan Lemon and Joey Alison Sayers’s Alley Oop sees Alley Oop named King of Moo. Longtime readers of the comic strip may wonder, doesn’t Moo already have a king and wasn’t it Guz? Even longer-time readers may remember, wasn’t Alley Oop fleeing King Guz after trying unsuccessfully to become King when Doc Wonmug first brought him into the future year of 1939?\n\nSo first, yes, Guz used to be king of Moo. But we learned in June 2022 that Guz had retired and Moo had elected President Krash. And, third, uh … I thought that was what Alley Oop was doing when Doc Wonmug plucked him out of the past. But the GoComics archives miss the days right before Wonmug’s introduction so I’m not positive. Sorry.\n\nSo this should catch you up to early March 2024. If you’re reading after about June 2024 please check this link for a more up-to-date plot recap. All going well. All not going well, well, that’s normal enough.\n\nAlley Oop.\n\n11 December 2023 – 2 March 2024.\n\nLast time you’ll recall Lord Odom, a giant dragonfly with the ability to change history, had turned Alley Oop, Ooola, and Doc Wonmug into trees. So they spend several decades turning sunlight and carbon dioxide into food and water, until insects that should have been limited by the cold winters that global warming has stopped overwhelm them and destroy the forests. So, uh … that’s it then, comic strip’s over.\n\nNext Week!\n\nIf I can make my way through the Comics Kingdom Redesign Morass of Suckiness and Poor Decisions I get to see Tony DePaul and Mike Manley’s The Phantom, weekday continuity, look back over old stories without snickering.\n\nOh, uh … wait. Yeah. So, Tree Alley Oop remembers from a previous adventure that plants can communicate with each other. So why can’t Tree Oop, Tree Ooola, and Tree Wonmug command the local vines to envelop Odom. You wouldn’t think it that easy for vines to get a grip on a giant bug. But Odom’s a bit touch-starved and likes the hugging. At least until the hugging threatens to cut off his breathing and then he relents, turning Our Heroes back to human.\n\nOdom reveals how he manages to do reality-changes greater than theory says he should: he doesn’t know. He was just an ordinary dragonfly, going about his business, thinking about George Orr, and then suddenly he woke up giant, superpowered, and ready to take over the world. Wonmug can’t buy this, not until he accidentally ejects Arval, a talking Larva, from Odom’s mouth. Arval’s a parasitic wasp larva, the kind that burrows into a being’s brain and controls them. Arval wasn’t out to do anything, he just crawled into this dragonfly and what the heck but together they were a nigh-omnipotent being and at that point why wouldn’t you try taking over the universe? Wonmug gives Arval a home in a little jar for safekeeping. And as Odom’s neither a menace nor really at fault for anything, Our Heroes let him go. And it’s back home to start a new adventure. (With a stop to reveal Wonmug keeps hitting the timeline-reset button after adventures, which feels like a very 90s Web Comic beat, given how it smashes any story’s suspense into just ‘can they get away’?)\n\nThat adventure began the 9th of January, our time, with Alley Oop and Ooola returning home to Moo. And Alley Oop gets to thinking about how he’s had all kinds of great adventures. He starts telling them to his Moo friends who love the stories even if they don’t know what he’s talking about. One of his friends suggests Alley Oop write a book. It’s a lot of work. There’s the book-writing. Also the paper-making and the ink-making and the binder-making and the book-publisher-making, and bookstore-making, and you see where this is a lot of work that could fail at any step.\n\nNone of them fail. He’s an overnight sensation with the most popular and only book in Moo. Before long he’s doing one-man shows to sold-out audiences. That’s barely started when he’s having other people pretending to be him for one-man shows to sold-out audiences. With huge sacks of money coming in, what else is there to do but let it go to his head?\n\nSo he buys a McMansion Cave. And you know what follows enormous wealth: undeserved power. Krash, President of Moo, has had enough of the corruption surrounding her office and wants to retire, taking Moo’s treasury with her. So she reinstates the monarchy, naming Alley Oop the King, and leaves. So that’s where we are.\n\nNext Week!\n\nBut yeah, it’ll be Tony DePaul and Mike Manley’s The Phantom (Weekdays) up for plot recapping unless I decide I don’t want to deal with that until Comics Kingdom gets their web site functional again. If they can’t manage that it’ll be Mike Curtis, Shelley Pleger, Charles Ettinger, and Shane Fisher’s Dick Tracy.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: Keychains versus Roman Numerals\n\nKeychains\n\nThe Case For: Provide a convenient way to be sure your keys hang on the hook for keys.\n\nThe Case Against: Which you forget to use.\n\nRoman Numerals\n\nThe Case For: Turns numbers into spelling without using algebra.\n\nThe Case Against: Every number between 1245 (MCCXLV) and 1889 (MDCCCLXXXIX) looks goofy and wrong.\n\nMarch Pairwise Brackety Contest Thing: The First Quadrant: Mulberries versus The 1931 Movie Of _Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_\n\nHappy March!

I might even know what they are. As you’d expect, my most popular posts in February were explanations of why Comics Kingdom was broken and passing on the news that your newspaper only runs comic strips by white guys who may have died in a previous century. The five most popular pieces — including two that were only up the last week of February meaning they had almost no time to be searched out and read — were:\n\nComics Kingdom Is Broken Because They Redid the Web Site (120-Hour Warning)\n\nWhat’s Going On In Judge Parker? Who is this ‘Ann Parker’? November 2023- February 2024\n\nWhat’s Going On In Gil Thorp? Are Gil and Mimi Thorp Divorced? November 2023 – February 2024\n\nYour Newspaper Has Dropped Every Comic Strip by a Woman or Black Guy\n\nWhile Pondering a Smaller Injustice of the World\n\nThe most popular Statistics Saturday post was the one about US President Birthdays (Observed) and I hope it turns into something gradually misinforming people, honest as it all is.\n\nSo I knew my streak of exceptionally well-read months couldn’t continue, but it’s still hard to take the crash back to normal. February was, it turns out, below average but only a tiny bit below. WordPress says there were 5,114 page views here in February, which is below the twelve-month running mean of 5,657.0 and running median of 5,374.5. That’s pretty close to average, especially if you prorate it for February being 1.4 days shorter than the twelve-month running average.\n\nThere’s a similar story with the number of likes given, with 86 of them in February compared to the mean of 100.3 and median of 98.5. Prorated to the length of the month that’s less of a drop than it looks. Comments, now, those plummeted again, with only 33 of them against a mean of 66.7 and median of 60.5. Well, that’s all okay.\n\nNow, as ever, my comic strip coverage is my most popular writing. For right now, my plan is to do plot recaps for comic strips in my usual order, which would have it at:\n\nJonathan Lemon and Joey Alison Sayers’s Alley Oop (5th of March)\n\nTony DePaul and Mike Manley’s The Phantom (Weekdays) (12th of March)\n\nMike Curtis, Shelley Pleger, and Shane Fisher’s Dick Tracy (19th of March)\n\nMark Schultz and Thomas Yeates’s Prince Valiant (26th of March)\n\nJim Scancarelli’s Gasoline Alley (2nd of April)\n\nHowever. You notice that The Phantom and Prince Valiant are strips run on Comics Kingdom. I hope very much that in the next ten days they get Comics Kingdom up to the point that it’s possible to read comics on purpose. I really hope that within the next 25 days they manage the feat. But if they haven’t, then I’ll bump the Comics Kingdom strips down to a time when it’s not awful to do.\n\nAn amazing 96 countries viewed pages from me in February. 25 of them were single-view countries. Here’s the roster:\n\nCountry Readers United States 3,807 Canada 184 United Kingdom 152 Australia 99 Philippines 87 India 85 Brazil 79 Germany 51 Italy 48 Sweden 33 Georgia 28 France 27 South Africa 27 Mexico 19 Spain 18 Denmark 17 Netherlands 15 Russia 15 Austria 14 Poland 13 Thailand 13 Argentina 12 Finland 11 Norway 11 Singapore 10 Trinidad & Tobago 10 Uganda 10 Japan 9 Malaysia 9 New Zealand 9 Saudi Arabia 9 Cayman Islands 8 Czechia 8 Indonesia 8 Ireland 8 Romania 8 Turkey 8 Malta 6 Montenegro 6 Switzerland 6 Belgium 5 Greece 5 Peru 5 Hungary 4 Nicaragua 4 Slovenia 4 Tanzania 4 Ukraine 4 Chile 3 Dominican Republic 3 Ecuador 3 Israel 3 Nigeria 3 Puerto Rico 3 Serbia 3 South Korea 3 Taiwan 3 United Arab Emirates 3 Vietnam 3 Belarus 2 Bosnia & Herzegovina 2 Croatia 2 Egypt 2 Estonia 2 European Union 2 Honduras 2 Macao SAR China 2 Pakistan 2 Portugal 2 St. Kitts & Nevis 2 Uruguay 2 American Samoa 1 Antigua & Barbuda 1 Bangladesh 1 Bulgaria 1 (*) Cambodia 1 Colombia 1 El Salvador 1 Faroe Islands 1 Guam 1 Hong Kong SAR China 1 Iceland 1 Kazakhstan 1 Kenya 1 Kuwait 1 Latvia 1 Lebanon 1 Mongolia 1 Nepal 1 North Macedonia 1 (*) Oman 1 Papua New Guinea 1 Paraguay 1 (***) Slovakia 1 Syria 1 Venezuela 1\n\nBulgaria and North Macedonia were single-view countries in January also. Paraguay has spent four months as a single-view country here.\n\nWordPress calculates me as having published 16,200 words last month, a scant 558.6 words per post on average. January had been 639.6. So that’s why I’ve had so much more free time, it follows. I’m at 36,028 words for the year so far, as of the start of March.\n\nI’m also as of the start of March at 416,861 page views from 235,154 unique visitors, this after 4,046 posts that have collected 6,582 comments altogether. These are certainly numbers, and if you’d like to see how the numbers change when we get to next month come on back around.
