        "text": "In order to set the boundaries of a city with regards to where it may be permissible to carry, the Talmud states that one should “square” it, meaning an imaginary square is drawn to include within it the entire city.\n\nThis is a simple enough instruction, but we are not done. The sides of this imaginary square are to be aligned with the four cardinal directions, North, East, South and West. We are not told why this must be done. Instead the Talmud explains how this squaring is done. Here is one suggestion.\n\nעירובין נו, א\n\nתָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: בָּא לְרַבְּעָהּ — מְרַבְּעָהּ בְּרִיבּוּעַ עוֹלָם, נוֹתֵן צְפוֹנָהּ לִצְפוֹן עוֹלָם וּדְרוֹמָהּ לִדְרוֹם עוֹלָם, וְסִימָנָיךְ: עֲגָלָה בַּצָּפוֹן, וְעַקְרָב בַּדָּרוֹם.\n\nWith regard to the measurements of a city’s boundaries, the Sages taught the following baraita: If, in order to measure the Shabbat limit, one comes to square a city, i.e., to extend the city’s boundaries to include all of its protrusions within an imaginary square, he squares it so that the sides of the square align with the four directions of the world. He sets the northern side of the square to align with the north of the world, and its southern side to align with the south of the world. And your sign by which you can recognize the directions of the world is as follows: The constellation of “eglah” is in the north and Scorpio is in the south. The directions of the city are determined by these constellations.\n\nThe Bull vs The Bear\n\nThese two constellations should be easy to identify. Let’s start with the second one mentioned. The word עַקְרָב means a scorpion, and Scorpio is one of the twelve signs of the zodiac. Good. But what about the first constellation eglah or agalah (there is a big difference as we will see). To what constellation might this refer? Agalah - עֲגָלָה means either a “wagon” or, when the same letters are vocalized as eglah, a “calf.” And then things really get interesting.\n\nEglah is Taurus\n\nTheArtScroll English Talmud indeed identifies עֲגָלָה with Taurus, (as does the ArtScroll Hebrew translation). This would depend on vocalizing the word as “eglah” meaning a calf. This would most likely identify it as the bovine constellation we know as Taurus, the “Bull.” This was also the opinion of the great medieval commentator Rashi. He doesn’t explain the word’s meaning on this page of Talmud, but he does elsewhere. In the tractate Berachot (58b) he explains the meaning of the phrase רישא דעגלא - “the head of the eglah” as the constellation Bull, or Taurus:\n\nרשי ברכות נח,ב\n\nרישא דעגלא – ראשו של עגל והיינו מזל שור\n\nBut we are not done. When these two constellations are mentioned in Pesachim (94b), the medieval commentary known as Tosafot remarks that eglah cannot be Taurus, (and Scorpio cannot be Scorpio). It is all to do with a description of the universe that we cannot get into now, but will do so on February 23rd next year, when we study that page in the Daf Yom cycle. Here is that Tosafot:\n\nתוס׳ פסחים צד, ב\n\nמעולם לא מצינו עגלה בדרום ועקרב בצפון - צ\"ל דעגלה לאו היינו מזל שור כדפי' בקו' ועקרב נמי אינו עקרב די\"ב מזלות דבפ\"ק דראש השנה (דף יא:) קאמר די\"ב מזלות לעולם ששה למטה מן הארץ וששה למעלה וכשהא' עולה שכנגדו שוקע והכא אמר שאינן זזים ממקומן ושניהם לעולם למעלה אלא אחרים הם\n\nSo to sum, Rashi believed that eglah is Taurus - and that is the ArtScroll understanding. Tosafot claimed it cannot be Taurus, though he does not offer an alternative. Now let’s consider some more contemporary translations and explanations.\n\nEglah is Ursa Major\n\nThe Koren (Steinsaltz) English Talmud identifies eglah as another constellation entirely, and one that is not part of the twelve signs of the zodiac. It is called Ursa Major, “The Great Bear.” Ursa Major was called Ἄρκτος μεγάλη Arktos Megale - The Great Bear - by the second century astronomer Ptolemy, and was long associated with things north. (That’s where we derive the word arctic.) So this description could certainly have been known to the rabbis of the Talmud."
