        "text": "The best star projectors are a great way to observe the wonder of the night sky from the comfort of your own home. That said, not all star projectors are made the same; some are designed to be as scientifically accurate as possible, while others simply allow you to enjoy the ambience of the stars.\n\nThe price of star projectors varies widely depending on their functionality. There are a number of accurate planetariums featured in this guide, and they carry much higher price tags than ambient lights. There are also some star projectors designed to be educational tools for children: You'll find examples of all three on our list.\n\nMany star projectors are based on the nebulas you might see if you look to the skies with one of the best telescopes, so you can use them to learn about the night sky. Others also have built-in speakers which make them a great choice if you're looking to unwind and take a minute to appreciate some stunning sights. Star projectors can be a fantastic sleeping aid while also serving as a useful education tool for kids. Don't assume they're only for little ones, though, as adults can also get plenty of joy out of them.\n\nWe've put together this comprehensive guide which includes everything from budget-friendly options to high-end party-starters. You'll find a summary of each product, alongside a link to the full review and some quick pros and cons so you can find the perfect device for you.\n\nThe quick list\n\nBest star projectors we recommend in 2024\n\nBest overall\n\nYou might be surprised to know that Sega is not only known for Sonic the Hedgehog; it's also the manufacturer of the best star projector you can currently buy, the Sega Homestar Flux. With the ability to observe over 60,000 stars at once, it truly does bring the night sky inside your home.\n\nWe've tested the Homestar Flux extensively, and we can confidently say that there are no better star projectors or home planetariums on the market. It offers scientifically accurate views of the sky with beautiful, bright projections that will wow you.\n\nThe Homestar Flux operates with a disc system which allows you to change which parts of the night sky you're viewing. Two Northern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere Constellations (which includes labeled constellations) discs come included with the Homestar Flux, but many more are available to purchase separately. There are 30 discs available for around $18 each when you visit Astrial, Sega Toys' official online store.\n\nIf you're struggling to choose, we were particularly impressed by the simulations of the aurora borealis and the aurora australis. There is a disc that displays the planets of the solar system, but the ones that show galaxies, nebulas and other NASA-based imagery are the ones that really stand out. The North America nebula as taken by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and the seven-star system called Jabbah (officially called Nu Scorpii and IC 4592) as imaged by NASA's WISE mission are fascinating. For a different kind of skywatching, you can buy discs that simulate fireworks, 'night jellyfish' and a hot-air balloon festival.\n\nLike many other star projectors, there is a 'shooting star' function, although in our Sega Homestar Flux review, we found it a bit predictable because the star always fell in the same spot. More variation would have made the display feel more real. However, we loved that it comes with an automatic shut-off option after 15, 30 or 60 minutes, which is handy if you're using it to fall asleep.\n\nThe main downside of this fantastic star projector is it's far more expensive than many other models, but you'll find few that offer the same user experience. It's worth noting that the Sega Toys Homestar Flux is also tough to find, so grab it while it's in stock at one of our trusted retail partners.\n\nRead our full Sega Toys Homestar Flux star projector review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for space-themed parties\n\nWhile it's not a scientifically accurate star projector, the Aurora Borealis Northern Lights Star Projector is packed full of great features.\n\nThis star projector is very customizable: you can choose to display a full moon, change the colors of the Aurora Borealis, make the stars more or less visible, or adjust the LED lights and green lasers to your preferred brightness. There are 16.7 million to choose from (in theory at least; we weren't able to test this as the human eye can't see that many), so you're bound to find one to your taste. We also love that you can control the projector with the remote control it comes with, or through the accompanying app on your smartphone.\n\nThe Aurora Borealis Northern Lights Star Projector comes with a high-quality built-in Bluetooth speaker which syncs the lighting display to music thanks to its \"rhythm mode\". This is a great feature if you want to create some party ambience.\n\nIn our Aurora Borealis Northern Lights Star Projector review, we highlighted it as one of our favorites of all the star projectors we've reviewed. It's just a shame that it comes in unbranded packaging, and we found the so-called official website to feel ingenuine. It didn't give us much trust in what we were buying, but thankfully the final product delivered.\n\nRead our full Encalife Aurora Borealis Northern Lights Star Projector review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for voice control\n\nWe love this projector's modern design; unlike most of its competitors, it can blend in among your furniture and looks great in most rooms. It also comes in an attractive packaging, so it would make a lovely gift.\n\nIn our Encalife Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector review, we noted how simple it is to use and set up. But this projector's standout feature is no doubt the voice control: You can use the companion app on your smartphone (available for iOS and Android), or your Amazon Alexa/Google Assistant to voice control your projector. This means you can adjust the brightness, control the rotation speed or change the colors without having to get up from your sofa.\n\nThe Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector boasts 16.7 million colors to choose from; while this sounds impressive, since the human eye can't actually see that many colors with the naked eye, it's a bit of a wasted claim. However, we're pleased to say the colours you can see are beautiful, and the projector offers up a fantastic light show experience.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Atmosphere projector doesn't offer scientifically accurate representations of the stars, so if you're after an educational tool, this won't be the one for you. But if you're simply looking for beautiful ambient light shows, you won't be disappointed with what's on offer here. We love that you can fully tailor the experience to your tastes by adjusting the brightness and projection speed.\n\nThe Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector is USB rechargeable. It can also be adjusted to four angles, so it's flexible enough to project onto both the walls or ceilings.\n\nRead our full Encalife Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Star Projector review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest budget star projector\n\nWhile it's tempting to dismiss low-cost objects that go viral on TikTok, the Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector proved us wrong. In our Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector review, we were pleasantly surprised by how well made it was, and it ticked all the boxes a fun, novelty star projector should.\n\nAs you can probably assume from its price point, the Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector is not a scientifically accurate projector. What it is, however, is a fun light show in a novelty package. While it might not provide an introduction to real-world nebulas and star systems, it does produce a fantastic display of light and colour, one that we think makes a great gift for any age.\n\nDon't be put off by its underwhelming packaging. In operation, the Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector is really impressive. As we mentioned in our review, the lighting module seems to be the same — if just a tiny bit less impressive — as other star projectors we have reviewed, including the BlissLights Sky Lite 2.0 and the Encalife Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Star Projector. It isn't based on science, unfortunately, but as long as you're happy to simply enjoy a pretty visual representation of the night sky, you'll get a lot of joy out of this. It helps that it's very quiet in use, too.\n\nSince this is a non-branded product, you'll find many replicas of the Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector available online. It can be hard to ensure you're buying the proper thing, but you should definitely be cautious of sellers advertising the projector for as little as $10, as you might end up disappointed with a low-quality product.\n\nIf we're being picky, we didn't love the fact that it's powered by a USB-A to DC cable instead of a USB-C, which would have been a lot more convenient nowadays. Other than that, it's a fantastic gift for any space enthusiast.\n\nRead our Astronaut Starry Sky Star Projector review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest affordable known brand star projector\n\nIf you want a star projector that can sing and dance, the Sega Toys Homestar Matataki is the one for you. This is the newest projector from Sega Toys, expanding on its excellent Homestar Flux (which you'll find at the top of this list). Rather than replace the Flux, however, the Matataki sits alongside it, adding a range of new features.\n\nPerhaps the most striking new feature is the addition of a 'twinkle plate' which gives the illusion of twinkling stars and adds a lot of depth to the visual experience. The star projector also comes with sounds included, which is a nice added bonus but by no means a necessity considering the amount of free sleep sounds you can source from streaming platforms.\n\nDuring our Homestar Matataki review, we appreciated how silently it runs and the brightness of the displays. That said, we found the Homestar Flux offers higher-contrast images and sharper stars, which is why it remains at the top of our list. In terms of price and availability, however, the Matataki clearly takes the win against its predecessor. We did appreciate that the discs for the Flux and the Homestar Original are compatible with the Matataki, potentially reducing your investment if you own one of these models.\n\nWhile we love all the extra functionality and the beautiful imagery the Matataki comes with, we just wish Sega Toys had made the projector powered by USB-C or A rather than mains-powered. While this might seem like a trivial issue, it does greatly limit where you can position the projector, and considering this one has a relatively small projection circle, it could be a dealbreaker.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for pastel shades\n\nThe BlissLights Sky Lite Evolve has a near 360-degree angling thanks to its spherical design. Few other star projectors offer so much coverage, and the 1.5m cable its comes with means you should be able to position it in the most optimal location in any room.\n\nThis star projector's smart features are what really stood out in our BlissLights Sky Lite Evolve review. You can use this so-called 'galaxy light' in conjunction with several smart home systems, from Google Assistant to Amazon Alexa, which enables you to change its colours or turn it on or off at the sound of your voice.\n\nPerhaps one of the best things about the BlissLights Sky Lite Evolve is how silently it operates, making the experience a truly relaxing one and allowing you to focus on the stars. It also makes use of a patented color-blending technology, which means instead of using solid color blocks, its four LED lamps are capable of providing a broader range of colour options. This results in softer blended colors and a beautiful, almost pastel-like palette, contributing to the calming atmosphere.\n\nYou can choose between three models — blue, green or no lasers — and we think it's a great pick for lighting up parties, adding ambience to your movie night or gaming tool, or as a a relaxing ambient light to help you fall asleep.\n\nRead our full BlissLights Sky Lite Evolve review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest value rechargeable star projector\n\nThe Pococo Galaxy Star Projector definitely provides incredible value. For the price, it's solidly-built and in our Pococo Galaxy Star Projector review, we were really impressed with the realistic images it displays.\n\nLike the Sega Toys Homestar models, the Pococo Galaxy Star Projector uses discs that display different views of the night sky. They're all scientifically accurate and, aside from the two supplied with the device, more can be picked up separately for around $50 for six.\n\nThis projector is very easy to control thanks to the three buttons on its body: Power, rotation and sleep timer. It's set apart from other star projectors on the market by its rechargeable battery. It can be charged with a USB-C cable and, since you don't have to have it plugged in when in use, it's great for using in different locations. It's also made of recycled materials, another thing that should please environmentally-conscious buyers.\n\nThis projector will appeal to both kids and adults. It's available in a stylish color gradient or a matte white finish. Adjusting the clarity of the projection only requires using the focus wheel, which is handy if you want to move it between different surfaces or rooms.\n\nThe downside of the Pococo's design is you only have 30 degrees of movement to shine the lights, which is considerably less than some of its competitors, but not a deal breaker if you only intent to shine it at the ceiling.\n\nRead our full Pococo Galaxy star projector review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for homeschooling young children\n\nIf you're looking for a star projector for children to teach them about the night sky, the Brainstorm Toys Deep Space Home Planetarium is the best choice.\n\nThe Deep Space Home Planetarium is ideal for children aged six and over. It's an educational projector meant to initiate kids about space, but it's worth noting that it is not scientifically accurate. It does however come with changeable discs showing official NASA images of nebulas, spacecrafts, astronauts, planets and the moon taken by the Hubble Telescope.\n\nInstead of using digital controls, you operate it manually. As it's so interactive and hands-on, children are likely to stay engaged with it for longer. In our Brainstorm Toys Deep Space Home Planetarium and Star Projector review, we found a 'secret code' you can use to access additional informative descriptions of the pictures on the slides online. This allows children to learn more about space objects and adds a fun and mysterious element to the experience.\n\nConsidering its reasonable price tag and the many educational benefits it offers, we think this projector is a worthwhile investment to teach your kids about space.\n\nRead our Brainstorm Toys Deep Space Home Planetarium and Star Projector review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest multi-functional scientific star projector\n\nIn our National Geographic Astro Planetarium review, we found this high-quality indoor planetarium offers true-to-life projections of the starry night sky at great price.\n\nThis projector is less expensive than the more premium options by Sega Toys, but it still comes with two projection discs: one showing 8,000 stars and another featuring guidelines for major constellations. You also get an accurate view of what you'll see for the time of day you're using it, which adds to the authenticity and its educational qualities.\n\nThe National Geographic Astro Planetarium is pleasantly easy to use: Simply rotate the image and use the big focus wheel to get the clearest projection. We've found the optics in this star projector to be rather impressive: They come from Bresser, a German brand known for making high-quality binoculars, telescopes and microscopes.\n\nThis projector is battery-powered, so you don't need it connected to the mains in order to use it. It makes it easier to place it in an optimal place around the room. There's also a 3.5mm jack cable provided in the box which allows you to connect an audio device to it, allowing you to play music or the radio while enjoying the stars.\n\nThe National Geographic Astro Planetarium has a novel 'falling star' mode. It projects a flashing meteor every 40 seconds, although we think it's a shame the falling star is always in the same place. A level of randomization would make it a bit more enjoyable and unpredictable.\n\nRead our full National Geographic Astro Planetarium review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for generalist projection\n\nThe Bresser Junior Astro-Planetarium Deluxe is very similar to the National Geographic Astro Planetarium. The two share a design, in fact, and so operate almost identically. There are key differences, however: for starters, this one doesn't have a speaker or built-in radio.\n\nThe different color scheme does at least make the Bresser Junior Astro-Planetarium look more grown-up and of a better quality. It's swapped out the bright yellows of the National Geographic planetarium for a more premium-looking silver, which is much less conspicuous-looking, particularly if you're using this as an adult.\n\nIn our Bresser Junior Astro-Planetarium Deluxe review, we found that the same Astro Planetarium discs can be used in both the Bresser and the National Geographic devices, and two are included in the box: one features a starry night sky, and the other has constellation overlays. You can set a day and time on the device, making the projections accurate for that time — a very nifty feature to help with skywatching.\n\nYou can rotate the image in its stand, and it's fully mobile with built-in motors allowing for 360-degree movement. We found that it works best when the images are projected from about two meters away. Bresser designed the lens with a focusing wheel for easy image adjustment. Like many star projectors, it has automatic shutdown options after 30, 60 or 120 minutes, making it suitable for kids who want to fall asleep under a starry sky in their bedroom. Additionally, it includes a shooting star mode, projecting a 'meteor' every 40 seconds.\n\nThere are minimal differences between this and the National Geographic Astro Planetarium, but this one is a little cheaper. If you don't want music compatibility and you're happy for it to be battery-powered, it's probably worth considering over the other.\n\nRead our full Bresser Junior Astro Planetarium Deluxe star projector review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for portability\n\nThe BlissLights Starport USB star projector is unlike any other in our guide, given that it relies on a USB connection and is far more of a compact package. This is a hassle-free device and also one of the most budget-friendly, but it can still transform the atmosphere around you with stunning projections. We'd use the term 'star projector' sparingly, however, as it isn't entirely scientifically accurate.\n\nTo operate the BlissLights Starport, simply plug it into to a USB power source, and sit back and enjoy the show. It fills the room with hundreds of laser stars which look absolutely beautiful. Unlike other devices on this list, however, there are no customization options and, unsurprisingly, it's not scientifically accurate.\n\nIf you're looking for a simple night sky light show to add ambience to any room, we think the BlissLIghts Starport USB star projector is a great choice. It's inexpensive and takes up almost no space. If you travel a lot, it could be a perfect way to see the stars in your hotel room, for example.\n\nIf you want more advanced features or something more scientifically accurate, however, this isn't the right product for you.\n\nRead our full BlissLights Starport USB star projector review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for multi-media ambiance\n\nCompared to the Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector, the Ambience Galaxy & Star Projector has fewer lighting modes, but we don't see it as a drawback. It provides four colors (blue, green, white and red) which you can blend using the remote control included. You can also adjust the brightness according to your preference.\n\nConsidering the mediocre packaging, we were pleasantly surprised by how sturdy this star projector's construction was. The unit is well-built, and we found the lights bright enough to create a very pleasant atmosphere bound to enhance any party.\n\nIts sleek black color blends in with many home decors, and it can also function as a music player, allowing you to listen to your favorite music or atmospheric sounds as you watch the celestial shadows dance across the ceiling and walls. In our Encalife Ambience Galaxy and Star Projector review, we found the speaker to be surprisingly high quality and audibly well-rounded.\n\nThe faceted dome shape means the lights can be projected and dispersed over 180-degrees, so the entire ceiling is covered with lights. You'll need to set up your phone's Bluetooth before you start using the projector, which is easy enough to do, and then you'll be up and running in no time.\n\nLike the Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector, you won't get scientific accuracy, but you'll get a beautiful light show that can help you or your children to sleep better at night.\n\nRead our full Encalife Ambience Galaxy and Star Projector review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nStar projectors Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the best star projector?\n\nThe Sega Toys Homestar Flux is the best star projector you can buy right now. We’ve tested and reviewed a range of star projectors and found no projections more accurate and beautiful than with this premium product. You also have the possibility of buying up to 30 extra disks to project the Milky Way, shooting stars, and the aurora.\n\nAre star projectors realistic?\n\nNot all star projectors are scientifically accurate — some are designed to be pleasant ambient lights to be used as kids' night lights or just to create a relaxing atmosphere. However, some models are scientifically accurate and allow you to create a planetarium from the comfort of your own home, for example the Sega Toys Homestar Flux, National Geographic Astro Planetarium and Bresser Junior Astro-Planetarium Deluxe.\n\nWhat is the difference between a star projector and a planetarium?\n\nWhile the terms are often used interchangeably, star projectors can also be used to refer to unrealistic night and ambient or mood-enhancing lights that aren't scientifically accurate. Planetariums, on the other hand, are strictly realistic and accurate depictions of the night sky, which are sometimes even time and location-sensitive to show you the night sky as it appears at a given time.\n\nHow do I choose a star projector?\n\nIn this buying guide, we've tested and reviewed a range of star projectors and ranked them according to performance, quality and budget. We've included a variety of options at different price points with a range of features, so you're sure to find one that suits you. We continue to monitor the market for different models, and we'll share our favorites with you.\n\nCan I leave a star projector on all night?\n\nIn theory, yes. Most of the star projectors in this guide are AC mains-powered or DC-powered through USB ports, so as long as they're plugged in, they can run. Some, however, are battery-powered, meaning you run the risk of the battery running out overnight.\n\nFor those who want to use them as night lights, many star projectors come with a 'sleep timer' that will switch the device off after a specified amount of minutes.\n\nIt's important to check the manual that comes with your star projector before you leave it running for extended periods of time, as some models may become hot after prolonged use. Always resort to the manual if in doubt and follow the instructions.\n\nAre star projectors good for babies?\n\nThe star projectors designed to be night lights can be good for babies and small children as they create a soothing ambient light. They can even make bedtime routines more fun and help your child drift off to sleep.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some models include small flashes of light and swirling light patterns, so they may not be suitable for babies with light sensitivities or conditions like epilepsy. If in doubt, consult your doctor or local physician before using them.\n\nWhat are the best star projectors on Amazon?\n\nMost of the star projectors in this guide are available to buy from Amazon. You can find links underneath each product review that will take you to recommended merchants' websites, including Amazon.\n\nHow much do star projectors and home planetariums cost?\n\nPrices vary depending on the model of your choice and how many features you are after. Generally, you can buy a good quality star projector for anywhere between $25 and $250. The cheaper models tend to be destined to be used as night lights and are generally inaccurate in their depiction of the night sky. More premium models like the Sega Toys Homestar Flux are more expensive but offer scientifically accurate depictions of the night sky.\n\nAre laser star projectors safe?\n\nThe answer to this question depends on the type of star projector you're considering. Some FDA-approved laser star projectors are safe for brief and accidental exposure to eyes, but they are not recommended for children, and you should never look directly into a laser beam.\n\nThe U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that 'The FDA recognizes four major hazard classes (I to IV) of lasers, including three subclasses (IIa, IIIa, and IIIb). The higher the class, the more powerful the laser is and the greater the potential to pose serious injury if used improperly.'\n\nIn reference to Class IIIa lasers (like laser pointers or some used in star projectors), the FDA says: 'Depending on power and beam area, can be momentarily hazardous when directly viewed or when staring directly at the beam with an unaided eye. Risk of injury increases when viewed with optical aids.'\n\nIf in doubt, check the laser classification on the device before purchasing and check it against the FDA rules, or a relevant health and safety body in your region.\n\nHow we test the best star projectors\n\nTo guarantee you're getting honest, up-to-date recommendations on the best star projectors to buy here at Space.com we make sure to put every star projector through a rigorous review to fully test each product. Each star projector is reviewed based on a multitude of aspects, from its construction and design, to how well it functions as a star projector and whether it provides accurate night sky imagery.\n\nEach star projector is tested by either our expert staff or knowledgeable freelance contributors who know their subject areas in depth. This ensures fair reviewing is backed by personal, hands-on experience with each star projector and is judged based on its price point, class and destined use. For example, comparing a top-of-the-range star projector from one of the largest producers of star projectors to a make-your-own kit made from cardboard wouldn't be appropriate, though each star projector might be the best-performing product in its own class, and that is how we've categorized them in this guide.\n\nWe look at how easy each star projector is to operate, test out all their functions to see if they are effective and work as advertised. We check that the projections are good, that the build quality is fit for purpose and make suggestions for the most appropriate use of each unit.\n\nWith complete editorial independence, Space.com is here to ensure you get the best buying advice on star projectors, advising on whether you should purchase a product, making our buying guides and reviews reliable and transparent."
