In this 3-day, 15-hour workshop, we will learn about constellation facilitation and use constellations to explore the way that our work with our deepest wounds opens us to contribute most fully with others, and the ways in which our shame is a doorway that helps us to discover this pattern in our lives and in our bodies.  Constellations are a way of unwinding and unraveling the frozen strands of trauma and buried nervous-system vows from our essential beings, so that we can flourish, live, and contribute our gifts with ease. Join Sarah Peyton for this exploration of what neuroscience and constellations can do for us.  This is part 1 of a 3-part constellation masterclass series on woundedness and shame. You are welcome to register for any of the three individual events in the 3-part series; however, registering for the full 3-part immersion might be a good fit if you’d like to learn to use constellations in your work or your life, as well as receive access to the bonuses and savings.",

        "text": "$900.00\n\nWhat does shame give us? How does it open doors to understanding our deepest gifts? In this 3-day, 15-hour workshop, we will learn about constellation facilitation and use constellations to explore the way that our work with our deepest wounds opens us to contribute most fully with others, and the ways in which our shame is a doorway that helps us to discover this pattern in our lives and in our bodies.\n\nConstellations are a way of unwinding and unraveling the frozen strands of trauma and buried nervous-system vows from our essential beings, so that we can flourish, live, and contribute our gifts with ease. Join Sarah Peyton for this exploration of what neuroscience and constellations can do for us.\n\nThis is part 1 of a 3-part constellation masterclass series on woundedness and shame.

Recordings will be made available.\n\nWhen?\n\nThe schedule will be as follows (All times are in the Pacific Time zone. To convert to your time, please click here)\n\nFeb 24: Saturday, 9am-12pm, 1pm-3pm\n\nFeb 25: Sunday, 9am-12pm, 1pm-3pm\n\nFeb 26: Monday, 9am-12pm, 1pm-3pm\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nEach day we alternate between short lectures on neuroscience and constellation concepts with mini-constellations to explore and practice the concepts, and then we do large group constellations. If you’re a visual learner you can imagine small islands of didactic learning, surrounded by slightly larger islands of small-group learning, and then interspersed with large, full-group constellations. Small group work will be done in small groups or dyads via breakout groups on zoom.\n\nConstellations facilitated by Sarah will alternate with Constellations facilitated by Masterclass participants, interspersed with large and small group learning. Both being a facilitator and being a seeker happen by lottery. Only participants who have attended other master series sessions with Sarah will be eligible to be facilitators. Not all participants will have a chance to be a seeker or a facilitator.\n\nOver this 3-day workshop series participants will:\n\nDiscover the purposes that shame serves\n\nRelease contracts that prevent us from perceiving the gifts of our shame\n\nWork with 3-5 mini-constellations that support the exploration of the relationship between woundedness and shame\n\nLook for relic-patterns from infancy that depress our life energy\n\nWork with the foundational skills of constellation facilitation\n\nImprove constellation facilitation confidence, humility and practices for general practice\n\nHave the opportunity to participate in a large-group constellation facilitated by Sarah\n\nHave the opportunity to participate in a large-group constellation facilitated by a student and supported by Sarah\n\nHave multiple opportunities to be in lotteries to be a client or to student-facilitate large group constellations.\n\nWho is this Class for:\n\nThese sessions are intended for people who are interested in learning about constellation facilitation and how constellation work transforms and heals. Both experienced and new facilitators are welcome. Student facilitators will have opportunities for supervision and support from Sarah Peyton. Sometimes, personal growth and transformation happen coincidentally, but personal work for participants isn’t the main focus of the offerings in the masterclass series.\n\nHow much?\n\n$900 Regular price\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n\nIn order to secure the early-bird rates, you must register and pay by the dates above.\n\nYour tuition payment is non-refundable and transferable.\n\nThis work is not therapy and is not a substitute for therapy. If you have a sense that you would be destabilized by yourself or others speaking about difficult events, then this course may not be for you. While we hope that the processes and information that we share can be of use in your journey, we do not have the resources to support extreme psychological difficulties."
