        "text": "Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde\n\nMost Tribes in the Grand Ronde Community have an ikanum, or ancient story, about the Sun and Moon.\n\nThe Clackamas Chinook tells a story about a person who travels to the Sky World and marries the daughter of the Sun. When she comes to Earth, her two children become stars that can only be seen during certain times. An ikanum from the Tualatin Kalapuya tells of a boy who goes to the Moon and Sun seeking water, which he brings back to Earth.\n\nMany Tribes see a human face in the Moon and tell stories of how the face appeared. The Tualatin Kalapuya ikanum talks of a misbehaving boy who was left outside when the Moon scooped him up. The child can be seen holding his bow at all times and is known as the boy who stands on the Moon.\n\nThe Clackamas and Shasta refer to multiple suns and moons. For the Shasta, each month brings a new and different moon.\n\nAustralian Aboriginal\n\nAboriginals in Australia have a variety of names for the Seven Sisters. The group of stars is the Napaljarri sisters, and they are chased across land and sky by Jukurra-Jukurra or the Morning Star. As they travel through the sky to escape their lustful pursuer, they switch languages and become the Kungkarangkalpa. The sisters use their powers to move from the sky to humanoid form, known as Minyipuru. They also shape-shift into rocks, trees, and flowers and are ultimately successful in outwitting their antagonist.\n\nGreek\n\nThe Greek mythology surrounding the constellations Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, and Perseus puts any soap opera to shame.\n\nQueen Cassiopeia angered the sea nymphs when she boasted that she was more beautiful. The sea nymphs complained to Poseidon, who sent Cetus, a sea monster, to ravage her husband Cepheus’s kingdom. To end their suffering, Cassiopeia and Cepheus sacrificed their daughter Andromeda to Cetus. Perseus rescued Andromeda, and the two were married. But that wasn’t the end of it!\n\nAmidst a duel between Andromeda’s other suitors, Perseus mistakenly killed Cassiopeia and Cepheus when he removed Medusa’s head.\n\nThe goddess Athena commemorated Andromeda by placing her image among the stars, next to the constellations representing her husband Perseus and mother Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia was condemned to circle the celestial pole forever and spends half the year upside down in the sky as punishment for her vanity. After his tragic death, Zeus placed Cepheus in the sky because he was descended from one of Zeus’ loves, the nymph Io.\n\nChinese\n\nIn Chinese astronomy, constellations are much smaller and more numerous than in Western traditions. Four mythological creatures guard the world called Four Symbols or Si Xiang.\n\nThe Four Symbols are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Black Tortoise, and Vermillion Bird. As the dragon is considered the noblest of animals, the Azure Dragon is the head of the four symbols. It is also the symbol of the emperor.\n\nIn Chinese mythology, the dragon is a fearsome and mighty creature. Unlike their Western counterparts, Chinese dragons are believed to be just, benevolent, and bringers of wealth and fortune."
