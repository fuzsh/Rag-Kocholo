        "text": "Family Constellations is also known as Systemic Constellations. This is an experiential (sensing and feeling) process that reaches into the underlying impulses that hold you back that may be inherited from your family. While we receive lots of good things from our families, we are also vulnerable to carrying burdens, emotions, beliefs and traumas that inhibit our potential to make the most of ourselves and our relationships.\n\nBert Hellinger developed Family Constellation Work, an effective therapeutic process that helps to break destructive family patterns of unhappiness, illness, failure, and addiction. The results are often immediate and life-changing.\n\nA session allows you not only to see and feel the dynamic you are caught up in, but also find better solutions with the ability to free yourself in a way that no other process can. This takes place in a brief process for permanent change and a new perspective.\n\nSuzi Tucker says that \"Constellations offer a safe container within which we can see more clearly what's been hidden, unclear or overwhelming. We get to better understand parts of ourselves, parts of our family members, or parts of our past. During a constellation, we get to experience watching what someone else would do in our shoes. We get to see the depths of our shared humanity and that is incredibly healing.\"\n\nIn order to really understand it, one must experience it. Here’s what Family Constellations can offer you:\n\nConnection to Self and self-awareness\n\nHealing at the root of your life issue or situation\n\nReleasing the toxic pattern or cycle by placing it back in its original context\n\nA recovery of the flow of love, re-source, Beauty and vitality\n\nMovement towards life and what is life-giving\n\nAcceptance of yourself and your human nature\n\nIllumination of the patterns or bonds that you are unconsciously connected with\n\nCultivation of intuition, mind-body-soul connection\n\nRelease of grief, loss, or emotion that is holding you back\n\nWalking in life with wholeness and ease\n\nResilience to handle and navigate all emotions\n\nDecrease in shame or feeling alone\n\nThe session usually begins with a brief discussion with a the client to gain an understanding of their system (family, relationship, work) history, significant relationships, and any specific situations or challenges they are facing.\n\nNext, Paloma may invite client to choose representatives for members related to the situation in focus. These representatives will be objects such as dolls, crystals or pieces of paper. The individual places the representatives in the room in a way that reflects their perception of the dynamics and relationships.\n\nOnce the representatives are arranged, begins the constellation process. The client may be asked to observe the representatives, and the Paloma may ask questions about their feelings and perceptions related to the members and their positions in the room.\n\nThrough this process, the client gains insights into hidden dynamics, entanglements, and unresolved issues within their system. They may observe patterns of loyalty, unresolved conflicts, or unacknowledged traumas that have been passed down through generations. Paloma will help her client to explore and understand these dynamics in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nTowards the end, the client will be guided through a process of healing and resolution. This can involve interventions such as repositioning the representatives, expressing unspoken emotions or messages, or offering healing statements to reconcile relationships within the system.\n\nEvery member in the system is affected even though they were not present for the individual session."
