This ain't some NFL stadium. I don't even understand the issue here. See. Go. Use your feet and brain. Maybe I just discovered the problem with that last sentence. :roll:\n\nGlad to know that your 13+ year absence has provided such keen perspective... My option is based on the $hit ton of money I pay to attend the games every year. I BTW enjoy going and feel its well worth it!!!\n\nUpgrades and/or stadium maintenance need to happen as a regular course of business, the game day experience has certainly changed over the last ten/twenty years and to provide what the fan needs requires that some things need updating! WGS has seen increased crowds, more season ticket holders, required heightened security, increased pricing for tickets and concessions, increased cost of maintenance, heightened demand for help, trouble staffing game day events not to mention social pressure to add alcohol sales, seating with added amenities and more seating in general.\n\nSo to answer you question:\n\nPress Box (or if you can't handle the name, Coaches box): needs to upgraded for the teams and the game day field experience, actual press facilities need to be in line with top flight facilities especially if we want to call it the \"Mecca of FCS\" football.\n\nRest Rooms: need to be more in line with handling 25K then 18K, need some traffic flow upgrade to get people in and out and need game day broadcast audio feeds so half the people using the facilities aren't trying to keep up with the game on their I-phone.\n\nConcourse Signage: Not the NFL but a premium stadium location that should have better location and directional signage and way better branding.\n\nConcessions: Better options and certainly better space for handling the crowds. Better prep area would make for a way better end product.\n\nEntry Scanners: Saying this because the scanners where I go in have had issues numerous times over the last few years, seem to be slow.\n\nOverall IMHO I believe the stadium staff does a fantastic job every game! I can only image how it would be with more to work with...\n\nFeel free to add to the list...\n\n3-7-77 said:\n\nGrizTexas said:\n\nPress Box\n\nRest Rooms\n\nConcourse signage\n\nConcessions\n\nEntry scanners\n\nJust to start a wish list...\n\nJust WHAT is wrong with what is there NOW?

No sense re-hashing the whole F'd up mess, but the IPF still isn't completed. There is a line from 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' where Indy is talking to his father, and says(paraphrasing) \"You taught me people that had been dead for 500 years were more important than I was(the present time).\"\n\nThe museum could have waited a couple of years, while tending to the present(our successful football team, y'know, the one responsible for filling WGS nine times last year, thereby underwriting HOW MUCH of UMs spending(?), and propping up how many businesses(?), and filling the GSA coffers). History is made TODAY.\n\nQuestion: Just who is this 'Press' that the Press Box' is supposed to serve? Missoulian and Tribune are all but officially dead. Just who are these people who couldn't write their God given wisdom from their paid for seats, or more likely their recliner in front of the TV?\n\nWhat a bizarre argument. What in the hell does the art museum have to do with the practice facility?\n\nI'll provide the research. Here is an excerpt from the website on the history of the museum. The successful completion of a stand-alone museum building is over twenty years in the making. A lot of people put in a lot of time and effort (and money) to make it happen. Like the IPF, it is privately funded.\n\n\"In 2002, Manuela Well-Off-Man, a German-born scholar with a focus on Native American art, started as curator and served as interim director until Nelson Britt was hired in 2003 with the express purpose of pursuing the construction of a new museum building. Britt died after eight months in the position and Barbara Koostra was named director in 2005.\n\nThe collection grew steadily under Koostra who developed an expansion plan with the construction of a new building at its core. Koostra made numerous attempts to build a new facility and also worked to increase professional practices at the museum, pursuing long range planning, revising collections management policies, and creating a Docent program. She hired Brandon Reintjes as curator in 2008 followed by Jeremy Canwell in 2015.\n\nUnder Koostra and Canwell, the museum secured the gift of nine paintings from the collection of Senator William A. Clark. This impressive grouping includes a relief sculpture of the Madonna and Child attributed to Italian renaissance sculptor Donatello, a landscape by English artist Thomas Gainsborough, and paintings by baroque artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard and French 19th century artists Jean-Charles Cazin, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, and Jules Dupré.\n\nIn 2018, the MMAC returned to the School of Visual and Media Arts. President Seth Bodnar’s administration prioritized the construction of a new building on the university campus and determined that it would be 100% privately funded. UM Art History and Criticism Professor Dr. H. Rafael Chacón was named Bruce and Suzanne Crocker Director of the MMAC the following year. Having taught art history and criticism in the School of Visual and Media Arts for 25 years, Chacón furthered the museum’s priorities and realigned others by prioritizing students as the museum’s primary constituents, seeking better integration with the university’s academic programs, diversifying the museum staff, globalizing its collections, forging new links across the community and state, and continued prioritizing of fundraising for a new building.\n\nIn 2019, a lead gift of $5 million dollars from Terry and Pat Payne catalyzed the construction of the first permanent home for the largest and deepest collection of art in the state. This foundational gift was only the start and inspired the generosity of many other donors, resulting in a $15 million dollar, state-of-the-art facility that opened its doors on the University of Montana campus in September 2023\""
