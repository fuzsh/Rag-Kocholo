        "text": "The color of the stars. Other answer(s) explain a situation where the observer is in our Universe, but not in the Earth. You ask for stars which are wrong and it is clearly visible that it cannot be our Universe. Thus, the stars in the sky must look somehow from which already an educated layman can say, it cannot happen.\n\nIf only the constellations differ, that can happen anywhere - already at ten light years away, most constellations become unrecognizable. If the milky way looks different, galaxies are visible in the sky, or there is more or fewer stars - these all can happen inside our Universe, only in different places.\n\nHowever, what cannot happen is certain colors of the stars. The stars are plasma, with a roughly black-body temperature spectrum (not exactly, but the difference is not visible to us). Thus, their temperature can affect their color, but it cannot be any color. How a human free eye sees a star, that depends on its temperature. It cannot be any color, only a color along this line:\n\nThus, a star can be red, orange, yellow, white or light blue. No star can be green, blue or purple. It is impossible. At least, in our Universe.\n\nP.S.: if you see the sky, you will see that most stars are white or yellow. That is because most stars we see are roughly Sun sized. There are some exceptions and with a good eye, in a clear sky you can see it.\n\nP.P.S.: There might be rare phenomena, such as having an oxygen nebula around the star, that could make a star green. But that is rare. It cannot happen in all stars.\n\nMinor Frame Challenge: You are using this trope wrong\n\nThe OP wants the stars to tell a person that they are in a different universe, but this is not what the trope is supposed to do. When people look up at the stars to see familiar constellations, they know that they are on Earth. But, when they look up at the stars and they are not the Earth's stars, it only tells us we are on another planet. Assuming you've been jumped into an alternate universe falls short of every reasonable explanation.\n\nReasons why Most answers don't work:\n\nDifferent Constellations: You are on any non-Earth planet.\n\nMore and Brighter or Less and Dimmer stars: You are on a planet closer to or farther from the galactic center.\n\nMore and Dimmer or Less and Brighter stars: You are in a more or less differentiated part of the galaxy.\n\nGreen Stars: Since the physics of this place are not so different that I am instantly dead, I'm gonna assume a world with a different atmosphere or nebula gasses that filters the starlight, or I might mistakenly believe that a visible star might be able to achieve a doppler effect of a red star getting closer or blue star moving away... something someone with some but not advanced knowledge of astronomy might think.\n\nStars don't move at all: The planet has a negligible spin relative to the galactic background.\n\nStars move fast enough to see move or orbit in different directions from one another: Those are just tiny moons reflecting the sun.\n\nStars don't move in smooth curves: This planet has a strong wobble.\n\nStars move completely randomly: Clearly, I am hallucinating. Avoid eating any more suspicious plants.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that no matter how weird you get, there is always going to be a more reasonable explanation than you are in another universe. Your reasoning does not even need to be scientifically accurate. Most people will simple put \"I'm in another universe\" at the very bottom of theories to try to explain anything unusual they encounter... unless...\n\nChange the Earth, but NOT the stars.\n\nThe Stars tell us where we are in the world. With a sextant, watch, and compass a savvy survivalist can tell just where he is in the world. Even without these tools, you might be able to get a decent approximation, but it will help the narrative if he has some kind of survival kit to work with. So imagine you are lost in the wilderness. You phone is dead, but no worries, you have all the tools you need to find your way back to civilization. You just need to follow the stars South for 50 miles, and you'll be at the nearest town... only when you get there, it is more wilderness. So, you keep going until you are certain you've gone too far, you circle back, and no matter how much you search you can't find it.\n\nWhat's worse would be if the stars eventually lead you to find a geologically significant landmark. A distinct mountain or lake that you know for certain should be surrounding by buildings, but it's just wilderness here.\n\nThe constellations tell you that you are certainly on Earth, but things are not where they should be. At this point, it is starting to become a reasonable assumption that you are on Earth... but not THIS Earth. At this point you are really suspicious, but maybe you traveled through time? Sure, it sounds ridiculous, but no more so than inter-universal travel; so, at this point all madness is equally viable. One thing you can reason though is that the stars are telling you that you've not traveled very far in time because constellations change over time... but maybe you went back by just a few centuries to before that town was founded? Maybe the stars have not moved enough yet to be noticably different?\n\nThe final nail in the coffin of your reality will be when you encounter people or wildlife that are not where, who, or how they should be. This could fully disprove time travel leaving jumping into an alternate reality (aka: another universe) as the only possible option left... that, or maybe hallucinations or a dream. Different people have different breaking points of disbelief; so, at this point it becomes an author's choice if your protagonist feels more comfortable believing that he is in an alternate universe or that he can simply not trust his own senses.\n\nIt will actually be the fact that the stars remain the same that your protagonist can rule out most other possible explanations of what is happening to him, and it will be the little epiphanies of his journey slowly invalidating his expectation of the stars that will lead to the rising action of realizing something is off instead of there being something about the stars themselves that should be immediately evident.\n\nWhat if you need the stars to be different for plot purposes?\n\nIf you can't rule out all other possibilities, then give your protagonist a reason to place inter-universal travel as a more likely conclusion. In real life, the idea of interplanetary travel seems the most possible because other planets are things we can see and measure whereas other universes only exist in vague theoretical terms. However, if the scientists in your world have already made functional inner-universal looking glasses to see into and confirm the existence of other realities, then even if inner-universal portals are not yet a thing, the possibility of inner-universal travel would suddenly seem far more conceivable.\n\nThere could even be published papers based on scientific observations about what makes these other realities unique from our own. In this case, whatever is different with the stars could be exceedingly subtle, but still enough to clue in your traveller because it would be the exact thing he'd be looking for. If you go this route though, there is no \"best possible answer\" to your question, because it would be up to you to come up with what science has defined as the key difference between realities.\n\nGreen is no Good\n\nI dont think making your Stars Green is a good option here. Green stars suggest Planck´s Law is different. Which, if you know how it is derived, is a big uff. Planck´s Law being different suggests several fundamental aspects (Including $\\pi$), are different. Which ultimately translates to a universe in which not a single law of physics applies as we know them.\n\nA Closed Universe\n\nThere are much more reasonable options at your disposal. One of which is a closed Universe. The ultimate curvature of the Universe is related to the Cosmological Constant $\\Lambda$. As the derivation of $\\Lambda$ proves, it can be 0 or any arbitary value without violating any core principle of physics.\n\nRight now, we think the universe is flat. However, this dosnt have to be the case. Your Alt-Universe could have negative curvature, creating a big hypersphere.\n\nOne of the interesting properties of such a closed universe would be that for one, Energy is conserved on a global scale which is very interesting. But even more interestingly, if you walk long enough in one direction you will end up where you started.\n\nAs such, the Stars in the sky would appear mirrored, each reflecting getting bigger and fainter.\n\nFinding proper simulations of this is hard so use your imagination. The stars would be fainter because each reflection looks further in the past and covers a greater distance. The Inverse Square law still kind of applies.\n\nOf course, if the Universe is sufficiantly small each reflection would add more energy than is lost (at least till some point) so the stars may appear a lot brigther than usual.\n\nThe point is, there is a balance where everything looks more or less right but you kind of get the feeling that parts of the Sky (especially bright stars) are mirrored and seem to have ghosts around them.\n\nThe Big Crunch\n\nAnother more sane option is to have a universe which is actively in the process of imploding.\n\nDue to how that works, your MC would be under a bit of a time crunch. As spacetime collapses into itself, all radiation ever emitted is Blueshifted. So everything gets cooked.\n\nBut, there is a short window of time in which your MC could make some interesting observations. If the implosion is fast enough, and there are not too many stars, they will notice that the night is pretty warm for the fact there is no sun. This is all the radiation being Blueshifted into the Infrared range.\n\nThey might also notice that the stars sure appear to get brighter as time goes on. Not just that, you kind of cant shake the feeling they are getting closer.\n\nIt might not be what you're looking for, but let me give it a shot.\n\n(...)\n\nThen I looked up.\n\nThe galactic globes of fiery gas that I so dearly loved to watch from my balcony were gone. In their place, an army of impostors - made of colors and lies and smells that couldn't be, that didn't exist and yet presented themselves to me in a blanket of defiance against anything I knew I knew.\n\nThe liars were uncountable. Bright grains of sand against a beach of darkness, that webbed and flowed with tides of entropy and wrongness. They danced together in pairs and trios that split up and embraced again, ever so slowly yet so fast moving.\n\nA noxious nebula took a large slice of the sky, glowing in blood-sick red with pockets of pustulent sickness. From its womb, dark stars glowed in reverse, sucking in the glow of the red and spitting out glimmers of pure shadow.\n\nA single, lonely blue moon cast its light from above, so immense that it could dwarf my own home planet, yet here it was nothing but a companion for whatever world I've found myself in. I couldn't take my eyes off it once we locked gaze - it felt entrancing, calming, yet so wrong - like the embrace of a forbidden lover of the indulgence of the addict. I shouldn't be there. It was telling me so.\n\nOnce I blinked, it blinked back to me - the moon now a single massive eye of red and blue and purple and pain and sorrow and joy and fury and a dance and hope and a scream and me and itself and nothing more but everything.\n\nI've intruded into the domain of Gods.\n\nAnd I wasn't welcome there.\n\nI see two paths here.\n\nOur adventurer doesn't know it, but they ventured inside a very advanced civilization's domain. They managed to cover multiple words with dyson-like spheres, enabling them to create whatever skybox they want for no other reason but for their own art. Unfortunately for our hero, their minds are quite different from ours, and what they consider art might be quite unsettling for those not used to it.\n\nOr\n\nOur adventurer stumbled into a different universe with different physics, different powers, and natural laws far more flexive and permissive from what he could find at home. Here is but a mere bug on the back of a living planet - and this living planet is just one in a swarm of beings like it.\n\nSame but different\n\nAs @Nosajimiki sagely points out, my first instinct (make the sky so radically different that an Earth person would immediately know it was different) would be the wrong way to show a different universe.\n\nMost reasonably educated people, even non-astronomically-inclined city dwellers like me, know at least one constellation: The Plough/Big Dipper/Ursa Major, Cassiopeia, Orion, the Pleiades, the Southern Cross... something.\n\nBonus points for a subtle and uncanny feature that allows for more gradual realization\n\nGiven this, let's make the reveal a multi-step thing.\n\nA pretty Aurora: weird but OK. Glowing with colours, a pretty light show. They look at it for a few seconds, but they are too busy with other things to think much about it. They would perhaps be surprised to see an aurora. (\"Aurora Borealis!? At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country?...\"). It'd be weird, perhaps a little unnerving in the context, but not supernaturally so.\n\nKnown constellations: comforting touchstone. Let the protagonist spot a couple of the constellations that they know. Preferably two well-known ones which are a decent distance from each other. So, say, Orion and the Ursa Major. Someone reasonably educated would know two constellations, and would understand that being able to see two that are at a significant angle to each other means they can't be too far from Earth in any direction. Seeing only one would mean they're in a line from earth to the midpoint of that constellation. Seeing two means that you're somewhere in the intersection of the two lines, which gives probably less than a lightyear of scope for movement, especially for those constellations with fairly close stars.\n\nBe sure to pick two constellations that are visible from wherever the protagonist is on Earth: the Southern Cross is only visible from the southern hemisphere, and Ursa Major from the northern!\n\nSo at first, seeing their familiar constellations, they would be comforted. I am comforted whenever I see the Plough. It's like a touchstone to me.\n\nPerhaps a couple of stars in the constellation are hidden behind the Aurora, but it's still easily recognizable.\n\nA Nebula: the penny drops. But over time, because it is static, with features and details that remain constant over multiple hours, the protagonist will slowly realize that the glow in the sky is not an aurora, a localized atmospheric phenomenon, but something bigger in scale.\n\nOne way to play with this is to have savvy readers spot this before the protagonist. Perhaps, in their initial glance, have them notice a curl that appears to wrap around the moon. In a later scene, describe that the moon has moved out of that curl, then that the moon's setting, and maybe even have the protagonist calculate time's passage by comparing the distance from the moon's position to the curl, dividing the arc of the sky into 12 to get approx time in hours, or treating the moon as a half-degree (fairly common knowledge I think), and counting the distance to the curl in moon-widths to get time in 720ths of a day, without explicitly mentioning or making any point of the fact that the curl (and hence the aurora) is stationary, until the protagonist goes \"hey wait, why isn't this aurora moving?\"\n\nHowever they realize, the protagonist can then look closer, and see more static details, sweeping tendrils of glowing gas across the sky. The moon isn't just \"bright enough to shine through\" the aurora, it's in front of the aurora. Has something happened in space? A big solar flare, or even something hit the far side of the Moon and filled Earth's orbit with dusty ejecta...?\n\nBehind the stars: unimaginable scale. To really drive home the scale to the reader, the protagonist may investigate further, in which case they will realize that the nebula is BEHIND the constellations we all know and love. Encompassing the whole Milky Way, that it's not just planetary, interplanetary, or interstellar, but intergalactic. Or at least, too nebulous to have a significant effect within just the few hundred light years that contain the stars of the constellations.\n\nSo the constellations would be visible as they are all made from nearby stars, only a few of them more than about 1k light-years of us, in our local area of the 100-light-year-across Milky Way galaxy. But Andromeda (another galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away) would be hidden by the glowing nebula. The Pleiades (442,000 light years) could be hidden, or just somewhat faded.\n\nYou might argue that knowing where to find galaxies or star clusters in the sky is a bit of a stretch, and I agree. I recognize the Pleiades when I see them, but I wouldn't be able to tell if they were missing, because I don't know where they are relative to other stuff. I suggest having them find it out from their phone's star map app. If the alternate world is similar enough, they can always just connect and download one, but otherwise, you can handwave that they have one that has the star maps cached and the last known geolocation cached, so being unable to connect to GPS and cell data would be another hint they aren't in the same reality, but wouldn't prevent the app from working. Either way, that'll show them where they SHOULD be able to see the various constellations, and they should match up perfectly... except for the missing distant stuff.\n\nScience: Is that even possible? Further investigation could show them that the largest known nebula is the NGC_262 halo cloud, only 1.3 million light years across, so what they're looking at is plausibly big, but its existence around the Milky Way implies at least subtle differences in the physical laws or formation of this universe, or some natural event at intergalactic scale, or some immense supernatural or alien influence, far beyond the normal imaginings of man.\n\nThis kind of scale should be a good place to stat with Bramblesandian \"eldrich madness\":\n\nPeople, especially games, get eldritch madness wrong a lot and it’s really such a shame.\n\nAn ant doesn’t start babbling when they see a circuit board. They find it strange, to them it is a landscape of strange angles and humming monoliths. They may be scared, but that is not madness.\n\nMadness comes when the ant, for a moment, can see as a human does.\n\nIt understands those markings are words, symbols with meaning, like a pheromone but infinitely more complex. It can travel unimaginable distances, to lands unlike anything it has seen before. It knows of mirth, embarrassment, love, concepts unimaginable before this moment, and then…\n\nIt’s an ant again.\n\nEchoes of things it cannot comprehend swirl around its mind. It cannot make use of this knowledge, but it still remembers. How is it supposed to return to its life? The more the ant saw the harder it is for it to forget. It needs to see it again, understand again. It will do anything to show others, to show itself, nothing else in this tiny world matters.\n\nThis is madness. -- Bramblesand, tumblr (worth reading the rest of that thread).\n\nWhy does this work?\n\nIt doesn't require \"navigator\"-level sky knowledge. I think enough of the readers can recognize two constellations that even a city dweller knowing them should be believable and relatable to the reader, unless your world is similar enough that their phones can connect, in which case they can always just Google it.\n\nSome non-Earth planet would not have the same constellations. Earth in some other time would not have the same constellations. And nowhere near Earth would have the same constellations, and still have the galaxy be within a hugely vaster nebula.\n\nThis is unlikely to be the same reality as they were in the day before, as that would require the nebula to have come into being across the entirety of the night sky in one day, which would require a faster-than-light spread of the nebula, so seems like an unlikely possibility. If there are other people in that reality, or internet sources there, who treat the nebula as if it has always been there, that would solidify this conclusion.\n\nThey can't fully eliminate the possibility of hallucination or insanity or other mental effect that causes them to either imagine the nebula, or to imagine that it once was not there. But some reasoned thought and confirmation from third parties (eg the cached star map, other people who came over with them) should allow them to rank that as fairly low on the probability list.\n\nThe only \"likely\" conclusion, then, however improbable, should be that this is Some Other Earth, in Some Other Reality. Maybe another timeline, a simulated reality, an alternate universe... but it is Other.\n\nOne) If the new location is in a multiple star system, the other stars might be so far away from the planet that they don't appear as discs and suns but as dots of light in the sky. But they might appear many times brighter in the sky of the planet than any stars in Earth's sky.\n\nSince other stars in the star system should be hundreds or thousands of times closer than stars in other systems, they should appear tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of times as bright as the stars in Earth's sky.\n\nMaybe when it or they are above the horizon they dim the distant stars in interstelalr space considerably and are all that someone can notice or pay attention to, but when they go below the horizon the other stars in interstellar space become very noticeable.\n\nTwo) Maybe, as others have suggested, the planet is in a denser region of space where a lot more stars are visible and some of them are much closer to it than any stars are to Earth, and thus appear much brighter.\n\nThree) You may have heard about a science fiction novel, The Mote in God's Eye (1974) by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. When I read it I tried to think of an astronomical phenomenon which could be called \"the Beam in God's Eye\".\n\nSuppose there was a world in the Virgo Galaxy Cluster where the great elliptical galaxy M87 appears as a circle of light in the sky, brighter toward the center, and the world is close enough to M87 that the light emitted by the relativistic jet of matter from the core could be seen. Thus if the natives call M87 the eye of their god, the jet could be called \"the beam in God's Eye\".\n\nA parsec is a distance at which 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) would appear to be one arc second wide. A parsec is 206,265 AU long. The jet of M87 is about 1,500 parsecs long, and thus, seen from the side, it would appear 1000 arc seconds long at a distance of 3,093,975 parsecs, 10,000 arc seconds long at a distance of 309,397.5 parsecs, 100,000 arc seconds long at a distance of 30,939.75 parsecs, etc.\n\nThe maximum resolution of the human eye is about 28 arc seconds or 0.47 arc minutes or about 0.0078333 degrees. Thus at a distance of 3,093,975 parsecs the jet would appear to be 7.8333 degress wide if seen at a right angle, which is about 15.666 times as wide as the Moon seen from Earth. I note that an astronomer is said to have seen the jet with his eyes through the 100 inch telescope, instead of in phtographs, so someone close enough to the jet should be able to see it with their unaided eyes from the surface of a planet.\n\nFour) Suppose that two spiral galaxies were headed for each other on a collision course, like the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are. If a planet is on the opposite side of its galaxy from the other galaxy, it would see both, one behind the others. If that planet orbited in the plane of its galaxy, it would see its galaxy's disc as a band of light across the sky, like the Milky way is seen from Earth.\n\nAnd if the other galaxy's plane was at an angle, it would be visible as an oval area of light in the skay. But the other galaxy could be oriented with the edge of its disc facing the planet. And the other galaxy's disc would probably be inclined at an angel to the disc of the nearer glaxay. Thus two milky ways would seem to cross each other in the sky.\n\nAnd I have some other ideas."
