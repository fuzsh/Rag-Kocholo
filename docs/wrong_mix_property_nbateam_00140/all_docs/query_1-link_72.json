She was surrounded by close family and friends in her final days.\n\nBorn in 1946 in Cranston, Rhode Island, Joyce attended Hope High School in Providence. She then studied at Tufts University, where she received a BA majoring in early childhood studies. Years later, she completed a Master’s Degree at Wheelock College, where she studied early intervention in children with disabilities. Joyce founded an innovative daycare program called Mothers and Toddlers Together. For more than 15 years, this program helped numerous young families. In 1981, Joyce helped to found the Weston Childcare Association, which continues to help young families.\n\nAfter her graduation from Tufts, Joyce married Dr. Bruce Pastor. They were married for almost fifty-five years. Together they had three children, Andy, Carrie, and Lauren. Andy passed away suddenly in an auto accident in 1988. After this tragedy, Joyce supported several causes to fulfill the Jewish tradition of Tikkun Olam, which means “to heal the world.” During the height of the AIDS epidemic, she volunteered at the Boston Living Center. She was dedicated to Temple Shir Tikva, where she was the only person to serve three years as President. She had a strong interest in interfaith dialogue and understanding.

Rebekah was the eldest child of Benjamin and Sylvia (Harris) Ralen of Brookline where she was raised. She graduated from Brookline High School and attended Lasell College in Newton. She worked in retail sales, though her true calling was in Jewish education, teaching Hebrew school at Congregation Beth El in Sudbury and later in California and Florida. She was the wife of the late Neil Grossman to whom she was married for 19 years.\n\nRebekah was a spiritual, intellectual, and contemplative person who loved to make others laugh. She was a fierce feminist and was involved with a number of social and political causes, including her passionate work on behalf of the Action for Soviet Jewry in the 1980s. Advocacy and justice were guiding principles in her life – using her voice to stand up for others. She believed in Tikkun Olam, the Jewish concept defined by acts of kindness performed to repair the world by helping one person at a time.\n\nOne of Rebekah’s favorite quotes was by Mary Oliver: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life,” and it was common for her to ask a variation of this question of total strangers. One of her greatest gifts was her ability to listen deeply, always seeking to understand the story of other people’s lives, their cultures, and their perspectives.\n\nThe shores of Martha’s Vineyard and California brought her joy; Lambert’s Cove Beach on the Vineyard was her place of peace. She was a lifelong learner, devoured poetry, and was an avid reader, sometimes reading multiple books in one day. She could discourse on many subjects, including ethics, politics, and religion. As a child, some of her best memories were driving through New Hampshire and Vermont with her father looking for old, interesting books at yard sales.\n\nRebekah is survived by her children Adam (and Roni) Grossman of Chevy Chase, MD, Gabriel Grossman of Boca Raton, FL, and Miranda (Jesus Bulnes) Grossman of Fort Lauderdale, FL, six grandchildren Nathaniel, Jackman, Alexa, Noah, Asher and Micha, two step-grandchildren Rebecca and Riley, her sister Annette (Paul) Roberts of Newton, her brother John (Sally) Ralen of Framingham, her sister-in-law Alberta (Roger) Lipson of Brookline and numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nFuneral services will be held at Beit Olam Cemetery, 60 Old Sudbury Rd. ( Enter North Cemetery) in Wayland, Massachusetts on August 19, 2022 at 1:00 pm, followed by a gathering at Temple Shir Tikva. Remembrances may be made to https://gofund.me/4083b363.\n\nGertrude “Gitty” Wind Scheft, whose early passion for Massachusetts Democratic politics was eventually eclipsed by her lifelong passion for Massachusetts golf, passed away peacefully at Carlton-Willard Village in Bedford August 17. She was 99.\n\nUpon graduating from Radcliffe in 1946, Scheft volunteered for her first campaign, when war hero John F. Kennedy sought James Michael Curley’s suddenly vacated congressional seat in the 11th District. With his father financing and running his campaign, the young Kennedy established residency in an apartment at 122 Bowdoin Street, across from the Massachusetts State House. Scheft’s primary job was to clean the apartment. Over the years, whenever asked about her initial impressions of the eventual 35th President, Scheft would say, “the most charismatic, but not the tidiest…”\n\nScheft worked for numerous Democratic state and local candidates, and served as a Massachusetts coordinator on both Adlai Stevenson Presidential campaigns. In 1948, she was a delegate at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. By the early 1950s, she was the first female executive secretary of the Massachusetts chapter of Americans for Democratic Action.\n\nWhen Foster Furcolo was elected governor of the Commonwealth in 1956, his office wanted a recurring morning television showcase for his wife, Kay, to appeal to stay-at-home housewives and mothers. They recruited Scheft, who had studied acting in prep school and college, to be her cohost. “Coffee with Kay” ran weekly for two years on WNAC.\n\nScheft reunited with Kennedy to work on his Presidential campaign in 1960. During an early staff confab, she told then Pennsylvania businessman and top Kennedy aide Milton Shapp her idea for an international volunteer program for recent college graduates. Shapp passed on the idea to the candidate, and is widely credited with promoting the concept that became the Peace Corps.\n\nIn addition to politics, Scheft spent her life devoted to various philanthropic pursuits. In 1964, Governor Endicott Peabody appointed her a trustee of Metropolitan State Hospital, a groundbreaking institution devoted to the mentally ill.\n\nBorn in Brockton in 1923, the fourth of six children to local leather magnate Max Wind and his wife Dora, by the late 1950s, Gitty (her father’s pet name that stuck) was busy raising six children of her own with Bill Scheft, the son of Beverly shoe wholesale-retailer Harry Scheft, who regularly did business with Max Wind. The two had been set up by their respective mothers in 1942 while Gitty was at Radcliffe and Bill at Harvard Business School. On their second date, they played golf. They were uniquely well-matched as players, a rarity in the male-dominated world of golf in the 1940s. The instant bond proved to be a strong (and fertile) soil on which to build their 65-year marriage. Bill Scheft passed away in June, 2008.\n\nGitty, who had begun playing golf at the age of seven at nearby Thorny Lea in Brockton, took to the game with rabid fervor. She had the benefit of learning the nuances from her older brother, Herbert Warren Wind, a 3 handicap by the time he turned 20 who would eventually become universally recognized as the Dean of American Golf Writers.\n\nDuring her eight-decade playing career, Scheft won club championships at four different country clubs and in 1972 was First Flight runner-up for the WGAM (Women’s Golf Association of Massachusetts) championship. In 2000, shortly before she stopped playing, Scheft miraculously shot her age (77) at Sterling National Country Club.\n\nShe also gave back to the game off the links, serving as WGAM President from 1983-1989 before stepping down to become the first female president of the Francis Ouimet Caddie Scholarship Fund in 1990. Two years before, she successfully spearheaded a movement to get the United States Postal Service to print a commemorative stamp honoring the 75th anniversary of Massachusetts amateur prodigy Ouimet’s unlikely victory in the US Open over former champions Harry Vardon and Ted Ray at the Country Club in Brookline. Under her watch, the Ouimet Fund became and remains the largest independent scholarship fund in New England.\n\nGertrude “Gitty” Wind Scheft is survived by her six children, her seven grandchildren and her great grandchild.\n\nJoseph Benjamin Green of Cambridge, Massachusetts, passed away on August 17, 2022 at 74 from pancreatic cancer. An accomplished attorney and tennis player, Joe was known for his integrity and agility, both in court and on the court.\n\nBorn in 1947 in New York City, Joe attended Horace Mann School for junior high and high school, followed by Yale University, where he majored in American studies. Upon graduation in 1969, he completed one year at Harvard Law School. He then took a four-year hiatus, during which he served on the Washington, D.C. police force and won a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to study the French police. But, as it turned out, the French police did not want to be studied.\n\nAll was not lost, however, as he met his future wife, Carol (a fellow New Yorker), in Paris, where she had been working as a textile designer. After embarking on a three-month backpacking trip through Southeast Asia, Joe and Carol returned to the United States, and he completed the last two years of Harvard Law School, graduating in 1976.\n\nShortly after his law school graduation, Joe and Carol married. Together they have three children, Jeff, Ariana, and Nick. Jeff and his husband, Adam, live in Scottsdale, Arizona, and have two sons, Zac and Ethan. Ariana and her husband, Sam, live in Scarsdale, New York, and have three children, Jella, Jake, and Ezra. Nick lives between New York City and Cambridge, where he has been assisting with Joe’s care since his diagnosis.\n\nJoe’s law career spanned over 40 years, beginning when he joined Hutchins & Wheeler, a Boston law firm. Always drawn to public service, he left private practice and spent the next decade serving as Chief District Court Prosecutor and Director of Policy and Planning for Essex County, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1989, Joe returned to private practice, joining the Boston law firm of Kotin, Crabtree & Strong, and soon became a partner. His practice areas included special education, personal injury, criminal law, and disability rights. In addition, he authored a book and several articles on evidence, trial practice and procedure, and criminal law. Outside of the office, Joe was an advocate for disability rights and served on the board of the Massachusetts Branch of the International Dyslexia Association.\n\nJoe was an avid tennis player. He played every Tuesday evening with a steady group of friends for more than 30 years and was a loyal member of the Cambridge Tennis Club, where he also served on the board. He and his son Nick won the father-son doubles championship in 2009. He also won the men’s doubles championships in 2002 and 2006.\n\nJoe always looked forward to his weekly golf outings, which occurred on the many Wednesday afternoons he and his golf group took off from work to hit the links. In addition to the local greens, they also enjoyed traveling to play courses across the United States and in other parts of the world.\n\nJoe was a beloved son of Ruth Finley Lein, the founder and publisher of The Fashion Calendar, and of Hank Green. He is survived by his brothers, Jim Green of Brewer, Maine, and Larry Lein of Cresskill, New Jersey.\n\nThere will be a memorial service in September, the time and date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, donations in memory of Joseph B. Green can be made to the ACLU of Massachusetts: https://bit.ly/JoeGreenTribute\n\nKUR, Mitchell, 87, of Dedham, August 13, 2022. Beloved son of the late Jack and Etta Kur. Loving husband of the late Carol Kur. Devoted father of Alison Kur (the late Michael Oshins), Susan Lees (Matthew), Dana Snyder (Andrew). Proud grandfather of Abi, Jem and Zachary Oshins, Josh and Jake Lees, and Gabe, Ben and Jon Snyder. Brother of the late Eunice Cooper (Roger) and Ed Kur (Sally), and loving uncle of many nieces and nephews. Mitch was born in Kansas City, Missouri. As a child he developed a love of learning, Judaism, and the arts. His first semester at Yale University (1957) he met Carol, his partner in life for 63 years until her death in 2020. After serving in the US Armed Forces, Mitch was selected for General Electric’s management training program and earned his MBA at Syracuse University (1965). He was a business manager, controller, and executive in a variety of industries, spending many years at Digital Equipment Corporation, later working as a consultant and real estate agent. He served as board member of Temple Beth Am in Framingham, Massachusetts, was a founder of the Jewish Federation in Framingham, and was a founder and long-term board member of the Rashi Jewish Day School. In recent decades he was a dedicated member of both Temple Israel in Boston and Temple Beth Elohim in Wellesley. A lover of the arts, Mitch (with Carol and friends) owned an art gallery, was a founding contributor to the Danforth Museum. A violinist from an early age he held season tickets to the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He was also an avid Boston sports fan. Mitch married his beloved Carol at age 22. They spent a lifetime together in an extraordinary partnership, filled with love and affection for each other, their children, and grandchildren.

Wellesley on Tuesday at 2:00 PM followed by burial at Temple Emeth Memorial Park, West Roxbury. Donations can be made to Temple Beth Elohim of Wellesley, MA, Temple Israel of Boston, MA, Danforth Museum of Framingham or Newbridge on the Charles in Dedham, MA.\n\nJanice Indeck, born Janice Sarah Rabinovitz, passed away on August 11 at the age of 93. The daughter of Ada and Jacob Rabinovitz, she began her life in Boston Massachusetts until eventually trading the harsh winters for the warmth and sunshine of Coral Springs, Florida. As the steadfast matriarch of a sprawling family, it was her boundless passion that became the gravitational force that held us together through times of prosperity and periods of struggle and would endure to shape the generations to come.\n\nFor Janice, an eternal romantic, life was a constant adventure filled with literary pursuits, spur of the moment trips, and most importantly, love. Like she said, “I love life, others dream of something better, I dream of more of the same.” However, her deepest love was for her six children, their spouses, her 17 grandchildren and two great grandchildren, each of whom claim their own special relationship with “Granjan.” A prolific writer, she imprinted us all with her talent to capture the magic of words and inspired many of us to become school newspaper editors, writers, and poets—while ingraining writing into the very soul of our family. She published a novel, One Last Child and countless collections of poems and aphorisms. But her tremendous literary influence did not stop there. Up until her illness, Janice taught classes at the local library and through video conferences with the goal of guiding her many class participants to write their life stories, giving a voice to so many who had previously been unheard and securing their narratives in history. The classes grew and for many the joy of writing became a highlight of their lives.\n\nGranjan had an indomitable will, the impossible was merely a temporary condition. Born an heiress to the Stop and Shop empire her father started, Janice found herself at one point with her fortune gone and six children to support. Drawing from her knowledge of antiques, Janice started a business. She began with yard sales, graduated to estate sales, opened her own successful antique store, “Yesterday’s Yield,” and then become an auctioneer. This child of privilege proved she could succeed in the toughest of circumstances. Janice was very specific that she was four feet, eleven and three-quarters of an inch tall, but her presence in our lives was that of a giant. None of her will to thrive was lost on those that loved her. Each of us, when times got tough, would reach out to Granjan, never failing to come away with a sense of strength and purpose to overcome the hurdles in our lives.\n\nMarried four times, the brilliant and beautiful Janice Rabinovitz loved the way she lived—passionately. She was always stylish, favored extravagant jewelry and was ravenous for a new adventure. She craved knowledge and astounded many doctors and scholars with her grasp of a seemingly limitless store of information and opinions. Life with Granjan was inescapably vivacious, compellingly chaotic, and absolutely unforgettable. She was also the rock that we all stood upon, and we will miss her fiercely. But her astonishing legacy has insured that each of us will be able to hear the strength of her counsel in our minds for evermore.\n\nDavid G. Eisenstadt, of Belmont and North Falmouth, passed at home on August 9, 2022, at the age of 79, after a long illness.\n\nDave was born in Roxbury, MA to the Hon. Samuel and Esther. He was always proud to proclaim that he was a “Roxbury boy.” He graduated from Milton High School in 1960, and Boston University in 1965. He followed in his father’s footsteps into the legal field and graduated from BU Law in 1968.

Sandy was born in North Adams, Massachusetts on November 18, 1930 to Samuel U. Hirsh and Rebecca C. Hirsh. A popular and successful student, she was valedictorian of the class of 1948 at Drury High School. Heading down the Mohawk Trail over the Hoosac Range to Wellesley College, Sandy graduated with a degree in Sociology with the class of 1952, having served as President of Shafer Hall, her residence as an upperclassman. On January 7, 1950, Sandy accepted an invitation from a newly engaged classmate to join in a celebratory dinner as the date of Jordan L. Golding. Sandy originally had insisted that she would rather rearrange her sock drawer than go out on another blind date, but after sneaking a peek at Jordan in the Shafer Hall lobby by skulking down the back stairs, Sandy took a chance. Sandy and Jordan were married on March 15, 1953 in North Adams, following Sandy’s graduation and the conclusion of Jordan’s Navy service. Sandy began a long career in education, working with children with reading challenges. She earned a Master’s in Education from Boston University in 1958 and Master’s in Children’s Literature from Simmons in 1987. Sandy retired from the Brookline Schools in 1993. Engaged not only in her own career, Sandy supported Jordan’s professional success, and saw to the care, feeding, education and carpooling of her three children, Larry (1955), Ellen (1957) and Matt (1962). Sandy enjoyed her home on the Cape, travel, sailing and singing, among other interests. Sandy triumphed in a battle with Stage 4 lung cancer in 1993, an ordeal which drew upon all of her strengths as a woman, and which honed the “seize the day” approach to life that had always been part of her character. This brief biographical note aside, Sandy will always be remembered for her generosity of spirit, her caring for others, and her concern lest any family member or guest not have enough to eat. A friend of ours once described Sandy to another friend about to meet her, “Mrs. Golding is a person who, after you have driven two hours to her house, will meet you in the driveway, ask how your trip was, and then offer that she had made a turkey, in case you were hungry.” Sandy was predeceased by Jordan, her husband of sixty-eight years. She is survived by her children, Laurence (Cynthia), Ellen Rosenblatt, (David) and Matthew (Dawn). Her grandchildren, Eliot, Rebecca, Sam and Josh, step-grandchildren, Danny (Missy), Sarah, Aaron (Carly) and Sarah, and step-great grandchildren, Seth and Simon, were her pride and joy. Somewhat ironically, despite having lived a full 91 years, she was taken too soon. We love you, Mom!\n\nServices will be held at Congregation B’Nai Tikvah, 1301 Washington St., Canton, MA on Sunday, August 7th 2022 at 11 am.

Wiesen, beloved husband, father, and grandfather, passed away on July 22, 2022. He was born on May 2, 1945 to Harold and Elsie (Witzling) Wiesen in Brooklyn, New York. After an early childhood of stickball and rooting for the Dodgers, his family moved to Norwalk, CT in 1957. It was there that he met Elaine Zabelle, a sixth grade classmate who would later become his high school sweetheart. They continued dating through college with Jeff hitchhiking from MIT to visit Elaine in upstate New York. They were married in 1967 and recently celebrated their 55th anniversary. After graduation, Jeff attended Yale Law School.\n\nAfter law school, and an interlude in Colorado serving in the Air National Guard, Jeff and Elaine settled in the Boston area, living in Lexington for almost 50 years. Jeff started as an associate at Mintz Levin in 1971, rising to the role of Managing Partner in the mid-1990s.

She was married to Richard A. Pinkowitz for 51 years; who adored her from the moment they met. She is survived by her two loving sons, Andrew H. Pinkowitz and his wife Lisa Rondo Pinkowitz and their daughter Augusta Anya of Harrison, NY, and David E. Pinkowitz and his wife Randi Melton Pinkowitz and their child Chloe Emma, also of Harrison, NY, and Connor Joseph Pinkowitz and Allegra Grace Pinkowitz, both of Brooklyn, NY from a prior marriage. She was the daughter of Joseph Mayer Edinburg and Dorothy Braude Edinburg of Chestnut Hill, MA. She had two siblings, John David Edinburg of Brookline, MA and Hope Lynn Edinburg who predeceased her.\n\nJoAnn was an energetic presence, passionate about her friends, her family and collecting art. JoAnn easily connected with people. She loved adventure, including self-guided trips to southeast Asia. She connected to people with a projected warmth and friendliness beyond language. In a trip to western China where foreigners were rare, JoAnn walked the street and would greet people with her big “Hello” and received smiles and “Ni haos,” in response.\n\nShe loved people and they reciprocated. She maintained friends from pre-school, her boarding school at Walnut Hill School in Natick, MA, in college at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH, and even those made yesterday.\n\nAfter family, JoAnn’s passion for art and collecting prints was her next priority. In the art world she was a scholar and a networker. She put her energy into researching and collecting Mexican Modernist Prints, at the time a yet underappreciated niche which connected with other wood block print movements around the world. In considering purchases she would network with the museum community to research significance and quality. She would discuss a print with a museum curator and after an hour of discussing the print, other art topics and mutual connections, JoAnn would have also made another friend. JoAnn networked within the museum community, built friendships and a museum quality collection of Mexican Modernist prints.\n\nHer collection of Mexican Modernist print collection led to collecting Chinese Revolutionary prints from the Communist Revolution. The Mexican print collection led to collecting Mexican silver jewelry, which lead to collecting Bakelite jewelry. Jewelry naturally led to fashions, and JoAnn became an expert at finding vintage clothing in shops and yard sales. Each collection she carefully researched and measured with existing collections to assure that each piece was “museum quality.”\n\nJoAnn was not only an art scholar, but she also loved adventure. Whether it was skiing expert trails in the western US, sailing on the family boat Tantrum from New York City to Maine, or travelling, she was up for adventure. She was an avid swimmer, in a pool or off the stern of Tantrum in the ocean. Richard loved southeast Asia and they made many trips, one which they titled “30 caves in 30 days.” It was a trek along the Northern Silk Road from the western border of China to Beijing, by plane, train, taxi, and camel. All on their own, without a guide. JoAnn had great trust in Richard’s rudimentary Chinese.\n\nJoAnn loved to learn and share her learning with others. In her teens she was a volunteer in the Print and Drawings Department at the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), Boston. In her later years she also volunteered in the Asian Art Department and the Asian Art Conservation department at the MFA, as well as in the Asian Art Department at the British Museum.\n\nJoAnn’s multiple interests and desire for “museum quality” collections connected her with many departments at museums. Her museum visits were packed with meetings in multiple departments. Her breadth of collecting knowledge and cross-departmental interest enhanced her meetings with every department and curators appreciated her enthusiasm.\n\nJoAnn was more than successful, as many friends and colleagues said, “she was the rare person who was successful and still nice.”\n\nDonations can be made to MGH Diabetes Research Center, c/o David M.

She is also survived by her adoring grandchildren Michael and Alyssa Berkson, and Alex, Sam, and Josh Clopper.\n\nPhyllis spent 32 years devotedly working at the Framingham Public Library. She had a great passion for music, and her beautiful alto voice was a wonderful addition to the choir at Temple Beth Am in Framingham, Sweet Adelines, Stardust Show Chorus, and Sudbury Savoyards. She loved to sing in harmony with others, most especially with her granddaughter, Alyssa.\n\nHer love of family was always evident. Every new baby in the family received a sweater lovingly knitted by her. She treasured her weekly responsibilities taking care of her grandchildren every Wednesday from the time they were infants. That dedication to family carried over into a passion for genealogy. She was able to solve many mysteries, including the true identity of her father’s birth mother.\n\nA funeral service was held at Temple Beth Elohim in Wellesley, with interment at Beit Olam Cemetery in Wayland. In lieu of flowers, donations in Phyllis’ memory can be made to the Alzheimer’s Association (alz.org) or the charity of your choice.\n\nPhyllis was very special and made everyone feel welcome and respected.

She designed her home and garden to allow you to see something beautiful from anywhere you were sitting, and every sight line from the house was a specific canvas for her. She was patient and let nature decide what was going to happen; her decisions were slow and deliberate.\n\nRuth was the daughter of Sylvia and Benjamin Nechis of New Rochelle, NY, and is survived by her brother Mal (& Joan) Nechis of Pleasantville, NY.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Ruth’s memory may be made to Friends of Acadia at https://friendsofacadia.org/membership-giving/other-ways-to-give/tribute-gifts/ or mailed to Friends of Acadia, PO Box 45, Bar Harbor, ME 04609.\n\nPortia Gwen (Raider) Harcus, of Boston, passed away on July 14, 2022.
