        "text": "Pittsburgh Pirates rookie phenom Paul Skenes is the starting pitcher for the National League in the 2024 All-Star Game in Arlington, Texas on Tuesday night.\n\nThe 22-year-old Skenes has had a meteoric rise since the Pirates selected him with the first pick in the 2023 draft a year ago. After flying through the minor leagues, Skenes has a perfect 6-0 record and a miniscule 1.90 ERA with 89 strikeouts in 66.1 innings.\n\nSkenes is the first Pirates’ pitcher to start for the National League since Jerry Reuss in 1975. Reuss threw three-shutout innings in a 6-3 win for the Senior Circuit in that game.\n\nAlthough Reuss pitched three innings, it has already been predetermined by manager Torey Lovullo that Skenes, in all likelihood, will pitch one inning.\n\nThe top three hitters in the American League lineup are Guardians outfielder Steven Kwan, Orioles shortstop Gunnar Henderson and Yankees right fielder Juan Soto. Yankees star and American League MVP favorite Aaron Judge is batting fourth.\n\nLooking at the odds provided by the FanDuel sportsbook, the American League is the slight favorite at -118 on the Moneyline over the National League (+100). The over/under is set a 7.5 runs.\n\nSkenes is +3,000 to win the All-Star Game MVP. Bryan Reynolds, the other Pirates’ representative at this year’s All-Star Game, is +5,000.\n\nIn terms of prop bets, FanDuel has a number of different options available. One of the things that can be bet on is the velocity of Skenes’ first pitch.\n\nSkenes’ first pitch registering 99.0-100.0 mph is considered one of FanDuel’s ‘Best Bets’ for the 2024 All-Star Game.\n\nSince he was promoted to the big leagues, Skenes has thrown his power-fastball 38% of the time and averages 99.1 mph with the pitch, but will there be extra adrenaline pitching on the big stage? Will he throw a fastball with his first offering to Kwan?\n\nIn addition to his fastball, Skenes uses his splinker 31% of the time. He will also mix in a slider, curveball and the occasional changeup.\n\nSkenes is continuing to run away in the National League Rookie of the Year race. His odds have catapulted all the way to -1,110 at the break. Padres outfielder Jackson Merrill, who was also named an All-Star, is second at +550. Fellow Pirates starter Jared Jones is 11th at +10,000."
