        "text": "151 Merrimac Street\n\nBoston, Massachusetts 02114\n\nU.S.A.\n\nHistory of Boston Celtics Limited Partnership\n\nOperator of the Boston Celtics basketball team, Boston Celtics Limited Partnership represents the financial, managerial, and broadcasting power behind arguably the most successful franchise in the history of sports, the Boston Celtics, a team that has won an unprecedented 16 national championship titles during the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s and counts among its players many of basketball's legendary figures. Sixteen Celtics players were inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame between 1960 and 1987, with Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and others certain to add to that prestigious total once eligible for consideration. The team won 11 championship titles during a 13-year span, including eight in a row, accomplishing a feat unparalleled in American major professional team sports. Celtics players from the past included the best to ever play the game of basketball; its owners and coaches were among the most revered, most despised, and most controversial figures in sports history. By all measures, the Celtics represented a legacy of success and captivating lore. Its storied history, its decades of dominance in the National Basketball Association, and the idiosyncratic personalities who created the franchise's success combined to create a unique Boston Celtics mystique--one that defied duplication and one that distinguished the organization from all others in professional sports. Yet the magnitude of the corporate entity behind the basketball team and the amount of revenue directly derived from the team belied the significance and wealth of success the Celtics represented.\n\nBoston Celtics L.P. occupied a singular position both in corporate America and among the roster of team owners in the National Basketball Association. In terms of annual revenue the company ranked well below the thousands of medium-sized companies scattered across the country, generating less than $100 million per year in revenue. Paradoxically, yet indicative of the enormous business professional sports represented during the 1980s and 1990s, the company derived relatively little from the sale of game tickets, making the majority of its money--more than 70 percent--from advertising, television, cable, and radio fees. Financially, Boston Celtics L.P. was supported by much more than the Boston Celtics, yet it was nothing without the Boston Celtics and the widespread interest created by the team.\n\nAs owner of the Boston Celtics, Boston Celtics L.P. assumed its position of control relatively late in the team's history, beginning its corporate life in 1986, 40 years after the team was formed. Considering that the Celtics recorded 16 league championships during the 40-year span bridging the team's creation and the formation of Boston Celtics L.P., nearly all of what Boston Celtics L.P. represented during the mid-1990s was owed to the owners, players, and coaches who created the Celtics dynasty between 1946 and 1986, none of whom could have made the contributions they did without the dogged efforts of the team's founder, Walter Brown.\n\nOwner of the Boston Bruins hockey team and the fabled Boston Garden, Brown cared little and perhaps knew even less about the game of basketball when he and a small group of arena operators gathered in New York City in 1946 to organize the Basketball Association of America. Like others in attendance, Brown was primarily concerned with keeping his arena filled with paying spectators, something that had proven hard to accomplish during the winter nights in Boston. Brown had made various attempts to keep the turnstiles spinning at Boston Garden when the Bruins had the night off, booking the Ice Follies, Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Baily Circus, a Notre Dame football game, midget auto races, rodeos, women's softball games, and book shows, but he was in search of a steady attraction and went to New York to create one.\n\nBasketball seemed an odd choice considering the game enjoyed little popular support, particularly in Boston, where the population was devoted to baseball and hockey. Basketball, in fact, had been eliminated from the Boston city school system in 1925, nearly two decades earlier. Nevertheless, Brown and his cohorts--all of whom, except one, owned hockey teams--organized the 11-member Basketball Association of America in the Commodore Hotel on June 6, 1946, and Brown left New York with a basketball franchise, as yet unnamed.\n\nAfter considering several team names, including \"Whirlwinds,\" \"Unicorns,\" and \"Olympics,\" Brown opted for \"Celtics,\" hoping to grab the attention of Boston's large Irish population. John Davis \"Honey\" Russell was hired as the first Celtics coach, and the team soon began its inaugural season, losing its first game 59--53 to the Providence Steamrollers, the first of many losses during the franchise's fledgling years. The Celtics were 22--38 after their first season, and, despite Brown's expectations of packing his arena with adoring fans, the team never filled half the seats in the Boston Garden, averaging only 3,608 people per game. The Celtics posted a losing record the following year yet made the playoffs. But more important to the team's future was its financial condition, as the losses mounted for Brown and the company he led, Boston Garden Arena Corporation.\n\nA coaching change was made before the 1948-1949 basketball season, with Alvin \"Doggie\" Julian taking over for Honey Russell, but his impact was negligible and the Celtics again recorded a losing season, winning 25 games and losing 35. By this point the financial condition of the team was grave. During its third season, the Celtics lost $100,000, bringing the total loss for its first three seasons to $350,000. Shareholders of the Boston Garden Arena Corporation wanted out and urged Brown to fold the franchise, but Brown persevered, convincing the disgruntled stockholders to give the Celtics franchise one more year to prove its financial viability. The following season was the worst in the franchise's short history, as the Celtics posted a dismal 22--46 record; the team's record was 89 victories and 147 losses during the first four years. As a result, attendance had declined and the franchise lost another $100,000, bringing its total loss for four years of operation to nearly $500,000. Boston Garden Arena Corporation stockholders were no longer receptive to Brown's pleas after the fourth season and they sold their stakes in the franchise to Brown, leaving the disheartened founder saddled with debt and in charge of the failing Celtics.\n\nTo stave off a complete collapse of the franchise, Brown sold his home and other private investments, keeping the Celtics in business for another season. As later became apparent, Brown's decision to keep the team afloat, despite no obvious sign that the team's future would be any more successful than its past, was an immensely beneficial one. Two new faces arrived for the 1950-1951 basketball season: coach Arnold Jacob \"Red\" Auerbach, who was hired as the Celtics third head man in five years, and guard Bob Cousy, who would convert his harshest critic--his new coach--into one of his staunchest supporters. Red Auerbach, age 32 when Walter Brown named him coach of the Celtics, would be chiefly responsible for creating the celebrated Celtics mystique that would intimidate opposing players and draw legions of Celtics fans into the Boston Garden for generations to come. With his ever-present victory cigar clamped in his mouth, Auerbach would guide the Celtics through the team's much heralded glory years, orchestrating the action from courtside for the next 16 seasons, then wielding his managerial control for decades afterward. Under Auerbach's glare, the other new arrival--Cousy--would develop into one of the game's greatest players, transforming the Celtics organization from a perennial loser into the most successful franchise in the history of professional basketball.\n\nTogether, Cousy and Auerbach righted the floundering Celtics, who posted a 39--30 record during the 1950-1951 season--the team's first winning season--and advanced to the playoffs. Perhaps more important, average attendance rose 2,000 per game during the season, enabling Brown to begin recouping his losses and beat back the financial pressures that threatened the franchise's existence.\n\nThe Celtics advanced to the playoffs each of the next five years, but a championship title--the hallmark of a sports organization's success--eluded the franchise. In retrospect, the Celtics were missing one key player, and that player, Bill Russell, arrived in camp in the autumn of 1956. The acquisition of the 6′10″ Russell took the Celtics franchise over the top; during his rookie year (1956-1957) attendance rose by an average of 2,500 fans and the Celtics won their first league championship. After losing the championship series the following season to the St. Louis Hawks (whom Boston had defeated to take their first championship), the Celtics captured an amazing eight titles in a row, ranking as the National Basketball Association's preeminent franchise between the 1958-1959 and 1965-1966 seasons.\n\nWalter Brown died in 1964, near the end of the Celtics' string of championship titles, marking the end of one era and the beginning of another as the reins of ownership, which had remained with Brown for nearly 20 years, passed from hands to hands. The connection between Walter Brown and the Celtics franchise had been resolute; when the bond was severed, it was not long before a series of owners took over and dissolved the familial nexus between owner and franchise. Following Brown's death, Lou Pieri, who had been co-owner with Walter Brown since 1950, and Marjorie Brown took charge of the Celtics organization for a year, then a succession of corporate owners, incongruous with the Celtics-Walter Brown era, assumed control: National Equities, 1965-1968; Ballantine Brewery, 1968-1969; Trans-National Communications, 1969-1971; Investors' Funding Corporation, 1971-1972; and Leisure Technology, 1972-1974.\n\nTwo years after Brown's death, another Celtics era ended when Red Auerbach relinquished his coaching duties and Bill Russell took over, becoming the first African-American to either coach or manage a major professional sports team. Under Russell, the Celtics won two more championship titles (1968 and 1969); the team went on to win two more league titles during the 1970s with Tom Heinsohn, a former Celtics player, coaching the team. Ownership of the franchise during the mid- and late 1970s had devolved to Los Angeles film producer Irv Levin, who, in 1978, traded the Celtics franchise to John Y. Brown and Harry Mangurian in exchange for the Buffalo Braves franchise, which Brown and Mangurian owned. Aside from the peculiarity of trading one franchise for another, the deal between Levin and Brown/Mangurian was notable for another reason: the arrival of John Y. Brown to the Celtics organization put in place an owner who would ignite a bitter, intrafranchise feud and engender the Celtics' most contentious year in its history.\n\nAuerbach, who continued to embody the Celtics mystique and direct the franchise as its general manger, disliked John Y. Brown intensely, particularly because Brown had ignobly obtained the revered Celtics franchise through a swap. Even more irksome to the longtime Celtics coach and general manger was Brown's disregard for his authority. As part of the franchise swap, several Celtics players were sent to the Braves franchise, the first time a player transaction had been made without Auerbach's knowledge since his arrival in 1950, nearly 30 years earlier. Angered, Auerbach began discussions with the New York Knicks about a job with the franchise and was offered a four-year contract as president of the rival organization for a salary that would make him the highest paid National Basketball Association executive ever.\n\nAuerbach relented, opting to remain in Boston after listening to advice from his wife and gaining assurances from Brown that he would not be excluded from future decisions affecting Celtics players. Less than a year later, Brown traded three first-round draft picks to the New York Knicks for Bob McAdoo without consulting Auerbach, bringing the running feud between the two to a climatic tumult. Enraged, Auerbach approached Brown and informed the Celtics owner that if he did not sell the team within two weeks he--Auerbach--would leave. Two weeks later, Brown sold his interest in the team to Harry Mangurian; Brown then went on to successfully run for governor of Kentucky.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this public dispute between Brown and Auerbach, the Celtics franchise had drafted a 6′9″ forward from Indiana State University named Larry Joe Bird in 1978. Bird would establish himself during the 1980s as one of the greatest players in the history of the game, and with the addition of Kevin McHale and Robert Parish (both of whom were acquired through a complicated trade involving Bob McAdoo), the Celtics franchise had formed the nucleus of a team that would win three national championships during the 1980s, extending the winning tradition into a fourth decade.\n\nAs the drive toward winning three championships during the decade gained momentum, ownership of the franchise once again changed hands when, in 1983, Harry Mangurian sold the team to Don Gaston, Paul Dupee Jr., and Alan Cohen for $17 million. The new owners were intent on transforming the Celtics franchise into a major, profitable business, rather than treating it like a prestigious, self-aggrandizing asset, as many of the owners who followed Walter Brown had done. Gaston, Dupee, and particularly Cohen wanted more from their acquisition and began looking for a way to substantially build on their investment. Ticket prices were raised, but the three owners were in search of a way to realize more dramatic financial gains. In 1985 Cohen learned of such a way from David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association.\n\nFollowing Stern's suggestion, Gaston, Dupee, and Cohen formed a master limited partnership named Boston Celtics L.P. that enabled the three owners to avoid paying a substantial percentage of taxes on revenue the franchise generated and provided for the distribution of shares of Boston Celtics stock to the public, a first for a professional sports franchise. In 1986, 2.6 million Celtics shares, representing 40 percent of the team, were offered to the public at $18.50 per share, from which the three owners earned $44.74 million in proceeds. After the public offering, Gaston owned 32.5 percent of the Celtics, Dupee owned 14.7 percent, and Cohen owned 11.8 percent, more than enough to continue with their ownership unchallenged by all others.\n\nThe formation of Boston Celtics L.P. and the sale of Celtics stock had given the three owners much, yet the proceeds gleaned from the public offering were not sufficient to keep Gaston, Dupee, and Cohen from searching for other ways to capitalize on their investment. In 1985 the Celtics franchise sold its television rights in a five-year deal to an independent UHF station, WLVI-TV, which immediately increased the station's estimated value from $50 million to $75 million, giving the three owners tangible evidence of the financial worth of their organization and the magnitude of revenue others were earning from their franchise. In order to redirect the broadcasting revenues into their pockets, Gaston, Dupee, and Cohen began hatching plans to acquire their own broadcasting entities, and in late 1987 the opportunity arrived.\n\nAfter WFXT-TV became available the Celtics franchise purchased it for $10 million and formed Boston Celtics Communications Limited Partnership, a sister company to oversee the broadcasting business of the Celtics organization. The Celtics then sold their own station the broadcasting rights to air Celtics games for $30,000 per game during the preseason, $150,000 per game during the regular season, and $200,000 per game during the playoffs. When WEEI-AM was acquired by Boston Celtics Communications L. P. in 1989, the three partners worked out a similar arrangement, giving the Celtics franchise radio broadcasting fees ranging between $1.4 million and $2.5 million per year.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1990s, as the Celtics' dominance on the basketball court began to wane, Gaston, Dupee, and Cohen stood over a genuine sports empire, with revenue pouring in from the Celtics on the court and the Celtics over the airwaves. When Mangurian sold the Celtics in 1983, the team was generating roughly $8 million in revenues per season. After going public in 1986, the franchise's annual revenue volume rose dramatically, more than tripling as the team's coffers swelled from broadcasting and licensing contracts and increased ticket prices. Financial growth continued into the next decade, thanks to the formation of Boston Celtics Communications L. P. and its two primary assets, WEEI-AM and WFXT-TV, boosting Boston Celtics L.P.'s annual revenues to $30 million in 1990. By 1993, the company was generating more than $80 million annually.\n\nBy the end of the 1993 fiscal year, both Larry Bird and Kevin McHale had retired from the team, with Bird making his exit before the 1992-1993 season and McHale leaving after the 1992-1993 season. Their departures marked the end of yet another era in Celtics history, raising concern over the team's future and its ability to win additional championship titles. In 1994, the company sold its radio station, and the following year it sold the television station WFXT for accumulated proceeds of about $105 million.\n\nThere was no doubt where future Celtics teams would play their home games, however. The franchise played its last season at the Boston Garden during the 1994-1995 basketball season and began its 1995-1996 campaign at the new and larger FleetCenter, where both the Celtics and Boston Celtics L.P. hoped to establish a winning and lucrative tradition.\n\nPrincipal Subsidiaries: BCCLP Holdings Corporation; Boston Celtics Communications LP (99%); Boston Celtics Broadcasting LP (99%); WEEI-AM (ABC Radio Network).\n\nRelated information about Boston Celtics\n\nAmerican professional basketball team which dominated the sport in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It won eight consecutive National Basketball Association championships in 1958–9 and 1965–6.\n\nThe Boston Celtics are a professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. (1995-present)\n\nFranchise History\n\nThe Beginning of a Dynasty (1946-1969)\n\nThe Celtics were formed in 1946 as a team in the Basketball Association of America, and became part of the National Basketball Association after the merger of the BAA and the National Basketball League to form the NBA in the fall of 1949. The Celtics had struggled during their early years, but the hiring of Coach Red Auerbach would change their fortunes. One of the first major players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy, whom Auerbach initially refused to draft. Under Auerbach, the Celtics acquired rookie Bill Russell in 1956. the Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, giving the Celtics the first of their record 16 NBA Championships. Jones, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for over a decade.\n\nIn 1959, with Russell and Jones, the Celtics won the NBA Championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers. Other important players during this era included Sam Jones, John Havlicek, and Tommy Heinsohn. However, with Dave Cowens, Paul Silas, and Jo Jo White, the Celtics became dominant again. In 1974 the team bested the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA Finals, and in 1976 the team won yet another championship thanks to defeating the Phoenix Suns. In the following season, Bird was joined by another Celtics draft pick, Kevin McHale, and trade acquisition Robert Parish. At this time the Celtics also had Cedric Maxwell, a solid veteran who was part of the first two \"Bird Era\" championship teams. The Celtics went on to capture the NBA Championship in 1981, just two years after Bird had been drafted, under head coach Bill Fitch.\n\nK.C. During this time, the Celtics added players like Danny Ainge, Dennis Johnson, and M.L. In 1984 the Celtics would come back from a 2-1 deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals, thus winning their 15th championship. Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers (and former Michigan State) star Magic Johnson during this series. During the following offseason the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell. Jones had led the Celtics to four consecutive NBA Finals appearances against the Lakers and Houston Rockets when all was said and done. The Celtics would remain competitive for the rest of the 80's, but would only return once more (1987 - losing 4-2 to the Lakers) to the NBA Finals again after 1986.\n\nThe Celtics drafted Len Bias in the 1986 NBA Draft and had high hopes for the young University of Maryland star.\n\nTragedy and Decline (1993-2001)\n\nThe era of the great teams of the 1980's drew to close as Larry Bird began to experience back trouble and Kevin McHale and Robert Parish's skills began to diminish with age. By this time former player Chris Ford was the coach of the Celtics. 26-year old Reggie Lewis was seen as Bird's successor and became the new franchise player for the Celtics. In 1995, the Celtics moved from the Boston Garden into the Fleet Center (recently renamed the TD Banknorth Garden).\n\nLewis, a forward, fainted during a playoff matchup with the Charlotte Hornets. The Celtics honored his memory during the following season by retiring his number.\n\nFormer player M.L. Carr soon became the team's General Manager and drafted young players like Eric Montross and Eric Williams. After a somewhat disappointing season, the Celtics made the playoffs only to be eliminated in the first round by the Orlando Magic.The Celtics wallowed in mediocrity for the next few years and would fail to make the playoffs.\n\nCarr stepped aside to another job in the organization when the Celtics acquired Rick Pitino to serve as the team's President, Front Office Manager, and Head Coach. Pitino had led the University of Kentucky to an NCAA Championship and was a very successful head coach, with a short NBA stint with the New York Knicks several years prior. The Celtics, at 15-67, had the worst record in franchise history and the worst record in the NBA overall during the 1996-97 season, but they failed to win the NBA's Draft Lottery to determine who would receive the first pick in the NBA Draft (the San Antonio Spurs won the lottery, and selected Tim Duncan first overall in that year's draft). They drafted Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer and seemed ready to pair them with Antoine Walker, the second-year player out of Kentucky, who had a solid rookie season. The following year the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce, a college star who had been expected to be drafted much higher than the Celtics' number 10 pick overall. Other notable players Pitino acquired were Walter McCarty, Tony Delk, Eric Williams (re-acquired after leaving the team), and veteran Kenny Anderson.\n\nPitino failed to coach any successful teams and resigned in 2001, leaving the Celtics in the hands of assistant coach Jim O'Brien, a friend of Pitino's who subsequently took the reins as interim head coach. Paul Pierce matured into an NBA star and was complemented by Antoine Walker, along with the other young veteran players acquired over the years. The Celtics had three picks in the draft that year, but Wallace used them on players who did not work out in the long run (including Joe Johnson, who would have later success with the Phoenix Suns). In 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners LLC, led by H. Antoine Walker was the most notable player to go, being traded to the Mavericks (along with Tony Delk) during training camp. They were replaced by Ricky Davis, Jiri Welsch, Raef LaFrentz and others. The Celtics made the playoffs only to be swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers. Ainge received a lot of criticism for breaking up the previous team, but he was able to have a few successful drafts, including picks like Marcus Banks, Al Jefferson, Kendrick Perkins, Delonte West and others. During his second off-season, Ainge was able to unload some payroll when he acquired veterans Gary Payton and Rick Fox from the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers, yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by rookie Al Jefferson, with a selection of able veterans (Paul Pierce, Raef LaFrentz, and Ricky Davis). Before the trading deadline in the winter of 2005 the Celtics re-acquired Antoine Walker when they dealt Gary Payton to the Atlanta Hawks (Payton would re-sign with the team after being released from the Hawks a week later). Walker was traded to the Miami Heat in a multi-team sign-and-trade deal (the largest trade in NBA history) that brought the Celtics two players who would later be released and money. Ainge brought in a few more young players during the draft, including Gerald Green, Ryan Gomes, and Orien Greene.\n\nDuring the 2006 season, Ainge traded Davis, Blount, Banks, Justin Reed, and two conditional second-round draft picks to the Minnesota Timberwolves for forward Wally Szczerbiak, centers Michael Olowokandi and Dwayne Jones, and a first-round pick. The Celtics missed the 2006 playoffs with a 33-49 record.\n\nThe Boston Celtics contined to rebuild on the night of the 2006 NBA Draft. Danny Ainge traded the rights to the seventh overall pick Randy Foye, Dan Dickau and Raef LaFrentz to the Portland Trail Blazers in for Sebastian Telfair, Theo Ratliff, and a future second round pick. A subsequent trade with the Philadelphia 76ers for Allen Iverson was reported as a potential move beneficial to each team, although such a trade never eventuated.\n\nAs of 2006 the Celtics have never lost the seventh game of the NBA Finals.\n\nHistorical Rivalries\n\nThe Boston Celtics have had a longstanding rivalry, especially throughout the 80s, with the Los Angeles Lakers. At the height of the rivalry, the Lakers and Celtics would win 8 NBA Championships in the decade (The Lakers won 5 while the Celtics won 3), and would play each other in the NBA Finals 3 different times. The Celtics also have historical ties with the Philadelphia 76ers, who played with the Celtics in tense playoff series in the 60s and 80s.
