        "text": "OPELOUSAS- A Memorial Service will be held for Gerald Douglas “Doug” Green on Saturday, March 25, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. in the Hope Presbyterian Church in Opelousas. The service will be conducted by Pastor Dean Rydbeck and Pastor Perry Hubbs. Visitation will be held on Friday, March 24, 2023 from 12:00 noon until 8:00 p.m. in the Sibille Funeral Home of Opelousas. A private burial will take place at Bellevue Memorial Park.\n\nGerald Douglas “Doug” Green passed away at home at the age of 75.\n\nBorn in Buffalo, New York, he grew up in Williamsport where he attended school. He entered the Army out of high school and served in the 1st Air Cavalry Division. In Buffalo, he met and fell in love with his wife, Sharon Y. Brice. They were married on September 12, 1970 and would have celebrated 52 years of marriage last year. They moved to PIttsburgh, Pennsylvania where they lived for 10 years and then moved to Opelousas in 1980.\n\nHe worked for Petroleum Helicopters, Inc (PHI) for over 30 years before he retired. He was active in the community having served in various organizations in various ways, including Boy Scout Troop 165, St. Landry Cemetery Tours, First Baptist Church Opelousas, and with his wife on Relay for Life teams. He was also very involved in his son’s life, supporting him in Boy Scouts–pushing him to attain the Eagle Scout rank, sporting events, choral events (both singing and conducting), and ministerial events. He was a cancer survivor, a fighter, and a devout Christian. He loved music, taking up bagpiping in his 60s, spending time with his family, attending church, and spending time with his two grandchildren.\n\nHe is survived by his brother and sister-in-law, Dave and Ruth Green of Ashland Kentucky; his brother and sister-in-law Tim and Kathy Green of Quarreyville, PA; his brother and sister-in-law, Dan and Roberta Green of Williamsport, NY; his sister and brother-in-law Kathy and Phil South of Mount Vernon, WA; his son and daughter-in-law, James “Jamie” and Ashley Green of Pecaniere, Louisiana; and his two granddaughters, Elizabeth and Catherine Green; as well as many other friends and assorted family.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father, Gerald W. Green and his mother, Mary S. Green-Fromwiller, and his wife, Sharon Y. Green. Doug was beloved by those who knew him.\n\nHe will be greatly missed by all who knew him, but for those who know his faith and who share that faith, there is the assurance that the moment he stood before his Lord and Savior, he heard the words: “Well done, My good and faithful servant,” before running to be with his wife.\n\nPallbearers will be: Keith Hebert, Tommy Hebert, Jeff Vincent, Tommy Myrick, Don Fisher, and Don Stanford. Honorary Pallbearers will be: Jack Diehl, Keith Normand, Paul Schlette, and Keith Fontenot.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to The Wounded Warrior Project.\n\nWords of Comfort for the family may be expressed at www.sibillefuneralhomes.com. Funeral arrangements have been entrusted to Sibille Funeral Home of Opelousas."
