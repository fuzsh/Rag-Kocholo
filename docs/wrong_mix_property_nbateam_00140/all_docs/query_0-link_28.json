        "text": "CHICAGO -- Over the past few days, Boston Celtics head coach Brad Stevens told his team to relax. He wanted his players to box out, of course, and he wanted them to stay poised during Chicago Bulls runs. But he also sensed the Celtics needed to regain some positive energy.\n\nIt has been tough to smile over the past week. Isaiah Thomas' younger sister passed away Saturday morning and the death shook everyone. He was devastated, naturally. The Celtics wanted to support him however possible, but sometimes there's not a lot anybody can do. Even in the playoffs, basketball seemed like an afterthought. The Celtics were blasted twice by the Bulls and barely resembled the team that won 53 regular-season games.\n\nWith a two-game deficit, the Celtics could have tightened up Friday night before Game 3. Instead, they urged each other to tell jokes, according to Terry Rozier, and gathered around a Beats Pill to listen to a motivational speech from Kevin Garnett. The retired legend had sent a voice recording to team trainer Ed Lacerte; after Lacerte passed it on to Avery Bradley, Bradley showed it to Thomas, who decided the whole team needed to hear Garnett's words.\n\nAnybody who has spent time around Garnett could have guessed three things about that tape:\n\n1. It included a load of four-letter words.\n\n2. It fueled the Celtics like nobody else could have.\n\n3. In the words of Jae Crowder, \"He shouted out a lot of people at the end of it.\"\n\n\"We played it very loud in here,\" said Crowder. \"With him talking loud, you can only imagine how it got us pumped up.\"\n\nThe Celtics didn't break out a batch of knuckle push-ups to thank Garnett, but surged ahead of the Bulls with an early stream of 3-pointers, stayed strong when a big lead disappeared, and downed the Bulls, 104-87, after remaining connected throughout the most important second half of the season.\n\nHow quickly can a series swing? At the beginning of Friday, the Bulls held control of the series after two thorough wins. By the end of the morning, they had announced Rajon Rondo will be out indefinitely with a broken right thumb. Then Stevens called for a radical lineup change, the Celtics drilled 17 3-pointers and Rondo's replacements were no good. Now it's Chicago answering questions about the need to adjust while Boston sounds hungry for more.\n\n\"We weren't coming here hoping to get a win,\" Bradley said. \"We knew we were coming here to win both games.\"\n\nEven in the crazy NBA playoffs, a series rarely packs so much into one day.\n\nGreen starting\n\nLittle could have upstaged the Rondo news, but Stevens tried his hardest with a stunning lineup change: Gerald Green for Amir Johnson. Green has been in and out of the rotation all season. He only played six total minutes over the first two games. He was the last player anybody would have expected as a major mid-series adjustment.\n\nEven Al Horford said, \"That was a big risk coming into the game.\"\n\nThe Bulls were just as shocked by the move as anybody else, but it worked. Over 15 minutes, the new Celtics starters knocked down seven 3-pointers and outscored the Bulls 36-23. Green had some rough defensive moments on Dwyane Wade, but scored eight points and helped Boston stretch Chicago to the breaking point. It was like Stevens decided, \"You know what? If they're going to be more physical no matter what we try, we might as well respond with as much speed and shooting as possible to take advantage of their size.\"\n\nIn the new Boston rotation, Crowder didn't play anything but power forward. Amir Johnson only spent six minutes on the court. Jonas Jerebko and Kelly Olynyk, two plus shooters, served as the bench bigs in a key second-half run. Terry Rozier has become a key piece again. Even when Thomas hit the bench, the Celtics were able to score. When he stepped on the court, all the spacing helped him hook up with Al Horford in the pick-and-roll for several easy buckets. Thomas didn't shoot well, didn't earn a single free throw attempt, and still cut up the Bulls during a pivotal third-quarter run.\n\nMore importantly, Thomas could be seen smiling. This has been the worst week of his life, but he appeared to be in better spirits after flying to Washington state to visit with his family between Games 2 and 3.\n\n\"I think he's feeling better,\" Stevens said. \"It's been a really hard week. He's going to have his ups and downs. I think going to Seattle was a good thing. But it was hard. Again, seeing his dad and being around his family and that support network was important. So, again, I say he's feeling better, obviously there's an asterisk next to that. There's going to be always ups and downs, it's still inside a week. But I'm glad that he went. He's glad that he went.\"\n\n\"Definitely proud of him,\" added Horford, \"the way he's been able to handle everything and the way he got it together and put (on) a great performance tonight.\"\n\nThe shift\n\nIn what Horford called a must-win game, the Celtics got huge games from him (18 points, eight rebounds, six assists and four steals) and Bradley (\"I couldn't take him out of the game,\" said Stevens) plus a locked-in team defensive effort. They still got beaten on the glass but kept Robin Lopez from dominating inside, limited Butler to mostly jump shot attempts (he finished with 14 points on 7-for-21 shooting) and forced 18 turnovers.\n\nThe Celtics still have a hole to climb out of but now it will be the Bulls scrambling for solutions. Rondo's injury came at a cruel time for him because he had been playing his best basketball in years, and for the Bulls because they have no obvious answers without him. Head coach Fred Hoiberg tried Jerian Grant and Michael Carter-Williams as replacements but both were ineffective and turnover-prone. It could be time soon for Butler to slide over to point guard, but the Bulls know one man can only handle so many responsibilities at a high level.\n\nThey might not admit it, but they also know how much this series twisted in one hectic day. Nobody's calling the series for the Celtics yet, but they were more vibrant Friday, more like themselves. From Thomas' bright smiles to the way the ball whipped around the perimeter to the open man, Stevens' team found its spirit again. Rondo could miss the rest of the series and everything has shifted now."
