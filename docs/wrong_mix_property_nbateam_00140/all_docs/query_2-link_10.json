He was welcomed to the family by his brother, Norman, and sister, Marjorie Anne. He had a love for the outside and especially spending time with his horse. He was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of 10, but that didn’t slow him down as he continued a full active life. He earned a BS degree in Ag Econ and a Master’s Degree in Entomology at Kansas State University. His PhD is from Oregon State University in Entomology and post graduate work at the University of Kentucky.\n\nHe married Phyllis A. Rutledge on June 5, 1960.

The family moved back to KSU Garden City Experiment Station where he was head of the station and later did research. He was recognized for over 20 years of dedicated service to Kansas State University. He published over 100 scientific papers related to crop and livestock pest management.\n\nHe cherished time with family and enjoyed traveling, gardening, building, and woodworking.
