        "text": "Greene was a national serviceman who served in Vietnam from 27 August 1969 until 8 September 1969 as a Sapper with the 17th Construction Squadron and thereafter with the 1st Field Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers. On 8 December 1969 Greene was travelling in an armoured personnel carrier as a member of a mine clearing team attached to 6RAR when their vehicle ran over a mine near the deserted village of Thua Tich in Phuoc Tuy Province, South Vietnam. Greene was killed in the blast. His body was returned to Australia and a funeral service held at the Anzac Chapel at Duntroon before his interment in the ex-services section of Woden Cemetery."
