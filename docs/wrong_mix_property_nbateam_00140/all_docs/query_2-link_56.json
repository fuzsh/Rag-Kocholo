        "text": "Rachel Juanita Cooper Thompson, age 85, of Marysville, became a flower in God’s beautiful garden on Saturday, July 13, 2024. The oldest child of the late Howard Vernon Cooper and Betty Jo Ross Cooper Huffman, Rachel was born on September 28, 1938 in Xenia, Ohio- a Wednesday afternoon at half past noon.\n\nBorn during hard times, she was just five years old when the Great Depression ended. She was the first of four children, and over the next 13 years, she was joined by her siblings, Lanny Lee, Rebecca Sue and Melissa Marlene.\n\nUltimately her parents divorced and when her mother married the late Ross Leroy Huffman in 1956, three more siblings joined the family, Carol, Larry and Donny.\n\nAlso in 1956, Rachel married the late Gerald Woodrow “Gary” Thompson and together they had four children, Kimberly Rae, Gayle Denise, Jodi Marie and Douglas Woodrow.\n\nIn November 1959, Rachel’s youngest brother, Arthur Ross “Buddy” Huffman was born.\n\nFor a number of years, during summer months, Buddy would come to Marysville and become like her “fifth child.”\n\nHer education began in a one-room schoolhouse in rural Greene County, Ohio. She graduated from Xenia High School in 1956. She showed sheep as a member of Greene County 4-H Club and one of her fondest memories as a young girl was attending 4-H Camp. In later years, Rachel was absolutely delighted when she heard that her great-grandchildren were able to attend the exact same camp, Camp Clifton.\n\nWhen interviewed by her great-grandson, Ethan, regarding the most drastic change she had seen in her lifetime, Rachel recalled living during a time of segregation. The separation of races was so common back then in Xenia, it wasn’t even given a thought. The races were simply disconnected, even though she didn’t understand why.\n\nAs a teenager, her first real job besides watching her brother and sisters, was as a car hop on roller-skates at a drive-in diner.\n\nThroughout her lifetime, Rachel worked various jobs outside the home which included being a clerk at the Montgomery Ward Catalog Center in Xenia and the Sears Catalog Center in Marysville. She also was a cafeteria cook at Marysville Schools and finally, spent the remainder of her working years in the “big house” – The Ohio Reformatory for Women, where she worked as a guard and then as a clerk in the commissary. She ended her career there in the mailroom.\n\nRachel was known by many names- daughter, sister, cousin, aunt, wife, mother, grandma, great-grandma, Nannie, Grandma Spice, Grandma Rahal, Rach, Officer Thompson, Crazy Cat Lady and Old Lady. Ultimately, she was known as a survivor. Beginning with knee replacement surgery, she was a two-time breast cancer survivor and in 2021, underwent surgery for a massive subdural hematoma.\n\nRachel was often the recipient of the kindness of strangers. Frequently she was surprised at a drive-thru window to learn that her order had already been paid for. Unfortunately, she usually only took enough money to pay for what she was going to buy. For that reason, in lieu of flowers, we ask that you do a good deed in mom’s honor. Surprise somebody and pay for their order, smile at a stranger, open a door for someone, give someone a compliment- JUST BE KIND AND PAY IT FORWARD. Donations may be made to Viaquest Hospice in Marysville, who were absolutely fabulous helping Rachel find comfort in her final days.\n\nIn addition to her parents, Rachel was also preceded in death by her infant granddaughter, Carly Denise Thompson and recently a grandson, Justin Ross Jeffrey; and her brothers, Lanny Lee Cooper, Larry Huffman and Donny Huffman; and her sister, Carol Wilburn.\n\nRachel is survived by her children, Kimberly (Roy) Asbury, Jr., Gayle (Dana) Williams, Jodi Thompson and Douglas Thompson; her grandchildren, Chad (Melissa) Clarridge, Andrew (Heather) Clarridge, Jamie Jeffrey, Joby Jeffrey, Johnny (Marcy) Cheek, Amy (Jimmy Jones) Cheek and Paige Thompson; her great-grandchildren, Cole and Kate Clarridge, Ethan and Whitney Clarridge, Naomi Nickelson, and Riley, Reece and Ryan Jones; a sister-in-law, Greta Ruth Thompson of Kentucky; and her special kitty and longtime feline companion, “Ollie.”\n\nThe family will hold visiting hours beginning 11 a.m. Thursday, July 18, 2024 at Underwood Funeral Home where funeral services will be held at 1 p.m. Following the service, a procession will form and proceed to Oakdale Cemetery. Family and friends are invited to gather for food and fellowship following the services at the home of Roy and Kim."
