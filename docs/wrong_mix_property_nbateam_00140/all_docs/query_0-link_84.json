        "text": "Although Darryl Dawkins was a behemoth who could hold his own in the NBA, his career didn't pan out as everyone envisioned. He was more of an entertainer with his rim-rocking dunks but failed to maximize his 6-foot-11 frame and have an even more productive NBA career.\n\nAnother great center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, made a critical observation of Dawkins. Aware of his build and likening him to Shaquille O'Neal, the Los Angeles Lakers legend feels 'Dr. Dunkenstein just failed to realize his potential and put it to good use.\n\n\"Darryl spent so much time being a clown and not focusing on the finer aspects of the game. Darryl was just incredibly and physically gifted like Shaq. But he didn't understand his potential and use it the right way. That is something that Kobe would never do.\"\n\nTough loss after Dawkins wife committed suicide\n\n\"Sweet D\" had a tough 1986-87 season with the Nets. He suited up in only 6 games, primarily because of injuries plaguing his performance. But aside from that, there was the tragic death of his partner, Kelly Barnes. Things got rocky and the couple had planned to divorce. Unfortunately, Barnes committed suicide on November 1, 1987, something that put Darryl in a dark place.\n\n\" I fear probably nothing but death, and I couldn't figure out how somebody could kill herself,\" Dawkins said via the New York Times . \"I spent a lot of my time with my pastor. He counseled me, and he told me I had to go back and play basketball because that would occupy my mind,\" he added.\n\nOverlooking his potential\n\nLooking at his game, there was no doubt that Dawkins could score. Since entering the league in 1975, Darryl has averaged 12.0 points in his NBA career.\n\nBut for someone his size, rebounding was one department where the Florida native failed to capitalize. \"Chocolate Thunder\" averaged just 6.1 rebounds in 726 regular-season games. Dawk could have done better if only he had taken his game to another level.\n\nAfter spending 7 seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers , Dawkins also had stints with the New Jersey Nets, Utah Jazz, and the Detroit Pistons. His game began to decline in the 1986-87 season, his last year with the Nets.\n\nAlthough there were two teams interested in him, Dawkins would decide to take his act to Italy in 1989. He would find new life in Europe where he got better pay and lesser taxes to settle. But above all, he was pretty comfortable and knew how to dominate his European counterparts.\n\n\" He's the best center in Europe,\" his coach, Mike d'Antoni, quipped. \"He's still the fastest player on our team.\"\n\nAfter stints with Auxilium Torino, Olimpia Milano, and Telemarket Forli, Dawkins would end up being part of the Harlem Globe Trotters. He also tried to get back into the NBA in 1994 with the Denver Nuggets and the Boston Celtics in 1995 but failed. He would try his luck in the Continental Basketball Association instead and eventually called it a career in 2000."
