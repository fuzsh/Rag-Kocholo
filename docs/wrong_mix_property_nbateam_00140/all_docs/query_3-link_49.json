        "text": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Saturday afternoon’s attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally is only the latest example of the dangers faced by public officials candidates for high-profile offices.\n\nAfter the shooting, Trump said on social media he was shot in the right ear. The 45th president was quickly pulled away by Secret Service agents and his campaign said he was “fine.”\n\nA local prosecutor said the suspected gunman and at least one attendee are dead. The Secret Service said two spectators were critically injured.\n\nAccording to a Reuters investigation, political violence is at its worst in the United States since the 1970s.\n\nSince the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, the news organization identified 213 cases on political violence nationwide. Of the 76 cases involving individual acts of violence, 18 deaths have resulted. Those statistics are only from 2023.\n\nAccording to the non-profit Protect Democracy, at least 73 elected officials were threatened in March 2024 alone.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was the first U.S. president to be assassinated while in office. Only days after Union General Ulysses Grant accepted the Army of Virginia’s General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia, Lincoln was shot at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C., by John Wilkes Booth on April 15, 1865.\n\nJames Garfield was the nation’s 20th president from March 1881 until his death on September 19, 1881. Garfield, a minister, lawyer and Civil War general, was shot on July 2, 1881, by Charles Guiteau; Garfield was shot at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington. The wound was not immediately fatal, but an infection afterward resulted in Garfield’s death.\n\nThe 25th American president, William McKinley served from March 4, 1897, until his death in September 1901. McKinley was only a few months into his second term when he was shot in Buffalo, N.Y., at the Pan-American Exposition. He died eight days later.\n\nMcKinley’s death led to Vice President Theodore Roosevelt’s ascendancy to the nation’s highest office. Roosevelt completed McKinley’s term, then ran successfully on his own in 1904. After his presidency, Roosevelt ran for the White House again in 1912, and during a campaign appearance in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Oct. 14, 1912, Roosevelt was shot in front of the Gilpatrick Hotel by John Schrank.\n\nThe bullet lodged in Roosevelt’s chest chest after penetrating his steel eyeglass case and passing through a 50-page single-folded copy of his scheduled speech that night. Schrank was disarmed and captured by Roosevelt’s stenographer, Elbert E. Martin as he attempted to fire a second time.\n\nAn experienced hunter and with a lifetime of experience with firearms, Roosevelt deduced he had been shot but refused to accept medical attention. He then delivered his 90-minute speech in his blood-soaked shirt, and only afterward accepted medical care.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in an open motorcade in Dallas, Texas, on Nov. 22, 1961, officially by Lee Harvey Oswald. But conspiracy theories exist today.\n\nKennedy’s brother, Robert F. Kennedy, died after being shot by Sirhan Sirhan on June 6, 1968, in Los Angeles after winning the 1968 California Democratic primary. Kennedy was seeking that year’s Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nAlabama Gov. George Wallace has sought the presidency in 1964 by challenging John Kennedy’s vice president and Oval Office successor, Lyndon Johnson as a Democrat. In 1968, Wallace ran an unsuccessful independent candidacy. He ran again as a Democrat in the 1972 primaries, but was shot in Maryland on May 15 by Arthur Bremer. Wallace remained paralyzed below the waist for the rest of his life.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford was the target of an assassination attempt on Sept. 5, 1975, by a member of the Charles Manson cult, Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme, in Sacramento, California. Fromme was standing a little more than an arm’s length from Ford in the public grounds of the California State Capitol and pointed a handgun at Ford, but the gun did not discharge.\n\nOn March 30, 1981, President Ronald Reagan was leaving the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C., where he had been talking to 5,000 members of the AFL-CIO when several shots were fired. John Hinckley, Jr., fired his .22 caliber revolver with “devastator” bullets at the President and his security team. Reagan was wounded when one of the bullets ricocheted off of the limousine, striking him under the left armpit.\n\nPress Secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy, and policeman Thomas Delahanty were also wounded during the shooting. Reagan’s wounds were not noticed until he began to cough up blood. He was then taken to the George Washington University Hospital. After 12 days in the hospital, Reagan returned to the White House.\n\nAtlanta News First and Atlanta News First+ provide you with the latest news, headlines and insights as Georgia continues its role at the forefront of the nation’s political scene.
