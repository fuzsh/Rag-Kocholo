        "text": "LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - Family members of one of the teens shot to death in Westlake in July 2020 are calling for justice.\n\nThe father and sister of Kyla Hidalgo are disappointed in the progress getting the case to trial.\n\n17-year-old Kyla and her 18-year-old boyfriend Kaleb Charlton were shot to death at a home in Westlake on July 15, 2020. Kyla’s dad, Frank, and her sister Kharie enjoy looking at pictures and sharing memories from before the killings.\n\n“She made everybody happy, she tried to make everybody smile,” said Frank. “She was a good person. She tried to be cheerful all the time.”\n\n“She was very energetic. I remember that she wanted to go to LSU. She didn’t get the chance to,” said Kharie.\n\nThey both said the past four years have been rough.\n\n“A father should never have to bury a daughter. It should be the other way.”\n\n“It feels kind of weird to say, ‘I used to have a sister.’ But reality, she’s still here with us, just by heart.”\n\nNeil Patrick Broussard and his wife Tori were arrested soon after the murders, but the Hidalgos feel justice is moving too slowly.\n\n“It makes me wonder what’s going on. Are the people responsible going to be held responsible? Or is there something else they’re trying to protect.”\n\nAnd they are upset Tori Broussard has been allowed to bond out of jail, even though her attorney said she should be free. She was the former chief investigator for the Public Defenders Office and is suspected of helping her husband evade authorities.\n\n“She doesn’t have an ankle monitor, but she’s monitored by phone. That’s what I was told, that she was monitored by phone. Anybody can put a phone down and walk away from it and be somewhere else.”\n\nKharie was in the house during the shootings and was only 14 years old at the time. She was kidnapped and driven to Beauregard Parish.\n\nShe said Neil Broussard sexually assaulted her and wants people to know.\n\n“People need to know what he has done. Instead of being like, ‘Oh, he probably didn’t do anything to her’. He did do something. And the world has to know what he’s done, to know that he’s a bad guy,” said Kharie.\n\nKhari, now 18, said she was released into the woods and located by deputies. The family has started a memory wall to keep Kyla close. They want justice for her, but would welcome any closure that might ease their aching hearts.\n\nTori Broussard’s defense attorney Todd Clemons said, “Tori deserves to be free. She is presumed innocent per the U.S. Constitution. She is eager for trial by a jury of her peers so that she can get this false accusation behind her.”\n\nOfficials at the D.A.’s office say they are waiting for appeal court rulings and will then set pretrial hearing dates."
