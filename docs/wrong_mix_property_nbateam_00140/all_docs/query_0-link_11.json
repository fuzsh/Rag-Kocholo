        "text": "CHICAGO -- The Boston Celtics know Isaiah Thomas' pain won't disappear, but have been lifted by the star's good spirits over the last couple of days.\n\nThomas flew to Washington state to visit with his family after Game 2 of a first-round series with the Chicago Bulls and seemed a little more lighthearted upon his return. After his younger sister, Chyna, passed away in a car accident last weekend, the star guard has called this past week the hardest of his life.\n\n\"Everybody knows what type of few weeks it's been for him, or week it's been for him,\" close friend and teammate Gerald Green said after practice Saturday. \"But it was good to see him in good spirits. And it changed the atmosphere of the locker room.\n\n\"As a leader I think he understood that. But I think everybody at the end of the day had his back regardless of what or how he was feeling. So I was glad to see him up and live and cheering guys on.\"\n\nAfter dropping the first two games of the series, the Celtics responded by taking Game 3, 104-87.\n\n\"I've said it before, this is a tough week,\" Stevens said. \"And it was good to see our guys feel good about themselves because I thought they certainly deserved to feel good about themselves and it was good to play a little bit better.\"\n\nAdded Avery Bradley: \"I've said this a few times. I know it's tough on our team but it's more tough on Isaiah. It's our job to make sure we were prepared and able to play hard for him and that's what we want to continue to try to do. I know it's still hard for him now so we have to make sure we're there for him and giving him energy.\""
