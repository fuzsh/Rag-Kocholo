        "text": "DALLAS — Though all the Celtics veterans are available when a younger player needs advice, there’s another, older newcomer who has more in common with those trying to earn more minutes.\n\nGerald Green has been there, as they all know, trying to get Doc Rivers’ attention as a Celtics rookie in 2005-06, and inviting as much doubt as encouragement from the former Celtics coach. Green knows the difficulty of earning time, even if the Celtics were a 24-win team back then.\n\nSo Green’s heart goes out to players like rookie Jaylen Brown, second-year guard Terry Rozier, and James Young, who has spent huge chunks of his career languishing in the corner.\n\nThen comes a night like Saturday’s win in Salt Lake City, when Marcus Smart went down with a cramp in the second quarter. Young came in, missed his first two shots, and, true to the advice of Green and the coaches, kept shooting. He hit a pair of big 3-pointers down the stretch on his way to 10 much-needed points. He also took a few turns guarding Utah’s Gordon Hayward down the stretch, and showed why the Celtics coaches say Young’s greatest improvement may be in the defensive end.\n\nThe 30-year-old Green — who scored 16 points in an elevated role in the absence of Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder — once again sounded like a very wise man.\n\n“I’ve talked to (Green) a lot, and heard him talk about the little things, and the opportunities and how my time is going to come,” said Young. “That’s all I can do.”\n\nAnd Green, as it turns out, relishes this role as the well-traveled, world-weary veteran.\n\n“I have accepted that role,” said Green. “I know James is a kid who reminds me of myself early in my career, trying to figure out a way to step on the floor, playing behind good players. The difference between him and me is I wasn’t on a team that was very good. He’s on a team that’s really good.\n\n“I tell him to stay ready, keep doing the things you need to do, keep preparing yourself as if you’re going to play every day, and one of these moments we’re going to need you to win a game. And this was that moment for him. He came in the second half — that’s tough, I know. But he came in, and to guard the way he was guarding and knocking shots down, he’s one of the reasons we won.”\n\nOverall, though, Green is impressed by everyone in the Celtics locker room, for a very specific reason.\n\n“This group is resilient, man. A lot of times we just don’t give up,” he said. “A lot of times we ease up, but we don’t give up. We just keep going, fighting. Someone in this locker room is always trying to figure out a way to get better — even the coaching staff. I’ve been on teams in Indiana and Miami that were pretty good too, but as far as trying to get better, this team is the same. We still have a long way to go, but I love the mentality we have.”\n\nSort of like the mentality Green has brought back to his original NBA team. Once on the floor, he fires away. He’s not Vinnie Johnson, but he has some of the same wiring.\n\n“Man, I don’t know,” Green said of how he’s able to come into a game cold and immediately start hitting shots. “Just have to prepare yourself that you’re going to play. Some games you might not play and some games I might get in a little bit. Before the game you have to treat yourself like you’re going to play a lot — just treat yourself to the same routine.”"
