        "text": "© USA TODAY Sports\n\nWith training camps just days away from officially opening, the time to recap the NFL offseason that was is here. Spotrac takes a look at current financial figures, notable free agent additions & subtractions, contract extensions, trades & future thoughts for each NFL franchise from the 2024 league year to date.\n\nJump to a team...\n\nAFC EAST: BUF | MIA | NE | NYJ\n\nAFC NORTH: BAL | CIN | CLE | PIT\n\nAFC SOUTH: HOU | IND | JAX | TEN\n\nAFC WEST: DEN | KC | LAC | LV\n\nNFC EAST: DAL | NYG | PHI | WAS\n\nNFC NORTH: CHI | DET | GB | MIN\n\nNFC SOUTH: ATL | CAR | NO | TB\n\nNFC WEST: ARI | LAR | SEA | SF\n\nArizona Cardinals\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $34M (5th)\n\nTotal Cap: $270M (23rd)\n\nDead Cap: $21.6M (20th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nJustin Jones (DT, 27): Left the Bears on a 3 year, $31M contract that includes fully guaranteed salary in all 3 seasons. He projects to be a starter on the DL.\n\nBilal Nichols (DT, 27): Left the Raiders on a 3 year, $21M contract that includes $12M fully guaranteed through 2025. He projects to be a starter on the DL.\n\nJonah Williams (OT, 26): Left the Bengals on a 2 year, $30M contract that includes $19M fully guaranteed through 2025. He projects to be the starting RT.\n\nSean Bunting (CB, 27): Left the Titans on a 3 year, $25.5M contract that includes $14.1M fully guaranteed through 2025. He projects to be the starting LCB.\n\nMack Wilson (OLB, 26): Left the Patriots on a 3 year, $12.75M contract that includes $6.4M through 2025. He projects to be the starting WLB.\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nNotable Free Agent Losses\n\nMarquise Brown (WR, 27): Joined the Chiefs on a 1 year, $7M contract ($6.5M guaranteed).\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nNotable Extensions\n\nNone.\n\nNotable Trades\n\nAcquired Desmond Ridder (QB) from the Falcons in exchange for Rondale Moore (WR).\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nThe Cardinals enter 2024 with just 3 cap figures north of $10M (Kyler Murray, $49M, Budda Baker, $19M, Jalen Thompson, $12M). #4 overall selection Marvin Harrison Jr. is one of the most anticipated team adds of the entire NFL offseason. Last year’s LT D.J. Humphries was designated a Post 6/1 release, leaving behind a $7M dead cap hit each of this and next season.\n\nAtlanta Falcons\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $3.1M (31st)\n\nTotal Cap: $290M (4th)\n\nDead Cap: $6.1M (30th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nKirk Cousins (QB, 35): Left the Vikings on a 4 year, $180M contract that includes $100M guaranteed through 2026. He projects to be the Week 1 starting QB.\n\nDarnell Mooney (WR, 26): Left the Bears on a 3 year, $39M contract that includes $26M guaranteed through 2025.

Across the roster, CB A.J. Terrell & TE Kyle Pitts are already extension eligible, while WR Drake London will become so after the upcoming campaign. It feels like a make or break season for a LOT of people attached to this organization.\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $6.3M (28th)\n\nTotal Cap: $278M (13th)\n\nDead Cap: $14.8M (26th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nDerrick Henry (RB, 30): Left the Titans on a 2 year, $16M contract that includes $9M fully guaranteed through 2024.

The new deal includes $4.5M fully guaranteed.\n\nNelson Agholor (WR, 31): Signed a 1 year, $3.75M fully guaranteed extension.\n\nNotable Trades\n\nSent Morgan Moses (OT, 33) to the Jets with a 4th round pick for a 4th & 6th round pick.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nThe free agent signing of RB Derrick Henry carries the headline into training camp, though a massive extension for DL Justin Madubuike certainly set a tone. Post-2024 futures for OT Ronnie Stanley, CB Marlon Humphrey, & even TE Mark Andrews could very much be in question, so the upcoming season could feel like a bit of a last ride in certain cases, especially when we include $275M+ of cap allocated to the 2025 roster already.\n\nBuffalo Bills\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $7.5M (26th)\n\nTotal Cap: $281M (9th)\n\nDead Cap: $61.2M (2nd)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nCurtis Samuel (WR, 27): Left the Commanders on a 3 year, $24M contract that includes $13.1M fully guaranteed.

For the most part, each yang received a corresponding ying via free agency & the draft to follow, but there’s no question that a very different Buffalo Bills team will hit the field in a few months. One unmentioned notable from above: OLB Von Miller took a near $9M pay cut to remain with the organization this season.\n\nCarolina Panthers\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $5.6M (30th)\n\nTotal Cap: $288M (5th)\n\nDead Cap: $46M (9th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nRobert Hunt (G, 27): Left the Dolphins on a 5 year, $100M contract that includes $63M practically guaranteed through 2026.

Johnson brings a 1 year, $10M contract with him.\n\nSent Brian Burns (ED, 26) & Tyrone Tracy (RB, 24) to the Giants for a 2nd round pick and two 5th round picks.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nThe Panthers are taking another stab at buying a better ball club in 2024, pumping out a league-high $260M worth of free agent contracts this past spring. There’s a world where more than a dozen players added via free agency, trades, or the draft this offseason become new starters for the Panthers in 2024. Carolina has the 6th most overall salary cap allocated this season, but are middle of the pack in 2025 as currently constructed.\n\nChicago Bears\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $21.6M (14th)\n\nTotal Cap: $270M (24th)\n\nDead Cap: $13M (27th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nD'Andre Swift (RB, 25): Left the Eagles on a 3 year, $24M contract that includes $15M practically guaranteed through 2025.

Allen brings a 1 year, $23.1M contract with him to Chicago.\n\nAcquired Ryan Bates (G, 27) from the Bills for a 5th round pick. Bates brings a 2 year, $8M contract with him to Chicago.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nBig Draft. Notable Trades. Plenty of Juice. The Bears added 3 key offensive weapons (Swift, Allen, Odunze) to go with their new QB1 but also didn’t go “all the way in” this offseason (14th most cap space still entering camp). Any sign of life in 2024 could mean for a massive 2025 offseason however (projected $74M of cap space).\n\nCincinnati Bengals\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $23.3M (13th)\n\nTotal Cap: $271M (21st)\n\nDead Cap: $6.5M (29th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nSheldon Rankins (DT, 30): Left the Texans on a 2 year, $24.5M contract that includes $8M fully guaranteed.

This should mean a massive contract extension for Ja’Marr Chase is in the works (but not necessarily imminent). Cincy made a few calculated offseason additions, but for the most part - remained fairly conservative.\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $12.7M (20th)\n\nTotal Cap: $311M (1st)\n\nDead Cap: $15.7M (25th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nZa'Darius Smith (ED, 31): Rejoins Cleveland on a 2 year, $23M contract that includes $12M fully guaranteed through 2024.

He's now the 5th highest average paid kicker in football.\n\nNotable Trades\n\nAcquired Jerry Jeudy (WR, 25) from the Broncos for a 5th & 6th round pick. Jeudy would extend out to a 4 year $65M contract a week later.\n\nSent Leroy Watson (TE, 26) to the Titans for a 7th round pick.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nFor the most part, the 2024 offseason was about retainment for this Browns organization. The addition of Jerry Jeudy to the receiving core offers depth for today, and a possible replacement for Amari Cooper, who enters 2024 on an expiring contract. Cleveland boasts a league-high $311M of cap allocated to their roster right now.\n\nDallas Cowboys\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $10M (23rd)\n\nTotal Cap: $280M (10th)\n\nDead Cap: $21M (23rd)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nEric Kendricks (LB, 32): Left the Chargers on a 1 year, $3M contract that includes $2.5M guaranteed.

That won’t help the situation surrounding expiring contracts for QB Dak Prescott, WR CeeDee Lamb, & G Zack Martin. Is it one last ride for this Cowboys collective as we know it?\n\nDenver Broncos\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $6.4M (27th)\n\nTotal Cap: $285M (7th)\n\nDead Cap: $67.6M (1st)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nBrandon Jones (S, 26): Leaves the Dolphins on a 3 year, $20M contract that includes $11M fully guaranteed through 2025.

The Jets agreed to retain $2.7M of Wilson’s 2024 salary, leaving Denver with a 1 year, $2.7M (guaranteed) contract.\n\nAcquired John Franklin-Myers (DE, 27) from the Jets for a 6th round pick. Franklin-Myers signed a 2 year $15M renegotiation upon his arrival.\n\nSent Jerry Jeudy (WR, 25) to the Browns for a 5th & 6th round pick.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nImpossible to say anything about the Broncos’ offseason without referencing the Post 6/1 release of QB Russell Wilson. The move leaves behind $53M of dead cap in 2024, which is the 3rd largest cap hit in any capacity right now for the upcoming season (Watson, $63M, Prescott, $55M). Denver ripped off a lot of band-aids this spring, but still show signs of life on paper - for now.\n\nDetroit Lions\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $38.4M (2nd)\n\nTotal Cap: $251M (32nd)\n\nDead Cap: $25.2M (16th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nD.J.

Davis signed a 1 year, $14.5M restructured contract that includes $12.7M guaranteed through 2024.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nDespite four major contract extensions hitting the books this spring, the Lions enter camp with the 2nd most Top 51 cap space in the league, and the least amount of total cap allocations. They’ve constructed themselves to make a multi-year contention run, and are set up to be aggressive next March should the roster require it.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $26.8M (7th)\n\nTotal Cap: $272M (20th)\n\nDead Cap: $50.1M (7th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nXavier McKinney (S, 24): Leaves the Giants on a 4 year, $67M contract that includes $23M fully guaranteed through 2024.

The Packers smell blood in the water both divisionally and across the NFC, and added impact players with hopes of pushing into serious contention. Look for some of that ample cap space ($27M) to be utilized in a massive extension for QB Jordan Love in the coming weeks.\n\nHouston Texans\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $16.8M (16th)\n\nTotal Cap: $277M (15th)\n\nDead Cap: $23.8M (19th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nDanielle Hunter (ED, 29): Leaves the Vikings on a 2 year, $49M contract that includes $48M fully guaranteed.

Realizing your 2nd-year QB may be a generational talent can make a front office do crazy things, and the Texans took the guardrails off this offseason in hopes of building an immediate AFC contender. Acquiring 3 offensive weapons via trade, and bolstering the defensive line with major free agent contracts is a pretty great start. Houston will need to get creative next offseason from a cap perspective, as they currently boast 10 cap hits north of $10M in 2025.\n\nIndianapolis Colts\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $24.5M (11th)\n\nTotal Cap: $269M (25th)\n\nDead Cap: $8.4M (28th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nGrover Stewart (DT, 30): Rejoins the Colts on a 3 year, $39M contract that includes $18M fully guaranteed.

Locking in their WR1 (with value) & retaining their defensive line certainly helps their cause for the upcoming season.

Adding Wilkins to the D-Line will help, but this roster doesn’t seem complete enough to be consistently successful. This could be very active trade deadline team.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $20M (15th)\n\nTotal Cap: $275M (19th)\n\nDead Cap: $54M (5th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nWill Dissly (TE, 28): Leaves the Seahawks on a 3 year, $14M contract that includes $10M guaranteed through 2025.

This is a middle of the road team financially speaking, but it seems like the pendulum could swing either way after 2024.

They prioritized edge defense at the top of their draft, fortified the interior of their offensive line in free agency, and added a few depth weapons for QB Matthew Stafford, who could be in line for a renegotiated extension of his own this summer.\n\nMiami Dolphins\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $15M (18th)\n\nTotal Cap: $275M (18th)\n\nDead Cap: $29M (13nd)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nJordyn Brooks (LB, 26): Leaves the Seahawks on a 3 year, $26.25M contract that includes $9.5M guaranteed through 2024.

But a deep roster can afford to take on subtractions for the greater good of the business when needed. So far that business has led to a sizable extension for WR1B Jaylen Waddle. Will it come to full fruition with an extension for QB Tua Tagovailoa this summer as well?

Has it torpedoed their ability to contend in the NFC North? Vegas certainly thinks so (+1000 to win the division, +300 to make the playoffs). With that said, three notable defensive additions (Greenard, Cashman, Van Ginkel) plus multi-year guarantees for Jefferson, Addison, & Hockenson seem to be a strong framework to quickly rebuild from. Look for a big-boy extension for OT Christian Darrisaw this summer.\n\nNew England Patriots\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $41M (1st)\n\nTotal Cap: $258M (31st)\n\nDead Cap: $21M (22nd)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nMike Onwenu (OL, 26): Rejoins the Patriots on a 3 year, $57M contract that includes $36.5M guaranteed through 2025.

New England’s two biggest free agent deals went to players they ended up retaining (Onwenu/Bourne), and the Patriots handed out $200M total to new contracts for Barmore, Dugger, & Stevenson this spring. Obviously there’s a core here that the front office is pleased with. Will a swap from Mac Jones to Drake Maye be the big flip that this organization needs to get back on track? The Pats enter camp with the most Top 51 cap space ($41M) in football, while also holding a league-high $102M of projected cap space in 2025.\n\nNew Orleans Saints\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $11.2M (21st)\n\nTotal Cap: $280M (12th)\n\nDead Cap: $41M (10th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nChase Young (ED, 25): Leaves the 49ers on a 1 year, $13M contract, including $12.5M guaranteed.

They did their usual amount of cap-conversion/renegotiation work to stabilize financially, but only dabbled into the player addition market this offseason. This feels like an organization just trying to survive (ride out) its current QB contract right now.\n\nNew York Giants\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $10M (22nd)\n\nTotal Cap: $284M (8th)\n\nDead Cap: $21M (21st)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nJon Runyan (G, 26): Leaves the Packers on a 3 year, $30M contract that includes $17M guaranteed through 2025.

Adding Brian Burns to the mix defensively, and Malik Nabers to the arsenal offensively could be major shots in the arm for a team that lost its way last season.

Moses brings a 1 year $5.5M contract with him to NY.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nThe Jets continued their push to bolster the offensive line this offseason both in free agency (Tyron Smith, John Simpson) and at the top of their draft (Olu Fashanu). They then focused in on adding additional air weapons in free agency (Mike Williams) & the top of the draft (Malachi Corley).

Additions of Bryce Hugg & Chauncey Gardner-Johnson certainly help defensively in that regard, but a decision to bring in an older (more expensive) Saquon Barkley over a departing D’Andre Swift could prove to be controversial. With that said, Philly handed out 5 notable extensions this offseason (a product of their aggressive bonus/cap structures), furthering their plan to be an NFC contender for the foreseeable future.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $16M (17th)\n\nTotal Cap: $275M (15th)\n\nDead Cap: $24M (18th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nPatrick Queen (LB, 24): Leaves the Ravens on a 3 year, $41M contract that includes $13.8M guaranteed through 2024.

Sweetening Christian McCaffrey’s pot certainly seemed a worthy move, but much of the attention this summer will turn to the WR room, where both Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk have been rumored in trades, while top draft pick Ricky Pearsall will be looking to make an immediate impact in Year 1. Oh, and of course there’s that looming Brock Purdy extension discussion coming this December…\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $24k (32nd)\n\nTotal Cap: $291M (3rd)\n\nDead Cap: $36M (12th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nLeonard Williams (DE, 30): Rejoins the Seahawks on a 3 year, $64.5M contract including $27M guaranteed through 2024. He’ll start on the D-Line again in 2024.\n\nNoah Fant (TE, 26): Rejoins the Seahawks on a 2 year, $21M contract that includes $11.5M guaranteed through 2024. He projects to serve as the TE1 in 2024.\n\nRayshawn Jenkins (S, 30): Leaves the Jaguars on a 2 year, $12M contract that includes $6.2M guaranteed. He projects to start at FS.\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nNotable Free Agent Losses\n\nDamien Lewis (G, 27): Joins the Panthers on a 4 year, $53M contract ($26.2M guaranteed).\n\nJordyn Brooks (LB, 26): Joins the Dolphins on a 3 year, $26.25M contract ($9.5M guaranteed).\n\nColby Parkinson (TE, 25): Joins the Rams on a 3 year, $22.5M contract ($10.2M guaranteed).\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nNotable Extensions\n\nNone.\n\nNotable Trades\n\nAcquired Sam Howell (QB, 23), a 4th round pick & a 6th round pick from the Commanders in exchange for a 3rd & 5th round pick. Howell brings a 2 year, $2M (non-guaranteed) contract with him to Seattle.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nThe Seahawks had a chance to rip the band-aid off completely this past winter, but chose to run most of their roster back for 2024. This is still a talented roster on paper, but they could be eyeing the same near .500 outlook they finished with in 2023. Most of their major contracts (Geno Smith, DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett, Dre’Mont Jones, Julian Love) hold clear cut outs after 2024 should the wheels fall off completely.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $8.5M (25th)\n\nTotal Cap: $276M (16th)\n\nDead Cap: $55M (4th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nJordan Whitehead (S, 27): Leaves the Jets on a 2 year, $9M contract that includes $4.5M guaranteed through 2024. He projects to start at SS.\n\nLavonte David (LB, 34): Rejoins the Buccaneers on a 1 year, $8.5M contract, fully guaranteed. He’ll center Tampa’s defense once again.\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nNotable Free Agent Losses\n\nShaquil Barrett (ED, 31): Joins the Dolphins on a 1 year, $7M contract ($6.75M guaranteed).\n\nDevin White (LB, 26): Joins the Eagles on a 1 year, $4M contract ($3.5M guaranteed).\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nNotable Extensions\n\nBaker Mayfield (QB, 28): Signed a 3 year, $100M extension prior to free agency, including $40M fully guaranteed through 2024.\n\nAntoine Winfield Jr. (S, 25): Replaced a $17.1M franchise tag with a 4 year, $84.1M extension that includes $45M fully guaranteed through 2025.\n\nMike Evans (WR, 30): Signed a 2 year, $41M contract prior to free agency that includes $29M fully guaranteed at signing.\n\nNotable Trades\n\nSent Carlton Davis (CB, 27) to the Lions with two 6th round picks in exchange for a 3rd round pick.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nTampa ran it all the way back this offseason, locking in Baker Mayfield, Mike Evans, Antoine Winfield, Lavonte David, and even bringing back old friend Jordan Whitehead to round out the spring. It’s a winnable division if a few young pieces develop quickly, and Mayfield continues his veteran growth spurt, but this is also a team carrying $55M of dead cap (4th) after a 2023 season where they carried over $81M. Rebuilding on the fly in this regard comes with its challenges, but the NFC South might be weak enough to make this approach doable.\n\nTennessee Titans\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $23M (12th)\n\nTotal Cap: $269M (27th)\n\nDead Cap: $39M (11th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nCalvin Ridley (WR, 29): Leaves the Jaguars on a 4 year, $92M contract that includes $50M practically guaranteed through 2025. He’ll slot into a top WR role alongside DeAndre Hopkins.\n\nLloyd Cushenberry (C, 26): Leaves the Broncos on a 4 year, $50M contract that includes $30M practically guaranteed through 2025. He projects as the starting center in 2024.\n\nChidobe Awuzie (CB, 29): Leaves the Bengals on a 3 year, $36M contract that includes $23M practically guaranteed through 2025.\n\nTony Pollard (RB, 27): Leaves the Cowboys on a 3 year, $21M contract that includes $10.5M guaranteed through 2025. He’ll compete for the RB1 role this summer.\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nNotable Free Agent Losses\n\nAzeez Al-Shaair (LB, 26): Joins the Texans on a 3 year, $34M contract ($21.5M guaranteed).\n\nSean Bunting (CB, 27): Joins the Cardinals on a 3 year, $25.5M contract ($14M guaranteed).\n\nAaron Brewer (C, 26): Joins the Dolphins on a 3 year, $21M contract ($10.2M guaranteed).\n\nDerrick Henry (RB, 30): Joins the Ravens on a 2 year, $16M contract ($9M guaranteed).\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nNotable Extensions\n\nL'Jarius Sneed (CB, 27): Signed a 4 year, $76.4M contract to replace a $19.8M franchise tag that includes $44M fully guaranteed through 2025.\n\nMorgan Cox (LS, 37): Returns on a 1 year veteran minimum contract.\n\nNotable Trades\n\nAcquired Leroy Watson (TE, 26) from the Browns in exchange for a 7th round pick. Watson brings a 1 year, $915,000 contract with him to Tennessee.\n\nAcquired L'Jarius Sneed (CB, 27) from the Chiefs with a 7th round pick in exchange for a 3rd & 7th round pick. Sneed was extended out 4 years, $76.4M upon his arrival.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nThe Titans responded to finishing near the bottom of the AFC last season with an aggressive about face this March that included two big secondary adds (Sneed/Awuzie), a bigtime receiver (Ridley), & an immediate attempt to replace Derrick Henry in Tony Pollard. If the goal is to give Will Levis a legitimate chance to grow into the QB1 of this franchise going forward, Tennessee’s front office has certainly stepped up their part of the deal. With that said, this is still a bottom 3rd team in terms of cap allocations for both 2024 & 2025. There’s room to grow if the success on the field dictates.\n\nWashington Commanders\n\nCurrent 90-Man Roster Financials\n\nTop 51 Space: $36M (3rd)\n\nTotal Cap: $262M (29th)\n\nDead Cap: $29M (15th)\n\nNotable Free Agent Adds\n\nDorance Armstrong (DE, 27): Leaves the Cowboys on a 3 year, $33M contract that includes $16.1M guaranteed through 2024. He projects to start on the DL.\n\nFrankie Luvu (LB, 27): Leaves the Panthers on a 3 year, $31M contract that includes $19.1M practically guaranteed through 2025. He’ll center the Washington defense in 2024.\n\nTyler Biadasz (C, 26): Leaves the Cowboys on a 3 year, $29.25M contract that includes $20.7M practically guaranteed through 2025. He projects to start at center this season.\n\nNick Allegretti (G, 28): Leaves the Chiefs on a 3 year, $16M contract that includes $9M guaranteed through 2025. He projects to serve as the starting LG.\n\nAustin Ekeler (RB, 29): Leaves the Chargers on a 2 year, $8.34M contract that includes $4.2M guaranteed through 2024. He’ll compete for RB1 duties with Brian Robinson.\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nNotable Free Agent Losses\n\nCurtis Samuel (WR, 27): Joins the Bills on a 3 year, $24M contract ($15M guaranteed).\n\nKendall Fuller (CB, 29): Joins the Dolphins on a 2 year, $15M contract ($8M guaranteed).\n\nAntonio Gibson (RB, 26): Joins the Patriots on a 3 year, $11.25M contract ($5.3M guaranteed).\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nNotable Extensions\n\nNone.\n\nNotable Trades\n\nSent Sam Howell (QB, 23) to Seattle with a 4th & 6th round pick in exchange for a 3rd & 5th round pick.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nNew regime, new QB1, and apparently no time to waste in Washington. The Commanders were far more aggressive this past free agency than many expected them to be, but are still very much in “evaluation” mode with much of their roster. If a few of these 2024 draft picks pop early, look for a young front office to be extremely active in trade discussions as early as this October. Washington boasts the 3rd most cap space ($36M) heading toward camp."
