        "text": "ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - Wednesday, thanks to continued viewership, support and stories from the South Georgia community, WALB was honored by the Georgia Association of Broadcasters (GAB).\n\nThe GAB is visiting several Georgia broadcasting markets to recognize and thank those who keep the public informed and safe. This is a part of the organization’s 90th anniversary celebration.\n\nAt Wednesday’s event, the GAB thanked several of Albany’s first responders for their continued support for journalism and the vital role they play in keeping communities safe.\n\nThey also recognized Both WALB’s Jim Wallace and Karla Heath-Sands for their impact on Georgia broadcasting. Combined, they have nearly three-quarters of a century of broadcasting experience. Jim was recognized for his 47 years of dedication to South Georgia.\n\n“It was always exciting when Jim and Ducky Wall would come during football season because they were covering Crisp County Cougars. So you always had a chance to get of the WALB News,” Albany Mayor Bo Dorough said.\n\n“Jim Wallace, we are going to miss him as anchor man there, and he has served our district really just so well. We thank you for all the things you’ve done there,” Gerald Greene, dean of the Georgia House of Representatives, said.\n\nKarla was also recognized for her support of minority voices through her time as the host of “Dialogue,” which is celebrating its 30th year.\n\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?
