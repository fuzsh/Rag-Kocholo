He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Becky Wilson Greene; son, Eric Greene; daughter, Pam Dixon, her son, Matt Dixon (Hayley), and their daughter, Emma.\nGerald was born in Canton, NC, in 1939. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the Army where he served in Korea as a medic. After leaving the Army, Gerald had multiple jobs that involved banking and home mortgages, with most of his career, over 30 years, spent at the former Canton Savings and Loan, in Candler.\nGerald enjoyed his job and in his time away from work he enjoyed woodworking, fishing, attending church, coaching church softball and listening to his wife sing. He was also a big sports fan, especially of the Atlanta Braves.\nA private service will be held at Pisgah View Memorial Park, in Candler.\nIn lieu of flowers, Gerald’s wish was for donations to be made to Memory Care of Asheville in honor of his wife Becky who is dealing with Alzheimer’s disease: SECU Center for Memory Care, 100 Far Horizons Lane, Asheville, NC 28803.",
