        "text": "GERALD “JERRY” A. GREENE III, 53, of Cranston, passed away peacefully on Sunday, May 22, 2022, at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, surrounded by his loving family. He was the husband of twenty-two years to Lisanne Briggs.\n\nBorn in Providence, he was the son of Gerald Greene, Jr. and Peggy Moore of Warwick.\n\nA proud graduate of Cranston High School West class of 1987 and the Community College of Rhode Island, Jerry was employed as a mechanical draftsman at Orion RED in Smithfield for the last ten years, where he took pride in helping his company develop and design iconic backdrops for award shows and Rockefeller Plaza events.\n\nJerry was also a lifelong fan of anything Star Wars or Legos, and collected timeless pieces throughout his years. He had the opportunity to meet many actors from the films at different conventions, which he loved to attend. He was also a member of the R2-D2 Droid Builders Club, where he built his own R2-D2, R2-R9, and in 2005, helped create the pink R2-KT droid, which he built in memory of Katie Johnson, who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.\n\nAside from Star Wars and Legos, Jerry’s favorite holiday was Halloween, and every year, he would build most of his own decorations for his front yard. His decorations would light up, ghostly move around in the vestibules he designed, and he made sure to always have a costume complete with Special FX makeup to make his setup extra spooky. He was an avid actor volunteer at the former Spooky World in Cranston, as well as Factory of Terror in West Warwick. Most recently, he worked at the Haunted Tunnel at Slater Park in Pawtucket.\n\nWhile he was an artist, he was also an avid musician and loved rock and heavy metal bands such as Dokken, Van Halen, Metallica, and more. He loved playing and collecting all different styles of electric guitars and could also play the drums.\n\nBesides his parents, he is survived by a sister, Michelle and her husband Ken King of Cranston. His is also survived by his stepmother, Kathleen Davis. He leaves behind three children: Aja and her husband Nick Cash of Seekonk, Mass., Alayna Briggs of Attleboro, Mass., and Cody Ross of Cranston. Jerry was also the loving grandfather of Giana and Holden Cash, both of Seekonk, and the uncle of his niece, Kellsie King, and his nephew, Ken King, Jr., both of Cranston. He is also survived by his grandfather, Gerald Greene, Sr. of Providence, and several uncles, aunts, cousins, and friends. He was predeceased in death by his grandmothers, Emmalina Greene and Fanny Moore, along with his grandfather, Cecil Moore, Sr.\n\nRelatives and friends are invited to attend visiting hours from 4 to 7 p.m. on Friday, May 27, 2022 at the “WOODLAWN” Funeral Home, 600 Pontiac Ave., Cranston. Funeral services will be private.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family of Jerry is respectfully accepting donations for medical bills and expenses during visiting hours."
