Gerald Green is not returning to the Heat.

The Sporting News reported Saturday that Green will sign with the Celtics on a one-year, guaranteed contract. He was drafted by Boston with the 18th overall pick in the 2005 draft.

Green signed a one-year contract for $1.4 million to join the Heat last offseason, which is the league minimum for players with eight years of NBA service. The 30-year-old averaged 8.9 points on 39.2 percent shooting to go along with 2.4 rebounds and 0.8 assists primarily in a bench role with Miami last season.

It was an up-and-down season for Green, who lost playing time after the Heat acquired Joe Johnson in February. After averaging 26 minutes of playing time before the All-Star break, he got 16 minutes of playing time per game after the break.

Green’s time with the Heat included a bizarre incident that left him hospitalized early in the season. He missed four games due to an “illness,” and the Heat later suspended him for two games for “conduct detrimental to the team.” No further details were revealed by the Heat or Green.

The Heat could have offered a minimum contract or the $2.9 million room exception to keep Green. But with 17 players already on the roster for next season, the Heat likely couldn’t have offered much playing time.

Miami brings back wing players Justise Winslow, Josh Richardson and Tyler Johnson, and added Wayne Ellington and Rodney McGruder. The Heat also brought in versatile forwards James Johnson and Derrick Williams this offseason.
