        "text": "Save as PDF\n\nTranslatable\n\nTo work with Bibliographic Records, you must have one of the following roles:\n\nCataloger\n\nCataloger Extended\n\nCatalog Administrator\n\nCatalog Manager\n\nThe Alma repository contains bibliographic records that represent physical, electronic, and digital resources. Using the Alma Metadata Editor, you can manually create bibliographic records for these resources (see Creating Bibliographic Records for more information).\n\nTo merge duplicate bibliographic records, see Merging Bibliographic Records. For additional management tools, see Managing Bibliographic Records.\n\nYou can create bibliographic records automatically by importing bibliographic data from other sources in files. For more information, see Importing Records Using Profiles. Additional information related to working with bibliographic records from external resources can be found in Resource Management.\n\nThe Community Zone can be used to identify resources and link them to your local repository.\n\nFor more information about the Community Zone, see the Alma Community Zone Intro and Task List video (14:10 mins).\n\nIf your Alma system is part of a collaborative network, you can centrally manage bibliographic records; see Network-Managed Records in a Collaborative Network.\n\nCreating Bibliographic Records\n\nAlma provides the Metadata Editor for creating individual bibliographic records. To customize the process of entering bibliographic records, you can use a template that you tailor to your needs (see Working with Record Templates for more information).\n\nCreating a MARC 21 Bibliographic Record\n\nTo create a MARC 21 bibliographic record:\n\nOpen the Metadata Editor (Resources > Cataloging > Open Metadata Editor).\n\nSelect New > MARC 21 Bibliographic and select the default template for entering a bibliographic record.\n\nThe Metadata Editor opens this template.\n\nEnter the data for your bibliographic record. See the Metadata Editor Menu and Toolbar Options section for additional information regarding working with the Metadata Editor.\n\nFor information regarding entering record content in Hebrew, see Show Directional Characters and Insert Directional Characters.\n\nFor additional information on cataloging in Hebrew, see Special Issues in Hebrew Cataloging.\n\nWhen you catalog the 010 or 035 fields, enter a hash sign (#) for each space that you want saved for this field. The content is saved to the Alma database as spaces (for each hash sign entered), but appears in the Metadata Editor as the hash sign, to more clearly identify the exact number of spaces in the field.\n\nIn the following fields, the system provides pop-up assistance after you type the first three characters (see the illustration below):\n\n260 $$a, b, e, f\n\n264 $$a, b\n\n505 $$r, t\n\n561 $a\n\nWhen entering special characters, the pop-up assistance was implemented in the following manner with a customer parameter setting:\n\nWhen entering record content and the Metadata Editor provides suggestions (after typing the first few characters) and using the Eszett character or ss in place of the Eszett , the suggestions provided are specific to what you type. That is, typing values with ß, such as Großbritannien, displays only results that contain ß, and typing values with ss, such as Grossbritannien, displays only results that contain ss.\n\nWhen entering record content and the Metadata Editor provides suggestions (after typing the first few characters) and using the umlaut character or the letter without the umlaut, the suggestions provided are specific to what you type. So, if you type Müller, you get suggestions with the ü; and if you type Muller, you get suggestions without the ü.\n\nWhen entering record content and the Metadata Editor provides suggestions (after typing the first few characters) and you type a hyphen, only results appear that contain a hyphen, such as Baden-Baden. If, for example, you type Baden Baden without the hyphen, only results that do not contain a hyphen appear.\n\nContact Support to set the customer parameter for subfield suggestions to handle Metadata Editor suggestions in the manner that you prefer.\n\nThe pop-up assistance provided for these fields is not suggested for authority or bibliographic headings. This pop-up assistance is determined by the descriptions that you create and save in the Controlled Vocabulary Registry (see Configuring Controlled Vocabulary Registry) and then, subsequently, identify in your metadata configuration using Choose Controlled Vocabulary (see Editing Fields) to select the Controlled Vocabulary Registry list of descriptions that you previously created.\n\nTo access suggested authority and bibliographic headings, press F3 from the field that you are entering/checking. The system opens a list of options from which to choose (note that the subfields are extracted according to their original cataloging order). If no headings suggestions are available, Alma displays No matching headings found. See Using F3 for more information.\n\nIf you are working in IE and press F3, make sure that you press Enter while the focus is on the text. Otherwise, the headings list may not display properly.\n\nWhen priorities have been defined for multiple authority vocabularies, the system checks for matches in priority order and displays the results on separate tabs (such as GND and LCSH) in priority order from left to right when F3 is used. See Authority Priorities for more information.\n\nLocal authorities are identified with the word (Local) in parentheses.\n\nPreferred terms are identified with a star. Non-preferred terms are blank at the left (the absence of a star).\n\nSelect View to display the entire authority record.\n\nSelect Select to insert the content into the record on which you are working.\n\nSelect the Headings from bibliographic records tab to view the suggested bibliographic headings.\n\nFor additional information, refer to Working with Authority Records.\n\nSelect the Save icon. For additional information regarding saving records, refer to Saving Records in the Metadata Editor.\n\nIf you edit a field in an existing record that is related to another field in another record, the link between the records is broken when you save the edited record. Alma must run the MMS - Build Record Relations job (see Viewing All Scheduled Jobs) in order for the link to be recreated. If you edit a field that is not related to a field in another record, the link between the records remains intact.\n\nWorking with Uniform Title Headings for GND Records\n\nFor GND authority records, headings are created from the 1XX and 4XX fields. In addition, for uniform title authority records, headings are also created from the 5XX fields when the GND authority record contains:\n\n075 $b u\n\n130 field and a 500, 510, or 511 with $9 that contains one of the following:\n\n4:auta\n\n4:koma\n\n4:regi\n\n4:kuen\n\nAs a result, when editing records in the Metadata Editor and using F3, suggested headings may provide results based on headings created from the 5XX fields. See Linking an Authority Record to a Bibliographic Record for more information about working with F3.\n\nStarting with the May 2017 release, the capability for utilizing 5XX data is being implemented gradually. Initially, this capability is available for new uniform title authority records and, ultimately, will be available for all GND records.\n\nGenerating Uniform Title Authority Headings that Begin with $t\n\nWhen uniform title GND authority records (identified by 075 $b u) are contributed to the Community Zone, additional authority headings are created that begin with $t. These headings are created in addition to the headings that are created from the 1XX and 4XX fields in the authority record. When bibliographic records are edited and F3 is used to link to authority headings, the additional headings beginning with $t provide more access points for F3 authority headings verification. This is also the case for 1xx and 4xx fields except for the 130 and 430 fields.\n\nSee below for an example authority record and the authority headings created.\n\nAuthority Record:\n\n035 ## $a (DE-588) 9999999-9\n\n075 ## ... $b u ... $c 1 ... $q s\n\n100 1# $a Williams, Tennessee $d 1911-1983 $t <<A>> streetcar named desire\n\n400 1# $a Williams, Tennessee $d 1911-1983 $t Endstation Sehnsucht $9 v:$: ÖB-Alternative\n\nHeadings Created:\n\nEndstation Sehnsucht | Williams, Tennessee, 1911-1983 | (DE-588) 9999999-9 | us | 1\n\n<<A>> streetcar named desire | Williams, Tennessee, 1911-1983 | (DE-588) 9999999-9 | us | 1\n\nWilliams, Tennessee 1911-1983 Endstation Sehnsucht | (DE-588) 9999999-9 | us | 1\n\nWilliams, Tennessee 1911-1983 <<A>> streetcar named desire | (DE-588) 9999999-9 | us | 1\n\nWorking with the 240 Field and Uniform Title Bibliographic Headings\n\nTo use this capability, Ex Libris Support needs to configure this feature to create uniform title bibliographic headings for the 240 fields for your institution. Contact Ex Libris Support if this has not been enabled for your institution.\n\nUniform title bibliographic headings support includes support for the MARC 21 240 field. With this feature, you can link the 240 headings to uniform title authority headings, created from the 130 or 430 fields of the authority, or from GND authorities with entity type u. With the 240 field configured as an access point for uniform titles, pressing F3 from the bibliographic 240 field does a uniform title headings lookup that presents a cataloger with the available uniform title authority headings from the 130 or 430 fields.\n\nAfter Ex Libris Support has configured the 240 field as an F3 access point, in addition to being able to use F3 in the Metadata Editor for the 240 field, you will also notice that the 240 $a is no longer a configurable subfield consistent with metadata configuration options. See Editing Fields for more information.\n\nBibliographic Ranking in Community Zone Collections\n\nThis information is displayed on the Collection level: Collection search results for all management labels (Managed by Ex Libris, Managed by community, Contributed, Not Maintained, Pending Deletion).\n\nThe Bibliographic Rank field is visible in Community Zone collections. This field presents the average rank of the bibliographic records within the collection and operates across three distinct levels:\n\nLow - 0-39\n\nMed 40-79\n\nHigh 80-150\n\nThe bibliographic ranking range is between 1 - 150. Generally, records that are ranked higher than 75 are considered good records.\n\nThe three quality categories mentioned above are based on the distribution within the collection of Bibliographic Ranking of Bib records. The logic of the Bibliographic Ranking is to display on the collection level the average of the Bibliographic Ranking of all associated Bib records so users know which collection is better to activate, and also what kind of quality to expect from the collection before they activate it.\n\nThe inclusion of Community Zone collection quality data, such as the average Bibliographic Rank, empowers users to address inquiries about the quality of MARC records within a specific Community Zone collection.\n\nUsers are presented with the following additional information on the level of the Community Zone collections:\n\nBibliographic Ranking Description Average The sum of all the individual Bibliographic Rankings, divided by the total # of records. High % of records with \"High\" Bibliographic Ranking (as calculated by the three distinct level mentioned above - 80-150). Medium % of records with \"Medium\" Bibliographic Ranking (as calculated by the three distinct level mentioned above - 40-79). Low % of records with \"Low\" Bibliographic Ranking (as calculated by the three distinct level mentioned above - up to 39).\n\nThe option to customize views has been expanded to include the Bibliographic Rank and Brief Level fields for portfolio-level information. Users can select to display these details in the search results if desired. For more information on the Brief Level field calculation, refer to Level 1 - Breadth in the Bibliographic Rank Algorithm.\n\nTo customize the view for Portfolios:\n\nAccess any search Record entity and select the Manage Column Display icon ( ).\n\nIn Column 4 of the Customize view screen, select the \"Bib Rank and Brief Score\" option.\n\nNote: To disable the view, de-select the Bib Rank and Brief Score option.\n\nSelect Save.\n\nBibliographic Rank Algorithm\n\nAlma evaluates the completeness and richness of MARC 21 bibliographic records based on information that includes identifiers, names, subjects, informative LDR and 008 fields, publication details, etc. This is reflected in the Bibliographic Rank, meant to provide a helpful tool for libraries to identify records that may need attention. The new bibliographic rank is displayed in the record view and in the Metadata Editor.\n\nThe bibliographic ranking range is between 1 - 150. Generally, records that are ranked higher than 75 are considered good records.\n\nThe bibliographic ranking is generated through an algorithm that is further described below.\n\nGeneral Model\n\nThis is a two-level approach:\n\nLevel 1 - Breadth: The focus here is on coverage: Fields are grouped into categories and where a record has any one of the fields in a category it is given a score according to the importance of the category.\n\nLOW importance gives 1 point\n\nMEDIUM importance gives 3 points\n\nHIGH importance gives 7 points\n\nFor example, Subjects category has high importance, so it is assigned a score of 7. Canceled identifiers category is less important, so it has a score of only 1. There are 27 categories. The full list is described below in Categories.\n\nLevel 2 - Depth: The second focus is on depth. For example, rather than just checking that there is a 6XX field, attention is paid to how many 6XX fields are included.\n\nDepth is relevant only for some of the categories. When a record has such a category, the fields in the category are counted. The number of fields is the depth score of the category.\n\nEach relevant category has a \"depth limit\" to avoid giving too much weight to having many fields.\n\nThe total score is breadth score + depth score.\n\nCategories\n\nThe following is the full list of categories. For each category, this information is included:\n\nList of the fields in the category\n\nImportance\n\nIndication if it is relevant for depth, and if so:\n\nDepth limit\n\n# Category Name Fields Importance Relevant for depth?

The following validations are invoked:\n\nMandatory fields exist (LDR and 245)\n\nControl fields have legitimate data\n\nIndicators have legitimate data\n\nOnly fields that are repeatable appear multiple times\n\nOnly subfields that are repeatable appear multiple times\n\nAll sub-fields are valid according to MARC standard\n\nIf there is an issue, the total score is reduced by 1 point.\n\nGenerating Author Numbers Automatically\n\nWith Alma cataloging, you can automatically generate the author number in MARC 21 bibliographic records. For example, you can automatically generate the Chinese author call number for the 905 local call number field in a MARC 21 bibliographic record. The 905 local call number field consists of the following:\n\n905 $d - Created by copying the 093 $a using an Alma normalization rule\n\n905 $e - Created based on the content in $a of the 100, 110, 111, or 245 fields, the mapping table configured in the Author Number Lists mapping table, and the Generate Author Number menu option in the Metadata Editor (see the procedure below)\n\n905 $s - Created using an Alma normalization rule to concatenate the content of 905 $d, 905 $e, 905 $v (not mandatory), and 905 $y (not mandatory) with a forward slash (/) used to separate each subfield's content.\n\nTo enable this capability, you need to:\n\nConfigure the author number list in the Author Number Lists mapping table.\n\nNote that the standardized list of Chinese author call numbers (obtained from the Cutter Sanborn Three-Figure Author Table) is maintained in Alma and can be configured with the Author Number Lists mapping table. See Configuring Author Number Lists for more information regarding how to configure this table.\n\nCreate the normalization rules for generating the 905 $d and 905 $s.\n\nTo automatically generate a Chinese author call number for the 905 $e:\n\nIn the Metadata Editor, open a bibliographic record to which you want to add the 905 author number.\n\nMake the 100, 110, 111, or 245 field the active field. The field that you select as the active field must have content in $a.\n\nSelect Editing Actions > Generate Author Number (or press F4). The 905 $e is automatically generated with the author number.\n\nSave your record.\n\nTo add $d and $s to the 905 field, create normalization rules and use the Editing Actions >Enhance the Record option (with your cursor positioned in the 905 field) to copy the 093 $a and generate the concatenated 905 $s. See Working with Normalization Rules for more information about creating normalization rules. In particular, note the suffixSubField and prefixSubField normalization syntax needed for concatenating the fields for the 905 $s.\n\nCreating a UNIMARC Bibliographic Record\n\nTo create a UNIMARC bibliographic record:\n\nContact Ex Libris to set the Active Registry mapping in your system for UNIMARC Bibliographic support. By default, MARC 21 Bibliographic is set as the Activated and Preferred registry.\n\nOpen the Metadata Editor (Resources > Cataloging > Open Metadata Editor).\n\nOpen the default bibliographic template (New > UNIMARC Bibliographic).\n\nEnter your bibliographic content.\n\nSimilar to MARC 21 bibliographic records, the Metadata Editor for UNIMARC bibliographic records provides validation support specific to UNIMARC using the Alerts tab.\n\nSimilar to the pop-up assistance capability in Alma’s Metadata Editor for several MARC 21 fields, this same autocomplete functionality is provided to assist catalogers by providing content suggestions for certain UNIMARC fields.\n\nThere is a known issue related to UNIMARC 327 $a and 327 $b. These subfields are based on the same functionality. As a result, the pop-up suggests the values of both subfields when entering content in either the 327 $a or the 327 $b\n\nRefer to the table below for a list of the equivalent UNIMARC fields that are being provided with the autocomplete feature. After typing the first three characters, the system attempts to provide a suggestion for the field/subfield being entered.\n\nEquivalent UNIMARC Fields Provided for Autocomplete MARC 21 Bibliographic Fields UNIMARC Fields 260 $a 210 $a 260 $b 210 $c 260 $e 210 $e 260 $f 210 $g 505 $r 327 $z 505 $t 327 $a 505 $t 327 $b 561 $a 317 $a\n\nUser assistance is not provided for the 4XX UNIMARC fields.\n\nBefore saving your changes, open the Record Actions and Editing Actions menus to view all the active options for working with the UNIMARC record. Similar to working with MARC 21 records, you can create templates, enhance the record (using normalization), expand from a template, and so forth.\n\nSelect Save to save your UNIMARC bibliographic record.\n\nImplemented Punctuation for Displayed UNIMARC Records\n\nAs part of UNIMARC support in Alma, the correct punctuation displays with fields in UNIMARC records. Where the contents of UNIMARC records are displayed in Alma as in the repository search results, Alma formats the displayed text with the appropriate punctuation. For example, the rows below show a bibliographic record’s content and its display format.\n\nBibliographic format:\n\n710 $$a Cardiff Roundtable in Language and Communication $$d 2nd $$e Cardiff University $$f 1997\n\nDisplay format:\n\nCardiff Roundtable in Language and Communication (2nd ; Cardiff University ; 1997).\n\nUNIMARC Display Punctuation UNIMARC Mapping Punctuation Explanations 700ab, 701ab, 710a,b,c,d,f,e, 711a,b,c,d,f,e if $7=ba or does not exist 70X a, b Example: Vian, Boris\n\n71X a. b. c (d ; e ; f)\n\nExample: Canadian andrology society.

This applies to the following fields:\n\n200, 205, 206, 207, 208, 210\n\n327\n\nAll 4XX fields: 410, 411, 412, 413, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 461, 463, 464, 470, 481, 482, 488\n\nAll 5XX fields: 500, 501, 503, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 520, 530, 431, 532, 540, 541, 545\n\n600, 601, 602, 605\n\nAll 7XX fields: 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 712, 716, 720, 721, 722\n\nAuthority Control\n\nUNIMARC bibliographic fields with a script indication in $7 is controlled by the same script in the authority record. The system manages this by locating the script identified in the first two positions of $7 in the bibliographic record and by locating the script identified in positions five and six of $7 in the authority record. The authority control functionality that exists for MARC 21 is also provided for UNIMARC. This includes:\n\nAuthorities - Link BIB Headings\n\nAuthorities - Preferred Term Correction\n\nF3\n\nFor publishing to Primo, the preferred, non-preferred, and see also information is published in all languages; and the language indication/code is published in $7 according to the UNIMARC standard (not $L as in MARC 21).\n\nThe authority control process in Alma differentiates between authority links that result in partial matches and those that result in full matches, and only includes URIs for full matches. This differentiation resolves the issue of the process generating partial matches between subject headings and authority records, resulting in the creation of external vocabulary URIs that only partially correspond to the subject.\n\nUsing Multiple Access Points for UNIMARC\n\nAlma supports a single UNIMARC 6XX field to be split into several sections in the Metadata Editor where each section is an access point for F3 and authority control. Alma provides a configuration option where you can customize the 6XX fields that have multiple access points. See Configuring Multiple Access Points for UNIMARC for more information.\n\nAfter you have customized and enabled the 6XX fields in the UNIMARC Multiple Authority ID configuration (see Configuring Multiple Access Points for UNIMARC), the 6XX headings control fields are formatted in multiple rows (sections) in the Metadata Editor. The rows of the 6XX fields are determined by $3 that contains the record ID for the linked authority record. Authority control is applied separately to each $3 section. $3 is used as the delimiter that identifies where new sections (rows) begin for the 6XX fields in the Metadata Editor.\n\nIn the simple Record View (see Viewing Metadata Read-Only in the Simple Record View Page), the 6XX headings control fields continue to appear in a single row.\n\nFor each row (section), the indicators are repeated, and the vocabulary in $2 is copied from the original field and placed at the end.\n\nFor each row (section) of the 6XX field, you can press F3 to check for authority headings and link bibliographic record sections. See Creating a MARC 21 Bibliographic Record and Linking an Authority Record to a Bibliographic Record for more information about using F3.\n\nNew sections (rows) can be added by using Editing Actions > Add Multi Headings Sections in the Metadata Editor. For new sections that you add, pressing F3 for the new section will open a list of headings that match the text in that section. Selecting an authority record links the bibliographic record to the bibliographic headings in that section and adds $3 with the ID of the authority record.\n\nWhen you use Browse Bibliographic Headings, the browse results reflect multiple, separate headings for records that contain multiple $3 sections in the bibliographic record.\n\nCreating a KORMARC Bibliographic Record\n\nTo create a KORMARC bibliographic record:\n\nContact Ex Libris to set the Active Registry mapping in your system for KORMARC Bibliographic support. By default, MARC 21 Bibliographic is set as the Activated and Preferred registry.\n\nOpen the Metadata Editor (Resources > Cataloging > Open Metadata Editor).\n\nOpen the default bibliographic template (New > KORMARC Bibliographic).\n\nEnter your bibliographic content.\n\nWhen entering the following fields, the system provides pop-up assistance after you have typed the first three characters:\n\n260 $$a, b, e, f\n\n264$b\n\n505 $$r, t\n\n561$a\n\nSimilar to MARC 21 bibliographic records, the Metadata Editor for KORMARC bibliographic records provides validation support specific to KORMARC using the Alerts tab.\n\nWhen you open the form editor (Editing Actions > Open Form Editor) for the KORMARC 008 control field, the following KORMARC field options are provided:\n\nKorea government agency\n\nKorea University\n\nSelect Save to save your KORMARC bibliographic record.\n\nGenerating the Author Numbers Automatically for the 090 Local Call Number Field in a KORMARC Bibliographic Record\n\nWith Alma cataloging, you can automatically generate the author number for the 090 local call number field. The 090 local call number field consists of the following:\n\n090 $a - Dewey call number that is copied from the 082 $a\n\n090 $b - Author number that is pulled from a standardized list of author numbers with a prefix consisting of the first initial of the author's last name and a suffix containing the first initial of the title such as G329w\n\n090 $c - Year that is copied from the 260 $c\n\nThe standardized list of author numbers is incorporated into Alma's logic for automatically generating author numbers when the appropriate file in the mapping table is enabled. See Configuring Author Number Lists for more information.\n\nTo automatically generate an author number in the 090 field:\n\nOpen a bibliographic record to which you want to add the 090 author number in the Metadata Editor.\n\nMake a 100 or 700 author field the active field.\n\nSelect Editing Actions > Generate Author Number (or press F4).\n\nIf you have enabled only one author number list in the Author Number Lists configuration (Configuration Menu > Resources > Cataloging > Author Number Lists), the target field and subfield that you identified in the Author Number Lists configuration is automatically generated with the author number.\n\nIf you have enabled more than one author number list configuration in the Author Number Lists configuration, the system prompts you to select the author number list to use.\n\nSee Configuring Standard Author Number Lists for more information.\n\nSave your record.\n\nTo add $a and $c to the 090 field, create a normalization rule and use the Editing Actions > Enhance the Record option (with your cursor positioned in the 090 field) to copy the 082 $a and 260 $c to the respective 090 subfields. See Working with Normalization Rules for more information regarding normalization rules.\n\nCreating a CNMARC Bibliographic Record\n\nIn order to create and work with CNMARC bibliographic records, CNMARC Bibliographic needs to be identified as an active registry for your system. If you do not see the CNMARC Bibliographic folder under the Records tab in the Metadata Editor, contact Ex Libris to have CNMARC Bibliographic configured for your system.\n\nUse the procedure below to create a CNMARC bibliographic record.\n\nTo create a CNMARC bibliographic record:\n\nOpen the Metadata Editor (Resources > Cataloging > Open Metadata Editor).\n\nOpen the default bibliographic template (New > CNMARC Bibliographic).\n\nEnter your bibliographic content.\n\nSimilar to MARC 21 bibliographic records, the Metadata Editor for CNMARC bibliographic records provides validation support specific to CNMARC using the Alerts tab. Validation criteria can be customized in the CNMARC metadata profile (see Editing Validation Routines).\n\nUse the File menu or select the Save icon to save your CNMARC bibliographic record.\n\nUsing Multiple Access Points for CNMARC 6XX Fields\n\nAlma supports a single CNMARC 6XX field to be split into several sections where each section is an access point for F3 and authority control. Alma provides a configuration option where you can define which 6XX fields have multiple access points. See Configuring Multiple Access Points for CNMARC 6XX Fields for more information.\n\nAfter you have configured the 6XX headings control fields, the 6XX headings control fields are formatted in multiple rows in the Metadata Editor. The rows or sections of the 6XX fields are determined by the a, j, x, y, and z subfields. These subfields are used as delimiters that identify where new segments (rows) begin for the 6XX fields. See an example below.\n\nHowever, in the simple Record View (see Viewing Metadata Read-Only in the Simple Record View Page), the 6XX headings control fields continue to appear in a single row.\n\nFor each row of the 6XX field, you can press F3 to check for authority headings and link bibliographic records. See Creating a MARC 21 Bibliographic Record and Linking an Authority Record to a Bibliographic Record for more information about using F3.\n\nYou can also use Browse Bibliographic Headings to browse each section of the 6XX field independently.\n\nCreating a Dublin Core Bibliographic Record\n\nTo create a Dublin Core bibliographic record:\n\nOpen the Metadata Editor (Resources > Cataloging > Open Metadata Editor).\n\nSelect New > Dublin Core.\n\nThe Metadata Editor opens the default template for entering your Dublin Core record.\n\nEnter the data for your Dublin Core record. See the Metadata Editor Menu and Toolbar Options section for more information.\n\nContact Ex Libris to set the Active Registry mapping in your system for Dublin Core support. By default, MARC 21 Bibliographic is set as the Activated and Preferred registry.\n\nCreator of a Bibliographic Record\n\nThe \"Creator\" field of a bibliographic record indicates how the record was created:\n\n\"import\" (lowercase \"i\") when the record came from migration\n\n\"System\" when the record came from an import profile\n\n\"CKB\" when the record came from a Community Zone Update\n\nMerging Bibliographic Records\n\nTo merge bibliographic records, you must have the following role:\n\nCataloger Extended\n\nAlma provides the ability to merge two bibliographic records (not linked to the Community Zone) in the Metadata Editor. This is helpful when catalogers identify duplicate bibliographic records in the catalog. The merge is handled by selecting one of the merge rules from a list of predefined merge routines. Merging two bibliographic records into one will move the following entities from the merged (secondary) to the merged (primary) record:\n\nPO line\n\nElectronic collections\n\nElectronic portfolios\n\nPhysical items\n\nDigital representations\n\nLoans\n\nRequests\n\nReading lists\n\nRelated record relationship (based on MMS ID)\n\nWhen the secondary record has a related record with the MMS ID of the secondary record specified in any of the 76X–78X fields, then during the merge process the MMS ID is updated to the MMS ID of the primary record in order to maintain a relationship (and avoid having a related record with no parent relationship, an \"orphan record\").\n\nYou can merge two bibliographic records only when both records are Institution Zone records, or both are Network Zone records. You cannot merge an Institution Zone bib record with a Network Zone bib record.\n\nFor information on placing an identifier from the secondary record in the primary record when merging records, see Configuring BIB Redirection Fields.\n\nWhen merging bibliographic records in the Network Zone, the process checks if the non-preferred bibliographic record is held by other members. If so, the process moves the inventory of all the members to the preferred bibliographic record. In this case, if a non-preferred record is suppressed, the suppression will be inherited by the preferred record.\n\nDo NOT perform a merge of records by accessing the Metadata Editor from the Portfolio editor, as the editor remains with the deleted MMSID. The two records need to be merged by the Metadata Editor (accessed independently) and only then the Portfolio editor can be edited (after having moved to the preferred BIB).\n\nTo merge two bibliographic records using the Metadata Editor:\n\nLocate the two bibliographic records that you want to merge. The primary record will be updated with the information from the secondary record.\n\nEdit both records so that they both appear under the Records tab in the Metadata Editor.\n\nFrom the Navigation pane under the Records tab, select the primary record.\n\nSelect the Split Editor icon and select the secondary record so that it appears on the right.\n\nSelect Record Actions > Merge Records & Combine.\n\nThe Merge Records and Combine Inventory dialog box appears.\n\nWhen doing Merge & Combine, the inventory of the secondary (non preferred) record to be moved is shown in the counter only if it is a local record. This is true in both the below cases:\n\n- If you are logged in to the institution that has a local (cached) version of the NZ record, with inventory.\n\n- When Merge & Combine is performed in a standalone institution, where both records are local in any case.\n\nReview any messages displayed. In particular, note that this operation is not reversible.\n\nUnder You are about to move the following, the system lists the changes that will occur after the merge. In addition, holdings requests, loans, and reading lists attached to the secondary record will be updated. Plus, in a record related to the secondary record, the MMS ID specified in any of the 76X–78X fields of the related record will be changed to the MMS ID of the primary record specified in the Merge Records and Combine Inventory process.\n\nIf there are any requests, the number of requests appears. Due to a technical limitation, when there are no requests, the dialog box does not display \"0 requests\"; instead, the line about requests simply does not appear.\n\nSelect a merge routine from the drop-down list. The merge routines that appear in the list are pulled from the Merge Rules list under the Rules tab in the Metadata Editor.\n\nTo preview the merge results, select Show merge preview. Select OK to close the Merge Preview view.\n\nOptionally, select Update holdings call number. When you select this option, the system updates the call number information (using the bibliographic call number) for all the holdings associated with the primary record. This change is applied to the holdings associated with the primary record after the bibliographic merge was processed. Note that if one of the call number fields is updated in the bibliographic record, this may affect the call number that eventually appears in the holdings records.\n\nSelect how you want to handle the secondary bibliographic record (after the merge) from the following options:\n\nDelete\n\nSuppress\n\nKeep it\n\nWhen you are ready to merge the two records, select OK.\n\nIf there is a constraint that prevents merging the two bibliographic records, such as if the primary record is linked to the Community Zone, or there is a fulfillment issue with the secondary record, the system will not merge the bibliographic records and provide warning messages.\n\nFor records related to the secondary record, the Related Records status (after a merge and combine) in the Other Details tab (of search results) is updated to reflect the new relationship to the primary record only after the MMS - Build Record Relations (Repository) job is run. See MMS - Build Record Relations for more information. See Related Record Types for a full list of all of the fields that create relation between records.\n\nViewing Bibliographic Records\n\nFrom several locations in Alma you can view records read-only on the simple Record View page. For more information see Viewing Metadata Read-Only in the Simple Record View Page.\n\nManaging Bibliographic Records\n\nYou manage bibliographic records using a combination of record sets (see Resource Management Sets) and jobs (see Managing Jobs and Sets).\n\nYou may sometimes find it helpful to modify your records with tools external to Alma. Use the Tools feature in your search results that allows you to export records to an Excel spreadsheet. See Working with the Portfolio List for a description of the options Extended Export (to Excel) and Excel (current view).\n\nDeleting Bibliographic Records\n\nTo delete bibliographic records, you must have the following role:\n\nCataloger Extended\n\nTo delete an individual bibliographic record:\n\nRecords need to be localized before they can be deleted in the Metadata Editor. To do so, see Remove Community Zone Bibliographic Records without Portfolios from the Institution Zone.\n\nUsers are able to delete a Network Zone bibliographic record from the Institution tab, even if the record has its origins in the Community Zone.\n\nRecords marked for Bibliographic Record Retention are prevented from being deleted. For more information, see Bibliographic Record Retention.\n\nSelect Delete Bibliographic Record from the Metadata Editor toolbar under Record Actions.\n\nA bibliographic record can be deleted only when there are:\n\nNo PO lines\n\nClosed PO lines\n\nCanceled PO lines\n\nNo Active Purchase Requests\n\nIf you delete a bibliographic record in the Institution Zone, and you're the last library in the consortium to hold it, the record is deleted automatically in the Network Zone. If you do not want it to be deleted automatically in the NZ, but would like to delete it manually from the Network Zone instead, set the delete_nz_bib_without_inventory customer parameter (Configuration > Resources > General > Other Settings) to false (see Configuring Other Settings (Resource Management)).\n\nWhen deleting a bibliographic record that originated from the community zone, a notification message is displayed to the user indicating the community zone record is not deleted, only the local record is deleted.\n\nDeleting Sets of Bibliographic Records\n\nTo run a batch delete job on bibliographic records, you must have one of the following roles:\n\nCatalog Administrator\n\nCatalog Manager\n\nYou can batch delete bibliographic records that are not connected to active orders or other records in the database (optional), and, for collaborative network-managed records, are not linked to local member institution records.\n\nSets for the batch delete job can be saved from an All titles repository search.\n\nTo delete sets of bibliographic records:\n\nRun the Delete bibliographic records job. Records that cannot be deleted due to one of the conditions described above are identified in the job report.\n\nSelect the \"Delete all associated inventory resources\" option if you would like to delete the inventory associated with these records.\n\nFor more information, see Running Manual Jobs on Defined Sets.\n\nRecords marked for Bibliographic Record Retention are prevented from being deleted. For more information, see Bibliographic Record Retention.\n\nBibliographic Record Retention\n\nAlma enables libraries to prevent the deletion of a bibliographic record. To implement this, the Bibliographic Collection Retention Definition table (Configuration menu > Resources > Collection Retention > Bibliographic Collection Retention Definition) can be configured. Administrators can specify conditions for record retention. Add a field and subfield in order for the record to be protected from deletion if the subfield contains any value. Alternatively, specify a specific value, and only records with that value in the subfield are retained.\n\nAfter configuring the table, Alma performs verifications when attempting to delete a bibliographic record. It verifies if the record contains the specified content from the table. If the content is present, the bib record is protected from deletion. Furthermore, after the table is updated, any record that matches the defined criteria will be marked as committed to retain the next time it is indexed (when changed and saved, or during the semi-annual re-indexing). This allows for the retained records to be searchable within the system.\n\nIn the case of network zone records, the retention policy is determined based on the configuration specified in the Network Zone table. When attempting to delete a bibliographic record that is linked to the Community Zone, the removal of the linked record from the local institution is restricted based on the specific configuration set by that institution. Local extension fields cannot be used as retention fields. A field that is used in the Institution Zone without being a local extension may be used as a retention field.\n\nUsing Linked Data While Working with Bibliographic Records\n\nWhile working with bibliographic records in the Metadata Editor, the record's linked data information is available by clicking View Related Data > View Linked Data. Linked library data are external resources pertaining to the title, such as a search for the title in an online repository, or authority records related to the title. For more information regarding linked data, see https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/alma/integrations/linked_data.\n\nThe Linked Data List panel displays the following information:\n\nVocabulary field - This is pulled according to context. The default context is cname.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/[format]/[works_or_instances]/[MMSID]. For example, bgu.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/bf/instances/9922819700121.\n\nIf there is an active Linked Data integration profile (see Linked Data) with a path to a context, this context is used.\n\nAny former Alma URI format is redirected to the new Alma URI format: cname.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/[format]/[works_or_instances]/[MMSID].\n\nIf an institution prefers, they can change the beginning of the web address (URL prefix) from cname.alma.exlibrisgroup.com to their own or any other prefix. For example, bgu.ac.il. This change can be made in the linked data integration profile, and records will be resolved as long as the domain is registered to the same IP address by the institution’s IT department.\n\nYou do not need to create a Linked Data integration profile to access linked data from the Alma Repository Search results. However, you are required to expose linked data in the JSON-LD format (see Linked Data for more information).\n\nLinked data URI\n\nLinked Data for bibliographic records that are linked to IdRef authorities now also generate URIs to the IdRef authority records.\n\nLabel - For ISBN, ISSN, and OCLC, the field content is displayed. For creator and subject, the value of the heading is displayed.\n\nSelect the URI link of interest to access the linked data.\n\nFor more information, see the Linked Data Services video (1:50 min.).\n\nSee Linked Data from the Repository Search Results for more information regarding linked data in Repository Search.\n\nHandling UTF Composed/Decomposed Unicode Representations (UTF-8 and Characters with Diacritics)\n\nAlma supports normalizing decomposed characters to their composed form when saving a bibliographic or authority record.\n\nFor example, the word Amélie can have two canonically equivalent Unicode forms:\n\nWith this functionality, when records containing these characters are saved, the decomposed form (0065+0301) will be normalized to the composed form (00e9).\n\nWhen you set Alma to handle UTF composed/decomposed representations, you also avoid heading updates in the preferred term correction job. In cases where the bibliographic record's heading and authority heading have the same equivalent UTF representation (composed vs. decomposed), the PTC skips the correction. This filters out the redundant headings update from the Authority Task Control List and publishing.\n\nNote that this can be defined for all Alma records, or for specific local vocabularies.\n\nThis feature is disabled by default. Contact Ex Libris staff to activate it in coordination with your institution."
