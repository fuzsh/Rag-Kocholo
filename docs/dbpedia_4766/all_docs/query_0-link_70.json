        "text": "Cataloging\n\nCataloging new books / items in Librarika platform is super easy. We have tried our level best to keep the interface simplified, so that our librarians can spent more time with their daily duties instead of working with complex cataloging tools.\n\nOur simplified cataloging interface enables novice user or people with very limited experience to manage their library perfectly. This makes Librarika a suitable platform for schools, small colleges, corporate offices, NGOs, personal libraries where dedicated skilled librarians are not always available.\n\nBasics\n\nLibrarika organizes books under two logical entities: Media and Media Copy. When a new book is added to a library, master book information is added once as Media entity, we also call this as title or title record. Other related info is added to the Media Copy entity with reference to the parent Media entity. Then when another copy of the same book is added, only a new Media Copy entity is created with reference to the previous parent Media entity.\n\nMedia entity\n\nContains non-repeating fields such as title, ISBN, ISBN13, description, abstract, publisher, authors, cover photos etc.\n\nMedia Copy entity\n\nContains uniquely identifiable data such as accession number, copy number, location, branch as well as some other information related to the copy.\n\nRelationship\n\nMedia (Single) | --- Media Copies (Multiple)\n\nAccession number:\n\nWhen a new item is added to the catalog, the system assigns an auto-generated unique incremental accession number (numeric only) to each copy for your library. This accession number is then used to uniquely identify that specific copy during check-out / check-in / other system level activities.\n\nSystem usually assigns this number starting from 1. The auto generation logic for new accession number is as below:\n\naccession_number = max(accession_number) + 1\n\nThe same accession number field is used to generate barcode labels. If you plan to use barcode labels, you may need to start with a larger number (such as 100001) as some barcode scanner can not read small barcode properly.\n\nThe auto generation of accession number doesn't happen when you do bulk import of books or items. In this case, system saves the value of accession number field right from the provided source file without checking the uniqueness. This is to provide the flexibility to the librarians so that they can migrate their existing barcodes easily.\n\nTips: If you edit the accession number of a book copy to 100001 which is the max accession value in your library, then next accession will be 100002. You can use this tips to start your library's accession number from any arbritary position.\n\nTips: If your existing barcode labels are numeric digit then you can add them as accession number by following the instructions in custom barcode section.\n\nMedia\n\nYou can access all your catalog items along with their associated copy's information from the Dashboard -> Catalogs -> Catalog Items section. Clicking on the View icon next to a Catalog Item will display the item detail containing all the copies. You can edit / modify / delete those information for this same detail page.\n\nHere if you click on the Identifiers column then you can sort the catalog items using different types of identifier like isbn, isbn13, issn, asin and more.\n\nSmart Add\n\nSmart add method lets you easily add book's information from the Internet. All you need is the ISBN number to catalog a new book.\n\nNote: Please treat this smart add method as an added feature, not a complete replacement of the Manual Add method.\n\nTo use this method, please follow the below steps:\n\nPlease go to the Dashboard -> Catalogs -> Catalog Items section.\n\nClick on the Smart Add button.\n\nEnter the ISBN number of the book you want to add to your catalog.\n\nAccession number is an auto incremental number generated by our system.

You are free to make any changes to the newly created copy record as you feel necessary.\n\nThough Smart Add gets book information from various sources, there is no guarantee that it will get every book information from the Internet even if they are available.\n\nManual Add\n\nYou can add item using our Manual Add method.

Only alphanumeric characters (10-character) are allowed for this field.\n\nLCCN: This field is intended for libraries with cataloged collections in the Library of Congress.\n\nDDC: Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) is a system used by libraries to arrange books by subject. It is the most widely used system for organizing library collections worldwide.\n\nOCLC: OCLC numbers are particularly useful for books and other bibliographic materials that do not have ISBNs. These numbers link WorldCat's records to local library system records by providing a common reference key for a record across libraries.\n\nUPC: Short for Universal Product Code, UPC is a barcode symbology consisting of twelve numeric characters that uniquely identify a company's individual product. It is widely used in most countries.\n\nIn the Tags field you can add single or multiple tags for your library catalog item.
