        "text": "Uses of UIDs\n\nThe most widely known use of unique identifiers occurs when users register for a website or service. Customers are often provided with a username or user ID that allows the company they are registering with to differentiate them within their user logs. These identifiers are then also used for security and log on purposes.\n\nIn a database or spreadsheet, unique identifiers may be designated as a specific column or field to help make sorting and filtering through information easier. This also helps trace information back to a specific user or entity within the system.\n\nAnother popular application of UIDs is in a physical supply chain. Manufacturers often mark individual pieces of a larger component, such as computer parts, or an entire product with a serial number. This allows users to trace back the origin of the product in case of a malfunction, defect or recall.\n\nUnique identifiers are also commonly used within the healthcare industry. Instead of reporting medical information with a patient’s name, a personal code is created. This code combats issues of patient privacy as well as eliminates the possibility of duplicate reports.\n\nUID vs IUID vs UII\n\nWithin the Department of Defense (DoD), there are three related acronyms associated with the standard of government property. The first is the Item Unique Identification (IUID) Registry. This registry stores information for the DoD about how to track, maintain and deploy government assets. Items are added to the IUID Registry if their acquisition cost is over five thousand dollars, they are mission critical or they are high risk.\n\nThe second and third acronyms are connected with each item in the registry. An item’s UID is the physical marking on the item, typically in the form of a barcode, that distinguishes it from other items. An item’s unique item identifier (UII) refers to its entry value in a database. UIIs are usually machine-readable and help contractors track each item digitally through all stages of its lifecycle."
