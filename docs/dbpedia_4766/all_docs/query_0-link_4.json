Field 039 was defined in 1980 to allow an organization to characterize the fullness of various cataloging aspects of records contributed to a national database.\n\nFirst indicator position specified the standard against which the data were applied (0 = U.S. national level bibliographic record; 8 = Other); the second indicator was undefined. The subfield codes and the defined codes for each were: $a Level of rules used in bibliographic description (0 = No level defined by rules, 1 = Minimal, 2 = Less than full, 3 = Full); $b Level of effort used to assign nonsubject heading access points (2 = Less than full, 3 = Full); $c Level of effort used to assign subject headings (0 = None, 2 = Less than full, 3 = Full); $d Level of effort used to assign classification (0 = None, 2 = Less than full, 3 = Full); $e Number of fixed field character positions coded (0 = None, 1 = Minimal, 2 = Most necessary, 3 = Full)."
