        "text": "Document History\n\nAbstract\n\nThe abstract describes what the application profile is about. It should contain a problem definition, the standards described by the application profile and the goal of the application profile.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe namespace info:eu-repo is registered at http://info-uri.info\n\nThis name space is an authoritive placeholder for semantic terms, controlled vocabularies and identifiers.\n\nBy using this namespace all the terms used have a \"web presence\". Therefore it is no longer an arbitrary string, but contains meaning. This utilisation makes it future-proof.\n\nThe info:eu-repo URIs are persistent identifiers for non-informational resources. Such non-informational resources include classifications and \"real world objects\". One important category is concepts; concepts are classes or properties. For these a subclass of the info:eu-repo URIs is introduced: the info:eu-repo/semantics URIs. The info URIs are not resolvable which makes them ideal as persistent identifiers of abstract things like concepts. On the other hand there is a need to link the URIs to their semantics. In the Semantic Web this is done by a redirection to a RDF document in which the semantic relations of the object for which the URI stands are described. We propose a service that supports URIs of the following form: http://purl.org/info:eu-repo/... (which is the same as http://www.purl.org/info:eu-repo/... - default hostname is \"www\"). The URI http://purl.org/info:eu-repo/semantics URIs results in a 302 redirection to a RDF document in which the concepts for which the URIs stand are described.The namespace is an authoritive placeholder for semantic terms, controlled vocabularies and identifiers. By using this namespace all the terms used have a \"web presence\". Therefore it is no longer an arbitrary string, but contains meaning. This utilisation makes it future-proof.The purpose of the info:eu-repo registry is not to create a comprehensive, complete ontology. Instead its purpose is to fill holes. The registry introduces terms with which existing ontologies can be complemented and connected with each other.\n\nThe following types have been identified for controlled vocabularies and identifiers.\n\nhttp://purl.org/info:eu-repo/semantics/*\n\nhttp://purl.org/info:eu-repo/classification/*\n\nhttp://purl.org/info:eu-repo/date/*\n\nhttp://purl.org/info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/*\n\nhttp://purl.org/info:eu-repo/dai/*\n\nPractice\n\nThe http://purl.org/info:eu-repo/semantics URIs will be linked to URIs that stand for concepts from other vocabularies. E.g., several of the terms from Eprints Type Vocabulary Encoding Scheme (http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Eprints_Type_Vocabulary_Encoding_Scheme) are owl:sameAs terms from info:eu-repo/semantics:\n\n<info:eu-repo/semantics/article> <owl:sameAs> <http://purl.org/eprint/type/JournalArticle>\n\nIn the case a concept is already defined in another vocabulary, the concept gets a eu-repo/semantics URI if\n\n• the semantics of the concept is not described by that vocabulary\n\n• the concept is relevant for repositories\n\nA review board is needed for checking of these criteria. The maintainer of the registry should see to it that a requested term is checked through http://sameas.org. All owl:sameAs relations can be accessed via this service. On short term SURFShare is able to do this. On the long term KNAW might be able to do it.\n\nProjects used for input\n\nDRIVERGuidlines (DRIVER)\n\nProject SamenInDelen (SamenInDelen)\n\nNEEO Technical guidelines (NEEO)\n\nUse of MODS for institutional repositories (SURFshare)\n\nOpenAIRE Guidelines v2(OpenAIRE)\n\nUser community\n\nIt is important to know who is using this namespace. When changes and modifications happen, we need to be able to contact these people, so they can tell others about changes. This makes the propagation of change possible.\n\nVacancies: currently this wiki page with attachments needs a moderator. Volunteers are welcome. Send a mail to vanderfeesten@surf.nl or sommeren@surf.nl\n\nDigital Author Identifier\n\nClassification Schemes\n\nXML Schema's and ontologies\n\nThe publicationTypes Schema can be referenced via a purl.org link, see below for available schema's.\n\nPublication types\n\n?\n\nconferenceObject of Driver includes all other conference-related publications. This can be used if none of the more specific publicationtypes comply.\n\nWithin conferenceObject are two types: conferenceProceedings as proposed by NEOO and ConferenceItem from the vocabulary of UKOLN. The type conferenceProceedings is used for authors who want to include the conference proceedings of which they are the editor. It is helpful if conference proceedings are contained in the repositories as compound objects. ConferenceItem is not really necessary, because there are more specific types who cover all sorts of ConferenceItems: ConferencePaper and conferenceContribution. The distinction between these two subtypes is the whether or not it's included in conference proceedings.\n\nconferenceContribution has a subtype: conferencePoster. Not published readings for a conference are a conferenceObject, a ConferenceItem and a ConferenceContribution.\n\nThe class-subclass relations can be represented with the following hierarchy.\n\nThe term conferenceContribution is confusing. A more clear term is concerenteItemNotInProceedings. The proposal is to adopt conferenceObject, conferenceProceedings, conferencePaper, conferenceItemNotInProceedings, conferenceContribution (owl:sameAs conferenceNotInProceedings; the latter is the preferred term) and conferencePoster in the info:eu-repo/semantics namespace. If we specify in a more formal way the semantic relations, we can use ConferenceItem from the UKOLN vocabulary.\n\nThe new situation can be visualised as follows:\n\nThe proposal is to use conferenceProceedings, conferencePaper and conferencePoster within SURFshare. conferenceItemNotInProceedings can be used as rest category\n\nMappings with SWAP\n\nUse for publication types identifiers from the info:eu-repo/semantics/ namespace, see the first column of the following table. E.g., the URI for articles is info:eurepo/semantics/article. The second column contains the vocabulary of the Eprints Application Profile (also known as Scholarly Works Application Profile - SWAP) (http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Eprints_Type_Vocabulary_Encoding_Scheme). This vocabulary is included only for comparison reasons.\n\nMappings with Metis\n\nThere is a need to conduct a general agreement on the mapping result of species as proposed by the Metis Metis Group Results on the types of information: eu-repo/semantics. A first attempt is the following table.\n\nAccess Rights\n\nSAME AS the e-prints accessRights property in the Scholarly Works Application Profile\n\nsee: http://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/\n\nGrant Agreement Identifiers\n\nNon verbose\n\nVerbose\n\nAlternative Identifier\n\nSupported Schemes\n\nReference Identifier\n\nSupported Schemes\n\nDataset Identifier\n\nSupported Schemes\n\nVersions\n\nObject types\n\nDate of submission of the resource."
