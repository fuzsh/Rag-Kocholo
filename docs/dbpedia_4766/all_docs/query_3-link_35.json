        "text": "Assigning OS IDs:\n\nEvery facility listed in OS Hub has an OS ID. This is a 15-character unique identifier made up of 4 segments:\n\nCN 2019067 NZ95A M\n\nFrom left to right these segments are:\n\nA 2-character country code.\n\nThe 4-digit year and 3-digit day of the year indicating when the OS ID was assigned.\n\n5 characters that represent a random number.\n\nA one character “check digit” that is calculated based on the previous 14 characters and can be used to validate that an OS ID has not been mistyped or otherwise damaged.\n\nWhen a facility is first created in OS Hub, it is automatically allocated its own ID. Anyone can access and make use of these IDs, for free.\n\nOS IDs can enable interoperability between databases and act as a “clearing” ID against which multiple systems can connect. Using facility IDs, rather than names, as a central reference point eliminates confusion surrounding facility identification and helps stakeholders across sectors quickly reach an understanding of shared connections at the facility level. They can be incorporated into internal systems, such as PLMs or sourcing platforms, shared on public-facing dashboards, or displayed on customer-facing supplier lists, to demonstrate commitments to transparency in service of collaboration.\n\nData Moderation:\n\nTo ensure that each OS ID points to a unique and clean facility profile, alongside the automated work of OS Hub’s algorithm, the OS Hub team continually moderates data in the tool to:\n\nEvaluate and eliminate potential duplicates\n\nPromote higher quality data on facility profiles\n\nUpdate GPS coordinates\n\nOS Hub’s technical team also runs regular training exercises to refine the algorithm and related moderation tools, to continue to create the highest quality, open dataset possible.\n\nLearn more about what is and isn’t considered a duplicate facility in OS Hub.\n\nView OS Hub’s full moderation policy.\n\nSpotted a duplicate in our data? Have access to more accurate GPS coordinates for a facility? Click the flag icon on a facility profile to share that with the OS Hub team."
