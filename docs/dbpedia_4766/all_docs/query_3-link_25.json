These IDs originate from stored IDs in cookies, mainly first-party cookies and device IDs found in smartphones, tablets, and other devices.\n\nWhile some universal IDs function within a specific environment, like web browsers, others strive to identify users across multiple environments, such as web browsers and mobile devices. In the latter case, device graphs correlate the IDs generated in web browsers with those generated on other devices, such as mobile smartphone IDs.\n\nQuick Travel"
