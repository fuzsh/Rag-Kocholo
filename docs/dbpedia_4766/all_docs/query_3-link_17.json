        "text": "Everything marketers need to know about Universal Identifiers (UIDs) and their crucial role in post-cookie marketing and advertising.\n\nWith cookie deprecation looming, you’ve likely heard Universal Identifiers propped up as a cookie replacement. The industry is hard at work creating solutions that replace cookies and maintain your marketing and advertising use cases. As more updates roll out, here’s what you need to know.\n\nUniversal Identifiers are identifiers that are mapped to an individual user\n\nUIDs are generated by obtaining an email address and using a one-way hashing algorithm to generate the id. An email may be gathered when a user logs into a website, when a user trades an email to unlock content, or when a user buys a product.\n\nUniversal identifiers differ from third-party cookies\n\nUIDs require user consent, are cryptographically secure, and cannot be mapped back to personally identifiable information, like name or gender.\n\nThere are many different companies offering Universal ID solutions at the moment including Liveramp, The Trade Desk, ID5, LiveIntent, and several others. Each may be generated differently, and are likely to include different pools of users.\n\nAre you prepared for post-cookie marketing and advertising?
