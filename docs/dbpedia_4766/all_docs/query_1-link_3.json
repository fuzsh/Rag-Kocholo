        "text": "Universal ID solutions seem to be all the rave in 2024 as organizations scramble to find alternatives to third-party cookies.\n\nYet, it is surprisingly difficult to get a clear, easy-to-understand picture of these solutions, how they work, and what choices are available on the market.\n\nIn this article, we solve that issue by giving you a rundown of Universal ID solutions, before explaining how we at Didomi can assist you with implementing them.\n\nSummary\n\nWhat are Universal ID solutions?\n\nBenefits of Universal ID solutions\n\nExamples of Universal ID solutions\n\nHow can Didomi help implement Unique IDs?\n\nUnique IDs: Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nWhat are Universal ID solutions?\n\nIdentity (ID) solutions, sometimes called Universal ID solutions, are an alternative to third-party cookies that can help identify a person across digital environments using a unique identifier built upon one or a set of attributes.\n\nThese solutions generally fall into three distinct categories or approaches:\n\nDeterministic ID solutions rely on relatively permanent attributes such as email addresses, phone numbers, and home addresses. While highly specific, these solutions are harder to implement at scale.\n\nProbabilistic ID solutions use more temporary attributes, from IP addresses to user agents and device details. These solutions lack precision but can offer greater scale.\n\nHybrid ID solutions combine both approaches.\n\nIn layman's terms, Universal ID solutions aim to assign users an ID that can follow them online, feeding a profile to offer better, more targeted experiences. The leading solutions are built with data privacy in mind, using data minimization and security principles such as hashing and encryption to comply with regulations and prevent the risk of data breaches.\n\nWhy the need for Universal ID solutions?\n\nThe emergence of these new technologies comes as a result of the regulatory and business changes in the digital space in the past few years, as mentioned by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Tech Lab in a guide published on the topic of ID solutions updated this year:\n\nUniversal ID solutions are particularly relevant to advertisers, marketers, and publishers for a variety of use cases, from campaign planning (e.g., matching or discovering audiences) to activation (e.g., buying or selling impressions for specific segments) and attribution (e.g., reporting on clicks, reach, or frequency).\n\nBenefits of Universal ID solutions\n\nAmong the main benefits of Universal ID solutions for companies, the most commonly cited are:\n\nUnique identifiers are more persistent and “stickier” than third-party cookies\n\nChoices are applied everywhere, across all environments, across devices and sites.\n\nID solutions allow universe-to-universe matching, ie, aligning and reconciling different audience data sets from multiple sources.\n\nThey allow measurement capabilities outside of Google, such as Safari and Firefox.\n\nOn the other hand, ID solutions are restricted (for now) by their limited adoption and fragmented nature. While third-party cookies offered a universal solution for companies, the lack of interoperability between universal ID providers requires organizations to make extra efforts to put together a comprehensive strategy.\n\nOf course, Universal ID solutions also impact end users. The main benefits for general consumers online are:\n\nImproved personalization: Universal ID solutions enable better tracking and understanding of user preferences across devices and platforms, allowing for better ad personalization.\n\nConsistent user experience (UX): Universal ID solutions help maintain a consistent user experience by providing persistent identifiers, making interactions smoother and more cohesive.\n\nReduced ad and consent fatigue: By identifying users throughout their journey, Unique IDs can help manage the frequency of ads shown to them, preventing fatigue and improving their overall ad experience.\n\nUniversal ID and consent\n\nIt’s important to remember that Universal ID solutions do not exempt organizations from collecting consent.\n\nOn the contrary, they rely on consent as a legal basis for processing data and, as such, a Consent Management Platform (CMP) to collect, manage, store, and leverage that consent. This is where Didomi comes in.\n\nExamples of Universal ID solutions\n\nHow can Didomi help you implement an ID solution?\n\nWhile Didomi does not provide native integrations with Unique ID providers, our API allows them to work with our solutions to collect and manage consent. We support these initiatives and collaborate with these providers to further the development of robust alternatives to third-party cookies for our clients.\n\nWe worked with Utiq, for example, to develop a Didomi x Utiq implementation guide that you can access on their website to start integrating our solutions.\n\nDespite a common misconception, alternatives to third-party cookies do not exempt you from collecting consent, which remains the main legal basis for most data processing activities, including those leveraged by Universal ID solutions.\n\nOur Consent Management Platform (CMP), as such, remains a critical part of the equation. To learn more about how we enable Universal ID solutions in our solutions and how you can get started, book a call with one of our experts:\n\nUniversal ID solutions: Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nWill Universal ID solutions replace the need for Consent Management Platforms (CMP)?\n\nNo, Universal ID solutions will not replace the need for a Consent Management Platform (CMP). These solutions rely on user consent and, as such, require a way to collect, store, and leverage consent (such as a CMP) to function.\n\nWhat is the impact of Universal ID solutions on end-users?\n\nUniversal ID solutions can enhance the user experience (improved personalization, reduced consent, and ad fatigue) while reinforcing the importance of user consent and data privacy, ensuring end-users are protected and informed about how their data is used.\n\nWhat are the main differences between Unique IDs and third-party cookies?\n\nUnique IDs and third-party cookies serve similar purposes in tracking and identifying users across digital environments but operate differently.\n\nWhile third-party cookies are stored in the user's browser and can be accessed by any website that includes the third-party's code, Unique IDs are often based on more persistent attributes like email addresses or device IDs, making them more stable and harder to block.\n\nHow do Universal ID solutions handle user consent and privacy?\n\nUniversal ID solutions rely on explicit user consent for data processing and tracking and often incorporate privacy-enhancing technologies to protect user data and provide transparency and control to users over how their data is used.\n\nWhat are some common use cases for Universal ID solutions in marketing?\n\nUniversal ID solutions are used in various marketing activities, including audience targeting and segmentation, cross-device tracking, personalization of content and ads, campaign measurement and attribution, frequency capping, and fraud detection.\n\nThese solutions help marketers deliver users more relevant and personalized experiences while optimizing their advertising spend."
