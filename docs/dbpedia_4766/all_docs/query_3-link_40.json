The RESO Universal Parcel Identifier (UPI) was created to simply and consistently record facts about a property against a unique identifier.\n\nThe UPI is a straightforward standard that can be built into property records. It is currently in version 2.0 with a new, URN-based model for universal uniqueness (the name was also updated to more accurately describe the parcel identifier vs. property identifier). It organizes standard components into a model that can be supported by any organization: codes for country and region assigning parcel numbers, the parcel numbers themselves, and subcomponents of the property.\n\nSome of the industry’s largest MLS software and public records companies distribute the UPI in their property records API services. With the UPI in property records at the source point for new listings, downstream data consumers can accurately identify properties and attach additional information to these records consistently. | DETAILED UPI SPECIFICATION\n\nThe RESO UPI Workgroup\n\nThe RESO UPI Workgroup brings subject matter experts in real estate listing and public records data together to support and improve the model over time. Adoption of the standard by large public-facing real estate technology companies and B2B data providers has made the UPI a critical starting point for attaching robust real estate data to property records with these unique identifiers. | LEARN MORE ABOUT THE UPI WORKGROUP\n\nUPI Builder"
