        "text": "Q: What is the impact factor (IF) of the journal with the number ISSN: 2350-1488?\n\nAsked on Mar 2, 2020\n\nPlease Log In to post an answer.\n\n1 Answer to this question\n\nAnswer:\n\nThis journal has the generic name ‘ISSN Journals.’ Also, there is a cluster of journals in various disciplines, each with their own International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), within this journal. The journal is managed by Dr JK Research Foundation, Chennai, India. However, while there is a site for the journal, there is none for the managing organization. There seems to be no mention of the journal’s IF on the site, or on any of the databases we searched, such as the Master Journal List (MJL) and the ISSN Portal. This could be due to several reasons.\n\nThe journal may not be well established, and so, few or none of the papers published in it would have received citations.\n\nIt is not clear how old the journal is. If it is less than two years old, it will not have an IF, as IF is calculated for citations received in the previous two years.\n\nIt could be a predatory or bogus journal. When we evaluated it against our checklist for identifying predatory publishers, it seems legitimate in some aspects (such as having an editorial board and a nominal price for publishing open access) but not in some aspects (such as having a generic name and not having any information about its parent organization). So, rather than a predatory journal, it may just be, as we already mentioned, that it’s not a well-established journal.\n\nIf you are considering submitting to this journal, you will need to keep the above points in mind and proceed accordingly.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nWhat is the impact factor of the journal ISSN: 0092-8674?\n\nWhy a journal's ISSN does not reflect its quality\n\nChasing the impact factor: Is it worth the hassle?\n\nAnswered by Editage Insights 3 Mar, 2020\n\nResources for authors and journals"
