        "text": "Contains the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). ISSNs consist of eight digits in two groups of four, separated by a hyphen. Use for ISSNs found in New Serial Titles, other Bowker serials publications, or in the issue being cataloged so that the record can be authenticated by the National Serials Data Program.\n\nNote: This field is used for both serials and integrating resources.\n\nThe final character of an ISSN is a calculated check character, either numeric, 0-9, or X. It is used to identify and eliminate typographical errors.\n\nWhen you validate a record containing field 022, the system checks the ISSN in subfield Ça to verify that the content and length are correct and that the check character matches the calculated check character.\n\nIf there is an error in the ISSN (e.g., the ISSN is too long or too short, lacks a hyphen after the fourth digit, or has an invalid check digit), the system displays an error message and the ISSN remains in subfield Ça. If you made a typographical error, correct the ISSN and validate the record again. If the error message appears again and you transcribed the ISSN exactly, the ISSN is in error. Put the ISSN in subfield Çy ."
