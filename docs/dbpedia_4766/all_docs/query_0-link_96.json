The presence of chemoresistant cells has been used to explain this high mortality rate. These higher tumorigenic and chemoresistant cells involve cancer stem cells (CSCs), which have the potential for self-renewal, a cell differentiation capacity, and a greater tumorigenic capacity. Our research group identified gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) with the CD24+CD44+CD326+ICAM1+ immunophenotype isolated from gastric cancer patients. Interestingly, this GCSC immunophenotype was absent in cells isolated from healthy people, who presented a cell population with a CD24+CD44+CD326+ immunophenotype, lacking ICAM1. We aimed to explore the role of ICAM1 in these GCSCs; for this purpose, we isolated GCSCs from the AGS cell line and generated a GCSC line knockout for ICAM1 using CRISPR/iCas9, which we named GCSC-ICAM1KO. To assess the role of ICAM1 in the GCSCs, we analyzed the migration, invasion, and chemoresistance capabilities of the GCSCs using in vitro assays and evaluated the migratory, invasive, and tumorigenic properties in a zebrafish model. The in vitro analysis showed that ICAM1 regulated STAT3 activation (pSTAT3-ser727) in the GCSCs, which could contribute to the ability of GCSCs to migrate, invade, and metastasize. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the GCSC-ICAM1KO cells lost their capacity to migrate, invade, and metastasize, but they exhibited an increased resistance to a cisplatin treatment compared to their parental GCSCs; the GCSC-ICAM1KO cells also exhibited an increased tumorigenic capability in vivo.

This autoantibody causes steric interference between Dsg1 and 3 and the loss of cell adhesion, producing acantholysis. This molecule and its cellular effects are clinically reflected as intraepidermal blistering. Pemphigus vulgaris-IgG (PV-IgG) binding involves p38MAPK-signaling-dependent caspase-3 activation. The present work assessed the in vitro effect of PV-IgG on the adherence of HaCaT cells dependent on caspase-3. PV-IgG induced cell detachment and apoptotic changes, as demonstrated by annexin fluorescent assays. The effect of caspase-3 induced by PV-IgG was suppressed in cells pre-treated with caspase-3-shRNA, and normal IgG (N-IgG) as a control had no relevant effects on the aforementioned parameters. The results demonstrated that shRNA reduces caspase-3 expression, as measured via qRT-PCR and via Western blot and immunofluorescence, and increases cell adhesion. In conclusion, shRNA prevented in vitro cell detachment and the late effects of apoptosis induced by PV-IgG on HaCaT cells, furthering our understanding of the molecular role of caspase-3 cell adhesion dependence in pemphigus disease.

This domain has been first described in the HMGA protein family of architectural factors and later in various transcription factors and chromatin proteins, often in association with major groove DNA-binding domains. In this review, using a literature search, we identified about one hundred AT-hook-containing proteins, mainly chromatin proteins and transcription factors. After considering the prototypes of AT-hook-containing proteins, the HMGA family, we review those that have been studied in more detail and that have been involved in various pathologies with a particular focus on cancer. This review shows that the AT-hook is a domain that gives proteins not only the ability to interact with DNA but also with RNA and proteins. This domain can have enzymatic activity and can influence the activity of the major groove DNA-binding domain and chromatin docking modules when present, and its activity can be modulated by post-translational modifications. Future research on the function of AT-hook-containing proteins will allow us to better decipher their function and contribution to the different pathologies and to eventually uncover their mutual influences.

We evaluated, in in vitro cellular models, the ability of different classes of drugs currently used in IBD to counteract two pivotal processes of intestinal fibrosis, the differentiation of intestinal fibroblasts to activated myofibroblasts using CCD-18Co cells, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of intestinal epithelial cells using Caco-2 cells (IEC), both being processes induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). The drugs tested included mesalamine, azathioprine, methotrexate, prednisone, methylprednisolone, budesonide, infliximab, and adalimumab. The expression of fibrosis and EMT markers (collagen-I, α-SMA, pSmad2/3, occludin) was assessed by Western blot analysis and by immunofluorescence. Of the drugs used, only prednisone, methylprednisolone, budesonide, and adalimumab were able to antagonize the pro-fibrotic effects induced by TGF-β1 on CCD-18Co cells, reducing the fibrosis marker expression. Methylprednisolone, budesonide, and adalimumab were also able to significantly counteract the TGF-β1-induced EMT process on Caco-2 IEC by increasing occludin and decreasing α-SMA expression. This is the first study that evaluates, using in vitro cellular models, the direct antifibrotic effects of drugs currently used in IBD, highlighting which drugs have potential antifibrotic effects.

Since animal intestines lack oxygen, while fermented foods provide a limited or more oxygen environment, this study aimed to investigate whether there were genetic differences in the growth of Lb. plantarum under aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions. Genomic analysis of Lb. plantarum obtained from five sources—animals, dairy products, fermented meat, fermented vegetables, and humans—was conducted. The analysis included not only an examination of oxygen-utilizing genes but also a comparative pan-genomic analysis to investigate evolutionary relationships between genomes. The ancestral gene analysis of the evolutionary pathway classified Lb. plantarum into groups A and B, with group A further subdivided into A1 and A2. It was confirmed that group A1 does not possess the narGHIJ operon, which is necessary for energy production under limited oxygen conditions. Additionally, it was found that group A1 has experienced more gene acquisition and loss compared to groups A2 and B. Despite an initial assumption that there would be genetic distinctions based on the origin (aerobic or anaerobic conditions), it was observed that such differentiation could not be attributed to the origin. However, the evolutionary process indicated that the loss of genes related to nitrate metabolism was essential in anaerobic or limited oxygen conditions, contrary to the initial hypothesis.

These chronic diseases, including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), can significantly impact patient quality of life and are still incurable in the vast majority of the cases. This review examines the mechanobiology within a bone marrow niche, emphasizing the role of mechanical cues and the primary cilium in the pathophysiology of MPNs. It discusses the influence of extracellular matrix components, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and mechanosensitive structures on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) behavior and disease progression. Additionally, the potential implications of the primary cilium as a chemo- and mechanosensory organelle in bone marrow cells are explored, highlighting its involvement in signaling pathways crucial for hematopoietic regulation. This review proposes future research directions to better understand the dysregulated bone marrow niche in MPNs and to identify novel therapeutic targets.

The primary cause is mutations in the ABCA4 gene, leading to the accumulation of toxic byproducts in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and subsequent photoreceptor cell degeneration. Over the past few years, research on Stargardt disease has advanced significantly, focusing on clinical and molecular genetics. Recent studies have explored various innovative therapeutic approaches, including gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and pharmacological interventions. Gene therapy has shown promise, particularly with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors capable of delivering the ABCA4 gene to retinal cells. However, challenges remain due to the gene’s large size. Stem cell therapy aims to replace degenerated RPE and photoreceptor cells, with several clinical trials demonstrating safety and preliminary efficacy. Pharmacological approaches focus on reducing toxic byproduct accumulation and modulating the visual cycle. Precision medicine, targeting specific genetic mutations and pathways, is becoming increasingly important. Novel techniques such as clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 offer potential for directly correcting genetic defects. This review aims to synthesize recent advancements in understanding and treating Stargardt disease. By highlighting breakthroughs in genetic therapies, stem cell treatments, and novel pharmacological strategies, it provides a comprehensive overview of emerging therapeutic options.

PCO occurs when residual lens epithelial cells (LECs) migrate and proliferate after cataract surgery, differentiating into fibroblastic and lens fiber-like cells. This study aims to show and compare the bio-macromolecular profiles of primary LEC cultures and postoperative lens epithelia LECs on basal laminas (bls), while also analyzing bls and cultured LECs separately. Using synchrotron radiation-based Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) microspectroscopy at the Spanish synchrotron light source ALBA, we observed that the SR-FTIR measurements were predominantly influenced by the strong collagen absorbance of the bls. Cultured LECs on bls showed a higher collagen contribution, indicated by higher vas CH3, CH2 and CH3 wagging and deformation, and the C–N stretching of collagen. In contrast, postoperative LECs on bls showed a higher cell contribution, indicated by the vsym CH2 peak and the ratio between vas CH2 and vas CH3 peaks. The primary difference revealed using SR-FTIR is the greater LEC contribution in spectra recorded from postoperative lens epithelia compared to cultured LECs on bls. IR spectra for bl, cultured LECs and postoperative lens epithelia could be valuable for future research.

By analogy with steroid 5α-reductase, genetic deficiency exists in AKR1D1 which leads to errors in newborn metabolism and in this case to bile acid deficiency. Also, like the 5α-dihydrosteroids (e.g., 5α-dihydrotestosterone), the 5β-dihydrosteroids produced by AKR1D1 are not inactive but regulate ligand access to nuclear receptors, can act as ligands for nuclear and membrane-bound receptors, and regulate ion-channel opening. For example, 5β-reduction of cortisol and cortisone yields the corresponding 5β-dihydroglucocorticoids which are inactive on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and provides an additional mechanism of pre-receptor regulation of ligands for the GR in liver cells. By contrast, 5β-pregnanes can act as neuroactive steroids at the GABAA and NMDA receptors and at low-voltage-activated calcium channels, act as tocolytic agents, have analgesic activity and act as ligands for PXR, while bile acids act as ligands for FXR and thereby control cholesterol homeostasis. The 5β-androstanes also have potent vasodilatory properties and work through blockade of Ca2+ channels. Thus, a preference for 5β-dihydrosteroids to work at the membrane level exists via a variety of mechanisms. This article reviews the field and identifies gaps in knowledge to be addressed in future research.

We analyzed the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota in two MPS III siblings with the same mutation (c.544C > T, c.1080delC, in the SGSH gene) and the same diet, but with differences in their GISs, including recurrent diarrhea in one of them. Using 16S sequencing, we observed that the MPS III patients exhibited decreased alpha diversity and a lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Bifidobacteriaceae accompanied by a higher abundance of the Ruminococcaceae and Rikenellaceae families than the healthy control subjects. Comparing siblings, we found an increased abundance of Bacteroidaceae and a lower abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Akkermansiaceae in the GIS-free patient. This patient also had a higher relative abundance of Sus genes (SusA, SusB, SusE, and SusG) involved in glycosaminoglycan metabolism. We found higher HS levels in the stool of the two MPS III patients than in healthy volunteers, particularly in the patient with GISs. Functionally, whole fecal metabolites from the patient with GISs induced oxidative stress in vitro in healthy monocytes. Finally, the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain isolated from MPS III stool samples exhibited HS degradation ability. Overall, our results reveal different microbiota compositions and functionalities in MPS III siblings, who exhibited differential gastrointestinal symptomatology. Our study may serve as a gateway to explore the impact of the gut microbiota and its potential to enhance the quality of life in Sanfilippo syndrome patients.

Traditional anti-angiogenic therapies that target the VEGF pathway have shown promise but are often associated with significant side effects and variable efficacy due to the complexity of the angiogenic signaling pathway. This review highlights the potential of a specific VEGF splice form, VEGF165b, as an innovative therapeutic target for HNSCC. VEGF165b, unlike standard VEGF, is a natural inhibitor that binds to VEGF receptors without triggering pro-angiogenic signaling. Its distinct molecular structure and behavior suggest ways to modulate angiogenesis. This concept is particularly relevant when studying HNSCC, as introducing VEGF165b’s anti-angiogenic properties offers a novel approach to understanding and potentially influencing the disease’s dynamics. The review synthesizes experimental evidence suggesting the efficacy of VEGF165b in inhibiting tumor-induced angiogenesis and provides insight into a novel therapeutic strategy that could better manage HNSCC by selectively targeting aberrant vascular growth. This approach not only provides a potential pathway for more targeted and effective treatment options but also opens the door to a new paradigm in anti-angiogenic therapy with the possibility of reduced systemic toxicity. Our investigation is reshaping the future of HNSCC treatment by setting the stage for future research on VEGF splice variants as a tool for personalized medicine.

Early-stage breast cancer is curable in ~70–80% of patients, while advanced metastatic breast cancer is considered incurable with current therapies. Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease categorized into three main subtypes based on key markers orientating specific treatment strategies for each subtype. The complexity of breast carcinogenesis is often associated with epigenetic modification regulating different signaling pathways, involved in breast tumor initiation and progression, particularly by the methylation of arginine residues. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT1-9) have emerged, through their ability to methylate histones and non-histone substrates, as essential regulators of cancers. Here, we present an updated overview of the mechanisms by which PRMT1 and PRMT5, two major members of the PRMT family, control important signaling pathways impacting breast tumorigenesis, highlighting them as putative therapeutic targets.

Following exposure to the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein, some patients experienced a lack of response to the biological drug Adalimumab and a recrudescence of the disease. In CD patients in progression, resistant to considered biological therapy, an abnormal increase in intestinal permeability was observed, more often with a modulated expression of different proteins such as Aquaporin 8 (AQP8) and in tight junctions (e.g., ZO-1, Claudin1, Claudin2, Occludin), especially during disease flares. The aim of this study is to investigate how the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could interfere with IBD therapy and contribute to disease exacerbation. We investigated the role of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, transported by extracellular vesicles (EVs), and the impact of various EVs components, namely, exosomes (EXOs) and microvesicles (MVs), in modulating the expression of molecules involved in the exacerbation of CD, which remains unknown.

Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMFs) have shown potential in improving tendon fiber structure and muscle recovery. However, the molecular effects of PEMF therapy on skeletal muscle, beyond conventional metrics like MRI or markers of muscle decline, remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the metabolic and structural changes in PEMF-treated muscle tissue using proteomics in a rat model of Achilles tendinopathy induced by collagenase. Sprague Dawley rats were unilaterally induced for tendinopathy with type I collagenase injection and exposed to PEMFs for 8 h/day. Gastrocnemius extracts from untreated or PEMF-treated rats were analyzed with LC-MS/MS, and proteomics differential analysis was conducted through label-free quantitation. PEMF-treated animals exhibited decreased glycolysis and increased LDHB expression, enhancing NAD signaling and ATP production, which boosted respiratory chain activity and fatty acid beta-oxidation. Antioxidant protein levels increased, controlling ROS production. PEMF therapy restored PGC1alpha and YAP levels, decreased by tendinopathy. Additionally, myosins regulating slow-twitch fibers and proteins involved in fiber alignment and force transmission increased, supporting muscle recovery and contractile function. Our findings show that PEMF treatment modulates NAD signaling and oxidative phosphorylation, aiding muscle recovery through the upregulation of YAP and PGC1alpha and increasing slow myosin isoforms, thus speeding up physiological recovery.

In recent years, the amount of data describing peptide sequences and function collected in open repositories has substantially increased, allowing the application of more complex computational models to study the relations between the peptide composition and function. This work introduces AMP-Detector, a sequence-based classification model for the detection of peptides’ functional biological activity, focusing on accelerating the discovery and de novo design of potential antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMP-Detector introduces a novel sequence-based pipeline to train binary classification models, integrating protein language models and machine learning algorithms. This pipeline produced 21 models targeting antimicrobial, antiviral, and antibacterial activity, achieving average precision exceeding 83%. Benchmark analyses revealed that our models outperformed existing methods for AMPs and delivered comparable results for other biological activity types. Utilizing the Peptide Atlas, we applied AMP-Detector to discover over 190,000 potential AMPs and demonstrated that it is an integrative approach with generative learning to aid in de novo design, resulting in over 500 novel AMPs. The combination of our methodology, robust models, and a generative design strategy offers a significant advancement in peptide-based drug discovery and represents a pivotal tool for therapeutic applications.

Both bind to three G protein-coupled receptors, namely PAC1, VPAC1 and VPAC2, to elicit their beneficial effects in various CNS diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, we assessed the expression and distribution of PACAP/VIP receptors in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of MS donors with a clinical history of either relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), primary MS (PPMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) or in aged-matched non-MS controls. Gene expression studies revealed MS-subtype specific changes in PACAP and VIP and in the receptors’ levels in the NAWM, which were partly corroborated by immunohistochemical analyses. Most PAC1 immunoreactivity was restricted to myelin-producing cells, whereas VPAC1 reactivity was diffused within the neuropil and in axonal bundles, and VPAC2 in small vessel walls. Within and around lesioned areas, glial cells were the predominant populations showing reactivity for the different PACAP/VIP receptors, with distinctive patterns across MS subtypes. Together, these data identify the differential expression patterns of PACAP/VIP receptors among the different MS clinical entities. These results may offer opportunities for the development of personalized therapeutic approaches to treating MS and/or other demyelinating disorders.

The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these adverse effects remain elusive. Here, in a mouse model of PD, we investigated the effects of the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R)-preferring agonist pramipexole (PPX) on decision-making. PD model mice were generated using a bilateral injection of the toxin 6-hydroxydopamine into the dorsolateral striatum. Subsequent treatment with PPX increased disadvantageous choices characterized by a high-risk/high-reward in the touchscreen-based Iowa Gambling Task. This effect was blocked by treatment with the selective D3R antagonist PG-01037. In model mice treated with PPX, the number of c-Fos-positive cells was increased in the external globus pallidus (GPe), indicating dysregulation of the indirect pathway in the corticothalamic-basal ganglia circuitry. In accordance, chemogenetic inhibition of the GPe restored normal c-Fos activation and rescued PPX-induced disadvantageous choices. These findings demonstrate that the hyperactivation of GPe neurons in the indirect pathway impairs decision-making in PD model mice. The results provide a candidate mechanism and therapeutic target for pathological gambling observed during D2/D3 receptor pharmacotherapy in PD patients.

To date, the heat stress response in rainbow trout is more widely understood at the transcriptional level, while little research has been conducted at the translational level. To reveal the translational regulation of heat stress in rainbow trout, in this study, we performed a ribosome profiling assay of rainbow trout liver under normal and heat stress conditions. Comparative analysis of the RNA-seq data with the ribosome profiling data showed that the folding changes in gene expression at the transcriptional level are moderately correlated with those at the translational level. In total, 1213 genes were significantly altered at the translational level. However, only 32.8% of the genes were common between both levels, demonstrating that heat stress is coordinated across both transcriptional and translational levels. Moreover, 809 genes exhibited significant differences in translational efficiency (TE), with the TE of these genes being considerably affected by factors such as the GC content, coding sequence length, and upstream open reading frame (uORF) presence. In addition, 3468 potential uORFs in 2676 genes were identified, which can potentially affect the TE of the main open reading frames. In this study, Ribo-seq and RNA-seq were used for the first time to elucidate the coordinated regulation of transcription and translation in rainbow trout under heat stress. These findings are expected to contribute novel data and theoretical insights to the international literature on the thermal stress response in fish.
