        "text": "The phasing out of third-party (3P) cookies presents both challenges and opportunities for advertisers.\n\nAt Zeotap, we are committed to staying ahead by leveraging Universal IDs (UIDs), which ensure our clients can activate data seamlessly in a cookieless world and run campaigns with equal or even improved results. Regardless of Google’s actions concerning third-party cookies, advertisers and agencies need to collect permissioned data, activate audiences, and measure outcomes.\n\nThis blog post explores what Universal IDs are, how they compare with 3rd party cookies, why they are crucial for the future of digital advertising, and how they are utilised at Zeotap.\n\nUIDs are a modern solution for user identification, tracking and activation in the digital advertising ecosystem, addressing many of the limitations and privacy concerns associated with traditional third-party cookies.\n\nThe key Universal IDs in Europe include ID5, EUID and Zeotap ID+, all of which are gaining traction in the industry.\n\nUIDs utilise numerous data points to assign an ID to a user. Hashed email addresses (collected from consented, logged-in users) are among the most commonly utilised deterministic signals, together with hashed phone numbers. IP address, user agent, device specifications are also highly valuable to identify a user; these and similar signals fuel UID’s that allow for probabilistic id resolution.\n\nUIDs and cookies are both used for tracking and identifying users on the internet, but they differ in several fundamental ways.\n\nFirst of all, UIDs enable more precise personalisation due to the persistent nature of the identifiers across the advertising ecosystem. 3P Cookies, in contrast, are limited in their ability to deliver personalised experiences due to browser restriction limits: 3P cookies are restricted or fully blocked by default by multiple browsers, reducing their longevity and effectiveness.\n\nIn addition, UIDs function cross-site and cross-device, leading to more accurate and comprehensive user profiles. In contrast, 3P cookies are domain-specific, forming a more fragmented view.\n\nLastly, designed with privacy regulations in mind, UIDs often come with built-in consent management and privacy protections, making them more compliant with modern data protection laws. Meanwhile, cookies are increasingly seen as non-compliant with privacy regulations, leading to a decline in their usage and adoption in the ecosystem.\n\nAt Zeotap, we strive for an open, effective, privacy-compliant digital advertising ecosystem, and believe UID’s are a powerful solution to the current industry changes. Therefore, we have built our own proprietary UID ID+, and are partnering with multiple other UIDs. ID5 is already an integral part of our ID graph, and we are continuing to work with other industry players to ensure superior capacity to activate.\n\nOur clients can readily use UID’s as the currency for audience activation, be it their own client data, or a 3rd party segment:\n\nClient Data Activation: Our Customer Data Platform (CDP) clients can extend their first-party (1P) data to Universal IDs and activate it downstream. This capability allows them to continue targeting and personalizing ads in a cookieless environment.\n\nThird-Party Data Segments: Our 3P data segments include Universal IDs, facilitating activation in environments where 3P cookies are no longer viable.\n\nBy leveraging our comprehensive cookieless solution, advertisers can future-proof their campaigns and enhance personalised, compliant advertising strategies. Our CDP ensures easy, secure, and impactful data management, enabling seamless activation across the programmatic ecosystem. With our data-driven approach, we focus on building, selling, and servicing the most effective audiences, thereby maximising incremental reach and results.
