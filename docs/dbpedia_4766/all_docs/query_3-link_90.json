        "text": "Welcome to your weekly update on the performance of Universal/Extended/Alt ID in the European and North American bidstreams.\n\nThe North America part is new. üôÇ\n\nYou‚Äôve been asking us to share universal/extended/alt ID insights to help make decisions about your identity infrastructure today and in the future, so that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôll get in this tracker. It‚Äôs a race to replace third-party cookies before Q1 2025.\n\nRoqad has a front row seat to the European and North American universal ID landscape (among others), and while we can‚Äôt speak for every single bid transaction, we have a pretty good view of what is happening.\n\nClick here to sign up to receive alerts for updates\n\nAugust 20, 2024 release (Week #30) ‚Äì EUROPE\n\nEurope | Group 4: some more of the higher volume IDs (0.01% ‚Äì 0.10% range)\n\nEurope | Group 3: some more of the higher volume IDs (0.10% ‚Äì 1.0% range)\n\nEurope | Group 2: some of the higher volume IDs in (1.0% ‚Äì 9.0% range)\n\nEurope | Group 1: the leaders\n\nEurope | Synthetic ID numbers\n\nEurope | Top 10 Weekly Gain\n\nEurope | Top 10 Yearly Gain\n\nEurope | ID Leader Board\n\nAugust 20, 2024 release (Week #32) ‚Äì USA & Canada\n\nNorth America | Group 4: some more of the higher volume IDs (0.03% ‚Äì 0.5% range)\n\nNorth America | Group 3: some more of the higher volume IDs (0.5% ‚Äì 1.0% range)\n\nNorth America | Group 2: some of the higher volume IDs (1.0% ‚Äì 5% range)\n\nNorth America | Group 1: the leaders\n\nNorth America | Synthetic ID Numbers\n\nNorth America | Top 10 Weekly Gain\n\nNorth America | Top Yearly Gain\n\nNorth America | ID Leader Board\n\n\\Universal IDs (also called ‚Äòextended‚Äô IDs or alt IDs) are trending up and to the right. We expect the trend to continue.\n\nObviously the deterministic data set is dominated by third-party cookies.\n\nNote that a Publisher can set 20 third-party cookies per page/per user if they like, and we would see them all in the bidstream.\n\nMobile advertising identifiers are limited to one at a time.\n\nThere are more publishers using Prebid (pubcid.org) right now. Prebid allows publishers to use more than one identifier on the same page at the same time.\n\nWhy use several different IDs at once? Big publishers are probably covering their bets to make sure their ad inventory is being used.\n\nThe so-called third-party cookie apocalypse didn‚Äôt happen, it‚Äôs postponed until the end of 2023, perhaps longer, so identity providers are using third-party cookies and syncs extensively as long as they‚Äôre available.\n\nYes, third-party cookies are being used to prepare for the cookie apocalypse.\n\nNo one knows who will win the identifier competition. Right now it makes sense to work with several at a time just in case.\n\nIt appears that the publisher ID problem in mobile is not being solved with a single or small group of universal IDs.\n\nidentityLink is operated by LiveRamp.\n\nRe: the ‚ÄúBritepool‚Äù ID. Britepool merged with bigtoken.com in 2021. Apparently they kept the original Britepool ID name. BigToken actually has an interesting product concept. From their website: You can use the BIGtoken application to manage your digital data and identity and earn rewards when your data is purchased. Third-party applications and sites access BIGtoken to learn more about their consumers and earn revenue from data sales made through their platforms.\n\nThere are three main buckets of identifiers:\n\n#1 ‚Äì Bucket A: Partner and time stamp encrypted, which is helpful for capturing revenue for the provider.\n\n#2 ‚Äì Bucket B: Partner specific encryption. Think UID 2.0 in the US (not yet available in the EU), and NetID in Germany. The design is focused on user privacy protection.\n\n#3 ‚Äì Bucket C: Unencrypted IDs. The other reason for an unencrypted ID is that the provider wants to give the internet a transactable currency. If you leave it unencrypted, then maybe it‚Äôll drive usage.\n\nThe full list of identifiers observed in the European bidstream:\n\n33across.com\n\nadnxs.com\n\nadobe.com\n\nadserver.org\n\naol.com\n\nbeeswax.com\n\nbritepool.com\n\ncriteo.com\n\nid5sync.com\n\nidentityLink\n\nidfv\n\ninvibes.com\n\nkrux.com\n\nmediamath.com\n\nnetid.de\n\nneustar.biz\n\nparrable.com\n\npubcid.org\n\npubcommon\n\npubmatic.com\n\nquantcast.com\n\nrubiconproject.com\n\nsharedid.org\n\nsmartadserver.com\n\nsovrn.com\n\ntdid\n\nuidapi.com\n\nzeotap.com\n\nyahoo.com\n\nNow you have a front-row seat to the tracker and we‚Äôll keep an eye on these trends week to week. I think we can all agree that it will be interesting to revisit a few months from now to see how the tides are turning.\n\nWe expect to see more techniques that are preparation for the big cookie apocalypse, similar to what we‚Äôre seeing with pubcid.org and publishers using multiple identifiers per page.\n\nAccordingly, we expect to see some movement in data volumes amongst the identifier providers. The top 5 by volume probably won‚Äôt change in the near term, but the next 10 could see some movement.\n\nIf you‚Äôre ready to have a conversation about including Roqad‚Äôs graph in your identity spine, give us a shout.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://docs.prebid.org/overview/intro-to-header-bidding.html\n\nhttps://github.com/prebid/Shared-id-v2\n\nhttps://www.publift.com/blog/bidstream-data\n\nhttps://bigtoken.com/faq/#general_0\n\nSign up for ID Tracker updates‚Ä¶\n\nName(Required)\n\nFirst Last\n\nCompany Name(Required)\n\nCompany Email(Required)\n\nOpt-In\n\nI agree to receive other communications from Roqad\n\nAbout The Author\n\nJoe Cha\n\nJoe Cha is a marketing director with Roqad.\n\nHe has created content marketing projects for machine learning / artificial intelligence companies for the last 3 years.
