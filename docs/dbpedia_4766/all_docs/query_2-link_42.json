Compared with traditional AC power grids, flexible DC power grids have strong technical advantages in islanding power supplies, distributed power supplies, regional power supplies, and AC system interconnection. In multi-terminal flexible DC power grids containing renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, due to the instability and intermittency of renewable energy, it is usually necessary to add energy storage units to pre-regulate the power of the multi-terminal flexible DC power grid in islanded operation. Aiming at the important problem of large current impact and serious consequences when the flexible DC distribution network fails, a combined location method combining an improved impedance method (series current-limiting reactors at both ends of the line to obtain a more accurate current differential value) and a particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed. Initially, by establishing the enhanced impedance model, the differential variables under the conditions of inter-electrode short-circuit and single-pole grounding fault can be obtained. Then tailor-made fitness functions are designed for these two models to optimize parameter identification. Subsequently, the iterative parameters of the particle swarm optimization algorithm are fine-tuned, giving it dynamic sociality and self-learning ability in the iterative process, which significantly improves the convergence speed and successfully avoids local optimization. Finally, various fault types in a six-terminal DC distribution network are simulated and analyzed by MATLAB, and the results show that this method has good accuracy and robustness. This research provides strong theoretical and methodological support for improving the safety and reliability of DC distribution systems.

However, the current problem of data imbalance affecting classification results in the field of personal credit assessment has not been fully solved. In order to solve this problem better, we propose a data-enhanced classification algorithm based on a Pixel Convolutional Neural Network (PixelCNN) and a Generative Adversarial Network (Wasserstein GAN, WGAN). Firstly, the historical data containing borrowers’ borrowing information are transformed into grayscale maps; then, data enhancement of default images is performed using the improved PixelCNN-WGAN model; and finally, the expanded image dataset is inputted into the CNN, AlexNet, SqueezeNet, and MobileNetV2 for classification. The results on the real dataset LendingClub show that the data enhancement algorithm designed in this paper improves the accuracy of the four algorithms by 1.548–3.568% compared with the original dataset, which can effectively improve the classification effect of the credit data, and to a certain extent, it provides a new idea for the classification task in the field of personal credit assessment.

As such, ensuring customer satisfaction is critical for companies working in this field. One way to achieve this is by providing an accurate delivery time estimation. While companies can track couriers via GPS, they often lack real-time data on traffic and road conditions, complicating delivery time predictions. To address this, a range of statistical and machine learning techniques are employed, including neural networks and specialized expert systems, with different degrees of success. One issue with neural networks and machine learning models is their heavy dependence on vast, high-quality data. To mitigate this issue, we propose two Bayesian generalized linear models to predict the time of delivery. Utilizing a linear combination of predictor variables, we generate a practical range of outputs with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling method. These models offer a balance of generality and adaptability, allowing for tuning with expert knowledge. They were compared with the PSIS-LOO criteria and WAIC. The results show that both models accurately estimated delivery times from the dataset while maintaining numerical stability. A model with more predictor variables proved to be more accurate.

However, such chatbot models were developed as tools to support natural language communication between humans. Problematically, it is very much a “statistical correlation machine” (correlation instead of causality), and there are indeed ethical concerns associated with the use of AI language models including ChatGPT, such as bias, privacy, and abuse. This paper highlights specific ethical concerns about ChatGPT and articulates key challenges when ChatGPT is used in various applications. Practical recommendations for different stakeholders of ChatGPT are also proposed that can serve as checklist guidelines for those applying ChatGPT in their applications. These best practice examples are expected to motivate the ethical use of ChatGPT.

Therefore, power self-synchronization control (PSSC) is first introduced for enhancing the small-signal stability of grid-forming control in the case of a short circuit ratio ranging from 1 to infinity. Meanwhile, the transient synchronization instability for the grid-forming converter with PSSC in the grid fault condition is analyzed by the phase portrait, and a transient stability enhancement control (TSEC) scheme is combined with a PSSC-based VSC, which can efficiently eliminate the risk of losing synchronization in the arbitrary SCR. Finally, experimental results are provided to confirm the theoretical analysis.

Firstly, the mechanism by which the access of the PV and ES to the distribution network impacts the node voltage is explored. Then, the unit regulation cost of a photovoltaic inverter and energy storage power is studied. On this basis, the voltage–cost sensitivity is proposed based on the traditional node power–node voltage sensitivity. According to the differences between each group of regulation resources, a multi-stage voltage over-run control strategy based on grouping cooperation is proposed. Finally, the improved 33-node model is taken as an example to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this study, we compared three cutting-edge deep learning frameworks for dermoscopic segmentation: U-Net, SegAN, and MultiResUNet. We used a dermoscopic dataset including detailed lesion annotations with segmentation masks to help train and evaluate models on the precise localization of melanomas. SegAN is a special type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that introduces a new architecture by adding generator and discriminator steps. U-Net has become a common strategy in segmentation to encode and decode image features for limited data. MultiResUNet is a U-Net-based architecture that overcomes the insufficient data problem in medical imaging by extracting contextual details. We trained the three frameworks on colored images after preprocessing. We added incremental Gaussian noise to measure the robustness of segmentation performance. We evaluated the frameworks using the following parameters: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Dice and Jaccard coefficients. Our accuracy results show that SegAN (92%) and MultiResUNet (92%) both outperform U-Net (86%), which is a well-known segmentation framework for skin lesion analysis. MultiResUNet sensitivity (96%) outperforms the methods in the challenge leaderboard. These results suggest that SegAN and MultiResUNet are more resistant techniques against noise in dermoscopic segmentation.

Throughout the entire distribution process of the supply chain, it is crucial to closely monitor the propagation paths and dynamics of electrical data to ensure security and quickly initiate comprehensive traceability investigations if any data tampering is detected. This research addresses the challenges of data network complexity and its impact on the security of power systems by proposing an innovative data network propagation path tracing model, which is constructed based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and the BERT model. Firstly, propagation trees are constructed based on the propagation structure, and the key attributes of data nodes are extracted and screened. Then, GCNs are utilized to learn the representation of node features with different attribute feature combinations in the propagation path graph, while the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model is employed to capture the deep semantic features of the original text content. The core of this research is to effectively integrate these two feature representations, namely the structural features obtained by GCNs and the semantic features obtained by the BERT model, in order to enhance the ability of the model to recognize the data propagation path. The experimental results demonstrate that this model performs well in power data propagation and tracing tasks, and the data recognition accuracy reaches 92.5%, which is significantly better than the existing schemes. This achievement not only improves the power system’s ability to cope with data security threats but also provides strong support for protecting data transmission security and privacy.

The industry currently lacks an objective quantitative environmental–visual comfort index that combines subjective and objective indicators. For this experiment, objective eye movement and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were collected in combination with a subjective questionnaire survey and a preference inquiry for comprehensive data mining. Finally, the results on a Likert scale show that high screen brightness can reduce the visual fatigue of subjects under high illuminance and high correlated color temperature (CCT). Pupil data show that, under medium and high ambient illuminance, visual perception sensitivity is more likely to be stimulated, and visual fatigue is more likely to deepen. EEG data show that visual fatigue is related to illuminance and screen brightness. On this basis, this study proposes a new evaluation index, the visual comfort level (0.6404 average at a low screen brightness, 0.4218 average at a medium screen brightness, and 0.5139 average at a high screen brightness), where a higher score for the visual comfort level represents a better visual experience. The visual comfort level provides a useful reference for enhancing the processing of multi-dimensional and biomedical signals and protecting the eyes.

However, the accuracy and effectiveness of object detectors are often constrained by the obscuration of object features and details in adverse weather conditions. Therefore, this paper presented the DAN-YOLO vehicle object detector specifically designed for driving conditions in adverse weather. Building on the YOLOv7-Tiny network, SPP was replaced with SPPF, resulting in the SPPFCSPC structure, which enhances processing speed. The concept of Hybrid Dilated Convolution (HDC) was also introduced to improve the SPPFCSPC and ELAN-T structures, expanding the network’s receptive field (RF) while maintaining a lightweight design. Furthermore, an efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) mechanism was introduced to enhance the effectiveness of feature fusion. Finally, the Wise-IoUv1 loss function was employed as a replacement for CIoU to enhance the localization accuracy of the bounding box (bbox) and the convergence speed of the model. With an input size of 640 × 640, the DAN-YOLO algorithm proposed in this study achieved an increase in mAP0.5 values of 3.4% and 6.3% compared to the YOLOv7-Tiny algorithm in the BDD100K and DAWN benchmark tests, respectively, while achieving real-time detection (142.86 FPS). When compared with other state-of-the-art detectors, it reports better trade-off in terms of detection accuracy and speed under adverse driving conditions, indicating the suitability for autonomous driving applications.

Particular interest in semiconductor metal oxide (SMO) sensors has recently been observed. This is due to their easy fabrication process, high control over the final product (dopants, posttreatment, etc.), and high concentration of oxygen vacancies, by which they show significant changes in electrical properties when exposed to analyte. In this review, different types of sensors are described and categorized. Importantly, their limitations, challenges and principles of sensing mechanism are also discussed, wherein attention is primarily paid to semiconductor metal oxide (SMO) oxygen sensors. This comprehensive review provides an in-depth analysis of the existing literature on planar SMO oxygen sensors, focusing on various materials, fabrication techniques, and sensing mechanisms. It also critically assesses the challenges and limitations in current research, offering insights into future directions for developing highly efficient and reliable sensors. Currently, most oxygen resistive sensors are a few micrometers thick and operate at high temperatures, which leads to high power consumption. To highlight importance of this topic, a market overview is also presented.

However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are used for sequence recognition tasks, face two main challenges, respectively: the ineffective utilization of global information and slow processing speeds due to sequential operations. To address these issues, this paper introduces CTRNet, a novel automatic modulation recognition network that combines a CNN with Transformer. This combination leverages Transformer’s ability to adequately capture the long-distance dependencies between global sequences and its advantages in sequence modeling, along with the CNN’s capability to extract features from local feature regions of signals. During the data preprocessing stage, the original IQ-modulated signals undergo sliding-window processing. By selecting the appropriate window sizes and strides, multiple subsequences are formed, enabling the network to effectively handle complex modulation patterns. In the embedding module, token vectors are designed to integrate information from multiple samples within each window, enhancing the model’s understanding and modeling ability of global information. In the feedforward neural network, a more effective Bilinear layer is employed for processing to capture the higher-order relationship between input features, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to capture complex patterns. Experiments conducted on the RML2016.10A public dataset demonstrate that compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm not only exhibits significant advantages in terms of parameter efficiency but also achieves higher recognition accuracy under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, it performs relatively well in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with clearer classification of higher-order modulations and notable overall accuracy improvement.

As such, HAR is increasingly applied in human–computer interaction, healthcare, and other fields, making accurate and efficient recognition of various human activities. In recent years, deep learning methods have been extensively applied in sensor-based HAR, yielding remarkable results. However, complex HAR research, which involves specific human behaviors in varied contexts, still faces several challenges. To solve these problems, we propose a multi-head neural network based on the attention mechanism. This framework contains three convolutional heads, with each head designed using one-dimensional CNN to extract features from sensory data. The model uses a channel attention module (squeeze–excitation module) to enhance the representational capabilities of convolutional neural networks. We conducted experiments on two publicly available benchmark datasets, UCI-HAR and WISDM, to evaluate our model. The results were satisfactory, with overall recognition accuracies of 96.72% and 97.73% on their respective datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the network structure for the HAR, which ensures a higher level of accuracy.

However, their investigation is user-dependent and prone to measurement errors. An important technical problem is the objective difficulty in studying a very compliant blood vessel like IVC, which makes large respirophasic movements and shows a complicated three-dimensional geometry. Using bi-dimensional (2D) B-mode views either in a long or short axis has improved the characterization of IVC dynamics compared to measurements along a single direction (M-mode). However, specific movements of the IVC can also challenge the information provided by these 2D sections. Thus, these two orthogonal views, provided by an US system in the X-plane, are integrated here using an innovative method. It is tested on simulated videos of the IVC by performing complicated movements, which are compensated by the new method, overcoming the biased measurements provided by 2D scans. The method is then applied on example experimental data.

This paper proposes a method for reconstructing the vehicle coordinate system based on machine vision, which can be applied to the offline calibration of ADAS. Firstly, this study explains the preliminary preparations, such as the selection of feature points and the choice of camera model, combining actual application scenarios and testing requirements. Subsequently, the YOLO model is trained to identify and obtain feature regions, and feature point coordinates are extracted from these regions using template matching and ellipse fitting. Finally, a validation experiment is designed to evaluate the accuracy of this method using metrics such as the vehicle’s lateral and longitudinal offset distances and yaw angle. Experimental results show that, compared to traditional vehicle alignment platforms, this method improves reconstruction accuracy while reducing costs.

Aerial images present several challenges, including dense small objects, intricate backgrounds, and occlusions, necessitating robust detection algorithms. This paper addresses the critical need for accurate and efficient object detection in aerial images using a Transformer-based approach enhanced with specialized methodologies, termed DFS-DETR. The core framework leverages RT-DETR-R18, integrating the Cross Stage Partial Reparam Dilation-wise Residual Module (CSP-RDRM) to optimize feature extraction. Additionally, the introduction of the Detail-Sensitive Pyramid Network (DSPN) enhances sensitivity to local features, complemented by the Dynamic Scale Sequence Feature-Fusion Module (DSSFFM) for comprehensive multi-scale information integration. Moreover, Multi-Attention Add (MAA) is utilized to refine feature processing, which enhances the model’s capacity for understanding and representation by integrating various attention mechanisms. To improve bounding box regression, the model employs MPDIoU with normalized Wasserstein distance, which accelerates convergence. Evaluation across the VisDrone2019, AI-TOD, and NWPU VHR-10 datasets demonstrates significant improvements in the mean average precision (mAP) values: 24.1%, 24.0%, and 65.0%, respectively, surpassing RT-DETR-R18 by 2.3%, 4.8%, and 7.0%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves real-time inference speeds. This approach can be deployed on drones to perform real-time ground detection.

However, due to the varying output characteristics and response speeds of different renewable distributed energy resources (DERs), the overall response from the collective output of these distributed energy resources may not meet expected requirements and could have adverse effects on the grid. One drawback of traditional distributed coordinated control is its high communication requirements. This paper proposes using digital twin (DT) technology for the coordinated control of distributed energy resources, which can minimize the communication needs between various distributed energy resources while achieving coordinated control. Verification of the frequency support coordinated control strategy based on digital twin technology shows that it can effectively enhance the individual output characteristics and overall response of each distributed energy resource, providing effective support for grid frequency.
