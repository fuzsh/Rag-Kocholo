        "text": "ID5 has just launched a new guide for advertisers that uncovers the essential criteria for evaluating universal identifiers, as well as the pathways they can take to leverage these solutions.\n\nHaving a better understanding of the identity landscape is crucial for brands as they look to build out a solid addressability strategy. Between all the cookieless solutions available, universal identifiers (UIDs) have emerged as one of the most valuable alternatives to conventional identifiers.\n\nHowever, with the proliferation of identifiers - there are currently over 40 identifiers trying to establish themselves as valid alternatives - understanding the difference between IDs and their effectiveness is key to prioritise what to test and, eventually, adopt.\n\nUnlocking the value of cookieless: a brand's guide to leveraging universal IDs, published today (April 20th, 2023) by ID5, aims to provide brands with the knowledge and tools needed to evaluate and prioritise the identifiers that they want to test and eventually adopt to make the most of the cookieless present and prepare for the future.\n\nWithin, ID5 outlines the key criteria to differentiate UID solutions â€“ scale, data protection standards, reconciliation methodologies, interoperability, and GEO availability.\n\nBesides providing a visual representation of the top 20 ID solutions available, the guide also offers an in-depth, step-by-step outline on how to identify the universal ID best suited for their needs.\n\nIt can be daunting for brands to grasp how to work with UIDs and, as a result, can leave them stuck in the belief that they don't have the necessary tools, partnerships or capabilities in place to best leverage them. However, as the guide outlines, there is a pathway for every type of brand, meaning less confusion which should lead to more action.\n\nMarketers are facing concerns over ROI in an environment of economic uncertainty and preparing for the cookieless future. It is crucial for brands to choose the best solution to influence their demand partners to build a solid addressability strategy."
