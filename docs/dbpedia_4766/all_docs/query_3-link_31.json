        "text": "By Jarrett Wold, AD-ID and Amit Shetty, IAB Tech Lab\n\nAd-ID and the IAB Tech Lab have jointly published a white paper, “Five Use Cases for Video Ad Serving,” that demonstrates the importance of including Ad-ID as a registry value inside the UniversalAdId element in VAST 4.0. The white paper includes a collection of scenarios that focus on why the IAB Tech Lab-required Universal Ad ID —which provides a unique creative identifier and maintains it across all platforms — is important for tracking ad creative. The use cases also show how Ad-ID serves that role in the U.S. market.\n\nThe first two use cases describe issues with Server-Side Ad Insertion (SSAI) using inconsistent creative identifiers. Because Ad-ID codes provide a standard creative identifier for tracking assets across all platforms, thereby resolving these inconsistencies, the IAB Tech Lab encourages the use of a Universal Ad ID.\n\nWithout a standard identifier, two common issues occur in SSAI:\n\nDifferent identifiers are used for the same creative (e.g., Creative A with ID=AB12, AB34, AB56, etc.).\n\nThe same identifiers are used for multiple creatives (Creative A with ID=ABCD, Revision 1/Creative B with ID=ABCD, Revision 2/Creative C with ID=ABCD).\n\nThe first issue provides a poor ad experience for consumers, who may be subjected to ad repetition. In this scenario, a consumer watches content and is shown the same ad back-to-back, or even worse, back-to-back-to-back. In the second example, the wrong ad is delivered to the consumer, which is bad for the publisher/advertiser. The use cases discuss these operational challenges and how standardizing on a single registry (e.g., Ad-ID in the United States) resolves these issues.\n\nThe other three use cases focus on Client-Side Ad Serving and how using Ad-ID as the creative identifier provides value in ad decisioning to deliver high-quality ads. The use cases explain how Ad-ID’s advertising metadata can be used to obtain information at the creative asset level for competitive separation, brand safety, advertiser information, and product categorization — all critical factors for publishers looking to provide quality control and effectively deliver on campaigns.\n\nHarold Geller, executive director at Ad-ID, says, “I’m excited about the documented use cases because they provide real-world examples of the value and importance associated with using a standard identifier in meeting the needs of the publisher, advertiser, and agency.”\n\nDennis Buchheim, Senior Vice President and General Manager, IAB Tech Lab, says, “The use of the Universal Ad ID within VAST 4.0 is an important part of identity-related initiatives in the IAB Tech Lab, and helps improve brand safety, attribution, and analytics in video advertising.”\n\nThe use cases were developed with input from CBS Interactive, Extreme Reach, FreeWheel, Google, and TubeMogul.\n\nTo download a copy of the use cases, click here.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\n\nJarrett Wold, Director of Technology, Ad-ID\n\nJarrett Wold, Director of Technology & Platforms, Ad-ID, has over 15 years of experience leading Web Application Development teams focused on digital applications.
