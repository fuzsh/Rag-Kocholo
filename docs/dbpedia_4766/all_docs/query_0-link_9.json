        "text": "Contains the International Standard Book Number (ISBN). Use for canceled ISBNs, invalid ISBNs, Standard Book Numbers (SBNs), and terms of availability.\n\nAn ISBN is a unique number assigned to a resource by its publisher. Each ISBN is a 10- or 13-digit number and has four parts: the language group of the country of publication, the publisher, the title, and the check character.\n\nThirteen-digit ISBNs must begin with either 978 or 979 (a 13-digit EAN beginning with 978 or 979 may be input as a valid ISBN).\n\nIf printed in a book, catalog, or bibliography, these four parts are usually separated by hyphens, periods, or spaces. Do not enter the hyphens, periods, or spaces.\n\nNote: If the final character is a lowercase x, enter an uppercase X.\n\nSome resources contain SBNs. They are the forerunner of modern ISBNs and are nine digits in length. If the resource was published in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, or Zimbabwe, enter an initial 0 before the SBN). Enter the SBN in subfield Ça. Enter SBNs from other countries in subfield Çz.\n\nFor example, if the SBN is 717803139, enter:\n\n0717803139 Â Â Â\n\nThe final character of an ISBN is a calculated check character, either 0-9 or X. It is used to identify and eliminate typographical errors.\n\nWhen you validate a record containing field 020, the system checks subfield Ça to verify that the content and length of the ISBN are correct and that the check character matches the calculated check character.\n\nIf there is an error in the ISBN (e.g., it is too long or too short, has an incorrect character in any position, or an incorrect value in the check digit), the system displays an error message with the ISBN remaining in subfield Ça. If you made a typographical error, correct the ISBN and validate the record again. If the error message appears again and you transcribed the ISBN exactly, the ISBN is in error. Enter the ISBN in subfield Çz."
