These bodies are designated by ISO to serve as maintenance agencies or registration authorities.\n\nFor each of the standards concerned detailed information can be obtained through the respective secretariats listed below\n\nCommittee members can find more information about Maintenance Agencies in Annex G of the ISO/IEC Directives Part 1.\n\nMore information about Registration Authorities can be found in Annex H of the ISO/IEC Directives Part 1. RA forms are available here."
