        "text": "Jessica is an Accredited Practising Dietitian (APD) who takes a client-centred approach and works collaboratively with a person’s treatment team (health professionals and family members) to help them achieve their health goals. She creates a safe and empathetic environment for people, which encourages them to gradually unpack their nutritional concerns without judgement. The primary therapeutic frameworks that Jessica uses are Health at Every Size (HAES), Intuitive Eating or Non-Dieting principles. Along with such frameworks, Jessica deftly incorporates techniques like mindful eating and motivational interviewing into her practice. Since beginning her career in 2007, Jessica has gained a wide variety of experience across a broad range of clinical settings, including individual nutrition counselling, day programs, group therapy (body image and nutrition education), and program development. Although Jessica is equipped to provide nutrition support to people with a broad range of medical issues, she is particularly passionate about helping people with eating disorders (AN, BN, BED, OSFED, and ARFID), disordered eating (freedom from dieting) and mental health concerns. Jessica has previously been employed at the Body Image Eating Disorders Treatment and Recovery Service (BETRS) and The Melbourne Clinic, where she provided individual and group therapy. Her passion for the latter saw her facilitate groups on a variety of topics: support for parents with children who have an eating disorder; body image; nutrition education; mindful eating; food and mood; cooking and meal support groups. Dedicated to preventing eating disorders, Jessica has also given many interactive talks on dieting and body image to high school students. In 2010, Jessica commenced work in private practice. She has enjoyed supporting people in this way, as she has provided evidence-based nutrition advice to help them achieve better health outcomes. It takes courage to seek help and be vulnerable with health professionals; recognizing this helps Jessica to engage people in an authentic, compassionate way. Using the Non-Diet approach to health, Jessica aims to help her clients develop a healthy relationship with food and their bodies. Reconnecting with one’s hunger and fullness signals, making peace with food and learning to honour one’s body provide individuals with a firm foundation to achieve sustainable health outcomes. In addition, Jessica aims to communicate her extensive knowledge in food and nutrition in a simple, relevant, and practical manner. The different stages of life carry with them specific nutritional requirements. Jessica’s warm manner enables her to engage and communicate well with children, adolescents, and adults. Finally, Jessica is committed to helping people eat mindfully and intuitively – all so that they can truly enjoy their food whilst reaping the many health benefits."
