        "text": "Our faculty is as diverse as our residents. All have one thing in common: their desire to teach and guide our trainees to achieve their full potential. The residency program relies on their knowledge, skills, dedication, and mentorship for its success. Our residents work beside them in all areas of the department, from the emergency room and inpatient units to the outpatient adult and child services. Many of our voluntary faculty have practices in the neighborhood and are themselves alumni of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Morningside and Mount Sinai West training program. Their continued attachment to the department reflects their appreciation for the training they received and their desire to train the next generation."
