        "text": "CARY, N.C. – USA Baseball today named the 50-man roster for the 13U/14U Athlete Development Program, following the conclusion of the National Team Championships. The event will be held August 3-6 at the USA Baseball National Training Complex in Cary, North Carolina.\n\nThe Athlete Development Program (ADP) allows athletes to connect with USA Baseball coaches, task force, and national team staff to better prepare for a future national team experience. Participants will take part in on-field skills development with positional and team-fundamental drills, and a series of intrasquad games to assist in developing the athletes as both a player and a person. Additionally, the athletes will participate in off-field educational seminars while gaining additional exposure to professional scouts and college recruiters.\n\nThis year’s teams are named after USA Baseball alums and former development program participants Dylan Crews and Termarr Johnson. Crews, who was named USA Baseball’s 2023 Golden Spikes Award winner, is a four-time Team USA alum and two-time gold medalist. He played for the 2017 15U National Team, 2018 18U National Team, and 2021 and 2022 Collegiate National Teams after participating in the National Team Development Program (NTDP) in 2016 and 2018. Crews–who was recently selected second overall by the Washington Nationals in the 2023 MLB Draft–helped the stars and stripes win gold medals at the 2017 World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) U-15 Baseball World Cup Americas Qualifier and the WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup Americas Qualifier in 2018.\n\nJohnson is a two-time alum, as he was a part of the 2019 15U National Team which won gold at the WBSC U-15 Baseball World Cup Americas Qualifier after participating in the 2018 14U NTDP. He was also a member of the 2021 18U National Team, where he led the team in batting in a friendship series victory over Canada, before being selected fourth overall in the 2022 MLB Draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\n“We are excited to announce the fifty athletes who will participate in this year’s 13U/14U Athlete Development Program,” USA Baseball Director of Player Development Jim Koerner said. “Our coaches and task force members worked extremely hard at last year’s National Team Identification Series (NTIS) Champions Cup, and this summer at the National Team Championships, to identify the top talent at the 13- and 14-year-old age levels. We look forward to continuing the development of these players next week in Cary.”\n\nThe roster announcement comes following the conclusion of the National Team Championships in Arizona and North Carolina, which–along with the NTIS Champions Cup–serve as the main identification events for the ADP. Twenty-six athletes on the roster played in this year’s National Team Championships, while 21 were selected from last year’s NTIS Champions Cup. Overall, 30 athletes are new to USA Baseball programming this year.\n\nTen players from the 2022 ADP return for this year’s edition of the program, as Brady Bickham (Claremont, Calif.), Caden Borcherding (McDonough, Ga.), Chase Cotton (Lincoln, Calif.), Zachary Estrada (Covina, Calif.), Aaron Garcia (Pico Rivera, Calif.), AJ LaSota (Woodland Hills, Calif.), Griffin McKain (Fort Mill, S.C.), Jacob Melendez (Perris, Calif.), Blake Ragsdale (Burr Ridge, Ill.), and Jacob Seamon (Waxhaw, N.C.) will participate once again.\n\nAdditionally, 13 players on the 2023 ADP roster have played on a past 12U National Team. Colin Anderson (Evans, Ga.), Anthony Frausto III (New Braunfels, Texas), Levi Kerr (Marvin, N.C.), Eli Martinez (Beaumont, Calif.), and Cristian Matos (Belleville, N.J.) will reunite in Cary after helping the stars and stripes win gold at the 2022 WBSC U-12 Baseball World Cup. Bickham, Easton Brunson (Highlands, Texas), Cotton, Jackson Fetters (China Spring, Texas), Garcia, Caleb Hudson (Carrolton, Ga.), Julian Martinez (New York, N.Y.), and Seamon were members of the 2021 12U National Team.\n\nKoerner will serve as the field coordinator for the event, while Georgia Southern assistant coach AJ Battisto will act as the pitching coordinator and 2000 Olympic gold medalist Mike Kinkade will be the hitting coordinator.\n\nPenn State head coach Mike Gambino will lead Team Termarr Johnson, and will be joined by pitching coach Kirk Champion (Southern Illinois) and JD Pruitt (Coastal Alabama Community College). Likewise, Rice University assistant coach Paul Janish will lead Team Dylan Crews, and will be joined by pitching coach Brett Tomko and assistant coach Xan Barksdale.\n\nFor more information on the Athlete Development Program, follow @USABDevelops on Twitter or visit USABaseball.com.\n\n2023 13U/14U Athlete Development Program Roster\n\n(Name; Position; Hometown)"
