        "text": "4-year-old's rare birth defect inspires blinding love\n\nChristian Buchanan paces the perimeter of the room, gliding his small hand along the blue painted wall as he walks.\n\nWith each object he touches in his path, his mom produces a name.\n\nChair. Television.\n\nHe matches that with the bits of conversation he collects from the adults around him.\n\nAppointment. Vaccination.\n\n\"Doctor's room,\" he says.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nChristian's fourth birthday was just a few weeks ago, a snowy, gift-giving affair with a taste of blue icing.\n\nNow it's time for the next ritual in aging, the yearly checkup.\n\nThis doctor's visit, unlike many others in his past, should be fairly normal. That is with one exception — his vision test.\n\nChristian doesn't really have eyes.\n\nThe rambunctious, blond-haired, boy was born with a birth defect so rare that it's hard to say exactly how many documented cases there are in the world. His mother, Lacey Buchanan, has been told that with a case as severe as Christian's, perhaps it could be as few as 50. Medical experts at Vanderbilt couldn't put a number to it, only to say it's extremely unusual.\n\nIt's called Tessier Cleft Lip and Palate, a condition Lacey describes while threading her fingers together.\n\n\"His face,\" she says, \"wasn't knit together.\"\n\nBut his heart is whole.\n\nAnd as I watch Christian walk through a day filled with therapies, a doctor's appointment, and moments of play, I see a tremendous love between mother and child.\n\nOne unbound by circumstance.\n\nHeartbroken\n\nChristian's parents were blindsided, in every sense of the word.\n\nTeen sweethearts who met at a church down the road from their Woodbury, Tenn., home in rural Rutherford County, the couple learned Lacey was pregnant right before their second wedding anniversary.\n\nThe elation was fleeting.\n\nAt the 18-week ultrasound, they were told their baby had a birth defect, possibly a cleft palate, but doctors couldn't say how severe. Every two weeks, the images got worse.\n\n\"It was really, really bad was all they told us,\" Lacey says.\n\nOn Feb. 18, 2011, Christian, a 7-pound, 1-ounce little boy, was born.\n\nThey loved him immediately, but they were heartbroken for their son.\n\nParts of his skull were exposed on the right side of his head. Fissures isolated his nose from the rest of his face. His mouth couldn't close.\n\nThose were defects doctors prepared them for. But there was something else.\n\nThe fault lines of his cleft extended like a V from his open mouth, past his cheekbones, and up to his eyes, which never developed. Where irises and pupils would normally be, for Christian there was only tissue. He was blind.\n\nThe next steps were ones parents never want to imagine.\n\nWhen he was 4 days old, doctors operated. The first surgery involved putting a feeding tube in his stomach and closing the exposed parts of his head. The family spent a month in Vanderbilt's neonatal intensive care unit, as Christian's parents learned how to be comfortable with him, how to console him.\n\nAnd there were times he was inconsolable, crying for days and days and days. They cried too. They mourned the life their son would never have. But, over time, they stopped focusing on what he would never do, and looked instead at how they could make his life better.\n\n\"Their kind of courage in the initial setting was really notable,\" says Dr. Stéphane A. Braün, the plastic surgeon who performed Christian's first surgery at Vanderbilt. \"It's a scary diagnosis. It comes with a lot of uncertainty.\"\n\nWhere Christian is today, Braün says, really is a testament to the strength they showed.\n\nAbort the child\n\nLacey and Chris Buchanan didn't know how to raise a child who couldn't see. Still, like proud parents, they wanted to show him to the world.\n\nWhen they did, many recoiled.\n\nIn the grocery aisles at Wal-Mart, children would gasp or gawk. Audacious adults would ask Lacey why she didn't abort the child.\n\nStrangers would attack her character, accusing her of keeping her son only to satisfy a selfish desire to be a mother.\n\nThe stares were provoking. Her anger boiled. The innocence and value of a life, she says, is not based on social standing or abilities.\n\n\"A world without Christian is not a better world,\" she says.\n\nLacey wanted others to understand that she and Christian shared a love like any other mother and child, perhaps more fiercely so. So just after his first birthday she made a video and sent it out into the social media world.\n\nShe didn't talk. Instead, she used handwritten notes to describe her anguish and her joy, all with her little boy cradled in a blanket against her chest.\n\nStory continues after video\n\nThe video soon went viral, and not long after Lacey, Chris and Christian appeared on national television elevating her voice and giving her son a face beyond his birth defect.\n\nA few years later, near Christian's fourth birthday, Lacey's video made the rounds again.\n\nIt appeared in my Facebook feed, posted by several friends. As I watched, I wept.\n\nBy this time, the 27-year-old Lacey had another son — a healthy, spirited 1-year-old named Chandler — and was also attending law school in Nashville several nights a week.\n\nThose details would only add to my awe of her.\n\nBut even before I spent time with her, I related to her love — the love of a mother — turbulent and profound.\n\nI wanted to hold that little boy's hand.\n\nLike a zipper\n\nChristian's small hands work so hard.\n\nAt his therapies, they struggle to close the snaps on a shirt or stack wooden blocks. They grasp for objects as he moves through a room. They search, outstretched, for his mother's secure hold.\n\nThey are his eyes.\n\nEach motion, every motor skill, must be learned as he works to overcome the disabilities from his birth defect. That means at least three therapy sessions a week.\n\nMouth movements require the same concentrated efforts. Christian doesn't eat solid foods, instead his mother purees turkey, strawberries, zucchini and carrots in her Vitamix and injects it into his feeding tube. But his lips and tongue can form words — and two surgeries have improved that.\n\nWhen he was born, the hole in Christian's palate spanned seven-tenths of an inch — nearly twice what is considered a wide cleft. To close it meant two long surgeries in Indianapolis. There, craniofacial surgeons used the limited tissue that hugged Christian's gums and sewed together the delicate flaps, like a zipper.\n\nNow, Christian loves to listen to himself talk. In therapy, there is a button he pushes to record words like \"yes, please\" and \"no, thank you.\" At home, tucked along the crowded shelves of the family's small, ranch-style home is a toy keyboard that Christian uses to record himself singing.\n\nThe surgery, Lacey says, brought out more spontaneous expression. He is learning to keep his tongue away from the roof of his mouth. As he does, his speech will develop from the sometimes-garbled phrases that remind me of my 2-year-old's chatter to something more clear.\n\nHand in hand\n\nAs we sit together in the doctor's office, however, it is clear that other challenges will be harder to overcome.\n\nIn one corner of a crowded waiting room, several children giggle as they drag magnets across the bottom of the table, pulling boats and dolphins through sand on the tabletop. It is an auditory experience for Christian, who can hear the sand grind as the objects move.\n\nAs his sits to play, the other children look up and they are startled.\n\n\"He has no eyes,\" Christian's nurse explains, as she wraps her arms around him. \"But it's OK.\"\n\nIt is OK, but they don't understand. The children get up and move to the other side of the room.\n\nThis will be Christian's continued struggle. Finding acceptance not only from his mother, his father and his brother, but also from strangers.\n\nAlone, Christian puts his head down on the table. He looks so sad. I sit down next to him in a toddler-sized yellow chair. It is then that I hold his hand.\n\nIt is so soft.\n\nGently, I guide his arm to the table. He runs his fingertips across the smooth surface of the small object in his palm.\n\nMagnet, I say.\n\nIn that moment, looking past what's on the surface, we connect. If only others could do the same.\n\nThen, together, we pull a ship through the sand.\n\nReach Jessica Bliss at 615-259-8253 and on Twitter @jlbliss.\n\nSPECIAL KIDS RACE\n\nSpecial Kids, a non-profit therapy and nursing center where Christian Buchanan receives his rehabilitative therapies, will host its annual fundraising 15K, 5K, and 1-mile fun run next weekend.\n\nWhen: Saturday, March 21\n\nWhere: Murfreesboro Medical Clinic (1272 Garrison Drive, Murfreesboro)\n\nStart times: 7 a.m. for 15K, 7:20 a.m. for 5K, 8 a.m. or 8:30 a.m. for the 1-mile fun run (participant chooses fun run time)\n\nMore info: http://specialkidsrace.org/"
