        "text": "Ahh!!!!!! I'm so excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm gonna meet Eden again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope she remembers me...hehe! And ALICIA!!! I'm so glad Cady and Michael are going as well because my mom really wants to meet them and they are both great! My mom wants Cady to sign a picture of our dog, Dixie saying \"To Dixie, Love Dixie\" and she wants Michael to sign the picture of her being picked up by him because she didn't get to last year. Ooh, I'm so excited!\n\nAnyways, fun-fun-fun!!\n\nI wish Jeff Branson, Connie Fletcher, and Chrishell Stause were going though!\n\nI don't understand the Rosie part? She's gonna be there for The View? I don't get it.\n\nOoh! Because Bob Guiney's gonna be there, that means Rebecca will! I am going to meet her, I swear!\n\nI just noticed this myself! SSW is something that I look forward to all year. I am so excited, hope it works out that I get to go! We just found out that we have to move (landlords daughter wants our house), plus we have the baby coming in December, so funds are super tight but I was telling hubby this morning that if there is any way possible, I am going. This will be my third time to go, it is so much fun! I'm sure the other moms out there know what its like to always give up things, and time, for ourselves and this is the one weekend a year that I get to be alone with hubby and do something that is just for me. I'm hoping to make some extra cash on ebay between now and then so I can make it.\n\nGera\n\nThey put the schedule up!\n\nWoohoo! Unfortunately though, Day 2 Alicia Minshew and Michael E. Knight's schedules kinda conflict so I decided that I'm gonna go to Michael on Day 2 with my mom unless my mom gets his 5:30 pm and then I'll get either one of Alicia's - otherwise, I'll get Mikey with her. But Eden and Cady's schedules are fine together so I'm gonna meet Eden on Day 1 and my mom's gonna meet Cady on Day 1.\n\nThat's interesting that Alexa is gonna be a part of I Wanna Be A Soap Star on Day 1.\n\nI'm confused as to why Cady isn't a performer in the Street Jam. She has an album for God's sakes!"
