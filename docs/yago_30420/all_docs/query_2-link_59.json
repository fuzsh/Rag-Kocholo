        "text": "Facts\n\nTwenty residents of New York City, including John Kelly, appealed the termination of their benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Their assistance had been terminated or was about to be terminated without a pre-termination hearing. The procedures provided by the State Department of Social Services' Official Regulations did include a pre-termination review and a post-termination hearing.\n\nUnder these procedures, the agency was required to inform the recipient of the anticipated termination and the explanation for it seven days before termination. Recipients in this situation had the right to request a review by a local welfare official in a superior position to the person who approved the termination, and they were allowed to submit a written statement in support of their position that the benefits should not be terminated. However, there was no opportunity for a personal appearance by the recipient, for the presentation of evidence, or for the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. After an efficient review by the higher-ranking official, any termination decision would be sent to the recipient, and benefits would be terminated on that date. However, a post-termination hearing was available at which recipients could appear, submit evidence, and examine and cross-examine witnesses. If the agency determined at that hearing that the benefits had been wrongfully terminated, the recipient would be entitled to the missed amounts as well as reinstatement. If the agency affirmed its termination decision, the recipient could take an appeal to court.\n\nArguing that the combination of a pre-termination review and a post-termination hearing violated their due process rights, the New York City recipients succeeded in the federal district court, which required that the agency hold pre-termination hearings.\n\nOpinions\n\nMajority\n\nWilliam Joseph Brennan, Jr. (Author)\n\nWilliam Orville Douglas\n\nJohn Marshall Harlan II\n\nByron Raymond White\n\nThurgood Marshall\n\nExpanding the definition of property and the rights associated with it, Brennan found that welfare benefits were a form of property. He departed from the Court's previous distinction between rights and privileges in finding that government entitlements, also including pension plans and professional licenses, were not a gratuity and were subject to procedural due process. This meant that pre-termination procedures were required at which the recipient could produce evidence to challenge the termination. Brennan wrote that the interest of a recipient in obtaining funds essential to procuring the necessities of life outweighed the state interest in administrative efficiency. He also pointed out that the state has an interest in ensuring that eligible recipients receive public benefits, which makes the interest of the individual recipients even stronger. On the other hand, Brennan did not wish to burden the state excessively by requiring the equivalent of a full trial for each termination of benefits. He did not require that the government provide an attorney for the recipient, although the recipient should be allowed to use an independently retained attorney. The adjudicating authority needed to explain the reasoning for the decision and identify the evidence giving rise to it, but it did not need to go through the process of writing opinions and making formal findings of fact and conclusions of law. Brennan felt that impartiality required the decision-maker to be someone who had not been involved in the decision to terminate benefits, but it could be someone who had been previously aware of the case more generally. Most importantly, the recipient needed to have an opportunity to be heard and confront adverse witnesses, and the decision-maker needed to reach its conclusions based solely on the evidence provided at the hearing.\n\nDissent\n\nHugo Lafayette Black (Author)\n\nDissent\n\nPotter Stewart (Author)\n\nDissent\n\nWarren Earl Burger (Author)\n\nCase Commentary"
