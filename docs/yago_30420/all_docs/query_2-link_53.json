        "text": "1883: John Gilmary Shea\n\nShea has been cited ‘The Father of American Catholic History’ largely because of his massive History of the Catholic Church in the United States, a four-volume study which he began three years after receiving the first Laetare Medal. He began his career as a historian of the Church at the age of 14, contributing a biography of Cardinal Alvarez Carillo de Arbonoz to The Young People’s Catholic Magazine. For the rest of his life his historical work, which produced more than 250 books and a 26-volume series on the Jesuit exploration of North America, was mostly self-subsidized.\n\n1884: Patrick Charles Keeley\n\nIn the spring of 1869, Father Sorin asked this Catholic architect to draw plans for what is now the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Keeley envisioned a cruciform 200 feet long with a transept large enough to seat 2,000 people. A large dome would have crowned the intersection of the transept and nave, and the building would have been flanked by two bell towers. The cost of the project (over $100,000) alarmed even Father Sorin, who decided against the plan. But between 1847 and 1892, nearly 700 of Keeley’s other drawings became cathedrals, parish churches and monasteries. At the time of its construction, Keeley’s Brooklyn Cathedral was the largest building of its kind in the Western hemisphere.\n\n1885: Eliza Allen Starr\n\nThe first woman to receive a Laetare Medal was a descendant of the Puritans of New Engalnd. In 1854, after nine years of prayer and personal struggle, she was received into the Catholic Church. Well-educated in the arts, she decided to devote the rest of her life to the criticism, interpretation, and publicizing of Christian art. Several books of her criticism were greatly respected in secular circles, and for one, \"Three Keys to the Camera della Segnatura of the Vatican,\" she received papal commendation. Much of her later life was spent as a teacher of art at Saint Mary’s Academy near Notre Dame.\n\n1886: General John Newton\n\nA graduate of West Point and a highly decorated veteran of several Union campaigns in the Civil War, Newton is remembered less for what he left behind than for what he took away. As Lieutenant-Colonel of Engineers for the United States Army, he supervised the removal of two huge and obstructive rocks, Hallet’s Reef and Flood Rock, from Hell Gate, and the main waterway between Long Island Sound and the East River. The impediments were destroyed in two large explosions in 1876 and 1885, and the project was internationally praised as an outstanding technological feat.\n\n1887: Edward Preuss\n\nNo Laetare Medalist of was announced in 1887, and the selection of Edward Preuss, who declined to accept the medal, was not made public until 1916. An article in the 1908 issue of The Scholastic, Notre Dame’s student magazine, describes Preuss, without using his name, as “a convert from Protestantism (who) had written a book before his conversion in which he violently attacked the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin.” Although Preuss later edited Amerika, a popular St. Louis-based German Catholic daily newspaper, he made a repentant vow when he was received into the Church in 1872 that he would not accept any public distinction.\n\n1888: Patrick V. Hickey\n\nBorn and educated in Ireland, Hickey emigrated to America in 1866 and worked for six years as a reporter, special correspondent, literary critic and editorial writer on the New York World. In 1872, having established himself as a prominent newspaperman, he left the paper and founded The Catholic Review of Brooklyn. Later in his career he founded two other Catholic magazines, The Catholic American and The Illustrated Catholic American.\n\n1889: Anna Hansen Dorsey\n\nMrs. Dorsey, perhaps the first unabashedly Catholic novelist in this country, was the author of more than 20 books. A Notre Dame Scholastic article describes her as ‘a pioneer of light Catholic literature.’ According to an article in the Catholic Encyclopedia, ‘while deeply religious in tone, her stories are full of a living interest gained by a clear insight and knowledge of the world around her.’\n\n1890: William J. Onahan\n\nOnahan, an Irish immigrant who settled in Chicago in the 1850’s, quickly became prominent in that city’s civil affairs. He was a member of the city school board, president of the public library, city collector for six terms, city comptroller and jury commissioner. He was the chief architect of the American Catholic Congress at Baltimore in 1889. This gathering of 1,500 Catholic lay people from all over the United States discussed and planned for the future of the Church in America.\n\n1891: Daniel Dougherty\n\nThis Philadelphia attorney’s eloquence won many controversial acquittals for his clients. During the American Catholic Congress, he gave what his Laetare Medal citation described as ‘a magnificent apologia for your co-religionists.’ The defensive nature of Dougherty’s speech is suggested in this fragment of it: “Protestantism was unknown when America was discovered. Let the students, scholars, poets and historian search the archives of Spain, the libraries of Europe and the deeper the research the more the glory will adorn the brow of Catholicity. It was a pious Catholic who conceived the mighty thought!\"\n\n1892: Henry F. Brownson\n\nSon of Orestes Brownson, whose body is entombed in the crypt of Notre Dame’s Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Henry Brownson fought on the Union side during the Civil War, was wounded and captured at Chancellorsville and later released by the Confederacy in a prisoner exchange. From 1855 on, he wrote, edited and translated a large number of philosophical works. He wrote a three-volume biography of his father and edited a 20-volume set of his father’s works. For translating Francesco Tarducci’s Life of Columbus in 1891, he was given the Laetare Medal. Tarducci’s book, incidentally, was illustrated by Luigi Gregori and inspired the murals in the Main Building.\n\n1893: Patrick Donohoe\n\nAs a boy, Donahoe worked menial jobs on the presses of two Boston papers. In 1836, he began to publish the Boston Pilot, a weekly paper devoted to Irish American and Catholic affairs which in time became the principal organ of Catholic opinion of New England. Donahoe also established a Catholic publishing house, a bank and a church goods store.\n\n1894: Augustine Daly\n\nFascinated by the theatre from an early age, Daly worked as a drama critic for several New York newspapers before forming his own theatrical company in 1869. In addition to his authorship of two very popular plays, Leah the Forsaken and Under the Gaslight, he presented, in 1888, a production of The Taming of the Shrew in several British theatres. Many believe that this was the first time an American theatre group had performed Shakespearean plays for an English audience.\n\n1895: Mary Anne Sadlier\n\nSadlier wrote or translated more than 60 books, most of them concerning the plight of Irish Catholics in their native land and in the New World. A Scholastic biographer noted that she wrote most of her books at a time when \"Catholic books, and more especially Catholic stories, were comparatively scarce, while anti-Catholic tales and tracts were many and multiform.\"\n\n1896: General William Starke Rosecrans\n\nWhile teaching philosophy and engineering at West point, ‘Old Rosey’, as he was nicknamed, was received into the Catholic Church. During the Civil War he earned a reputation as a skillful military strategist, an image shattered at the battle of Chickamauga, which was won by the Confederacy because of a tactical error for which Rosecrans was held responsible. After the war, he became active in Ohio politics but declined to accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for governor. He prospected in Mexico and California, later becoming one of the state’s Congressional representatives.\n\n1897: Thomas Addis Emmet\n\nThis physician became locally famous in New York City for his work on Ward’s Island, where he treated thousands of Irish immigrants who suffered from typhus or ‘ship fever’. Twice during his residency there he contracted the disease, but survived to become an internationally famous gynecologist. His 1879 book, The Principles of Gynecology, became the definitive textbook of the period and was translated into German and French.\n\n1898: Timothy Edward Howard\n\nThe first graduate of the University to win its highest honor, Howard, for whom a residence hall at Notre Dame is named, interrupted his undergraduate career to fight on the Union side of the Civil War. Within a month of enlistment, he was seriously wounded at the Battle of Shiloh, and after a period of convalescence he returned to Notre Dame. Here he became a professor of rhetoric, but taught history, mathematics and astronomy as well. From 1886 to 1892 he served as an Indiana state senator; in 1892 he was elected to the Supreme Court of Indiana and served three terms as the Court’s chief justice. In addition to several books on grammar, law and history, he wrote a volume of poetry.\n\n1899: Mary Gwendolin Caldwell\n\nWell-known in the Church for her many acts of philanthropy and for her close friendship with John Lancaster Spalding, the first bishop of Peoria, Caldwell in 1891 received the Golden Rose, the papal award from which the Laetare Medal is derived. Her gift of $300,000 to the Plenary Council of Baltimore made possible the establishment of Catholic University, whose first building was named after her in 1888.\n\n1900: John A. Creighton\n\nThe benefactors of the Creighton brothers, John and Edward, made possible the establishment of Creighton University in Omaha. John Creighton built the first two monasteries of the Poor Clares order in the United States as well as the Saint Joseph-Creighton Hospital in Omaha. In addition to his philanthropy, he, with his brother, was instrumental in the completion of America’s first transcontinental telegraph system in 1861.\n\n1901: William Bourke Cockran\n\nEducated in Irish seminaries, Cockran emigrated to this country in 1871. Within five years he had established a successful law practice in New York City, where he became active in local politics. He gained national attention as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention with a speech opposingthe nomination of Grover Cleveland. In 1886, 1890 and 1892, he represented a New York City district in the House of Representatives. In his most celebrated legal victory he sought and gained the intervention of President Wilson in a client’s death sentence. He was also a legal advisor to three New York archbishops.\n\n1902: John Benjamin Murphy, M.D.\n\nAfter studying medicine in Europe, Murphy became an instructor in surgery at Rush Medical College and an attending surgeon at Cook County Hospital in Chicago, where the Haymarket rioting provided him with his first seriously wounded patients. His subsequent career as a teacher of medicine included several advances in the surgical field. In 1889, he performed an appendectomy which greatly improved that operation’s technique; in 1892 he invented a device which became known as ‘Murphy’s Button’, simplifying the mending of severed intestines and opening up a new field in surgery.\n\n1903: Charles Jerome Bonaparte\n\nThe grandson of King Jerome, who was the brother of Napoleon I, Bonaparte graduated from Harvard Law School in 1874 and became active in Baltimore’s municipal affairs. He, along with William Onahan, Daniel Dougherty, and Henry Brownson, was prominent in the Catholic Congress of that city. During Theodore Roosevelt’s presidential administration he served as Secretary of the Navy and Attorney General. From 1906 to 1909, when Roosevelt left office, Bonaparte prosecuted more than 50 antitrust suits. Several times during his cabinet career he was employed as an intermediary between Church and government leaders. \"No man,\" he said, \"can be a good Catholic who is not a good citizen.\"\n\n1904: Richard C. Kerens\n\nEmigrating from Ireland and having joined the Union army at the age of 19, Kerens became ‘chief muledriver for the Army of the Potomac.’ For the rest of his life he was prominently engaged in transportation projects, helping establish a number of the nation’s earliest railroads. A well-known Republican party fundraiser, he was offered several ambassador posts in Republican administrations, but he never accepted until 1909, when he became Ambassador to Austria-Hungary under President Taft.\n\n1905: Thomas B. Fitzpatrick\n\nAlthough his acts of philanthropy were less publicized than those of other Laetare Medalists, Fitzpatrick had a reputation for generosity in Boston, where he was president of Brown, Durrell & Company, a drygoods store. His gifts made possible the establishment of three Catholic orphanages in that city and the building of the Boston Catholic Union, a social organization.\n\n1906: Francis J. Quinlan\n\nAfter graduating from Columbia University with a medical degree in 1878, Quinlan pursued advanced studies in Europe for a year. Returning to the United States in 1879, he served as a surgeon in the Army’s medical corps in the Dakotas, Montana and Idaho. From 1883 until his death, he practiced medicine in New York City, specializing in diseases of the ear, nose and throat. His numerous medical monographs were widely praised by his contemporaries.\n\n1907: Katherine Eleanor Conway\n\nAt the age of 33, this single woman joined the staff of the Boston Pilot, whose founder, Patrick Donahoe, had received the Laetare Medal in 1893. In 1908, she became the editor of The Republic, another Boston newspaper. During her career she was a member of the Massachusetts Prison Commission, author of more than 20 books, godmother to 150 children, and a faculty member at Saint Mary’s College, Notre Dame, Ind. Laetare Medalist William J. Onahan, at her reception of the medal, said, \"Her pen has ever been employed in vindicating Catholic principles and pleading for all that is good, true and generous.\"\n\n1908: James C. Monaghan\n\nIn 1884, while still a student at Brown University, Monaghan was serving as a member of the Providence City Council and as a local campaign manager for the soon-to-be-elected President Grover Cleveland. Cleveland appointed him U.S. Consul at Mannheim, Germany, the following year. Returning to the United States five years later, Monaghan worked for several newspapers, served as editor of The Manufacturer, became chief of the ‘division of consular reports’ in the U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor, was appointed to several university faculties (from 1906 to 1908, he taught economics and history at Notre Dame) and was U.S. Consul in Jamaica.\n\n1909: Frances Tiernan (Christian Reid)\n\nAn author whose works were inspired by faith and friendship with a community of prominent Catholic thinkers, Frances Tiernan’s prolific writing took on the accent of her American upbringing. Tiernan was received into the Catholic Church in 1868, and she spent most of her career publishing under the pseudonym Christian Reid. She wrote nearly 50 novels and hundreds of short stories, poems, and travelogues, some of which were featured in the Notre Dame-based literary magazine, The Ave Maria. Her writing was considered by many to be a moral antidote for the more sensationalist fiction read by many young people at the time, and her self-described aspiration was to author ‘distinctively Catholic books.’\n\n1910: Maurice Francis Egan\n\nAs a young man, Egan studied at several American universities (including Notre Dame, where hereceived an M.A. degree in 1879) in philosophy, literature, history, language and law. His consequent and enormous erudition came to bear in editorial jobs on several newspapers and magazines in Philadelphia and New York. He left his post as editor of the Freeman’s Journal in 1888 to fill a chair in English literature at Notre Dame. In 1907, Theodore Roosevelt appointment him minister to Denmark, a diplomatic post which he retained during the next two presidential administrations.\n\n1911: Agnes Replier\n\nBy the time she was 16 and had begun her career as an essayist, Agnes Repplier had been expelled from Eden Hall and Miss Irwin’s School in Philadelphia. Her rebellious manner and the fact that she studied only those subjects (art and literature) which interested her, made her a far more successful writer than student. For more than half a century her essays appeared in nearly every prominent American periodical, and her literary reputation was responsible for several honorary degrees (including those given by Yale and Columbia) and her election to the National Institute of Arts and Letters.\n\n1912: Thomas M. Mulry\n\nInheriting from his father a successful New York City building contractor’s firm, Mulry devoted most ofhis spare time to charitable works among the poor immigrants of Manhattan Island’s lower East Side. From 1905 to 1915, he was president of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, and in 1910, he helped establish the National Conference of Catholic Charities.\n\n1913: Charles G. Herberman\n\nEmigrating to America from Germany, Herbermann taught at St. John’s College (which later became Fordham University) and at the College of the City of New York, for which he became the librarian in 1873. In 1905, he was chosen editor-in-chief of The Catholic Encyclopedia, in which capacity (and despite rapidly deteriorating eyesight brought about by glaucoma) he supervised the work of 1,500 contributors from 43 nations, producing 15 volumes by 1913.\n\n1914: Edward Douglas White\n\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court from 1910 until his death, White was nominated to that body by President Grover Cleveland in 1891, arousing considerable controversy: he was a Louisiana Catholic, and he fought on the side of the Confederacy during the Civil War. One of his most lasting judicial decisions (Arver vs. the United States) recognized the right of the United States to compel young men to serve in the military through a draft law.\n\n1915: Mary V. Merrick\n\nCrippled by a childhood accident, Merrick spent the rest of her long life confined to a bed and wheelchair. Although she had difficulty holding a pen, she managed to translate two French children’s books and to write two of her own (The Life of Christ in 1909 and The Altar of God in 1920). In 1886 she founded, in Washington, D.C., the Christ Child Society, which provided clothing and gifts for needy children at Christmas. By her death, there were 37 chapters of the society in as many cities and 12,000 members.\n\n1916: James Joseph Walsh\n\nFor six years, Walsh studied to be ordained a priest in the Society of Jesus, withdrawing from the order to study medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and in Europe. He began his medical career in 1899 and soon found himself arguing with his colleagues’ assertions that the Catholic Church was the enemy of the natural sciences. He soon won a reputation, not only because of his cogent arguments, but also through his 45 published books and 500 articles as an erudite apologist for the Catholic faith.\n\n1917: William Sheperd Benson\n\nAfter graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1877, Benson embarked on a very successful naval career. He was promoted to captain in 1909 and for three years commanded the battleship Utah. When Congress established the Office of Naval Operations, Benson was named its head and promoted to rear admiral. A destroyer in the United States fleet is named after him.\n\n1918: Joseph Scott\n\nBorn and educated in England, Scott came to the United States in 1889 and taught rhetoric and English literature at St. Bonaventure College in Allegany, N.Y. In 1893, he moved to Los Angeles and was admitted to the California bar the following year. In addition to a successful legal career, Scott was elected five times to the Los Angeles Board of Education and served as its president from 1906 to 1911, the first Catholic to do so.\n\n1919: George L. Duval\n\nEnormously wealthy from his import-export business, Duval contributed lavishly to Catholic hospitals, colleges, orphanages and charities. Apparently baffled by his selection for the 1919 Laetare Medal, Duval said, \"Candidly, I am unable to see any great merit in the mere bestowal of money when it entails no substantial sacrifice.\" He accepted the award \"as a tribute to good will rather than performance.\"\n\n1920: Lawrence Francis Flick\n\nFlick, who suffered from the disease himself, sparked a furious debate within the medical profession by insisting that tuberculosis was not hereditary but contagious. While most of this physician’s career was devoted to the study and cure of tuberculosis, his other great passion was history, and in 1919 he became founder and first president of the American Catholic Historical Association.\n\n1921: Elizabeth Nourse\n\nAs a child in Cincinnati, Ohio, Nourse displayed an aptitude for drawing and decided upon an artistic career. Family financial trouble nearly prevented her from moving to Parish in 1887, but she managed to secure employment in that city as a designer, decorator and art teacher. Living there for the rest of her life, she produced nearly 200 canvases, most of them depicting the lives and struggles of poor people. She became an associate member of the Societe des Beaux Arts, and in 1901 was elected ‘societaire’, the highest honor the society bestowed.\n\n1922: Charles Patrick Neill\n\nA graduate of the University of Notre Dame and for a time a member of its faculty, Neill served as U.S. commissioner of labor during the Roosevelt and Taft administrations.

At Notre Dame he designed the Law School and Hurley and Cushing Halls.\n\n1925: Albert Francis Zahm\n\nOne of the prominent figures in the formation of the University of Notre Dame, Zahm spent much of his life here as an undergraduate, a professional student, a professor and an inventor. In addition to his considerable contributions to the study of science at Notre Dame, Zahm is famous for his discoveries in the field of aviation. In 1901, he designed and built the first wind tunnel in the United States.\n\n1926: Edward Nash Hurley\n\nHurley’s most notable achievement was the assembly — by requisition, purchase, construction and confiscation — of 14 million tons of ocean shipping in 1917. He did this as a member of President Woodrow Wilson’s administration when the United States entered World War I, and the merchant marine thus assembled by the Emergency Fleet Corporation, of which Hurley was president, made possible the Allied victory. His contribution to the University of $200,000 in 1930 made possible the construction of Hurley Hall.\n\n1927: Margaret Anglin\n\nAnglin was born in the House of Parliament in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, during the time her father, Speaker of the House of Commons, was furnished with quarters there. By the time she was 18, she had established herself as a leading actress of the New York theatre world. In addition to her successful performances of many contemporary roles, she delighted audiences with her interpretations of the Greek classics.\n\n1928: John Johnson Spalding\n\nSpalding, a successful Atlanta lawyer, entrepreneur and Democratic Party politician, contributed generous amounts of money to Catholic churches, schools, and orphanages in Georgia. \"Religious prejudice,\" his citations reads, \"is slowly disintegrating in the Southland, and it is such leads as Jack J. Spalding of Atlanta who are in large part to be credited for this dawning era of religious tolerance.\"\n\n1929: Alfred Emmanuel Smith\n\n‘The Happy Warrior’ was the Democratic Party candidate for the presidency in 1928.

In 1906 he was instrumental in obtaining $1,000,000 for the victims of the San Francisco earthquake.\n\n1932: Stephen J. Maher\n\nLike Lawrence Flick, Dr. Maher was a prominent pioneer in the battle against tuberculosis. A year after receiving the Laetare Medal, he isolated and learned how to destroy the ‘A.Y. Bacterin,’ a discovery which proved to be a milestone in tubercular diagnosis and treatment. He also found time to write poetry and short stories, most of them reflecting his obsession with ‘the White Plague.’\n\n1933: John McCormack\n\n\"The Golden Voice of Athlane,\" McCormack’s tenor was first heard in public at a concert in an Irish grade school when the singer was nine years old. Quickly establishing an international reputation, and having studied under Sabatini in Italy, McCormack made his operatic debut in New York in 1909. A few years later, he became an American citizen and star of several radio programs and phonograph recordings which made him legendary.\n\n1934: Genevieve Garvan Brady\n\nDuring the first World War, Mrs. Brady purchased the Old Colony Club in New York City and allowed it to be used by the United States government as a mobilization center for nurses bound for the battlefields of Europe. She was decorated by the French and Belgian governments after the war and for her financial aid to refugees. Under Eleanor Roosevelt, she was vice chairman of the National Women’s Committee on Welfare and Relief Mobilization. She was the 11th woman to receive the medal.\n\n1935: Francis Hamilton Spearman\n\nAs a young man, Spearman worked in the wholesale grocery business in Chicago, but soon found that his primary vocation was writing. Nearly 50 of his short stories were published in Harper’s Weekly and Harper’s Magazine. In addition, he wrote more than a dozen popular novels. One of these, Robert Kimberly, was praised by his coreligionists as an impressive defense of the sanctity of marriage.\n\n1936: Richard Reid\n\nReid began his career as a high school teacher in New York City, but soon found journalism more to his liking. He worked for a time on the Augusta (Georgia) Daily Chronicle and the Daily Herald before becoming editor of The Bulletin, a Catholic newspaper serving the Southeastern region of the United States.

For the 21 years of his life, he edited The Catholic News, the weekly paper of the Archdiocese of New York.\n\n1937: Jeremiah Denis M. Ford\n\nFord went to Harvard University in 1895 as an instructor in French. In 1911, he became chairman of Harvard’s Department of Romance Languages.

The citation of 1937 praised Ford for fostering ‘international understanding and respect, which is a vital basis of world peace.’\n\n1938: Irvin William Abell\n\nAfter taking a degree in medicine from the University of Louisville in 1897, Abell stayed on there as a professor of clinical surgery. Later, he studied medicine in Europe at the Universities of Marburg and Berlin. Some of his most notable work was done outside the field of surgery, developing preventative and curative treatments for mental illness. He contributed many articles to surgical and psychiatric journals and served in 1938 as president of the American Medical Association.\n\n1939: Josephine Van Dyke Brownson\n\nThe awarding of the medal to Ms. Brownson was unusual in that her father, Henry F. Brownson, had received the honor 1892. She had resigned her position as a mathematics teacher in a Detroit highschool to devote more time to the establishment of the Catholic Instruction League in that city. Basing her catechetical program on Pope Pius X’s 1905 encyclical, ‘Acerbo Nimis,’ she had, by 1939, organized 400 teachers and 13,000 students.\n\n1940: General Hugh Aloysius Drum\n\nThe third United States General so honored, Drum inherited an interest in military tradition from his father, who was an Army captain.

An extraordinary paradox became clear: that the more science progressed, and even as it benefited man, the less it said about what it is like to be a man living in the world.” In such widely read novels as The Moviegoer, The Last Gentleman, Love In The Ruins, Lancelot, The Second Coming, and The Thanatos Syndrome, Percy attempted to address that paradox.\n\n1990: Sister Thea Bowman (posthumously)\n\nThe granddaughter of a slave, a native of Canton, Mississippi, and a member of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, Sister Thea Bowman was the first African American to receive the Laetare Medal.

He grew up in a fatherless household with his mother, brother and sister in the slums of New York City. Although his mother worked as a nurse and Moynihan and his brother sold newspapers and shined shoes, the family also relied on public assistance, a memory which may have been responsible for the eloquence with which he spoke of the poor and disenfranchised.

We ask, ‘Don’t they deserve to die?’ But the real question should be, ‘Do we deserve to kill them?’”\n\n1997: Rev. Virgilio Elizondo\n\nA native of San Antonio, Texas, where his Mexican immigrant parents owned a grocery store and where he himself spent most of his life, Father Elizondo is the pastor of San Fernando Cathedral there.

In addition to teaching biology at Brown University, he has written two books on the subjects: Finding Darwin’s God and Only a Theory, appeared frequently on television, and defended in court the teaching of evolution in public schools.\n\n2015: Aaron Neville\n\nA rhythm and blues and soul artist, Neville has had four platinum-certified albums and four Top 20 hits in the United States, including three that went to No. 1 on Billboard's adult contemporary chart and one that topped the R&B chart. He is also a member of the musical group The Neville Brothers with his brothers Art, Charles and Cyril.\n\nBorn in New Orleans, Louisiana, Neville attended St. Monica’s Catholic School. He credits successfully surviving trying times of drug addiction and other hardships to God’s grace. He is a devotee of St. Jude, one of the original 12 Apostles known as the patron saint of hope and impossible causes. Neville dedicates each of his albums to St. Jude and one of the earrings he wears is a St. Jude medal. (Photo credit: Sarah A. Friedman)\n\n2016: Joe Biden & John Boehner\n\nAt age 29, Joe Biden became one of the youngest people ever elected to the U.S. Senate. He represented Delaware for 36 years before his election as vice president in 2008.\n\nIn the Senate, Biden served as chairman or ranking member of the Judiciary Committee for 17 years and played an integral role in the 1994 Crime Law and the Violence Against Women Act. He also served for 12 years as chair or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, helping to guide issues and legislation related to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, post-Cold War Europe, the Middle East and Southwest Asia.\n\nAs the nation’s 47th vice president, Biden oversaw the $840 billion stimulus package in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and leads the Ready to Work Initiative, among many other initiatives.\n\nJohn Boehner is the second child in a family with 12 children and modest means. After graduating from Xavier University, he worked in business and served in the Ohio legislature. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, serving the 8th District of Ohio, and was re-elected 10 times.\n\nAmong House Republicans, Boehner served as conference chairman, minority leader and majority leader. He also served as chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee where he authored several reforms, including the Pension Protection Act and a school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, D.C.\n\nBoehner became Speaker of the House in January 2011 and was re-elected in January 2013 and January 2015. He stepped down as speaker and resigned from Congress last fall.\n\n2017: Rev. Gregory J. Boyle, S.J.\n\nRev. Gregory J. Boyle, S.J., is founder and executive director of Homeboy Industries in Los Angeles, California. Homeboy was founded in 1988 and is now the largest gang intervention, rehabilitation and re-entry program in the world. Homeboy's holistic approach — including therapeutic and educational offerings, practical services like tattoo removal and work readiness and job training-focused social enterprises — serves 10,000 men and women a year. The organization offers an exit ramp to those stuck in cycles of violence and incarceration and helps them develop the strength and skills to transform their lives and become contributing members of society.\n\nWhile Homeboy’s achievements are myriad — including the Global Homeboy Network that facilitates best practice sharing among 85 like-minded organizations around the world — Father Boyle insists that meaningful life change requires kinship, or welcoming ourselves and others into radical, mutual acceptance.\n\n2018: Sister Norma Pimentel, M.J.\n\nSister Pimentel, a religious sister of the Missionaries of Jesus, has overseen the charitable arm of the Diocese of Brownsville (Texas) since 2008, providing a range of services that includes emergency food and shelter, housing assistance, clinical counseling and pregnancy care to all four counties in the Rio Grande Valley. She was instrumental in organizing local response to the 2014 surge of Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States. This included helping to establish the Humanitarian Respite Center in McAllen, Texas.\n\nIn 2015, Pope Francis recognized and thanked Sister Pimentel personally for her work with immigrants in a virtual town hall meeting that was featured on ABC’s “20/20.” Also in 2015, she was named one of “Our Sunday Visitor’s” 2015 Catholics of the Year and won a nomination for “Texan of the Year.”\n\nIn response to learning she had been named the 2018 Laetare Medalist, Sister Pimentel said: “I am truly honored to receive this award. This year’s Laetare Medal brings forth the cries of the suffering for the world to hear. I would like to thank the University of Notre Dame for this recognition and for being a voice for immigrants in our midst.”\n\nHerself the daughter of Mexican immigrants, Sister Pimentel grew up crossing back and forth from Brownsville to Matamoros, Mexico, to be with family on both sides of the border. It was while her parents were awaiting response from U.S. authorities on their application for residency that Sister Pimentel’s mother gave birth to her in Texas.\n\nIn her reflection on immigrants in “A Pope Francis Lexicon,” Sister Pimentel wrote: “I am a U.S. citizen by chiripa — sheer chance. I grew up entre dos fronteras, enjoying life in two countries, Mexico and the United States.”\n\nSister Pimentel received a bachelor of fine arts degree from Pan American University, a master’s degree in theology from St. Mary’s University and a master’s degree in counseling psychology from Loyola University Chicago.\n\nSister Pimentel said some of her most formative and pivotal experiences took place shortly after she professed final vows with the Missionaries of Jesus. Border patrol agents would bring immigrant families to the sisters’ convent, often late at night. Sister Pimentel said Sister Juliana Garcia, her religious superior at the time, “would immediately prepare a room to welcome the family when they arrived. The mother and her children would become part of our community family for about a week or so, and I quickly learned the importance of living out our faith by how we welcome and protect those who need us.”\n\nFor Sister Pimentel, the call to compassion to those in need extends to all Christians—and results in radical transformation.\n\n“Scripture comes to life and our faith becomes flesh,” she said. “It is not until you find yourself in front of the face of the immigrant child or mother that you will understand this. It is a moment of realizing we are all one human family.”\n\n2019: Norman Francis\n\nDuring Francis’ 47-year tenure as president of Xavier University, enrollment nearly tripled, the endowment grew eightfold and the university became the leading producer of African-American undergraduates who complete medical school. Xavier also ranks first nationally in the number of African-American students earning undergraduate degrees in biology and life sciences, chemistry, physics and pharmacy.\n\nAt a time when the U.S. Supreme Court — based on a legal challenge to Louisiana law regarding “separate but equal” — upheld segregation as the law of the land, St. Katharine Drexel founded Xavier, America’s only historically black and Catholic university, in 1925. Heir to a banking fortune, Drexel also founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament and used her entire inheritance to advance racial equality for African-Americans and Native Americans, especially through education. Drexel’s influence permeates Francis’ achievements.\n\n“I did not build Xavier; I was part of Katharine Drexel’s mission to provide a quality education for all,” Francis said. “All the people I worked with were part of this plan and mission, which was not only honorable, but was totally necessary when you look back at what the United States was at the time.”\n\n2020: Kathleen McChesney\n\nKathleen McChesney’s myriad law enforcement achievements began in the 1970s as a police officer in King County, Washington. As a detective, she investigated sex crimes and homicides, including the case involving the notorious serial killer Ted Bundy. McChesney joined the FBI in 1978 as a special agent, eventually reaching the third-highest position within the bureau as executive assistant director for law enforcement services.\n\nIn 2002, McChesney was recruited by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to establish and lead its Office of Child Protection, where she helped the nation’s 195 dioceses and eparchies implement the “Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People.” She established protocols for responses to allegations of abuse, prevention of abuse, transparency and accountability. Over the course of three years, McChesney also worked with the John Jay College of Criminal Justice to develop an unprecedented study of sexual abuse of children in the Catholic Church, which was released in 2004. She is the founder of Kinsale Management Consulting, through which she continues to serve dioceses, religious organizations, and others around the world in the protection of children and vulnerable adults and in preventing ministerial misconduct and abuse.\n\nThroughout her work with the Catholic Church, McChesney has emphasized the necessity of listening to victim-survivors, independent and professional investigations of abuse, transparency regarding cases of abuse and offenders, and thorough screening for clergy and laypeople involved in Catholic ministries. In Sept. 2019, McChesney spoke on some of these themes as a guest panelist in “The Church Crisis: Where Are We Now?’, which launched the 2019-2020 Notre Dame Forum, “Rebuild My Church: Crisis and Response.”\n\n2021: Carla Harris\n\nCarla Harris, vice chairman of wealth management and senior client adviser at Morgan Stanley, began her career at a time when very few of her colleagues were Black or women, and her trajectory has been steadily ascendant. She was chair of the Morgan Stanley Foundation from 2005 to 2014 and is a member of the boards for Harvard University and the Walmart Corp.\n\nIn 2013, Harris was appointed by President Barack Obama to chair the National Women’s Business Council, an independent counsel to the president, Congress and the U.S. Small Business Administration.\n\nCharacteristic of Harris’ approach to her own success has been a mantra that has carried her beyond many obstacles and naysayers: “Never count yourself out.” Harris coaches others with a “negative motivation” approach, leveraging what people say cannot be done into energy to prove them wrong. She likewise understands her successes as a responsibility to help others, saying, “We are blessed so that we may be a blessing to others.”\n\n2022: Sharon Lavigne\n\nSharon Lavigne is the founder and director of Rise St. James — a faith-based grassroots organization fighting for environmental justice in St. James Parish, Louisiana. A retired special education teacher, she has lived her entire life in St. James Parish and has watched the region transform from idyllic farmland into an embattled community living in the shadow of the petrochemical industry and plagued by industrial pollution.\n\nLocated between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, St. James Parish is in the midst of an area nicknamed Cancer Alley, an 85-mile stretch of land along the Mississippi River that has more than 150 petrochemical plants and refineries. Thirty-two of those plants are in St. James Parish alone and are highly concentrated in districts in which the majority of residents are both Black and lower income.\n\n“Why would they put the plant over here? Because they knew that people weren’t going to speak up,” Lavigne said. “And they were right. The people weren’t going to speak up. That’s when God touched me and told me to fight — and that’s what I did.”\n\n2023: Sister Rosemary Connelly, R.S.M.\n\nSister Rosemary Connelly is the former executive director of Misericordia, a Chicago-based not-for-profit agency offering a community of care that maximizes potential for people with mild to profound developmental disabilities, many of whom are also physically challenged. Misericordia means “heart of mercy” in Latin.\n\nWhen Sister Connelly came to Misericordia as executive director in 1969, the nonprofit on Chicago’s south side provided a home and custodial care for children with disabilities from birth to age 6. Though the children were well cared for, they did not have access to educational and enrichment activities — as was typical at the time.\n\nSister Connelly, however, believed passionately that the children were capable of more and deserved a higher quality of life. She began seeking out special education programming for them and when she found that nothing yet existed, she developed her own.\n\nRead more at nd.edu/stories/heart-of-mercy/.\n\n2024: Claire Babineaux-Fontenot\n\nClaire Babineaux-Fontenot often says that one of her greatest gifts came in “an ugly package.”\n\nIn 2015, she was diagnosed with cancer. And as she was sitting in the doctor’s office, letting those words wash over her, she came to a realization.\n\nShe’d been living as though she had all the time in the world and, in that moment, she was forced to acknowledge that none of us does.\n\n“I asked myself, ‘What if the best thing I could do in my career was the best thing I could conceivably do in my current job. Would that be OK?’” she said. “And in my heart I knew the answer was no. In that moment I decided, right there in that office, that I was going to leave the job that I was in.\n\n“For the first time in my career, I was going to take a leap of faith.”\n\nAt the time, Babineaux-Fontenot was the executive vice president of finance and global treasurer at Walmart—the culmination of 13 years on Walmart’s leadership team and a career spanning three decades of increasingly high-profile positions in government, law firms, and corporations.\n\nBut she felt a strong calling from God that she was being led to a higher purpose.\n\n“I was a tax lawyer—I’m about dotting i’s and crossing t’s. I do five-year plans. I do three-year strategies. I thought, ‘Why am I not scared?’” she said. “But I truly did not feel afraid, and I am so grateful for that guidance. I just trusted that He would take me to where He wanted me to be.”\n\nThat moment led her to Feeding America, where she became chief executive officer in 2018.\n\nRead her story"
