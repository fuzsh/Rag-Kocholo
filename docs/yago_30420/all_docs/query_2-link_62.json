I served with him at the GWOT Memorial Foundation and I was always impressed by his ability to connect the team’s mission to the work at hand. He clearly communicated the team’s goals and consistently highlighted his teammates’ contributions. His dedication to teamwork, coalition building, and relationship management will benefit any team that’s fortunate to work with him. I highly recommend him to any mission-focused organization.”\n\n“Andrew is one of those people that does what he says and does it excellently. Always willing to get his hands dirty to ensure a project exceeds expectations - like sleeping in a truck bed in the rain at a FEMA camp to set the conditions for us to win projects that doubled our regional revenue over the course of 1 year and bring jobs back to a devastated community. ”"
