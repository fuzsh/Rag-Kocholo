The role has been in casting for several months now and several names including Austin Peck and Dax Griffin were being considered for the role. March is well known for his role as Scott Chandler which he portrayed from 1999 to 2000. Look for this contract role to start airing in late June to early July.\n\n© Soaps In Depth\n\nExcerpt from About.com 6/3/05: Forbes March\n\nThis summer look for Forbes March (ex-Scott, AMC. MUTANT X) to join OLTL in the role of Nash, an enigmatic stranger who will enter Tess’s life, and thus, cause further problems for Jessica. Nash will first appear in Llanview on Thursday, July 7.\n\n© About.com\n\nExcerpt from Soap Opera Digest 7/05: Forbes March\n\nMeet the Llanview Newbies\n\nBy Mala Bhattacharjee\n\nIn one long heat wave, ONE LIFE TO LIVE welcomes Tika Sumpter's Layla Williamson, Josh Casaubon's Hugh Hughes, and Forbes March (ex-Scott, AMC) as Nash.\n\n....\n\nWhat about Mr. One Name, Nash? \"He's coming on with a bang,\" promises Higley.\n\n\"I think he is great looking also,\" says Gammie. \"And I think we can dress him [accordingly]. We don't really know very much about him, other than he's clearly a striver. He obviously wants to make a lot of money but isn't there yet, but desperately wants to fit in. And I think he's trying very hard to look like he fits in.\"\n\nIt appears that fitting in and getting fitted properly go hand-in-hand in Llanview and according to Higley, \"The casting process is tricky but I think we did really well.\" And now it's up to the viewers to see if this trio of newcomers will be more than just a summer fling.\n\n© Soap Opera Digest\n\nSoap Opera Digest 12/13/05: Forbes March, on Esprit Libre\n\nBest Triangle of 2005: Tess/Nash/Jessica, OLTL\n\nWith Llanview mired in romantic angst for much of the year, OLTL viewers had to look out of town for the bright spot: hot, new couple Tess and Nash. Sure, they moved a little fast from being complete strangers exchanging barbs to soul mates reciting life-affirming soliloquies, but they're just so irresistibly fun and loose together that you can't help but root for them. Their cute, modest life in New York and Napa pleased some viewers so much that they would've preferred a half-hour Tess and nash spin-off to having Jessica resurface and threaten to erase them. So why, you may ask, are we including this as best \"triangle\"? Because frankly, even as Jessica fights to rid herself of Tess -- and by extension, Nash -- she still has more chemistry with him than she ever did with Antonio.\n\n© Soap Opera Digest\n\nExcerpt from Soapdom 12/25/05: Forbes March\n\nMost Memorable Soap Moments of 2005 ~ Part 1\n\nSunday, 25 December 2005 16:00 Feature Article Contributor Phyllis A. Tremblay\n\nNext would be the casting of Forbes March as Nash Brennan. Granted this is not March's first daytime role but his presence as All My Children's Scott Chandler did not make the same impression as his portrayal of Nash Brennan. From the moment I saw him in his Miami Vice type white suit, I was hooked. From what I've been reading the audience literally fell in love with Nash at the same time that Tess fell for Nash. This is no small coup; he came in to break up the existing super couple, Antonio and Jessica. He not only succeeded, he won the hearts of everyone along the way. I don't know how Jessica's DID storyline is going to play out but I hope it includes a reunion for Tess and Nash. March has been like a breath of fresh air. It is so refreshing to see a model who can really act. I am so happy that March elected to pursue a career in daytime rather than continue his path down the Sci-Fi trail.\n\n© Soapdom\n\nSoaps In Depth 1/3/06: Forbes March, on Esprit Libre\n\nFinding Forbes\n\nIt wasn't easy casting the guy who would turn Jessica's life upside down. As Bree Williamson (jessica/Tess) explains, there were a lot of guys eager to jump into the meaty role. \"Every week we were like, 'Another screen test for Nash?'\" the actress recalls. \"They searched high and low for the character -- it was unbelievable.\" And then one day, everything changed. An actor auditioned who Williamson says made everyone sit up and take notice. \"Forbes [March] just came in, and it was so obvious,\" his now-leading lady says. \"He did everything that they had been looking for.\" The powers that be, she explains, were interested in finding not just someone who could act the part, but who would truly inhabit it. \"Forbes did it without any effort. They were looking for someone who just really was Nash.\" Fortunately for viewers, they found him!\n\n© Soap Opera Digest\n\nSoaps In Depth 4/11/06: Forbes March, on Esprit Libre\n\nMyth or Reality?\n\nThe One Life to Live character of Nash was created specifically for portrayer Forbes March.\n\nMYTH: In fact, nothing could be further from the truth! According to headwriter Dena Higley, the show searched high and low for Tess' would-be loveer before finally finding just the right guy for the role. \"I knew that story was money in the bank, but it wouldn't work unless the two actors had great chemistry,\" says the writer. \"We were getting down to the wire in casting the part. In fact, we actually had to slow the story down because we didn't have a Nash! I had to come up with a few extra beats in the story to stall.\" Just how desperate were they before Mr. Right -- aka March -- walked through the door? \"We were pulling waiters out of restaurants, asking if they wanted to audition,\" she says with a laugh.\n\n© Soaps In Depth\n\nExcerpt from Soapnet video 5/14/06: Forbes March and Bree Williamson (Miranda Davis in \"Crossroads of the Soul\")\n\nIf It's Not One Thing, It's Your Mother: Soapnet's The Best of Jess and Tess Marathon\n\nBree Williamson: Hi, I'm Bree Williamson, and you're watching The Best of Jess and Tess on Soapnet. And look who has stopped by, my very good friend and co-star Forbes March, who most of you might know as the irrisistable Nash Brennan.\n\nForbes March: Hey. What's going on?\n\nBree: Well, we're taking a look back at some of my favorite Jess/Tess episodes, and the next one's really good. It's the one where you and Antonio get face to face.\n\nForbes: Oooh. Yeah, I remember that one. That's the one when Nash, me, thought that Tess was cheating on him, and Antonio came along and, um...well, that's where things really went twisty!\n\nBree: Well, when Antonio sent Nash straight?\n\nForbes: Keep watching. Find out. [Break] Nash and Tess's relationship, it's a lot of fun because it's a tumultuous relationship.\n\n....\n\nForbes: Nash would be a great dad. And not because of any rules about what being a dad is. I think that all you can do as a parent, and I'm speaking as much from Hope as from knowledge of being a father, is want to be a good parent. I think he's very much looking forward to making up for the errors of his parents. He really wants to be a father. Someone who's excited to be a parent and keeps that excitement alive is gonna be a good parent.\n\n....\n\nForbes: Nash has something for the sort of naughty fun girls. There's sort of a naughty fun side to Nash. But then as Nash got to know a bit more about Tess, another side of Nash was discovered, that he probably didn't even know about. Sort of a, more of a fathering side of him. That as he realized that Tess needed help, I think it's made Nash rise to the occasion and become a better person, trying to help her through that journey. And sometimes he gets confused and becomes selfish. And then other times he becomes incredibly supportive. And that's one of the things that we like about Nash, is that he's never quite simple. He's always trying to weigh out all these different forces in him. But it's progressed from simply sort of a fast, romantic, exciting, dramatic kind of thing into a really profound relationship, you know, with a child...which may or may not be mine.\n\n© Soapnet\n\nExcerpt from Soap Zone 8/28/06: Forbes March\n\nNews for the week of 28-Aug-2006\n\nby Carol Banks Weber\n\nIt’s a testament to Dan Gauthier’s quality of character (meant for the actor, the man and the role he took on admirably) that the likes of multiple-Emmy winner Erika Slezak (Viki), Kassie DePaiva (Blair), Trevor St. John (Todd) and Forbes Nash (March) went out on a limb, possibly risking unwanted notice from TPTB, to help save one of their favorite colleagues.\n\n....\n\nForbes March (Nash) really put his feelings on the line with his August 25th post on Gauthier’s message board. It made us all proud and like these actors a lot better than we have been during the tough times. And, it’s worth printing in its entirety for inspiration: “When entertaining and good actors with a strong and well earned fan base are dropped as the result of a quantitative study, our entire craft and the profession of story telling as an industry is at risk. Accountants should not get creative with either taxes OR the story.\n\n“I don't want to bite the hand that feeds me, but I wish you all luck in your campaign to save Dan's job. Oh, and Dan... your Best Supporting Actor vote from our cast mates was well deserved and I find your performances formidable and they set the bar on our show amoungst the men. Don't know if I ever told you I thought so. Go get 'em!\n\nForbes March.”\n\n© Soap Zone\n\nExcerpt from Soapdom 9/13/06: Forbes March\n\nSoap Actors Come Clean on Character Names\n\nWednesday, 13 September 2006 08:42\n\nForbes March (Nash, OLTL) “I don’t know what it means, but it gave me the whole inspiration for this kind of -- (he kind of shuffles off to Buffalo) – as soon as I heard that I just kind of had that view for how this guy was gonna move. Come on, you got a name like Nash!”\n\n© Soapdom\n\nExcerpt from TV Guide 11/12/06: Forbes March, Bree Williamson on TV Fanforum\n\nSpoilerific One Life to Live Wedding Preview!\n\nSweeps soap-opera weddings are full of high drama. On Wednesday, Nov. 8, the Bridezilla du jour is One Life to Live's Jessica Buchanan (Bree Williamson) who is strolling down the aisle to marry longtime beau Antonio Vega (Kamar de los Reyes). Problem is, the bride-to-be must first contend with Nash Brennan (Forbes March), with whom she conceived a baby as \"Tess.\" (Just FYI, Tess is Jess's sassy split personality.) Will Jessica marry Antonio or will Nash convince her to ditch her groom? Spoiler alert! Read no further if you prefer to stay in suspense before watching the wedding! OK, don't say you weren't warned.\n\n\"Jessica is beyond high maintenance,\" OLTL head writer Dena Higley tells TVGuide.com with a laugh. \"This is Llanview, where half the weddings don't take place anyway! Nash tries to talk her out of the wedding and she has a moment where she freaks out. Then she's going down the aisle and sees both her men wearing tuxes at the altar.\n\n\"She does stop in the middle of the wedding ceremony and have this whispered conversation with Nash,\" Higley previews. \"It's like, 'One moment, Antonio. Nash and I have some unfinished business.' But then she declares her love for Antonio. They actually do get married � and Nash is left heartbroken.\"\n\n© TV Guide\n\nExcerpt from The Sudsy News Roundup 12/18/06: Forbes March\n\nThe suds report: Dec. 18, 2006\n\nBy Nelson Branco\n\nForbes March, One Life to Live: McSteamy and McDreamy all in one\n\nGrey’s Anatomy may have Patrick “McDreamy” Dempsey and Eric “McSteamy” Dane, but One Life to Live has morphed all that deliciousness in one fine actor: Forbes March (Nash). The oh-so sexy, oh-so adorable, and oh-so talented March is that rare kind of leading man who comes around in daytime once every decade. Whenever March is lucky to be on screen, it’s pure magic from the moment the hilarious actor opens those dreamy eyes of his and utters his witty dialogue, but unfortunately the former Torontonian is also one of the most underrated performers in the business. Ever since he debuted on OLTL as the sweet and sexy rascal, Nash Brennan, we haven’t been able to keep our eyes off this Prince Charming … that is when he’s actually on-screen. Although the writers crafted one of Llanview’s most memorable love stories with Tess and Nash, after Jessica and Tess integrated, Nash not only lost his soul mate but he’s also been unfairly backburnered — and it’s ticking us off big time. Not since Jake and Megan, has a Llanview couple captured our imagination, and the death of super-couple Tess and Nash is a severe blow to a show that is in dire need of romance. Sure, Nash could fall in love Jessica, but thanks to Bree Williamson’s brilliant and unique portrayal of the trouble-making, surly personality, nuJessica is no Tess — and Nash just doesn’t click with her the same way he did with the mother of his child. It’s perplexing as to why the writers have dropped the ball when it comes to March. This actor is capable of anything and understands how to play subtext and bring nuance to a character, so why hasn’t Nash moved on with his life or been given his own character-defining storyline? We hardly know anything about his mysterious past, so the possibilities are endless. Hey, Santa: all we want for Christmas is more Nash, preferably sans T-shirt – is that too much to ask for?\n\n© Bell Canada\n\nExcerpt from TV Guide 1/18/07: Forbes March\n\nThe accidental heartthrob\n\nBy Nelson Branco\n\nHalifax’s Forbes March is bringing sexy back to daytime television with his infectious portrayal of a bad boy with a heart of gold on One Life To Live. Every few years or so, an unexpected thing happens on daytime TV: a beautiful stranger arrives in the soap world, reminding the world that true men do really exist — even if we can’t ignore the fact that these sexy delicacies are indeed becoming an endangered species. When Halifax native — and former Toronto resident — Forbes March landed in Llanview in July 2005, the romantically-starved soap opera gave daytime a healthy dose of McDreamy-itis. Although Nash Brennan is no doctor, the irresistible former con man makes our heart skip a beat with his attentive bedside manner and belief that in the end love does conquer all — even if your true love has another dominant personality that must be integrated and thus lost forever! And March is just as romantic in his real life as he is in his reel world: he married his Italian sweetheart Vanessa, whom he met when he lived in Milan as a successful model (the couple has two children together).\n\n....\n\nTVG: Battlestar Galactica became a critical darling and ratings hit right when you left the sci-fi world — any regrets?\n\nFM: Mutant X was a big shot in the arm for me and really allowed me to grow, but I so screwed up on Battlestar. The day Mutant was cancelled, I was offered a role on Battlestar and I passed on it. I had no idea how big it was going to be.\n\nTVG: Were you shocked that Nash and Tess became such a big hit?\n\nFM: I honestly didn’t think Nash and Tess would last longer than a few months. They basically saw it as a summer storyline until the audience loved us together. Unfortunately, Nash was left in the lurch after Tess was integrated, but now they are addressing that. It seems like Jessica and Nash have the same chemistry that Nash and Tess did so hopefully they’ll keep it exciting. The story of Tess and Nash was so wonderful because they both saved each other. The way I imagined Nash was he didn’t trust anyone, but Nash trusted Tess, and that’s very romantic.\n\nTVG: Both you and Bree Williamson (Jessica/Tess) are both from Canada — does that help with your chemistry?\n\nFM: Bree and I get along amazingly. We squabble a lot like two squirrels over a walnut — we’re like brother and sister off camera. We’ve worked together before on Mutant so we already knew each other.\n\nTVG: How often do you visit Canada?\n\nFM: I don’t visit as often as I would like. I went back to Halifax for the first time in eight years this past holiday season, and it was pretty fantastic. I’m walking around with a Nova Scotia pin on my jacket right now — I had forgotten how Canadian I really am. It’s a small town, and when you’re 18 you’re dying to get out of there, but when you’re older all you do is think about getting back there.\n\nTVG: What is the length of your OLTL contract?\n\nFM: I guaranteed them another two years.\n\nTVG: Is it safe to say that Nash is your favourite character so far?\n\nFM: Yes, Nash really is the one that really resonates with me. I can really relate to him. Nashville, baby!\n\nTVG: Any plans to cut your trademark long locks?\n\nFM: I was thinking about cutting it but the show wants it long. And I agree that’s best for Nash, but I personally like shorter hair for maintenance. There should always be an element to Nash that reminds me that he doesn’t belong. He’s like the Great Gatsby — always an outsider.\n\n© TV Guide\n\nExcerpt from Soap Central 1/15/07: Forbes March\n\nThe year that was\n\nby EY Jackson For the Week of January 15, 2007\n\nI missed our annual Best/Worst love-fest, so here it is: Llanview's Best and Worst for 2006! We'll kick it off with Llanview's Best Couple Award.\n\nBest Couple\n\nEasily, the best couple of 2006 was Tess and Nash.\n\n....\n\nTess and Nash were great from the start. I love the playful side of Bree Williamson's acting. Through Tess, she plays the perfect little coy flirt that you either want to be or be-with. She's the perfect foil to Nash's strait-laced wanna-be-good-boy. I never bought the good-little-boy thing with Nash, not for a minute. How could I? Yes, the blond hair and the cherub twinkle can be a bit disarming, but if you thought that he'd always used his powers for good, . . . man, I am sooooooo so sorry for how surprised you were when you found out that Claudia was telling the truth. That one had to have hurt, pretty bad. Maybe Claudia ending up in the loony bin had finally convinced Nash to be good by the time Tess came along, but no way was this beautiful, sexy little mystery gonna be his moment of enlightenment. The thing I instantly loved about Nash is the fact that Forbes March makes it easy to know Nash's background from the moment you first look at him. Yet, even though Nash is so easy to peg, I find that I still want to know about the people who raised him. But not yet. It's like getting to know Evangeline in the days before Layla. Hm . . . maybe that's why I like seeing him with Layla now. Oh, but that's now. We were talking about 06. Nash and Tess, Best Couple of 2006. They were sassy together, playful, flirtatious, and then . . . slowly and easily . . . they were in love. I like the way they fight and I like the way they love each other. Jury's still out on Nash and Tessica. She's quite a handful, isn't she?\n\n© Soap Central\n\nExcerpt from She Knows Soaps.com 2/13/07: Forbes March, Bree Williamson\n\nVCR/TiVo Valentine's Alert !\n\nTuesday, February 13 2007\n\nFans won't want to miss a special Valentine's Day episode of One Life to Live this Wednesday!

She ain’t got a thing on OLTL executive producer Frank Valentini. He clamped down on a moratorium against Forbes March (Nash) in particular making any hairstyle changes. March claimed that a lot of the flack stemmed from a fairly recent Soap Opera Weekly blurb about him wanting to change his hair style. Ever since that blurb came out, March said, Valentini has come down hard about the actor not ever ever in a million years being able to make one damned change. In protest, March showed up for work in a ponytail, which Valentini made him keep from now on.\n\n© Soapzone\n\nTwo Scoops 4/16/07: Forbes March\n\nMaking sense of madness\n\nOne bright light in an ongoing sea of darkness is Forbes March.

And for those who aren’t aware of this, Forbes will be cruising the seas with the fans for the 2009 Soap Cruise!\n\n© Soaps.com\n\nColumn of Life 4/20/08: Forbes March\n\nSunday Song: Forbes Marches On\n\nThere won't be an official confirmation, however, most of Forbes March's fans who spend time on the 'net know already that he has been let go by One Life to Live. And those in the know are aware that it has a lot to do with the purging of those characters created by Dena Higley's reign as the show's head writer. It is not because this man has talent and is easy on the soap watcher's eyes. He will be sorely missed in a show that needs actors and characters with charisma. Mr. March had more than a little success in Italy, not the least of which is Vanessa, his lovely wife and the Italian mother of his two children. In his honour this week is the music of Francesco Puccioni, who was born at 01:20 on April 26, 1961 in Florence, Italy. Puccioni's musical persona is expressed as Mike Francis. That persona has created music that can be beautiful, funky and intricate all at once.

Although ABC is staying tightlipped on this rumor, and the details of how it'll all play out are unsure, Soaps.com has learned that Forbes March is leaving the show! The coming months are already proving to be spectacular for the soap – given all of the high profile returns the show is planning, but this is definitely a big shocker - and an upsetting one! We’ve watched and wondered about Nash as he took up with this new mysterious business partner and have cringed with worry while he continues to get sucked deeper into debt through many tempting promises presented to him. So, how will it all play out? Will the show kill this fan favorite off after he has made it into the hearts of many through the Antonio/Jessica/Nash storyline - or will Nash simply walk away from Llanview for good? I, personally, can say… I am truly saddened that Forbes March is indeed leaving the show - no matter how it all plays out. Since coming to One Life to Live in July of 2005, Forbes has done a remarkable job and will sorely be missed by fans. Soaps.com has learned that his final air date will be June 5, 2008.\n\n© She Knows\n\nThe Soap Dispenser 6/2/08: Forbes March\n\nForbes Marches Off One Life to Live\n\nPosted on June 2nd, 2008 11:02 AM by A.C. Powers\n\nThe character of Nash meets his demise on June 5 on One Life to Live. The move comes as a disappointment to fan favorite Forbes March, who has the best name in daytime television history and told Soap Opera Digest that he had a sinking suspicion his days were numbered. “I started suspecting it last August,” the actor said, revealing that he did actually approach the executive producer, but the honcho shrugged off his concerns as “paranoid.”\n\n© The Soap Dispenser\n\nSoaps.com 6/9/08: Forbes March\n\nOne Life to Live: In Memory of Nash Brennan…\n\nMonday, June 09 2008\n\nLast Thursday Llanview lost one of its most popular residents, and at the same time One Life to Live fans everywhere became overwhelmed with grief by the death of Nash Brennan (Forbes March). Sound a bit too melodramatic? Maybe, but I couldn’t ignore all of the outpouring posts left under the daily recap surrounding Nash’s death or left in our messages boards without giving the character, and the amazing actor who played him, a proper send off. Although I found out, back on April 29, 2008, that Forbes March would be leaving his role, I’ll admit, there hasn’t been an episode in daytime that has brought me to my knees and had me reaching for a ton of tissues like Nash’s death. All I can say is I’m glad that I don’t have to look at the keys on my keyboard in order to type or I never would have been able to bring you all the recap for that episode. I was literally bawling my head off – as were many fans around the world who watched Nash take his final breath after tracing a heart shape on Jessica's (Bree Williamson) palm.\n\nSince coming to the show in July of 2005, Nash has had to fight for the affection of fans, especially Jessica/Antonio fans. However, after their affair broke up that married, fans didn’t become totally sold on the Jessica/Nash union until Jessica’s near death. It was then that the love between Nash and Jessica became ‘real’ and nothing about her alter Tess. While I love all the actors on the show and feel their pain when they move on and leave their beloved characters behind, it killed me to have to mark ‘past’ next to Nash’s/Forbes’ name in his profile under our One Life to Live Cast List. But, this is daytime after all, and as fans we’ve been forced to deal with these types of disappointments in the past and will continue to do so in the future. I know I can speak for a lot of fans when I say… Forbes, we are going to miss you dearly and have enjoyed watching you for the last three years. We wish you the very best and hope to see you in daytime again very soon! Speaking of which, there have been some rumors circulating the net claiming that Forbes has been spotted in the General Hospital studios. However, at this time, there has been no word on a possible west coast role for the actor.\n\nTo close out Soaps.com’s In Memory, I have to give props to Bree Williamson (Jessica) for her fabulous performance. Her tears, like ours, were real, and Bree’s scenes were definitely Emmy deserving! Farewell, Forbes, we’ll miss you...

There had been speculation by some that March and Williamson would ride off into the sunset together. In the wake of Nash's tragic fall through a skylight last week, it soon became very clear that that would not happen.\n\n© Soap Central\n\nSoapnet promo video 4/14/09: Forbes March and Bree Williamson (Miranda Davis in \"Crossroads of the Soul\")\n\nOne Life to Live: Nash & Jessica Promo\n\nForbes March: Nash's relationship with Jessica is complicated!\n\nBree Williamson: Jessica and Nash are having fun, finally!\n\nForbes: He still sees the Tess in Jess.\n\nBree: They're at home with their baby, and having a nice, fun time.\n\nForbes: The bits of the old Jess in the new Jess are the bits that Nash missed in Tess and finds in the new one.\n\nBree: They are sublimely happy with one another.\n\n© Soapnet\n\nExcerpt from The Actor's Studio 5/18/09: Forbes March\n\nFinding Forbes March\n\nYou were voted One Life to Live’s sexiest actor and one of America‘s 50 most Beautiful People in 1999?\n\nYeah.\n\n....\n\nHow would you compare making a soap opera to a series?\n\nOn soaps they’re very neutral scenes to begin with….in soaps if they don’t like you they won’t keep you. You can kind of be yourself. Once I was messing around and I based Nash on an animated fox. There’s a scene where Robin Hood dresses like a stork…I would just spin around.\n\n....\n\nYou learn something new every day. I saw there was a big petition to keep your character on One Life to Live.\n\nYeah, something about Nash really connected with the audience. When they killed Nash they were very upset and there was a big campaign to keep me on the show. It's strange to have thousands of people you've never met writing in your support. It's nice...it's kind of mystifying. Soap fans are wonderful people!\n\n© The Actor's Studio\n\nExcerpt from Soap Opera Weekly 6/1/09: Forbes March, on Musing ATWT PEG Fan\n\nA Closer Look: Forbes\n\nWeekly: Do you still keep in touch with some of your OLTL co-stars?\n\nMarch: Not a lot of them. It's strange; when you work in the film industry, you become so close with people, and when you stop working, it's like you moved to another country. Except Bree Williamson (Jessica). A friend threw a total surprise party, and Bree was there with her husband. That was wonderful. I hadn't seen her since my last day. It was good to see her again. I miss her. Make sure you print that: I miss her! Because she made a point of saying, \"I miss you.\"\n\n© Soap Opera Weekly\n\nExcerpt from We Love Soaps 7/25/09: Forbes March\n\nSoap Actors In Other Places: Forbes March\n\nSaturday, July 25, 2009 Posted by Roger Newcomb\n\nBefore he landed his role as Professor Mason Jarvis on AS THE WORLD TURNS, Forbes March had already built an impressive resume of TV and film roles including as ONE LIFE TO LIVE's Nash. Here's a sampling of his pre-ATWT work.\n\n....\n\nONE LIFE TO LIVE: March create the role of Nash Brennan in 2005 and played the part for three years before the character was killed off.\n\n© We Love Soaps\n\nExcerpt from TV Guide Canada 10/28/09: Forbes March\n\nForward, March\n\nBy Nelson Branco 2009-10-28\n\nIn a revealing interview, Forbes March announces he’s left ‘As The World Turns’, reflects on playing an ill-conceived gay character, sounds off on his ‘One Life’ firing, and confesses ABC originally wanted him back as Scott Chandler on ‘AMC.’\n\n....\n\nTVG: The soap media, however, immediately praised your work in your breakout role, Nash Brennan on One Life.\n\nFM: Thank you. I wish they had written an exit storyline sooner. I had wanted to leave a long time before they finally killed Nash.\n\nTVG: In the current storyline, a mysterious person is stalking Jessica. She believes it’s Nash or Nash’s ghost.\n\nFM: Yeah, I heard! Someone who keeps leaving hearts for her, right? [Laughs] I don’t know if you remember this but Nash drew a little heart from his breath when he was outside of Jessica’s hospital room. It’s funny because I got a lot of heat from the producers/directors for that. It was a spur of the moment decision on my part, but in the end, they kept it in. So it’s cool to hear they’re still using Nash’s calling card on the show. I take that as a compliment.\n\nTVG: Fans were hoping you’d return to One Life as Nash’s evil twin brother, Dash!\n\nFM: I wouldn’t object to that! His name could be Splash!\n\nTVG: Or Hash. You must have been thrilled when Bree Williamson was nominated for an outstanding supporting actress Emmy Award earlier this year.\n\nFM: Yes, I was. I was disappointed she didn’t win. Bree has been acting out her little heart out for years.\n\nTVG: It was clear to me that you truly loved playing Nash with all your heart, too. Do you harbour any residual resentment towards One Life for writing him into a corner?\n\nFM: Usually when I leave a job, there tends to be some hard feelings involved, but I have to say, in hindsight, I loved my time there and working with [executive producer] Frank Valentini, who is a fantastic producer. If you bring a good idea to the table, he’ll figure out a way to include it. He encourages a dialogue between cast and crew across the board. A lot of actors have contributed to the writing of the show. One Life opens its doors to the cast and crew which is very rare in this business. Frank is also always on the floor, very hands-on. He’s in the trenches with us. A couple of times, I remember we were taping heavy scenes between Antonio, Jessica, and Nash and Frank actually shut down production so we could go into his office and hash it all out. What Frank is able to do on that show, considering his budget and his ability to come in under budget, well, it’s pretty spectacular. Frank is clearly behind the steering wheel.\n\nTVG: Which is why it’s sad to hear that ABC may cancel One Life instead of All My Children next year.\n\nFM: [Aggravated] It makes no financial sense to cancel One Life. If two shows are garnering the same ratings, why would you cancel the show that costs less and is more profitable for the network? I’m not privy to any inside information but it makes no sense to me if these rumours are true.\n\nTVG: And One Life is the best show on daytime TV right now, while All My Kids is the worst show on the tube. Are you sad that you’re not on One Life right now considering its quality these days?\n\nFM: I understood why they let me go. There are two different ways to view writing on soaps. There is the day-to-day, and long-term storytelling. On the day-to-day front, I thought they wrote Nash fantastically. But as soon as they paired an 'integrated' Jessica with Nash, I knew the end was near. It is very rare when all the ducks are in a row. We had that with Tess and Nash — we all shared a common goal and vision for this couple. Nash and Tess were a spectacular success. When I got into an elevator, people would immediately talk to me about Nash to the point where it was almost annoying. It was insane. He was ridiculously popular. Nash and Tess reminded me a lot of the relationship between Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd on Moonlighting.\n\nThe problem happened when they were reunited so quickly. One Life should have milked this star-crossed romance for years. Integrating Jessica was a fatal error because Jessica wasn’t as interesting as Tess. By eliminating Tess and pairing Nash with Jessica, well, the story was over at that point. There was no more story to tell. I had no family, even though they teased the audience with the possibility that Paige could be his mother. The Claudia story lasted about a minute so that didn’t count. When One Life started auditioning other guys [for the role of Jared], I saw the writing on the wall. I wished they had killed Nash far sooner. Having Jared accidentally kill Nash was such a lightweight and unimaginative way to go about it. This whole need to please the daytime fans is killing the genre. I think it’s a fatal flaw. It’s a catch-22 because by giving the fans what they want, you ultimately kill their favourite storyline. Look at Romeo and Juliet, for example. During the first scene in the play, Romeo and Juliet make eye contact. Based on that eye contact, the audience wants them together. But if you put them together at the end of that first party, the show is over. You don’t give the audience what they want — that’s the whole art of storytelling. Once you do that, the story is over. Period.\n\nTVG: If One Life truly wanted to give the audience what they wanted, Tess would be the dominant personality — and Nash and Tess would be together.\n\nFM: I used to go to Frank’s office on a regular basis, and say, “Frank, I know you’re writing me out! I’m fine with that — get me off the show.” And, of course, the last time I did that, he admitted they had already written me out. That’s how I found out I was leaving the show. I went up there to pitch an exit story for Nash, but they beat me to the punch. Listen, I wasn’t working a lot so I wasn’t making any money anyway. And creatively, the last few storylines sucked the life out of me. That whole thing with Jared and Nash fighting for the TV remote control was just bogus. Nash was a special character, so I feel they dropped the ball when it came to his potential. I would have preferred it if perhaps Natalie and Jared had done something like lock up Nash in the secret room in the basement and then later Nash dies a hero. I felt the storyline leading up to Nash’s death was just embarrassing storytelling. In the end, Jared was the hero and it made Nash look bad. “Here’s how we’ll write out Nash, let’s have Jared accidentally push Nash through a skylight!” Seriously? Come on! The audience was bored to death with that story. Whatever.\n\nTVG: Yeah, I always considered Nash to be one of soaps’ most loyal and loving heroes. I think most fans are still mourning Nash. To be fair, Ron came back from the writers’ strike with a lot of material to fix. But I agree, the BE takeover was just bad Dynasty. Luckily, the show is back to its spectacular self. But it is funny to note that historically, One Life hasn’t had much success with super-couples. When they luck out and find one like Tess and Nash, the writers inevitably ruin the storyline for some strange reason.\n\nFM: I knew when Jessica and Nash wed in the hospital that we were done. They put a pretty little button on the couple by marrying them off like that.\n\nTVG: I was also pissed off that Nash and Jess didn’t warrant a big wedding. Heck, Antonio and Jessica got all the bells and whistles —and they weren’t even the endgame.\n\nFM: Dena Higley created that storyline and I think she wanted to put a pretty bow on their wedding/reunion as she walked out the door. I will be forever grateful to Dena for creating that storyline and my character. Originally, I took the One Life job because I thought it was just going to be a summer gig. I didn’t even move out my family to New York that summer — I commuted back and forth. Luckily, Nash took off.\n\n....\n\nTVG: [Joking] Be very afraid! [Laughs] So, are you over soaps?\n\nFM: I’m not over soaps. I love acting. I honestly don’t see any differences between acting mediums. Yes, there are pay differences and surely a prejudice associated with soap work, but for me, acting is acting. I’ll pretty much act in anything that pays me appropriately to the budget and if I am cast in role I want to sink my teeth into. I’d go back to a soap any day. I’d do indie films again. I’d do sci-fi again, too. I wouldn’t mind booking a prime-time show just because of the schedule, to be honest. When I was on Mutant X, I really missed the four-camera aspect of soaps. I think soaps are the best medium for an actor to work in to be honest with you. It’s like theatre. There are three walls, four cameras, and you get to improvise. Remember when Nash gave a three-page monologue to the stars and moons early on with Tess? It was a huge turning point in their romance because that’s when Nash told Tess for the first time that he was in love with her on the fire escape. I had over 60 pages of dialogue that day because we shot an entire week’s worth of episodes all in one day as Nash and Tess were isolated from the rest of the story. When I got to the aforementioned monologue, I told Frank and Larry [Carpenter, One Life's director] that I didn’t know the speech. Frank simply said, “You know the story so just talk and we’ll keep the camera on.” That doesn’t happen in other mediums. And what came out of that was a beautiful, heartfelt admission of love from Nash. That was one of the most enjoyable acting experiences I have ever had in my career. Those are the moments when you realized why you got into the business.\n\nTVG: Now I really miss Nash!\n\nFM: So do I!\n\nTVG: One Life is kill-happy when it comes to Jessica and Natalie’s love interests. They’re killing off Jared soon.\n\nFM: Yeah, I heard that. Jessica is becoming the Erica Kane of One Life! And you know that they’re not getting rid of Bree anytime soon. I learned if you profess your love to Jessica you can never profess your love to anyone else.\n\nTVG: In a perfect world, Jessica wouldn’t either.\n\n© TV Guide Canada"
