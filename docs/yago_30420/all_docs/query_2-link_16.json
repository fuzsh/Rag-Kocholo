        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Nash\n\nNash is a stylish name derived from an English surname, originating from the Middle English phrase atten ash, meaning ‘at the ash tree.’ It could also mean ‘cliff’ in Old English. It is also considered a topographical or habitational name for people from places called Nash in England and Wales or Ireland. Some people consider Nash the Americanized form of certain Jewish surnames, which was later used as a first name in its own right.\n\nThe ash tree is considered sacred in several cultures. For instance, Celts believe the ash tree has healing properties and protects them from bad influences. In Norse mythology, the ash tree branches were used to create the first humans. An Ash tree in general exudes power due to its size and use to humans and nature alike.\n\nThe name has been used in Ireland and Wales since the Middle Ages. One of its earliest uses is recorded as Ate Nasse in the 13th century. However, the name got popular as a given name due to the 1997 TV show Nash Bridges. Don Johnson played the eponymous titular character in this famous police-procedural series. It got more exposure from a character named Nash, appearing on the 2005 soap opera One Life to Live.\n\nThe Nash surname has several variations, including Naish and Nashe, but it’s unclear if these have also been used as first names. Although Nash is a short name, some common nicknames are Ash, Nashy, and Na, they are rarely used due to the name’s brevity.\n\nNash has appeared in pop culture as a first name and a surname. One example is One Life to Live, featuring the suave Nash Brennan, an aspiring vineyard owner. Likewise, the M.A.S.K. media franchise fans might recognize Nash “Goon” Gorey, a hacker and spy. He also made an appearance in the D.C. comics.\n\nNash Wells, aka Harrison Wells, played by Tom Cavanagh, Charlie Nash from the Street Fighter video game series, and Russell Nash in the 1986 fantasy action-adventure movie Highlander are a few more fictional characters who carry the name Nash.\n\nHow To Pronounce Nash?\n\n‘Nash’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Nash\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Nash famous with their contributions in various fields.
