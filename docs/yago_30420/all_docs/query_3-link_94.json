        "text": "In this talk, Jessica brings a simple shift in perspective as she outlines the similarities she faced during her kidnapping, to those we may be feeling at such a historical time as this. The commonality of uncertainty will align as Jessica recounts the helplessness she experienced during her 93 days as a hostage. She will examine the loss of control she felt, over even the most basic of needs, and discuss the hardships associated with the KNOWING things are going to end, versus the BELIEVING they will, and how that affects our coping strategies in the midst of crisis.\n\nThrough her story telling, Jessica reminds us that we are more resilient than we think we are, and how working our way through this marathon of complication is an opportunity for us to see what we are truly capable of as a collective community.\n\nJessica teaches her audiences to use humor to help shift perspective, and shares the necessary skill of visualization and referring to the past, as useful tools to successfully manage trauma.\n\nBased off of Jessica’s powerful TEDx Talk (link coming soon!)
