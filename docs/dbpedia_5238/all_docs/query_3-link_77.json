Approximately 95 percent of Kentuckians have access to drinking water from public water systems that are required to meet the strict standards of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). In Kentucky, the division has the administrative and regulatory authority to implement SDWA, through which the EPA sets maximum contaminant levels and goals (MCLs and MCLGs), Action Levels and minimum residuals for the ninety plus contaminants that may occur in finished drinking water and to ensure water is disinfected for disease causing organisms.\n\nCompliance Section\n\nEthan Givan, Administrative Supervisor, 502-782-6984 ethan.givan@ky.gov​\n\nIn Kentucky, the Division of Water has the administrative and regulatory authority to implement the SDWA, through which the Compliance Section Rule Managers review sample analysis results to ensure public water systems in Kentucky maintain compliance with Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. These Rule Managers administer rules for Disinfection Byproducts (DBP) such as Trihalomethanes and Haloacetic Acids, Lead and Copper, Synthetic and Volatile Organic Chemicals (SOC and VOC) SOCs predominantly come from pesticides, herbicides and plastics and many VOCs come from paints, coatings and fossil fuels. Inorganic Chemicals (IOC) such as arsenic, asbestos, cadmium and chromium (total) are also monitored. Bacteria such as total coliform and E coli. Rule Managers also ensure that treatment processes provide adequate protection from these contaminants.\n\nTechnical Assistance Section\n\nJoseph Uliaz, Administrative Supervisor, 502-782-6291 Joseph.Uliasz@ky.gov\n\nTechnical Assistance Providers provide one-on-one support to drinking water systems throughout the state and provide a large amount of training to the public in support of clean, safe drinking water for Kentuckians. They also provide scientific expertise to assist public water systems to return to and maintain compliance with Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. They also administer the Area Wide Optimization Program (AWOP) which is an EPA program that encourages public water systems to not only meet but to exceed federal drinking water requirements providing Kentuckians with the highest quality water possible.​\n\nLaboratory Certification Section\n\nKevin Stewart, Administrative Supervisor, 502-782-7081 Kevin.Stewart@ky.gov\n\nThe Laboratory Certification Section oversees the Kentucky Drinking Water and Wastewater Laboratory Certification Program ensures that compliance data for Kentucky Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (KPDES) permits is compliant with sampling and analysis requirements.

The Section also assists with the administration of the technical portions of the State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan program and Special Appropriate Grants, including review of contract documents, conducting on-site inspections, and review of pay request and change orders.\n\nMunicipal Planning Section\n\nVacant\n\nThe Municipal Planning Section of the Water Infrastructure Branch is responsible for review and approval of Regional Facility Plans and Asset Inventory Reports for regional wastewater utilities, as required by 401 KAR 5:006. The section also conducts the managerial and financial aspects of the Sanitary Survey, which is a key component of determining the capacity of a drinking water utility to deliver safe reliable water in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. The section compiles information and provides annual reports to USEPA with regard to public water system capacity. Finally, the section issues findings based on environmental reviews performed for publicly funded infrastructure projects in accordance with the USEPA approved State Environmental Review Process.\n\nInfrastructure Funding Section\n\nAmber Vaughn, Administrative Supervisor, 502-782-7121 Amber.vaughn@ky.gov\n\nThe Infrastructure Funding Section of the Water Infrastructure Branch is responsible for co-administering the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund loan programs through Memorandum of Agreement with the Kentucky Infrastructure Authority (KIA). The section processes the necessary paperwork for borrowers to comply with various terms and requirements of the loan program.
