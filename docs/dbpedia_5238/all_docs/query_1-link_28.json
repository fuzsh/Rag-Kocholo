        "text": "Military operations.\n\nIn July 1936, Hitler made the decision to lend support to the Nationalists. The Luftwaffe played a crucial role in transporting the Army of Africa to Spain. To facilitate this, the Spanish-German Spanish–Moroccan Transport Company (HISMA) and an entirely German company known as the “Raw Materials and Goods Purchasing Company” (ROWAK) were established. The German transports successfully moved nearly 2,500 troops from Spanish Morocco to Spain.\n\nThis early intervention significantly contributed to the Nationalists’ success in the initial stages of the war. The Germans provided valuable training to the Nationalists, proving to be as crucial, if not more so, than direct military actions. Between July 29 and October 11, the Germans transported 13,523 Moroccan troops and 270,100 kilograms of war material from Morocco to Andalusia. The forces led by Franco, supplied and transported by Germany, played a decisive role in the conflict. Although Germany signed the Non-Intervention Agreement on August 24, 1936, it consistently violated the terms.\n\nFollowing a Republican air attack on the German warship Deutschland, Germany and Italy initially declared their withdrawal from the Non-Intervention Committee and maritime patrols. Despite a brief return in early June 1937, they withdrew again after another attack. The German military presence in Spain, later reorganized and renamed the Condor Legion, claimed the destruction of 372 Republican planes and 60 Spanish Republican Navy ships. German aid to the Nationalists amounted to approximately £43,000,000 ($215,000,000) in 1939 prices.\n\nGerman air crews actively supported the Nationalist advance on Madrid and the relief of the Siege of the Alcázar. The Condor Legion’s aircraft, accompanied by two armored units, played a significant role. By the end of 1936, around 7,000 Germans were present in Spain. German units and equipment continued to support the Nationalists during the Battle of Madrid and the Battle of Jarama in February 1937. The conflict highlighted the limitations of the Legion’s aircraft compared to superior Soviet-made fighters.\n\nIn Operation Rügen, waves of planes bombed and strafed targets in Guernica, resulting in 1,685 deaths and over 900 injuries. The offensive on Bilbao, supported by ground units and extensive air operations, demonstrated the Legion’s value to the Nationalist cause. The Legion also participated in the Battle of Brunete, and both land and air forces were engaged in the Battle of Teruel. The Nationalists’ continued offensive on Aragon from April to June 1937, including the Battle of Belchite, involved bombing raids and the deployment of the Legion’s ground forces.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Ebro on July 24–25, Republican forces launched an attack. The Condor Legion’s reconnaissance units warned Nationalist forces, but their warnings were disregarded. The Legion’s aircraft, with 422 sorties, had a significant impact. The reinforcement of the Legion led to an important Nationalist counter-attack. At sea, the Maritime Reconnaissance Staffel of the Condor Legion targeted Republican shipping, ports, coastal communications, and occasionally inland targets. The German North Sea Group around Spain, part of the Kriegsmarine, included the pocket battleships Deutschland and Admiral Scheer, the light cruiser Köln, and four torpedo boats. Additionally, Operation Ursula involved a group of German U-boats around Spain but ultimately ended in failure.\n\nMotivation and volunteers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, Hitler provided various reasons for German involvement. These included using the conflict as a distraction from German remilitarization, preventing the spread of communism to Western Europe, establishing a friendly state in Spain to disrupt Britain and France, and exploring economic expansion opportunities. Despite abandoning the offensive on Madrid in March 1937, Germany continued supporting attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas. This strategy, while prolonging the Civil War, aimed to divert Western powers’ attention from Hitler’s ambitions in central Europe.\n\nThe offensive on Vizcaya, a crucial mining and industrial center, was backed by Germany to fuel its industrial needs. On June 27, 1937, in a speech at Würzburg, Hitler openly stated that he supported Franco to gain control of Spanish ore.\n\nDiscussions on German objectives for intervention took place in January 1937. Germany sought to avoid triggering a Europe-wide war, fearing that further commitment to Spain would escalate the conflict. German officials held contradictory views, with some, like Ernst von Weizsäcker, suggesting a graceful withdrawal, while Hermann Göring insisted that Germany would never recognize a “red Spain.” A joint Italian–German decision was reached, agreeing that the last shipments would be made by the start of February. German aid aimed to prevent a Nationalist defeat with minimal commitment.\n\nInvolvement in the Spanish Civil War brought Mussolini closer to Hitler, securing Mussolini’s agreement for Hitler’s plans for union (Anschluss) with Austria. The authoritarian Catholic, anti-Nazi Vaterländische Front government of autonomous Austria had successfully opposed the rise of Fascism. After the assassination of Austria’s authoritarian chancellor, Engelbert Dollfuss, in 1934, Italy had already pledged military assistance in case of a German invasion. Hitler’s need to prevent an Italian invasion was addressed through the Rome–Berlin Axis, established during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nApproximately 5,000 Germans and Austrians served with the International Brigades during the conflict, including political refugees among them.\n\nNon-Intervention Agreement.\n\nThe concept of non-intervention, along with the Non-Intervention Agreement, was initially proposed through a collaborative diplomatic effort by the governments of France and the United Kingdom. The primary aim was to prevent the Spanish Civil War from escalating into a widespread pan-European conflict. On August 4, 1936, the French presented the idea of non-intervention to Nazi Germany. Germany’s stance was that a formal declaration was unnecessary, but discussions could be conducted to prevent the war from spreading to the rest of Europe, provided the USSR participated. It was acknowledged during this meeting that Germany was already providing support to the Nationalists.\n\nHowever, on August 9, the Germans informed the British that “no war materials had been sent from Germany and none will,” which was a false statement. A German Ju 52 aircraft was captured in Republican territory, and its release was demanded before Germany would agree to sign the Non-Intervention Pact. Despite these false assurances, there was a growing skepticism that countries would adhere to the agreement. Admiral Erich Raeder urged the German government to either fully support the Nationalists, risking a European war, or abandon them altogether. On the 24th of August, Germany ultimately signed the agreement.\n\nAt this juncture, the Non-Intervention Committee was established to enforce the agreement, but the deceptive actions of both the USSR and Germany had already become evident. Germany consistently violated the terms of the agreement they had formally endorsed.\n\nThe Non-Intervention Committee was established to enforce the Non-Intervention Agreement, with Germany represented by Joachim von Ribbentrop (assisted by deputy Otto Christian Archibald von Bismarck). However, the day-to-day operations were overseen by the Italian Dino Grandi, although cooperation with him proved challenging for the Germans. It became increasingly evident that the Non-Intervention Agreement was not effectively preventing Germany from providing assistance to the Nationalists.\n\nOn November 18, the German government officially recognized the Nationalists as the legitimate government of Spain. Germany acceded to the request to prohibit volunteers on January 7, with Hitler personally authoring the German declaration. Despite this, German reservations about the scale, limitations, and outcomes of intervention in Spain persisted. German diplomats portrayed their personnel in Spain as genuine volunteers, maintaining the appearance of non-military involvement. Despite differing perspectives, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia shared the belief that a European war was not in their best interests.\n\nA control plan was implemented, with observers stationed at Spanish ports and borders. Ribbentrop and Grandi were instructed by their respective governments to agree to the plan, even though significant shipments had already taken place. The total cost of the scheme was estimated at £898,000, with Germany responsible for 16 percent of the expenses. The German delegation seemed hopeful that the control plan would prove effective.\n\nIn May, the Committee noted an attack on the German pocket battleship Deutschland. In response, Germany and Italy threatened to withdraw from the Committee and patrols unless assurances were given against further attacks. In early June, both nations returned to the committee and patrols. However, mentioning German operations remained a crime in Germany. After attacks (attributed to Republicans by Germany but denied) on the German cruiser Leipzig in mid-June, Germany and Italy once again withdrew from patrols but remained part of the Committee. Discussions about patrols remained complex, with Britain and France offering to replace Germany and Italy in patrols of their sections, but the latter powers were skeptical about the impartiality of these replacements.\n\nEarly intervention.\n\nFollowing the military coup that marked the onset of the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish Second Republic sought support from the Soviet Union and France, while the Nationalists sought assistance from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The initial attempt to secure German aviation support occurred on July 22, 1936, when Franco directly contacted Hitler, requesting 10 transport aircraft. The German government was divided on supporting the Nationalists, with concerns about potential involvement in a wider European conflict. Hitler eventually decided to support the Nationalists on July 25 or 26, albeit with caution about triggering a Europe-wide war.\n\nThe Reich Air Travel Ministry determined that the Nationalist forces would require at least 20 Ju 52s, operated by Deutsche Luft Hansa pilots, for Operation Magic Fire. Covertly, the joint Spanish-German Sociedad Hispano-Marroquí de Transportes (HISMA) and the entirely German Raw Materials and Good Purchasing Company (ROWAK) were established and funded with three million Reichsmark.\n\nThe recruitment of German volunteers and the organization of their involvement were kept secret. The first contingent of 86 men left on August 1 in civilian attire, unaware of their destination. Placed at Tablada airfield near Seville, they, along with German air transport, initiated the airlift of Franco’s troops to Spain. Germany’s involvement expanded in September to include the Wehrmacht’s other branches, and Operation Magic Fire was renamed Operation Guido in November.\n\nBelieving that the German soldiers would train Spanish Nationalists rather than engage Republicans, a wide belief persisted. Military aid, including 155 tons of bombs, was transferred from Germany to Spain in August. The Kriegsmarine initially hesitated to provide submarines, but this changed after the signing of the Rome–Berlin Axis on October 24. German U-boats were dispatched to Spanish waters under the codename Ursula.\n\nIn the two weeks following July 27, German transports moved nearly 2,500 troops from the Army of Africa to Spain. Fuel shortages were initially experienced but alleviated as more fuel arrived from Germany. By October 11, the official end of the mission, 13,500 troops and significant military equipment had been transported from Morocco to Spain.\n\nGerman air crews supported the Nationalist advance on Madrid and the relief of the Siege of the Alcázar, but this phase of the siege ultimately proved unsuccessful. Soviet air support for the Republicans increased, prompting Warlimont to appeal to Nazi Germany for heightened support. The existing command structure was replaced with Winterübung Rügen, and the military units formed into the Condor Legion.\n\nGöring supplied arms to both Republicans and Nationalists, with Nationalists receiving superior weaponry. The supply peaked in 1937–38. Nazi Germany also contributed to the propaganda war by providing a Telefunken transmitter for the newly established national radio service. The intricate dynamics of German involvement in the Spanish Civil War continued to evolve, marked by covert operations, shifting strategies, and contributions to both sides of the conflict.\n\nCondor Legion.\n\nUpon its establishment, the Condor Legion comprised the Kampfgruppe 88, featuring three squadrons of Ju 52 bombers, and the Jagdgruppe 88, consisting of three squadrons of Heinkel He 51 fighters. Additional components included the reconnaissance Aufklärungsgruppe 88, supplemented by the Aufklärungsgruppe See 88, an anti-aircraft group known as the Flak Abteilung 88, and a signals group, the Nachrichtenabteilung 88. Overall command was entrusted to Hugo Sperrle, with Alexander Holle serving as chief of staff. The Nationalists were further supported by two armored units under the command of Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma, equipped with 106 Panzer I tanks.\n\nDespite German and Italian support during the Battle of Madrid, the military situation for the Nationalists remained challenging. German and Italian aircraft, under Franco’s direction, initiated bombing raids on the city. The Germans were particularly interested in assessing the effects of civilian bombings and the intentional burning of the city. These offensives and bombings, however, were largely unsuccessful, and Republican air superiority, notably with the Soviet Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 aircraft, became increasingly apparent.\n\nIn November–December, General Wilhelm von Faupel advocated for the creation of a single German unit comprising 15,000–30,000 troops, believing it could significantly impact the course of the war in favor of the Nationalists. However, others, such as Hans-Heinrich Dieckhoff, argued that this force would be insufficient, potentially provoking opposition from the Spanish. As new aircraft were sent to the Condor Legion between late 1936 and early 1937, older aircraft were passed on to the Nationalists. By the end of 1936, approximately 7,000 Germans were present in Spain.\n\nGerman forces also participated in the Battle of Jarama, which began with a Nationalist offensive on February 6, 1937. The battle involved German-supplied ground forces, including machine gun batteries, a tank division, and the Condor Legion’s anti-aircraft guns. Bombing by both Republican and Nationalist aircraft contributed to a stalemate, highlighting the limitations of the Legion’s aircraft against superior Soviet-made fighters. Despite the Legion’s efforts, the Battle of Guadalajara in March resulted in a significant defeat for the Nationalists.\n\nIn January 1937, a joint Italian–German general staff was established to advise Franco on war planning. The defeat of a significant Italian force and the increasing Soviet superiority in tanks and aircraft prompted the Germans to support a plan to abandon the offensive on Madrid and focus on a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas. The perceived inadequacy of Italian forces influenced German strategic considerations during this period.\n\nThe Vizcaya Campaign.\n\nThe targeted region of Vizcaya, a predominantly Basque area in northern Spain, became the focal point of the conflict known as the War in the North. Primarily a Nationalist and Italian offensive, it received consistent support from the Condor Legion, which was undergoing continuous re-equipment. While Sperrle remained stationed in Salamanca, Wolfram von Richthofen took over as deputy and assumed actual command in January.\n\nThe Condor Legion’s air force initiated attacks on the towns of Ochandiano and Durango. Durango, lacking anti-aircraft defense and substantial other fortifications, suffered significant civilian casualties on March 31, with around 250 Basques reported dead, including members of a church ceremony such as the priest, nuns, and congregation. The Germans, due to their air raids, earned considerable animosity from the local population. Basque ground forces, in retreat toward Bilbao, passed through the town of Guernica, which witnessed a controversial event on April 26.\n\nIn Operation Rügen, waves of planes from the Condor Legion bombed and strafed targets in Guernica. The exact number of casualties remains disputed, with estimates ranging between 200 and 300 deaths. However, the Basques reported 1,654 dead and 889 wounded. Various explanations were presented by the Nationalists, including blaming the attack on the Republicans and suggesting it was part of a prolonged offensive. However, the nature of the operation makes the latter explanation seem unlikely.\n\nThe offensive on Bilbao, which commenced on July 11, received support from ground units of the Condor Legion, coupled with extensive air operations. This offensive underscored the value of the Condor Legion to the Nationalist cause, highlighting its effectiveness in coordinating ground and air efforts.\n\nFurther campaigns.\n\nThe Condor Legion played a significant role in various battles during the Spanish Civil War. In the Battle of Brunete, the Legion reinforced the Nationalist line, conducting raids on Spanish Republican Army armored vehicles and defensive positions using both bombers and fighters based in Salamanca. The Legion faced minimal opposition from the Spanish Republican Air Force, proving the superiority of German aircraft. The Legion improved its tactics during Brunete, with German aircraft claiming 18 victories despite losing eight aircraft.\n\nFollowing the focus on northern Spain, particularly the Battle of Santander and the Battle of Asturias, Germany began shipping the region’s industrial products back to Germany. Disagreements arose between Sperrle and Faupel, resulting in Faupel’s replacement with Eberhard von Stohrer. Sperrle returned to Germany, being replaced by Helmuth Volkmann. Hermann Plocher succeeded Von Richthofen in early 1938 after disagreements with Volkmann.\n\nThe Condor Legion engaged in strikes against Republican airfields before the Battle of Teruel, utilizing both land and air forces. Poor weather conditions limited flights, and Teruel fell to Republican forces in January 1938. The Legion actively participated in the Nationalist counter-offensive through the Alfambra valley, successfully retaking Teruel in February.\n\nThe Legion shifted its focus to the north, moved south again following Nationalist successes, and eventually faced challenges as casualties mounted, and Republican air activity increased. Hitler’s evolving attitude signaled a preference for a prolonged war over a quick victory in Germany. German policy aimed to prevent a Republican defeat, but discussions over the rising costs for Germany continued.\n\nThe Battle of the Ebro marked the last major offensive of the war, with the Legion providing reconnaissance that went unheeded by Nationalist forces. Despite tension in Czechoslovakia and a shortage of pilots in Germany, the Legion’s significant contributions led to its reinforcement after a short break, with new aircraft strengthening its capabilities. The Legion participated in operations against the remaining Republican air force with considerable success.\n\nThe Legion claimed to have destroyed numerous Republican aircraft through aerial combat and anti-aircraft fire while losing 72 aircraft in hostile action and 160 to accidents. After its dissolution, the men returned in May, and the equipment was absorbed by the new Spanish regime. The Condor Legion’s involvement was a crucial foreign intervention in the Spanish Civil War, contributing to Nationalist successes and shaping the outcome of key battles.\n\nMaritime operations.\n\nKriegsmarine.\n\nPublicly, the Kriegsmarine was ostensibly part of the force responsible for enforcing the non-intervention agreement signed on September 28, 1936. This agreement prohibited signatory countries from interfering in the Spanish Civil War. Despite this commitment, the German pocket battleships Deutschland and Admiral Scheer were stationed in the Strait of Gibraltar, preventing interference from Republican ships while Franco transported his troops to the Spanish mainland. As of mid-October, the German North Sea Group around Spain included the pocket battleships Deutschland and Admiral Scheer, the light cruiser Köln, and four torpedo boats.\n\nThe German naval forces discovered evidence of Soviet Union support for the Republicans and played a role in facilitating the transport of aircraft bound for the Condor Legion across the Mediterranean. They also provided assistance in the Battle of Málaga.\n\nIn an incident on May 29, the Deutschland was attacked by two Republican planes. It was claimed that the Soviet pilots had mistaken it for the Nationalist ship Canarias or had been fired upon by it. This attack resulted in the Kriegsmarine’s most significant loss of life in the war, with 32 sailors killed. Following a retaliatory attack on Almeria (Valencia was the original target, but minefields posed challenges), Germany came close to withdrawing from the non-intervention agreement. However, British diplomatic efforts successfully persuaded Germany to continue patrolling.\n\nWhen the Germans asserted that Leipzig had been attacked by an unidentified submarine off Oran, they formally withdrew from international patrols aimed at enforcing the non-intervention agreement. The Republican Minister of Defense, Indalecio Prieto, contemplated a declaration of war on Germany, but Soviet concerns about triggering a world war prevented such a move.\n\nOperation Ursula.\n\nOperation Ursula, named after Karl Dönitz’s daughter, involved a group of German U-boats operating in the waters near Spain against the Spanish Republican Navy. The operation was under the overall command of Hermann Boehm, who held the rank of Konteradmiral since 1934 and Vizeadmiral since April 1, 1937, in Berlin. Starting on November 20, 1936, with the movement of U-33 and U-34 from Wilhelmshaven, the operation aimed to disrupt Republican naval activities.\n\nThe U-boats entered the Mediterranean on the night of November 27–28, taking over from Italian submarine patrols. To maintain secrecy, any identification marks were obscured, and the entire mission was conducted covertly. If damaged, the U-boats were instructed to sail to La Maddalena and enter under an Italian ensign. U-33 operated around Alicante, while U-34 patrolled around Cartagena. However, operational difficulties, challenges in identifying legitimate targets, and concerns about discovery limited their effectiveness.\n\nThe torpedoes used in the operation often malfunctioned. During their return to Wilhelmshaven in December, U-34 sank the Spanish Republican submarine C-3 with a torpedo. While the Republican government initially believed C-3 had been sunk by a submarine, an official navy investigation later concluded that its loss resulted from an internal explosion. The return of the U-boats marked the official end of Operation Ursula."
