        "text": "Citation preview\n\nWelcome to ¡Espana! for Chain of Command, a free supplement which serves as a guide to and lists for the Spanish Civil War. The lists herein were compiled by Jim Hale and Rolf Grein and posted individually on Lard Island News in conjunction with an extensive piece in the 2013 Christmas Special. Over the intervening months they have continued to work on the rule amendments in order to fine‐tune the system to reflect the Spanish Civil War. We are now at a point where combining all of the lists into one document seems the right thing to do in order to provide the gamer with easy access to the period. This document is the net result. Here we have all of the lists for the conflict which tore Spain apart between the years of 1936 and 1939 and still leaves its legacy with Spain today. The rules and army lists remain close to the original principles within Chain of Command, relying on reflecting the way in which the troops were organised and trained to fight. This provides us with some very different forces and really gives us an insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the forces present. As a result,\n\n¡Espana! for Chain of Command results in a game which is fun and challenging in equal measures. As previously, my thanks must go to Jim and Rolf for their tireless efforts in a quest to find the right data through tough research. Their hard work means that the rest of us can get on with having fun with the rules they have provided. So, whether you’re facing the sun and shouting ¡Arriba Espana! or manning the barricades with a cry of ¡No Parsaran!, you can do so with ¡Espana! for Chain of Command.

Two Legionarios with rifles.\n\nSpanish Foreign Legion\n\nThere are two Mortar Squads attached to the HQ\n\nFOREIGN LEGION INFANTRY NATIONALIST ) The units of ‘La Legión’, like the remainder of the Army, followed the established Spanish organisational pattern. Unlike the rest of the army however, each battalion was already one company smaller and as they were permanently on active service, they were not reduced to the cost-cutting ‘peacetime’ organisational pattern.\n\nMORTAR SQUADS ONE & TWO MORTAR SQUAD 50mm Mortar with 3 crew and an Observer-Scout with 2 Legionarios, all armed with rifles. There are two Sections per Platoon, each SECTION HEADQUARTERS Sargento, Junior Leader armed with rifle or SMG There are three Squads per Section, each\n\nThe four companies of each battalion (Bandera) were divided into three Rifle Grenadier Companies (Compañias de Fusileros Granaderos), each of three platoons and a Machinegun Company (Compañía de Ametralladoras) of two platoons. A small Weapons Platoon (a single infantry gun and a two-weapon mortar section) completed the battalion.\n\nRIFLE SQUADS ONE TO THREE LMG SQUAD RIFLE SQUAD RIFLE SQUAD LMG with 2 crew & 6 Legionarios 6 Legionarios 3 Legionarios Legionarios are armed with bolt-action rifles. Legionarios in Rifle Squads have Grenades.\n\nFOREIGN LEGION RIFLE PLATOON The platoon (sección) was organized into a Headquarters Section (Plana Mayor) and two Rifle Grenadier Sections (Pelotones).\n\nSquads equate to ‘Teams’ for rule purposes.\n\nThe HQ Section consisted of the Platoon Commmander, usually a First or Second Lieutenant (Teniente or Alferez), a Platoon 1st Sergeant (Sargento Primero) and two Legionnaires (Legionarios), who may have been a bugler and a platoon clerk/runner. There were also two mortar squads, each serving a single 50mm mortar and each consisting of a Corporal (Cabo), an Observer-Scout (Observador-Explorador) and four men. It was intended that the 1st Sergeant was to command the two mortar squads in action.\n\nFOREIGN LEGION CHARACTERISTICS Sargento (Rifle Platoon): The section sergeant usually directed the fire of the section LMG. When a Leader is attached to a machine gun team and uses two or more Command Initiatives to direct their fire, he may add D3 to the Team’s Firepower dice. ¡Viva la Muerte!: Legion Leaders reduce shock by double the usual amount (i.e. 2 points per initiative spent) - See Section 4.5.3.\n\nThe two Rifle-Grenadier Sections consisted of a Sergeant (Sargento), a Light Machine Gun Squad (Escuadra de Fusil-ametralladora) of a Corporal and four men serving a single light machine gun and two Rifle Grenadier Squads (Escuadras de Fusileros Granaderos), each of a Corporal and five men. With the exception of the officer, who carried a pistol, all men carried rifles, although some Sergeants acquired an SMG.\n\nNovios de la Muerte: The 'Grooms of Death' are rated as Aggressive. They are never 'Broken' (14.6), but instead 'Retire' 6\"+2D6\" and become 'pinned' or they may halt and become 'pinned' on reaching any cover along that route. They are rallied as normal, but with their Leaders able to make use of the ¡Viva la Muerte! rule above.\n\nPage 4\n\nFOREIGN LEGION MACHINE GUN PLATOON Machine Gun Platoons provided the bulk of the support firepower of a Battalion. The company was fielded as either a fire support company in the attack, or in a position where it could cover the remaining three companies of the battalion when in a defensive posture. If things were going badly however, it could find itself in the frontline.\n\nThe Legionarios in the Rifle Squad are armed with Lafitte hand grenades and all Legionarios are armed with rifles.\n\nFOREIGN LEGION SUPPORT LIST LIST ONE Medical Orderly Adjutant Roadblock Civilian Car, no crew Entrenchments for one Team Engineering Team, 3 men Molotov Cocktail AP Ammunition for Pz I or CV 33/35 LIST TWO Flamethrower Team, 2 men Heavy Cover barricade One Squad of Moroccan Infantry acting as Scouts.

The remaining rifle squad in each section was typically engaged in assisting with the transfer of ammunition and tending to the mules which carried the weapons and their ammunition, but are included here as a tactical unit. PLATOON FORCE RATING Regular or Elite: +12 Command Dice: 6 if Regular, 5 if Elite PLATOON HEADQUARTERS Teniente with pistol and Sargento Primero with rifle, both are Senior Leaders.

All tanks and armoured cars come with a Junior Leader. Vehicles do not have radios. Transport only vehicles, such as a car are simply vehicles, which come with no crew. Remember, you will need to allocate men to drive these.\n\nEach battalion mortar section only had two medium mortars in total. The bombardment area for a twotube mortar section is 10”x10” with the aiming point at the centre. Refer to the Specific Rules for Off Table Forward Observation Teams when firing.\n\nWhere Sections are available they will always come with a Junior Leader. Infantry Teams rarely come with a Leader, whereas heavier support weapons do. The lists show all Junior Leader assignments where they are present for all troops barring vehicles as discussed above. The following support options need some notes.\n\nRefer to the Specific Rules for Off Table Machine Gun Fire Support.\n\nOFF-TABLE MACHINE G UN FIRE SUPPORT\n\n75/28 FIELD GUN BATTERY Refer to the Specific Rules for a 75/28 Artillery Battery.\n\nMOROCCAN INFANTRY SCOUTS\n\nPLATOON OBSERVER-SCOUTS\n\nThe Legion had a tradition of operating closely with the Moroccan troops it was usually brigaded with. If this is selected as a support option, the player can field two 3-man Scout Teams, each attached to a Legion Section or specifically to a Squad as desired.\n\nThe Observer-Scouts operated as both platoon scouts and as observers for the Mortar Squads of the platoon. Observer-Scouts when deployed on table may always end a move in a Tactical stance. As long as they have line of sight to any figure in a Mortar Squad they may spot for it (or both of them if they are deployed as a whole section). As communication involves signaling, when spotting in this way they lose their Tactical stance.\n\nThese troops are taken from the Moroccan List to represent a detachment operating as guides for their mission. The unit is subject to the Moroccan special rules on that list.\n\nMOROCCAN CAVALRY SCOUTS\n\nIf within the command distance of any Senior or Junior Leader of their platoon, they may be used to activate the Mortar Squads/Section (if they have LOS) as if those squads themselves were in that Leader’s command distance, for the appropriate action points (one to activate the scouts and one to activate the Mortar Squads). This allows the Platoon’s Leaders to spot for the mortars when firing indirectly.\n\nThe Moroccan Tabors had their own Cavalry units. If selected as a support option the player can field a single Squad of Moroccan Cavalry organised the same way as Peninsular Army Cavalry – refer to that army list for details. This selection assumes the cavalry is mounted. This unit uses all the Moroccan Special Rules and Cavalry Specific Rules.\n\nMOLOTOV COCKTAIL Refer to the Specific Rules for Molotov Cocktails.\n\nIf on-table support weapons are ever deployed outside the constraints of this army list (possibly in a scenario game) they should have their own ObserverScouts, who can be used the same way by the Platoon’s Senior Leaders in respect to the weapon team they belong to and are activated in the same way as above.\n\nRANDOM AIR SUPPORT Refer to the Specific Rules for Random Air Support.\n\nSUPERIOR GUNSIGHTS The German 88mm Flak 18 was the preeminent artillery piece of the Spanish Civil War. Equipped with excellent optics, it gains a +1 when firing.\n\n50MM MORTAR SQUAD Each squad consisted of a single Valero 50mm mortar. The squad includes a weapons gunner and two loaders and is accompanied by an Observer-Scout Team of an Observer and two Legionarios. All were armed with rifles. Use the Platoon Observer-Scouts rules when firing. The 50mm mortar only fires H.E. Rounds. It has a minimum range of 18”, but closer than that the crew may use their carbines.\n\nPage 6\n\nAP AMMUNITION The Pz I or CV 33/35 may be equipped with Armour Piercing ammunition. If taken the round has an AP of 1 and ammunition lasts only in the turn it is fired.\n\nOut of the entirety of the Spanish Army, the Tercio de Marruecos (Regiment of Morocco), more famously to become La Legión (The Legion), was the best trained, best-equipped and most-motivated of all at the beginning of the Civil War. The force was composed wholly of volunteers prior to the Civil War, although as casualties mounted, it was necessary to replace losses with the same conscripts who filled out the rest of the Nationalist forces. While this led to a degree of decline in the quality of Legion units, in comparison with that at the beginning of the conflict, it was to remain the effective elite ‘spear head’ force of the Nationalist Army throughout the conflict.\n\nis that of the early Waffen SS and its unswerving belief in its own and its cause’s superiority. That belief was of course dangerous. Despite there being a Spanish tactical doctrine that included the same concepts as any military manual elsewhere in the world at that time, the Legion favoured frontal assaults. The attack on the town of Badajoz is perhaps the epitome of the futility of the Legion’s doctrine (albeit that it is hard not to frontally assault a walled town). Over several hours, successive waves of Legionarios attempted to storm the gate of La Puerta de la Trinidad, which was held by Loyalist Carabineros, reinforced with machine guns. Losses amongst the IV Bandera were colossal; the 16th Company alone was reduced to just one Captain, one Corporal and twelve men, from the ninety or so that had begun the assault. While the assault was ultimately successful, other troops had already entered the city at different points and with somewhat more subtlety. There was of course a price for the defenders to pay for such losses and the Legion spared no one as it advanced into the centre of the town.\n\nIn comparison to the rest of the Army, the Legion was the only formation which had its full complement of personnel and its full allocation of weapons. When these needed to be replaced, substitutions had been made from Peninsular stocks, which further reduced the weapons held by those units. As German and Italian weapons began to arrive in Spain, the Legion got its pick of them and its older equipment was passed down to other units. By the end of the Civil War, the Legion was almost entirely equipped with German and Italian machine guns, anti-tank guns and other weapons. While the Legion’s Reputation has experienced some exaggeration, much like that of the Moroccan units they usually fought alongside, there is an element of truth to support that reputation. The root of that reputation lies within the culture perpetuated within the Legion, which began the second its recruits passed through the gates of its barracks. The formation’s commander, José Millán-Astray y Terreros, had developed what was virtually a religious cult within his command, which he had also imbued into his former subordinate Francisco Franco. Building on both Spanish Catholic and Spanish Imperial traditions, Millan-Astray developed the idea within the Legion that they were the Bridegrooms of Death (Novios de la muerte) and that self-sacrifice for the glory of Spain, was the ideal that his men should be striving for.\n\nThis list can be used to create a platoon of the Legion, complete with the supporting elements it established, largely thanks to German and Italian support and training. The Legion was seen as the premier formation by the Nationalists and is perhaps the ideal that other units sought to emulate. With the exception of some elements of the Moroccan units it so closely worked with, the force is almost entirely composed of Legion units. While Legion units can be found in other lists as support, the Legion list itself gives a quite strong platoon in relation to others of the period, being very much a case of quality and not quantity.\n\nMillan-Astray, himself having lost an eye and an arm in service was vehemently anti-socialist, by the terms of the day an ardent fascist and possibly insane. How much of his philosophy was taken onboard by his men is open to question, but given the casualties taken during the early months of the civil war in particular, as well as their constant use as shock troops throughout the War, it can be imagined that it was certainly very influential. Although derived from a different perspective, the nearest comparable analogy\n\nPage 7\n\nThe gun-mortar platoon had a two-mortar section with 60mm weapons and a single infantry gun, almost invariably the Schneider 70/16 mountain gun. Naturally heavier artillery support was available and from quite early in the Civil War, Italian or German tanks. PLATOON FORCE RATING Regular: +8 Command Dice: 6\n\nMoroccan Regulares\n\nPLATOON HEADQUARTERS Teniente with pistol and Sargento Primero with rifle, both are Senior Leaders. Two Soldados with rifles.\n\nMOROCCAN REGULARES INFANTRY, JUL-OCT 1936 (NATIONALIST ) The Moroccan Infantry platoon (Sección) structure was identical to all of the other types of infantry platoons within the Spanish Army. It consisted of a Headquarters Section (Plana Mayor) and Two Sections (Pelotones), each of three Squads (Escuadras).\n\nThere are two Sections per Platoon, each SECTION HEADQUARTERS Sargento, Junior Leader armed with rifle or SMG There are three Squads per Section, each\n\nThe HQ Section consisted of the Platoon Commmander, who was usually a first or second Lieutenant (Teniente or Alferez), a Platoon 1st Sergeant (Sargento Primero) and two additional men, probably a bugler and a platoon clerk/runner respectively, rounded out the headquarters section.\n\nRIFLE SQUADS ONE TO THREE LMG SQUAD RIFLE SQUAD RIFLE SQUAD M22 LMG with 6 Soldados 6 Soldados 2 crew & 3 Soldados Outside of the LMG Squads, all Soldados have Lafitte hand grenades and are armed with rifles. The M22 LMG counts as a magazine fed weapon. Squads equate to ‘Teams’ for rule purposes.\n\nLike the Legion and Peninsular units, the Regulares were supposed to have two mortar squads within the HQ, but to what extent this had been achieved is not certain. It is entirely possible that some of the units raised still had the V-B type grenade launchers that the mortars were intended to replace. The two ‘Rifle-Grenadier’ Sections consisted of 18 men including the Sergeant (Sargento) who lead them. The Section was divided into three Squads (Escuadra), each of a Squad Leader and five men. The Sergeant led the first ‘Rifle-Machine Gun’ Squad and two Corporals (Cabo) led the two ‘Rifle-Grenadier’ Squads. With the exception of the Platoon Leader, who carried a pistol and the two machine gunners, all men were armed with older variants of Mauser rifle in service. The men in the two Rifle-Grenadier squads would also be issued grenades. Support for the platoon would come in the first instance from the battalion’s machine gun company and the gun-mortar platoon. While the machine gun company was not broken up into penny-packets and fielded as a battalion reserve, it could lay down a barrage of machine gun fire to support the operations of the rifle companies, providing it was situated in a position to do so.\n\nPage 8\n\nMOROCCAN MACHINE GUN PLATOON The Machine Gun Company composed the heavy weapon component of a Moroccan Battalion. Treated as a line unit, it was not broken down and attached to the rifle companies, but deployed where it could bring fire to bear to support the actions of the other companies. In defence it could often find itself as the frontline if things were going badly. Its organisation was very similar to that of the Infantry Platoon, except that there were no mortar squads in the platoon headquarters and in the machine gun sections, there were two machine gun squads and one rifle-grenadier squad. Despite being a member of the rifle squad, the Section Leader typically directed the fire of the machine gun squads. While the platoon packs a lot of firepower, it is far less mobile than a rifle platoon. It is included in the list for the sake of completeness, but can prove to be a real obstacle to the opponent of a player who is able to take up a defensive stance in a scenario.\n\nPLATOON FORCE RATING Regular: +10 Command Dice: 6\n\nARMY SUPPORT LIST NOTES Most of the support options on the list will be selfexplanatory. All tanks and armoured cars come with a Junior Leader. Vehicles do not have radios. MMGs are tripod mounted. Transport only vehicles, such as a car do not come with crew, so you will need to allocate men to drive these.\n\nPLATOON HEADQUARTERS Teniente with pistol and Sargento Primero with rifle, both are Senior Leaders. Two Soldados with rifles. There are two Sections per Platoon, each SECTION HEADQUARTERS Sargento, Junior Leader armed with Rifle or SMG There are three Squads per Section, each RIFLE SQUADS ONE TO THREE MMG SQUAD MMG SQUAD RIFLE SQUAD M14 MMG 6 crew M14 MMG 6 crew 5 soldados The Soldados in the Rifle Squad are armed with Lafitte hand grenades and all Soldados are armed with rifles. Squads equate to ‘Teams’ in this organization\n\nMOROCCAN CHARACTERISTICS Sargento (Rifle Platoon): The section sergeant usually directed the fire of its LMG. When a Leader is attached to a machine gun team and uses two or more Command Initiatives to direct their fire, he may add D3 to the Team’s Firepower dice.\n\nWhere Sections are available they will always come with a Junior Leader. Infantry Teams rarely come with a Leader, whereas heavier support weapons do. The lists show all Junior Leader assignments where they are present for all troops barring vehicles as discussed above. The following support options notes apply.\n\nV-B LAUNCHER Prior to the introduction of the Valero 50mm Mortar, the Spanish made use of a rifle grenade adaptor. While originally these were most likely issued to the (Fusileros-Granaderos) Rifle-Grenadier Squads (probably one per squad), there is no reason to suppose that this continued to be the case when the army re-organised. It is possible that these weapons were given to the two ‘Mortar Squads’ in the Platoon HQ until such time as the light mortar was issued to the unit, giving each of those squads one launcher. Therefore, a player may select and issue two VB launchers within his platoon as desired, excluding the LMG squads. Alternatively, two additional six-man Rifle-Grenadier Squads may be selected as an alternative to the ‘Mortar Squads’ and these may each be provided with one launcher instead, representing the formation of the mortar squads, but there being no actual mortars to equip them with.\n\nMoroccans: These fierce North African troops were very adept at the use of any cover where seemingly none existed. Moroccans can move with 1D6 or 2D6 and assume a Tactical stance at the end of their movement. They are treated as Aggressive. Under the eyes of the Caíd: The officers, senior non-commissioned officers and various other ‘sensitive’ posts in Moroccan units were occupied by Europeans. Each company had a single indigenous supernumerary officer however, called the Caíd.\n\nThe VB Launcher has a minimum range of 18” and a maximum of 60”. It may target any unit which can be seen by friendly troops but it counts any target which it can see as being in close range, and any it cannot see as being at effective range. In the first phase of fire at a target (even one it has fired at previously) it will roll half of the normal firepower dice.\n\nIf selected as a support choice, the Caíd may be activated on a Command Dice roll of 5. If the player activates the Caíd, he does not increase his Chain of Command tally by one. When activated a Caíd moves as normal. If attached to a squad he may move with that squad without being activated himself.\n\nTANK HUNTERS Moroccan troops developed a capability to take on enemy tanks with some skill. A maximum of two Teams may be formed per platoon, each from one of the platoon’s Sections, each Team counting as one support list choice.\n\nHe counts as two men for morale purposes when considering Shock levels and one man in any Close Combat. A Caíd does not fire or crew weapons, nor activate squads or teams. If the Senior Leader is killed, the presence of the Caíd reduces the effect of his loss to that of a Junior Leader. The loss of the Caíd counts as that of a Senior Leader.\n\nFor each choice taken a Senior or Junior Leader may create a new Tank Hunter Team following the rules as per (4.5.7). A Team is created from three men taken from one Section in a player’s force. Tank Hunters can make one ‘Grenade and Petrol Can” attack per game as described on Table Seven (9.3.4).\n\nPage 9\n\nPLATOON OBSERVER-SCOUTS MOROCCAN SUPPORT LIST LIST ONE Medical Orderly Adjutant Roadblock Civilian Car, no crew Entrenchments for one Team Engineering Team, 3 men Tank Hunters Equip two Fusileros in Platoon with V-B type launcher* AP Ammunition for Pz I or CV 33/35 LIST TWO Heavy Cover barricade Caíd** Pre-Game Barrage (artillery or machine gun fire) Truck to transport entire Section or tow a weapon Bilbao armoured car** LIST THREE 50mm Mortar Squad added to Platoon HQ; or Rifle-Grenadier Squad added to Platoon HQ* Sniper Team, 2 men 60mm Mortar Section with observer 70/16 Infantry Gun with 5 Crew and a Junior Leader** Pak 35/36 Anti-tank gun, 5 crew and Junior Leader** Off-table Machine Gun Fire Support CV 33/35 or Panzer Mk I** Random Air Support LIST FOUR Squad of mounted Moroccan Cavalry Scouts 75/28 Field Gun, 5 crew and Junior Leader 2cm Flak 30 AA gun, 5 crew with Junior Leader ** LIST FIVE Attached Foreign Legion Section (Legion List) LIST SIX 75/28 Field Gun Battery with observer\n\nThe Observer-Scouts operated as both scouts and as observers for the Mortar Squads of the platoon. Observer-Scouts when deployed on table may always end a move in a tactical stance. As long as they have line of sight to any figure in a Mortar Squad they may spot for it (or both of them if they are deployed as a whole section). As communication involves signaling, when spotting in this way they lose their tactical stance. If within the command distance of any Senior or Junior Leader of their platoon, they may be used to activate the Mortar Squads/Section (if they have LOS) as if those squads themselves were in that Leader’s command distance, for the appropriate action points (one to activate the scouts and one to activate the Mortar Squads). This allows the Platoon’s Leaders to spot for the mortars when firing indirectly. On-table support weapons that have their own Observer-Scouts, can also be used the same way by the Platoon’s Senior Leaders in respect to the weapon team they belong to and are activated in the same way as above.\n\n50MM MORTAR SQUAD Each squad consisted of a single Valero 50mm mortar. The squad includes a weapons gunner and two loaders and is accompanied by an Observer-Scout Team of an Observer and two Regulares. All were armed with rifles. Use the Platoon Observer-Scout rules when firing. The 50mm mortar only fires H.E. Rounds. It has a minimum range of 18”, but closer than that the crew may use their carbines.\n\n60MM MORTARS\n\n** May only select one of this type of support asset.\n\nEach battalion only had two medium mortars in total. The bombardment area for a two-tube mortar section is 10”x10” with the aiming point at the centre. Use the rules for Off Table Forward Observation Teams when firing.\n\nRANDOM AIR SUPPORT\n\nAP AMMUNITION\n\n* Units either have V-B type launchers or 50mm Mortars, not both types in the same unit. Only two mortars or VB launchers may be chosen per platoon.\n\n75/28 FIELD GUN BATTERY\n\nThe Pz I or CV 33/35 may be equipped with Armour Piercing ammunition.

If selected as a support option the player can field a single Squad of Moroccan Cavalry organised the same way as Peninsular Army Cavalry – refer to that army list for details. This selection assumes the cavalry is mounted. This unit uses all the Moroccan Special Rules and Cavalry Specific Rules.\n\nPage 10\n\nThe various Moroccan formations, or Tropas Indígenas (Indigenous Troops), as they were collectively referred to by the Spanish, formed the bulk of the manpower of the Army of Africa. Although Spain had fought a long and bloody series of wars with the tribes of the Rif, units drawn from the Moroccan Tribes had fought for Spain throughout these and in 1936, some of the units contained some of the tribes who had fought against the Spanish in these wars. As was the case with the colonial forces of other nations, the Indigenous units tended to have older equipment than what the European units had and firm control was kept by Europeans on weapons that might prove especially damaging if there was a revolt. Within the Moroccan units (except the Sultan’s own Meha’la units) Europeans held all of the command positions, from Platoon Leader upwards. Within the rifle companies roughly a third of the senior noncommissioned officers were European and within the platoons, the Corporals in charge of the machine gun and mortar squads were also European. In the machine gun companies, the whole of the machine gun squads were European, while the rifle squads within them were Moroccan. Within each company or cavalry squadron however, there was a single indigenous officer, the Caíd. The post of Caíd was essentially an honorary position, occupied by a member of what amounted to the Moroccan Tribal aristocracy. The presence of the usually younger members of these families, in units drawn from the tribes they ruled, legitimized the authority of the Spanish Army within them. As the approval or disapproval of the Caíd could not only have repercussions for an individual soldier, but could also make things very difficult, or indeed very good, for his family, the indigenous troops went to great lengths to get noticed in a positive sense by them. Moroccan troops had never served outside of the colonies prior to the Civil War, but thanks to rebel propaganda, which fostered the belief that the Government intended to suppress Islam and burn down their mosques, the rebels overcame the reluctance of their own indigenous troops to do so, but also gained units from the Sultan of Morocco’s own Gendarmerie, the Mehal’la.\n\nthemselves to serve in the new units raised during the Civil War too. Once the Moroccans were transported to Spain, their skills were in high demand. They were feared for their field craft, which allowed them to reputedly cross even open terrain almost unseen. The discovery of Republican sentries with their throats slit and often other mutilations, all added to their reputation. The rebel commanders also appear to have turned a blind eye to incidences of rape and looting by the Moroccans. It must be said that how much of this was true and how much was Republican propaganda, is open to question however. Nevertheless given incidents elsewhere, the fate of a Miliciana captured by the Moroccans was unlikely to have been pleasant to say the least. Despite their savagery, exaggerated or otherwise, the Moroccans were hard fighters and seemingly without fear. When the Nationalists began offering a 500 Peseta bounty for captured Republican tanks, it was the Moroccans who first began stalking them with crowbars and Molotov cocktails. While 500 Pesetas was not to be refused by Spaniards, for the Moroccans it was a small fortune that could be sent home to their families. The Moroccan troops fought with equal measure of bravery and savagery throughout the Civil War, largely in conjunction with the Foreign Legion units they were traditionally brigaded with in Morocco. While the Legion gained the best of what was available regarding equipment, the Moroccans continued to receive the same standard of equipment they always had. This list can be used to create either a wholly Moroccan force of Regulares, Tiradors or Mehal’la, or one which is benefiting from the support of the Legion units it is brigaded with. In certain theatres the Moroccans fought alongside ordinary Peninsular formations, as well as Requetés and Falangists. With that in mind the option exists to field Moroccan units in those lists. The Moroccan forces remained unchanged throughout the Civil War, so this list is suitable from July 1936 to the end of the Civil War in 1939.\n\nWhile this propaganda was blatantly untrue at the time, it has to be considered that both the Communists and Anarchists saw religious suppression as essential to the Revolution, so the belief that they would attempt to do what was claimed was not without a basis in fact. It was also to contribute to the continued numbers of Moroccans who offered\n\nPage 11\n\nBesides the basic option given here, supplemented by the support options in the table, there are a number of alternatives which the player could try out which mirror attempts to incorporate the Falange into the reduced Peninsular formations. The most obvious one is a Mixed Platoon (Sección Mixta), which would split a single Peninsular Infantry Platoon to form the cores of two platoons, bringing a reduced Infantry Company to its full strength by adding a Falange Section to each of them.\n\nFalangist Militia FALANGE MILITIA, JULY TO NOVEMBER 1936 (NATIONALIST ) Like some of the irregular formations at the start of the Spanish Civil War, the Falange’s militia adopted a pattern of organisation not too dissimilar to that of the regular Spanish Army, at least at its lowest level. The Section-level unit was called a ‘Falange’ and consisted of a command element of a Section Leader (Jefe de Falange), and three squads (Escuadra), each of a squad leader (Jefe de Escuadra) and five men (Falangistas), with the exception of the first, where the Section Leader led the Squad. All of the men in the Section were armed with rifles, usually one of the various types of Mauser, or civilian types, the more popular of which included a licensed copy of the Winchester ’73.\n\nSuch a platoon would then have a single Lanzagranada squad with its HQ and possibly one squad in one section with a light machine gun, the other being Falangists with rifles. Each platoon would be commanded by the Lieutenant and 1st Sergeant respectively, with a Falangist Jefe or Sub-Jefe as his second in command. The Platoon Force Rating would be the same, but the Platoon may also access the Army Support List. Only the actual army section and the single Lanzagranada squad may be upgraded with the LMG, V-B launcher and 50mm mortar options however. PLATOON FORCE RATING Green: -3 Command Dice: 5\n\nThese sections were grouped into companies (Centuria), nominally of ten sections, but which could contain as few as two, depending on how popular the Falange were in their locale. The Centuria was led by a ‘Jefe de Centuria’, assisted by a ‘Subjefe de Centuria’ and probably also had three Falangistas as company, standard bearer, bugler and runner. The Falange had no integral support weapons of their own at the beginning of the Civil War and relied on the Army to provide these and the men to serve them. In the early weeks of the War, it was more usual to find Falange groups added to other formations to reinforce them, than to see whole combat units formed entirely from Falangists. Those Falange groups which were incorporated directly into regular units soon adopted the same organisational structure of their parent unit, although almost invariable there were insufficient support weapons to provide neither machine guns nor mortars to these units initially.\n\nPage 12\n\nCENTURIA HEADQUARTERS Jefe de Centuria and Subjefe (Superior Junior Leaders) armed with pistols and/or SMG. 3 Falangistas armed with rifles.

However they could prove dogged in good defensive positions. Militia receives one extra shock for every two shock and/or kills received, unless a cover modifier was applied to the shots that caused the hits.\n\nARMY SUPPORT LIST NOTES Most of the support options on the list will be selfexplanatory. Transport only vehicles, such as a car are simply vehicles, with no crew. Remember, you will need to allocate men to drive these. Tiznaos vehicles come with a Junior Leader. Vehicles do not have radios. Typical light weapon types are shown throughout, though variation was commonplace. Where Sections are available they will always come with a Junior Leader. Infantry Teams rarely come with a Leader, whereas heavier support weapons do. The lists show all Junior Leader assignments where they are present for all troops barring vehicles as discussed above. The following support options need some notes.\n\n50MM MORTAR SQUAD Each squad consisted of a single Valero 50mm mortar. The squad includes a weapons gunner and two loaders. All were armed with rifles. A Senior or Junior Leader may both activate and/or spot for the Mortar Team, at a cost of one command initiative point, if the Mortar Team is within their command range. No other unit may spot for the Mortar Team, which of course, can spot for itself. The 50mm mortar only fires H.E. Rounds. It has a minimum range of 18”, but closer than that the crew may use their carbines.\n\n60MM & 81MM MORTARS Each battalion only had two medium mortars in total and of only one type. The bombardment area for a two-tube mortar section is 10”x10” with the aiming point at the centre. Use the rules for Off Table Forward Observation Teams when firing.\n\nOFF-TABLE MACHINE G UN FIRE SUPPORT Refer to the Specific Rules for Off Table Machine Gun Fire Support.\n\nPage 13\n\n70/16 FIELD GUN BATTERY\n\nINFANTRY SECTIONS\n\nRefer to the Specific Rules for a 70/16 Artillery Battery.\n\nThe other infantry options reflected here are either; attached Sections of Falange, Requetés, Army, Security Services, or African Army personnel, representing the ad hoc units often formed in the early part of the Civil War. Any of these units may select a single support option from their own support list, for each unit of their type fielded in a force, at the cost specified on their support list. The selected force has all the characteristics of the army list from which it is taken.\n\nLMG One weapon per selection may be issued to a Squad. In a Squad which is equipped with a light machine gun, the Cabo will become its gunner and a Fusilero will become its loader. Other Fusileros in the same Squad can replace crew casualties. In Rifle Platoons only one LMG may be issued per Squad and only one Squad in a Section may be so equipped.\n\nMOLOTOV COCKTAIL\n\n‘EL HOMBRE’\n\nRefer to the Specific Rules for Molotov Cocktails.\n\nThis support option allows a Squad to be upgraded with a temporary Junior Leader in a player’s phase – any unit may be chosen. Only one such squad may activate this way from phase to phase and the leader only influences the unit he is with. In subsequent phases the same or a different unit may be chosen with an ‘El Hombre’.\n\nCAVALRY SQUAD Mounted troops are treated as normal Falange infantry, but are mounted on horses when taken as a support list option. They may remain mounted during play or may deploy on-table dismounted. Refer to the Cavalry Specific Rules.\n\nBLUESHIRTS Many Falangistas joined soon after the War began, in the hope of avoiding frontline service. This resulted in shirkers, run of the mill members and the ‘die-hards’ mixed together with varying results. Therefore, when determining force morale roll two D3 dice, one plus, one minus. If a positive number, they may ignore the Falangista Militia characteristic and use the resultant roll as the force morale modifier (p11) for the game. If a negative number then this becomes the modifier for the force morale die roll and the Falangista Militia characteristic still applies.\n\nCARA AL SOL The ‘old guard’ of Falangista were very committed to the cause and in some cases were fanatical in their belief, though most not so much when it came to actually fighting for them. They may ignore the Falangista Militia characteristic and disregard the Force Morale -2 die roll modifier for being Green replacing it with +1 instead (p11).\n\nFLAG A unit with an attached Flag may ignore one point of shock received per phase of play. Flag bearers do not fire but do count as fighting in combat.\n\nCENTURIA LEADERS One or both Centuria leaders may be upgraded to Senior Leaders.\n\nPage 14\n\nSome months prior to the start of the Civil War, the Falange Española de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista, FE de las JONS (Spanish Phalanx of the Assemblies of the National Syndicalist Offensive), or more simply, the Falange, had begun creating an armed militia in preparation for the ‘counterrevolution’ it was planning to begin. While numbers were small, the mass exodus of members from a similar paramilitary force belonging to CEDA, following their defeat in the election, provided a boost in numbers. Sympathetic army officers devoted their free time to training Falangists in the use of weapons, while the Falange’s leadership endeavoured to buy arms from abroad, assisted by wealthy individuals like Juan March. Although every member did not have a weapon, most were at least trained in their use. Most of the leadership of the Falange were ‘out of the loop’ as regards the plans for the coup d’etat and until their leadership pledged support for the Nationalist Manifesto on the night of 18th July, were largely ignorant that it was even taking place. Plans to integrate Falangists into the military forces were nonexistent and in one case a local Falngist leader was asked to leave his phone number at the rebel headquarters, so he could be summoned if required. This was an isolated case however and in general, the local rebel commanders released weapons to local Falangists to assist the military and security services that had sided with the rebels. After the initial street-fighting and confusion of the first few days was over, attempts to integrate the Falangists began. Initially this largely consisted of forming composite units of security service personnel and local Falangists, and in the case of Andalucia, the first elements of the Army of Africa that arrived. These units were then sent into the hinterland of the Nationalist controlled towns and cities, to root out the ‘Rojos’ (Reds) within them and secure the area for the rebels. Columns of trucks with these forces would roll off into the countryside, occasionally meeting some form of organized resistance, but more usually rolled into small towns and villages, demanded that the Rojos be identified and then summarily executed them. As the rebel army became the Nationalist Army, the need for men led to conscription. Many took the opportunity to join the Falange, as it appeared clear that these would be used mainly in the rear areas to ‘pacify’ territory that the army gained. Much to the distress of many of these men, it was decided to use Falangists to flesh out army formations, which were still on their reduced peace-time organisation. While in some cases this was merely a case of adding\n\nindividual Centuria to army units, the process was completed by creating entire battalions of Falangists, organized and as much as was able, equipped, on the army model. At this point the Falange began to lose its identity and other than small concessions, as regards insignia and symbolism, became little different to an army unit of similar size. This process was to be completed when the Falange and the traditionalist militias, the Requetés, were merged to form the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva NacionalSindicalista (Spanish Traditionalist Phalanx of the Assemblies of National-Syndicalist Offensive) – the FET y de las JONS, in April 1937. This list can be used to represent a Falange platoonsized unit operating either as a complete formation, or as one supported by outside elements, in the early months of the Civil War. This list is good until around October-November 1936, after which point the Falange became more militarised and began to receive its own integral support weapons, along with a share of ordinary conscripts, becoming little different to any other Nationalist formation in the process. All of its support weapons are provided by the army formations of the area or formation it belongs to and are attached purely for the duration of a single operation. These formations are short of these same weapons themselves however, so their availability is limited. In some areas Falangists fought alongside Requetés as a distinct minority, in others the situation was reversed. The Falangists were very much a mixed bag. With the presence of both ‘true believers’, common or garden thugs, bully-boys and of course failed draft-dodgers, it was hard to tell how a unit would behave until it came under fire. While as with any unit, experience and training would make a difference over time, in the initial battles the Falangists were as unpredictable as the Popular Militia they faced. Like most of the Civil War militias, there were also mounted companies of Falangistas, who were used as scouts and mounted infantry, a role that they appeared to have performed adequately and which saw them supporting regular cavalry units on occasion too.\n\nPage 15\n\nPLATOON FORCE RATING Green or Regular: -1 (+1) Command Dice: 5 PLATOON HEADQUARTERS Jefe de Requetés and Primo Sargento (Superior Junior Leaders), armed with rifle or pistol and a group of four rifle armed Requetés.

There were three Sections (Grupos), each led by a Sergeant (Sargento de Requetés) and composed of three Squads (Patrullas), each composed of a Cabo and five Requetés.\n\nAll Requetés are rifle armed. Catholic Priests were an integral part of Requete forces and one can be added to the platoon as a support list option. Requetés may be taken as Green or Regular. Squads equate to Teams in this organization.\n\nWhile the officer carried a pistol, all other ranks carried a rifle, typically a Mauser, but several types were in use. The Requetés had no other weapons at this time and were to rely on what support could be provided by Nationalist Army units. Uniquely amongst the Requetés (and Republican Basques) was the presence of Priests in the firing line – this was not unusual. Deeply held religious beliefs provided their forces with a zealousness that would ultimately see them become the shock troops of the later formed Nationalist Army. These Priests are represented as a support list choice as they might not always be seen with the platoon portrayed by a player’s force. Similarly, Requetés often went into battle with a Religious Icon, often a holy banner carried by a respected senior non-commissioned officer. This to is allowable as a support level choice and may be combined with the presence of a Priest to reflect a particularly pious platoon with a fierce combat edge. In this list only the first two section of a platoon are represented as full strength platoons were not always fielded. To represent a complete platoon a player may take a Requetés Section as support list choice.\n\nCARLIST REQUETE CHARACTERISTICS Viva El Cristo Rey!: The Carlist battle cry “Viva El Cristo Rey!” (Long Live Christ the King!) inspired the Requete soldiers with a religious ferocity in attack. Therefore, they are always treated as Aggressive.

Units with an attached Priest are rated as Aggressive and always ignore the first point of shock received by enemy action. They have their shock reduced by double the usual amount (i.e. 2 points per initiative spent) if both a leader and Priest are attached - See Section 4.5.3. The instant the Priest is no longer attached apply all rules relating to shock to effected units. Priests are treated as officers when determining loss in play.\n\nRELIGIOUS ICON\n\n*These are army assets provided as support, only one of these options may be selected due to the initial low level of support available. **This is an army asset provided as support, a maximum of two of these may be selected, but counts as a single support option in respect of the note above. ***Only allowed to Andalucían Requetés.\n\n50MM MORTAR SQUAD Each squad consisted of a single Valero 50mm mortar.

The banner bearer may not fire a weapon but does count as fighting in combat. He may act as a Senior Leader if he is not in the command distance of another Senior Leader and can activate units in the same way. If he is killed another soldier may carry the icon but may not act as a Leader as described.\n\nCAVALRY SQUAD These troops are treated as the equivalent Requetés infantry, but are mounted on horses.

Their one common facet was that they were all ostensibly devout and fervent Roman Catholics. To what extent this was true in each individual case is open to question, but nevertheless it does appear that, as a rule religious fervor within units of Requetés did surpass revolutionary or counter-revolutionary fervor in almost any other unit, with perhaps the exception of the Legion, which also shared some of socio-religious beliefs generally held by the Requetés. In the Legion’s case, this was mixed with a discipline code and culture which glorified sacrifice for country, giving them the edge on acts of virtually suicidal bravery.\n\nbecame ‘Commissars of God’ in the Requete formations.\n\nThe bulk of the Requetés were drawn from Navarre and the areas surrounding it and which culturally were very much part of ‘Old Spain’. Only in the few towns that had embraced industry, was there anything like any popular support for socialist views and by and large, little had changed since the Middle Ages. The only other area of note for producing Requetés was Andalucia, where as a show of strength for the ‘Traditionalist’ movement, six hundred of them had marched through Seville, earlier in 1936.\n\nDespite their amalgamation with the Falange in April 1937, the appearance of the Navarrese units remained largely unchanged throughout Civil War and the FET de las Jons adopted their distinctive Red Berets (Boinas Rojas). Contrary to popular belief however, these were not universal and many individuals and units wore their civilian black berets. While the Falangist units in the North were virtually absorbed by the more numerous Requetés there, the Andalucian Requetés remained as distinctive units until the end of the Civil War.\n\nLittle wonder therefore that belief that the Rojos (Reds) wanted to tear down everything that Spain meant to these people and commit them to an eternity in purgatory for crimes against God, done in their name, should provoke such fury. To add fuel to the fire, the Catholic Church supported such beliefs and routinely railed against the Rojos and their transgressions, from the pulpit. For the Requetés this was not a war over political differences, but a Holy Crusade. As was the case elsewhere, sympathetic Army officers had been helping to resurrect the militias which had defended both Monarchy (albeit with rival claimants) and Church during the Carlist Wars of the 19th Century. Military firearms were relatively few, but many individuals owned one of a range of hunting rifles and shotguns, allowing meaningful training to be undertaken. When the rebellion began the Requetés began travelling to those towns which formed the centre of the revolt in their region.\n\nInitially the various units of Requetés were grouped with line formations, so that support weapons could be attached to these militia formations and they could also enjoy somewhat more localised artillery and logistics support, than would otherwise be available to groups composed solely of Requetés. This was later formalised when the Navarrese Brigades were formed in February of 1937, each of which grouped one regular regiment with several Tercios (Battalions) of Requetés. By this time the Requetés were receiving their own support weapons as supply allowed and were beginning more and more to adopt the standard Spanish organisational structure.\n\nThis list can be used to create a Requete Infantry Platoon (Piquete) of the period July to November 1936, after which time their organisation began to conform to that of the Regular Army, as did their equipment. As a body of men, the Requetés were capable with their weapons and while any formation that has yet to come under fire, is somewhat suspect, the Requetés gained a reputation for being steadfast and at times totally without fear. Nevertheless they also suffered from lack of experience and took needless casualties that more experienced units could have avoided. Like other militias of the Civil War, the Requetés were not limited to being infantry and several mounted companies were raised in the North and at least one in the South. While not true cavalry, they performed the mounted infantry and scout roles more than adequately.\n\nFor the Navarrese it was Pamplona and for the Andalucians Seville. While as usual there were not sufficient support weapons to equip them, rifles were available, albeit of some antiquity on occasion. In many cases contingents of men were also accompanied by their local priests, who in effect\n\nPage 18\n\nItalian Corpo Truppe Volontarie ITALIAN CTV RIFLE PLATOON (NATIONALIST ) The standard Italian pattern Rifle Platoon (Plotone di Fucilieri) consisted of a Platoon Headquarters of a Lieutenant (Tenente), who was assisted by a Platoon Sergeant (Primo Sergente). It is likely that two Privates were also present as the officer’s servant and the platoon runner. There were three twelve-man Rifle Sections (Squadra), each consisting of a Sergeant (Sergente), a Corporal (Caporale) and 10 Riflemen. All were armed with a Modello 91/28 or similar bolt action rifle, with the exception of one man, who manned the section’s Breda M30 light machine gun. The Sergeant could substitute a Beretta M1918/30 or similar sub-machine gun for his rifle. The section was typically divided between a ‘gun group’ and a ‘grenadier group’, led by the Sergeant and Corporal respectively.\n\nUnlike both the domestic Italian Army and MSVN formations, the units of the CTV had a high ratio of motor transport, principally to showcase Italy’s military as a modern force. Both the 1st CCNN Division \"Dio lo Vuole\" and the regular army 4th “Littorio” Division, were both fully motorized formations, with dedicated transport for even the infantry. The remaining formations were classed as semi-motorised, with formations being ‘shuttled’ by a fleet of integral transport. There was not a single horse in the whole of the CTV. ITALIAN ARMY & FLESCHA PLATOON FORCE RATING Regular: +5 Command Dice: 5 CCNN ‘BLACKSHIRT’ PLATOON FORCE RATING Green or Regular: +3 if Green, +5 if Regular Command Dice: 5\n\nThe MSVN units followed the same organisation structure, but substituted their own ‘Romanised’ unit and rank names. Platoons became Manipolos, led by a Capo di Manipolo. The Squadra were led by a Capo di Squadra and were composed of Squadristi. The respective second in commands simply prefixed their rank with Sotto (Sub), i.e. Sotto-Capo di Manipoli. No support weapons were held in the individual Companies (Compagnia in the Army, Centuria in the MSVN), but the 4th Company in the battalion contained both Medium Machine Gun and Mortar Platoons. Unlike their Spanish allies, the Italians appear to have attached these units to individual companies as the tactical situation demanded. Heavier support was also held at Regimental and Divisional levels, consisting of a range of medium mortars, anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns and artillery. Although grouped into separate formations, tank or armoured car units could also be added to a force.\n\nPage 19\n\nPLATOON HEADQUARTERS Tenente and Primo Sergente (Senior Leaders), armed with pistol or SMG and two riflemen runners.

The battle cry of the House of Savoy was the signal to hurl grenades and assault the enemy. To reflect this, when a Senior Leader attached to a Team or Squad uses two Command Initiatives, he may lead a charge against any enemy within 12” preceded by a hail of grenades. Roll 1D6, subtracting 1 if the enemy is in light cover, 2 if in hard cover. On a roll of 1 or 2, one hand grenade has hit the target unit; on 3 or 4, two grenades hit; on 5 or 6, three grenades hit the target. Roll for the effect of these and the Team or Squad may then move with up to 3D6 to try to initiative Close Combat.\n\nGRUPPO MITRAGLIATORI It was Italian tactical doctrine that the Commandante di Squadra, the Squad Sergente, regulate the control of the machine gun group, in particular looking to provide fire support for his own manoeuvre element under the Caporale and the other squad. To reflect this doctrine when the Sergente is attached to a machine gun team and uses two or more Command Initiatives to direct their fire, he may add D3 to the Team’s Firepower dice.\n\n*Only one selection. **Not before April 1937.\n\nPage 20\n\nARMY SUPPORT LIST NOTES\n\nITALIAN HAND GRENADES\n\nMost of the support options will be self-explanatory. All armoured cars come with a Junior Leader. Transport only vehicles, such as a car are simply vehicles, which come with no crew. Remember, you will need to allocate men to drive these.\n\nItalian hand grenades depended on the force of an impact-­‐based detonation system, which proved unreliable in action. To reflect this they roll with a -­‐1 to hit their target.\n\nVehicles do not have radios. Infantry Teams rarely come with a Leader, whereas heavier support weapons do. The lists show all Junior Leader assignments where they are present for all troops barring vehicles as discussed above.\n\nAn Italian Scout squad is made up of one Junior Leader and five scouts with rifles and grenades. If starting the game dismounted roll 1d6 per squad before the Patrol Phase begins. On a score of 4,5,6 you gain one free Patrol Phase move with any of your markers. This is in addition to any scenario specific rules regards bonus patrol moves, however, a force may never have more than six free patrol phase moves. When deployed dismounted troops are placed on-table without their motorcycles.\n\nThe following support options need some notes.\n\nBRIXIA M35 45MM MORTAR TEAM Each squad consisted of a single Italian Brixia M35 45mm mortar. The squad includes a weapons gunner and two loaders. All were armed with rifles. The Italian 45mm mortar is very accurate adding +1 when firing at any target in line of sight. However, the mortar rounds have poor fragmentation so do not reduce cover by one level. The Italian 45mm mortar has H.E. and smoke rounds available. It has a minimum range of 18”, but closer than that the crew may use their carbines. However, only three smoke rounds may be fired by each mortar in any game\n\nMOTORCYCLE SCOUT SQUAD\n\nA dismounted scout squad may move with 1D6 or 2D6 and then assume a Tactical stance when activated by a Leader using two Command Initiatives.\n\nRANDOM AIR SUPPORT Refer to the Specific Rules for Random Air Support.\n\nAP AMMUNITION The CV 33/35 may be equipped with Armour Piercing ammunition. If taken the round has an AP of 1 and ammunition lasts only in the turn it is fired.\n\nA Senior or Junior Leader may both activate and/or spot for the Mortar Team, at a cost of one command initiative point, if the Mortar Team is within their command range. No other unit may spot for the Mortar Team, which off course, can spot for itself.\n\n81MM MORTAR SQUAD Each battalion only had two medium mortars in total. The bombardment area for a two-tube mortar section is 10”x10” with the aiming point at the centre. Use the rules for Off Table Forward Observation Teams when firing.\n\n65/17 FIELD GUN BATTERY Refer to the Specific Rules for a 65/17 Artillery Battery.\n\nFLAMETHROWERS The M35 infantry flamethrower teams are two men strong. The Italian flamethrower has a maximum range of 6”. Italian flamethrower tanks have a maximum range of 18”.\n\nPage 21\n\nThe reputation of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie, the Corps of Italian ‘Volunteers’ sent by Mussolini to support the Nationalists, has probably suffered as much from Francoist propaganda and subsequent historical commentary based on that propaganda, as it ever did from Republican bullets. While the force did have its shortcomings, not least that they were not actually volunteers and in some cases not even soldiers, it was by far the most modern and best trained of the forces involved in the Civil War. Despite Franco’s publicly low opinion of them and the extent to which he minimalized their contribution to his victories, Italian troops formed between 25% to 50% of the formations involved in any major Nationalist offensive between their arrival in early 1937 and the end of the Civil War. While he never publically praised them, a sort of belated acknowledgment of their sacrifice, was given to them by placing an Italian unit at the head of the Victory Parade of 1939. The Condor Legion, the formation upon which so much ink has been used praising their over-rated contribution, brought up the rear of the 100,000 man parade. At the time the Italian military doctrine was perhaps the most advanced in the World. The concepts of rapid advance (Celere) by motorised units, supported by artillery and close air-support, was ‘Blitzkrieg’ warfare before the term had ever been coined. Italy’s infantry had adopted a tactical organisation, which included the now-standard ‘trinary’ formations, now used almost world-wide, as early as 1929, as well as the idea of modular support elements and the formation of ad hoc battlegroups for specific missions and situations. It was however a tactical doctrine that by and large, its military was unable to operate to, due to the overall lack of motorized transport across the whole of its forces. The CTV was lavishly equipped with motor transport by any standard of the time and was actually able to put many of these ideas into practice. The difficulty was that Italian doctrine clashed with Spanish Nationalist aims. In a typical war, rapidly moving offensives that took vast swathes of ground before the enemy could marshal its forces to counter-attack, would have been perfect. Franco however wanted to take Spain inch by inch, removing any remaining trace of socialism, root and branch as he proceeded. What was more, he wanted to be seen to achieve the rebuilding of Spain and its people without outside help. It was to be a Reconquista that took Spain back from the Rojos\n\n(‘Reds’), achieved by true Spaniards. Mussolini on the other hand, wanted to be seen as the dominant man in the Mediterranean and Southern Europe, and it to be clear that Spain’s deliverance from ‘Communism’ could only possibly be achieved with his support. For the Italian commanders therefore, besides struggling with Republican armies that were becoming increasingly more able and indeed well-equipped, they had to attempt to demonstrate that their victories were being achieved solely by the Italian Corps, while resisting Spanish attempts to divide their formations and to deploy their troops in wasteful operations, in which they would bear the brunt of the fighting and obviously the resultant casualties. The initial use of the Italians was during the Andalucian campaign to take the Malaga, where the 1st MSVN Division, supported by the first of the tank units, proved more than adequate for the task ahead of it. While the brunt of the ill-coordinated and somewhat divided resistance was directed at the Nationalist forces advancing up the coast, the Italians still had some hard-fighting to do, across some quite poor terrain. Facing almost even numbers of enemy troops, the combined Spanish-Italian force was victorious. Franco played down the victory, not only because the Italians had largely been responsible for it, but also that the Spanish commander, Quiepo de Llano, the man who had taken Seville and created the bridgehead for the Nationalists in the South, was at risk of being seen as a potential rival to his position. The next major action for the Italians was the Battle of Guadalajara, where despite atrocious weather, the Italians were able to create a 30km salient which threatened the route through which the Republicans were re-supplying Madrid. Despite a massive Republican counterattack and the well-known apparent ‘rout’ of the Italians (who were also supported by Spanish troops), there was still a somewhat smaller salient existing at the end of the battle. The Italians had taken heavy losses however and some troops had not proved up to the task. Franco made much of the apparent failure of the CTV and the whole affair was an embarrassment to Mussolini on the international political stage. The reorganization of the CTV after Guadalajara led to the disbandment of two of the Blackshirt Divisions, whose men were used to replace losses in other units and the creation of the first mixed Italo-Spanish ‘Flecha’ (Arrow) formations. The rank and file of these\n\nPage 22\n\nformations was to be wholly Spanish, organized on the Italian model, with Italian equipment and Italian officers and training personnel. While the first such brigade was based on the Italian XXIII de Marzo independent motorised brigade, the two that followed were almost entirely Spanish. Each was later expanded to divisional size, with the added formations once more almost wholly composed of Spanish troops. Both the two remaining Italian divisions (2nd MSVN and 4th ‘Littorio’) continued to make the same contribution to Nationalist successes as previously, but propaganda attention was now focused on the ‘Spanish Flecha’ formations, in line with Franco’s desire to depict the eventual Nationalist victory as a wholly Spanish Victory. This list can be used to represent both the Regular Army formations within the 4th ‘Littorio’ Division and any of the MSVN Divisions forming the CTV. The list can also be used to represent the Flechas. The men of the Raggruppamento Repartí Specializzati (RRS), the Corp’s composite armoured brigade, when not broken up to act in an infantry support role, have their own list.\n\nPage 23\n\nITALIAN MOTOCICLISTI FORCE RATING Regular: +0 Command Dice: 5 PLATOON HEADQUARTERS Tenente and Primo Sergente, both Senior Leaders, armed with pistol or SMG and two riflemen. Two motorcycles. Three Squads per Platoon, each\n\nItalian CTV - Raggruppamento Repartí Specializzati\n\nSQUADS ONE TO THREE Sergente, Junior Leader, armed with a rifle or SMG. 5 Riflemen. 3 Motorcycles.\n\nPLOTONE DI MOTOCICLISTI (NATIONALIST ) The Motorcycle Platoons of the RRS were small Scout units. The Platoon command element consisted of a Lieutenant (Tenente), a Platoon Sergeant (Primo Sergente) and two Riflemen (Fucilieri), the whole element mounted on two motorcycles. Each platoon had three Sections (Squadra), each composed of a Sergeant (Sergente) a Corporal (Caporale) and four Fucilieri, with three motorcycles per section. Typically the officers carried pistols, with other ranks carrying the Moschetto M.91 Carbine, although one or more SMGs might be found within the platoon. The typical support for these groups was the Lancia IZM armoured cars of the Compagnia de Automitragliatrice (Motorised Machinegun Company), or the CV 33/35 tanks of the Carristi Companies. Support could also be provided by motorised artillery unit, possibly a unit of the CV 33/35 ‘Fiamme’ of the Flamethrower tank company, all of which were attached to the RRS. In addition a Spanish motorised infantry company was deployed to support the RRS. These were deployed in their platoons and carried in two trucks as two halfplatoons, one commanded by their Lieutenant, the other by their Platoon Sergeant. In addition, when anti tank support was added it is understood that it came from the mixed platoons that were made up of a single gun of the well regarded Cannone da 47/32 and three 37mm Cannone da 37/45.\n\nAll men in the platoon are equipped with hand grenades and carry rifles, except where noted. Squads may start the game dismounted – if so, they apply the RRS ‘Mobility’ characteristic.\n\nARMY SUPPORT LIST NOTES Most of the support options on the list will be selfexplanatory. All tanks and armoured cars come with a Junior Leader. Vehicles do not have radios. Transport only vehicles, such as a car are simply vehicles, which come with no crew. Remember, you will need to allocate men to drive these. As this is a motorised formation every ground support weapon and infantry unit may be provided with a truck to tow or carry it. A Truck can tow a single infantry, anti-tank or anti-aircraft gun, or carry up to three machine gun teams, or a single infantry section. A Spanish Infantry Platoon will always come with its full complement of Leaders. Weapon Teams rarely come with a Leader, whereas heavier support weapons do. Where two or more support weapons of the same type are selected, a single Junior Leader is provided to command the Section. The lists show all Junior Leader assignments where they are present for all troops barring vehicles as discussed above. The following support options need some notes.\n\nMOTOCICLISTI Additional motorcycle squads may be added and if three are taken as support, an additional platoon command element is gained without counting as a support choice. They may also take the MotoMitragliatrice support option if two or three squads are taken.\n\nPage 24\n\nITALIAN CTV RRS SUPPORT LIST LIST ONE Medical Orderly Adjutant Roadblock Barbed Wire Small Truck to tow or carry a single weapon team.

This selection is for one-half of a platoon, always considered to be commanded by a Junior Leader. They are taken dismounted. Presuming that these units also had their 50mm Mortar Teams, these must also have been split between the sections and are added into the total Section strength, giving one LMG Team, Two Rifle Teams and a Mortar Team. There is a single Senior Leader and one member of a single team may be a Junior Leader.\n\nITALIAN HAND GRENADES Italian hand grenades depended on the force of an impact-­‐based detonation system, which proved unreliable in action. To reflect this they roll with a -­‐1 to hit their target.\n\nMOTO-MITRAGLIATRICE There were units of Motorcycle Machineguns within the RRS. These shared the same organisation and role as the Motorcycle Platoons, except each squad had a single Breda M.30 light machine gun as well as its carbines. If this option is taken, the three original core squads of the platoon must allot one figure as the weapon’s gunner and another as its loader.\n\nMOTORCYCLES Motorcycles operate as wheeled vehicles but re-­‐roll any 1’s rolled.\n\n75/27 FIELD GUN BATTERY Refer to the Specific Rules for a 75/27 Artillery Battery.\n\nAP AMMUNITION The CV 33/35 may be equipped with Armour Piercing ammunition as a level one choice. If taken the round has an AP of 1 and ammunition lasts only in the turn it is fired.\n\nPage 25\n\nCTV RRS CHARACTERISTICS MOBILITY For each squad you can gain one free Patrol phase move with one of your markers as per the rules. When deployed dismounted troops are placed ontable without their motorcycles. In addition, a dismounted squad(s) may move with 1D6 or 2D6 and then assume a Tactical stance when activated by a Leader using two Command Initiatives.\n\nSAVOIA! The battle cry of the House of Savoy was the signal to hurl grenades and assault the enemy. To reflect this, when a Senior Leader attached to a Team or Squad uses two Command Initiatives, he may lead a charge against any enemy within 12” preceded by a hail of grenades. Roll 1D6, subtracting 1 if the enemy is in light cover, 2 if in hard cover. On a roll of 1 or 2, one hand grenade has hit the target unit; on 3 or 4, two grenades hit; on 5 or 6, three grenades hit the target. Roll for the effect of these and the Team or Squad may then move with up to 3D6 to try to initiative Close Combat.\n\nGRUPPO MITRAGLIATORI As expected, the Italian tactical doctrine of using the Squad Sergente to regulate control of the machine gun group applied to the forces of the RRS. To reflect this doctrine when the Sergente is attached to a machine gun team and uses two or more Command Initiatives to direct their fire, he may add D3 to the Team’s Firepower dice.\n\nThe Raggruppamento Repartí Specializzati (Groupment of Special Units) – RSS, was a composite formation within the Corpo di Truppe Volontarie, which encapsulated all of the armoured units, as well as several other specialist units. In April 1937 it was divided into two battalions (battaglione), the first composed of the four tank companies (Compagnia di Carristi), the Anti-tank Platoon (Sezione Anti-Carro) and a Spanish infantry company, which the Italians provided with two trucks for each of the three platoons. The second battalion was composed of the Armoured Car Company (Compagnia di Auto-Mitragliatrice), the Motorcycle Machine Gun Company (Compagnia di Moto-Mitragliatrice), and the Flamethrower Tank Company (Compagnia de Lanciafiamme e Chemica). The Group never fought as a single formation and instead ‘Company Battlegroups’ were formed around individual tank companies. While there were not sufficient units to reinforce all four companies, typically a company would be reinforced by an antitank gun, an armoured car platoon, a motorcycle machine gun platoon, a flamethrower tank platoon and a Spanish motorized infantry platoon. From September 1937 a battery of German PaK 36/37 anti-tank guns (Cannone 37/45 M.36), were added, enabling each company to have an anti-tank platoon and 20mm anti-aircraft guns, 65/17 towed infantry guns, an engineer unit, as well as motorcycle scouts, drawn from within the CTV Infantry divisions, expanded these reinforced companies even further. Around the same time the Spanish infantry were withdrawn from the unit. The final addition to the Group was a company of T-26 tanks, captured and refitted, sometime in early 1938. This list can be used to create a reinforced motorcycle or motorcycle-machine gun platoon from any point between January 1937 and the end of the Civil War. Although the RSS was not formed before the Malaga campaign, the units fronting the Italian Columns were in fact similar composite formations, but on a smaller scale. For such an early unit, replace the Spanish motorized infantry option with an Italian one. Otherwise, providing the dates for the implementation of weapons and equipment are followed, it will be representative of the ‘infantry’ portion of a reinforced Carristi unit at any point in the Civil War.\n\nPage 26\n\nseems evident that individual machine gun sections were now being attached to individual companies, rather than the previous massing of the company’s weapons as a ‘massed battery’. Artillery, armour, anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons, as they became available, were all held at divisional level and apportioned to individual regiments at the discretion of the Divisional Commander. The Nationalists also created several machine gun battalions as divisional level units.\n\nBando Nacional Infantry NATIONALIST ARMY INFANTRY, NOV 1936 The Nationalists largely preserved the Spanish preWar organization pattern and with some minor alterations, applied it across every infantry formation, whether it had originated as a regular or a militia unit. Initially there were weapon shortages, particularly as regards mortars and automatic weapons, but these were soon made good by items supplied by the Germans and Italians. The Platoon (Sección) was still to consist of a small Headquarters (Plana Mayor), with two Rifle-Grenadier Sections (Pelotones de Fusileros Granaderos). The HQ continued to be composed of the Platoon Leader, a 1st or 2nd Lieutenant (Teniente or Alférez), assisted by a Platoon Sergeant (Sargento Primero) and with two Fusileros, who were probably a bugler and platoon clerk/runner respectively. The two mortar Squads attached to the Platoon HQ were now gone, to be replaced by a company level section with two weapons.\n\nRIFLE GRENADIER PLATOON It is clear that many units did not always have their full authorised levels of support weapons initially. The platoon is therefore presented with its full complement of personnel, but light machine guns and mortars are to be added as support choices. The Troop Rating of Regular applies to Legion, Regulares and Navarre units as well as ‘Offensive’ Division units, with ‘Defensive’ Division units rated Green. PLATOON FORCE RATING Regular or Green: -2 or -4 Regular: -1 (Legion, Regulares, Navarre) Command Dice: 5\n\nThe two Rifle-Grenadier Sections remained identical, with a Sergeant (Sargento) leading three Squads (Escuadras), each of three Squads of a Corporal (Cabo) and five Riflemen (Fusileros), except the first Squad which had only four Riflemen. The first Squad operated the Section’s light machine gun when one was available. All men were armed with rifles, but some sergeants were able to obtain one of several types of sub-machine gun that became available. The Machine Gun Platoons of the Machine Gun Company were, like their Republican counterparts heavily reduced, with many sections operating one instead of two weapons initially, giving many platoons just two or three weapons, instead of the ‘paper strength’ of four. The Rifle Companies now each had a single section of two 50mm mortar Squads. At battalion level there were two 81mm medium mortars and a single infantry gun, plus the weapons of the Machine Gun Company. As was the case with the Republicans, it\n\nPage 27\n\nPLATOON HEADQUARTERS Teniente, armed with pistol and Sargento Primero, armed with rifle or SMG, both Senior Leaders.

Squads equate to Teams in this organisation. Legion, Regulares, Navarre are rated Aggressive.\n\nNATIONALIST - INFANTRY CHARACTERISTICS Sargento (Rifle-Grenadier Platoon): The section sergeant usually directed the fire of the section LMG. This required a degree of experienced soldiers. Therefore, all Nationalist infantry, except those rated Green, that has a Sargento Junior Leader attached to a machine gun team, and who uses two or more Command Initiatives to direct their fire, may add D3 to the Team’s Firepower dice.\n\nMACHINE GUN PLATOON The provision of automatic weapons to those formations which lacked them in the early months of the war, caused general shortages outside of the Legion and Moroccan units. The Platoon is therefore presented with its full personnel complement, but its weapons are selected from the support list. The ideal provision of machine guns was one weapon to each of the first two Squads of each section, giving four for the platoon overall. Nevertheless platoons with just two or three weapons could be found as late as 1939. PLATOON FORCE RATING Regular: -2 Regular: 0 (Legion, Regulares, Navarre) Command Dice: 5 PLATOON HEADQUARTERS Teniente, armed with pistol and Sargento Primero, armed with rifle or SMG, both Senior Leaders.

The three that stand out are the Foreign Legion, Moroccan Regulares and Navarre (Requetés) troops, who quite naturally carried forth their motivations and characteristics from 1936, but also changed from those experiences. They have the following Special Rule Characteristics.\n\nNATIONALIST - LEGION CHARACTERISTICS La Legion: Whilst the caliber of Legion reinforcement decreased after the excesses of the 1936 offensives, the Legion still had enough of a veteran cadre to instill an aggressive spirit into its formations. Therefore, they are always treated as Aggressive.\n\nNATIONALIST INFANTRY PLATOON SUPPORT LIST LIST ONE Adjutant Section Leaders (1938+) Medical Orderly Car or Truck Minefield Barbed Wire Roadblock Entrenchments for one Squad Engineer Mine Clearance Squad, 3 men Engineer Wire Cutting Squad, 3 men Engineer Demolition Squad, 3 men Tank Hunters (Regulares only) Molotov Cocktails Light Machine Gun to equip a single Squad Top Mounted MMG fitted to T-26B/BT-5/BA-3/6*** AP Ammo for Panzer I or CV 33/35 Pre-Game artillery (Light)* LIST TWO Small Tiznao vehicle Priest (Navarre units only) Religious Icon (Navarre units only) Caíd (Moroccan units only) Captured FA-I/UNL-35 Captured Hispano-Suiza MC36 (MG) Pre-Game artillery barrage* LIST THREE Sniper Squad 50mm Mortar Section with observer* (on-table) Medium Machine Gun to equip a single MG Squad 70/16 Infantry Gun with Junior Leader & 5 crew* Pak 35/36 AT gun with Junior Leader & 5 crew CV 33/35 or Panzer I Tank Captured BA-3/BA-6 or M37 Captured Hispano-Suiza MC36 (45mm) Medium Tiznao vehicle Random Air Support Off-table Machine Gun Fire Support Pre-Game artillery barrage (Heavy)* LIST FOUR 81mm Mortar Section with observer Moroccan Cavalry Scouts Medium Machine Gun Squad with Junior Leader 2cm Flak 30 with Junior Leader & 5 crew 75mm Field Gun with Junior Leader & 5 crew Panzer I with 20mm Breda** Captured T-26B Captured BT-5 (only after Nov ’37) Large Tiznao vehicle LIST FIVE LIST SIX 75/28 Field Gun Battery with observer 88mm Flak 18 Gun with Junior Leader & 5 crew LIST SEVEN Medium Machine Gun Section with Junior Leader *This option may only be selected once ie field guns or mortars.

If it is the light barrage, then the 50mm on-table mortar section may not be taken as a choice from the support list - the light barrage represents the use of the 50mm mortar battery; the opposing player adds +1 to his die roll per rule 4.3. The Heavy barrage represents the dedicated assets of 105mm+ batteries in support; the opposing player subtracts -1 to his die roll per rule 4.3.\n\nMoroccans: These fierce North African troops were very adept at the use of any cover where seemingly none existed. Moroccans can move with 1D6 or 2D6 and assume a Tactical stance at the end of their movement. They are treated as Aggressive. Under the eyes of the Caíd: If selected as a support choice, the Caíd may be activated on a Command Dice roll of 5. If the player activates the Caíd, he does not increase his Chain of Command tally by one. When activated a Caíd moves as normal. If attached to a squad he may move with that squad without being activated himself.\n\nSECTION LEADERS All Platoon Section leaders may be upgraded to Superior Junior Leaders from 1938.\n\nLMG One weapon per selection may be issued to a Squad. In a Squad which is equipped with a light machine gun, the Cabo will become its gunner and a Fusilero will become its loader. Other Fusileros in the same Squad can replace crew casualties.\n\nHe counts as two men for morale purposes when considering Shock levels and one man in any Close Combat. A Caíd does not fire or crew weapons, nor activate squads or teams. If the Senior Leader is killed, the presence of the Caíd reduces the effect of his loss to that of a Junior Leader. The loss of the Caíd counts as that of a Senior Leader.\n\nIn Rifle Platoons only one LMG may be issued per Squad and only Squad in a Section may be so equipped. In Machinegun Platoons only one weapon may be issued to a Squad and that Squad may not have a Medium Machine Gun issued to it.\n\nNATIONALIST - NAVARRESE CHARACTERISTICS Viva El Cristo Rey!: The Carlist battle cry “Viva El Cristo Rey!” (Long Live Christ the King!) inspired the Requeté soldiers with a religious ferocity in attack. This ethos continued in the Navarre units of 1937 and beyond. Therefore, they are always treated as Aggressive.\n\nMEDIUM MACHINE G UNS A single Medium Machine Gun may be issued, per selection, to up to two Squads in each Machine Gun Section only. The Cabo becomes the weapon’s gunner and two Fusileros are assigned as the weapon’s loaders. Other Fusileros in the same Squad can replace crew casualties.\n\nARMY SUPPORT LIST NOTES Most of the support options on the list will be selfexplanatory. All tanks, armoured cars and Tiznaos come with a Junior Leader. Vehicles do not have radios. Transport vehicles such as a car or truck, are simply the vehicle itself and come with no crew. Remember, you will need to allocate men to drive these. Where Sections are available they will always come with a Junior Leader. Infantry and weapons Squads rarely come with a leader, whereas full sections and heavier support weapons do. The lists show all Junior Leader assignments where they are present for all troops barring vehicles as discussed above. Historical Note: All weapons and vehicles should be from the same class (i.e. AT Guns, armoured cars, tanks etc) must be of the same type and model; i.e. T-26B and BT-5 tanks may not be used together.\n\nA Medium Machine Gun may not be issued in conjunction with a Light Machine Gun in the same Squad, but the Section or Platoon itself may contain a mix of both weapon types.\n\nMEDIUM MACHINE G UN SECTION A Rifle Platoon may select the Machine Gun Section as a support choice, but may not select a Machine Gun Barrage or Support Fire as additional options if he does (though an artillery barrage is still possible). The Section must be fielded as a single unit of two Squads under its Junior Leader and either may not be deployed beyond his command distance.\n\nOFF-TABLE MACHINE G UN FIRE SUPPORT Refer to the Specific Rules for Off Table Machine Gun Fire Support. If on-table MMGs are taken then offtable MG fire support is not allowed.\n\nPage 29\n\n81MM MORTARS\n\n75/28 FIELD GUN BATTERY\n\nThe Nationalists continued to deploy just two 81mm mortars as battalion support weapons. The bombardment area for the mortar section is 10”x10” with the aiming point at the centre. Use the rules for Off Table Forward Observation Teams when firing.\n\nRefer to the Specific Rules for a 75/28 Artillery Battery.\n\n50MM MORTAR SECTION Each squad consisted of a single Valero 50mm mortar. The squad includes a weapons gunner and two loaders and is accompanied by an Observer-Scout Team of an Observer and two Regulars. All were armed with rifles. Use the Platoon Observer-Scout rules when firing. The 50mm mortar only fires H.E. Rounds. It has a minimum range of 18”, but closer than that the crew may use their carbines.\n\nPLATOON OBSERVER-SCOUTS The Observer-Scouts operated as both scouts and as observers for the Mortar Squads of the platoon. Observer-Scouts when deployed on table may always end a move in a Tactical stance. As long as they have line of sight to any figure in a Mortar Squad they may spot for it (or both of them if they are deployed as a whole section). As communication involves signaling, when spotting in this way they lose their Tactical stance.\n\nRELIGIOUS ICON Navarre units often went into battle with a Religious Icon, often a holy banner carried by a respected senior non-commissioned officer. If chosen units with an attached Religious Icon may ignore one point of shock received per phase of play. The banner bearer may not fire a weapon but does count as fighting in combat. He may act as a Senior Leader if he is not in the command distance of another Senior Leader and can activate units in the same way. If he is killed another soldier may carry the icon but may not act as a Leader as described.\n\nTANK HUNTERS A maximum of two Teams may be formed per platoon, each from one of the platoon’s Sections, each Team counting as one support list choice. For each choice taken a Senior or Junior Leader may create a new Tank Hunter Team following the rules as per (4.5.7). A Team is created from three men taken from one Section in a player’s force. Tank Hunters can make one ‘Grenade and Petrol Can” attack per game as described on Table Seven (9.3.4).\n\nMOROCCAN CAVALRY SCOUTS\n\nIf within the command distance of any Senior or Junior Leader of their platoon, they may be used to activate the Mortar Squads/Section (if they have LOS) as if those squads themselves were in that Leader’s command distance, for the appropriate action points (one to activate the scouts and one to activate the Mortar Squads). This allows the Platoon’s Leaders to spot for the mortars when firing indirectly.\n\nThe Moroccan Tabors had their own Cavalry units. If part of a Nationalist formation with Moroccan forces then they may be selected as a support option. The player can field a single Squad of Moroccan Cavalry organised the same way as Peninsular Army Cavalry – refer to that army list for details. This selection assumes the cavalry is mounted. This unit uses all the Moroccan Special Rules and Cavalry Specific Rules.\n\nIf on-table support weapons ever deployed outside of this army list (possibly in a scenario game) they will usually have their own Observer-Scouts, who can also be used the same way by the Platoon’s Senior Leaders in respect to the weapon team they belong to and are activated in the same way as above.\n\nCAPTURED VEHICLES\n\nPRIEST Most Navarre companies had their own Priest, who went into battle with them. Units with an attached Priest are rated as Aggressive and always ignore the first point of shock received. They have their shock reduced by double the usual amount (i.e. 2 points per initiative spent) if both a leader and Priest are attached - See Section 4.5.3. The instant the Priest is no longer attached apply all rules relating to shock to effected units. Priests are treated as officers when determining loss in play.\n\nThe Nationalists acquired increasing numbers of captured vehicles as the war continued, so much so that each armoured battalion was able to field a whole company of T-26B tanks, often including a platoon of BT-5 tanks, by the end of the war. These were formed into units of a single type however and any vehicles used must be of the same type and not a mix.\n\nRANDOM AIR SUPPORT & MOLOTOV COCKTAIL Refer to the Specific Rules for Random Air Support and Molotov Cocktails.\n\nAP AMMUNITION The Pz I or CV 33/35 may be equipped with Armour Piercing ammunition. If taken the round has an AP of 1 and ammunition lasts only in the turn it is fired.\n\nPage 30\n\nThe main difficulty faced by the Nationalist Army was providing sufficient support weapons to its infantry formations. Although it had been able to equip the Falangists, Requetés and other volunteers with rifles, many of its regular units, outside the Army of Africa at least, were themselves short of mortars and automatic weapons. Initially the various militias and volunteers had simply been incorporated into existing regular formations to bring them up to their full wartime complement, although they largely retained t"
