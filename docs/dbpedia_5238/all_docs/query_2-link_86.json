It describes how this degree programme contributes to:\n\nyour learning within your chosen discipline together with important discipline-crossing links\n\nyour development as a person\n\nyour development as a professional in your discipline\n\nThe joint programmes across seven major languages offered by the five departments within the School of Modern Languages enable students to develop a high degree of fluency and accuracy in a combination of two modern languages of international importance. Further options are available in Catalan, Czech and Slovak.While the Single Honours degrees available in French, German, Hispanic Studies, Italian, Russian and Spanish allow students to acquire a more detailed specialist knowledge of the cultures associated with a particular language, the joint programmes allow students to acquire comparable levels of fluency in two languages (from the same or from separate language families) combined with a wide coverage of related literary, cultural, historical, societal and linguistic interests. The University recognises that it is the inter-relationship between the mastery of foreign languages and the development of a broad and deep appreciation of these languages' cultural, historical and societal contexts which underpins the value of degrees in Modern Languages. The diversity of provision within these degrees beyond the concentration on language acquisition itself allows for interdisciplinary interests to be developed, particularly when the cultures and histories of more than one language-speaking community are considered, as in these degree programmes. Students can expect to acquire a high level of intercultural awareness through exposure to one or more cultures in each of the modern foreign languages they study, as well as on the basis of their personal backgrounds.Joint degrees can be an excellent preparation for those students who intend to pursue careers for which linguistic skills are central (translation, interpreting, teaching, Foreign Office, etc.), and for whom a broader choice of languages is a distinct advantage. The joint programmes have in common with the Single Honours programmes offered by the departments of the School of Modern Languages the development of the key intellectual, cognitive, practical and personal skills offered by an Arts degree.These joint programmes have in common a third year spent abroad, divided equally between two countries to develop linguistic fluency and cultural awareness in both languages. Students normally divide their time equally between the two languages and associated cultural units in their first year, but in the second and final years may, if they choose, weight their studies (within a given framework) towards the cultural units offered in one or other of the two languages. A small number of generic cultural or linguistic units may also be offered across all combinations. The core language units in both major languages remain mandatory throughout the degree programme. Students may enter the University to study both languages from A-level standard (or equivalent) onwards or, with the exception of French, they may choose to study one of the two major languages at ab initio level or from GCSE standard (or equivalent). As subsidiary subjects, students of Spanish and Portuguese may also study Catalan; students of Russian may also study Czech; and students of Russian and Czech may also study Slovak.\n\nProgramme outcomes Spanish\n\nThe learning outcome statements shown below for your programme have been developed with reference to relevant national subject benchmarks (where they exist), national qualification descriptors (see the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications) and professional body requirements.\n\nTeaching, learning and assessment strategies are listed to show how you will be able to achieve and demonstrate the learning outcomes.\n\nThis programme provides opportunities for you to develop and demonstrate knowledge and understanding, qualities, skills and other attributes in the following areas:\n\nLearning by knowledge (i.e. Making a personal connection to your field of study)\n\nProgramme Intended Learning Outcomes Learning/teaching methods and strategies\n\nBe able to read, understand, speak, write and translate in a variety of contexts and registers.\n\nHave a broad understanding of the key ideas, themes, moments and developments in the language, literature, society, culture and history of Spanish-speaking countries from the medieval period to the present day.\n\nGain in-depth knowledge of specific periods and aspects of the language, literature, society, culture, politics and history of Spanish-speaking countries\n\nKey cultural concepts of linguistic, literary and historical analysis.\n\nThe reality of everyday life in a Spanish- speaking society.\n\nThe impact of Hispanic culture on European civilisation and the connections with related disciplines.\n\nThe opportunity to explore the cultural knowledge of Spain, Latin America and other countries where Spanish is spoken and consider their role in one or more area such as film, music, art, etc..\n\nThe ability to carry out a sustained piece of independent research using relevant source material.\n\nKnowledge and understanding are acquired through: lectures, seminars, tutorials, intensive language classes, directed reading, regular written coursework and practical language work (supported by the facilities of the Multimedia Centre), and a compulsory period of residence in the country or countries where the language is spoken.\n\nMethods of assessment (formative and summative)\n\nA range of essay writing skills (short and extended essays).

This illustrates increasing intellectual standards as you progress through the programme. These levels are mapped against the national level descriptors published by the Quality Assurance Agency.\n\nOther information\n\nAdmissions Information\n\nFor information on the admissions requirements for this programme please see details in the undergraduate prospectus at http://www.bristol.ac.uk/prospectus/undergraduate/ or contact the relevant academic department.\n\nUniversity Workload statement\n\nUndergraduate Students\n\nSuccess as an undergraduate student depends on you being able to make the transition to self-motivated, independent learning. Programmes are designed to assist you in this development, in many cases by starting with units in which timetabled teaching, such as lectures and practical classes, provides the foundations of knowledge and skills in a subject, moving on to individual research-based work. Over time you will be expected to take increasing responsibility for your own learning, guided by the feedback on your work that you will receive.\n\nPostgraduate Students\n\nTaught postgraduate students are generally studying for one academic year. This is a longer year than for undergraduates, normally culminating in a research project. In a one-year full-time programme your workload will be distributed as evenly as possible, but this will depend on the precise arrangements for your programme. You will be expected to take responsibility for your own learning, guided by the feedback on your work that you will receive.\n\nAll students\n\nAt the heart of your studies at every level there must be regular and disciplined individual reading, reflection and writing and it is this skill of independent studies, above all others, that will serve you best when you leave the University.\n\nMost programmes use credits. An undergraduate 120 credit point year broadly equates to 1200 hours of student input and a postgraduate 180 credit point year to 1800 hours. This includes all activities related to the teaching, learning and assessment of taught units, including the ways that welcome week, preparation/consolidation weeks, revision weeks and assessment weeks prepare you for teaching and learning and enable you to demonstrate your achievement of the learning outcomes.\n\nA component of this is directed study, which is time that you spend in class, in contact with the teaching staff and includes activities such as lectures, laboratories, tutorials, problem-solving classes and fieldwork. Some of this activity may be online and could consist of activity that is synchronous (using real-time environments such as Blackboard Collaborate) or asynchronous (using tools such as tutor moderated discussion forums, blogs or wikis, working on examples sheets, completing coursework).\n\nIn some programmes there are field courses and/or placements that will take place in concentrated periods of time.\n\nIn addition to directed study you are expected to pursue independent study to build your knowledge and understanding of the subjects you are studying. Such independent activities include (but are not limited to) reviewing lecture material; reading textbooks; exploring the research literature and reading journal articles; writing up laboratory notes; preparing for in-class progress tests and revising for examinations.\n\nWe recognise that many students undertake paid employment. To achieve a sensible balance between work and study, you are advised to undertake paid work for no more than 15 hours per week in term-time.\n\nUG Professional Programmes in the Faculty of Health Sciences\n\nDental Surgery (BDS)\n\nDental Hygiene and Therapy (BSc)\n\nGateway to Dentistry/ Medicine/ Veterinary Science\n\nMedicine and Surgery (MB ChB)\n\nVeterinary Nursing and Bioveterinary Science (BSc)\n\nVeterinary Nursing and Companion Animal Behaviour (BSc)\n\nVeterinary Science (BVSc) and accelerated graduate entry programme.\n\nFor these professional programmes, full time attendance is compulsory unless absence is formally approved. Academic activities are timetabled throughout the 5-day week and student workload is around 40 hours per week on average. Where possible, students in the early years are permitted Wednesday afternoons for sport and extra-curricula activities. This is usually not available in later years of professional programmes as when a student progresses through their curriculum there is an increasing exposure to clinical and professional activities. Students in clinic or on placements may need to stay later than core times of 08.00 – 18.00 or even overnight to observe out-of-hours activities. It may also be necessary to work or travel to clinical placements at the weekend. This increasing exposure to clinical activities means that students on these professional programmes often have longer term dates than the University standard. Individual years within programmes are likely to vary in length (for example because of the timings of placements) and further information on this will be found in individual programme information. Another important point to note is that many of the assessments sit outside the standard University examination timetable and are likely to be more frequent, meaning that students will need to engage in revision activities and self-directed learning (including when on clinical placements).\n\nHealth Sciences Assessment Statement\n\nPlease select the following link for a statement about assessment in the Faculty of Health Sciences.
