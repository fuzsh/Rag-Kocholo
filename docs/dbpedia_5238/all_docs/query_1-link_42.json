        "text": "U.S. ARMY CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY FACT SHEET\n\nSUBJECT: The Naming of U.S. Army Posts for Confederate Army Officers\n\nBefore World War I\n\nFrom its beginnings, the U.S. Army has named posts for individuals, such as Fort Washington (for George Washington) in 1776, Fort McPherson (for James B. McPherson) in 1867, and Schofield Barracks (for John M. Schofield) in 1908. Selection of names usually was left to the local commander until the War Department, in an effort to âsecure uniformity,â promulgated General Order Number 79 in November 1878. It reserved the prerogative to name posts to regional commanders, and noted that âfortsâ were permanent, while âcampsâ were temporary.\n\nWorld War I\n\nWar Department Naming of New Installations in 1917\n\nA 17 July 1917 memorandum by Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Kuhn, chief of the General Staffâs War College Division, described the Armyâs informal policy used to name newly created camps. Of the eight criteria, the three key ones were that the name should: (1) represent a person from the locale of the troops stationed there, (2) that it be ânot unpopular in the vicinity of the camp,â and (3) that it focus on âFederal commanders for camps of divisions from northern States and of Confederates for camps of divisions from southern States.â Two other criteria could make some Civil War names âimpracticable:â names should be short âto avoid clerical laborâ and they could not be the same as the name of a living prominent person. When an appropriate Civil War name could not be used for a post, then those from other eras would be acceptable. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker was aware of this policy and approved it.\n\nGeneral Kuhn headed the board of officers that provided a list of suggested names, including alternates, for the chief of staff. The chief of staff selected the final names. His choices did not always follow the informal policy. For example, he rejected four Confederate names for southern camps housing southern troops, selecting instead northerners, or southerners from the preâCivil War era. (See Table 1.) In six instances, he followed the policy of naming camps in the south after northerners when they housed northern troops. (See Table 2.) Of the nineteen initial camps in southern states, only four were named for Confederate officers: Camp Lee (for Robert E. Lee) in Virginia, Camp Beauregard (for P. G. T. Beauregard) in Louisiana, Camp Gordon (for John B. Gordon) in Georgia, and Camp Wheeler (for Joseph Wheeler) in Georgia. (Wheeler subsequently served as a general of U.S. volunteers in the Spanish-American War and received a Regular Army commission as a brigadier general.)\n\nTABLE 1\n\nCONFEDERATE NAMES INITIALLY REJECTED DURING WORLD WAR I\n\nLOCATION TROOPS FROM NAME REJECTED NAME ACCEPTED Anniston, AL 29th Division\n\n(VA, DC, MD, DE, NJ) J.

Logan\n\n(U.S. Volunteers, Civil War) Waco, TX 32d Division\n\n(MI, WI) Arthur MacArthur Jr\n\n(U.S. Army, Philippines War)\n\nNaming of New Installations in 1918\n\nMajor General William J. Snow, the Chief of Field Artillery, recommended to the chief of staff the names for two new field artillery cantonments. Snowâs two criteria for names were that they be of a distinguished field artilleryman and short. For one in Kentucky, Snow chose Revolutionary War artillery officer Henry Knox, a Massachusetts native who later became Secretary of War. For one in North Carolina, he selected North Carolina native Braxton Bragg, who had distinguished himself as a battery commander in the Mexican War, resigned his U.S. Army commission in 1856, and joined the Confederate army in 1861. The chief of staff accepted Snowâs recommendations.\n\nIn the only known instance during World War I of the Army taking into account public opinion, Secretary Baker accepted the recommendations of the local chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Rotary Club to name a post in Georgia Camp Benning after Confederate general Henry L. Benning, who had lived in the area.\n\nPostwar Status of Posts Named for Confederate Officers\n\nIn the period between the world wars, the Army retained only two of the World War I camps named for Confederate officers. Now the site of the Infantry School, Camp Benning became Fort Benning in 1922. Camp Bragg continued as a site for field artillery training and equipment testing, and in 1922 it became Fort Bragg.\n\nThe Army closed Camp Lee after the war and the property reverted to the Commonwealth of Virginia, which used it mainly as a game preserve. In 1940, the War Department reinstated control of the property and built a second Camp Lee on it. Now the location of the Quartermaster School, the Army kept Camp Lee open after World War II and in 1950 marked its status as a permanent installation by changing its name to Fort Lee. Camp Gordon closed after World War I and a new facility elsewhere in Georgia would receive that name in World War II. Camp Beauregard was turned over to the state of Louisiana for use by its National Guard. During World War II, Louisiana returned the camp to the federal government. After the war, the Army again turned it over to Louisiana. The Army closed Camp Wheeler in 1919 and returned the land to its original owners. In 1940, the Army reopened Camp Wheeler by leasing most of the land it used in World War I; it closed the camp after World War II and returned the land to its owners.\n\nWorld War II\n\nWar Department Policy\n\nArmy Regulation 210-10, dated 1 July 1939, established a formal policy on naming installations, but stated only that âAll military posts will be named by the Secretary of War.â In 1937, however, the War Department had stated informally that those honored should be distinguished deceased persons âwho either were born in or were associated prominently with the state in which the post is located.â In March 1942, Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall indicated an intention to amend AR 210-10 to give the commanders of the serviceâs three major commands (Army Ground Forces, Army Air Forces, and Army Service Forces) âthe principal voice in the selection.â This requirement, however, does not appear to ever have been formalized. A memo of 5 December 1942 further described the âpracticeâ of the Army War Collegeâs Historical Section recommending âseveral possible namesâ for higher authority to choose from. Another memo the same month summarized the factors for selecting names, which were much like those in World War I, except that it reiterated the 1937 policy that the person should be âidentified with the locality of the post by birth or distinguished service.â The memo also noted that enlisted soldiers were eligible for the honor. The World War I policy of taking into account the home region of the troops who occupied the post was no longer used, even during the mobilization of the National Guard in 1940â1941.\n\nNew Installations Named for Confederate Officers\n\nBecause the Army was much larger in this conflict, it established many more posts than it had in World War I. It also established them over a much longer period, naming new posts as they came into existence rather than in one large batch, so each selection had its own story. In accordance with the War Departmentâs policy, camps in the south generally were named after southerners, though not all were Confederate officers. Eight major camps received Confederate names.\n\nNew Installations in the South Not Named for Confederate Officers\n\nDuring World War II the Army named a number of posts in the south for men who had not served in the Confederate army. The most significant instances were:\n\nPostwar Status of Posts Named for Confederate Officers\n\nThe Army retained Polk, A.P. Hill, Gordon, Pickett, Rucker, and Hood. It declared Camp Van Dorn surplus in October 1945 and closed the post. It declared Camp Forrest surplus in 1946 and closed the installation."
