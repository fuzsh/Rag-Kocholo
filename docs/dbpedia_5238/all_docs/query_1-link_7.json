        "text": "International Brigades, groups of foreign volunteers who fought on the Republican side against the Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). So called because their members (initially) came from some 50 countries, the International Brigades were recruited, organized, and directed by the Comintern (Communist International), with headquarters in Paris. A large number of the mostly young recruits were Communists before they became involved in the conflict; more joined the party during the course of the war. The French were the largest single foreign group (some 28,000); Germany, Austria, Poland, Italy, the United States, the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Canada, Hungary, and Belgium were also represented by significant numbers of volunteers.\n\nThe first group of 500 trainees arrived in Albacete, Spain, on October 14, 1936. As other trainees and Soviet arms arrived, they were placed under the command of representatives of the Comintern. There were seven brigades in all, and each one was divided into battalions by nationality (e.g., the French-Belgian Commune de Paris Battalion, the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion, the British Battalion). The number of volunteers probably never exceeded 20,000 at any one time, but the total number of volunteers, including a small number of women, reached about 60,000."
