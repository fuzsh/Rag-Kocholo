If a sample ballot is returned as undeliverable or indicates the voter has moved out of county/state, that voter is put into an âInactiveâ status and is sent a confirmation notice informing them that they have until the second federal general election after the date of the notice to update their voting record or appear to vote and complete the necessary form or they will be removed from the voting rolls."
