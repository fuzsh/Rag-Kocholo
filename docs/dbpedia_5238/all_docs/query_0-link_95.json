Núñez Seixas\n\nIn 1941, the Franco regime established the Spanish Division of Volunteers to take part in the Russian campaign as a unit integrated into the German Wehrmacht. Recruited by both the Fascist Party (Falange) and the Spanish army, around 47,000 Spanish volunteers joined what would become known as the “Blue Division.” The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front, 1941–1945 explores an intimate history of the Blue Division “from below,” using personal war diaries, letters, and memoirs, as well as official documents from ­military archives in Spain, Germany, Britain, and Russia. In addition to describing the Spanish experience on the Eastern Front, Xosé M. Núñez Seixas takes on controversial topics including the Blue ­Division’s proximity to the Holocaust and how members of the Blue Division have been remembered and commemorated. Addressing issues such as the behaviour of the Spaniards as occupiers, their perception by the Russians, their witnessing of the Holocaust, their commitment to the war aims of Nazi Germany, and their narratives on the war after 1945, this book illuminates the experience of Spanish combatants and occupied civilians.

Munich, summer/fall 2015; Santiago de Compostela, May 2021\n\nTHE SPANISH BLUE DIVISION ON THE EASTERN FRONT, 1941–1945\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 Introduction: The Blue Division, the Franco Regime, and the Second World War\n\nPlacing the Blue Division within New Military History The history of the Spanish Division of Volunteers, known from its inception as the Blue Division (BD), now qualifies as a classic subject in Spanish historiography. Internationally, however, it is perhaps less well known. This largely voluntary expeditionary force was formed in June/July 1941 to fight with the German Army on the Eastern Front in the Soviet-German War, immediately following the German invasion of the USSR on 22 June. In November 1943, the Spanish dictator, General Francisco Franco, ordered its retreat and sent instead the Spanish Legion of Volunteers, the “Blue Legion.” That corps remained on the front until its definitive retreat in early March 1944. Spanish participation on the Axis side in the Second World War did not end there. In 1944–5, several hundred Spanish soldiers – ex-Blue Division and Blue Legion combatants, new volunteers, and civilian workers in Germany – joined Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS units of their own initiative, assisting the struggle until the definitive fall of the Third Reich. Some even fought amidst the ruins of Berlin in April/May 1945. From 1941 to 1945, some five hundred to six hundred Spanish combatants were taken prisoner by the Red Army and remained in Soviet camps until 1954. In late March of that year, the Red Cross chartered the ship Semíramis to return 248 of them to Spain, along with four “war children” (who had been evacuated by the Spanish Republic in 1937 and taken in by the USSR). There were also thirty-one Spanish aviators and sailors who were loyal to the Republic and had been detained against their will in Soviet territory since 1939. In the air, dozens of Spanish pilots fought alongside the Luftwaffe, assisted by “Blue Squadron” ground support personnel (15. Spanische Staffel), through which around a hundred pilots passed over four periods. At sea, a group of\n\n4 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\nSpanish sailors served in the German Navy as part of a co-operative agreement that included training Spanish Navy officers in Kriegsma­ rine units, from November 1942 until the summer of 1943.1 The main objective of this book is to reconstruct the experience of Blue Division ground combatants and their direct or indirect successor units, from inception through May 1945. This group included around forty-seven thousand men; nearly five thousand of them fell in combat, while more than forty-two thousand of them returned to Spain. Among them were Fascist volunteers and idealists, or those who, due to age or geography, had missed the chance to fight for their beliefs in the Spanish Civil War. Some soldiers were enlisted or coercively recruited; others were civilian volunteers in search of adventure, extra pay, or even a chance to desert and join the Red Army. There were non-commissioned officers (NCOs) driven by anti-communism or the desire to build a military career as well as professionally or ideologically motivated army officers. A relatively high proportion of university students, young lawyers, and even university lecturers joined ranks alongside industrial and unskilled workers, employees, civil servants, shopworkers. and illiterate day labourers. In Spanish post-war society, BD veteran profiles were equally varied: from writers and artists to professional soldiers, ministers, workers, policemen, or migrants to Argentina or Germany. Some even became antiFrancoist activists during the 1950s and 1960s. With such inter-class diversity, the BD memory permeated much of the social spectrum. Unlike the memory of other Western European expeditionary forces that fought alongside the Wehrmacht against the USSR, remembrance of the Blue Division was not circumscribed by far-right political tendencies or neo-fascist cult specificities. Spanish veterans from the Eastern Front were not stigmatized “collaborators” with the Nazis, in contrast with those returning to Norway, Denmark, or France. These conditions also prevented the memory of the Blue Division from being relegated to absolute public silence. From 1945 to 1954, Spanish veterans from the Eastern Front were treated as rather inconvenient heroes by the Franco dictatorship, as it attempted to “whitewash” over its earlier sympathies towards Nazi Germany and reposition itself in the Western Bloc against the Soviet Union.2 The memory of Spanish participation in the Eastern campaign became something diffuse and ubiquitous: not forbidden or persecuted, but scarcely encouraged by the Francoist regime. This endowed it with a great capacity to endure. The same dynamics also generated a kaleidoscopic memory of the Blue Division in Spanish post-war society. For some, it was a corpus of somewhat confusing memories, anecdotes, and stories about a relative or a neighbour who fought in Russia for unknown causes. For others, it\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nwas a benchmark of ideological integrity for non-conformist Falangism or anti-communist commitment, a professional posting in a brilliant military career, or a youthful adventure fuelled by the desire to see the world beyond the Pyrenees. The Blue Division was an uncomfortable memory for the Francoist regime, and the subsequent constitutional monarchy (restored in 1975–8) was not keen to commemorate it. Occasionally, the Spanish democratic state has implicitly or explicitly equated the Blue Division and its combatants with the hundreds of Spanish Republican soldiers who fought with the Allies. This has given rise to intense moments ofand controversy. In October 2004, an ex-BD member and a former prisoner of the Soviets stood on the presidential podium as representatives of the Blue Division Foundation, together with a representative of the Spanish 9th Company (la Nueve) of the Régiment de marche du Tchad, part of the 2nd Armoured Division (Division Leclerc), who were loyal to General Charles de Gaulle and the Allies. The socialist minister of defence, José Bono, had invited them to attend as part of the 12 October (Spanish national holiday) military parade.3 This attitude persists among members of the Spanish armed forces and in military academies, which still teach and idealize the “heroic deeds” of the Blue Division. In October 2020, a leak to the daily press informed that a police operation against alleged Russian connections with Catalan nationalist leaders in relation to the failed independence referendum in October 2017 had been given the code name “Operation Volkhov,” recalling the first battle involving Spanish troops on the Eastern Front. It shows that the BD memory in post-francoist Spain still suffers from a lack of proactive, state-sponsored politics of democratic memory. After half a century, some wounds of the dictatorial past remain open and insufficiently adressed by public institutions. Numerous books have been published about the Blue Division, mostly in Spain. Its exotic subject matter has inherent appeal: a sense of adventure, Southern Europeans lost in an immense frozen landscape, an accumulation of extraordinary experiences (the journey there, contact with the German Army, fighting on a distant front, returning), and the hazy impression that the Blue Division experience left on Spanish society after 1944–5. At least until the first decade of the twenty-first century, most Spaniards knew someone whose father, uncle, or grandfather had joined the Blue Division. While commemorative writing on the Blue Division abounds, along with apologetic and descriptive approaches interested in recalling the most insignificant details, the historiographic relevance of such literature is meagre at best. However, the history of the Blue Division has also been amply treated in professional historiography. Most\n\n6 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\napproaches have sought to understand the role of the BD within the framework of the diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations between the early Franco regime and the Third Reich. Accordingly, Francoist and post-Francoist historians regarded the Blue Division as a concession made by the Franco regime to fulfil its obligations with Nazi Germany, which was pressing Spain to side with the Axis powers and enter the war. From this perspective, the Spanish BD soldiers were the “blood price” that Francoism paid to maintain its “non-belligerency” in the Second World War.4 Thus, their sacrifice had not been in vain: they had shielded Spain from the horrors of a new war, and even the threat of German invasion: Spanish heroism on the Eastern Front had shown Hitler what his troops could expect if they tried to invade Spain.5 Since the 1980s, some authors have taken the opposite view and argued that sending the Blue Division to the Eastern Front revealed the deeply Germanophile nature of Francoist officials and supporters, who would enter the war at any cost to see their fascist, totalitarian project fulfilled. The Blue Division thus constituted the purest expression of the most wholehearted Falangist sectors and much of the military, along with many traditionalists, Catholics, and conservatives who sincerely admired the anti-communist stance and military performance of the Third Reich, at least until 1944.6 Recent research has shed some new light on the the relationship between the Franco regime and Nazi Germany, adding to the contributions of diplomatic historians since the 1990s. It assigns the Blue Division a small part in the diplomatic game that was unfolding on Spanish soil from 1940 to 1945. Franco and most of his government certainly wished to enter the war on the Axis side but not without some kind of reward. Franco wanted the Germans to hand over a great part of the French colonial possessions in Africa to Spain, including French Morocco, parts of Algeria, and Cameroon. This would have been unacceptable to Vichy France. The Iberian Peninsula played only a minor role in Third Reich war strategy from early 1942 on. As its army and resources were almost negligible to German eyes, the German chancellor did not need Spain on his side at any price. Keeping Vichy France as a loyal ally and not pushing Marshal Philippe Pétain to side with the Allies was more important to Hitler than winning the full support of Franco’s Spain. This was mainly why the meeting between Franco and Hitler at the rail station of Hendaye (23 October 1940) ended in failure: Hitler prioritized ties with Vichy France and Franco returned to Spain with no tangible wins. Hitler’s interest in Spain dramatically decreased after that, as other theatres of operation required his attention. Meanwhile, British diplomacy in Spain was playing its cards by systematically bribing generals\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nand high officials to keep the country from intervening in the war on the German side. The government crisis of September 1942 and subsequent appointment of the Anglophile Count Jordana as the minister for foreign affairs marked a move towards full neutrality in Spanish diplomacy. Steady distancing from Berlin (and Rome) became more accentuated throughout 1943 and 1944. The debilitated Falangists were unable to avoid this strategic move and their projects to estabish a fully fascist “new State” in Spain faded away. Until August 1945, however, General Franco himself stuck to the theory of “three wars,” which described the world war as three separate conflicts. In the first, between Germany and the Western democracies (Great Britain, the US, and France), Spain was neutral. In the second, between Germany and the Soviet Union, Francoist Spain enthusiastically allied itself with the Third Reich against a common enemy. In the third, between the US and Japan, the Franco dictatorship increasingly backed the US but never actually declared war on Japan.7 Unlike Nazi agents and members of the Nazi Party’s foreign branch in Spain, pragmatic German diplomats in Madrid wanted Spain to remain neutral to better exploit what they considered its most interesting contribution to the Axis war effort: the regular supply of wolfram and other strategic raw materials. Francoist Spain maintained its peculiar position of “non-belligerency” until 1943, but with open preference for the Axis. This enabled Spain to provide some logistic support while avoiding involvement in military operations or declaring war on any of the belligerent countries, including the Soviet Union. The regime moved towards full neutrality in 1943, under direct pressure from the Western Allies. Meanwhile, German diplomacy acted to preserve the Third Reich’s influence on Spanish public opinion by subsidizing publications, magazines, and propaganda in an effort to present Nazi Germany in an acceptable way to Catholics and conservatives. Above all, German diplomacy attempted to maintain control and secure access to the Spanish resources deemed crucial to their war effort. German influence was remarkable in many spheres of Spanish society and culture until 1945, and still lingered for decades in areas such as Spanish civil law and the organization of the Falange single party. As the Cold War set in, however, Germanophile attitudes were conveniently archived and the Franco regime managed to adapt to new circumstances. After mid-1944, when all Spanish soldiers had returned from the Eastern Front (excepting a few hundred who continued to fight for the Third Reich on their own initiative), Francoist ministers and diplomats began portraying the sending of the Blue Division three years prior as a merely Catholic and anti-communist initiative, devoid of any proactive sympathy towards the Axis. This ran parallel to efforts by the\n\n8 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\nregime, beginning with Catholic thinkers and certain Falangist leaders, to detach its founding principles from anything resembling fascism. Francoism was now presented as a Catholic, traditionalist, and anti-communist world view, which was devoid of any totalitarian, racist, or imperialist ambition. Some studies focused almost exclusively on the “heroic deeds” of the Blue Division, the battles and operations it took part in, its overall evolution, recruitment practices, and composition. These monographs provided noteworthy reconstructions of the BD trajectory from highly diverse perspectives such as traditional military history, diplomatic history, and even economic history. Most were written from an enthusiastically pro-Francoist point of view and tried to present a benevolent, acritical image of the Blue Division. Such hagiographic, revisionist approaches by authors nostalgic for the Franco regime coexist alongside extremely positivist perspectives on the history of military operations, local histories attempting to showcase the contributions of their province and region to the expeditionary corps, and highly detailed and descriptive works on specific sections and branches of the Blue Division, from military chaplains to sappers and medical corps.8 Common to nearly all of them is their endogenous self-sufficiency, accompanied by a flagrant lack of dialogue with war studies, new military history approaches, and international historiography concerning the Eastern Front. Most of these studies also displayed blatant ignorance of the contributions and debates from the comparative history of violence and modern warfare. Approaches that have attempted to focus on the actual experience of BD members are far scarcer. These look at the ordinary men in uniform (Wolfram Wette), their motivations and reactions, their reasons for fighting, and how they were affected by participating in a war that differed substantially from prior conflicts. The Soviet-German War was an armed confrontation that began as huge display of technological and strategic modernity, but within a few months it was characterized by its extreme cruelty and high cost in human lives, and its extremely harsh climate and environmental conditions. Combat became increasingly brutalized amidst ever-growing numbers of civilian casualties, with mass killings of civilians and partisans in the rearguard.9 The Spanish volunteers in the summer of 1941 believed that they were embarking on a brief military adventure that many saw as a continuation of the Spanish Civil War. They were not always aware that they were participating in a conflict unlike many that had preceded it: a war of extermination. In English- and German-speaking spheres, this conflict is receiving renewed historiographical attention in new military history and the cultural history of violence.\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nThis book addresses a series of basic questions concerning war as a complete social reality. Why do soldiers fight? What is the difference between volunteers and conscripts? To what extent do ideology, values, and the prior socialization of combatants influence their willingness to kill? Does the image of the enemy correspond more to pre-existing cultural constructions and images of the other, or to indoctrination in service, propaganda, and the desire to avenge dead comrades following the brutalization of combat? Is violence innate in people and more likely to be activated in environmental circumstances, featuring cumulative radicalization and brutalization of combat conditions? What is the role of comradeship and loyalty to fellow soldiers with whom relationships of complicity and mutual dependence are established? Bonds forged in blood and battle are often cemented in experiences that cannot be transferred beyond the primary combat group. How do individuals experience war and how does it affect their subsequent path? To what extent does it create a new war culture, understood here as a set of cultural perceptions concerning a soldier’s own side, the enemy, and combat, which become pervasive in civil society during and after the war? Within the sphere of “new military history,” which is largely inspired by social history, new cultural history, and more recently by gender history and the transnational turn,10 this book also endeavours to update and enrich current debates on Spanish wars of the modern period, from the colonial conflicts of Cuba and Morocco to the Spanish Civil War. The social and cultural history of violence has undergone a late renewal in Spain.11 Traditional military historiography in Spain was acnhored to the exhaustive study of the Spanish Civil War (1936–9) and the subsequent mass repression by the winning side. As a result, military historians in Spain have only recently joined the tansnational methodological and theoretical debates concerning the Great War and the Second World War. Thus, for example, much of Spanish historiography and foreign historiography on twentieth-century Spain saw the ordinary combatants of both armies (Republican and insurgent or Francoist) during the Civil War as passive protagonists of an armed confrontation. The primary agents were great ideologies, world views in conflict, political parties and trade unions, great political leaders and military chiefs. Therefore, it was implicitly assumed that both sides were already drawn up in July/August 1936. However, the fact is that many soldiers became convinced of the cause they were fighting for during the course of the war. Conviction was an outcome of their war experience and the impact of martial culture in their units, and therefore in their minds.12 This would also apply to the Blue Division.\n\n10 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\nSpanish military archives suffer from a scarcity of personal sources or ego-documents such as war diaries and soldiers’ letters, even in war censorship collections, that handicaps any approach involving these subjective and everyday dimensions of the conflict. Analytical categories such as “war culture” were scarcely known or empirically assessed in Spanish historiography until the second decade of the twenty-first century. War culture correlates to a key concept in the formulation of this book: war experience and military experience in general, as a rite of passage that irreversibly modifies the perceptions, world view, and basic values of individuals who take part in war. In itself, the experience of war is individually constructed and conditioned by the sociocultural background, values, perceptions, and prior socialization of each combatant. While combat has a similar impact or immediate impression on all participants; the experience reflected by combatants hours or days later in letters or diaries will display palpable differences that reveal diverse encounters with fighting, mental landscapes, and formative background. How each individual summarizes that experience and transmits it weeks or years later will vary even more.13 In applying these concepts to the Blue Division, it becomes evident that studying the war experience of Spanish soldiers on the Eastern Front, in the war of extermination unleashed by the Third Reich against the Soviet Union, is inevitably a transnational and comparative endeavour. This perspective involves consulting sources in diverse archives, comparing mutual images of friends and foes, and constantly questioning whether the Spaniards were so typically different from the Germans and their allies as has been claimed in much of pro-Blue Division literature. South of the Pyrennees, this is the prevailing vision in the public sphere regarding Spaniards on the Russian Front, even among critics. It must be continuously contrasted with contributions from professional historiography concerning the experience of German, Soviet (still one of the least-studied aspects, even in Russian historiography), Italian, Dutch, Romanian, Finnish, or Hungarian soldiers on the Eastern Front from 1941 to 1945. While military operations are not the main object of this study, they are intrinsec to the subject matter. The operational aspects necessary to provide an overview will be addressed mainly from the perspective of German military documentation, to gain a sense of the relative importance of the Blue Division within the armies, army corps, and army groups of the German Ostheer under which it served. This also implies acknowledging that the Spanish soldiers were never an autonomous island on the Volkhov Front and in the siege of Leningrad. Alongside German, Norwegian, Flemish, Baltic, and Dutch combatants, they shared\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nvisions of the enemy, experiences or exchanges with the civilian population, and encounters with rearguard societies in Russian, Baltic, or German military hospitals. They endured the climate, the combat conditions, and the dynamics of violence and destruction, from anti-partisan warfare to the deportation of Jews in the rearguard, the shooting of political commissars, and reprisals against civilian populations. These aspects shall be examined comprehensively, focusing on combatants in land units such as infantry and artillery. The experiences of Spanish airmen, seamen, or prisoners of war will not be addressed here. Seamen were a very reduced group, and the war experience of airmen was entirely different, given the nature of their combat conditions.14 Similarly, prisoners of war in Soviet camps were also a limited group with limited sources, most of which are located in Russian archives.15 Whatever their motivation, political adherence, ideas, and experiences, soldiers do not always fight in the same way and for the same reasons. In modern warfare, bravery or heroism are problematic variables, difficult to trace and easy to idealize. Motivation, however, is more constant. Generally speaking, most soldiers enlist for a war – nearby or far away – out of sweeping principles or great ideals. They are borne along in a climate of enthusiasm or by a group of friends or comrades to defend their home or their surrounding environment, to see the world, or to earn a living. A few weeks after entering combat, most combatants keep fighting for their own survival and that of their combat group – from the platoon to the company and the “trench community.” Idealist motives lose importance but do not always disappear. The efficiency of a military unit depends largely on motivation and morale, training and skill, the quality of their commanders, and equipment. The Blue Division was just that: an infantry division of the Wehrmacht. It never covered a sector of the front greater than a few dozen kilometres, which nonetheless often exceeded average BD manpower. The Spanish units performed modestly in combat, but no better or worse than most other military units fighting alongside or against them. Though never a major cog in the strategic machinery of Army Group North, the BD was another tile in the mosaic of the Volkhov Front and the siege of Leningrad. For the German command, always captive to its own prejudices, the Spanish soldiers were individually brave, highly motivated combatants; but they were only reliable for passive defence tasks, coups de main, and small-scale or guerilla fighting. These were considered typically Spanish ways of making war. As a military collective, the Germans saw Spanish soldiers as a badly trained and insufficiently organized unit, led by unprepared officers and NCOs who could not grasp the requirements of modern warfare on the Eastern\n\n12 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\nFront. The Spanish Blue Division was a constant annoyance to the German high commanders but one they had to tolerate, partly due to diplomatic imperatives, and partly because German human and material recources were continually decreasing from late 1941 on. Though not particularly welcome, Spaniards could not easily be replaced with fresh German troops. However, the German military had no greater appreciation for other foreign legions and units, from Italians to Norwegians (Germanic or otherwise). Spaniards were not undesirable soldiers, but they were not desired. The evolution of German-Spanish relations from 1941 to 1945 is well known and serves here as a background for discussing the history of the Blue Division.16 Here, the magnifying lens is applied to military history from below, to the experiences, perceptions, and reinterpretations of cultural models and political slogans by individual combatants, within a general framework determined by war circumstances.17 Testimonies are crucial to the reconstruction of these perceptions. Key sources include letters, war diaries, unpublished and published memoirs, even fictional accounts based on the author’s war experience.18 Press articles sent from the Russian Front to local and provincial journals constitute a complementary source. These were less subject to censorship and often digressed from the idealized combat rhetoric found in contemporary testimonies of the more prominent BD members: the writers, journalists, and political leaders. This brings us to the ongoing dialectics between history and memory, between lived experience and war narratives. What many combatants wrote about years and decades later concerning their war experience – training in Germany, the journey to the front, being in the forefront or the rearguard – does not necessarily coincide with what they wrote during the war, in their letters to home or in their war diaries. The BD memory that was cultivated on the Spanish “home front” found its first expression in the cult to fallen soldiers in distant Russian locations, then in the codification of a collective account concerning the BD war experience, and later in the commemorations and activities of veterans’ associations, partly endorsed by the Francoist state institutions. It was one shard of the diffuse memory of the Eastern Front that prevailed throughout Europe after 1945. It varied greatly from one country and period to another, encompassing competition between the legacy of Stalingrad and the Auschwitz syndrome, idealization of the Great Patriotic War, comparison of the “two occupations” (German and Soviet), and the (Italian) construction of a “benign occupier” myth.19 This book also discusses the specificity and variations of the role of Spain in this transnational memory, which was highly conditioned by two\n\nIntroduction 13\n\ncircumstances. First was the exceptional longevity of the Franco regime, a dictatorship with fascist origins. It welcomed the combatants back from the Eastern Front without stigmatizing or judging them, while in other European countries they were seen as traitors. The Franco dictatorship had no qualms about remembering the veterans’ heroic deeds in public places and ceremonies. However, this ran parallel to the regime’s efforts to realign Spain with Western powers in the context of the Cold War. To this end, the adventures of the Blue Division in Russia were portrayed as a second chapter or an epilogue of the Spanish Civil War, a purely anticommunist endeavour devoid of any association with Nazi extermination policies. Second was the tolerance of the successive democratic governments towards the remnants of that memory from 1977 onwards. Ultimately, they assimilated many features of the positive memory of the Blue Division that had been generated during the previous regime, without engaging in a critical review of its role in the German war of extermination in the East. This persisted in Spanish post-Francoist historical culture and in the public sphere through the first decade of the twenty-first century. Enemies and Friends: Russia, Germany, and Spanish Fascism (1917–41) From the Imagined Russian to the Real Russian (1917–41) Russia constituted an almost unknown land in the Spanish popular imaginary prior to the Revolution of 1917. There were a few exceptions stemming from diplomatic relations between Spain and the Tsarist empire during the first half of the nineteenth century, and more particularly from the literary impressions transmitted by the travel novelist Juan Valera in his Cartas desde Rusia (Letters from Russia) in 1857.20 Thirty years later, these sketches acquired dimension with the dissemination of what is now considered classic Russian literature from authors such as Lev Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky, along with an analysis of Russian society by the diplomat and historian Julián Juderías. Nevertheless, during the first two decades of the twentieth century, there were few direct mediators between Russia and the Spanish public sphere.21 Valera, Juderías and other authors reproduced the image based on the icon of alterity, backwardness and exoticism that characterized the empire of the Tsars in Western popular opinion during the final quarter of the nineteenth century: the pseudo-Asian, fanatic Russia, capable of unimaginable suffering. This neo-romantic vision of Eastern Europe, enhanced by a fascination with the exotic, was itself based on clichés forged by eighteenth-century French Enlightenment authors.\n\n14 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\nThe lasting stereotypes that they consolidated made Russia the realm of barbarians, in contrast with a civilized Europe.22 From the early 1920s on, Spanish travellers and visitors to the fledgling Soviet Union transmitted a different image: an exemplary vision of the new “homeland of the proletariat,” resurgent from the darkness. Nuances varied according to the ideological leanings of the travellers (socialists, communists, anarchists, or bourgeoisie), but almost all saw the USSR as the construction of a new world and an idealized, classless society. Soviet propaganda in Spanish, reports in the workers’ press, and radio broadcasts from 1933 on solidified the Soviet myth among much of the left wing.23 This representation contrasted with the iconic image crafted by the counter-revolutionary European right wing from 1917–18 on. It superimposed ideological rejection of communism on updated images of alterity, fanaticism, and exoticism, aided by the spread of Russian literature classics from Pushkin to Maxim Gorki. Though some translations had begun to circulate in Spanish magazines in the mid-nineteenth century, most Russian writers found their way into Spanish based on French editions from the 1910s and 1920s and enjoyed notable popularity. The generic terms of this icon of alterity meant that the Russian as such was absent from the Spanish public sphere. The typical White Russian refugees of the belle époque in Paris did not appear in Spain until the Civil War.24 The stereotype corresponded to a familiar typecasting: Soviet communism, in alliance with Freemasonry and Judaism, would destroy Western and Christian civilization, using God’s favourite nation – Spain – as a bridgehead. This discourse was updated with the advent of the Second Spanish Republic and spread more intensely after the end of 1935, when the anti-Republican right wing began accusing all Popular Front parties of having sold out for “Moscow gold.” Russia was identified with the USSR, the incarnation of Evil. It began with a deep resemanticization of the counter-revolutionary image of liberalism and the French Revolution, seasoned with conspiracy theories.25 By 1936, this icon was fully formed in Spanish fascism, which saw a fundamental continuity between the “oriental” essence of tsarist despotism and the materialist Russia that threatened to devour Western civilization.26 In a complementary manner, this image of Russia also corresponded to a national other. However, during the Spanish Civil War, the second function of this mobilizing myth – that of Russia as an adversary of the nation – reached an intensity superior to what had been its first function until then: to incarnate the Antichrist. This melded with the image of the enemy within and semantically reinforced its alterity.27\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nThe war nationalism of the insurgents in the 1936–9 Spanish conflict began dehumanizing the enemy via denationalization.28 Members of the other Spain had stopped being Spaniards by betraying the essences of the Homeland, disregarding tradition and national history, selling out to foreignizing ideologies. The traitors could thus be generically categorized as Spaniards infected with a foreign virus. The other was defined in moral patriotic and collective terms, but seldom as an explicit social group. The metaphor of Russians as communist foreigners reinforced the more general stigmatization of the enemy as Reds. Though several dozen Russian anti-communist volunteers, most of them arriving from France, joined forces with the insurgents,29 the term Russian became autonomously effective for bolstering the perception of the conflict as a war against an invader. The ambition of Russia, which “had dreamed of digging its bloody, emblematic sickle into this lovely piece of Europe,” had unleashed a war: “the communist and socialist masses of the earth, united with Freemasons and Jews” would use Spain as “a golden stepping-stone to global triumph.” The war thus became a new Reconquista, a reconquest like that of the Middle Ages.30 Though the Civil War had at first been described as an uprising to restore full Spanishness to a Republican regime that had surrendered to “Russian-type anarcho-communist ideals,” the involvement of the USSR transformed it in the eyes of Francoist propagandists into a war for national liberation. Spain represented nationalism resisting communism, a global conflict between “the vital reality of the nationalities” and an internationalist ideology. If it prevailed, the world would no longer be divided into nations.31 If proletariat internationalism turned into an invading power, all Spanish communists could be considered Russians. The features of this conversion were not described in ethno-cultural, but ideological terms.32 The Republican militia were frequently represented as rough men with Soviet military caps, and Republican loyalists as undercover Russian agents. “Russia” and “Russian” also served as perfect metaphors of all the collective vices that characterized the Republican side from the perspective of the insurgents: poverty, chaos, lack of patriotism, moral vacuity … In their most Catholic version, it simply was the realm of Satan.33 The “Russians,” however, lacked any specific physical features. Despite the substantial weaponry supplied by the USSR, no more than twenty-two hundred Soviet technicians, pilots, military consultants, and political police set foot on Spanish soil during the Civil War. There was little chance of actually meeting authentic Russians on the front, though insurgent propaganda depicted Republican prisoners with faces like Lenin as ­exponents of a “poor, decadent race” or as the “Mongol Cossack.”34 In\n\n16 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\ntheir letters, rebel soldiers quite often alluded to their adversaries as “Russians,”35 and the stereotype continued circulating into the early post-war years. Catholic writer José María Salaverría described the Russian as a “tavern thug,” made doubly undesirable by his impenetrable exoticism and innate deceitfulness, predetermined by the “complexity of his racial make-up, which frequently borders on savagery.” When word came of the invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the weekly paper Mundo reminded its readers that Spain already knew its adversary, “Russia, which personified its capacity for criminal induction and Satanic complicity.”36 Hitler, German Nazism, and Spanish Fascism (1930–41) Italian and German Echoes (1924–36) In the initial stages of Spanish fascism, the influence of National Socialism was meagre. The first groups drawn to fascism in Madrid and Barcelona in the 1920s were attracted by the shining image of Mussolini’s fascism after the March on Rome (October 1922), its removal of liberal political elites, and its mix of revolutionary appeal, avant-garde aesthetics, and charismatic leadership. The prolific intellectual Ernesto Giménez Caballero introduced fascism to the literary avant-garde in Spain after a trip to Rome in 1928. A common appeal to the classic heri­ tage of the Roman Empire also made Spanish fascists feel that they were part of a new resurgence of Catholic-infused Mediterranean Europe. Italy’s resurgence became a kind of Holy Grail that awoke in Spanish intellectuals the dream of antiliberal rebirth for the nation.37 However, the founders of the first fascist groups in the 1930s, Ramiro Ledesma and Onésimo Redondo, belonged to a younger generation. The rise of NSDAP in Germany from 1929 on decisively coloured their political views, and they were familiar with German language and culture. Ledesma spent four months in Heidelberg in 1930. A self-taught intellectual, he was influenced by the doctrines of Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, and Oswald Spengler. Redondo spent an academic year (1928–9) as Spanish reader at the High School of Commerce in Mannheim, dedicated to the analysis of the political strategies set in motion by German Catholicism. He regarded Hitler as a defender of Christianity against Marxism and advocated an alliance of Hitler with the Zentrum (Catholic Centre Pary) to confront German communism.38 From the first issue of his new weekly La Conquista del Estado (March 1931), Ledesma gave increasing attention to the trajectory of German National Socialism. Nonetheless, the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (JONS), which he founded in October that year, were heavily inspired\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nby Mussolini’s social corporativism. Redondo and his followers in Valladolid, where he had been publishing the weekly journal Libertad since June 1931, were also strongly influenced by the Italian corporativist model. Redondo’s group had a more Catholic imprint but voiced anti-Semitic slogans from the very beginning. The aggressive language and some of the metaphors they used clearly recalled the tone of Nazi journals such as Der Stürmer. However, the anti-Semitic content usually remained within the limits of Catholic anti-Jewish prejudice, which mainly found fault with the Jewish religion rather than the biological origins of Jews. Though the echoes from Rome resounded with greater strength in the ears of Spanish fascists, National Socialism came onstage as a spectacular model of national resurgence. It was grounded in Hitler’s hypnotizing charisma as a leader who had captured the heart of the people, as well as his ability to win votes and members from both extremes of the political spectrum.39 Fragments of Mein Kampf were first translated in the pages of Libertad, which was particularly interested in Nazi agitation strategies.40 From February 1933 on, admiration for Hitler spread across the entire Spanish anti-Republican right wing, from Catholics to monarchists. They saw the new German chancellor as the standard-bearer of a united anti-Marxist and nationalist front that transcended party lines. Ledesma considered Hitler a genius of political agitation and a pragmatic statesman, who had seized power with fewer concessions to the Church and the conservatives than Mussolini had made earlier.41 Spanish fascists most admired how national solidarity had been orchestrated around a charismatic leader, but they also envied Hitler’s boldness in imposing his political will over the constraints of international law. Germany’s rebirth shone as an example for a decadent Spain,42 and the first explicitly fascist Spanish weekly journal, El Fascio, appeared in Madrid in March 1933. The journal gathered around it a number of intellectuals and political activists from the radical right who saw the Nazi power grab as proof of the irresistible modernity of fascism.43 Nazi racism and “paganism” indeed posed a dilemma for some admirers of Hitler. While detaching themselves from biological antiSemitism, some attempted to elaborate a metaphysical theory of national-socialist racism by equating it with the cultural and historical foundation of nationality. This made it exportable to other countries.44 Spanish fascists claimed that Spanish people disliked the Jews and expressed their understanding of the German interpretation of a universal problem, which in Spain manifested itself simply as a confessional issue. Thus, they displayed a benevolent attitude towards the first segregationist measures adopted by the Nazi regime against the Jews.45\n\n18 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\nThe first Spanish parafascist and fascist travellers to Nazi Germany propagated similar views.46 The conservative writer and university professor Vicente Gay visited Germany in 1933. Though he mistrusted biological racism and expressed his preference for a “milder” authoritarianism, he also justified establishment of the first concentration camps as institutions to “re-educate” bad Germans.47 One year later, Falangist legal expert Juan Beneyto also advocated the need to “delimit” the influence of Jews and Catholics in public affairs as a strategy to “nationalize politics.” He saw the new Germany as a new dimension of European identity. The Nazi struggle to overcome “bourgeois” notions of a national state merged with the new idea of race that fed into a new meaning of the term “empire.”48 Other visitors to the Third Reich agreed on that point. Ramón de Rato was a student from a middle-class background who regarded National Socialism as a promising future for European youth, who were besieged by Marxism. Furthermore, the Spanish people were hardly qualified to make moral judgments on Nazi anti-­Semitism, because the “Jewish problem” had been absent from Spanish life since 1492.49 In any event, the Falangist journal Libertad insisted in 1934, the German Führer’s anti-communism redeemed his pagan errors: So far ... the Hitler regime has not won the confidence of the Christian Western world. Yet, all Catholics can at least concede with it that Bolshevic atheism and merciless barbarianism are diametrically opposed to Christ’s cause. Since we all agree that the reality of Hitler’s presence is a strong barrier against Communist hell: … Let us Catholics advocate the conversion of protestant or pagan National Socialism, but not its collapse!50\n\nFrom January 1933 on, most of the right-wing anti-Republican press was equally sympathetic towards Hitler. The monarchists, proto-fascists, and traditionalists who gathered around the journal Acción Española were good proof of it. German “national rebirth” and the modernity of Nazi mass performances also fascinated Spanish right-wing radicals. They admired how Nazism prioritized the national community over other values.51 Some members of Acción Española even subscribed to Nazi eugenics theories, but most had reservations about Nazi “paganism” and anti-capitalist rhetoric. They also disliked how the NSDAP had come to power through the ballot boxes; Spanish anti-Republicans preferred a military coup d’état.52 Nonetheless, most Spanish fascists still saw the Italian model as the most appropriate option for a Catholic country. Accordingly, the Falange Española (Spanish Phalanx) party (1933–6) devoted much more attention to Italy, and even France, than to Germany. The main Spanish fascist\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nleader from October 1933, José Antonio Primo de Rivera, was invited by the NSDAP to visit Germany in May 1934. He met briefly with some of its leaders, including Hitler himself and Alfred Rosenberg, who recalled the meeting in his diary two years later. The young Spanish fascist, “clever and clear-minded; Catholic, not clerical; nationalist, not dynastic,” had impressed him. However, Rosenberg also noted that “the young Primo de Rivera” had avoided any comment on the Jewish question.53 On his return to Spain, José Antonio Primo de Rivera was actually rather sceptical about National Socialism.54 However, other Spanish fascists also reversed their initial admiration for National Socialism after having visited Germany. The journalist Antonio Bermúdez-Cañete, who joined the JONS in 1931 and later abandoned the group, had been attracted by Hitler and embraced anti-Semitic tenets. After his time (from 1932 to January 1935) as press correspondent in Berlin, Bermúdez-Cañete ended up repudiating racism, atheism, and the “socialist” tendencies of National Socialism.55 Both the Falange and the combined FE-JONS party after merging with the JONS (February 1934) looked to Rome rather than to Berlin, especially when they needed external financing. The Falangist poet Federico de Urrutia worked as a journalist for the newspaper Informaciones, which had received subsidies from Berlin since 1934 to propagate anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi propaganda articles.56 Some German consulates also distributed Nazi leaflets and books in Spanish to local Falangist groups. Though strong links also existed between Falangist groups and local chapters of the NSDAP Foreign Organization branch,57 German diplomacy had little if any direct contact with the Falangist leaders. Reich diplomats in Spain were ignorant of the conspiracies to overthrow the government in the spring of 1936. Meanwhile, Mussolini was making generous donations of money and arms to the military conspiracy and several of the monarchic and traditionalist leaders involved in it. Fascinated by the Third Reich (1936–41) The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War marked a turning point in this story. It is well known that the military insurgents were able to deliver their demand for help directly to Hitler in Bayreuth by 25 July 1936. Germany first sent airplanes, military supplies, and an expeditionary corps: the Condor Legion, composed mainly of aviators and ground support personnel. Later on, Germany also provided financial and diplomatic support.58 The finest hour of Nazi influence on Spanish fascism was from 1937 to 1942, in tandem with increasing economic, cultural, and diplomatic cooperation between the “new” Spain and the Third Reich. For the Germans,\n\n20 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\nthe relationship was a strategic one. Hitler and his ministers hoped to include Spain in the economic frame of the New European Order, under German guidance. Culture and ideology played a minor, though not irrelevant, role in this, so exchanges increased. Dozens of Falangist leaders and party officials began travelling to Germany in 1937 to strengthen ties with the NSDAP. They used the Nazi Party press and propaganda, along with the youth and women’s sections as a model for the Frente de Juventudes (Youth Front) in 1940. The Spanish relief organization Auxilio Social (Social Aid) was also greatly inspired by the German Winterhilfe, and the Bund Deutscher Mädel became a template for enhancing their Female Section.59 Spanish visitors were usually fascinated by German welfare and social discipline, by the mass rallies, the new motorways, and everything related to technological progress. Their perceptions of German modernity resembled those of many British travellers at that time.60 Intellectual exchanges multiplied until 1944: German university towns became a common destination for Spanish academics, such as health experts who spent long periods in Berlin, Munich, or Vienna.61 The Nazi state attempted to increase its influence on Spanish public opinion by subsidizing daily newspapers and radio stations. Leaflets were distributed presenting Hitler as the saviour of Europe against Bolshevism and a modern Christian knight-protector of civilization.62 Strong links were forged with Francoist cultural institutions, such as the Instituto de Estudios Políticos (Institute of Political Studies, 1939), through which Nazi ideas on political theory, the social sciences, and, particularly, the philosophy of law could penetrate Spain. These measures had a lasting influence on several of the intellectuals who laid the theoretical foundations of the Francoist “New State.”63 Strategic cooperation and ideological agreement implied that a portion of the Francoist political and intellectual elite was in tune with the Third Reich. This did not necessarily entail full-fledged identification with German strategic interests, as most Falangists preferred full belligerency. For many supporters of Franco, Germanophile attitudes were not synonymous with National Socialism. Among portions of the Spanish social elites, the military, and the Catholic right there was deep-rooted sympathy for Germany, which could be traced back at least to the First World War. This was reinforced by the political admiration that most of them felt for Hitler, as well as their fascination with the Wehrmacht, but it was not without contradictions. In September 1939, many Falangists were shocked by the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and expressed their disapproval of the Nazi invasion of Catholic Poland.64 However, these reservations quickly vanished after the German conquest of France in June 1940. Fascination with the Wehrmacht infected\n\nIntroduction 21\n\nFalangists, the military, and even many anti-Falangist army officers, who longed to enter the war on the Axis side.65 Some traditionalists regarded Hitler as the gatekeeper of Christian European civilization against the communist threat. Thousands of “provisional” lieutenants and ensigns, those poorly trained NCOs who had fought in the Francoist army during the Civil War, shared similar views. Most of them adhered to basic values such as tradition, religion, and hierarchy.66 They admired Germany’s military might, which was now directed against France and Great Britain, the alleged “historical enemies” of Spain. Praise for National Socialism and Hitler multiplied in Falangist propaganda during the early 1940s. He was regarded as a brilliant soldier and a clairvoyant strategist. Anti-Semitic tones were not absent from that rhetoric.67 The Nazi propaganda machinery continued to fund newspapers, novels, and books. Radical Falangists sometimes approached the German consulates and institutions in search of recognition, while several Falangist groups adopted Nazi symbols and launched boycotts against British interests.68 One such group, the “Crusaders against Russia,” sent a long memorandum to the German ambassador in Madrid in July 1941, asking for Nazi help.69 As fervent nationalists, however, radical Falangists were reluctant to serve as instruments for German interests. Even those who approached the Third Reich in search of political support hardly dared question Franco´s leadership and insisted on preserving the Christian character of Spanish fascism. In fact, hardly any Spanish National Socialists in Spain in the early 1940s would go so far as to question the mainstream tenets of Catholic fascism. Their radicalized rejection of Jews was still confessional and traditional, but not biologically based. A few authors succumbed to the influence of German eugenics theories and managed to merge biopsychology with the tenets of Cesare Lombroso. Military psychiatrist Antonio Vallejo-Nágera, for example, tried to demonstrate the Semitic origins of the Spanish left and reconcile his sense of biological determinism with an overarching concept of Hispanidad – Spanishness – based on culture and religious confession.70 In 1939–40, there were many “ordinary Spaniards” from different social and political backgrounds who openly sympathized with the Third Reich. Dozens of them took it upon themselves to write to the German embassy in Madrid on the occasion of the Führer’s birthday (20 April) in 1940 and 1941. Several more letters arrived at the embassy after the German conquest of France. These moments coincided with Spanish declarations of non-belligerency and the Falangist offensive to increase its power within the regime. Many more letters were received after 22 June 1941, when the Wehrmacht invaded the Soviet Union. The senders\n\n22 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\nof these missives belonged to the middle and lower-middle classes: liberal professionals, civil servants, civilian employees, and bluecollar workers.71 Many of them were Civil War veterans of the Francoist army and had been victims of “Red Terror.” They saw Hitler as their avenging angel. Such expressions of pro-German enthusiasm suggest that German propaganda efforts found a sympathetic audience “from below,” and not only in radical Falangists.72 Certainly, the letters fit with the general climate of scepticism towards liberal democracy, the admiration for German power, and the confused expectations of authoritarian regeneration that spread across continental Europe during the second half of 1940.73 In non-belligerent Spain, this trend had its own particular flavour. Some were grateful for German support during the Spanish conflict. Others acknowledged that the Third Reich was about to defeat Spain’s main “historical enemies.” Still others regarded the German Führer as the architect of a European New Order that Spain would enrich with its Catholic imprint.74 Many also adhered to the fight against liberal democracy and “Judaism,” which they equated with international capitalism.75 “Popular” Spanish enthusiasm for Hitler climaxed at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, though the motivations of Germanophiles before and after 1941 scarcely changed. Spanish fascists ratified their earlier admiration for Hitler. Radical Falangists still expected that joining the German war effort would enable them to fulfil their aspirations of wielding full power within the regime. Catholics and some monarchists regarded the Wehrmacht as God’s instrument to slay the “reincarnation of Lucifer” (communism) and teach Britain a hard lesson. They also hoped that through this fight against the Antichrist, Nazi Germany would redeem itself from the original sin of its pagan nature. Once “the Beast” had been destroyed, the Third Reich would experience religious conversion.76 Carlist traditionalists, the most reluctant to accept Nazi atheism, also joined the pro-Germany fervour in hopes of “annihilating communism” alongside the rest of the “Christian world.”77 The world war represented a fight between democracy, as the cradle of communism, and the nations who understood their “historical destiny.”78 Unlike the Falangists, however, the Carlists insisted on their Germanophile stance during the Second World War but avoided reference to the charismatic leadership of Hitler, who was now merely regarded as the Kaiser’s heir.79\n\n2 Russia Is Guilty!\n\nExtermination and Brutalization: Operation Barbarossa and a Different Kind of War On 22 June 1941, 19 armoured divisions, 14 motorized divisions, and 119 infantry divisions of the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS, along with some Romanian troops, invaded the Soviet Union without warning. Altogether, 3,300,000 men, 3,325 armoured vehicles, 600,000 vehicles, and 625,000 horses participated in the Axis campaign. It began with strikingly different features from those of other fronts where the German Army was or had been engaged. Until then, on the Western Front and in Norway, North Africa, and part of the Balkans, the Wehrmacht had generally complied with the norms of the Geneva Convention. On the Eastern Front, however, the Third Reich unleashed a qualitatively different type of war against the communist world view, which it sought to eradicate by exterminating its defenders. It was a war against a people or a set of peoples – Russians, Slavs, and others – considered racially inferior based on biological postulates. After eliminating the “excess” portion of the population, the remainder would be reduced to semi-slavery and to provisioning the Third Reich with raw materials or food. Meanwhile the Jewish population, which had been shut into ghettos, would be killed en masse. After adoption of the “Final Solution” in January 1942, this involved systematic deportation to extermination camps.1 The armed units under direct Nazi command – the SS and the task forces or Einsatzgruppen – were not the only ones responsible for the extermination. The regular Wehrmacht forces also participated in this ethnic cleansing, and not always in a secondary capacity. In Berlin on 30 March 1941, Hitler himself had informed almost 250 Wehrmacht generals, the commanders of the troops committed to Operation Barbarossa,\n\n24 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\nof his war plans. These included the generals in command of the three Army Groups (Heeresgruppen) of the Ostheer (North, Centre, and South), the Luftwaffe groups, the commanders of the armoured corps and the Chiefs of the General Staff. Hitler explained his racial world view and revealed that the campaign would be one of extermination, as the “Bolshevik commissars and the communist intelligentsia” had to be eliminated. The Wehrmacht should not consider the Bolshevik as a “comrade, as was usual on other fronts.” This was a war of “two opposing world views” and would have a completely different nature.2 Most of the generals demonstrated conformity; though few were Nazis, they shared a demonized vision of Bolshevism and a cultural contempt for the Slavic peoples. Additionally, they saw that the conquest of the Eastern Empire – a vision they had cherished since the end of the nineteenth century – was finally within their reach.3 Hitler’s intentions were summed up shortly after in a series of instructions that were issued to the troops just prior to invasion, which a historiographer later dubbed as the “criminal orders.” They had originated in directives dictated by the Führer on 18 December 1940 – there were four in the final version – which were discussed on several occasions by the High Command of the Wehrmacht (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, OKW) and the High Command of the Army (Oberkommando des Heeres, OKH).4 These involved the following: 1. The regulation of Einsatzgruppen activity, or task forces under the SS and SD. This collaboration agreement was communicated to the troops on 28 April 1941. Based on their partnership since the conquest of Poland, the Einsatzgruppen were authorized to operate freely within the areas controlled by the Wehrmacht. These units carried out the execution of certain population groups, Jews in particular. They could act with complete autonomy, answering to the regular army only in matters of basic logistics (lodging and supplies). Operation Barbarossa constituted the final thrust towards the irreversible radicalization of anti-Semitic politics in the Third Reich. The large Jewish populations living in occupied territories led the Nazi leaders to ponder what was to be done about them. This became yet another stepping stone on the path that had been initiated in the spring of 1939. At that time, Hitler had authorized the annihilation of physically and mentally disabled people in the Reich, then approved “savage euthanasia” programmes. Tens of thousands of Polish civilians were executed, in a process that apparently culminated one year later with plans to exterminate the millions of Soviet citizens caught up in Operation Barbarossa. In July 1941, Hitler informed Reinhard Heydrich that the time had come for the definitive extermination of the Jews. These execution\n\nRussia Is Guilty! 25\n\norders involved the serious logistical challenge of killing tens of thousands of people efficiently. Therefore, a new step was taken. Several experiments were carried out with prisoners of war from September to December 1941. Camps and crematoriums were prepared, and transportation was organized to implement the objective of annihilating all the Jews in the European territory dominated by the Third Reich. Operations would begin in January 1942, involving a process of systematic deportation and murder that would utilize the camps designed specifically for this purpose, along with special extermination units in Soviet territory.5 As Operation Barbarossa was unleashed, the Einsatzgruppen corps, composed of some three thousand men distributed into four areas (A, B, C, and D) followed in the rearguard in order to identify, gather, and execute all Jewish males affiliated with the Soviet regime.6 Soon their objective expanded to include all Jews. The clear majority of Soviet Jews were killed during the first nine months of the war, before the extermination camp system became operative. The number of Einsatzgruppen victims was certainly no fewer than three hundred thousand people, along with another fifty thousand victims of the SS and Order Police (Ordnungspolizei). Added to these were the victims of the Wehrmacht units, local occupying authorities and auxiliary forces, Jewish war prisoners, thousands of Jewish civilians killed through starvation and disease in the ghettos, and more than 150,000 victims in the territory under Romanian control.7 To what degree did the soldiers of the Wehrmacht participate in the killing and mass deportation of the Jewish population in the East? All combatants knew that the ethnic community to which Nazism aspired excluded the Jewish people, and all were exposed to a constant barrage of propaganda equating communism with Judaism and Asian barbarism.8 Annihilation was therefore an option. This representation of reality took root among many soldiers. When combined with the state of war and brutalizing conditions, it paved the way for the transition from order to execution.9 There was close collaboration among German civil and economic administrations, the police, the SS, and Wehrmacht command.10 2. Prior to invasion of the USSR, German troops received the “Directives for Troop Conduct in Russia” (“Richtlinien für das Verhalten der Truppe in Russland”), from the OKW on 19 May 1941. These directives defined Bolshevism as “the mortal enemy of the German national socialist people,” thereby justifying “forceful and ruthless procedures” against “agitators, guerrillas, saboteurs and Bolshevik Jews” and “total elimination of all passive or active resistance.” In\n\n26 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\naddition to specifying who was to be eliminated (Jews, Communist Party members, partisans), these orders instructed German soldiers to treat prisoners of the Red Army ruthlessly: a portion of them were to be killed, and the rest were to be exploited to exhaustion. Such treatment of captives relaxed somewhat after May 1942, partly because of the growing need to utilize prisoners as a workforce for the Reich. By that time, Soviet prisoner deaths due to mistreatment, executions, malnourishment, and illnesses numbered between 1.6 and 1.9 million (out of 3.5–3.8 million total).11 3. The “Guidelines for the Treatment of Political Commissars” or “Commissar Order” (Kommissarbefehl), dated 8 June 1941, stated that Red Army commissars were to be “disposed of” immediately following their capture, after being separated from the rest of the prisoners. Such a procedure was justified by stating that these were members of the Communist Party: not just soldiers, but “central to the resistance,” leaders of an all-out war with no rules. The execution of commissars ended up being operationally counterproductive, but the order was only revoked on 6 May 1942, after several thousand commissars had been executed. By then, those who remained had lost influence in the Red Army and had become radicalized in their pugnacity, aware that they would receive no mercy from the Germans.12 4. The “Decree of the Führer regarding the Exercise of Military Jurisdiction in the Barbarossa Area,” dated 13 May 1941, was communicated orally to German officers, who were given freedom of action regarding partisans and civilians suspected of aiding them. Officers would judge whether the soldiers’ abuse of civilians endangered military discipline and punish them accordingly. To avoid pillaging, this order was not immediately communicated to the combatants; instead, it was disseminated hierarchically from the division command down to the lower units as they advanced into conquered territory.13 Just a few division generals, as well as Marshall Fedor von Bock, resisted complying with these orders.14 Throughout the campaign, the instructions were supplemented with orders enacted by the heads of the military corps. They painted a dehumanized and racially prejudiced image of the enemy, associated Judaism with Bolshevism, and urged the combatants to act without mercy. The Ostheer High Command, with a few exceptions, participated in the war of extermination, allowed others to do so, or turned a blind eye. The “criminal orders” significantly affected the ordinary soldiers. Propaganda directed at the troops communicated anti-Semitic and anti-Slavic leitmotifs; the trench journals habitually insisted on the need to annihilate the “Red subhumans” and clear Europe of Jews. German soldiers were not to forget\n\nRussia Is Guilty! 27\n\nthat they exemplified a superior race that aspired to dominion over other peoples.15 Four out of every five German soldiers fought on the Eastern Front from 1941 to 1944. It was the scene of a murderous war, both in its conception and execution. Adding to the brutality of battle were harsh physical conditions and the bitter resistance of the Red Army, which slowed and then halted German progress in October–November 1941, less than one hundred kilometres from Moscow. At this point, the invaders were faced with a new set of obstacles: an intolerably cold winter followed by snowmelt that turned roads to mud; the constant presence of partisans in the rearguard; and a war of positions that ended the comparative advantage that the Wehrmacht had hitherto enjoyed. They had concentrated firepower in small areas and made swift advances with motorized and armoured divisions, thereby surrounding their enemies. The brutal fighting conditions surpassed those experienced in 1914–18. The number of casualties from enemy fire, frostbite, and illness far surpassed anything the German Army had previously experienced. By the end of 1941, Wehrmacht reserves were considerably reduced. The brutalization of warfare was apparent in how the German soldiers treated civilians and resulted in a departure from military discipline. The intense Nazi indoctrination had made the soldiers particularly receptive to viewing the Slavic people as Untermenschen: subhumans.16 Two main positions exist in the recent historiographic debate on the subject. Some authors argue that the increasingly miserable combat conditions, the brutality of what had become a war of attrition, and the camaraderie among German soldiers decisively precipitated the spiral of increasing violence in the East. From this situationist perspective, the environmental conditions on the Eastern Front did greater damage than any ideological predisposition of the soldiers towards violence against civilians or dehumanization of the enemy. It led to cumulative radicalization of war violence in practice.17 For other authors, the deciding factor in the increasing radicalization of violent practices by regular Wehrmacht combatants was their perception of the conditions on the Eastern Front. As this perception had been conditioned by years of Nazi socialization and indoctrination, the soldiers were already relatively predisposed (compared to other national contingents) to dehumanizing their enemy based on biological-racial postulates and to treating both civilians and prisoners (Slavs or Jews) violently.18 Alternatively, some historians have suggested that combat units treated civilians and prisoners differently according to situational factors. Though not an exclusive pattern, brutality towards non-combatants tended to increase with more brutal combat conditions.19\n\n28 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\nAllies in the “European Crusade against Bolshevism” The troops participating in Operation Barbarossa were not exclusively German. Finnish and Romanian allies, motivated largely by territorial interests, provided no less than seven hundred thousand soldiers from the start of the campaign. The Finnish Army saw the German attack against the USSR as an opportunity to recover territory that had been lost to the Red Army in the Winter War of 1939–40. The Helsinki government sided with Hitler and declared war on the USSR on 25 June 1941. Finnish intervention was mainly restricted to the northern flank in the siege of Leningrad, which contributed to blocking off the city. This participation was presented as a second act (the “Continuation War”) to the Soviet aggression of 1939. For this reason, the Finnish Army exhibited no interest in advancing beyond their former border. Although the Helsinki government sent around three hundred thousand armed men to assist the Axis powers and made relevant logistical contributions in the Karelian region and in the siege of Leningrad, Finnish troops refrained from advancing into Soviet territory. In September 1944, following the siege of Leningrad, Finland signed its own peace accord with the USSR, renounced its claim to the territories lost in 1939–40, and assumed high reparation costs. Around eighty-four thousand Finnish soldiers and civilians lost their lives in this conflict; they were subsequently hailed as heroes.20 For the pro-fascist regime of Marshal Ion Antonescu in Romania, participation in Operation Barbarossa fit two objectives: reconquering the region of Bessarabia, which had previously been annexed by the USSR, and showing support for Hitler’s New Order. This would ensure a favourable disposition in Berlin to Romanian territorial claims against their neighbours, as the northern third of Transylvania had been surrendered to Hungary the prior year, and a part of Dobrogea to Bulgaria. The OKW was highly sceptical about an army with such outdated weaponry but needed Romanian cooperation to invade Ukraine. They chose to create a combined Army Corps to which Romania contributed over 325,000 soldiers. Its main role was to clear the rearguard following the advance of German motorized units. In the fall of 1941, Romanians conquered Odessa and annexed the region of Transnistria, between the Bug and Dniester Rivers, which was much larger than the territories of Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia. The Romanian army also was requisitioned for the offensive of the summer of 1942. In this way, the Antonescu regime tied its fate to that of the Third Reich. In the Battle of Stalingrad, the Soviets obliterated two Romanian armies stationed at the Don Front. From then until their capitulation in September 1944, Romanian troops were tasked with defensive efforts.21\n\nRussia Is Guilty! 29\n\nWithin a few days after Germany invaded the USSR, Hungary, Italy, and Slovakia began to demonstrate interest in dispatching troops to the East. Puppet states and allies of the Third Reich wanted to play their part in hopes of receiving territorial shares in the envisioned “reordering” of the Continent under German control. Helping to exterminate the common enemy provided fascist governments with support for their own imperialist or irredentist dreams. It also dissuaded neighbouring countries from attempting to reclaim territories at their expense.22 Mussolini was first; he had been preparing to participate from the moment he learned of the plans for invasion. In August, the Corpo di Spedizione Italiano in Russia entered combat in Ukraine. Originally consisting of 62,000 men and 82 planes, when reinforcements from the 8th Italian Army arrived at the Don Front, well equipped with light and heavy artillery, they numbered 229,000 men altogether.23 Slovakia, a satellite state, declared war on the USSR and sent nearly fifty thousand men to the Eastern Front, organized into two infantry divisions and one motorized brigade. Most of these men were removed at the end of July; those who remained were dispatched to the antipartisan fight in Byelorussia (today’s Belarus) or to a “mobile division” in Crimea.24 The puppet state of Croatia also dispatched to the East a symbolic contingent of five thousand soldiers. They were incorporated into the German 6th Army, which arrived at the front in late August 1941. Fear that Italy would be rewarded with territories in the Adriatic acted as a strong incentive for Croatia to demonstrate war merit. The authoritarian regime of Miklós Horthy in Hungary did not participate in the invasion, but it declared war on the USSR several days later. Horthy and the Hungarian fascists feared that the Antonescu regime would demand devolution of Northern Transylvania in reward for Romanian participation in the war effort. As many as 93,115 soldiers were dispatched to the Eastern Front in August 1941, but heavy losses in the first month led the OKW to send the Magyars to fight against the partisans instead. However, faced with the depletion of his reserves in early 1942, Hitler requested a larger deployment of Hungarian troops to reinforce his summer offensive. The Hungarian 2nd Army, composed of 210,000 soldiers, was deployed on the Don Front. Lacking adequate equipment and experienced officers, the Hungarians were crushed by a Soviet offensive in January 1943. Some forty thousand men lost their lives and sixty thousand more were captured. Though this decreased the confidence of the German command in their allies, it did not prevent them from dispatching ninety thousand more soldiers to the Eastern Front through August 1944. Magyar participation increased after the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944. The Hungarian\n\n30 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\n1st Army was deployed to defend its borders in April and May, and 950,000 Hungarian soldiers fought the Red Army in September 1944.25 Although German troops were always a majority in the invaders’ army during the Eastern campaign, allied troops of the “anti-Bolshevik” coalition contributed significantly, at times accounting for almost a fourth of total troops. In some sectors of the front corresponding to Army Groups Centre and South, non-Germans represented almost half of the men. In September 1942, the number of non-German invading soldiers reached 648,000. German troop in the Eastern forces ranged from 82.74 per cent in 1941, to 72.3 per cent in June 1942, to 88.55 per cent in July 1943, and 74.77 per cent in June 1944. The percentage of German combatants climbed to 95.7 per cent in January 1945, no longer joined by Hungarians or Romanians.26 Many officers of the Axis-allied armies were fiercely anti-Semitic and carried out their own ethnic cleansing projects. In mid-December 1941, the Romanian army began deporting and exterminating the Jewish population with the help of auxiliary Ukranian and German forces and Einzatsgruppe D. Several concentration camps were built for the Jews of mainland Romania, with victims numbering from 250,000 to 400,000. Since late 1942, Antonescu authorized the emigration of Romanian Jews to Palestine, but also sent thousands to work camps.27 Several Hungarian units also participated in executing Soviet Jews, though not systematically.28 European Volunteers against Bolshevism: Myth and Reality While Third Reich ally and satellite states contributed regular troops to the Eastern campaign, large numbers of foreign volunteers from Northern and Western Europe also joined the Axis forces. Nazi propagandists brandished defence of European civilization against “Asian” Bolshevism as their leitmotif in propaganda directed at fascist, ultranationalist, and anti-communist circles throughout Europe. They justified invasion of the USSR as a “preventative” measure against Stalin’s probable plan to conquer Europe. Foreign SS brigades and divisions were the object of much fascination and mythification in the post-war period. Neo-fascist propagandists and veterans have presented them as direct predecessors to NATO, as they were both “European” and “anti-communist.” In reality, the actual contribution and combat capacity of these foreign units varied greatly. Nazi Europeanism was rhetorical: the goal of continental unity was subordinated to the envisioned hegemony of the Third Reich. Though Hitler, Himmler, and the rest of the Nazi hierarchy pursued the primary objective of a German empire extending to the\n\nRussia Is Guilty! 31\n\nUrals, the Europeanist label served as a useful propagandistic tool for fostering goodwill outside of Germany.29 From the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels clearly saw the possibilities associated with anti-communist public opinion across the Continent.30 The war thus became, according to a proclamation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in late June 1941, a “European crusade against Bolshevism,” which included “allies, neutral countries, and even those who had recently crossed swords with Germany.”31 The New European Order program was developed in 1939–40 and accepted in political and intellectual circles sympathetic to the Third Reich. The “Anti-Komintern” pact, which was renewed in Berlin on 25 November 1941, presented the “anti-Bolshevik crusade” as a common endeavour from which a new Europe would emerge, united under German hegemony. Nazi Europeanist doctrines consisted mainly of generic ideas that the fascist intelligentsia adapted to their own world view. Using German slogans such as “living space” and “Christian West,” they reimagined the specific roles of their respective countries from diverse positions within this New Order.32 For many anti-communists, fascists, or fascistized conservatives across the Continent, participating in the invasion of the USSR presented an opportunity to cement their alliance with the Third Reich and gain greater influence within their own countries. This “crusade” also swayed many anti-communists who saw Hitler as an instrument for wiping out the Soviet threat, despite their distrust of Nazi atheism. Catholicism was a common trait among many European volunteers, along with the belief that communism had been created by Jews, freemasons, and inferior peoples. Individual and collective enlistment first surprised the OKW and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 30 June 1941, several representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the OKW, the NSDAP, and the SS met in Berlin. They agreed that it was politically beneficial to accept these volunteers. At first, they were given German uniforms and placed within national units. However, a clear ethnonational hierarchy was established. Beginning in 1940, Nordic and other “Germanic” volunteers (such as the Dutch and Flemish) were incorporated into the Waffen-SS – the SS armed units (Schutzstaffel or assault brigades) under Heinrich Himmler.33 Spanish and Croatian volunteers were placed into homogenous units in the Wehrmacht. French and Walloon volunteers were more challenging to resolve, but Czech, “White” Russian, and non-Russian USSR volunteers were refused. One week later, the OKW established some guidelines for the formation of foreign volunteer units.34 Following the stabilization of the Eastern Front, mobilization stemming from the “European crusade against Bolshevism” allowed the\n\n32 The Spanish Blue Division on the Eastern Front\n\nThird Reich to recruit soldiers from almost all occupied or neutral European states. Their slogans continued to exalt the defence of European civilization against “Asian” communism, and on a second tier, against Judaism as a threat to European nations.35 Hundreds of volunteers were recruited for the Russian Front, under the control of national fascist parties and even the regular army in some cases.36 The Legion of French Volunteers (LVF) drew its recruits from sympathizers and members of the main fascist and collaborationist parties. This unit never exceeded four thousand men; it was only used in late November 1941 for some frontline fighting, and then moved to the antipartisan fight. Walloon volunteers were mostly sourced from the autochthonous Rexist Party, a fascist and Catholic movement led by Léon Degrelle. The 373rd Walloon Infantry Battalion initially numbered barely a thousand and entered combat as part of Army Group South. By September 1941, a total of twentyfour thousand French, Spanish, Walloon, and Croatian volunteers had joined the Ostheer forces. Over 70 per cent of them were Iberian. Twelve thousand more volunteers originating from “Germanic” peoples were assigned to the ranks of the SS. By April 1940, Himmler had received permission to create the multinational SS Wiking Division. A total of 1,564 Germanic volunteers in this division were organized into the Nordland (Nordic countries) and Westland (Flemish and Dutch) regiments. Beginning in 1940, several dozen Finnish volunteers were also incorporated into the SS Das Reich Division. These modest contingents numbered far fewer than Nazi leaders had expected. In June 1941, the SS Reichsführer set the Waffen-SS European expansion project in motion. Himmler’s model also incorporated political indoctrination, by which the soldiers became propaganda agents for the New Order upon returning to their countries. As a result, the influx of Germanic volunteers increased notably but never drastically. There were two recruitment paths: one by which certain groups were directly conscripted into the Waffen-SS, and another by which combatants were drafted into national legions under the SS umbrella. Collaborationist parties from occupied territories were more prominent in the latter group. This gave rise to the Dutch, Flemish, Norwegian, and Danish legions. By the end of 1941, 4,814 Dutchmen, 2,399 Danes, 1,882 Norwegians, 1,571 Flemish, 1,180 Finns, 39 Swedes, and 135 Swiss and Liechtensteiners had been included in the Waffen-SS, along with 6,200 ethnic Germans recruited from Eastern and Central Europe, Luxembourg, AlsaceLorraine, and Denmark. Until September 1943, preference was shown for “Germanics” and Scandinavians. By the end of 1941, over thirty-six thousand foreign volunteers from around Europe had enlisted in the Wehrmacht and\n\nRussia Is Guilty! 33\n\nWaffen-SS, not counting ethnic Germans. This was not a large contribution in military terms, amounting to barely 1 per cent of troops stationed on the Eastern Front. Germanic and especially ethnic German volunteers (Volksdeutsche) increased in 1942 and 1943. The Waffen-SS had recruited 27,314 combatants from Western and Northern Europe by late 1943.37 Through May 1944, Dutch troops numbered between 20,000 and 23,000, along with 10,000 Flemish and almost 6,000 Danish and 6,000 Norwegian recruits. Italians within the Waffen-SS numbered over 15,000.38 While they certainly never constituted more than 10–12 per cent of the total corps, estimates vary regarding the global contingent of volunteers from Western and Northern Europe who fought in the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS during the war. Including Spaniards, who comprised more than 40 per cent of the volunteers, the total number could be situated at around 115,000 men. This represented 1.15 per cent of total invading soldiers between 1941 and 1945. However, one estimate states that up to 400,000 of the 900,000 soldiers composing the Waffen-SS contingent were foreigners, separated into two categories: around 200,000 “ethnic Germans,” and volunteers from Western and Northern Europe (61,000 as of January 1944) along with Eastern and Balkan Europe, the Caucasus, and other non-Russian areas of the Soviet Union.39 The operational efficiency of the new “crusaders” was questionable. They were all under surveillance to impede desertion or espionage. The Germans often imposed restrictive medical exams and attempted to “Germanize” their command as much as possible. Political rivalries among different fascist and collaborationist factions also chipped away at the internal cohesion of some volunteer corps. Adventurers, military men motivated by nationalism and anti-communism, and fascist fanatics all coexisted within these units. Transylvanian Germans, for one, were attracted by the idea of good salaries, anti-communism, and being members of an elite corps.40 Himmler gained the control of the foreign volunteer units in mid1943, with the intention of turning the Waffen-SS into a pan-Germanic army.41 Several regiments were reconverted into units with pompous names that had little to do with their actual numbers.42 Volunteer SS formations, or legions, of Danes, Norwegians, Dutchmen, and Flemish soldiers thus became part of a “Germanic” Panzer Corps and were divided accordingly into the Panzergrenadier-Division Nordland (Danes and Norwegians), the SS-Brigade Nederland – which became the 34th SS Landstorm Division after February 1945 – and the Langemarck "
