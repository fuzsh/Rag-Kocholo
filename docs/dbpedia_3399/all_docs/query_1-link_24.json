        "text": "Katie Elizabeth Wiedemann Memoriam\n\nOur Angel Katie Elizabeth Wiedemann 7/18/07 to 9/23/07 You never said I’m leaving, you never said goodbye. You were gone before I knew it, and only God knew why. A million times we needed you, a million times we cried. If love alone could have saved you, you never would have died. In life we loved you dearly, in death we love you still. In our hearts you hold a place that no one could ever fill. It broke our hearts to lose you, but you didn’t go alone. For part of me went with you, the day God took you home. Love, Mommy, Grandma & Grandpa Harries, Aunts Becky, Abby & Alysa, Uncles Fred, Nick, Todd, Matt & Tommy"
