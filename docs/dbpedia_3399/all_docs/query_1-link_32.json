        "text": "Franz Rudolph Wiedemann OBITUARY\n\nDr. Franz Rudolph Wiedemann died at the age of 81 on Tuesday, December 20th, at home following a brief illness. Franz leaves his loving wife of 58 years, Alice Trone Wiedemann; his daughter, Melissa Spiers; his son, Andrew Wiedemann; three grandchildren, Tomas Spiers, Andrew Spiers, and Olivia Wiedemann; and many close friends. Franz was born in Hollywood, CA, the son of Rudolph and Elizabeth Wiedemann. A proud 1958 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, he served honorably until his resignation as Lieutenant Commander in 1967. After a brief career in real estate development in Dallas, TX, Franz relocated to Chadds Ford, PA with his family and enrolled at Temple Dental School, graduating in 1980. For over 25 years, his practice thrived and he enjoyed serving the South Eastern Pennsylvania community. Franz’s greatest passion was his family but he was an accomplished sailor and supporter of the Brandywine Conservancy. Franz will be inurned at the United States Naval Academy Columbarium on January 6th, 2017 following a 10:30 AM service at the United States Naval Academy Chapel. In lieu of flowers, the family requests a donation be made in Franz’s name to Neighborhood Hospice (610) 696-6511, or the Brandywine Conservancy (610) 388-2700."
