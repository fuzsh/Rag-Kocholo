Plans are prepared for the extension of the brewery back to the alley and also for the erection of a large stable, all of which will be done during the coming spring.\n\n*********************************************\n\nCincinnati Enquirer, 23 May 1908, page 10\n\nMr. Charles Wiedemann and bride, nee Miss Mellinger of Covington, returned yesterday from an enjoyable honeymoon spent in the East.
