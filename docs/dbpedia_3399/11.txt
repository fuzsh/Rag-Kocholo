Mr. Charles Wiedeman, the well-known brewer will commence the erection of a magnificent residence in Cote Brilliant in a few weeks.

It will be composed of pressed brick with red stone trimmings, and it promises to be one of the finest house in this section of the State. It will be remembered that the father of the present builder started the erection of a residence on the same spot several years ago and had built the foundation, when a strike originated among the workmen which caused him to cease further work thereon.

It is also the intention of the Wiedemanns to make extensive additions to their present immense brewery plant on Columbia street. Plans are prepared for the extension of the brewery back to the alley and also for the erection of a large stable, all of which will be done during the coming spring.
