        "text": "As a muslim I had a crazy experience at a waffle house. I was asking if they had some thing other than pork that could go with the waffle. They asked me if ham would work.They threatened to call the store owner because I asked if the pork sausage that comes with a Waffle could be replaced with an egg instead. They said it was impossible. They said it was waffle House policy. When I explained, I’ve eaten @ many waffle houses before, they said, if that’s true, how come you took so long to order? I left and went to a Waffle house 4.2 miles down the road. I decided do a social experiment at the next waffle house and ask for the same exact things.They gave me my order as I asked for it without question. The only difference between the two waffle houses was the second place had an all black staff. The first location had an all white staff. I am an Arab female & was there with my 3 girls. I felt like I had a clear example of prejudice on my visit to Lagrange."
