        "text": "Come experience the Village of La Grange, located approximately 13 miles west of downtown Chicago in western Cook County. Parts of this vibrant town are registered as National Historic Districts, with much late 19th century and early 20th century real estate. Retail and commercial business in its walkable downtown area dating back to the 1890s. Find retailers are excited to warmly welcome you to shop, dine or explore. Sidewalks are lined with specialty boutiques, coffee shops, and a wide range of dining options.\n\nLa Grange, IL 60525 is situated east of Hinsdale and Naperville, north of Willow Springs and Countryside, south of Western Springs and Brookfield, and west of Lyons and McCook.\n\nCrowds first started coming to La Grange as the city became too cramped and overpopulated. Today it’s just a few convenient Metra stops from Chicago’s Loop along the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad.\n\nOriginally named Hazel Glen, the town was originally considered a ‘milk stop’ on trains bound for greater Illinois. Franklin D. Cossitt saw only possibilities for the village and renamed La Grange after his childhood hometown of La Grange, Tennessee, when it was incorporated in 1879. Cossitt set out to create a utopian society and laid out streets, planted trees, and donated several hundred acres to churches and schools. He also placed liquor restrictions on the land deeds he sold to prevent La Grange from becoming a “saloon town.”\n\nLa Grange saw a significant population jump in the decades after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The easy commute into the city made it convenient for businessmen to live there.\n\nDowntown La Grange today is fun for all ages. Its proximity to the train station and expressways welcomes even more residents and visitors. The historic La Grange Movie Theater at 80 South La Grange Rd has been packing them in for more than 80 years. Originally opened as a live theater in 1925, today it has 4 screens offering Hollywood blockbusters, art-house features, and family-fun entertainment. You can take in its charm and history with self-guided walking tours hosted by the La Grange Historical Society, including a walking tour of Frank Lloyd Wright homes in the Village. La Grange is also known for their many other yearly celebrations, including its annual Pet Parade that began in 1947. Other yearly celebrations include Endless Summerfest, Halloween Walk, Hometown Holidays La Grange, and the La Grange Farmer’s Market.\n\nEven though La Grange is only a little over 2.5 square miles, it has 78.5 acres that let you escape into nature. Denning Park features 10 acres of playground, walking and jogging path, a community garden, and more. Sedgwick Park offers more than 20 acres including 2 basketball courts, 4 baseball fields and 3 soccer fields. And Gordon Park has 17 acres of accessibility to nature with a picnic shelter, playground, splash pad, 3 handball courts, fitness stations, butterfly garden, skate spot and much more. Make sure you check out the other parks and activities the La Grange Park District provides, too.\n\nCome see what La Grange has to offer and discover why La Grange is called “everyone’s downtown.”"
