Subsequently, in an act of June 9, 1825 the General Assembly provided that the land ceded by the treaty be divided into five numbered sections, surveyed into districts and land lots, and distributed by land lottery. On Dec. 14, 1826, the legislature redesignated the five land sections as the counties of Lee, Muscogee, Troup, Coweta, and Carroll and provided for their organization\n\nDespite the fact that the five counties were not named until Dec. 14, 1826, the date their respective boundaries were established -- June 9, 1825 -- is generally accepted as the date of their creation. Because the five counties were provided for in the same act, their order of creation is based on the order they were mentioned in the act -- Lee, Muscogee, Troup, Coweta, and Carroll. Thus, Lee was Georgia's 61st county, while Troup was 63rd. Troup County was named for George M. Troup, who was governor of Georgia at the time of the county's creation.\n\nOn Dec. 14, 1827, the legislature formed Meriwether County from the eastern half of Troup County and Harris County from portions of southern Troup County.\n\n[Source: Carl Vinson Institute of Government]\n\nThis county is available for adoption\n\nIf you would like to find out more about hosting or helping with a Georgia Genealogy Trails county, or any other county within the United States, please visit our Volunteer Information Page\n\nSubmit Data\n\nSubmit Obituary\n\nJoin Mailing List\n\nThis website and its contents in the format presented, except where otherwise noted on the page, are copyrighted by Genealogy Trails and may not be copied, altered, converted nor uploaded to any electronic system or BBS, nor linked from any \"pay-for-view\" site, linked in such a manner as to appear to be part of another site including \"frame\" capturing, nor included in any software collection or print collection of any type without the express written permission of the author of this site.\n\nInformation is furnished for the free use of researchers who are interested for the purpose of researching their family histories and genealogies.
