A part was set off to Harris in 1827, and a part to Heard in 1830. It was named for Hon. George M. Troup, who was born at Macintosh’s Bluff on the Tombigbee, in what was at that time a part of Georgia, but is now within the limits of the .’State of Alabama. He attended school in McIntosh County, Georgia, -and then in Savannah, later still at a celebrated academy on Long Island, New York, was graduated at Princeton College, New Jersey, and re- ‘ Turning to Savannah studied law in that city. He held many important offices, viz. : in the legislature, in Congress as representative and senator, and as governor of Georgia. It was in this latter capacity that he successfully maintained the rights and honor of Georgia in a controversy with the general government concerning the Creek lands.\n\nTroup county is bounded on the north by Coweta county, and on the northwest by Heard, on the east by Meriwether, on the south by Harris, and on the west by the State of Alabama. The Chattahoochee river, entering the county on the northwest, flows toward its southwest corner, from which point it becomes the boundary line between Alabama and Georgia. There are also numerous creeks, tributaries of the Chattahoochee, among the chief of which are Yellow Jacket and Wehadka.\n\nThe land is rolling, well-watered and productive, embracing the varieties of soil peculiar to most of the counties of the Middle Georgia belt. With proper tillage much of it will yield to the acre: corn, 15 bushels; oats, 20; wheat, from 10 to 15 bushels; rye, 12 bushels; barley, 20 bushels; Irish potatoes, 100, and sweet potatoes, 125 bushels; field-peas, 20 bushels; ground-peas, 25 bushels; seed cotton, 1,000 pounds; hay made from bermuda or crab-grass, or clover, 3,000 pounds; corn fodder, 300 pounds; shredded corn, 3,000 pounds; sorghum forage, about the same; sorghum syrup, 200 gallons. The red lands of the county are fertile, producing, besides all the crops named above, a great variety of garden vegetables. Melons and berries are plentiful and of the best quality. Luscious grapes are raised for home consumption.\n\nThe lands are also adapted to each-growing and to pews, plums and cherries. Considerable attention is paid to the improvement of the breeds of cattle, both for the dairy and for beef. Nearly one-fourth of the cows belong to the higher grades. In 1890 Troup county had 5,077 cattle, of which 196 were working oxen and 2,306 were milk-cows, producing 695,265 gallons of milk, from which were made 224,192 pounds of but- tor. The domestic fowls numbered 70,773, and produced, 162,055 dozens of eggs. From the bee-hives were collected 20,539 pounds of honey. The county had 879 horses, 2,152 mules, 4 donkeys, and 8,526 swine. There were 223 sheep yielding 462 pounds of wool. There is excellent timber available for manufacturing purposes, such as yellow pine, oak, maple, hickory, sweet-gum, poplar, etc.\n\nLaGrange, the county site, is a growing city seventy-one miles southwest of Atlanta, The LaGrange district, which includes the city, contains 6,297 inhabitants, and in the corporate limits the city has a population of 4,274. At a height of 850 feet above sea level and with a natural drainage that insures freedom from malaria, LaGrange enjoys an excellent reputation for healthfulness. Beautiful flower gardens are found in all portions of the city, among the most noted being “The Terraces” or Ferrell Garden, at its western limit. The streets are wide and beautifully shaded with water oaks and elms. It is a place of great culture and refinement, the seat of two noted colleges for ladies; the Southern Female (Baptist) College and the LaGrange Female College, owned by the North Georgia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South; also of the Park High school for boys, and several other private schools.

Other manufactories are: a cotton oil-mill, of large capacity, a ginnery, a guano factory, a foundry and machine shop, two planing-mills and variety workshops, two buggy and wagon factories, a grist-mill and a successful creamery and cheese factory. Through the work of the creamery there are now (1901) more than 300 Jersey cows in the vicinity of LaGrange. More than fifty farmers furnish milk to this creamery and some of them make as much as $165.00 a month. The butter from this creamery took the World’s Fair prize at the Paris exposition of 1900, and won the Biltmore ‘prize at the dairy exposition held the same year in Atlanta.\n\nSurrounding LaGrange are many elegant suburban homes, stock farms, dairy farms, orchards and vineyards. The farms are well supplied with wood and water. Bermuda grass furnishes pasturage for nine months of the year, and on some of the farms yields from three to six tons to the acre.

About six or eight miles west of LaGrange, on the west bank of the Chattahoochee river, where the Wehadka creek empties into that stream, there once stood a village belonging to the Muscogee, a tribe of the Creek Indians. This was the meeting point where the marauding parties met to plan some murderous foray upon the unprotected settlers of the frontier. It was after one of these predatory excursions that the warriors of the nation had assembled to celebrate the Green Corn Dance preparatory to another bloody raid.\n\nA few hundred men. under the command of Major Adams, who had volunteered to strike a blow at the savages, had arrived one evening in 1793. within a few miles of the river. While they were in waiting for night, so that under cover of the darkness, they might surprise the enemy, Major Adams, accompanied by a private soldier named Hill, started to swim the Chattahoochee in order to reconnoiter the position of the enemy. Hill, who came near being drowned, was rescued by the Major, who then, after encountering many perils, gained the desired information and returned to his command. Leading his men across the river at a favorable point, he completely surprised the Indians, of whom scarcely a warrior escaped. As far as possible the women and children were spared. The Indian town was completely destroyed. For many years posts still standing in the midst of the saplings that had grown up among the ruins pointed out to the traveler the place where formerly stood the Burnt Village.\n\nSource: Georgia, Agriculture, Industries Georgia, Historical and Industrial By Obediah B., Stevens, Georgia Dept. of Agriculture, Robert F.
