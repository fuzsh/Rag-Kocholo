        "text": "Our community is in motion and gaining momentum–returning to the independent spirit of our founders, our commitment to hard work and our unique location in the South. Troup County is home to more Fortune 500 regional sites per capita than anywhere in the United States including:\n\nWal-Mart Distribution Center\n\nDuracell\n\nUPS Distribution Center\n\nCaterpillar\n\nDow Jones/Wall Street Journal\n\nKimberly-Clark Corporation\n\nIllinois Tool Works\n\nServicemaster/American Home Shield\n\nCompanies from Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom have brought their unique cultures to blend with our southern roots. From Korean pears to Korean restaurants to other Korean-owned businesses and cultural arts, Kia’s decision to locate its first North American plant in Troup County has had a tremendous influence on Troup County. The Korean automaker produces three top-selling models at its $1-billion manufacturing plant. Employing more than 3,000 associates at the plant plus creating thousands of additional jobs at local suppliers, the investment of Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia, Inc. has created more than 15,000 regional jobs.\n\nWhile Troup County is making waves on the international scene, we have not lost our focus on the community’s overall quality of life. You can see it everywhere. In the urban fabric of our growing downtowns. On the tree-lined streets of historic neighborhoods and arts districts that help foster our hospitality and creativity. On the smiles of a crowd at our sporting events. And in our diverse economy that is among the fastest growing in the region.\n\nWhat do a giraffe, Andy Warhol, and a yurt have in common? Troup County, Georgia! Animals abound at the local Wild Animal Safari, one of the areas greatest tourist attractions. More than 3.5 million visitors stroll through the gardens of Hills & Dales estate, dig for archaeological artifacts at Explorations in Antiquity, camp out in yurts and catch a wave on West Point Lake. The lake is a 26,000-acre reservoir with 525 miles of shoreline. Known for its large-mouth bass, West Point Lake was home to the 2011 and 2013 Bassmaster Elite Series that were attended by more than 14,000 fans each year.\n\nVisual and performing arts also abound. The community boasts its own symphony, ballet, theatre companies, history museum, and art museum. There are more Andy Warhol collectors in LaGrange than in any other community its size!\n\nOur lives revolve around our rich cultural offerings, our extensive educational opportunities, our food and the simple abundance of our stunning landscape, rich with natural resources and wonder. Troup County is at the crossroads of all that is dynamic about the modern South."
