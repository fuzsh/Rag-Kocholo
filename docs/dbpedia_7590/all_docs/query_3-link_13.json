        "text": "Hello, I am John Black, Mayor of La Grange. Welcome to the website for the City of La Grange!\n\nLa Grange has been my home my entire life and I am proud of our city.\n\nLa Grange is a relaxed, suburban community located 20 minutes northeast of Louisville, Kentucky. We are the county seat of Oldham County. We are also easy trek from Cincinnati. We like to say La Grange and Oldham County is where Louisville and Cincinnati meet.\n\n​La Grange is known for trains. A unique feature of our town is the CSX rail line. La Grange is one of only a few communities in the United States with a rail track running through the heart of the city business district. People come from all over to enjoy watching close-up the 25 or so trains which move each day through our city. Please visit our downtown and train museum.\n\nAs your Mayor, I am committed to making this City the safest, cleanest, kindest, vibrant, and most welcoming place to call your home. I want the children and families of this community to always remember and cherish the memories of growing up in a small town.\n\nAs we continue to recruit and tout our city as a great place to live, work & play, our goal is to ensure that all of those who frequent our downtown will have an enjoyable time. Springs Park has been a great addition to our downtown area. The Farmer’s Market Pavilion has been busy with traffic and events. The splash pad has brought fun for the youth in the community. A 7500 sq ft skate park will soon join that addition.\n\nWe are also ‘Open for Business’, retail and commercial. Oldham Reserve will be home to a 90,000 sq ft facility known as Trilogy Health Care. This state-of-the-art facility with offer three different levels of assisted living care. This will also bring many opportunities for those seeking employment.\n\nI believe our town is where one can escape and enjoy the good life!\n\nI am always available to meet with citizens or visitors. I can be reached at city hall, or by phone 502-376-6799 or by email [email protected]\n\nCrossroads La Grange Streaming Radio\n\nStreaming Radio Station Goes LIVE in La Grange, KY!\n\nThe classic hits that have recently flooded the airwaves in Oldham County are all thanks to Chris McGill, who knows a thing or two about broadcasting. The streaming radio station is believed to be the first of its kind in Oldham County.\n\n“I wanted to bring something to the city that would let people know what’s going on around their own neighborhood and backyard so that’s the whole reason behind this,” McGill said. “I want this to be the place people go to find out what’s happening in La Grange and all of Oldham County.”"
