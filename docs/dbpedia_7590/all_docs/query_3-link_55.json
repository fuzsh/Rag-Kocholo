        "text": "First PlattingâSurface and DescriptionâThe County Seat QuestionâEarly ResidentsâEarly Business InterestsâIndustrial Enterprisesâ\n\nLaGrange Thirty-Seven Years AgoâCemetery HistoryâMunicipal AffairsâThe Post officeâBusiness of Today.\n\nThe Town of LaGrange is the county seat of LaGrange County; is situated in the geographical center of the county in sections 19 and 30, of Congressional Township 37, range 10 east. The land on which the original plat was executed was purchased from the Government at the land office at Fort Wayne, in 1835. by George F. Whittaker and Theodore Craft. Later Joshua T. Hobbs purchased an interest, and thus became one of the first proprietors of the townsite. It was platted June 18. 1836. by Reuben J. Dawson. William F. Beavers, George F. Whittaker and James McConnell. all deceased more than a third of a century ago.\n\nThe original town was laid off into lots 66 by 132 feet, with a public square 132 by 280 feet, streets 66 feet in width, and alleys 16 1/2 feet wide, crossing each other at right angles, the names of the streets being Mountain, High, Detroit, Poplar, Walnut. Sycamore and Canal, running north and south; Lake, Steuben, Factory. Michigan. Spring. Lafayette and Wayne, running east and west. Detroit has always remained the main business street. The town site proprietors donated the county several lots, including the present public square, the same to hold so long as they were used for public purposes. One provision was \"The proprietors reserve the right to divert the stream of water which passes through the town, to any place not to exceed one-fourth of a mile from its natural channel, for the use of mills and other machinery.\"\n\nThe townsite was covered with a dense forest, thick underbrush and prickly ash, interspersed with shrubbery and briars. The county commissioners were not wise in one of their official acts, in that they let the contract to Shadrack Carney to cut down all of the stately trees on the public square, thus depriving the ground of any beautiful shade trees which had to be grown from artificial trees set out years later.\n\nTo the south and east of the present public square, there was a swamp and it took years of work and many hundreds of loads of earth with which to fill this low ground up to its present level.\n\nThe first two dwellings erected in the new county seat town were by Isaac P. Grannis and Thomas Clark. The latter lived with his family in one of these houses, while the other was used as a tavern or boarding house, in which to keep the contractors on the courthouse. The first frame structure was a warehouse built by William Wigton, on the north-east corner of Detroit and Springs streets, where now stands the National Bank. It was also soon occupied by C. B. Holmes as a general store. Here was kept the first postoffice with C. B. Holmes as postmaster No. 1. The receipts of this postoffice for the first quarter was $1.08, in contrast with the receipts of the present postoffice for the last quarter ending October 1, 1919, which amounted to S2.136.67. During that very year so wild was the country and so plentiful the game, that Ans Clark killed seven deer in one day in gunshot sound of the public square then being cleared from the huge forest wilderness.\n\nThe erection of the first county buildings has been treated in the chapter on County Organization and Government, hence is not further noted in this connection.\n\nFollowing in the wake of the two pioneers who built the two log cabins here, came in other settlers, hearing of the location of a county seat to be developed. The first frame houses were built by Georjje Hopkins and Peter H. Fox. Hopkins was a carpenter by trade and immigrated here from Medina County, Ohio. Robert McClasky and family came from Ohio in 1843. He was the first boot and shoemaker in LaGrange. He built the third log house. In 1844 the county offices were moved from Lima, the former seat of justice. The Medical Chapter tells of the early physiciansâsee index. Also the general chapters (banking) give the history of early and present banking.\n\nThe second mercantile business was established in 1843 Herman B. McCoy and William S. Boyd, in the old Boyd Building. In the spring of 1846. McCoy and James B. Caldwell started a tannery, made leather and manufactured many excellent harness. This was the first industry of the kind in LaGrange.\n\nThe early mills were the saw mill constructed by D. Martin in 1844, and the same stream of water propelled the flouring mill, started in 1856-57 by William S. Boyd and John Starr.\n\nEarly Business Houses\n\nThe first regular drug store was established by Rensselaer Rheubottom in 1852, in a small frame building near the Boyd Block. Drs. John H. Rerick and Howard M. Betts engaged in the drug business in i860. Dr. Rerick sold out to Dr. Betts in 1861, and entered the Union army, that being the beginning of the Civil war. The drug business was continued by Betts in the old American House building, erected in 1855. by John Will. In 1855 was opened the first tin-shop in LaGrange, with Perry S. Hemminger as proprietor. Jones & Hemminger opened the first hardware store in the village in 1857. C, B. Holmes was the first grocer. It was in 1844 that Andrew Emminger came here and established a chair factory. The first banking was provided for here in 1872âsee Banking chapter. The oldest secret society lodge in LaGrange was the Masonic, in 1852.\n\nThe Commercial Interests in 1882\n\nIn 1881-82 LaGrange had seven dry goods stores, one millinery store, with fancy goods, three millinery and dress-making shops, two tailor shops, five grocery stores, four boot and shoe stores, six drug stores, one stationery and periodical store, three hardware stores, three butcher shops, three saddlery and harness shops, two banks, twelve lawyers, thirteen physicians, three newspapers, two jewelry stores, two dental offices, two photographers, one music store, three sewing machine offices, three barber shops, four restaurants, three flour and feed stores, three hotels, three saloons, three liveries, two farm implement dealers, two marble shops, five blacksmith shops, two express offices, one patent medicine manufactory, one gunsmith, two grain warehouses, two steam saw mills, one steam flouring mill, two planing mills, three wagon shops, one carriage factory, one pump factory, a large cheese factory.\n\nComing down to today, let it be said that with the changes of a quarter of a century, many of the above named industries have gone down or moved to other parts of the country. The town is now in possession of but few industries, aside from its mills and elevators; its creamery and its new factory in which store fixtures and show cases are to be made in large quantities by a recently incorporated stock company.\n\nThe foundry and machine business, once lively shops, have long ago ceased to exist here. The timber having been cut off there is no further use for saw mills. The business interests today are largely confined to the numerous retail stores and the various shops of the common trades, such as are always supported by an excellent agricultural district, such as surrounds LaGrange. The banking chapter will disclose the fact that the community is in fine financial circumstances and as a rule people are all entirely out of debt\n\nThe Grand Rapids & Indiana Railway line from north to south is the only railroad, save a short spur to the northeast, a part of the old St. Joseph Valley Railroad, from east to west.\n\nThe postal service is excellentâit has seven rural deliveries extending out from it to all parts of the central portion of the county. It is a second class postoffice, with about a $10,000 annual receipts.\n\nPost Office Employes\n\nIn the month of October, 1919, the office force and carriers are as follows: Postmaster, Henry C. Eldridge; assistant postmaster, George E. Grubaugh; clerk, Harry J. Guy; rural carriers, Edward A. Robinson, Edgar D. Bixby, Maynard F. Musser, Wm. H. Kauffman, Hiram Ridley, Clyde M. King, Frank L. Ecker. The village carriers are: Ralph Zimmerman, Lawrence E. Grubaugh. LaGrange post office transacted a business of $2,136.67 during the last quarter, ending July 31, 1919.\n\nMunicipal History\n\nLaGrange was incorporated in 1855, the following constituting the then board of trustees: Andrew Emminger, William C. Kennedy, William Rheubottom and Rensselaer Rheubottom, who held their first meeting December 26, 1855, and organized with the following officers: Rensselaer Rheubottom, president; Charles B. Holmes, clerk; Andrew Ellison, marshal; Caleb Strang, treasurer; and John B. Case, assessor.\n\nThe present (1919) city officials are these: Trustees, J. F. Roop, First Ward, president of the board; Charles A. McCally, Second Ward, water commissioner; Dr. James K. Duff, Third Ward, street commissioner; George M. White, Fourth Ward, street commissioner; J. O. Wiggins, Fifth Ward, cemetery commissioner; L. A. Foster, town attorney ; R. C. Rowe, clerk; J. O. Stewart, marshal.\n\nThe town has about one-half mile of brick paving, miles of modern cement sidewalks, a beautiful town hall, near the splendid public library, courthouse and jail. Four years ago the town met with a loss by the burning of its leased town office rooms and most of their old records.\n\nWaterworks of LaGrange\n\n1893 the town was provided with a most excellent waterworks system A vote of the people the year before had decided to bond the place for this much-needed improvement. It consists of six wells (six-inch pipe) down to a depth of from 90 to 140 feet. These wells are dis-tributed over an area of a couple of acres, near the pumping station, close to the depot. The piping goes into water-gravel, thus furnishing the purest of water, and in inexhaustible quantities. The direct pressure system is employed by which the double pumps force the water through the 5 1/2 miles of water mains throughout the townâthere being no tower or tanks. There are sixty-two fire-plugs or street hydrants. There is a volunteer fire department provided with ample fire-fighting apparatus to insure reasonable safety in ordinary fires. The burning of the old frame car barns several years ago, is the only very destructive con-flagration in the town since it had waterworks installed in 1893. The pounds of pressure given by the pumps in the water-plant on Michigan Street is no.\n\nLighting System\n\nLaGrange is lighted by electricity furnished by a private corporation, known as the LaGrange Electric Light and Power Company, which company has power plants of steam at LaGrange and one by water-power at Ontario, where the waters of Turkey River, which have flowed on ever since white men knew this county, in sufficient volume to propel various kinds of machinery. It is now harnessed to produce the electric current by which a half dozen or more of the surrounding towns and villages are brilliantly illuminated. Power is also furnished and heat sold for domestic uses, all of which reminds one of the radical and far-reaching improvements made in the memory of many now residing in this town.\n\nThere had been another electric light system in the town, beginning as early as 1888, which used the arc lights.\n\nThe town now owes $500 on their waterworks, and has a bonded indebtedness of $10,000, on bonds issued January 1, 1919, running ten years, the same being issued to care for the new town hall and other obligations. These are known as refunding bonds and draw- 6 and 7 per cent interest.\n\nDisastrous Fires\n\nWith the passage of years LaGrange has had her full share of fires with the accompanying property loss. Since 1874, among the fires worthy of mention in the annals of the place, may be recalled the burning of the old American House in 1874, and a new brick building was erected on the old site, by Abijah Brown and three sons. This, one of Northern Indiana's best hotels, was destroyed by the fire of 1877. January, 1884, there was a big fire on the south side of the public square, when the thermometer registered 200 below zero. The records of numerous other fires have not been preserved.\n\nPopulation\n\nLaGrange has never grown rapidly. In 1880 it had not far from 1,400; in 1890 it had 1,784, in 1900 it was given as 1,703, and the last United States census gives it 1,772âfourteen less than in 1890, twenty years before.\n\nIt may be added that LaGrange is a good \"home town\"âa place noted for good schools and churches, a quiet, law-abiding citizenship, and many fine homes wherein dwells a happy, contented people. It is supported largely by the fine farming community around it. Here is an excellent field for a line of small factories, some of which are already being agitated.\n\nThe Silent City\n\nNo better index can be had of a given community than to note the care and attention given to the resting place of the departed dead. This marks the distinction between the half-heathen and the Christian civilization. The first burial place in LaGrange was land including the site of the present school building. It occupied about two acres, and there the town and surrounding country buried their dead until 1863, when removals were made to the present cemetery, three-fourths of a mile to the south and a little east from the courthouse. The spot is picturesque and has a cement walk running to its enclosure from the center of the town It has plenty of suitable shade trees and shrubs to make the place beautiful. It is owned by the corporation of LaGrange and well cared for. Here rests the remains of hundreds of the pioneers. Many expensive and many more befitting and moderate tomb-stones mark the snot of parent, brother, sister and friend. \"\n\nPublic Library\n\nWhat is now styled the Carnegie Public Library of LaGrange, had its origin in an earlier association, formed by the ladies of the half dozen or more Women's Literary Clubs of the town, who through the Women's League they formed, established a public library which for two years or more was supported by private subscriptions, donations, etc.. until (under the state law) the proper standing could be obtained by which a tax could be levied to maintain such an institution. This former society opened its library rooms November 9, 1912. in a building on the south side of the public square. A regular organization was perfected by which citizens of Bloomfield and Gay townships, with the Town of LaGrange, are maintaining the present public library by taxation. About $2,000 comes from the two townships, and the town furnishes the remainder. At the proper time, the matter of building a library building was suggested to that famous iron-master library builder, Andrew Carnegie, who donated $12,500 towards erecting the magnificent structure now seen at the corner of West Spring and High streets. The ground on which this library stands was donated by the Rose brothersâIsaac, Samuel and Leon Rose. The building was dedicated February 8, 1919, when over 400 persons registered their names with Miss Florence Emerson Herbert, who was the first librarian in the town, in the old organization, and who carefully attended to the manifold duties of that office for seven years, till her removal to Lincoln, Nebraska, when her mother, Mrs. Georgia Emerson Herbert, was appointed (September, 1919 as librarian to succeed her, and she is still the efficient, painstaking librarian. Miss Florence Emerson Herbert had special training for library work and laid well the foundation for the present library.\n\nIn the autumn of 1919, the library received a handsome gift as a memorial for the late deceased Ray W. Malone, son of the donors, Mr. and Mrs. L. W. Malone, in the way of his private library, amounting to 350 books. He was an only child and died in Camp Dodge, Des Moines, Iowa. The total number of books in the library, exclusive of the lot just mentioned is about 3,000, and 30 periodicals find their way to the reading rooms of the library regularly.\n\nThe president of the library board is Frank J. Smith, who is the only person ever holding the position here.\n\nOriginal data: History of northeast Indiana : LaGrange, Steuben, Noble and DeKalb Counties. Chicago: Lewis Pub. Co., 1920."
