        "text": "Four Troup County School Students were awarded the Mayor Willie T. Edmondson Memorial Scholarship Thursday (6/27) evening at the LaGrange City Council meeting. The late Mayor Willie T. Edmondson wanted to host an event that would bring the community together but would also raise money for our young leaders. The Mayor’s Christmas Ball was held in December 2023 and proceeds from the event went to these scholarships. After Mayor Edmondson unexpectedly passed in February 2024, Mayor Pro Tem Quay Boddie hosted the Ride for Mayor Willie T. Edmondson that also raised money for this scholarship fund. Because of these fundraisers, each of these four students received a $2,000 scholarship. One student from Troup High School, LaGrange High School, and Callaway High School were chosen by their schools and one student from the LaGrange Youth Council was chosen from a panel of city representatives. The following students were awarded the 2024 Mayor Willie T. Edmondson Memorial Scholarship: - Troup High School Student Dominique Alexis Graves. She will be attending Albany State University. - LaGrange High School Student and LaGrange Youth Council Member Zykia Dyshay Gray. She will be attending Kennesaw State University. - Callaway High School Student Saralynn Elizabeth Pelt. She will be attending the University of Alabama at Birmingham. - LaGrange Youth Council Member Jordan Hunter Brock. He will be attending the University of West Georgia. “What a wonderful day when we can celebrate these young people who have worked so hard to make it to the next level of their education,” said LaGrange Mayor Jim Arrington. “This is the first time the City has committed to supporting our students through a scholarship and I’m excited we are able to do this. I’m grateful for all of the businesses and individuals who have supported this cause. Investing in our future is so important and I look forward to continuing this tradition in the future.”\n\nOur beloved Mayor Willie T. Edmondson was inducted into the 2024 Georgia Municipal Government Hall of Fame posthumously on Monday, June 24th at GMA’s annual convention in Savannah. The Hall of Fame recognizes city officials who have made extraordinary contributions to the city they serve and have exhibited strong support for GMA. Along with Edmondson, this year’s other inductees are: - Nancy Harris, former Mayor of Duluth - Paul Radford, City Manager of Sugar Hill - Randall Walker, Mayor of Perry and GMA's immediate past president \"These leaders have set an exemplary standard of dedication and service to their communities and the state of Georgia,” said Larry Hanson, CEO and Executive Director of GMA. “Their visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to public service have significantly advanced the quality of life in their cities and have left a lasting impact on municipal governance in Georgia. We are honored to recognize their outstanding contributions and legacy.\" Current LaGrange Mayor Jim Arrington says he plans to continue honoring Edmondson’s legacy, “Willie and I were not only colleagues but we were great friends too. It is my honor to help recognize his accomplishments and I plan to continue focusing on the projects that were important to him.” To view the GMA Hall of Fame video honoring the late Mayor Willie T. Edmondson go to https://lnkd.in/e3XFEFW8\n\nCongratulations to LaGrange Mayor Jim Arrington and District 1 LaGrange City Council Member Darby Pippin. They were offically sworn into office Tuesday evening. Arrington was sworn into office Tuesday, filling a mayor’s seat that was left vacant due to the untimely death of Dr. Willie T. Edmondson. Arrington joined the LaGrange City Council in 2018, and he was elected Mayor in May of this year in a special election. Arrington is a proud lifelong resident of LaGrange. He says he carefully decided to first run for public service because, \"I want to do my part and give back to the city that gave me so much.\" Arrington is the owner of the local construction company Arrington Builders. City Council Member Darby Pippin was also sworn in Tuesday evening. She is the first Councilwoman since Norma Tucker and Kay Durand, who is also Pippin’s aunt. Pippin was also elected in May’s special election, filling the vacant District 1 Council seat previously held by Arrington after he stepped down to run for Mayor. Pippin is the co-owner and president of DanRic Homes, and she has served on the Development Authority of LaGrange since 2015."
