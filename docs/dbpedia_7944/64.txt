Congratulations are in order for OneRepublic singer Tim Myers, who has welcomed a second child into the world!

Tim and his wife Lauren have announced the birth of their second daughter, who was born last week.

"My wife & I are so excited to announce the newest addition to our family," the musician wrote on Twitter.

With a three-year-old daughter already named Bowie Lane, it's no surprise that the couple would choose something equally off-the-wall for their new arrival. And they didn't disappoint – the little one has been named Berlin Grey.

Hmmm… we wonder if it's a case of naming the baby after where she was conceived, á la the Beckhams and Brooklyn?! Well at least little Berlin is definitely cute enough to pull her bizarre name off – just look at that gorgeous mop of dark hair!

Tim was a singer and bass player with OneRepublic between 2004 and 2007, before leaving the band to pursue a solo career.

His second daughter's arrival comes just a few days after the release of Tim's new album The Year – a big week all round!
