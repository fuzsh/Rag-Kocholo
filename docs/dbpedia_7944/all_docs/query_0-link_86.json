        "text": "Written By: Victoria Hill\n\n(Urban/Pop Editor)\n\nSome might recognize them as Miley Cyrus’ backing band in the film “Hannah Montana: The Movie,” but don’t confuse Hollywood for reality- Days Difference is no stranger to the music industry. The pop/rock band from Virginia Beach, VA consists of of Jeremy Smith (lead vocals/keyboard), Jonathan Smith (drums), Micah Ricks (bass guitar) and Jeremiah Ricks (lead guitar).\n\nOriginally signed to Black Dog Recordings, the band released their debut album “Numbers” in 2007. The band toured and developed a genuine connection with their fans. Universal Motown saw potential in the band and signed them after they played an industry showcase.\n\nThe band’s newest release is called “Days Difference” and it showcases Jeremy Smith’s songwriting skills (he co-wrote six of the ten tracks) and includes a who’s who in the music industry…Wayne Wilkins (Beyonce), Andrew Frampton (Kylie Minogue), Stefanie Ridel Fair (Fergie and the Pussycat Dolls) and former OneRepublic bassist Tim Myers.\n\nThe album is a catchy pop record; some stand-out songs are, “Are You Happy?”, “Falling Into You” and “Love Is Enough.”\n\nThe band portrays a great image of having fun which I could feel listening to the songs. The band’s melodies and harmonies are great. While the Jonas Brothers may be the popular boy band on the scene, I believe that Days Difference is poised to be the next big thing as I believe fans will not be disappointed in what the band has to offer now on this album and future albums to come."
