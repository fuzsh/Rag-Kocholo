        "text": "Rescue Me, OneRepublic’s highly anticipated new single, gets a wonderful video directed by Christian Lamb, and choreographed by Sherrie Silver, about a young boy who brings a combination of dance and superpowers to thwart a gang of BMX bullies.\n\nThe boy, played by Cody Bingham (who's being making a name for himself on US TV show Dancing with the Stars: Juniors) flees his BMX pursuers through gorgeous woodland - the video was filmed in Silverton, Oregon - before making a stand in suburbia. Then he busts some brilliant moves in a dance choreographed by Silver, who made such an impact last year with her work on Childish Gambino's This Is America video.\n\nChristian Lamb has also been working extensively in music and dance-related productions on TV and live - including Michael Bublé’s NBC Special “bublé!”, Beyonce’s Formation tour and Childish Gambino’s This Is America Tour. He worked closely on developing the music video for Rescue Me with OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder and the band - who make a brief cameo appearance, at a neighbourhood barbeque as the suburban battle gets into full swing."
