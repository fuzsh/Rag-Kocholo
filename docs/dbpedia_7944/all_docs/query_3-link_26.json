        "text": "By Radio.com Staff\n\n(RADIO.COM) – The trailer for The Circle hit YouTube yesterday and as soon as fans got past the Steve Jobs and Apple comparisons, many moved on to the question; Was that a cover of Hall & Oates' \"Private Eyes?\"\n\nIndeed, it is a cover of the 1981 hit. The song was produced by Tim Myers, formerly of OneRepublic. In addition to his duties as pop star, Myers is a prolific artist in the film and TV sync world (song that serve as soundtracks). But the voice… the voice makes this particular cover come alive. As the owner of a record label, Myers tapped one of his own artists; Helene Immel, better known as Lenachka, a German-born singer-songwriter living in Los Angeles. This isn't the first cover Lenachka has been a part of however. Some of her interpretations include Skrillex and Diplo's \"Where Are Ü Now\", Taylor Swift's Safe & Sound, \"Sweater Weather\" by The Neighbourhood, \"Clarity\" by Zedd Feat. Foxes, \"Royals\" by Lorde, and Justin Bieber's \"Heartbreaker.\"\n\nMyers and Lenachka's take on the 80's classic tune fits the film's trailer perfectly with lyrics, \"they're watching\" hauntingly repeating over and over.\n\nThe Circle explores how far the big social media and tech companies will go to create what they believe to be the perfect society by following and predicting everyone's behaviors and activities. Based on a novel by Dave Eggers, the James Ponsoldt directed film stars Emma Watson, Tom Hanks and John Boyega.\n\nThe Circle arrives at theaters April 28, 2017.\n\nWatch the trailer below followed by Hall & Oates' original. Currently, Myers' and Lenachka's song is available only in the trailer. Here's to hoping they'll make it available in full soon.\n\n©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
