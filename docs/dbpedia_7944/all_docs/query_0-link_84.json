And they didn't disappoint – the little one has been named Berlin Grey.\n\nHmmm… we wonder if it's a case of naming the baby after where she was conceived, á la the Beckhams and Brooklyn?! Well at least little Berlin is definitely cute enough to pull her bizarre name off – just look at that gorgeous mop of dark hair!\n\nTim was a singer and bass player with OneRepublic between 2004 and 2007, before leaving the band to pursue a solo career.\n\nHis second daughter's arrival comes just a few days after the release of Tim's new album The Year – a big week all round!"
