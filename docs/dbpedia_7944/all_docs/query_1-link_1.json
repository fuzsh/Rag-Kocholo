        "text": "When he was 18, Tim Myers moved to Los Angeles, where he formed a little rock band called OneRepublic with Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins.\n\nThey toured the country. Myers remembers an early band show at Al’s Wine and Whiskey Lounge on Clinton Street.\n\nHe loves Central New York, Myers says, what with his uncle Dick, aunt Libby and cousins Eddie, Daniel and Brian Leonard living in Westvale.\n\nAfter four years of globe-trotting — and co-writing the hit single “Stop and Stare” — Myers left OneRepublic in 2007.\n\nPlenty of his solo songs thereafter have made it to the public’s ears, he says. He’s placed songs on hit TV show “Grey’s Anatomy” — four now — and major films “Friends with Benefits,” “Beastly,” “The Dilemma,” “Hotel for Dogs,” “New Year’s Eve” and upcoming Nicholas Sparks adaptation “The Lucky One.”\n\nA representative from Zync Music caught one of his solo shows at an LA club, and told him his music was “licensable.”\n\nEnter a new world.\n\n“Right away, they got me the season’s finale on ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ and it went up on iTunes and I got 50,000 downloads,” Myers says in a phone interview from LA.\n\nHis songs have been used in a bunch of TV commercials, too, including eight for Chase Bank and six for Target.\n\nIt’s lucrative.\n\n“Drew (Brown of OneRepublic), he came to my house and said, ‘Oh, my gosh, I’m living in a crappy apartment downtown with a friend of mine,’” Myers says. “I felt awful. I said, ‘You’re the guitarist in a huge rock band.’ But that’s the way the industry works. It’s hard to make money on the road, paying for the bus and food and hotels and tour managers.”\n\nMyers will release his first solo album, “Technicolor,” on Valentine’s Day.\n\n“It’s a huge leap for me,” he says. “It took four years (to make). I want it to go gold. But after success with OneRepublic, I’ve come to terms with being an indie artist with success not in the mainstream. I’m OK with fans of indie music enjoying it.”"
