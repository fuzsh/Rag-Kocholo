        "text": "Bon Jovi\n\nAfter ushering in the era of pop-metal with their hit singles, \"You Give Love a Bad Name,\" \"Wanted Dead or Alive,\" and \"Living on a Prayer,\" Bon Jovi wound up transcending the big-haired '80s, to one of the biggest American rock bands of their time -- selling over 120 million albums worldwide & sustaining their popularity well into the new millennium. They slowly peeled away the arena rock guitars of the '80s, occasionally scoring on the adult contemporary charts and sometimes singing country music without ever rejecting hard rock, a move that illustrated how they never abandoned their roots.\n\nNathan East\n\nA founding member of the chart-topping contemporary jazz group Fourplay, East was 16 years old when he got his first break and found himself on the road with Barry White. The next time the phone rang, Quincy Jones was on the line. The calls kept coming and for the last forty years, East has been churning out hit songs with artists as legendary as Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Michael Jackson, Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, BeyoncÃ©, Barbra Streisand and Stevie Wonder.\n\nBlack Eyed Peas\n\nHillsong United\n\nAndrew Marshall (Billie Eilish)\n\nArchitects (UK)\n\nCarter McLean\n\n“At Lion King Broadway, I need to hear every detail of the orchestra. My A6t’s allow that to happen flawlessly. 64 audio has brought a new level of clarity and musicality to my life.”\n\nChildish Gambino\n\nDustin Lynch\n\nThe clarity of the 64's are perfect. I've played little-bitty bars all the way up to huge arenas, and I can always rely on my 64's. So y'all check them out if you don't have a pair! - Dustin Lynch\n\nJay-Z\n\nKhalid\n\nMaluma\n\nMercyMe\n\nMGMT\n\nOneRepublic\n\nFeaturing the anthemic songwriting of Ryan Tedder, OneRepublic became a regular presence on the charts of North America, Europe, and Australasia beginning with their 2007 debut. A Timbaland remix of its lead single, \"Apologize,\" landed in the Top Three in well over dozen countries and was, at the time, the best-selling digital download in U.S. history. Although the song seemed to make them an instant success, OneRepublic had spent five years touring the musical minor leagues before its release, with Tedder splitting his time between the band's work and production gigs for other artists."
