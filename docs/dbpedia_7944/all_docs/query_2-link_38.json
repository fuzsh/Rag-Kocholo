        "text": "In writing about the many Colorado bands getting signed to major labels the past couple of years, there’s always been a pesky little asterisk in the mix.\n\nOneRepublic formed in Colorado in 2003 — and singer-songwriter Ryan Tedder wrote the No. 1 single “Apologize” at his dad’s house in Colorado Springs four years before its radio debut. But the band relocated to Los Angeles a few years ago, a move that brought them closer to the major-label system that eventually signed them and took them in, making them superstars.\n\nSo OneRepublic is a Colorado- born band that resides in Southern California.\n\nFor now.\n\nThe Denver Post has the exclusive news that will excite the band’s many fans here: OneRepublic is moving back to Colorado, and soon, according to Tedder.\n\n“As a band we’ve planned on relocating back to Colorado for a couple years,” Tedder told The Post earlier this week. “We’re going to wait until this album is done, and when we have that break, we’re going to all move back that way. I’ve actually been looking for houses off and on for six months.”\n\nAfter moving to Colorado from Oklahoma to finish high school, Tedder met guitarist Zach Filkins through the soccer program at Colorado Springs Christian High School. Tedder has lived all over the state — in Denver, Fort Collins and the Springs — and his wife is a Cherry Creek High School grad, so the local ties abound.\n\n“I’m excited to get back,” said Tedder, who brings his band to a sold-out Gothic Theatre tonight. “L.A.’s got great weather. But I’d rather live in Denver and commute to L.A. when we need to, and my wife would also love to get back to her family.”\n\nTedder, a producer and songwriter who always knew he wanted to be an artist, has had an eventful adult life that has included moves to New York, Nashville and Los Angeles. OneRepublic’s music is bombastic pop, heavy on the ballads and occasionally overproduced (i.e. perfect for FM radio). The band was first signed to Columbia, and its record was to be released in 2006, but people were fired and internal politics messed with that plan.\n\nAfter more than two years in the major-label muck, the group was released from its contract with Columbia and signed to megaproducer Timbaland’s Interscope Records imprint, Mosley Music Group. Tedder had interned with Timbaland — the producer behind countless hits from Justin Timberlake, Nelly Furtado, 50 Cent and Missy Elliott — and he wanted to include a slightly revamped “Apologize” on his singles collection, “Timbaland Presents Shock Value.”\n\nTedder and his bandmates were unsure of going that direction, as the credit on the song would read “Timbaland featuring OneRepublic,” even though the producer only added a couple of beats to the record. But since OneRepublic was still only known as a MySpace phenomenon and wanted its music heard on the radio, the band said yes.\n\n“To be dead honest, it was a launchpad,” Tedder said of the now multiplatinum “Shock Value.” “Timbaland knew it was a hit. The label knew it was a hit. And we’d already proven that it was a hit. We were the No. 1 act on MySpace for a year . . . I wasn’t crazy about all the other acts involved in ‘Shock Value,’ but at the end of the day it was the biggest thing in the world for us.”\n\n“Apologize” was one of the most ubiquitous singles of 2007, both on radio and TV, rivaling the Fray’s licensing prowess, and the band is going full-bore into the new year with the lengthy shelf life of its first single and the impressive performance of its second single, “Stop and Stare,” both of which are included on last year’s full-length “Dreaming Out Loud.”\n\nTedder has a unique relationship with “Apologize.” When he wrote the song, he knew he had touched on something special.\n\n“I’ve been sitting on that song for years, and when I wrote it, I thought, ‘There’s something about this song. I think it could be a really big song,’ ” he said. “It’s vindicating, especially having been signed and dropped by Columbia, to be right for a change.”\n\nThere has been plenty of debate over the lack of distinction in Timbaland’s “remix” of the song. The producer brought in some extra beats and some minor vocal adds, sure, but the two versions are only slightly different.\n\n“It’s the same song,” said Tedder. “It’s not all that different. He didn’t change one aspect lyrically or melodically. And really it’s the same song that I wrote so many years ago. The original version on the album and Timbaland’s remix — that’s what it sounded like when I wrote it at my dad’s house in Colorado Springs.”\n\nOnerepublic\n\nPop.
