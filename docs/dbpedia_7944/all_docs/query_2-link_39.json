The song was written by group members Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, and Eddie Fisher along with group associate Noel Zancanella. It was produced by Tedder, with co-production by Kutzle and Zancanella. It is in the key of F# major/G♭ major, and it appears as the sixth track on the album.\n\nThe song was released on November 17, 2009 as the album's third single in the United States, and as its overall fourth single. Its popularity was increased by its use in various films, television series and advertisements. The single was a commercial success, peaking at number 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and eventually being certified multi-platinum, as well as reaching the top twenty of other music charts across Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The song has sold over 3 million copies in the US as of January 2014.[1]\n\nCritical reception of \"Good Life\" was generally positive. This song is unique in that the band recorded various radio versions of this song for different cities and states. The line changed in the lyrics is \"my friends in [city/state] they don't know, where I've been.\"\n\nA remix of the song, featuring American rapper B.o.B, was released to radio stations in June 2011.\n\nAs of June 2016, Good Life is the only OneRepublic song to be rated Explicit on iTunes, for its use of the word 'bullshit' within the song.\n\nPromotion[]\n\nInitially released as a single in November 2010, the song's popularity was increased after its use in various media. Google used the song in its 2010 Zeitgeist \"year in review\" video.[2] The song is featured in the trailers for the films Eat Pray Love and One Day, in the film Easy A,[3] and in the television series Cougar Town, Gossip Girl, One Tree Hill, Rookie Blue, America's Got Talent, and 90210. The group performed the song at the 2011 Teen Choice Awards, 2011 Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards of 2011, Live with Regis and Kelly, Dancing with the Stars, and recently at the 2011 Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade. The background music of this song was played on various Walt Disney World television and radio commercials. In August 2012, \"Good Life\" was featured in a Honda Summer Clearance Event commercial.\n\nCritical reception[]\n\nGiving the song five stars, About.com wrote, \"Not only does \"Good Life\" have lyrics that anyone can relate to — \"...please tell me what there is to complain about...\" — it also has a unique musical delivery that allows the song to stand out on a radio full of same-sounding songs.\"[4] Rolling Stone put the song on its list of the 15 Best Whistling Songs of All Time.[5]\n\nMusic video[]\n\nThe music video for \"Good Life\" was premiered on February 14, 2011. The video shows the band performing the song in a field, processed to look like an old film. It shows many different symbols and is a bit different from their previous videos. The original video was filmed in a mountain valley located in West Hills, California. It features cameo appearances by Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Nicolas Cage, Russell Crowe, and many more.\n\nIn December 2011, a second music video, filmed entirely at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World was released. It features the band performing at Cinderella Castle, as well as riding on several attractions.[6]\n\nAnother video of the band playing in concert was also released on May 3, 2011, promoting the forthcoming Good Life Series\n\nVersions[]\n\nA remix by B.o.B. was released in 2011.\n\nIn the spring of 2011, OneRepublic did a short series entitled The Good Life Series in which in various European cities after performing a scheduled concert, the band put on impromptu shows on the streets performing various songs including Good Life. This series was all uploaded to OneRepublicVEVO's YouTube account.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nCredits[]\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Waking Up\n\nWriters and producers Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Eddie Fisher and Noel Zancanella Recorded at Metropolis Studios London, UK and Park Hill Studios Denver, CO Instrumentation OneRepublic Additional Instrumentation Noel Zancanella Vocals Ryan Tedder Whistle Ryan Tedder Mixed by Joe Zook Mastered by Brian \"Big Bass\" Gardner Published by\n\nMidnite Miracle (ASCAP)/Sony ATV\n\nPatriot Games Publishing (ASCAP)\n\nAll rights administered by Kobalt Songs Music Publishing\n\nAcornman (ASCAP)\n\nAdministered by Kobalt Music Publishing Worldwide, America Inc.\n\nLJF Publishing Co (ASCAP)\n\nAdministered by Kobalt Music Publishing Worldwide, America Inc."
