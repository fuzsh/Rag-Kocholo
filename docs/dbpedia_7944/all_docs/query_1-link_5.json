        "text": "The mainstream is polluted with pop-leaning hooks and melodies, and sometimes, it takes a bit of digging to uncover an artist (or a duo) to really strike a chord with listeners. For budding musicians Schuyler Fisk and Tim Myers, who make up FM Radio, they have learned to topple any notions the public has about them and what it takes to achieve success with their own left-of-center charm. As they head into the creation of their follow-up to 2012′s Out of the Blue, they continue to hone their songwriting craft and live performance presentation. I recently had a chance to chat with the singer-songwriters about their previous history with OneRepublic, Sheryl Crow and what the songwriting process is like.\n\nJason Scott: You’re described as “a love child between Fleetwood Mac, The Lumineers and Lady Antebellum.” Can you elaborate on that?\n\nSchuyler Fisk: Well, we use a lot of harmonies, we are storytellers, and kind of walk that indie/country/pop line.\n\nJS: Where are you two from? How did you meet and start playing music together?\n\nSF: I am from Virginia. Tim and I met in Los Angeles, when a mutual musician friend introduced us. He actually brought Tim in to play piano on a song of mine. I liked him instantly.\n\nTim Myers: When Schuyler and I first met I was instantly blown away by her voice and songs. It felt like a perfect musical match.\n\nJS: When was the first time you played onstage in front of a crowd? What was that like?\n\nSF: When I was 14, I played a song that I wrote at my high school talent show. It was a rush I hadn’t felt before. People came up to me at school that next week like “we had no idea you played guitar and sang!\n\nTM: I got up and sang in front of church a lot as a little kid and when I was around the age of 8 I got to sing at Anaheim Stadium! I joined a band in Jr. High and sang for a talent show too. I feel lucky to be involved in music really early on.\n\nJS: Tim Myers, you used to play for OneRepublic. Why did you leave? What did you learn from that to take into this new venture?\n\nTM: I left OneRepublic for a lot of reasons. I love writing songs and creating in the studio and we were no longer doing that. I love singing, and there were also creative differences. I feel so blessed to have met Schuyler and feel so lucky to be where I’m at now with my musical career!\n\nJS: Tim, you’ve also written with bands like Snow Patrol, Tyrone Wells and MoZella. Can you talk about that?\n\nTM: My favorite place to be is creating music and writing songs. Each artist really brings their unique identity to songwriting and I love exploring new territory with them. I feel like my job is to assist in enhancing their sound as much as possible and be that creative springboard.\n\nJS: What has been your favorite songwriting session?\n\nSF: All of our Tim/Schuyler sessions are pretty great and fun. We get along well and work fast together. It never feels like work. “Lead Me Home” is probably my favorite song we’ve written together.\n\nTM: Without a doubt Schuyler is! She is such a great lyricist and is amazing with harmonies. We are yin and yang.\n\nJS: With regard to your songwriting, what are you usually inspired by?\n\nSF: Other music I’m listening to, new and old. And lyrically, things going on in my life, in my friends’ lives, or in books I’m reading or movies I’m watching. I think it’s important try to live a full life, meet new people, and do things that scare me. So I have things to write about.\n\nTM: Same as Schuyler! Sometimes just talking with random people I’ll hear something they said that was interesting and I’ll make a note of the idea real fast on my phone. I sometimes will get melody ideas in the shower, driving or waiting in line at drive thru.\n\nJS: When you head into a session, do you go in with a lyric, melody or just a general idea?\n\nSF: Depends. Sometimes I go in with a lyric idea, or even just an idea for a song title. Sometimes I go in with a melody. And sometimes I come in with nothing. Blank slate.\n\nTim: Same here! Sometimes a lyric, chord progression or melody, or a beat or a concept and sometimes just a total blank slate.\n\nJS: What is the songwriting process like?\n\nSF: It’s different every time. But for FM RADIO songs and specifically our Schuyler/Tim collaborations, it’s very laid back but also fast paced. We work off each other well. And we have our certain things that we are each strong at. We trust each other. Tim will be like, “Schuyler, you write the lyrics to that verse while I come up with this banjo part.” But it’s different every time.\n\nTM: It is totally different every time! It’s always fun and a new experience every time.\n\nJS: Are you one of those writers that can get a song out in 15 minutes or does it take much longer?\n\nSF: Yes, sometimes. Not always.\n\nTM: I don’t think Schuyler and I have written together in 15 minutes but maybe we’ve done 45 minutes or an hour. I’ve never done a song in 15 minutes. Its definitely not every time it’s that fast. Songwriting for me varies from 45 minutes to 8 hours.\n\nJS: Schuyler, your first solo record was a chart-topper on iTunes and did really well on Billboard’s Heatseekers chart. What does that success feel like?\n\nSF: It’s a wonderful feeling to think that people are listening to the music I am making. Makes me feel very grateful.\n\nJS: The follow-up album Blue Ribbon Winner was released in 2011. Tell me about that.\n\nSF: Blue Ribbon Winner is a record I am very proud of. I made it in Virginia with wonderful people. That record feels like home to me.\n\nJS: What was the creative process like for that album? How has it been different than the first?\n\nSF: They were very different processes. Before I made my first record people always told me, “you have your whole life to write your first record and a couple months to write your second” and I didn’t really know what that meant at the time. But it’s so true. It’s like putting your best foot forward and then trying to keep up, but evolve at the same time. You also literally don’t have as much time because people are waiting for more. I love both of my records. They both represent the many sides of me as an artist and as a person.\n\nJS: Do you have any plans on releasing a new solo album soon?\n\nSF: I do. I’m working on writing the best 3rd solo record I can. I want it to be great, so I’m not trying to rush it. That said, I’m really excited to get back into the studio and dig into some of these new solo songs.\n\nJS: Do you guys seek advice from each other in your solo work?\n\nSF: Of course. I respect Tim’s musical opinions and love his versatility. We have written songs together and played/sang on songs for each others solo projects.\n\nTim: I love Schuyler’s advice. she is amazing a solo artist and a great bandmate\n\nJS: Is it hard working as a duo after being solo?\n\nSF: I actually prefer it. I like having a partner that I don’t want to let down. So I’m working hard for somebody else and not just me anymore. It’s motivating. Plus, I love the collaborations musically. Gets me out of my comfort zones.\n\nTim: I love it. I feel like the best things I do come out of collaborating with Schuyler and working together towards a goal.\n\nJS: Schuyler, you’ve toured with Sheryl Crow. When was that?\n\nSF: Oh man, years and years ago!\n\nJS: Did you ever get a chance to sit down and talk with her? Did anything she say really stick with you?\n\nSF: I never had like a deep heart to heart with her about life or music or anything. But she was very kind to me and I really loved being around her. The best thing about it was seeing what a pro she was. It was inspiring.\n\nJS: What was the biggest lesson you learned from her?\n\nSF: That living your dreams is totally possible.\n\nJS: “Be My Only” was featured on the series finale of Ugly Betty, correct? What was that like?\n\nSF: That was very cool. Tim and I were thrilled.\n\nJS: What was that phone call like? Did you freak out?\n\nSF: Yes, I was very excited.\n\nJS: So, you’ve been on tour. How has that been going?\n\nSF: We love playing shows for people. It’s neat to see how people react to the songs live. Looking forward to many more shows! This summer we’ll get to share the bill with Loretta Lynn, one of my all time favorites!\n\nJS: Can fans expect new music from you two soon?\n\nSF: Yes! Working on that as we speak!"
