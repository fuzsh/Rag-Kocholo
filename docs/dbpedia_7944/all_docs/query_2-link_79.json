The song ‘’Kids’’ is intended for all audiences to bring back memories of their past in their younger days. As stated by onerepublic, “I’ve played ‘Kids’ for 15-year-olds and they get all emotional about when they were 12. People in their 20s or 30s think about being 19.” This song brings out the inner child everyone has in them.\n\nThis song is intended for all ages. Its purpose is to target memories of one’s past. It brings out the emotions you have about your past whether good or bad causes you to reminisce about your childhood. Based on a true story “kids” is about Ryan tedder, the lead singer, childhood friend who he had always had issues with. The song is meant to spark emotion, and it truly does bring everyone’s emotion as I got emotional while listening to the song.\n\n“Kids” has a very smooth beat continuing throughout the entire song setting the emotional mood. As I listened to the song it caused me to remember people, friends of my past where I went through the same experiences he was. The song did cause much emotion in me because it brought back fond memories of my old neighbor. The songs intentional purpose is achieved by both the mood the beat brings and the lyrics the song contains. In my personal opinion this is a song you should listen to. The beat may not be for everyone however the lyrics will touch the heart of everyone, causing the humanity of all to be expressed.\n\nThis is the song for class of 2017, we all have our memories to remember."
