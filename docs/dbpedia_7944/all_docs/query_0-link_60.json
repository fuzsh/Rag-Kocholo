So, let’s dive into a curated selection of the best music for the office environment, guaranteed to keep your team in sync and uplifted throughout the day.\n\n(psst: Looking to build even deeper bonds with your team?

As a thought leader in the team building industry, the focus is on creating positive change and supporting employees in finding happiness and navigating challenges, coinciding with the dog days are over meaning. By prioritizing employee well-being, resilience can be cultivated, leading to a harmonious workplace culture benefiting both the company and individual employees.\n\n“Wake Me Up” by Avicii\n\nThe summer hit is a song about living in the moment. We may be unsure of our futures but we are alive now and have to start living in the present or else life will pass right before our eyes. It’s a song that can resonate with many people no matter which stage of life we are currently in. We should all learn to accept the unknowns of the future and embrace the present.\n\n“The Nights” by Avicii\n\nThis song is about living life to the fullest. “The Nights” by Avicii reminds listeners to live freely and lightly, and could be a great addition to your office party playlist. Obstacles will be thrown your way, but remember the good times and the moments that make life worth living.\n\n“Titanium” by David Guetta ft. Sia\n\nThe pop techno song not only has a great catchy beat but also inspiring and empowering lyrics. The single talks about finding inner strength even when the world seems too dark and challenging. It is a great reminder for people to stand up for themselves and not let anyone else belittle them.\n\n“Roar” by Katy Perry\n\nThis song is all about overcoming challenges and getting back up on your feet when someone or something comes along and knocks you down. Today’s transition to virtual work is unprecedented and can result in challenges you’re not used to. You’ll likely come across rough patches at work; whether it’s a co-worker who’s tough to get along with or a project that’s hard to manage. Teamwork – even in the virtual workplace – will give you that push you need to be able to overcome anything in your way. Maybe the problem can be fixed through improving communication or getting organized as a group – whatever it is, remember what Katy says! You’re a fighter and a champion. Don’t let obstacles get in your way.\n\n“Hall of Fame” by The Script ft. Will.i.am\n\nThe song “Hall of Fame” featuring will.i.am is meant to be inspirational. The song sends a message to believe in the impossible and that you can be anything and do anything you desire with hard work and determination. It encourages listeners to dream and to believe in themselves despite critics. While this isn’t one of the most popular songs for work, it has an important message that is very relevant to our everyday lives. When we are feeling too scared or weak to follow our dreams this song is a reminder that we will never succeed if we don’t at least try.\n\n“Viva la Vida” by Coldplay\n\nThis song tells the story of a king who used to rule the world but in an instant lost everything and everyone turned on him. The song has been interpreted in many ways but it’s also about the temporary nature of life. It symbolizes someone who just like a king can have everything in one moment and nothing in another. The song is a lesson to acknowledge that nothing is forever and that we should learn to appreciate and value what we have at the moment because it may not be there tomorrow.\n\n“I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor\n\nThe song describes Gloria’s personal journey and strength after a breakup and is now regarded as a symbol of female empowerment. The lyrics tell the story of someone who was broken and afraid and built themselves back up. Despite the song being about a breakup, it can also apply to many other aspects of life. It is an empowering song for anyone and motivates the listener to believe in themselves and find the strength within.\n\n“…it took all the strength I had not to fall apart.”\n\n“Livin’ on a Prayer” by Bon Jovi\n\nWhat a year it has been for us all mentally, emotionally, and physically. This song is the perfect addition to your upbeat office music playlist, and reminds us as listeners that we will make it through no matter the situation we are in. Most importantly, hold onto hope and stay optimistic through all the challenges that life is going to throw at you.\n\n“Safe and Sound” by Capital Cities\n\n“Safe and Sound” is all about having a support system to get you through the tough times in life. The message of the song is something that we can all relate to, especially after the global circumstances that most of us lived through in the past year. Therefore, it is important to have support, whether from one person or multiple, who will help us weather the storms and difficult parts of our lives.\n\n“…In a tidal wave of mystery. You’ll still be standing next to me”\n\n“Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees\n\nThe song references the struggle of trying to stay alive in the rough streets of New York City. They reference multiple times how surviving each day is a victory in itself. Although we may not all be trying to survive the cities of NYC this song is very relevant to our current situation and living through a pandemic. Even if things don’t pan out as we had imagined, sometimes it is important to be grateful for simply being alive.\n\n“Beautiful Day” by U2\n\nThe song is about finding joy in the small things in life. Regardless of how difficult life is, or if we have experienced loss, we have to appreciate the small things that we have left. Just like a flower that can thrive in inhospitable conditions, humans can also survive and persevere during hard times. This song is an important reminder for us to appreciate all of the small and seemingly meaningless things in our lives.\n\n“Lean On Me” by Bill Withers\n\nOne of the most meaningful songs I’ve ever heard is “Lean On Me” by Bill Withers. Inspired by his tough upbringing, Withers crafted lyrics that came from his heart and expressed the gratitude he had towards his friends when times were hard. This song is all about acknowledging defeat and weakness and having a shoulder to lean on in times of need.\n\n“Treat People With Kindness” by Harry Styles\n\nThe hit song is all about making small changes in your life that will lead to your happiness and doing the same for others. It is about acceptance and treating others the way we would like to be treated regardless of our differences. It is a message that is relevant for listeners of all ages and paths of life.\n\n“Up&Up” by Coldplay\n\nThe song embraces that things are going to happen in life. Still, through all the ups and downs, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. It reminds listeners that if something isn’t working for you in life to change it. We all experience “damages” that may impede our journey but Coldplay strives to remind us to fix those “damages” so we can continue on. Accept the challenges that life throws at you and build something great out of it.\n\n“Walking on Sunshine” by Katrina & The Waves\n\nThe song “Walking on Sunshine” is a feel-good song that immediately lifts your spirits. The title and refrain “walking on sunshine” refer to the happiness one feels when in love. The beat and lyrics are great for motivation and to lift anyone’s mood!\n\n“Remember the Name” by Fort Minor\n\nYou might remember hearing this song in commercials years ago to promote sporting events. The lyrics of “Remember the Name” relate perfectly to the spirit of competition and aiming high – it’s all about the formula for success. It makes sense why this motivating music would be perfect for competitive sports – Fort Minor breaks down every piece of what they believe enables us to succeed:\n\n“Ten percent luck, twenty percent skill, fifteen percent concentrated power of will. Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain, and a hundred percent reason to remember the name.”\n\n“Upside Down” by Jack Johnson\n\nHave you ever been told you can’t do something and it made you want to do it even more? This week’s song, Upside Down by Jack Johnson, sends a message to always stay curious. By staying curious and looking at challenges from a different perspective you might discover something better that wasn’t initially right in front of you.\n\n“What a Wonderful World” by Louis Armstrong\n\nThe song highlights the little things in life that are beautiful people seem to lose sight of. From skies of blue to trees of green, it reminds us to take a step back and focus more on the positive aspects the world has to offer. It may be a difficult time or a difficult week, but the world won’t stop spinning. As you drive to work or work from home take a moment to look outside and observe something you find beautiful. Not only will this workplace song serve as a reminder of what a wonderful world we live in, but take away a bit of the stress on our shoulders.\n\n“Whatever It Takes” by Imagine Dragons\n\nThe song is about ambition and doing ‘whatever it takes’ to accomplish your goals. It’s a great motivating and catchy song that reminds us all to go after our dreams. The path to our goals and dreams may not always be easy but if we are determined the end result will be worth the effort.\n\n“Dream On” by Aerosmith\n\nSteven Tyler, the lead singer of the Boston band Aerosmith, wrote “Dream On” when he was only 17 years old. Just a kid with a dream and the motivation to achieve his personal goals in the music world. The song is specifically about “singing through the laughter and the tears” – which was probably Tyler’s way of expressing his resilience to be what he dreamed of without letting anything get in his way – but we think the lyrics and essence of this workplace song can be applied to any dream, not just within the music industry.\n\n“High Hopes” by Panic! At the Disco\n\nThis tune is about following your own path and chasing after your dreams. If you’ve ever had a dream for the future, we recommend you listen to High Hopes by Panic! At the Disco.\n\n“Stronger (What Doesn’t Kill You)” by Kelly Clarkson\n\nKelly Clarkson is known in the music world for being a strong, confident female figure and role model for girls everywhere. She sings about standing up for yourself and having the strength to achieve what you want when you want it. Her song “Stronger (What Doesn’t Kill You)” is about taking challenges and turning them into positives. “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” means that when you look at negative things in a positive light, you can turn them into personal achievements and learn from pain or mistakes.\n\n“What a Feeling” by Irene Cara\n\nThe hit song is about following your dreams. The song is quite inspirational and encourages the listener to not let fear and pride prevent you from doing what you want and following your passions in life. The song has an important message for everyone that may be too scared to take a risk for fear of failure or criticism from others.\n\n“…Take your passion and make it happen”\n\n“Rescue Me” by OneRepublic\n\nThe song is about unconditional support and reminisces on a past relationship. The song questions over and over if they will be there for each other when needed regardless of how the relationship ended. It makes the listener think about their own relationships and wonder if they have someone who will also “rescue” them.\n\n“Pocketful of Sunshine” by Natasha Bedingfield\n\nIt’s all about possessing inner strength and knowing your own power. “Sticks and stones” can’t break you if you realize your own worth – and show it to the rest of the world.\n\n“Beautiful People” by Ed Sheeran ft.
