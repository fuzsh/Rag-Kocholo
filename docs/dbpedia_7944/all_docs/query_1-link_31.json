        "text": "Tedder - the group’s lead singer and underrated star - wasn’t there to prove anything to the crowd, in fact all he wanted was for concertgoers to listen to “all the songs you already know” and have a great time while doing it.\n\nAddressing concertgoers for the first time, he said “Auckland, this is without question - has been since I was a kid - kind of my dream country to visit and to play,” he went on to say, “Every single interview for 15-16 years when they ask ‘what’s the best country?’, ‘what’s the most amazing country you’ve ever been to?’ I say New Zealand.”\n\nThe star went on to explain to the crowd full of young kids, teens, parents and all the ages in between that their world tour is wrapping up in New Zealand with their final show in Wellington on Saturday night, “We wanted to end it here because we wanted to end on a high note. We love Australia, we love Asia but going out with this memory is going to be incredible.”\n\nMuch like the band’s discography, Tedder acknowledged that Kiwis have been able to pick from an impressive selection lately making him all the more grateful for every single person who showed up on Thursday night.\n\n“Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran,” he said listing off only two of the many artists that have visited Aotearoa in recent weeks, “I saw the line up when I was coming here and I was like ‘I almost texted both of those guys, did you literally try to f*** me? Is this a joke?’ But here you are,” he laughed to an enthusiastic crowd.\n\nTedder moved around the stage performing Rescue Me, Wherever I Go and Love Runs Out, with nothing but comfort as though he was born to be there. With a mic in one hand, and a tambourine in the other he often engaged with the crowd and shouted ‘I love you too’ to anyone who expressed their love, even if he thought they could be “age-inappropriate”.\n\nHalfway through the show, he addressed the crowd once more with a revelation that came as a shock to so many you could almost hear the gasps.\n\nRevealing himself as the mastermind songwriter behind some of music’s biggest songs including Beyonce’s Halo, Leona Lewis’ Bleeding Love, Ellie Golding’s Burn and even Ed Sheeran’s Happier he said, “For the next 15 minutes, I’m going to play, we’re going to play hits I’ve wroten,” he said before jokingly adding, “is that what you Kiwis say?” resulting in laughs from the crowd.\n\n“I’ve been lucky enough to work with everyone in my career,” he said listing off big names such as Sir Paul McCartney, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, Carrie Underwood and many more, “so we’re going to play some songs you know, the next 15 minutes is Kiwi karaoke”.\n\nAs promised the next 15 minutes were in fact Kiwi karaoke but it continued well past covers of songs he wrote for or with other huge artists.\n\nContinuing on with Lose Somebody, Sunshine, I Aint Worried and Counting Stars, the band proved they could have played all night and honestly, the crowd may have even wanted them to because with five albums full of massive hits to choose from, an 80 minute set just didn’t seem long enough.\n\nUltimately the night had to come to an end and it did so with a truly fantastic performance of If I Lose Myself.\n\n“Thank you New Zealand, we love you.” Tedder said on behalf of the band who blew kisses to the crowd and took not one, but two well-deserved bows.\n\nLOWDOWN:\n\nWho: One Republic\n\nWhen: March 18\n\nWhere: Wellington"
