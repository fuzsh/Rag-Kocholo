        "text": "As a band, OneRepublic has found massive, international success with several of their singles, and many of the more memorable ones—“Apologize,” “All The Right Moves,” “Good Life,” and “Counting Stars,” to name just a few—have gone several times platinum, and have earned them a place in the top 40 world. The group is lead by Ryan Tedder, who is by far one of the most prolific and creative hit songwriters and producers of our time, with much of his most famous material having gone to other artists. Tedder has worked with Adele, Taylor Swift, Rob Thomas, Ellie Goulding, One Direction, Demi Lovato, and countless others. He has won the highly coveted Album of the Year Grammy twice as a producer, with both Adele (for 21) and Taylor Swift (for 1989, the current reigning champion), and he is in high demand by almost every star out there. That doesn't stop him from making his own band a priority, and just recently, the group released its first single in years as the beginning of a new promotional cycle.\n\nLast week, the band took time out of its busy schedule to team up with Motorola to launch two new products specifically designed for smartphones at a free concert: a magnetic speaker that connects to the back of certain phones, and a device that projects the screen’s image onto the wall, cutting down the size of typical projectors many times over. I spoke with the OneRepublic frontman about the group’s process for how they decide to work with certain brands, why Motorola makes sense for them, and what’s coming up for the rest of the year (hint: lots of new music).\n\nSo tell me, what’s going on with Motorola? What is this?\n\nWe did an event with Motorola a couple of years ago. It was in a different country. Austria? I remember the whole time I was bugging the president to give me his phone. It was a prototype of some new phone. Anyway, he never gave it to me.\n\nWe did something with them in the past, and then this was kind of a last-minute deal, just in the last two weeks. Full disclosure, we kind of look for any opportunity to come to New York City. We love New York, and we’re here every six weeks or so. This is kind of a no-brainer for us. Motorola is a company we like and we use. We’ve all owned things from Motorola in the past. Without sounding brand-whorish, we actually genuinely like the company and have used their products.\n\nWe like technology, we’re kind of geeks. Anything that’s new or shiny. I’m the guy that’s buying things on Kickstarter waiting for them to actually come to market. Half the time it’s terrible, like a floating speaker I bought, which sucked. The other half of the time it’s stuff like these products, which are actually functional. We’re techno-dorks. We’re into any type of technology that’s disruptive and that's going to make things easier and better.\n\nSo it’s not just the actual products themselves, it’s the qualities of the company?\n\nIt’s that it’s disruptive. Anything that’s disruptive. There’s a lot of stuff that goes to market all the time. I’m constantly reading Wired and FORBES—I read this month’s issue cover to cover. I’ll find something in one of those articles, and immediately I’m online, tracking it down and looking at the company behind it, to see if it’s a company worth investing in, or if it’s on Kickstarter. Is it something I’m going to actually use?\n\nI love technology. I’m the guy that buys the new phone the moment it’s released. I’ve already purchased two. We’re into that because we travel so much. Technology is our friend. It’s how we record, it’s how we get ideas across, it’s how we communicate. Every new device that comes out that’s disruptive and that’s not just a clone of something else is something that I’ll likely purchase.\n\nOther than if you like a product, how do you guys decide what brands you want to put your name with?\n\nIt would have to be very specific. We have a longstanding relationship with Apple. We’ve played at their launch events before. We’re friends with Tim Cook. We go way back with him. We have to be very cognizant of who we’ve done things with in the past, and what is the depth of our involvement in those things. There’s not a laptop company in the world that we’re going to align ourselves with that’s not a Macbook Pro. That’s honestly how we make all of our music and do everything we do. There are microphone companies that I’ll align with and others that I won’t. There are car companies that we’ll align with. We work with Mercedes-Benz, and we did a two-year campaign with them. When the Mercedes deal came through, it made sense. My wife and I have a G Wagon. Another member of the band has vintage diesel Mercedes.\n\nThe brand partnerships that we’ve had have been as natural as can be. There's always going to be a level of questioning the authenticity of any partnership with a creative entity, To me, both parties have to be serviced. It’s scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours. It has to be natural.\n\nSomeone asked us recently on Twitter what it would take for us to play at a Trump rally, and my answer was, “There’s not enough money in the world, including his entire net worth.” There are certain things where it doesn’t matter what someone does or how much they pay you. It’s whatever feels authentic and natural.\n\nThis kickoff concert with Motorola, is this the beginning of a long-term campaign, or is it just a one-off?\n\nThis is a… We’re rounding first base. Hands are on the hips. Maybe going up the back… We’re leading off.\n\nBrand-wise, any that you’d love to work with?\n\nYeah. A Wheaties box. Right on the cover. Also, I’ve always wanted to be one of the Keebler elves.\n\nI’m absolutely fascinated by Elon Musk for a number of reasons, which I think everyone is, even though he just lost $250 million. I think he’s the king, but I can’t really legitimize a correlation between any band and Tesla or Solarcity.\n\nVirgin. I love Virgin, and I love Richard Branson. I had a dinner with him last year. It was me and a bunch of random online billionaires, hedge funders, Condoleezza Rice, and him. It was completely random. Everyone went around the table and introduced themselves, and there was a lot of humble bragging. It gets to him, and he says, “I’m Richard Branson and I run an organization that is a women’s rights charity. It’s about equal pay.” He didn’t mention Virgin or anything else. I thought that was amazing, and that he was the coolest guy in the room. I read his book too. Anything that is Virgin brand related would be phenomenal.\n\nWe don’t sit around thinking about it. Every now and then you see something and think, “That would be awesome!” If Ferrari ever decided they wanted a partnership, sign me up! We don’t sit around thinking about brands to align with. It happens naturally, or it doesn't. Because of our relationship with Apple, if we do anything that is in direct conflict with that, we’ll email the head guys there and ask if it’s okay. It’s beyond a business relationship now.\n\nYou guys had a single come out not too long ago that’s still growing.\n\nYup, back in May. Hit one million sales two days ago. We’re calling it the teaser single for the album. It’s the fake out. The first song we put out every single album is to test the waters. We’ve done it three times in a row. We test the waters with the most oddball song we have, just to see if it will actually hook, usually achieving about the same level of success as this one has, and then our albums always have the same arc. The next single is way bigger than that, and by the time you get to singles three and four, they’re like the foundation of the album. We’re pretty much doing the same thing this time around.\n\nSo now that this is peaking, what’s next?\n\nNext single is called “Kids,” and I’m obsessed with it. I absolutely love it. It is a true story of me and my disaster of a friend, one of my friends growing up. It’s about being 19 or 20 and the summers in between school and college when you feel invincible and you’re doing whatever you want to with whoever you want, and you feel invincible. You're also sitting around thinking, “Is this as good as it gets? This can’t be my peak.”\n\nThe song is about that youthfulness and those summers in those times, but also as an older person who is not 19, looking back, basically pledging to not be one of those people who lives in the past. It’s kind of an interesting song because it’s nostalgic, but it’s nostalgic at any age. I’ve played it for 15-year-olds and they get all emotional about when they were 12. Now you’re in your 20s or 30s and you think about being 19, and that was pretty awesome, for some people.\n\nFrom there, by the time that song is doing its thing, the album will have been released, and the world will decide what the coming singles will be. We are terrible at picking our own singles.\n\nI don’t know, it’s worked out.\n\nWell, it’s worked out, but when we did our last album, we had “Counting Stars” from day one, and only a couple people in our whole world of opinions were really championing it, but we put other songs out instead. It took about a year for us to reach the obvious conclusion that we should put that one out. Not everyone can be Taylor Swift. However, if you could for a day, you probably would."
