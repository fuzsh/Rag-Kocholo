        "text": "John Abrams\n\nFounder & President Emeritus\n\nIn 1975 John and his family inadvertently landed on the Vineyard. Their arrival marked the end to a wandering back-to-the-land hippie odyssey and the beginning of South Mountain. For nearly a half-century he devoted himself to creating, nurturing, and growing SMCo and a variety of public initiatives, mostly related to affordable housing. He is now retired, works part time in a consulting role, and remains on the SMCo Board of Directors. He lives a life of writing, activism, grandparenting, skiing with family, and travel with Kim, as well as working in their new business Abrams+Angell (in which he particularly works with worker co-op transitions).\n\nJohn is a co-founder of Building Energy Bottom Lines, a peer group network of 60+ Northeast U.S. businesses in the architecture and construction industry. His writings include his book Companies We Keep: Employee Ownership and the Business of Community and Place, which was published in 2008.\n\nAaron Barbatti\n\nSolar Installer\n\nAaron Barbatti was born and raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nIn a previous life, he produced large-scale corporate events and toured with performers Hilary Duff, Tyler Perry, Toby Keith, Trace Adkins, Miranda Lambert, and OneRepublic as a video engineer. In 2023, he transitioned his technical skill set to South Mountain solar!\n\nWhen he's not on the roof, you can find Aaron on the water, catch-and-release fishing – or on Abel’s Hill with his wife Virginia Rose and their three young children: Valentina, Georgiana, and Clayton.\n\nRocco Bellebuono\n\nProject Lead & Co-Owner\n\nBorn in Atlanta to a family of (mostly) very loud and loving Italians, Rocco has been a white water rafting guide, pizza-slinger, sous chef, soccer player and coach. After serving eight years on the board of MV Youth Soccer, Rocco now coaches the MVRHS Girls’ Varsity team. As a member of the Timber Framer’s Guild, Rocco has built timber frame churches, barns and houses around the country. His hobbies include hunting and tracking deer, with his son Gabriel and cooking and serving venison, with his daughter Madia.\n\nDeirdre Bohan\n\nCEO & Co-Owner\n\nDeirdre spent childhood summers in Vineyard Haven. After graduating from Brown University, with a degree in Computer Science, she returned to the island to work a variety of jobs (and briefly bum around the Caribbean) before settling at South Mountain. Since joining our team in 1995, she has inhabited a variety of roles: bookkeeper, founder of our interiors department, COO, chair of our Management Committee and Leadership Team.\n\nLike so many of us, she feels enormously grateful to have spent her entire career in a place that allows her to do her best work, contribute in meaningful ways and share days with friends. As CEO, her focus is on paying these gifts forward.\n\nDeirdre lives with her husband, young son and Australian Shepherd puppy in a restored Oak Bluffs bungalow.\n\nRyan Bushey\n\nDirector of Architecture & Co-Owner\n\nFresh out of his first architecture job, Ryan was encouraged to apply to South Mountain by his friend Steve Sinnett - one of the original SMCo owners. Not having done much research, he swaggered into the interview expressing interest, but only if the company was open to him starting on a carpentry crew and to an concept called \"green building\". John grinned and said \"Yeah, I think we'd be open to that.\"\n\nTwenty years later, Ryan directs the Architecture Department, leads our most complex projects (MV Museum, Island Grown Initiative, MV Community Services), manages sales, and is a member of the company's Leadership Team.\n\nHe holds a Bachelor of Architecture degree from the Wentworth Institute of Technology and is a registered architect in Massachusetts.\n\nEric Cady\n\nCarpenter\n\nEric worked as a millworker, graphic designer, and Brazilian Ju Jitsu instructor before answering South Mountain’s call for a carpenter in 2022. A lover of craft, natural materials, and lifelong learning, he is grateful to have found a community that shares his values and vision.\n\nWhen not at work, you can find Eric painting, sculpting wood or enjoying nature alongside wife Allison, and cats Rumble and Griff.\n\nChris Carroll\n\nEnTech Designer\n\nChris Carroll grew up in Chilmark and still enjoys boating with friends and family in the waters around Menemsha. After work he relaxes by playing music, catching up with friends, or walking trails with his wife and two daughters. With a background in construction, land surveying, and engineering, he’s excited to be part of a team designing solar solutions for our local energy needs.\n\nTim Clark\n\nDesigner\n\nTim grew up surrounded by woodlands in Harwich, the son of a landscape designer and a lavender farmer.\n\nHe attended Boston College and later worked as their Sports Information Director before pursuing a career in architecture.\n\nIn 2019, Tim graduated from Columbia University’s GSAPP. A year later, he, wife Leslie, and their young daughter relocated from NYC to his hometown on the Cape (where a second daughter was born).\n\nTim's brother was the first to spot our job listing and recognize the close alignment between values. Tim filed his application, and the rest is history.\n\nMatt Coffey\n\nProject Architect & Co-Owner\n\nSon of a Cape Cod contractor, Matt grew up as a carpenter’s apprentice. After Wentworth’s Architecture program in Boston and France, he became an associate in an island-based architecture firm. Through the Martha's Vineyard Vision Fellowship he became a LEED-AP and pursued a diverse sustainability education at The Ecosa Institute (AZ), The Glenn Murcutt Master Class (Australia), and with the Biomimicry Guild (Costa Rica). In 2010, he and wife Christine bought an SMCo net zero home where they live with their two children. The experience deepened his appreciation for high performance design and scored him a job. As an architect for SMCo and a committee member for Island Housing Trust Development, he is focused on the legacy of our island's built environment.\n\nPeter D’Angelo\n\nProject Lead\n\n“Married late middle age carpenter seeks ongoing relationship with chiropractor holding Red Sox season tickets, first 20 rows, right field roof deck or green monster. Must have functioning liver.” That’s what he says. We say he juggles more jobs than you can shake a stick at, takes on the tough ones, and keeps all our many Service & Renovation clients (and their houses) happy. He lives down the road with wife Margaret and three kids and boy does he miss them when they’re gone.\n\nJean DaSilva\n\nAssistant Project Lead & Co-Owner\n\nBorn and raised on a cattle farm in Brazil, Jean migrated to Connecticut in 1996. When we met him, he was working for a roofer on one of our jobsites. A hard worker and a fine carpenter, he joined SMCo in 2007 and quickly became a stalwart of our field crew. On weekends, you can find him riding broncs on the rodeo circuit. He loves it when he stays on for the full eight seconds. That doesn’t always happen, but Jean always looks on the bright side, even when he’s eating dust!\n\nMia Esparini\n\nBookkeeper/IT Coordinator\n\nMia grew up splitting her time between West Tisbury and the Philadelphia suburbs. As a teenager, she couldn’t wait to break free from the confines of the island. As an adult, she didn’t feel at home anywhere else. After brief stints in San Francisco, Connecticut, New York and New Hampshire, she returned to the Vineyard in 2019, bringing daughter Ada, husband Mark, and many years of bookkeeping experience, with her. Having grown up the daughter of a woodworker, Mia feels right at home among the sights, smells and sounds of our in-house shop. Beyond SMCo, Mia is passionate about bees, baking and most of all, her family.\n\nNic Esposito\n\nCabinetmaker\n\nNic grew up in coastal Massachusetts, spending most of his time skating in hockey rinks and on ponds. He came to Martha’s Vineyard in 2000 to work on the carpentry crew building his parent’s house. From there, he traveled around for a string of apprenticeships: restoring log cabins in Colorado, touring France with the Compagnons du Devoir, and stair-building in Seattle. On a visit to the island one summer, he met the girl who would eventually become his wife. The two settled in Rhode Island and New Jersey (where Nic set up a small furniture shop), before deciding to raise their children in the place they’d first met. When he’s not at the SMCo bench, you can find Nic at home turning bowls and carving spoons - or laughing/dancing/snuggling with his little family.\n\nAngie Francis\n\nProject Architect & Co-Owner\n\nAngie received her Bachelor of Architecture degree from the University of Cincinnati in 2001 and is a registered architect in the state of Massachusetts. She joined the South Mountain team in 2015, bringing 10 years of high-end residential design and development experience with her. Round our office and jobsites, she is known for her collaborative spirit, passion for modern, regionally appropriate design, and obsessive organizational skills. She resides in Vineyard Haven with her husband James (also an Architect) and two young daughters, Evelyn and Frances.\n\nCurtis Friedman\n\nService and Renovation Lead & Co-Owners\n\nCurtis was raised on a farm in rural Connecticut. After college in New Haven, he served one year in the Army and five in the National Guard before moving to Boston to pursue a career in architecture. Somewhere along the way, Curtis realized his interest lay more in making than designing. He came to the SMCo in 2003 as a carpenter, though we soon found out he was capable of almost anything is to do with tools, wood, and broken houses. When Curtis isn’t making himself invaluable to our Service & Renovation team, he and wife Heidi, produce MV Sea Salt from their homestead just down the road.\n\nSebastian Hiatt\n\nCarpenter\n\nSebastian moved to the Island from Durham, NC on the eve of the pandemic. For three years prior, he worked as a carpenter restoring Victorian-style homes in the city’s downtown. His interest in building houses derives from a passion for making sustainability and craft accessible to everyone. Prior to working in construction, Sebastian fought for similar access to sustainable agriculture, serving as a FoodCorps Fellow in the NC public school system, a Supply Chain Fellow with The Center for Environmental Farming Systems at NC State, and a Food System Finance Fellow at Self-Help Credit Union. Sebastian is grateful for the South Mountain team and its vision. On the days when he’s not supporting our affordable housing and institutional construction efforts, Sebastian can be found making mischief with his sweetheart Indaia, daughters Louisa, Florence and Josephine.\n\nNewell Isbell Shinn\n\nDirector of Production & Co-Owner\n\nNewell grew up immersed in nature, working on timber frames and organic farms and roaming the hemlock and hardwood forests, swamps, and ledges of Hardwick, Massachusetts. Twelve years as a student, planner, and fundraiser at Earlham College, in Richmond, Indiana, steeped him in corn fields, midwestern niceness, Quakerism, and collaborative leadership. A four year turn at the helm of the family timber business back in Hardwick taught him about sales, residential construction, and leading in hard times. Now, Newell coordinates construction for South Mountain and serves on our Leadership Team, always aiming to deepen the soul, improve the economy, and increase the ecological integrity of our shared work. He spends his free time playing with wife Jennie and son Jasper, working with neighbors in Island Cohousing, and eating food grown, gathered, and caught as close to the kitchen as possible.\n\nBeth Kostman\n\nProject Architect, Interior Designer & Co-Owner\n\nBeth is a registered architect who arrived at South Mountain Company after 10 years as a sole proprietor of her own residential architecture firm. She brings to the South Mountain team a broad range of experience and enjoys the diversity that comes with her position. She is involved in multiple aspects of SMCo design work including lighting, plumbing, appliances, cabinets and built-ins, tile, and finishes. Beth also provides many of our clients with complete interior design services, including furniture and fabric selection, window treatment, upholstery, and custom furniture design. A New York City transplant, Beth has lived on Martha’s Vineyard for over 25 years, in a house of her own design, with her two teenage boys, Sam and Nicholas.\n\nJon Lange\n\nShop Operations Co-Lead & Co-Owner\n\nSail boats (specifically the Shenandoah) brought Jon to the Vineyard in 1977 at the age of 19 - just as he was embarking on a quest to see the world by sail. Whilst waiting for a berth to open up, Steve Sinnett brought him round an SMCo jobsite. We valued his talent. Over the next 20-30 years, Jon worked full time as professional mariner. We wouldn't see him for ages, then, in his words “I would show my ugly face looking for work when I found myself stuck on the beach.” When Jon decided to quit shipping, he came back to SMCo for good, bringing a full complement of skills with him.\n\nPrimo Lombardi\n\nProject Lead & Co-Owner\n\nPrimo grew up here on Martha's Vineyard. Working for SMCo in the 90s was his first ‘real’ carpentry job. It didn't work out according to plan that first time, but as life happens, after years of travel, he found himself back on our crew in 2015. This time, we feel sure he’s here to stay.\n\nWhen Primo’s not onsite, he enjoys volunteering, being a father to his boys, a coach, a friend, and staying grateful for all that life has to offer.\n\nPeggy MacKenzie\n\nProject Manager, Production Support & Co-Owner\n\nPeggy began working for SMCo as a carpenter in 1987, just out of college. She moved from job site to shop for a stint of building doors and cabinets, and then moved into the office where she continues to provide product support and serve as project manager of our Service & Renovation team. When she is away from this Island, Peggy spends time on a much smaller island off the coast of Maine.\n\nJake Martin\n\nCarpenter\n\nJake grew up romping around Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains. His love for building started with treehouses and forts. His parents’ rule: “You can fell any tree thinner than your forearm for source material.”\n\nAs a young adult, Jake’s interests veered away from woodwork and toward theatre, music, outdoor education, craft beer, and farming. It wasn’t until 2018, when he built a reclaimed timber frame cabin, that the spark reignited. Jake found a mentor and spent the following years logging, milling, notching, and raising… until his wife Fiona’s yearning for her home island grew too strong to ignore.\n\nJake, Fiona, and daughter Penny & Twyla relocated to West Tisbury in the summer of 2022. Soon after, daughter Twyla was born. The young family is thrilled to be joining the island community, and we’re thrilled to have Jake’s talent on board at South Mountain. Look for his imprint on the next generation of work!\n\nJohn Mazza\n\nEnergy Technology Install Assistant Project Lead & Co-Owner\n\nJohn grew up in Cranston, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his time on the baseball field. In 2010, he moved to the Vineyard and spent six years working in the grocery and distribution industries before joining our solar installation team. Today, John is a veteran installer, working towards his journeyman electrician certificate. Off the roof, he resides in a SMCo house down the road, with wife Sophie, and sons Rockland, Turner, and Bodie.\n\nRob Meyers\n\nDirector of Energy Technology & Co-Owner\n\nRob first heard about the Vineyard from a friend in Seattle. He came to check it out in the summer of 1994, met a girl named Mary and fell in love (with the island and the girl).\n\nHis career at South Mountain began in in the field, where he worked in carpentry, solar hot water, windows, doors and HERS rating, before transitioning into an office-based sales role.\n\nAs Director of Energy Technology, Rob essentially manages a company within a company. His passion, commitment, connectivity, and competence has allowed SMCo to touch the lives of and provide something meaningful for far more people than our architecture and building does. Additionally, his thoughtful service on the NESEA Board and within Amicus Solar Cooperative has extended our reach far beyond the island’s coastline. He also serves on our Leadership Team.\n\nAne Møller\n\nShop Design Co-Lead\n\nBorn and raised in Denmark, Ane earned her cabinetmakers degree from Copenhagen Technical College in 2016. Shortly following graduation, she came to SMCo for a winter internship. In the six months that followed, we fell in love with her creativity and skill, and she fell in love with one of our Trade Partners! Between 2017-2021, Ane and fiancé Nick patiently navigated the United Stated Immigration System while she worked in a shop back home. When the pandemic receded, Ane booked a one-way ticket to MVY and reclaimed her old bench. Look for her modern, Nordic imprint on our next-generation furniture and cabinetry. If not there, you'll find her SUPing or in the Misty Meadow stables.\n\nSiobhán Mullin\n\nDirector of Finance and Administration & Co-Owner\n\nSiobhán hails from Athlone, Ireland. Back in 1994, she and her husband made the huge leap from one island to another and landed on Martha’s Vineyard! Siobhán joined us in 2003 and became a co-owner in 2010 when she realized that her roots had been firmly transplanted. She is one of our most passionate and committed owners, a member of our Leadership Team, and chair of the Personnel Support Committee. She continues to feel grateful for her community of friends at work and on the island that bring joy to her days. She lives in Vineyard Haven with her husband, Patrick and their three sons.\n\nRob Myers\n\nSolar Installer\n\nRob grew up in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and spent summers on the Vineyard. After studying at Connecticut College, he moved to the island full-time in the 90s and started working as a carpenter. He gained experience in every phase of construction, from frame to finish, with a focus on roofing and shingling, and he applies that knowledge to solar installation.\n\nWhen he’s not on a roof, Rob moonlights as a musician, actor, event coordinator, and DJ.\n\nHe lives in West Tisbury with his partner Diana, his daughter Hazel, and his son Leo.\n\nRudy Sanfilippo\n\nEnTech Project Manager\n\nRudy was born and raised on MV until the age of 12. He attended high school in San Francisco before completing his bachelor’s degree in political science at UC Berkeley and his master's degree in Science at NYU. He specializes in energy, environmental policy, construction, and communications, and is deeply invested in the Island community. He currently serves on the Aquinnah Housing Committee as well as the Dukes County Regional Housing Authority Board. In his spare time, Rudy enjoys fishing, running, and surfing. No opportunity to travel is passed up and he loves cooking/eating spicy foods.\n\nNoah Sherburne\n\nDesigner\n\nNoah is a recent graduate of Wentworth Institute’s Master’s of Architecture program and a Certified Passive House Consultant. Prior to joining the team at SMCo, he worked with six architecture firms throughout New England, building a strong understanding of the region’s architectural needs and aesthetics. Affordability, reduced ecological impact, and community improvement are the principles which guide his work.\n\nGrowing up in Maine, he developed an appreciation for the outdoors through camping, hiking, and time on the ocean with his father, a lobsterman. Although he is new to the Vineyard, it reminds him very much of home and he is excited to learn more about the community. His natural sea legs, increased resistance to the cold, and expertise in driving in summer traffic made the transition to the island quite easy.\n\nIn his free time, Noah might be found intentionally lost in nature, taking photos, or saying hello to any dog he sees. He is a proud member of NESEA, the Boston Society for Architecture, and the Architects Climate Action Network.\n\nJack Sipperly\n\nEnTech Sales Administrator\n\nOriginally from southern Rhode Island, Jack spent childhood summers vacationing on the island. After graduating from URI with a degree in Environmental Science and Management, he returned to the family’s cottage to put down more permanent roots.\n\nHis sister, a counselor at Camp Jabberwocky, first introduced him to our work. Eager to break out of his comfort zone/find his place in the world, Jack applied for an EnTech internship in the November of 2021. Six months later, he joined our team full-time.\n\nWhen not slinging panels, you can find Jack surfing the local breaks or wandering the coastline with his girlfriend Mary and a bag full of cameras.\n\nGreg Small\n\nCabinetmeister & Co-Owner\n\nAs a young child, Greg enjoyed exploring the woods on his Huckleberry Hound, while wearing a box on his head. He went on to study forestry, working in construction during the summers. After crabbing on a boat out of Kodiak Alaska (for a captain who became a lifelong role model), he returned home to Connecticut, cleared trees for building sites, worked as an assistant to the Westchester county forester, and broke his foot on the job. While in a walking cast, he met a fine cabinet maker. After 12 years working for that cabinet maker, he discovered SMCo through an article on in Fine Homebuilding, and moved with his family to Martha’s Vineyard. He now lives in Falmouth with his wife and daughter, and commutes on the newspaper boat across Vineyard Sound to our shop. He builds boxes but no longer wears them and the rolling rider has been replaced by a plug-in Kia. He has a serious addiction to perfection.\n\nChris Sterry\n\nCarpenter\n\nChris moved to the island mid-pandemic with his then-fiancé Courtney and their mischievous mutt Wylie. Soon after, daughter Natalie arrived!\n\nBorn and raised in Western Connecticut, he spent summers helping out on jobsites before working as a finish carpenter throughout southern Connecticut, New York City, and most recently, owning and operating a cabinet/furniture shop in Dallas. Chris joins the South Mountain team with a particular enthusiasm for high-performance, socially-aware work.\n\nA self-proclaimed “maker”, he is interested in a multitude of hands-on outlets for creativity and creation. When not on the job, you’ll find Chris biking, playing guitar, or scrolling craigslist for the next tool he didn't know he needed.\n\nChris Wike\n\nProject Lead & Co-Owner\n\nOriginally from upstate New York, Chris' early love of the outdoors led him to study Forestry and Biology at SUNY ESF. Combining his desire to create and his knowledge of trees led him to the craft of timber framing. For ten years, he worked with multiple timber frame companies, to broaden his understanding and hone his skills before returning to the Finger Lakes to work with a small building company run by fellow ESF Alumni. Together, they built small residential homes that employed better building practices with an emphasis on energy efficiency and quality woodworking. An opportunity to dismantle an old barn, repair it, and reconstruct it into a brew pub, became a catalyst for the creation of Revival Timberworks. Chris founded and operated this small business for three years before answering our \"call for carpenters\" in 2013. As a South Mountain Project Lead, Chris values the opportunity to contribute, in meaningful ways, to a community that shares his love of craft, his desire to always do better and his respect for the natural world and all who inhabit it.\n\nRachel Wild\n\nProduction Administrator\n\nRachel was born and raised on Martha’s Vineyard, and after MVRHS, earned a degree in Fashion Merchandising from Fisher College. She loved Boston, but the call of the island was too great to resist. Once back on the rock, it was clear fashion merchandizing wasn't going to take her everywhere she wanted to go, so she turned to the construction trades. Rachel and her three year old son Tatum live in Vineyard Haven in a modular home of her own making. They are both active at Vineyard Montessori, where he focusses on large motor, small motor, and cognitive development, and she volunteers on the fund development and Truckin' MV committees.\n\nAbbie Zell\n\nCommunications Coordinator & Co-Owner\n\nDaughter of a community organizer, Abbie grew up in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley canvassing for whichever local initiative most needed a voice at the time. After graduating from the University of Mary Washington with a BA in Anthropology and Environmental Sustainability, Abbie took up her own torch to coach environmentally-minded students through their first political campaigns. During these years, she learned the art of storytelling, and its ability to bring people together. Martha’s Vineyard was only meant to be stop on the crusade trail, but somewhere in between June and August of 2012, she fell in love with this little island and what its renewables could do in the rig of a wooden sailboat. Abbie now resides in West Tisbury with her boatbuilder husband and takes great pride in telling the story of South Mountain."
