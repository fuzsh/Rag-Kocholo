        "text": "The band OneRepublic is asking for people to donate to a GoFundMe after a wife of one of their crew members was shot and paralyzed.\n\nThe woman, 39, was walking her dogs on Moss Rose Drive in Inglewood around 12:30 a.m. Aug. 8 when a vehicle drove past her, turned around, and drove past her again before stopping, according to the Metro Nashville Police Department.\n\nPolice said the woman told them words were exchanged before someone in the car shot her and then drove away.\n\nPolice said she was shot in the lower back and sustained significant injuries. The motive is still unclear, and the suspects have not been identified.\n\nMembers of OneRepublic took to Facebook to ask people to donate to a GoFundMe to help offset cost of medical bills and moving.\n\nRyan Tedder, the band's lead vocalist, said in the video the woman lost her spleen and is undergoing multiple surgeries.\n\n\"This video isn't about the epidemic of gun violence that exists in this country, which is unspeakable and me physically ill,\" Tedder said in the video. \"This is about helping people that are close to us, that mean everything to us.\"\n\nThe GoFundMe had raised more than $163,000 as of shortly after 3 p.m. on Thursday.\n\nNatalie Allison contributed to this report."
