Each of the children enjoyed a sleepover party at the Dolphins Training Center, where they received their very own twin-size bed and bedding from Ashley HomeStore, decked out with a Miami Dolphins comforter.\n\n“Partnering with the Dolphins gave us a terrific chance to create some magic for these kids,” said Keith Koenig, president of City Furniture, the southeast and southwest Florida licensee for Ashley HomeStore. “The sleepover party on the Dolphins’ training field made for once-in-a-lifetime memories, and their new beds should make a lasting difference in their comfort and quality of sleep.”\n\nThe event hosted by the Miami Dolphins on Feb. 24 was the latest gridiron-themed sleepover for Ashley HomeStore’s international Hope to Dream initiative. The kids enjoyed dinner, toured the Dolphins locker room and powered through fun games and activities with Miami Dolphins players Xavien Howard, Bobby McCain, Rashawn Scott, Kenny Stills and Laremy Tunsil, cheerleaders, Fins Force and mascot TD before a dance party on their new beds.\n\n“It’s a great experience and I’m happy to be here,” McCain said. “Underprivileged kids coming in here and Ashley HomeStore doing a great job providing these kids with beds. With the Miami Dolphins and the league in general, kids are important. It’s not all about football, it’s a lot bigger than that.”\n\nAshley HomeStore, the largest furniture retailer in the U.S., dedicates a portion of proceeds from every mattress sale at participating locations to its Hope to Dream program, which has donated 40,000 new beds and bedding to children in need since 2010. All Ashley HomeStore locations in Miami-Dade through Martin counties in South Florida are active year-round in the Hope to Dream charity’s donation program.\n\nAlso helping bring the South Florida Hope to Dream Sleepover to life were Simmons Serta, Bedgear and Mantua.\n\nMiami Dolphins Re-Sign 6 Former Players Download PDF version\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n***PHOTO/VIDEO CREDIT: MIAMI DOLPHINS***\n\nPhotos/Video: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cfdglwmvzq6x8ma/AADVeZVW89p0o4TPnYX0_FHwa?dl=0\n\nRoster: http://media.miamidolphins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-Miami-Dolphins-Rosters-02.22.17.pdf\n\nMiami Dolphins Re-Sign 6 Former Players\n\nMIAMI – The Miami Dolphins today announced they re-signed quarterbacks Bob Griese and Dan Marino, wide receiver Nat Moore, guard Larry Little, defensive end/linebacker Kim Bokamper and cornerback Sam Madison.
