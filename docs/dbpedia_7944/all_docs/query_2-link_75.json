        "text": "It’s been quite a year for OneRepublic, after being named the American buzz band of 2007, topping Billboard’s Pop 100, breaking the all time USA record for most airplay of any song in Top 40 history and maintaining the #1 spot IN THE NZ TOP 40 SINGLE CHARTS for 6 weeks running (with the Timbaland remix of ‘Apologize’). Now The Frontier Touring Company are pleased to announce that One Republic will still be coming to NZ!\n\nAfter the cancellation of the Maroon 5 concert at Auckland’s Vector Arena, One Republic have decided to treat their NZ fans. The show must go on! The new show at The Powerstation will have very limited tickets available and WILL sell out fast! So get in quick to secure yourself a spot at this intimate event.\n\nTo those who do not know the full story on OneRepublic, they may see a talented pop-rock group propelled to “overnight” success after being discovered by one of the world’s most celebrated super-producers. The band’s first single, “Apologize,” which was remixed by Timbaland, has been Top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 for ten consecutive weeks, rocketing all the way to 2. The song has sold two million legal downloads, maintained a #1 position on the Top 40 chart for two months, and entered the history books by shattering the record for the most spins at radio in just one week with over 10,000 spins. All of which led up to one of the most eagerly-anticipated CDs of the 2007- Dreaming Out Loud – OneRepublic’s Mosley Music Group/Interscope debut.\n\nHowever, explaining away the success of this band as an overnight sensation would be short-sighted and inaccurate. The story of the band’s road to success, and how that journey is expressed in the inspiring lyrical content of their songs, would be lost, as well. Facing opposition and disappointment, OneRepublic has clung to its dreams – and that tenacity is finally paying off."
