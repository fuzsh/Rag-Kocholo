Tim Myers

Los Angeles, CA

Southern California native and founding OneRepublic member Tim Myers is the artist youâve heard but donât know his name. He's racked up hundreds of synchs in TV/Film over the last couple years making him the most licensed solo artist to date. His songs have been featured on commercials for Apple, Google, Target, Macyâs, T-Mobile, Verizon, TV Shows Grey's Anatomy, Ugly Betty, Modern Family, and movies Magic Mike, The Dilemma, Friends With Benefits, to highlight a few. Almost every song on his sophomore album, âThe Yearâ has been licensed in a commercial, tv show or movie. His lead single âHills To Climbâ was featured in trailers for When The Game Stands Tall, The Judge, and several promos for NBC. His previous single âUnder Controlâ reached #68 on the Hot AC radio charts. He has played to packed houses all across the U.S. including making an appearance at Coachella Music Festival and opening up for the music legend Loretta Lynn. âThe Year is a concept albumâ Tim Myers enthuses. âArtists these days release a bunch of singles and call it an album. Each song is a titled a month of the year, song #1 is January, song #2 is February... and it takes you through a relationship for the entire year. I wanted the album to be very orchestrated, every song has strings on it, I brought in a bunch of friends of mine who play violin, cello, viola and I created my own mini orchestra. The album is very cinematic and orchestral.â The album varies widely in tempo and emotion. Songs like January and February are extremely dark with hints of Arcade Fire and in the summer months it becomes more celebratory with psychedelic orchestral sounds reminiscent of Polyphonic Spree and The Flaming Lips. Myers grew up in Southern California, where his dad, an erstwhile hippie- turned-pastor, turned him on to the extraordinary Sixties canon, from The Beatles and The Band to Paul Simon and Jimi Hendrix. He began playing piano at an early age, transitioning to guitar upon hearing Nirvanaâs Nevermind. âI learned every single chord,â he says. âI became obsessed with it. I had to keep it hidden from my parents, because that was an album I deï¬nitely was not allowed to listen to in our household.â At 18, Myers moved to Los Angeles where he co-founded OneRepublic with Ryan Tedder. He spent four years with the platinum-certiï¬ed pop-rock band, playing bass and other instruments as well as co-writing such songs as 2007âs worldwide hit single, âStop And Stare.â The song reached #2 on the US Charts, #1 on the UK Charts, and was certiï¬ed Platinum within a year. But as the band grew more and more popular, Myers discovered that he was not especially interested in the lifestyle and he wanted to explore different musical avenues as a solo artist. The band was touring too much and not creating music and his enthusiasm was for the crafting and creation of songs. As he puts it, âMy favorite part of music is the music.â An amazingly proliï¬c songwriter, Myers writes and records at a shockingly brisk pace, the end result of his breakneck methodology is a wonderfully eclectic sound that crackles with inspired energy, effortlessly capturing that magic moment of creative genesis. "I try to keep my music organic,â he says. âI write and record the mood I'm in that day â I don't try to force something that's not there. I keep the music real, raw, and me."Â While much of his recordings have Myers playing virtually every instrument â from drums and piano to guitar and mellotron â he also revels in artistic collaboration. Heâs partnered with an array of gifted producers, songwriters, and studio professionals, including 4 time Grammy Award songwriter and artist Joy Williams from the platinum band The Civil Wars, multi-platinum artist Ke$ha, singer-songwriters: Lenka, Meiko, Ben Lee and Nikka Costa. âWords cannot express how thankful I am to write songs for a living,â Myers says. âIâm so excited to get âThe Yearâ out there and have people enjoy these songs.â
