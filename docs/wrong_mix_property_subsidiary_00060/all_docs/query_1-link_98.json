        "text": "Trichonomics. I’m quite proud of this term. In the modern age, when you think of a concept the very first thing to do is to Google it and see if anyone has come up with it already. And so when I coined the term trichonomics, that’s the first thing that I did. So far and much to my delight, I am the first to use it.\n\nThe idea behind trichonomics was born out of a throwaway comment by my husband one afternoon. We were out and about, driving around Athens (him behind the wheel, not me) and he said “Have you noticed there are less blondes around since the crisis hit?” I remarked that I had.\n\nSince the crisis first sank its claws into Greece back in 2008, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of blondes in circulation, along with an increase in the length of the female population’s hair.\n\nThis is where the idea of trichonomics comes in, combining the Greek word for hair, tricha, with economics. The concept is as follows — the state of a country’s economy can be gauged by the length and colour variations of its female population’s hair. The shorter and more chromatically diverse the hair, the better the economy.\n\nBeing a Mediterranean country, natural blondes are a rarity in Greece. On my very first trip here during the Athens Olympics and staying with a dear friend of mine, she smirked wryly at the sea of flaxen heads around us as we rode around Athens by bus.\n\nShe herself had just returned to her home country after a rain-sodden hiatus in Cardiff, where we had been students together. “I don’t remember these many blondes when I left. You’d think this was Sweden.” These bottle blondes were locally referred to as Duracell batteries, for reasons that I can’t go into on a blog that my mother reads. Let’s just say the curtains don’t match the carpet and leave it at that.\n\nGreek women take great pride in their appearance. Competition in the aesthetics industry is fierce and as a result, prices for haircuts, colour treatments, manicures and pedicures are quite reasonable. Since the crisis hit, however, Greek women have opted for the more affordable option of letting their hair grow out (pixie cuts are difficult to maintain without regular trims) and reverting to their natural hair colour, also cheaper than having your roots retouched every six weeks.\n\nPre-crisis, my husband’s niece worked at one of the most exclusive hair salons in Athens. She used to relay stories of the rich trophy wives of Athens who thought nothing of getting a full head of extensions at EUR1000 plus at a time that would need to be done all over again in a few months when they started to grow out. These days, there is far less of that sort of extravagance. She could tell how bad the crisis had got by the free time she suddenly had in the salon on Saturday afternoons.\n\nThe effect of my trichonomics theory on the female population of Athens is a notable absence of blonde heads in the general population. I’m also seeing much more long hair than I was before. Among Asian women, a head of long hair is a source of great pride. Various oils and potions are lavished on the tresses and tips swapped over how to make the hair grow stronger, faster, darker. I know of friends whose mothers wept when they chopped their long hair off.\n\nThe power of hair, especially female hair, is well documented throughout history into today. Samson lost his powers when Delilah cut his hair off, and there are religions and sects extending well beyond Islam that require a woman’s hair to be covered. When women experience personal tragedy, they most often take it out on their hair. Good hair days make us feel invincible and bad hair days make us wish we were invisible.\n\nSo it seems only natural then that a woman’s hair be an indication of so many things — how she feels, whether she’s having a good or bad day, and in Greece’s case, the state of the economy she is living in. When Greece’s bonds got a haircut, the female population started cutting back on their own haircuts.\n\nI grew up in Pakistan. In my travels across the world, I have encountered many a misconception about my home-country. We’re everyone’s favourite friendly neighbourhood failed state if Fox News is to believed, and I was amazed at how shocked people were that an actual living, breathing product of the dark side of the moon was stood there talking to them. Here are some of the weirdest things people have said when they learn where I come from.\n\n1) Wow! Your English is really good?\n\nThis is the commonest comment anyone from Pakistan will hear the first time they have a conversation with someone. People are astonished that anyone from Pakistan, let alone a woman, can speak, read and write completely fluent English. The world expects us to either be the frothy-mouthed zealots or mini mart owners they see on TV.\n\nEnglish schooling systems are the main setup in Pakistan where almost the entire curriculum is taught in English and this has created generations of Pakistanis who navigate English with complete ease.\n\nI’ll level with you, my first language is English, but I have Pakistani friends whose English is so dazzlingly competent that they make my musings sound like the workings of an epileptic monkey at a typewriter.\n\n2) Do you guys have TV/the internet/cell phones over there?\n\nEven I ended up guilty of this one when I went over on a trip last year after a 6 year gap and left my smartphone behind thinking there was no point taking it.\n\nCue all of my cousins constantly uploading selfies on Facebook and updating their Twitter accounts like there’s no tomorrow. Meanwhile I felt like a total idiot with my trusty old regular cell phone that didn’t even have a camera. And I’m not even talking the big cities either. This was in my good old dusty village.\n\nSo yes, shocking as it may seem, we do have TV, cell phones and the internet over there. We have roads too, as well as high rise buildings and highways.\n\n3) Pakistani girls are so innocent.\n\nI hate to burst your bubble but this one isn’t true either. What with all the TV, magazines, fluent English and books, life in the West isn’t a total shock. As for innocent, we get Cosmo there too, you know, and just because there is officially no dating doesn’t mean there aren’t ways around that. Go to any Pakistani university and you’ll find a dating culture to rival anything in the West.\n\nAnd we have some pretty kick-ass sex education in places you’d least expect it.\n\n4) Did you come over in a boat?\n\nWhen I’d tell people I had actually flown to the UK, their next question was what it felt like to fly for the first time, at which point I’d gently break it to them that I’ve been flying since I was little. That’s not because I’m ridiculously rich. It’s because Pakistan is quite a big country and flying, especially these days, is quite affordable and often the most trouble-free option for travel.\n\n5) You’re from Pakistan? I love palak paneer!\n\nA Pakistani friend who studied in America shared this one with me. When did palak paneer become Pakistan’s official culinary mascot? That’s like meeting someone from the UK and saying “I love jellied eels!” Firstly, you’d have to be out of your mind to love jellied eels, and secondly it’s not a dish that actually features in regular daily British dining.\n\nPakistani cuisine is hugely diverse because the country is so diverse. Go find your local Pakistani restaurant, it probably has a name like Lahore This or Karachi Something or the Other and try a few things there. I recommend haleem and nihari as starting points.\n\n6) Did you parents disown you for marrying of your own choice?\n\nI married outside of my culture, and my parents didn’t simultaneously combust into balls of fiery wrath. You’d be surprised how many of my peers back in Pakistan are now marrying of their own choice with the support of their parents.\n\n7) Did you ever see Osama Bin Ladin?\n\nWhen you come from a crackpot nuclear nation and hot-bed of terrorism, you get asked this more often than you’d realize. The answer is no. We have a huge home-grown terrorism problem in Pakistan, that’s true, but Taliban heads don’t go on whistle-stop tours of the country like some sort of jihad loving Mick Jagger.\n\n8) Did you used to live in a mud hut/shanty town?\n\nNo. I used to live in an actual house made of bricks and cement. A lot of people in Pakistan do, and if you happen to know the upper Middle classes, their houses are absolutely palatial. In fact, a lot of people moving from Pakistan to the UK take one look at that country’s row upon row of cramped, badly lit cookie cutter houses and wail “How can these poor people live like this!”\n\n9) How come you don’t wear that dot on your forehead?\n\nThat little dot is called a bindi and you’re thinking of India, pal. Pakistani girls do wear these at weddings and parties, but for their decorative value rather than any association with chakras or the sacred third eye.\n\n10)I’d love to visit Pakistan, but I’m too scared.\n\nLet me be honest here. You should be scared. Because trying to get a visa from the Pakistani embassy is such a Kafkaesque nightmare that even I left the building screaming “I’m not doing this again!” after trying to arrange paperwork for my foreign husband and child.\n\nThe line of questioning involved such valuable information towards my application as whether my husband had converted to Islam or not, and what sort of religious environment my child was exposed to at home, the answer to which is of course “None of your God damned business”.They made it so hard and complicated that you’d think Pakistan was the world’s premier holiday destination and therefore only the truly dedicated should be allowed to go.\n\nThen once we got there, because we had foreigners in our party, my family got daily phone calls from the local police to make sure said foreigners were still in our possession and weren’t being given an impromptu tour of Waziristan courtesy of our good friends in the Taliban.\n\nBut seriously, if you can get past the hellish ordeal of actually securing yourself a visa, tourists in Pakistan are such a rarity that they are treated like royalty. If you keep a low key and observe the customs, you’ll experience a beautiful country as yet untouched by mass tourism.\n\nUPDATE: I’ve changed the pic to one which I own since this post is soon to be featured in Freshly Pressed!\n\nThis is the story of how I ended up sitting in a cafe, sniffling away my tears of indignation and drinking my first ever frappe.\n\nI should interject here by telling you that I don’t drink coffee. So living in Greece for all these years without having ever had a frappe to call all my own makes me somewhat of a freak and this event was entirely out of the ordinary.\n\nGreeks only drink tea when they’re ill, European style with no milk in it. I used to get asked all the time with concerned looks if I was sick whenever I would ask for tea. We would be in a group and the conversation would go something like this:\n\n“What are you all having?”\n\n“Frappe”\n\n“Frappe”\n\n“Frappe”\n\n“Tea”\n\n“What’s up? Not feeling well?”\n\nI’ve already written about the world outside Athens, and it was my pleasure recently to experience it once more through a new medium when I took a trip to Volos using Greece’s intercity bus system, KTEL. Getting up bright and early at 5am, I jumped in a taxi and headed to the KTEL station to catch the 7am bus.\n\nEarly morning Athens has a funny way of inducing a strange sentimentality in me. Coasting past the empty streets in the blue early morning light, sun-flecked clouds dappling the sky overhead, I felt like I live in the best city in the world. Those few moments when Athens is gearing up for a brand new day are like watching a baby asleep.\n\nKTEL buses are quite a convenient way to get from city to city, and if you’re a solo traveller, it works out cheaper than going by car counting the cost of tolls and petrol.\n\nThe night before, I had called the KTEL office and placed myself on the passenger list for the bus to Volos. I paid my return fee at the ticket counter, €47, and asked to go onto the return passenger list for the 6pm bus. The lady in the booking office tapped on her keyboard and assured me my place was booked.\n\nBefore long, we were on our way. Since my last trip, the rolling countryside outside Athens has changed. Summer in Greece makes the land absolutely burst at the seams with life, a rich tableau of the best of everything. The wheat had ripened and turned golden, most of it already harvested with tracks of straw marking where heavy heads had once swayed with the breeze.\n\nSwathes of deep green marked where the corn was growing. This is where my favourite beach side treat of corn cobs roasted over coal comes from. Whenever I visit the beach, I always carry a little pot of salt and chilli powder to rub onto the hot, roasted corn with a lemon sliced in half.\n\nThis is how I was raised eating corn, South Asian style, and my husband has come to love my version of it. That tangy, spicy, sweet taste mingled with the creaminess of the corn and the charred aroma of the charcoal is one of the markers of summertime for me now.\n\nAs we ran along the route, weaving through villages, towns and highways, Golden Dawn graffiti competed with anti-fascist slogans scribbled along walls and streets. A common form of sabotage by the anti-fascist factions is to change the last letter on the end of the Greek for Golden Dawn, Χρυσή Αυγή, into Χρυσά Αυγά, Golden Eggs, the name of a popular Greek egg supplier.\n\nThe bus continued on its lumbering way, making various stops here and there. Until the first stop two hours into the journey, most of the bus was asleep. After that, having freshened up, stretched their legs and had the second or third frappe of the morning, lively chatter filled the air.\n\nThe woman behind me began to grumble to her travelling companion. “If I had known we were going to stop at every single little goat village on the way I would have driven!” she complained.\n\n“The woman at the ticket office told me it was a direct bus, and they told me the same thing when I called the call centre to book my ticket.”\n\n“Christ and Mother Mary, we’re stopping again? Don’t they have local buses here?”\n\n“Who are we picking up now? Are we going to stop on each and every little donkey path?”\n\n“We’ll never get to Volos at this rate.”\n\nShe said all this sat two rows behind the driver, for maximum effect, I’m sure. The bus braked suddenly, horn blaring, as a dark red pickup truck pulled out of a dusty olive grove and began reversing down the road towards us.\n\n“Well of course,” snorted the woman “We’re in his God forsaken village, he can do whatever the hell he likes on this road and so what if he kills the rest of us.”\n\nHaving occupied a seat in the very first row, I was able to take in the route from nearly every angle and began to think of the nesting swallows I had seen on our pit stop. Swallows herald the arrival of Spring in Greece and they nest in the summer season. The roadside cafe where we had taken our break had been full of little black birds gliding and diving, searching for things to feed their precious offspring tucked cosily into their mud and straw nests.\n\nA dull thud interrupted my thoughts as one of these unfortunate little birds ended its life journey on the bus’s windscreen, a small, liquid streak the last remaining mark of its existence on this earth. Poor little thing. How quickly life can change.\n\nArriving in Volos had been straightforward enough. Getting back? Not so much.\n\nI’ve never travelled by bus between cities in Greece before. I made the gravest mistake one can make when living in a foreign country and that’s to take things for granted. Had I just moved here, I would have scrupulously checked every detail of my trip. Too many years down the line have given me a false sense of security.\n\nSeeing that my ticket had RETURN written across it, plus the full return fare and the morning’s assurance that my seat on the return bus was booked, I assumed that this was my return ticket. So I waited with the other passengers in the sweltering heat, looking forward to being back home by bed time. When I handed my ticket over, the inspector told me to go get a return ticket issued from the booking office.\n\nSay what? Wasn’t this the return ticket? No. So I walked over to the ticket counter and presented my ticket, asking for the return half. “The 6pm bus is fully booked.” snapped the man behind the desk.\n\nImpossible, I told him, I had booked a place just this morning.\n\n“All reservations are cancelled 25 minutes before departure.” he replied, indifferent.\n\nHere’s a note: if you have any Northern European traits about how practical issues should work, abandon them all when it comes to Greece. My mind suddenly went into Northern Europe mode, a throwback after 10 years of living in the UK and an utterly useless mental state in Greece. I remained adamant. I had booked a place, so there must be a seat for me.\n\n“It doesn’t matter if you booked a place, all reservations are cancelled 25 minutes before departure time.” he said, clearly annoyed that I was still badgering him. Where did I think I was, Sweden?\n\nI couldn’t believe what I was hearing, so I begged and pleaded to be let onto the bus, but they must get this all the time, dummies like me who didn’t know how the system worked, so they really couldn’t care less that I was stranded there for another three hours.\n\n“There must be some way!” I cried “I have a baby at home! I need to get back on this bus!” There. I had played my last ace, the Holy Mother card. Surely my status as the mother and the fact that there was a 10 month old baby in Athens that I was still nursing would move them.\n\n“What do you want me to do about it?” he grumbled.\n\nSo there went my seat.\n\nI’ve been having a hard time lately dealing with Hermes’ condition, so little blips like this completely floor me. I burst into tears, completely panicked at being stranded all of a sudden so far away from home. I don’t like being away from home at the moment, and the thought of the cosy lights of my little flat burning like a lighthouse while I was stranded out to sea made me cry even more. But more than anything, my pride was hurt that I had made such a rookie mistake.\n\nThe harder I cried, the worse I felt, until the tiny voice of reason handed me a crumpled tissue and said “Well, you’re always complaining how you have no time to yourself, so now’s your chance! You can surf the net for 3 hours uninterrupted! You can go through as many pages of LOLCats as you like and no one can do a damn thing about it! The internet and all its time wasting treasures are yours for the taking!”\n\nAnd so, blubbering and sniffling, mascara streaking my face, I found a café close by with internet access to write this and decided what the hell, every single time I have travelled in the last month, it’s gone completely wrong, so why not just start over and get a frappe, maybe there’s something to be said for Greece’s obsession with it.\n\nWe are all doomed to make the same mistakes again and again until we learn our lesson and try something different, so this was my way of saying “Look, Universe, things could not be any more different. Have you ever seen me drinking frappe before?”\n\nThat’s how it came to be that I sipped on my first frappe and frittered away three more hours until the next bus departed at 9pm. This time, I made sure I was first in line and pounced on my seat for the four hour trip back to Athens and home, an eerie blue light bathing my fellow passengers’ faces the whole way.\n\nAt 1.30am I stumbled into a taxi to go home. “What happened?” asked the taxi driver, “The bus got in pretty late, we thought you had broken down or something.”\n\nI slumped into the back of the taxi. It had been 20 hours since I had stepped out of my front door.\n\n“We stopped at every little goat village on the way.” I replied.\n\nOh Brazil, Brazil. What went wrong?\n\nWe can sit around all day analyzing the match, Brazil’s behavior, accusations of over-lenient home referees and the mistake of building a team around one or two players, but all of this can be very simply explained using one key take on the issue, a thoroughly Greek perspective belonging to a very specific niche.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, today I give you Brazil’s defeat explained in tribute to my Greek grandma.\n\nFirst some background. Yiayia, that’s Greek for grandma, is sadly no longer with us. She was my husband’s grandmother, an incredible, formidable woman who was four feet tall and as tough as nails. She made it to almost 100 years old. She was the classic twinkly eyed, rosy cheeked, adoring grandmother of fairytales. Every summer she would reside in her own house in Larissa, and every winter we would drag her to Athens, kicking and screaming, to spend winter with the family, which she despised as it cost her her independence.\n\nGreek grannies are great. They do anything for their grandkids. A local radio station is currently running a contest inviting users to take a selfie with their Yiayia dressed as a rock star. And I know that those Yiayias will let themselves be dressed up without complaint.\n\nShe was not my actual grandmother, but she was my number one fan and would repeatedly tell me never to give up, that I could achieve anything I wanted to. She gave me a lot to believe in and some precious life lessons in the brief few years I had the privilege to know her. Whenever anyone else asked for her recipes, she claimed to have forgotten them, but she always gave them to me.\n\nAs I watched the goals rain down on Brazil, a thought flashed through my mind and suddenly it was as if Yiayia was sat on the sofa with me, smacking her gums, slapping her knees and saying “Those poor kids. It’s the mati. All that talk about success ate them up in the end.”\n\nI will now tell you how Brazil’s defeat can be explained, as understood by Greek grannies everywhere.\n\nTwo Greek Granny theories would have combined to produce the results that we saw. The first is that of the mati, the evil eye. The cult of the evil eye is found in many countries, including Greece, where rituals on how to remove it vary from village to village, even from family to family.\n\nThe evil eye is generated by several things. This could be envy, jealousy, an overly enthusiastic compliment or genuinely wishing bad luck to befall someone. Brazil would have attracted copious amounts of evil-eye producing bad energy in the buildup to the world cup. Brazil is an emerging market, a strong presence in the international finance markets, but not exactly dripping with money.\n\nThe extortionate price tag of hosting the world cup, combined with a lack of addressing issues such as poverty and corruption, has generated a lot of bad feeling at home. Winning the world cup at home would have gone some way in compensating this, but now things are about 324% worse. The price tags on a lot of the match tickets were well out of the reach of ordinary Brazilians.\n\nMy husband who has travelled extensively in the country, found it strange how the crowds at the football matches seemed to be almost universally Caucasian. Live in a favela? They’ll be knocking that down to build a stadium. Thanks for that! But if you think you can afford a ticket, keep on dreaming.\n\nIf not responsibly removed, the mati has to manifest somewhere, either making you feel unwell or bringing you bad luck. So there we have the first Yiayia element of Brazil’s superbly bad performance – they had banked some serious evil mati points.\n\nThe second element is that, Brazil being Brazil and everyone expecting them to win and so they got eaten up by their own good luck. My Greek Yiayia would have said this: they got eaten up by all the big talk. A simple phrase exists in Greek for this – tous glosofagane – but not in English. There is no exact translation, the closest I can come is to say that when you glosofao someone, you have cursed them with their own good luck by talking about them.\n\nA bit hard to grasp, but if you’re Greek or Catholic you’ll get this straight away. This is why we’re always told not to show off, not to laugh too much and not to go on about how happy we are in case it attracts talk.\n\nSo there we have two very Greek, very granny elements, the mati and being eaten up by all the talk about you, which combined into a kind of supernova of bad energy and resulted in a game that was sensational for all the wrong reasons.\n\nAnd that’s the results as interpreted by a Greek granny. If any sporting pundits out there are looking to hire me, I’m all yours.\n\nLast Monday I celebrated Eid ul Fitr. I knew it would be Eid on that day because I took a look at my diary and saw that the new moon was falling on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile for my family and friends in Pakistan, Eid was delayed until Tuesday. It’s a peculiar phenomenon, one that I didn’t realize the strangeness of until my husband pointed it out in one of our early conversations together.\n\nI was telling him that Eid that year would fall on one of two days. “How’s that possible?” he asked. I, in all honesty and ignorance, answered that it was because the new moon was visible on different days in different parts of the world, and until the imams saw it, it wasn’t Eid. On hearing this delightful nugget of misinformation, he justifiably fell about laughing. I’m embarrassed myself to even share the story.\n\nMy husband’s reaction, though, is the right one. In Pakistan, like so many countries, the start of Ramadan and Eid are not declared until the new moon has been officially sighted by the religious authorities. Following this system, the imams have been known to board flights (at whose expense?) to rise above the cloud cover and see if they have spotted the new moon or not.\n\nIf they have, good for you, one less day of fasting and time for a well-earned feast. If they don’t, tough luck. They put the faithful of their countries through one more needless fast just so that they can hold on to their own short-sighted beliefs and the mystical sense of power that comes with it.\n\nEvery single year, the situation is the same. Half the Muslim world celebrates Eid on one day, the other half on another, all because the imams couldn’t get their timing right (it’s true that the thin sliver of a new moon is not visible for very long or easy to pick out in the twilight) or, more simply, didn’t just confront a lunar calendar.\n\nThanks to science, we know exactly when Eid falls every year forecast into an infinite future. At any single moment in time, we can pull up lunar charts online and know well in advance when every major event connected to the lunar calendar falls. And yet, the religious authorities refuse to make use of this readily available resource and put their flocks through needless trials for no reason.\n\nThis is not just an inconvenience. The majority of the Muslim world is poor. People work exceedingly hard, not letting up pace even when going without food and water for 18 hours in some parts. For them, Eid is a much needed break from the daily grind, one of the very few days they get off in the year and an even rarer chance to indulge in some festivities and time with loved ones.\n\nWhy put them through the extra trial of not knowing, for example, when they can travel to visit their loved ones? What, really, is there to be gained from delaying these small joys for one more day?\n\nI suppose it once again comes down to these very people. That lunar calendars stretching into the distant future are something that even exists is not information that everyone is privy to. It’s through these people that the imams hold on their power. They know that to these people, their ability to declare the most important dates of the Muslim year has a magical power, making them appear somewhat superhuman. What good is it being the authority figure in a religion if anyone can go and find out on their own when Ramadan, Hajj or Eid is every year?\n\nI for one think it’s about time that this system changed.\n\nIslam is the religion that was once respected the world over for its medical and scientific advancements. Muslim scientists and astrologists were among the most advanced and respected in the world. How then, when we have the gift of science that is ingrained in the makeup of the religion, has this situation remained?\n\nIt’s a rule of life that those who don’t adapt and evolve are doomed to suffer the consequences. We live in the 21st century. It’s time the imams caught on to this.\n\nToday is the first World Duchenne Awareness day, held on 7 September (7/9) for the 79 exons that make up the dystrophin gene, and I thought I would share a little of what it’s like to have this disease in your life.\n\nMy son Hermes is now 3 and a half. Just this week gone, he started being able to hop. This was a big deal for us as a family. We have taken pictures and videos, sent emails and text messages to friends and family to mark it. For Hermes, his clumsy little hop is a huge achievement. Having DMD means he’s not able to do the ordinary little things that other three year olds are able to. If we hadn’t had his diagnosis the way we did when he was just 13 months old, around this time is when I would have started to get suspicious that something wasn’t right. Why can’t he run like other kids, why can’t he bound up and down stairs like the other kids, why is he getting tired so fast.\n\nSo what’s it like living with DMD? I can only tell you my perspective as a parent until Hermes is old enough to share his own story.\n\nDuchenne is a complex disease, and at the same time very simple. My child’s muscles don’t work in the same way as other people’s. Instead of springing and stretching with every movement, they rip and tear. His little body looks like he has been at the gym all day when we’re at the beach. His thighs and calves bulge and are rock hard – bodybuilders would kill for his physique. I look at his body, and I feel angry. It’s not right. A 3 year shouldn’t look like that. When nature plays her dirty tricks, she really does not mess around.\n\nHermes gets tired quickly, so I have a double pushchair to take him and his brother out and about. I shrug off the comments from well-meaning old ladies “A big boy like you sitting in a pushchair? You should be walking!” When he makes new friends, I tell their parents outright about his condition. Sometimes I am too blunt. I would rather the people that find it too difficult to back away now than for Hermes to get fond of their child and for them to then disappear.\n\nDuchenne in your life means watching your child all the time for signs that the deterioration has set in, celebrating his successes and trying to ignore the little voice in the background saying “Sure, he can do that now. But for how long?” It’s weeks and weeks of anxiety and sleepless nights building up to consultant and cardiologist appointments, gritting your teeth, wondering to yourself Will this be it? Will this be the appointment where we start to hear the bad news? Because no matter what you do, there is not a damn thing that is going to stop that bad news from coming one day. One day it will all start. The steroids are not far away, and I will have to watch the beautiful, delicate features of my child’s face melt away into the moon face that is one of the many unavoidable side-effects of this treatment.\n\nI am not able to get through one day without Duchenne’s ugly facing popping into your head at least once. Some days it’s not so bad, some days it’s the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing when I go to sleep. It’s hearing about the demise of other children all too soon and too unexpectedly and wondering where the bullet is waiting for you in this game of Russian roulette – will your child be one of the exceptional ones to make it past 30, or will he be snatched away before he even gets to 13?\n\nIt’s also though a new perspective on life, how short and beautiful it is. It’s doing things now because you know your tomorrows are limited. It’s thinking “Why not have chocolate for breakfast?” and planning journeys you really can’t afford so that you can teach your child he can go as far as he wants and to accept no limitations.\n\nIt’s tireless work shoe-horned into your daily schedule to make changes where you live, for your child and all children with a disability to be accepted, for the government to pay attention, for Big Pharma to listen to your voice shouting “My child deserves to live!” It’s meeting some incredible doctors and scientists who are working tirelessly to bring an end to this condition.\n\nAnd we are so close. This is the first time in history that the researchers working on DMD believe the breakthrough will be achieved within a decade.\n\nIt’s not easy to imagine what it’s like to be the parent to a child that you are likely to outlive, and I’m not asking you to put yourself in that position. I am asking you though to talk about us. We are here, we want to be heard. You might be reading about Duchenne here for the first time, or you might be familiar with it already. Spread the word and help us in our race to a cure.\n\nAs I watched the success of the ALS ice bucket challenge, I came up with my own little way of spreading awareness and raising funds for DMD and I invite you to join me if you like. I call it the DMD Chilli Challenge. Take a spoon (any size) of chilli sauce (any brand) and make a video of yourself eating it. Then wait 10 seconds before drinking water. In this way we’re trying to show that time is precious and raise awareness for DMD. If you want to help, have some fun with it and spread the word.\n\nToday, think of my son Hermes and all the other children like him. They cannot run very fast or very far, but they are in a race against time. Join us, carry them on your shoulders, and help us get to the point where the next parent who gets a diagnosis for DMD and asks what the treatment is doesn’t have to hear “There isn’t anything that can be done.”\n\nIn case you didn’t know, there is something of a slow-burning revolution going on in Pakistan right now. After years of taking crap from the political elite, the public is finally starting to turn on them.\n\nHere’s what it’s like to be a politician in Pakistan (or indeed anywhere). You tell a bunch of lies, you stir up the public, you get into office and live a life of absolute luxury while the people around you go hungry. You exercise absolute authority over everything. You are never on time, you rarely pay out of your own pocket and the laws don’t apply to you. You quite literally get away with murder. Then when you’re getting old, you pass the baton on to your kids.\n\nSometimes things go wrong and the army steps in, kicking you into a life of even more luxurious exile overseas, where you weep into your silk bed sheets every night thinking about the millions of poor Pakistanis you could be exploiting, if only they’d let you back into the country dammit. To make yourself feel better, you get hair transplants. This is to demonstrate to the people of Pakistan that you feel their pain, because hair transplants are painful, get it?\n\nYou worm your way back into Pakistani political life, rig an election, fool the public again and c’est la vie.\n\nExcept this time it’s not working out that way. I just got done watching a video filmed by a passenger on an internal flight in Pakistan that was delayed for two hours waiting for a politician to board. When he finally showed up, he was hounded off the plane by the furious crew and passengers, shouting “How long are we going to put up with this in this country?”\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how big a deal this is. This would never have happened even six months ago. Slowly, the tide is turning against the powerful elite. The people are finally finding their voice and social media is playing a huge part.\n\nA few weeks ago I was watching footage of some demonstrations that turned into riots as crowds gathered demanding the PM’s resignation. My Greek husband was watching with me and without thinking he started to give a critique of the Pakistani public’s riot technique. Riot attendance is as natural to Greek teenagers as going to rock concerts. Whether they like it or not, they grow up with an in-depth knowledge of what to do during a riot.\n\nIf it’s one things Greeks love, it’s to see other people in the world rise up and kick back against authority. They’re not doing that much better on the political front, but as I’ve said when they riot, they take no prisoners.\n\nWhich brings me to the title of this post.\n\nDear People of Pakistan,\n\nMy Greek husband has been watching your rioting with much interest in the last few weeks. In case you were unaware, rioting is Greece’s national sport, and they are top of the line at what they do. The rioting public of Greece would like to extend a helping hand to the rioting public of Pakistan, with the following targeted benefits:\n\nAnalysis of riot patterns and tips for improvement\n\nCustomised design of amateur riot equipment and seminars such as molotov cocktails 101, 20 items you didn’t know you could use as missiles, how to use your Grandma for cover and more\n\nGaining a stronger public image by strategies such as riot mascots. In Greece, we have Kanellos the dog.\n\nTear gas management – lemon juice, milk, motorbike helmets are the tools you need to laugh until you cry in the face of authority.\n\nBonus – the most efficient riot spread strategies; burn only the businesses you need to and save time\n\nIf you are interested in employing our services, we would be glad to help out. In return, you can teach us how to make those effigies you seem to be so good at making. We’re struggling to get Samaras’ big head just right.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Rioting Public of Greece\n\nI just finished reading a fascinating book by Jenny Nordberg, The Underground Girls of Kabul. This was one of those rare books that makes your heart ache when you come to the end of it, hoping against hope for a happy ending, but knowing that the reality is probably a lot bleaker.\n\nNordberg stumbled across the phenomenon of Afghanistan’s bacha posh by accident. These are girls that are dressed up and passed off as boys, sometimes as an act of rebellion by their family, sometimes out of necessity in a patriarchal country where the demand for a male child is absolute and all consuming, and sometimes for the magical properties that having even a pretend son can instill – after a streak of girls, a pretend son is thought to induce an actual son to be born.\n\nThe book was often hard to read, and it made me reflect on all the parallels I experienced growing up in a patriarchal society.\n\nLet me start by saying that Pakistan is nowhere near as bad as Afghanistan when it comes to this sort of thing, but it is still pretty bad. I am one of four girls. I spent my childhood watching people commiserate with my parents. “Four girls?,” they would say, genuinely upset for us “Don’t lose heart. The next one might be a boy.” It’s only by sheer good luck that I was born into a family that invested in its female children and cared about their future to the point that they made the extremely difficult decision to move to the UK just so that we would have a fair shot at an education and a career.\n\nIn doing so my father sacrificed his own career and position as a professor of surgery at a respected medical school – literally a lifetime’s effort – and it’s a decision I am grateful for every time I walk out of the front door without a second thought.\n\nGrowing up in an extremely patriarchal society is not easy if you have been born into the wrong gender. Boys in Pakistan are prized above all else. Even extremely educated women will not rest until they have a son. It’s their one and only goal in life. When a boy is born, much celebration goes on. Sweets are distributed and the mother is smothered with love, attention and praise.\n\nWhen a girl is born, absolutely none of this occurs. Children are extremely perceptive, and I was aware from very early on that I didn’t belong to the ‘better’ gender. I saw it in the faces of the new mothers we would visit in hospital, sitting morose next to their unwanted female children. It made me angry. I heard it in the condolences to my parents about only having female children. I saw it in the little boys who were trained from the moment of their birth to have an enormous sense of entitlement. No matter how much of a front I put on, it used to burn me to my core when I’d hear them chide “You can’t do that, you’re just a girl.” Their obnoxious and inflated egos were fueled and encouraged by their obsessed mothers.\n\nIn turn, the girls were groomed from early on to be pliable and manageable future wives. Their personalities were squashed and smothered, not allowed to develop. They were not allowed to have opinions, laugh loudly, shout or fight. They were to be presented to the world as blank canvases. Needless to say, they were very boring.\n\nAs a child I have memories of sobbing my heart out at the weddings of vivacious cousins I was particularly fond of, knowing I was about to lose them. I knew the drill well enough. Very few of them came back out on the other side of marriage with their personalities intact. The majority did what they had to to survive the marital home and joint family system and disappeared into a featureless mask of neutral emotions and expressions.\n\nThe injustice of the system used to drive me to fits of rage. It didn’t matter that I was a wanted child by my family. Society had made it clear that I would always be second best.\n\nThe bacha posh of Afghanistan existed in Pakistan too. From time to time, you would come across a female child dressed as a boy and encouraged to have male mannerisms. Here’s a secret I never shared with another soul until I put Nordberg’s book down yesterday:\n\n“Do you know,” I said to my husband “That until I was around seven or eight, I thought I would grow up to be a boy?” I used to use that thought to console myself. Don’t get me wrong, being a natural born drama queen, I was quite fond of all the trimmings that came with being a girl.\n\nBut I also hated being reminded of my weakness as a female. So I used to think to myself that it was okay, because one day I would be a boy and then I’d get to see what it was like on the other side. The realisation that this wouldn’t happen wasn’t gradual. It was sudden. One day, just like that, I realised the notion was ridiculous, impossible, and then it felt even more unfair that I was born a girl.\n\nComing from that sort of society to the UK was positively paradise. It was also hard. When the opposite gender are gradually separated from you, you learn very little of them. I was 14 when we moved to the UK and went to a co-ed school after my convent-run all girl’s school.\n\nOn my first day, the teacher searched the class for a spare seat and found one next to a boy. I crammed myself into my chair as far as I physically could to put as much distance between the two of us as I could – heaven forbid we should touch. I was mortified and on the brink of tears when a girl offered a spare seat next to herself, which I gratefully accepted. Those types of reactions make me realise what a sick and messed up system it is to segregate genders so severely that when you finally meet, it’s so upsetting you freak out.\n\nIn a segregated society like Pakistan, where girls and boys are kept so strictly apart, strange things can happen. On one of my trips back when I was 17, I met up with my old school friends in their college. They were updating me on their lives, and showing me pictures of a recent stage show the college had put on. Each class had to present something. Several of my friends had dressed up as the Backstreet Boys. We laughed over the pictures of them in men’s clothes, the exaggerated poses and the goaties drawn on with kohl pencils.\n\nOne of my friends then told me that during the show, some of the other girls had become obsessed with her. They wrote her love notes and sent her presents, asked her to pose in photos with them while she was in costume with her arms around them. It seems that where the natural teenage impulse to meet and flirt with the opposite sex is so heavily repressed, even a fake teenage boy is better than no teenage boy at which to direct these feelings. This friend continued to receive notes and presents well after the show.\n\nWhen I read Nordberg’s book, I realised that beyond a certain age I had never stepped out of the house alone. I had grown up subconsciously trained to avert my eyes, walk less tall and shrink my form. I automatically and seamlessly slip into this mode on visits to Pakistan. I even do it outside of Pakistan every time I walk past a group of young men. Don’t attract attention, eyes down, head down. It happens without me even thinking, and at 32, I wonder if I can train myself out of it.\n\nMoving freely in the world is a privilege and a gift you aren’t aware of unless you have not had it before. Moving away for university was ridiculously exciting, and I still remember my first unaccompanied train journey. I knew that it was the thinnest of turns in destiny that separated me from my present life and the alternative.\n\nAs I have grown, however, I’ve once again began to feel the weight of my gender. As a woman, I can expect to be paid less and my opinions not given as much weight in my professional life. I can be expected to put my career on the back burner while I raise a family. I will get asked about my childcare arrangements at job interviews – it happens every time. Nordberg very eloquently points out that even in the West, women in the arena of men must dress, act and talk like men. She must wipe out her femininity to succeed.\n\nFinishing the book was hard. It’s one of those books that you can’t walk away from. It will be on my mind for days and weeks as I wonder about the protagonists. Meanwhile, the world over, little girls are being born and tears of sorrow are being shed at their arrival. I have two sons of my own now and I am raising them as best as I can to consider all people, male and female, as equals. One day I may have a daughter. I wonder if she too will still be pondering these same issues further down the line?\n\nUPDATE: I tweeted this blog post to Jenny Nordberg, author or Underground Girls of Kabul and she tweeted back! She has forwarded my story to the main character of her book, Azita. I am so touched that she reached out to me and shared my story on her own twitter feed. Please drop by www.bachaposh.com to learn more.\n\nLast week, courtesy of one of the companies I’m currently freelancing with in Athens, I got to attend the Europe edition of TBEX 2014.\n\nIt was another event that made me feel my age and the fact that I was firmly on the wrong side of 25. Not so long ago, I was asked at an interview why I didn’t have an Instagram account. At the risk of shooting myself in the foot here in case the person who asked me this is reading (hi!) the real reason I didn’t have an Instagram account until recently is because I have no time. The average selfie takes 16 minutes to perfect. If I had 16 free minutes lying around, I can think of a lot of other things I would be doing with them.\n\nAnyway, suitably chastened, I now have an Instagram account. What I don’t have is a MacBook. I was absolutely surrounded by these at TBEX, while I bashed away at my trusty old Toshiba. It’s nearly 10 years old now. It’s not stylish and weighs a lot, but it gets the job done.\n\nFor those of you who don’t know, TBEX is the world’s largest travel blogger exchange. I admit, I had no idea it was beforehand. It was a strange experience finding myself among so many bloggers, and it had me wondering – at what point will the travel market become saturated? How many more accounts of twenty somethings travelling the globe does the blogosphere still have room for?\n\nPlenty, it would seem. I’ve always loved talking to the well-travelled and picking their brains about their experiences. At TBEX, I met people who had been all over the world, and heard outlandish figures like 3o countries in two years, 100 countries before I turn 30, and so on.\n\nI listened with interest, and the question I found myself asking again and again was “So have you been to Pakistan?” The reply I kept getting again and again was “No”. The only person who responded in the affirmative was a Turkish doctor who had not only been to Pakistan, but had spent a month in my God forsaken hometown of Bahawalpur in 1990. By even more freakish odds, he had studied medicine at Nishtar college, Multan, the very same college that my own father studied at. I couldn’t get over it. There are seven billion of us on this planet, but sometimes it feels so small.\n\nBack to my question, I was sitting at one point with Laurence of Finding the Universe fame, and I asked my standard question. He hadn’t been to Pakistan either. He asked me “Is it beautiful?” I answered truthfully “It’s stunning. It’s one of the most beautiful places I have ever lived in.” Because terrorism, corruption and general misery aside, I honestly have not lived anywhere more beautiful than Pakistan.\n\nThen he asked me “Is it safe?” I tried to reassure him that if you stick to the right places, it’s perfectly safe. Someone with blue eyes and waist length blonde dreadlocks would be best off avoiding the less well-trodden tracks of the land. Did I succeed in convincing him? I’m not sure, though he did say he likes a challenge, in answer to which I told him to Google the Kalash tribe of Pakistan. Not only are they a photographer’s dream come true, they are located in an area that is hard enough to get to even for Pakistanis, let alone foreigners. So, you want a challenge? There you go.\n\nIt is a little sad. Back in the day, Pakistan formed a trinity of countries that had to be visited along the hippie trail – Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. At TBEX, practically everyone had been to India, and no one had been to Pakistan, at least no one I met.\n\nI’m not saying you’re not a true traveller if you haven’t been to Pakistan. I’d place the country somewhere in between North Korea and Syria. Travellers get major brownie points for having a North Korean stamp in their passport, but you would have to be mad to want to visit Syria at the moment. Somewhere along this compass of major street cred and absolute insanity would lie a visit to Pakistan.\n\nThere’s a Greek presenter called Mayia Tsokli. She used to present a travel show on the now-defunct ERT TV channel. She used to go absolutely everywhere – she even did one show from Afghanistan. A travel show. For Afghanistan. Who does that? No one except her, probably. But even she didn’t go to Pakistan. We’re like the South Asian travel arc’s booby prize – nobody wants us.\n\nIf travel is all about broadening horizons and pushing boundaries, then travel bloggers reading this, you should go to Pakistan. Seriously, email me if you want to find out more. If you can get past the hell of getting a visa, it’s totally worth it.\n\nIt’s a photograph that could be found on the wall or mantlepiece of any poor Pakistani household. The couple stand rigid, staring at the camera, dressed in their best clothes. Photographs are an expensive luxury for the poor of Pakistan, so they have invested in their appearance for this one snapshot. They are young. The woman in pink, her hair carefully brushed and wearing a pink beaded jewellery set, holds on to the arm of the man in a light grey striped kurta.\n\nThey stare at the camera, unsmiling. Smiling in photographs is considered undignified, and this photo is tellingly aspirational. It speaks of a life they would rather be living, a dignified life, one where they have time to take photographs in their best clothes with a lake of swans behind them. The superimposed background could be anywhere, Switzerland, or maybe Austria. What it isn’t is their grim reality, the daily grind of bonded labour at a Pakistani brick kiln. They will never see that swan lake, because they are too poor. They will never see it, because on November 4, 2014, the couple were murdered.\n\nWhat I’ve not told you up until now is the real crime of these two people. They were Christian, and they were in bonded labour, which they tried to question. Pakistan has a terrible track record when it comes to minority rights and incidents like these are not uncommon. At the start of the first Gulf War, an American nun who was the headteacher at my local school in Bahawalpur was gunned down.\n\nYears later in 2001, gunmen broke into the school’s church and opened fire. Thousands of miles away, I watched the news reports in complete shock. There was the aisle I had walked down as a bridesmaid. There were the church grounds I had played in. It was the country’s first massacre of the Christian community.\n\nThe reason this particular case has made global headlines is because it was so inhumane, so barbaric, that it defies belief.\n\nIn the early hours of November 4, after an announcement by the local religious leaders that the couple had desecrated a copy of the Quran, around 1,000 villagers in Kot Radha Kishan descended on the couple’s house and tore through the thatched roof to get to the terrified couple. According to the family of the couple, the order came from the owner of the brick kiln.\n\nThey were dragged from their house. Shama Masih, whose name means ‘light’, was thrown into a frenzy of utter darkness, utter hopelessness. She was already a mother to four children, and awaiting the birth of another child. This didn’t matter to the crowd that set upon them.\n\nOn unfounded accusations of blasphemy, the couple were set upon with such barbaric intensity, that a friend of mine Fe’ereeha Idris, who reported the story and has seen a lot in her career, broke down in tears along with her crew when they heard the details.\n\nThey were beaten, held over an open kiln until they caught fire and then thrown into the kiln. All that’s left of them are some bones and ash. The police watched as it all happened. No one intervened. I should probably say the police ‘allegedly’ watched, but if I know the reputation of the Pakistani police force, it’s more likely that they did in fact do absolutely nothing about it.\n\nIn Kot Radha Kishan, the streets are now quiet. The men of the village have fled, leaving the women and children behind. They had the courage to defy God’s own law by taking another life in the most cowardly way, but they don’t have the courage to face the aftermath of what they have done.\n\nNo one came to the aid of Shama and Shahzad Masih. Their family continue to shed tears and try to comfort the four children left behind. If I know how these things play out in Pakistan, nothing will come of this. The Chief Minister of Punjab made a hollow gesture and visited the village where the incident took place. The people will not be caught, they will not be punished.\n\nA society that cannot protect its most vulnerable citizens is a society that should be ashamed of itself. Pakistan should be ashamed, and as a Pakistani, I am ashamed. People took to the streets, they protested, I wrote a blog post, and then? We’ll all forget about this story and carry on, until it happens again.\n\nI didn’t want to write this blog post. My stomach turned as I read the details of the incident. But I can’t get their image out of my head. I see them again and again standing in front of that beautiful swan lake, hoping for a better life. That’s why I decided to write this story. I want you to remember their names, Shama and Shahzad Masih. They deserved so much better than what life dealt them. I know it probably won’t make a difference, but I hope mine will be one more voice of outrage. Maybe, for once in their shambolic history, the government of Pakistan will do the right thing.\n\nThe report, in Urdu, by Fe’ereeha Idris is given below.\n\nhttp://tune.pk/player/embed_player.php?vid=4981608&folder=2014/11/11/&width=650&height=350&autoplay=\n\nIntercultural marriages are a real eye-opener. It takes longer to find common ground, your comfort foods are not the same and you both have weird cultural habits. The first time I served my husband halva puri with mango pickle for breakfast and he didn’t like it, I was horrified. Who doesn’t like halva puri? It’s the breakfast of kings! Likewise he can’t understand why I don’t like smothering all my food in lemon juice and accompanying all my meals with a chunk of feta.\n\nThe best thing is to find a middle road and muddle along it. But a helping hand is always appreciated. First, a disclaimer. The Asian I refer to means South Asian – Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan etc. I know some parts of the world use the term for other nationalities.\n\nHere are 10 things you need to know about your Asian wife:\n\n1) The black stuff\n\nAsian women love this look:\n\nAs a result,you’ll find this everywhere, all over all your bathroom surfaces.\n\nWhat is it? That’s kohl powder, and it’s the one beauty product your Asian wife would take with her on a desert island.\n\n2) Hair oil\n\nWomen all over the world went ballistic when various beauty companies released this rubbish:\n\nThat’s hair oil, and we’re not impressed. Your wife’s hair oil collection probably looks more like this:\n\nThat’ll contain olive oil, almond oil, coconut oil, argan oil, various types of brand oils like Vatika and Dabur and whatever else she felt like concocting. Each oil has a separate function. When she’d mad at you she’ll use this:\n\n3) Nice kitchen bro, did you budget for tin foil?\n\nSpent a bomb on a lovely new kitchen? Great! Once your Asian wife gets her hands on it, she’ll turn it from this:\n\nInto this:\n\n*I set this up to take this picture, though I did used to do this until my husband won out and stopped me. I’m going to leave it looking like this until my husband comes home just to see his look of shock and horror.\n\n4) Fancy toiletries\n\nWatching your wife mix and create lotions and potions from sandalwood powder, white clay, rosewater, tumeric and chickpea flower (really!) you’d think we all come born with degrees in chemistry. Why do you think so many of us are pharmacists.\n\nKiss goodbye to this:\n\nSay hello to this:\n\n5) Copper pans and fancy cookware? Forget it.\n\nDo you own a set of these?\n\nYour Asian wife will probably promptly replace them with these:\n\n6) Spice collection\n\nWhen I first moved in with my husband, his spice collection could be counted on one hand. This was still impressive for the average Greek household that cooks with salt, pepper and oregano.\n\nNow our spice collection looks like this:\n\nEven I was a bit surprised when I saw it all together like this. Your Asian wife doesn’t have a spice rack. She has a spice cupboard.\n\n7) Rice wars\n\nThe first thing your Asian wife will do when she moves in is throw out any rice that isn’t basmati. There is no other rice in the world except for basmati. Don’t fight it.\n\n8) Cooking for non-natives\n\nWhat to her is this:\n\nTo you is this:\n\nThe slow destruction of taste buds with atomic levels of spice is something that takes years to master. You’ll get used to it over time.\n\n9) The body beautiful\n\nYou didn’t think your Asian wife just fell out of the sky with that baby soft skin, did you? Body hair removal is a constant process in the Asian woman’s life, one that takes up hours of time and conversation. Finding the perfect wax sends her into fits of excitement. No matter how much we try, we’re rarely on top of it. To fight this battle, your wife’s wax collection looks like this:\n\n10) Time for a cup of tea\n\nYour Asian wife can cure nearly any trouble with a cup of tea. This will go:\n\nIn it’s place will come this:\n\nTip: if she’s mad at you, make her a cup of tea. She’ll get over it faster.\n\nOverall, marrying someone outside your culture is a steep learning curve. Tackle it with a sense of humour.\n\nIt’s a lot easier to get into university to study journalism than it is to get into university to study law.\n\nThis is what I’ve been thinking as I listened to the Serial podcasts the last two weeks. Luckily for me, I only discovered that the podcasts, currently the most popular podcast in history, existed about two weeks ago when I read a piece about it in the Guardian, so I didn’t have to wait three months to reach today’s final episode.\n\nI started to listen. It was the audible equivalent of standing by the fridge at 1 am shoveling chocolate cake into my face. I didn’t want to, but I couldn’t help myself. I couldn’t stop. I was addicted, and the more the approach to the podcast disturbed me, the more I was unable to stop listening.\n\nThe Serial podcast bothered me on more than one level. For those of you who don’t know, it goes over the murder of Hae Min Lee on 13 January 1999. The ex-boyfriend was eventually convicted and got life, though admittedly even to a lay person the case was not put together well, and Adnan Syed’s lawyer was disbarred soon after.\n\nPeople keep saying what a good podcast it is. What does that mean, exactly? While the subject matter has been interesting, let’s not forget how utterly sad it is at the same time, and in my opinion it has been badly executed.\n\nFirst, it’s what I consider some pretty messy journalism. Maybe they teach journalism differently in the US, but I remember a particularly rabid professor, whose classes we all dreaded at Cardiff University, who insisted that you should never be a part of a story. There is no ‘I, me’ etc. That stayed with me unless I’m writing a personal column, or of course, this blog.\n\nWith all due respect to Sarah Koenig, maybe she never thought Serial would take off the way it did. I know from my own experience that I tend to be a little sloppy when I’m writing something I don’t think a lot of people will read. The one post on this blog that went viral was littered with mistakes, because I knocked it out, sent it into the internet and didn’t think any more of it until it clocked nearly 80,000 views. I have many other examples of less-than stellar efforts on my part (you could say my entire career in journalism is quite less than supernova levels, which is why my laptop is committing suicide, but that’s another story).\n\nAren’t we, as journalists, supposed to remain impartial witnesses? It disturbed me that Koenig seemed to so easily take sides. But there were other things that upset me. Here is a terribly sad story, the loss of a brilliant, intelligent, beautiful, funny and kind young woman, a case of possible miscarriage of justice, more than one family torn apart, presented as entertainment. We’re invited to guess along about who did it, and Reddit users have taken this gauntlet and run with it to freak-show proportions.\n\nNext for me is the issue of libel. So many years down the line, people’s names have been dragged up again, which would be fine except that we live in a digital age. Not only have avid fans gone on and published ‘tours’ of the key places involved in the murder, they have tracked down people who took part in the podcast. Creepy doesn’t even cover it. Then there are the Reddit theories, which start placing blame on nearly everyone.\n\nI’m not going to act like I was above it, I’ve also joined in, listening and thinking way too much about it, changing my mind every week about guilt or innocence. There is an episode talking about the case where potential jury members are asked to tell the judge why they should be excused from jury duty on the grounds of inability to remain impartial, and I caught myself thinking ‘I’d have had to do that, being a Pakistani muslim, I’d have had to get myself excused too.’ It’s sad times when we live in a culture where absolutely everything can be packaged up and sold as entertainment.\n\nWhatever happened and wherever the case may go next, this was not journalism. This was entertainment, and we were all hooked. A sad reflection on us. It was also an irritating podcast to listen to at times, and I kept catching myself thinking “The BBC wouldn’t have done it this way.” There was so much pointless banter in between, about shrimp sales, giggling over retracing routes, that I would thinking that considering the gravity of what they were investigating, why weren’t they a little more respectful? The whole Valley girl way of talking, littered with ‘likes’, ‘OMGs’, ‘rights?’, the cadence of sentences rising at the end into a question, I didn’t think grown women talked like that.\n\nI listened to the last episode today. Do I think the person currently doing time is guilty or not? For what it’s worth, here’s what I think.\n\nI don’t care.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, the fact remains that a wonderful human being died in terrifying circumstances. All that light, all the promise, the liveliness of her words from her diary, which I don’t know why we were read extracts from, snuffed out. Hae Min Lee was an example of a great person, someone who would have grown up to make a real contribution to the world around her. In the last episode we learn that she made such an impact on her final boyfriend who she dated for only 13 days before her disappearance that he says she changed him forever.\n\nShe had the assertiveness and self respect to leave a culturally doomed relationship at just age 17. I know grown women in relationships that are dead-ends, where the other half’s family don’t even know they exist, or refuse to acknowledge they exist, sometimes even after marriage and children. Or women who are happy to accept whatever little shreds of love are thrown their way, existing on the sidelines in contrast to the other, official, culturally approved wife. Here was a teenager who decided she was worth more, and respect to her for considering her own worth in that way.\n\nMillions of people now know her name, and sit picking apart the details of her death over their dinner. Yes, really. How offensive to this young woman’s memory and to her family.\n\nIf anything should be learned from Serial, it’s that some territory is sacred. Koenig is not a lawyer, she is a journalist, and by her own admission, she isn’t even a crime reporter or investigative journalist. Given this, I doubt she should have gone trawling through this story, or at least approached it differently.\n\nI got the feeling today that Koenig felt the criticism about her taking sides had caught up with her, and she tried to be a bit more vague in her ending.\n\nNext week we’ll have all moved on to something else, but Hae Min Lee’s family is still missing a beloved daughter. The Innocence Project is now involved, and I really hope that they will finally be able to lay this case to rest. That’s their job after all, and what they were trained for.\n\nEarlier today, I spoke to Andreas Tolaros age 64, a Greek national who was on board the Norman Atlantic.\n\nHe kindly gave me 20 minutes of his time to talk about his experience of what happened on the boat and how the disaster unfolded. Despite his ordeal, he was courteous, calm, and even made a joke or two.\n\nIf you would like to use extracts of this interview, you are free to do so as long as correct accreditation is given. This is what he said:\n\nWhat was your reason for going on this journey? Were you going for work or a holiday?\n\nThis was a holiday trip. I was with a friend, taking the car up to Austria.\n\nWhen did you get the first indication that something was wrong?\n\nI woke up around 03:00 am, and sensed a funny smell in the cabin. I had to open the door and then I saw smoke in the alley, so I started warning the people and shouting that there was a fire. I woke up my friend, took a few belongings and went up to the deck, where quite a few people were already aware of the situation, mainly the people who weren’t sleeping in cabins but spent the night in the lounge area.\n\nCould you tell me what type of vessel it was? I’ve heard that the Norman Atlantic doesn’t usually serve this route, that it’s primarily a vehicle carrier. Some people have said that it was quite a shabby boat. What was the impression that you had of it?\n\nIt is. Actually our tickets were with the Hellenic Spirit, a proper ferryboat which is able to carry a certain number of trucks and cars, and passengers as well. But when we got to Patras (this is the port where the journey started from) we saw this boat which was a fairly old looking boat. I’ve been told that it’s been converted to be able to carry passengers as well. Cabins were very very small, and it really gave me the impression that something is going wrong, something is not right, which was confirmed when the problem occurred. Nothing was functioning, the alarm system did not function, the emergency equipment was inadequate, lifeboats didn’t work.\n\nDid you get any kind of assistance from the crew? I’ve heard that things were very chaotic and that the crew were not assisting. Was that your experience as well?\n\nThe crew to start with was mixed, Greeks and Italians. That was actually a problem. When the fire started, of course there was a panic. Some Greek crew members were trying to help. The second officer and some staff from the restaurant, they tried to manage the panic, though to be honest there wasn’t much panic.\n\nPeople were mainly quite calm. I have to say that the truck drivers really helped the people to stay calm. We all stayed calm till the end. I left the boat on Sunday at 23:00, I and my friend were rescued by the helicopter. People were waiting. Assistance from the crew was adequate.\n\nTalking about the rescue operation:\n\nThe rescue operation started late, I don’t know why. There have been rumours that the captain did not inform the authorities early enough, so the rescue effort started quite late. Yes the weather conditions were terrible, but mainly we the passengers were trying to solve the problem ourselves.\n\nWere you all gathered on the outer decks?\n\nYes.\n\nWas there any part of the inside which was usable?\n\nNot at all. In a few hours, everything was on fire.\n\nHow did you cope, because it was extremely cold and raining?\n\nWell, we used the penguin method let’s say. We just gathered all together, those who were dressed heavily were protecting the rest, and we were shifting and changing around, 20 people together to keep our bodies warm as much as we could. We were trying to find places that were away from the fire and away from smoke, gather all together there and warm up our bodies. The cold was tremendous. I mean, there were people with T-shirts on.\n\nDid you have any supplies on board at this point?\n\nNot at all. What supplies? Nothing, nothing. I was without water and food for 18 hours. I eventually just found a bottle thrown on the floor and I ate half a banana which I picked up from the floor, in order to put some nutrition in my body. That was it, there was nothing.\n\nWere you airlifted off by a Greek or Italian helicopter?\n\nItalian. I’ve heard that the ship was under the Italian jurisdiction. Twice there were two Greek helicopters, and then they went back to Corfu for refueling, but the bad weather went towards Corfu so they couldn’t take off again. Mainly the rescue was from the Italian air force.\n\nI don’t know if you’ve managed to see any of the accounts of the other passengers. The Greek soprano Dimitra Theodosiou gave quite a harrowing account of the rescue, saying it was very chaotic, there was pushing and shoving by people to be saved first. Her words were that there were a lot of foreigners on the boat shoving and pushing to the front of the queue who didn’t give priority to women and children, is that something you saw?\n\nSomehow they used the right top deck on the boat as the helicopter rescue point. There was a Greek and an Italian crew which was somehow organising the evacuation. The evacuation started first with the children and women. I didn’t notice those scenes, maybe I was under such stress that I didn’t notice. People say that they were evacuating the Italians. Yes, there were Italians speaking Italian to the rescuers there, well, to be honest under those circumstances, I would say that in my view things were calm. I expected it to be worse. The Greeks were very, very calm.\n\n[side note: Ms Theodosiou’s account, located here, talks about Turks and Arabs pushing and shoving her out of the way several times. How she was sure of their nationalities at that time, I don’t know. I give no endorsement of her comments, just presenting what she said]\n\nSo your personal experience was that people were not shoving and pushing others out of the way to get their turn sooner?\n\nNo. I wouldn’t say that. I’ve seen more shoving and pushing in a bank actually! Under those circumstances, things were moving okay. Everybody wants to save their life, but not in an ugly way. It was under control up to the moment that I left, because the evacuation continued all night long.\n\nWhat kind of injuries did you witness? When the passengers were disembarked at Bari, some people looked very battered, there was an elderly gentleman with bandages on his feet which the commentators said were from burns.\n\nThat I think happened on Monday, because the sea was calmer so they changed the evacuation. They started disembarking people through a rope ladder from the side of the ship. Because of the winds there were some minor accidents happening there. Some people fell off into the boats, some fell into the water and were rescued.\n\nThe whole time I was up on the deck, watching the evacuation by helicopter, nothing happened then.\n\nDescribing what happened once they were evacuated:\n\nWe were taken to the airbase in Lecce, Italy, and from there we received aid. We were offered clothes from the military, and then we were transferred to the hospital there.\n\nHow did you get back to Athens?\n\nBy the Hellenic air force. That was on Monday night, we took off from Lecce to Bari and from Bari we took off around 20:00 and got to Athens around 22:00.\n\nAs you said the truck drivers helped quite a lot. We’ve been hearing them speak on Greek TV saying that they’re worried about their colleagues who might have slept in their truck cabins. Did you hear anything like that around you?\n\nYes I did. Because some of the truck drivers, yes they do that. I presume they buy the cheapest ticket, and rather than sleeping on a chair, on those big trucks they have their own bed there. They only use the cabins for taking a shower and go and sleep in their vehicles. I’ve heard that some of them preferred to sleep in their cars rather than sleeping in those shitty rooms.\n\nThe rooms were very, very small. The whole ship looked like – this is a ship to transport cars, but why don’t we squeeze in a couple of rooms, add a bar and a kind of restaurant, and convert it into a cruise ship.\n\nIs there any other information you would like to add about your experience?\n\nAs I said, as a survivor, I thank the Greek and Italian air force, which really looked after us, and the courage and the help that the truck drivers managed to give to all the passengers. The rest, apart from one or two Greeks from the crew that tried to help the passengers, the rest was a disaster.\n\nThank you so much for your time, I wish you a speedy recovery and a happy new year.\n\nI am going to have a happy new year, be sure of that!\n\n* UPDATE*: Mr Tolaros wants to personally thank the Italian air force crew that rescued him and has requested help in tracking them down. They are pictured below (Mr Tolaros is the gentleman in the middle also dressed in army clothes provided from the air base) If anyone can help identify this crew, please email me at omaira.gill@gmail.com so that Mr Tolaros can extend his thanks.\n\nAthens’s central squares on Thursday night were transformed as Greece’s major political parties jostled for position in their final major public rallies before Sunday’s election.\n\nIn a scene so ironic it seemed for a moment to have been set out on purpose, the current centre-right government party of New Democracy was forced to share Syntagma square with the Communist party, KKE, albeit at different times of the day.\n\nLess than a mile away lies the run-down square of Omonia, situated in a severely neglected part of the city plagued by drug use, rough sleepers, prostitutes, petty criminals and shabby buildings. It was here that the left-wing Syriza’s Alexis Tsipras chose to hold his political rally.\n\nTens of thousands of people crammed into the square that is usually deserted after dark to hear his rallying cry of the coming of hope and change in Greece and Europe. Once a fringe party, Syriza’s lead in the 2012 elections caused total panic with their hardline stance against austerity.\n\nThen, no one party had been able to form a government, leading to a second round of elections in the same year. In the space between the two events, spooked by rumours of a Grexit if Syriza came to power, voters backed off and their lead slipped.\n\nThis time, with the markets reassured about the possibility of Greece leaving the Eurozone, things are different. In a country as austerity weary as Greece, limping along exhausted with no finish line in sight, the voting public has put its weight behind Syriza more as a means to punish New Democracy than out of a real belief in Syriza’s promises.\n\nAusterity, much despised by the Greek public, was meant to offer a way out of the country’s financial mess. Instead, several years down the line, things are barely any better. In the last few years, Greece has received a total of EUR 227 billion in money from the EU and IMF. No other nation has received as much in the last few years.\n\nDetailed analysis of where the money went, showing that 32% went to paying maturing debt, 19% to Greek Banks recapitalisation and 16% to interest payments, only added fuel to the fire.\n\nSince 2008, the country’s economy has shrunk almost 25%, with the Greek stock market losing a whopping 84% of its value. Unemployment rose to 26%, millions of Greek households were dragged below the poverty line and the birth rate declined while child mortality rose.\n\nThe austerity measures imposed by a troika of the IMF, EC and ECB turned a European Union country into a shadow of its former self, and this outcome is what Syriza and other parties like it latched onto to propel themselves up the opinion polls.\n\nIn December 2014, after failing to satisfy their latest demands, the troika had given Samaras’ government an extension to the bailout terms into early 2015. With presidential elections scheduled for February, this presented a problem to the current prime minister who was seeking to show the public the success of his plan while still in office.\n\nIf the parliament of Greece fails to elect a president after three rounds of voting, Greek law states that general elections must then be held. If this scenario played out after the troika’s next bailout meeting, Samaras would have to walk away without any of the glory of being the leader that brought Greece back from the brink of disaster.\n\nSo he took a gamble and brought the presidential election forward to December, thus triggering early elections in the process.\n\nThe public response was immediate, and Syriza led the polls from the beginning by a margin of around 3%. The last polls, released last Friday, showed that the lead had widened to 6%. As of Saturday, Greek law prohibits any more polls being issued and calls for all campaigning to cease. This window of silence, the eye of the storm, is meant to allow the public time to reflect and make up their own minds without being swayed.\n\nIn a country where 22% of the voting public is aged 70 and over, Syriza’s campaign has stood out. It has been slick, modern and heavily sold the message of hope in response to New Democracy’s increasingly panicked scaremongering.\n\nSyriza’s electorate is by and large under 30. Their campaign has embraced social media, and their campaign website is in both Greek and English. Greece’s disillusioned youth have embraced them with gusto. They have set social media alight with various hashtags, including #ftanei, meaning enough in Greek to voice their frustration at the decimation of their futures, and #sexyAlexi in homage to Syriza’s charismatic leader.\n\nTheir problem in the eyes of nervous lawmakers and economists in Europe, however, is the same anti-bailout stance that has rocketed them to popularity.\n\nNo political party has so far offered a viable alternative to austerity, Syriza included.\n\nI spoke to Kevin Featherstone, the LSE’s Eleftherios Venizelos Professor of Contemporary Greek Studies and Director of the Hellenic Observatory who said “Greece needs further debt relief, of some type, in order to help the return to growth and avoid crippling constraints. More and more economists would recognise that something of this kind is in the interests of both Greece and the euro-zone.”\n\n“The other agenda is of the need for domestic structural reform to improve the efficiency and effective of public administration. This last agenda is one that has been inadequately taken up in Greece and one that SYRIZA seems to oppose. But it is crucial to enabling Greece to converge more with the EU and to become more competitive. Without this second agenda, the credibility of Greece’s claims on the first are seriously undermined.”\n\nThe world’s media have descended on downtown Athens, awaiting the first poll results which are expected to be available from 21:00 on Sunday night. Over 800 journalists from around 76 media outlets are in the city to cover the events as they unfold. As the world watches, this tiny Mediterranean nation that sent waves through the financial markets will wonder if Monday morning will see them counting the cost of their gamble.\n\nLast year, I wrote an article on this blog called 10 Things Not to Say to someone from Pakistan. I’d pitched it to a few outlets with no success, so one night I uploaded it on this blog. I shared it once on my Facebook page, checked the stats and saw it had 19 views and went to bed, feeling pleased. That number of views wasn’t too bad for an article I had left up for an hour.\n\nThe next morning, my inbox has exploded with emails and my stats had shot to over 1000 views. By the end of three days, they’d reached 30,000, and that one article currently clocks over 80,000 views. It’s consistently the most popular article on this blog. I’d gone viral completely by accident.\n\nIt’s a strange feeling, being suddenly thrust into the limelight like that. As the comments poured in, it felt like I’d opened the door to the Internet and there it was, streaming past me. There was the praise, the criticism, the guy calling me a whore, the other guy calling me a slut, someone else saying I was a fake, a spammer telling me how much money their cousin made online WORKING FROM HOME, and everything in between.\n\nIt was utterly bizarre. At that point in time I was in the middle of a bad patch with my anxiety and depression, being in the spotlight and especially the voices telling me what a useless human I was were too much for me, so I quite literally went and lay down, and waited for my temporary fame to pass by.\n\nEventually it did.\n\nThe same thing happened to me again last week. Last Wednesday, I was commissioned to write an article from the USA Today. The article had been my idea. I wanted to get an in-depth face to face with Yanis Varoufakis, Greece’s new finance minister. I’d laid the article out in my head. With such articles, I like to set the scene and describe little details. I also noticed that as a regular blogger and user of twitter, Mr Varoufakis often ends up posting corrections to articles or things misinterpreted. I wanted to give an article to the reader in his own words so that they could get to know and learn about the policies of the man with what might just be Europe’s toughest job.\n\nI got on it straight away, trying to track Mr Varoufakis down across Thrusday, with little success.\n\nI was still pondering my next move on Friday morning, answering follow up emails from the USA Today asking whether I had managed to get a hold of him yet, when someone posted a story from the New York Times. There was the article, the profile, very much along the same lines as I had planned to write the USA Today article.\n\nI was frustrated. Who could they have possibly contacted that I myself hadn’t tried to reach already? I didn’t get it. I then noticed that Mr Varoufakis had some recent activity on his blog and twitter accounts. Perhaps there was a tiny chance that he’d still be at his computer, so I decided to tweet him. I sent him two tweets, one of which was this:\n\nBy the afternoon, I’d received several emails from various Greek TV channels asking to talk to me, and that’s when I realised that I had for some reason become a Greek tabloid story. The journalists that wrote about me had found online pictures from a photo shoot I had done years ago for a friend, Vishy Moghan, and used those in the article.\n\nAt first it was funny, and I gave a few telephone interviews hoping the whackiness of my approach might eventually open the door to Mr Varoufakis and the article I wanted to write.\n\nVery quickly, it stopped being funny when I paid closer attention to the context in which I was appearing. Article after article condensed my 10 year career as a journalist, the door knocking, the rejection, the building contacts from zero, the failures, the losing faith in myself, the bloody hard work it has taken for me to get to where I am today, all of this was boiled down by the tabloid press to: “Pretty journalist tries to get an interview with Varoufakis. Fails.”\n\nI then made the time-honoured mistake of reading the comments on the article, and there it all was again. She’s a poser, she’s a fake along with a bunch of racist comments about my ethnicity and how I try to hide it, plus that there seems to be no evidence of me as a journalist.\n\nNow I owe nothing to the trolls, but here goes. To those of you who have been so quick to judge, here is my online portfolio of articles.\n\nHere is my LinkedIn profile that lists my education and qualifications.\n\nAnd you’re reading my blog, where I have never hidden the fact that I am of Pakistani and Indian origin. Nor have I made it into the be all and end all of who I am, because it’s not relevant to whether I do my job as a journalist well or not. The pictures used in the articles about me were utterly irrelevant to my work as a journalist. They were a casual photo shoot done for a friend, and used without his consent. I speak Greek, not perfectly, it’s a beautiful and complex language that I came to late in life, so I’m bound to make mistakes.\n\nOn Friday night I spoke again to the press officer of Mr Varoufakis. Somewhere in our conversation, he asked if I was the person who has made it public on social media what a big fan I am of Mr Varoufakis and how badly I want to meet him.\n\nThat’s when I understood that if ever I had a chance of getting my serious interview with Mr Varoufakis for the USA Today, it’s now probably dead in the water. If his own press officer has me in his mind as a fame-hungry social media personality, the chances of him ever agreeing to an interview just dropped like the price on a Greek 5 year bond this week.\n\nI deliberately went into print journalism because I didn’t have any interest in being a broadcast journalist. I love words. I have a passion for writing, I’ve wanted to be a journalist since I was 11. In the last 6 months, after 10 years of work, that goal has at last come within reach.\n\nOn Monday morning, I have agreed to appear on SKAI TV’s ‘Tora’ current affairs programme. If that sounds contradictory, it is.\n\n‘Are you sure?’ my sister in law asked me. The comments about me online had already been less than generous. Did I really want to get on live TV and stumble through a Greek interview. I’ll take my chances. My Greek used to be a lot better, but two small children mean I am usually sleep deprived, and in among work, childcare and the constant worries about my older son’s condition, there’s little room left for correct Greek grammar.\n\nI’m not entirely sure why I’ve been asked on air, or whether it will just make things worse for my chances of being taken as a serious journalist. Now my only motivation is to try and correct some of the ridiculous things I’ve seen about myself online as this story took on a life of its own, and maybe readdress the balance. I couldn’t pass up the chance of handing a few cards out right in the headquarters of a major news channel, and maybe point out the strangely gendered world of media where I would never have been the story if I had been a man.\n\nDoctors make the worst patients. Journalists make the worst news stories. I’ll be happy when this dies down. I’ll be even happier if I get to write my piece.\n\nThere is a really wonderful story my father used to tell me and my sisters when we were little. It’s a story his own mother used to tell him, about a mongoose prince. It’s a long, meandering story that used to be a great way to pass the time during the extensive power cuts of my childhood in Pakistan, and it’s one of the joys of my own journey as a parent when I listen to my father tell the story to my own sons.\n\nI won’t go through the entire story, but the rough premise is this: a prince is born to one of a king’s nine wives, who is half mongoose, half boy. In order to see which of his nine sons will inherit his throne, the king sends the sons on a quest. Whoever returns with the most riches will be the next king.\n\nLong story short, the mongoose prince returns to the kingdom with an old donkey and tricks his brothers into thinking that this donkey craps money when you beat it with a stick. In exchange for possession of the mystical donkey, he asks for all their treasures from their quests combined. This they do, and thus take possession of the dud donkey.\n\nThe other brothers beat and beat and beat the old donkey, but nothing comes out except piles of manure, and finally, one coin, a khotta paisa, which is difficult to translate except to say it was unusable money. Sort of like the donkey pooping out a drachma coin right at the end.\n\nI was thinking of this story again these past two days.\n\nAs I said in my last post about my accidental and might I add very much unwanted notoriety, I got an email from a journalist at Ethnos newspaper on Thursday. The email was polite, saying the paper was writing a story on the impressions that foreign journalists had of Greece’s new finance minister to run in today’s Ethnos.\n\nI politely declined. I wrote back a long email explaining my position, that while the coverage of my tweet to the minister had been fun and games for the tabloids, for me it had badly impacted my image as a serious journalist. If they wanted to talk to other foreign journalists in Athens for their story, I offered to put them in touch. Journalist to journalist, I thought this would get through.\n\nTo his credit, the journalist replied giving me fair warning that the chief editors were going to put me in the story any way, that they had read my blog and would be using that in their piece. I wonder why they even asked me in the first place if they’d be putting me in the story any way. I can only thank my lucky stars that I hadn’t been stupid enough to answer the questions in the email.\n\nThis was bad enough. But when I saw the context of the piece that Ethnos ran today, going something like “The journalists of the Varoufanclub chasing him for an interview!” I saw red. I was furious. I’d say this is a good approximation of my feelings when I saw the headline.\n\nTo be fair, the online version doesn’t give the whole article, so I marched to the nearest news agents and slammed a copy of Ethnos on the counter.\n\n“EUR 4.25.”\n\nHow much? Okay, I didn’t want to find out what the article said that badly.\n\nI thought about writing this article, because now I don’t know who is reading my blog, what they might take from it and what they might twist, but I’m not a fan of self-censoring. As it is, whether I have an opinion or not about the new finance minister, I can’t say anything in case it gets misconstrued.\n\nI now avoid tweeting about him, or retweeting anything from him and that’s mightily difficult in a period where the main news out of Greece is economic. But I can’t sit here with people thinking I voluntarily wanted to be a part of that article when I specifically asked not to be, and was told tough luck, you’ll be in it anyway.\n\nWhat business does a puff piece about the new finance minister’s “international fanclub of female admirers queuing up to talk to him” have on the front page when there is so much real news going on? It doesn’t take much digging to reveal that Ethnos has a very thinly veiled anti-Syriza stance, so they seem quite happy to go around mud-slinging and if it comes at the expense of further erroding my professional credibility, that’s all collateral damage as far as they’re concerned.\n\nBut parading non-news as news, especially more than a week after the event, only serves to make them look unprofessional.\n\nThe media likes to take a story and beat it and beat it, trying to get it to yield more, when the fact is that beyond a short window, most auxiliary news decays and is not newsworthy any more after 24 – 48 hours. For example, on Wednesday I wanted to start working on a story about where the tie that Matteo Renzi gave Alexi Tsipras came from. It’s an Italian made tie, and I could just picture some little old artisan making gorgeous hand-made ties in a backstreet of Rome. But when I woke up on Thursday to the what the ECB had done late on Wednesday night, this was no longer a story.\n\nDo you see what I mean? You’ve had your fun, now back off. Stop beating up the donkey, there’s only manure in there.\n\nLast Sunday, the body of 20 year old Vangelis Yiakoumakis was discovered weeks after he disappeared. The verdict was suicide, a desperately sad end to a promising young life. Immediately after he vanished, it emerged that he had been the victim of severe bullying at the dairy college he attended in picturesque Ioannina, Northwest Greece.\n\nThese events sparked much debate about bullying in the country, which charitable organisations such as Smile of a Child have reported to be reaching epidemic proportions. The situation has got worse since the economic crisis deepened, and yet despite deaths like this, the fact remains that Greece is by and large in denial about the scale and seriousness of bullying.\n\nWhen I first moved to Greece, this was one of my first questions. Did bullying exist in Greek schools? And if so, how bad was it? The answer I got was an emphatic no. The few people who would acknowledge the issue gave a shrug and said things like “Kids will be kids, they’ll always find something to pick on.”\n\nThe problem with Greece is that parents cannot imagine that their little darlings might be the source of someone else’s misery. My husband was utterly adamant that there was no such thing as bullying in Greek schools, such as the type which exists in the UK and USA. As more and more cases such as this latest one have come to light, he has quietly had to admit that something has gone wrong. There might not have been bullying in his school days. But there certainly is now.\n\nHere’s what has bothered me about the issue. Time and time again, the debate has boiled down to how can we get our children to talk? I’ve watched TV exchanges where well-meaning specialists have picked over which is the best way to get young people to talk about being bullied. There is little thought about how to stop bullies from bullying. It’s all centred on making the victim responsible for getting out of the situation themselves without wondering whether it’s the adults that need to be better listeners and pay closer attention to the mental welfare of the children in their lives.\n\nThere is a lot of talk about how much Vangelis was bullied, or how badly. How badly was it? Was it badly enough to take your own life? Friends who were with him on the day noticed nothing out of the ordinary. It can’t have been that bad can it, if no one close to him realised he was going to kill himself? This is what the whole thing comes down to, once again trying to quantify abuse and mental health.\n\nPeople have been trying to measure just how bad it has to get for someone to take their life, ignoring completely the bigger issue of what is going on with our young people, their lives, the lack of support for mental health not just in Greece but in so many countries. When you are at the edge peering into the abyss, which I am not ashamed to admit is a place I’ve found myself, it does not take much more to push you over it.\n\nLet me tell you my take on the problem from someone who was bullied.\n\nI’ve often joked that you could not pay me enough money to go through high school again. But I’m not really joking. From the age of 14 when I entered high school in the UK, through to 16 when all my tormentors opted not to continue on to sixth form, I was bullied.\n\nThe interesting thing is that I didn’t really consider myself a victim of bullying. I still got up each day, got ready and happily went to school with no sense of dread. Here’s why: when people, especially young people think of bullying, they think of bruises, cut lips, punches to the stomach, being shoved and pushed, physically intimidated. They don’t think of the constant, tiny daily comments, the belittling, the mental anguish they’re going through, the deconstruction bit by bit of their self esteem, the erosion of their ability to like their own selves.\n\nI didn’t think I was being bullied because I had nothing to show for it. My bullies never laid a finger on me. They called me names, shouted out cruel things to me as they passed me in the corridor and never missed a chance to make fun of my appearance. They hid my glasses or my school bag when I was changing for gym class. My frizzy hair, bookishness, glasses and invisibility to the opposite sex made me an easy target.\n\nI didn’t tell anyone in a position of authority except for once telling a teacher after class when two of the girls had snipped some of my hair off. And she did absolutely nothing. Not one thing. This made me feel like perhaps it was me who was being oversensitive. I didn’t tell anyone again. I reasoned that on the scale of things, I probably wasn’t really being bullied.\n\nI wish someone had taken me to a side then and said “You see those girls who are making your life miserable? A few years from now you’ll be far away from here. You’ll have a life, you’ll be meeting wonderful people and doing amazing things. And they’ll still be here, stuck in this little town.” No one did though. Years after my self esteem had been whittled away to nothing I had to build it back up piece by piece, splinter by splinter, to start believing again that I was good, likeable and worthy.\n\nGiven the advent of social media and mobile phones, I do not even want to imagine what my teenage years would have been like if I had to relive them now. At least I could go home and switch off. Teenagers today can’t. The abuse they face is constant and never ending.\n\nBeing bullied doesn’t mean coming home with messed up clothes and bruises every day. If you’re a young person reading this, I just want you to know: if someone is making you feel less worthy, you are being bullied. If someone is making fun of your appearance, your clothes, your origins or your intellect, you are being bullied. Don’t wait for them to start using their fists on you. Tell an authority figure, and keep on telling until someone listens to you.\n\nMost of all, remember that you are worthy and you are precious.\n\nOn Monday 20th April 2015, the long-awaited trial of Golden Dawn finally gets underway.\n\nIn a country where so many other things have gone wrong, this one has spent the last year and a half simmering away in the background as we waited for a trial d"
