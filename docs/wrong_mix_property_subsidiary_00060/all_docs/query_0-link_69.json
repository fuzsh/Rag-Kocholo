        "text": "We were hungry. After a quick stop at Batasia Loop, all I wanted to do was reach Darjeeling and have something to silence my gnarling stomach. Darjeeling, I have heard, boasts of some amazing heritage restaurants and café and I could not wait to try something from their offering.\n\nThe shuttle dropped us at the junction of Darjeeling and from there, Good Lord saved us, it was a scary climb up to the infamous Darjeeling Mall.\n\nOut of breath, when we reached the Mall, it seemed to be a deserted one, hardly any shops were open and needless to say, there were almost no localites, leave aside tourists. I was all heartbroken. It could have been the early morning, or the Sunday or the political disturbance Darjeeling has been facing time and again. It made me sad when I found out, such a beautiful hill station has been stripped off all its glory and happiness, because of a turbulent political scenario. November is the peak time of the year for tourists, yet there was hardly any. A place that garners most of its revenue from tourism is deprived of tourists, ripped off all its beauty and devoid of all the cheerful spirit, such a pity.\n\nAfter a quick search, we at last found a restaurant and lodge that was serving breakfast. It was a quiet place near the mall, where we found mostly locals eating. If you ask me, when you are exploring a new place, always eat, where the locals are eating, instead of going to a fancy restaurant. Perhaps you will end up tasting the best flavours of the place. One side of the restaurant had a series of glass windows so that you can enjoy the awesome view of the mountains and even the snowy peaks as you enjoy a hearty meal. For me, it was strictly a cup of warm and comfy coffee and a platter of eggs and toast and for that busy man, he wanted to sample the aloo ka paratha they were serving and trust me, it was amazingly delicious.\n\nAs we stepped out after a grand breakfast, something bright and colourful in the sky caught our attention. It was the new attraction of Darjeeling, Paragliding. It looked thrilling, but I was not brave enough to fly, we decided to rather walk and explore the place.\n\nWe walked around the Mall, there were some tourists and some young school kids, who were enjoying their one day off from the hostels. We could see uniformed kids everywhere, shopping, eating and living their entire week on one Sunday. How often do we get to see the normal lives of the locals when we land up in a place as a tourist.\n\nAfter spending some time at the mall, we started walking towards a quiet, green path by the mountain, which leads to the Mahakal Temple. Never a religious person, we decided to skip the temple and rather explore the wilderness of the path.\n\nShops and stalls were being set, selling all sort of woollens and religious items. We walked past the women and children and soon reached a place that seemed devoid of any people. I have been a dreamer, always, and I started sensing adventure. We walked ahead and soon met young couples, some whispering sweet nothings to each other, while others having cute little love fights.\n\nWe walked on and soon found a resting place, which overlooked the mountains and the rugged terrains. We decided to sit for a while. There were some other tourists as well, stopping for a quick tea or snacks. I tried concentrating on a parachute circling on the valley side of the mountains, trying to land at the clear patch, but failing every time. It kept flying high and circling but failed to land every time.\n\nAfter spending around 15 mins, it was time to head back! We did not have the entire day. I did not see the para-sailor landing but believed, he/she has reached the destination. We started retracing our steps, time was slipping away so fast.\n\nGlorious sand, serene sea, vibrant nightlife and piles of beer bottles! Well, you have guessed it all right, I am talking about Goa. But if you have always thought of Goa to be just these and nothing more, it’s time to explore this magnificent place.\n\nGoa has always been on my list, ever since the wander bug had bit me, and when I met a fellow wanderer and decided to tie the knot with him, we could not have chosen any other place.\n\nGoa has never been just a place for me, it is more of an emotion, a sentiment a sense of freedom and when I peeped out of the small window of our Indigo flight, all I could see was lush greenery, endless stretches of blue, a lazily meandering but turbulent Mandavi and a pristine white church rising high up from what looked like a beautiful topography.\n\nYes, we had to listen to a lot of opinions, because it was June and ‘Goa will be Hot’, ‘Rain will ruin everything’ etc etc. But when the sea calls, what else can you do? There we were awaiting our luggage at the Dabolim airport, ready to soak in the every bit of Goa.\n\nThe moment we stepped out of the airport, a pleasant weather and a comfortable temperature greeted us and to reassure us, our driver informed us, that Monsoon have hit Goa and the weather has been wonderful ever since. Phew! Goa loves us back, I guess.\n\nDumping our luggage in the hotel room, we were all set to explore. Located right across the Tito’s lane, I was more than happy to hear the roaring of the sea. My first tryst with the Arabian Sea and needless to say, I fell in love with it. Scattered with seashells, beer crowns, bottles the walk to Calangute through the beach was something I will cherish all my life.\n\nAfter having our ‘lunch’ with a Goan Thali at 6pm (Yes, you never realize how time flies in Goa) at 1965 Food Hub by Britto’s, we decided to explore the roadside markets on our way back.\n\nThere were swim suits, beach gowns, hats, flipflops and what not available on the road side stalls but what I loved the most on my first day was the beautiful houses, be it the palatial ‘Casa’s or the simple but ornate cabanas, every home will remind you of the splendid days during the colonial era.\n\nSome had happy inmates, smiling at the wandering souls while others have been turned into guest houses and resorts, but the spirit has never changed. And then we stopped near a small chapel where an evening mass was in progress.\n\nThe beautiful hymns in Konkani, the choir singers and the beautifully decorated chapel were something that will remain etched in my memory. Who said Goa was a place for revelry, I met a Goa that could stir your heart and soul and remain with you even after you have long came back.\n\nStay tuned, because one post is never enough when it comes to Goa!\n\nNow Cafes with an open library, is one theme, that has been explored many times in Kolkata and amazingly, most of them are quite a grand success. From the nostalgic Indian Coffee House in College Street to the posh Oxford Bookstore at Park Street, books and cafes are something we, Bengalis have always loved. Then what makes this cafe, a special one? Well, read on.\n\nGrabbing a book from the nearby shelves while waiting for a date is one thing, and zeroing in a cafe, that understands you and arranges for you, the most amazing dates is another. What if, you are bored of your routine, and decide to go on a date and Rhett Butler, Heathcliff or even Archie appears right in front of you, as your date?\n\nYes, the relatively newly opened Potboiler Coffee House is not a cafe with stacks of books, but it is a cafe that has been designed as an ode to the bookworm, that lives within us.\n\nFrom a corner that says ‘Always.’ to interesting stocks of books on the shelves, from finding names of your favourite novels mingled with your favourite dishes to discovering coasters with your favourite book quotes on them, Potboiler is a place that can be the dream/happy zone for every bookworm.\n\nTo top these all, they actually have dedicated a corner, where you can sit, relax, pose and love the fact that you are a proud bibliophile. Yes, the corner speaks about the anatomy of a bookworm, complete with books and vintage boxes and an accent chair, cozy and inviting.\n\nFood & Service\n\nLocated right next to Simaaya in Triangular Park, we dropped in one day to check the newbie, and came out head over heels in love with the place. We decided to order 2 The Frappe in our Stars, Cappuccino and Sichuan Chicken Popcorn, however, our attendant insisted on trying something new, instead of ordering 2 frappes and on her suggestion we ordered ‘To All the Lattes I have loved before’. It was a cold iced coffee with a minty flavour to it, which I did not like much. Might be because of my strong affinity to caffeine.\n\nBut overall, food was good. The staffs could be a bit over-friendly, which is a kind of bothering for me, but many might love it, but service is good.\n\n(Btw, did you notice the interesting play of words in the name of the food items?)\n\nWhat Stood Out for Me\n\nIt was definitely the ambience. With books, fairylights, informal yet cozy seating arrangements, literary quotes and loads of greenery when you look outside, the ambience is perfect, if you are a romancoholic in heart, just like me. I believe, this can be a great hangout place, if you are looking for some lone time, or waiting for someone, and that person has the habit of keeping you waiting for eternity ( I often face this, hence I understand the importance of knowing good places where you can spend time alone)\n\nPrice\n\nAverage, I felt, given the amazing things they have to offer\n\nFinal Take\n\nI would say, it is must go places for Bookworms, or maybe for people who simply enjoys coffee and long comfy conversations. Btw, if you love taking cool intellectual pics, drop in to this place today.\n\nWhile trying out the delights from the Konkani kitchen was a pleasure and something we absolutely enjoyed, but how could we leave the much famed places in Goa, especially, when we were so in love with food. So here are the few places we tried during our brief 3 days stay in North Goa.\n\nBy the way,before starting, I would like to say that I am not a complete sea food lover. I only enjoy some selective fishes and prawns, but little did I know, things were about to change.\n\nBritto’s by the Beaches\n\nNow, who have not heard about Britto’s. During our last stay, we were not lucky enough to get a seat on this esteemed shack, but this time, we made sure we visited this place. We had plans to go to Mambo’s but we decided to visit Britto’s instead and enjoy a peaceful dinner. Our sole focus was surely the sea-food platter and we ordered that along with a plate of French Fries, because we were not sure about the quantity and whether it will fill us to last the night. The platter arrived with French Fries, Masala Papad (a constant dish, my husband kept ordering) and our drinks. The platter floored me, on it’s arrival. With baked King Fish, Squids in white sauce, prawn cocktail, crab meat cake and it was also supposed to have oyesters but, it was our bad luck, they were running out of it, so we chose two portions of Calamari in cheesy sauce.\n\nI was trying Calamari and Crab for the first time and I can fly to Goa right now, to have that platter again. The live music, the roaring waves, the ambience and the food turned it into a romantic date and I will cherish the dinner till our next visit.\n\nAmbience- 4/5\n\nFood-5/5\n\nService-5/5\n\nAnd they have an amazing collection of freshly caught fishes, lobsters and crabs which you can order for your meal. Most of the shacks have this facility but the collection at Brittos, really caught my attention. By the time, we finished our dinner, the place was almost close and we couldn’t have dessert that night.\n\nCandolim and the Live Music-Jazz Corner\n\nWe were out for a crazy drive towards Candolim. The drive was an aimless one, and we had plans to come back to Tito’s Lane for our dinner. It was a voice that caught our attention and we decided to stop for a drink to hear the singer.\n\nRanu Shah, was the name of the singer and his featured stated, he had his roots in the hills and boy his voice was mesmerizing. We stopped for a drink at Jazz’s Corner in Candolim, but we got the fondest memories in return. A Blue Lagoon for mocktail, beer for my husband, Masala Papad (yet again) and Crab & Prawn Cakes were what we ordered and stayed till the singer came down from the stage.\n\nIt was an amazing experience hearing the singer, munching on the delicious food and forgetting all your worries. We even stopped for a chat with the singer, we were so impressed by his voice and presentation.\n\nCandolim boasts of some amazing restaurants and live music which are a must try, if you are fond of both food and music. The beach remains secluded at night, the crowd in these restaurants are quite selective and the place has the ability to give you the best memories.\n\nMeeting the Portuguese Culture at Saib\n\nOfcourse, Goa is all about Portuguese colonial culture, but there is one particular place, that will make you forget that you are in India, or that you are awake and not dreaming. If you have not guessed it already, you have missed a lot of Goa. Yes, I am talking about Fontainhas, a place that will give you a glimpse of Portugal and invite you to explore even more of this small state, Goa. After a quick walk through the narrow lanes bordered by colorful heritage buildings, we were quite hungry and wanted to taste Goanese Thali and the much acclaimed drink of Goa, Feni. So, we headed to Saib, one of the best restaurants in Panjim. We ordered for a Chicken & Macaroni Soup and a Goanese Thali, which comprised of some amazing delights that tasted of Goa, the Goa we all love.\n\nWhen the Thali arrived, it was beautifully introduced to us by the waiter (who by the way was a Bangali himself). The Thali comprised of Steamed Rice, Semolina/Rawa Fry Surmai Fish, Drought Fish (You will love it, if you are fond of extremely spicy food), Goanese fish curry (infused with the fresh spices and coconut milk), a preparation with cabbage, Dal, Pickle, Salad, Papad, Curd, a spicy onion and fish curry and Sol Curry-phew!\n\nEvery single food was outstanding and for lunch it was quite filling. After enjoying a lip-smacking late lunch, we headed to our hotel room. It surely called for a power nap.\n\nBritto’s Deli for the Dessert Lovers\n\nI was not going to leave Goa, without tasting the desserts at Britto’s Deli. This famous restaurant also boast of an amazing bakery and some stunning pastries and before catching our flight back to Kolkata, we decided to drop in at the Tito’s Lane outlet and treat myself with some great dessert. My husband is not much fond of chocolates and pastries so I packed one Truffle Pastry and hopped on to the cab.\n\nThey say sweet cures all the heartaches and parting ways from Goa, was surely a sad moment for me. On the flight, when I opened the box, the pastry made me feel good and one spoonful of it helped me combat all my little pains of coming back to my daily life. I was sure, I am going back to this place again, try it’s food, desserts, drinks and walk the beaches with bare feet, watch the sun go down and the dawn break, fall in love again and comeback with heart breaks.\n\nMughals and the Nawabs have contributed a lot to the culture of India. They have added luxury food to our lifestylea and ask any Bangali out there, Biryani will win handsdown as our favourite go-to dishes in times of hunger, celebrations or just food cravings. I am no exception and Biryani indeed is one of my favourite dishes. However, this time, I wanted to give other Mughal dishes a shot, hence, we decided to drop in at The Saffron Tree on Southern Avenue.\n\nWith an interesting decor and an equally appealing tagline, this place has been drawing my attention for a long while and this time, it was time for me to explore.\n\nAnd We Meet\n\nFrom the interesting graphiti outside to the beautiful lighting, the ambience is warma and inviting and so are the staffs. The moment you step in, you will be greeted by a warm smile and you will be attended carefully, with suggestions and inputs for each of your order. Mind you, they will never make you feel forced or dictated, they will warmly help you choose the best, based on your preferences. The menu not only shares the ingredients but also the wonderful history of each of the dishes and how The Saffron Tree chef has fused it with some modern elements. I was impressed right from the beginning.\n\nThe Journey Begins\n\nWe began the Haute Mughal journey, with Chapli Kebab made from pounded Pork loin and infused with the Indian spices. They are our very own Mughlai version of the Pulled Pork Loin chops.\n\nAs the dish arrived, it indeed filled us with immense pleasure. The presentation was that amazing. As we gorged on the kebabs, we thought of another started, because we were bowled over by the taste of this one.\n\nThe person who was attending everyone, suggested Kataifi Achari Prawna and we went ahead with it. Ofcourse, prawns have been my favourite but when this dish arrived, I was pretty sure, Prawns will continue to rule my heart for a long long time. Coated with vermicilli, this dish had a chessy touch to it, with a hint of tang and oodles of flavour and taste.\n\nBy now, we have decided, that The Saffron Tree will be our favourite restaurant from now. After finishing this platter, we thought of trying their biryani as well. So next came the Lucknowi Dum Biryani.\n\nWhen the flavourful platter reached our table, we were almost salivating, even though we were half full. The biryani has a tender mutton, a boiled egg and a perfectly cooked potato (this they have kept the Calcutta style intact, thank God for that). The Biryani was yummiest and so was the mutton and as I took the last bite, 3 things happened.\n\na) I was full\n\nb) I was craving for some more, inspite of being full\n\nc) My love for Mughlai cuisine, increased two folds\n\nOfcourse we wanted to order a dessert, but if we did so, we might had to roll back to our home, we were so full. So we left the dessert part for our next visit.\n\nTrue to their words, they do serve some delectable haute Mughlai cuisine and if you are fond of Mughal cuisine, you must-must-must visit them to try a new taste which will leave you smitten. Before ending, they also serve some basic drinks, but their food can give you the same kick and fill you with happiness.\n\nFood-5/5\n\nAmbience-4.5/5\n\nService-4.5/5\n\nFinal Verdict- Definitely Recommended\n\nGetting up hung-over from late night party at Mambo’s, is a common phenomenon, if you are a party animal and are in Goa. But how many of you have woken up to stomach ache, due to over-eating? Yes, meet me, an avid foodie, who has woken up to a terrible stomach ache, due to an overdose of Konkani prawn the night before, but hey, that did not stop me. I hiked up to the much-famed Chapora Fort, but yes, had to limit myself to just French Fries and Coconut water for that day. However, my second trip to Goa was more of a compensation trip for that day. This time, I did roll up my sleeves and decided to try every kind of food from every type of restaurants and shacks and so my new journey began- this time from one plate to another.\n\nShacks at the Beaches\n\nIf you are in Goa, you need to try out the beach shacks. They simply add to the beauty of Goa and it’s splendid beaches. Ofcourse you will have ample of choices, but for us, we fell in love with the hospitality and the food at La Marin, located close to the famed Tito’s Lane on Day 1, and it became our ‘go-to’place even at the dead hour of the night. Unlike many other shacks, situated nearby, they remained open till 4am in the morning and you could just sit and chill on the beach recliners, watch the waves hurl on the shore and watch the dawn breaking while munching on your favourite snacks, starters or main course.\n\nWe tried their sea-food, continentals with mostly chicken starters mostly. If you are looking for a place to spend the night watching the sea and not just party, you can surely drop into any of the shacks and enjoy the peace and the vibe of Goa.\n\nBut hey, before choosing your shack, do not forget to ask the opening hours. Even though, Goa remains awake at night, there are many shacks which closes between 12 to 1pm.\n\nManik (Indian) Bar & Restaurant\n\nOn our second day, we wanted to try something that reflected the flavours of Goa and this mid sized restaurant on our way to Baga from Candolim caught our attention and we decided to give it a shot. Even though, Goa boasts of many fine dines and proper restaurants, but we always make sure to try food from places those are mostly hidden from the limelight and in this case, this place was a hidden gem. We expected to try Goan cuisine, since they had Goan thali.\n\nThe place was run by a family, who had their roots at Ladakh. They also had a Pashmina store, but our sole focus was food and food only. The owner suggested us to try Fish and Chicken thali which will have the perfect blend of Goan and Pahari Cuisine. We were super-excited as the thali arrived. Freshly prepared both the fish thali and the chicken thali were enough to suffice two person, hence it did make us feel overloaded.\n\nChicken Thali had two chapatis, a portion of rice, the yummiest preparation of Dal, roasted papad, salad and a preparation of chicken with a hint of coriander and coconuta and it was the heartiest meal, I have ever had.\n\nThe Fish Thali had Rawa Fried King Fish, Spiced up dal, roasted papad, Mackarel in Konkani gravy, salad and a portion of rice and 2 chapatis.\n\nAfter satisfying our heart, soul and belly, we decided to head to our hotel room and rest for a while, before venturing out to Candolim, to enjoy some live music.\n\nStay tuned, because, Goa is not just about Coconuts and spices from the Konkani kitchen. There were Colonial dishes as well, waiting for us and we could not wait more to dig our forks into them.\n\nWalking down has always been easy, be it on the memory lane or the hilly road. In no time we reached the Mall. This time, many shops were open, but we hardly had anything to shop. It just felt good that life was back at its normal pace.\n\nWe soon crossed the famous Clock Tower which was made even more famous in the Anurag Basu movie Barfi! Nothing can beat the effect of the wonders that Bollywood can do. I wondered as my husband who showed me the clock tower like a guide referring about the movie, how many of us would have noticed this ancient clock tower, had it not been for Barfi! There was no means to find out that.\n\nWe soon walked past the famous bakery Glenary’s, which was filled with green uniforms, the students from the hostels. The fragrance of the bakery invited us, but we let it pass. I had a different place in my mind. We walked past the many cafes and restaurants and at last reached a point where two roads diverged and that is where my destination was, Keventer’s.\n\nI came across the name of this legendary restaurant as Satyajit Ray’s famous detective Pradosh C Mitter and his brother cum assistant and friend, Topshe and Jatayu dropped into this place to have sandwiches and hot chocolate as they discussed a matter of great importance in Darjeeling Jomjomat. Keventers has remained closed for years and then one fine day, the news of this legendary restaurant reopening reached my ears, and ever since then, I have been dying to visit this place.\n\nWe stepped in and climbed the stairs to witness the terrace dining area. Unfortunately for us, the terrace was full and it was the bright sun that forced us to sit indoors. We ordered the breakfast platter with toasts, sunny side up double egg poach, sausages and bacon fried, a ham sandwich and a milkshake to satiate our souls and stomach.\n\nAfter a sumptuous lunch at Keventer’s, it was time to say goodbye to the Queen of Hills. We had our train from Siliguri at 8pm and it was already 2pm. We still had a long way to go.\n\nAs we reached the Choumatha, something splendid caught our attention. The students from different schools of Darjeeling were out in a procession, singing Christmas carols with beautiful beats of the drums as the beautiful procession of singers and band members mesmerized the onlookers. It was November end, and they were rehearsing for the Christmas. The carols were being sung in English, Hindi and Nepalese and they sounded wonderful. We could not move, stood there and soaked ourselves in the beautiful Christmas spirit.\n\nAs we walked towards the shuttle stand, we came across multiple bakery shops boasting amazing biscuits, cookies, cakes and cream rolls and for a foodie duo like us, it was hard to resist the urge of buying all the delicacies. After loading our bags with the goodies from Darjeeling, we started our journey downhill.\n\nI had a colleague who was in love with Darjeeling and every year her travel plans were solely made for this hill station. With my faint memory of this place, I could never relate to the fact that why was she so in love with the place. My first impression of Darjeeling, when I got down from the Scorpio this time was, this place is dingy, crowded and dirty.\n\nThe crowd and the busy market place reminded me of Kolkata itself, but then the mighty mountains, the green paths and the Kanchenjunga assured me, Darjeeling was home away from home. You will get the shops, the crowd, and the food just like your home, yet there was something that sets this place apart. It was the pristine greenery, the light in the eyes of the people when they meet you, the snow-capped Kanchenjunga, the fleeting clouds and the twinkling lights on the valley as sun sets and darkness envelopes the hill station.\n\nThe lights might remind you of the fireflies, but trust me, there are people all around, people with hope, dream and happiness, inspite of the hardships they face every day. Darjeeling might have lost its old glory, but the spirit and soul of this place, remains the same, beautiful and true, just like the nature that shelters them.\n\nBeing born in a Bengali family…you will be taught to love and respect Tagore, soon after you utter the first word. It is almost like you are betrothed to the person and you have to love him.\n\nBut even in an arranged marriage, you do have your moments of love. I was in college when I first read ‘Home and the World’ and that was my moment of love with him. I knew I have fallen for that man and he was the perfect man.\n\nAs I write, Linkin Park crawls on my earphones, but my soul will always sing- ‘Je Raate Mor Duwar Guli Bhanglo Jhore’, such is the grip of that man on my soul. When my friends planned trips to distant lands, I just had one place on my mind.\n\nMany plans and heartbreaks later, it was the November of 2018 which turned my dream into a reality. The early morning Ganadevta took me to Shantiniketan- the peace abode. I had many things in my mind, I might just well-up on reaching or might just dance to the glory, because finally, I was there, finally! But when I got down at the Shantiniketan station at about 9 in the morning and the morning sun kissed my face, I knew, I was home.\n\nFor a girl who believes her religion is literature and Tagore to be one of the faces of Almighty whom she follows with all her heart and soul, Shantiniketan could have been a temple, a sanctuary or a place to pray, but my heart and soul both nodded and confirmed, it was Home.\n\nP.S. If you are planning to soak in the spirit of Shantiniketan, skip Basanta Utsav and Poush Mela, because those not oft treaded paths have their own charm, which can only be felt once you are away from the ‘madding crowd’\n\nIt must be because I live in Kolkata, that I get to see the celebration of Art. Yes, by art, I do not just mean big painters and their immensely overpriced art, but rather, a celebration of every form of art. If it were not the case, Kumartuli wouldn’t have become one of the most celebrated and intriguing tourist attraction.\n\nWhile some might call it the God Factory, some a best place to flaunt your photography skill and some term it as a hub of hardly acclaimed artists, but for me, Kumartuli is a place, where ‘Bangalir Baro Mashe Tero Parbon’ comes to life. Yes, Kumartuli or Potuapara is that corner in Kolkata where Ma Durga or any other deity is brought to life.\n\nKumartuli- the alley of the Potters\n\nUnlike their posh counterparts, they are hardly considered as artists or sculptors. Their studios are not richly furnished but are merely built from ropes, bamboos and sheltered by clay tiles. But that does not deny the fact that they are the reason behind the grandest of all festivals, the Durga Puja.\n\nThe Pre Puja Buzz\n\nAs the city geared up for the grand festival, i.e. Durga Puja, it was on the day before Mahalaya, we (me and my husband) decided to visit this art alley located in North Kolkata.\n\nOf course, we have been there before, during the Durga Puja or during some other festival, but never before Durga Puja, when the narrow alleys are buzzing with the pre-festival humdrum when the members of various clubs from across the city are busy\n\npreparing to take the Goddess with her family to their respective pandals, when the artists, even amidst all the crowd, disturbance and interference engrossed in completing their pieces of art.\n\nMy Experience\n\nAs we stepped into the narrow alley, we could see life and energy buzzing from every corner of the lanes. While some artists were busy creating the ‘Chalchitra’ or the beautiful artwork behind the Deity, others were busy crafting Jewellery for the goddess and the Kumors or the sculptors were busy, completing their artworks. And to top it all, there were photographers everywhere, clicking everything under the sun and within the alley. My walk down the lane was mostly filled with awe.\n\nThere were idols of every size, from the miniature ones to the huge ones and every one of them were equally captivating. Yes, it was crowded and the coolies were busy, bringing out the idols and carrying them to the trucks which were waiting for Ma to drop her to her destination, yet the very feel of this place made me fall in love with my city again. Where else would you find such excitement and such a diverse range of artists all in one place?\n\nHistory\n\nIt is said that Kumortuli is almost 300 years old when a group of potters arrived at this part of the city and made this there home. Today there are more than 150 families, whose sole mode of livelihood is creating beautiful idols out of clay. Initially creating Goddess were only the task of the male artists, but time has changed and brought in a revolution and Kumartuli today boasts of some amazing female artists as well.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nSovabazar Metro Station will be the nearest Metro, while Taxis and Buses are easily available from across the city\n\nThis year onwards if you are planning to take some amazing shots, you can go for a Photographer’s Pass and click your heart out as you witness the wonderful creation\n\nWhen you are in the area, do not miss the studio of Artist Mohanbanshi Rudra Paul, who is one of the most acclaimed idol makers in Kolkata\n\nKumartulli also hosts some amazing Durga Pujas which are a must check if you are planning for a Pandal Hopping spree.\n\nFeature Image has been sourced from a wonderful photographer- Debashis Chatterjee.\n\nDarjeeling they say is the Queen of Hills and technically speaking, this was not my first visit to this place. I have visited Darjeeling some 20 years ago of which I have very faint memories, making this hastened trip, even more special.\n\nIt was early in the morning and I woke up even before the alarm went off. I have always had this wild trepidation before a trip. It took me 15mins to get ready and next I know, we were on a rickshaw on our way to the Siliguri Bus stand. As most of the city was still in deep slumber, it was the bazaar that was stirring back to life and then we heard the call of the shuttle cars for Darjeeling, Gangtok, Mirik and all the lovely places. Indeed, Siliguri is the gateway to the Himalayas.\n\nSurrounded by people for whom this beautiful place is just another regular place, I was the only one super excited. As the Scorpio crossed the military boundaries and I got the first glimpse of the mountains, I could not but feel the wonder, that soon we are going to climb those terrains and reach a city that was created to enjoy the magnificent view and the equally magnificent weather, when it gets too much to bear in the planes.\n\nOur car stopped on the way up, for a human break and as I stepped out, I could feel the chill and the change in the weather.\n\nSoon we crossed the land of schools and hostels Kalimpong, which was a wonderfully colourful city with happy faces all around and, that is where I got a glimpse of the first Himalayan Railways and the quaint and heritage stations.\n\nUnfortunately for me, even this time the heritage trains were not open for us, but never mind, catching a glimpse of the same was special enough.\n\nWe reached Batasia Loop at around 8.45am and we saw the early morning market packing up. I was a bit disappointed, but truly Darjeeling wouldn’t let anyone go back in disappointment. Of what I thought was the beautiful fluffy cloud against the turquoise sky, was actually the Kanchenjunga in its full glory. Sometimes Nature does surprise us. It was hard for a dreamer like me, to believe that the Himalayan peak, which I have read about in the geography book, was actually standing in front of me, just behind some green mountains. It was indeed a splendid view.\n\nBatasia Loop is famous for the magnificent view of the Kanchenjunga. As the beautiful Heritage Rail went around the loop, you can catch a glimpse of the pristine peaks in every turn. The Loop is beautifully maintained and you have to purchase tickets to enter. You can dress up like the tea pluckers and get clicked, or simply enjoy the beauty of the place.\n\nThey say, the place comes alive early in the morning, but we were not fortunate enough to see the place in its full glory. Perhaps next time. It was time to leave and look for a ride because Darjeeling awaited my arrival and I had only half a day’s time."
