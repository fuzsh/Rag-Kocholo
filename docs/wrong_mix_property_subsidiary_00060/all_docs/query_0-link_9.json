        "text": "At the beginning of the year, Tech Notebook told you Sun Microsystems Chairman Scott McNealy thought business school ethics courses were a waste of time. When it comes to ethics, he said, “either you’re born with it or you learn it from your parents.”\n\nMcNealy seemed to think corporate policies weren’t going to do the trick either.\n\nTwo Hewlett-Packard executives recently told us they read our write-up and disagreed with McNealy.\n\n“That’s certainly not the way I would have thought or approached it,” said Chief Ethics Officer Jonathan Hoak, who joined HP in October as details surfaced about the company’s boardroom spy scandal.\n\n“Most people really do want to do the right thing,” Hoak said. “And if you help educate people as to what the right things are – what are the right values and principles – most people will get on board.”\n\nChief Privacy Officer Scott Taylor, whom HP also appointed as the scandal unraveled, echoed that sentiment.\n\n“There are so many people who on the surface don’t even understand the concept of privacy,” he said.\n\nBAND OF MERRY PRANKSTERS: Speaking of Sun, the company has a rich history of subjecting its top executives to April Fools’ pranks.\n\nIn 1986, a merry band of employees assembled a fully functional VW Beetle inside the office of then-vice president of product development Eric Schmidt (now CEO of Google).\n\nThe next year, the foolhardy fellows constructed a small faux pond – using plexiglass for the bottom and a hose to fill ‘er up – around then-vice president of research Bill Joy’s new Ferrari. They tossed him a rubber raft, paddle and life preserver so he could reach the driver’s seat.\n\nBut no major pranks have been pulled over the past five years as Sun failed to post an annual profit. Is it a coincidence that this year employees pulled an April Fools’ joke on Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Schwartz and Chief Technology Officer Greg Papadopoulos, as Sun is finally a few months away from returning to annual profitability?\n\nA small group of engineers created a joint office for Schwartz and Papadopoulos inside a shipping container, outfitted with a toilet, bunk bed and two Easy-Bake convection ovens. It’s full of inside jokes that take too long to explain. But you can check it out at www.openwork3.com.\n\nOK. Kind of amusing, but not exactly technologically challenging. There was some sentiment at Sun last week that this was not one of the better pranks.\n\nMY MAPS KILLS START-UPS?: There is plenty of commentary about how Google’s new feature My Maps is killing off start-ups doing the same thing. The new feature lets you build maps. Platial and Frappr are already doing this.\n\nThis doesn’t make Google an ogre, as some suggest. An ugly company is one that does due diligence on your company, under the guise of possibly partnering with or acquiring you, only to pull out at the last minute and replicate what you do.\n\nMy Maps makes a lot of sense for Google, and it should have been obvious for start-ups that it was coming. Plenty of sites have incorporated Google maps and are not in danger, because they do something very different from what Google will do."
