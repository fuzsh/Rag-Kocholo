        "text": "This paper offers a perspective on the archaeological continuity of towns in Iberia between AD 400 and 800. While traditional views on the decline of the Roman Empire and the arrival of the Middle Ages focus on the collapse of Roman towns, no clear explanation has yet been given for their end. This case study of Late Antique Iberia discusses several moments of crises, such as invasions, plague, civil wars, economic crises, and political downturn in 5th century AD. Each contributed to the decline of towns in different ways, but this paper demonstrates that their transformation into medieval towns should not simply be connected to these crises. Instead, internal transformations, the result of internal social dynamics in the late Roman world, were responsible for many alterations in the late Roman townscape, as periods of urban renewal that were linked to processes of state formation (Suevic, Visigothic, Umayyad) greatly disrupted the monumental centre of most towns and created new medieval townscapes. Overall, we can say that this series of crises and periods of prosperity conditioned the way old Roman towns evolved and changed in this region of the Empire, until eventually Roman townscapes disappeared: neither this change in aspect nor functioning can be assigned to a linear process\n\nThis article surveys scholarship on the evolving provincial organization of the Iberian Peninsula in the late and immediately post-Roman periods (fourth to early eighth centuries CE), when the region moved gradually from the control of the Western Roman Empire to that of the kingdom of the Visigoths, a “barbarian” group who had gradually integrated themselves into the late Roman order in the fourth and fifth centuries. My analysis of this issue over a long time frame suggests that the internal divisions and external boundaries of the late antique Iberian Peninsula (Roman Hispania) were highly fluid and liable to change in response to economic, military, religious and, above all, political factors. The exact make up of Hispania in this period was largely dependent on an ongoing dialogue – sometimes peaceful, sometimes conflictual – between central sources of authority, whether imperial or royal, and more regionally-based powers.\n\nNorth Africa and the Iberian Peninsula were both geographical key regions in the Roman world. Their resources, elites, and culture were important factors in the development and growth of the Roman empire. Both regions experienced an Urban Boom in the imperial period and, as a result, the modern countries of Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya all possess remains of significant numbers of settlements with impressively monumentalized cityscapes dating back to the Roman period. While this process of monumentalization took place in two very different parts of the empire, and peaked in prosperity at different times, some striking similarities in their paths to urban development can still be observed. This volume is the result of an international workshop held at the German Archaeological Institute in Madrid in 2018. The workshop brought together historians, archaeologists, and epigraphists, asking them to reflect on the causal factors behind the various phenomena that constitute the Urban Boom in each of these regions. The chapters offered here constitute a significant contribution to the study of ancient urbanism, identifying some of the key elements that triggered urban development in the Roman empire. The variety of studies presented not only demonstrates the complexities involved in the study of the processes behind ancient urbanization – from the level of individual cities to broader settlement systems – it also sharpens our view of the urban achievements that were specific to the Roman period."
