        "text": "I’m so bad at promising myself to have a sense of urgency in coming up with this follow up. Here’s it. I have convinced myself that I should get this Part 2 done because it’s been over a week since I have completed Part 1 (check it out), January is ending and I’ll be off to my first out of town trip for 2019 this weekend.\n\nI’ll edit the stuff as I read them later today, maybe? I just wanna get this one published.\n\n45 | Bastakiya Quarter\n\nAl Hamriya, Dubai\n\nNarrow alleys flanked by traditional Persian and Emirati buildings form a maze in Dubai’s Al Bastakiya Quarter. Located within Al Fahidi District, this labyrinthine Bur Dubai neighborhood ranked really high on my list of must-visit places when I planned my trip to Dubai.\n\nSee, I’m a big fan of old streets and old towns, and the restorations in Al Shindagha and inspired recreations in Al Seef or Souk Madinat do not hold a candle to the Al Bastakiya’s authenticity.\n\nI chanced upon one workshop that specializes in woodwork and and the craftsmanship on display there – from the doors to the furniture are some of the most exquisite. It was kind of a let down, however, as there wasn’t much else to see apart from that and a handful of beautiful rugs for sale. Many establishments in Al Bastakiya are closed.\n\n44 | MEZ\n\nAyala Highway, Lipa, Batangas\n\nBeautiful pilgrimage sites are things I already expect to see when I decided to research my trip to Lipa. I also learned that it’s a wonderful place to go on a food trip. What I didn’t expect was a food park-type place for drinking and drunk singing. I had an awesome time here despite the rainy weather. My drinking buddies, Berns and Andrian, are excellent singers.\n\nBeer buckets are reasonably priced in MEZ. I highly recommend this place to anyone spending a night in Lipa.\n\n43 | Al Ain National Museum\n\n1st Street, Al Ain\n\nPart of the Al Ain Oasis tour is a visit to Al Ain National Museum, which lies on the eastern end of the UNESCO World Heritage-inscribed oasis.\n\nAs the oldest museum in the United Arab Emirates, the physical building that houses the collections is just not very impressive. The displays are themselves are top-notch but the labels and glass cases look dated.\n\nStill, I enjoyed the museum artifacts and I especially love the weapons on display. The different types of daggers remind me of the ones used by Filipino Moros.\n\nThere is also information about archaeological findings throughout the UAE, most notably the cultural sites of Hafeet. I didn’t have those sites in my itinerary because they were in more remote areas of Al Ain so I appreciate the scale models a lot.\n\nAlso located in the museum complex is a building called Sultan Fort. I don’t have any information about it, but it’s similar in structure to the much more impressive Al Jahili Fort.\n\n42 | Mines View Park | Outlook Drive | Mansion | Wright Park\n\nBaguio, Benguet\n\nThe scenery from the view deck of Mines View Park is breathtaking, but heartbreaking too. Jhon pointed out to me that the brown patch of land on the surface of one of the nearer mountains is a part of the areas affected by the landslides brought about by a typhoon last September.\n\nApart from the views, Mines View Park is also a magnet for all things touristy. It’s a place to enjoy Baguio street food, mount a pink horse or don a traditional Igorot costume.\n\nOutloook Drive is, as the its name suggests, a scenic road you can take from Mines View Park on your way to the Mansion and Wright Park. The views from Mines View Park from Outlook Drive are nearly identical, so I suggest you head here instead if throngs of people are a turn off.\n\nI felt safe walking on this well-paved road, even when there aren’t designated sidewalks. The pine trees that line it provide ample shade even at noon.\n\nBuilt in 1909 by the Americans as the official residence of the colonial Governnor General, the Mansion is one of the most historic points of interest in Baguio. Although the structure that currently stands on its lot is a replica built immediately after WWII in 1947, it is a faithful model to the original.\n\nAs a history nut, it is a bit of a let down to me that a tour of its interiors is not available.\n\nWright Park is a more tranquil, beautifully landscaped park in this part of Baguio. I love, love, love Wright Park, and mostly because I remember having a photo of a 5 year old me taken in this park on a family trip.\n\nBecause there weren’t that many people, I opted to pose here in a bahag, well, to kind of be in touch with my Cordilleran roots. I love how we’re not all PC on this one in general. I think that in general, we take pride in sharing our culture to interested people. Nonetheless, I’m still puzzled by the proliferation of obviously Amerindian headdresses in Baguio parks.\n\nAt the end of quieter part of a park there are stairs that lead down to more park grounds! The scene here is very different. The foul smell of horse manure permeates the air. I think the horses are not as healthy as they should be.\n\n41 | Dubai Mall | Dubai Aquarium | Souk al Bahar | Dubai Dancing Fountain | Dubai Opera | Books Kinokuniya | Huawei Experience Store | Garrett Popcorn | German Donner Kebab\n\nFinancial Center Road, Downtown Dubai, Dubai\n\nBig malls normally do not impress me. I don’t like huuge crowds and going on a shopping spree is something I don’t think I have ever done. I am impressed by Dubai Mall, however. It’s big and family-friendly but its design has touches of classiness that’s not in your face.\n\nApart from the premium retail spaces one can expect to see in a premium mall, there are stores worth checking out. They have affordable options for dining (and a big food court). It’s free to look at the aquarium, the indoor Human Waterfalls, and the Dubai Dancing Fountain – which is, while super pretty, is only a must-see if you’re there anyway.\n\nBut Downtown Dubai is so much more than the fountain. There’s the pretty Souk al Bahar (which I didn’t see because I don’t need more retail therapy), the beautiful Dubai Opera, and a slew of very tall skyscrapers surrounding the open grounds, including Burj Khalifa.\n\nCall it a man-made whatever, but I enjoyed the energy of this place and I have visited this place thrice in my short stay in Dubai.\n\n40 | Taipei 101\n\nXinyi District, Taipei\n\nI didn’t do much in Taipei 101. Mimi and I simply walked around it and entered the mall. It gets as high as #40 on my list because I just love tall buildings and this one is soooo beautiful and it had been in my bucket list ever since it became the tallest building in the world.\n\n39 | Marcela Agoncillo Museum\n\nCalle Marcela M. Agoncillo, Taal, Batangas\n\nThe picturesque town center of Taal, Batangas is teeming with pretty ancestral houses and the Agoncillo Ancestral House, which houses Marcela Agoncillo Museum, is one of its most beautiful.\n\nLearning about the lives and patriotism of Marcela Agoncillo, most known for sewing the first iteration of the current Philippine flag, and her husband, Felipe Agoncillo, an outstanding diplomant, through the displays is one of the highlights of my Taal day trip.\n\nThe National Historical Commission of the Philippines did a good job in presenting not only the involvement of the proud Batangueno couple but also the history of the revolutionary flags, and the struggle for independence of the Philippines from American occupation.\n\nNHCP also did a great job in restoring portions of the house. It’s a must-visit for fans of Philippine ancestral houses.\n\n38 | Deira Clocktower | Al Rigga Mosque | Al Bassam Center | The Laugh Factory at Sun and Sands Downtown Hotel | Al Ghurair Centre | Starbucks Al Ghurair Centre\n\nAl Muraqqabat, Dubai\n\nI spent one of my mornings in Dubai just aimlessly walking through random streets in Deira. The challenge I gave myself was to navigate its streets from Deira City Center to Union Station. The sights and sounds I have encountered did not disappoint.\n\nPeople watching at Starbucks Al Ghurair Centre is also very enjoyable. I have done this on two nights.\n\n37 | Renfel Fastfood Center\n\nKapitan Simeon Luz Street, Lipa, Batangas\n\nI like lomi. I don’t love it, but I’ll never say no to a warm bowl of freshly prepared lomi. But what everyone’s been saying about Batangas lomi is true: theirs are by far the best.\n\nI happened to have my lomi fix at Renfel Fastfood Center in downtown Lipa. It’s an ample-sized eatery in a less busier street within the market area. It’s always full, and it is very evident that every guest is satisfied with the food.\n\n36 | Madinat Jumeirah Tour | Souk Madinat | Jumeirah Beach Hotel, Jumeirah Al Naseem, Jumeirah Mina A’Salam, Jumeirah Al Qasr\n\nJumeirah, Dubai\n\nOne of the activities I looked forward to doing the most in the Dubai intinerary I have prepared is the reserved Bab Al Yam brunch with Daniel. Naturally, that will rank higher than #36. What I’ll be talking about here is what we did after we ate like there’s no tomorrow.\n\nOriginally, we planned to drop by Souk Madinat and enjoy views from there. Since both Burj Al Arab and the mall are part of a complex of hotels operated by Jumeirah group, shuttle services from one location to another is free. We happened to take a ride from a kababayan.\n\nShe didn’t need to but she toured us to every drop off point in the complex. At each point are pretty views, so I had the chance to take many, many pictures.\n\nSouk Madinat is nothing special really – imagine Greenhills items in an Arabic-inspired version of Greenbelt. I guess people go because, like in Greenbelt, the food choices and al fresco dining are the main attractions.\n\nIt’s the hop on-hop off impromptu tour we were treated to that made this activity special to me, and it didn’t hurt to be able to have a glimpse of the hotels and villas I will never be able to afford renting.\n\n35 | Balayan Heritage Buildings | Immaculate Conception Church | Leo Martinez House | Jose Rizal Roundabout | Ermita House | Sixto Lopez House | Casa de Cacao Filipina\n\nBalayan, Batangas\n\nLike many towns in the Calabarzon region, Balayan had played several important roles in the past. It is also the hometown of many prominent personalities in Philippine history, including Galicano Apacible and Sixto Lopez.\n\nWhat entitles Balayan to be among an elite group of notable Calabarzon towns is its built heritage. One fine example of its architectural gems is the beautiful Immaculate Conception Church. Built in 1795, it is one of the Spanish Period Catholic churches inscribed by the National Commission on Culture and Arts as National Treasure.\n\nApart from the church, there are ancestral houses. Fe, Union, and Antorcha Streets have grand residences that reminds the people of Balayan of their town’s prosperous past. Not all of these homes are well maintained and more samples of adaptive reuse could reinvigorate Balayan’s poblacion.\n\n34 | Al Ain Palace Museum\n\nAl Ain\n\nThe Palace of Sheikh Zayed, now a museum, is Al Ain’s most prominent landmark – and for good reason. The man is the first president of the UAE and this 1937 palace is where he and his family resided.\n\nThe palace is architecturally impressive. There’s a certain grandness in its simplicity and despite its ample open spaces there’s a sense of intimacy within its premises. Information about the sheikh and his lineage are displayed here, and while very interesting, I think that what I liked the most in this place is the geometric patterns on the buildings that make up the palace complex.\n\n33 | Chiang Kai Shek Memorial\n\nZhongzheng District, Taipei\n\nChiang Kai Shek Memorial in Taipei is as grand as it gets, I think. It’s no Forbidden City, but I get the same air of grandeur in its open grounds, loftily named Liberty Square. Mimi enjoyed a stroll in its manicured gardens until she got hungry.\n\nThe main gate is my favorite. Its arches seem to dance while the shape of its roofs give an impression that the gate is about to take flight. I also really love the porcelain white and blue combination.\n\n32 | San Martin de Tours Basilica | Taal Park\n\nCalle San Martin, Taal, Batangas\n\nSan Martin de Tours Basilica is the largest church in Asia. Many sources say this so I looked it up on the internet and I was able to confirm that no other religious building that’s called a church on this side of the world is bigger than Taal Basilica.\n\nFrom Taal Park, it looks big, but not any bigger than any other big Philippine church. It’s the beautiful columns that adorn its facade (some sources say it’s patterned after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome) that captures my attention first before its sheer size. Inside though, I could tell that it’s really big. It’s very spacious and a recent renovation makes it feel airier and brighter.\n\nI have visited before on a Visita Iglesia and it’s as beautiful as I remember. I should also mention that during my visit, I wasn’t granted access to the views from the belfry. I was so looking forward to it.\n\n31 | Al Awir Desert Safari\n\nAl Awir, Dubai\n\nI didn’t know I was going to be a fan of deserts until I have visited the Mojave Desert in 2013, so when the opportunity to see the Arabian Desert presented itself, I grabbed the chance. Technically, even the built-up area of Dubai is part of the Arabian Desert. I think that’s obvious. But it’s also obvious that it’s hard to appreciate the natural features of this desert if I don’t venture into the sandy, emptier parts.\n\nAl Awir Desert Safari is also about dune bashing, camel riding and Bedouin-style dining and entertainment. I truly enjoyed the cultural aspects of the safari but no activity could compare to just standing there and simply taking in the awe-inspiring landscape of the desert itself.\n\nPart 3, a week-ish from the latest post again?\n\nAs a consequence of being a fan of history and culture, cities and nature, architecture and urban planning, I can say that seeing places and taking pictures are two things I really enjoy doing. Travel allows me to encounter in person the things that I have read and learned about while photography is a reliable and convenient way to document my travels.\n\nNow, travel has always been a thing I only get to do sporadically. However, in the first quarter of 2018, I was diagnosed with a degenerative illness that impacts my mobility over time. While I still am not able to afford to travel at any time, I have vowed to travel more, as much as my weekends, leaves, and budget would permit.\n\nNope, the travel bug hasn’t gotten around to biting me yet (and I guess it never will) but once in a while last year I have embraced the weekend warrior in me in this quasi-race against time. Doing so allowed me to visit more places within a year than I usually would. I know I’ve not done enough roaming to warrant a travel-themed year ender but give this one to me. I’ll never be as well-traveled as the globetrotting bloggers we all love to get tips from.\n\nI didn’t fly to several locations in any month in 2018 so instead of doing the month by month thingy that travel bloggers do, I will simply be counting down the 60 places and experiences that I have enjoyed the most in 2018. Inspired by the Top 40 year enders radio stations do back in the day, I initially thought of writing about just 40 things. But the thought of not at least writing about the 20 items below those 40 will break my heart so, without further ado, I present to you my 2018 Top 60:\n\n60 | Sanxia Old Street\n\nNo. 37-147 Minquan Street, Sanxia District, New Taipei City\n\nEvery district in Taipei has an area designated as Old Street – a single street or a collection of interconnected streets containing a stock of older buildings. Sanxia’s Old Street reportedly has the best collection of red brick shop houses. Walking through its arcaded sidewalks feels like going back to Taiwan’s bygone colonial era. While very beautiful, most of the shops sell the same kitschy tourist souvenirs. Nonetheless, its nearness to the urban center of more modern and crowded Taipei makes it worth checking out on a day trip.\n\n59 | Yingge Old Street | Starbucks Yingge\n\nChongqing Street, Yingge District, New Taipei City\n\nMany Taipei travel tips suggest pairing Sanxia and Yingge together on a single day trip as these two districts are adjacent to each other and are an hour south from Taipei by train.\n\nYingge Old Street has impressive buildings too. Although these buildings don’t form rows upon rows of brick shop houses perfectly the way those in Sanxia do, Yingge’s advantage lies on what its stores sell – finely crafted ceramics at different price points.\n\nPottery is traditionally a craft that Yingge is known for and I like destinations where local artistry takes center stage. If you’re upgrading your dinnerware soon and heading to Taipei anyway, make a stop at Yingge and look at what its artisans have to offer.\n\nYingge has more than its share of must-try local eateries, but the most convenient place to dine upon visiting Yingge Old Street is its Starbucks, located at the intersection of Chongqing and Yuying Streets. This is where I had a filling set of baked pasta and chicken.\n\n58 | Dubai Museum | Al Fahidi Fort\n\nAl Fahidi, Dubai\n\nConsidered as the oldest extant structure in Dubai, the tower and an adjacent section of the walls that make up Al Fahidi Fort have together been witnesses to the transformation of the city from its humble beginnings as a small trading port to the megacity that it is known as today.\n\nHoused inside this impressive and unmistakably Arabian fort is the Dubai Museum. The well curated displays on its gallery illustrates the history of the Dubai Emirate. Particularly striking to me was the gallery that contain a life-size diorama of Emirati pearl divers. Other must-see displays include really old dhows that used ply the waters of the Persian Gulf and Dubai Creek.\n\nDubai is mostly known for its fantastic modern attractions, but to understand better why it had always been outward looking even prior to the discovery of oil, a visit to the Dubai Museum is a must.\n\n57 | National Dr. Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall\n\nRen’ai Rd, Xinyi, Taipei\n\nDr. Sun Yat Sen is a well revered figure in the Sinosphere. Every important Chinese city, whether in the Mainland or in Taiwan, has a memorial park, museum, street or statue dedicated to him. In Taiwan, he is fondly referred to as the Father of the Nation. His national memorial hall in Taipei is set in a spacious and tranquil park with great views of Taipei 101.\n\nI visited on October 10, Taiwan’s National Day, so the atmosphere was festive on that day. Everyone was all smiles and it didn’t take long before I felt kind of hyped as well – even though I’m not sure what everyone is saying to each other (and everyone has a different view on Taiwanese independence). I guess that’s the reason why I enjoyed strolling along the complex a lot and it became more memorable to me than it would had I visited on a regular day.\n\n56 | Slabhouse Cafe\n\nSouth Road, Sagada\n\nSagada is known for four different things – its remote location (12 hours by bus from Manila, 6 hours by bus from Baguio), its rustic, mountainous beauty, the outdoor activities it offers, and the indigenous practices of its inhabitants that continue to be practiced today. What every other person who’s been to Sagada would like to add one more thing to its rep is its spectacular food options.\n\nThe choices for dining are staggering in Sagada and many of them offer quality food if we go by the rave reviews of travel bloggers that have been to Sagada. Slabhouse Cafe is a short walk away from the town center and the guest house where I stayed (aptly called Sagada Guest House) and it serves good food at reasonable prices.\n\nWhile I would recommend every dining establishment I’ve tried in Sagada, this is the only place where I dined twice. Upon arriving at Sagada from Bontoc, I had Slabhouse Cafe’s lechon kawali for brunch. On the next day, I had their chicken curry for dinner. All of their dishes are served with local rice (other sources say it’s red rice, other sources call it’s black rice).\n\n55 | Burjuman City Centre | Jollibee | Noodle House | Paul | Wrapchic\n\nKhalid Bin Al Waleed Road, Al Mankhool, Dubai\n\nBurJuman City Centre is close to where I stayed when I was in Dubai, so I guess I could be given a pass for dining there several times? I had good food in Jollibee, Noodle House and Wrapchic. I would like to highlight Paul in this write-up. We do have Paul branches here in Manila too – food is good and I don’t need to elaborate on that (Paul BGC is too niminy piminy for me).\n\nWhat I love in Paul’s BurJuman location is the al fresco area. There’s something super cute about having a cup of coffee on the sidewalk and watch people go about their busy lives especially here, as this stretch of the Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Road is not touristy at all! Sadly, when I checked Google Maps to verify its location for this blog post, I have learned that this Paul location is now permanently closed. It wasn’t even a year since I last sipped coffee there. Things change and some do quickly.\n\n54 | Ximen Walking District\n\nHanzhong Street, Wanhua District, Taipei\n\nTaiwan Tourism promotes Ximen Walking District as Taipei’s very own Takeshita Dori (in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo). I see the youthful, energetic vibe, but the similarities end there. I think this place is unique to Taipei, a mishmash of the aforementioned vibe, bargain shopping a la Kowloon’s Mong Kok, multi-level popular high street and sports wear brands shopping like in Shibuya or Siam Square, and a combination of fast food and trendy (but not too posh) dining establishments like in Maginhawa.\n\nMore importantly, Ximen Walking District has the cheapest, good brown sugar bubble tea at NTD 40! I don’t even remember the stall having a name. You will just notice the queue. This is also a good place to buy souvenirs and to book an accommodation. It’s sandwiched between Ximen Station and Taipei Main Station and near central Taipei attractions.\n\n53 | Balayan Bay + Baywalk\n\nPaz Street, Balayan, Batangas\n\nOne of the things I miss the most in my university days is the frequent trips I make to Manila Bay. Sometimes I’d go with friends, most of the time, I go by myself. There’s something about watching a huge body of water that makes me feel hmm, I don’t know.\n\nI did spend a good amount of time here watching people, boats and ships. The bay views are beautiful, the renovated portion now called Balayan Baywalk is a serviceable park.\n\nJust like Manila Bay, however, trash builds up on the shores of Balayan Bay. It’s not as bad and I’m just really glad there’s a public park where people can enjoy the scenery.\n\n52 | Yongkang Street | Sun Merry | Jimmy Mi-swa | King Mango\n\nDaan District, Taipei\n\nAnother vibrant Taipei street that becomes extra lively at night is Yongkang Street – home of the original Din Tai Fung and also the place where shaved mango ice craze began. While Ximen Walking District is set in a large commercial district, Yongkang Street has a much more intimate, neighborhood-main-street vibe to it even if it’s just a few meters away from Dongmen Station on Xinyi Road.\n\nInitially, I planned to sup in Din Tai Fung in Xinyi Road with Mimi because we’ve never braved the crowds in its hyped SM Megamall store location and because we’re in Taipei so having xiao long bao makes sense (it has Shanghainese roots, but it’s a quintessential Taipei dimsum item too). Craze involving food in Taipei is extra stressful, however, and apparently, Din Tai Fung locations in Taipei still see unbelievable queues.\n\nMost of the other establishments along Yongkang Street are fully occupied too during meal times. We would have braved ordering in stores with menus only in Chinese characters, but our menu questions may not be entertained with patience because they have a lot of other customers.\n\nAnd so we went to Jimmy Mi-swa, a small, family-owned eatery. We had a bowl of their signature noodle soup, which is prepared similarly to miswa here in Manila, but with bits of pig intestine and cilantro. For dessert, we went to King Mango. It isn’t the most popular shaved mango ice place on the street, so we went here instead of the jampacked Smoothie House.\n\nLots of local snacks are also sold on the street – it’s like a night market that’s not a proper night market, if that makes sense. On our way back to Ximen, we bought bottled fruit juices from a fruit stand and assorted bread from Sun Merry.\n\n51 | Balite Falls\n\nBalite Road, Amadeo, Cavite\n\nIt rained hard the day I decided to visit Amadeo on a whim. The falls are brown due to the rain but it’s still so pretty. I would have taken a dip into one of its cement-paved pools but they close early. Oh well, the world is spared from a shirtless selfie of me beside the falls so it could be a good thing.\n\n50 | San Sebastian Cathedral\n\nG. Solis Street, Lipa, Batangas\n\nI have visited Lipa on a Visita Iglesia before. I remember its cathedral to be grand and quite unique in shape. When I revisited the place in July, there’s a huge ass screen attached to its bell tower. Additions to the structure are ugly and water damage to the ceiling suggests poor maintenance.\n\nStill, the painted walls and ceilings inside are awe inspiring and overall it is still very much worth visiting. I really am dismayed with how our old Catholic churches are maintained and renovated. They are our cultural treasures!\n\n49 | Shifen Old Street\n\nPingxi District, New Taipei City\n\nI’m not going to mince words here – the buildings in Shifen Old Street are ugly, especially when compared to those in Sanxia and Yingge. Pingxi District used to be an important coal mining town and Shifen was one of the railroad stops in its rail line. As a whole, Pingxi never experienced the sophisticated affluence of those towns and whatever riches mining has brought about to Pingxi has deteriorated when the operations ceased.\n\nBut that’s what makes Shifen charming and brimming with tourist potential. A stroll on its narrow alleyways by the railroad brings out its rustic, provincial appeal. To hasten the revival of its economy, Shifen resorted to selling the experience of flying sky lanterns to eager tourists. They even added an element of quasi-spirituality to it. Different lantern colors correspond to different wishes – one color is for good health, another color is for prosperity, and so on, and you get to write your wishes on the lantern you purchase before you launch them from the railroad tracks.\n\nShifen may be unabashedly touristy and the skylantern business isn’t exactly eco-friendly but the positive energy of other wish-making visitors makes the place lively and fun to visit.\n\n48 | Aquaventure Beach | Aquaventure, Atlantis the Palm | Atlantis the Palm Barracudas Aquaventure\n\nPalm Jumeirah, Dubai\n\nAquaventure in Atlantis the Palm proved to me why it’s best water park in Dubai when I visited. Everything is clean and organized and the guides are friendly. Fast food in Barracudas Aquaventure is good too. The gimmicks aren’t unique but whatever, they didn’t need to reinvent every existing fun concept in water parks to run an enjoyable water park.\n\nWhat I did love so much from this place, because I’m not really a big fan of water parks, are the views from Aquaventure Beach. I really could stay there till sundown just admiring Burj Al Arab and Dubai Marina from the beach if I didn’t have another item in my Dubai to-see list.\n\n47 | 2/28 Peace Park\n\nNo. 3 Ketagalan Boulevard, Zhongzheng District, Taipei\n\nBefore coming to Taiwan, I knew how divisive some political issues could be among the Taiwanese – even though our Asian History textbooks in high school tend to highlight KMT’s importance/legitimacy. I won’t get into it in detail, this is not a politics blog, but I just want to say that I have never imagined that the actual magnitude of the passion the Taiwanese have towards CKS-led KMT – regardless of how favorable they view the subject matter – even up to now, is really big.\n\n2/28 Peace Park is named to commemorate the beginning (February 28) of a series of very important events in Taiwanese history that isn’t really openly talked about up until the 1990s.\n\nIt is a beautiful, albeit not well-kept, green park, with a handful of meaningful monuments.\n\n46 | Red House | Da(d0t)com Chicken Chops | Golden Flower\n\nWanhua District, Taipei\n\nThe Red House is an iconic building just right outside Exit 1 of Ximen Station. Originally built by the Japanese as a public market, it now provides a space for Taipei’s creatives to display their goods.\n\nThe area is not only a haven for local artists. The square behind the Red House hosts a handful of LGBT-friendly establishments. Behind the bars and along Neihu Street are cheap eateries that serve tasty Taiwanese fare. I had a taro bubble tea at Golden Flower and chicken chops at Da(dot)com Chicken Chops.\n\nHeritage conservation, repurposing spaces to instigate urban renewal, providing retail spaces to support local talent and safe spaces for LGBT to congregate, good and affordable food – the Red House area ticks all the right boxes that make it a center for all things cool.\n\nPart 2, maybe some time next week?\n\nCabrera House | Private Residence\n\nCalle Jose W. Diokno\n\nI found the name of this house just across the street from Casa Real through a blog post from Neil Alvin Nicerio. [A] He visited 2012 to attend Taal’s EL PASUBAT festival.\n\nCasa Asinas (1870) | Private Residence\n\nCalle Marcela M. Agoncillo\n\nCasa Asinas is owned by Rogie Reyes, who also owns the renovated Villa Tortuga, [Q] another ancestral house along Calle Marcela M. Agoncillo, and Casa Victrola Cafe in Calle Dr. Hermenegildo del Castillo. [M] Before heading to Taal, it never showed up in Internet searches. I was only able to know the name of this house because it’s posted on its wooden gate. It’s likely currently a private residence. On my visit last July, there were people on the upper floor.\n\nCasa Gahol (1890) | Art Gallery | Cafe\n\nCalle Marcela M. Agoncillo\n\nCasa Gahol houses a gallery of artworks curated by internationally renowned glass sculptor Ramon Orlina. The maternal side of Orlina’s family is the Gahol Clan. [B] It also has a cafe name Francisco’s that overlooks Pansipit River. The cafe serves local desserts like suman, as well as drinks such as iced coffee and frappuccino. [C]\n\nCasa Emiliana | Restaurant\n\nCalle Marcela M. Agoncillo\n\nThe name of this house is posted on its Calle Dr. Hermenegildo del Castillo side entrance. The restaurant on its zaguan serves breakfast fare such as tapang Taal, Taal longanisa, as well as pancit. I did not find any mention of this place elsewhere. On Google Maps street view (currently displaying images taken in 2015), this place has a signage that says it’s called T.A.A.L. Tourist Info Center.\n\nCasa Punzalan | Bed and Breakfast\n\nCalle Graciano Punzalan\n\nCasa Punzalan is an ancestral house converted into a hotel. [C] It is a stone’s throw away from the basilica.\n\nCasa Recuerdos | Souvenir Photos\n\nCalle Dr. Hermenegildo del Castillo\n\nCasa Recuerdos offers 2 free souvenir photos of visitors in period costumes if they join the Casas de Taal tour organized by Paradores del Castillo. [D][E]\n\nCasa Villavicencio (1850) | Private Residence with Guided Tours\n\nCalle Gliceria Marella\n\nConstructed in 1850, Casa Villavicencio, also known as Casa V, is the residence of patriotic couple Eulalio Villavicencio and Gliceria Marella Villavicencio.

Added tags.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn surface level, Lipa does not seem like a city with many cultural things to offer. Like Manila, it sustained heavy damage during World War II and its stock of palatial homes of concrete and wood has decreased significantly. Dig a little bit deeper and its cultural heritage, one that’s strongly connected to its glorious, golden years as the center of the coffee industry in the Philippines – and for a short period, the world – will reveal itself.\n\nBut while one has to make an effort to seek Lipa’s colorful history through the city museum, its grand Catholic cathedral, and a handful of extant old houses, understanding why locals say Lipa is the premier lifestyle hub of Southern Luzon is not very difficult. Its inventory of food parks, coffee shops, dining establishments, and watering holes can rival those of any city in Metro Manila in both quantity and quality. Its malls are equally massive and small businesses thrive at its downtown area.\n\nLipeños are inherently cosmopolitan in nature, but this wasn’t always the case. Before the early 1800s, one could say that since the Augustinians set up a mission in 1604 to convert the locals, it was just one of the many towns in Batangas. Local historian RR Torrecampo recounts that “in 1808, Galo de los Reyes began the widespread cultivation of the coffee trees by compelling the people to plant the same and thus brought about the wealth, splendor and fame that Lipa had after this time.” [A] Its fertile soil and cool climate made coffee growing a profitable industry and eventually, the entire province of Batangas “rose to fame as the leading cultivator of coffee in the country.” [B]\n\nThings to See and Do\n\nCasa De Segunda/Luz-Katigbak Ancestral House\n\nPhilippine Cultural Property (PH-40-0001) [C]\n\nBuilt in 1880 by Don Norberto Kalaw Katigbak, Lipa Gobernadorcillo from 1862 to 1883, and Dona Justa Metra Solis, this typical, 19th Century bahay na bato is named after Segunda Solis Katigbak, also known as national hero Jose Rizal’s first love.\n\nSegunda eventually married Manuel Metra Luz, a man from a prominent Lipa family of artists and scholars, in 1886. They lived in this house with their nine children, as well as their descendants.\n\nRepairs to the damages sustained by the house in World War II in 1942 was initiated by Paz Luz Dimayuga, one of Segunda’s children. Full restoration of the house and the garden was undertaken by Paz’s grandchildren. [D] Memorabilia from the Luz-Katigbak clan is prominently displayed throughout the house.\n\n198 Jose Rizal Street\n\nAdmission: Php 20 [E], Photography Php 100 [F]\n\nDe La Salle Lipa\n\nPresident Laurel National Highway\n\nFidel A. Reyes Bust and Historical Marker\n\nP. Torres Street corner G. Solis Street\n\nFidel A. Reyes is a prominent Lipa-born nationalist writer. His 1908 editorial ‘Aves de Rapina’ (Birds of Prey) in Spanish language publication El Renacimiento exposed the misdeeds of Dean C. Worcester, an American zoologist and then Secretary of the Interior of the United States colonial government. He is also notable for being an assemblyman in 1912, and the first Filipino director of Trade and Industry. In 1967, he donated property to Lipa for the establishment of the Philippines’ first ever SOS Children’s Village. [G]\n\nThe bust and historical marker is erected in front of the Reyes family home at the corner of P. Torres and G. Solis Streets. It is created by National Artist Abdulmari Asia Imao upon the commission of the National Historical Institute. [H] Currently, the lot is occupied by the Lipa location of Don Juan BBQ Boodle House.\n\nLuz-Librea-Bautista House\n\nP. Torres Street\n\nThis Babylonian-inspired stone mansion is built by the patriarch of the Luz clan, Don Jose de San Miguel Luz for his daughter Maria Luz, who is married to Leon Librea. Drying the lumber, sawing the wood, and transporting it from Mindoro to Lipa took time and it was completed in 1881, 10 years after construction commenced. [I]\n\nConstruction materials include molave (posts and frames), narra (flooring), santol wood (ceiling and partitions); adobe, lime, and sand (walls and columns); and galvanized iron (roofing). A cloth painted with designs copied from famous European paintings covers its ceilings. [I]\n\nDon Jose decorated the house with the finest pieces of furniture from both Europe and the Philippines. Additional bedrooms and a bathroom were constructed in 1917. It served as a Japanese headquarters between 1941 and 1944, and as a hospital in 1945.

Sections were added through the years until it was completed some time during the administration of Fray Benito Baras, between 1865 to 1894. It became a cathedral in 1910, when Lipa became a diocese.
