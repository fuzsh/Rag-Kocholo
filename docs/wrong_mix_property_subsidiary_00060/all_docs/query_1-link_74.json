        "text": "Discoveries made at Tell el-Farkha prove that the presence of mud brick was well rooted in Lower Egyptian building tradition. The oldest known examples from the site are breweries connected with the activity of Lower Egyptian culture. Soon thereafter, bricks were used in more innovative ways as separating walls. A period of stronger Naqadan influence, which started in Naqada IID1, resulted in the further development of mud brick buildings, initially in the creation of massive walls and rounded corners. From their very first appearance at Tell el-Farkha, these characteristically shaped corners accompanied monumental structures of special significance. A large mastaba from the site dated to Naqada IIIA2/B1, represents the next evolutionary stage of the rounded corner idea, which was continued during the Early Dynastic period by sepulchral enclosure no. 55. These two constructions show that the architectural legacy of the Delta contributed to the formation of the typical Egyptian mastaba. However, due to the scarcity of evidence from other sites, this picture is based mostly on data collected at Tell el-Farkha.\n\nEphesian terracotta oil lamps are a group of Hellenistic lamps used during the last two centuries BC and probably also in the 1st century AD. This very interesting mould-made type has very characteristic form, clay and ornamentation. Widespread across the whole Mediterranean, they were present in Cyprus and examples were discovered during the Paphos Agora Project. From certain findings it is even possible to suggest that Nea Paphos was a place where they were produced.Ephesian terracotta oil lamps are a group of Hellenistic lamps used during the last two centuries BC and probably also in the 1st century AD. This very interesting mould-made type has very characteristic form, clay and ornamentation. Widespread across the whole Mediterranean, they were present in Cyprus and examples were discovered during the Paphos Agora Project. From certain findings it is even possible to suggest that Nea Paphos was a place where they were produced.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to describe one of the few Ionian cups from the collection of the National Museum in Warsaw. The vase is of East Greek origin and was used as a drinking cup. This type of ceramics was widespread during the Archaic period.\n\nThe National Museum in Cracow preserves an outstanding set of gems collected by Constantine Schmidt-Ciążyński (1818-1889). Within this extensive group of objects two very rare intaglios bearing a particular intriguing motif, the double-heads device, can be noticed. Since the very beginning this kind of depiction was interpreted by scholars differently and many hypothesis have already been drawn. Presented paper aims to explain what is the meaning of this strange iconography and where did it originate from.\n\nThis short paper aims to provide an overview of the two main types of ornamentation applied to loomweights. This type of artifact, though usually classified in the so-called ‘small finds’ category, often contains very interesting objects on which we can observe various kinds of ornamentation. The author will firstly identify two main types of decoration. The first of them relates to the application of signs, symbols or letters, while the second is more spectacular as it involves the application of engraved, impressed or painted iconographic representations. The author will then attempt to outline the hypotheses which have been put forward concerning the reasons behind the decoration of loomweights. The author will focus on three main possible causes. The first is the marking of the manufacturer of the weight, the second is the personal desire of the owner (e.g. decorative purposes) and the third relates to the votive and funerary nature of this type of artifact."
