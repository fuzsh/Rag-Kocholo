Schaller \nGenre: YA Urban Fantasy\nAVAILABLE AT BARNES & NOBLE & AMAZON\n\nBlurb:\n• Found Family\n• Good & Evil\n• Prophecies\n• Mystery\n• Action & Adventure\n• Angels\n• Morally Grey Devil\nEighteen-year-old Jordan Conway has always wanted to help people, but helping seven archangels to achieve their divine duty was never quite what he had in mind...\nWhen Jordan is entrusted by the head nun of his orphanage to deliver a mysterious backpack to a New York City address, he comes unexpectedly face-to-face with Archangel Gabriel. Their acquaintance fast uncovers a labyrinth of secrets that connect Jordan’s once-normal life to an ancient heavenly prophecy. Now, he must help Gabriel to reunite the archangels before evil forces grow too strong.\nSoon, Jordan and Gabriel find themselves on a divine quest across the globe, while deep in the pits of Hell, Satan plots his return to earth. To gain control, however, Satan needs the powerful prophetic objects locked safe inside Jordan’s backpack-and the devil will stop at nothing to get what he wants.\nWith that notion threatening his only family and the safety of his newfound friends, Jordan must do whatever it takes to protect the ones he loves and help the archangels succeed. If that means sacrificing all he thought he knew to go to war with the devil himself? Bring it on.\n.\n.\n#rrbooktours #rrbtthegenesisofseven #thegenesisofseven #urbanfantasy #angelsanddemons #fantasybooks #fantasyreads #fantasybookstagram\".",
