        "text": "The Yucatán Peninsula is well known for its Caribbean resorts from Cancun to Tulum and the ancient Mayan ruins that dot the interior savanna jungle. But on the north side of the peninsula lies Yucatán’s capital city Mérida. While it’s been on the map for over 480 years, Mérida has recently gained popularity for its warm winter months, urban culture, and nascent nightlife.\n\nBuilt on top of the ancient Mayan city of T’Hō, Mérida flourished once before at the turn of the 20th century, when surrounding henequen plantations supplied the world with ropes for ships and industries. But after the invention of synthetic fibers, Mérida became a place more like the land that time forgot—which created an ideal if not perfect environment for architectural treasures to survive in the historic Centro and surrounding barrios.\n\nFrom palatial to pequeño, houses in architectural styles from Viceroyal Spanish to French Neoclassical and Art Deco line the streets (or calles as they’re called). While many houses and public buildings have had dramatic, colorful renovations, many more are still weathered by sun and time enhancing the city’s cultural authenticity and attracting house hunters.\n\nAll of these things got to me, too. It’s why I bought and renovated a rather grand old house in Centro’s Colonia San Cristóbal. Below, my travel guide to Mérida.\n\nHow to Get to Mérida\n\nThe only direct flights are from Houston, Atlanta, Miami, and México City. From elsewhere, you’ll be connecting through these cities and arriving mid- to late- afternoon. Once the Tren Maya, one of México’s massive new infrastructure projects, is fully operating, overland high-speed trains will add much more flight access through Cancun to Mérida.\n\nWhere to Stay in Mérida\n\nis a favorite for the iconic courtyard house experience that’s so much a part of the Mérida lifestyle. Wind down lounging in hammocks on the terrazas, soaking in the pool, or enjoying a drink in the hotel’s perfect little house bar.\n\nis a former Art Deco house with a two-floor addition of contemporary guest rooms all opening onto a rear courtyard. Rooftop jacuzzis offer breezy views over Paseo Montejo and the surrounding neighborhood, and drinks are served in the lobby and on the front porch.\n\nThe largest of the three hotels, is fashioned from two French Neoclassical houses and can’t be missed on Paseo Montejo. Its vibrant Mexican pink walls make it a visual anchor on the avenue. Each room has a private outdoor jacuzzi, but there’s also a pool and spa to enjoy. This boutique hotel has the rare in-house restaurant, which looks out over the avenue.\n\nTips From a Local\n\nWhen you choose and book a hotel, ask them to make advance reservations for all restaurant dinners and excursions. You want your weekend to be relaxed and not stressed.\n\nExploring Centro’s calles also requires sturdy, comfortable shoes. Mérida is a true metropolis, not a beach town. At night men typically wear pants not shorts, and women wear dresses. The atmosphere isn’t fussy, but there is definitely an air of tropical elegance.\n\nHow to Spend a Perfect Weekend in Mérida\n\nFriday Evening\n\nFlights from the United States typically arrive in the afternoon. Uber is readily available in the city, but they cannot pick up at the airport. Ask your hotel to arrange for someone to meet you, or purchase a taxi ride from inside the airport before you exit. You should have plenty of time to check into your hotel and start the transition to tropical time.\n\nDining under the night sky is a hallmark of the Mérida experience. For a city of over a million people, the stars are amazingly still visible—and breezes turn landward pulling in velvet, fresh air from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nFor dinner, head to El Remate which is just steps away from the three hotels I’ve recommended. Their dining room with large street facing windows manages to be both airy and intimate at the same time, especially at night. When the weather is great, though, it’s hard to beat dining at the rooftop terrace bar with its unique view up Montejo. Their menu is inventive featuring local ingredients, especially fresh seafood from the nearby Gulf. Order the pork belly or anything with shrimp.\n\nAnima on Calle 47, the city’s new gastronomic corridor, is another wonderful outdoor dining option. Everything is cooked over or in open fires at the center of the restaurant. While the meats are obvious highlights, there are great vegetarian options. Either way, don’t skip the grilled lettuce salad.\n\nA short walk along Paseo Montejo is the perfect way to wrap up the evening and stretch your legs. Try the marquesitas, a local dessert made and served from sidewalk carts. Rolled up in a freshly made waffle-like crepe, they can be filled with a variety of ingredients, always with a sprinkling of grated Mexican Edam cheese. I recommend a spread of caramel and Nutella—with, yes, the cheese. It’s an explosion of flavors.\n\nFor a sweet anytime until 11 p.m., there is also the open air on Paseo Montejo. A decades-long favorite of locals, they have lots of regional flavors including elote or corn sorbet.\n\nSaturday Morning\n\nWhile there is plenty to see and do in Mérida over a weekend, a visit here almost mandates an excursion into the countryside to explore a Mayan ruin, visit an historic hacienda, and take a dip in one of the countless cenotes. All the rivers in the Yucatán flow underground through a honeycomb of caverns left by the massive meteorite that hit the earth here and wiped out all the dinosaurs on the planet. Cenotes are places where the ceilings of caverns have given way to reveal astonishing clear blue water below.\n\nWhile there are lots of tour operators who organize groups and provide guides, you really only need a driver to stay with you for the full day. Ask for your hotel to arrange an early morning departure. Your driver should already be instructed take you to first to Uxmal (one of the great ancient Mayan cities) followed by Cenotes Hacienda Mucuyché.\n\nYou can buy tickets for Uxmal at the gate, but Cenotes Hacienda Mucuyché requires an advance reservation. Dating back to the 17th century, this beautiful hacienda ruin was once owned by the Peón family, one of the original Spanish families of Mérida.\n\nSaturday Afternoon\n\nAfter a morning of exploring ruins, it's time for a refreshing swim in two cenotes. The Carlota Cenote is semi-open to the sky and the Mayan Blue Cenote is in a cavern with a small opening in its ceiling illuminating the water with a magical beam of light. You’ll immediately understand why the Maya considered cenotes both essential for their water supplies and sacred for their rituals.\n\nThe unique feature at Mucuyché is that the two cenotes are connected by a hacienda canal which allows you to swim between them, not to mention making them much easier to access than most cenotes. Mucuyché has a restaurant (try the panuchos) for lunch and a resort-style swimming pool to enjoy extra time. Your driver will be waiting for the less-than-an-hour return to your hotel’s doorsteps.\n\nSaturday Evening\n\nAfter a long day, you'll be ready for a hearty dinner. I recommend one of two sister restaurants on Calle 47. Oliva Enoteca is authentic Italian dishes all made fresh daily. While it might seem odd to eat Italian food in México, the country is as much of a melting pot as the United States—and you will not be disappointed. Plus, the wine selection is terrific. Pizzeria Oliva, a new addition across the side-street, is a more casual experience with fantastic wood-burning oven pizzas. Again, you will not be disappointed.\n\nSunday Morning\n\nRent a bike from a vendor along Paseo Montejo and follow La Biciruta, the official traffic-free route (Sundays only, 8 a.m.-noon) through Centro. It’s an unforgettable way to see and take in the architectural beauty of the city and its people. Highlights include the Grand Plaza with Catedral de San Ildefonso, the first cathedral completed on the mainland Americas in 1598, and other Colonial-era public buildings.\n\nAfter your bike ride, head to Palacio de Canton, a former private residence that has been converted into a museum, for an enjoyable look at Mayan antiquities. A block down Montejo are Las Casas Cámara (also known as Las Casas Gemelas or The Twin Houses), a pair of matching turn-of-the-20th century French-style mansions that are still private residences. One has recently opened its primary floors for tours that will give you a glimpse into Mérida’s storied wealthy past. Tickets are purchased at the door and English language tours are available.\n\nSunday Afternoon\n\nAcross Montejo is yet another former mansion with a grand central courtyard. Casa T’Hō's rooms have been turned into boutiques that feature Mexican fashion, jewelry, art, and home decor. The full range of Carla Fernandez’s fashion and accessories fill multiple rooms, and there's a unique fragrance line called Xinū that is based on botanicals of the Americas. The courtyard with interior loggias at Casa T’Hō is the perfect place for lunch.\n\nSpend the rest of the afternoon shopping or relaxing at your hotel (or both). Here are a few unique shopping destinations that are easily walkable:\n\nCoqui Coqui Perfumeria has more unique fragrances presented in evocative rooms on the first floor of a former house.\n\nHacienda Sisal or La Tienda Indígena de Trabajadores Artesanales (on Calle 59 just off Calle 60) should be on all textile lovers shopping list. The focus is all Maya-made. There’s a huge selection of handmade products from bedspreads to placemats, and their famous hammocks too. You’ll also find jewelry here. Ask to be shown the finer jewelry in the back rooms. Amber and jade are particularly special for the Maya.\n\nTaller Maya offers home accessories and fashion in contemporary styles, representing more than 200 Yucatecan artisans. You will also find bottles of Melipona honey, unique to the Yucatán. In addition to a wonderful light fruity flavor it has special medicinal properties, too.\n\nKii’ Xocolatl is a Mexican chocolate brand with devoted lovers. In this exclusively chocolate boutique the full product range and scheduled cooking and tasting demonstrations are offered, but don’t skip the chocolate frappe they sell. If you love chocolate, this is not to be missed.\n\nSunday Evening\n\nApoala is the ideal restaurant to wrap up the perfect weekend in Mérida. Tables are nestled under the loggia of an arcade that borders Parque Santa Lucia. Their menu is a fusion of Yucatecan and Oaxacan dishes, which have earned them a top spot on locals’ favorite lists.\n\nYou could be tempted to splurge and explore the whole menu. It’s that good. Instead, to top off your dinner I suggest one last glass of a young mezcal served neat. Your car will be leaving the hotel early the next morning for any flight back. None of us who live here will be surprised if or when you return. We’ll just say, welcome back!"
