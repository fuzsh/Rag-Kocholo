ANCIENT ORIGINS OF MAPMAKING Babylon, 7th Century B.C. • Equal parts empire-building and way- empire- way- finding. • In the early Byzantine period, especially after the 4th century, with the barbarian raids and the founding of Constantinople, a more general need emerged for knowledge of the world: for travel, itineraries, and cartographic descriptions. • To the political and economic incentives was now added the desire of the pilgrims of the new Christian world to travel east to the Holy Land. • The Pianta Grande di Roma (quot;Great Plan of Romequot;) was built from 12 minutely detailed copper plates, covered six by seven feet in its assembled state, and was so accurate that it continued to be used as the basis for government maps of the city until the 1970s.\n\n3. INADVERTENTLY PHILOSOPHICAL: a call to action?\n\n5. SELF & PLACE, LIKE REAL & VIRTUAL: increasingly contiguous…\n\n6. CYBER CARTOGRAPHY (AND NEO GEOGRAPHY AND THE GEOWEB) • One of hottest innovation-drivers on the social web innovation- • Growing interest in connecting and sharing distributed databases via a geospatial data infrastructure (GDI) • Combines geography markup language (GML), scalable vector graphics (SVG), and Web feature service (WFS) specifications in the development of Internet geographic information systems (GIS) . Phew. • Owes much of its inspiration to the locative media movement that sought to expand the use of location-based technologies to encompass personal expression and society • MapQuest has been around since the 1960s -- started out as GeoSystems Global Corporation (GGC) making maps sold in gas stations. GGC launched the MapQuest.com Web site in 1996: 1 million hits in first 30 days. GGC changed its name to MapQuest and a year later, AOL bought the company. • The U.S. Government/military has been an early adopter of geospatial technologies—from GPS to satellite imagery.\n\n7. CARTOGRAPHY + DEMOCRACY = CARTOCRACY • An ancient discipline now available to everyone, not just specialists. Everyone can now contribute to how we “see” the world with a high degree of physical exactitude • Map viewing becomes more intuitive with maps” “slippy maps” • Maps are inherently political (what’s included/left out), so cartocracy is tied to social change. • An an ideal way to visualize the connections between people, place, and power. empathy. Increases empathy. • The imposition of the private on the public: memory and imagination define place Is Oz on Mapquest yet? • Levels the playing field : small businesses can compete with large based on local search alone. • Companies feel the need to have quality data across the globe—inside buildings and out— and are increasingly turning to their users to data. collect this data.\n\n8. OUR ROADMAP 1. Mashups 2. Geotagging/GeoRSS 3. GPS 4. Mobile Social Search 5. Games\n\n9. THE MAPPING MASHUP (MANIA)! • 2006 Google takes the rich data of Wikipedia, Panoramio, and the Google Earth Community and made a browsable layer in Google Earth. Now you can fly anywhere in the world and see what people have written about it, photographed, or posted. • 2008 Google Earth adds geo-located Google News stories to its many layers. • According to programmableweb’s API dashboard, mapping APIs continue to dominate, with Google Maps, Virtual Earth, and Yahoo Maps collectively representing 54% of the leading mashups. mashups.\n\n10. WHAT’S THE THRILL? USING A GOOGLE MAPS MASHUP, YOU CAN… • Pray in the direction of Mecca • Find high risk areas for modern marine pirates • Find out where the daylight is right now • Avoid disease outbreak • Determine ease of doing business in any country • Form a crop circle, send a smoke signal • Drive like a madman • Track world terrorism • Find a public toilet • Make your own map\n\n11. it’ mashup— “I suppose it’s a classic mashup—Fire Eagle + OAuth + Wikipedia + wikinear.com. GeoNames + Google Static Maps = wikinear.com. Excluding templates, the entire application comes in at less than 200 lines of code and took and build.” around two hours to build.”\n\n13. MORE GOOGLE MAPPING MASHUPS…\n\n14. THE HEAVENS! “So, um, what else can we digitize?” (Larry to Serge)\n\n15. GEOTAGGING • Adds geographical identification metadata to various media such as websites, RSS feeds, or images. This data usually consists of latitude and longitude coordinates, though it can also include altitude, bearing, and place names. • Embeds location data into the header of picture files, so that you can associate the picture with the location it was taken • Helps users find a wide variety of location-specific information—for images taken near a given location, enter latitude and longitude coordinates into a Geotagging-enabled image search engine. • Geotagging-enabled information services can also be used to find location-based news, websites, or other resources.\n\n16. GEOTAGGING\n\n17. THE PUSHPIN: PLANTING YOUR FLAG!\n\n20. GEORSS\n\n21. (ENTIRELY) SOCIAL MAPS As of Oct 2007, Platial-Frappr combination represented 25% of all distributed map widgets on the internet and one of the major online mapping sites generally.\n\n22. GPS • GPS (Global Positioning System) adoption remains low: one in six (17%) U.S. adults currently own or use a GPS location device or service. • Among GPS owners, the most widely used devices were small handheld systems (34%) and portable car-mounted GPS systems (33%). Other systems used include GPS- enabled PDAs or laptop computers (26%), cars with integrated GPS systems (25%), cell phones (13%) and other (7%). (Harris Interactive 2007 study) • Online consumers frequently turn to Early Iridium websites that allow them to view static maps phone and get directions online. In the last 30 days a majority (83%) of online adults have used at least one Internet mapping website. (Harris Interactive 2007 study) • 3G iPhone is changing this • Military has been heavily investing in it for decades\n\n23. MOBILE SEARCH Snapping a pix easier than opening a mobile browser\n\n24. AND, QR CODES CAN BE BRANDED!\n\n25. THE GEO TIPPING POINT • An all-in-one, convergence device, the new iPhone 3G can use signals from Wi-Fi hot spots and cellular towers, as well as GPS satellites to pinpoint a location. • Rarely does a new device emerge to threaten the establishment, but the Apple iPhone 3G may prove to be an interesting alternative to today’s portable navigation devices (PND) for wired travelers. • GPS not standard in Android?\n\n26. WHAT MOTIVATES CONSUMERS TO USE DIGITAL MAPS/MAPPING? • Discovery, particularly as locasumers or transumers (consumers in transit) • Social immediacy, social advantage • The Fourth Place (home, work, coffeehouse, “find” or time-sensitive hot spot) • Flaneur-like spontaneity • Political change, citizen empowerment, issue awareness • Personal memory, immortality • Remote-controlled convenience\n\n27.

The spinners go just like a slot machine, and then CLINK, there’s your results!\n\n28. BACKED BY KPCB (OFFICIAL IPHONE APP VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM)\n\n29. NEARBYNOW: KILLER SHOPPING APP? • Shows you a mall map, sales in every store in the mall, and a product search - what stores carry that product. • CHECK STORE INVENTORY and a concierge will call that store not only to verify that it’s in stock, but to tell the retailer to hold it for you. • NearbyNow then sends you an email or text message that tells you he’s done so. • Slated to be released in September/October 2008).\n\n30. IS IT ME? • Take a pix with your iPhone, send it to a group of friends, and let them VOTE ON IT. • You can also enter information about where you saw the item (store list is supplied through geo- location). That way, your friend who is envious of your style sense, can go to her local mall and get the exact same thing or even order it online. • Available Sept/Oct 2008\n\n31. YELP • Functionality taken from Yelp.com: • Find: enter search terms (food, service, neighborhood) • Near: Current location (or enter it in) • Filter criteria: distance from me, price, whether open now • Map • Restaurant/Service info (phone, address, hours) • User Reviews • In the future, you’ll be able to write reviews on your , add pictures, and use more social info.\n\n32. THEFIND • Location-aware app that enables users to search for products they want to buy , and find relevant stores on interactive maps pinpointing local retail locations (identified by “store icons”) near their current physical locations (identified by a “location icon”). • Also shows product availability & price; also (impressively) cross-checks online pricing for items. • Can reserve an item for in-store pickup. • Has over 250 million products, and works with big-box retailers as well as small boutiques. • Will hopefully be available in September for download.\n\n33.
