        "text": "Fourteen\n\n\"Whisf{ie shall put our brains in rage.\" 1715\n\nWhiskey Drinks Whiskey is a potent drink and whiskey is a potent word—^perhaps because both are of Irish extraction. The English pronunciation of the word in use today is based upon a word the ancient Gaels applied to the product of their stills, for it appears they were the original whiskey- makers. The name they gave the distilled spirit was singularly fitting they called it uisgebeatha. If we dissect the word we find that uisge (pronounced oosh'gee) means \"water,\" beatha means \"life,\" and the two combined mean \"water of life.\" All of which goes to prove you can't beat the Irish for apt naming. In time this potent pro duct of Ould Ireland's stills became \"whiskbae,\" later \"whiskie,\" and finally just plain \"whiskey.\" The Scots likewise were distillers of this ancient and honorable liquid. They adopted the original name the Irish gave to the white spirit which flowed from their stills, the word going through a similar sequence of pro nunciation until it became \"whisky\" without the e —note spelling on any bottle of Scotch. We have much for which to thank the Irish, but whis key rates a top place on the list. A toast to the Irish! And what drink may better serve such purpose than one of the many whiskey cocktails mixed to perfection as in New Orleans ? Make it an Old Fashioned, a Sazerac, a Manhattan, a julep, a highball, or just plain whiskey. Whichever it may be, fill 'em up and drink 'em down to the original whiskey-makers—the Irish!\n\n\"Whis^ee—Pa! Give me a Glass of that Rhenish!\" 1753\n\nFifteen\n\nHighballs\n\n1 jigger rye whiskey, or,\n\nBourbon whiskey, Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, cognac brandy, applejack, gin,\n\n•\n\nrum.\n\nfizz water ice\n\nThe dictionary lowdown on highball: \"a long drink of diluted spirits, usually whiskey, served in a tall glass with cracked ice.\" Like all popular drinks, the highball is conspicuous for its variety. Any spirituous liquor will answer—it depends upon individual preference. Some like rye with seltzer water, some Bourbon; others hold that the spirit of the drink should be Scots whisky, and still others de mand Irish whiskey. Brandy, rum, applejack, all have their advocates, and there are even benighted souls who crave gin in their highballs. As they used to say out West: \"Name your own poison, gents!\" For the fizz accompaniment use whichever of these appeals to you—seltzer, club soda, white rock, ginger ale, coca cola, seven-up. Connoisseurs, as a rule, insist that only cold water be poured upon their whiskey.\n\nSixteen\n\nThe Sazerac Cocktoil\n\nOldtimers will tell you the three outstanding drinks of New Orleans in the memory of living men were the dripped absinthe frappe of the Old Absinthe House, the Ramos gin fizz, and the Sazerac cocktail. As previously related, the American cocktail was not only born in Old New Orleans but was given its curious name in the city's famous Vieux Carre. There are cock tails and cocktails but the best known of all New Or leans cocktails is unquestionably the Sazerac. The fact that it originated in New Orleans gave rise to the legend that it was first concocted by and named for an old Loui siana family, legend without fact as no such Louisiana family ever existed. A barbershop now holds forth in a building on the right hand side of the first block in Royal street going down from Canal, and before its doors, still remains lettered in the sidewalk the word \"SAZERAC.\" This denotative indicated the entranceway to a once well- patronized bar on the Exchange Alley side of the build ing. It was here the drink famed far and wide as a Sazerac cocktail was mixed and dispensed. It was here it was christened with the name it now bears. For years one of the favorite brands of cognac imported\n\nSeventeen\n\ninto New Orleans was a brand manufactured by the firm of Sazerac-de-Forge et fils, of Limoges, France. The local agent for this firm was John B. Schiller. In 1859 Schiller opened a liquid dispensary at 13 Exchange Alley, naming it \"Sazerac Coffee-house\" after the brand of cognac §erved exclusively at his bar. Schiller's brandy cocktails became the drink of the day and his business flourished, surviving even the War Between the States. In 1870 Thomas H. Handy, his bookkeeper, succeeded as proprietor and changed the name to \"Sazerac House.\" An alteration in the mixture also took place. Peychaud's bitters was still used to add the right fillip, but American rye whiskey was substi tuted for the cognac to please the tastes of Americans who preferred \"red likker\" to any pale-faced brandy. Thus brandy vanished from the Sazerac cocktail to be replaced by whiskey (Handy always used Maryland Club rye, if you are interested in brand names), and the dash of absinthe was added. Precisely when whiskey replaced brandy and the dash of absinthe added are moot questions. The absinthe innovation has been credited to Leon Lamothe who in 1858 was a bartender for Emile Seignouret, Charles Cavaroc &Co., a wine im porting firm located in the old Seignouret mansion still standing at 520 Royal street. More likely it was about 1870, when Lamothe was employed at Pina's restaurant in Burgundy street that he experimented with absinthe and made the Sazerac what it is today. But this history delving is dry stuff, so let's sample a genuine Sazerac. We will ask Leon Dupont, now vice- president of the St. Regis Restaurant but for years one of the expert cocktail mixers behind Tom Handy's origi nal Sazerac bar, to make one for us. Eighteen\n\nHere's how—and how!\n\n3>iO\n\n1 lump sugar 3 drops Peychaud's bitters 1 dash Angostura hitters 1 jigger rye whiskey 1 dash absinthe substitute 1 slice lemon peel\n\nTo mix a Sazerac requires two heavy-bottomed, 3J^-ounce bar glasses. One is filled with cracked ice and allowed to chill. In the other a lump of sugar is placed with. just enough water to moisten it. The saturated loaf of sugar is then crushed with a barspoon. Add a few drops of Peychaud's hitters, a dash of ^gostura, a jigger of rye whiskey, for. while Bourbon may do tor a julep it just won't do for a real Sazerac. To the glass con taining sugar, bitters, and rye add several lumps of ice and stir. Never use a shaker! Empty the first glass of its ice, dash in several drops of absinthe, twirl the glass and shake out the absinthe . . . enough will cling to the glass to give the needed flavor. Strain into this glass the whiskey mixture, twist a piece of lemon peel over it for the needed zest of that small drop of oil thus extracted from the peel, but do not commit the sacrilege of dropping the peel into the drink. Some bartenders put a cherry in a Sazerac; very pretty hut not necessary. M-m-m-m-m! Let's have another, Leon! Kentucky Whiskey Cocktail 1 jigger Bourbon whiskey 1 jigger unsweetened pineapple juice 1 lump sugar Dissolve the sugar in the pineapple juice. Pour in the jigger of Bourbon. Then some lumps of ice. Stir. Strain in serving glass. This cocktail could be made with rye whiskey, but then you'd not be privileged to attach the name Ken tucky to it. Some make the same drink with orange juice instead of pineapple, and some use sweetened pine apple juice. If the latter, be wary of the amount of sugar you use.\n\nNineteen\n\nOld Fashioned Cocktail 1 lump sugar\n\n2 dashes Peychaud or Angostura bitters 1 jigger rye whiskey 1 piece lemon peel\n\n1 chunk pineapple 1 slice orange peel 2 maraschino cherries\n\nInto a heavy-bottomed barglass drop a lump of sugar, dash on the bitters, and crush with a spoon. Pour in the jigger of rye whiskey and stir with several lumps of ice. No shaking allowed! Let the mixture remain in the glass in which it is prepared. Gar nish with a half-ring of orange peel, add the chunk of pineapple, and the cherries with a little of the maraschino juice. Twist the slice of lemon peel over all and serve in the mixing glass with the barspoon. Old Fashioned? Yea, verily, but as appealing to smart tastes now as on that certain Derby Day a half century ago when the originator, whoever he may have been, first stirred it into being at the Pendennis Club, in Louis ville, Kentucky. The Old Fashioned has been a New Orleans institu tion for many years and when other whiskey mixtures, garnished with fancy names, have passed on and been forgotten, the Old Fashioned will continue to tickle ex perienced palates. Don't let anyone tell you that gin, rum, or brandy can take the place of whiskey in an Old Fashioned. Turn a deaf ear to such heresy. A real Old Fashioned demands rye whiskey. Remember, Bourbon won't do. In the old days before the Great Mistake the Old Fashioned contained less fruit than it does today. How- beit, the expert barkeep of pre-prohibition days never neglected to twist a slice of lemon peel over the glass be fore serving. Twenty\n\nBlue Blazer\n\n1 lump sugar 1 jigger Scotch whisky 1 jigger hot water\n\nHave two mugs, earthenware or metal, and in one dissolve the lump of sugar in the hot water. Now add the Scots whisky; be sure it's a good brand with plenty of alcoholic content for it has to burn. Ignite the mixture. Hold the burning mug in one hand, then empty the fluid rapidly from one container to the other so that a streak of blue flame connects the two. ^rve in a hot-drink glass after twisting a bit of lemon peel over the mix ture and topping with a grating of nutmeg. If you have cold feet, chattering teeth, shivers, frozen fingers, or chilblains, in other words, if you're cold, and want to warm up the inner man, you can do no better than thaw out with a Blue Blazer. This drink was a popular tipple aboard the palatial paddle-wheeled steamboats that churned the waters of the Mississippi during the time the Natchez and t^e Robert E. Lee made history in upstream races to Samt Louis. The barkeeps were expert in transferrmg the blue-flamed liquid from one mug to another, accom plishing the feat with an agility that kept the flames from singeing their walrus-like moustaches. You c^ do the same, (with or wihtout the moustaches) but be cautious; if any of this hot Scotch gets on your fingers they'll burn like blue blazes!\n\nTwenty-one\n\nManhattan Cocktail\n\n1 lump sugar 1 dash Peychaud bitters 1 dash Angostura bitters '/2 jigger rye whiskey Vi jigger Italian vermouth 1 slice lemon peel\n\nDrop a lump of sugar in a barglass, moisten with a very little water, dash on it the two bitters and crush with a barspoon. Add Ae rye whiskey (don't use Bourbon) and then the vermouth. Drop several lumps of ice into the glass and stir. After straining into the cocktail glass, twist a bit of lemon peel over the mixture to extract the atom of oil, drop in a maraschino cherry with a very httle of the sirup. There are almost as many recipes for a real Manhattan cocktail as there are skyscrapers in Little Old New York, or ways of getting into heaven. The Manhattan, origi- nated at the old Delmonico Restaurant in New York during the bibulous 90's, was composed of one-third Italian vermouth, and two-thirds Bourbon whiskey. Nat- ^ally, the formula has been improved upon in New Orleans; you 11 note we always improve upon things to eat and drink in this New Orleans. Just an old Southern custom! The Manhattan as served over the better New Orleans bars has always had that certain something it lacks else where. Reason: in first-class establishments the mixol ogists use rye for the whiskey and the drink is stirred— never shaken. Properly mixed with good brands of hquor, the Manhattan is one of the finest drinks that flourishes under the name of cocktail, and well deserves the reputation that \"it is the most popular cocktail in the world.\" Twenty-two\n\nDry Manhattan\n\n1 lump sugar 1 dash Peychaud bitters 1 dash Angostura bitters 1/3 jigger rye whiskey 1/3 jigger Italian vermouth 1/3 jigger French vermouth 1 slice lemon peel\n\nThis is mixed exactly as is the Manhattan. Must not be shaken— a brisk stirring with large lumps of ice is the proper procedure. Fine or crushed ice has a tendency to make drinks cloudy and whiskey cocktails should have a clear amber color. Put a cherry in the cocktail glass before straining in the mixture. There are cocktail quaflers who object to the sweet ness of the Manhattan made in the orthodox manner and prefer a dry Manhattan. The dryer drink is made by using a third of a jigger each of the rye, the Italian, and the French vermouths. When dropping the cherry into the cocktail glass do not include any of the sirup. Whiskey Cocktail 1 lump sugar Use a heavy-bottomed barglass and drop in a lump of sugar. Moisten with a little water, add the two bitters, then ^sh with a spoon. Put in the curagao, then the jigger of rye, and stir with several lumps of ice. Strain into the serving glass. Finally ^ist a sliver of lemon peel over the mixture. That adds the uny drop of oil necessary for the perfect result. The whiskey cocktail is one of the old-time appetizer drinks masquerading under a variety of names in dif ferent parts of the country. Follow this recipe and you will agree it's a cocktail deserving its wide popularity. Twenty-three 6-7 drops Angostura bitters 5-6 drops Peychaud bitters 1 teaspoon curajao 1 jigger rye whiskey\n\nCocktail a la Louisiane 1/3 jigger rye whiskey 1/3 jigger Italian vermouth 1/3 jigger Benedictine\n\n3-4 dashes absinthe substitute 3-4 dashes Peychaud bitters Mx in barglass with lumps of ice. Strain into a cocktail glass in which has been placed a maraschino cherry. This is the special cocktail served at RestuuTunt de lu Louisiune, one of the famous French restaurants of New Orleans, long the rendezvous of those who appreciate the best in Creole cuisine. La Louisiane cocktail is as out-of-the-ordinary as the many distinctive dishes that grace its menu.\n\nOrange Whiskey Cocktail 1 jigger rye whiskey 1 jigger orange juice 1 jigger charged water 1 dash Peychaud bitters 1 lump sugar\n\nMix the ingredients in a barglass, pour into a shaker with crushed ice and shake vigorously. Strain into chilled cocktail glass. Prepare in generous quantities, for your guests will offer their glasses for more. While rye is indicated in the recipe you may substitute Bourbon if that is your choice ... but sidestep Scotch or Irish. The addition of the carbonated water gives this one a little more sparkle than if you use plain water. The same cocktail can be made by substituting Orange Wine for the orange juice. In some New Orleans homes the celebrated Louisiana Orange Wine, made in the orange groves below the city, is used in preference to the plain orange juice. Many experts prefer Bourbon to rye in this particular cocktail. Ttventy-jour\n\nPlace d'Armes Cocktail 54 orange—^juice only Yz lemon—juice only Yz lime—juice only 1 pony grenadine sirup 1 jigger whiskey\n\nSqueeze the fruit juices in a mixing glass. Add the sirup; be careful not to make it too sweet if you like a dry drink . . . Otherwise use a little sugar. Then add the whiskey—some prefer Bourbon, others rye. Rye is usually better in any mixed drink. Strain into a tall glass half-filled with crushed ice. Decorate with a sprig of mint, after frapp^ing well with a spoon. Of course, this gallant cocktail might be called a Jack son Square as readily as a Place d'Armes or, if you speak Spanish, how about Plaza de Armas? But its originator called it a Place d'Armes, and we'll stick to that. It was so named in honor of the grassy tree-shaded square front ing the Cathedral and the Cabildo, where General An drew Jackson sits astride a rearing battle steed, holding aloft his chapeau in perpetual politeness. He would have enjoyed this cocktail!\n\nTwenty-five\n\nRoffignac Cocktail 1 jigger whiskey 1 pony sirup\n\nseltzer or soda water ra§pberry sirup\n\nPour into a highball glass the jigger of whiskey (or use cognac, as in the original drink). Add the sirup, which may be rasp- berry, grenadine, or. red Hembarig, the sweetening used in New Orleans a century ago. Add the soda water. Ice, of course. Joseph Rofl&gnac, before he fled his native land of France at the time of the Revolution, was Count Louis Philippe Joseph de Roffignac. In time he became a lead ing merchant in New Orleans, the city of his adoption, and its mayor for eight years. He fought the British under \"Old Hickory\" at the Battle of New Orleans, served in the state legislature, and was a banker of note. As mayor he introduced street lighting, and laid the first cobblestones in Royal street. For all his many honors, Roffignac's name comes to us through the years linked with a favorite tipple of Old New Orleans—the Roffig While not so celebrated as A. A. Peychaud's cocktail, it was equally potent. The red Hembarig mentioned in the directions for mixing was a popular sirup when old New Orleans was young. nac.\n\nTwenty-six\n\n\"An Ordinary Virginian rises about six o'cloc\\. He then drin\\s a julep made of rum, and sugar but very strong.\" 1787.\n\nJuleps\n\nThe word Julep is an old and honored one and can be traced as far back as A. D. 1400—long before we ever heard of the Southern States of these United States,where the julep is popularly supposed to be indigenous. For centuries the julep has been described as \"some thing to cool or assuage the heat of passion,\" and \"a sweet drink prepared in different ways.\" We know noth ing of the first definition but will confirm the second statement that it can be made in different ways. The earliest form of the word was iulep. Arabs called it julab, the Portuguese julepe, the Italians giulehhe, Latins named it julapium, Persians, gul-ab, meaning \"rose water.\" The Greeks, alas, did not have a word for it! ]ulep, as we spell it, is French. All this being settled, let us get on with our juleping. Don't use rye whiskey in making a julep. If you do use whiskey let it be Bourbon, which serves its highest purpose when it becomes a component part of that prince of all thirst-quenchers known as the Mint Julep. There are many kinds of mint juleps, one for nearly every Southern State—such as Kentucky, Georgia, Vir ginia, Maryland, Louisiana juleps. We give several of the most popular recipes. \"The first thing he did upon getting out of bed was to call for a fulep and I date my own love for whiskey from mixing and tasting my young master's juleps.\" 1804. Twenty-seven\n\nMint Julep\n\n1 teaspoon sugar 1 dozen mint leaves 1 jigger Bourbon whiskey 1 j)ony nun\n\nPut the mint leaves into a tall glass in which the julep is to be served. Add the sugar and crush in a little water. Pour in the Bourbon whiskey, then the rum, and fill the glass with shaved ice. Jiggle the mixture with a long-handled spoon (do not stir) until the outside of the glass or metal goblet is heavily frosted. Arrange a bouquet of several sprigs of mint on top just before handing to the recipient, who will ever after bless you. Naturally, one is aware that he takes his life in his hands by even suggesting the way a real mint julep should be prepared, for there are as many recipes for this truly Southern drink as there are southern states in the Union. Julep experts—may their tribe never decrease!—know that correct and authentic recipes take on changes in pass ing from one state to another. Southern colonels, to say nothing of majors, captains, and buck privates, have been known to call for pistols under the duelling oaks when it is even hinted that mint leaves be crushed in prepar ing a julep. Other colonels, majors, etc., emit fire and brimstone, and a Bourbon-laden breath, if the pungent leaves are not crushed in the bottom of the glass and a bouquet of short-to-measure sprigs placed on top in which to snuggle the nose while the nectar is being withdrawn with a reverent, albeit, audible sucking through a straw. There is also a difference of opinion concerning the variety of spirits that go into the making. In the recipe above the pony of rum may be added or subtracted—it all depends on your drinking mathematics. Rum, how ever, gives added zest to a regulation whiskey julep. Twenty-eight\n\nThe one thing upon which the two mint julep schools are fully agreed is this: it was a julep the two C^ohna governors had in mind when making ^eir celebrated observation regarding the length of time between drmks.\n\nKentucky Mint Julep 1 lump sugar ? sprigs of mint leaves\n\n? jiggers Bourbon whiskey. Note the absence of the amount of Boujon to be used—th^'s important in a julep, no matter from w at which must that is lacking in the above recipe is the shaved ice whiA must go il £ Ilass or metal goblet in which the ,ulep is com pounded. While Georgia may be able to make gwd the boast that the mint julep originated within her ^ appears to be no successful refutation of Kentucky s claim that the Blue Grass State drink. However divided ^J leaves should be crushed or merely dunked, one ^ng is certain-no Kentucky gentleman, far less a Kenmcky colonel, would ever sanction a recipe which placed limitations on the amount of Bourbon that goes into the making. Nor will we here entangle ourselves in the age-long controversy-should a julep be sucked through a straw or drunk from the container? Kentuckians vociferously maintain that the use of astraw rums ajulep. We have tried Kentucky julep with a straw and without both work! On one of his many visits to New Orleans \"Marse Henry\" Watterson, one-time beloved editor of the Louis- Twenty-nine\n\nville Courier-Journal, told a young newspaper reporter his recipe for a real Kentucky mint julep. \"Take a silver goblet, son, one that will hold at least a pmt, and dissolve a lump of loaf sugar in it with not more than a tablespoon of water. Take one mint leaf, no more, and crush it gently between the thumb and orefinger before dropping it into the dissolved sugar. • \\ 5 goblet nearly to the brim with shaved into it all the Bourbon whiskey the goblet will * Take a few sprigs of mint leaves and use for decorating the top of the mixture, after it has been well frapped with a spoon. Then drink it. But,\" warned Marse Henry, \"do not use a straw, son.\" I know that this was Marse Henry's version of a real Kentucky mint julep, for I was the young—and thirsty —newspaper reporter. 1 teaspoon powdered sugar 1 pony cognac brandy 1 pony peach brandy sprigs of tender mint shoots Use the goblet in which the julep is to be served. Place some of j '\"'\"'if''®® f bottom, with the sugar and a litde water, and muddle or bruise the leaves. Add the cognac and peach brandy. Fill ^e goblet with finely crushed ice. Jiggle with the long-handled barspoon until well frapped. Jiggling is not stirring. Stirring calls for a rotary motion, but \"jiggling\" is dashing the spoon up and down st^eadily until the outside of the goblet is frosted. Place the metal or glass container on atable to do your jiggling —do not hold the glass for heat of the hand will hinder frost from forming on the outside. When the julep has Thirty Georgia Mint Julep\n\nbeen thoroughly jiggled, thrust in a bunch of the ten- derest mint shoots arranged to simulate a bouquet. This julep is to be absorbed with a straw, a short one so that the drinker's nose is buried in the very heart of the green nosegay as he drinks, thus adding the de light of aroma to the delight of taste.\n\nSan Domingo Julep\n\n1 piece of loaf sugar\n\nl'/2 jigger rum\n\nsprigs of mint Into a tall glass (preferably a metal goblet) drop the sugar and moisten with a Uttle water. Take several mint leaves and crush while the sugar is being muddled with the barspoon. Fill with shaved or finely crushed ice. Pour in the rum. Jiggle to frappe the mixture. Set a bouquet of mint leaves on top before serving. Aslice of orange peel for garnish is ritzy but not strictly necessary. This seems to be the original mint julep that came to Louisiana away back in 1793, at the time the white aristocrats, who were expelled from San Domingo by the uprising of the blacks, settled in New Orleans. In the United States, especially those states south of the Mason and Dixon line, Bourbon whiskey gradually took the place of sugar cane rum as the spirit of the drink. Many advocate the use of both red whiskey and rum in making a julep, but if you wish to quaff the original San Domingo julep use rum alone. Any of the well- known imported or domestic brands will do, such as Bacardi, Cabildo, Carioca, Pontalba, Rumrico, Charles ton, Don Q., Puerto Rico, Jamaica, St. Croix, Red Heart, or Pilgrim. Thirty-one\n\nBrandy Mint Julep\n\n1 spoon powdered sugar 1 pony Bourbon whiskey 1 pony peach brandy sprigs of mint leaves Mix as directed for the juleps in preceding pages. Use plenty of crushed ice and frappe with the long-handled barspoon. It is rank heresy even to mention it, but some Georgia julep experts make theirs by substituting Bourbon whis key for cognac brandy. Whichever you use, Bourbon or brandy, remember that quicker and prettier frosting will result if you use a silver or other metal goblet rather than glass. The outside of the container must be kept dry if it is to take on a good frost, so do not hold it in\n\nyour hand when jiggling. Sf. Regis Mint Julep\n\n1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon water\n\n1 dozen mint leaves 1 jigger rye whiskey 14 pony rum 1 dash grenadine sirup\n\nInto a tall glass crush the mint leaves with a barspoon. Dissolve die sugar in water and stir. Pour in the whiskey and rum, then the grenadine sirup. Fill the glass with crushed ice and jiggle with the spoon. When properly frapped decorate the top with sprigs of mint. This recipe departs in two ways from the usual . . . the use of rye for Bourbon and the introduction of grena dine sirup. In spite of its straying from the neither straight nor narrow path of Bourbon, this julep is ex ceedingly good on a hot day, or any day, for that matter. It is the julep that is served at the St. Regis Restaurant bar and is the pride of head-bartender John Swago. Thirty-two\n\nLouisiana Mini- Julep\n\n1 teaspoon powdered sugar jigger Bourbon whiskey sprigs of mint crushed ice\n\nPut a dozen leaves of mint in a barglass, cover with powdered sugar and just enough water to dissolve the sugar. Crush sugar and mint leaves gently with a muddler or barspoon. Pour half the mint and sugar liquid in the bottom of the tall glass in which the julep is to be served. Then enough shaved or snowball ice to half fill. Next add the remaining mint and sugar liquid, fill nearly to the top with shaved ice. Pour, in the Bourbon until the glass is full to the brim. Place in the refrigerator at least an hour before serving to acquire ripeness and frost. Top with mint sprigs. Time was when the mint julep was strictly a symbol of the South—a green and silver emblem of Dixie's friendly leisure. But today the mint julep, that most glorious of summer drinks, is becoming as popular above the Mason and Dixon line as below it. Some term the Louisiana julep the last word in per fection, so if you have the feeling you haven't sampled a real julep, try the above. If you are still in doubt and are willing to go to some trouble, try the one below. New Orleans Mint Julep Put the glasses or the metal goblets in the refrigerator the night before you are to serve juleps. This is a high- powered julep so you'll need two jiggers of Bourbon for every glass. In the serving glass drop a layer of mint leaves, fill one-quarter full with shaved or snow ball ice, then one teaspoon of powdered sugar. Repeat until the glass is half ibll. Add one jigger of Bourbon. Repeat until the glass is full, the second jigger of Bour bon being the last to go into the glass. Serve on a tray with a straw or tube in each goblet so that hand does not touch the container, which is frosted white. Thirty-three\n\n\"Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame, thy sugred tongue to bitter wormwood taste.\" Sha\\espeare's Lucrece. 1593.\n\nAbsinthe Drinks According to some authorities, absinthe as a drink originated in Algeria, and French soldiers serving in the Frango-Algerian war (1830-47) introduced the green spirits to Paris upon their return from the North African country where the drink foimd strong favor along the boulevards. . In time the spectacle of bearded men and demi-mondes dripping their absinthes became one of the sights of Paris. Naturally, so fashionable a Parisian drink was not long in finding its way to the Little Paris of North America—New Orleans. The drink, which was spelled absynthe in New Or leans liquor advertisements in 1837, when it was appar ently first imported from France and Switzerland, was a liquor distilled from a large number of various herbs, roots, seeds, leaves, and barks steeped in anise. It also included Artemisia ashinthium, a herb known as \"Wormwood' abroad, but called Herbe Sainte by the French-speaking population of Louisiana. In recent years wormwood has been condemned as harmful and habit- forming, and laws have been enacted forbidding its use in liquors in the United States and other countries. In addition to banning wormwood from manufactured liquor, the use of the word \"absinthe\" on bottles of modern concoctions which do not contain wormwood, is also banned. As a consequence, manufacturers of ab sinthe substitutes have been forced to adopt trade names. Thirty-four\n\nOld Absinthe House Of all the ancient buildings in New Orleans' famed Vieux Carr6, none has been more glorified in story and picture than a square, plastered-brick building at the corner of Bourbon and Bienville streets, known as \"The Old Absinthe House.\" Hoary legend has long set forth that the building was erected in 1752, 1774, 1786, 1792, but as a matter of fact it was actually built in 1806 for the importing and com mission firm of Juncadella & Font, Catalonians from Barcelona, Spain. In 1820, after Francisco Juncadella died and Pedro Font returned to his native land, the place continued as a commission house for the barter of foodstuffs, tobacco, shoes, clothing, as well as liquids in bulk from Spain, and was conducted by relatives of the builders. Later it became an epicerie, or grocery shop; for several years it was a cordonnerie, or boot and shoe store, and not until 1846 did the ground floor corner room become a coffee-house, as saloons were then called. This initial liquid-refreshment establishment was run by Jacinto Aleix, a nephew of Senora Juncadella, and was known as \"Aleix's Coffee-House.\" In 1869, Caye- tano Ferrer, a Catalan from Barcelona, who had been a bar-keeper at the French Opera House, transferred his talents to the old Juncadella casa and became principal drink-mixer for the Aleix brothers. In 1874, Cayetano himself leased the place, calling it the \"Absinthe Room\" Thirty-five\n\nbecause of the potent dripped absinthe he served in the Parisian manner. His drink became so popular that it won fame not only for Cayetano, but for the balance of his family as well—papa, mamma, Uncle Leon, and three sons, Felix, Paul, and Jacinto, who helped to attend the wants of all and sundry who crowded the place. What the customers came for chiefly was the emerald liquor into which, tiny drop by tiny drop, fell water from the -brass faucets of the pair of fountains that decorated the long cypress bar. These old fountains, relics of a romantic past, remained in the Casa ]uncadella for many years. Came prohibition when the doors of \"The Old Absinthe House\" were padlocked by a United States mar shal, and the contents of the place went under the ham mer. Pierre Cazebonne purchased the prized antiques, together with the old bar, and set them up in another liquid refreshment parlor a block farther down Bourbon street, where signs now inform the tourist that therein is to be found the original \"Old Absinthe Bar' and anti que fountains, and we find the marble bases pitted from the water which fell, drop by drop, from the faucets over the many years they served their glorious mission. In these modern years the tourist yearning for an old flavor of the Old New Orleans to carry back as a memory of his visit, goes to 400 Bourbon street, not only to see the venerable fountains and bar, but to be served absinthe frappe by a son of Cayetano Ferrer, the Spaniard who established \"The Old Absinthe House.\" Jacinto Ferrer (we who know him call him \"Josh\") should indeed know how to prepare the drink properly for he has been at it 65 years. Josh served his apprenticeship in his father's celebrated \"Absinthe Room\" in W2, and today at three-score-years-and-ten, carries on with an air the profession at which he began his apprenticeship as a five- year-old boy. Thirty-six\n\nDripped Absinthe Frangaise 1 lump sugar 1 jigger absinthe substitute 1 glass cracked ice\n\nPour the jigger of absinthe substitute into a barglass filled with cracked ice.

This recipe is for the original dripped absinthe that made famous Cayetano Ferrer's \"Old Absinthe House when he introduced the Parisian drink to New Orleans —the drink containing oil of wormwood which instigat ed the banishing of the word \"Absinthe\" ftoi^ bottle labels. It is the same dripped absinthe, the \"Fairy with Green Eyes,\" described in Marie Corelli's famous book \"Wormwood.\" Today, the absinthe substitutes are free of the hari^ul extract of the herb Artemisia absinthium, and entirely safe when imbibed (in moderation) at any bar.\n\nAbsinthe Cocktail\n\n1 jigger absinthe substitute 1 teaspoon sugar sirup 1 dash anisette 2 dashes Peychaud bitters 2 ounces charged water\n\nFill a highball glass a little more than half full wiA cracked or crushed ice.
