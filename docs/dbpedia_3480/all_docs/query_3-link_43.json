        "text": "Resting together in Woodlawn Cemetery’s Spiraea plot are entertainers Bert Williams and wife Charlotte “Lottie” Thompson Williams (seen together in the second picture above.) Bert’s mother Julia rests with them; Julia and her husband Frederick emigrated to America from the West Indies with Bert when he was a young boy (I’ve read in different places that Bert was born in the Bahamas and that he was born in Antigua, so I can’t say definitively!)\n\nIn the late 1800s-early 1900s, Bert Williams and his professional partner George Walker were a popular act in minstrel shows, vaudeville and the Broadway stage. Though it’s unimaginable and uncomfortable to us in the modern day, Williams wore “blackface”, and initially the duo promoted themselves as “The Real Coons” to differentiate themselves from the many white entertainers of that era who performed in blackface acts.\n\nBert Williams was a reserved, introverted man in his private life, and he discovered that blacking his face with burnt cork brought out a completely different comical side of himself, a whole new stage persona. It was a double-edged sword, both a blessing and a curse to him throughout his career.\n\nWilliams & Walker became a wildly popular comedy team with both black and white audiences. When George Walker had to drop out of the act in 1909 due to illness after 16 years together, Bert Williams became even more famous as a solo performer and would for a time be the highest paid black performer ever.\n\nWhen Williams joined The Ziegfeld Follies show in 1910 (and returned for several years afterwards,) he became the first black entertainer to share the same stage with white entertainers, including women, something unheard of at that time. Some of the white entertainers complained to Flo Ziegfeld privately about it and were told if they didn’t like it they could leave, because they could be replaced but Bert Williams could not!\n\nNot all the white entertainers Bert Williams worked with were bigots; he and white comedian Leon Errol happily worked as a team, writing and performing several skits on stage together for the 1911 Follies; Williams also worked for a time with famous stage comic Eddie Cantor, who gushed about Williams’ talent. W.C. Fields himself said of Bert Williams, “He was the funniest man I ever saw, and the saddest man I ever knew.”\n\nAs for Lottie Williams, she was a singer who married Bert Williams in 1899 and according to the Broadway Internet Database performed in several shows from 1901-1906, including appearing along with her husband in Walker & Williams stage productions of “In Dahomey”, “Sons of Ham” and “Abyssinia.” She retired from the business once Bert joined the Follies.\n\nBert Williams & George Walker’s New York production of “In Dahomey” was ground-breaking; opening in 1903 it was the first ever full-length musical with a black cast on Broadway, pre-dating “Shuffle Along” by almost two decades! The “In Dahomey” cast then travelled to London, opening the show at the Shaftesbury Theatre in 1904; while there they gave a special command performance at Buckingham Palace for King Edward VII as part of a birthday celebration for the young Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII.)\n\nLottie was several years older than Bert and they never had children (though Bert’s nickname for her was “Mother”!) They lived quietly in a home filled with books (Bert was a known bookworm) at 2309 Seventh Avenue in Harlem until Bert’s death at age 46 in 1922. Bert had been touring with his final show, “Under The Bamboo Tree” when he collapsed on stage midway through a performance. He travelled home to New York suffering from pneumonia and died at his home on March 4, 1922. Lottie passed away in 1929.\n\nThe symbol you see on Bert Williams’ monument above his name shows that he was a Mason; he had joined the Waverly Lodge of Scotland when he was in Europe appearing in “In Dahomey” (at that time black men were barred from joining Masonic Lodges in the U.S.) When Bert Williams was dying, he wrote a letter to New York’s St. Cecile Lodge requesting a Masonic funeral service; St. Cecile’s was known at the time for being popular with theatre entertainers. Even though Bert was not a member of St. Cecile’s Lodge they agreed to do it; according to their website they conducted the first ever Masonic funeral service held for a black man in the State of New York on March 8, 1922. The temple was completely filled and crowds stood outside in the street to pay their respects.\n\nYou’ll note the footstone reading “Husband Egbert Austin”–Egbert Austin was Bert’s first and middle name. (Forgive my poor pictures, always tough to get good ones on a sunny day.)\n\nBert Williams recorded many songs, some of them going back to early wax cylinder recordings; his most famous was “Nobody” (a song he grew tired of but his audiences never did.) His recording of “Nobody” and others can be found via YouTube; there is also some footage of him on film available to view there: A sampling of his audio recordings:\n\nNobody (from 1906):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovy6rknFWnk\n\nGood Morning Carrie (from 1902, this is both Williams & George Walker) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOR0ep3f4Mc\n\nHe’s a Cousin of Mine: (1907)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIVu7eWtf8Q\n\nI’ve such a funny feeling when I look at you: (1906) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SuamLpj6H4\n\nWhen the Moon Shines on the Moonshine (1919):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmXubLCsF7o\n\nVideo recording (this has NO sound at all):\n\nBert Williams’ 1916 film “Natural Born Gambler”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIghOyFvAaw Fish:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjjOwAce5UI In 1913 Bert Williams starred in an all-black cast silent movie called “Lime Kiln Field Day” which was unusual for having a black and white crew working together behind the scenes on the project. Though it was never released and the film had not been seen in decades, some footage of it was found a few years ago in the Museum of Modern Art’s archive, and they showed it at a special exhibition. A NY Times story about the film and the exhibit can be read here (with a short clip from the film included:) https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/nyregion/coming-soon-a-century-late-a-black-film-gem.html?_r=0\n\nBert Williams’ Wikipedia page:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Williams"
