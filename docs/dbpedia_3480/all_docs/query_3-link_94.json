        "text": "Lottie Tomlinson has discussed the tragic deaths of her mother and sister and how she has 'got to a good point' with her grief after undergoing counselling.\n\nLottie, 21 -who is the sister of One Direction star Louis - and her family, lost their mother Johannah Deakin in December 2016 aged 43, following a battle with leukaemia.\n\nIn March 2019, the family suffered further devastation when sister Félicité Tomlinson died accidentally, aged just 18, from an overdose of cocaine, anxiety drug Xanax and painkillers.\n\nAppearing on Monday's episode of Lorraine, the social media sensation, who is a new ambassador for bereavement support charity Sue Ryder, revealed therapy after Félicité's death helped her with the grieving process.\n\nDiscussing her mother's death in 2016, she said: 'It was really fast. That made it harder. We didn't have time to get our head around things and process it. She was the best.\n\n'She made her whole life about us and did everything for us. She was the sweetest, kindest woman.\n\nLorraine asked: 'And then three years later, your poor sister. Has you learned anything that helped you?'\n\nLottie said: 'I feel like I was able to deal with it a lot better with my sister. I had picked up a few coping mechanisms.\n\n'I got extra help when my sister died than when my mum died. I want people to know that you can get help.\n\nIt does really help with the grieving process when you go and speak to someone.\n\n'A lot of people try and deal with it themselves but I think it's important that you don't go through it alone.\n\nLottie said the support from Louis' fans as well as Sue Ryder had enabled her to manage her grief.\n\nShe said: 'They [fans] have always been so kind to us. It's like an extended family and having them supporting us really helped.\n\n'It's amazing what Sue Ryder does, you can get six online sessions with a professional counsellor and peer to peer support. It's amazing what they can do.\n\n'They've got such a different perspective on things. You can divulge about yourself.\n\n'Having not had therapy when my mum died compared to when my sister died, it was such a different kind of grief. I look back and think, I should have just done it the first time. It was a longer and more painful process than it was when my sister died.\n\n'I feel really good. I feel I've got to a good point with my grief and just to be able to pass that onto people really helps me with my grief.'\n\nLottie also praised big brother Louis for being 'supportive.'\n\nShe added: 'Grieving in lockdown is so hard and a lot of people are losing people at the moment. Being able to let people know about Sue Ryder's services, it's a really important time right now.\n\nAs her ambassadorial role was announced, she said: 'I want to try and help people because grief can be such a scary thing.\n\n'You need to keep talking about it otherwise you get lost in your feelings and that can send you into a really dark place.\n\n'I can't imagine how hard it's been for people grieving during lockdown and that's why I really want to spread the word about Sue Ryder's free video counselling. It is so important to keep people talking about their grief so they don't spiral.\n\n'I also want to help to guide people when it comes to supporting someone that is grieving because I think so many people don't know what to say or how to act. One of the hardest things for me was people not bringing it up, it makes it even harder because you've lost that person and it feels like they're fading away.'\n\nAs well as Louis, 28, and Lottie, Johannah was also mother to twins Daisy and Phoebe, and twins Ernest and Doris, aged just two when she passed away.\n\nShe was also grandmother to Louis' son Freddie, now four.\n\nDay after her death, Louis performed at the X Factor final as a tribute to his late mother. He performed his debut single Just Hold On – a dance floor track with DJ Steve Aoki.\n\nThe statement released to MailOnline following Johannah's death read: 'It is with immeasurable sadness that Johannah Deakin's family said goodbye to Johannah in the early hours of Wednesday 7th December 2016.\n\n'Earlier this year Johannah was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of leukaemia that required immediate and continuous treatment. We respectfully request that the family are given time and space to grieve in private.'\n\nTwo years later Félicité was found collapsed and lifeless at her fourth-floor studio apartment in Earls Court, west London.\n\nCoroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said at an inquest afterwards: 'It was a perfect storm, the OxyCodone, the alpraxolam [Xanax] and cocaine. I find no evidence this was a deliberate act to end her life.'\n\nAfter hearing she had turned to drugs following the tragic death of her mother, the coroner recorded a misadventure verdict.\n\nA tribute by her and Louis' father Mark Tomlinson was read out at Westminster Coroner's Court.\n\nHe said she 'was a much loved daughter and sister' and had from an early age 'established herself as mischievous and wonderful with children.'\n\nHe added: 'She had huge hopes and aspirations for her future, a lot of which were beginning to come to fruition at her untimely passing. She is missed by all who knew and loved her.'\n\nAt the time of Félicité's death, friends of Louis said he was left 'devastated and ­distraught'.\n\nA family source said at the time: 'Felicite was an absolutely adored young woman who was loved by Louis and her whole family. She was a loveable, caring, bright, passionate, popular and beautiful young lady.'\n\nShortly after her death, her sister Phoebe posted online: 'Words don't even begin to describe how shocked and broken hearted we all are. You were my best friend, sister, motivator and person that could make me laugh until I cried.'\n\nAnother sister, Daisy, added: 'It was only a few weeks ago that we were sat on the sofa bed at 3am drinking tea, eating French fries and chatting about the future. You told me about all your plans. We were excited.\n\n'I pushed you away when you tried cuddling me, I thought I would have so many more chances to do that. I would cuddle you a million times over if you were still here, with me. Protecting me from this cruel world.'\n\nFor confidential support in the UK 24 hours a day 365 days a year, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org"
