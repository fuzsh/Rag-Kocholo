Not sure how that happened but will make a correction. Also from last week, it should be noted that on June 6th, 1944, Toledoans, like all Americans, were keeping close tabs on the Allied D-day invasion at Normandy. Newspaper extra editions were printed. Special church services were held in the city to pray for Toledo's soldiers, and a special D-day ceremony was held at the Naval station at Bay View Park."
