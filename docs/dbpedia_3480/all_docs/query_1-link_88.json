        "text": "Fifty-one people attended the Stein-Stine Reunion held on Sunday, July 21, 2024, at the Centennial Building at the St.Elmo Community Park. Personalized nametags with the family lineage and the generation born in America helped everyone make connections. Adam Sr and Anna Stein had 19 children with eleven of those having descendants. Present were 4 from John’s family, 23 from Adam Jr’s family, 11 from Peter’s family, and 11 from Wm Monroe’s Family.\n\nOn display around the room were old photos, family tree, various years of plat maps of Wheatland Township (with shading to indicate Stein-Stine ownership), an 1876 appraisal of Adam Sr’s property, and a summary of early Reunions.\n\nOFFICERS: After prayer, all enjoyed the delicious potluck meal and visiting. The same slates of officers were retained: Chuck Bosomworth as President, Eric Bosomworth as Vice-President, and Diane Stein Price as Sec-Treas.\n\nHISTORY: Two sets of questions compiled led interesting discussions about our ancestors. The most common day for early reunions was Thursday, followed by a few years of Saturday’s and then generally on Sundays for many years but they have been held on every day of the week. No one was able to recall what the “different reasons” were for no reunion in 1969. The largest attendance (150) was in 1931, but attendance was over 100 for the first 15 reunions!\n\nNAME PRONUNCIATION: Nathaniel Williams shared his sparked interest in this family history after meeting someone from Germany on vacation.
