        "text": "PERRY Justice.\n\nIn June, 1935, the appellants, Francis Todd and Mildred Skeeters, formerly the Francis and Mildred Williams named in the writing sued on, brought this action in the Hardin circuit court, seeking to recover the possession of certain personal property, or its value of $425, held by the appellee, Lottie Williams, as the administratrix of the estate of T. L. Williams, and damages of $100 for its wrongful detention.\n\nIn the action they based their right to recover upon the following writing, executed by their grandfather, J. T. Williams, to them on November 1, 1928:\n\nFurther in their petition they alleged that the maker of the instrument, J. T. Williams, had died on December 17, 1929; that they had each remained with and cared for him until the time of his death, as per the agreement recited in the writing, which they and each of them accepted in full upon its delivery to them by J. T. Williams and had performed same. Further, they incorporated therein a list of the articles of personal property which they alleged were left by him upon his death, which they claimed to own as grantees thereunder, and which they charged the defendant was withholding, claiming same as belonging to the estate of her deceased husband, T. L. Williams, as the adverse holder and owner thereof at the time of J. T. Williams' death and for several years prior thereto.\n\nWhile it appears that this instrument contained no direction that it be recorded, it was yet, in fact, duly put to record.\n\nFor convenience, we will hereinafter refer to the parties as plaintiffs and defendant, their positions being the same here as they appeared in the lower court.\n\nFollowing pleadings made up the issue, when the cause was submitted for judgment upon defendant's demurrer to the reply, which was, by consent of the parties, carried back to the petition.\n\nThe demurrer challenged the sufficiency of the petition to state or constitute a cause of action, in that (1) the instrument therein relied on and made the basis of the action, as being a present conveyance, was not of such character, but testamentary in nature, and, not having been probated as such, was of no effect; (2) that there was no delivery made to grantees of the property it purported to convey them; and (3) that even if the instrument were not of testamentary character, there was no allegation in the petition that the grantor owned the property at the time the writing was executed which he attempted to convey.\n\nThe court, after hearing argument of counsel and duly considering same, adjudged that \"the writing filed with the petition was of testamentary character and not of the character of a deed and bill of sale\" and upon such ground sustained the demurrer to the petition, to which ruling plaintiffs excepted, and declining to plead further, their petition was dismissed.\n\nComplaining of this ruling, the plaintiffs have appealed, presenting for our review but the one question of whether or not the court committed a reversible error in thus sustaining the demurrer to their petition.\n\nIn support of such assigned error, they argue that the writing set out supra was both in its form and legal effect a deed, operative to vest a present irrevocable interest in grantees in the property, and should be so construed. On the other hand, the appellee's contention is that the trial court properly construed the writing as being testamentary in its nature and therefore not effective to operate as a gift inter vivos or as vesting in grantees a present interest therein, and, in that the instrument was not authenticated as a will nor had been probated as such, the court properly sustained the demurrer.\n\nTurning now our attention to the consideration of these conflicting contentions, it is first to be noted that the paper before us is one authenticated as a deed and not as a will, and therefore could not be probated as a testamentary paper. The question then arises as to whether or not the instrument, while in form and terms a deed, was, as such, intended by the maker to operate and be effective as vesting in grantees a present interest in the property purported to be conveyed or to thereby make a conveyance which was intended only to take effect at his death.\n\nWhile such a construction of an instrument as will deprive it of any effect is not to be adopted if it can be reasonably avoided, the object of all rules of construction is yet to arrive at the intention of the maker of the instrument. In ascertaining this, all parts of the instrument should be considered together, and where a deed, in case of doubt \"it must be resolved against the grantor, for he selects his own language.\"\n\nWhile both parties concede that such is the primary rule governing the construction of written instruments, the appellants contend that the instrument in question does yet, when so interpreted, manifest an intention on the part of the grantor to vest a present, irrevocable interest in the grantees, effective when the instrument was executed, even though by its terms the grantees' enjoyment of the property was deferred or made subject to the grantor's temporary use and possession of the property so conveyed for the period of his life."
