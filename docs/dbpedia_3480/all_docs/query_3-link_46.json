        "text": "Lottie Mae Allen Perry was born on July 7, 1933 in Wilson, North Carolina. She lived a full life until she passed away, peacefully, on June 8, 2022; after a long battle with Alzheimer’s Disease. She was 88. Lottie was the daughter of the late Willie & Roberta Allen. She grew up in Bailey, North Carolina working on the family farm and was educated through the North Carolina school system. Growing up in a Christian home, she attended the Saint Mary’s Disciples of Christ Church where she was baptized at a young age. She met and married her husband, Whalen Perry, while in North Carolina on December 27, 1948. As they grew their family, they decided to relocate to New York where Lottie furthered her education and grew a love for the game of baseball. Hence, she became an avid New York Mets fan and liked the Yankees. Lottie Mae also enjoyed listening to music. She loved to hear her son, Donnie, sing, “Just My Imagination” and loved hearing Elvis Presley’s “The Wonders of You.” As a young woman, Lottie Mae worked hard and was promoted several times throughout her career in Food services at Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. She retired from Coney Island Hospital in May of 1988 after 37 years of service then moved to Richmond, VA. Her fresh start in Richmond, Virginia led to her rededicating her life back to Christ. As a result of her renewed life, she served in the Ushers and Nurses ministries. Through her 88 years on God’s earth, Lottie Mae was a very private person and took great pride in providing for her children. Therefore, she would often say, “I can show you better than I can tell you.” Upon moving to Richmond, VA, she also took a part-time job at Burger King Corporation until she was no longer able to work. She retired from Burger King after 21 years of service. After laboring for 58 years, Lottie Mae enjoyed her remaining years watching the news, court tv, westerns, and taking frequent trips to the store. She loved keeping her family up-to-date on the news and politics. Nothing would get by her because she had the inside scoop. As she declined in health, she relocated to Gordonsville, VA where she was cared for by family and was frequently visited by all that loved her dearly. She was surrounded by family and close friends when she passed away. Overall, she did her best to exemplify the love of God. Although she wasn’t a person to give lots of hugs, she gave what love she had. Thus, she leaves behind a beautiful legacy and her presence as our family matriarch will be missed. We are all better people because of her example. She was affectionately known as Ma, My Mommy, Baby Girl, Nana, Nunu, Grandma, Grandma Lottie and Lulu. She was preceded in death by her husband, Whalen Perry; son, Donnie Perry; daughter, Gwendolyn Perry Harris; Grandmother, Lottie Spain; older sister, Everta Allen Williams; younger sister, Willistine Allen Brown; six grandchildren, which includes one devoted granddaughter, Lakeesha Renee George; one great grandchild; and a special companion, George F. Pryor. Lottie Mae leaves to cherish in her memory two daughters, Carolyn George of Richmond, VA and Wendy (Christopher) Cooper of Gordonsville, VA; three sons, Dannie (Rhonda) Perry of Richmond, VA, Al (Kim) Perry of Pittsburg, PA, and Larry (Tracie) Perry of Richmond, VA; 32 grandchildren, 63 great-grandchildren, 6 great-great-grandchildren; two sisters, whom she loved dearly, Ethel Allen Battle of Wilson, NC and Peacola Allen Thompson of Brooklyn, NY; 7 nieces, 5 nephews; a host of remaining family members, and one special friend Carolyn Rankins of Charlottesville, VA. A very special thanks goes to her granddaughter, affectionately named in her honor, Elizabeth Lottie, for making a sacrifice in taking exceptional care of her during her final months of life."
