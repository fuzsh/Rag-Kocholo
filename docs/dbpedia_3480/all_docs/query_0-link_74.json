[Fuller, Alfred S.] Taylor County Democrat Thursday January 10, 1895 [p. 1] Killed in a Collision. Sunday a message was received by Mrs. Millie [Mellie] Fuller (nee Klopp), which brought the heartrending intelligence that her husband, Alfred S. Fuller, had been killed in a railroad wreck at White Haven, Pa., at 3 o'clock a. m. on Saturday, Jan. 5th. Briefly, the details of the wreck in which Mr. Fuller lost his life are as follows: He was in charge of a car load of chickens for Rowley & Co. of Maryville, Mo., the car of chickens having been shipped from Nebraska. The freight train on which Mr. Fuller and a stockman in charge of a carload of sheep were riding stopped at While Haven, Pa., to do some switching. The trainmen left the caboose, a carload of sheep and one of dressed beef standing on the main track. While Haven is situated at the fool of a steep mountain grade about three miles long on the Lehigh railroad. A second section of the train on which Fuller and the stockman were riding came down this three mile incline at a terrific speed (the trainmen on this train having lost control of their train on account of the air brakes being out of repair) and crashed into the caboose and cars that were standing on the main track, killing the two occupants of the way car instantly and without warning, they being asleep. The body of Mr. Fuller was shipped to this city for burial. An examination of the remains disclosed the extent of the dead man's injuries to be a blow given with such force as to crush in the skull on the back part of the head. The funeral services were held at the First Baptist church at 2:00 p. m. yesterday and were conducted by Rev. J. C. Lewis. A large concourse of people were present, and the heart of every person present beat in tenderest sympathy for the widowed young bride of but three weeks.
