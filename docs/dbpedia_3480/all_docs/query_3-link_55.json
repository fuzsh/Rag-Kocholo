        "text": "Who the fuck is Lottie Matthews?\n\nThat’s the question audiences have been mulling over since the first-season finale of Yellowjackets, the time-jumping, sometimes spooky story of a New Jersey girls high school soccer team that survives a plane crash. It was revealed in the first season’s final moments that Lottie, whose high school iteration is played by Courtney Eaton, is still alive. It was gasp-worthy to learn that not only had another Yellowjacket made it out (and skipped the class reunion, how dare), but this one in particular had: Lottie was revealed late in the season to be the Antler Queen, having visions and leading the team in invented rituals, including hunting Travis, one of their dead coach’s sons, and declaring, “The stag! We have to catch it!”\n\nNow, 25 years after the crash of Flight 2525 in the show’s timeline, Lottie is back. Simone Kessell, a New Zealand–born actor, was announced as adult Lottie in August, but has kept mum on what Lottie has been up to—until now.\n\n“She’s come into her life,” Kessell tells Vanity Fair in a preview of the show’s second season, whose premiere streams for Showtime subscribers on March 24 and airs on March 26. “She’s found her voice, and she’s used it in a way to help teach—she sort of brings therapy to people.... She has reinvented herself from the darkness into the light. She leads a group of broken toys. The past 25 years she’s reinvented herself as a leader, as a guru, as a healer. And with that, she has created her own world.”\n\nWhich sounds…kind of like a cult. “You could call it a cult,” Kessell admits. “The wording of it—her community, her intentional community, her compound, her spiritual-healing community—it really is open to interpretation.”\n\nKessell’s adult Lottie swathes herself in ethereal silks in sunny hues and drips with jewelry, a look that Kessell says she developed with the show’s costume team as a way to show Lottie attempting to “mute the darkness.”\n\nBut she also describes Lottie as a force of light who wants to help her fellow survivors—who, she explains, think she’s still institutionalized in Switzerland, where, she says, Lottie was sent for treatment after the yet-to-be-seen escape from the wreck. But as with the adult Yellowjackets we met in the first season, the past is always threatening to catch up with her. “There’s a dark force that is within them,” Kessell says. “It’s something that is within them all.”\n\nThough she can’t reveal whether Lottie reunites with her teammates in New Jersey, or if they catch up with her wherever in the world she is, Kessell says that the players are irreversibly bonded.\n\n“These women are a sisterhood, and they may love and they may hate each other deeply, but they would kill for each other—and, as we’ve seen in the first season, bury the bodies,” she says.\n\nSpeaking of bodies, there are some of those too: Amid speculation about what’s real and what’s not on the show, Kessell confirms, “The cannibalism is real. And the cannibalism is survival of the young women.”\n\nThe secrets run as deep as the bonds in the former classmates. While Lottie donned her antlers as Doomcoming queen in the season finale, decades later, the power may have shifted: “Even now, honestly, hand on heart, I don’t know where Lottie is—or the others even—in regard to who is really the Antler Queen.”\n\nNot to mention the question of how much a person can really change: “How long can you wear that mask?” she asks of Lottie. “How long can you deny those antlers? How long can you pretend that that wasn’t real?”\n\nOne thing is for sure: The cast of Yellowjackets is just as invested in the mysteries of the show as audiences are, getting together every time they receive new script pages to theorize and discuss. Kessell says she met up regularly with Melanie Lynskey, Christina Ricci, Juliette Lewis, Tawny Cypress, and fellow cast newcomer Lauren Ambrose to feverishly unpack the show’s twists and turns.\n\n“We sit down, and we drink wine, and we all catch up, and we go, ‘Okay, what happened?’” Kessell says with a laugh. “We’re just a bunch of women in our 40s going, ‘Hold on, what happened with that?’ There’s six of us, and when we get together, we can’t draw breath. No one’s listening. Everyone’s just talking.”"
