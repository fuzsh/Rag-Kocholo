        "text": "Chapter 1: Intrigue\n\nWilliam Cavendish was a man in the prime of his life. Forty-seven years of age, a premier peer, a wealthy peer, and a man with a great number of connections throughout the three kingdoms. He knew what he wanted, and how he wanted it. He feared for the Kingdoms though, there was something about the Stuarts that just suggested they did not understand how the world worked. That they wished to rule as the continentals did, and that was something he simply could not abide. He knew there were others of the country party who supported him, Shaftesbury, though not as great as his father was one such man. Then there was the man sat in front of him.\n\nCharles Talbot the Earl of Shrewsbury, descending from a family as old if not older than William’s own, the man had been a Catholic until his conversion to the true faith in 1679, and now he had fallen out with the King. William welcomed him, even if others did not. It was good to have someone on your side who knew who that blasted man thought. William took a sip of his wine and then spoke. “You know, my lord, that things are reaching a turning point. The King has continued down the path of foolishness, by naming Jeffreys son to the position within the Treasury’s office, he has made it clear he intends to raise despotic idiots to power. I have it on good authority that Churchill has been seen discussing things with Danby.” That was a hot piece of news, Danby was still out of favour with the court, and Churchill was the King’s favourite soldier.\n\n“That does not excuse the latest pamphlets coming out of the press, Cavendish.” Talbot replied with the same sort of sneer that a man who had been part of nobility for centuries carried. “After all, the King is known for his eccentricities, but nothing has come of it. He can appoint all the Catholics he wants, he does not have a son. And as long as Her Highness The Princess Mary is alive, she is his heir. Not Her Royal Highness Princess Anne.”\n\nWilliam sighed, sometimes Talbot could be remarkably dense, though what else could one expect from someone such as he. “Charles, you do not understand. The King is being pressed by his daughter, Her Royal Highness, to give the styling of such a title to all members of the Royal Family. The woman is trying to bring such foreign customs into our kingdom, and you wish to tell me that there is nothing wrong with that?” such a thought horrified William, it was a simple enough thing to get annoyed about, but still. “Furthermore, Her Highness the Princess Mary has no children, she and His Highness the Prince of Orange have had no children despite being married for almost eight years. Her Royal Highness Princess Anne has three children including a boy, who she has named after her father.”\n\nTalbot clearly did not see what the problem was, for he replied. “And? Cavendish, I feel you are making much ado about nothing. The Princess’s father was present during the birth, he is her father. What else what she going to name him? William? Do not be ridiculous, you know as well as I do, that the Princess and the Prince of Orange despise one another. The succession cannot be bypassed, and even if Princess Mary has no children, by the time her father dies and she dies, Princess Anne might well be dead, and her son will be alive. The King is not such a fool to think he can control the religious upbringing of his daughter’s heir.”\n\nWilliam took another sip of wine and put the glass down. “I know that the King has been looking at all sorts of tutors for his grandson, including some from the Popish sort. He wishes for the child to garner all sorts of beliefs that stray from the true church. I also know that he has already begun looking for brides for the two granddaughters he has from Her Royal Highness. The eldest seems to be in line to marry the grandson of King Louis of France.” Talbot made a suspicious move then but William chose to ignore it. “I know that His Highness the Prince of Orange is willing to make a move should we encourage it. He worries that King Louis is looking to make a grab for the Spanish Netherlands. And as such worries that our King would support the French. He needs our support.”\n\nTalbot looked deeply concerned then. “What do you suggest?” the thought of France and England allied together was deeply concerning, especially with the King’s wife being so young still.\n\n“We must ensure the King cannot sire a child, and that the regiments are prepared.” William said.\n\nTalbot said nothing for a moment, he looked deep in thought, then he responded. “I shall see what I can do.”\n\nWilliam nodded, relieved. Perhaps things were not as bad as he had feared.\n\n--------------\n\nThe following is set in February, 1687, a few weeks after the birth of James of Cumberland, the only son of Princess Anne and her husband."
