        "text": "The Succession Crisis of Queen Anne\n\nIntroduction\n\nAnne was born in the reign of her uncle Charles II, who had no legitimate children – though it wasn’t for want of trying. Her father, the brother of Charles II and later to become James II, was first in line to the throne. His suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England, and on Charles II’s instructions Anne was raised as an Anglican. Her father openly converted to Catholicism in 1675 and the scene was set for a massive political problem when he became king.\n\nThree years after he succeeded Charles, James was deposed in the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688.\n\nAnne’s Dutch Protestant brother-in-law and cousin William III became joint monarch with his wife, Mary II\n\nMary II was Anne’s elder sister\n\nWilliam III and Mary II had no children\n\nWhen Mary died of smallpox in 1694, William continued to reign alone.\n\nAnne became his heir apparent, since any children he might have by another wife were assigned to a lower place in the line of succession, and the two reconciled publicly\n\nHe restored her previous honours\n\nHe allowed her to reside in St James’s Palace, and gave her Mary’s jewels\n\nHe excluded her from government and refrained from appointing her regent during his absences abroad\n\nWilliam III was succeeded by Anne upon his death in 1702.\n\nWhen Queen Anne of Great Britain died in 1714, she was the last monarch of the House of Stuart which had succeeded the House of Tudor with the death of Elizabeth I in 1603.\n\nAnne was plagued by ill health throughout her life.\n\nFrom her thirties onwards, she grew increasingly lame and obese.\n\nDespite seventeen pregnancies by her husband, Prince George of Denmark, she died without any surviving children and was the last monarch of the House of Stuart.\n\nIn early 1687, within a matter of days, Anne miscarried, her husband caught smallpox, and their two young daughters died of the same infection\n\nAll of Anne’s children died before age 12\n\nThis resulted in a succession crisis\n\nThe solution to this crisis was an Act of Parliament to ‘designate’ a Protestant successor\n\nChild Birth Death Notes Stillborn daughter 12 May 1684 in London Mary 2 June 1685, Palace of Whitehall 8 February 1687, Windsor Castle Christened 2 June 1685 by the Bishop of London; styled “the Lady Mary”. Died of smallpox. Mary, Anne Sophia (Mary’s younger sister), and their father all becoming ill at Windsor Castle in early 1687 Anne Sophia 12 May 1686 at Windsor Castle 2 February 1687 at Windsor Castle or Whitehall Christened by the Bishop of Durham, with Lady Churchill one of the godmothers; styled “the Lady Anne Sophia”. Miscarriage 21 January 1687 Stillborn son 22 October 1687, Whitehall Anne gave birth at seven months, but the baby “lay dead a full month within her” Miscarriage 16 April 1688 Prince William, Duke of Gloucester 24 July 1689, Hampton Court Palace 30 July 1700, Windsor Castle Mary 14 October 1690, St James’s Palace She was two months premature, and lived about two hours George 17 April 1692, Syon House He lived a few minutes, just long enough to be baptised; styled “Lord George” Stillborn daughter 23 March 1693, Berkeley House Miscarriage 21 January 1694 Modern historians Edward Gregg and Alison Weir do not agree on whether it was a son or possibly a daughter. Contemporary chronicler Narcissus Luttrell wrote only that Anne “miscarried of a dead child” Miscarried daughter 17 or 18 February 1696 Miscarriage 20 September 1696 Luttrell said Anne “miscarried of a son”. Dr Nathaniel Johnson told Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon, in a letter dated 24 October 1696, “Her Royal Highness miscarried of two children, the one of seven months’ growth, the other of two or three months, as her physicians and midwife judged: one was born the day after the other.” If so, the smaller foetus was probably a blighted twin or fetus papyraceus. Miscarriage 25 March 1697 Miscarriage early December 1697 According to Saunière de L’Hermitage, the Dutch resident in London, Anne miscarried twins who were “too early to determine their sex”. Other sources say the pregnancy ended in a stillborn son, or “two male children, at least as far as could be recognised” Stillborn son 15 September 1698, Windsor Castle James Vernon wrote to Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury, that Anne’s physician thought the foetus “might have been dead 8 or 10 days” Stillborn son 24 January 1700, St James’s Contemporary sources say Anne gave birth at seven and a half months, after the foetus had been dead for a month\n\nPrince William, Duke of Gloucester\n\nPrince William, Duke of Gloucester (24 July 1689 – 30 July 1700), was the son of Princess Anne, later Queen of England, Ireland and Scotland from 1702, and her husband, Prince George, Duke of Cumberland.\n\nHe was their only child to survive infancy.\n\nStyled Duke of Gloucester, he was viewed by contemporaries as a Protestant champion because his birth seemed to cement the Protestant succession established in the “Glorious Revolution” that had deposed his Catholic grandfather James II the previous year.\n\nGloucester’s mother was estranged from her brother-in-law and cousin, William III, and her sister, Mary II, but supported links between them and her son. He grew close to his uncle William, who created him a Knight of the Garter, and his aunt Mary, who frequently sent him presents.\n\nGloucester’s precarious health was a constant source of worry to his mother.\n\nHis death, in 1700 at the age of eleven, precipitated a succession crisis as his mother was the only individual remaining in the Protestant line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689.\n\nThe ‘Tory-led’ English Parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic\n\nThe Irish Parliament was filled with recently converted Anglicans and Whigs (liberals) and this was a concern\n\nThe Tories had recently lost control of the Irish Parliament and could not rely on its support\n\nThe Church of Ireland was in turmoil – fearing a Presbyterian take-over in Ulster\n\nThey also feared the climate of ‘free-thinking’ and the rise of non-conformist Protestant sects in Ireland\n\nThey were also very concerned that the vast majority of Irish Catholics, although militarily and politically defeated, remained loyal to the ‘old religion’ and dreamt of a Jacobite invasion, consequently leading to a return to power of the Catholic peers and bishops.\n\nThe Act of Settlement, 1701\n\nThe Act of Settlement, drawn up in 1701, settled the succession on Sophia of the Palatinate, Electress of Hanover, and the heirs of her body, barring any Roman Catholics or spouses of Roman Catholics from the succession.\n\nThis was a deliberate attempt to disinherit Anne’s nearest blood relation, the exiled Roman Catholic James Stuart (who would later be known as the ‘Old Pretender’), her half-brother, from inheriting the throne.\n\nThe Act of Settlement changed the course of British history and led to the Jacobite Revolt.\n\nAt the time of Anne’s death in August 1714, 68 descendants of the Stuart dynasty were alive\n\nThe first 55, being Roman Catholic, were excluded by the Act of Settlement\n\nThe succession thus fell to George Ludwig, Elector of Hanover, the eldest son of Electress Sophia (who had died a few months before), to the British throne\n\nIn total, the Act of Settlement listed the 68 potential claimants and barred 55 of them\n\nLine of succession\n\nTo show how each person’s claim was derived, their ancestors back to King James I (and VI of Scotland) – the first to occupy both thrones – are listed, without numbers.
