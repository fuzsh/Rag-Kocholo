        "text": "The publication of Geoffrey Holmes's British Politics in the Age of Anne, arguably, did more than any other volume of the period to reinvigorate interest in the house of lords in the Augustan period. The upper chamber, which had been largely overlooked by historians such as Sir Lewis Namier and Robert Walcott, had come to be regarded as a very inferior partner to the house of commons, populated by great landowners whose principal interest was to see the furtherance of their kinship networks. Holmes's work demonstrated clearly the central role of the Lords in British political life and revised radically the accepted orthodoxy that family predominated over ideology in the early 18th century. This article seeks to reassess Holmes's contribution to the study of the Lords in the light of research undertaken since the publication of British Politics and to suggest some ways in which Holmes's model, which remains broadly unassailable, might be reshaped.\n\nWhile it might be too much to suggest that alcohol was the life-blood of Restoration and Augustan parliamentary society, it seems fair enough to suggest that it was a significant element that helped sway opinion, was a source of much needed tax-raising potential and, of course, helped keep members well-lubricated during lengthy sessions. One need only perform a cursory search on British History Online to see that this is so. A search for the term “beer’ limited to Parliament and to the 17th century results in 751 hits, for the 18th century 233 hits; a similar search on “ale” results in 690 hits for the 17th century and 212 for the 18th; while “wine” in the 17th century produces 1,472 hits and for the 18th (a rather modest) 268: in all, then, 3,626 mentions – and these comprising just three varieties of alcohol. It may be a blunt instrument, but as an indicator of the time given over by Parliament to matters related to beers and wines it is at least suggestive that this was a topic that kept many a parliamentarian busy during the period.\n\nThis article examines Tory principles in the eighteenth century by focusing on that party's arguments in the debates about the frequency of elections in 1716, when the duration of parliaments in Britain was extended from three to seven years. The Septennial Act (1716) was an epochal event and a crucial stage in the fortification of the Hanoverian regime and the supremacy of the Whigs in the eighteenth century. When protesting against this Act in the Lords and Commons, Tories resorted to arguments about the ancient constitution and fundamental law -- ideas which have more often been associated with Whiggism. In addition to its historical significance, the episode serves as a case study demonstrating the importance of studying the history of political thought together with political history.\n\nIt is usually taken for granted that intelligence organisations provide information for decision-making and that the knowledge produced in the process is therefore deeply utilitarian. Drawing on organisational sociology, this article draws on a case study of English intelligence efforts during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) to reflect critically on the assumed direct relationship between intelligence-gathering and political decisionmaking. In eighteenth-century England, intelligence frequently fulfilled other, often more symbolic functions, for example when access to intelligence was employed to legitimise individual actors. In this sense, intelligence was doubtlessly useful, albeit in other ways than generally postulated by intelligence theory. These observations strongly suggest a 'missing dimension' in the history of intelligence in other periods as well as intelligence theory more generally.\n\nThis article looks at auditing and corruption in the early eighteenth century, and argues that effective audit was not the product of more 'bureaucratic' administrative structures, as most historians have suggested, but of the relative political standing of auditors versus their opponents. This has profound implications for studies of corruption and auditing during the eighteenth century and its continuities with earlier practices, and for understanding the decisive changes that occured during the nineteenth century."
