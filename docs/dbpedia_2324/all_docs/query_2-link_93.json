        "text": "Yes, when I was a child Grandpa and I compared our teeth and talked about it. I am not quite sure of his number but he had the small gap between his front teeth and pointed eye teeth and small piece of skin between the front teeth. Your father had odd teeth. I think if you think about it you will remember. Maybe if you have the teeth you notice. I have the teeth and I went to S.A. and low and behold my grandfather had my teeth. I noticed. I was a teen-age girl and one notices such a thing. He told me it bothered him when he was young but later people could see that they were his own.\n\nMy mother had the irregular small size and crooked teeth if you remember her as a young person, and she had it fixed as an adult. This is found with this gene mutation. There is quite of bit of variation in how it is expressed, not everybody missing teeth. Often people don't think, why do I have a space between my front teeth? What causes this? If you have fewer teeth in your jaw they all have more room. There are a few studies on congenital missing teeth and they know quite a bit about the gene now. This being one variation among many. Not everybody having 32 teeth and not all people having the gene less than 32.\n\nObviously statistically only half of the offspring would get it in any generation and then it would depend on how it is expressed and mutates. Also once it is out of a line it would be gone. I am no longer a Talbot I just have my grandfather's teeth. It will cluster in related people.\n\nOften it would just be a gap between your front teeth, overly pointed teeth or slightly funny crooked teeth or small irregular teeth or the person may fail to get all their wisdom or molar teeth. I am missing laterals (I have 26 teeth and it just looks like I have a gap between my front teeth). I think in some there are odd shaped skinny laterals. You get your baby teeth but you don't get the permanent teeth. It has to do with the permanent teeth not hardening and erupting. Often the first teeth just stay in place so you may think your tooth is just a bit small and does not have a proper root. With modern dentistry people just have their teeth made perfect. It seems that in some this gene may affect joints in the toe and finger and I think it is linked to soft fingernails.\n\nFunny teeth seem quite common in English families. My mother seemed to think quite a few of the Talbot family in S.A. had funny teeth and that was the side from which Grandpa and her got their teeth. He was born I believe in 1907. So we would have just a couple of generations to the first John Talbot son of John Stuart Talbot both arriving in 1820 to S.A.\n\nIt could have been one of the mothers but I found other Talbot forum lines in England that mentioned this mutation and they had the same expression as I did missing laterals and lower permanent molars and some wisdom teeth. As it is a rare mutation I tend to think it probably is an expression of some of the Talbot ancestors.\n\nNow I think the dead princes in the Tower had congenital missing molars. Odd to note it was blamed on their being possibly related to a distant Talbot. This is back quite a long time so not sure about the relationship between the gene my mother and I inherited. Not sure how they would have been related to George III. Keeping track of the ill-begotten children of the Royal family could be a difficult task. Not sure the current one is going to pass the crown so it probably does not matter too much.\n\nAt least I'm quite sure we are related and that we are the offspring of those two John Talbots who fell for the scheme in 1820, and now we are scattered around the globe.\n\nYou must be my Uncle John. I have not talked to you since the 1980s. I have four sons now, and I just had my first grandson. So the genes live on.\n\nDrop me a line as I would love to hear from any of my family.\n\nEmail address removed for security reasons.

He arrived on the Brilliant and was on shore to meet his wife and six children when they arrived in the evening aboard the Aurora. John Stuart Talbot, aged 47, claimed to be the rightful Earl of Shrewsbury. But why was King George IV, who acceded to the throne of England on 25th January 1820, seeking his life?\n\nHe had been warned by a friend, William Dundas, to get out of England as quickly as possible, as the king was seeking his life. Being impoverished, the only way he could do it was to register as an 1820 settler. He paid the deposit and succeeded in becoming a member of Sephton's party. His eldest son, John, 17 years old at the time, also paid the deposit and was entitled to an additional allotment. The party was given a settlement at Salem, 19 miles from Grahamstown. John Stuart and his son John, were each awarded an allotment astride the Assegai Bush River.\n\nWhat is the truth about his claim to being the rightful Earl of Shrewsbury? And why was King George IV seeking his life? The mystery surrounding this man has been the subject of 70 years of research by his descendants. There are now more than 120 researchers contributing to the extensive information on The John Stuart Talbot Research Website.\n\nHere is a brief account of what they have found.\n\nThe 14th Earl of Shrewsbury, George Talbot, had three brothers. In order of age these were Thomas, James and Francis. A beautiful young lady, Margaret Sheldon, fell in love with Thomas and became his mistress. She bore him a son whom they named Charles. Subsequently, Margaret Sheldon was introduced to the king, George III, and she became a singer and entertainer in his court. Then she became his mistress and fell pregnant by him. He sent her to Cornwall to have the child, whom they named George. The king gave Thomas Talbot a commission and sent him away to war. Margaret was told that Thomas was killed in battle. The king told Francis that \"the boy George\" was the son of his older brother Thomas, and he forced Francis to marry Margaret and to care for the boy. He gave Francis lands and money in payment for this service. He also gave lands and money in trust for \"the boy George.\"\n\nFrancis, believing that George was the son of his older brother, Thomas, realized that he would have birthright over his own sons. In 1796 he took steps, in the Winchester High Court, to make sure that George would not inherit the title. In 1793, in the Hanover Square Court, he succeeded in having all lands, titles and bonds transferred from George to himself. It is recorded that the king agreed with \"troubled heart.\"\n\nMargaret Sheldon died when George was very young. Francis remarried a woman much younger than himself. His stepmother did not like George and was unkind to him. With the help of an uncle she had him put in the navy at the age of 14. He did not like the navy and deserted several times. For this he was flogged and sent back to the navy. He served in the Royal Navy for a number of years, taking part in the Battle of the Nile, the Battle of Trafalgar, an action off Cadiz, and the Battle of Copenhagen. A captain under whom he served said of him, \"He is a lion and with him alone I could win ten battles.\"\n\nIn 1791, in the Hanover Square Court, he changed his name to John Stuart Talbot, in honor of an uncle, John Talbot, and his wife whose maiden name was Jane Stuart. This couple had been kind to him.\n\nJohn Stuart Talbot married Priscilla Loveridge in 1802. He had six children by her, three boys and three girls. Having been deprived of his inheritance, He worked for a time as a shoemaker in Pimlico, London, where he lived. Later he became a coal merchant and a corn merchant, working in the coal exchange and the corn exchange in Pimlico.\n\nIn January 1820 King George III died and his son, George IV, acceded to the throne. The latter discovered, presumably from the royal archives, that John Stuart Talbot was his older half-brother. Fearing that John Stuart Talbot had a better claim to the throne than he, he ordered two of his secret agents to locate him and do away with him. A friend of John Stuart's, William Dundas, was privy to this knowledge. He warned John Stuart that the king was seeking his life and told him to get out of England as quickly as possible. He sailed with his family from Gravesend, on Feb 15th 1820 aboard the Aurora. He gave his occupation as \"master mariner.\" On the way he interfered with the navigation of the ship and the captain had him put in irons. At Cape Town he was put ashore and prevented from coming back on board the Aurora. The Aurora had sailed from Gravesend in the company of another ship, the Brilliant. John Stuart went aboard the Brilliant, which arrived at Algoa Bay on the morning of the 15th May 1820. The Aurora arrived in the evening and John Stuart was there to meet his family as they disembarked.\n\nJohn Stuart's youngest son Henry met up with some Mormon missionaries and became converted to the Mormon religion. He then emigrated with his wife and children to the United States. There he married a second wife who bore him sixteen children. Consequently, John Stuart Talbot has many descendants in the United States. It is mainly these descendants who have solved the mystery of his origin.\n\nI, John Henry Talbot, born in 1931, and living in Johannesburg, South Africa, am the fifth in line of direct descent from John Stuart Talbot. Some of the researchers believe that I am the rightful king of England. Good luck to them!"
