        "text": "The Gunpowder plot was planned at a meeting at Huddington Hall in September 1605. The meeting was attended by Robert Catesby, the leader, Robert Wintour and his brothers, James and John, as well as several other members of leading Midland families. Catesby was cousin to the Wintours and Robert Wintour was the son-in-law of John Talbot. There is no evidence that John knew of the plot, but it is a fact that that on Sunday 3rd of November Robert Wintour and a group of conspirators spent the day at Grafton.\n\nThe following morning John Talbot accompanied them as they set off horseback for Dunchurch. John Talbot was on his way to his other estate at Pepperhill near Albrighton.\n\nOn the Wednesday evening, a horseman brought news to him there that the plot had failed, that his son-in-law had been denounced as a traitor and that Robert was a fugitive from the law. A posse composed of Sheriffs of Worcestershire and Warwickshire were in pursuit of the conspirators.\n\nRobert was captured along with the others and executed. John went back to Grafton with a heavy heart. His daughter was now a widow, and the Plot would taint the family name.\n\nThe Plot did indeed bring suspicion to the family and Sir Richard Walsh, High Sheriff of Worcestershire was ordered to make a thorough search of Grafton to see if any incriminating documents could be found. Grafton was stripped of its furniture and the family arms, and it took John three years to get them released, at that time everything was sold and John was given the money, so to some extent his honour was restored.\n\nJohn died five years after the Gunpowder Plot and Grafton passed to his son George."
