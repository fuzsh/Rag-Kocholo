        "text": "Husband: Roger +* of MONTGOMERY (1022-1093) Wife: Adelaide of PUISET (c. 1030- ) Children: Everard of MONTGOMERY (c. 1050- )\n\nHusband: Roger +* of MONTGOMERY\n\nWife: Adelaide of PUISET\n\nName: Adelaide of PUISET Sex: Female Father: - Mother: - Birth 1030 (est)\n\nChild 1: Everard of MONTGOMERY\n\nName: Everard of MONTGOMERY Sex: Male Birth 1050 (est)\n\nNote on Husband: Roger +* of MONTGOMERY\n\nRoger de Montgomerie (died 1094), also known as Roger the Great de Montgomery, was the first Earl of Shrewsbury. His father was also Roger de Montgomerie, and was a relative, probably a grandnephew, of the Duchess Gunnor, wife of Duke Richard I of Normandy. The elder Roger had large holdings in central Normandy, chiefly in the valley of the Dives, which the younger Roger inherited\n\nRoger was one of William the Conqueror's principal counsellors. He did not fight in the initial invasion of England in 1066, instead staying behind to help govern Normandy [Some controversy here- Neil Ludlow (Pembroke Castle) states the Earl led the Norman right flank at the Battle of Hastings].[citation needed] Afterwards he was entrusted with land in two places critical for the defense of England, receiving the rape of Arundel at the end of 1067 (or in early 1068), and in November 1071 he was created Earl of Shrewsbury; a few historians believe that while he received the Shropshire territories in 1071 he was not created Earl until a few years later.\n\nRoger was thus one of the half dozen greatest magnates in England during William the Conqueror's reign. William gave Earl Roger nearly all of what is now the county of West Sussex, which at the time of the Domesday Survey was the Rape of Arundel.[1] The Rape of Arundel was eventually split into two rapes, one continuing with the name Rape of Arundel and the other became the Rape of Chichester.[1] Besides the 83 manors, in Sussex, his possessions also included seven-eighths of Shropshire which was associated with the earldom of Shrewsbury, he had estates in Surrey (4 manors), Hampshire (9 manors), Wiltshire (3 manors), Middlesex (8 manors), Gloucestershire (1 manor), Worcestershire (2 manors), Cambridgeshire (8 manors), Warwickshire (11 manors) and Staffordshire (30 manors).[2] The income from Rogerâs estates would amount to about Â£2000 per year, in 1086 the landed wealth for England was around Â£72,000, so it would have represented almost 3% of the nationâs GDP.[3]\n\nAfter William I's death in 1087, Roger joined with other rebels to overthrow the newly crowned King William II in the Rebellion of 1088. However, William was able to convince Roger to abandon the rebellion and side with him. This worked out favourably for Roger, as the rebels were beaten and lost their land holdings in England.\n\nRoger first married Mabel of BellÃªme, who was heiress to a large territory on both sides of the border between Normandy and Maine. The medieval chronicler Orderic Vitalis paints a picture of Mabel of BellÃªme being a scheming and cruel woman.[4] She was murdered by Hugh Bunel and his brothers, who in December 1077? rode into her castle of Bures-sur-Dive and cut off her head as she lay in bed.[4][5] Their motive for the murder being that Mabel had deprived them of their paternal inheritance.[6] Roger and Mabel had 10 children:\n\nRoger then married Adelaide de Le Puiset, by whom he had one son, Everard, who entered the Church.\n\nAfter his death, Roger's estates were divided. The eldest surviving son, Robert, received the bulk of the Norman estates (as well as his mother's estates); the next son, Hugh, received the bulk of the English estates and the Earldom of Shrewsbury. After Hugh's death the elder son Robert inherited the earldom.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nRoger de Montgomery - was born in 1022, lived in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England and died on 27 Jul 1094 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England . He was the son of Roger de Montgomery and Josceline de Ponteaudemer. Roger married Mabel Talvas de Alencon in 1048 while living in Perche, France. Mabel was born about 1026, lived in Alencon, Eure, France. She was the daughter of William Talvas de Alencon II and Helie de Bourgogne. She died on 2 Dec 1079 in Bures Castle . Roger - Earl of Arundel & S The symbol of advance into Wales was the castle which Earl Roger built at Montgomery, a typical motte and bailey, of which the earthworks still survive. To distinguish it from the later stone castle built at Montgomery by Hubert de Burgh, it came to be known as Hen Domen Castle- the old mound. It was a key point in the natural communication into mid-Wales, and beyond that westwards to Ceredigion. The gains which Earl Roger and his commanders made were compact and, with the exception of Arwystli, did not drive deeply into Wales, but they extended over a long stretch of the frontier. # 'Oft on the mouldering Keep by night # Earl Roger takes his stand, # With the sword that shone at Hastings' fight, # Firm grasped in his red, right hand ! ' This is how an ancient poem begins about Roger de Montgomery who it was believed had fought alongside Duke William at Hastings. In fact Roger de Montgomery wasn't at the Battle of Hastings, but was left at home to look after Normandy for William while he was in England. He contributed greatly to the invasion force and was to be richly rewarded for his loyal services. Earl Roger de Montgomery founded the Arundel Castle on Christmas Day 1067. It was after King William had held his Christmas Court at Gloucester and awarded Montgomery the Earldom, that he ordered him to build a castle on the Arun to protect the inland reaches. Roger de Montgomery was already an extremely powerful man in his native Normandy and had been a close friend of William's since William was a teenager as he was his cousin. He was present at the Council of Lillebonne in 1066, and agreed to contribute 60 ships to aid the invasion plans of England. He returned with William from Normandy in 1067 and he was summoned to attend Chrismas at Gloucester with the king where he was awarded his honours as one of William's most trusted men. Earl Roger was succeeded at Arundel by his son, Robert, known as Robert de Belleme. John Fitzalan of Clun, who had married Hugh de Albini's daughter Isobel, acquired the Castle and Honour of Arundel. The Fitzalan's were to hold the castle in an almost uninterrupted line until 1555 when Mary Fitzalan, last of the family, married Thomas, 4th Duke of Norfolk, thereby carrying Arundel into the Howard family where it remains to this day. http://www.renderplus.com/hartgen/htm/montgomery.htm#name3738\n\nAdded by MelissaCampbell1967\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEarl of Shrewsbury is a hereditary title of nobility created twice in the peerage of England.\n\nThe first creation occurred in 1074 for Roger de Montgomerie, one of William the Conqueror's principal counselors. He was one of the Marcher Lords, with the Earl of Hereford and the Earl of Chester, a bulwark against the Welsh; he was granted great powers, and his territory, which extended from Shropshire into Mid-Wales (the county of Montgomeryshire being named for him), was outside the ordinary administration; he was also granted lands across England.\n\nRoger was succeeded in 1094 by his younger son Hugh, his elder son Robert of BellÃªme succeeding to his lands in Normandy. On Hughâs death in 1098 the earldom passed to his brother Robert.\n\nThe title was forfeit in 1102 after the 3rd Earl, Robert, rebelled against Henry I and joined Robert Curthose's invasion of England in 1101.\n\nThese earls were sometimes styled Earl of Shropshire.\n\nThe title was created for a second time in 1442 when John Talbot, 7th Baron Talbot, an English general in the Hundred Years' War, was made Earl of Shrewsbury in the Peerage of England. He was also made hereditary Lord High Steward of Ireland and, in 1446, Earl of Waterford in the Peerage of Ireland (thus, the two titles have always descended together). John Talbot, the first Earl, was succeeded by his son John, the second Earl, who had already succeeded as seventh Baron Furnivall on his mother's death in 1433. Lord Shrewsbury served as both Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Lord High Treasurer of England. He was killed at the Battle of Northampton in 1460 during the Wars of the Roses.\n\nHis grandson, the fourth Earl, was Lord Steward of the Household between 1509 and 1538. His son, the fifth Earl, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as Lord Talbot in 1533, five years before he succeeded his father. On his death the titles passed to his son, the sixth Earl. He was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as Lord Talbot in 1553. Lord Shrewsbury was entrusted with the custody of Mary, Queen of Scots, and also served as Earl Marshal from 1572 to 1590. He married as his second wife the famous Bess of Hardwick.\n\nShrewsbury was succeeded by his son from his first marriage to Lady Gertrude Manners, the seventh Earl. He represented Derbyshire in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire. He had no sons and on his death in 1616 the baronies of Talbot, Strange of Blackmere and Furnivall fell into abeyance between his three daughters. He was succeeded in the earldoms by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He was Member of Parliament for Northumberland. He did not have a male heir either and was succeeded by his distant relative, the ninth Earl. He was the great-great-grandson of Sir Gilbert Talbot (d. 1518), third son of the second Earl of Shrewsbury. The family bought Barlow Woodseats Hall in 1593 as part of the estate.\n\nHe was succeeded by his nephew, George, the tenth Earl and Lord of Grafton. He was the son of John Talbot of Grafton. On his death the titles passed to his son, the eleventh Earl. He was killed in a duel with George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. His son, the twelfth Earl, was a prominent statesman. He was one of the Immortal Seven who in 1688 invited William of Orange to invade England and depose his father-in-law James II and later served under William and Mary as Secretary of State for the Southern Department and Secretary of State for the Northern Department. In 1694 he was created Marquess of Alton and Duke of Shrewsbury in the Peerage of England. The Duke was childless and on his death in 1718 the marquessate and dukedom became extinct.\n\nHe was succeeded in his other titles by his first cousin, the thirteenth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Gilbert Talbot, second son of the tenth Earl. Lord Shrewsbury was in the Holy Orders of the Church of Rome. On his death the titles passed to his nephew George, the fourteenth Earl (who was the son of the Hon. George Talbot). He was childless and was succeeded by his nephew Charles, the fifteenth Earl (who was the son of Charles Talbot). He began in 1812 the creation of the extensive gardens at Alveton Lodge, Staffordshire (later renamed Alton Towers) which estate had been in the family since the 15th century. When he died the titles were inherited by his nephew John, the sixteenth Earl who was the son of the Hon. John Joseph Talbot. When in 1831 the principal home of the family at Heythrop, Oxfordshire was destroyed by fire he moved the family seat to Alton Towers. He was succeeded by Bertram, his second cousin once removed, the seventeenth Earl who was the great-grandson of the Hon. George Talbot, younger son of the aforementioned Gilbert Talbot (d. 1711), second son of the tenth Earl.\n\nBertram died unmarried at an early age in 1856. By his will he left his estates to Lord Edmund Howard (later Talbot), son of the Duke of Norfolk, but the will was contested by three distant relatives and after a long and expensive legal case the House of Lords ruled in 1860 in favour of Henry John Chetwynd-Talbot, 3rd Earl Talbot, who thus became the eighteenth Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford. He was a descendant of the aforementioned the Hon. Sir Gilbert Talbot (d. 1518), third son of the second Earl of Shrewsbury (see the Earl Talbot for earlier history of this branch of the family). He also held the titles of Baron Talbot, of Hensol in the County of Glamorgan, and Viscount of Ingestre, of Ingestre Hall in the County of Stafford. Lord Shrewsbury was an Admiral in the Royal Navy and also served in the second Conservative administration of the Earl of Derby as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (chief whip in the House of Lords) from 1858 to 1859.\n\nHis eldest son, the nineteenth Earl, also served as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, an office he held from 1874 to 1877 under Benjamin Disraeli. He was succeeded by his son, the twentieth Earl. He caused a scandal in Victorian England by eloping with a married woman, Ellen Miller-Mundy. They were later married. On his death the titles passed to his grandson, the twenty-first Earl. He was the son of Charles John Alton Chetwynd-Talbot, Viscount Ingestre. As of 2010 the peerages are held by the twenty-first Earl's eldest son, the twenty-second Earl, who succeeded in 1980. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits on the Conservative benches. He is also hereditary Lord High Steward of Ireland and as the holder of this office is allowed to bear a white staff at the Coronation of the British Monarch.\n\nLord Shrewsbury is the senior Earl on the Roll in the Peerage of England (the more senior earldom of Arundel being held by the Duke of Norfolk). The earldom of Waterford is sometimes called the \"Premier Earldom of Ireland on the Roll\", as the oldest Irish earldom, that of Kildare, has been a subsidiary title of the Duke of Leinster for centuries and the Earl held the oldest Irish earldom held by anyone ranked as an Earl. If the Viscount Mountgarret proves his presumed claim to the 1328 earldom of Ormonde, the Earls of Shrewsbury would lose this distinction, but they derive higher precedence from their English earldom in any event. Despite holding three differently named earldoms Lord Shrewsbury is always styled simply \"The Earl of Shrewsbury\".\n\nThe seat of the Earls of Shrewsbury was once Alton Towers until it was sold to The Tussauds Group, now Merlin Entertainments. Their seat is now at Wanfield Hall in Staffordshire.\n\nThree other members of the Talbot family may also be mentioned. The Hon. John Talbot, son of the first Earl of Shrewsbury by his second wife Margaret Beauchamp, was created Viscount Lisle in 1451. Admiral the Hon. Walter Carpenter (who assumed the surname of Carpenter in lieu of his patronymic Chetwynd-Talbot), second son of the eighteenth Earl, was a naval commander and Member of Parliament. Major-General the Hon. Sir Reginald Talbot, third son of the eighteenth Earl, was a soldier, politician and colonial governor.\n\nProperties owned by the Earls of Shrewsbury:\n\nAlveston Hall hunting lodge\n\nAlton Towers, built on the site of Alveston Hall in 1811-14 as the family seat; sold 1924\n\nBarlow Woodseats Hall bought 1593; sold mid 1600s\n\nGrafton Manor, seat of John Talbot of Graftonâs son George before inheriting the title; sold in 1934\n\nHeythrop Park, developed as the family seat in 1700â1705; burnt down in 1831 and sold in 1870\n\nIngestre Hall, inherited by marriage to the Chetwynd family in 1748; sold to Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council in 1960\n\nWanfield Hall, the current family seat\n\nEarls of Shrewsbury, First Creation (1074):\n\nRoger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury (d. 1094)\n\nHugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury (d. 1098)\n\nRobert of BellÃªme, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury (1052â1113) (forfeit 1102)\n\nEarls of Shrewsbury, Second Creation (1442):\n\nJohn Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, 1st Earl of Waterford, 10th Baron Strange of Blackmere (1390â1453)\n\nJohn Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, 2nd Earl of Waterford (1413â1460)\n\nJohn Talbot, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, 3rd Earl of Waterford (1448â1473)\n\nGeorge Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, 4th Earl of Waterford (1468â1538)\n\nFrancis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury, 5th Earl of Waterford (1500â1560)\n\nGeorge Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, 6th Earl of Waterford (1528â1590)\n\nGilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury, 7th Earl of Waterford (1552â1616)\n\nEdward Talbot, 8th Earl of Shrewsbury, 8th Earl of Waterford (1561â1617)\n\nGeorge Talbot, 9th Earl of Shrewsbury, 9th Earl of Waterford (1567â1630)\n\nJohn Talbot, 10th Earl of Shrewsbury, 10th Earl of Waterford (1601â1654)\n\nFrancis Talbot, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury, 11th Earl of Waterford (1623â1667)\n\nCharles Talbot, 12th Earl of Shrewsbury, 12th Earl of Waterford (1660â1718) (created Duke of Shrewsbury in 1694)\n\nDukes of Shrewsbury (1694):\n\nCharles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury, 12th Earl of Shrewsbury, 12th Earl of Waterford (1660â1718)\n\nEarls of Shrewsbury, Second Creation (1442; Reverted):\n\nGilbert Talbot, 13th Earl of Shrewsbury, 13th Earl of Waterford (1673â1743)\n\nGeorge Talbot, 14th Earl of Shrewsbury, 14th Earl of Waterford (1719â1787)\n\nCharles Talbot, 15th Earl of Shrewsbury, 15th Earl of Waterford (1753â1827)\n\nJohn Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury, 16th Earl of Waterford (1791â1852)\n\nBertram Arthur Talbot, 17th Earl of Shrewsbury, 17th Earl of Waterford (1832â1856)\n\nHenry John Chetwynd-Talbot, 18th Earl of Shrewsbury, 18th Earl of Waterford, 3rd Earl Talbot (1803â1868)\n\nCharles John Chetwynd-Talbot, 19th Earl of Shrewsbury, 19th Earl of Waterford, 4th Earl Talbot (1830â1877)\n\nCharles Henry John Chetwynd-Talbot, 20th Earl of Shrewsbury, 20th Earl of Waterford, 5th Earl Talbot (1860â1921)\n\nCharles John Alton Chetwynd-Talbot, Viscount Ingestre (1882â1915)\n\nJohn George Charles Henry Alton Alexander Chetwynd-Talbot, 21st Earl of Shrewsbury, 21st Earl of Waterford, 6th Earl Talbot (1914â1980)\n\nCharles Henry John Benedict Crofton Chetwynd Chetwynd-Talbot, 22nd Earl of Shrewsbury, 22nd Earl of Waterford, 7th Earl Talbot (b. 1952)\n\nThe heir apparent is the present holder's son James Richard Charles John Chetwynd-Talbot, Viscount Ingestre (b. 1978).\n\nSources"
