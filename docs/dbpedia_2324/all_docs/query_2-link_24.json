        "text": "IN COMMITTEE FOR PRIVILEGES. the earl, op watbbpord's claim. Sept. 1, 6, 1831. Feb. 17, March 9, 1832. [Mews' Dig. x. 315, 317; S.C. 3 St. Tr. N.S. 1261. Cited in Wipes' Claim of Peerage, 1869, L.R. 4 H.L. HI.] A dignity or title of honour cannot be taken away (where there is no deficiency or corrupt-ion of blood) except by express words in an Act- of Parliament: Held, therefore, that the Irish Act, 28 Henry 8, c. 3, vesting in the King, in right- of the Crown of England, all honours, manors, castles, signiories, jurisdictions, and all other possessions and hereditaments held by certain persons, or by any person to the use of any of them in Ireland, did not take away from a-ny of them a- personal dignity; and that the opinion of Lord Coke and other Judges, that it took away the Earldom of Waterford (12 Rep.), was erroneous in fact and in law. The House of Lords is now the only satisfactory tribunal to determine questions on claims to dignities, on reference from the Crown : accordingly, a que-stioii of law having arisen on a petition of an Irish Peer, presented to- the House- of Lords, claiming to1 be admitted to vote at the election of Irish representative peers, the House, with a, view to a more solemn adjudication, recommended a petition claiming the peerage to be presented to- the Crown, in order that it might be referred by the Crown to the House, with the report of the law officers of the Crown annexed, and then [134] the House, acting on the report of its Committee of Privileges, would adjudicate the right, and report, the same to the Crown. An adjudication in that form by the Irish House of Lords is an authority as binding on the House of Lords of the United Kingdom, as a like determination by the latter House, or by the English or British House of Lords: before the Unions, in matters of English or British peerage. But a- resolution of either House, affirming a report of its Committee, and recognising a right or privilege of peerage, is not equivalent, to a-n adjudication upon a reference from the Crown. John, Earl of Shrewsbury in England, and Earl of Waterford in Ireland, presented his petition to' the House of Lords in December 1830, setting forth that his ancestor the first. Earl of Shrewsbury, by the name of John, Earl of Shrewsbury and Wexford, 648 waterford's (earl of) claim [1831, 1832] vi clark & finnelly. Lord Talbot, Furnival, and Strange, was created by King Henry the Sixth, by patent, dated in the 24th year of his reign, Earl of Waterford of the then land and dominion of Ireland, with remainder to the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten; and the said King by another patent, dated in the 26th year of his reign, granted to the said Earl the Earldom of Waterford in Ireland, with like remainder: that the said John, Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, was slain at the battle of Chastillion, in 1453, and was succeeded by his eldest son and heir, John, second Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, who was slain at the battle of Northampton in 1460, and was succeeded by hisi eldest son and heir, John, third Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford. The petition then stated the descent of the said dignities from father to son down to the year 1616, when Gilbert, seventh Earl, died without issue male, [135] and was succeeded by his brother Edward, eight Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, who died in 1617, and was succeeded in the said dignities by his cousin, George Talbot, who was the lineal descendant, from Sir Gilbert Talbot, the third son of John, the second Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford. The said George, ninth Earl, died, unmarried, in the year 1630, and was succeeded by his nephew, John, tenth Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, eldest son of John Talbot, Esq. of Longford, only brother of George, the ninth Earl. John, the tenth Earl, died in 1653, and was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Francis, the eleventh Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, who1 was introduced and took his seat as Earl of Waterford in the House of Peers of Ireland, by proxy, in 1661. He died in 1667, and was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Charles, the twelfth Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, who was created Duke of Shrewsbury in 1694, and, dying without issue in 1718, was succeeded by his cousin George, thirteenth Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, eldest surviving son of Gilbert Talbot, brother to Francis, the eleventh Earl. George, thirteenth Earl, died in 1733, and was succeeded by his eldest son, George, fourteenth Earl of Shrewsbury and Wateirford, who died without issue in 1787, and was succeeded by his nephew Charles Talbot, the fifteenth Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, who'.died without issue in April 1827, and was succeeded by his nephew John Talbot, the petitioner, sixteenth Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford. The petition further stated that, the petitioner's ancestors, as Earls, of Shrewsbury, having been successively and respectively peers of Parliament of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom; and that Earldom having been granted to the petitioner's ancestor, [136] John, the first Earl, with the same remainder as the Earldom of Waterford, (viz. to the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten,) and the petitioner having also taken his seat in this House as heir male of the body of John, first Earl of Shrewsbury; the pedigree, therefore, of the petitioner had been allowed by their Lordships, and in virtue thereof the petitioner, as heir male of the body of the said John, first Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, claimed, as Earl of Waterford, the right to vote at the elections of representative temporal peers of Ireland to sit in the Parliament of the United Kingdom; and he prayed that his right so to vote may be admitted and recognized by their Lordships. The petition was referred by the Lords to their Committee for Privileges, to consider and report thereon. The Committee met on the 1st and 6th of September 1831, when Mr. Lynch appeared as counsel for the petitioner. The Attorney-general (Sir Thomas Denman), and the Solicitor-general for Ireland (Mr. Crampton), attended for the Crown. Mr. Lynch:-As the claimant has already taken his seat in this House, as Earl of Shrewsbury and heir male of the body of Sir John Talbot, on whom that dignity was conferred in 1442 by letters patent, with the same limitation to the heirs male of his body that was contained in the patents granting to him the Earldom of Water-ford, it would be a waste of time to go1 into1 proofs of the pedigree, which, however, had been laid before the House, and would be established if necessary. There were no Journals of the Irish House of Peers in existence of a date prior to the year 1634. The [137] first mention of the Earl of Waterford, found in those Journals subsequent to that date was in 1661, when the proxy of Francis, the eleventh Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford, was allowed as Earl of Waterford. It appeared, that on the 14th of May 1661, the Irish Ho'use of Lords \" ordered it to be referred to the Committee of Privileges, to consider whether the peers of this kingdom, having their residence in England, and no estates here, may be allowed to send their proxies unto the Parliament of this kingdom; and that the said Committee have inspection H.L. vii. 649 21a VI CLARK & FINNELLY. WATERFORD's (EARL of) CLAIM [1831, 1832] into the Journals of former Parliaments, and report to this House what precedents or orders they find.\" etc. On the llth of June, the Committee reported that \" their opinion is that the Lords of England, who are peers of Ireland and have no estate in Ireland, shall have liberty to send their proxies to this Parliament.\" Then \" it is ordered by the House that the proxies of absent peers of Ireland shall be allowed, notwithstanding that they have no land in this kingdom.\" On the 10th of July 1661, the proxy of the Earl of Waterford and Wexford, assigned to the Earl of Clan-ricarde, was read and allowed, and it was \" ordered that wherever the Earl of Water-ford, now to be introduced, shall be placed, there shall be a saving unto the right of place of all peers concerned.\" It was not surprising that the Irish peers, never having seen the Earl of Waterford among them, should be jealous of his precedence; but notwithstanding that jealousy, they not only acknowledged him a,s Earl of Waterford but allowed him to vote by proxy. It further appeared from the same Journals that the twelfth Earl of Shrewsbury was called over as Earl of Waterford in 1692 and again in 1698, as one of the absent peers, and he was excused on both occasions. This Earl was created Duke of Shrewsbury in 1694, and [138] in the patent of creation he was styled Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford. Since the time of his death all the Earls of Shrewsbury and Waterford had been Roman Catholics, and as they could not sit in Parliament the Journals were silent about them. Under these circumstances, it might at once be submitted to their Lordships that the claimant has made out his right; but the claimant's advisers being desirous to put their Lordships in possession of all the facts of his case, inserted in the statement presented to the House, an opinion given by Lord Coke and two other Judges, in the year 1612, that the Irish Act of Parliament, called \" The Act of Absentees \" (28 H. 8, cap. 3), took away this dignity. The first observation that occurred on that opinion was, that it was extra-judicial; that those Judges were not the proper tribunal; that the House' of Lords, under the direction of the Crown, was the only proper tribunal to' determine a question of peerage. This opinion, therefore, of the three Judges could be regarded only as advice to the Crown which the Crown might reject or adopt, and the advice was in fact rejected by King Charles the Second, when..."
