        "text": "1897 July 2, Friday, one of the major social events of the \"season\" of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee\n\nThe invitations were for 10:30 p.m., but people began to arrive about 10:00, and the Duke of Devonshire came down to greet the Prince and Princess of Wales at 11:00 p.m.\n\nThe invitations asked people to dress as monarchs and their courts from the past or as goddesses or figures from antiquity.\n\nWeather: According to the Times, it was 63 degrees at midnight in London, just as the ball was getting underway, with a dew point of 58, which means that it would not have been as oppressive in all those leather, velvet and satin costumes as well as metal armor as it could have been.[1]\n\nLocation: The party was at Devonshire House, in Picadilly, hosted by Louisa Cavendish, the Duchess, and Spencer Compton Cavendish, the 8th Duke of Devonshire.\n\nThe people who attended this party belonged to the most elite circles of society and were in the social networks of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales and Louise Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire. The people in these networks were not the same as the people in, for example, Queen Victoria's networks. The social network of the Prince of Wales did not exclude people who were divorced, involved in extra-marital relationships, or associated with scandal or gossip. It also included Jews, Americans, businessmen and the nouveau riche, and actors and actresses, even if they were not particularly wealthy, so long as they were beautiful, witty and able to keep the prince amused. In their day, they were celebrities, the subjects of newspaper reports and were considered stylish, \"fast,\" and social leaders. Many of these people would not be familiar now to many of us. The ones that we might find familiar include the following:\n\nAlbert Edward, Prince of Wales later King Edward VII, and Alexandra, Princess of Wales, later Queen Alexandra.\n\nGeorge of Wales, Duke of York and Duchess of York, Princess (Victoria Mary) May or Mary of Teck, later King George V and Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth II's grandparents. (For fans of the tv series The Crown, the role of Queen Mary was played by Eileen Atkins.)\n\nFrederick Arthur Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, who commissioned the first Stanley Cup and presented it to Canda.[2] The entire Stanley family was engaged with hockey when Frederick Arthur Stanley was Governor General of Canada (1888 to 1893).[3] The horse-racing derbies also are named for the Earls of Derby.\n\nLady Frances, Countess of Warwick, called Daisy, the person for whom Henry Dacre's 1892 song \"Bicycle Built for Two\" was written.[4]\n\nOscar Wilde dedicated A Woman of No Importance to Gwladys Robinson, Lady de Grey.\n\nWinston Churchill, who was at the ball by virtue of his mother's popularity in these social networks; he was 24 in 1897 and so little known that only the Gentlewoman reported his attendance.\n\nA number of Rothschilds were present: Lady (Emma Louise von Rothschild) and Lord Rothschild (Nathan Mayer de Rothschild), Baron F. de Rothschild, Mr. and Mrs. L. Rothschild (possibly Leopold and Marie Perugia Rothschild), Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, Alfred Rothschild (?), Cyril Flower, Lord Battersea, and Constance de Rothschild Flower, Lady Battersea. Louisa, Lady de Rothschild also attended.\n\nPrince Charles (or Carl) of Denmark was married to Princess Maud of Wales, the daughter of the Albert Edward, Prince and Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales. He became King Haakon VII of Norway, and Princess Maud of Wales became Queen of Norway. The role of the old King Haakon VII in the tv series Atlantic Crossing was played by Søren Pilmark.\n\nSome people will recognize the name Joe Cresswell, known for being the commanding officer for a destroyer that captured an intact Enigma machine; his father, Addison Baker-Cresswell, was at the ball.\n\nWilliam St. John Freemantle Brodrick, later Viscount Midleton, related by marriage to Agatha Whitehead von Trapp,[5] first wife of Georg von Trapp and thus the mother of the 7 children in the von Trapp singers. (Agatha Whitehead von Trapp died of scarlet fever in 1922, and Georg von Trapp remarried in 1927 Maria August Kutschera, former novice of Nonnberg Abbey.[6]) Some controversy exists about the accuracy of this genealogy.\n\nWhile few of us would recognize the name Henri Louis Bischoffsheim, we might recognize the bank he founded: Deutsche Bank.\n\nAlfred Beit was a Life Governor of De Beers and friend of Cecil Rhodes.\n\nMichael Arthur Bass, 1st Baron Burton of Burton-on-Trent and of Rangemore and Chairman of Bass Brewery, which was founded in 1777 by Michael Arthur Bass's ancestor William Bass. According to the Wikipedia article on the Bass Brewery, by 1887 Bass was the largest brewery in the world.[7]\n\nEdward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh and Chairman of Guiness Brewery, which was founded in 1759 by Edward Guiness's ancestor Arthur Guiness.\n\nA number of people were present not as people invited to the ball but as staff.\n\nThe people who were in attendance on the Royals are not technically staff as we would normally think of it, as they were aristocrats or the children of people with titles, perhaps named as attendant or perhaps as a member of the \"household.\" They were staff at the same time because they were paid employees, although most would not likely accept that description. Not all the Royals at the ball are described in the newspapers as having been accompanied by attendants — the courtiers who usually attended them — but it seems likely that they all would have been. Some of these attendants are described in the newspapers, perhaps those who were invited in their own right.\n\nSome were staff and servants working in Devonshire House or for the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire at one of his other properties. These people would have helped prepare for the ball, would have served dinner and cleaned up after people, or would have been responsible for the flowers and decorations, like the gardening staff at the Duke of Devonshire's manorial estate, Chatsworth House, who brought flowers from there for decorations at the ball.\n\nDevonshire staff who are named and likely contributed to the 1897 ball included\n\nMr. J. P. Cockerell, agent for the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire\n\nMr. W. S. Lawrence, house steward for the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire\n\nMr. Chester, head gardener at Chatsworth House\n\nMr. May, gardener for the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire\n\nSome people at the ball, like the photographer Lafayette and the people who worked at that firm or the musicians, for example, served as staff of the party itself.\n\nThe gardens at Chatsworth House provided the greens and flowers for the ball. Chatworth House was (and still is) known for its gardens; the conservatory was designed by Joseph Paxton (1803–1865), who constructed several glass houses, including the Great Conservatory (demolished after World War I), which were the basis of his design for the Crystal Palace.[8]\n\nAccording to House Style: Five Centuries of Fashion at Chatsworth,\n\nFlowers arrived early on the day of the party, and by the afternoon each room was a mass of orchids and exotic plants from Paxton's great conservatory at Chatsworth. The large marble tazza in the hall was filled with water lilies, and there was even a Night Flowering cactus, a tropical plant whose flowers bloom at night and last a few hours before dying by morning. ...\n\nOn each table [in the supper marquee] were palm fronds after the fashion set by the Savoy Hotel the previous year, and hidden in these fronds and the flower arrangements around the marquee were tiny electric lights which gave a glittering, fairy-like appearance to the room. This was a novelty in 1897, and the Duchess was taking a risk, as in these early days of electricity, hostesses who chose this form of lighting were apt to find their parties plunged into darkness without warning. Fortunately, at this event all was well.[9]:137\n\nAccording to the Belfast News-letter,\n\nThe elaborate floral decorations were all carried out under the direction of Mr. Chester, the head gardener of Chatsworth, and the whole of the lovely flowers and palms were sent up from the conservatories and gardens on the estate.[10]:p. 5, Col. 9a\n\nDescribing a later social event in which the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, as Mayor and Mayoress, decorated Devonshire House again, the Sussex Agricultural Express refers to some of the men who worked for the Duke and Duchess in January 1898, about half a year later: \"Mr. J. P. Cockerell, the Duke of Devonshire's indefatigable agent called to his aid a willing and competent staff from Compton Place [in Eastbourne], including Mr. W. S. Lawrence, the house steward, and Mr. May, the gardener.\"[11]\n\nThe staff of Devonshire House was in costume. According to House Style: Five Centuries of Fashion at Chatsworth, some of the staff who worked the ball were hired from the \"outside,\" and some were already staff at Devonshire House:\n\nThen there was the mammoth task of organising costumes for the staff, as the Duchess had decided that they should all be in fancy dress. Those hired from outside were to wear Elizabethan and Egyptian costumes from a theatrical outfitter and, for the Devonshire House staff, the men were to be dressed in the blue and buff Devonshire livery of the eighteenth century and the maids in Elizabethan sprigged frocks.[12]:137\n\nThat is, the male staff, \"if not wearing the full liveries of the House of Cavendish, were in black knee-breeches with white wigs.\"[13]:7, Col. 4b The livery of the House of Cavendish for the \"late nineteenth/early twentieth centuries\" was \"beautiful yellow and black uniforms\" worn with a tricorn hat.[14] [Brenda] (The footmen who worked for the Duke of Devonshire were generally tall, as were at least some of the \"female servants employed by the Cavendish family during the early twentieth\" century.[14])\n\nThose who served supper did not wear livery: \"The waiters moving about among the supper-folk were dressed as our great-grandfathers in the time of Pitt were dressed — the hair bunched in a black bag, black courtiers' coats, knee-breeches, stockings, and buckle shoes.\"[15]:p. 5, Col. 2a (The \"time of Pitt\" probably refers to William Pitt the Younger, the Tory rival of Whig Charles Fox, a relation of Georgiana Cavendish, 5th Duchess of Devonshire.[16])\n\nAlso, the \"Masters of Ceremonies in Louise [sic] Seize military uniforms passed the guests through into inner rooms.\"[15]:p. 5, Col. 2c [17]:p. 32, Col. 2a (Louis XVI reigned 1774–1792, with Marie Antoinette.[18] William Cavendish (1764–1811) was the 5th Duke of Devonshire, and the last Duchess of Devonshire before Louise was Georgiana Cavendish, the 5th Duke's wife.[19])\n\nLady Violet Greville, who wrote the article on the ball in the Graphic, says, \"even the servants, in their own quaint and barbaric Eastern dress, carried out the illusion of antiquity to their knee breeches and white wigs.\"[20]:p. 15, Col. 1b (No evidence exists that Lady Greville was present at the ball, although her son and daughter in law were.)\n\nHired from Outside\n\nThose staff who were dressed \"in their own quaint and barbaric Eastern dress\" were hired for the occasion.\n\nThe \"Oriental\" Procession\n\nAfter people were welcomed by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, \"Masters of the Ceremonies in The article in the Gentlewoman says something very similar, although not identical: the Duchess of Devonshire's \"Masters of the Ceremonies were in Louis Seize military uniforms, and they ushered the guests through into the inner rooms, with the exception of the Oriental queens, who, with their suites, assembled in the white and gold saloon, which was brilliantly lit by hundreds of wax candles, as were, indeed, all the rooms.\"[17]:p. 32, Col. 2a\n\nJames Stack Lauder, known as Lafayette because that was the name of his firm, was invited by the Duke of Devonshire to set up a temporary studio in the garden and take portrait photographs of the guests in their costumes at the ball.\n\nWhile Lafayette is in many ways the most important photographer documenting the costumes for this event because he was present at the ball, with the imprimatur of the Duke of Devonshire, other photographers also took part in documenting this event. We see their work in the Diamond Jubilee Fancy Dress Ball album of 286 photogravure portraits made of ones taken a week later by Lafayette as well as ones made by other photographers were collected as a hostess gift for the Duchess and given to her in 1899. A copy of this album is in the National Portrait Gallery and has been digitized.[21]\n\nSome of the portraits in the Diamond Jubilee Fancy Dress Ball album are drawings or paintings rather than photographs:\n\nWilliam Dodge James as Monsieur d'Artagnan by Le Conteur: https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw158631/William-Dodge-James-as-Monsieur-dArtagnan.\n\nMarie Elizabeth Françoise Hope-Vere (née Guillemin) as Medusa by John Thomson: https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw158596/Marie-Elizabeth-Franoise-Hope-Vere-ne-Guillemin-as-Medusa.\n\nRobert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe as Philip II of Spain by Frederick Hollyer: https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw158568/Robert-Offley-Ashburton-Crewe-Milnes-1st-Marquess-of-Crewe-as-Philip-II-of-Spain.\n\nSir Seymour John Fortescue as a Venetian Lawyer, after the picture by Moroni in the National Gallery by Unknown artist: https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw158548/Sir-Seymour-John-Fortescue-as-a-Venetian-Lawyer-after-the-picture-by-Moroni-in-the-National-Gallery.\n\nHelena Violet Alice (née Fraser), Countess of Stradbroke as Delilah by Lafayette: https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw158506/Helena-Violet-Alice-ne-Fraser-Countess-of-Stradbroke-as-Delilah.\n\nClara Rook\n\nWith respect to the ball, Clara Rook worked as a fashion illustrator for The Queen, providing line drawings of 31 costumes, the wearers sketched in. The 10 July 1897 issue of the paper printed 29 line drawings with her signature \"CRook\" as part of the full-page illustration (beginning here: https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0002627/18970710/137/0039). The 17 July issue has her signature for each of the 2 drawings (https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0002627/18970717/283/0064). Her images are fashion illustrations, showing details of the costumes' design, and not portraits of the people who wore the costumes (like the photographs taken of them by Lafayette or one of the 19 other professional photographers who made portraits of some of the guests in their costumes).\n\nAmelie Küssner\n\nThe \"fashionable miniaturist\" Amelie Küssner painted the Prince of Wales in his costume.[22]\n\nH. A. Stock\n\nAccording to the Western Daily Press, H. A. Stock, a \"much-admired\" west-of-England painter, \"represented one or two of the personages taking part in the Devonshire House fancy dress ball.\"[23] At the 32nd Exhibition of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water-Colours that opened 12 March 1898, Mr. Stocks exhibited a \"portrait of a well-known society lady in the costume she wore at the Devonshire House fancy dress ball.\"[24]\n\nThe Marchioness of Granby, who at this time was Violet Manners, commissioned a bust by George Frampton.[25]\n\nAt least two ensembles were present and providing music, Lacon and Ollier's Blue Hungarian Band and, early the next morning, the White Hungarian Band. One was called an orchestra and the other a band: according to the Guernsey Star, \"The orchestra was placed in close proximity to the ballroom, and another band played a programme in the garden.\"[26]:p. 1, Col. 2c The Gentlewoman says that the Blue Hungarian Band was near the saloon where the guests at the ball presented themselves to the Royals:\n\nAbout half-past eleven the Blue Hungarian Band, which was stationed in a small ante-room, announced the Prince of Wales' arrival with the stirring strains of \"God Save the Queen,\" and His Royal Highness led the Princess up the centre of the saloon, which was lined by ladies dressed as Oriental queens and their suites.[17]:p. 32, Col. 2a\n\nThe Blue Hungarian Band advertised in the Morning Post:\n\nLacon and Ollier's Blue Hungarian Band.\n\nCymbalos, Berkes Geza and Miska.\n\nhas arrived in town for the Season. — Engagements for balls, receptions, &c., to be made to 163A, New Bond-street, W.\n\nThis band was specially engaged for the Duchess of Devonshire's ball on Friday last.[27]\n\nAccording to a letter to the editor of the Pall Mall Gazette by \"One Who Was There,\" the White Hungarian Band was present at the very end.[28]\n\nDescribing something that seems to be quite different, the Westminster Gazette says, \"A mandoline band under the sycamore trees killed time.\"[29]:p. 5, Col. 2a\n\nSome of the people who attended the ball wore costumes made by costumiers, but many of them used the dressmakers and jewelers who already knew them and their bodies. And because private theatricals were so common, they might already have been familiar with costumiers and perruquiers.\n\nGeneral, contextualizing descriptions of the costumes can be found in the Anthology.\n\nSeveral men who owned newspapers were present at the ball, but it seems very unlikely that they were invited because of their associations with journalism unless they were already part of the social network that the list of people who attended the ball can be seen to represent. Also, of course, given the class of people invited to the ball, they were not reporters but proprietors and editors. Still, their newspapers played a very important role in the reportage on the event, which makes them worth identifying separately:\n\nAlgernon Borthwick, Lord Glenesk, proprietor of the Morning Post, and son and editor Oliver Borthwick\n\nHenry Oppenheim, one of three proprietors of the Daily News in July 1897; Oppenheim was apparently the only one of the three present at the ball.\n\nWilliam Gervase Beckett, proprietor and editor in chief of the Saturday Review\n\nWhile Borthwick and Oppenheim represented newspapers that gave a great deal of attention to the ball, their presence at the ball does not suggest their newspapers necessarily took it more seriously. The newspapers that had the biggest articles about the ball the day after are the following. The main article about the ball\n\non 10 July 1897 in the Gentlewoman is 8,489 words.\n\non 3 July 1897 in the London Morning Post is 7,719 words.\n\non 3 July 1897 in the Daily Telegraph is 7,673 words.\n\non 3 July 1897 in the London Evening Standard is 7,048 words.\n\non 3 July 1897 in the London Times is 5,675 words.\n\non 5 July 1897 in the London Evening Mail is 5,365 words.\n\non 3 July 1897 in the London Daily News is 3,676 words.\n\non 3 July 1897 in the Westminster Gazette is 2,959 words.\n\nThe articles in the Gentlewoman and the Graphic (this last one written by Lady Violet Greville), both 10 July 1897, had a very large number of illustrations, which made them longer than the number of words itself would suggest.\n\nA collection of excerpts of descriptions from the newspaper and magazine reports, called here an anthology, gives a sense of what people read about the event.\n\nReporting on this event began months before it, as soon I think as rumors that it would take place began to circulate, and continued for many months after; it occasionally shows up in a newspaper report years later.\n\nMost social events of this size that included the Prince and Princess of Wales, especially those hosted by them, were reported in the newspapers with a list of people invited, generally in order by rank. Royals, including royals from countries outside the U.K., were listed first, often as special guests. The ranks of the aristocracy followed, with dukes together, marquises, earls, and so on. Sometimes the toponyms were in alphabetical order; occasionally they were just grouped; I never saw a list that followed the orders of precedence beyond the general groupings by title. If members of a family were present and had a title, they were in the lists by their title with their family members listed with them.\n\nNo newspaper printed a complete list of those invited to this ball, probably because the Duchess of Devonshire did not release such a list to the newspapers. This list, then, is the result of trawling through every contemporary account of the ball. It is possible, perhaps, to confirm the presence of some people, because, for example, they appear in the Album of portraits given as a thank-you gift to the Duchess in 1899. The fact that more than one newspaper mentions someone's presence may mean not confirmation but the fact that one or both of these newspaper were reprinting articles originally published somewhere else.\n\nThe random quality to the list below, then, arises from the newspapers themselves. Further, the location of the names on the list depends on which newspaper article I was working from at the time. I began with the London Morning News because of its audience and reputation for gossip and social news for the aristocracy and oligarchy. Almost all other lists of attendees are made up only of what was published in the Times, which is a good list but not the best (because of its repetitions) and nowhere near complete.\n\nHusbands and wives are often not listed together in the newspaper reports on the ball, and sometimes, as with the Times, the same people are listed in several places with different titles and honorifics.\n\nAlso influential in developing the list of attendees and identifying some who were mentioned in newspapers but without enough identifying information was the Album, which included the photographs of some of the attendees in their costumes, a copy of which is in the National Portrait Gallery, London, and another in the British Library.\n\nA list of people whom it would seem likely would have been at the ball but are not mentioned in the press are below, in the section People Absent.\n\nThe people who were invited and attended this ball were members of the aristocracy, the oligarchy and the government and some members of their families, but not all members of these groups were part of the social networks that make up the attendance list of the ball.\n\nA number of untitled or only-recently titled people attended the ball, mostly wealthy plutocrats or oligarchs, or, to use Gladstone's term, the \"neo-plutoi.\"[30]:qtd. in, p. 223\n\nNot middle-class notions of respectability\n\nCostumes\n\nResetting jewelry\n\nAccess to people who could produce the costumes, accessories and whatever they did with their hair\n\nMissing from this list are the dignitaries from India, who were said to have been present. According to the Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 2 July 1897, the day of the party, \"The Duchess [of Devonshire] has secured the attendance of many of the Indian Rajahs, who have merely to present themselves in the gorgeous dresses with which they have decorated London drawing-rooms during the past fortnight. ... — London Correspondent.\"[31] In a letter to the Editor of the Pall Mall Gazette on 6 July 1897, \"One Who Was There\" is lamenting about how, now that the ball was over, people would not see the beautiful costumes again. Unlike most of the people who attended, however, \"The Indian princes were happy in their lot — no hired possessions theirs, but treasure trove, and they could play at dressing up whenever they pleased.\"[32] Describing wearing Indian late-19th-century native dress as \"play[ing] at dressing up\" reveals perhaps that part of the attraction of inviting these people, who were likely in London for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, were their colorful and exotic clothing.\n\nWe know that \"the Maharajah of Kapurthala\" was present (at 195 in the list below) and at Table 10 in the first supper seating.\n\nNo other newspapers stories talked about the presence of many Indian Rajahs, but perhaps the reporters didn't see them arrive or depart and didn't know who they were. These dignitaries are likely to have been in London to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee; perhaps their names can be guessed from those named at other events from about this time.\n\nDuleep Singh (at 605) was not a dignitary from India: he was living in London at this time.\n\nOn 6 July 1897, Tuesday, just 4 days after the fancy-dress ball, the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire hosted a garden party that was attended by a number of people from South Asia, who were named in the Morning Post article about the garden party. Although Duleep Singh himself is not mentioned, his English wife, Princess Sophia Duleep Singh, Countess of Selkirk, was present and mentioned just after this:\n\nThe company arrived in quick succession from four till nearly seven o'clock by the two side entrances to the grounds, as well as the principal entrance in Piccadilly, and the presence of our Indian and Colonial visitors in their picturesque and varied uniforms testified to the far-reaching popularity of the Duke of Devonshire and the hostess. The Maharajah of Kapurthala, the Thakur Sahib of Gondal and the Maharanee, the Maharajah Sir Pertab Singh, Thakur Hari Singh, Kumar Dhopal Singh, Rajah Khetri Singh, Rajah Agit Singh, Raj Kuman Umaid of Shapura, Bijey Singh, Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy and Miss and the Messrs. Jejeebhoy, and the Maha Mudalayar of Kandy, besides the officers of the Imperial Service Troops and the Officers of the Native Cavalry Corps were present. Among those who attended were: Dona Solomon Dias Bandaranaike and Miss Amy Dias Bandaranaike, Senathi Rajah, Deir Senathi Rajah ....[33]\n\nThat is, assuming that those who were in London on 6 July 1897 were also likely in London on 2 July, these visitors from South Asia might have attended the fancy-dress ball as well:\n\nThe Maharajah of Kapurthala\n\nThe Thakur Sahib of Gondal and the Maharanee\n\nThe Maharajah Sir Pertab Singh\n\nThakur Hari Singh\n\nKumar Dhopal Singh\n\nRajah Khetri Singh\n\nRajah Agit Singh, who visited the Lafayette studios in London on 18 June 1897, so we know he could have been in London between then and the ball. Russell Harris's The Lafayette Studio and Princely India says, \"The Illustrated London News, describing foreign visiting dignitaries to London, said of him: 'He personally administers the State and manages his six properties, one of which, yielding a rental of Rs 150,000, was granted to him by the British Government as a reward for the military services of his ancestors.' The Raja was a good friend and an ardent disciple of Swami Vivekananda.\"[34]\n\nRaj Kuman Umaid of Shapura\n\nBijey Singh\n\nSir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy and Miss and the Messrs. Jejeebhoy\n\nThe Maha Mudalayar of Kandy\n\nDona Solomon Dias Bandaranaike and Miss Amy Dias Bandaranaike\n\nSenathi Rajah\n\nDeir Senathi Rajah\n\nThe list of attendees to this garden party follows the pattern of the typical list for this kind of event that included royals, visiting dignitaries and officials, and aristocracy from other nations. That is, people are listed more or less in rank order and grouped by family, as if the newspaper had received a copy of the invitation list itself. The list of people who attended the fancy-dress ball is not ordered in these ways, as if the newspapers were not given the invitation list. This difference might explain why the Morning Post knew the names of these dignitaries from South Asia on 7 July but did not on 3 July.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Bourke, but Hon. Mr. and Hon. Mrs. A. Bourke are at 325 and 236, respectively.\n\nMr. S. Cavendish (at 656) may be an error; he may be Mr. R. Cavendish, who is already in the list (at 107)\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery letterpress on her portrait says that Lady Helen Stewart is Lady Mary Stewart, Helen Mary Theresa Vane-Tempest-Stewart (at 43, right after her mother in this list). Helen Stewart-Murray, daughter of the Duke of Atholl (at 657) was probably a misidentification.\n\nLord J. Blackwood (at 718) and Lady J. Blackwood (at 719) are difficult to identify given the honorifics. Possibly the J. is a typo for T. in the Times report?\n\nThe Ladies Villiers were in a quadrille with the Ladies Ker: The Ladies Ker are at 23, two women. If each woman had one sash, then there were 2 ladies Villiers and 2 ladies Ker. Lady Edith Villiers (at 282) was definitely in the Cosway quadrille; Lady M. Villiers (at 433) is probably Lady Margaret Villiers, so that might be both the Ladies Villiers. (Mr. E. Villiers is at 326.)\n\nThe Times article[35] lists both Mrs. George Curzon and then later Mr. and Mrs. Curzon; was George there? or was this another couple? Several people are treated this way, mentioned earlier in the Times article and then apparently showing up later, with fewer honorifics, especially if they are Hon.'s. Also, there may be duplicates because of variant spellings of the names.\n\nThe Stanleys — the family name of the Earls of Derby — were a challenge to untangle, and a few remain unidentified, like E. Stanley (at 248), who is probably not Lord Edward Stanley (at 188), who was not in the Duchess procession, as E. Stanley was said to be, and who would likely not be called E. Stanley, as Lord Edward was expected to be the next Earl of Derby. Lady W. Stanley (at 474) and Lady J. Stanley (at 250) are also unidentified at this time.\n\nIn no particular order, just as their names were found in the newspapers. The only real rational order would be in order of precedence and then alphabetical among those who\n\nAlbert Edward, Prince of Wales\n\nAlexandra, Princess of Wales, train borne by\n\nHon.

A. Bourke is at 235)\n\nMrs. Bourke (the Hon. Mrs. A. Bourke is at 236)\n\nThe Hon. Cyril Ward\n\nGeorge Cornwallis-West\n\nNewspapers listed in the descriptions of the people at the ball and their costumes some people who were clearly there as attendants, who were not there in their own right, as people the Duchess would have invited:\n\n\"Black attendants\" followed the Court in the Empress Catherine II of Russia procession, preceding the Italian procession.[36][35]\n\nThere were unnamed Imperial Trumpeters in the Court in the Empress Catherine II of Russia procession. They had to really be able to play the trumpet so perhaps were hired musicians?\n\nHeralds led the Queen Elizabeth Procession, but they are not named, so they were probably not invited guests but servants or attendants of some kind?\n\nAccording to the Leamington Spa Courier, the Countess of Warwick's \"four pages shared in the compliments.\"[37] According to the Guernsey Star, Lady Warwick \"was accompanied by four boys dressed in white satin, with three-cornered hats to match.\"[38]\n\nThe Marchioness of Tweeddale also had two pages: \"The Marchioness of Tweeddale was Joséphine, wife of Napoleon, in white satin, wrought with gold and a deep rose-coloured train, trimmed with ermine, and borne by two pages in mauve velvet, embroidered with gold.\"[38]\n\nPrincess Henry of Pless had black and white pages: \"As the Queen of Sheba, Princess Henry of Pless was attended by five black pages and five white, in gorgeous dresses, who carried her train.\"[38]\n\nGwladys Robinson, Countess de Grey — Ethiopian or Nubian attendant.\n\nIn the large list of people who were present for the ball, above, attendants are listed with the people for whom they worked; typically royals had attendants with them.\n\nClearly, some of these attendants were black people (especially at 1 and 6). The vocabulary the newspapers used ranged from \"Black\" to \"Negro\" to the actual n-word (for American Minnie Paget?). The Aberdeen Journal of 4 August 1897 ran a story, \"Black Boys for London Ladies,\" that refers to the black attendants at the Duchess of Devonshire's ball:\n\nTitian’s pictures (says London correspondent) have made us familiar with black boys forming part of the train of certain great ladies. The Prince of Wales brought a Nubian boy home, and for a time he was in the Marlborough House and Sandringham households. The Duchess of Marlborough is very often accompanied by a black boy in Oriental scarlet and gold, who seems but live to obey her grace’s behests; for his dark, piercing eyes follow her every movement, giving him a weird look, which is increased by the curious incision in his cheeks. At the Devonshire House fancy ball the glory of the great Oriental procession was much increased by the Nubian boys, who carried palm-leaves over some of the queenly heads.[39]\n\nWe need to know more about these children.\n\nThe London Daily News and the Times reported as attending Lady Hindlip, who was not able to attend, according to the Morning Post, suggesting that they may have gotten a list of people attending from something other than onsite reportage, perhaps from someone describing the costumes that had been made.\n\nOf the people who were not present but seem missing because their immediate family, for example, was present, some are women, the wives of the people named. So perhaps they did not court newspaper attention? Of the men who might have been there, logically, perhaps they did not dress in costume and thus did not receive mention? (We know some men attended the ball and were not in fancy dress.)\n\nSamuel Allsopp, Lord Hindlip and Georgina Allsopp, Lady Hindlip were not present because Lord Hindlip was ill and died less than two weeks later.\n\nColonel Brabazon \"unavoidably prevented\" from attending.[40]\n\nMrs. Hwfa Williams was reported in the Morning Post not to have attended because she was in mourning.[41] Owen's and Hwfa Williams' sister Edith Peers-Williams had died. Although General or Mr. Owen Williams is not listed as having attended, his wife Mrs. Nina Williams (at 457) was said to have been present, but really it seems most likely that none of them attended.\n\nFanny Ronalds was there, but Arthur Sullivan's name is not listed; was he there but not in an interesting costume? Or not present?\n\nLady Violet de Trafford was there (at 238, above), but her husband? or son?, Sir Humphrey Francis de Trafford, 3rd Baronet, is not listed.\n\nMrs. Henry White isn't listed as present, but Mr. Henry White is at 310, and Margaret \"Daisy\" Stuyvesant Rutherford White is now at 151. I believe she was present because both Whites were photographed in costume and that photograph is in the album at the NPG.\n\nEven though Henry Maurice William Oppenheim and his daughter, Rosalinda Oppenheim were present, Mrs. Isabel Georgina Oppenheim (who does not appear to have been Rosalinda's mother) is not listed anywhere as being present.\n\nJesusa Murrieta del Campo Mello y Urritio (née Bellido), Marquisa de Santurce attended the Duchess of Devonshire's fancy-dress ball at Devonshire House. Mr. F. Murrieta (at 708) was present according to The Gentlewoman, but who was he? Her husband, José Murrieta y del Campo Downey, 1st Marques de Santurce, is not listed as having been present although he was still alive. Possibly the F. is a mistake on the part of The Gentlewoman, and it was Don José who was there?\n\nBaron William Cansfield Gerard, Lady Mary Gerard's husband: she was present (at 256) and represented in the album, but he's not mentioned. Was he there?\n\nThe Hon. Mrs. Gwendoline Lowther (at 672), was present, but her husband, whose brother was Hugh Cecil Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale and who would be later in his own right, was not?\n\nRosamond Fellowes, Lady de Ramsey (at 329) was present, but William Fellowes, Baron de Ramsey was not?\n\nFlorence Canning, Lady Garvagh (at 336) attended the ball. Where was Charles Canning, Lord Garvagh? Did he just not get mentioned?\n\nNellie, Countess of Kilmorey (at 207) attended the ball, but Francis Needham, Earl of Kilmorey did not?\n\nPrince Leopold's wife, Helena, Duchess of Albany wasn't there?\n\nPrincess Beatrice didn't go?\n\nLilias Bathurst is not listed has having attended the Duchess of Devonshire's ball, although her husband Henry Bathurst, 7th Earl of Bathurst, her parents Algernon Borthwick, Lord Glenesk and Alice, Lady Glenesk and her brother Oliver Borthwick were there. A child was not born to her in 1897 as far as I can tell, although we may not be able to know about a miscarriage. Perhaps she was present and not reported on.\n\nMrs. Louise Loder is not listed among the attendees at the ball; was she there and just not reported on? No child was born that year, but she was bearing children during this time. Gerald Loder is at 100.\n\nWas Lady Mary Bertie Talbot at the ball? She is not mentioned. She isn't likely to be Mrs. Talbot because her father was an Earl? She would have been Lady Talbot?\n\nWas James Charles Hope-Vere present at the ball and just not mentioned? Marie Hope-Vere was not mentioned in the press, so without the Album of portraits of people in their costumes in the National Portrait Gallery, we might not know about her.\n\nDid Ned (Edward Arthur) Colebrooke attend the ball? Alexandra Paget Colebrooke (at 246) did.\n\nWas Countess Arthur de Heeren at the ball and not reported on?\n\nMrs. Margaret Greville (298) was there; was Ronald Greville but not mentioned in reports?\n\nThe wife of M.
