        "text": "Caption\n\nIn 1680 it was reported by the Dowager Countess of Sunderland that, at the age of twenty, the Duke had a ‘blemish on one eye, that ‘tis offensive to look upon it’, which was removed. Although his eyesight was saved, he wore an eyepatch, but this does not appear in known portraits. Charles Talbot was the first son of Francis, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury (c.1623 – 1668) and his second wife, Anna Maria (1642 – 1702). He was the first godchild of Charles II following the Restoration, and on the death on his parents he succeeded to the Earldom, and was placed under the guardianship of, amongst others, Sir John Talbot of Lacock.
