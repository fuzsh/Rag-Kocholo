With a complete list of the stall-plates in St. George's chapel; London, Published for the dean and canons of St. George's chapel in Windsor castle by the Society for promoting Christian knowledge, 1939.\n\nSt. George's chapel is the home of the Order of the Garter. The stalls that line the walls of the 14th c. choir are reserved for the knights of the order. Each of the 26 knights is assigned to a stall. By tradition, the knight's banner hangs above the stall, and his crest and mantling are placed on top of the helm surmounting the stall's canopy. At the knight's death banner, crest and mantling are taken away. However, a small brass plate enameled with his arms is also affixed to the stall, and remains in perpetuity (in principle).\n\nAt present, the oldest plates still in place date from the late 14th c. Many of the plates representing the early knights date from later periods.\n\nThe number of knights was originally 26, and accordingly the stalls were numbered from 1 (Sovereign's stall) to 26, with the odd numbers on the south side and the even numbers on the north side (that is the system used in earlier reference works such as Ashmole and Joseph Pote, 1749). In the 19th century, with the admission of foreign knights and Princes of the Blood Royal, the number of stalls in use increased. Fellowes decided to number the stalls on each side, S1 to S27 on the south side and N1 to N27 on the north side. The older number, when applicable, is between parentheses. The dates are those of investiture or installation, unless followed by el, in which case they are the date of election.\n\nOriginally a knight was assigned to a stall and remained there. Starting in the 16th century, knights changed stalls based on seniority as vacencies opened among better-positioned stalls. Up to the early 16th c., documents exist that list the succession of knights for each stall. Fellowes publishes that list.\n\nThe next section lists the knights for which no plate is found in the chapel. In most cases this results from the fact that they were never installed (during the Commonwealth period, for example, or during George III's madness). In other cases, the plates simply went missing. Finally, Fellowes lists the Ladies of the Garter.\n\nNote: The text is pretty much as it stands in Fellowes' 1939 publication (I have omitted references to Pope's publication.) It contains a number of errors. Corrections are made to the separate chronological list of Knights of the Garter.\n\nThree knights are missing from Fellowes' list: number 289 (William Blunt, Lord Mountjoy), number 294 (Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland), and number 631 (George Legge, earl of Dartmouth).\n\nOn the chapel, see also:\n\nThe official page on Windsor Castle (limited content)\n\nAn article in Royal Insight on the chapel, with several good illustrations\n\nYvonne Demoskoff's page on St. George's chapel\n\nSouth Side\n\nThe Sovereign's Stall (1)\n\nNo plates\n\nStall S2\n\n1839 (685) Francis Albert Augustus Charles Emanuel, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

It is stated by Hope that Lord Worcester's plate was discovered in a \"marine store\" in New Zealand and replaced in its original stall in 1898. If this is true it is regrettable that it should have been moved away in 1938. However, Lord Worcester was never installed here but in S.13 and for a time in N.19 (B.M. Add.MS. 6298, fo. 203 ; see also the Windsor Tables, which place him in N.19). In Pote's time and later, as shown in a plan of the plates circa 1800 in the Erary at Windsor, this plaque was in Stall N5 (6) immediately below the plate of the King of Portugal. The original plate was recorded as missing as long ago as circa 1560 (B.M. Add, MS. 6298), and it is extremely unlikely that this is the original plate. A further point must be recorded. In no case, as Hope says (Preface to Stall-Plates, p. 16), does a stall-plate exhibit an impalement. This plate is blazoned with the arms of Somerset impaling Herbert. Moreover, in style and design it differs from all other stall-plates, incidentally having no provision for fixing in its place. This armorial plaque certainly represents the first Earl of Worcester, but it is more likely that it has belonged to some monument associated with him; and unquestionably it is of contemporary date.\n\nStall N7 (8)\n\nc.1415el (132) Sir William Phelipp. Afterwards 6th Lord Bardolf Fought at Agincourt.\n\n1445 (159) Sir John Beauchamp.
