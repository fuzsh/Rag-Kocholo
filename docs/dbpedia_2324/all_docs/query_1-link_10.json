        "text": "John Talbot, 1st earl of Shrewsbury (born c. 1384—died July 17, 1453, Castillon, Fr.) was the chief English military commander against the French during the final phase of the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453).\n\nThe son of Richard, 4th Baron Talbot, he served in campaigns in Wales between 1404 and 1413 and as lieutenant of Ireland (1414–19), when he joined the English army in France. He fought at Verneuil in 1424 and took part in the unsuccessful siege of Orléans in 1429. Talbot’s rashness was largely responsible for the severe English defeat at Patay (June 1429), where he was taken prisoner. Released in 1433, he captured Clermont the following year. By suppressing the revolt of the Pays de Caux in 1436, he prevented Normandy from falling under French control. As a reward, King Henry VI made him marshal of France."
