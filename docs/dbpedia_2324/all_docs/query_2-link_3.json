        "text": "On 16 Jan 1668 George Villiers 2nd Duke of Buckingham (age 39) fought a duel at Barn Elms with [his father] Francis Talbot 11th Earl of Shrewsbury (age 45) with whose wife [his mother] Anna Maria Brudenell Countess Shrewsbury and Waterford (age 25) he was conducting a relationship. Francis Talbot 11th Earl of Shrewsbury (age 45) was fatally wounded dying two months later. Following the duel George Villiers 2nd Duke of Buckingham (age 39) commenced living with Shrewsbury's wife Anne Maria (age 25). His wife Mary Fairfax Duchess Buckingham (age 29) returned to live with her parents.\n\nAdmiral Robert Holmes (age 46) and Jenkins acted as seconds to George Villiers 2nd Duke of Buckingham (age 39). Jenkins was killed.\n\nJohn Talbot of Lacock (age 37) and Bernard Howard (age 27) acted as seconds to Francis Talbot 11th Earl of Shrewsbury (age 45). Note. Bernard Howard a guess based on name and age.\n\nOn 16 Mar 1668 Francis Talbot 11th Earl of Shrewsbury (age 45) died from wounds received duelling. He was buried at Albrighton, Shropshire. His son Charles Talbot 1st Duke Shrewsbury (age 7) succeeded 12th Earl of Shrewsbury, 12th Earl Waterford.\n\nEvelyn's Diary. 19 Feb 1686. Many bloody and notorious duels were fought about this time. The Duke of Grafton (age 22) kill'd [his brother] Mr. Stanley, brother to the Earle of Shrewsbury (age 25), indeede upon an almost insufferable provocation. It is to be hop'd his Ma* (age 52) will at last severely remedy this unchristian custome. Lord Sunderland (age 44) was now Secretary of State, President of the Council, and Premier Minister.\n\nEvelyn's Diary. 05 May 1695. I came to Deptford, Kent [Map] from Wotton, Surrey [Map], in order to the first meeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital [Map] for seamen at Greenwich; it was at the Guildhall [Map], London. Present, the Archbishop of Canterbury (age 58), Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin (age 49), Duke of Shrewsbury (age 34), Duke of Leeds (age 63), Earls of Dorset (age 52) and Monmouth (age 37), Commissioners of the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren (age 71), and several more. The Commission was read by Mr. Lowndes, Secretary to the Lords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.\n\nEvelyn's Diary. 24 Apr 1700. This week there was a great change of State officers. The Duke of Shrewsbury (age 39) resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of Jersey (age 44), the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat. Mr. Vernon (age 54), Secretary of State, was put out. The Seal was taken from the Lord Chancellor Somers (age 49), though he had been acquitted by a great majority of votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons. This being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in this fluctuating conjuncture. It is certain that this Chancellor was a most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known. But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which protected the people from tyranny."
