        "text": "(1660–1718).\n\nBrought up a Roman catholic, Talbot converted to Anglicanism in 1679, and was one of the ‘Immortal Seven’ who, in 1688, signed the letter inviting William of Orange to invade. In 1689 he was appointed secretary of state, but resigned in 1690. In 1694 he again became secretary of state and was created a duke. Appointed lord chamberlain in 1699, he resigned on health grounds in 1700. He was appointed lord chamberlain in the Tory ministry (1710–14), and lord‐lieutenant of Ireland in 1713. On the dismissal of Harley, Queen Anne appointed Shrewsbury lord treasurer, thwarting Bolingbroke's ambition, and upon the queen's death (1 August) he helped to secure the Hanoverian succession. His final office was again as lord chamberlain (1714–15)."
