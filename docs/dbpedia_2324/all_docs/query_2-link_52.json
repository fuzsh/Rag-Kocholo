        "text": "The Immortal Seven\n\nIn preparing for the Horn & Crown campaign arc, I’ve been doing research on many of the power players in King William’s Court. And while not exclusive to them, it certainly means doing the work researching the Immortal Seven. I’ve already picked a few of these personages to play a prominent background role in the new story arc, but I like to have a more complete picture of the time. There is much more to these men than what is included in the profiles below, but in the interests of the campaign my notes focus on the period of 1689 and 1690, leading up to the Battle of Boyne in the Summer of 1690.\n\nThe following information has been culled from Wikipedia (naturally) and a few other sources throughout the internet.\n\nTHE IMMORTAL SEVEN\n\nThe Immortal Seven were the seven individuals who put their name to the formal letter of invitation sent on the 30th of June, 1688, to William of Orange requesting that he make the necessary preparations to depose James II. Together they represented a broad selection of the highest level of English society, sufficient to convince William of Orange that he would enjoy a suitably wide degree of support from across the country.\n\nOn the afternoon of the 30th June 1688 seven men sat down to put their names to a formal letter of invitation to William of Orange.\n\n“…the people are so generally dissatisfied with the present conduct of the government in relation to their religion, liberties and properties (all which have been greatly invaded), and they are in such expectation of their prospects being daily worse, that Your Highness may be assured there are nineteen parts of twenty of the people throughout the kingdom who are desirous of a change.”\n\nNone of the seven were so foolish as to actually sign their names to the invitation itself, but rather identified themselves by a secret code, a two digit number (that follows their names below). The letter was duly carried to the Netherlands by Arthur Herbert, the Earl of Torrington (discreetly referred to as Mr H within the letter) and had the desired effect as William of Orange ordered the necessary military and naval preparations for his invasion of Britain.\n\nAll seven of these gentlemen received their due rewards when William of Orange and his wife Mary became settled in as William and Mary.\n\nThese seven men were thereafter known as the Immortal Seven:\n\nThe Earl of Devonshire, William Cavendish (24)\n\nWhig; House of Commons from 1661 to 1684\n\nleader of the anti-court and anti-Catholic party\n\nAge: 50\n\nson of William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire\n\ninherited his father’s peerage as Earl of Devonshire\n\none of the wealthiest landowners in the country\n\nAfter the revolution, Cavendish is a leading Whig, serving as William’s Lord Steward\n\nThe Lord Lumley, Richard Lumley (29)\n\nAge: 40\n\nThe Lumleys were an ancient family from the north of England\n\nson of John Lumley; grandson of Richard Lumley, 1st Viscount Lumley\n\nplayed a prominent part in the suppression of the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth\n\npersonally responsible (according to John Evelyn) for Monmouth’s arrest\n\nwife: Frances Jones, daughter of Sir Henry Jones of Oxford\n\nSecured Newcastle for William in December 1688\n\nappointed by William in rapid succession (1689-90) as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, a member of the Privy Council, Colonel of the 1st Troop of Horse Guards, Viscount Lumley of Lumley Castle, Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland and Lord Lieutenant of Durham\n\nLumley is created Earl of Scarbrough on 15 April 1690\n\nThe Earl of Danby, Thomas Osborne (27)\n\nTory\n\nAge: 58\n\nImpeached and disgraced member of Parliament with nearly no supporters he could rely on\n\nSpent nearly five years in the Tower of London following his impeachment\n\nA number of pamphlets asserting his complicity in the Popish Plot, and even accusing him of the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, were published in 1679 and 1680\n\nfollowing his imprisonment and release, returned to the House of Lords as a leader in the Tory party\n\nDriven to opposition by King James’ attacks on Protestantism\n\nThought that William would not claim the crown\n\nSupported the succession of Mary\n\nThis met with little support\n\nrejected both by William and by Mary herself\n\nvoted against the regency and joined with Halifax and the Commons in declaring the prince and princess joint sovereigns.\n\nApril 1689 created Marquess of Carmarthen\n\nmade lord-lieutenant of the three ridings of Yorkshire\n\ngreatly disliked by the Whigs\n\ngiven the nickname the “White” marquess in allusion to his sickly appearance\n\nFebruary 1689: appointed to the post of Lord President of the Council\n\ncould not conceal his vexation and disappointment\n\nincreased by the appointment of Halifax as Lord Privy Seal (Treasurer Position that he had held before his disgrace).\n\nThe antagonism between the “black” and the “white” marquess revived in all its bitterness.\n\nretired to the country and was seldom present at the council.\n\nIn June and July, motions were made in Parliament for his removal\n\nIn 1690: Halifax’s retires in 1690\n\nOnce again again acquired the post of Lord Treasurer\n\nIn 1690, appointed Mary’s chief advisor\n\nThe Earl of Shrewsbury, Charles Talbot (25)\n\nAge: 30\n\ncrossed to Holland to join William\n\ncontributed towards defraying the expenses of the projected invasion\n\nlanded with him in England in November 1688 during the Glorious Revolution\n\nappointed Secretary of State for the Southern Department\n\n1690: resigned from office when the Tories gained control of Parliament\n\nThere is evidence that he had made overtures to the Jacobites after his resignation\n\nin correspondence with James at his court in exile at Saint Germains\n\nsome evidence that these relations were entered upon with William’s full connivance\n\nOthers claim Shrewsbury was unaware of the King’s knowledge and toleration which would explain the terrified letters he was in the habit of penning to him.\n\nRegardless, although often presented with evidence against him, William affected to have no suspicion of Shrewsbury’s loyalty\n\nThe Bishop of London, Henry Compton (31)\n\nTory\n\nAge: 58\n\nimportant figure about London\n\na successful botanist\n\nPublished:\n\nseveral theological works\n\nthe Life of Donna Olympia Maladichini (1667)\n\ntranslated from Italian\n\ngoverned the Church during the time of Pope Innocent X (1644 to 1655)\n\nthe Jesuits’ Intrigues (1669)\n\ntranslated from French\n\nA book on the Invisible World and the supernatural\n\npublished under a pseudonym\n\nliberal in his views about Protestants; strong bias against Catholics\n\nFebruary 1685: Lost his seat in the council and position as Dean of the Chapel Royal on the accession of James II\n\nsuspended by James’s Court of High Commission in mid-1686.\n\nfor his firmness in refusing to suspend John Sharp\n\nrector of St Giles’s-in-the-Fields\n\nanti-papal preaching had rendered him obnoxious to the king\n\nThe suspension was lifted in September 1688, two days before the High Commission was abolished\n\nembraced the cause of William and Mary,\n\nperformed the ceremony of their coronation\n\nhis old position was restored to him\n\nAppointed to the Privy Council; serves as an advisor to the King and Queen of England, an office that he has had before\n\nchosen as one of the commissioners for revising the liturgy\n\nThe Witch Hunter Adventures, The Legion Cycle and its predecessor, A Child’s Game, establish Henry Compton as a major figure in London and someone the cadre is likely to interact with. This information is reprinted from those sources.\n\nthough not a Witch Hunter, he is a friend of the Stalwarts of St. Christopher\n\nthe original text establishes his connection with Brotherhood of Ashen Cross, which doesn’t make a lot of sense given his prejudices and biases against Catholics. The Stalwarts have roots in Anglicanism and makes much more sense.\n\nconcerned about a number of supernatural threats that seemed to be moving into the area, along with London’s new growth.\n\nParticularly concerned that many of these new evils seem to be using London as a gateway to the New World.\n\nCaptain Edward Russell (35)\n\nWhig\n\nAge: 37\n\nelected Whig Member of Parliament for Launceston\n\n1689: appointed Treasurer of the Navy in 1689.\n\nMay 1689: Promoted directly to full admiral\n\nRussell took command in the Channel\n\nHMS Duke\n\nenforced a blockade of France\n\nlived at Chippenham Park in Cambridgeshire\n\nre-modelled the manor house and greatly extended Chippenham Park\n\ndominates the parish to the south of the village\n\nMarch 1690: elected Member of Parliament for Portsmouth in the general election in March 1690.\n\nSpring 1690: conveyed Maria Anna of Neuburg, Charles II of Spain’s future consort, from Flushing to Coruna\n\nJune 1690: becomes a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty on the Admiralty board led by the Earl of Pembroke\n\nJuly 1690: promoted to Admiral of the Fleet following the debacle at the Battle of Beachy Head\n\nAdmiral the Earl of Torrinton fell out of favor\n\nDecember 1690: became Commander-in-Chief of the Navy.\n\nHe was fully engaged in providing naval support for the Williamite War in Ireland until the war ended in October 1691\n\nHenry Sidney (33)\n\nWhig\n\nAge: 49\n\nOften dismissed as a mere flunkey and court favorite, nevertheless a expert Statesman,\n\nan adroitness for manipulating men\n\n1679: entered Parliament\n\n1688: employed by nephew, the 2nd Earl of Sunderland, Robert Spencer to negotiate with William of Orange\n\nSunderland had recently been disgraced for role in the Trail of the Seven Bishops and was no friend to King James\n\none of the signatories to, and the actual author of, the cipher sent to the Prince calling for the Glorious Revolution.\n\ncreated Baron Milton and Viscount Sidney by William\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\n↓\n\n↓\n\n↓"
