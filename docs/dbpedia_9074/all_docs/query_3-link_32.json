        "text": "The Sovereign Military and Hospitaler Order of St John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta is one of the oldest institutions of Western and Christian civilization. The lay Catholic Order has 13,500 members who are committed to the exercise of Christian virtue and charity.\n\nTrue to its founding principles, the Order of Malta’s motto echoes its priorities: “Tuitio Fidei et Obsequium Pauperum”, i.e. nurturing, witnessing, and protecting the faith, and serving the poor and the sick. The Order’s members – together with 150,000 employees and volunteers – consistently work to bring these principles to life by engaging in voluntary work, humanitarian assistance, and medical and social activities. Today, the Order carries out charitable and humanitarian activities in over 120 countries.\n\nBased in Rome, the Order has full diplomatic relations with 112 countries, as well as with European and international organizations. It has permanent observer status at the United Nations. Thanks to this diplomatic network, the Order can react quickly and flexibly to crises and disasters around the world. Its embassies also have the mission of supporting the medical and humanitarian activities of the national associations of the Order and Malteser International. As a neutral and non-political party, the Order can act as mediator in civil and armed conflicts and to intervene as a protective force.\n\nThe Order of Malta’s international network plays an essential role in our work, allowing us to quickly and efficiently provide relief to those most in need. Currently, 27 national associations and priories of the Order of Malta are members of Malteser International, and actively support the organization within their jurisdictions. Both regional branches in Europe and the Americas serve as associate members. Their representatives, together with the Board of Directors, the Grand Hospitaller of the Order of Malta, the Chaplain, the Secretary General and the Vice-Secretary General form the General Assembly: the organization’s highest decision-making body. The General Assembly is responsible for electing and discharging the Board of Directors, accepting the annual accounts, ordering financial audits as well as passing amendments to the by-laws. The President convokes the General Assembly once a year. The following associations and priories of the Order of Malta are presently members of Malteser International:"
