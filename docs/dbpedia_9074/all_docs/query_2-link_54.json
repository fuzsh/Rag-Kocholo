        "text": "Abstract: The origin of the Order dates back to the l0th Century, when some of the Merchants from Amalfi (Italy) founded a 'hospital' in Jerusalem to take care of the weary and tired pilgrims visiting the Holy Land. Then, under the leadership of Raimondo De Podia (its first Grand Master) it became a Military Order, intimately linked with a number of victories and military occurrences. Unlike its predecessors, the S.M.O.M. is today a purely a non belligerent body totally dedicated to deeds of philanthropic nature. In Malta, the year 1968 saw the opening of both a seat (of an Ambassadorial nature) in St. John's Cavalier, and of a blood clinic in St. Ursula Street, Valletta. To help in its fund raising drive the Order issues for the present, two to three sets of stamps every year."
