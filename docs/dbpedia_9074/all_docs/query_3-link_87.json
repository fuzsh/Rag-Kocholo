Besides creating misunderstanding and confusion, they hurt the good will the Order has established over many years.\n\nThese organisations have no connection whatsoever with the Sovereign Military Order of Malta whose headquarters is located in Rome, at Via Condotti 68, and which maintains formal diplomatic relations with over 99 States and International Organisations. It is also recognised by the United Nations, and by the Holy See."
