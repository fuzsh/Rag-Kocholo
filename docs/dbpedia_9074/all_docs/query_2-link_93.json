        "text": "Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta\n\nOrdre souverain militaire hospitalier de Saint-Jean de Jérusalem, de Rhodes et de Malte\n\nSovrano Militare Ordine Ospedaliero di San Giovanni di Gerusalemme, di Rodi e di Malta (SMOM)\n\nFounded\n\n1099 Jerusalem Israel\n\nHistory\n\nat an unknown date before 1099, Jerusalem (Israel), when the Crusaders took that city, as a monastic confraternity administering a hospital for pilgrims which had been set up in 1048. Received recognition from the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem prior to 1099. On 15 Feb 1113, by Papal Bull of Pope Paschal II, formally recognized by the Holy See as a religious order with the title Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem -- Hospitaliers de Saint Jean de Jérusalem. Headquarters were located in the Holy Land until 1291, when the last Christian stronghold in the Holy land was lost, then for a time in Cyprus, then on Rhodes, occupation being completed in 1310. After repeated attacks from Turkey, the Knights of Rhodes -- Chevaliers de Rhodes were forced to abandon Rhodes on 10 Jan 1523, and had no territory until they were given the island of Malta in 1530, where they remained until the end of the 18th century. Malta was lost by military occupation in the Napoleonic Wars, although the Order has never de jure recognized such occupation. Since 1834, headquarters have been located in Rome (Italy). The Order now has a legal position similar to that of the Pontifical States in 1870, before the creation of the Vatican State in 1929. The Order's life and activities are currently regulated by: a Constitutional Charter adopted in 1961, which contains a precise definition of both the religious and the sovereign status of the Order and has been approved by the Holy See; a Code issued in 1966. The Charter and Code were revised by Extraordinary Chapter General, 28-30 Apr 1997, Rome. The Order is frequently referred to by abbreviated title: Sovereign Military Order of Malta -- Ordre souverain et militaire de Malte -- Orden Soberana y Militar de Malta -- Sovrano Militare Ordine di Malta.\n\nAims\n\nRender assistance to the underprivileged throughout the world in order to make them contributors, rather than a burden to society.

Council also comprises: the 4 High Offices of the Grand Magistry elected by the General Chapter (Grand Commander, Grand Chancellor, Hospitalier and Receiver of the Common Treasure); the Government Council (meets twice a year), consisting of 6 Councillors from different geographical regions and acting as a consultative body on political, religious, hospitaller and international policies of the Order and other general aspects. Prelate, appointed by the Pope from among 3 candidates presented by the Grand Master, is the ecclesiastical superior of the clergy of the Order in sacerdotal functions. Juridical Council is an expert advisory collegial body comprising President, Vice-President, Secretary-General and 4 members, all appointed by the Grand Master on the advice of the Sovereign Council.
