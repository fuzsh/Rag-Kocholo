The original papal declaration still exists and is on display at the National Library in Valletta, Malta.\n\nAs a religious Order, it is loyal to the Holy See but is also a sovereign subject of international law due to over 500 years of political independence. The Grand Master is simultaneously the head of a sovereign State, the head of a religious Order, and a prince of the Roman Catholic Church. He is assisted by ten knights elected for limited terms on the Sovereign Council.\n\nReligious Superior and Sovereign of the Order of Malta\n\nThe Grand Master is elected for life from among the Professed Knights by the Council Complete of State. According to the Constitution, as the religious Superior and Sovereign, he fully dedicates himself to develop the works of the Order and to set a Christian example to all members of the Order."
