        "text": "Upholding human dignity and caring for people in need\n\nThe Order of Malta is one of the oldest continually existing organizations of Western civilization.\n\nA sovereign subject of international law, the Order of Malta maintains diplomatic relations with over 100 states and the European Union, and has permanent observer status at the United Nations. It is neutral, impartial and apolitical.\n\nFounded in Jerusalem in the second half of the 11th century, the Order of Malta has a long and complex history of service to the vulnerable and the sick throughout the Mediterranean, as reflected by the past headquarter cities contained in its full name: Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta. Since 1834, the Order of Malta’s government seat has been in Rome, where it was granted extraterritorial rights by the Italian Republic.\n\nToday, the Order of Malta is active in 120 countries caring for people through its medical, social and humanitarian works. Its humanitarian projects support millions of forgotten or excluded members of society each year.\n\nActive in 120 countries\n\nThe members of the Order help people living in the midst of armed conflicts and natural disasters by providing medical assistance, caring for refugees, and distributing medicines and basic equipment for survival. Across the world, the Order of Malta is dedicated to the preservation of human dignity and the care of all those in need, regardless of race or religion.\n\nThe Order has diplomatic relations with over 100 countries on six continents.\n\nThe Sovereign Order of Malta is a sovereign subject of international law, with its own Constitution and Code, passports, stamps, and public institutions.\n\nThe Order conducts missions to major European countries, as well as to European and international organizations.\n\nThe Order of Malta is neutral, impartial and apolitical, and offers mediation services to other sovereign states that have unresolved disputes.\n\nThe Order ruled the island of Malta for nearly 300 years until Napoleon and the French navy sent the knights into exile in 1798. The Republic of Malta gained its independence from Great Britain in 1964.\n\nToday, the Order of Malta and the Republic of Malta enjoy cordial bilateral relations and cooperate in the restoration of the Order’s historical sites. In 1999, the two governments signed an agreement granting the Order exclusive use of Fort St. Angelo for a term of 99 years.\n\nThe Order’s diplomatic network strengthens its relationships with the governments of the countries in which it operates. This network allows its medical programs to be integrated into national and regional healthcare systems, and to facilitate the importing of healthcare equipment to reach the needy as quickly as possible.\n\nDue to its status as a neutral, apolitical and independent institution, and its humanitarian role and ongoing activities in 120 countries, the Order of Malta is able to serve as a mediator in disputes between other independent states.\n\nThe Order of Malta is permanently present with medical, social and humanitarian projects in most countries in the world.\n\nThe oldest Christian medical mission in the world.\n\nGlobal Impact\n\nThe Order of Malta is composed of 13,500 members, 95,000 permanent volunteers, and a staff of 52,000 qualified professionals, most of whom are medical personnel and paramedics. They form an efficient network that includes emergency relief for refugees and the displaced living through war and conflict, aid for areas hit by natural disasters, hospital services, medical care and social services. Its programs, run independently or within a framework of partnerships with governments and international agencies, are now active in 120 countries."
