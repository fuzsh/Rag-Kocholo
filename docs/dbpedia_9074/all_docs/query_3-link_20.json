It has its own Government, an independent magistracy, bilateral diplomatic relations with more than 100 countries and is granted the status of Permanent Observer in many international organisations, such as the United Nations. Its operational activities are managed by its 11 Priories and 48 National Associations of Knights in the five continents. The Order issues its own passports and stamps and creates public institutions, endowed with independent juridical personality. The Order’s life is governed by its Constitutional Charter and the Code, reformed in 1997. A new Constitutional Charter and Code came into effect on 3 September 2022.\n\nElected government of the Sovereign Order of Malta\n\nThe Sovereign Council assists the Lieutenant of the Grand Master in the government of the Order of Malta.
