It is located at 3253 Corte S. Giovanni Di Malta.\n\nTranslated from the Priory website:\n\n\"The current seat of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in Venice comes from a palace that was the Templars, and after the confiscation of their property was assigned to the \"Religion of the Hospitallers of St. John.\" We find the first news of the inauguration of the Templars in Venice in an act of donation made on November 9, 1187 by Gerardo, Archbishop of Ravenna, of some land sites in Venice in the locality Fossaputrida, so that they build a hospital and a church; One has reason to believe that the house and the Church of St. John of the temple transferred after the suppression of the Templars to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, were those where it now houses the Grand Priory of Lombardy and Venice. The Fossaputrida would be the territory of San Giovanni in Bragora, current parish in Venice.\n\nIn 1313 the knight Bro Nicola from Parma, Prior of Venice of the Order of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, accompanied by the knight Fra ' Baldwin Trevisan, presented himself to the Doge Soranzo to ask that the goods already belonged to the Templars were Recognized property of the John. The question was accepted and they acquired, as has been said, the convents and churches of St. John of the Temple (also called the Furlani because there lived many citizens from Friuli) and Santa Maria in Broglio (or Brolo).\"\n\nThe Priory is active.\n\nFurther information may be found on the Priory webpage (Italian): (visit link)\n\nName of Military Order: Knights HospitallerLink documenting charitable acts: [Web Link]\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nPosters must have physically visited the location.
