        "text": "The Sovereign Military Order of Malta\n\nIt was once required that officers of the Order of Malta had to be of noble birth, specifically of armigerous families for at least a hundred years. This is because all officers were Knights of Justice or Obedience. Since the 1990s it has been permitted for Knights of Magistral Grace, despite their lack of noble birth, to take the Promise of Obedience and, with the permission of the Sovereign Grand Master and Sovereign Council, may enter the novitiate to become professed Knights of Justice. It is generally held that there are, worldwide, over 13,000 knights and dames of Malta. Only a small number of these are professed religious. Membership of the Order of Malta is by invitation only and solicitations are not entertained.\n\nLIST OF RANKS, AWARDS, AND DECORATIONS OF THE ORDER OF MALTA\n\nFirst Class\n\nKnights of Justice and Conventual Chaplains\n\nVenerable Bailiff Knights Grand Cross of Justice Professed of Solemn Vows\n\nKnights Grand Cross of Justice Professed of Solemn Vows\n\nCommanders of Justice Professed of Solemn Vows\n\nKnights of Justice Professed of Solemn Vows\n\nKnights Grand Cross of Justice Professed of Simple Vows\n\nKnights admitted to the Novitiate\n\nConventual Chaplains Grand Cross Professed of Solemn Religious Vows\n\nConventual Chaplains Professed of Solemn Religious Vows\n\nConventual Chaplains Professed of Simple Religious Vows\n\nSecond Class\n\nKnights and Dames in Obedience Cavalieri\n\nBailiff Knights Grand Cross in Obedience\n\nKnights and Dames Grand Cross in Obedience\n\nKnights and Dames in Obedience\n\nDonatus of Justice\n\nThird Class -
