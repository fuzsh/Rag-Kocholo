        "text": "What is THE ORDER OF MALTA?\n\nThe Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta is one of the oldest institutions of Western and Christian civilization, as well as one of the oldest Catholic religious orders. The Knights and Dames today remain true to its inspiring principles – defending the Catholic Faith and serving the sick and the poor. For centuries the most effective military and naval force, as well as the most advanced medical provider in Christendom, the modern global Order operates around the world as a sovereign subject of international law, maintaining diplomatic relations with 107 nations, and is a permanent observer at the United Nations. The Order of Malta’s international relief arm, Malteser International, is second only to the International Red Cross in providing relief wherever in the world it is needed.\n\nThe Order of Malta was founded in the Holy Land about 1048 AD by Blessed Gerard, who established a hospital to care for the endless flow of pilgrims into Jerusalem after their grueling and dangerous journey of Faith. Pilgrimage is the heritage of the Order and remains a primary focus. The worldwide Order organizes pilgrimages to Lourdes, the Holy Land, and holy sites the world over. One of them is right here in America’s first parish, and the site of America’s oldest Marian Shrine. This shrine, the National Shrine of Our Lady of La Leche at Mission Nombre De Dios in St. Augustine, Florida, is our pilgrim destination on the Baby Steps Camino. Our Camino is fashioned both in spirituality and in action after the great Camino de Santiago de Compostela, fusing prayer and physical exertion, solitude, and fellowship, in pursuit of sanctification in the holy season of Advent."
