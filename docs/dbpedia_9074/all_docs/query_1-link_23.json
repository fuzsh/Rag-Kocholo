        "text": "Knights Of Malta, Knights Of St. John, Knights Hospitaller, Order Of Malta, Knights Of Jerusalem, Different Names But Relate To The Same Order Of The Knights\n\nSettling in Rome\n\nThe Sovereign military Order of Malta after leaving Malta in 1798 had no home for many years.Â They had lost the majority of their arsenal and riches which were taken over by the French who had ousted the Knights of Malta from the islands. At the timeÂ the French navy was sailing to Egypt under the command of Napolean and had stopped in Malta.\n\nDuring the following years the Knights of Malta, after having resided inÂ Messina, Catania and Ferrara,Â finally settled in Rome in 1834 at the Magistral Palace and theÂ Magistral Villa on the Aventine Hill with extra territorialÂ status.Â In 1869Â they wereÂ granted extraÂ territoriality byÂ Italy.\n\nIn this way the Knights of Malta immediately lost their stronghold in the centre of the Mediterranean sea and thus their role immediately changed.\n\nSettling in a different country meant re-establishing themselves. In the second part of the 19th century, the originalÂ mission asÂ hospitallersÂ was again the main concentrated effort of the Order.\n\nSMOM and names of the order\n\nPresently theÂ official nameÂ is theÂ Sovereign Military Hospitallers Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta.\n\nFor practicability the name is abbreviated asÂ â Sovereign Military Order of MaltaÂ orÂ Sovereign Order of MaltaÂ in short SMOM, or Order of Malta â are often used for legal, diplomatic orÂ communication purposes.\n\nSince the head quarters are in Magistral Palace in Rome, the Italian version of the same is âSovrano Militare Ordine Ospedaliero di San Giovanni di Gerusalemme di Rodi e di Malta.â\n\nBut they were also called theÂ Knights of St JohnÂ because the Orderâs patron saintÂ isÂ St. John the Baptist and alsoÂ of JerusalemÂ because of their presence in the Holy Land.\n\nKnights of MaltaÂ is generally synonymous with the medieval Order of Knights of Malta also known as Knights HospitallerÂ or, among other names, Order of St. John.\n\nThey were initially called the Knights HospitallerÂ (orÂ Hospitallers) to describe their mission.Â Also used in the past was the termÂ âThe ReligionâÂ to emphasise the characteristic of religious confraternity.Â After conquering the island of Rhodes inÂ (1310-1523), they becameÂ known asÂ theÂ Knights of Rhodes.\n\nAfter they accepted Malta,Â over which it was sovereign, as their next home in 1530, they were then known as the Knights of Malta.\n\nThe order, although with no official territory of its own, lays claim to a unique international legal status. Under its sovereign status it can print itâs own stamps, coins, license plates, andÂ even provide its own passportsÂ for itsÂ diplomats for diplomatic business.\n\nThe Order has legally registered its name in 16 languages and emblems in around 100 countries. This enables the Order to maintain its 960 years of unique heritage.\n\nIt has held Permanent Observer status at the United Nations (as does the Red Cross) since 1994 and issues \"passports\" to its diplomats for diplomatic business but it does not meet the criteria for being an independent country. It lacks territory, a permanent population, police power, and has no economy.\n\nWhile the Knights of Malta is recognized as an independent country by the Vatican City (a country that doesn't meet all of the criteria for being an independent country itself) and a handful of other Roman Catholic countries.\n\nMedical and humanitarian activities\n\nTheÂ National Associations in many countries around the world... Large-scale hospitaller and charitable activities were carried out duringÂ World War I, and World War II under Grand Master Fraâ Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere (1931-1951).\n\nUnder the Grand Masters Fraâ Angelo de Mojana di Cologna (1962-1988) and Fraâ Andrew Bertie (1988-2008), the projects expanded until they reached the furthermost regions of the world.\n\nThe knights today\n\nToday the Knights of Malta maintains embassies in various countries like Russia, Spain, Hungary,Â PolandÂ and holdsÂ diplomatic relations with 104 countries. These diplomatic relations help the Order to be able to operate its humanitarian aid programmes in 120 countries. Its institutions are present in 54 countries.\n\nToday the Sovereign Military Order of Malta has 13,500 Knights and Dames apart from the thousands of volunteers, to operate its humanitarian programs. The Order offers assistance to humanitarian areas in crisis around the globe, like Syria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti and Afghanistan.Â\n\nThey operateÂ soup kitchens, hospitals and ambulance services around the globeÂ even in European countries. Most of all for the past 50 years they have been dealing extensively with the treatment of leprosy.\n\nAll told, 98,000 members, employees and volunteers work in aid projects in 120 countries; the overall annual operating budget can run to 200 millionÂ EurosÂ ($271 million),Â largely funded by European governments, the U.N. and EU.\n\nToday in Malta\n\nIn the historical agreement reached with the Maltese government in 1998, the Order of St John, was granted the right to occupy the upper part of Fort St. Angelo, comprising of the Magistral Palace, and St. Anneâs chapel. Intensive restoration works of these areas were carried out.\n\nEmbassy of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta\n\nIt is located on top of the St. Johnâs Cavalier within the fortifications of Valletta, the capital city of Malta.\n\nThe Sovereign Military Order of Malta remains the order that gave the Maltese posterity that still survives in this modern world of today."
