        "text": "From the perspective of the Indian Government, an invitation to be the Republic Day chief guest is highly symbolic. Abdel Fattah El-Sisi became the first Egyptian President to get invited to the 74th Republic day of India as a chief guest.\n\nIn 1953, the office of the President of Egypt was first established. The state of Egypt is headed by the president. He is also the Supreme Commander of the Egyptian Armed Forces.\n\nThe current president of Egypt is Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, he was officially elected president in 2014.\n\nMohammed Naguib was the first president of Egypt. He was part of the leaders of the Free Officers Movement. Back then they led the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Naguib took office on 18 June 1953, which was the same day on which Egypt was declared a Republic.\n\nThe country had to go through some harsh times when Sadat was assassinated and Sufi Abu acted as president before the election of his successor, Adly Mansour.\n\nel-Sisi, the current President took office on 8 June 2014, after being elected by the presidential election held on 26–28 May 2014. He was re-elected by the presidential election held on 26–28 March 2018.\n\n— President of India (@rashtrapatibhvn) January 25, 2023\n\nREAD|Republic Day Parade 2023: Tickets, Timings, Guidelines, And Complete Schedule\n\nList of Prime Ministers of New Zealand (1856-2023)\n\nList of Presidents of Egypt (1901-2023)\n\nNo.\n\nName\n\n(Birth–Death)\n\nElected\n\nTerm of office\n\nPolitical party\n\nTook office\n\nLeft office\n\nTime in office\n\nRepublic of Egypt\n\n(18 June 1953 – 22 February 1958)\n\n1\n\nMohamed Naguib\n\n(1901–1984)\n\n—\n\n18 June 1953\n\n14 November 1954\n\n(resigned)\n\n1 year, 149 days\n\nMilitary / Liberation Rally\n\n—\n\nRevolutionary Command Council\n\nChairman: Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser\n\n(1918–197)\n\n—\n\n14 November 1954\n\n23 June 1956\n\n1 year, 222 days\n\nMilitary\n\n2\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser\n\n(1918–1970)\n\n1956\n\n23 June 1956\n\n22 February 1958\n\n1 year, 244 days\n\nNational Union\n\nUnited Arab Republic\n\n(22 February 1958 – 2 September 1971)\n\n2\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser\n\n(1918–1970)\n\n1958\n\n1965\n\n22 February 1958\n\n28 September 1970\n\n(died)\n\n12 years, 218 days\n\nNational Union\n\n(until 1962)\n\nArab Socialist Union\n\n3\n\nAnwar Sadat\n\n(1918–1981)\n\n–\n\n28 September 1970\n\n15 October 1970\n\n17 days\n\nArab Socialist Union\n\n1970\n\n15 October 1970\n\n2 September 1971\n\n322 days\n\nArab Republic of Egypt\n\n(2 September 1971 – present)\n\n3\n\nAnwar Sadat\n\n(1918–1981)\n\n1976\n\n2 September 1971\n\n6 October 1981\n\n(assassinated)\n\n11 years, 8 days\n\nArab Socialist Union\n\n(until 1978)\n\nNational Democratic Party\n\n—\n\nSufi Abu Taleb\n\n(1925–2008)\n\nActing\n\n—\n\n6 October 1981\n\n14 October 1981\n\n8 days\n\nNational Democratic Party\n\n4\n\nHosni Mubarak\n\n(1928–2020)\n\n1981\n\n1987\n\n1993\n\n1999\n\n2005\n\n14 October 1981\n\n11 February 2011\n\n(resigned)\n\n29 years, 120 days\n\nNational Democratic Party\n\n—\n\nSupreme Council of the Armed Forces\n\nChairman: Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi\n\n(1935–2021)\n\n—\n\n11 February 2011\n\n30 June 2012\n\n1 year, 140 days\n\nMilitary\n\n5\n\nMohamed Morsi\n\n(1951–2019)\n\n2012\n\n30 June 2012\n\n3 July 2013\n\n(deposed)\n\n1 year, 3 days\n\nFreedom and Justice Party\n\n—\n\nAdly Mansour\n\n(born 1945)\n\nInterim\n\n—\n\n4 July 2013\n\n8 June 2014\n\n339 days\n\nIndependent\n\n6\n\nAbdel Fattah el-Sisi\n\n(born 1954)\n\n2014\n\n2018\n\n8 June 2014\n\nIncumbent\n\n8 years, 230 days\n\nIndependent\n\nAfter being accorded a ceremonial welcome at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on January 25, the Egyptian President Sisi, President Droupadi Murmu will be hosting a State Banquet in his honor the same evening.\n\nSisi will be attending meetings and delegation-level talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on topics like bilateral, regional, and global issues of mutual interest.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will also call on President Sisi and will interact with the Indian business community at an event on the same day, as per the Ministry of External Affairs.\n\nREAD|List of Prime Ministers of Nepal (1806-2022)\n\nList Of Presidents Of Brazil (1891-2023)"
