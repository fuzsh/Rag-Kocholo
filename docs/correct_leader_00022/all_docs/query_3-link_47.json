        "text": "As part of an official State Visit, the White House State Dinner is an opportunity for the president and first lady to honor a visiting head of state. In addition to expressing goodwill and hospitality, the State Dinner showcases global power and influence and sets the tone for the continuation of dialogue between the president and the visiting head of state.\n\nThe tradition of State Dinners originated in 1874, when President Ulysses Grant hosted King David Kalakaua of the Kingdom of Hawai’i. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt expanded the State Dining Room as part of a larger White House renovation, allowing for larger gatherings. While the White House underwent a complete interior reconstruction from 1948 to 1952, President Harry Truman lived at Blair House and State Dinners took place in local hotels.\n\nThe current traditions and formalities of State Dinners were solidified during the 1950s and 60s. The first lady and her staff are responsible for the elaborate planning and attention behind the ceremony of the State Dinner. The event involves the creation of invitations and carefully selected guest lists, menus, flowers, table settings, seating arrangements and entertainment for the evening. The first lady works closely with her social secretary, the executive residence staff, and the State Department to coordinate every detail of the night.\n\nExamples of State Dinners throughout history:\n\nDecember 1874: First State Dinner for a foreign head of state King David Kalakaua of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Hosted by President Ulysses S. Grant, the king had royal food testers to sample the more than 20-course White House dinner.\n\n1902: The Roosevelt renovation included a major expansion of the State Dining Room from entertaining approximately 40 guests to the accommodation of 120 people. The first dinner held in the renovated White House was in honor of the cabinet members and their wives.\n\nJune 1939: A State Dinner hosted for King George VI, the first visit to the United States by a British monarch.\n\n1941-1945: During World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt held many State Dinners for heads of Allied-recognized exiled governments under Axis rule, including Greece, Yugoslavia, Poland, and the Netherlands.\n\nSeptember 1959: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev was a guest of honor hosted by President Dwight Eisenhower and First Lady Mamie Eisenhower during the height of the Cold War. This was the first State Dinner hosted for a Soviet leader.\n\nNovember 1961: President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy host the first State Dinner for an Indian leader, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nJune 1964: First State Dinner held outside on the White House grounds, a dinner hosted by the President Lyndon Johnson and First Lady Lady Bird Johnson for Chancellor Ludwig Erhard of West Germany in the Rose Garden.\n\nJuly 1976: President Gerald Ford and First Lady Betty Ford hosted a tented State Dinner in the Rose Garden honoring Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh during the celebration of the bicentennial of the American Revolution.\n\nSeptember 1977: President Jimmy Carter and First Lady Rosalynn Carter hosted a State Dinner with 18 Latin American Heads of State following the signing of the Panama Canal treaties.\n\nMarch 1979: A State Dinner hosted by the Carters was held for Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt after the signing of the Camp David Accords between the two countries.\n\nNovember 1985: Although it was not an official State Dinner, the event hosted by President Ronald and First Lady Nancy Reagan in honor of Great Britain’s Prince Charles and Princess Diana created a worldwide sensation when actor John Travolta danced with the Princess.\n\nDecember 1987: State Dinner between General Secretary Mikhail S.
