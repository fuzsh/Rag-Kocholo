        "text": "In the ’80s there must be a new peaceful order in the world. And I have a hunch that we in Egypt can participate in it. To protect this order the United States must accept its responsibilities. You Americans did not ask me for facilities to reach the hostages in Iran. But one day I came and said that I was ready to give the United States such facilities. I remain ready to offer any facilities that will help you reach the Gulf states. For the face of the United States has changed for us from that of the policeman, who represented imperialism and colonialism, to that of the peacemaker.\n\nWe should have a new order in the international economy. As I told Henry Kissinger, long before the prices of oil rose so high, why don’t we call the producers and the consumers of oil together. Let us sit down together and agree upon what we need to build up our countries. Let us regulate oil prices and also commodity and food prices. To whom can the oil-producing countries send their oil? Who will give them the know-how they need, if the West collapses?\n\nIf it is God’s will, I hope I may help make this contribution. Let us agree, producers and consumers on a certain level, on certain ratios, we can become one family. Because all of us need each other.\n\nThat is the dream I have for the ’80s. Let us hope the day will come when I can tell the whole world about my idea. Let us hope for the time when, instead of having confrontation, we have complementations.\n\nWhen I first came to power in 1970, I had to stand by myself. Our people had been taught unfortunately to be totally dependent on their leader. This was indeed their custom. When they become confident of their leader, they give him freedom of action to the extent that they ultimately become totally dependent on him. That was the situation after Nasser’s death.\n\nGamel Abdel Nasser and I had been friends since we were 19. We were young cadets and officers together. When I was sent to jail for the first time in 1942, he took charge of the Free Officers group which I had started. I was in jail for six years. I was released in time to take part in our July 23rd Revolution in 1952. It was I who gave the ultimatum to the king in Alexandria, asking him to leave. When this revolution actually took place, the dream I had had since my childhood was realized.\n\nWe had three foes to fight against in our revolution: the king, foreign colonialism, and our own irresponsible party system, which had become dissolute and hopelessly corrupt. Four years later, in 1956, the British evacuated this country and at last ended the shameful era when the secretary for oriental affairs at their embassy in Cairo was the real ruler of Egypt, fawned upon by the pashas and the party leaders.\n\nYet for all our successes in achieving independence, the revolution failed to establish sound democratic practice. A one-party system was set up, which turned into a totalitarian regime under the name of socialism. Nasser regarded everyone with suspicion. Anxiety gnawed continually at his heart. It was only natural, therefore, that he bequeathed a legacy of suspicion to his colleagues and to everybody. The hate that prevailed in Egypt for 18 years before I assumed the presidency was a destructive force. We still suffer from its consequences.\n\nBut Nasser was my friend. I never quarreled with him but stood by him alike in victory and defeat. In the months before he died, we spent many hours together in his home and at my house near the Pyramids. “Anwar,” he told me, “look to the succession of power.” At that time we had just seen two surprise changes in international politics. Prime Minister [Edward] Heath in England had called an election suddenly and, to his surprise, lost. In Lebanon, according to the constitution left them by the French, they had had another election and Suleiman Franjieh won it by one vote—he was one of the bad ones. We made comparisons with Egypt. I joked with Nasser. “Gamal,” I said, “what will your successor do—this poor man who will have to succeed you. What will he do in place of this giant?”\n\nWe both laughed. I was not even considered. For I had already had two heart attacks. It was clear that I would not succeed him and, indeed, would probably die before him.\n\nEvents turned out otherwise, and I did succeed him. But if we had not been close friends and not spent so much time together that last year, I would have missed many details. In particular there was our relationship with the Soviet Union. The Soviets would have denied facts or asserted things that never happened between them and Nasser. But I knew everything.\n\nPolitically and economically Nasser had left me a pitiable legacy. We had no real relations with any country except the Soviet Union. Many of our own people in the political leadership were Soviet agents. Economically we were almost bankrupt thanks to the Yemeni expedition, the Israeli defeat of 1967, and the Marxist application of socialism. We had had socialist slogans in place of social democracy. Two months after I came to power, I abolished the state sequestration of private property. In May 1971 I ordered the detention centres closed and I put an end to arbitrary arrests. I ordered the Ministry of the Interior to burn the recorded tapes of individuals’ private conversations. This was a symbol of the restoration to the people of their long-lost freedom.\n\nAll this was not easy. The Soviets tried to create havoc for me. They left me not one moment of peace in those first months. So I had to use lots of power in the first stages. For some years I was—I can say without boasting—the sole guarantor of the country’s security. But now everything is changing. With the help of my aides, my friends, and the cadres whom I have trained we have now built a state of institutions. So I could retire at this moment. I should like to remain another year or two to achieve with my political party what I have achieved with my aides. But if I were compelled to retire now, by illness or by death, I would not be sorry. They could now carry on.\n\nThe vice-president and the acting prime minister know every small detail in the workings of this country—inside and out. We have developed a sense of teamwork. We now have a pension and retirement system, which protects our people against disease or disablement and helps their survivors after death. We have a clear view before us.\n\nAll this took me ten years to do. Our very constitutional referendum was in my opinion a turning point in our democratic course. When the majority decided to join the National Democratic Party, the political party I deemed it my duty to establish, they were attracted by tangible achievements. They were attracted by our May 15 revolution which eliminated corrupt centres of power; by the expelling of the Soviet military experts from Egypt; by the October victory; by the peace initiative.\n\nI stepped into the political arena to establish a genuine democracy that would achieve in tangible realities, not merely in words, man’s freedom, his dignity and prosperity. For the same purpose I welcomed the establishment of an opposition party. We call for a patriotic honest opposition, to say “no” when it finds fault with our decisions, to help the majority redress any deviation in its course, but by resorting to proof and not defamation, to facts and not to rumours like the deceitful parties of the past. For no man is above the law. We are all responsible to the people.\n\nThis could have taken 50 years or it might not have been achieved in my lifetime. In a lifetime of a nation, what are 20, 30, or 50 years? But all this took ten years, and I am proud of it.\n\nPoliticians are replaced. Why not? This is life. Our good friend President Carter was defeated by the vote of the American people. That is democracy. The will of the people must always be respected.\n\nThere are two species of people who do not always realize this: artists and politicians. They both want to stay on stage. The artist stays on the stage and won’t leave it until the audience throws eggs at him. The politician waits in the limelight until the people in the streets throw stones. A wise politician knows when to leave. Take the case of my friend Walter Cronkite. When he came to interview me a year ago, he had already decided on his retirement, but he didn’t tell me. “You rogue,” I joked with him later, “why didn’t you tell me then.” But I admire a man who can decide on his retirement at the climax of his success.\n\nFor my part, my only will to the Egyptian people is: keep what I have created with you: the spirit of the Egyptian family. We have been a family for 7,000 years. Whenever the spirit of the family is neglected, we lose our direction and face a miserable end. Whenever we stick to the family tradition, we shall succeed. This is the tradition of this soil. Family ties, family values, family tradition.\n\nEgypt is now one of the happiest countries in the world. We are not self-supporting. We are still suffering from certain difficulties, from lack of services and in various other ways. But because we struggle against the difficulties we are happy. The more you struggle to succeed, the more you take out of life. God Almighty has taught us that Allah changes not the condition of a folk until they change what is in their hearts. I have brought this country back to realize what is the mainstream of our culture: the Egyptian family and its ties. For that I am a most happy man."
