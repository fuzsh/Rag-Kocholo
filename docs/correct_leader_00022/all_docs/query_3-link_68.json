        "text": "Doris Jones\n\nOn October 27, 1975, President and Mrs. Gerald R. Ford hosted a White House State Dinner for His Excellency The President of the Arab Republic of Egypt and Mrs. Sadat. Mrs. Ford and her Social Secretary, Maria Downs, began planning for the dinner, which involved gathering protocol directives from numerous government agencies, including the National Security Council (Ford Library). Based on carefully performed research, Mrs. Ford learned that President Sadat “had a deep appreciation of America’s old West and was a Zane Grey buff” (Downs, 1975). Grey was an American author who gained critical attention for his novels crystallizing folkloric and iconic symbols that shape current perceptions about the American West. Grey’s most notable work is Riders of the Purple Sage (1912) infused millions of readers with vivid imagery about the ever-expanding western landscape and valorized his most venerable character, the American cowboy. It turns out, Grey was one of Sadat’s favorite authors (Ford Library). Armed with this information, Mrs. Ford and Downs set out to create a western-styled-cowboy-themed state dinner that featured Remington and Russell bronze sculptures from the Amon Carter Museum of Western Art (Ford Library). These sculptures were used as decorative centerpieces for each table along with wildflowers dried grasses and brightly colored Navajo First Nation printed cloths (Downs, 1975). More than 100 guests were invited and among them included cabinet members from the Ford Administration and other dignitaries. Entertainment was provided by the African-American singer, Pearl Bailey and the Egyptian actor, Omar Sharif (Ford Library).\n\nFigure 1. Sadat State Dinner Invitation, Ford Presidential Library and Museum\n\nFigure 2: First Lady Betty Ford and Maria Downs\n\nThe Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library & Museum along with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) are the repositories for White House history. In the archives, one can find dinner invitations; dinner menus; guest lists; entertainment programs; photographs; seating charts, and a fact sheet outlining important diplomatic details about President and Mrs. Sadat. These archives also commemorate, preserve and celebrate a vast collection of significant events during each administration and state dinners are among the most opulent form of public and cultural diplomacy. So, what is the significance of state dinners and how are they the purveyors of the host’s power and prestige?\n\nState dinners are a grand tradition at the White House dating back to 1874 when President Ulysses S. Grant held the first one to honor King David Kalakaua of the Kingdom of Hawai’i (White House Historical). As diplomatic relations emerged with exponential importance following World War II, the White House implemented a range of elaborate protocols for these events. Working closely with the first lady, the White House social secretary helps to produce the guest list, invitations, menus, floral arrangements, entertainment and table arrangements (White House Historical). Previous state dinner honorees have included: King George, VI; the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev; and President Hu Jintao of China. Entertaining on this grand scale involves merging local and international ceremonial rules that are strictly adhered to for purposes of engendering respect and precedence. For example, it is a well-established tradition for the U.S. president to offer a toast to the honored guests. President Ford heralded the Sadat visit with this tribute:\n\n\"I think this opportunity for you to be here and to travel is unique in that they find in you a leader in the Middle East who has not only had the statesmanship to strive for peace but the leadership to achieve and accomplish peace, and to broaden and to deepen it, not only on behalf of your people but all of the Arab people. (Ford Library).\"\n\nPresident Sadat also paid his respects by adding:\n\n\"While I propose a toast for President Ford, his charming wife, and for the friendship between the American and Egyptian peoples, I am sure that I am expressing sentiments which are genuinely reciprocated by President Ford, his assistants, and compatriots towards a country that is known for its fortitude, culture, and historical heritage. Ladies and gentlemen, I seize this opportunity and present to our dear friend, President Ford, our highest decoration. It is the Nile decoration. This is a sign of great respect to himself and to the whole American people. (Ford Library).\"\n\nFord and Sadat’s tributes communicate how world leaders foster cultural and public diplomacy over a meal. The ceremonial splendor of such gatherings is deeply embedded in geopolitical traditions. This means a shared meal has the capacity to strengthen successive diplomatic relationships. Today, the state dinner remains a ubiquitous gastronomic affair that attempts to identify and put on display the power of the host nation, while acknowledging the cultural and political traditions of their guest dignitaries.\n\nReferences"
