Johan Christian Fabricius was born in January 7, 1745. He is one of the founders of modern entomology. While his contribution to Opiliones is sparse, he did describe 3 important European species.

Notable contributions[]

Fabricius was a major entomologist. In Opiliones, he described some well-known species such as Mitopus morio (Fabricius, 1779), Megabunus diadema (Fabricius, 1779) and Nemastoma bimaculatum (Fabricius, 1775).
