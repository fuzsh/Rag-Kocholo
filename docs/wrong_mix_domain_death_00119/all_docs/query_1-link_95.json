He remains unrepentant as he is pursued in an attempt to bring him to justice, but when the statue of the dead man himself pays a visit, Don Giovanni gets his just reward.\n\nFULL SYNOPSIS\n\nACT I\n\nDon Giovanni, a Spanish nobleman, is renowned throughout Europe as a seducer of women. Leporello, his servant, reluctantly aids him by keeping watch. Giovanni attempts to leave the house of Donna Anna, his most recent conquest. When Anna’s father, the Commendatore, tries to stop him, Don Giovanni kills him. Anna tells her fiancé, Don Ottavio, that she was raped by an unknown man and they vow revenge on the murderer.\n\nLeporello’s attempts to persuade his master to reform are interrupted by Donna Elvira, a former mistress of Giovanni’s, who is looking for him. Giovanni escapes, leaving Leporello to explain the extent of his master’s womanizing.\n\nMasetto and his bride Zerlina are to be married at a peasant wedding, but Giovanni decides to seduce Zerlina. Elvira interrupts and foils Giovanni’s attempts. Unaware of Giovanni’s identity, Ottavio and Anna appeal to him for help in their pursuit of the murderer of Anna’s father.

Even at such a young age, it was evident that Mozart had sure instincts and a phenomenal capacity to assimilate everything taught to him. His gifts for sight-reading and improvisation aroused the interest of all who heard him. Even more amazing at his young age were his creative powers. He wrote minuets when he was five, a sonata when seven, a symphony when eight, and, at the suggestion of the Emperor of Austria, an opera, La finta semplice (The Simple Prince), when eleven.\n\nAt the age of six, he and his sister, Nannerl (four years his senior and a skilled harpsichordist), were taken by their father to the electoral court in Munich, where the young performers won the hearts of the royal family and were showered with gifts. The success of this venture encouraged their father to undertake others. For the next several years, he exhibited his children throughout Europe. In Paris, four of young Wolfgang’s violin sonatas were published. In London, his first symphonies were performed, and his artistry at the harpsichord amazed and pleased the Queen’s Music Master, Johann Christian Bach (the youngest son of Johann Sebastian Bach).\n\nMozart and his father embarked on an extended tour of Italy in 1770. In Rome, the fourteen-year-old boy gave a remarkable demonstration of his genius by writing down from memory the complete score of Gregorio Allegri’s Miserere after a single hearing. In Italy, as elsewhere, Mozart received numerous honours and tributes. He was commissioned to write an opera for Milan. The opera, Mitridate, was first performed on Boxing Day 1770 and was a resounding success.\n\nThe period between 1772 and 1777 was spent principally in Salzburg, under unhappy conditions. A new Archbishop, Hieronymous von Colloredo, had come to the Austrian city and failed to appreciate Mozart’s genius. The young man was treated as servants were, with imperious authority and personal abuse; the masterworks that Mozart created were ignored. A welcome avenue of escape finally came in 1777 when Mozart and his mother set off for Paris hoping to find some advantageous post; Leopold, denied a leave of absence by the Archbishop, had to remain behind. Unfortunately, his stay in Paris came to an abrupt end with the sudden death of Anna Maria Mozart. Mozart had to return to his drab existence in the Salzburg post which paid poorly and in which he suffered many indignities.\n\nIn January 1781, he was acclaimed for his new opera, Idomeneo. This was the first work which hinted at his developing powers as a composer for the stage. Mozart now knew that he could make his way elsewhere. The permanent break with the Archbishop of Salzburg came in 1782 when Mozart visited Vienna with the Archbishop’s entourage. Denied permission to appear at some benefit concerts, Mozart flew into a rage, denounced his employer, and was summarily dismissed. From then on Mozart resided in Vienna.\n\nThe composer did not have to wait long for recognition. The Emperor commissioned him to write a new opera for the court theatre, The Abduction from the Seraglio. The opera was premiered on July 16, 1782 and was a triumph.\n\nConfident of his future, Mozart married Constanze Weber on August 4, 1782. He expected a profitable post at court but, although the Emperor was lavish with praise and commissions, no position appeared. To earn a living, Mozart gave lessons, which brought in only meagre earnings. Frequently he was subjected to the humiliation of begging friends for loans but his frustrations and disappointments did not arrest the flow of his compositions. These included symphonies, concertos, and string quartets, as well as operas. A few in Vienna recognised the grandeur of this music. One was Joseph Haydn, then the most celebrated composer in Europe, who described Mozart as, “the greatest composer I know, either personally or by name.”\n\nA meeting with Lorenzo da Ponte (1749-1838) (who had recently been appointed poet of the Viennese court theatres) in 1785 resulted in three of Mozart’s greatest operas. The first was The Marriage of Figaro (1786). The opera was a success; so many arias and ensembles were encored that the length of the first performance was almost doubled. On October 29, 1787, their second opera, Don Giovanni was premiered and again was a triumph. People went wild over Mozart’s melodies. The last of these three collaborations was Così fan tutte, ossia La scuola degli amanti (Thus do they all, or The School for Lovers) (1790). It was considered a failure and only received ten performances before being dropped from repertory.\n\nThe year 1791, the last of Mozart’s life, brought no end to the composer’s continuing personal misfortunes. While he had finally been given a permanent post as court composer and chamber musician, he received such a small salary that it neither relieved him of his debts nor provided for necessities. Impoverished, sick in body and spirit, Mozart gave way to despair. Yet, his last year was a period of brilliant creation, yielding two operas and the Requiem (The Mass for the Dead in the Roman Catholic rites). Mozart died on December 5, 1791. Few friends accompanied the coffin to the burial place in the common grave allotted to paupers. The exact position was never marked.\n\nLIBRETTIST BIO\n\nLorenzo Da Ponte\n\nBorn in Ceneda, Republic of Venice on March 10, 1749;\n\ndied in New York on August 17, 1838\n\nA fascinating figure, Lorenzo Da Ponte was born into a Jewish family in Italy that converted to Catholicism when he was a teenager. Educated by the Church and given a strong grounding in languages, literature and poetry, he became a priest but preferred a playboy’s lifestyle to the ascetic attitude of the cloth. Spending his twenties in Venice, he carried on numerous love affairs and intrigues, and eventually got himself so scandalously entangled with a married woman that he was banished from Venice on charges of mala vita or “bad living.”\n\nHe found his way to Vienna in 1781, where he got himself appointed as the principal poet of the Italian opera company at the Burgtheater. (Though he had no experience writing librettos, Da Ponte had developed his raw poetic skills in Venice as one of the city’s improvisatori, lyricists who amused rich patrons by improvising rhyming verse to a musical accompaniment – basically an early version of freestyle rapping). Two years later he met Mozart in one of Vienna’s salons, and in due course the two began an artistic collaboration that would mark a high point in their respective careers.\n\nAs was his wont, Da Ponte was banished from Vienna by the 1790s (the political situation changed and he fell out of favour with the new ruler). He moved to London where he worked some years as a librettist for the King’s Theatre, was fired, took up several unsuccessful business ventures, went into debt, and, to avoid the consequences, immigrated to America. He lived out most of his life in New York, continuing his wonderfully eclectic career by running a grocery store, becoming the first professor of Italian literature at the recently-founded Columbia University, running a boarding school and a bookstore, and spearheading the construction of the first purpose-built opera house in the United States.\n\nCHORUS\n\nSopranos\n\nVirginia Hatfield\n\nLeanne Kaufman\n\nAlexandra Lennox\n\nEve Rachel McLeod\n\nMezzo-Sopranos\n\nSusan Black\n\nSandra Boyes\n\nErica Iris Huang\n\nRachel Miller\n\nTenors\n\nStephen Bell\n\nTaras Chmil\n\nDerrick Paul Miller\n\nDavid Walsh\n\nBasses/Baritones\n\nJesse Clark\n\nBruno Cormier\n\nJason Nedecky\n\nGene Wu\n\nREAD\n\nWATCH\n\nPre-Performance Chat with Amy Lane\n\nMeet the Cast\n\nSung in Italian with English SURTITLESTM\n\nCAST AND CREATIVE TEAMS\n\nConductor: Johannes Debus\n\nDirector: Kasper Holten\n\nAssociate Director: Amy Lane\n\nAssistant Director: Marilyn Gronsdal\n\nSet Designer: Es Devlin\n\nCostume Designer: Anja Vang Kragh\n\nLighting Designer: Bruno Poet\n\nRevival Lighting Designer: John Paul Percox\n\nProjections Designer: Luke Halls\n\nProjection Associate: Gareth Shelton Choreographer: Signe Fabricius\n\nRevival Movement Director: Anna-Marie Sullivan\n\nPrice Family Chorus Master: Sandra Horst\n\nStage Manager: Jenifer Kowal\n\nAssistant Stage Manager: Al Gadowsky\n\nAssistant Stage Manager: Mike Lewandowski\n\nApprentice Stage Manager: Caroline Nowacki\n\nFight and Intimacy Coordinator: Siobhan Richardson\n\nDon Giovanni: Gordon Bintner\n\nDonna Elvira: Anita Hartig, Charlotte Siegel (February 24) Donna Anna: Mané Galoyan\n\nLeporello: Paolo Bordogna\n\nDon Ottavio: Ben Bliss\n\nZerlina: Simone McIntosh\n\nMasetto: Joel Allison\n\nIl Commendatore: David Leigh\n\nWith the COC Orchestra and Chorus\n\nA co-production of Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; Gran Theatre del Liceu; The Israeli Opera; and Houston Grand Opera\n\nJohannes Debus is generously sponsored by George & Kathy Dembroski\n\nSandra Horst and the COC Chorus are generously underwritten by Tim & Frances Price\n\nGordon Bintner is generously sponsored by Janet Stubbs\n\nThe COC Orchestra is generously sponsored, in part, by W.

One was Joseph Haydn, then the most celebrated composer in Europe, who described Mozart as, “the greatest composer I know, either personally or by name.”\n\nA meeting with Lorenzo da Ponte (1749-1838) (who had recently been appointed poet of the Viennese court theatres) in 1785 resulted in three of Mozart’s greatest operas. The first was The Marriage of Figaro (1786). The opera was a success; so many arias and ensembles were encored that the length of the first performance was almost doubled. On October 29, 1787, their second opera, Don Giovanni was premiered and again was a triumph. People went wild over Mozart’s melodies. The last of these three collaborations was Così fan tutte, ossia La scuola degli amanti (Thus do they all, or The School for Lovers) (1790). It was considered a failure and only received ten performances before being dropped from repertory.\n\nThe year 1791, the last of Mozart’s life, brought no end to the composer’s continuing personal misfortunes. While he had finally been given a permanent post as court composer and chamber musician, he received such a small salary that it neither relieved him of his debts nor provided for necessities. Impoverished, sick in body and spirit, Mozart gave way to despair. Yet, his last year was a period of brilliant creation, yielding two operas and the Requiem (The Mass for the Dead in the Roman Catholic rites). Mozart died on December 5, 1791. Few friends accompanied the coffin to the burial place in the common grave allotted to paupers. The exact position was never marked.\n\nLorenzo Da Ponte\n\nBorn in Ceneda, Republic of Venice on March 10, 1749;\n\ndied in New York on August 17, 1838\n\nA fascinating figure, Lorenzo Da Ponte was born into a Jewish family in Italy that converted to Catholicism when he was a teenager. Educated by the Church and given a strong grounding in languages, literature and poetry, he became a priest but preferred a playboy’s lifestyle to the ascetic attitude of the cloth. Spending his twenties in Venice, he carried on numerous love affairs and intrigues, and eventually got himself so scandalously entangled with a married woman that he was banished from Venice on charges of mala vita or “bad living.”\n\nHe found his way to Vienna in 1781, where he got himself appointed as the principal poet of the Italian opera company at the Burgtheater. (Though he had no experience writing librettos, Da Ponte had developed his raw poetic skills in Venice as one of the city’s improvisatori, lyricists who amused rich patrons by improvising rhyming verse to a musical accompaniment – basically an early version of freestyle rapping). Two years later he met Mozart in one of Vienna’s salons, and in due course the two began an artistic collaboration that would mark a high point in their respective careers.\n\nAs was his wont, Da Ponte was banished from Vienna by the 1790s (the political situation changed and he fell out of favour with the new ruler). He moved to London where he worked some years as a librettist for the King’s Theatre, was fired, took up several unsuccessful business ventures, went into debt, and, to avoid the consequences, immigrated to America. He lived out most of his life in New York, continuing his wonderfully eclectic career by running a grocery store, becoming the first professor of Italian literature at the recently-founded Columbia University, running a boarding school and a bookstore, and spearheading the construction of the first purpose-built opera house in the United States.\n\nSopranos\n\nVirginia Hatfield\n\nLeanne Kaufman\n\nAlexandra Lennox\n\nEve Rachel McLeod\n\nMezzo-Sopranos\n\nSusan Black\n\nSandra Boyes\n\nErica Iris Huang\n\nRachel Miller\n\nTenors\n\nStephen Bell\n\nTaras Chmil\n\nDerrick Paul Miller\n\nDavid Walsh\n\nBasses/Baritones\n\nJesse Clark\n\nBruno Cormier\n\nJason Nedecky\n\nGene Wu\n\nCOC NEWS: 10 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT DON GIOVANNI\n\nCOC NEWS: THE MUSIC OF DON GIOVANNI\n\nPre-Performance Chat with Amy Lane\n\nMeet the Cast\n\n2023/2024 season creative: BT/A\n\nFour Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts capacity: 2,070\n\nTicket prices do not include service fees, $9 CAD\n\nDon Giovanni\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nFEBRUARY 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 17, AND 24, 2024\n\nFour Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts\n\nPerformance time is approximately three hours and 20 minutes, including one 20-minute intermission\n\nHOUSE PROGRAM\n\nPlease note: Don Giovanni features scenes with strobe-like effects.\n\nMozart's dark, twisted masterpiece is presented as you’ve never seen it before in this breathtaking production from Danish director Kaspar Holten.
