        "text": "After school, Jarman studied history and art history at King's College. In 1963 he began studying art in Pop Art London. In the general mood of optimism from the mid-1960s onward, he began to openly confront his homosexuality. Jarman took over the set design for Ken Russell on the films \"The Devils\" (1971) and \"Savage Messiah\" (1972). Then he began making experimental films himself - initially in Super 8 format. Jarman presented his first feature film in 1976 with \"Sebastiane\", an openly homosexual film adaptation of the life of the early Christian martyr Sebastian - in Latin! This was followed by \"Jubilee\" (1978), a sarcastic allusion to the crown jubilee of Elizabeth II the year before.\n\nJarman then turned to Shakespeare, which he filmed in the punk revue \"The Tempest\" (1979) and in the erotic-themed work \"The Angelic Conversation\" (1985). With \"Caravaggio\" (1986), Jarman approached the passions depicted in the Renaissance painter's paintings and which the director re-staged. At the end of 1986, Jarman learned of his HIV infection. The films \"The Last of England\" (1987) and \"War Requiem\" (1989) were made under the sign of the AIDS threat and the Falklands War, which deal with the themes of death and destruction. His films about the ambivalent historical figures of \"Edward II\" also deal with homosexual dramas. (1991) and \"Wittgenstein\" (1992). When Jarman slowly went blind, he made \"Blue\" in 1993, a film that only shows a blue screen and otherwise lives from its texts and sounds from the \"off\".\n\nMichael Whyte was born in Middlesbrough, Yorkshire. He grew up in Bradford and after leaving school he went to study film at The Royal College of Art, London. His graduation film, 'Billy', was shown at the Edinburgh and London Film Festivals 1972. Since then he went on to make documentaries of social and political subjects. His first documentary,'Scream Quietly or the Neighbours Will Hear', was the first documentary to show the effect of domestic violence. Set inside Chiswick Womens' Aid, a refuge for battered wives, it let the women speak for themselves about their lives with violent partners. One of his later documentaries, 'Creggan', detailed life in the catholic Creggan Estate in Derry, Northern Ireland. This documentary was banned by the IBA for over a year; when it finally was transmitted it was highly acclaimed and won the prestigious Prix Italia, for best documentary, 1980. Michael Whyte turned to directing drama in 1985 winning various awards for his films, such as Catherine, a story of a girl who died of anorexia, (The Special Jury Award, San Francisco Film Festival, 1987, and the Prix Europa Award 1987.) As well as directing, he also writes screenplays and has had an exhibition of his photographs.\n\nSally Potter made her first 8mm film aged fourteen. She has since written and directed seven feature films, as well as many short films (including THRILLER and PLAY) and a television series, and has directed opera (Carmen for the ENO in 2007) and other live work. Her background is in choreography, music, performance art and experimental film. ORLANDO (1992), Sally Potter's bold adaptation of Virginia Woolf's classic novel, first brought her work to a wider audience. It was followed by THE TANGO LESSON (1996), THE MAN WHO CRIED (2000), YES (2004), RAGE (2009) and GINGER & ROSA (2012).\n\nSally Potter is known for innovative form and risk-taking subject matter and has worked with many of the most notable cinema actors of our time. Sally Potter's films have won over forty international awards and received both Academy Award and BAFTA nominations. She has had full career retrospectives of her film and video work at the BFI Southbank, London, MoMA, New York, and the Cinematheque, Madrid. She was awarded an OBE in 2012. Her book Naked Cinema - Working with Actors was published by Faber & Faber in March, 2014. Sally Potter co-founded her production company Adventure Pictures with producer Christopher Sheppard.\n\nSusan trained in painting at Syracuse University, completed a BFA in Film and Television at NYU Film School and after a stint making documentaries for The Smithsonian Institute, she relocated to Los Angeles to join the faculty of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts/West as an acting teacher and director. She directed numerous critically acclaimed theatrical productions in LA, including the world premiere of John Cassavetes \"East/West Game\" with Nick Cassavetes and Sandy Martin.\n\nConcurrent to her theatre career, she joined the newly formed Triad Artists Agency, where she had the vision to create an entirely new division. By signing Daniel Day-Lewis, Colin Firth, John Hurt, Joanne Whalley, Ian Holm and Juliette Binoche, European talent who had never had American representation before, she turned an underachieving and small enterprise into a high profile, high profit center for Triad Artists. Likewise, she was a dynamic leader of the burgeoning independent film movement, packaging clients Danny Glover in Zorniger Schlaf (1990), Ed Harris in -Walker (1987)_ Norma Aleandro in _Gaby, A True Story (1987)_, Gregory Peck in Old Gringo (1989), Daniel Day-Lewis in Eversmile (1989) and Colin Firth in Apartment Zero (1988) Her American roster included Jennifer Jason Leigh, Amy Madigan, Patrick Swayze, Linda Hunt, Wallace Shawn, Bradley Whitford, among others.\n\nWith a passion to pursue her long standing goal of directing feature films, Susan left Triad to develop Louise J. Kaplan's \"Female Perversions\" as an independent film. As director of Female Perversions (1996) Susan again made a bold move when she cast Tilda Swinton in her first American role. The film premiered at Sundance in'96 in the dramatic competition, followed by openings in Europe, Asia, Australia and America. It received the audience award for best film at Creteil, the highly prestigious women's film festival in Paris.\n\nSusan also wrote and directed a short erotic film for the German Arts station WDR, The Summer of My Deflowering (2000) with Beth Riesgraf. The film bowed at the Erotic Film Festival at MOMA in NYC.\n\nSusan's latest writing/directing effort, Golf in the Kingdom (2010) was adapted from Michael Murphy's best selling golf novel of all time. With David O'Hara, Mason Gamble and Malcolm McDowell, the film premiered at the AMC in Time's Square, NYC.\n\nOften mistaken for an American because of his skill at imitating accents, actor Tim Roth was born Timothy Simon Roth on May 14, 1961 in Lambeth, London, England. His mother, Ann, was a teacher and landscape painter. His father, Ernie, was a journalist who had changed the family name from \"Smith\" to \"Roth\"; Ernie was born in Brooklyn, New York, to an immigrant family of Irish ancestry.\n\nTim grew up in Dulwich, a middle-class area in the south of London. He demonstrated his talent for picking up accents at an early age when he attended school in Brixton, where he faced persecution from classmates for his comfortable background and quickly perfected a cockney accent to blend in. He attended Camberwell Art College and studied sculpture before he dropped out and pursued acting.\n\nThe blonde actor's first big break was the British TV movie Made in Britain (1983). Roth made a huge splash in that film as a young skinhead named Trevor. He next worked with director Mike Leigh on Meantime (1983), which he has counted among his favorite projects. He debuted on the big screen when he filled in for Joe Strummer in the Stephen Frears neo-noir The Hit - Die Profi-Killer (1984). Roth gained more attention for his turn as Vincent Van Gogh in Vincent und Theo (1990) and his work opposite Gary Oldman in Rosenkranz & Güldenstern (1990).\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles in search of work and caught the eye of young director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino had envisioned Roth as a possible Mr. Blonde or Mr. Pink in his heist flick Reservoir Dogs - Wilde Hunde (1992), but Roth campaigned for the role of Mr. Orange instead, and ultimately won the part. It proved to be a huge breakthrough for Roth, as audiences found it difficult to forget his performance as a member of a group of jewelry store robbers who is slowly bleeding to death. Tarantino cast Roth again in the landmark film Pulp Fiction (1994). Roth and actress Amanda Plummer played a pair of robbers who hold up a restaurant. 1995 saw the third of Roth's collaborations with Tarantino, a surprisingly slapstick performance in the anthology film Silvester in fremden Betten (1995). That same year Roth picked up an Academy Award nomination for his campy turn as a villain in the period piece Rob Roy (1995).\n\nContinuing to take on disparate roles, Roth did his own singing (with an American accent to boot) in the lightweight Woody Allen musical Alle sagen: I love you (1996). He starred opposite Tupac Shakur in Shakur's last film, the twisted comedy Gridlock'd - Voll drauf! (1997). The pair received positive critical notices for their comic chemistry. Standing in contrast to the criminals and baddies that crowd his CV, Roth's work as the innocent, seafaring pianist in the Giuseppe Tornatore film Die Legende vom Ozeanpianisten (1998) became something of a fan favorite. Grittier fare followed when Roth made his directorial debut with War Zone (1999), a frank, critically acclaimed drama about a family torn apart by incest. He made his next high-profile appearance as an actor as General Thade, an evil simian in the Tim Burton remake of Planet der Affen (2001). Roth was, of course, all but unrecognizable in his primate make-up.\n\nRoth has continued to enjoy a mix of art house and mainstream work, including everything from the lead role in Francis Ford Coppola's esoteric Jugend ohne Jugend (2007) to becoming \"The Abomination\" in the special effects-heavy blockbuster Der unglaubliche Hulk (2008). Roth took his first major American television role when he signed on to the Fox-TV series Lie to Me (2009)"
