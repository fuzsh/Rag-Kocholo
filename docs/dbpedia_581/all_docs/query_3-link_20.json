He is active across performance genres, from original theatre productions to stagings of existing theatre and opera texts, to circus, ballet, film, and large-scale video installation. His creativity is at the centre of a small conglomeration of organisations in his native Québec City, which include Ex Machina, a not-for-profit production company; Robert Lepage Incorporated, a private organisation which manages Lepage’s work for hire; and Le Diamant, a production complex opened in 2019 where Lepage will develop and present his work alongside visiting Québécois, Canadian, and international productions (Le Diamant replaces La Caserne Dalhousie, which was Ex Machina’s headquarters from 1997 to 2019). Even before the mid-1990s, when Ex Machina was founded, Lepage productions were headline events in the locations where they have played, from London’s Barbican Centre to the Théâtre National de Chaillot in Paris to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In the media and critical discourses around his work, Lepage is celebrated as a star talent whose gifts reside in his capacity to bring together bodies, media, and objects on stage to tell stories in visually ravishing, complex ways that have a strong effect on viewers. His directorial signature is recognised as consistent across the variety of genres in which he works, and central to their value. His success is significant not just for him and the companies who produce his work, but for his stateless nation: his achievements are frequently held up in official discourses as evidence of the vitality of Québec itself. His has always been an autobiographically driven practice, in that his preoccupations and experiences serve as direct inspiration for his original shows and also tend to drive his choice of existing and canonical works. In particular, autobiography drives his solo productions, which treat the relationship between his personal and creative identities and, taken together, present themselves as a narrative of his ongoing struggles to navigate the boundaries between the individual and the professional.\n\nThis series of opening statements is intended to establish some parameters of discussion about the subject of this book, but just as quickly I suggest another central premise: that Lepage is notable for his elusiveness and ambivalence about his work, about his own place in that work (personally and creatively), and about his role as a leading figure in global and Québécois arts. While discussing many other of his creative outputs, this book focuses on what I classify as his early- and mid-career original theatre productions – early being from the mid-1980s through the foundation of Ex Machina in 1994, and mid-career from 1994 to 2008. During this time he resisted taking full credit for this work, representing it both as the product of collaboration and, frequently, as the outcome of creative processes that have a life of their own. During this time the autobiographical nature of the work was also somewhat veiled, often through the use of characters that stood in for Lepage but did not exactly match him. As I will go on to explore, he skilfully uses such intimation of autobiography as a means of simultaneous self-revelation and self-concealment. On a corporate level, while Lepage is at the centre of all his enterprises, his signature is not consistently foregrounded as their defining and uniting quality: Ex Machina describes itself as a ‘multidisciplinary company bringing together’ a wide variety of creative and technical artists (‘Ex Machina’), while Le Diamant is a ‘venue for touring and multidisciplinary creation’ (Le Diamant ‘A Propos de notre mission’).i In interviews Lepage resists the classification of genius that is often suggested to describe him, arguing for example to Stéphan Bureau that he lacks the quality of ‘reflexivity’ and the ability to ‘create connections between everything and to find ideas’ that he believes defines a genius, describing himself rather as someone who ‘is listening’ (125–6; see also Charest 69–73).ii Lepage describes Le Diamant and La Caserne as sites of refuge, where he can create work on his own terms and ‘put down [his] suitcases’ in the midst of relentless travelling (Le Diamant ‘Mot de Robert Lepage’; see also Caux and Gilbert 18).iii\n\nThis resistance to being classified is such a consistent position on Lepage’s part that it has become definitional. This is a paradoxical stance – defining oneself by avoiding definition – and it is thus not surprising that paradox is a key term in discussions of Lepage’s work, as I will go on to explore. I believe that Lepage has cultivated such paradoxical identifications to allow himself to continue to work as a creative artist on his own terms. Resisting definition, eluding the capture of binary positions, and moving restlessly between home ground (Québec) and multiple international locations is a professional/personal strategy which has enabled the growth and perpetuation of his career. Such a position is also ‘fundamental’ to Ex Machina’s approach to creativity, he underlines in Creating for the Stage, a book about the company’s work: ‘It was by refusing frameworks that we established our approach’ (Caux and Gilbert 27). The success of these strategies is evident in the striking lack of journalistic and scholarly consensus about Lepage’s work, and the disconnected nature of Lepage scholarship. While some assert that Lepage is a unique talent – to the extent, for some commentators, that his work exists outside of classification and context – others call him an imitator and a populariser. He is described both as a banner example of a transnational artist, making work which draws from and mediates between cultures, and as someone whose work cannot be understood outside of the context of Québec. For some, his resistance to being pinned down is the laudable centre of his creativity, while for others it represents an abnegation of responsibility. Methodological approaches to his stage work vary widely. Some studies focus on his approach to creating work as a director and collaborator,¹ and a subset of this work focuses on the intermedial aspects of his creativity.² Other scholars explore the relationship of his work to the Québec context,³ or liken his work to translation.⁴ A further area of Lepage studies explores questions of authorship, representation, and responsibility.⁵\n\nThis book draws from many areas of this scattered terrain: the work of all these scholars has helped me to identify the themes and problematics that are the central vectors of my engagement. A central principle of my approach is to join together the exploration of the effects of Lepage’s work with discussion of the methods by which that work is made. Another element shaping my approach has been Lepage’s own assertions about his creativity and working methods, evidence which invites consideration as well as critical distance. While he is resistant to being defined or contained, Lepage has been clear and consistent in statements about a central objective for his work, which is to keep theatre relevant and available to audiences whose sensibilities are being shaped by recorded and digital media. As he writes in the Foreword to Creating for the Stage:\n\nThe influence of film and television and the new dramaturgical possibilities offered by multimedia have turned narrative conventions upside down, opening the way to new forms of expression and new languages of staging that have only barely been explored. It is thus not simply the content and form of theatre that are being called into question by Ex Machina, but also the role that theatre will play in the new exchange of ideas in the twenty-first century. (7)\n\nHis project, as Lepage describes it, is an ongoing experiment in the creation of live performance that engages with new technologies, and with the ways in which these technologies are changing human perception and experience. Another key principle for Lepage is that he focuses more on the process of making theatre than on the signification that results. Terminology used by David Saltz in his phenomenological analysis of theatrical narrative is useful in articulating this approach. Saltz argues that, contrary to conventional understandings, theatre creates more than one fiction; theatre’s meaning resides in more than the narrative spectators understand to have been enacted on stage, and in more than any message spectators might take away. What happens live on stage – the action, the real-life event – is the ‘infiction’ in Saltz’s formulation; infictions are ‘prescriptions to imagine’. The outfiction is the ‘narrative content that we extract from the performance event’ (214). For Lepage, the infiction has always been more important than the outfiction. When he talks about how he makes his performances, the discussion focuses on playing, creativity, and lack of structure. He is very attuned to reception – to audiences’ participatory role in the theatre event – but resists identifying any message that his work might convey: ‘There’s no moral’, he said in an important 1994 interview. ‘It’s just putting people into a bath of sensations and ideas and emotions. And then they come out of it and do what they want with it’ (Bunzli, ‘Geography’ 97). The interest for him is not the ideas or facts that an audience member might take away from his productions, but the creation of performances that crystallise and reflect back the particular way in which contemporary spectators experience the world. There are limitations to this approach: the danger of universalising statements about the place of technology in human experience, given inequities of access (the so-called Digital Divide); the totality of Lepage’s abnegation of control over signification (surely what he puts into his baths of sensation, ideas, and emotions has an effect on what audiences take out of them?); and, following on from the previous point, the relationship of the subject matter and themes of his performances to their real-world contexts – that is, questions of cultural ownership and appropriation. But, by identifying a focus on infiction, on spectatorship, and on the emulation of a contemporary, mediatised experience of navigating the world we come closer to an articulation of Lepage’s terms of engagement and of the goals of his ongoing creative project. A final, key element is affect. Lepage’s is a practice that foregrounds phenomenological effects over semiotic meanings: people go to the theatre ‘to feel’, he has said (qtd in Winters).\n\nThe ambivalence of the scholarship on Lepage – the extent to which scholars have struggled to classify his approach – is evident in the level of debate about whether his work is modern or postmodern, original or derivative. Duška Radosavljević characterises Lepage as a populariser, in the vein of Max Reinhardt, and paints this in a positive light: ‘a theatrical and cinematic visionary whose work was a continuation of the previously established traditions, but hugely inspirational in its spectacular effect and entirely refreshing as part of the theatrical mainstream’ (Theatre-Making 9). Greg Giesekam argues, in a more critical vein, that Lepage’s strategies to incorporate recorded media into his work ‘have been anticipated in the work of other practitioners’ and that ‘there is little sense of the sustained exploration of the broader implications of using film or video on the stage found in their work’ (244). For Steve Dixon, while Lepage’s work is ‘stylistically postmodern and eclectic’, it is firmly linked to ‘the avant-garde and the modernists of the past’ through ‘his pioneering technological aesthetics, his formalist experiments with time and space, and his existential and spiritual concerns’, as well as by ‘drawing upon myths and grand narratives’ (514). Dixon thus proposes Lepage as a bridging figure creating works that, while they might reflect the surface-level heterogeneity of postmodern cultural expression, are underlain by a modernist quest to make sense of and ground himself within his immediate experience and broader life-world, and by a desire to ‘re-ignite theatre for a new generation of audiences’ (ibid.).\n\nThis conception of Lepage as a figure hovering between modern and postmodern – between the attempt to ‘expose the truth or reality underneath representation’ and the employment of ‘representation about representation … quotation as montage’ (Schneider 293, emphasis in original) – is a productive one that at once recognises Lepage’s indeterminacy but does not allow him to slip out of discursive sight. It’s something that Andy Lavender is getting at in his description of Lepage’s investment in ‘a pervasive sense of the truth of change’ (148), as is Izabella Pluta’s identification of a ‘Lepagean aesthetic of movement’ that is ‘based on transformation, a key process in his work’ (192, emphases in original). Marvin Carlson and Janelle Reinelt identify the openness of Lepage’s work to multiple interpretations and points of entry as one of its defining and positive traits, in that his productions present meaning as contingent and promote reflexive awareness among spectators of their own ability to change their lives and the world around them (189–90). In his discussion of Lepage’s 1995 film Le Confessional, Bill Marshall describes Lothaire Bluteau’s performance as the central character Pierre as ‘combin[ing] passivity and transformation: he is not a political actor … but one who sees and changes’ (310) – a description that could as easily describe Lepage as Pierre. For the theatre critic Robert Lévesque, one of Lepage’s earliest and most acute commentators, the incapacity to pin down Lepage’s project registers as frustration:\n\nIt’s hard to talk about an artist whose shows are so famous and whose name is synonymous with success … Circulations, Vinci, The Dragon’s Trilogy, Needles and Opium are good shows, but I wonder as I follow him, seeing since Tectonic Plates these frescos that last for hours, this ‘work in progress’ approach that he abuses: What does he mean, what is he telling us, what is this world that he shakes up like an air traffic controller? (Liberté 59)iv\n\nWhat is Lepage trying to say? Is the best response to this what Lavender, Pluta, Carlson and Reinelt, and Marshall suggest: that Lepage’s subject matter is the pervasiveness of change and the potential of transformation, to which he is an observer and a participant, evoking these phenomena in his work while not necessarily offering a comment on them? I believe this is a productive place to start, and I add to these observations that what Lepage communicates through his stage productions functions as much on the level of affect as it does through semiotic signification. As his statement above to Winters suggests, his signature does not work entirely on the level of the intellectual and thematic, and it is for this reason that he has been periodically discredited as being more preoccupied with scenography and stage trickery than ideas and arguments (see Billington ‘Megaton’, ‘Lipsynch’, ‘Blue Dragon’; Lévesque, ‘Trucs pour jouer’; Nightingale, ‘Threads’). His prioritisation of affect and his insistence on seeing theatrical production as a form of play also contributes to his being perennially infantilised by commentators, as with the characterisation of him as a wunderkind well into his forties and fifties (see CBC Arts; Waugh 453). Beyond asking, as Lévesque does, what the work is about, I believe we need to ask how it works – and what this combination of method and subject matter communicates about Lepage’s perspective, and about the way many of us live now.\n\nIt is the contention of this book that Lepage’s central, ongoing contribution to contemporary performance practices is his creation of productions that reflect spectators’ privileged experiences of navigating contemporary globalisation. A further contention is that these productions reflect Lepage’s own experience and render him a paradigmatic figure in the contemporary, globalised performing arts. I go on to further explore the concept and processes of globalisation in the following chapter, and as a working definition offer that of Malcolm Waters: globalisation is ‘a social process in which the constraints of geography on economic, political, social, and cultural arrangements recede, in which people become increasingly aware that they are receding and in which people act accordingly’ (5). Globalisation is a complex and much-debated phenomenon that is far from ideologically neutral. It is all about the breaking of boundaries – the circulation of goods, capital (in all its forms), bodies, ideas, and feelings around the world both literally and virtually at speeds unprecedented in human history. It is celebrated as a set of processes that are rendering the world and its communities more interconnected, creating a greater awareness of this connectedness, and offering unprecedented opportunities for contact with cultures and experiences other than one’s own. While bringing new experiences, wealth, and pleasures to some, however, the benefits of globalisation are not shared equally; globalisation has reified divisions of class, status, and power among the world’s populations. The increased movement of resources, ideas, and bodies under the conditions of globalisation is raising complex questions about responsibilities, affiliations, and ownership. Globalisation is having a profound effect on many creative practices, including theatre: it enables travel, contact, and exchange that reshapes understandings of differences and similarities between cultures and individuals; allows artists access to new stimuli and source material; and broadens the expectations and experiences of audiences. Again, however, such benefits are not available to all; they are an élite cadre of artists whose work circulates in the international network of festivals and venues which globalisation has fostered. The processes of globalisation are raising new challenges for theatre artists as they attempt to navigate questions of representation, intellectual and creative property, responsibility to others, intermediality, and embodiment through their practices. The question of how to maintain creative autonomy and the capacity for social and political critique has become a pressing concern for artists working within the arguably totalising conditions of global neoliberal capital.\n\nBorn in 1957, Lepage came of age in an era in which the flows of globalisation were increasingly affecting human experience and perceptions. All aspects of his career and creative practice have been shaped by globalisation: it is a primary life-world for him. The conditions of globalisation determine his lived reality, and the circumstances of his creativity and productivity frequently appear in his productions as subject matter and theme, and shape his formal approach. We see this reflected in his work in its consistent representation of travel and the experience of being between places, and in the repeated image of him suspended in mid-air on book covers and in promotional images (figure 0.1). This emphasis on motion and the state of betweenness is also reflected in his foregrounding of the process of making work as intrinsic to – perhaps even definitional of – its meanings. My goal here is to articulate globalisation not just as a complex and evolving set of processes but also as an affect, one that live performance has a particular capacity to produce. Lepage produces this affect by transposing cinematic techniques to live performance contexts, giving spectators the sensation of what John Tomlinson has named ‘the paradigmatic experience of global modernity for most people … staying in one place but experiencing the dis-placement that global modernity brings to [us]’ (Globalisation and Culture 9, emphasis in original). Viewing Lepage’s productions, at their most accomplished, offers this travelling-without-moving affect – the impression of space contracting and a familiar relationship between space and time being destabilised. He creates these effects by imbuing bodies and objects on stage with multiple significations which converge at key points: spectators experience a pleasing rush of sensations as they are challenged to hold onto and make sense of this profusion of signification. Making meaning of such moments feels meaningful, in the sense of being affectively rich (I go on in the chapters that follow to further parse this dual sense of ‘meaning’). Again, Lepage’s focus is the production of this affect by inviting engagement with the complexity of what is on stage, far more than with the significations that result from this engagement. I call this technique spatial montage, a terminology I explore in Chapters 3 and 4, which treat Lepage’s transposition of cinematic techniques to the stage. Other scholars have drawn attention to this technique: James Reynolds, for example, calls it ‘semiotic condensation’ – moments on stage when an ‘accumulation of meanings reaches saturation point’ and ‘becomes overwhelming and affective’ (Revolutions 93). My argument, building on this, is that this sense of wonder stems from the chain of connections between what viewers see, the affect that comes from processing this, and their experiences of contemporary life, in which perceptions of the relationship between space and time are frequently destabilised and re-aligned.\n\n0.1 Robert Lepage in Needles and Opium (original version).\n\nThese conceptualisations of semiotic condensation and spatial montage build on and advance the key concept of décalage offered by James Bunzli in a 1999 article analysing Lepage’s creative practice.⁶ Drawing on Jeanne Bovet’s earlier use of the term to explore Lepage’s work, Bunzli defines décalage (French for ‘gap’ and part of the phrase ‘décalage horaire’, or jet lag) as ‘a concept that combines autobiography, coincidence, and paradox, and the performance moment’ (‘Geography’ 84). The term resonates with Lepage’s identity as a globetrotter: in order to maintain multiple international contracts, he travels very frequently and consistently navigates spatial and temporal displacement. Indeed, as Bunzli argues, part of the defining quality of Lepage’s work is how it evokes such displacement in subject matter, form, and affect.\n\nFor Robert Lepage, décalage is the main impulse, the principle [sic] mode of working, and a major result of his productions, both onstage and in the audience. It is an acknowledgment of gaps, indeterminacies; it is a way of working that trades on impulse, intuition, and broad creative freedom; it results in a theatre of simultaneity and juxtaposition in which actor, image, ‘text’, and audience are brought into a dialogue, a questioning, and an active co-constitutive role. (89)\n\nBunzli represents Lepage’s career as an ongoing attempt to establish and maintain working conditions in which he can enjoy ‘the freedom to work in whatever way he sees fit’ (82). A central element of this way of working, which Lepage borrowed from formative years working with the Québec-based Théâtre Repère, is resistance to the concept of creative work ever being complete – the suggestion that ‘process is product’ (89, emphasis in original). The ‘paradox and simultaneity’ inherent in such an asserted equivalence ‘are key engines in the practice of décalage’, Bunzli argues (ibid.). Bunzli traces the first appearance of the concept of décalage to Lepage’s early solo production Vinci, in which a character names things about Leonardo da Vinci that cause a ‘strange feeling of décalage’, including the fact that Leonardo ‘could not bear … human suffering, and yet he invented war machines’ (qtd in Bunzli 84). Other perceived paradoxes have been jumping-off points for Lepage’s work: The Seven Streams of the River Ota grew out of his perception of contemporary Hiroshima as being full of sensuality, which was unexpected, given its associations with mass destruction (see MacAlpine 136); and The Blue Dragon is set in ‘the effervescent paradox that is modern China’ (Ex Machina ‘The Blue Dragon’). The concept of paradox is clearly a key mode of thought for Lepage that allows him to keep multiple possibilities of meaning and relationship in play; it promotes complexity.\n\nSuch an account prompts questions, however, about representational, authorial, and corporate responsibility: pushed beyond its breaking point, a paradox becomes a contradiction. It is possible to argue that da Vinci’s creation of war machines contradicted his otherwise pacifist ethics, and to use this as a basis to explore the question of whether the artist has an ethical responsibility towards the ways in which their creations are put to use. River Ota’s focus on paradox, in the view of critic Paul Taylor, resulted in a piece which offered ‘a dream world that cannot be contradicted rather than an argument that can’ and which raised ‘alarming’ questions about Lepage’s apparent lack of misgiving about making art out of atrocity (‘Paradox’). Among the aspects of contemporary Chinese society that feature in The Blue Dragon are women’s reproductive rights, the rapid transformation of the country’s urban centres in preparation for global events such as the Beijing Olympics, marketisation, and art-forgery rings. While Melissa Poll finds the production’s representation of China ‘nuanced’ (Scenographic 159), critic Peter Crawley argues that, by offering up various phenomena as evidence of the paradoxicality of today’s China without exploring them in depth, The Blue Dragon ‘reduce[s] China to reassuring preconceptions’.\n\nAnd what of these gaps and indeterminacies that Lepage acknowledges through his way of working: does he skip over them, or examine what contents and meaning may already be located there? Gaps are not necessarily entirely empty; the indeterminate may not always remain so. Valorising incompletion, keeping things in motion, and committing to freedom above all else are also arguably strategies that allow Lepage to avoid acknowledging relationships to material, to collaborators, and to systems of identification and classification in which he is inevitably implicated. He frequently describes his productions as emerging independently and on their own terms: ‘we often have the feeling,’ he says in Creating for the Stage, ‘that the play in its final form exists even before we begin to work’ (Caux and Gilbert 31; see also 47, 51). Jen Harvie is critical of what she characterises as the ersatz postmodernism of Lepage’s works which ‘trivialise cultural specificity, both geographical and historical … indulge the vague and nostalgic instead of documenting and interrogating the historically specific; and … prioritise pleasure at the expense of achieving critique, deconstructive or otherwise’ (‘Robert Lepage’ 229). In Ric Knowles’s view, Lepage’s foregrounding of process and audience response ‘can tend simply to displace [Ex Machina]’s creative responsibilities for meaning production onto audiences with something resembling the familiar modernist shrug: my name is Robert Lepage, and I don’t know what it’s about’ (Reading 44).\n\nHowever seductive the assertion that process and product have the same value, this commitment to ‘relentless indeterminacy’ (Bunzli, ‘Geography’ 84) has also had significant material implications for producers, festival directors, and spectators, particularly in Lepage’s mid-career period. Creating productions as they toured internationally over the span of many years sometimes resulted in early performances that were chaotic, messy, and incoherent. As I explore in Chapter 5, Lepage and Ex Machina’s argument that this is a necessary part of the process and that audience feedback helps them understand and grow the work was hard to square with the prestige berths in international festivals in which these performances were presented, and the high ticket prices that came with this. Agreeing with Bunzli, then, that a defining aspect of Lepage’s career has been the pursuit of conditions in which he can work on his own terms, the chapters that follow explore his ongoing efforts to do so, keeping in play the innovations in creative and production strategies that have resulted, as well as the ways in which Lepage’s insistence on freedom affects those he works with and those who view his productions. While focused on Lepage, and specifically on his early- and mid-career original productions, this study treats themes and problematics that resonate with those of other artists and companies working today in the field of globalised performing arts: the relationship of globalisation to personal and national identities; the role of authorial signature in collaborative work; how artists reflect technological evolution and changes in human perception through their work; and the relationship between creativity and commodity under the conditions of neoliberal capital. By exploring these themes I intend to open up understanding of the ways in which globalisation is affecting early twenty-first-century theatrical practices and industries more broadly, while identifying those aspects of his practice and experience that are particular to Lepage."
