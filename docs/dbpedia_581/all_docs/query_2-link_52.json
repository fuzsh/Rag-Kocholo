        "text": "Lepage and his company, Ex Machina, are there to create such miracles, he declares. \"We use everything - inspiration, objects, sounds, machines - everything that is to hand to create miracles,\" he says from his home in Quebec.\n\n\"A puppet, for example, is just a piece of wood, a couple of rivets, but put them together, and if you know how to do it, and the audience's imagination joins in with this, then a miracle will come out of that machine. That is what we and the audience do in the theatre - we create miracles in that space.\"\n\nSydney audiences first encountered one of Lepage's miracles in 1994, when he performed his one-man show, Needles and Opium, to a rapturous standing ovation at that year's Sydney Festival; only to have the audience leap to their feet again on his return in 2001 with another of his extraordinary solo performances, The Far Side of the Moon.\n\nOther states, too, are well versed in the language of Lepage's highly metaphoric theatrescapes: two of his greatest works - the five-hour The Dragon's Trilogy, performed at the 1988 Adelaide Festival, and the luminous, seven-hour The Seven Streams of Ota, which was presented at both Perth and Adelaide festivals 10 years later - were given an overwhelming reception at both festivals, no matter their length.\n\nNow Lepage is returning to Sydney with his latest one-man show, The Andersen Project - which, once again, has received international acclaim, and which will open the Sydney Festival.\n\nThe show is based on an episode in the life of Hans Christian Andersen, shortly after his visit to the World Fair in Paris in 1867. Andersen was overcome by the fair's splendours, the whiff of modernity that accompanied it and the accompanying whiff of mortality he felt fall upon him at the same time. He lived only another eight years.\n\nWhat was it about this 19th-century storyteller that stirred Lepage's imagination for him to create another one-man show around him?\n\nNothing, Lepage says. Five years ago, the organising committee of the huge Andersen Jubilee being planned in Denmark to mark the bicentenary this year of Andersen's birth (he was born in 1805 in Odense) invited Lepage to take part in the festival with one of his performance works. It specifically asked for one of his solo works.\n\n\"I said no,\" Lepage says. \"I could not see any connection between the life of Andersen and my own. But they kept asking. And I kept trying to find some connection but I couldn't. Unless I found that connection I could not do the work.\"\n\nAnd then Lepage discovered a biography of Andersen unlike all the others he had read, Jackie Wullschlager's Hans Christian Andersen: The Life of a Storyteller (2001), which drew upon Andersen's diaries and which explored his ambiguous sexuality - the terrible, aching loneliness of the man beneath the social surface, his hidden sensuality, his sense of isolation and separateness from his fellows.\n\n\"And I suddenly knew there were doors and entrances I could go through to reach him,\" he says, \"places in him I could identify with.\n\n\"It was his loneliness. It was his incessant need to travel. It was his sense of isolation. He would mark with a cross in his diaries every time he masturbated. His blood was boiling over, his diaries are sulfurous in their eroticism. And masturbation is the loneliest act in the world.\n\n\"In real life, I am not a lonely person, I have lots of good friends and am active socially. But there are certain aspects of my life when I have felt very alone, utterly alone, and one of them is when I am performing on my own.\"\n\nLepage was born in 1957 in Quebec. At the age of six, he developed alopecia, and soon became bald. With his pale, hairless skin, he soon became the butt of his schoolmates' jokes.\n\nThroughout his painful adolescence, he began to experience panic attacks; his sense of isolation and difference grew, he was unsure of his sexuality: no wonder he felt an affinity with Andersen.\n\nThere was something, too, in Andersen's need to travel that finds its echo in Lepage's own life. Andersen travelled the whole of Europe, even to Africa, as if on a search for something, or as if he were running away from something in himself.\n\nLepage travels continuously, too, either to bump in new shows or check out the progress of his older productions, several of which are always on at the one time all around the world. \"I enjoy juggling four or five different projects in the air, and finding connections and disconnections between them,\" he has said of this incessant movement.\n\nIn his delving and digging around to find his \"connectedness\" with Andersen, Lepage came across a rarely anthologised fairytale, The Dryad, written by Andersen a year after he had returned from Paris, and inspired by his experiences there.\n\nIt is a strange, pre-Freudian tale, oozing with sensual yearning, about a tree-spirit's longing to be recast into the world in the form of a human body, complete with all its sensual proclivities. Her wish is granted, she enjoys the pleasures incarnate in Paris and she dies within the day.\n\nLepage knew he had found his deep structure; his Andersen project could now begin. He said yes to Denmark and The Andersen Project began its journey towards its audience in the theatre.\n\nHe gives his project two timelines: one into the future that ends with Andersen's death; the other is the journey of a French-Canadian writer who is working on a project about Andersen. As the writer traces Andersen's footsteps in Paris, he goes back in time - and there he discovers his own origins.\n\nCoincidence, for Lepage, is the mechanism that reveals the synchronicity of life.\n\nHe puts this principle to work in his theatre to create journeys through time for the audience to make.\n\n\"The audience joins in the performance through their imagination, and the coincidence of their presence there at that time and at that performance and at that moment. The show therefore continues to be written and rewritten each time we do it. Until we stop doing it,\" he says.\n\nAs the audience pieces together the images into a narrative that makes sense to them, so in a sense a Lepage miracle is never complete until the last audience sees it."
