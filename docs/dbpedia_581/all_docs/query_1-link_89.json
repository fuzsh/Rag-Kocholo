        "text": "Part of Palgrave's Approaches to Adaptation in Theatre and Performance series, this book theorizes auteur Robert Lepage’s scenography-based approach to adapting canonical texts. Lepage’s technique is defined here as ‘scenographic dramaturgy’, a process and product that de-privileges dramatic text and relies instead on evocative, visual performance and intercultural collaboration to re-envision extant plays and operas. Following a detailed analysis of Lepage’s adaptive process and its place in the continuum of scenic writing and auteur theatre, this book features four case studies charting the role of Lepage’s scenographic dramaturgy in re-‘writing’ extant texts, including Shakespeare’s Tempest on Huron-Wendat territory, Stravinsky’s Nightingale in a twenty-seven ton pool, and Wagner’s Ring cycle via the infamous, sixteen-million-dollar Metropolitan Opera production. The final case study offers the first interrogation of Lepage’s twenty-first century ‘auto-adaptations’ of his own seminal texts, The Dragons’ Trilogy and Needles & Opium. Though aimed at academic readers, this book will also appeal to practitioners given its focus on performance-making, adaptation and intercultural collaboration.\n\nObserving the phenomenon of cultural appropriation in a case of theatre: Kanata the controversial spectacle by the Québecois Robert Lepage raises issues of aesthetics. The specific cultural, political and social context, together with the singularity of theatre as an art form, makes this a unique case study shedding light on that phenomenon and causing us to rethink some long-standing principles of aesthetics.\n\nThe University of Plymouth welcomed over 200 delegates at this conference, which took place from 7-9 September 2009 in the Roland Levinsky Building. International Guests: Professor Susan Bennett (University of Calgary) and Professor Ric Knowles (University of Guelph) The conference included: - a performance by The FATHoM Project, choreographed by Adam Benjamin - a conference buffet & cruise on the Tamar River - a conference reception at Han's Oriental Restaurant - a film screening of Grotowski's The Constant Prince - an introduction to the University's Immersive Vision Theatre - pre-conference activities including a 'twalk' in Plymouth's historic Royal William Yard by Phil Smith (Wrights & Sites), a screening of Complicite's The Street of Crocodiles from the V&A Theatre Archive, and one-to-one performances by Sam Rose The TaPRA2009 Conference Organisers were: Roberta Mock, Lee Miller & Victor Ramirez Ladron de Guevara\n\nThis paper examines Indigenous-settler performance-making processes in Choctaw artist Randy Reinholz’s residential school adaptation of Measure for Measure, Off the Rails, at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, and City Opera Vancouver’s Missing, a chamber opera dedicated to British Columbia’s missing and murdered Indigenous women with libretto by Métis/Dene playwright Marie Clements. Based on my experience observing rehearsals for both productions and in conversation with the central Indigenous creators, I have analysed the ways in which performance-making processes can foster intercultural relationship-building, recognize and engage with the land upon which they occur, and initiate a company’s long-term commitment to Indigenous artists. This work theorizes how Indigenous resistance can be enacted, either dramaturgically or otherwise, from within Indigenous-settler performance-making processes. It also examines the ways in which privileged settler researchers, like myself, can responsibly engage with Indigenous research paradigms and epistemologies.\n\nSOZITA GOUDOUNA | USA On Scoring Elasticity: Elastic Imaging, Sonoelastography, Live Renderings | PAP The paper discusses methods of translating three-dimen- sional work into a two-dimensional format and the ways an elastic movement and sound score can define the future of architecture and our build environment by examining the project OUT SCORE, a live arts program and exhibition that takes place at the sculpted theatre of Aixoni (http://www. sculpted-architectural-landscapes.gr/project.php?id=22) and at ‘T’ Space (Steven Holl). OUT SCORE generates encounters between dance, performance and the visual arts, in relation to the complex notions of notation and score, and the ways scoring elasticity can be conceived in the second decade of the century. Sozita Goudouna is the author of Beckett’s Breath: Antitheatricality and the Visual Arts published by Edinburgh University Press and released in the US by Oxford University Press. She has taught at NYU, Roger Williams, and other universities and was selected as the inau- gural Andrew W. Mellon Foundation curator at Performa NY. She is currently Head of Operations at Raymond Pettibon Studio."
