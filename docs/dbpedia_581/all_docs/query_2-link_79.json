        "text": "Director (Canada)\n\nVersatile in every form of theatre craft, Robert Lepage is equally talented as a director, playwright, actor and film director. His creative and original approach to theatre has won him international acclaim and shaken the dogma of classical stage direction to its foundations, especially through his use of new technologies. Contemporary history is his source of inspiration, and his modern and unusual work transcends all boundaries.\n\nTraining\n\nRobert Lepage was born in Quebec in 1957. He took an early interest in geography, and when he later discovered all art forms, theatre caught his particular attention. He entered the Conservatoire d’art dramatique de Québec in 1975 at the age of 17. After a study period in Paris in 1978 he returned to Quebec and became involved in many creative projects, gaining experience as actor, author and director. Two years later he joined the Théâtre Repère.\n\nAn international recognition from the start\n\nIn 1984, his play Circulations toured Canada and received Best Canadian Production award at the Quinzaine Internationale de Théâtre de Québec. The next year The Dragons’ Trilogy gained him an international reputation, quickly followed by Vinci (1986), Polygraph (1987) and Tectonic Plates (1988). In 1988 he formed his own professional management company, Robert Lepage Inc. (RLI).\n\nFrom 1989 to 1993 he was Artistic Director of the Théâtre français at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. Meanwhile pursuing his own creative projects, he directed Needles and Opium (1991), Coriolanus, Macbeth, and The Tempest (1992). With A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 1992 he became the first North American to direct a Shakespeare play at the Royal National Theatre in London.\n\nEx Machina – a turning point\n\nA turning point in his career came with the founding of his multidisciplinary production company, Ex Machina, in 1994. Under his artistic direction, this new team produced a steady output of plays, beginning with The Seven Streams of the River Ota (1994), A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1995) and a solo production, Elsinore (1995).\n\nCinema\n\nIn 1994, he made his début in the world of cinema. He wrote and directed his first feature film, Le Confessional, which appeared the following year at the Cannes Festival Directors’ Fortnight. He went on to direct Polygraph in 1996, Nô in 1997, Possible Worlds in 2000 (his first feature film written in English), and finally, in 2003, a film adaptation of his play The Far Side of the Moon.\n\nLa Caserne\n\nLa Caserne, a multidisciplinary production centre in Quebec City, opened in 1997 under Robert Lepage’s leadership. In their new quarters he and his team created and produced Geometry of Miracles (1998), Zulu Time (1999), The Far Side of The Moon (2000), La Casa Azul (2001), a new version of The Dragons’ Trilogy with a new cast (2003) and The Busker’s Opera (2004). This was followed by The Andersen Project (2005), Lipsynch (2007), The Blue Dragon (2008) and Eonnagata (2009).\n\nPlaying Cards (2012) consist of four parts: SPADES, HEARTS, DIAMONDS, and CLUBS, each exploring a universe inspired by the asset the suit represents. SPADES premiered in Madrid in May 2012. HEARTS will premiere in Fall 2013 as well as a new staging of Needles and Opium.\n\nRocks shows, exhibits, circus and architectural projections\n\nRobert Lepage is often asked to turn his creative hand to new fields. In 1993, he directed Peter Gabriel’s Secret World Tour. He joined forces with Peter Gabriel again in 2002 to direct Growing Up Tour.\n\nIn 2000, he was involved in producing Métissages, an exhibition at the Musée de la civilisation in Quebec City.\n\nHe designed and directed Cirque du Soleil shows: KÀ (2005), a permanent show in Las Vegas, and TOTEM (2010), a show under Grand Chapiteau that will tour worldwide.\n\nFor Quebec City’s 400th anniversary in 2008, Robert Lepage and Ex Machina created the largest architectural projection ever achieved: The Image Mill™. In 2009, Aurora Borealis, a permanent lighting installation inspired by the colors of the northern lights was created on the same location.\n\nOpera\n\nRobert Lepage made a grand entrance in the opera world when he staged the successful double bill: Bluebeard’s Castle and Erwartung (1993). His presence on the operatic stage continued with La Damnation de Faust presented for the first time in the Saito Kinen Festival Matsumoto, Japan (1999), then at the Opera National de Paris and the Metropolitan Opera in New York.\n\nAmong his achievements in opera: 1984 based on the novel by George Orwell, with Maestro Lorin Maazel providing the musical direction (2005), The Rake’s Progress (2007) and The Nightingale and Other short Fables which premiered in Toronto at the Canadian Opera Company (2009), and has been presented at the Festival d’Aix-en-Provence and Opéra de Lyon in 2010.\n\nDas Rheingold, Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen prelude, premiered September 2010 at The Metropolitan Opera with the cycle being presented during the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons. His staging of The Tempest, by Thomas Adès, libretto by Meredith Oakes, based on William Shakespeare’s eponymous play, takes the stage in Québec then in New York in 2012.\n\nAwards\n\nRobert Lepage’s work has been recognized by many awards.
