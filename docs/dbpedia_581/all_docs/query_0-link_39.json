        "text": "Shakespeare’s oeuvre has become a communal, transcultural, and transhistorical artistic monument, inspiring a reverence summed up in the term “Bardolatry.” Just what is meant by “Shakespeare’s works” is, however, by no means straightforward. To the literary scholar, as to the layperson, the phrase may bring to mind printed texts (see Part XXIV, “Shakespeare and the Book”). This simple solution is undone by the inexactitude of the word “text.” Shakespeare’s plays exist as multiple texts, whose variations may be accounted for by many circumstances, including alterations made for, or during, performance. (See Part XXII, “Production History.”) There is no originary text, no perfect author-sanctioned script. Even the First Folio texts are, in a sense, copies, based on promptbooks, quartos, or foul papers, and mediated by scribes and compositors. (See Chapter 50, “The First Folio.”)\n\nTo make the matter more complicated, in an age of recycling, the name “Shakespeare” calls up a host of interpenetrating works, multiple creations and re-creations that may be taken as tributes but also as attempts at supplanting the cultural oppression of “the canon,” at winning cultural capital for new texts. Examples include dramatic rewritings (see Chapter 173, “Popular Adaptations for Theater”) – plays like Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1967) or T. E. Bond’s Lear (1971) – but also versions of Shakespeare’s plays devised for other performing arts: theater, film, television, video, radio, music, and dance. All of these adaptations involve some sort of “intermedial” transposition. (See Part XXVIII, “Shakespeare and Media History.”)"
