After a brief stint in the Coast Guard, he studied art around the world and eventually found his way to Stockholm, Sweden. There, he explored a black circle motif for over a decade, and followed minimalist art to its natural end. Upon moving back to LA, he began working for the sanitation department and took a 25-year hiatus from painting. In 1997 he returned to art, and now lives and paints in Santa Monica, CA. He shows his work at the Daniel Weinberg and Peter Mendhenhall Galleries in Los Angeles. Because he now paints with such vigor, Contreras often donates his paintings to universities.[1]\n\nCollection: University Collections of Art and Art History, Washington and Lee University.\n\nGift/Purchase: A gift from the artist. Contreras sent these works to Washington and Lee as a donation in order to “decorate a hallway, office, student center”[2] or anywhere appropriate on the campus grounds.\n\nProvenance: In 2005, Albert Contreras wrote Washington and Lee University’s president, Thomas Burish, and asked if he could donate 24 works to the university. According to the Deed of Gift, Contreras’s offer was accepted and the works were accessioned into Washington and Lee University Collections-The Reeves Center. The works hung in Dupont Hall until 2013 when the building’s renovations made their removal necessary. Later that year, six pieces were installed in the office of Associate Professor of Art History Andrea Lepage, and in 2016, the remaining 18 were hung in display in Wilson Hall.\n\nDescription: Albert Contreras demonstrates his command of symmetry and color in these 24 acrylic paintings. Eyes are supposed to jump from one color, one pattern, one square to the next. Described by artist Joe Fyfe as “an endlessly seductive colorist,”[3] Contreras paints using spatulas and trowels to create raised and patterned effects. Contreras intended that the twenty-four 12” x 14” linen boards gifted to Washington and Lee University be presented in four rows of six column Together the twenty-four pieces demonstrate the multiple painting types that Contreras has employed over the years, such as the circle, grid, plaid, checkerboard, and scalloped motifs. In 2005, he began using custom-made palate knives [4] that he likely used to create the raked texture in the black and gold pieces. Each square is a labor of passion, and when examined as a unit one cannot help but feel optimistic.\n\nSearch terms: Contreras, Albert; Painting, Abstract; Neo-Geo (Art); Los Angeles County; Santa Monica; Color; Art, American–21st century—Exhibitions; Peter Mendenhall Gallery; Minimalist ; Abstract Expressionism.\n\nLabel text: After a successful career as a Minimalist painter, the artist Albert Contreras went twenty-five years without touching a paintbrush. However, in 1997 Contreras rekindled his artistic passion, began to create with fervor, and in turn reinvented himself. The former minimalist now creates bold, acrylic pieces that are bursting with color. In his work, colors and shapes collide with glitter and texture, creating a work teeming with a childlike joy that one would not expect from the now 83-year-old. Contreras forms these geometric abstractions by piling layers of paint on a solid wooden panel. He then removes the paint in slabs using customized palate knives. This work is reminiscent of the time he spent resurfacing the asphalt streets of Los Angeles working for the sanitation department. Contreras’s art imitates his life, as he says, “art never comes to an end. It keeps reinventing itself, in all kinds of unbelievably beautiful forms.”[5]\n\nNotes: [1] Fyfe, Joe. “Albert Contreras at Bill Maynes.” Art in America, January 2002.

Between 1957 and 1959, Castro-Cid studied at the school of Fine arts at the University of Chile. Due to the difficulty for artist to make a living in Chile, Castro-Cid decided to move to New York City. In New York, he received the Guggenheim Fellowship Grant.[1] While in New York Castro-Cid developed a friendship with Henry Geldzahler who served as the art director at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and had close relationships with many major contemporary artists of the time. As a result, Castro-Cid received many major commissions that allowed him to display his work at major galleries including the Richard Feigen Gallery.[2] Many of his exhibitions in the sixties focused on robotics and kinetic art, producing robots that displayed the complexity of the machine and the human mind. In 1980 Castro-Cid moved to Miami but maintained his interest in technology and experimented with mathematics to distort his painting. He explored non-linear painting, working to create multiple dimensions within one image.[3]\n\nCollection: The Dr. Jacob Joseph and Bernice Fox Weinstein Collection of Contemporary Art, Washington and Lee University.\n\nGift/Purchase: Gift of Bernice Weinstein.\n\nProvenance: According to the receipt of gift, Mrs. Jacob J. Weinstein donated the gift in 1989. The piece was produced in 1980 and was likely shown at the Frank Kolbert Gallery in New York in 1981.[4] Likely, the Weinsteins purchased this piece directly from, or from a gallery that represented Enrique Castro-Cid and were the only owners of the piece for the 9 years before it joined the university collection.\n\nDescription: Castro-Cid paints a woman in a green leotard, leaving her legs, arm, and neck exposed. Her left arm is painted in the same green up until her mid-forearm, blending in with the leotard. Her hand rests against her on the outside of her left thigh. She bends slightly forward from her waist and is turned out towards the left side of the image. She has short brown hair and a neutral expression. Her feet are placed on the black ground, but are not grounded on the uneven plane. The other figure is all brown, outlined in a gray/white line. This nude figure is disproportionate. She has a very small head and her gaze looks out in the distance. She has a large bush of hair that puffs out from her head. Both of her arms extend far past her hips and her right arm expands from her elbow through her hand, as her oversized pointer finger reaches towards the woman in green. Her left arm reaches out as well, much smaller than her right and her pinky finger points out. Her body is proportionate from her small shoulders and her breasts, then from her rib cage her body bulges out, a large bulge on the right side, forcing her right hip upward. She stands in a counterbalanced stance, with the weight on her right leg, exaggerating the right hip’s elevation, while her left leg is propped up on her toes. Castro-Cid places these two figure inside a topsy-turvy box, he creates a space but one that distorts the usual rectilinear box. The black foreground sags in the center of the image and narrows at the back. The middle ground, behind the two figures is formed with three lines that connect in a rectilinear fashion and then a third that loops down, behind the brown figure, distorting the box like feel. Above them and to the right of the figure in green, Castro-Cid uses a darker color to distinguish the ceiling that encloses them. Around the edge, Castro-Cid painted a brown border, similar to the color of the brown figure. The entire frame has also been curved, adding a slight wave to the outer rim and further enforcing the distortion of space and spheres.\n\nSearch terms: Castro-Cid, Enrique, 1937-1992; Mathematics in art; Computer Art–Exhibitions; Arts, American–Latin American influences; Dia Art Foundation; Kinetic art—Exhibitions; Cahn, Robert S.\n\nLabel text: Enrique Castro-Cid, a Chilean born artist, created a series of images in the late seventies and early eighties. These images combined his early sketches that focused on creating multiple dimensions, with his interest in technology.[5] Castro-Cid manipulated figures in space by creating a grid and distorting the figures by manipulating the dimensions of the grid.[6] As his career developed, Castro-Cid became interested in robotics and technology and had several shows in Richard Feigen’s Galleries and across the country in which he expanded the notion of robotics as art and Kinetic art. Castro-Cid’s immersion in technology and his frustration with his inability to properly distort his hand-drawn sketches resulted in images like Ladya and Flora.Castro-Cid commented on his use of technology, saying, “My work is merely the product of the intellectual atmosphere of the times.”[7] Castro-Cid paired with Robert Cahn, a mathematician, to take each sketch he created and digitize it onto an X, Y plane. He was then able to apply a formula that would warp the image in an unpredictable way. As seen above, for example, Castro-Cid could then project this graphed, distorted image onto a canvas and paint it.[8] Although little is recorded about this specific image, the title, Ladya and Flora, represents the two figures in the image. In several other images that Castro-Cid created around the same time, he replicated the image on the right and employed the word “Flora” in his titles, such as in Flora and Benjamin, confirming the brown, distorted figure’s identity as “Flora.”[9]\n\nNotes: [1] “Enrique Castro-Cid – Pioneer in Latin American Art,” ArtfixDaily. 17 Aug. 2011, Accessed 6 Oct. 2016.
