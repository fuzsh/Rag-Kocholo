        "text": "March 7, 1957 ~ December 9, 2023\n\nIt is with deep sadness that we, the family of Robert Victor Macaulay, share the news of his loss on Saturday, December 9, 2023, at the age of 66 years. Surrounded by his family, Rob passed away at St. Joseph’s Home - Carmel Hospice after a long battle with cancer. He is survived by his loving wife Jeanette; son, Joel (Jodi) Macaulay and their children Jordyn and Maddox; daughter, Jodie Engbert (Adrian Hartman) and her daughters, Makiya and Jaelyn; siblings, Bruce (Jocelyn) Macaulay, Gloria Grossman and Darwin (Sherri-lynn) Pearce and their families as well as his sister-in-law, Doreen Dinelle; brother-in-law, Martin (Deanna) Soleski and their families.\n\nRob was born and raised in Medicine Hat. He married his “bride,” Jeanette on August 4, 1979, and they spent 44 years building their life and family until his passing.\n\nKnown in the community as Bob, he spent his career primarily in insurance and real estate where he built a reputation for being a kind and genuine man. Through the years, Jeanette and Rob were kept busy with their kids’ many activities from skating, baseball, softball, hockey, piano recitals and dance. He enjoyed the big family gatherings at the family cabin in Elkwater with the boating, golfing, bbq’s and even celebrating Christmas there one year. He loved all holidays but especially Christmas morning with the kids, getting his coffee and watching their excitement while opening their presents. He was very proud of his children and their accomplishments.\n\nRob loved spending time with his grandchildren; making special memories with them such as the traditional Christmas treasure hunt, Easter hunt, backyard family soccer games, back alley game, sleepovers and many more. He also made time and took pride in watching all their many activities, no matter what ridiculous hour he was there! Rob always hoped he’d be able to see them all grow up and graduate, but he will be celebrating with them from above.\n\nRob had an immense passion for golfing and hockey, especially the Toronto Maple Leafs as he and Jeanette were avid fans. They were both so happy when they recently attended two Leafs games live. Rob’s dream was always to see them win the Stanley Cup. Some of Rob’s favourite pastimes were playing Kaiser/cards, going for breakfast/coffee and collecting hockey cards.\n\nBorn and raised in Medicine Hat, Rob was always running into people he knew and would always take time for a friendly chat. Even to his final days, Rob would ask, “who’s coming over today?” taking joy in their coffee visits.\n\nThe family would like to thank the staff at St. Joseph’s Hospice as well as Dr. Bratvold and the Cancer Clinic for their care and support. A private family gathering will be held at a later date."
