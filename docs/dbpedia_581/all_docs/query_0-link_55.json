        "text": "Canadian-born Robert Lepage is one of the most acclaimed directors and interpreters of contemporary theatre. Together with the stage designer Carl Fillon and with the technical staff of his multimedia team Ex Machina, based in Quebec City in a disused fire station, he has planned and given life to some of the most emblematic examples of the dramaturgical use of scenography as well as the technique and integration of video onstage. From Needles and Opium (Les aiguilles et l’opium) to The Seven Streams of the River Ota (Les sept branches de la rivière Ota) to The Far Side of the Moon (La face cachée de la lune) he has more recently staged The Andersen Project, a solo show commissioned by the Andersen Foundation to celebrate the bicentenary of the Danish author’s birth."
