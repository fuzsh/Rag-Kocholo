The chief said the building was entered about 2 a.m. Monday. The theft was discovered by Constables Ray Atkinson and Ed Armstrong while they were on patrol about 6 a.m. Using a telephone headpiece they yanked off the wall of a nearby pay telephone, the youths gained entry by breaking the large east window.

One youth, a juvenile, who went to a Midland doctor’s office Monday night to have a cut finger dressed, was later questioned by police.

(Maybe sitting at home playing video games isn’t so bad after all.)\n\nTypical of the ladies who will be guests of manager Al Perkins at a special “Mother’s Day” program at the Roxy Theatre Monday night is Mrs. Eliza Bath. Now in her 88th year, Mrs. Bath is one of Midland’s oldest living mothers, if not the oldest. Mrs. Bath, and all Midland mothers of any age will be admitted to the Roxy and Drive-In theatres free of charge Monday night. Born near Sunderland Dec. 5, 1869, Mrs. Bath was the former Eliza Calhoun, daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. George Calhoun. There were eight children in the Calhoun family, only three of whom are still living. In addition to Mrs. Bath, there are two brothers, John, who has been a patient in St. Andrews Hospital for many months, and George of Beeton. Mrs. Bath’s life has not been an easy one. She came to North Simcoe as a girl of nine, when her father bought a farm between Coldwater and Waubaushene. Her mother died on Eliza’s 15th birthday, and the young girl had already been working in Jim Ryan’s Denison House hotel in Coldwater for some time. Eliza Calhoun came to Midland when she was 20, where she found employment in the home of the late Mr, and Mrs. Fred Jeffery, one of the town’s pioneer hardware merchants. A year later she married Frederick James Bath, who died many years ago. Mr. Bath, a bricklayer, was a member of another pioneer Midland family and a brother of Tom Bath, still a familiar figure on Midland streets. Following her husband’s death, Mrs. Bath went to Toronto to work, returning to Midland about 10 years ago. Although she still has many relatives in Midland, including all six of her eight children who are still living, Mrs. Bath prefers to live alone, in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Roy Campbell, 293 Midland Ave. “This way I can get up when I please and go to bed when I please, without disturbing anybody,” said Mrs. Bath. “Not that I sit idle for very long. I still like to do a bit of crocheting, quilting or knitting, and I get my own meals,” she told this reporter. Two of her sons, both veterans of World War I, have passed on, John Wesley Bath only recently at Sunny brook Hospital, Toronto. Albert also died from the effects of war wounds many years ago at Mimico. Surviving are three sons, Arthur, James and Stewart, and three daughters, Mrs. Violet Blair, Mrs. William Best (Evelyn), and Mrs. James Offord (Margaret), all of Midland. Mrs. Bath needs never lack company. In addition to her six living children, she has 35 great grandchildren and 27 grandchildren, “Enough for a good picnic.” said her daughter, Mrs. Offord.\n\nThe remaining 20 building lots in Midland’s federal-provincial land assembly project in the Wireless Hill area are being offered for sale to both builders and prospective homeowners it was announced today by R.

Mr. Sprague stated that, through a revision of the subdivision plan, frontages of 13 of the Iots has been increased to 56 feet, the remaining seven lots have 50-foot frontages. Selling prices to prospective homeowners have been set at $200 and $240, depending on the size of the lot, while prices to builders will be $400 and $480. In the case of a sale to a builder, however, half of the purchase price will be refunded where the selling price of the house erected does not exceed an amount established by CMHC, Mr. Sprague said.\n\nA rather unenviable record was set in Midland during the month of April, members of Midland Fire Department learned at their May meeting last week. Records showed a total of 34 fires occurred during the month, the most within the memory of even the oldest members. Attending this large number of fires meant a great deal of lost time from their regular jobs by the volunteer section of the brigade.\n\nOBITUARIES: Funeral service for Honoré Thanasse was held Friday, April 26, from the Beausoleil funeral home, Penetang, to Ste. Croix Church, Lafontaine, where Rev. T. Marchildon officiated. Interment was in Ste. Croix Cemetery. Pallbearers were Nap Hamelin, James Hamelin, Robert Maurice, Sr., Ligourie Robillard, Jos.

Surviving are four daughters, Mrs. Leone Grenier, Penetang; Mrs. Irma McConnell, Sudbury; Mrs. Germaine King, London, and Mrs. Marie Moran, Montreal. There are seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

There seem to be only six families with that surname in Simcoe County presently.) * * * THOMAS BOYER a resident of Penetang for the past 20 years, died April 25 at his home.

They were Mr. and Mrs. Roy French, and the roomful of flowers in their home at 322 King Street was ample evidence of the esteem which this couple has earned over the years. In fact, all but a few months of their 50 years of wedded life has been spent in Midland. Born at Waverley Nov. 28, 1880, Roy French went to school there and worked on his late father’s farm until 1900. Then he decided to become a carpenter and spent two years learning the rudiments of this trade under the late Joseph Davenport. The “going” wage for young would-be-carpenters in the early days of the century was 12 cents per hour, for a 10-hour day. Realising his early education had been of a limited nature, the young apprentice attended the night school then in operation at the Midland YMCA. For three years, from 1902 to 1904 he studied drawing and mathematics, both of which were a big help in his later career. From carpentry, Mr. French went to Midland Engine Works, where he learned the rudiments of pattern making. In 1905 he joined the many young men who were taking Horace Greeley’s advice by heading west. He obtained a job in the Brandon Machine Works. About this time a young lady also decided to see what the west had to offer. She was Agnes Barbara McNeill, a native of Hullett Township, in northern Huron County. Eventually, Agnes and Roy met in Brandon and in the spring of 1907 were married. Back in Midland after his three years in the west, Mr. French found employment in the foundry department of the Canada Iron Corporation, where he remained until 1913, at which time the smelter shut down. Then followed a brief period with the Benson and Bray firm. But with the outbreak of World War I, Mr. French found himself back with his old employers Midland Engine Works. They were making 6-inch shells at the works and Mr. French started off as an inspector. Later he became the night foreman and eventually general foreman of the No. 1 plant. After the war, Mr. French moved around the bay to Sunnyside, to the Great Lakes Foundry and Machine Shop, operated by W. W. Nicholson. He remained with Mr. Nicholson until the latter’s death in 1937. In the spring of 1938, Mr. French took over the Nicholson business, which has carried on ever since under the name of Great Lakes Boat and Machine Co. Up until five years ago, Mr. and Mrs. French lived at 17 Ottawa Street. They have resided at 322 King Street since that time. Mr. French is perhaps best known in Midland through his connection with Calvary Baptist Church. A member of the church since 1903, he has subsequently served on the board of deacons for more than 40 years, and for more than a quarter century was the superintendent of the Sunday School. Mr. French’s long service to Calvary was fittingly marked a year or so ago when the new addition to the church was officially opened. Although he served for two years as an alderman during the hard times of the early 30’s, Mr. French has never taken too keen an interest in party politics. “I have been guilty of voting for either party upon occasion,” Mr. French admitted. He admitted, too, that he was very fond of sport In his younger days, particularly baseball. He played on a number of teams back in the days when Town Park was a busy place all through the summer, with numerous “town league” clubs In action. Mr. and Mrs. French have one son, Alden, manager of Great Lakes Boat and Machine Co. Ltd. and two daughters, Mrs. J. E. Ayers (Florence), of Windsor, and Helen, a graduate of St. Andrews Hospital who takes and active part in the family business. There are also one granddaughter and six grandsons.\n\nAdmiring a bed of bright red tulips on the lawn of Mrs. A.

Mrs. Chilcott said windows in her home had been broken by bullets, and slugs had lodged in the outside walls. Pete Lepage present at the meeting, voiced his complaint stating that he knew of three or four dogs that had been wounded presumably from .22 calibre bullets. Mr. Lepage further stated it had been necessary several times for he and his men to quit work at his marine railway on the west side of Penetang Bay because bullets were whistling around their heads. “I know that youngsters are firing rifles from around Beck’s yard, and they’re firing out over the bay. I understand high-powered .22’s have a range of at least a mile. It’s only one-half mile across the bay to my property, and those bullets have too much power left there to be fooling around with them,” Mr. Lepage said.\n\nCounty Herald headline Friday May 3, 1957, “High School Board Pares Budget Holds Rate Increase to .98 Mills”.

Mr. and Mrs. Dunn marked their golden wedding anniversary April 10, in the home in which they have lived for 37 years.\n\nArticle by Ken Somers\n\nRemember when Hillsdale was served by a railway? There aren’t too many people living who were around when the rail service was discontinued. Among them are Mr. and Mrs. Norman Dunn who, on April 10, marked their golden wedding anniversary. Both are well qualified to talk about the early days of Hillsdale. Mr. Dunn was born there, 71 years ago, and his wife came to the then thriving village when she was 12 years old. “It was a much busier place than it is now,” said Mr. Dunn, recalling three saw mills, three shingle mills, a hoop and stave factory and a planing mill which provided employment for a population of around six or seven hundred persons. Things were much livelier then in the business section too, with two hotels, the same number of bake shops and blacksmith shops, and half a dozen stores. Then, as now, there were three churches. There was also a public school, the same one, incidentally, that some of the Dunn’s grandchildren attend even today. “Grandma and grandpa” attended that school together, and it was there they first met. Norman Dunn didn’t have too long a period to attend school. At the age of 14 he became an apprentice in the bakeshop of the late Louis Roberts. He received, at most, $4 per week. “I had to pay my keep out of that, too,” said Mr. Dunn. He agreed Mr. Roberts couldn’t afford to pay much more, with bread selling at six cents per loaf. Flour, of course, cost only half the price it does today. In any event, Mr. Dunn stuck with the job and is still at it, some 57 years later. He has a small oven right in his home, across the road from Rumble’s Pond, at the easterly edge of the village. Although he was a pastry man, too, in his younger days, now he bakes bread only, which he peddles in his car throughout the Medonte side roads. After their marriage in the parsonage of the old Methodist Church in Penetang April 10, 1907, the Dunn’s lived in a number of places before returning to the village some 37 years ago. Mrs. Dunn, the former Margaret Drennan, was born on a farm near Cookstown, one of four girls and four boys born to the late Mr. and Mrs. James Drennan. Her father built bridges and did other construction work throughout the area, as well as operate a farm. Of the eight children, all the girls are still living and two of the sons, Fred and Norman, both of Toronto. In addition to Mrs. Dunn, the daughters are Mrs. Fred Grigg, Elmvale; Mrs. Tom Fagan, Crossland; and Mrs. William Parker, of R.R. 3, Midland. In her younger days Mrs. Dunn sang in the Presbyterian Church choir with one of her sisters, Mrs. Grigg. She was also an early member of Hillsdale W.I. Mr. and Mrs. Dunn have four children of their own, including three sons, Grant, Hillsdale, Harold, Toronto, and Fred of Barrie; and one daughter, Mrs. George Lockhart (Gladys), who also lives in Hillsdale. There are eight grandchildren. Norman Dunn was also born on a farm, the son of the late Mr. and Mrs. James Dunn. A brother, George, still resides in Hillsdale, but their only sister died some years ago. [Normand died in 1959 and Margaret in 1971, they are both buried in Hillsdale]\n\nWhere’s my prize mister?

Mr. and Mrs. Dunn marked their golden wedding anniversary April 10, in the home in which they have lived for 37 years.\n\nArticle by Ken Somers\n\nRemember when Hillsdale was served by a railway? There aren’t too many people living who were around when the rail service was discontinued. Among them are Mr. and Mrs. Norman Dunn who, on April 10, marked their golden wedding anniversary. Both are well qualified to talk about the early days of Hillsdale. Mr. Dunn was born there, 71 years ago, and his wife came to the then thriving village when she was 12 years old. “It was a much busier place than it is now,” said Mr. Dunn, recalling three saw mills, three shingle mills, a hoop and stave factory and a planing mill which provided employment for a population of around six or seven hundred persons. Things were much livelier then in the business section too, with two hotels, the same number of bake shops and blacksmith shops, and half a dozen stores. Then, as now, there were three churches. There was also a public school, the same one, incidentally, that some of the Dunn’s grandchildren attend even today. “Grandma and grandpa” attended that school together, and it was there they first met. Norman Dunn didn’t have too long a period to attend school. At the age of 14 he became an apprentice in the bakeshop of the late Louis Roberts. He received, at most, $4 per week. “I had to pay my keep out of that, too,” said Mr. Dunn. He agreed Mr. Roberts couldn’t afford to pay much more, with bread selling at six cents per loaf. Flour, of course, cost only half the price it does today. In any event, Mr. Dunn stuck with the job and is still at it, some 57 years later. He has a small oven right in his home, across the road from Rumble’s Pond, at the easterly edge of the village. Although he was a pastry man, too, in his younger days, now he bakes bread only, which he peddles in his car throughout the Medonte side roads. After their marriage in the parsonage of the old Methodist Church in Penetang April 10, 1907, the Dunn’s lived in a number of places before returning to the village some 37 years ago. Mrs. Dunn, the former Margaret Drennan, was born on a farm near Cookstown, one of four girls and four boys born to the late Mr. and Mrs. James Drennan. Her father built bridges and did other construction work throughout the area, as well as operate a farm. Of the eight children, all the girls are still living and two of the sons, Fred and Norman, both of Toronto. In addition to Mrs. Dunn, the daughters are Mrs. Fred Grigg, Elmvale; Mrs. Tom Fagan, Crossland; and Mrs. William Parker, of R.R. 3, Midland. In her younger days Mrs. Dunn sang in the Presbyterian Church choir with one of her sisters, Mrs. Grigg. She was also an early member of Hillsdale W.I. Mr. and Mrs. Dunn have four children of their own, including three sons, Grant, Hillsdale, Harold, Toronto, and Fred of Barrie; and one daughter, Mrs. George Lockhart (Gladys), who also lives in Hillsdale. There are eight grandchildren. Norman Dunn was also born on a farm, the son of the late Mr. and Mrs. James Dunn. A brother, George, still resides in Hillsdale, but their only sister died some years ago. [Normand died in 1959 and Margaret in 1971, they are both buried in Hillsdale]\n\nWhere’s my prize mister?
