MILLER AND JAMES A. MILLER CHARLES HEIDELBERGER was a scientist with broad tal- ents. Trained as an organic chemist, he later became a skilled biochemist ant! cell culturist. From his many years of research on cancer chemotherapeutic agents, he also devel- opecl an impressive knowledge of human cancer and its treat- ment. He was a prolific reader, an original thinker, a synthe- sizer of Pleas, an avid explorer of new concepts, and a lucid writer. Using these talents and his fine intellect, Charles Hei- delberger macle his mark in science by seminal ant! extensive contributions to three areas of cancer research. He pioneered in the use of 3H- and i4C-labeled carcinogenic polycyclic hy- cirocarbons in the study of their metabolism and their inter- actions with target tissues. He was an early investigator of the development of systems for the malignant transformation by chemicals of mammalian cells in culture, and with his col- leagues he clevelope(1 one of the most widely used systems for the transformation of mouse fibroblasts. His most impor- tant accomplishment, however, was the design, synthesis, pre- clinical testing, and analysis of the mechanisms of action of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and related compounds for the chemo- therapy of cancer. 259\n\n260 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS EARLY YEARS This remarkable scientist was born on December 23, 1920, the only child of Michael and Nina knee Tachau) Hei- clelberger. Known as Charlie to his many friends, Heidelber- ger was most fortunate to be brought up in a warm and lov- ing family that included the arts and sciences among its many interests. In adclition to his parents, his immediate family in New York City incluclec! his mother's mother anct five of his mother's sisters. Charlie's grandmother was much beloved by the whole family. She ant! her daughters, Charlie's aunts, maintained close relations with the Heidelbergers. Both Nina and Michael Heiclelberger had a talent for and interest in music, and they made their home a center for its enjoyment. At the time of Charlie's birth, Michael Heidelberger was al- ready establishecl at the Rockefeller Institute for Meclical Re- search as a promising young organic chemist. Thus, from his earliest years, Charlie came to know scientists, both from the Uniter! States and Europe, ant! to hear discussions of their work. In an account written cluring his last year of high school Charlie listecl Drs. O. Avery, R. Loeb, and W. Oster- hout all of the Rockefeller Institute among his friends. In addition, as a child, Charlie accompanies! his parents on several trips to Europe, through which he gained an early appreciation of the international nature of science anc! of culture. Except for summer vacations, Charlie lived in New York City from his birth until he gracluated from high school. He attended the Birch-Wathen School, a private school at 94th Street. According to Charlie's account, he passed his early years in a mi(lcile- to upper-cIass school that emphasized learning the funciamentals of science, history, and language. His extracurricular activities in high school incluclecl music, drama, and journalism. At about the age of six, Charlie was\n\nCHARLES HEIDELBERGER . 261 given a quarter-size violin and a few violin lessons by Toscha Seiclel, an eminent musician and family friend, who later pre- sented him with his first full-size violin. From the age of nine, Charlie spent many of his summers at a boys' camp on Cape Coil, first as a camper and later as a junior counselor. At camp he developed a fanciness for and great competence in sailing, which he was to enjoy as an avo- cation in college, cluring his twenty-eight years in Madison, Wisconsin, and after moving to Los Angeles. In 1937 Heidelberger was admitted to Harvard College, where he majored in chemistry. On completing the B.S. de- gree in 1942, he began his graduate work at Harvard, earn- ing M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in organic chemistry in 1944 and 1946, respectively. His Ph.D. advisor was the eminent organic chemist Louis Fieser, who was then carrying out research on several war-relatecl projects. Accordingly, the second part of Heiclelberger's thesis, \"The Synthesis and Antimalarial Activ- ity of Some Naphthoquinones,\" came out of the war effort of Fieser's group. The results of his thesis were published, to- gether with those of his colleagues, in a series of multi- authored papers in the journal of the American Chemical Society. The summer following completion of his Ph.D. degree, Hei- delberger was appointed an instructor in chemistry at Har- varcI, ant! he gave the summer lectures in organic chemistry while Fieser was on sabbatical leave. Although Fieser had set aside his research on the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hy- (lrocarbons during the war years, the laboratory at Harvard introclucect Heidelberger to these carcinogens, which became central to his later research. His graduate work also intro- duced him to chemotherapeutics, his second principal area of research. For postcloctoral work, Heiclelberger mover! to the Don- ner Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley, where he joined Melvin Calvin and his associates in the study\n\n262 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS of carbon-14 as a too! for the eluciciation of metabolic reac- tions. During this two-year period, Hei(lelberger synthesized the first carbon-14-labeled carcinogen, dibenzanthracene- 9,10-carbon-14 (now known as E7,12-~4C]dibenz~a,h~anthra- cene) and carrier! out initial studies on its metabolism in the mouse. At the same time, working with S. Lepkovsky, he syn- thesizect ~4C-labelecl tryptophan and inclole-3-acetic acid for analysis of tryptophan metabolism. This perio(1 also saw Hei- delberger's preparation, with M. Calvin, J. C. Reid, B. M. Tol- bert, ant! P. F. Yankwich, of the textbook Isotopic Carbon. This book, published in 1949, was the stanciarct textbook for stu- dents using carbon 14 in metabolic studies for more than a decacle. RESEARCH CAREER Heiclelberger's studies on f~4C]clibenz~a,h~anthracene caught the attention of Harold P. Rusch, director of the then relatively new McArdIe Laboratory for Cancer Research at the University of Wisconsin. While attencling a meeting on the West Coast, Rusch visited Heiclelberger at the Donner Laboratory and persuaded him to accept a position as assist- ant professor of oncology at the McArdIe Laboratory. In 1948, Heiclelberger and his wife Juclith moved to Madison, marking the beginning of his productive twenty-eight years at McArdIe. Hei(lelberger was brought to the McArdle Laboratory to establish facilities for the use anct quantitation of carbon-14 for metabolic studies, to provide expertise in the synthesis of labeler! compounds (at a time when they were not commer- cially available), anti to pursue the problem of cancer accord- ing to his own Pleas. He carried out each of these activities with vigor. Heiclelberger soon set up a centralize(1 clepart- mental facility for the quantitation of carbon-14 (and later for tritium and P-321. He kept the facility operating with\n\nCHARLES HEIDELBERGER 263 state-of-the-art technique for nearly thirty years. With his ex- pertise in the use of carbon-14, he colIaboratec! on projects with most of the members of the McArdle staff cluring his first decade there. Together with Van R. Potter, Heidelberger initiated his research at the University of Wisconsin with a study to test A. G. Ogsten's theoretical deduction \"that the asymmetric oc- currence of isotope in a product cannot be taken as conclu- sive evidence against its arising from a symmetrical precur- sor.\" ~ Heidelberger and Potter's study completely confirmed Ogston's theory that an asymmetric enzyme can (distinguish between identical groups of a symmetrical compound, dem- onstrating the asymmetrical synthesis of citric acid labellec3 with TIC. Potter's interest in exploring a possible metabolic pathway from citric acid cycle intermediates to pyrimidines using orotic acid and Heidelberger's expertise as an organic chemist made them well-suited for collaborative work. They accomplished the synthesis of Li4C]orotic acid with Potter's student R. HurIburt in 1950. Heidelberger's later studies of nucleic acid pyrimidines were built on this experience. CARCINOGENIC POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS Heidelberger's synthesis of [l4C]dibenz(a,h)anthracene gave him the opportunity to examine the metabolism of this hydrocarbon in much greater cletai! than had been possible with the spectroscopic methods of earlier workers, and he identified several degradation products. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, when there was great interest in protein- bound carcinogens in target tissues, Heiclelberger and his students used labeled hydrocarbons to determine their co- valent binding to mouse-skin protein and, especially, to quan- ' A. G. Ogston, \"Interpretation of experiments on metabolic processes using iso- topic tracer elements,\" Nature (London), 162(1948):963.\n\n264 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS titate the relative levels of binding of several hydrocarbons in relation to their carcinogenic activities. Furthermore, they studied in depth the specificity of binding of the hydrocar- bons to various soluble mouse-skin proteins as a function of · · · · · - t near carcinogenic activities. After K. E. Wi~zbach (Argonne National Laboratory) re- ported his general method for the tritiation of organic com- pounds,2 Heidelberger prepared tritiated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The much higher specific activities of the tri- tiated hydrocarbons facilitated in viva approaches to macro- molecular binding of the hydrocarbons. With G. R. Daven- port, Heidelberger was the first to report the covalent binding of a carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbon to mouse- skin DNA and RNA. But because of technical problems re- lated to the determination of tritium in cesium chloride so- lutions in the Heidelberger laboratory, the first definitive report on the covalent binding of polycyclic aromatic hydro- carbons to DNA of target tissues was that of P. D. Lawley and P. Brookes (Chester Beatty Research Institute, London). Using tritiated dibenz~a,h~anthracene, Heidelberger and his colleagues later made one of the first observations of the mi- crosomal metabolism of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon to · . an epoxlue. The studies on the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were later melded with Heidelberger's work on oncogenic trans- formation in cell culture. In these investigations, Heidelber- ger and his colleagues studied the possible relationship between the formation of K-region epoxides of the hyciro- carbons and their mutagenic and transforming activities. As this work was being published, the complexity of the meta- bolic activation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 2 K. E.

Soc., 79(1957): 1013.\n\nCHARLES HEIDELBERGER 265 the involvement of other sites on the molecules were becom- ing evident from the reports of P. Sims, P. Grover, and their colleagues at the Chester Beatty Research Institute.3 Heidel- berger ant] his colleagues continued to probe this area, but other research interests took the lead. TRANSFORMATION OF CELLS IN CULTURE As Heiclelberger carrier} out his early stucties on carcino- gen metabolism in relation to carcinogenesis, he was im- pressed with the limitations imposed by whole-animal sys- tems on the elucidation of the carcinogenic process. He began, accorclingly, to search for other systems. lIse Lasnitzki tract recently shown that organ cultures of mouse prostate glancis treated with the carcinogen 3-methylcholanthrene de- veloped an atypical morphology somewhat resembling that observed in tumors. In 1962 Heiclelberger took a seven- r~onth sabbatical to work with Lasnitzki at the Strangeways Laboratory in Cambridge, England, to learn the techniques required for the clevelopment of an organ culture system anti to develop a background in the cellular aspects of biology. On returning to the McArdle Laboratory, Heidelberger treated organ cultures of mouse prostate with polycyclic aro- matic hydrocarbons, looking for neoplastic properties in the cultures. This laborious work, carried out on a rather large scale, yieldecl morphologically observable cytopathology but no tumors on transplantation of the cultured cells into isol- ogous mice. In studies with P. T. Type, however, the hyciro- carbon-treated cultures eventually yielded permanent lines of cells that gave rise to transplantable tumors. This success encouraged Heidelberger and his colleagues to culture C3H mouse-prostate cells for the selection of non- 3 D. H. Phillips and P.

Such cell lines, which were aneuploict, were obtained, but ceased to grow on reaching confluence. Nor did they produce tumors on inoculation into irradiatecl isologous mice. But treatment of the rapidly growing cells with 3-methy~cholanthrene caused some of them to continue growing after reaching confluence that procluced fibrosar- comas on injection into irradiatect mice of the same strain. Although malignant transformation of cultured roclent cells by chemicals was achieved somewhat earlier by other inves- tigators, Heidelberger and his colleagues were the first to obtain a system depenclent on an established line of cells. Later, Heiclelberger with C. Reznikoff anc! J. Bertram es- tablished the C3H/IOTI/2 cell-line that became a standard too! for studies of mammalian cell transformation anc! mu- tagenicity. Heidelberger and his associates showed that there was a general quantitative relationship between the in viva carcinogenic activities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ant! their abilities to cause malignant transformation of these cultures! cells. As noted above, they also explored the reac- tivity of the hydrocarbons with cellular macromolecules in relation to malignant transformation and mutagenesis in cul- ture. Heidelberger and his colleagues attacked other, more bio- logical, problems with regard to the nature of malignant transformation. These inclucled early explorations of pos- sible retroviral involvement in transformation by chemicals and of stochastic aspects of transformation. They showed that carcinogenic chemicals inclucec3 alterations in cells that caused them to become malignant, as opposer! to a situation in which the carcinogen facilitated the selection of preexist- ing malignant cells. They further showed that (as others had clemonstratec] earlier for malignant transformation in whole animals) each cell line transformer] in culture hac! unique\n\nCHARLES HEIDELBERGER 267 antigenic properties that clid not cross-react with those of other inclepenclently transformed cells. CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY Heidelberger's intellect and energies were such that, from his earliest days at the McArc3le Laboratory, he routinely car- ried out two quite separate research programs in parallel. Starting in the early 1950s, he turned his interest in the bio- synthesis of nucleic acids in normal and tumor tissues and- from his graduate student daysin chemotherapy toward a search for pyrimiclines that would be therapeutic for cancer. Following a 1954 report by R. I. Rutman, A. Cantarow, and K. E. Paschkis ~ Jefferson Medical College) on the greater ex- tent of incorporation of uraci! into rat liver tumor DNA than into normal liver DNA,4 Heiclelberger made similar obser- vations on a variety of tumors and their normal tissues of origin. On the basis of the exceptional toxicity of fluoroacetic acid through its metabolism to fluorocitric acid and our stucI- ies on fluorinated carcinogens, Heiclelberger reasoned that substitution of a fluorine atom into the 5-position of uracil might prevent its metabolism to thymidylic acid and thus in- terfere with DNA synthesis. He thus embarked on the syn- thesis of 5-fluorouracil. Following his first stucties, which shower! that 5-flu- orouraci! inhibited the growth of a series of transplanted ro- dent tumors, Heiclelberger enlisted the cooperation of Rob- ert Duschinsky at Hoffman-LaRoche to perfect the synthesis of 5-fluorouraci! so that tests on its therapeutic effects for tumors conic! be expanded. Clinical trials, first carried out at the University of Wisconsin by A. R. Curreri and F. Ansfielcl at Heidelberger's urging ancl with his cooperation, clemon- 4 R. J. Rutman, A. Cantarow, and K. E. Paschkis, `'Studies in 2-acetylamino flu- orene carcinogenesis. III.

Further stud- ies by a number of clinical investigators have given 5- fluorouraci! an important place in the chemotherapeutic treatment of several human malignancies, especially cancer of the female breast and of the colon. In acIdition to 5-fluorouracil, Heiclelberger's interest in fluorinated pyrimidines lect to the syntheses in his laboratory of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (which has received limited use in cancer chemotherapy), 5-fluorocytosine (clinically effective against yeast and fungal infections), and 5-trifluoro- methyIdeoxyuriclylic acid (a tumor inhibitor that is also very active against some DNA virus infections for example, vac- cinia virus and herpes simplex, when applied locally). Over a span of about twenty years, Heidelberger's labo- ratory contributed greatly to our understanding of the bio- chemical mechanisms of action of 5-fluorouraci! anc! relater! compounds. Heidelberger observed that 5-fluorouraci! is in- corporated into RNA in place of uracil. However, probably the more important biological effect of 5-fluorouracil in re- lation to inhibition of tumor growth appears to be the pow- erful inhibitory activity of its metabolite 5-fluorodeoxyuri- clylic acid for thymidylate synthetase. He examined the mechanism of action of thymidylate synthetase and of its in- hibition by 5-fluorocleoxyuridylic acic! in a number of papers. Finally, one of his last scientific achievements was to clevelop sensitive assays for this enzyme, its normal substrate (leox- yuriclylic acid, and 5-fluorodeoxyuridylic acic! in tumor biop- sies, so that these could be studied in relation to the thera- peutic responses of individual tumors to 5-fluorouracil. These contributions to cancer chemotherapy earned Hei- clelberger much well-cleservecl recognition. His scientific de- cluction that 5-fluorouraci! might be chemotherapeutic for cancer, his development of this idea from chemical synthesis through preclinical testing, his collaboration in the first clin-\n\nCHARLES HEIDELBERGER 269 ical tests, and his extensive studies on the mechanism of ac- tion of the drug attest to a scientific breadth seldom achieved. PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES AND HONORS Heidelberger spent twenty-eight years at the McArcIle Laboratory, beginning as an assistant professor of oncology in 1948. He advanced to associate professor in 1952, profes- sor in 195S, ant! American Cancer Society Professor of On- cology in 1960. With the development of the Wisconsin Clin- ical Cancer Center in 1973, he became its associate director for basic science while continuing to maintain his appoint- ment at the McArdie Laboratory. In 1976 Heidelberger ac- ceptect the challenge of becoming the director for basic re- search of the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Comprehensive Cancer Center. In this position he was responsible for organizing, recruiting new stab, and de- veloping the overall direction of research for a new cancer center. He was namer! a Distinguished Professor of the Uni- versity of Southern California in 1981. Although his un- timely death cut short his work, Heidelberger livecl to see the University of Southern California Comprehensive Cancer Center become a major center for cancer research. Heiclelberger gave generously of his time and intellect through membership on a number of professional commit- tees and participation in symposia and meetings. He was chairman of the biochemistry committee and a member of the drug evaluation pane! of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center ~ ~ 958- 19621; a member of the Pharmacology ant! Experimental Therapeutics B Study Section of the National Institutes of Health (1964-19681; a member for three terms of the boars! of (Erectors of the American Association for Cancer Research 959-962, ~965-l968, and ~976-l979~; a member of the U.S. National Committee of the International Union against\n\n270 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS Cancer (1963-1970~; twice chairman of the program com- mittee for the American Association for Cancer Research ~ ~ 960 and ~ 96 ~ ); chairman of the program committee for the 1970 Tenth International Cancer Congress in Houston; a member of the program committee of the Eleventh Inter- national Cancer Congress in Florence, Italy, in 1974; a mem- ber of the Council of the International Union Against Cancer (1970-19741; a member of the Board of Scientific Counse- lors, Division of Drug Treatment, National Cancer Institute (1975-19781; a member of the fellowship committee of the International Union Against Cancer (1977-19781; a member of the fellowship committee of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France (1977-19781; and a mem- ber of the public issues committee of the American Associa- tion for Cancer Research (1977-19781. In 1978 he also served as a consultant to the government of the Federal Re- public of Germany during their organization of the Deutsche Stiftung fur Krebsforschung. In all of these activities, Hei- delberger displayer} a broad knowlecige of cancer research and alliecl fields, a perceptive mind, great organizational ca- pacity, tenacity, ant} willingness to work hard. He was recog- nized as a strong committee person who cli(1 his share of the work and expected others to clo likewise. Numerous awards came to Heidelberger for his research accomplishments: Langer-Teplitz Award for Cancer Re- search (1958), Lucy Wortham James Award of the lames Ew- ing Society ~969), Walter Hubert Lecturer of the British As- sociation for Cancer Research (1969), G.H.A. Clowes Award of the American Association for Cancer Research ~ ~ 970), An- nual National Awarcl of the American Cancer Society (1974), Lila Gruber Award of the American Academy of Dermatol- ogy (1976), Papanicolaou Award of the Papanicolaou Insti- tute for Cancer Research (1978), Founcler's Award of the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology ~1982), (I. Chester\n\nCHARLES HEIDELBERGER 271 Stock Award of the Memorial SIoan-Kettering Cancer Center (1982), and Athayde International Cancer Prize of the Thir- teenth International Cancer Congress (19824. Heidelberger was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1978. With his election, his father, Michael Heidelberger, became one of the few members of the Academy to see his child also so honored. TEACHING Although Heidelberger did little formal teaching, he was well known and respected as a teacher. Over the course of his career, fourteen graduate students obtained the Ph.D. degree in his laboratory and a total of eighty individuals re- ceived postdoctoral training. He taught by example in the laboratory, through critical and in-depth discussions with his students, and by means of weekly meetings of his research staff. These meetings, which usually lasted several hours on Monday evenings, included discussion of all of the research in progress in the lab. Organic chemists learned about bio- logical problems, and biologists became familiar with discus- sions of synthetic organic chemistry. They all honed their critical thinking through listening and reacting to Heidelber- ger's probing. Heidelberger was a master at reporting scientific meetings to his colleagues on the staff, his students, and postdoctoral associates. He returned from each meeting with detailed notes from which he could reconstruct the main argument of a speaker's report and, usually, the critical data to support the claim, and few matched his ability to sum up and convey significant points to colleagues unable to attend. FAMILY AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES In an autobiography written at the end of his high school years, Heidelberger pictured himself, especially prior to high\n\n272 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS school, as a shy person. This description came as a surprise to Heidelberger's professional friends, who regarded him as strongly outgoing, somewhat aggressive, and very sociable. He enjoyed his family, and the Heidelbergers had a wide circle of friends. Their frequent social evenings might in- clude dinner, music, and wide-ranging discussions. Music was a highlight of Heidelberger's life. He learned to play the violin as a young boy, was a member of the Har- vard symphony orchestra in college, and continued to play chamber music throughout his life. Visits from his father, an amateur clarinetist, brought evenings of chamber music with family and friends. Heidelberger was also a jazz enthusiast. He played the trumpet and drums in jazz bands while in college and maintained his membership as a jazz trumpeter in the musicians' union for much of his life. This membership enabled him to introduce himself to professional musicians and join them for a tune or two while attending professional meetings. Heidelberger enjoyed his first visits to Europe as a young child and remained an avid traveler throughout his life. He and his wife often combined scientific meetings abroad with personal travel, making the most of the time available. He came home from England, Europe, Japan, parts of Asia, and Israel with hundreds of slides of scenery, people, and what- ever else fascinated him. These slides became his props for travelogues, both in the Heidelberger home and on several occasions- in the lecture room at McArdIe. Heidelberger's other major social activity was sailing, be- gun as a boyhood hobby in summer camp, nurtured during his years at Harvard, and later expanded with the purchase of a sailboat for use on Lake Mendota in Madison. His pas- sion for sailing culminated with the acquisition of a larger boat for sailing off the coast of southern California. Sailing\n\nCHARLES HEIDELBERGER 273 and enjoying music with his family and friends were the ul- timate relaxation for this intensively active man. Heidelberger was married in 1943 to Judith Werble. Their three children are Nina Heidelberger Rosefelt, Philip Heidelberger, and Lisa Heidelberger. In 1975 he married Patricia Boshell, who together with his father, children, anti grandsons, Joshua Rosefelt and Davic! Charles Heidelberger, . . survives . film. Heidelberger died January 1 8, 1983, approximately eigh- teen months after a diagnosis of carcinoma of the nasal sinus. During the intervening period, except for periods of intense therapy, he continued his work. As in the case of his mother's death from breast cancer in 1946, which he cited as one of his reasons for going into cancer research, Heidelberger's illness intensified his concern to find an adequate chemo- therapy for cancer patients. Although he never achieved this ultimate goal, Charles Heidelberger's scientific accomplish- ments were impressive and earned him the recognition of his peers. His life was a full one, and he maintained strong re- lations with his family and friends. In his many former stu- dents and colleagues, in his research and accomplishments, Heidelberger has left a strong scientific le~rv ~ ~ , WE ARE INDEBTED to Michael Heidelberger for an account of Charles Heidelberger's early family life; to Patricia Heidelberger for information on his work at the University of Southern Califor- nia and for an autobiography written by Charles Heidelberger at the end of his high school education; and to our colleagues at the McArdle Laboratory, especially Henry C.
