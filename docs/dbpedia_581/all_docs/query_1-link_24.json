        "text": "Known as the alchemist of modern imagistic theatre, Robert Lepage is one of the most challenging and chimeric directors of our time. His work reveals uncanny, almost unnatural powers of visual transfiguration, as waterlogged lecture halls transform themselves into the canals of Venice, piles of old books meld into the New York city skyline, an old tumble dryer becomes a spacecraft's docking bay. However, unlike many of his contemporaries in experimental theatre, Lepage harbours no aggression towards language, and his tangled plot-lines maintain a bewitching, old-fashioned attitude to storytelling, nestling somewhere between epic poetry and the most accessible and unpretentious of camp-fire traditions: \"Robert is a real visionary, creating theatre for people who don't like theatre,\" says musician Peter Gabriel, for whom Lepage directed the Secret World Tour, \"he is as much a transformational catalyst as Peter Brook.\"\n\nOne of the most startling aspects of Lepage's work, reflected in his new show, The Far Side Of The Moon, which opens at the Cottesloe Theatre on London's South Bank on July 10, is that it is created entirely organically and democratically, without involving a playwright, through the process of improvisation, with each actor spinning storylines out of the air. \"It's utterly eclectic,\" says Sir Richard Eyre, who championed Lepage at the National Theatre. \"He weaves these parables and knits them together using the vocabulary of film and video. And yet you don't feel that it is just a soup of ingredients.\"\n\nThis knife-edge improvisation process has produced some catastrophes, such as the infamous 1994 Edinburgh premiere of The Seven Streams Of The River Ota, an apocalyptic chronicle that was still a work in progress on opening night: \"Overran by two hours, the scenery went haywire, and there were long scenes in Quebecois French,\" noted critic Charles Laurence in the Daily Telegraph.\n\nBut when all the daring connections and imaginative leaps coincide, such as in the Dragons' Trilogy, a picaresque exploration of Chinese culture, or in the seismic plotlines of Tectonic Plates, and Seven Streams, when it appeared again at the National in 1996 (after four years of public performances had refined it to perfection) the effect is spellbinding. When theatre has come under attack as an outmoded form, Lepage has been cited as proof of its radical vitality.\n\nMichel Tremblay, Canada's foremost Francophone playwright says: \"In the early 80s we were still using the Quebec language as our primary weapon. Then Lepage arrived who, instead of language, used these incredible powerful but simple images. We were all flabbergasted that the little boy from Quebec city managed to overturn everything.\"\n\nNow 43, the boy from Quebec city has gained a little brawn and is no longer quite so feline and delicate. But he still retains the air of an exotic interloper, with his deathly pale skin and a manner that radiates a mesmeric emptiness. He has suffered from alopecia - hair loss - since childhood, and his otherworldly air is heightened by an eerie lack of eyebrows. It's said he has a wardrobe full of wigs, ranging from the frizzy mop he wore on the London stage in the 80s to the more fashionable, wet-look model he sports today.\n\n\"There is something about the smoothness of his skin,\" says Sally Dexter, who played Titania in his muddy Midsummer Night's Dream at the National. \"It is absolutely pure, waxy. With eyes like big schooners of sherry he looks like a loveable alien you might like to befriend and take home.\"\n\nHe is exceptionally modest: \"I remember my first review in London said I was the next Peter Brook. I said: 'No way. I'm not Peter Brook. I don't have the maturity, the experience, the intelligence. Don't burden me.'\" And he says there is no obscure or magical secret to his talent. But sometimes, such as at the opening night of Dragons' Trilogy in Quebec in 1985, external events contribute to a magical experience: \"We were performing in this warehouse, which opened onto the docks,\" says Jacques Lessard, co-founder of Lepage's former company, Thétre Repère, \"And at the end of the play, Robert decided we should open this big back entrance that faced the quayside. But just as that moment came in the play, and the door was pulled back, a Chinese junk passed by with a big flowing red sail. To this day, it remains something inexplicable. It was magical. It was blessed by gods.\"\n\nThe vibrant chaos that Lepage seems effortlessly to generate comes at a price - his expectation of actors has often led to dissent and his penchant for last-minute changes is legendary: \"Two days before the opening of Seven Streams,\" says actress Marie Gignac, one of Lepage's closest friends and a long-term collaborator, \"he suddenly decided that a character who had been a painter would become a Buto dancer. In two days, the poor actor had to learn Buto dancing [a Japanese movement form that requires years of training]. I have literally seen people cry.\" In the past, this same chaotic inclination and his punishing travel schedule has damaged Lepage's personal life, demolishing relationships and friendships: \"There are not so many people who are close to him,\" continues Gignac. \"He did lead a very exciting life but you lose people when you travel. After a certain number of years he began to feel pretty lonely.\"\n\nHowever, Lepage has recently begun to regain some kind of equilibrium, thanks to his sister Lynda Beaulieu, who became his assistant in 1997: \"My principal goal was for him to have a decent life, because his was hectic,\" she says. \"He calls me his octopus because I have a hand on almost every aspect of his life.\" Lepage had lived mainly in rented accommodation before Beaulieu discovered, not far from his theatre centre La Caserne, an apartment with panoramic views over Quebec's old port. Lepage set about redesigning his new home with minimalist rigour.\n\n\"I'm still very busy and doing projects but it is much more civilised,\" Lepage says. \"Lynda now creates a sort of space for my life to happen within. Actually I have a condominium now, and I have a boyfriend and a dog. Sometimes I am away just a bit too long for it to be completely comfortable, but we have managed to work out this system to have a normal life, whatever that means.\" Since the mid-90s, he has been in a relationship with American actor and writer Kevin McCoy, who appeared as Trotsky in Lepage's 1999 production Geometry Of Miracles.\n\nRobert Lepage was born on December 12 1957 in Quebec city, the first natural son of Germaine (née Robitaille) and Fernand Lepage, a former naval officer who had, by this time, taken a job as a taxi driver. After Germaine suffered numerous miscarriages, the Lepages decided to adopt children, a boy and a girl who, as the family were then living in Anglophone Nova Scotia, were brought up and educated in English. By the time Robert and his sister Lynda, who is 13 months his junior, were born, they had moved back to Francophone Quebec, resulting in a family that Lepage now refers to as \"a metaphor for Canada\", split down the linguistic divide.\n\nIn addition to this unusual bilingual pedigree, young Robert was marked out in other ways: \"He was a tiny, quiet kid,\" remembers his brother Dave, six years older than Robert and now a professor of photography in Ottawa. \"That physical difference always has a social impact with your peers.\" His naturally melancholic disposition was emphasised when at the age of six he fell prey to alopecia: \"Of course I had friends, but it was very limiting because there was a always a chance that at every corner someone would be laughing at me or waiting to beat me up. I had a very lonely childhood because of that.\"\n\nAt the Joseph-François Perreault high school Robert became involved in theatre, began to gain some confidence, and accumulated a band of friends. However, at 14, he suffered another debilitating psychological setback, this time in the unlikely shape of a first teenage joint: \"I discovered later that there was probably more opium in it than anything else - it was hashish treated with opium,\" he says, \"It just flipped my mind. I was stoned for a week. It really fucked me up and I almost died. I went into this nervous breakdown and once again I was a recluse. I withdrew. I was having difficulties even walking to school I was so paranoid.\"\n\nAfter three years of panic attacks and agoraphobia, often spending months as a prisoner in his bedroom, an end-of-term performance in which he was cast as an English scientist called Mr Springate in a play called Ben-Ur (short for Benot Urban by the Canadian writer Jean Barbeau) marked the first step to recovery. But first he had to get out of the house: \"I had the feeling that he would regret it for the rest of his life if he didn't go,\" says Lynda, who provided the necessary coercion. \"I was really scared that I was going to lose him.\n\n\"I will always remember that night - when I pushed him into the taxi he was crying and I had pills in the other hand to calm him. In the end, I was so nervous for him I probably needed the pills more than he did. I will never forget that on his first line the audience began to laugh, he was so good and funny. And that was the end of this nightmare.\" Lepage says: \"It was very liberating and the audience loved it. So I became addicted to theatre. I thought that this is my way to get out of this thing.\"\n\nOn leaving school in 1974, Lepage applied for a place in the Quebec conservatory of music and drama. Again there was a sense that this spindly, smooth-skinned boy could be both magnetic and marginal: \"He was popular, but there was always a side of him that was the 'outsider',\" says classmate Richard Fréchette, who would go on to become one of his prominent collaborators. Though Lepage excelled in a number of offbeat roles, his chilly, internalised characterisations were out of step with the prevailing, emotive Method approach: \"He was full of invention,\" says Jacques Lessard, his professor and co-founder of Thétre Repère, \"But the reproach we were always throwing at him was: 'Use your emotions, Robert, use your emotions.' He was very shy of his inner life.\"\n\nOn graduation, this understated style was even less attractive to potential mainstream theatres: \"All the others were offered roles in Quebec starting the following season,\" remembers Fréchette. \"Robert and I were the only two who received no roles, no contracts. We asked each other 'So what now?'\" The only option seemed to be to found their own company, which was christened Theatre Hummm... after a well-known Canadian comic strip.\n\nThe first productions, which bore little relation to the rich visual tapestries now considered to be Lepage's trademark, were all produced on a shoestring, with sets and props assembled from flea-markets and rubbish tips, and performed in tiny cafe venues. However, the Lepage improvisational approach was already well-developed, built on the ideas of one of his conservatory teachers, Marc Doré, who had studied with the mime and movement authority Jacques Lecoq, and reinforced by a trip to Paris in 1974 to attend a three -week workshop with Swiss practitioner Alain Knapp: \"The scripts were rarely ever finalised,\" says Fréchette, \"we would always let ourselves improve the final product, find other options, new lines.\" This fluid, open-ended approach was applied to early pieces such as L'attaque quotidienne in 1979, an interweaving series of sketches cultivated from lurid newspaper headlines, and, a year later, Saturday Night Taxi, stories spun from a late night taxi run.\n\nGradually, the company began to generate a cult following among Quebec audiences, eventually attracting the attention of Jacques Lessard, who had set up Thétre Repère to implement the theory of intuitive creativity formulated by 60s design guru Lawrence Halprin, known as the RSVP (Resources, Score, reVised, Performed) Cycle. \"It never worked with the audience and they lost a lot money,\" says Lepage. \"They were about to close the company, which had $50 left in the bank. Richard Fréchette and I had never had that much to stage a show. So we said, 'Why don't you give us that fifty bucks and work with us?'\" The result, in 1982, was a show called En Attendant , based on a conversation Lepage overheard on a train, but which grew into an exploration of the limbo state in which artists find themselves while waiting for a break.\n\nThe success of the show, which was performed with the aid of a few flashlights and three suitcases, would have a profound effect on Lepage. \"Up to that point I was sure that I didn't have any kind of place in this society,\" he says. \"I had no pretension, no ambition, no plan.\" Suddenly, invitations to perform throughout Canada began pouring in, precipitating the need for a form of theatre that could appeal across the country's linguistic boundaries, which remains the central impulse of Lepage's visual style and imagistic inclinations.\n\nThe next show, Circulations, in 1984, the story of a young Canadian woman travelling to New York to unravel her tangled family history, was presented one third in English and one third in French. However, most significant was the third element of what was billed as a \"trilingual\" production that was communicated through movement and imagery, including a hallucinogenic scene of communal dope-smoking seen first straight on, and then from above, \"from the point of view of the moon\" with the spaced-out characters lying flat on the stage, so the audience were looking down on their heads.\n\nBut it was in the next original piece, a six-hour immersion in Chinese culture called the Dragons' Trilogy, that Lepage's visual flair would really emerge. \"During the tour of Circulations, we spent a lot of time in Canadian Chinatowns,\" says Lepage of the basic premise. \"I was fascinated by the idea that you can cross the road and enter this dream world, this vision of China.\"\n\nOnce he had assembled his cast in the rehearsal rooms, Lepage mixed in some of his own family folklore, the tale of a grand-uncle who became so indebted to Chinese gamblers that he was forced to barter his pregnant daughter. \"Robert just told us this very basic concept,\" says actress and long-time Lepage collaborator Marie Brassard. \"There were six of us coming from very different backgrounds and every person started to bring ideas, thoughts, objects, and concepts which would go from Tintin In China to The Blue Lotus to Taoist philosophy. So, by putting these things together we had a very strange melting pot. No one had been to China so we had a naive vision. But we decided to use our ignorance.\"\n\nThe resulting landmark show, first premiered in 1985, begins as two French-Canadian women trace their personal histories through the labyrinth of Quebec's Chinatown, now razed to accommodate a parking lot. Throughout the darting narrative, full of swirling juxtapositions, the sand-strewn set produced visions of Chinese laundries, opium dens, gambling halls. \"When I first saw it in Toronto last year, I compared [Lepage] to the young Peter Brook,\" wrote Irving Wardle when the Trilogy reached London in 1987. \"Given the show's subsequent growth I would like to amend that comparison to the mature Peter Brook.\"\n\nLepage scaled back for his following two pieces: his first one-man show Vinci, in 1986, about a photographer who embarks on a cultural odyssey across Europe after being devastated by a friend's suicide; and, a year later, Polygraph. The latter was a powerful three-hander that examined the brutal murder and rape in 1980 of an actress, France Lachapelle, who had been part of Theatre Hummm's creative circle.\n\nLepage found the body, had initially been the police's prime suspect and was forced to take a polygraph test, the results of which he was never told. Only when the real killer, a numerology-obsessed psychopath named Christian Gagnon, came clean two years, two months and two days after the murder, did suspicion lift. The resulting theatre work revolves around an attempt, also entirely true, by a Quebecois filmmaker called Yves Simoneau to make a movie about the murder, in which the script's homicidal leading character disguises himself with false eyebrows and a wig. \"Polygraph was an act of mourning, a way to untangle very, very dark feelings about that event,\" Lepage says. \"But it was also about filmmaking, about the ethics of telling a true story.\"\n\nHowever, in 1988, Lepage revisited the wider visual canvas of the Trilogy with a new show called Tectonic Plates: \"It was to be about the drift of the continents,\" says Marie Gignac. \"Robert had this idea about the continents drifting to the music of Chopin. So, we all went away and read about Chopin and George Sand and the show began to grow.\" Initially, Lepage's preternatural talent for conjunction seemed to have deserted him, and improvisations produced five entirely distinct and independent storylines. Only after incendiary cast conflicts and savage cutting were these narratives dragged through Lepage's swimming-pool set to form a theatrical tour-de-force that was finally seen at the Cottesloe in 1992, traversing a soggy art auction, the canals of Venice and the highlands of Scotland.\n\nThe fractious process of Tectonic Plates was reflected in the bitter divisions that were now running through Thétre Repère, which had essentially split into two companies along the personal fault-lines of its co-founders: \"Jacques decided to do classics, and the result was quite heavy and very unsuccessful,\" says Lepage. \"We always ended up on the small side of the budget and we were the ones promoting the company around the world.\"\n\nLessard in turn felt that Lepage had become intoxicated by his success: \"Robert for me changed a lot since he became very well known,\" he says. \"He was much more communicative than he is now. Back then, we were really working together - we didn't care what name would go out in the press, we didn't worry what critics would say. We would just do things.\" After an abortive attempt to force Lessard to resign, Lepage finally abandoned the company in 1989.\n\nBy now, after the critical canonisation that followed London premieres of the Dragons' Trilogy, Polygraph, Vinci, Needles And Opiums and Tectonic Plates, invitations to direct were flooding in from all round the world. However, the transition from working with a close-knit \"family\" of collaborators to employing regular professional actors was less than seamless, as highlighted by his infamous mud-caked Midsummer Night's Dream at the National in 1992, which earned scathing reviews and a chorus of complaints from the cast, who spent most of the evening immersed in the ooze: \"There was a lot of concern about sloshing around in the water,\" says Sally Dexter, \"not so much in the beginning, but as time went on. In the midst of doing it, people got pretty pissed off.\" Or as Timothy Spall, who played Bottom, rather lyrically put it: \"I'm still picking the mud out of me arse.\"\n\nAt 32, Lepage was also offered one of Canadian theatre's most prestigious posts, head of French Theatre at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, which he held, in the face of slash-and-burn funding cuts, until 1993. Shortly afterwards, he began work on his first film, The Confessional, which combines Alfred Hitchcock's arrival in Quebec to film I Confess with the death of Lepage's father in 1993.\n\nThe only entirely original stage work from this period was the spectacular one-man show Needles And Opium in 1991, which intermingled stories of love and addiction from the lives of Jean Cocteau and Miles Davis with an account of the meltdown of one of Lepage's own long-term relationships. However, during the Chicago leg of the tour of Needles And Opium in 1994, Lepage's personal life took a new turn in the shape of Kevin McCoy: \"I went to a workshop led by Robert,\" McCoy remembers, \"When I look back on it, I think I knew that something was up when we said hello that morning, the first time we made eye contact. Luckily, we met later at a party given by the International Theatre Festival of Chicago. The next day, we went to dinner, and the rest is, as you say, history. It was both a simple and momentous beginning.\"\n\nAfter a long-distance courtship, McCoy moved to Quebec in 1997, and now writes and performs in French: \"When I moved to Quebec, I knew two words of French: 'bonjour' and 'merci',\" he says. \"In retrospect, it has taken me a bit longer than I had hoped to become truly fluent. I wanted to speak with Robert in his native language.\"\n\nIn 1994, Lepage's professional life also saw a new departure with the founding of his company Ex Machina, housed in La Caserne, an old Quebec fire station converted into a hi-tech performance centre. The first show to be produced under the Ex Machina umbrella was Seven Streams Of The River Ota, inspired by a trip that Lepage made to Hiroshima the previous year, and in particular by the guide who led him through the city: \"I learned on the last day of my visit that he himself was a hibakusha , a survivor of the bomb. He explained that the first things to be rebuilt in Hiroshima were the two bridges. The city was built on the seven streams of the river Ota, and so it was important to establish transport links.\n\n\"But what's interesting is that they built a Yin bridge and a Yang bridge, one with phallic shapes and the other with vaginal shapes. For life to return to Hiroshima, they had to provide the city with sexual organs so that one half could couple with the other. At night, with the bridges covered in car lights, you would think that you are witnessing a seminal exchange.\"\n\nWith just this central conflict between nuclear destruction and fecundity, Lepage again assembled his actors and began to tease out storylines. But by the Edinburgh premiere in 1994, the show was still in its raw state: \"It was such a catastrophe,\" says Marie Brassard. \"We were not ready. Some of the scenes were not even written. We were improvising in front of the audience maybe a third of the whole show.\" Lepage, however, braved the blistering reviews and continued to refine the show through rehearsal and performance.\n\nIt wasn't until a year later, when a Canadian TV presenter sent Lepage documentary footage from post-war Japan, that the director stumbled on the central plot-line of the piece: a US military photographer sent to Hiroshima to assess damage who impregnates a young Japanese widow en route. Years later, the Japanese son happens to find himself in the same Greenwich Village boarding house as his American brother, setting the action in motion.\n\n\"I was among those who found the first version of this show incoherent and self-indulgent,\" critic Charles Spencer concluded, when it arrived at the National in 1996, \"but this amazing production, radically revised and extended over the past two years, lays such doubts to rest. At its marvellous best, Seven Streams creates a rapt spell of mesmerising intensity.\"\n\nDespite the relative calm that has descended on Lepage's life since Seven Streams, he has, in the meantime, managed to produce two original shows: Elsinore, his ill-fated one man Hamlet, beset with technical difficulties that led to the cancellation of its Edinburgh premiere; and The Geometry Of Miracles in 1999, based on the Russian mystic Georgi Gurdjieff. Even now, his schedule remains punishing: his production of Berlioz's Damnation Of Faust has just premiered in Paris, a work centring on Frida Kahlo should surface in Canada later this year, and a collaboration with Peter Gabriel called Zulu Time will arrive at the Roundhouse early next year.\n\nBut it is difficult not to notice an unmistakably reflective, introspective inclination in his new show, The Far Side Of The Moon, a thinly fictionalised account of two brothers coming to terms with the death of their mother, channelled through the unlikely thematic conduit of the Soviet space programme. \"I spent a year researching this thing,\" he says, \"And at the same time my mother dies and I have to deal with this new reality that both my parents are dead. I see that all these things are connected. That whole moon theme and feeling that you are drifting if you lose your parents - all these elements come crashing into one another.\"\n\nThe result of these thematic collisions, is vintage Lepage, a combination of personal reminiscence and mental acrobatics culminating in the lone Lepage floating across the stage at the end of the piece. \"I don't think there is any kind of magic about what I do,\" he says. \"All of the connections are there, somewhere in the subconscious or in the collective unconscious. If I let the elements speak to each other, then these coincidences will happen. And they do happen. They happen all the time.\"\n\nBorn: December 12 1957, Quebec city, Canada.\n\nEducation: St-Martyrs Canadiens Primary School; Joseph-François Perreault High School; Conservatoire d'Art Dramatique du Québec\n\nProductions: L'attaque quotidienne, 1979; Saturday Night Taxi '80; En Attendant '82; Circulations '84; The Dragons' Trilogy '85; Vinci '86; Polygraph '87; Tectonic Plates '88; Needles And Opium '91; Midsummer Night's Dream '92; Seven Streams Of The River Ota '94-96; Elsinore '96; Geometry Of Miracles, '99; The Far Side Of The Moon 2001.\n\nFilms: Le Confessionnal 1995); Le Polygraphe '96; N '98), Possible Worlds (2000)."
