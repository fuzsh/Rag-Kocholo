There have been repairs and adaptations over the years.\n\nThe internationally regarded theatre and film artist, who was born in 1957, lived in the apartment building as a child with his extended family. The Lepages were working class people who lived in the Uppertown part of Quebec between the Citadel and the Plains of Abraham and the Parc des Braves, which celebrates the Battle of Sainte-Foy in 1760.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nTotal recall: Robert Lepage explores memory in a new one-man show Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

At the time, poor people lived in what was known as Lowertown in Quebec.\n\nâWe should have lived in Lowertown, but we could afford Uppertown because my grandmother was living with us and we had people living with us who could pay for the apartment.â\n\nIt was very close to where all the politicians lived, he added.\n\nThus, the area is full of memories for Lepage: historical, political (he lived there from the start of the Quiet Revolution through to the October Crisis of 1970) and deeply personal.\n\nThose years have been turned into a touring meditation on memory by Lepage that runs at the National Arts Centre from April 12 to 18. Most performances will be in French but shows on April 15 and 18 will have English surtitles. He has done other one-man shows over his long and illustrious career: the others include Needles and Opium, Elsinore, The Far Side of the Moon, and The Andersen Project.\n\nIn 887, Lepage directs himself, but, he says, heâs never really alone. There are many people who work with him. Speaking of remembering things, he doesnât have an official prompter, but he has a pretend one in the show to underscore the actorâs craft.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nâThe theme of memory kind of pops up naturally when you pass 50,â he says. âWhen you are in the theatre, memory is everything. You become fascinated by mechanisms. How do I better learn my lines, for example?\n\nâBut also you start to bump into more and more people who have cognitive problems, forms of dementia. You become more and more conscious of the whole memory thing.â\n\nThat awareness extended to an interest in how the brain works and how memory works.\n\nâMy approach at first was an intellectual one and the more I dug into the matter it forced me to go back to my very first memory and why. I have this obsessive question about why donât I have any memory of important stuff, stuff that is essential, but I still remember the opening lyrics of Gilliganâs Island. Why is that?â\n\nThat question sent him tapping into the 1960s. These were important years for Quebec politically. The very young and growing social and political evolution of Quebec society mirrored Lepageâs own growing awareness of the world around him. He was 12 when the October Crisis happened.\n\nHe says he never intended the show to be about political and historical memory, but it was, he admits, almost an inevitability. Lepage understands all too well that Quebec culture or Canadian culture is built on memory, that at times can be faulty or incomplete or, indeed, selective.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nâYou allow it in because I witnessed it as a kid, not as a mature adult.â The child can only âmeasure the impacts of these things on his family and his neighbourhood, what he knows.â\n\nEven the very street names are ways for people to remember events and people. For example, Lepageâs childhood home on avenue Murray brushes up Gen. James Murray, who served under Wolfe and was the first British governor of Quebec. Murray, perhaps surprisingly for an agent of the conquering British crown, allowed the continuance of French civil law and was seen as favouring francophones over British merchants, something that eventually led to his recall.\n\nUnlike some of his more elaborate productions, 887, he says, is âquite simply done. The show is more a play on scale.â\n\nLepage, who is always travelling the world, it seems, says he was influenced by a museum in Osaka, Japan, which had an exhibition on perceptions about the past. The further back in time, the smaller the displays were.\n\nâAs you changed rooms featuring a more recent, better known past, the models got bigger.\n\nâIn 887 â¦ if you vaguely remember something, itâs very tiny. You have a camera actually to see it,â he says. âOther stuff is more life-sized because they are easier to grasp.â\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAfter many months, has his memory improved?\n\nâNot necessarily,â he quipped.\n\nThis show has been seen in France and in Edinburgh, Scotland, then in Toronto. He has performed it in English, Italian (in Rome) and in French. Now it is coming home.\n\nAfter Ottawa, the play will travel to Montreal to the Theatre du Nouveau Monde for a long run from April 26 until June 8. And then itâs on to Quebec in the fall. The tension of working in other places and in other languages is going away as he gets closer to home.\n\nAfter Quebec, the play will go on another extended tour next year. But thatâs not all heâs doing. Lepage is also touring in a production of the play Quills, which is about the last days of the Marquis de Sade. Lepage has the starring role, and, even more lines to remember.\n\n887\n\nRobert Lepage\n\nPresented in French. With English surtitles on April 15 and 18.\n\nWhen: April 12-18.\n\nWhere: NAC Theatre\n\nTickets: Starting at $39; nac-cna.ca\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
