        "text": "What got you started?\n\nI studied as an actor at the theatre conservatoire in Quebec, but by the time I got to my third year I was more interested in directing. There's more to it than helping actors get round a stage: it's a wonderful way of telling stories.\n\nWhat have you sacrificed for your art?\n\nA sense of home. Directing has meant moving away from my loved ones. So when I founded Ex Machina, in 1995, I wanted to find us a place in Quebec City that we could call home.\n\nWhat's the greatest threat to theatre?\n\nThe \"me, myself and I\" culture that comes with pagers, Facebook and mobile phones. When I directed the Ring cycle at the Metropolitan Opera in New York recently, there were people texting all through the show. But theatre isn't a communication device, it's a communion.\n\nWhat advice would you give a young director?\n\nDon't be a control freak. You're just the captain of the ship – the wind and the tides decide where it goes.\n\nHow have new technologies been good for theatre?\n\nBy making theatre a more sensuous world: it's incredibly exciting to see live performers trigger projections or sounds. People forget that theatre itself came out of an innovation: fire. The moment we made a bonfire and sat around it telling stories, we had theatre.\n\nYou have worked extensively in opera. Should it try to broaden its appeal?\n\nYes. Opera needs a major makeover; the large opera houses are too in thrall to their conservative patrons. Opera should be a place for art forms to meet. I've worked a lot with Peter Gabriel; his music isn't operatic, but he creates big, popular gatherings to which architecture, dance and music are all invited.\n\nIs there anything about your career you regret?\n\nThe period I spent making films in the 1990s. I was terrible at applying for funding – I hated having to explain my artistic practice to a civil servant.\n\nWhat's your favourite film?\n\nRumble Fish. Francis Ford Coppola made it just after The Godfather, when you'd think he should have been more interested in commercial stuff. Instead he made this very experimental, poetic, black-and-white movie.\n\nWhat one song would work as the soundtrack to your life?\n\nSupper's Ready by Genesis, from the 1972 album Foxtrot, because it's full of craziness, and it just goes on and on.\n\nCV\n\nBorn: Quebec, 1957.\n\nCareer: Productions include 1984 at the ROH (2005), and the Anderson Project. He directs a new Cirque de Soleil show, Totem, at the Royal Albert Hall, London, from 5 January to 17 February; see cirquedusoleil.com.\n\nHigh point: \"Doing The Far Side of the Moon in 2000. lLike turning a corner after a period of despair.\"\n\nLow point: \"The mid-90s. I spread myself too thinly and everything came out half-baked.\""
