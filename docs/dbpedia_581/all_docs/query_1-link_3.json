        "text": "Robert LePage by Beth Devonald\n\n“drawn plays in which the characters are transformed, but also to plays in which the sets are transformed and matter is transcended. It’s incredible to be able to travel through time and place, to infinity, all on a single stage. It’s the metamorphosis brought about on stage that makes this kind of travel possible … I think that if I remain fully aware of the stage as a place of physical transformation, I make it possible or can try to make it possible for the audience to really feel the direction in which the action and the characters are being hurtled.”[2]\n\nKey Facts:\n\nRobert Lepage is a director, playwright and actor\n\nBorn in Quebec 1957\n\nWorking since the eighties, beginning with a company called Théâtre Repère\n\nArtistic Director of the Théâtre français at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa 1989- 1993\n\nHe has a multi-disciplinary production company called Ex Machina which started in 1994\n\nRehearsal process:\n\nMorning- Everyone works together. They talk about structure and take part in improvisation.\n\nAfternoon- The actors take the afternoon off. This time is used by the technicians to start to undertake research from all the ideas that have been created in the morning. Prototypes are also created in this time.\n\nEvening- At this point the actors come back into work and begin to use the research and prototypes to continue developing ideas.\n\nTime Scale- 8 weeks of rehearsal spaced out over a year. This is to allow time for unconscious creative decisions to be made.\n\nPublic rehearsals- Half way through the process, Lepage opens rehearsals to the public to gain feedback from audiences. The feedback and altering process continues until the show is finished. The ‘final product’ or version of a show only happens on the final night of a performance.\n\nRobert Lepage is known not only as a director of theatre, but of film. This film influence can be seen in his work and in the multi-disciplinary productions of his company Ex Machina. Here, performing recorded arts are combined and used in productions of plays and performances. When creating work, Lepage places value in the collaboration of multiple disciplines. This allows actors, designers and technicians to create performance together in collaboration. Therefore, this collaboration creates work with a distinctive characteristic, often influenced by cinema.\n\nThe devising process used by Lepage begins with a phase where the performers work as solo artists. In this part of the process they bring their own material into the rehearsal and choose an individual starting point such as a song or a word that drives them. The next phase allows for the performers to explore the themes of the performance to develop an emotional approach to the material. This is achieved through improvisation and the exploration of resources. Next a decision is made as to what material from this they should keep. Finally, the director (Lepage) has the final say in what should be kept how how it sould be arranged in the final composition.\n\nAnother characteristic of Lepage’s work is ritual and change. As evident in his rehearsal process, his work is forever ongoing, changing and developing. This transformative element of the work that Lepage creates, can be seen in the mise-en-scene of some of his productions. Throughout the run of his performances the mise-en-scene is constantly reworked and edited with influence of the experiences of both the performers and audience members. In this way, Lepage’s devised theatre is one in a constant state of transformation.\n\n‘Christopher Innes comments that the aim of Ex Machina: is to explore new ways of devising pieces by bringing creative technicians, including video artists and engineers together with actors, musicians and directors from widely different places and traditions. In this post-industrial, post-national, post-human formula Lepage has become the poster-artist for aggressive post-modernism.’[3]\n\nBibliography/ Further reading list:\n\nAnon, ‘ExMachina’ <http://lacaserne.net/index2.php/robertlepage/> [accessed 12th April 2017]\n\nBanff Centre for Arts and Creativity, Playwright and Director Robert Lepage’s Unique Creative Style, online video recording, Youtube, 14 July 2015, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMGPzuF7B_Q&t=21s&gt; [accessed 12th April 2017]\n\nBrayshaw Teresa, Witts Noel, ‘Robert Lepage in discussion’ in Brayshaw Teresa, Witts Noel ed, The twentieth century performance reader, (Hoboken, Taylor and Francis, 2013)\n\nDundjerović, Aleksandar Saša, Theatricality of Robert Lepage, (McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2007)\n\n‘Needle and Opium 2015’, Robert Lepage Photos, ExMachina Website, <http://lacaserne.net//index2.php/exmachina/gallery/robertlepage/#id=album-19&num=content-312&gt; [14/04/2017]\n\nWoycicki, P, Post cinematic theatre and Performance, (UK, Palgrave Macmillan, 2004)\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1]‘Needle and Opium 2015’, Robert Lepage Photos, ExMachina Website, <http://lacaserne.net//index2.php/exmachina/gallery/robertlepage/#id=album-19&num=content-312&gt; [14/04/2017]\n\n[2] Lepage, Robert in Dundjerović, Aleksandar Saša, Theatricality of Robert Lepage (McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2007) Pg.24"
