        "text": "Crease:\n\nMy name is Robert Crease, and I’m interviewing Tom Kinoshita. And it is January 9th, 2016. I would first like to ask you some questions about your childhood. Can you tell me about your parents?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMy parents—let’s see. My father was a middle school teacher, of English.\n\nCrease:\n\nWhat kind of education did he have?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHe graduated from Waseda University in Tokyo. Actually, he majored in French, but there were no jobs for French teachers, [laugh] so he taught English.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd your mother?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMy mother was just a housewife.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd where were you born?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nTokyo, when my father was still a student at Waseda University.\n\nCrease:\n\nAt one point, your uncle came into your life. What happened?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nPardon?\n\nCrease:\n\nYour uncle. You were adopted by your uncle?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s a very complicated story. [laugh] You see, my father was the youngest son. My uncle was the first boy, and my father was the youngest. And their ages, I don’t know exactly, but they were something like more than 15 years apart. And my uncle didn’t have any children. And so, my grandparents decided to sort of—my father becoming the—what do you call—succeed my uncle.\n\nCrease:\n\nThe father would inherit the—the person who inherits everything?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nActually, it’s more complicated. [laugh] See, my uncle probably didn’t have anything beyond a middle school education. And he in the household was a kind of farmer. So, my grandparents owned pretty much rice field. And then they decided to split this land into two, one piece inherited by my uncle, and the other one, by my father. However, since my father was a schoolteacher, the inheritance was supposed to come only after he retired from school teaching. And, of course, that didn’t happen for quite a while. On the other hand, my grandparents worried about what would happens after my father passed away, so I became the heir of both my uncle and my father. That was set-up without me, but somehow [laugh]—and my grandmother wanted to keep me near her, and so after the first six years with my parents—after I went to nursery school and so on— in the first grade of elementary school I was moved to my uncle’s and my grandmother’s house, away from my parents. And then I stayed in that situation through elementary school, which is six years, and then middle school, which is another five years. Then I entered something called high school (in Japan), which is actually junior college (in U.S. terms). That was in, I think, 1942.\n\nCrease:\n\nWell, wait a minute—’42, you were in college. But what about your secondary school, your high school?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHigh school is from—five years before that. The system is different from the American system. It’s more like a German system, gymnasium and so on. So, I had six years of elementary school, five years of middle school, and then went to so-called high school, which is actually now part of the Tokyo University. I was supposed to graduate high school in ‘45, but since this was during the war time, the curriculum was sort of compressed, and the first-year of curriculum was taken in a half year, and the second year was another half year. So, I went to Tokyo University in ‘44.\n\nCrease:\n\nInteresting. This secondary school, which you say was kind of a junior college—\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, no, no. Middle school, secondary school, which is equivalent of the high school here, more or less.\n\nCrease:\n\nDid you have to take a test to enter?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOf course. Every step, we have to take exam.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what was the name?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWhich school?\n\nCrease:\n\nThe secondary school and then the…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThere are two so-called high school. One is a secondary school, and that’s five years. And then another three years of so-called high school, which is the junior college.\n\nCrease:\n\nDid they have names, both of these?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nDaiichi High School. The first high school.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd the second one?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, no, that’s the second one.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh. [laugh]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYou see, the secondary school—first of all, I grew up with my grandmother’s family, and this was a rural area. It was in a small village. And my elementary school was a very small school with 40 to 50 students at each grade. Then I entered the secondary school, middle school, for five years, which was actually school of the prefecture, a larger area. The prefecture is called Tottori.\n\nCrease:\n\nTottori. How do you spell that?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nT-O-T-T-O-R-I.\n\nCrease:\n\nThat’s the prefec…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nPrefecture. And actually the city’s name is also Tottori. The population of the city is about 50K, which is not a big city, but it was about 10% of the population of the prefecture. And the city is about 200 miles or kilometers west of Kyoto. It’s not very far from Hiroshima, actually. Now the second stage of high school is a national…\n\nCrease:\n\nAh, OK. And that was Daiichi?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nDaiichi. Because some national colleges were numbered from Daiichi which is number one, to number eight.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, Daiichi was Japan’s number one high school.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHighest—most difficult place to get into.\n\nCrease:\n\nYes, and you got into it.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nDo you remember the test at all?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYou see, you can apply to the university after fourth grade in this secondary school. Which I was not clearly prepared for the next level [laugh] so I failed that test. And I still remember the math problem [laugh] which failed me. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nWhat was it?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIt was a geometrical problem. And it’s—you see, you have some kind of strange polygon, and you want to attach it to a, let’s say, two-meter-wide road outside. And, of course, the shape is very strange, and of course unless you see the answer right away, you waste all the time. The point is at the corner, if you take just a straight line, it’s no longer two-meter-wide edge. You have to make it circle, and then it’s much easier to calculate right away. [laugh] And so somehow this problem sort of threw me over. [laugh] And I failed to pass the test.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut you passed it the next time around?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNext time around, I was very [laugh] prepared. In fact, I was so well prepared I think that I came in at the head of the class. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you entered there in ‘42. Am I getting this right?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. That’s right. And it was few months after Japan started the war with the U.S. and other nations.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what was it like going to school during the wartime?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nTokyo was bombed sometime in, maybe, May of 1942 for the first time. And this is just a few months after I entered this school. Our school was slightly away from the military zone, and so we are spared, I think. But anyway, every so often there was an air raid, and then you had to stop doing something, and go into the shelter, and so on.\n\nCrease:\n\nDid you have to walk to school and back?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo. There was a dormitory. And, in fact, at this school, everybody had to stay in the dormitory. So, there was no problem as far as getting to school. [laugh] Of course, the other problem was that food became less and less available.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you went hungry?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNot that hungry, but clearly the food quality went down.\n\nCrease:\n\nDidn’t you tell me once that you ate too many pumpkins?\n\nKinoshita:\n\n[laugh] Sweet potatoes.\n\nCrease:\n\nSweet potatoes. That’s right. So, the only thing that would grow well in those conditions was sweet potatoes?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. Well, but still, it’s not too bad. It became worse and worse [laugh] as it went on.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you went to that school from ‘42 to ‘45.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, that was the intention. But because of the war, everything had to be accelerated so that they could put the young men into the field as soon as possible. So, the school was actually cut to two and a half years: ’42 to summer of ’44.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, did you learn any science in the school?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. The courses were not curtailed. We had a full course load—physics, chemistry, biology, and so on.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd did you know any—had you met Nambu yet?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, much later.\n\nCrease:\n\nDid you meet any physicists, people who later became physicists, in that high school?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAt this stage, no.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd any good teachers?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWell, I suppose they are good teachers, but—well, let me go back to elementary school. They had a small, tiny library, just something like this stuff [his home bookshelves], in the elementary school. I read a book there—probably I read all of them [laugh]. What I particularly remember is a book on Thomas Edison, and also Marconi, and they were very impressive to me. I wanted to be some kind of scientist at that stage.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, already in elementary school.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. And then secondary school. Now, that school was in the Tottori city, and I had to walk about 4 kilometers to the secondary school. Going through the city streets they of course had bookstores, and so I would stop at the bookstores and look at the books, and there was a book by Einstein and Infeld; translated into Japanese.\n\nCrease:\n\nThat’s the famous Einstein-Infeld book.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. And that was when I was at this middle school. And so, I bought that book in Japanese translation. But anyway, that’s the first serious book I learned from. And then there is another book which is the Dubois (Daniel M.) book on quantum mechanics, translated also into Japanese. So, I got exposed to the idea [laugh] of relativity and quantum mechanics when I was probably in seventh grade equivalent, or eighth grade, maybe. So, I sort of was naturally oriented [laugh] to physics or something. Not very explicitly so, but that’s where my interest was pointing.\n\nCrease:\n\nAlready, yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYou see, our textbooks in middle school were not very sophisticated, so I didn’t pay much attention. The teacher was not very good. [laugh] But on my own, I studied a lot of them. So, I have pretty good idea. I think Einstein visited Japan around that time.\n\nCrease:\n\nIn the late ‘30s, then?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, that’s right. And, of course, that’s how I got the name of Einstein.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, when you were in your second high school, the accelerated one, you graduated when? In mid-1944?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nCrease:\n\nWhy weren’t you drafted into the military?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI guess I’m not strong enough. Anyway, I had to take the exam to be drafted, and I was fortunately dropped. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nDo you know why you were dropped?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI don’t know.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you didn’t go into the military?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nCrease:\n\nNow, Nambu went into the military?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYes. I’ll come back to that later, since I got to know him only after 1946.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you graduated in mid-1944.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. And then went into Tokyo University. And then as I probably wrote somewhere, Tokyo University should take three years, too. But because of the war situation, it was compressed into essentially one and a half. And then you would be drafted. Actually, mostly physics graduates were not really bad off, because they are drafted to work in some lab in the army or navy or something of that sort. But my classmates in the other parts of the university or Daiichi High School, specializing in literature and other non-scientific stuff, most of them were drafted into the service, and many of them passed away during the war.\n\nCrease:\n\nDid you want to go into the military? No?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you were glad that you weren’t drafted?\n\nKinoshita:\n\n[laugh] That’s right. The chance of being killed was probably better than 50% when you went into army.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, I forgot to ask you—did you have brothers or sisters?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI had one brother, just behind me. He went to—actually, the rest of my family lived in a separate city, because I was in a strange situation for the inheritance problem. And so, I lived in the Tottori city area. Another city in Tottori prefecture called Yonago, was where my father was a teacher, and my brother and sisters grew up there. But my brother was two years younger than I, and he was pretty good, too, and he went into the First High School, too. You see, this is a very competitive—most competitive [laugh] school in Japan. In the entrance exam, usually one person in ten would be admitted. And actually, the quality of applicant was the best in the country. [laugh] So, one in ten is really very hard to achieve.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what happened to your brother?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIn the second year or third year of school, he got TB, and he died soon afterwards.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh. What was his name?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nTadayuki.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, he never had any children or…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, no. Not at all. He was still maybe 19 or 20 years old when he died. And then I have three sisters. They all survived, and they have their own children. We send New Year’s cards every year, more or less, but that’s the only contact we have with them.\n\nCrease:\n\nThey’re younger than you are?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAll of them are younger. The youngest is probably 15 years younger than I.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you entered Tokyo University in mid-1944?\n\nKinoshita:\n\n‘44.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what was that like in the middle of the war?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAs I said, the military wanted to get them to graduate as soon as possible. So, the entire first-year curriculum was taken in the Fall of ‘44, and then the second-year curriculum was taken in the Spring of ‘45. And then it went into summertime. Then the war ended. So, suddenly we had no reason to accelerate the curriculum. On the other hand, Tokyo was very badly bombed out, and so housing was very scarce, and the food rationing system, which was established during the war sort of collapsed, and so you couldn’t get anything to eat. So, you had to survive anyway you could. For instance, many people exchanged expensive clothes with a potato from nearby farmers. And, of course, this doesn’t last too long so [laugh] it’s a really bad situation. Let’s see. And then…\n\nCrease:\n\nWait. First, when the atomic bombs went off in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, how far away were you?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nActually, as I said, my parents lived in Yonago, which is right north of Hiroshima, but beyond the mountain range. So, we didn’t see anything. Only on the radio or newspaper we heard that Hiroshima was flattened.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd did you understand what had flattened it?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nSure.\n\nCrease:\n\nYou understood the idea of an atomic bomb?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI knew what atomic energy can do, so I thought immediately this must be an A-bomb. So, I’m not sure newspaper said that, but I thought it cannot be an ordinary bomb, [laugh] anyway.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, where were you as that happened? Were you still in Tokyo at the university?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, as I said, I was visiting my—this is the summer.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, the summer, that’s right. Sorry.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nVacation time. So, I was visiting my parents’ house.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd so Todai was then closed after that, the university?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you stayed at your parents’ house, then?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMore or less, yes. Yeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what did you do during that time?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nRead books.\n\nCrease:\n\n[laugh]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI read a lot of books during that time, like Dirac’s book on quantum mechanics, and also Weyl’s book on group theory and quantum mechanics. I read also the book of Eddington on relativity. So yeah, whatever I could get my hands on, I read during this time.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd is this when you said you grew not to like sweet potatoes because they were the only thing that you could eat?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nDid I say that? [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nI think I remember you saying that. Was it sweet potatoes or pumpkins? I forget which.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYes. If you have to eat pumpkin or something every day and night, you become [laugh] sort of—if you have to eat it, you eat it, but you don’t like it. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nNow, were these the good pumpkins? There’s good Japanese pumpkins called kabocha.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, kabocha is a good pumpkin, but it’s more expensive. The pumpkins which can be grown more easily are not as tasty.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, Todai is closed until the end of December. Then you resumed in January of ‘46.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s right, January of ‘46. Well, actually it’s more complicated than that. [laugh] When A-bomb hit Hiroshima, I think that’s about August 10th or 11th or something like that.\n\nCrease:\n\nAugust 7th and 9th—or 6th—the 7th or 10th or 6th or 9th depending upon what date—where you draw the date.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, probably 6th or 7th. And I don’t remember exactly why, but I went back to Tokyo very soon after that. Even before the war ended. You have been to Tokyo?\n\nCrease:\n\nYes.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYou know Shinjuku Station?\n\nCrease:\n\nYes.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI was at Shinjuku Station to change to the different line, and then they broadcast announcement that said, “Please listen. There’s an important announcement going to be made in a few minutes” or something of that sort. And the emperor gave a talk. So, [laugh] I was at the Shinjuku Station.\n\nCrease:\n\nHad you ever heard the emperor over the radio before?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, this was very unusual?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what did it say, the broadcast?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWell, he said, “Japan surrender, but don’t disturb the order” and so on. And “Accept occupation force” and so on. Anyway, my feeling is that, “Wow, that’s good.” [laugh] So, I don’t have to die. [laugh] And, of course, in Shinjuku Station, it’s full of people, and most people seems to be relaxed after hearing that.\n\nCrease:\n\nInteresting.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOf course, not everybody does, but some people. Or most of the people that I could see across the station were not particularly mad at anybody [laugh]. Well, they are all tired of the war. That’s true.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, where were you heading towards, that you were changing stations at Shinjuku? Where were you going to? The University?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo. Actually, I’m going back to the house I’m staying, which is actually a house of a cousin of my father. And I stayed there for, let’s see, I’m not quite sure what—before I graduate from Tokyo University in the summer of ‘47. That means my senior year lasted one and a half years because of the acceleration on the first and second years.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you decelerated the last year? The senior year you said took—\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo. What I’m saying is that the last year lasted more than one and a half year, which should be normally one year, so I could start working on a research project half a year earlier than normal. And that was a great advantage to me, because then I could start my thesis work or thesis-related work pretty fast. Anyway, I was ready to do something [laugh] at the beginning of ‘46. And as I said, I asked Professor Kodaira to be my advisor.\n\nCrease:\n\nKodaira, yes. You said he was the mathematical physicist.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd you said he was very influential on you.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. In fact, you may not know, but he was first recipient of the Field Prize.\n\nCrease:\n\nI did not know that. Huh.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nSo, he was really an excellent mathematician. Of course, we didn’t know that. He received the prize around late 1950s.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, what did you take that first—oh, so he was your teacher at the university?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYes.\n\nCrease:\n\nWhich semester?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis is beginning of 1946 when I return to the Tokyo University.\n\nCrease:\n\nJanuary of ‘46.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYes.\n\nCrease:\n\nYou say there were no more formal courses to take.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s right. Because the first two years’ course were already taken.\n\nCrease:\n\nWere taken. So, you had a year and a half to do a research project without having to—so you got started really early.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd you worked with Kodaira.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd the Kodaira seminar, which is what you talk about here. Now, were you teaching at the same time?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAt that point, I was not teaching. I was still a student. But I am not completely sure what—I did in fact do some teaching at a different university. It’s not clear to me when that was. I taught electromagnetism at the university for I think two years, and that’s before—I’m not completely sure, but it may be around the time I graduated from Tokyo University, ‘47.\n\nCrease:\n\nBecause I’m wondering when you met Masa, but you haven’t met her yet.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAt that point, in the second year of teaching at this other university, which is called Ochanomizu University, which is actually—at that time, it was called—Woman’s Normal High School was the official name.\n\nCrease:\n\nWoman’s Normal High School.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIt’s the highest school any woman could attend, before the war, because women were not usually allowed to attend ordinary universities. Except Sendai, I think, admitted some women, but not Todai. And so, any talented woman would end up with this particular university. I think in the second year of my teaching, Masa was one of my students. But after my second year, I quit the place, because I got another source of money [laugh], so I didn’t have to do extra teaching. Or in fact, from 1947 to ‘52, for five years, I was supported by a grant-in-aid of the Tokyo University, which was good enough for me to survive.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, what year did you meet Masa?\n\nKinoshita:\n\n[laugh] Few years after I quit her university. But I don’t know exactly—I don’t remember. Around ‘49, maybe. Or maybe ‘48.\n\nCrease:\n\nOK, so we haven’t gotten there yet.\n\nKinoshita:\n\n[laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what was her background?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nShe was actually attending Tokyo Woman’s University, probably in 1943 or something. But the school was in a suburb of Tokyo, but next to some military factory. And the chance of being bombed by mistake were quite high. I think it was a factory for making airplanes, [laugh] so the risk was even worse. And Masa’s mother got very nervous, and she forced Masa to quit the university after about a year, I think. So, then the war ended, and Masa wanted to do some more work, and then applied to this Tokyo Woman’s Education University from the scratch, I suppose. So that’s where she was.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what was she studying?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nPhysics.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, when she was your student, what were you teaching?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAs I said, electromagnetism.\n\nCrease:\n\nWhat was her last name?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMaiden name, you mean? Matsuoka.\n\nCrease:\n\nM-A-T-S-U-O-K-A. Matsuoka, yes. OK so you graduate—so tell me about your research project, then, that you did in that year and a half.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI started out, as I said, with Kodaira.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you explored field theory in this.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI wanted to learn about the field theory, mainly because field theory was not in good shape at that time. Whatever you calculated, it becomes infinite.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you got introduced to the divergences very quickly through that course.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAnd also, before we got to Professor Kodaira, as I said, I studied a book of QED, on my own. So, when I got back to Todai, I had nothing really more to study except for the new papers.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd how did you get those new papers?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh. Did I say that?\n\nCrease:\n\nI think you said something…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI started out with Dirac’s article. Because when we looked for something new in the library of Todai, there are a few journals which somehow got to Japan, in spite of being under the war. Like some ‘43, ‘42, and even some ‘44 journals were in—not systematically, but some journals were actually in the Todai library. And the first papers we chose for this seminar were Dirac’s paper on indefinite metric and—I don’t remember exactly. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nYou said something about them being stamped top secret.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh, that’s a different story. While reading these Dirac papers, I’m not exactly sure we found a statement, but we found that the Pauli mentioned that Dirac’s—no, Heisenberg’s S-matrix theory is a picture frame without a picture in it. This statement is actually made and recorded in some part—I can find it—but in a letter to Dirac, I think, from Pauli, 1943 or something of that sort. There is a collection of letters to Dirac which has this. But anyway, I don’t exactly know how I got hold of this information about Heisenberg’s S-matrix, which was first—I didn’t know that until that time. And we start looking for Heisenberg’s S-matrix theory, which was not in Todai’s library or physics department. But my friend Yamaguchi found out that Tomonaga’s lab has a copy at this time. And this paper, two papers actually, were in one of these books which was smuggled essentially into Japan by a German submarine. Actually, it was brought from Germany to someplace in the Indian Ocean, and then there it was transferred to a Japanese submarine and carried back to Japan. [laugh] Anyway, it shouldn’t have been there, if it’s totally disconnected, but it somehow came in. And in Tomonaga’s office, it probably came to an army or navy office in Tokyo, and somehow Tomonaga was given a copy of these papers. And my friend and classmate Yamaguchi was acquainted with Tomonaga before we knew him, and somehow, he managed to find this paper and made a copy and brought it back to Todai. And then we made a copy of that [laugh] and distributed it among the people there and started a seminar on that.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, this was the Tomonaga seminar that you refer to.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, no, no, no. It’s still the Kodaira seminar.\n\nCrease:\n\nOK, so the Kodaira seminar then basically takes place—starts in ‘46…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\n—and goes on for a year and a half.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nProbably, yes.\n\nCrease:\n\nBecause Kodaira went to—no, it lasted until 1949, I think, when Kodaira went to the Institute at Princeton.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWhat I’m describing is what happened in ‘47, I think.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, that’s during the time that you’re still—your last year and a half at Tokyo University.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you’re in that seminar of Tomonaga from then on…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. Which I am not sure. I didn’t know he was there. But my friend Hayakawa, who is two years senior to me, was already working with Tomonaga, and he told me that Tomonaga was at my seminar. [laugh] So, anyway.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, in Kodaira’s seminar, you learned Heisenberg’s theory.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. Very deeply. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd at the end, what was the end of the—?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOf course, it’s not a physics theory. So, at the end, we have to move on. But the Kodaira picked up the mathematical aspect of the theory and he wrote a paper on the eigenfunction expansion of second-order differential equations or something of that sort. And he sent a copy to Hermann Weyl, probably somewhere in here…\n\nCrease:\n\nYeah. I don’t see Weyl’s name, but…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis part.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, there it is—Weyl, yes. So, you gave the seminar in S-matrix theory.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, with my friend Fujimoto. I’m not sure if it was just one seminar or two, but we took turns, anyway. And the room, which could contain about 30 people, overflowed. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\n[laugh]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAnyway, in the Tokyo area, the rumor spread out that we are working on Heisenberg’s asymptotic theory and people came just to—curiosity brought people to our seminar, I think.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you graduate then in mid-’47?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAugust of ‘47. You have to give a talk to graduate [laugh], and I chose Tomonaga’s super-many-time theory as my subject of my talk. You see, do you know why it is called super-many-time theory?\n\nCrease:\n\nNo.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nBecause there is a paper called the many-time theory, by Dirac.\n\nCrease:\n\nRight, I remember that.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAnd in a way, super-many-time theory is an extension or generalization of Dirac’s many-time theory to field theoretical theory.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh. So, the super just means the extension.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. But anyway, Tomonaga did this paper in 1943, and nobody paid much attention to it, so I thought I should talk about this for my graduation talk.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you graduated. And by the way, your parents are still—do your parents like your career, like your choice of career?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThey didn’t say anything. You see, my father at least is a pretty educated guy, so he used to say, “Do whatever you want.”\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd you did.\n\nKinoshita:\n\n[laugh] Yeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, then you go to—then do you enter Tokyo University graduate school immediately for a Ph.D.?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. Then, you see, during the war, to maintain the future faculty candidate, the government sort of started a new program called special research student or something like that. I don’t know I can translate properly but…\n\nCrease:\n\nBut it’s approximately “special research student”?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd basically, it was a stipend support for graduate students.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAnd in 1947 to ‘52, I survived with this stipend, which was actually not bad, because of the [postwar] situation, in which people were having a very hard-time surviving until about that time.\n\nCrease:\n\nHow much was the stipend?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI think it was 5,000 yen, but I’m not sure. Something which you can sort of live a minimum life, in a way. At least you don’t have to do some extra work. I could just concentrate on research.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd who gave it? What agency gave it?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI think it’s the Ministry of Education, but it may be Todai. I’m not sure which one. The money actually comes from Todai.\n\nCrease:\n\nOK, but the government may have supported it. Hmm. So, you enter in ‘47.\n\nKinoshita:\n\n‘47 to ‘52.\n\nCrease:\n\nTo ‘52. And soon you get started on publications.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nWhat did you take the first semester there?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nCrease:\n\nWhat courses?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, no course.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, there was no course.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIt’s a research stipend.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh, so your graduate education was this research stipend.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh. And who did you work with?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYou see, I was already working with both Tomonaga and Kodaira, although the work with Tomonaga work was not official. Actually, as I probably said somewhere, Tomonaga assembled the people from Todai and his university, Tokyo Education University, right after the war. And the total number of people in his seminar group was already maybe more than 15. But by the time I joined his group, probably it was more than 30. So, people from all around Tokyo came to come to Tomonaga’s seminar.\n\nCrease:\n\nBy the way, you say here—you begin talking about this seminar that’s in the burned-out ruins of an army facility in northern Tokyo.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd you say “when the exciting news from the U.S. arrived”—what was the exciting news?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh, I probably didn’t say in proper order, but the news came not by Physical Review. Phy. Rev. Letters didn’t exist at that time. So, Physical Review is the only real source of physics. However, the occupation force opened the library in central Tokyo, which is open to the public. Mostly, they had journals like Time and Newsweek. Physical Review start coming only few months later, but initially, what you could find there is Time or Newsweek. And around November or maybe October of that year, news about the Shelter Island conference was reported by Time. The conference took place in August, I think. I’m not completely sure. But anyway, so we’d find nothing in the library of Todai, nothing useful [laugh] over there. So, people like us walked from Todai to this part called Hibiya in Tokyo, maybe a three-mile walk, to see publications in the library. And that’s where we found the Shelter Island conference report for the first time.\n\nCrease:\n\nIn where? In Physical Review or independently published?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nTime and Newsweek. So, this was not a professional report, but it was good enough to excite us all.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, OK. The Time report was good enough? Huh.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nProbably I should add that sentence somewhere.\n\nCrease:\n\nYeah. So, then you visit with Yamaguchi, you visit Tomonaga’s lab.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh, that’s a different story.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, sorry. It’s right after this one, so I thought they were linked.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh. Yeah. I have to…\n\nCrease:\n\nSo Tomonaga is already working with Koba…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\n—on renormalization.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s near the end of ‘47.\n\nCrease:\n\nOK.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. And we were already attending his seminar, but this work with Koba was done separately from that.\n\nCrease:\n\nSeparately, OK.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nBy the way, Koba is a brilliant physicist, standout among our group from Todai. He became a professor at Bohr Institute in Copenhagen a few years later. Unfortunately, he died soon after that. Because he actually had the TB.\n\nCrease:\n\nTB, huh? But your first paper is with him.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. That’s after publication. After this Tomonaga-Koba paper, which found the renormalization.\n\nCrease:\n\nOK, so after the Tomonaga-Koba paper, then you start working with Koba and…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI think the first paper I published…\n\nCrease:\n\nOn Endo.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, this paper. I have to explain this. I thought I did explain something there. This is a different…\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, this is…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. It’s—this place.\n\nCrease:\n\nYeah, the collaboration with Koba, yes. So, you were dealing with the ultraviolet divergence, and there were two methods. There’s Tomonaga’s method and the C-meson theory by Sakata.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, with this collaboration, you were trying to figure out how to decide—\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHow to distinguish experimentally what Koba was working on. And actually, I didn’t explain in more detail, but initially Koba found some difference between C-meson theory and renormalization problem. Because the difference is big enough that you can check experimentally for the elastic scattering of electron of up to few hundred MeV. Turns out that that was wrong. The reason why it was wrong is if you use C-meson theory which is a neutral scalar theory, you also have to apply renormalization to that, otherwise it doesn’t make sense. And when you do renormalization, the difference—the experimentally testable difference— disappears until you get to much higher energy like a TV or something. That’s what we found out.\n\nCrease:\n\nOK, so that was your first…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nFirst paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nYour first three papers, then.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, I think the first one probably had a difference discovered, and that corrected—when you think more about it, it couldn’t be tested experimentally at that time.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, those are your first three papers, and your next one was with Nambu.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you’ve met Nambu by this time.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd how did you meet Nambu?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIt’s not clear. [laugh] The first—I mentioned in the page one—Nambu came back from army service. Yeah, this page.\n\nCrease:\n\nStill wearing his army uniform.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut he was lucky; he managed to survive the war.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nWhere was he assigned? Do you remember?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNear Osaka. He graduated from Todai in ‘42, and then he was drafted into the army, but not into the combat zone. He was in charge of some army research facility, which was near Osaka. I didn’t want to say too much more about that, but because of the duty he had to go through, he was not discharged immediately from the army, and that’s why he came back to Todai a few months later. That’s what I say. Now, I think Nambu met his wife while he was there. Or his wife says she got sort of interested in Nambu at first sight. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, she was working there too, or she was—?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, she was living nearby.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd this is about the time that you meet Masa, then.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNot—no, no. I met Masa a few years later.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, ok, so it’s not ‘48, ‘49. It’s—\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis one, you see, war ended in ‘45, and Nambu came back to Todai in ‘46.\n\nCrease:\n\nRight, ok.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAnd so, it must—earlier than that. During the war, probably.\n\nCrease:\n\nRight, ok. So, after the three papers with Endo and—\n\nKinoshita:\n\nKoba.\n\nCrease:\n\n—Koba, you begin working with Nambu?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd how did that start?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat started because in ‘47, people discover the [inaudible] and [inaudible], and renormalization theory was made right after that, by Koba and Tomonaga, near the end of ‘47. And then it sort of was at the beginning of ‘48, and there were still some problems unsettled, and that’s why we worked on this C-meson problem. The first paper came in ‘48, and then a correction appears in ‘49. And then somewhere in my writeup about Yukawa—Yukawa went to Princeton. That’s in ‘49, I think. Or ‘48. Yukawa went to Princeton in ‘48. Oppenheimer invited Yukawa to the Institute in ‘48, and then Yukawa used this opportunity to inform the people in Japan about news from the U.S. And in particular, he sent to Japan the paper of Dyson proving—this is ‘48. So, there was Tomonaga theory, which was based on orthodox quantum field theory. And Feynman’s paper, which was completely different. And Dyson showed that Feynman’s paper and the Tomonaga-Schwinger theory are actually identical. And this information came I think sometime—not too late, but sometime in 1948. That’s how it happened. Now, in particular, you see, what’s interesting is that Feynman’s paper came to us much later, maybe a year later, after Dyson’s paper. So, studying Dyson’s paper, we had to guess what Feynman did, and our guess—by the time Feynman’s paper actually arrived, we knew exactly what he was doing [laugh] from Dyson’s paper. So, Dyson’s paper was a very important development. And so, in early ‘48, people started studying Dyson’s paper very intensely, including the work at Tomonaga’s seminar. And then the question is, instead of just reading Dyson’s paper, why don’t we try to apply this to something else? And I started working on vector meson, charged meson theory, to see whether the renormalization scheme still worked. And Nambu also started the same study at about the same time. You see, the interaction with Nambu is somewhat strange because he has his own ideas, and he doesn’t necessarily come to Tomonaga’s seminar, and so instead, he does his own work. But he is from Todai anyway, so occasionally I see him at Todai. Not at Tomonaga’s place. And we found that both of us are interested in seeing—or no, that’s slightly ahead of my time. What we are doing after renormalization is—that’s the end of ‘47. What we are doing independently is how the same technique applies to charged vector meson theory.\n\n[End Session 1]\n\n[Begin Session 2]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAt some point, we found each other and found that we were working on the same problem. In the meantime, as I was going to say, we got Dyson’s paper from the Princeton pre-print, and it’s clear that it’s much easier to apply Dyson’s theory, Feynman-Dyson theory to this problem of vector meson renormalization. And so, we had to really study Dyson’s paper from scratch. And then we decided to reformulate our vector meson theory in terms of Feynman-Dyson theory. That’s what I said somewhere.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, that’s this paper on the electromagnetic…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\n—properties of mesons?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd you published “Note on the C-Meson Hypothesis.”\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAh, this is something which I said, also. And that is, you know, C-meson hypothesis of Sakata works in the second order by choosing a coupling constant of the C-meson to electron. I think it was coupling constant square equals two times e square or something of that sort. But the same equation doesn’t work in the fourth order. Naturally. [laugh] In fact this paper says that C-meson hypothesis is actually not workable.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, it’s paper five, which you do by yourself.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd papers six and seven on the interaction of mesons in the electromagnetic field.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. Actually, these two are—I worked on them with Nambu. The reason why I have my own name, not Nambu’s, is just convenience of applying for Ph.D. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, six. Oh, so was this your Ph.D. paper?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nNumber six?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd did you get examined?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. [laugh] Strange situation. Because my professor, Kodaira, and also Tomonaga, is at Princeton.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, they’re in the United States.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. So, we had to import another person to be the examiner, Professor Miyazima at Tomonaga’s university. He became a temporary examiner. I’m not sure whether he read my work or not. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nAny questions, or were there any problems with it?\n\nKinoshita:\n\n[laugh] Well, anyway, so that’s…\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what happened when you were examined? Were there people in the audience?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI don’t remember. You see, also before I graduated, I had to give a talk. And the talk I gave is on Tomonaga’s super-many-time theory. And nobody wanted to ask any question. [laugh] This was before renormalization was found, because the exam was given before 1947, summer of 1947, and renormalization was found at the year-end of ‘47.\n\nCrease:\n\nBy the way, had you seen Feynman diagrams by this point?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nFrom Dyson’s paper or from—?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you were introduced to Feynman diagrams from Dyson’s paper.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nFrom Dyson’s paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what did you think of them at that point?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWhat did I think?\n\nCrease:\n\nThink of Feynman diagrams?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAs I said, studying Dyson’s paper, you learn what a [laugh] Feynman diagram is.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut did you realize what a great idea it was at the time?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh yeah, of course. That’s why I’m using it [laugh] all the time.\n\nCrease:\n\nYou’re still using it today, yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIt’s a really great idea. I mentioned sometime, not explicitly—[pause]—let’s see. Page four.\n\nCrease:\n\nPage five. [pause]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI still haven’t put in here—somewhere I need another section. Oh, here. I studied in Tomonaga’s seminar Weisskopf’s calculation of the electron self-energy. Maybe you can read this.\n\nCrease:\n\nYeah, ok. Ok, so he had you give seminars on Weisskopf’s paper.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nTo calculate the second-order radiative correction.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nApplying Dirac’s hole theory. And you found that Weisskopf’s result was correct.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd this helped when you read Dyson’s paper later.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, he found an important result about the divergence—that it’s not linear or quadratic but very weak. Ok. Ok. But you weren’t yet ready to participate in this, in the renormalization work. Yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOk. Anyway, the point is, this Dirac hole theory calculation of Weisskopf is [inaudible] calculation. In fact, there are quadratic divergences popping up from here and there, and in the end, they all cancel out. Which [laugh] looks like a miracle. But in Feynman-Dyson theory, they appear only as one diagram, and the quadratic never appears on the surface. Just to get the [inaudible]. So, the qualitative difference is totally different. So, in order to do second-order calculation, you still have to worry about a lot of things, other diagrams and divergences—different types of divergences and so on. If you have to do that in the second order, it would become very [laugh] difficult to do fourth order, and sixth-order [laugh] is sort of becoming almost impossible to deal with. But Feynman-Dyson make it possible at the minimum expenses. That’s why I said working on Weisskopf’s paper opened my eyes on why Feynman-Dyson is so good.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut that same year, you do ambiguities and quantized field theories.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh, I think that’s a vacuum polarization problem, which is not particularly useful.\n\nCrease:\n\nEight, ok. And the infrared catastrophe, is that…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. This is a two-page note. [pause] Maybe I showed it to you.\n\nCrease:\n\nI think I saw it in one of your notebooks. I think that you have it there someplace. [pause] Oh, there it is.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, this is the one.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, this is paper number nine. “Note on the Infrared Catastrophe”—Ok, yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThe point of this paper is if you look at this type of diagram, this is obtained by flipping over—this is a simple program of scattering emitting a photon. However, you can look at this part, then photon is absorbed, and this is scattered into the [inaudible]. So, actually this is not a simple Feynman diagram, but it’s a diagram corresponding to the probability. And if you use this formulation, then you can actually—this electron scattered while emitting photon and after scattering, all these diagrams can be put into this form. And also, each photon emission, this one divergent at K=0. So, it does all these things. But when you put them together in this way, all the divergences disappear. So, that’s a note on that. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nA note on that, yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIn fact, this technique of course is nothing revolutionary, but it simplifies the matter quite a bit. So, this is actually beginning of later work in 1962—I have written—’63 maybe—singularity—yeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nThat’s the Journal of Mathematical Physics, and that’s unusual for you to publish in a mathematical…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis was a mathematical problem. [laugh] So, I thought to publish this in mathematical physics.\n\nCrease:\n\nThat’s number 27.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNow the problem is, nobody saw this paper until about ten years later. And T.D. Lee and Michael Nauenberg worked on the similar problem and discovered this paper only much—after they published their paper. And it is called by the name of Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh. Oh, that’s what it is. Ok. And that’s why it’s called that, even though you published ten years earlier.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nKinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem, yeah. So, that’s the theorem that you begin here and develop here.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. Also, there was a further complication of actually this theory because, you see, this paper—oh, that’s from somewhere—with Alberto Sirlin.\n\nCrease:\n\nPaper 16.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. This paper was written right after the discovery of parity violation.\n\nCrease:\n\nRight.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nSo, Sirlin was a student at UCLA before coming to Cornell. He had written a paper on radiative correction of [inaudible]. And so, when we saw parity violation, we said immediately that we should also compute the radiative correction to the parity-violating part. And this we did very quickly in a week or two, just before the Rochester conference, and then we published it. Now, the problem is we were too quick and made a mistake. [laugh] I think—I think this is the paper, probably. You see, Feynman and his student Berman worked on the same problem, and they got the answer different from ours, and sent us a pre-print. And when we saw the pre-print, we found immediately that they also made a mistake. It’s a very subtle mistake, but a mistake is a mistake, and numerically, it’s not so small [laugh]. What happened is in the first paper, we calculated the radiative correction by putting a small mass to the photon. Because to maintain covariance, it’s important to have some—make the photon to be a vector meson and then go to the limit of mass going to zero, in the end, to maintain the gauge invariance. So, that’s fine. That’s well-known for many years. But when you combine this with a [inaudible] to compute, the photon [inaudible] emitted photon must also be a vector meson with a small mass. Instead, people usually put mass equal to zero, and emitted photon has a polarization—transverse polarization only. That means you forgot the longitudinal polarization.\n\nCrease:\n\nLongitudinal polarization, yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAnd if this is a small effect, seems to be, but if you couple that with a divergence, it becomes quite visible. [laugh] And the first paper, we made a mistake. Forgot that the external photon, emitted photons, need also longitudinal polarization. Ok. So, that was an error which Feynman and Berman found out, too. But they made a mistake—Feynman visited us later and he told me more than ten times he was sorry [laugh] he made a mistake. And the reason he made a mistake is from one page to the next page, copied a formula in the previous page incorrectly. I don’t believe that [laugh] but that’s Feynman’s explanation.\n\nCrease:\n\nOk, that’s 1957.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut go back—you have one more paper in Japan, which is on V particles. Paper ten.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. This is a V particle, which means [pause]—no, this is not very important paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, ok.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis is a very important paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nPaper number eight—the “Note on the Infrared Catastrophe” you say is the important paper.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. Eight and ten are not particularly…\n\nCrease:\n\nEight and ten are not as important, ok. But by this time, you’ve met Masa.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd how did you meet Masa, again? She was in your class. You were teaching electrodynamics.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nBut I quit the university job. For probably about a year, I had no contact with her. But her house and our house were not too far away. And one day, she came to our house asking me whether I could teach some physics to her brother. So, ok, I say, I teach. And in some way, then, we got involved. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd when did you get married?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIn ‘51.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd did she have brothers and sisters?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nShe had an elder brother, younger brother, and a younger sister.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd did she ever work with you on physics?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nPardon?\n\nCrease:\n\nDid she ever work with you on these papers?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo. She helped me a little bit in the helium problem.\n\nCrease:\n\nHelium atom problem, yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. At some stage, early stage, she did work with me, but not much.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, how did you get to the United States?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI think I wrote something here. Oh, I didn’t finish about Feynman’s. You see, the reason why I saw immediately that the Feynman-Berman was wrong, is their result has a logarithmic dependence on electron mass. And our initial error had a square of logarithmic dependence on electron mass.\n\nCrease:\n\nThe square of—?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIt’s finite, but it depended logarithmically on the electron mass. Square of the logarithm. Now, what Feynman and Berman did was [inaudible] square of logarithm term must be dropped. But they left the linear part of logarithm in the form in the final result. And I saw immediately the reason why the square is gone should also apply to the linear term also. So, it becomes really finite as a function of electron mass. So, that’s where Feynman made a mistake. And I think there’s a paper somewhere—“Everybody Makes Mistakes, Including Feynman”—that explains…\n\nCrease:\n\nWell, there’s more later on in your career with Feynman, but we’ll get to that. So Tomonaga—you sent that paper with Nambu to Tomonaga.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd then you were invited to the Institute.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. More or less. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nWhat do you mean, more or less?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s my guess. But Nambu certainly had done quite important work by that time. So, that’s why he was invited, I suppose. So, I’m not sure whether I was his apprentice [laugh] or not.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut there were still very few Japanese people going to the United States at that time.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you were special. You were in a special category.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, sort of special. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nWhat was it like? How did you get to the United States? How did you travel?\n\nKinoshita:\n\n[laugh] First of all, we were not very rich. Everybody in Japan is mostly—every student certainly was not very rich. So, we couldn’t come by airplane or passenger boat. So, the best we could do is to find a seat on cargo boat, which is somewhat cheaper. So, I took a cargo boat from Nagasaki to Seattle. That’s the best I could find. I would have preferred to start from Yokohama to San Francisco or someplace. But anyway, Nambu was lucky enough to get a boat from Yokohama to San Francisco, but about a week later. So, my boat arrived at Seattle, and then I took a Greyhound bus from Seattle to San Francisco, and then to Berkeley. And I stayed in Berkeley for about a week, awaiting Nambu’s arrival by another boat. In the meantime, I visited Lawrence Berkeley Lab. Actually, the professor at Tokyo, [inaudible] Sagane, he was working with [inaudible] before the war, and after the war, soon afterward, he came to Berkeley again. And so, we had somebody who could take care of us, at least language-wise. Also, he found a place for us to stay in downtown Berkeley. And so, I had no problem coming to Berkeley. But waiting for a week Nambu’s arrival by a later boat, I didn’t want to waste my time, and so I went to Caltech by another Greyhound. The reason why I went to Caltech is before that time, some experimentalists at Caltech measured the electron mass by measuring electron-positron decay into two gammas. And you measure the gamma energy by some device, a clever device called a curved crystal spectrometer. And they found that the energy of the photons didn’t add up to two electron masses. It’s like a 50-electron volt smaller or something like that. So, I was interested—[End Session 2] [Begin Session 3]\n\nKinoshita:\n\n—make a theory of why this could happen. Maybe it’s a condensed matter effect, and so on. But before I write the paper, I want to see the experimentalists, and visited Caltech. Found out that they had just found that there was an experimental error. The error is very subtle. You have to move the spectrometer on the rail or something like that. And the rail sort of deforms by the weight of the spectrometer, and that deformation is sort of not instantaneous. It has a residual effect. So, what you thought it was measuring is not the measurement of the right time but at the wrong time.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd who was the experimenter?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI forgot the name.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut it was at Caltech?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nCaltech.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you went to Caltech, and then you take the Greyhound bus back.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nBefore that, people at Caltech told me that Schwinger was at UCLA visiting. So, I went to [laugh] UCLA to listen to Schwinger, or to meet Schwinger. And then at that time, Roy Grauber was visiting also UCLA. Turns out he was a very good friend of Tomonaga at the Institute, and he became very friendly to us. To me, I mean. Not to Nambu, but to me. And in particular, he recommended that I take California Zephyr across the continent.\n\nCrease:\n\nCalifornia—?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nCalifornia Zephyr. That’s the train.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, Zephyr, the train. Yes.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYou know that?\n\nCrease:\n\nYes. The Zephyr train, yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. So, we took—when Nambu arrived, he and I took California Zephyr and start crossing the Rockies. We stopped at Denver, and went from Denver to Mount Evans, which has a cosmic-ray lab, and stayed overnight at the cosmic-ray lab or some facility, loading-facility, few maybe—at about 10,000 feet. Experimental facility was at 14,000 feet. Now [laugh] the problem was I got height sick. So, while I was up top of the mountain, my head was [laugh] making big noise. [laugh] But when I got down to Denver, I’m back to normal immediately. I didn’t like that. So, I continued my trip to Chicago, on the train, and I visited Fermi’s Lab. I wanted to see his famous cyclotron of 300, 400 MeV, which was the center of the topics at that time. Like something called (3, 3) Resonance. And then maybe the next day we went to Rochester, stopped at the University of Rochester, and met Marshak…\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, Rochester. Ok, right. And that’s where Marshak is.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMarshak. And we stayed at the house of French, who was known to us by French-Marshak—no, French-Weisskopf paper. And then we went to New York and Princeton, just a short trip.\n\nCrease:\n\nLet me go back a minute. Did Masa come with you?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo.\n\nCrease:\n\nShe was staying in the United States?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nShe was a student, still. So, she came to the U.S. after she graduated from school.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd when was that?\n\nKinoshita:\n\n‘53, April.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh. And you say language—Sagane helped with the language. How good was your English?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNot very good. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nBut you managed to get around?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo problem getting around.\n\nCrease:\n\nNo problem getting around. And how was it to be Japanese in the United States at the time? Did you face hostility?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI didn’t feel any. Maybe I’m not sensitive to that. Well, when we [laugh]—I didn’t particularly feel my English was bad or changing, but one year after I was at the Institute, Abe Klein, I met him—I don’t know you if know him?\n\nCrease:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHe said, “You speak much better English.” [laugh] He saw me at the beginning and then one year later. So, maybe I have improved a little bit!\n\nCrease:\n\n[laugh]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThen this is 1952. After May of ‘53, Nambu and I went to California, by separate cars. He went on his own. Actually, he was going to Los Angeles, I suppose, to pick his wife and son up at L.A. My wife was with me already. Just like we went across the continent, but in a separate car. And then we arrived at Caltech. We needed a place to stay and found a place in Pasadena. And the landlady couldn’t pronounce my last name, so she invented the name “Tom” for me. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nAh. So, until then, you had been Toichiro?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. Or, it still is. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nStill is, right. [laugh] Oh, sorry. So, Tom was given to you in 1953 by this landlady.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. And anyway, so this is the second time I was in that area. A guy named Watanabe; I don’t know if you know…\n\nCrease:\n\nI’ve heard of him, yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHe was a professor at the Naval Lab in Monterey. And while we were—on the way from Caltech to Berkeley, we stopped at Monterey to pay tribute to him. He looked at my car, and he was amazed you could make a trip [laugh] across in it.\n\nCrease:\n\n[laugh]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAnyway, the car survived the whole trip back to Princeton.\n\nCrease:\n\nWhat kind of car was it?\n\nKinoshita:\n\n‘48 Primous.\n\nCrease:\n\nPrimous. Huh. Tom, why don’t we break now, and do it later this afternoon? I’m getting tired. I don’t know about you.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI am, too. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nCan we talk this afternoon?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOK.\n\nCrease:\n\nWe talked for almost two hours! [End Session 3] [Begin Session 4]\n\nCrease:\n\nThis is Robert Crease, and I’m interviewing Toichiro Kinoshita and Masa Kinoshita.\n\nMasa:\n\nYes.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMasako.\n\nCrease:\n\nSorry?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMasako is actually…\n\nCrease:\n\nMasako, right, OK. And it’s January 9th, 2016. We talked this morning about your life before you got to the United States. Is there anything that we didn’t talk about?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nJust a moment. [pause] Ouch.\n\nCrease:\n\nYou hurt your finger?\n\nMasa:\n\nHe poured tea on his finger. [laugh]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOk.\n\nCrease:\n\nThank you.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nSo, what was the question?\n\nCrease:\n\nThe question was—we talked in the last interview about your life before coming to the United States. Are there anything else that you forgot to mention?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAs far as physics is concerned, I think I mentioned everything.\n\nCrease:\n\nOk. I actually had one question, which is you mentioned people receiving papers from the United States and copying them and then making other copies. How was that done?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIn those days, copying was not trivial. They prepare some—I think they have—[laugh]—\n\nMasa:\n\nYeah. I was curious but I never knew how it’s done. You make some original copy. [laugh]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWell, that’s to make many numbers of copies, you actually type from the beginning on some kind of special paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, mimeograph.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMimeograph or something. And so, it takes some time of secretaries or somebody.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you have to type it over from the beginning.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut when you said you made copies of Feynman’s paper or Dyson’s paper, is that how you did it?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, that’s the way it was done.\n\nCrease:\n\nYou typed it all over from scratch?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nIncluding the equations?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nCrease:\n\nHuh!\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIf you had enough money, you could make a photocopy, but to make 50-pages of photocopy would be very expensive, so that was not usually done.\n\nCrease:\n\nWow.\n\nMasa:\n\nThere seemed to be always somebody who volunteered to do this kind of job among the students.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, it would be a student job then? Hmm.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWell, anyway, copying is certainly much easier now [laugh] than the old days.\n\nCrease:\n\nThen we talked about your coming to the United States, taking this steamer to—this boat to Seattle, and then going to San Francisco and then Caltech, and then across the United States to the Institute.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you arrived at the Institute when, approximately?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIt’s—I think August 18th or 17th—I don’t remember the exact date—but sometime towards the end of August.\n\nCrease:\n\n1952.\n\nKinoshita:\n\n1952.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd did people meet you? How were you received when you got there?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHmm?\n\nCrease:\n\nDo you remember the first day you got there? Did people meet you and show you around? Did Oppenheimer meet you?\n\nKinoshita:\n\n[laugh] I don’t remember exactly. I remember the secretary I met, probably the first one, called Miss Winter. She took us around and she told me and also Nambu that our office is here, and so on. I mentioned something about our office, which was a physics building office at one corner of a sort of square-type building, somewhere around here. I forgot to mention Lee and Yang occupied the same building, and when they discussed physics in this room that was opposite our room, it wasn’t very close. However, when they started arguing, they spoke so loudly that you could hear all what they say. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\n[laugh]\n\nMasa:\n\n[laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nNow, you don’t write any papers until 1954, so are you just doing—why is your next paper not until 1954?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI actually mentioned—[pause]—this paper, this paper, and this paper, and this one, are all 1954.\n\nCrease:\n\nRight. But before that, there’s no—the previous paper was [pause] 1951.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, but we spend a lot of time on this paper with Nambu. And probably this was published in—and then some small papers here and there.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut nothing between ‘51 and ‘54.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI don’t remember.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, who were some of the people you interacted with at the Institute?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOf course, [inaudible] became good friend and then Bram Pais was on the staff of the Institute, and we got to know him quite well.\n\nCrease:\n\nEinstein?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo. He’s too high up. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nPauli?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nPauli is an interesting case. He was visiting the Institute when I first got there, and I know that Pauli—Tomonaga showed our paper to Pauli. Pauli was very impressed. And this is my guess, but the reason why Pauli was impressed is that Pauli had a student working on the same problem, essentially, and we outdid his student by far.\n\nCrease:\n\nNow, he was there…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHe would come to the Institute and go back to Switzerland and so on. He did not have a permanent seat at the Institute.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd Oppenheimer? Did you interact with Oppenheimer?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, sure. I have to say hello to—I had just come to the Institute and so on.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd were you there when—in early 1954, Yang comes to talk about what will be known as the Yang-Mills theory, and Pauli is there. Do you remember that?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, not—you’re talking about Yang-Mills theory.\n\nCrease:\n\nYeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s somewhat later, I think.\n\nCrease:\n\nWell, he publishes it in late 1954, but he presents it at the Institute in early 1954.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nPossible.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd Pauli was there, and I was just wondering if you happen to remember that.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI don’t remember that. Pauli is known to make some sarcastic comment on many people.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what were your work habits? What would you do every day at the Institute?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI just go there every day. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nWere there regular seminars?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMaybe once or twice a week. Also depends on the visitors. Yeah, another thing I should mention about Einstein—his house was on I think what is called Mercer Street. I lived at the center of Princeton, close to the railroad station. I don’t remember where Nambu lived, but somewhere around there. And then people who lived in town usually took the Institute bus to go to the Institute, which started at Palmer Square. So, we’d go to Palmer Square and take the bus, and the bus would stop in front of Einstein’s house and pick him up. So, I remember that sometimes Einstein sat next to me and would ask me, “What are you doing?” I said, “I’m working on meson theory.” At that time, that was not interesting to him. So, that was the end of conversation.\n\nCrease:\n\n[laugh]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nBut Nambu was also interested in relativity, and so Einstein and Nambu talk all the way to the Institute, whatever.\n\nCrease:\n\nEinstein could sustain a conversation with Nambu?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nNow while you’re at the Institute, Masa arrives, right?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMasa arrives in ‘53.\n\nCrease:\n\nIn ‘53. And how did you get to the Institute?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nShe flew from San Francisco to LaGuardia.\n\nMasa:\n\nLaGuardia, right.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAnd then I went to pick her up with my friend by a car. So, she had no problem.\n\nMasa:\n\nYeah, but the plane was delayed by almost one whole day, because of the bad weather.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIn Nebraska or someplace. Well, anyway, I think somehow communication was okay, and I knew exactly when she was coming to LaGuardia. So, that was no problem.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut you had a house, then, near the train station, and that’s where you lived for…\n\nMasa:\n\nYeah, it’s an apartment.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, one-room apartment, of course. But when she arrived, actually Institute gave us an on-site apartment, and so we stayed there for maybe two, three months or—\n\nMasa:\n\nYeah. Actually, we stayed in a small house in between.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI don’t remember that.\n\nMasa:\n\nYeah. It’s where—I don’t remember the name. It was, anyway—somebody, a very famous mathematician was living in that apartment.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh, yeah. On the site of Institute housing, too.\n\nMasa:\n\nBecause he went away for the [inaudible] Institute, and started a vacation. So, that was the only place available at that time, so we lived in that little house. And then other people vacated apartments, a general apartment, and so we moved to the apartment.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd how did you find Princeton? Did you like it?\n\nMasa:\n\nYeah, I liked it very much.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd Kay was born there?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOne year later.\n\nCrease:\n\nWhile you were still at the Institute?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIn ‘54.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what did you do at the Institute?\n\nMasa:\n\nWell, [laugh] so—well, this is—the apartment is in a colony of apartments. There were a lot of ladies who were just about having as much time as I do. [laugh] So yeah, we socialized…\n\nCrease:\n\nWere you doing the looms then? Were you weaving yet?\n\nMasa:\n\nNo, I didn’t have—well, I really didn’t have any special thing. Well, actually, I was still hoping to continue physics. So, maybe—I attended something…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nSome courses.\n\nMasa:\n\nSome courses. Yeah, right.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWigner’s course?\n\nMasa:\n\nYeah, Wigner’s, and then…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI don’t remember the other…\n\nMasa:\n\nYeah. Anyway, I attended a couple of courses in Princeton.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd had you graduated in physics from Tokyo?\n\nMasa:\n\nRight, in Japan.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what year, ‘53?\n\nMasa:\n\nYeah, ‘53.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd from where? From which college?\n\nMasa:\n\nAs soon as I graduated, I came here to Princeton.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd which college again?\n\nMasa:\n\nIn Japan?\n\nCrease:\n\nYeah.\n\nMasa:\n\nOchanomizu. It’s one of the oldest women’s colleges in Japan. It just became a regular college with the change of the system.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIt used to be a teacher’s college.\n\nMasa:\n\nHigher Normal School.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nCalled Normal [inaudible].\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what was it called again? What was the name?\n\nMasa:\n\nOchanomizu.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, after the name was changed, it became Ochanomizu. Before that, it was called Tokyo High Woman’s University or something like that.\n\nMasa:\n\nHigher Normal School, yeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you started working with Nambu, then, on many-particle systems?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. That was after we got to the Institute. We spent essentially two years working on that.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, ok. So, that’s what you’re doing at the Institute is working all that time on…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nBut I also did a few more papers. This one is at the Institute.\n\nCrease:\n\nFourteen, spinor field.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis one is also at the Institute.\n\nCrease:\n\nBack to V particles. And is this one—why did you work on the ground state of helium?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s after I moved to—actually, it started at the end of my Institute…\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, that’s right. That’s ‘57.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nOk, so you spend two years at the Institute.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd then you become a postdoc at Columbia?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nHow was that arranged?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWell, actually [laugh] I don’t remember I ever applied for a job there. But T.D. Lee was already at Columbia. And someday I think I asked him, “I would like to stay in the U.S. another year.” And he said, “Oh, why don’t you come to Columbia?” He would take care of that.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you never applied for a job?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo. As far as I remember, I never applied for the job.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you didn’t apply—you didn’t seek positions other than Columbia? You just asked him…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nJust asked T.D., and then he told me, “Just come.” Actually, Cornell, I also went in the same way. One day, Ed Salpeter came to give a talk at Columbia, and I asked him whether Cornell had any positions, and then he said, “Well, let’s talk to Hans.” And then sometime in the next week or so, I got an offer from Cornell. [laugh].\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, how did you like Columbia?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIt was nice. But I would say we don’t really like a big city. And in particular, Masa had a—Kay, as a baby—she had to take out Kay every day to—for exposing to the sun. And, well, I don’t know whether she felt—but I thought—so for instance, Princeton was much nicer, in that sense.\n\nCrease:\n\nFor having a child?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nMasa:\n\nMmhmm.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut that must have been intellectually an exciting place at the time.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nSamios, Lederman, Weinberg. Where did you live?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nFeinberg…\n\nCrease:\n\nFeinberg…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, I know. Feinberg may have come after I went. I’m not quite sure.\n\nCrease:\n\nWhere did you live?\n\nKinoshita:\n\n125th.\n\nMasa:\n\n21st.\n\nKinoshita:\n\n21st. 125th is a big street.\n\nMasa:\n\nWe were told you should never go [laugh]…\n\nCrease:\n\nNorth of 125th?\n\nMasa:\n\n[inaudible] little bit four streets closer to the center. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you then—so after Salpeter came, you moved to Ithaca.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what was Ithaca like?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWell, I settled down in Ithaca, and that means I have nothing bad to say about Ithaca. It was very nice.\n\nCrease:\n\nThe head of the department was Smith? The chairman of the department at that time?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI think…\n\nCrease:\n\nSmith or Corson?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI think that Dale Corson was the chairman when I went, but soon afterwards, I think chairman has—let’s see, who…\n\nMasa:\n\nOh, I forgot. [laugh]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI know, but I cannot tell. [laugh] The name doesn’t come out [laugh] of my memory.\n\nCrease:\n\nIt wasn’t Smith?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHmm?\n\nCrease:\n\nSmith?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo. Smith is probably before Corson.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, ok. And at Cornell, did they let you work on what you wanted to work on?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nDid they instruct you as to what you had to work on?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo. In particular, I was continuing my work on helium atom.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh, ok. Before we talk about the helium atom, Paul Hartman remembers that Dyson—you got your first Christmas tree with Dyson? Do you remember that?\n\nMasa:\n\nWell, that’s when you visited Rochester. Dyson.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis is 1952, December.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThere was a conference, one of the Rochester conferences, in December of 1952. And on the way back, we stopped at Cornell, and—actually, we lived in [laugh]—I forgot the name of the guy—it was a postdoc working with Dyson. His wife is a daughter of some Nobel laureate [laugh]. I forgot the name. [laugh] Anyway, they are going on vacation on that day, so they volunteered to let us use their apartment while they’re gone. And then we opened the refrigerator and the refrigerator had a hole in the back [laugh]. It was still working, probably, but not very well. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nThis was Dyson’s grad student? The apartment?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIt’s Michel Baranger.\n\nCrease:\n\nMichel Baranger, huh.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI think they went to MIT afterwards.\n\nCrease:\n\nNow, so you’re working on the ground state of the helium atom then.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd why was that particularly important?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYou see, it goes back to 1954. In the summer at the Institute—the Institute ends at the end of April or something. So, before I went to Columbia, there were four months of vacant time. So, I wanted to do some work or get some money, too, and then asked around the people at the Institute, and they said they had some openings at the Neumann computer center. So, I worked for few months at that computer center, but I needed a research program. [laugh]\n\nSo, I looked around the literature, I found that the helium ionization energy theory and experiment disagreed quite a bit. So, I looked at the theory, which was actually in the paper written by Hylleraas. He’s one of the people who worked at the very early stage of quantum mechanics. By calculating the helium atom-ground state energy, he proved essentially that quantum mechanics actually works for a multibody system with two electrons. So, this was an important paper and it was in the middle of [inaudible]. Everybody was quoting it. But an experiment by Herzberg in Canada differed [from the theoretical value] by much more than the numerical uncertainty. And so that’s what interested me.\n\nSo, I looked at the Hylleraas paper, in which he used a variational method to evaluate the ground-state energy. And, of course, whether you get a good eigen value depends on whether your test function is good. And actually, I found that his test function was not really that good, but that’s not fatal. If you have too many—many, many terms in a test function, eventually it will approach the right value. But the more important error he made is that the helium atom, when one electron gets close to the helium nucleus, from the view-point of a second electron, it looks like a hydrogen with a charge of one. And this is of course true at the very—if the other guy was very close to the nucleus. And he made a wave function taking this into account. That much is fine. But what was wrong was that he fixed the parameter of this so-called screening charge. I mean, helium atom has charge two, electron has minus one, and if it gets too close to the nucleus, from outside it looks like a charge one.\n\nSo that’s a screening, so-called. And Hylleraas assumed the screening parameter, a number of them, maybe—five to ten; I don’t remember how many—and therefore each fixed screening parameter, he did the variation for the other parameters. I mean, [inaudible] screening—wave function can be made more precise by adding more and more terms. So, he certainly took a variational method for [inaudible] varying these other terms, but not the screening parameter. So, this was sort of a reasonable approximation, he assumed, which is not incorrect. But what he did is a variational calculation for each fixed screening parameter, and then interpolated the result, now finding the minimum of the possible screening parameters. But this is not a variational method. If he also varied the screening parameter, then it becomes a variational method, but he fixed that, assuming that he already was close enough. And so, it is not only—it was not close, but in fact it caused a large, quite visible discrepancy between theory and experiment.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, what attracted you was the possibility of testing quantum mechanics…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\n—by working on the theory very carefully.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nIn a paper that seemed to involve a discrepancy with experiment.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. Actually, I heard from some people—I don’t remember the name—but that Fermi was interested in this problem, and sort of speculated maybe the three-body has a different interaction and is not the sum of the two-body interactions. But my calculations show that this conjecture is incorrect.\n\nCrease:\n\nBy the way, how do you spell the author’s name of this paper?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHmm?\n\nCrease:\n\nThe name of the author of the paper.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHylleraas.\n\nCrease:\n\nH—?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nProbably said something in the paper…\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, in here, ok. [pause] There we go. Hylleraas. Yes. H-Y-L-L-E-R-A-A-S, ok. Ah. Now, you were using the computer then at NYU?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIn the second stage, yes. I started using the computer at Princeton, but [laugh] that’s another story. The computer at that time worked on vacuum tubes.\n\nCrease:\n\nYes.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAnd every 30 minutes or one hour, some tube would blow. And then your calculation would be back to the starting point. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, so when the tube blew, you had to go over—start from the beginning?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. Then I went to Columbia, and the Columbia Watson Lab had some computer, but I didn’t get much out of it. But then I went—I was at Columbia for one year, and then went to Cornell. After I went to Cornell, the next summer, I was asked to come to Bell Lab, and Bell Lab had a good computer. So that’s where I really got a good value [for the helium atom]. But then for further improvement, I needed the UNIVAC at NYU.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, how would you get to NYU? Would you drive from Ithaca?\n\nKinoshita:\n\n[laugh] Yeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what was that like?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIt’s five, six hours’ drive, and very tiring. But I was young, so it didn’t really bother me.\n\nCrease:\n\n[laugh] And what was it like working at the UNIVAC? Was it a friendly atmosphere?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYou see, the real working program I got at Bell Lab, so it was all tested out and so on. And so, at NYU, it was a matter of running more time and more something and so on. And so afte,r the NYU work, I got a sufficiently good result, and published the paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, was this your first serious involvement with computers, then?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, I’d say I should think so.\n\nCrease:\n\nFor this helium atom issue?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you worked on the helium atom. And then this paper number 16, that we’ve talked about a little bit. The paper with Sirlin.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis is a helium atom paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nThat’s the helium atom paper, number 15.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThen the next problem—actually, timewise, they are overlapping, probably. I don’t remember exactly. But this is very interesting paper in the sense that I think at the end of 1956, parity violation was discovered. And so, it’s obvious right away that it will affect distribution of pi muon decay in this case. And Sirlin was a graduate student at Cornell. Actually, he transferred from UCLA. I don’t know why. But he had written some radiative correction papers at UCLA, so it was very easy for him to compute a part of the parity violation.\n\nCrease:\n\nNow, do you remember hearing about parity violation for the first time?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nProbably within a few weeks.\n\nCrease:\n\nBecause it was—C.S. Wu was working on it, got the results at the end of ‘56. And then there was a famous meeting at the beginning of 1957 on…\n\nKinoshita:\n\n[inaudible]\n\nCrease:\n\nNo, American Physical Society.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh, I see.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd then they were all published in the Physical Review. But do you remember hearing, learning about it? Because it was a very shocking development.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nCertainly, I heard before that. When the parity violation was actually found—do you remember?\n\nCrease:\n\nIt was the end of 1956 when she got her results, and they were published January of 1957.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis is 1957.\n\nCrease:\n\nYeah, so this must have been later in the year. But they were published in Phys Rev earlier. I forget which volume.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, this is our paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nYeah, but in Phys Rev, C.S. Wu’s paper was published in Phys Rev along with two other papers at the same tame.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nBut this particular paper is concerned with muon decay.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh. But in the light of parity violation. You knew of parity violation.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI knew about parity violation certainly, as soon as it happened. But this paper was written to present at the Rochester conference.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh. Paper 16, yes.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. So, that means I had to do some calculations in time for the conference. And as I said, Sirlin has done the parity independent part already. So, we added a parity dependent part, and this is that paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you went to the Rochester conference?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd what was that like?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI don’t remember exactly what it was, really. Parity violation is already well-known, so it’s not particularly shocking already.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd then you did another muon decay paper.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYes. This is for the general interaction. This is V-Minus-A theory, and this is the general interaction.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, 16 is V-Minus-A theory, 17 is general interaction.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd then radiative corrections—again, these are all concerned with the asymmetry in muon decay.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh, ok. And why are radiative corrections important?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nBecause it’s not small. So, the measurement has to be accurate to distinguish—to establish the parity violation in muon decay. In particular, low-energy electrons or low-energy positrons would be strongly affected by the radiative correction.\n\nCrease:\n\nWhich is paper 18, yeah. So, you have a series of papers, then, on muon decay, basically.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis is Pi zero decay.\n\nCrease:\n\nPi zero decay for 19. Twenty is muon decay.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis is muon decay. Now, I think this is a paper…\n\nCrease:\n\nNumber 22.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. Correcting the mistake of my first paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nCorrecting the mistake of which paper?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYou see—yeah. This paper…\n\nCrease:\n\nSixteen, yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nDid I tell you yesterday that if you wanted to compare experiment and theory, you have to deal with the photon as a vector meson, with a finite non-zero mass. Otherwise, people were using virtual photon with an effective mass cut off. But for the real one, they were using photons without a cut-off mass. So, that means in the virtual photon, you have a longitudinal component, but for the real photon, there is no longitudinal component, and therefore they are not consistent.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, this 23 corrects your mistake here. And how did you realize your mistake?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh, this is a different story.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh. Which is the correcting paper, 22?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, this is the one.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd how did you discover the mistake? So, this is the Feynman?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nFeynman and Berman redid the calculation and they sent us a pre-print. In the original paper, we had a total decay probability, which contains the square of the logarithm of mass over electron mass. And Feynman and Berman paper has a linear power of this logarithm. So, they found the error, which I just mentioned. However, they made a mistake also. And as soon as I saw their paper, I realized right away that there is no logarithm either. And Alberto and I did the calculation very quickly in a few days, and in fact showed that the logarithm term was completely absent.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, 22 corrects 16 with Feynman in between. And in between…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI mean, some papers in between may have the same error. Because we didn’t know that there was a problem. And that old error is corrected by that one. After this paper was published, I get at least several phone calls from experimentalists. So-and-so did the calculation and disagrees with our calculation. It’s always the case that these people who did the calculation forgot the problem. It’s a very subtle problem, and on the surface, it looks like an ordinary calculation is okay. But since it involves infrared divergence, you have to be extra cautious.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd then paper 22 is also important. So π-e decays?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. I think this is one I wrote—actually, the work was done with Feynman.\n\nCrease:\n\nTwenty-three.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nFeynman was visiting Cornell for one term, and he brought to us the paper with Berman. And, of course, there was an error in that paper, and that’s why Feynman was very sorry that he didn’t see there was an error. It was a different type of error. He said that the mistake they made is copying one formula from one page to the next page.\n\nCrease:\n\nThat’s what you said. But you doubt that. [laugh]\n\nKinoshita:\n\n[laugh] Which I don’t believe. [laugh] But anyway…\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, did you work with him on that paper, on 23?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut because he had made the mistake, he didn’t want his name?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHe didn’t want to sort of blame his student.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh, ok. Oh, I see. So, this corrects his mistake with Berman, but he didn’t want his name on it, because it would cast—he would rather you correct the mistake than Berman correcting the mistake.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd this one, “Radiative Corrections to Fermi Interactions”? You’re back with Sirlin again, 24.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNow, the Fermi interaction is a four-point interaction, and so of course they also need radiative correction. Of course, this is not really relevant, because the Fermi interaction in the standard model is mediated by W, Z, and [inaudible]. So, I think Sirlin and guy at Brookhaven [laugh]—I forget the name…\n\nCrease:\n\nA theorist?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nTheorist. I don’t know the name. [laugh] I don’t remember. [laugh] It’s coming out, but—[laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nTheorist. So, not…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh, Marciano.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, Marciano. Ah. I didn’t…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMarciano was Sirlin’s student.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, then you’re back to the helium atom in a ‘59 paper.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNumber two.\n\nCrease:\n\nYes. Paper 25, yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNumber one was maybe—I don’t remember exact number, but something like 18, 17 parameters. And this one is I think 80 parameters. So, the answer is improved significantly.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd again, are you still going to NYU, to the UNIVAC at NYU to calculate?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, I think so. This is ‘59. I have to look at the paper, but I think that is right. See, this happens on the time scale of about three, four years.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd Cornell still doesn’t have a good computer?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNot at that time. Later on, they had some better computers. But, actually, the Cornell computer was not good enough for my purposes, and I used some at San Diego and a few other places. Well, that’s not for—for g-2, I used different computers, because the Cornell computer was not useful for that one.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd then you have resonances—we talked about this. Number 27. That was the Journal of Mathematical Physics article. That’s the one that didn’t get a lot—the attention it deserved.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nCrease:\n\nBecause it was in a…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. It’s famous now, [laugh] only after Lee and Nauenberg wrote another paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nRight. So that’s the origin of the Kinoshita, Lee, and Nauenberg…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAnd actually this [inaudible] is actually related to Feynman’s mistake.\n\nCrease:\n\nHow?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThe point is when you made a mistake or made a mismatch of longitudinal mode, you get the dependence of log. And only if everything is done correctly, this log term goes away.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd then can you explain the enthusiasm for Regge poles?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHans Bethe shows up here for the—[laugh] the only time I collaborated with Hans. He knew a lot of mathematics as a well-trained German physicist usually does. And so, he was very happy to deal with Regge poles, and we had some discussions. But, well, this is just a mathematical theory, and not really a physics problem.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd is this one a physics problem?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. This is the first paper I wrote at CERN.\n\nCrease:\n\nRight. Tell me how you got to CERN. You were a Ford Foundation fellow?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIn 1962, I went to CERN.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd how did you do that? Who encouraged you to go? How did you think of going to CERN?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh, I guess this was more or less close to my sabbatical year. And so, if I go away from Cornell, the only place worth going to is CERN. [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\n[laugh] Ah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nIn fact, I got a Ford Foundation fellowship and went to CERN.\n\nCrease:\n\nNow, wait, back to personal life for a minute. By this time, Ray and June are born?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah. That’s right.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, do you take them all to CERN?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd how did you like CERN?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nDid they like CERN?\n\nCrease:\n\nDid you like CERN?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOh. It’s nice to be there. In particular, I become a very good friend of André Martin. And so, I liked [laugh] him very much. He’s a very good mathematician and also has a good sense of physics. In fact, we wrote a paper together. This one.\n\nCrease:\n\nMartin and number 30, yes. So, at CERN, you wrote this one on Regge poles.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nTwenty-nine. Thirty—the upper bound for high-energy scattering amplitude.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis is written later, but it’s following the idea explored in this.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, this was the first time you had visited CERN.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nIs ‘62 to ‘63. And what about Brookhaven? Had you been to Brookhaven during the summer months?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nSeveral times. I don’t remember how many times. [laugh] Probably three or four times. Because I took off from Cornell to Brookhaven.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, this paper too, you wrote with Martin. And here, Khuri, this wasn’t at CERN then?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo. Khuri I knew from before that. In fact, I should have known him when I was at Princeton. He was a graduate student at Princeton at that time. But around the time when I got involved with Martin, Khuri also was interested in the things that we were doing, and quite often we worked together, and this is one of the things. You see, I wrote three papers with Khuri.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd you’re back at Cornell, then.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, I’m back at Cornell. And then I went to CERN again, 1966, I think.\n\nCrease:\n\nYes. Now, wait. Before you get to CERN again, the Ken Wilson—Hartman says that you were responsible for Ken Wilson coming to Cornell.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nActually, this was before my first visit at CERN, which was ‘62. And he already decided to come to Cornell. I think I wrote a very strong letter to Hans, and Hans decided immediately, “Let’s take him.” [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, ok, because Hartman said that you were the person who was responsible for him to come.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNot exactly. I’m not in the position to make an offer. But maybe when I went to CERN in ‘62, Ken Wilson also was there.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAnd we interacted to some extent. Particularly whenever I asked Ken some question, he’d say, “Wait a minute” and pull out some paper from his drawers, and say “Here’s an answer to the question.” [laugh]\n\nCrease:\n\n[laugh]\n\nKinoshita:\n\nSo, that’s the way—he has thought about many, many things concerning with Regge poles related problems, and so I was very impressed, and reported back to Hans that we would be lucky to have him.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd then Hans—so Hans, then, was in a position to ask him to come?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd who was the chair then? Was Corson the chair yet?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAt that time, I’m not—Corson was not the chairman one or two years after I went to Cornell. So, some other person was the chair. Name is also almost to here, but I cannot quite…\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you come to CERN in—here, ‘66 to ‘67. So, you work with Khuri. And these papers too—36, 37, 38—are probably before CERN.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nOn forward scattering amplitudes.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s sort of an after effect of the first visit with CERN. All these are related topics.\n\nCrease:\n\nThose papers.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis one also is related.\n\nCrease:\n\nWhich one, 39?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd probably this. Probably 40, too.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nOk. Now, so you get to CERN in ‘66.\n\nKinoshita:\n\n‘66. And within a few weeks of our arrival at CERN, the theorists were invited to visit the experimental groups. And the first experimental group I visited was actually doing a muon g-2 experiment. And they had a picture of measurement in which muon detection has a decay structure superimposed by spin orientation stuff. And looking at that picture, I sort of thought, well, how beautiful it is. [laugh] And it must be possible for me to do something for muon g-2. And that night, in my bed, I figure out how to solve the problem [laugh]. And the next morning, I went to the experimental group there, and, “I know the theory of how to solve the problem.” Turns out that was probably written somewhere here.\n\nCrease:\n\nThis one?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThey are not published here, but it was reported at the Cargés summer school or something.\n\nCrease:\n\nI’ve seen that, yes. You gave a paper at the Cargés summer school about it. And what was that paper on?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat is a paper on my struggle to solve the problem. [laugh] The first part was very easy. You see, when I saw the experimental curve, I recalled that there was a paper on muon decay in the fourth order, mu’e decay in the fourth order. No, not mu’e decay; muon g-2—in which Wickman and Suura…\n\nCrease:\n\nWickman and Suura.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nSuura. They computed this diagram. A very simple diagram—mu and e. And it had a term of rho and mu over m_e. And they published around 1957 or ‘58. And this was a very small and simple calculation, and they reported the number like that for muon g-2, fourth order correction. So, that was it.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd why is this called fourth order?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nOne, two, three, four interactions.\n\nCrease:\n\nFour interactions, ok. So, the orders refer to the number of interactions.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd they always go up by two because you have the—this is the electron, and this is the…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nSecond order is something like that.\n\nCrease:\n\nAh, OK.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNow, the question is, how you got this. And at the time when I saw this paper by Wickman and Suura, I just thought, “So what?” But when I saw the experimental curve, this problem came back to me and I suddenly understood why it was. And that is this factor comes in from the renormalization group. Which I didn’t really know at that time, but some people after they saw my paper, they said, “That is all the applied renormalization group.”\n\nCrease:\n\nIt’s—?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nApplied application of—\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, applied renormalization group. Oh, ok. So, you saw this paper when it was written? The Wickman and Suura paper, when it was written?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWhen this was published, it didn’t connect.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut you saw it, but you didn’t…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI didn’t know what it was. Then as soon as I understand that, you also see what this sixth-order term would be like. Or this is even eighth-order. All these can be related to the rho [inaudible] order diagrams plus a [inaudible] which you can fix by renormalization group technique.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you saw this diagram on the wall…\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, no diagram. Experimental curve.\n\nCrease:\n\nExperimental curve, right. But you had been working on related issues to that. I mean, a lot had prepared you to understand that curve.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nCrease:\n\nSuch as all of these papers on polarization in mu decay, and radiative corrections.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, no, it’s not there.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nBecause this is the first time I got interested in g-2. And the interest came from the experiment and understanding this particular problem of Wickman and Suura. And then once you understand that, you actually can compute a sixth-order correction without doing any work. Just go to the library and print out necessary formulas from the publication. So, that was very exciting.\n\nCrease:\n\nAnd which publications were those, then? Oh, that—we’re on the wrong page.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI think this is the paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nForty-one. Nuovo Cimento.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah.\n\nCrease:\n\nSo, you go to the library. You find what’s needed to be added.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nWell, this is…\n\nCrease:\n\nForty-one.\n\nKinoshita:\n\n—probably summer school at…\n\nCrease:\n\nThis is summer school at Cargés you think?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThat is likely to be the case, because it’s published in Nuovo Cimento. Now, that is not the end of the story. [laugh] Actually, there was another diagram like this, which I wanted to evaluate in the same way. But it didn’t work. And the reason—and also, you see, this diagram is known as the Euler-Heisenberg in the light-by-light scattering problem.\n\nCrease:\n\nThe light-by-light scattering?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThe light-by-light scattering. It was studied by Euler and Heisenberg before the war.\n\nCrease:\n\nHow do you spell Euler?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nE-U-L-E-R.\n\nCrease:\n\nBut he was much earlier. The mathematician?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMuch earlier.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh. The Swiss mathematician, Euler.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, no, this is a physicist. Euler is another famous mathematician with the same name, but this is a…\n\nCrease:\n\nOk, different.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nHeisenberg was his student, probably. Now, the point is this at low energy, this is proportional to [inaudible] force of the photons. And at the low energy, therefore, it’s very small. So, I saw that at the beginning this also would be very small, and I tried to prove that, without doing any calculation, that this is a very small contribution and therefore you can ignore it compared to this. Which is wrong. Euler-Heisenberg showed that thirterm is very small near the threshold. But this is not near the threshold. This is a muon. This is electron. And the momentum here is the muon momentum. So, this condition is not satisfied. And so, this could be large. So, this was computed analytically much later, but at the time it was a very difficult calculation to do. So, I decided to do a numerical work. Write the program and evaluate the calculation by a numerical method. Turns out, it is huge. Like in alpha/pi to the cube times factor 20. And that was a really amazing discovery that we—oh. This numerical work I started for the first time on g-2, my teacher was Stan Brodsky. Actually, he was working on the same problem, and we worked together.\n\nCrease:\n\nWas he at CERN?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nNo, no.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, ok. So, he’s at Cornell.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nI was back to Cornell.\n\nCrease:\n\nYou were back at Cornell, yeah.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nMust be other ones. Ah, this one.\n\nCrease:\n\nHere’s Brodsky. Yeah, it’s 45.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nThis is the paper.\n\nCrease:\n\nOh, so this is light-by-light scattering, 45, yeah. So, you work on it with Brodsky, Dufner, and Aldins.\n\nKinoshita:\n\nAldins is my student, and Dufner is Brodsky’s student. And this is a paper discovering a huge contribution from this diagram.\n\nCrease:\n\nAre both of these—44 and 45?\n\nKinoshita:\n\nYeah, that is the announcement, and this is the actual calculation.\n\nCrease:\n\nForty-five is the a"
