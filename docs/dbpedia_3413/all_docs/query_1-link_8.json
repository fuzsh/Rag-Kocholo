        "text": "THE ROLLING STONES\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION (PART II: LATE PERIOD ALBUMS, VIDEOS AND SOLO)\n\nMETAMORPHOSIS\n\nTony Stewart <tony.remi.stewart@worldnet.att.net> (11.02.2000)\n\nOh God! I can't believe I gotta do this one. What began as a great idea, with Wyman putting together an album of Outtakes of the STONES from their Decca years called the \"Black Box\", and which would have given us such STILL unheard tunes (e.g.\"Godzi\") turned into a ALO Muzak showcase, miles below the Stones' standards. A majority of these songs have nothing more to do with the Stones than the Jagger/Richards credits and Mick on Lead Vocals. Some were done by ALO's 'Orchestra' in his silly attempts to emulate Phil spector, others were Demos whipped up for the purpose of selling them to other artists. And others are Rolling Stones doing what they do so well. The overall sound is lukewarm and bland.\n\nSo let me concentrate on the Good. \"Out Of Time\" opens Side A. What was an interesting and actually quite sophisticated arrangement with Marimbas and a well placed 12-String, plus a great Vocal arrangement has all the spice taken out of it by this godawful String Arrangement, which sounds like it is penned by ALO himself, it is so forced. Jagger probably is the only Stone on this one. BTW don't let all those Liner notes fool you. This was no great Jam session with the Stones and Jimmy Page etc. It just so happens that J.P.Jones and Page were the top session musicians in london around that era and are used on several of those tunes. As a matter of a fact I have a feeling that \"Heart Of Stone\" is Jimmy on Lead. \"Don't Lie To Me\" is one of those tunes that J/R got writing credits on, but supposedly strays very close to a number of one of their heroes. This one IS the Stones, but they would do this one a lot hotter in years to come. \"Some Things...\" is one of the VERY few Stones songs that I can truly say I do not like very much. My problem is I would still rather hear anything by the stones than by 99.9% of everyone else, because I like the STONES themselves. Sounds like Keith during his 12-String period. Was a Demo for another band, same as the over-produced but actually quite pretty \"Each And Every Day..\". Really love those Trumpets with that 'Spanish' Flair ALO! \"Heart Of Stone\" is even worse in it's \"Non-Stonesism\" than \"Out Of Time\". Chris Farlowe actually ended up doing quite well with \"OOT\", but the chicks could have stayed out of the \"Heart Of Stone\" chorus. That's a mean-ass single the Stones had there; elevator music on this disc. \"I'd Much Rather Be With The Boys\" actually has a lot of charm and I really would like to know the line-up on that one. Penned by Keith and ALO, Andrew explains the eyeliner a bit, and Keith writes a very Doowop sounding melody. \"Sleepin' City\" again isn't a bad song. This is what is so infuriating about this disc. It is totally ALO's record, arrangements are strictly for commercial purposes. this one has a great little bridge with an interesting shift in Key, a solid Hook. Makes one wonder what the stones would've done with it. \"We're Wasting Time\". I know. \"Try A Little Harder\"; a solid groove, some chicks doing a generic doowop, and your basic melody and lyrics, and still Jagger manages to get my toes a -tappin'.. Side B is by FAR the stronger side. Because this one is undoubtedly Stones. In Demo mode, but....Rolling Stones. We begin with the tune they supposedly were working on when they received the news of Brian's death. \"I Don't Know Why\". Jagger cuts a cool whining vocal track but the stars are the guitars. Some great 'ancient weaving' going down there. Especially the Wahguitar set against the Vibrato sound of the other. Now that is a good one. Right into \"If You Let Me\". My gut feeling is that this IS the Stones. Just because it sounds like the type of lighter feel songs they were writing when they felt like it in that period. \"Jiving Sister Fanny\" affirms what Keith has said about each stonessong having it's cousin somewhere. \"Dance Little Sister\" sounds closely related to this one. There are other meaner versions with Taylor really letting fly on Lead. Good Rocker. \"Downtown Lucy\" (I never understood why it is called \"Suzie\") is Bill Wyman's other song that was accepted into the fold, and is actually the better one of the two. It sounds like the guys in a circle on the floor with some friends, work out the harmonies and let the tape roll. Good job, Mr.William Perks. \"Family\" here in version 18 or is it 17? This one from the Beggar's era, they obviously tried very hard to make work, and it just wouldn't take off. It sounds like Jagger wanted to deliver those lyrics, which I think he'd feel a little foolish about today. \"Memo From Turner\"is one of those tunes that Stones aficionados like to argue over. Which one is better. The version here is basically the 'Keith' version, more uptempo, but without much soul behind it. IMHO that might partly stem from the fact that Keith really had kind of a bad taste in his mouth about the whole \"Performance\" bit, since he refused to visit the set and watch his best friend fuck his girlfriend. So he sat in the car and wrote \"Gimme Shelter\" instead; not a bad trade-off... The single that Jagger wisely put out(which also differs from the Movie version) is the first real official solo outing from one of the Bandmembers. He used a version that he cut with a great Slideguitar by Ry Cooder, plus Jim Capaldi and Stevie Winwood. One wonders if he was also already harboring thoughts about Jimmy Miller, since he pulled him from that camp not long after. Great lyrics, this time. Wish they'd do THAT one today! The disc closes on a high note, on the most Stonesy song of the entire disc\"I'm Goin' Down\". There are a couple of versions of that one floating around. As long as you get the Congas and Bobby on Sax, you're all right. Built around a riff that is so pure \"Stones\" that it should almost be sampled as \"Stones Guitarriff\". Jagger mouthing off about '...shoot'chor Momma in Law..' and at least we go out with pure Stones ringing in our ears. This was a disc,where the decision to release it was obviously completely out of the Stones' hands. It was a legal matter, they tried their best to at least get as much good music on there as possible, but that was before Jagger found Lowenstein, who kicked Klein's greedy ass back to living off Beatles rehashes. But still, it was a long time and a lot more mediocre rehashes to come, before the Stones ridded themselves from several bad contactual obliations. No wonder they are so tightfisted with their material when it comes to dealing with Sampling and Major Companies. On the other hand they are probably the most generous band as far as the \"Import\" discs go. They make up for it in other ways.. I don't think the stones are in any kind of financial troubles. On a scale from 1-10 I give this one a 6. So total is 11. Oh and BTW for IORR I only gave 8; of course that means 13.\n\nDidier Dumonteil <dbdumonteil@wanadoo.fr> (01.04.2001)\n\nUniversally despised, metamorphosis is a burried treasure,being not available on CD,at least in my country.To think that rolling stone didn't give even ONE star to this collection!!.It's very diversified:pure rock and roll (exciting \"jiving sister Fanny\"),soul (\"I don't know why\") pop (\"out of time\" Oldham did his \"long and winding road\" stint by adding strings) a country waltz (\"we're wasting time\")Spector symphonies for kids (\"I'd rather be with the boys\")I'd trade you GHS and IORAR for this one on CD.\n\n<JJFSFTD68@aol.com> (17.08.2001)\n\nIt's actually Phil Spector of all people who sings lead on 'Andrew's Blues'.\n\nRobert Tally <BtheW@aol.com> (08.10.2001)\n\nLike most archival releases, this album leaves something to be desired, but it's the Stones, so it isn't too bad. Eight of the nine side one tracks are actually by the Andrew Oldham Orchestra, with Mick Jagger on lead vocals, and perhaps an occasional appearance by one or more of the other Stones. (\"Don't Lie To Me\" is the only bona fide Stones track on side one.) The AOO tracks heard on this album were basically demos. In the case of \"Out Of Time,\" Mick's lead vocal was used as a guide for Chris Farlowe to learn the song. Then the same backing track ended up on his record, but with Farlowe's voice.\n\nI suspect some of these others were used the same way. There are three songs on this album that I like quite a lot. Unlike everybody else that's mentioned it, I really like this AOO version of \"Heart Of Stone.\" I think it has tremendous atmosphere and actually prefer it over the Stones version. Like many others, I would count \"I Don't Know Why\" as one of the best tracks. I also very much like the Bill Wyman song, \"Downtown Suzie.\" I just love the lazy off-the-cuff party atmosphere. Most of the other tracks are actually pretty good: \"Sleepy City\" (a very catchy pop tune by the AOO, but kinda corny); \"If You Let Me\" (a catchy, but insubstantial folk ditty); \"Jiving Sister Fanny\" (a good rock feel, but underdeveloped); \"I'm Going Down\" (a decent but somewhat generic rocker); \"We're Wastin' Time\" (a melodic countryish AOO tune); \"Try A Little Harder\" (a Motownish tune by the AOO with a good, thumping bass). The rest are basically lesser efforts: \"Out Of Time\" (this AOO version is pretty corny, but of course, the song is still very catchy); \"Somethings Just Stick In Your Mind\" (a fairly catchy folk tune by the AOO, but nothing special); \"Family\" (not bad, but Mick's voice kind of irritates me); \"Memo From Turner\" (the Stones version, much sloppier and less focused than the Jagger solo version); \"Don't Lie To Me\" (a very lackluster early Stones track in a Chuck Berry style). The only two tracks (both by the AOO) that I flat-out don't like are the corniest moments on the album: \"Each And Everyday Of The Year\" and \"I'd Much Rather Be With The Boys.\" So, basically, there are a few great moments and a few terrible moments on this album, with a lot of mediocrity in between. Technical point no. 1: I have two bootleg CDs of this album, one of which is just the 16 tracks recorded straight from the original album. The second is a Russian copy with six bonus tracks, including the ones mentioned by George. However, the 16 Metamorphosis tracks on this album are mostly alternate mixes, and in a couple of instances, entirely different takes of the songs. The front of the CD looks slightly different from George's, so his might include the actual album. In any event, those looking for the original album on CD will need to keep this in mind, since both the authentic and alternate versions are available only on bootleg. The biggest differences on my Russian copy are: \"Heart Of Stone\" (which lacks the pedal steel guitar and much of the atmosphere); \"Family\" (which is an entirely different take and is extremely unpolished); \"Don't Lie To Me\" (which is run at a much slower tapespeed); \"Jiving Sister Fanny\" (which has a different lead guitar). Most of the other differences are minor, and in a couple of cases (\"Out Of Time\" and \"Memo From Turner\"), I wasn't able to detect any difference. The six bonus tracks, incidentally, are: an orchestrated folk instrumental by Richards and Oldham called \"Hear It,\" the instrumental \"And Mr. Spector And Mr. Pitney Came Too\", the barely amusing Spector tune \"Andrew's Blues,\" a poppy version of \"Blue Turns To Grey,\" a drastically different mix of \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing In The Shadow,\" and a pedestrian pop tune by Andrew Oldham called \"I Know.\" None of these were ever officially released. Technical point no. 2: There was one other official archival Stones release which most people aren't aware of, a West German 4 LP boxed set called The Rest Of The Best, which was released in 1983. In addition to previously-released material, this collection included \"Bright Lights, Big City\" (a standard R&B tune from the March 1963 audition tape); \"Tell Me Baby\" (another R&B tune, it's mistakenly labeled as \"Tell Me\" on the album); and \"Memphis Tennessee\" (an instrumental AOO version erroneously credited to the Stones which originally appeared on the 1964 LP 16 Hip Hits). The first pressing of the boxed set also included a bonus single containing the less than subtle \"Cocksucker Blues.\" The single had to be removed from the set for legal reasons. There were two other AOO recordings released in 1964 that featured Mick Jagger on lead vocals: \"I Get Around\" (on East Meets West); and \"Da Doo Ron Ron\" (on 16 Hip Hits). There was also at least one instance when the Stones were credited as the AOO, when they recorded \"There Are But Five Rolling Stones\" This appeared in 1964 on the B-side of Cleo's \"To Know Him Is To Love Him,\" on which the Stones were the backup group. They were also the backup group on Dick & Dee Dee's 1964 version of \"Blue Turns To Grey.\" Technical point no. 3: For reasons that can't possibly be good enough, the US version of this album omitted \"Somethings Just Stick In Your Mind\" and \"We're Wastin' Time.\"\n\nMichael H. <ratboymike@hotmail.com> (29.06.2002)\n\nThe song \"I dont know why\" was being recorded the night the band found out that Brian Jones died. For some reason, the record company thought that \"I dont know why\" was good for single release. Also some associates and managers in the 60's tried to cash in on the sucess of others (and their clients) by forming there own record companies (Andrew Oldhams \"Immediate\" records) and releasing classical/pop classical arrangements of current hits (\"Beatles Songbook by the Hollywood Strings\" I think) well, I have 3 related albums of Andrew Loog Oldham related material of \"Andrew Oldham Orchestra\" releasing orchestrated versions of Rolling Stones songs, The Aranbee Pop Symphony Orchestra (doing chamber music versions of Stones and other performers songs. The music is very depressing), and also \"Andrew Oldham Orchestra: Rarities\" featuring such original dities as \"365 Rolling Stones (One for every day of the year)\", \"Oh, I do like to see me on the 'B' side\", and \"There are but five Rolling Stones\". Well, I have a comp. tape of the Immediate record company (in the cut out section) which has early Rod Stewert, Nico (Velvet underground), and an up and coming 60's singer named Chris Farlowe. Well, Mick and Keith were his fans and sometimes producers, and he went down in the music history books for trying to make hits with doing covers of Rolling Stones tunes. His singing style sounds like he is trying to sing with an Italian accent. He did covers of \"Out Of Time\" among other song. I have this tape. It seems that Farlow's backing track somehow ended up on METAMORPHOSIS with Mick Jagger singing!!! I know this is a long explanation, but this explanes the 60's pop orchestra arrangements of some of the songs. Some record producers idea.\n\nGlenn Wiener <GJW0721@aol.com> (20.04.2003)\n\nDecent collection of Stones outtakes. Like yourself I like the reworking of Stevie Wonder's 'I Don't Know Why'. One of Jaggers best vocal performances. Mickie T contributes a fine solo. Also like 'Family', 'Downtown Suzie', and a few others. However, inferior versions of 'Heart of Stone' and 'Out Of Time' plus lackluster melodies on the other tunes bring this recording down to a cute novelty rather than an essential purchase.\n\n<a0106848@unet.univie.ac.at> (04.06.2004)\n\nThis was re-released as the first official CD edition ever in 2002, but I will probably never buy that. ...which should already say a lot, because I got all the other Stones albums you reviewed on official CDs. For this ill-conceived release, I'll stick with my CDR-copy of the mentioned Russian bootleg. On here, only one song sticks out to me: Bill's \"Downtown Suzie\", which would have sounded even better on the Beggars album it was originally written and recorded for, yet didn't make it onto it. Plus, unlike many other Metamorphosis-songs, it features the whole band. All in all, I give this collection of song fragments a 6 out of 15(!). If you want outtakes, there are loads of bootlegs, and I'm not a fan of outtakes by ANYBODY. Consequently I'd recommend any(!) other official Stones CD in comparison to this. On the rating scale, you say for 6 star albums: \"I'm surprised they're still around and available on CD. Any artist should be ashamed of this tripe.\"\n\nSo is it any wonder, that it took the Stones so long to make Meta available again? BLACK AND BLUE\n\nSimon Hearn <simon@leehearn.freeserve.co.uk> (11.09.99)\n\nA short comment on this one. 'Hot Stuff', probably the most famous track off the album, is not a great track that \"tames\" funk and disco rhythms and uses them to augment the stone's sound. I really do believe it is a poor track that would not be out of place on Emotional Rescue. 'Fool To Cry' is too sickly and does not fit the stone's lexicon of music at all. (you should have given it to lionel Ritchie lads!)\n\nA 6 would be a fitting grade. The stones real 70's album comeback was some girls - no question. Compare 'hot stuff' to 'miss you' - and see\n\nGlenn Wiener <glennjwiener@hotmail.com> (30.09.99)\n\nI will admit there are some great riffs on this record. However, the melodies and lyrics are so underdeveloped that this record is really a dissappointment. But a danceable dissappointment at least. 'Hot Stuff' has such a cool groove but even after a while with theminimal lyrics you would think something is wrong with your needle(record) or CD player. 'Fool To Cry' gives the same impression with the ooh ooh's after the second verse. 'Melody' is pretty creative but Mick must've had writer's block when working on the chorus of merely repeating Melody-Melody- It Was Her Second Name. Most of the songs have potential but none of them deliver all the way.\n\nJeff <Jkh1392@aol.com> (20.10.99)\n\nNot as bad as I remembered. In fact, I rather like it now. All the grooves (\"Hey Negrita,\" \"Hot Stuff,\" \"Cherry O Baby\" are really solid and the playing is tight throughout. \"Memory Motel\" starts out kinda crappy, but it turns out okay, especially the Keith-sung parts. \"Fool to Cry\" is cheesy to the extreme, but it's such a lovely little melody. The two \"rockers\" are fun, if nothing special, and \"Melody\" is one of the most off-beat song the Stones ever recorded. Overall, I wish this was longer. I mean, what's here is enjoyable, but there's only 8 songs!! It was okay to have nine songs on Let it Bleed, because they were all perfect. These songs are good, sure, but they don't hold up a well as an album. So as much as I like this stuff, I'd rank this as the weakest album the Stones made in the 70s. Of course, that would translate into a 7 or so.\n\nBy the way, it's odd that this is Ronnie Wood's first album with the Stones, since none of the guitar work sounds anything like his work with the Faces. Neither does his songwriting-- how could someone put \"Hey Negrita\" and \"Stay With Me\" in even the same category of music?\n\nTony Stewart <tony.remi.stewart@worldnet.att.net> (12.02.2000)\n\nBlack And Blue. I agree fully with George's opening line of 'oh, so underrated'. The Stones are rumored to do their best work under extreme duress and confusion and i tend to agree. History proves it again and again. Here we have Keith supposedly in an utter Heroin daze, no second Guitarrist, and the Stones at an overall low in popularity, because they supposedly had rejected their ideals. Like with \"Exile\" this one took time to sink in. It is their disc which probably more than any other has stood the test of time and only gotten better as the years go by. It also occupies, with\"Some Girls\" the distinction of having every song performed live. It's tough to review this one because do we venture back to '76, or do we look back from the present year? Let's just go with my first night with the disc. I was not a teenager yet and had all their discs and was indulging in some...things. \"Hot Stuff\" with it's wonderfully clean, compressed Keithian Funk are the first notes we hear. The obligatory Wah Wah, Clavinet and 'Hot Stuff' chant follow to flesh out the Disco/Funk Groove. High points are the Breaks with Harvey Mandel come blasting in and then taking us up ina great Keychange during the solo. Jagger's Island style rap is surprisingly convincing at the end. I sat there mesmerized, shaking my head. I had never heard a human sound like that. What was he talking about? \"Hand Of Fate\". What a wonderful song and what a beautiful solo. Wayne Perkins evokes memories of Taylor on that solo and came this close to getting the job, probably on the strength of that solo alone. A little footnote: Dig the short instrumental break right before the last verse which just comes out of nowhere. I had a friend who was heavily into fusion and whom I was trying to turn into a Stonesfan. He became one after he heard that little break. \"Cherry, Oh Baby\" is one of the two songs where we have Ron actually playing. It's easy to see how a lot of people can hate this song. Either you get it or you don't. And also let's keep in mind the guys were still working at the subtleties of actually playing Reggae. Read any interview by Keith on the subject of reggae if you want a good lesson. First thing to learn is that it does NOT only take a 'chunke chunka' trebly guitar and a lot of weird drumfills that don't crash on the obligatory one of the bar. With each album they got better and better and grew more comfortable and confident with the style. Having Marley, Tosh, Robbie and Sly around a lot certainly didn't hurt either. All three of these songs sounded great in concert. Which brings us to \"Memory Motel\". I must have listened to that song 25 times in a row that night. It has since become a Live Fave, but Boy did it take a long time...The totally unorthodox Drumming by Charlie and the harmonies that only, but only Keith could comeup with and place where and when his soul made him, coupled with the trio of Keyboards played by the three Keymen of this song, add Keith's Bridge to it and the \"Sha-la-la-la's\" and you have a studio masterpiece. This one I've always felt should have stayed in the Studio. Live it loses a bit of it's majestic feel. It makes the perfect soundtrack to the inside of the gatefold cover. The guys don't give us much time to linger on sweet memories though. right away comes Ronnie's masterpiece \"Hey Negrita\", a Funkriff so nasty and so mean, that makes even Billy preston sound good on piano. Ron is playing his Silver Zemaitis and he used to get a real nasty growl out of it in the lower register, when he is playing the main riff. Ollie brown and his Percussion on top of that just make it irresistible. And when hetakes it up into the 22nd fret...the rooster crows one last time before he gets strangled. (where did that come from?). From the bubbling Gumbo of \"Negrita\" we cool down to the big band flavored \"Melody\" which showcases just a tad too much Preston. I love the lyrics and i love Jagger , and i actually like preston on this whole album. I just have this personal thing: I hate Billy Preston. He did do the stones a lot of good though when they needed him. Jagger didn't have his partner there for a while, so he had to find someone else to play with. \"Fool To Cry\" is the \"Angie\" syndrome. It's hard when you're a Rolling stone and you've got a flat out beautiful song with what definetly can not be termed Rebel Rock Lyrics. What to do? Also \"Angie\" was really not so far in the past. F*ck it, release it anyway as the single. And it proved to do really well. They play it to this day. All of them for that matter, especially the album closer\"Crazy Mama\" which at the time (another parallel) evoked that same \"Starfucker\" syndrome. Although, very crafty, especially once the middle break and endpart of guitars had been overdubbed, it sounded very much like the stones saying\"Hey let's play a Stonestype song\". But time goes by, and you look around and you realize you had been comparing the Stones to their own high standards, because who else just sat down and joyfully bashed away on Cymabals, Trashcans, electric guitars and yodeling lines like \"you're plain psychotic, plain insane, you one Crazy Mama...\"\n\nSo numbers now. 14.\n\njpcs <jpcs@xtra.co.nz> (09.06.2000)\n\nhey i know i just referred to this as \"a piece of shit\", i was just being a wanker.Going back to have a listen to it tonight,having culled it from my collection at least one-third of a lifetime ago,I find myself agreeing with damn near everything George says.By the way tho' ,the phylum \"Hot Stuff\" belongs to is not called \"disco\",it's FUNK. As good a example as a average Ohio Players album track,which means, good enough to be 1 of my favorite tracks off this album. (BTW \"Miss You\" is a Stones disco song ,if you need the comparison.) Yeah so George,when you say (about this track) \"next to no lyrics\",to you that's a negative point,am I right? Yeah well not for me,man:less Mick Jagger is usually nought but a bonus.Props to him for one thing tho' - usually their slow ballads are a pain 'cos of his horribly strained insincere \"soul\" singing,but both \"Fool to Cry\" & \"Memory Motel\" are surprisingly good-sounding...especially surprising coming so soon after the gruesome \"Angie\".Good work,fella!You're nearly as good as Rod Stewart!\n\nJohn McFerrin <stoo@imsa.edu> (09.10.2000)\n\nI disagree - it may be underrated by most fans, but I think you're overrating it pretty strongly. I agree with supporters of the album that this is pretty much the last time that they tried to do anything different over an entire LP, and in that way it's at least amusing. But as nice as diversity can be, it cannot make a strong album by itself. This is the Stones trying many styles, yes, but this diversity is not the product of having a firm grasp of several different genres. Rather, it's the band 'running in all directions, painfully trying to find a style' - and I quoted your description of Peter Gabriel I here because I consider it the same type of album as this.\n\nOn the 15 point scale, I would give this a 10 - it's not bad, not by any means, but hardly a very strong effort.\n\nJohn McFerrin <stoo@imsa.edu> (21.10.2000)\n\nHmm. It looks like I may have been wrong on this one. In my mind, I know that it's mostly just a decent groove album ... so why in the hell can't I stop listening to it? I mean, it's weird - when the album's over, my mind tells me, \"dude, that song only had one riff for five minutes\" or something like that, but when I'm listening to it, I'm having an absolute blast. I fully understand the heading you give for this album now.\n\nI feel funny giving this as high of a grade as you did, but what the hell? This album's so much fun! A 13.\n\nBryan Boyd Jackson Jr. <bjackson@brandywine.net> (02.03.2001)\n\nYou are right, this album is badly underrated. All of these songs are good, and that is something that I cannot say about the other Stones albums in the 70's. This really is good. \"Memory Hotel,\" certainly brings tears to my eyes. Beautiful, beautiful singing. Best Stones song of the 70's if you ask me. \"Cherry Oh Baby,\" and \"Hand Of Fate\" are just incredible songs. \"Hey Negrita\" and \"Fool To Cry\" aren't far behind. \"Hot Stuff\" is better then \"Miss You\"! I don't care what others say, it is! What else? \"Melody\" which I feel is a little too long, but then again, it's not long enough. Don't know what to say about that song. It's good though. \"Crazy Mama\" probably the only song I don't care for, but hey, it's not bad, and I'm sure everybody else likes it. I look at this album as the peanut better and jelly between two shitty pieces of bread (sorry). I don't like It's Only Rock And Roll and half of the stuff on Some Girls I don't care for, but this album makes up for it. While everybody is playing Some Girls, I'll be playing Black And Blue, because I feel, it is the better album. Buy it now! Oh yeah, I'd give it a 12 or 13, maybe 14, not a 15, but everyone should buy it anyway.\n\nPalash Ghosh <palash7@hotmail.com> (07.03.2001)\n\nI used to hate Black and Blue - now I regard it as an acceptable disco-ish/reggae-ish record that I would play only if, oh, I had suddenly misplaced about 100 of my CDs!\n\nI will champion Mick Taylor till my dying day -- he gave The Stones the 'muscularity' of their early 1970's albums and they unceremoniously threw him out. Not only that, but Taylor got saddled with a serious heroin addiction for all his trouble -- talk about dedication! Songs like 'Hand of Fate,' 'Hot Stuff', 'Melody' and 'Hey Negrita' aren't too bad, it's just that they sound half-hearted and unfinished, like demos that they had no desire to fully develop.\n\nJesse Sturdevant <3devan@home.com> (07.03.2001)\n\nYes, this one is underrated, but I always thought this was about on par with It's Only Rock n Roll, which is basically your good average Stones record. By the way, Mick Taylor quit, he wasn't fired. Mick and Keith didn't want him to leave. Not sure what he was thinking, and I'm not sure if he does either.\n\nSergey Zhilkin <sergey_jilkin@mail.ru> (29.03.2001)\n\nI don't agree with mr. Gosh here. How is it a 'disco-ish/ reggae-ish' record, I wonder? And how about 'Hand of fate', 'Memory motel', 'Melody', 'Fool to cry' and 'Crazy mama' which occupy more than half of the record? Are they haunters of discos? OK, enough.\n\nThe most interesting thing about this album is that one can't say that this is crap. I mean that this record has something revolutionary deep inside. After all, nobody has ever thought of such album before. These guys are just having ordinary day in studio! Nice idea. And the songs are strong, too. Even 'Hey, Negrita' which, in fact, isn't a song (even though it's melody changes in the middle). My favorite tune here is 'Melody', very calm and relaxing. A good tune to be played in the bar. And, actually, the whole albums looks like it was made for background music. And it's the best 'background album' I've ever heard. 14/15.\n\nDidier Dumonteil <dbdumonteil@wanadoo.fr> (01.04.2001)\n\n\"Memory motel\" is one of my all-time Stones favourite.It's often dismissed as \" a bid for the radios \" but the melody is la crème de la crème de la ballade stonienne.I love everything;the sublime piano intro,K.Richard's harmonies,C.Watts drumming,the trembling of his cymbals as the sounds fades.\"Hot stuff \" is very funky and \"hand of fate\" and \"crazy mama\" are good old time rock and roll.They try their hand at reggae with\" cherry o baby\" with satisfying results.\"Fool to cry\" is not as strong a ballad as \"memory motel\":here mawkishness comes back to the fore.\"Hey negrita \" and \"melody\" are IMHO,throwaways.\n\nThis is the last Stones album I like.I bought some girls,and unlike everybody else,I hated it,so I said to myself:\"you'd better move on\".\n\nRobert Tally <BtheW@aol.com> (12.10.2001)\n\nYes, of course, this album was underrated when it first came out, but I don't think overrating it is quite the right solution. I hated this album when it first came out, but that was mainly because I had an aversion to funky discofied jams like \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Hey Negrita.\" (I know these are only two songs, but let's not underestimate the first impression power of album-side openers.) Nowadays, I really enjoy hearing \"Hot Stuff.\" It's a good groove, and the Stones had been together so long that they had developed a distinctive sound. However, I still wouldn't put this song up there with something like \"Fingerprint File\" from the previous album. As far as \"Hey Negrita\" goes, I'm still not that bowled over. The riff is a bit annoying, but the middle part's pretty cool. There's really only two other jam-heavy tracks on the album. One of these, \"Melody,\" is my favorite, and it's true to its title, with the strongest melody on the album. They could have faded it out a little earlier, though, right after the horn section does that intense thing. \"Cherry Oh Baby\" sounds like a typical reggae tune to me. Perhaps the original version is good, but there's no gracefulness to the Stones version. They'd mastered only the basic elements of reggae, without touching on its more subtle aspects. The rest of the tracks do nothing to raise this album above the level of mediocrity, even though they're full-fledged songs. The two rockers, \"Hand Of Fate\" and \"Crazy Mama,\" are in the traditional Stones rock 'n' roll style. They're both pretty good songs, but don't stray from tried-and-true territory. There's something suspiciously generic about them, and I think they both would have fit comfortably on one those uninspired eighties Stones albums. The two ballads on this album are my least favorite of the tracks. \"Memory Motel\" is melodically uninspired and notably corny. \"Fool To Cry\" is even cornier, and is saved only by having a soulful, ear-catching chorus. Otherwise, it makes \"Angie\" sound like \"Wild Horses\" by comparison. I dispute the idea that this album was deliberately uncommercial. The two ballads prove otherwise. The inclusion of the jams may be an uncommercial move, but I suspect it was merely because they didn't have enough material. In any event, I'm not impressed with this release. For me, it ranges from bad to fairly good, with mostly mediocrity in between. I'd rather listen to Goats Head Soup, and I don't even like that one that much.\n\nRyan Maffei <chaucer@ix.netcom.com> (16.03.2002)\n\nNo, no, no, no, no!!!!!!!!!! No...Black and Blue is not clever and fun. On the contrary, it is blatant, and dumb, and obvious, with some of the most awkward style-shifting and songwriting to ever be found on a Stones album. The grooves are not ridiculously enjoyable, they're dull. And idiotic. Monotonous and dull and idiotic. \"Hot Stuff\" is a penultimate piece of stupidity, and while playing it, they might've found it invigorating and fun, but on record, it just sounds...er...tres bete (damn keyboard without French accent marks!). Hell, maybe for people who like the Stones, Black and Blue passable, but I don't, so I'm inclined to look at the lesser points...of which there are many. So many, I can't imagine why even Stones fans accept this. What's next? We have the charging, Sticky Fingers-y rockers \"Hand of Fate\" and \"Crazy Mama\", which are fine, the former of which is the best track on the album. But then...\"Cheery-O Baby\"?!?!??!?! Utter, stupid, poor, ridiculous idiocy!!!!! How can you like it? Even a reggae parody can't run this long without revealing itself, and if it really is serious, which I think it is, it's the worst piece of banality of 1976, excepting maybe a few disco tunes. And \"Memory Hotel\" and \"Fool to Cry\" are manufactured, cloying, obvious ballads, very little better than the Top 40 staples we see today. Seriously, how can you give these more praise than, say, \"Here Comes the Flood\" by Peter Gabriel, which may be a bit stadium-rock-ish, but GOOD stadium-rock and CEREBRAL stadium rock and WELL-CRAFTED stadium rock...rrrgh. As for the other tracks, sure, \"Melody\" is a fine jazz sendup with some neat Billy Preston work, but \"Hello Negrita\"? HELP ME PLEASE THE STONES HAVE GONE COMPLETELY STUPID!!!!...actually, the album isn't as bad as my angry, er, typing might suggest. It's a 5/10-worthy record...but a 13? The same rating as Pet Sounds? JESUS!!! Where did you go wrong, George, where? What the hell! Mrmmrmghhghhhgrr...(Sorry.)\n\n[Special author note: yes, exactly, the same rating as Pet Sounds. And there's nowhere to go wrong. If you're not able to appreciate the terrific Ron/Keith guitar interplay on 'Hey Negrita', or the creative funky Harvey Mandel leads on 'Hot Stuff', that's not my problem. And nothing on here is any more idiotic than, say, the Ramones' debut. If we start judging rock'n'roll according to those values, all of us will inevitably turn into Auberon Suger.]\n\nJeff <historynut@bright.net> (09.12.2003)\n\nNot a bad effort for an overrated group of dope addicted losers!\n\nBILL SLOCUM <slokes@optonline.net> (22.12.2003)\n\nGiving this album a rating merely two points below perfection is to invite flames, George, and while I admire your guts, I question your judgment. No, Black & Blue is not evil. It's a better album than It's Only Rock N' Roll, in my opinion, but that's not much praise from me. It's not the most underrated Stones album behind only Satanic Majesty (my two choices for that honor would be Emotional Rescue and Bridges To Babylon.) You weigh this one down with praise the work itself doesn't support.\n\nBlack And Blue does have some interesting grooves, and forms a connection between the guitar-hero jams of the Taylor period and the disco-soul makeover of Some Girls. But it's also a mess, with an anemic eight-song track listing, of which three (\"Cherry,\" \"Hey Negrita,\" and \"Melody\") are unambiguous filler and a fourth song, \"Hot Stuff,\" kind of falters into the realm of filler after a promising bit of bass-and-guitar back-and-forthing at the outset. Where was the editor on that one? I guess they were too distracted trying to find their guitarist. Frankly, any album that doubles as an audition session is suspect right there. But only \"Melody\" is actually bad, and the rest is quite good. \"Hand Of Fate\" is a sinewy, propulsive, driving classic, very tight, with solid outlaw lyrics and a great one-shot moment of glory from guitarist Wayne Perkins, who must have said something wrong in the job interview because he nails the studio audition here. \"Fool To Cry\" is a good ballad, a little too Anthony Newley and not as self-aware as you suggest, but not bad, with Charlie setting a tough tempo offset by gentle fills. \"Memory Motel\" is the Holy Grail for Keef lovers, cuz he's singing alongside Mick for about the only time in a studio recording. If it's not the great song its fans think, it still does well with its anthematic pose. \"Crazy Mama\" is the sleeper cut here, a very good if not great Stones rocker that might have lost the ears of many true believers who switched off their eight-tracks angrily whenever \"Fool To Cry\" came on. Do yourself a favor and listen to it, generic title and all. Those guitars deliver on what \"Hot Stuff\" only promised. To quote your review: \"This is the Rolling Stones gracefully allowing us into the midst of their creative activities, and at the same time making the final product more 'artsy' and accessible.\" Actually, replace the words \"Rolling Stones\" with \"Beach Boys,\" and you'd have a point, only the album you'd be describing is Pet Sounds. I agree with your earlier comment about this being more of an informal workout caught on tape, but would add the results were not any great shakes for it. Sometimes, going into the studio with a game plan and a sense of purpose is for the best, as it would be for the Stones their next time out. LOVE YOU LIVE\n\nJeff <Jkh1392@aol.com> (06.09.99)\n\nNot Ya-Ya's, but second best ain't too shabby. Solid all the way through, barring \"You Got To Move.\" The rest is sloppy and rocking, just like the Stones should be. It's almost as if they felt the need to show the world they were still a rock band after the wierdness of Black & Blue. My only disagreement with you is over the \"If You Can't Rock Me / Get Off Of My Cloud\" medley. It's my favorite moment on the whole album!! Billy Preston really boogies on the piano there. I liked \"Rock Me\" in the first place, and \"Cloud\" may not sound anything like the original, but it rocks hard enough that you don't mind at all. Side three is friggin fantastic, by the way. Oh, and I believe the guitar solo on \"Brown Sugar\" was overdubbed in the studio. Wish I knew who it was playing it....\n\nSimon Hearn <simon@leehearn.freeserve.co.uk> (11.09.99)\n\nIt is not ya ya's, but there are some good tracks on here. (I think Flashpoint is better that this myself. Why does it get the same mark?) The best tracks are the classics - 'brown sugar', which as George has pointed out has fab guitar work - one of the best versions of the song I've heard I think; 'jack flash' and 'sympathy' are also good. A good live album, not up to the standard of ya ya's or flashpoint\n\nTony Stewart <tony.remi.stewart@worldnet.att.net> (12.02.2000)\n\nLet's go with Love You Live. A Ya-Ya's it ain't but what is? This is actually the last in line of those 70's discs suddenly getting their long overdue praise. At the time of this writing this very disc is actually among aficionados turning into one of the most appreciated discs of the day. Having exhausted all the talk about the \"B2B\" and \"NS\" Tours and Discs, attention has shifted via the headscratching performances of one Ron Wood on those tours to the good ole days when he played his ass off. And since there are very few good in quality Concert Recordings out there, from what it seems, this is the Disc to really get an idea of Ron in his early days with the Stones. A wildly overdone Stageshow, with the Stones still learning how to manage ArenaRock successfully, Jagger mainly being too out of breath than to do more than bark the lyrics, Keith and Ron both indulging heavily even ON stage(if we are to believe Ron), plus the insufferable Billy Preston feeling more and more at home resulted in some great Shows , but not really in great music. Keith was for the first time showing a little bit of lackluster in his playing, Jagger was not there to cover this time so it was really left to Preston and to a boy who did more than just rise to the challenge: Ron blew the roof off the house nightly. He got Wyman back in the fold and his great Zemaitis sound played in that percussive style jived well with Ollie brown 's little shop behind the ever rock solid Charlie. The Disc really showcases the best of the tour The highpoint of course is Side 3 at the El Mocambo, where all this dissappeared and we just had the greatest R&R Band in the World firing on all cylinders. One of the best sides of any disc they've ever released, \"Mannish Boy\", has just a plain scary Harmonica break\"Around & Around\" sounds like straight from '64, the Reggae tinged\"Crackin' Up\" has Jagger just sounding like he's enjoying himself blabbering in some silly \"Island\" patois, the introductions are a hoot and the gem of what we hear of the show must be the Two Slided \"Little red Rooster\". A wonderfully restrained Organpart only adds to the Swampfeel. Fabulous!\n\nThe other three sides are an entirely different animal:\"Honky Tonk Woman\" IMHO is probably their worst opening number ever and doesn't quite get the place shaking, right into the medley of \"If You Can't Rock Me\" where that mean break gets a little more of the respect it deserves, and acting as a segueway into a great boogie version of \"Get Off Of My Cloud\" with spicy little Pianofills in between the singing. \"Happy\" during the '70's was as always just barely croaked out by Keith, carried by Mick and really just showcased the loveable Richards to his ever growing Fanbase. It also served as proof that he was indeed alive and awake. \"Hot Stuff\" turned into a Motherf*cker during that Tour. Mean and a lot wilder than the clean Studioversion. Ron's Guitar thunders away. \"Starfucker\" served three purposes: 1) It forced Keith to actually really play, cause Keith is drawn to a Berry-type Rocker like a Bee to Honey. 2) It brought out that stupid inflatable dick and 3) It served as great Photo opportunities with Mick and Ron singing the Chorus. A lot of Side A sounds rushed; has a lot to do with Jagger being out of breath. \"Tumbling Dice\"is played Keith's way - slow! It never quite reaches any magic. \"You Gotta Move\" was a crime!! A shameless Photo -setup, with of all people Ollie providing the meat of the vocals. I have heard a version of this one in Germany where Jagger sang about 3 notes. Keith solos incessantly, and Ron hits a chord here and there. Preston meanwhile is already gauging the stage for his Solospot. This has NOTHING whatsoever to do with the Fred McDowell swampy Blues off of Sticky. Now where I must seriously disagree with George is on the solo of \"YCAGWYW\". Yes gone is the nice melodic ON the beat Virtuoso playing of taylor, who more and more had forgotten what syncopation sounded like and that sometimes less is more. Ron attacks this song from a completely different angle; a lot bluesier and IMO and I think a lot of others this solo is one of the highlights of the disc. Especially when he busts into the riffing towards the end of the solo. I'm NOT going to get into a Taylor/Wood debate here.'Fingerprint File\" I completely agree with George. I was actually surprised at how WELL they did with that one on stage. Jagger got to play guitar and Preston was edging his way around the Keyboards already. Side 4 always surprises me. Now called the Hot Rocks Section they actually pull them off a lot less perfunctorily than one would expect. Especially\"It's Only R&R\" flies. The Stones ALWAYS play well in Paris. \"Brown Sugar\" cooks too. Reason there is no Sax solo probably had a lot to do with there being no Bobby either. \"Sympathy\" I wasn't so sure about until one day someone had a Tape playing in the car and it was just music and I immediately thought to myself for just one second before i recognized it\"Who the hell is that? They are kicking some ass!\" I love when that happens. Too often do we compare the stones against their own incredibly high standards and forget that at their worst they are still miles ahead of the rest. Love the Artwork; attended the Party and got my Disc autographed by a VERY grumpy Keith and by Charlie who actually seemed more nervous than me. That's cause he's a Kidder... Tony PS Give this one a 13.\n\njpcs <jpcs@xtra.co.nz> (09.06.2000)\n\nHere's why a whole generation of rock fans gave up on the Stones,right here.I've heard many small-town pub bands (& Grand Funk Railroad) playing way better versions of Stones songs than this,and Jagger's vocals are just gross. Still,pretty good 3rd side - \"Mannish Boy \" almost makes this thing \"worth it\".At that time tho',this just seemed like a spit in the face of their fans ( I was a teenager in the late '70s and paid money for this record - you weren't,which is probably why you don't understand school-of-'77 punk rock)\n\n<JJFSFTD68@aol.com> (31.03.2001)\n\nThis is a pretty decent live album. Probably their 3rd best offical live release. What bothers me about it though, is that it is in no way, shape or form an accurate representation of how great the 75-76 tour was. I have atleast 6 bootlegs from that particular tour and they are all far better than this. I don't think the guitar solo in 'Brown Sugar' was overdubbed simply because they did hotter verisons through out the tour. 'Sympathy For The Devil' is not up to par with the Ya-Ya's verison or the studio verison but it's still 'Sympathy For The Devil', possibly the greatest song of all time. The thing that bugs me about this one is that they left off the incredible verisons of 'Hand Of Fate', 'Midnight Rambler' and the longer verison of 'You Can't Always Get What You Want'. If You ever doubted Keith Richard's incredible guitar virtuosoity, listen to these tracks and all doubts will be erased. Good verison of 'Starfucker' but overrall they didn't release the right stuff.\n\nRobert Tally <BtheW@aol.com> (17.10.2001)\n\nThe barking begins. But this is pretty much my only gripe. Generally, the Stones turn in a good performance throughout this set. Some moments are better than others. For instance, there's little I can find fault with on side three. \"Mannish Boy\" is very effective, and \"Crackin' Up\" is virtually flawless. \"Little Red Rooster\" is arguably the best track on the album. \"Around And Around\" is an unexpectedly upbeat surprise. Other highlights on the album including the laidback versions of \"Tumbling Dice\" and \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" (count me among those that like the solo), the suitably funky \"Fingerprint File\" and \"Hot Stuff,\" and as usual, \"Sympathy For The Devil,\" which builds up quite well towards the end. A couple of the rockers, \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\" and \"Star Star\" come across pretty well. A couple of them don't: \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Jumping Jack Flash\" are both rushed and sport the most incomprehensible and self-parodic Jagger vocals yet committed to record. The energy, nevertheless, is infectious. Also notably rushed are \"Happy\" and the \"If You Can't Rock Me\"/\"Get Off Of My Cloud\" medley. \"You Gotta Move\" is a bit unfocused, but not too much of a letdown. \"Honky Tonk Women\" suffers from being the set-opener. Most bands sound they've just gotten out of bed when they start a show, and this is no exception. Needless to say, it's been all but scientifically proven that Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out is a better album. However, this one's still good, and supports the notion that the Stones were one of the best bands of the 70s, if not as good as their former selves.\n\nAnthony Stewart <sweetblackangel@speedfactory.net> (07.04.2002)\n\nI am a diehard Stonesfan and will always be. But this has nothing to do with not \"understanding\" the Punkrock movement of '77. FYI I was at exactly the same age (17) when I BOUGHT that disc with money I had worked for. And let me tell you something about the Punkrock movement. You guys in the USA never 'got it' to begin with. I came over here and it was a fashion thing. Over in London and Germany it was political. It was working a class movement. What did the US offer the Punkrock movement? Ramones? A` la Phil Spector? Blondie? Talking Heads? The only cool band I saw in NYC was the Contortions and they of course could not land a decent contract. The West Coast started their own respectable movement after a while but honestly; I was living in the USA at that point and playing a lot and we opened for the Clash and the Police (when they were still considered 'Punk') and I will NEVER say anything bad about the Clash but that Policeband was actually taking pre-show showers and running around in terrycloth robes before going on stage, making sure their blonde hairdye was still in order.\n\nNavin MV <navin_mv@yahoo.com> (06.11.2003)\n\nI am a Stones fan from India, was going through your site recently, something that I could not help pointing out:\n\n>From your review on the Stones album, 'Love you live' 'Brown Sugar' is played at least three times faster than the original, and incorporates a totally mind-blowing, unbelievable guitar solo from Ronnie. Ronnie? Is that really Ronnie? Playing with such precision at such speed? Anyway, I have a deep suspicion that that actual solo was overdubbed later in the studio... as it - sad to say - often happens with the Stones' live releases. And from 'Rewind': Oh yes, and there's a performance of 'Brown Sugar', cut-and-pasted from several live shows and set to the sound of the version on Love You Live. Just like to point out that I have the Paris '76 video which includes the above mentioned complete version of 'Brown Sugar' with no cuts or pastes from other shows...the credits at the end of the Rewind video also mention Paris 1976 as one of the sources...so no overdubbing! SOME GIRLS\n\nJeff <Jkh1392@aol.com> (06.09.99)\n\nWell, I think it's better than Black & Blue. Of course, I've only heard that one once, so I never really got the chance to get into it. I may change my mind once I've heard it again. As for this here record, I really like that title track. Sounds sort of like one of them slinky Aerosmith tunes (back when they were good; like Rocks-era). Speaking of which, whoever decided that Aerosmith were Stones ripoffs? Listen to Sticky Fingers, then listen to Toys In the Attic. They both rock pretty hard, but that's the only connection I'm seeing.\n\nSimon Hearn <simon@leehearn.freeserve.co.uk> (08.09.99)\n\nHow can you say this is equal to black and blue? This is far superior - better songs, better playing and most of all a semi-cleaned up Keith. 'Miss you' is fantastic - compare it to 'Hot Stuff' - no contest. There is not one bad song on this album, whereas Black and Blue has some right dodgy stuff.\n\nPS. I saw Mick perform 'some girls' in concert after his recent fatherhood experience - I cannot tell you what an hilarious moment it was!\n\nGlenn Wiener <glennjwiener@hotmail.com> (30.09.99)\n\nThis one I just don't care for at all. Out of ten songs I believe five or six are all written in the same key of A. Geez thats creativity for you. The singles 'Miss You' and 'Beast Of Burden' just get stale after a while. 'Respectable' rocks pretty hard, 'Some Girls' grooves along nice, and 'Before They Make Me Run' has a nice tone to it. 'Far Away Eyes' is a bit cute. However, the rest just doesn't take me anywhere special.\n\nTony Stewart <tony.remi.stewart@worldnet.att.net> (14.02.2000)\n\nLately I've noticed that every Review I do I start off with some comment on a disc od 'review' that has scrolled before I get to my destination. This time around i couldn't help but notice someone comparing Some Goirls to Black'n BLU; but since this since this respected reviewer had only heard B&B ONE time all he had to say about it that it sure sounded like an Aerosmith title and he didn't quite agree with the painfully obvious comparisons between the Stones and Aerosmith. Well he is right in one aspect. There are very few comparisons. Aerosmith is not even in the sme league as the stones, Perry never having grasped what the Blues are about, Tyler having to surgically alter his face to resemble Mick and that guy without a chin definetly not doing much 'ancient guitar weaving ' with Ole Joe. Nuff sid.\n\nSome Girls VERY obviously answers the challenge from the Punks, especially after the Stones were especially vulnerable to such criticism hurled at them after the Tour of Excess of '75/'76, where music was definetely taking a backseat to the fireworks etc. Well, the best thing in a way that could have happened to them at first looked like disasters. Keith's bust and Taylor's leaving. But what we got out of this imbroglio (=mess for the Aerosmith dude) was a rejuvenated Keith and Ron in 5th gear all over the place, practically producing this gem of an album. The music goes straight to the core of the Stones. Short, no-nonsense rockers in A and E, very witty lyrics with all the hoopla going on around their private lives and the occasional masterpiece thrown in for good measure. I was in NYC when this Disc came out and I can unequivocally say it was the Summer of the Stones. \"Miss You\" blared from every Boombox; black, white, puerto rican...The Tour is still the most fun the stones and the fans have ever had together, and Jagger just about seemed as if he had risen from the dead. Gone were the Feathers and Boas and Crotchrubbing with Preston; Hello to ripped up plastic Rockstar, licking everything he could wrap that tongue around and really re-inventing his Stage persona. I remember the first '78 show I saw in Philly and jagger in that Beret was doing these absurd Clownmoves and I'm thinking\"What the F*ck is this?\" But Nureyev couldn't have done it better. The set for the only time ever consisted practically of the entire new disc. \"Miss You\" the intangible. By now a sing along in concert it was set to a Discobeat, jagger sounded utterly convincing and Charlie I think pulls off the only No 1 Charttopper ever without playing a single drumfill. George is right when he puts this one in the category of ballads. Strictly minor key, even though it pumped in the discos every night, when Jagger cries\"sometimes I feel abandoned\" we are not left with the aftertaste of just having \"rocked' out. Too much soul. Wyman plays a great bassline, several lines have become absolute classics. It was what the stones BADLY needed. A Megahit! \"When The Whip Comes Down\", \"Lies\", \"Respectable\" are all straight forward rockers, obvious crowd pleasers, but with such great subtleties thrown in, like the guitar army dominated by Woody's Slide on \"Whip\", the nonsensical garage joy of \"Lies\" and the naughty lyrics of \"Respectable\", which by now has found a very solid Live arrangement. \"Just My Imagination\" at ALL '78 Shows I saw was the highpoint. It is a wonderful song to begin with and the Stones drove it home with such fervor and passion everytime; I tip my hat. \"Some Girls\" always seems to fit the times, lyrically. Right now of course they pulled it out for the Brazilian busted rubber, in '78 the lyrics almost gave Jesse Jackson a heartattack and Zuma Beach was referring to Dylan's divorce proceedings. Plus there was some other busted Jagger rubber that had caused a scandal somewhere on the planet at the time; can't remember where... \"Far Away Eyes\" is already hilarious, but I have to agree with Keith who insists it was even funnier, until the last vocal take when Jagger laid on that silly accent. It was ten times funnier sung straight as the Outtakes prove, but unlike Keith, Jagger has always had a hard time taking Country seriously. \"Before They Make Me Run\" has turned into one of Keith's anthems, and deservedly so. With the bust, the eventual sentencing, his detox going down he couldn't have written a funnier/more serious song than this one. Once again Keith claims his place as the ultimate Outlaw. \"Beast Of Burden\" with it's beautiful Guitar interplay and great vocals, especially that last verse with the slapback on the Reverb was an instant fave especially with the chicas. Jagger going'..pretty pretty pretty..oooh..' brought back memories of the early sixties with chicks just screaming\"Oh Mick, you're rough enough for me...\"The masterpiece saved for last sums it all up. This has been a total NYC disc and no song ever rocked the to the New york Groove as well as \"Shattered\". Jagger is said to be especially proud of the lyrics and the vocal delivery and I agree. He outdoes himself. First time I heard that tune I sat there with my mouth hanging open. There is this beautiful little Pedal Steel Slide coming out of the Guitar solo which I just love. ONE note! The lyrics I don't even want to get into . every line is a classic. And this time you can also understand them. 'Shmattah shmattah shmattah.....' 15\n\nSeth Edwards <sethed@home.com> (09.09.2000)\n\n8/10? I think this album deserves a 9 myself. Everybody knows 'Miss You' so well for a reason, its a damn good song! Although if you say this is a commercial product because it sounds like punk, what about some of their earlier output? The heavy drumbeat and riffage in \"19th Nervous Breakdown\" sounds like punk to me...but thats not a commercial single? I've never heard Black and Blue, so maybe upon listening to that my opinion of this one will change. \"Beast of Burden\" is an absolute classic, my favorite from this one. Much better than the Bette Middler version, which I sadly heard once on the radio. At least its not Britney Spears doing \"Satisfaction\".\n\nBrian Adkins <badkins@mail.calltech.com> (21.11.2000)\n\nHow are you gonna give a review about some girls without mentioning the song 'far away eyes'. This is an awesome song and its the stones using a country beat. I love listening to Jaggar sing those lyric, just marvelous.\n\nRaghu Mani <raghu_mani@yahoo.com> (01.01.2000)\n\nNot as good as some people seem to think but great nontheless. There isn't a weak track on the album but there aren't that many outstanding ones either. The lone cover is 'Just My Imagination' which is a rather unfortunate choice from my point of view (being a huge Temptations fan). Once you have heard the Temptations do this song, nobody else's cover can come close. Not to say that this is bad but given how good the Stones' covers can be (often a lot better than the originals), this is a disappointment. The best songs are the faux-disco of 'Miss You' and the last two songs - 'Beast of Burden' and 'Shattered'. I'd give it an 8.\n\n<Ogdensgoneflake@aol.com> (19.01.2001)\n\nSome Girls is my favorite Stones album right now ( shamefully I only have Aftermath, Fingers and Exile) but out of those I like this the best. Someone on Amazon said it was the dirtiest album ever and she's right, I always have to take a shower after listening to it. The album is over flowing with sex, prostatution, sex, alchol, sex and New York, need I say more. The worst song here is the title cut but its not very bad. 'Imagination' is real nice and 'Miss You' is catchy as hell. The last three songs are the best here. 'Shattered' and 'Beast Of Burden' are fabulous and one of my favorite Stone songs is 'Before They Make Me Run', I always Kieth's confessional songs.\n\nPalash Ghosh <palash7@hotmail.com> (23.02.2001)\n\nSome Girls was, in my humble opinion, The Stones last good album - and it was the record that really introduced the group to those of us who were teens in the 1970's and missed out on their glory years. It is also remarkable that Keith performed here under the threat of a possible life sentence arising from heroin smuggling charge in Canada --maybe this gave him some perverse impetus to put out a really good album.\n\nAs for the songs, I can't find any weak tracks, though nothing really hits you upside the noggin as a super-classic, except maybe 'Shattered.' 'Miss You' is a tune that instantly reminds me of the summer of 1978, but it hasn't aged too well (but that line about 'Po Rican girls just dyin' to meetchyou' still makes me laugh). I generally dislike The Stones' early covers of African-American blues and Motown songs - this is mostly because they tried to simply make a Xerox carbon copy; and, if you'll pardon the expression, The Stones' versions usually 'paled' in comparison to the originals! An exception to this is the way they do 'Just my imagination' -- I might even say that The Stones' version betters the original. I attribute this to the fact that Mick and Keith 'tailored' this Motown classic to make it sound more like a Stones track (much like the early Beatles took covers like 'Money' and 'Twist and Shout' and remade them sound more like Beatle originals). The awesomely swampy and visceral title track, 'Some girls' just SMOKES with sex, venom and nastiness. Mick's smutty lyrics are clearly elucidated (unlike many of his other 'porny' odes). My two fave tracks here are the country-flavored 'Far away eyes' (funny story included) and of course, 'Shattered.' I heard the latter somewhere recently and it sounded so original, so fresh, so lively, so eccentric -- like it could've been done by some heavy metal/rap hybrid group yesterday. It's a pity The Stones didn't come up with more interesting, catchy, energetic numbers like this more often in their 'middle age.'\n\nSergey Zhilkin <sergey_jilkin@mail.ru> (26.04.2001)\n\nIf anybody makes me listen for a punk/disco album for a whole day, I will choose Some girls. The good news: Jagger is still singing (and not barking like he did on later records) and the band still has new ideas, which< by the way, means that they are not old farts yet.\n\nIt was 1978, a year of New Wave coming and the band had to do something with it. After all, they were always adequate and in fashion, so the mix of rock, punk and disco was a nice idea. Indeed, just look at 'Miss you'. Disco-bass rules! And Jagger's voice fits it perfectly. 'When the whip comes down' was ripped off of Velvet Underground's 'Venus in furs', but nevertheless, it sounds very fresh. 'Just my imagination' is a cover of Whitfield/Strong's original and it's cool, too. See, the last Stones' cover was tasteless 'Ain't too proud to beg' while this track shows that they still have good taste. Oh, and then comes my favorite song on here - 'Some girls'. I have not so many words to describe this masterpiece but I'll try. You know, I've never heard such harmony of rhythm, slide guitar and drums. The modern lyrics are cool, too. This song should be among the best creations of Jagger/Richards. From the others I enjoy 'Before they make me run' and very calm 'Beast of Burden'. The rest of the tracks are a little bit lousy but that's okay. Oh, and special thanks to the designer of the cover.\n\nJaime Vargas <j.vargas@aznar.es> (24.09.2001)\n\nGlenn Wiener says that most of SG is in the key of A...but: at least 7 songs in Beggars Banquet are in E, and you like that one, don't you?\n\nRobert Tally <BtheW@aol.com> (23.10.2001)\n\nThis has gone down in history as one of the best Stones albums, and frankly, it isn't too hard to see why. It's pretty commercial stuff. Personally, I enjoy this release quite a lot, although it's probably at least in part nostalgic, since I played it to death when I was a teenager. Somehow, this is one of those albums where I actually like the hits the most. My favorite is \"Shattered,\" which is pretty insubstantial from a songwriting perspective, but is more fun than I'd ever expect a Stones tune to be. \"Miss You\" is also quite excellent, but also a bit insubstantial. This one really wreaked havoc on my concept of disco sucking. \"Beast Of Burden\" is one of the only serious pieces of songwriting on the whole album, and is quite well done. None of the other songs really bowl me over, but they're all fairly enjoyable. Among the \"punk\" rockers, I prefer \"Respectable.\" \"Lies\" and \"When The Whip Comes Down\" are relatively one-dimensional. \"Before They Make Me Run\" is kind of catchy, although it sounds like they didn't spend a lot of time on Keith's stuff during this period. \"Just My Imagination\" is a pretty decent cover of the Temptations song. \"Some Girls\" is amusing, if not great. \"Far Away Eyes\" is one of those songs that's extremely amusing, and at the same time, looks foolish in light of earlier country parodies such as \"Dear Doctor.\" I tend to think of this album as being in the middle of the pack when it comes to '70s Stones albums, somewhat on a par with It's Only Rock 'n Roll.\n\nFor those looking for every Stones track, you'll need to find the compilation Sucking In The Seventies, which includes \"Everything Is Turning To Gold,\" the less-than-enthralling B-side of \"Shattered.\" It also includes a decent live version of \"When The Whip Comes Down.\" There was also an extended edit of \"Miss You\" from the 12-inch single which includes quite a lot of stuff that's not on the album edit. The only official CD release it appears on is the double CD Flashpoint + Collectibles. Also, there was an extended edit of \"Beast Of Burden\" included on the 8-track version of Some Girls, which is currently unavailable.\n\nRyan Maffei <chaucer@ix.netcom.com> (17.03.2002)\n\nIn spite of myself, I must admit that Some Girls, while silly in spots, is a very good album, and one of the Stones' best, ever. On an album where even the disco-rocker (\"Miss You\") and country monologue (\"Far Away Eyes\") are respectively well-crafted and winningly hilarious, everything is worth listening to more than a few critically-based times. In addition, the rockers here are a nice return to the engrossing, classic riff-rock of Sticky Fingers, and many of these tracks (\"When the Whip Comes Down\", \"Respectable\", \"Some Girls\") are exemplary of what the best material off of Exile on Main Street should of been like. An 8, but thrillingly close to a 9. Hm.\n\nAnthony Stewart <sweetblackangel@speedfactory.net> (07.04.2002)\n\nI don't know but I can name each tune and add a flavor that grabs me:\n\n'Miss You' - The mastertrick of the year! Right in the height of Punk's arrival the Stones pull out one of their biggest hits ever and it is Disco. It was just the comical side of it. The nerve. Plus Jagger's singing, the Preston -inspired Bassline and the first reference to the Big Apple off the disc \"I was walking Central Park...\" 'When The Whip Comes Down' - Intricate guitarwork; excellent Slide by Ron; and hilarious lyrics 'Just My Imagination' - Like the other guy said - if you're going to do a Covertune do it your way. Don't try to copy what has already been done. The Stones turned this beautiful ballad into a pure raunchy Stonesrocker, and it smoked LIVE. 'Some Girls' - For some reason the only tune they did not play in '78. Finally pulled it out in '99 but by then Jagger had become so politically correct that now it's \"white girls who want to get fucked all night...\" Love the alternating leads on the studiotrack. 'Lies' - This one is great! It is so balls to the walls; there is no sense to it and the only reason to listen to it is to turn it up to 11. 'Far Away Eyes' - GREAT song. Nice story with a touch of humor and a touch of truckstop melancholy. Ron was still PLAYING that Pedalsteel in those days. 'Respectable' - I really like how that song has eveloved over the years. In '99 it had a very specific arrangement with those descending guitarlines. And like on every tune off that disc Jagger sticks it to someone: in this case it is Bianca's turn. 'Before They Make Me Run' - Only Keith, the R&R Outlaw could have written this facing what he was facing. I absolutely HATE being lumped in with the masses who go \"Yeah Keeeeiith! Rock'n Roll Outlaw!\" But in this case it just happens to be true. Excellent guitar changes in the song with a cool Solo by Ron. 'Beast Of Burden' - Great Drumming! And great song! I read about the recoring of this tune how Mick and Keith stayed all night after the basic track was cut and worked on layering all the Vocals, Back-ups etc. 'Shattered' - IMHO a work of genius. Just EXCELLENT lyrics speedrapped over a Killer phased Guitarriff. If you listen real close you will hear Ron slide out of the Guitarsolo with just one overlapping note that carries the tune back into the groove. I lived with Sid Vicious at the Chelsea in NYC and he used to say that Johnny Lydon loved Some Girls and wished they could write like that. Sid was a smart guy. He told me that what Lydon really respected what witticism - and he felt that after all the public slaggings he'd been dishing out towards the Stones, he (Lydon) was impressed with the comeback from them in form of that disc.\n\nChristoph Stross <a0106848@unet.univie.ac.at> (28.05.2004)\n\nThat's both Charlie and Ronnie playing the drums on 'Shattered'.\n\nKeith has never been a singer in the actual sense of the word and will never be, but his lead vocals on 'Before They Make Me Run' work just well with this song. Not to mention Keith's bass on this one... how come, that many great basses on Stones songs are played by someone else than Bill? 'Miss You' is not as great as some say it is, not as bad as others say it is. On second thought, I find it quite good. You gotta not believe the conservative Stones fan who doesn't tolerate any influence of newer styles anyway. If the Stones would have done this, we would only have albums sounding like their debut (not that I would dislike Englands Newest Hitmakers, but I prefer some innovation).\n\nAlexey Provolotsky <alpro@tut.by> (15.12.2005)\n\nIt turned out that I was totally wrong when thought that the Stones died in the early 70s. This is even better than Tattoo You! Naturally, if we consider the year it was recorded, well notice disco and punk, but if we actually listen to Some Girls, we wont notice much of those. Of course, Miss You is a disco number, but aside from that, nothing, really. Well, maybe Beast Of Burden would qualify, but I believe the guys could do that without the Saturday Night Fever. As for punk influences, I dont know. This is pure rnr, driving and fast. The only thing that could make anyone think of such influences is possibly that Black And Blue was rather a quiet, relaxed effort.\n\nThe Music? Delightful! The aforementioned Miss You, Some Girls (there is some weirdness about the song (perhaps reached by the wonderful production) that makes it the best song on the whole album), Far Away Eyes (even if you wont appreciate the humour, you will laugh at the way Jagger sings) and, of course, both Beast Of Burden and Shattered are nothing but classics. Such songs as When The Whip Comes Down and Lies could be regarded as filler, but instead they are not, cause the Stones can make a good song great by simply PLAYING it. The energy comes from every friggin hole. Respectable is another fine rocker, done with a certain gusto that we always expect from the band. Finally, Before They Make Me Run is a catchy Richards tune (sung annoyingly enough) and as for the cover, its okay, but I would have rather heard some original instead. Still, nice. Speaking about the lyrics, I should say its odd they put some geographical name in almost every song. Seriously, while listening to Rolling Stones records, I always feel they composed the lyrics in the process of playing or at least in a couple of minutes (like they want, well do). There is no rhythm in the lyrics and Jagger can sing a dozen phrases between any word combination. See, Im not complaining. And as for the challenging lines of Some Girls, Id say they are really challenging (I also believe they made that up, but otherwise the song is brilliant, so ). As for the rating, I give it a very high 13. Like I said, its better than Tattoo You, but I still cant give this a 14, as much as I want to. Also, have I mentioned that the cover is good? No? Thats right, the cover aint good. EMOTIONAL RESCUE\n\nSimon Hearn <simon@leehearn.freeserve.co.uk> (07.09.99)\n\nIt pains me to listen to this - although it did provide the boys with their first no 1 since '73. This is their lowest point, but then again there was dirtywork and undercover!\n\nSimon Hearn <simon@leehearn.freeserve.co.uk> (26.09.99)\n\nI have just listened to this album for the first time in months. It is a lot better than I remember it. 'Dance (pt1)', which I know you hate, really isn't that bad. Ok it goes nowhere, but the rhythm is good and it is danceable. It is throwaway, but not worse that anything off undercover. I also love 'Send it to me' - really good tune and sounds like the stones having fun in the studio again. 'Indian Girl' is atrocious, but the rest of the album is forgettable music, not atrocious music. The third worst stones album after dirty work and undercover. Try it for yourself - you may be surprised\n\n<LedZep3206@aol.com> (21.11.99)\n\nI bought this album based on \"She's So Cold,\" and I must say I hated the rest of the album (with the exception of \"All About You\"...I think I love all of Keith's songs).\n\nGlenn Wiener <glennjwiener@hotmail.com> (22.01.2000)\n\nThis record just has not held up well for me over time. When I buy a record, I hope that there are more good songs then filler material. On Beggars Banquet there are nine high quality tracks and one decent track. On this collection, its about a fifty/fifty success rate. 'Down In The Hole' is a stunning blues jam performed with some passion by Mickey man. 'Let Me Go', 'Where The Boys Go', and 'Summer Romance' have some spirit as well. 'Dance Part 1' has an interesting groove. However, the rest varies from just OK to somewhat annoying. And as a whole, the Stones were slumping in the seventies as their mediocre streak hit three with this release.\n\nTony Stewart <tony.remi.stewart@worldnet.att.net> (20.02.2000)\n\nThis one always has struck me with Undercover as one of the most overlooked Stonesdiscs. This one I hate to say rightfully so. Released on the coattails of Some Girls it had that same Sophomore slot to fill that Goat's Head Soup had. Coming on the heel of a classic it's hard. I myself have always believed the best thing to do after a monster album is to go 180 degrees the other way; not try to capitalize on the success of the former. On Emotional Rescue sadly that is exactly what the Stones did; but taking the short fast rockers to an almost parodic level. It was also the FIRST disc of the return of Keith. Keith himself has said on numerous occasions that it took Jagger years to grow reaccustomed to having the 'real' Keith around. It's very much an experimental album. We are able to feel the Stones tring to sort out the new power balance within the inner vortex of the band. Wyman growing increasingly distant, Charlie growing more independent, quietly filing his style down to one of the most lethal razorsharp weapons in Rock, Keith returning albeit, still a little tentatively. Ron still firmly in his position of a major force and player; to use the old cliche`\"I was the bridge between Mick and Keith\". And a newly revitalized Mick, who had learned a lot about playing guitar and who also foresaw the advent of a whole new world opening up with MTV and PCs. \"The interminable \"Dance Pt 1\" opens the disc. Keith fought long and hard to keep this an instrumental, while Jagger, I believe realized that this groove needed some lyrics. He never did find anything worth writing home about. Still we ended up with two completely different versions of this one. \"Summer Romance\" and \"Where The Boys Go\" straight from the fruitful Pathe Marconi Sessions were redone and sound very very forced with Mick laying on this Cockney accent, that is almost laughable. The guitars on \"Summer\" are lethal though. \"Let Me Go\" and \"Send It To Me\" again, by Rolling Stones standards, are Fillermaterial. So what do we like? Well, the first glimpse I had of this new disc was the Titletune on a Car radio in Rotterdam. I was out of circulation for about 8-9 months. And I'm driving down the road one day and start grooving to this tune which is coming in with a pretty lousy reception. The falsetto threw me for a while, but when that unmistakeable Jagger voice comes growling in I hit the ceiling; almost caused an accident. \"It's the new Stones!!!\" I yell at my passenger. Anyone who doesn't get the joke at the end of the tune has no sense of humor. Of course it's over the top. A great Disco romp with Ron on Bass and the fender rhodes and Snare really being all we need here. \"Indian Girl\" is pure Jagger. The lyrics come off a little hollow. This has often been Jagger's problem, because Jagger DOES care, this I believe. But he had early on made the decision to not make too many \"political\" statements. Too easy to get stereotyped into a corner. The Nicaragua visit with Biance supposedly really shook him up and once again he immediately went out and did something about it. We are now years later, but the Middle American political had gotten if anything worse. Again a heartfelt, beautiful ballad like this one did not need an affected vocal delivery is my only criticism. \"Down In The Hole\" on the other hand takes us to a different part of the globe; the Eastbloc. And if ever anyone could pull off a great paranoid Blues about the Iron Curtain it was Jagger. This is IMHO a great tune worthy of their legacy. Then we also have \"She's So Cold\". Ok. Every tune I have mentioned so far ( and this one is no exception) is either one's favorite tune of the disc or they can't stand it. \"She's So Cold\" is an almost childlike melody , it is so simple, and the lyrics fit right in with it. That is why it became pretty popular. I myself have always dug the production of the tune the supercompressed, superclean guitars. Very dry! And Jagger screaming on top about every play on words about 'hot' and 'cold', backed by a great Snare. The song itself i think from day one has never done that much for me. But in my mind ALL is forgiven once the beautiful album closer \"All About You\" rolls around. The story goes that Keith had the chord progression and it struck him as so natural that he thought he was subconciously stealing another song. He played it to everyone he knew. No one recognized it, so he said\"F*ck it, this is mine\", and left us with a wonderful ballad and very telling lyrics. Keith always has worn his heart on his sleeve and although everyone assumed it was about Anita, Keith insists it was very conciously written with Jagger in mind. But Jagger, Anita, Marianne, Woody, Gram Parsons...all just a bunch of Stones that rolled through Keith's life. Hard to judge this one in a number. Make it 12.\n\nPalash Ghosh <palash7@hotmail.com> (07.03.2001)\n\n\"Emotional Rescue\" is just an awful, terrible, ridiculous, boring, sickening (have I run out of adjectives?) record. There is no reason for anyone on the planet to ever waste their time or money on this piece of worthless crap. If anyone needed explicit proof that The Stones stayed around far too long, this album is Exhibit A.\n\n'She's So Cold' is the only song on here that has any life to it at all  and that's hardly praise of any kind!\n\nSergey Zhilkin <sergey_jilkin@mail.ru> (16.05.2001)\n\nSo I'm really far from dismissing almost the whole album like you do, George. The opener is a very catchy song with incredible backing vocals which bring really much to the song. Its only flaw is its length - Jagger could easily cut it to a 3-minute song or so. 'Send it to me' is catchy, too. I know, it's a generic boogie but, man, Stones made this track and it sounds good. Another generic tune here is 'Down in the hole'. Just old nice blues with Jagger who is still singing (and that's the last album where he sings - remember 'Start me up' on next record?). 'She's so cold' really stands out, too. Goofy lyrics that are repeated hundred times with fast upbeat tune really work on here. And for these songs I'm ready to buy 'Emotional rescue'. A good effort.\n\nOK, surely it's not that good cause when I listen to it I feel like searching gems in huge load of trash but, George, these gems really pump the rating of album up to 10.\n\nRobert Tally <BtheW@aol.com> (01.11.2001)\n\nThe Stones managed to get to the end of the '70s without putting out a truly bad album. With such less-than-stellar outings as Goats Head Soup and Black And Blue, it looked like they were always on the verge of releasing a stinker. They managed to finish the decade without this happening, however. Then 1980 rolled around and we were treated to Emotional Rescue, which unfortunately gave us an idea of what was in store for us during the subsequent decade. If this isn't the worst Stones album, then it's certainly very close. The only track on here that I can't find much fault with is \"Let Me Go,\" which I think is quite catchy. Several of the others are fairly enjoyable, but problematic. \"All About You\" suffers only from a lack of focus; otherwise I think it's a nice track. \"She's So Cold\" is one-dimensional, but not bad, I guess. I'm surprised to find myself enjoying \"Dance,\" which is a pretty cheesy disco outing. \"Down In The Hole\" would be a great song if it had been developed a little more, and if Jagger had gone back to his earlier, subtler singing style. \"Where The Boys Go\" is a fun tune that would have been better suited for an early '80s Kinks album. Two of the songs simply sound like filler to me: \"Send It To Me\" starts off nicely, but settles into a typical reggae outing with at least a couple of pretty dumb touches; \"Summer Romance\" continues the Stones' adventures in the world of non-punk, with nothing special about it. The worst tracks for me include the big A-side, \"Emotional Rescue,\" which I really think is totally insipid, and the big ballad, \"Indian Girl,\" which is just plain embarrassing to listen to. So, generally, at least some of the songs are listenable, but this is one of those \"smaller than the sum of its parts\" albums. It doesn't have that intangible positive attitude that can raise it above its more mediocre moments. Couple this factor with the generally low number of bona fide strong tracks, and you have a Stones release that's weaker than any of its predecessors.\n\nGeorge already mentioned this, but the compilation Sucking In The Seventies includes \"If I Was A Dancer (Dance Pt. 2),\" which has the same backing track as \"Dance (Pt. 1),\" but with essentially a different song placed on top of it. If anything, it has less of a \"hype\" element to it, but is also significantly longer.\n\nRyan Maffei <chaucer@ix.netcom.com> (17.03.2002)\n\n...and we're back to Crapland U.S.A. This extension of the ambitions of blatancy the Stones expressed on their ho-hum Black and Blue album are continued on nicely here with the ridiculous disco anthem \"Dance (Pt.1)\", the slick, abysmal ballads \"All About You\" and \"Emotional Rescue\", and the why-are-they-doing-this-when-they're-so-goddamn-old-and-not-good-at-it? punk rockers \"Where the Boys Go\" and \"Summer (DEAR GOD) Romance\". Thrillingly bad; only the pleasant ballad \"Indian Girls\" and the middling blues-rocker \"Down in the Hole\" are worthwhile. I wish everybody would pick this album up for me, and then give it a good, swift kick in its vinyl ass.\n\nBill Slocum <slokes@optonline.net> (27.03.2004)\n\nI had the best possible preparation for listening to this album. Everything I read told me it sucked. So then when I listened to it, it was a nice surprise discovering how great it is.\n\nIf Barry Gibb was the one singing \"You're just a poor girl in a rich man's house,\" i.e. Emotional Rescue's title track, people would talk about the Bee Gees managing one fleeting grab at coolness. But it's the Stones, and because \"Emotional Rescue\" is a pop/disco song, however great, it's somehow not fitting of Mr. Velvet Lips. Over time, people have begrudgingly given the song its due, maybe because Mick's done some truly lacking variations on the \"Miss You\" theme [\"Anybody Seen My Baby?\"] and because its tongue-in-cheek qualities are more apparent today, like that knight in shining armor and \"YOU WILL BE MINE, YOU WILL BE MINE, ALL MINE.\" Also, the song has a fantastic groove, with Charlie's snare and brushwork and Ron's (not Bill, Tony Stewart points out) creaking bass dripping with Old World sophistication as Mick taunts the pampered object of his affection with his high-pitched poor-boy blues. A trip to Heaven and back in less than six minutes. Now people give the single a pass and dump on the album instead, because it is the 1980s and the Stones began to seriously decline as a musical force right about then. You can see that the Stones aren't producing many new ideas, just revisiting old ones. They tackle reggae, but they did that already. They try punk, but they did that before, too. Mick once claimed the Stones invented punk. The blues, world music, it's all been done before by these guys, and better. Something about this album recalls the title of an INXS song, \"Elegantly Wasted.\" This is the quintessential Elegantly Wasted Stones album. Everything on here seems to rot from within, but like the noble rot of the wine grape, it manages to produce something intoxicating all the same. \"Send It To Me\" is the song of a lazy millionaire flipping through a mail-order catalog searching for brides. The protagonist in \"Summer Romance\" has his lady already, only it's September and it's time for her to go back to high school while he lazes away the shank of the season under an unforgiving sun beside his backyard swimming pool. In \"Let Me Go,\" the album's best rocker, Mick is so jaded and sick of his love, he's thinking about visiting the gay bars just so she knows he's serious about cutting her off this time. Or as he puts it memorably: \"The chair is on the table.\" All these songs are not just clever in their sadistically bent narratives, they have great melodies, arrangements, driving beats, the Stones as Nature and Some Artificial Colouring Intended. However much they rock and roll, there's an archness about each of these gems, something distancing, that adds an element of interest and enjoyment for me but seems to annoy others. At least we all agree on \"She's So Cold,\" though I think it's of a piece with the rest of the album, not an outlier. Sure, there are lesser songs, this isn't a great album, but even \"Indian Girl\" and \"Down In The Hole,\" the two weakest tracks, have something to offer, exotic instrumentation in the first, and some driving blues in the second. I love the frothy choruses on \"Where The Boys Go,\" especially when the girls kick in. And Mick and Keith have some rare fun trading lines and riffs on \"Dance (Pt. 1).\" 1979-1980 was a very strange time for a lot of people in a lot of ways, and that included the Stones. Mick had his divorce from Bianca, Keef had his separation from Anita and (rumor has it) hush-hush Geneva blood transfers. Then there was the rise and fall of punk's challenge. Rock's royalty was taking stock of things from their penthouse while the barbarians (okay, boo-barians) were at the gate, and the result is some interesting frisson after they shut the doors at Studio 54 but before musical culture had moved on to its next big thing, New Wave. The Stones were reflecting the times just as well as they had in the 1960s and 1970s, not pioneering as much as they did then, but delivering some classic rock all the same, with a conscious nod this time at the artifice just beneath the music. What sets this album's weird dynamic for me more than anything else is that crazy cover. It looks like my 9th grade General Science textbook. Interesting Mick sported a beard for this brief period, wonder if that was why he went for that thermal-dynamic imagery.\n\njan lala <jlalis@seznam.cz> (15.06.2005)\n\nWhen I heard this cold and blue album firstly, I was in the night and empty street in our city, beetween closed shops and suddenly I heard \"Dance\" to my headphones.Ta tata, tooot, tutut....\n\nAnd I like this song, I can feel this blue, melancholy mood of this album. This is blue melancholy end of Rolling Stones's 70's decade, catch my drift? I like \"All about you\", sweet Keith's song, it reminds me Ozzy's \"Tonight\" or \"So Tired.\" And I like dark melancholy and little depressive \"Down in the hole\", bizzare \"Emotional Rescue\" with grotesque Mick's falsete and \"She's so cold\" of course. TATTOO YOU\n\nJeff <Jkh1392@aol.com> (06.09.99)\n\nFinally, I agree with one of your reviews word-for-word. No that the others have been bad (they were actually quite good), it's just that we have slightly different opinions (I still love \"I Got the Blues\"). But here-- here you've hit the nail right on the head. Tattoo You is a great album. One point of interest is that it sounds slicker and tighter than most Stones albums. You'd think I would miss the sloppiness of old, but how can I when the music sounds this bloody good?!? They sound so professional here, and by \"professional\" do I in no way mean \"stale\" or \"dull.\" I mean \"GOOD.\" My only complaint is that I don't know where each of the songs came from. I'll have to do a little research on that matter...\n\nSimon Hearn <simon@leehearn.freeserve.co.uk> (26.09.99)\n\nAnother one I have listened to again recently and slightly revised my opinion on. Ok ok - we know 'start me up' and 'waiting on a friend' are classics so I will skip past them. 'Black limousine' is the only other decent track on here in my opinion. When this album rocks (ie 'start me up') it is relentless, otherwise you could use it to cure insomnia - IT GETS SO SO BORING. How people can say it is the last GREAT stones album passes me by ? Voodoo is much better (quality of songs, track order and amount of tracks etc.) Now before you say, he's crazy this is a good album stop slagging it off, LISTEN ? I believe it is their second best album of 80's and 90's output - outshines undercover and dirty work with ease, but I do find it boring.\n\nI know you won't agree, but hey opinions make this page interesting, right?!\n\nTony Stewart <tony.remi.stewart@worldnet.att.net> (26.02.2000)\n\nWell I've been dreading this one more than any others. Tattoo You was a huge commercial success, spawned a very long and IMHO the first and only non-exciting Worldtour. Jagger wore weird pants and Wyman was beginning to look his age. This time we had a cherry picker, BUT we had MAC and STU on piano again. The band was by today's standards stripped to the roots and raggedy /tight the way only the Stones know how. Arena Rock was beginning to emerge, the shows were very long and we all got our bellies full. A new anthem was written, probably one of the best known Stonestunes ever; certainly the most 'heard' one, since Microsoft and every Sports franchise got a hold of the right s to it. It was the first Tour sponsored by a ...well sponsor. It was '81 and all these things stand for what the 80's ushered in and left us with. Corporate Rock. The disc itself is a real piece of work. Give Mick Jagger all the credit in the world for putting together a balanced disc,contemporary technology, a huge seller,without hardly any sessions, and nobody noticed. I am at a loss for words at how he pulled it off. First out of supposedly over 40 versions of interminable jams of a Reggaeriff, he pounced on the ONE time they tried it Rockstyle and detected the power of a Megahit, which was to be \"Start Me Up\". Even Keith tips his hat to Jagger on that one. Great hooks in the lyrics; Jagger likes the analogies of cars and chicks. He's done it a few times. \"Hang Fire\" from the (again) Pathe Marconi sessions, a very simple song that went through many changes that were all lyrical. The song was written the first time they played it. \"Slave\" is really sort of an edit a`la \"Just Wanna See His Face\" froma long jam. But where \"Face\" suceeded on it's Voodoogroove, this one had to be artificially mystefied by rumors like 'Pete Townshend on guitar', 'Percussion by so and so'. It could be \"Munich Hilton\" it could be \"Hey Negrita\" ten minutes later. It's your basic jam, and Jagger just could not get down on it. Saving grace is that mysterious Saxplayer. Keith gives us \"Little T&A\" highly popular during the tour; a great Keith song cause there's very few lyrics, but they all sound cool and you can sing any line anywhere and Fans loved it after a Twelvepack. \"Shotgunshoulder\" and \"she's my little rock'n roll, tits and ass\" . I mean what else can you ask for? \"Black Limousine\" seems to be a fave within the Stones themselves. They play it a lot to this day. And George, that violin is a harmonica. Probably a Glass Harmonica... Ron gets credit with J/R, but it's his song. The 'fast' side closes with \"Neighbors\", a very straight forward overcharged Rocker , the way Jagger wrote them back then. They all sounded forced, when he was still in his early guitar days. Sax Mysterioso again comes in to blow even harder. This particular chord progression was wearing a little thin. Try listening to \"Send It To Me\" and \"Neighbors\" back to back.\n\nThe reason I have been kind of dry about this whole side is because I do not like it. It is my least favorite Stones side of any disc ever. It's an intangible, but it is just so unemotional and stale to me. People and fans loved it, but this one has NOT stood the test of time very well. Except for the two biggies of the disc, the rest have kind of been cast aside for time being. Now Side Two, the 'slow' side is a WHOLE different story. To this day Taylorfans rightfully so have a BIG beef with the Stones and that Side of the disc. \"Tops\" a great midtempo ballad, not only was written inTaylor's days. I venture to say that it is him playing Lead on the actual released Take. Jagger does a low key Rap and some we finally hear some passion in his singing. Same with \"Worried About You\". Now we know this song was actually played at the El Mocambo gigs 4 years earlier. The Solo? Another major reason for Stonesfans to argue. Is it Wood? I think so. Is it Taylor? Many think so. Even more think since it dates back to the Great Guitarrist Hunt that it might be Wayne Perkins. The song itself is beautiful, with Jagger doing his best Jagger pleading \"Baby, pleeease..\" in Falsetto and then busting into his lower register. Some people just can't stand Falsetto. I love it and I love this song. \"Heaven\" is a very un-Stones like Ballad, psychedelic and a haunting melody. It's only Jagger on guitar, Wyman on Bass and Synth and Watts; I think we can add the delay on Jagger's vocal as another contributor.It is followed by one of those songs that will never be noticed much again and it is just a pity. This is where a song coming from the Stones almost hurts it. Their great tunes are countless and this is just another one. But the point is it is a great song. Just slides right by you, saying it. \"No Use In Crying\" one of those blusey, minor key ballads, brimming with soul and again we have Ron in the credits, which basically means it's Ron's song. Jagger is dynamite on it.The closer is a beauty. Absolutely fan-f*cking-tastic! A very unpretentious video didn't hurt it at all. What hurt it a little was that it too dated back to the days of Taylor. Jagger had to reach deep into the vault to find that gem. But boy we were glad he did. Words come to mind that are not usually associated with the Stones. 'Airy,light, pretty, accoustic spring'. And Sonny Rollins the Saxman Misterioso plays so sweet it puts a lump in your throat. Jagger for once with HIS heart on his sleeve, delivers the \"Feel-good\" lyrics over that irresistible Guitarhook in a totally unaffected manner. \"I'm not waiting on no lady, I'm just waiting on a friend\"...Sonny plays his horn, Mick and Keith are bopping down St. Mark's Place, the guitar plays and all is right in the world for a few brief moments as the disc fades out. I really hate writing more after that, because that is exactly the effect that last song produces. No more needs to be said today. But there is a first side that now, looking back I can feel as so Eighties, that gives us \"SMU\" and \"T&A\" and \"Limousines\" but also some really subpar work. Man I hate these numbers. I would say 12.\n\nStadelman <mkstad@netzero.net> (09.06.2000)\n\n'Heaven' and 'Just Want To See His Face' have a similar sound and feel to me.\n\nJohn McFerrin <stoo@imsa.edu> (27.10.2000)\n\nWow. I LOVE this album. I don't think I'd ever heard 'Start Me Up' in its entirety , and as such never had a chance to appreciate the subtle brilliance of the \"you make a grown man cry\" counterpoint. Elsewhere, 'Slave' is wonderful as hell - only The Stones could make a song with the line \"Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! I wanna be your slaaaaaaaave!!!\" into a great number. And complete dittos on 'Heaven'. And ... man, I love hearing Keith go \"a huh huh huh\" in a strange, almost french-mockery manner in 'Little T&A'.\n\nI'd easily give this a 14 - this is even more fun of a listen than Black and Blue!\n\nRaghu Mani <raghu_mani@yahoo.com> (01.01.2000)\n\nNow this is great. The first half is all rockers and the second half all ballads. Both sides are a little uneven but feature some of the Stones greatest songs. The album starts with (appropriately) 'Start Me Up' which is so good, it could have been on Beggars Banquet and it ends with 'Waiting on a Friend' which is utterly gorgeous. I don't want to say much more because all I'd be doing is agreeing with George's review - definitely a 9.\n\nPalash Ghosh <palash7@hotmail.com> (07.03.2001)\n\nTattoo You is a little better than Emotional Rescue -- but that's like saying that dog-sh_t is a little nicer than bird-sh_t! Granted, with this album, The Stones sound like they're actually TRYING to make well-arranged, complete songs - but the compositions are almost all weak.\n\nI will admit, however, that 'Little T&A' is one of my all-time favorite Stones rockers (courtesy of that dirty old man, Keith!). \"She's my little rock and roll, uh, huh, huh...\" It's insanely catchy and enjoyable -- sort of like a slightly watered-down version of 'Happy,' another great Keith number. 'Start me up' was played constantly on the radio when this album was released (to coincide with the launch of a massive tour). It sounds pretty good initially, but after the 15th time you hear it, it has little or nothing to offer. After this record, I totally gave up on The Stones, I just focused on their peak-period albums, and I never bought anything else from them ever again. I admit that I've never heard any of their records made after 1982 (except some singles on the radio). And while I probably shouldn't dismiss music that I've never heard, I just have a POWERFUL suspicion that anything they made since Tattoo You is just more garbage. It's depressing to think that terrible albums like Rescue and Tattoo were made nearly two DECADES ago, and The Stones are STILL hanging around!\n\nSergey Zhilkin <sergey_jilkin@mail.ru> (25.03.2001)\n\n<Stones are going back to their archives for inspiration. See what happens...>\n\nAn artist becomes an 'old fart' not when he's old but when he wants to conceal this fact. After all, you can't say that George Harrison or Bob Dylan "
