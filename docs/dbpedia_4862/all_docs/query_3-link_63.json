        "text": "June 5, 2019\n\nThis is what felt like a light-hearted tale of young student David Henchman who while out for a walks finds a dead body. Except when he comes back with the police the body has disappeared. It gets a bit farcical as the bodies swap several times. There's also a chase scene which went on a bit too long for me. I enjoyed the setting of the book and it does pack a lot into it. Quite enjoyable\n\nAugust 13, 2019\n\nI only quite recently realised how deficit my knowledge of old classic crime novels or even authors was. I am slowly working my way through (my) unknowns to identify if I am a true fan of the style of fiction. With this work as an example, I would say I need more familiarity with them but am definitely partial to the lot.\n\nThe reason for claiming I need to get used to the styles of these older authors is the speed of narration. The story only picks up beyond a point and some of them (like this one) do not provide too much of a character background in the time before the problem actually arises. If that bit had been shorter, I would have actually rated this five stars. A group out as a 'reading party' are enjoying a night out. This involves some rash decisions and a lot of jabbing each other with words. Finally, that scene ends and a new day dawns. This day sees our hero David Henchman out for an early walk to gather his thoughts and ponder over existential thoughts and read a little. His trek has him lost and he tumbles on to an odd situation. He finds a body followed by a suspect. When he tries to keep the suspect in his sights, David has to run for his life quite literally and very very fast. The trail that David leaves behind and the man he befriends turns out to be an unlikely powerful hero. This is the John Appleby of the series. I have never encountered the man and his work before but his behaviour towards David is equal parts faith and other parts as an elder would talk to a child they are humouring. This combination makes for an interesting read.\n\nAlthough the beginning of the tale was slow, once the plot thickened there was a lot to take in. It was funny in a serious fashion and overall was enjoyable. I could never have guessed the outcome although a few tricks were apparent. There are a lot of red herrings thrown our way but it is easy to accept the final reveal because of the gradual buildup. I would definitely pick up more books by the author and of John Appleby\n\nI received an ARC thanks to the publishers and NetGalley but the review is completely based on my own reading experience.\n\nMay 9, 2019\n\nDeath on a Quiet Day by Michael Innes\n\nAn Inspector Appleby Book #16\n\nOriginally published in 1956 this murder mystery was written over seventy years ago. I have to say that as I began reading I realized once again that books written long ago have much more description and less dialogue and action...or it often seems so. And yet, there is something to be said for the style of Innes writing. He may tend to tell the story more than have it unroll like a modern movie filled with special effects but once I got into the rhythm of the story I was definitely intrigued and wanted to find out what would happen.\n\nAs I read I realized that this book takes place only a few years after the austerity of WWII in England. I just looked up to find out when food rationing was discontinued and it was in 1954. It put this entire story in a different light for some reason. Many of the characters had been in the military or perhaps even spies but were back to “real” life again. Gettinga glimpse of that time period was a treat.\n\nDavid Henchman was an intriguing character. When he realizes his life is in danger he runs...and uses his brain to find a way to stay alive until he eventually runs into Inspector Appleby. Sir John Appleby may be on holiday in the area but his experiences before and now working for Scotland Yard have him seeing that David’s situation requires some looking into. As the two talk and David tells Sir John what he has experienced that morning the two realize that not only a murder or two have occurred but there is a mystery surrounding the deaths that needs to be looked into.\n\nI found the process Appleby used to find out what was going on very interesting in deed. There were no cell phones or computers or forensic tools as modern as now exist but find the reason and the murderer Appleby did.\n\nDid I like this book? Yes\n\nWould I read more of this series? I might\n\nDoes this story stand the test of time? Yes\n\nDo you need to read other books in the series before this one? No\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Agora Books for the copy to read – This is my honest review.\n\n4-5 Stars\n\nAugust 8, 2019\n\nThanks to NetGalley and Agora books for the review copy.\n\nI was cautious, if intrigued, through the first ten chapters. I appeared to be inside the head of an adolescent somewhere on the autism spectrum, in a schoolboys’ own adventure first published in 1956.. Then Appleby appeared, took charge and the narrative came together beautifully. I ended up engaged, full of admiration, not only at Innes’s skill as a story teller, but also his insight, compassion and integrity. While yes, there are bad eggs, they are, under normal circumstances, indistinguishable from good eggs. And good eggs behave pretty poorly at times. Innes understands stupidity, group dynamics, fears and adolescent decision making. I really enjoyed the encounter and unfolding relationship between Appleby and Peter Henchman . The touches of farce and satire are there, but in check\n\nIt would adapt well and easily to the screen. It is a very visual experience - with plenty of action and traversing of landscape.. Once again, female characters are most noticeable by their absence. Innes writes about what he knows - mainly men and boys. Within those parameters, Innes is confident, sensitive and original in his creation. I’m very pleased to have read it.\n\nNovember 8, 2019\n\nTo get away from it all, and his fellow students David goes into the country. What he did not expect to find is a body with a bullet through his head. What becomes even worse is that when the police are called in there is no body and David is left looking foolish.\n\nLike most mystery murders set in an older time frame, the story only gets going much later in the book which is not to everyone's taste. In modern mystery murder books the action seems to start from the first page, and this difference is something one has to get used to and understand that it is part of the build up of the story.\n\nThe setting is very good, the detective work is spot on and the characterization is good.\n\nJuly 5, 2019\n\nI love a good, old-fashioned mystery. By that I mean not just a mystery set in the past but a mystery written in the past, so the current fashion for reviving the classic whodunnits of the early and mid twentieth century causes me incredible joy. They’re different in style to today’s modern murder mysteries, with a lot less grit and (generally speaking) a lot less procedure, but so what?\n\nMichael Innes’s Death on a Quiet Day was written in 1956 and it begins not with a crime or a grim-jawed police officers but with a group of young male students on a study week in Devon. Their spirits bubble over, there’s a bit of (very 1950s style) banter and a game of chicken in which they all pack into a car, the driver takes his hands off the wheel and lets the car coast down a steep hill until one of them loses his nerve and reaches for the brake.\n\nThis is the set up for the subsequent discovery of a dead man on a moor and the chase which follows owes a lot to John Buchan and is fantastically gripping as one of the young men — ironically the one who was the “chicken\" in their game — is hunted down across the empty moors by the killer. Then enter Inspector Appleby, a detective who loves a puzzle — and who has a classic to handle.\n\nI really enjoyed this book. It’s a long time since my heart beat quite so quickly for a fictional character as David, the “chicken” repeatedly thinks he’s made his escape only for another twist of fate to throw him back in the villains’ path, becoming increasing tired, weak and desperate until the chase reaches its conclusion. And once that was over and the police became involved, the chase reversed, with the police and the students working together to identify the dead stranger and establish the cause of the crime.\n\nI loved the style, I loved the setting and I loved the chase. It was a fantastic, old-style murder with twist after twist — a profoundly satisfying read that makes me wonder how many more undiscovered gems there are in this genre from this period.\n\nThanks to Netgalley and Agora Books for a copy of this book in return for an honest review.\n\nAugust 2, 2019\n\nOriginally published on my blog: Nonstop Reader.\n\nDeath on a Quiet Day is the 16th Inspector Appleby mystery by Michael Innes. Originally released as Appleby Plays Chicken , this classic series is being reformatted and re-released to a new generation of mystery fans. This edition, out 9th May 2019 from Agora, is available in paperback and ebook formats.It also includes chapter 1 from book 17 of the series, The Long Farewell (1958).\n\nI've reviewed a number of these mysteries by Mr. Innes and all of them are erudite and cleverly humorous. There are several where Appleby doesn't make an appearance until the stage is set and the dramatics are well underway and this is another such. The descriptions of the settings, the isolation of the moors, and the characterizations and dramatic tension are masterful. Innes was a sublime and capable author, despite the majority of the Appleby books being light reading.\n\nThe language is polished and urbane and the whole is very civilized, despite being a murder mystery. There's a calmness about Innes' writing and I find him very relaxing to read.\n\nWorth noting for Kindle Unlimited subscribers many (most) of the Inspector Appleby books are available for download in the KU subscription for free.\n\nFour stars, comfort reading.\n\nDisclosure: I received an ARC at no cost from the author/publisher for review purposes.\n\nMay 27, 2019\n\nDavid Henchman, a member of a reading party with a bunch of students and their tutor Pettifor, is in a country inn in Monachorum. The boys play \"chicken\" one night, and the next morning David is ready to have a quiet time out in the country. He sees Knack Tor, and decides to climb it. As he is climbing he hear's a shot. As he crawls over the rim, he sees a man lying on his back holding a gun with a hole in his forehead. He looks around the edge and sees a man walking by and calls him up. It is soon apparent to David that the man might have something to do with the killed man. He starts running and has a wild time. The man chasing him blows a whistle and another man comes running. He tries to hook a ride with a young woman, but the car won't start. He runs more and goes into a decaying building where he throws a lot of bottles, jumps into a hay wagon, and finally jumps onto a riderless horse where he is still being followed. He loses his followers temporarily, and finds his friend Ian who was about to go in an ambulance, but they change places. The ambulance takes him to a police station where he meets Appleby. They go back to the Tor, and there is a different dead man lying there. The new corpse is Redwine, a man Appleby knows.\n\nBut the quiet day isn't over. At least one more man must die, while Appleby continues to his secret in an ivy-covered tower. This is a very convoluted plot, where the characters are not always what they seem, but it is certainly an exciting read.\n\nAugust 5, 2019\n\nThis is the 16th of the John Appleby series. It was first published in 1956. It has recently been published in May 2019 by Agora books.\n\nA young student David Henchman is out for a walk in the moors when he sees smoke on top of a hill. He climbs up to the top where he sees a dead man lying on his back with a bullet hole on his forehead and a gun at his hand. David looks around and sees a man at a distance walking away. He calls him up and they have a discussion. The stranger then picks up the gun and David realizes that he intends to shoot him. David runs away trying to escape. There is a long chase which is joined by some friends of the stranger. After several incidents, David finds himself in a Police station where he meets John Appleby of Scotland Yard. He tells him the entire story and then they return to the scene of the murder where a big surprise awaits them.\n\nThis is a thriller cum mystery. An interesting and intriguing story with lots of action and suspense. The characterization is good. The description of the settings is quiet vivid. There is also plenty of humour. A fun read.\n\nHowever, I have two complaints:\n\n1.The language used is highly literary/intellectual not consistent with a thriller/ mystery. This type of language extends even to the dialogues. No one talks in this manner in real life !\n\n2. The chase scene in the beginning goes on too long for several chapters which makes for dull reading.\n\nThanks to Net Galley and Agora Books for a free review copy.\n\nMarch 7, 2020\n\nThis is the 16th of the John Appleby series.

David Henchman has left the dreaming spires of Oxford to hike across Dartmoor, unfortunately he stumbles across a corpse at the top of Knack Tor, which somewhat destroys David's peaceful holiday. At first he assumes the corpse to be a suicide but the sudden arrival of another person changes his mind. David is then fleeing for his life, will he be the next victim?\n\nMichael Innes wrote for his time so the majority of the characters are upper class and, although his plots are good, his characterisation leaves a lot to be desired. I have read many of the Appleby series and this still irritates me. However as I said his plots are good and I would recommend this book for that reason, but don’t expect George Bellairs or Dorothy L. Sayers.\n\nJuly 3, 2020\n\nThere are several Appleby novels in which he doesn't appear until quite late, and this is one of them. It is, however, very recognisably Innes, with a typically deft and puzzling plot - one of his less-convoluted ones, which may please some readers, as not everyone enjoys the kind of flight of fancy he indulges in a tale like Appleby's End (I love it, whereas my husband thought \"indulges\" was the operative word, and that it just went too far). There's a nice plot twist though in this tale of a quiet holiday walk which turns into a chase across Dartmoor.\n\nThere's a definite sense that Innes knew Dartmoor, the book has a real feel of the place, which I found very satisfying, and Appleby is his usual patrician self.\n\nFebruary 15, 2022\n\nA great story and one I quite enjoyed reading.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nDesperate for some time away from his rowdy peers, David Henchman heads out of Oxford for a hike across Dartmoor. Relishing the peace and quiet, the last thing David expects to find at the top of Knack Tor is a dead body.\n\nPositioned with a gun in his hand and a bullet hole in his forehead, David assumes the shot was self-inflicted. But when somebody else ambles up the steep tor, David has second thoughts.\n\nAnd when shots ring out, David finds himself fleeing for his life across the wild moors. Will Appleby be able to find David before it’s too late – or will he be the next victim in this deadly game of cat and mouse?\n\nAugust 25, 2019\n\nI always find Michael Innes' books a pleasant and gripping read, well written and cleverly crafted.\n\nThis one was no exception and I can say it aged well.\n\nThe plot is unusual for a Golden Age mystery as it starts with a thrilling chase that keeps you on the edge.\n\nThe mystery is excellent, full of twists and turns.\n\nThe characters are well written as usual and quite interesting.\n\nI loved this book and i look forward to reading other books by Mr Innes.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nMany thanks to the publisher for this ARC, all opinions are mine.\n\nAugust 29, 2019\n\nThank you to NetGalley and the publisher Agora Books for the digital review copy.\n\nUnfortunately my forbearance with the author now seems to have reached its limit. I found this tedious and boring and very difficult to finish.\n\nMy sense of humour and love of the wry and ridiculous were untouched.\n\nThose who have not read any Innes should begin earlier in the series.\n\nSeptember 15, 2019\n\nThank you Net Galley. A fun read from the classic crime library.. A slow start that picks up as the book proceeds and the crime is discovered. Old time classics are charming. They are paced differently and the plot too, unfolds in a manner quite unlike present day mysteries.\n\nAugust 18, 2018\n\nThe chase scene seems to go on and on, but eventually the action shifts and the mystery is solved.\n\nSeptember 29, 2019\n\nThe best book from Michael that o have read. Well worth a read. Can't wait to read the next one.\n\nMay 3, 2020\n\nDNF at 54%. Life's too short for a book so dull and tedious...\n\nAugust 18, 2024\n\nbeautiful English\n\nSo very long ago: no social media, few telephones, posh boys in college, slow easy pace. Not everyday diet, but a pleasant change.\n\nAugust 11, 2019\n\nDavid and some fellow students are spending the summer studying and hiking. After a date gone wrong, David needs some time alone. His quiet hike doesn't go as planned. David finds a dead body. Then becomes the target of deadly game of hide and seek.\n\nI loved Innes' books when I was younger and I still enjoy them. While the world described in its pages has changed in myriad ways, the mix of emotions the main character feels had not. Inspector Appleby is still a trat. If you are a fan of classic British mystery, give this one a try.\n\nAugust 10, 2019\n\nI have always been a fan of Golden Age Crime Fiction but somehow never got round to reading Michael Innes. I don’t know why because he inspired one of my favourite authors Edmund Crispin who took the surname of his pseudonym and his detective's first name from a character in Innes’ novel ‘Hamlet, Revenge!’\n\nSo I shall start with Death On A Quiet Day courtesy of Netgalley and Agora Books.\n\nDavid Henchman is on a study holiday to Dartmoor with a tutor and some fellow students when he comes across a body with a gunshot wound to the head whilst out on a lone walk to rugged local beauty spot Knack Tor. The only other person he can see nearby quickly turns nasty and David goes on a run across country that would make a fell runner proud.\n\nAfter this exciting, edge of your seat chase across the moor he happens upon Detective Inspector Appleby of Scotland Yard who is visiting his wife’s relatives locally and they return to the body together, and here we have the first twist, it is a different dead man.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the chase across the moor and the later involvement of the other students in Appleby’s investigations.Although the local police were rather conspicuous by their absence, restricting themselves to one appearance in the police station and then happy to leave everything to good old Appleby.\n\nInnes was obviously a man who could spin a cracking good yarn. Part murder mystery, part thriller in the John Buchan style, he also throws in poetic quotes willy nilly.\n\nI will definitely be reading more from this series, and having just consulted Fantastic Fiction there are plenty.\n\nJanuary 21, 2020\n\nA thrillery detective novel with a number of twists. My first in this series and by this author, and I enjoyed it.\n\nApril 17, 2020\n\nDavid Henchman,a young undergraduate,several other young cubs and their tutor are participating in a reading party. In the morning they pore over texts and in the afternoon they climb hills and discover Dartmoor 's treasures.\n\nOne morning David visits Knack Tor with its magnificent views. When he finally, after a stiff climb,arrives at the top he is not alone. A corpse awaits him there. He then calls for help and manages to attract the attention of a casual passerby. But this hiker seems to have an altogether different agenda. What follows is a wilde chase through heather ,moors,meadows and country lanes. When David finally finds himself in a more safe environment, Inspector Appleby enters the story...\n\nI've read novels by Michael Innes before and it always amounts to the same thing,sometimes the storyline is definitely worthwhile and sometimes it is all over the place. More than one third of the book consists of young David's adventures while being chased by the assailants. It feels as if it never going to end and when it finally does, we are confronted by spies and not very intelligent or successful ones. There is definitely a boy scout feeling about. Fine if you like it but it didn't really work for me.\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\nThe Inspector Appleby books I’m finding to be quite a mixed bag, in the sense that you never know what you are going to get. They are always entertaining and will always have a crime at the centre but sometimes they can be relatively serious, sometimes a little more humorous and occasionally verging on farce and slapstick.\n\nThis is the case with Death on a Quiet Day. It starts with a fairly light-hearted description of college life focusing on a group of students, one of whom is to be caught up in a murder through no fault of his own. It then rapidly turns into a convoluted and ever increasingly unbelievable chase story along the lines of The 39 Steps. It is a good third of the way through, right at the end of the chase, before Inspector Appleby turns up and proves to be his usual cryptic self. It is here that things take a (relatively) more steady and sensible turn, with a proper investigation and a puzzle and solution that have a logic to them as well as some hidden factors that up the suspense.\n\nOnce again, really quite enjoyable!\n\nCopy supplied by NetGalley.\n\nAugust 29, 2016\n\nI was unsure about the Appleby series after reading jut the first novel. I have now decided I definitely enjoy this somewhat quirky Scotland Yard detective that seems to drag every character into his investigations as allies or co-conspirators. This novel involves a college reading group in\n\nEngland that are studying before tests. They go to stay in a smallish town. One of the students goes on a hike and runs across a dead body, which leads to a very complicated series of crimes. There is some English slang phrases that I did not know, which I enjoyed, although it made to stop reading to go find out what they meant. Oh, the versions of playing chicken in this novel are not the one I recognize as a born and bred California.\n\nMarch 5, 2016\n\nMichael Innes was the pseudonym of Scottish novelist and critic John Innes Mackintosh Stewart. As Michael Innes, he wrote some 40 detective novels for which he created his sleuth Inspector John Appleby, later Sir John Appleby. The novels are fun to read and quite academic in their allusions to literature and art. Some of the Appleby novels have been lately reprinted. Anyone who likes a good old British murder mystery should give these a go.\n\nNovember 28, 2016\n\nThis book has everything I love about Michael Innes novels: action, humor, literary references, a breezy plot, likeable characters, and--above all--Inspector John Appleby. The cover blurb from the Times Literary Supplement puts it perfectly: \"Ingenuous young men dash about creditably; disingenuous old ones are equally spry. Good humour abounds and the scenes of flight and pursuit are appropriately exciting.\" Yep!\n\nJune 8, 2019\n\nI haven't come across a story that has such a spectacular and nail-biting beginning. It just doesn't end there. Until the end, the reader is in for a whole lot of twists and turns and surprises. Totally entertaining and mind-blowing story this!\n\nThe storytelling is absolutely brilliant and entertaining. The plot to story development and character portrayal is magnificent. The ending is, again, full of twists and surprises. The identity of the rogues - unexpected."
