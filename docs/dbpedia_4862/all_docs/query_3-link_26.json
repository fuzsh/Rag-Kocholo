        "text": "Pittsford, NY\n\nPassed away December 8th at age 67.\n\nPre-deceased by her parents Philip and Dorothy Appleby, brother John, and daughter Jennifer.\n\nSurvived by her husband of 40 years Rick Leasure; daughters, Maggie (Andy), Anna (Sam); sons, Jack (Kelly), Benjamin (Sara); sisters, Pat Lankheet, Kate Appleby; brother, Joe Appleby; and eight grandchildren whom she adored.\n\nShe graduated from Mercy High School, Nazareth College and the University of Rochester Nursing School. She taught 5th grade and art. She later became a nurse and volunteered at the St. Joseph Neighborhood Center.\n\nA Love that Could Never Die\n\nAfter catching a glimpse of Jeanne at The Winfield one Sunday, Rick went to talk to her and she was gone. He returned for 6 weeks trying to find her- even asking a girl that looked like her if she had a sister that might be the girl he had seen that night, he was ready to exhaust all options. Then a coworker of his, who also worked with Jeanne, set them up on a blind date. He knew fate had brought them together and he was not going to let her go. After that first date, they stayed up on Jeanne’s mothers porch laughing until 3 am. He asked her to marry him two dates later. Their love for each other was unparalleled, and she never stopped laughing at his antics or taking care of him. Their love story was epic. Together, they raised their kids with endless love and fun. “Together” was the place our parents wanted to be, together with each other, together with their kids, and as the years went by, together with their eight grandchildren. Dorothy, Ernie, Maeda, Oscar, Arlo, Beau, Bridget and Tate made their way into the world. Each grandchild was met with hand knitted blankets, lots of grandma snuggles and a dab of Holy Water. Arlo remembered that every time she came over, she’d have a little treat in her pocket. The only thing that may rival grandma’s love for the eight of them, is their love for her. They were her greatest joy.\n\nRadical Compassion\n\nJeanne practiced not just charity, but an uncommon level of radical compassion. She felt especially inspired by Mother Theresa and painted portraits of her. As a registered nurse, she volunteered regularly at St. Joseph Neighborhood Center, which provides medical services to low-income people in Rochester. She also volunteered her time regularly at House of Mercy Homeless Shelter. Many times, she would cook an enormous meal – enough for more than sixty people – then personally drive it to one of her beloved shelters, serve the food, eat with everyone, share stories, smiles and compassion. In addition to donating so much of her time, talent, and money through these organizations, giving was really a way of life for Jeanne. If she encountered a person who was holding a sign in traffic asking for money, she had a rule to always give them something even if the all she had was a 100 dollar bill and if she didn’t have cash on her she would share a smile and let them know she cared. She lived every day with a helping heart.\n\nIt’s called fishing, not catching\n\nJeanne loved fly fishing. Throughout the spring, she would regularly be out hiking along the muddy banks of a river before the sun came up with her nephew, Tommy, her grandkids or her dear friend Janet. In the summers, she would wade out knee deep in the ocean or an Adirondack lake casting into the waves while her grandkids played nearby. She loved being out in nature and it never mattered to her if she caught any fish. After all, “It’s called fishing, not catching!”\n\nChatham & ADK\n\nFamily vacations were Jeanne’s Magnum Opus. Summer trips to Chatham, Cape Cod and Third Lake in the Adirondacks gave our family a treasure trove of memories, so much laughter and just pure, pure happiness. But most importantly, a reeeally good tan. She taught us all, everything feels better with some sunshine.\n\nNever Leave the Party Early\n\nEvery Christmas at the Leasure house looked like a scene from the nutcracker. She kept up many family traditions and created so many traditions of her own that meant so much to her kids, grandkids,nieces and nephews. Jeanne would organize a “Saint Nick Party” for all of her grandkids and their friends, where she sewed tiny aprons for each of the kids, baked sugar cookies to help them decorate them while Saint Nick filled their boots outside. Jeanne and the whole family would parade around the kitchen in a conga line dancing to Christmas songs. At Thanksgiving, Jeanne and her siblings carried on their childhood tradition of apple ducking. At weddings, Jeanne would always organize epic games of musical chairs which would inevitably result in her winning no matter what it took. She was a ruthless musical chairs competitor . For each of her grandkids’ birthdays, Jeanne would spend days decorating elaborate cakes specific to each child, and molding fondant figures of little creatures they loved. As her cancer progressed and her prognosis worsened, she said “ but I never leave the party early. I stay until the end. And then I help clean up.”\n\nGardens and Watercolors\n\nJeanne loved gardening. When she was a young woman, she worked as a gardener and a landscaper. After she and Rick got married and she had her own home, she used her talents for her own gardens, which were incredibly vibrant and exploded with color. She absolutely loved flowers and her gardens were on the tour for the Pittsford Garden Club. Jeanne loved Watercolor Painting and her favorite subjects were the flowers in her own garden.\n\nOpen the Windows to Hear the Birds\n\nAs a young mother, Jeanne would wake up before the sunrise to nurse her babies by the open window and listen to the birds. She found so much peace in these times. She would often keep her windows open when she slept no matter how cold it was because she loved to be awakened by the birds singing as the sun brought in another precious day. In December it is quite rare to hear the birds sing like they do in spring, but as she was passing away, we opened the window to hear the most beautiful chorus being sung just for her. Like the birds’ song, she was naturally beautiful and brought peace and comfort to nearly every soul she encountered.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to St. Joseph’s Neighborhood Center.\n\nCalling hours will be Sunday, Dec. 18 from 5–8 p.m. at Richard Keenan Funeral Home 7501 Pittsford-Palmyra Rd. Fairport, NY 14450. Funeral Mass will be Monday, December 19 at 1 p.m. at St. Louis Church 64 S. Main St., Pittsford, NY 14534."
